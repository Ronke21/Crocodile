<text>Lady Megan Arvon Lloyd George, (22 April 1902 – 14 May 1966) was a Welsh politician and the first female Member of Parliament (MP) for a Welsh constituency. She also served as Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, before later becoming a Labour MP, serving in Parliament for 30 years. In 2016, she was named as one of &quot;the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time&quot;.

==Background==

She was the youngest child of David Lloyd George and his wife, Margaret, being born in 1902 in Criccieth, Caernarfonshire. Her name at birth was registered with forenames Megan Arvon and surname George, but she adopted her father&#x27;s barrelled surname &quot;Lloyd George&quot;. As her father was raised to the peerage as Earl Lloyd-George of Dwyfor in 1945, she gained the style of &quot;Lady&quot; Megan (Lloyd George).

== Childhood ==

Lloyd George was imaginative and &quot;sprite-like&quot; when young, and was described in the local press as a &quot;daring sceptic&quot;, disliking her father&#x27;s stories of Daniel in the lions&#x27; den. Around the age of five, she would travel with her father to their house in Brighton, and delight his guests by bringing them an early morning cup of tea while they were still in bed.

She began public engagements at an early age, and on 16 November 1910, at the age of eight, performed the opening ceremony of the extension of the Claremont Central Mission in Pentonville.

==Liberal Party==
Like her brother, Gwilym, she followed her father into politics. She became the first female MP in Wales when she won Anglesey for the Liberals in 1929.

Along with her father, she refused to support Ramsay MacDonald&#x27;s National Government in 1931 and successfully held Anglesey as an opposition Liberal at the 1931 General Election. She held the seat again as a Liberal from 1935 to 1951. During World War II, she was a member of Radical Action, which called for a more radical political stance and for the party to withdraw from the war-time electoral truce.

Throughout the 1940s and 1950s she campaigned for a Welsh Parliament and the creation of a Secretary of State for Wales. Prominent among the radicals in the Liberal Party, she opposed what she saw as the party&#x27;s drift away from her father&#x27;s brand of liberalism. During the late 1940s, Lady Megan (as she was universally known) remained on friendly terms with Clement Attlee and there were rumours that she would join the Labour Party. In 1949, Lady Megan was elected Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party in a bid to create unity, but after losing her seat she stood down in 1952. Disillusioned with the Liberals, she indicated in November that year that she would not stand again in Anglesey.

==Labour Party==
In 1955, Lady Megan defected to the Labour Party. In 1957, she stood against the Liberals as the Labour Party candidate at a by-election in Carmarthen and won the seat, which she held until her death from breast cancer at Pwllheli in 1966, aged 64.

She was Philip Noel-Baker&#x27;s romantic partner from 1936 until Irene Noel-Baker&#x27;s death in 1956.

==Awards and legacy==
She was posthumously appointed as a Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour in the Dissolution Honours List published five days after her death.

In 2016 she was included in a list of &quot;the 50 greatest Welsh men and women of all time&quot;.

In 2019 a Purple Plaque to commemorate her was installed on the building that had been her family home in Cricieth.

<doc id="928581" wikidata="Q4705099" url="?curid=928581" title="Ala Moana, Honolulu">
<text>Ala Moana (meaning &quot;path to the sea&quot; in Hawaiian) is a commercial, retail, and residential district of Honolulu, Hawaii. It is located between Waikiki and Moiliili to the east, and Kakaako and Honolulu Harbor to the west. King Street, to the north, marks the border with the neighborhood of Makiki.

Ala Moana is situated along the southern shores of the island of Oahu and features a vast stretch of reef-protected white sandy beaches. The main roads through Ala Moana are Ala Moana Boulevard and Kapiolani Boulevard. Ala Moana is a major transfer point in Honolulu&#x27;s bus system. Across the street from Ala Moana Center is Ala Moana Beach Park, dedicated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s.

The civic center of Ala Moana is Ala Moana Center, once the largest shopping center in the United States and currently the largest open-air shopping center in the world. The shopping center was developed by Don Graham and opened August 13, 1959.

The area is currently experiencing residential and retail growth in addition to the shopping center.

==History==
The ancient Hawaiian name for the area was Kâlia. It originally included many fishponds, taro fields, swamps, and residences for the fishermen. The land was held as Hawaiian Government property and sold in 1861 to Lot Kamehameha. The parcel later passed into Bernice Pauahi Bishop&#x27;s holdings and later became part of the Bishop Estate which put the parcel up for sale around the time of Bernice Pauahi Bishop&#x27;s death in 1884. It was sold to Walter F. Dillingham in 1912 for $30,000. Dillingham established the Hawaiian Dredging Company in 1902 to build harbors along his father&#x27;s OR&amp;L Co.’s lines and, shortly thereafter, won the U.S. Navy contract to dredge the entrance channel to Pearl Harbor. The parcel of land in Ka􏰅lia provided a dumping spot for excess fill from dredging Pearl Harbor, creating the opportunity for future development.

Honolulu&#x27;s 1939-1944 master plan had zoned the property for hotels and apartments with a street grid through the site. A 1949 feasibility survey by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill convinced the developer, the Hawaiian Land Company, a newly formed subsidiary company of the Hawaiian Dredging Company headed by Walter Dillingham&#x27;s son Lowell, to request a change in zoning in order to develop the property into a shopping center. The study, prior to the construction of most of the island&#x27;s shopping centers, had found that urban Honolulu was underserved by retail outlets and that parking had become difficult in the downtown shopping area.

<doc id="928584" wikidata="Q2073765" url="?curid=928584" title="Behringer">
<text>Behringer is an audio equipment company founded by the Swiss engineer Uli Behringer on 25 January 1989 in Willich, Germany. Behringer produces equipment including synthesizers, mixers, audio interfaces and amplifiers. Behringer is owned by Music Tribe (formerly Music Group), a holding company chaired by Uli Behringer.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early development ===

Uli Behringer was born on April 13, 1961 in Baden, Switzerland. His father was a church organist and nuclear physicist; his mother a pianist and interpreter; his uncle a professor of composition at the Richard Strauss Conservatory in Munich; and his aunt a classical singer and pianist. At the age of four, Uli Behringer started to learn piano. When Behringer was five years old, his father acquired the organ from a church being demolished. He then helped his father integrate the organ with over 1000 pipes(?) into the family home. At the age of 16, he built his first synthesizer, the UB1.

=== Marketing, manufacturing, and acquisitions ===

While Behringer products were manufactured in Willich, Germany, many of the individual components were imported from mainland China. In 1990, to lower production costs, Behringer shifted production from West Germany to mainland China. Initially, subcontractors were engaged to produce the equipment. By 1997 Uli Behringer had relocated to Hong Kong to better supervise manufacturing quality.

==== CoolAudio acquisition ====

In May 2000, Behringer acquired the rights to the entire CoolAudio technology from Intersil Corporation, a US-based semi-conductor manufacturer specializing in integrated circuits for audio applications. The acquisition included an intellectual property portfolio and licensees such as Alpine and Rowe, among others.

==== Music Tribe City ====
In 2018, Music Tribe opened its own factory, Music Tribe City, in Zhongshan, Guangdong, China. The factory handles the production and distribution for Music Tribe&#x27;s 12 brands, including Behringer products.

== Instruments ==

Since 2016, Behringer has become a manufacturer of synthesizers and drum machines, which includes original models and recreations of analog hardware. Although some manufacturers, such as Curtis, are unhappy about their products being cloned, Behringer said that creating clones of older hardware is legal where the patents have expired.

In 2016, Behringer released its first commercial synths, the Deepmind 12 and Deepmind 6. Shortly after, they followed up with the Deepmind 12D which was a desktop alternative to the Deepmind synths. The design of the Deepmind was inspired by the Roland Juno-106. Their second original synth was the Neutron and their third was Behringer Crave, a semi-modular synthesizer released in 2019. The next synth was the Model D, a desktop clone of the Minimoog. The following year, the Poly D was released, with the same &quot;D type&quot; circuits as the Model D, but now with 4 oscillators and a keyboard. Since 2018, Behringer has recreated synthesizers and drum machines including the Roland TB-303, Korg Monopoly, Arp 2600, Arp Odyssey, Roland TR-808, TR-909, Roland SH-101, Minimoog, Sequential Circuits Prophet-600 and EDP Wasp.

== Controversies ==

=== Legal developments ===

==== FCC dispute ====

In February 2006, the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined Behringer $1M. The FFC issued a Notice of Apparent Liability claiming that 50 products had not been tested for conducted and radiated emissions limits as required by US law, and noted that it continued to sell the products for a year after being notified. Behringer&#x27;s position was that, since the units had passed stringent European CE standards, they would also comply with FCC verification requirements. According to Behringer, it had overlooked the differences in testing standards and procedures under FCC and European requirements. It has since implemented a complete UL certified safety and EMC testing laboratory under the UL Certified Witness Program, including in-house audits and global regulatory review systems.

==== Legal cases ====

In June 1997, the Mackie company (now LOUD Technologies) accused Behringer of trademark and trade dress infringement, and brought suit seeking $327M in damages. The claims were later rejected by the court. In their suit, Mackie said that Behringer had had a history of copying products by other manufacturers and selling them as their own. The Mackie suit detailed an instance, in which Behringer was sued by Aphex Systems for copying the Aural Exciter Type F. In that case Aphex Systems won DM690,000. The Mackie suit also mentioned similar cases filed by BBE, dbx and Drawmer. On 30 November 1999, the U.S. District Court in Seattle, Washington, dismissed Mackie claims that Behringer had infringed on Mackie copyrights with its MX 8000 mixer, noting that circuit schematics are not covered by copyright laws.

In 2005, Roland Corporation sued to enforce Roland&#x27;s trade dress, trademark, and other intellectual property rights with regard to Behringer&#x27;s recently released guitar pedals. The companies came to a confidential settlement in 2006 after Behringer changed their designs.

In 2009, Peavey Electronics Corporation filed two lawsuits against various companies under the Behringer/Music Group umbrella for patent infringement, federal and common law trademark infringement, false designation of origin, trademark dilution and unfair competition. In 2011 the Music Group filed a countersuit against Peavey for &quot;false advertising, false patent marking and unfair competition.&quot;

In 2017, Music Group filed a defamation lawsuit against Dave Smith Instruments, a Dave Smith Instruments engineer, and 20 Gearslutz forum users. The case was dismissed as a SLAPP lawsuit.

==== Fictional synthesizer advertisement ====

In March 2020, Behringer published a mock video for a synthesizer, the &quot;KIRN CorkSniffer&quot;, which appeared to mock the music technology journalist and synthesiser developer Peter Kirn. The video received criticism and accusations of using antisemitic imagery. Uli Behringer issued a response on Facebook, saying the video had been intended as &quot;pure satire by our marketing department&quot;. The apology was deleted the following day.

In 1997 Nevada passed a Renewable Portfolio Standard as part of their 1997 Electric Restructuring Legislation (AB 366) It required any electric providers in the state to acquire actual renewable electric generation or purchase renewable energy credits so that each utility had 1 percent of total consumption in renewables. However, on June 8, 2001, Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn signed SB 372, at the time the country&#x27;s most aggressive renewable portfolio standard. The law requires that 15 percent of all electricity generated in Nevada be derived from new renewables by the year 2013.

The 2001 revision to the RPS keeps in place Nevada&#x27;s commitment to expand solar energy resources by requiring that at least 5 percent of the renewable energy projects must generate electricity from solar energy.

In June 2005, the Nevada legislature passed a bill during a special legislative session that modified the Nevada RPS (Assembly Bill 03). The bill extends the deadline and raised the requirements of the RPS to 20 percent of sales by 2015. Coal was the main source for electricity in Nevada until it was surpassed by natural gas in 2005, which has generated more than half since then.

==Yucca Mountain Repository==
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is the proposed U.S. Department of Energy deep geological repository storage facility for spent nuclear reactor fuel and other radioactive waste.
The repository is located in a desert on federal land adjacent to the Nevada Test Site in Nye County, Nevada, about 80 miles from the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The repository lies within Yucca Mountain, a ridge line in the south-central part of the U.S. state of Nevada.
The ridge is composed of volcanic material (mostly tuff) ejected from a now-extinct caldera-forming supervolcano.

<text>Chutney music (Caribbean Hindustani: चटनी संगीत, 𑂒𑂗𑂢𑂲 𑂮𑂑𑂹𑂏𑂲𑂞, ) is a fusion genre of Indian folk music, specifically Bhojpuri folk music, with Caribbean calypso and soca music, and later with Bollywood music. This genre of music that developed in Trinidad and Tobago is popular in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, Suriname, Jamaica, other parts of the Caribbean, Fiji, Mauritius, and South Africa. Chutney music emerged mid-20th century and reached a peak of popularity during the 1980s. Several sub-genres have developed.

==History==
The contemporary fusion of genres that led to chutney music was created around the 1940s by Indo-Caribbean people of the West Indies, whose ancestors originally were brought to the region from the Hindi Belt as indentured labourers by the British, intended to replace slaves working on sugar plantations after slavery was abolished in the region. There were no recordings of chutney until 1968, when Ramdew Chaitoe, of Suriname, recorded an early rendition of the music. The album was called &quot;King of Suriname&quot; and all of the songs were religious in nature. However, Chaitoe soon became a household name with East Indians, not just in his native Suriname but throughout the Caribbean. Although the songs were religious in nature, all had a distinctly danceable sound. For the first time, Indo-Caribbeans had music that spoke to them personally, and was not specifically Indian, African, or European or American in style/roots. This was a breakthrough for East Indian Caribbean music, but the fame was shortlived.

Chutney music exploded, again, after 1968, with the singer Dropati releasing her album &quot;Let&#x27;s Sing &amp; Dance&quot;, made-up of traditional wedding songs. The record became a huge hit within the Indo-Caribbean community, gaining exposure for chutney music as a legitimate form of music, and uniting Indians, regardless of their birthplace.

1969 was a turning point for chutney music, when record producer Moean Mohammed recorded Sundar Popo with Harry Mahabir&#x27;s BWIA Orchestra. Sundar Popo modernised the music by including western guitars and early electronics into his music. Although Popo became known as the &quot;King of Chutney&quot;, the art of singing songs in &quot;chutney&quot; style was introduced by a singer named Lakhan Kariya, from the town of Felicity, Chaguanas who preceded Sundar Popo. Other artists, such as Indo-Trini artist Sam Boodram, followed in his footsteps, adding newer and modern instrumentation into songs. Chutney music, until then, remained a localised genre in Trinidad and Tobago, Guyana, and Suriname.

After the success of &quot;Kuchh Gadbad Hai&quot;, other Chutney artists began to fuse calypso, soca and American rhythm and blues, naming their music Indian soca. A young female artist named Drupatee Ramgoonai from Trinidad emerged on this new scene. At first she was criticized for being &quot;dutty&quot; (rude or crude in creole), because she wrote about sex and alcohol. This was nothing new, as she was following in the footsteps of other calypsonians who they sing about issues in their life or what is happening within the community. Drupatee was later given the title &quot;Queen of Chutney.&quot; By the end of the 1980s chutney music was introduced in Indian films.

During the 1990s, many &quot;mom &amp; pop&quot; and indie recording companies mushroomed and set-out to profit off of the chutney craze. Companies in the US and Canada began to sign chutney artists to their record labels. These included the successful Jamaican Me Crazy (JMC) Records, Spice Island Records, Mohabir Records, and JTS Productions. The establishment of nightclubs, such as Soca Paradise and Calypso City, in New York, and Connections and Calypso Hut, in Toronto, were also contributing factors vital in promoting Indo-Caribbean music overseas, as well as in the West Indies.

==Musical style==

The modern chutney artist writes lyrics in either Caribbean Hindustani or English, then lays them over beats derived from Indian dholak beats mixed with the soca beat.

Chutney is an uptempo song, accompanied by bass guitar, drum machine, electric guitar, synthesizer, dholak, harmonium, and dhantal, tassa played in rhythms imported from filmi, calypso or soca. Early chutney was religious in nature sung by mainly women in Trinidad and Tobago. Chutney is unusual in the predominance of female musicians in its early years, although it has since become more gender-mixed.

Early chutney pioneers include Sundar Popo, Sonny Mann, Lakhan Kariya, Sam Boodram, Budhram Holass, Yussuf Khan, Mookraj Sahadeo, Sagar Sookraj, Rakesh Yankaran, Anand Yankaran, Devanand Gattoo, Rasika Dindial, Dhanadeya Narine, Poonia Morgan (Moosie), Cecil Funrose, Heeralal Rampartap, Halima Bissoon, Joyce Ormela Harris, Nisha Benjamin, Kassri Narine, Sugrim Gobin, Komal Ram, Bisnauth Raghubir (Papas), Manie Haniff, Ebadath Khan, Elsie Sargeant (Dougla Elsie), Johnny Mykoo, Devindra Pooran, Queen Yasmin, Ashnie, Babla &amp; Kanchan, Dropati, and Ramdew Chaitoe.
The nature of current chutney songs are simple. They speak about life and love for many things, whether for a significant other or for an object of possession. Some chutney songs favor the topic of food or drink; however, like most West Indian music, there can be a hidden message found in the song if you read between the lines.

==Instrumentation==
Chutney music is typically played with the dholak, dhantal and harmonium. The melody of the music is provided by the harmonium, and the dholak and dhantal for the rhythm. More modernly, drum machines playing tassa have been incorporated into chutney as well. Tassa is drumming used in the Muslim Hosay festival, and is also played during Hindu weddings and other celebrations.

==Languages==
Chutney music is sung in Caribbean English, Caribbean Hindustani (a form of the Bhojpuri and Awadhi), and sometimes other Indian languages. Although chutney music has Hindustani words it has been deemed ownership by the local Indians and belongs to the Caribbean, it has not been recognized in the Indian music or film industry, it is of Indo-Caribbean culture. Traditionally speaking, the lyrics of chutney are from folk, classical, and religious music, but that has changed over the years. In modern chutney music, including the newer subgenres, the lyrics have evolved to be more contemporary and include more English.

==Subgenres==
The origin of chutney being in the Caribbean has meant that it&#x27;s been in close contact with different peoples, traditions, and other musical styles since its inception. According to the government of Trinidad and Tobago, roughly 35% of the country&#x27;s population is of Indian descent, another 34% of African descent, and the remaining 31% composed of a mix of European, Chinese, Middle Eastern, and other ancestry. This has allowed chutney to fuse with other genres and/or to implement new instruments into its own style, creating an array of syncretic subgenres including ragga chutney, chutney-bhangra, chutney hip-hop, soca-bhangra, and chutney soca.

Chutney soca is the most notable of these, as it has become virtually indistinguishable from what is considered normal chutney in recent years. Drupatee Ramgoonai coined the term with the release of her album, &quot;Chatnee Soca,&quot; in 1987. The style had an emphasis on Hindi lyrics and the beats of the dholak and dhantal. It was further popularized by the 1994 album, &quot;Soca Chutney,&quot; by Sonny Mann. It was credited as the best selling Indo-Caribbean album ever, with its title track hitting the top of charts not only in the Caribbean, but in the United States, Canada, and England.

Modern chutney soca, like many chutney subgenres, has incorporated more use of keyboards, drum machines, and other electronic instruments.

<doc id="928591" wikidata="Q26846" url="?curid=928591" title="Archelaus of Macedon">
<text>Archelaus (; ; died 399 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon from 413 to 399 BC. He was a capable and beneficent ruler, known for the sweeping changes he made in state administration, the military, and commerce. By the time that he died, Archelaus had succeeded in converting Macedon into a significantly stronger power. Thucydides credited Archelaus with doing more for his kingdom&#x27;s military infrastructure than all of his predecessors together.

== Family ==
Archelaus was the son of Perdiccas II and his wife, Simache, who is thought to have been once enslaved by Archelaus&#x27; uncle, Alcetas. Plato, through his interlocutors in &quot;Gorgias&quot;, wrote that Archelaus murdered both his uncle Alcetas and his unnamed seven year old half-brother to gain the throne, but this can not be confirmed. There is evidence to suggest that Cleopatra, the boy&#x27;s mother and Archelaus&#x27; step-mother, was in fact the same person as Archelaus&#x27; wife. For example, Aristotle refers to a wife of Archelaus as Cleopatra in &quot;Politics&quot;. Historian Nicholas Hammond argued that this is only coincidence and that Cleopatra was a common name for girls in Macedonia. However, there is little evidence to suggest that it was actually a frequent name in the fifth-century. Nevertheless, Archelaus had at least one child with a woman called Cleopatra. 

Archelaus had at least two daughters. Aristotle reports that Archelaus gave his eldest daughter to the king of Elimea while in a war against the Lyncestae and the younger to the future ruler Amyntas II (whom he labels Archelaus&#x27; son). His actual son, Orestes, would go on to be king, but there is confusion over whether or not Archelaus is the father of Argaeus II and Amyntas. Theopompus of Chios wrote that &quot;they call both Argaios and Pausanias Archelaos [sic]&quot; which Hammond emends to read, &quot;they call both Argaeus and Pausanias &quot;the son of&quot; Archelaus.&quot; The possibility that Argaeus was an Argaed is likely and, moreover, scholars are able to account for almost all other descendants of Alexander I. This line of thinking would also have the later royal challenger to Ptolemy of Aloros and Philip II, Pausanias (not the son of Aeropus II nor the assassin of Philip), be the son of Archelaus. However, not all historians are in agreement and the claim remains largely unverifiable.

Amyntas was most likely the son of Menelaus, Alexander I&#x27;s second son, but he could have also been the son of Archelaus. The prevailing view, advanced by Hammond, is that Archelaus married his younger daughter to Amyntas or Amyntas&#x27; son in order to stave off a future power struggle with the line of Menelaus. The argument is based in part on a line from Aelian&#x27;s &quot;Varia Historia&quot; about an Amyntas being Menelaus&#x27; son. The alternative theory holds that the polygamous Archelaus married his son (Amyntas) to his daughter to cement the branch lines: a half-brother and a half-sister.

== Reign ==
Almost immediately after he took power, Archelaus was faced with a situation which allowed him to completely reverse Macedon&#x27;s relationship with Athens, which had been a major threat for the past half century. The Athenians experienced a crushing defeat at Syracuse in late 413 during which most of their ships were destroyed. This left the Athenians in desperate need of a huge amount of timber to build new ships and Archelaus in a position to set the price. Archelaus generously supplied the Athenians with the timber they needed. In recognition of this, the Athenians honored Archelaus and his children with the titles of &quot;proxenos&quot; and &quot;euergetes&quot;.

Archelaus went on to institute many internal reforms. He issued an abundance of good quality coinage. He built strongholds, cut straight roads (important for movement of the military), and improved the organization of the military, particularly the cavalry and hoplite infantry.

== Culture ==

Archelaus was also known as a man of culture and extended cultural and artistic contacts with southern Greece. In his new palace at Pella (where he moved the capital from the old capital at Aegae), he hosted great poets, tragedians, including Agathon and Euripides (who wrote his tragedies &quot;Archelaus&quot; and &quot;The Bacchae&quot; while in Macedon), musicians, and painters, including Zeuxis (the most celebrated painter of his time). Archelaus reorganized the Olympia, a religious festival with musical and athletic competitions honoring Olympian Zeus and the Muses at Dion, the Olympia of Macedon. The greatest athletes and artists of Greece came to Macedon to participate in this event. In addition, Archelaus competed and won in Tethrippon in both Olympic and Pythian Games.

== Death ==
According to Aelian, Archelaus was killed in 399 BC during a hunt, by one of the royal pages, Crateuas. According to Constantine Paparrigopoulos, there were three accomplices: two Thessalians (Crateuas and Ellanokratis) and one Macedonian, Decamnichos. The latter used to be Archelaus&#x27; favorite (Aristotle says all three were, at some point.) However Decamnichos once insulted, in front of Archelaus, the tragic poet Euripides for the smell of the poet&#x27;s alleged bad breath. This outraged Archelaus who allowed Euripides to flog Decamnichos (or have him flogged) in punishment. Decamnichos was permitted to remain in the court of Archelaus; however, he did not forget about this treatment and thus participated in the killing of his king a few years later. Other versions of the king&#x27;s death are reported by differing sources.

<text>The Crowd is a 1928 American silent drama film directed by King Vidor and starring James Murray, Eleanor Boardman and Bert Roach. The feature film was nominated at the first Academy Award presentation in 1929 for several awards, including Unique and Artistic Production for MGM and Best Director for Vidor.

Kevin Brownlow and David Gill restored &quot;The Crowd&quot; in 1981, and it was released with a score by Carl Davis. In 1989, the film was one of the first 25 selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In February 2020, the film was shown at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, as part of a retrospective dedicated to Vidor&#x27;s career.

The film entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Plot==
Born on the Fourth of July, 1900, John Sims loses his father when he is twelve. At 21, he sets out for New York City, where he is sure he will become somebody important, just as his father had always believed. Another boat passenger tells him he will have to be good in order to stand out from the crowd.

John gets a job as one of many office workers of the Atlas Insurance Company. Fellow employee Bert talks him into a double date to Coney Island. John is so smitten with Mary, he proposes to her at the end of the date; she accepts. Bert predicts the marriage will last a year or two.

A Christmas Eve dinner in their tiny apartment with Mary&#x27;s mother and two brothers, with whom John is not on friendly terms, ends badly. John goes to Bert&#x27;s to get some liquor. A young woman there throws herself at him, complimenting him on his looks, and starts to dance with him. John returns home very late and very drunk. Mary&#x27;s family has gone home, and she tells him that they do not understand him. They exchange Christmas gifts and John compliments her, but yells at her when she does something trivial.

In April, they quarrel and Mary threatens to leave, and is shocked and hurt by John&#x27;s apathy when he does not try to stop her. The couple reconciles when Mary tells John that she is pregnant. She gives birth to a son. Over the next five years, the couple have a daughter and an $8 raise, but Mary is dissatisfied with John&#x27;s lack of advancement, especially compared to Bert, and in light of John&#x27;s big talk about his prospects.

Finally, John wins $500 for an advertising slogan; and buys presents for his family. When he and Mary urge their children to rush home to see their gifts, their daughter is killed by a truck. John is so overcome with grief, he cannot function at work. When reprimanded, he quits.

John gets other jobs, but cannot hold onto any of them. Mary&#x27;s brothers reluctantly offer him a position, but John is too proud to accept what he deems a &quot;charity job&quot;. In a fit of rage, Mary slaps him. John goes for a walk, contemplates suicide, but his son goes with him. The child&#x27;s unconditional love for him makes him rethink his situation, and he changes his mind. John gets work as a sandwich board carrier and returns home, his optimism renewed, only to find Mary about to leave with her brothers. She steps out of the house, but no further. She loves John too much to abandon him. The reconciled family attends a vaudeville comedy show, with the final shot showing them overcome with laughter, and lost in the crowded audience of laughing people.

==Production==
&quot;The Crowd&quot; was conceived by director King Vidor and filmed after the success of his previous film, the critically acclaimed box office success &quot;The Big Parade&quot;. Vidor wanted the new film to be innovative in its story, acting, and cinematography. The film mixes striking visual styles and moving camera cinematography – as well as hidden cameras in some of the New York City scenes, and subtle use of scale models and dissolves – influenced by 1920s German cinema and F.W. Murnau in particular, with intense, intimate scenes of the family&#x27;s struggle. Vidor avoided casting big-name stars in the film to attain greater authenticity; Murray had started as a studio extra, and had appeared in featured roles already, but had made his way to California riding boxcars and doing odd jobs such as shoveling coal and washing dishes. For his female lead, Vidor selected Eleanor Boardman, an MGM contract actress and also Vidor&#x27;s second wife.

Vidor&#x27;s great financial success at MGM in the 1920s allowed him to sell the unusual scenario to production head Irving Thalberg as an experimental film. MGM chief Louis B. Mayer reportedly disliked the film for its bleak subject matter and lack of a happy ending, and the studio held the film from release for almost a year. At the studio&#x27;s insistence, seven alternate upbeat endings were filmed, according to Vidor&#x27;s autobiography, and previewed in small towns. The film was finally released with two endings, one Vidor&#x27;s original ending, and another with the family gathered around a Christmas tree after John has gotten a job with an advertising agency. Exhibitors could choose which version to show, but, at least according to Vidor, the happy ending was rarely shown.

==Murray and Vidor in later years==
James Murray succumbed to alcoholism and became a &quot;Skid Row bum.&quot; When Vidor saw him on the street, panhandling, he offered Murray a part in his upcoming film &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;, but Murray angrily refused, saying &quot;Just because I stop you on the street and try to borrow a buck, you think you can tell me what to do. As far as I am concerned, you know what you can do with your lousy part.&quot; In 1936, his body was found in the Hudson River, a possible suicide. Vidor was haunted by Murray&#x27;s death, and in 1979 attempted to raise funds to film &quot;The Actor&quot;, a screenplay he had written based on Murray&#x27;s story, but the film was never made.

==Critical reception and influence==
&quot;The Crowd&quot; was a modest financial and critical success upon its initial release. Mordaunt Hall, a reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1928, called it &quot;substantial and worthy&quot; and &quot;a powerful analysis of a young couple&#x27;s struggle for existence in this city&quot;; but the trade publication &quot;Variety&quot; disagreed and described the film as &quot;a drab actionless story of ungodly length and apparently telling nothing.&quot;

Since then, &quot;The Crowd&quot; has been hailed by film critics as one of the greatest, most enduring silent films in American cinematic history. French director Jean-Luc Godard, when asked in the 1960s why more films were not made about ordinary people, he responded, &quot;&quot;The Crowd&quot; had already been made, so why remake it?&quot; Yet, at the time of its release, just before the start of the Great Depression, audiences were already seeking escapist entertainment over the realism portrayed in &quot;The Crowd&quot;, a stark realism that filmmakers would not embrace again until after World War II. The film, however, proved to be popular enough during the months after its distribution in 1928 that it grossed twice its production costs. The arrival of sound films at the same time combined to radically change filmmaking. Due to the limitations imposed by early sound-filming techniques, &quot;The Crowd&quot;″s innovations in camera movement would not be equaled for another decade.

Vidor used the John and Mary Sims characters again, with different actors, in his 1934 film &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot;. He also provided an insightful interview on the making of the film in a segment of the British documentary series &quot;Hollywood&quot; (1980).

==Awards and honors==
Nominations
* Academy Award for Best Unique and Artistic Production – Irving Thalberg for MGM
* Academy Award for Best Director, Dramatic Picture – King Vidor

==Soundtrack==
Composer Carl Davis created an orchestral score for the film in 1981, and it was released on video in conjunction with MGM and British television Thames Silents series in the late 1980s.

==Home media==
&quot;The Crowd&quot; was released on VHS as part of the MGM Silent Classics series in the 1980s, with a new score by Carl Davis. It was also released as part of a double-bill LaserDisc package with &quot;The Wind&quot;. Warner Bros. currently holds distribution rights to all of MGM&#x27;s silent films, including this one.

<text>A crowd is as a group of people that have gathered for a common purpose or intent. Examples are a demonstration, a sports event, or a looting (classified in sociology as an acting crowd). A crowd may also simply be made up of many people going about their business in a busy area.

The term &quot;the crowd&quot; may sometimes refer to the lower orders of people in general.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;crowd&quot; is sometimes defined in contrast to other group nouns for collections of humans or animals, such as aggregation, audience, group, mass, mob, populous, public, rabble and throng. Opinion researcher Vincent Price compares masses and crowds, saying that &quot;Crowds are defined by their shared emotional experiences, but masses are defined by their interpersonal isolation.&quot;

In human sociology, the term &quot;mobbed&quot; simply means &quot;extremely &quot;, as in a busy mall or shop. &quot;Mobbing&quot;, carries a more negative connotation associated with bullying. In animal behaviour, mobbing is a technique where many individuals of one species &quot;gang up&quot; on a larger individual of another species to drive them away. Mobbing behaviour is often seen in birds.

==Social aspects==

Social aspects are concerned with the formation, management and control of crowds, both from the point of view of individuals and groups. Often crowd control is designed to persuade a crowd to align with a particular view (e.g., political rallies), or to contain groups to prevent damage or mob behaviour. Politically organised crowd control is usually conducted by law enforcement but on some occasions military forces are used for particularly large or dangerous crowds.

According to Gustave Le Bon, an individual partaking in a crowd adopts certain characteristics such as a decreased ability to think consciously, a predominance of unconscious motives, succumbing easily to suggestion or contagion of feelings and ideas in a similar direction, and tend towards immediately bringing suggestions to action. In his view, most crowds are impulsive, irritable, incapable of reasoning, lack judgement and are fueled by an exaggeration of sentiments. Crowds typically follow an individual or an individual that supports an idea or belief that they deem superior or credible. Le Bon identified two classes of leaders: those that are energetic and have a strength of will and those whose strength of will is enduring, though the latter is thought to be the most impactful. His ideology suggests that the leader should affirm, repeat the affirmation, and foster contagion within the crowd in order to have lasting effects.

==Psychological aspects==

Psychological aspects are concerned with the psychology of the crowd as a group and the psychology of those who allow their will and emotions to be informed by the crowd (both discussed more comprehensively under crowd psychology).

Many studies on crowds have given insights on how crowds respond to different situations. One 2009 report highlighted many observable behaviors of crowds, including evidence that crowds are able to make united decisions regarding their direction and speed of movement, even if only a few of its members have the information required to make such decisions. The degree to which informed members can affect the crowd depends on their position within the group, with those in the crowd&#x27;s core likely to have a greater influence.

Generally, researchers in crowd psychology have focused on the negative aspects of crowds, but not all crowds are volatile or negative in nature. For example, in the beginning of the socialist movement crowds were asked to put on their Sunday dress and march silently down the street. A more-modern example involves the sit-ins during the Civil Rights Movement. Crowds can reflect and challenge the held ideologies of their sociocultural environment. They can also serve integrative social functions, creating temporary communities.

=== Types of crowd ===

There is limited research into the types of crowd and crowd membership and there is no consensus as to the classification of types of crowds. Two recent scholars, Momboisse (1967) and Berlonghi (1995) focused upon purpose of existence to differentiate among crowds. Momboisse developed a system of four types: casual, conventional, expressive, and aggressive. Berlonghi classified crowds as spectator, demonstrator, or escaping, to correlate to the purpose for gathering.

Other sociologists distinguished four types of crowds: casual, conventional, expressive, and acting. Casual crowds consists of people aggregated in the same place informally such as a coffee shop. There are also conventional crowds or those that come together for a regularly scheduled event including a church service and expressive crowds that meet to partake in an emotional time together like a wedding or funeral. Lastly, there are acting crowds that join to achieve a common goal or action, which could involve participating in a protest or riot.

Crowds can be active (mobs) or passive (audiences). Active crowds can be further divided into aggressive, escapist, acquisitive, or expressive mobs. Aggressive mobs, which are common in riots, are often violent and outwardly focused. Examples are football riots and the L.A. Riots of 1992. Escapist mobs are characterized by a large number of people trying to get out of a dangerous situation. Incidents involving crowds are often reported by media as the results of panic. However, the scientific literature has explained how panic is a myth which is used to mislead the attention of the public from the real causes of crowd incidents such as crowd crashes. Acquisitive mobs occur when large numbers of people are fighting for limited resources. An expressive mob is any other large group of people gathering for an active purpose. Civil disobedience, rock concerts, and religious revivals all fall under this category.

==Movement dynamics==
Studies have shown that human crowds move in ways that resemble fluid, and can be modeled by such methods as particle simulation and statistical physics. Similar observations have been made for car traffic and the movement of ant aggregations.

<text>Sir Mark Thatcher, 2nd Baronet (born 15 August 1953) is an English businessman. He is the son of Margaret Thatcher, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1979 to 1990, and Sir Denis Thatcher, 1st Baronet; his sister is Carol Thatcher.

His early career in business led to suggestions that he was benefiting from his mother&#x27;s position, notably in relation to the Al-Yamamah arms deal. He left the UK in 1986, and has since lived in the United States, Switzerland, Monaco, South Africa, Gibraltar, Barbados, Guernsey, and Spain. In 2003 &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; estimated his wealth at £60 million, most of which was suggested to be in offshore accounts.

In 2005, he was convicted and given a four-year suspended prison sentence and fined in South Africa for funding the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup attempt.

He has two children by his first wife, Diane Burgdorf. He married his second wife, Sarah-Jane Russell (&quot;née&quot; Clemence), in 2008. After his father&#x27;s death in 2003, he became Sir Mark Thatcher and succeeded to the Thatcher baronetcy, a hereditary title which had unusually been given to his father in 1990 (this being the only baronetcy created since 1964).

==Early life==
Thatcher and his twin sister, Carol, were born six weeks prematurely by caesarean section on 15 August 1953 at Queen Charlotte&#x27;s and Chelsea Hospital in Hammersmith, London, the same year that their mother qualified as a barrister. Their early years were spent in Chelsea, London. Their mother was narrowly defeated in her bid to become the Conservative Party candidate in the 1955 Orpington by-election. She was first elected to Parliament at the 1959 general election. The children, aged six at the time, featured in her first television interview. His sister observed: &quot;All my childhood memories of my mother were just someone who was superwoman before the phrase had been invented. She was always flat out, she never relaxed, household chores were done at breakneck speed in order to get back to the parliamentary correspondence or get on with making up a speech.&quot;

Mark was sent to board at Belmont School at the age of eight and then to Harrow School, which he left in 1971 having passed three O Level exams. He went on to study accountancy but failed his accountancy exams with Touche Ross on three occasions.

Having taken various short-term jobs Thatcher moved to Hong Kong, where he built up a network of business connections, particularly in the Middle East and in motor racing. In 1977 he set up Mark Thatcher Racing, which ran into financial difficulties.

==Missing during 1982 Paris-Dakar rally==
On 9 January 1982 Thatcher, his French driver, Anny-Charlotte Verney, and their mechanic went missing for six days in the Sahara whilst driving a Peugeot 504 in the Paris-Dakar Rally. They were declared missing on 12 January. His father flew to Dakar, where a large-scale search was launched, including six military aircraft from three countries and Algerian ground troops.

On 14 January, the Algerian military spotted Thatcher&#x27;s party 50 km (31 miles) off course. The Prime Minister insisted on paying £2,000 personally towards the cost of the search.

Before competing he said:
*&quot;I&#x27;ve now raced in Le Mans and other things – this rally is no problem.&quot;

In 2004, Thatcher wrote about his experience:
*&quot;I did absolutely no preparation. Nothing.&quot;
*&quot;We must have hit something. ... We stopped. The others stopped too, took a note of where we were and went on. But the silly bastards – instead of telling everyone we were 25 miles east when they finished the section, they told them we were 25 miles west.&quot;
*&quot;So The Boss (the prime minister) does entirely the right thing, picks up the phone to the ambassador in Algiers and says, &quot;Can you find out what is going on?&quot; The ambassador then rings the prefect of the region who says there are four people missing and that I am one of them.&quot;

==Business career==
During the mid to late 1980s, concerns were frequently expressed about possible conflicts of interest between his business interests and his mother&#x27;s political visits. In 1984 his mother faced questions in the House of Commons about his involvement in representing the bid of Cementation, a British company and a subsidiary of Trafalgar House, to build a university in Oman at a time when the prime minister was urging Omanis to buy British.

He has denied claims that in 1985 he received millions of pounds in commissions in relation to the £45 billion Al-Yamamah arms deal, a controversial arms sale by British Aerospace to Saudi Arabia; he has not denied that a house in Belgravia, London, was purchased for him for £1 million in 1987 by an offshore company controlled by Wafic Saïd, a middleman in the deal. In 1986 his mother again faced questions in the House of Commons, this time over her son&#x27;s relationship with the Sultan of Brunei.

Sir Bernard Ingham, the Prime Minister&#x27;s press secretary, suggested that he could best help the government win the 1987 general election by leaving the country. Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s biographer, David Cannadine, stated that Mark Thatcher &quot;traded shamelessly on his mother&#x27;s name&quot; and that he &quot;continued to attract controversy and investigation from the tax authorities&quot;, much to his mother&#x27;s embarrassment. Alan Clark mentions the &quot;Mark problem&quot; in his published diaries. He moved to Texas, where he worked for David Wickins of Lotus Cars and British Car Auctions and met his first wife in 1987.

In the United States he started Monteagle Marketing, a profitable company that sold whisky and clothing. During this period he spent some time in Switzerland as a tax exile, until he was forced to leave after the Swiss authorities began to question his residency qualifications. A security alarm business he ran in the United States failed and in 1996 he was prosecuted for tax evasion, at which point he moved to Constantia, South Africa, with his wife and their two children.

In 1998 South African authorities investigated a company owned by Thatcher for allegedly running loan shark operations. According to the &quot;Star of Johannesburg&quot;, the company had offered unofficial small loans to hundreds of police officers, military personnel and civil servants, and then pursued them with debt collectors. He claimed that officers had defrauded him and charges were dropped. It was also suggested that he had profited from contracts to supply aviation fuel in various African countries. In 2003, following the death of his father, he was allowed to use the title of &#x27;Sir&#x27; due to his inheritance of the Thatcher baronetcy a year before he was arrested in South Africa in connection with the 2004 Equatorial Guinea coup attempt. He pleaded guilty to breaking anti-mercenary legislation in January 2005. At this time &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; suggested that he had personal assets of £60 million, most of which was in offshore accounts.

In 2016 historic documents relating to Thatcher and Oman, expected to be released under the 30-year rule, were retained by the Government. &quot;The Guardian&quot; noted that the decision was made by John Whittingdale, a former political secretary to Margaret Thatcher.

==2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d&#x27;état attempt==

Thatcher was arrested at his home in Constantia, Cape Town, South Africa, in August 2004 and was charged with contravening two sections of South Africa&#x27;s Foreign Military Assistance Act, which bans South African residents from taking part in any foreign military activity. The charges related to possible funding and logistical assistance in relation to an attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea organized by Thatcher&#x27;s friend, Simon Mann. He was released on 2 million rand bail.

On 24 November 2004, the Cape Town High Court upheld a subpoena from the South African Justice Ministry that required him to answer under oath questions from Equatorial Guinean authorities regarding the alleged coup attempt. He was due to face questioning on 25 November 2004, regarding offences under the South African Foreign Military Assistance Act; these proceedings were later postponed until 8 April 2005. Ultimately, following a process of plea bargaining, Thatcher pleaded guilty in January 2005 to breaking anti-mercenary legislation in South Africa by investing in an aircraft without taking proper investigations into what it would be used for, admitting in court that he had paid the money, but said he was under the impression it was to be invested in an air ambulance service to help impoverished Africans. The judge rejected this explanation and Thatcher was fined R3,000,000 and received a four-year suspended prison sentence. An advisor to Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s President Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo told the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Focus on Africa&quot; television programme that: &quot;We are confident that justice has been done&quot;, and did not indicate that the country would seek Thatcher&#x27;s extradition.

During his trial in Equatorial Guinea in June 2008 Simon Mann said that Thatcher &quot;was not just an investor, he came completely on board and became a part of the management team&quot; of the coup plot. In 2024, Mann provided &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; with access to emails and unpublished memoirs providing additional information. On the 20th anniversary of the coup attempt, the newspaper published an article on the coup which states the emails &quot;show that Sir Mark negotiated a profit-sharing arrangement&quot;.

==Personal life==
Thatcher moved to Dallas, Texas, in the mid-1980s, where he met his first wife, Diane Burgdorf (later wife of James Beckett), in 1987. Their first child was born in 1989, and their second child was born in 1994. In 1992, he became The Honourable Mark Thatcher when his mother was made a life peer. In 1996, he moved to South Africa following financial scandals in the United States.

In 2003, he became The Honourable Sir Mark Thatcher, 2nd Baronet of Scotney when he succeeded to the hereditary Thatcher baronetcy awarded to his father in 1990. He and his wife announced their intention to divorce in September 2005 after eighteen years of marriage. His wife moved back to the United States with their children, the same year that he pleaded guilty in relation to an attempted coup in Equatorial Guinea. Questions were raised in the UK Parliament about whether he should be stripped of his title.

Following his guilty plea and his divorce, he left South Africa in 2005 for Monaco on a one-year temporary residency permit, while his wife and children returned to the United States. Thatcher was unable to get a US visa due to his South African conviction and remains barred from entering the United States.

His Monaco residency was not renewed as he was said to be on a list of &quot;undesirables&quot; who would not be allowed further residency and he was required to leave by mid-2006. He was refused residency in Switzerland and settled in Gibraltar, where he married his second wife, Sarah-Jane Russell, in March 2008. Russell is the daughter of Terence J. Clemence, a property developer, and sister to Claudia, Viscountess Rothermere. She was formerly married to Lord Francis Hastings Russell, the younger son of John Russell, 13th Duke of Bedford.

He was in Barbados when he received news of his mother&#x27;s death. He returned to the UK to act as chief mourner at her funeral, which took place at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, on 17 April 2013.

In April 2016, Thatcher was named in the Panama Papers scandal; he has ownership of a house in Barbados as the beneficiary of a trust.

In 2019, he became a grandfather.

==Titles and styles==
Thatcher is entitled the usage of the pre-nominal style &quot;The Honourable&quot; following the elevation of his mother to the peerage as a baroness in 1992; he shares this courtesy with his twin sister, Carol. After the death of his father in 2003, he inherited the Thatcher baronetcy which had been awarded to his father in 1990, the first baronetcy created since 1964. Following his conviction in relation to the Equatorial Guinea coup d&#x27;état in 2004, it was suggested that he should be stripped of the title.

<text>John Rodgers (August 8, 1812 – May 5, 1882) was an admiral in the United States Navy. He began his naval career as a commander in the American Civil War and during his postwar service became an admiral.

==Early life and career==
Rodgers, a son of the famous Commodore John Rodgers, was born near Havre de Grace, Maryland. He received his appointment as a midshipman in the Navy on April 18, 1828. Service in the Mediterranean on board and opened his long career of distinguished service, and he commanded an expedition of Naval Infantry and Marines in Florida during the Seminole Wars. In the mid-1850s he succeeded Commander Ringgold in command of the North Pacific Exploring and Surveying Expedition, which added greatly to the knowledge of far eastern and northern waters. Following his promotion to commander in 1855, he married and settled to work in the Navy&#x27;s Japan Office in Washington, D.C., where he was serving when the Civil War broke out.

==Civil War service==
Commander Rodgers&#x27; first war assignment was to go with Commodore Louis M. Goldsborough to Gosport Navy Yard on April 20, 1861, where with other officers he was to remove Naval vessels and assets so they could not be used by the Confederates. Virginia had only just declared her secession from the Union. Upon arrival they found the yard in shambles, as Commodore McCauley had already ordered the vessels at Gosport scuttled, including the , since he considered the yard indefensible. Commodore Goldsborough made the decision to destroy the yard, and Commander Rodgers and Army Captain of Engineers Horatio G. Wright were given the job of destroying the drydock. They were thwarted in this attempt when the fuse was extinguished by water in the pumping gallery. Commander Rodgers and Captain Wright were captured by General William B. Taliaferro of the Virginia State Militia, but since Virginia had not yet joined the Confederate States, and was therefore not at war against the United States, Governor John Letcher returned the two officers to Washington.

Commander Rodgers was then sent to the Western Rivers, where he organized the Western Flotilla and supervised construction of the City-class gunboats, the first ironclad gunboats on the western rivers. He was relieved by Captain Andrew Hull Foote, a more senior officer being required by the Navy to deal with the prickly Major General John C. Fremont. After blockading operations off of Savannah in command of the , he assumed command of the experimental ironclad in April 1862, operating with distinction in the James River. He commanded the James River Flotilla, including the USS &quot;Galena&quot;, the ironclad , and the 90-day gunboat in an expedition up the James River in May 1862, which was stopped eight miles shy of Richmond by Confederate fortifications at Drewry&#x27;s Bluff. The damage that the &quot;Galena&quot; suffered in the ensuing battle caused him to report, &quot;We demonstrated that she is not shotproof&quot;, and made him disdainful of trying experiments in the fires of war. Thereafter he supported General McClellan&#x27;s Peninsula Campaign with Naval bombardment, preventing Confederate forces from overrunning the Army of the Potomac&#x27;s position.

John Rodgers was promoted to captain July 16, 1862 and took command of the ironclad monitor . After successfully navigating her from Brooklyn to Charleston through the same storm that sank the , he distinguished himself during the attack on Fort Sumter in May 1863, and in capturing the Confederate ram &quot;Atlanta&quot; on June 17, 1863. The latter service won him the Thanks of Congress and promotion to commodore. Unfortunately, this was his last active service in the Civil War. After recovering from an illness, he took command of the ironclad monitor . Design and construction problems with that vessel kept him occupied for the remainder of the war, though he earnestly desired a more active post.

==Post-war career==

Rodgers then commanded the Boston Navy Yard from 1866 until 1869. He was elevated to rear admiral in December 1869 and given command of the Asiatic Squadron on February 5, 1870. In 1871, he commanded the American squadron in the United States expedition to Korea. Upon returning to the United States, he was selected for command of Mare Island on June 15, 1873, where he served for almost four years. He was appointed Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory in April 1877 and died in the role in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 1882. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

==Namesake==
Rodgers&#x27; father was Commodore John Rodgers (1772–1838) and his grandfather, also named John Rodgers, was a colonel who commanded a regiment during the Revolutionary War. Admiral Rodgers was the grandfather of pioneering Naval aviator Commander John Rodgers (1881–1926). Six ships of the United States Navy have been named in their honor; either as or .

==Family== 
He was the father of William L. Rodgers, who became an Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy. 

His brother, , served as a colonel in the Union Army during the American Civil War and was married to Sarah C. Perry who was the daughter of Commodore Matthew C. Perry. His nephews Frederick Rodgers and (1848-1933) (sons of Robert), would both become Rear Admirals in the United States Navy.

<doc id="928608" wikidata="Q657325" url="?curid=928608" title="Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)">
<text>Time Out of Mind is the thirtieth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released on September 30, 1997, through Columbia Records. It was released as a single CD as well as a double studio album on vinyl, his first since &quot;The Basement Tapes&quot; in 1975.

For many fans and critics, the album marked Dylan&#x27;s artistic comeback after he appeared to struggle with his musical identity throughout the 1980s; he had not released any original material since &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot; in 1990. &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; is one of Dylan&#x27;s most acclaimed albums, and it went on to win three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year in 1998. It was also ranked number 410 on &quot;Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot; in 2012.

The album has an atmospheric sound, the work of producer (and past Dylan collaborator) Daniel Lanois, whose innovative work with carefully placed microphones and strategic mixing was detailed by Dylan in his memoir, &quot;&quot;. Although Dylan has spoken positively of Lanois&#x27; production style, he expressed dissatisfaction with the sound of &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. Dylan has self-produced his subsequent albums.

== Background and writing ==
In April 1991, Dylan told interviewer Paul Zollo that &quot;there was a time when the songs would come three or four at the same time, but those days are long gone...Once in a while, the odd song will come to me like a bulldog at the garden gate and demand to be written. But most of them are rejected out of my mind right away. You get caught up in wondering if anyone really needs to hear it. Maybe a person gets to the point where they have written enough songs. Let someone else write them&quot;.

Dylan&#x27;s last album of original material had been 1990&#x27;s &quot;Under the Red Sky&quot;, a critical and commercial disappointment. Since then, he had released two albums of folk covers, &quot;Good as I Been to You&quot; and &quot;World Gone Wrong,&quot; and &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot;, a live album of older compositions; there had been no signs of any fresh compositions until 1996.

Dylan began to write a fresh string of songs during the winter of 1996 at his farm in Minnesota, which would later make up &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. Criteria Studio in Miami, Florida, was booked for recording. In a televised interview with Charlie Rose, Lanois recalled Dylan talking about spending many late nights working on the lyrics. Once the words were completed, according to Lanois, Dylan considered the record to be finished saying, &quot;You know, whatever we decide to do with it, that&#x27;s that.&quot; Lanois replied: &quot;What&#x27;s important is that it&#x27;s written&quot;.

== Recording sessions ==

Dylan demoed some of the songs in the studio, something he rarely did. Members of Dylan&#x27;s touring band were involved in these sessions. Dylan also used these loose, informal sessions to experiment with new ideas and arrangements. Dylan continued rewriting lyrics until January 1997, when the official album sessions began. It was the second collaboration between Dylan and Lanois, who had previously produced Dylan&#x27;s 1989 release &quot;Oh Mercy&quot; and was known for his work with artists such as Emmylou Harris (on &quot;Wrecking Ball&quot;) and U2 (on &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; and &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;). Dylan wanted the sound of &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; to be influenced by early blues musicians, such as Charley Patton, Little Walter, and Little Willie John, and he recommended that Lanois listen to their recordings to prepare for the sessions.

New personnel hired for the album included slide guitarist Cindy Cashdollar and drummer Brian Blade, both hired by Lanois. Dylan brought in Jim Keltner, who was Dylan&#x27;s tour drummer from 1979 to 1981. Dylan also hired Nashville guitarist Bob Britt, Duke Robillard, Tex-Mex organist Augie Meyers, and Memphis pianist Jim Dickinson to play at the sessions.

According to Lanois, Dylan likes old 1950s records since &quot;they had a natural depth of field which was not the result of a mixing technique&quot;. He used a Sony C37A microphone, which was also used to record Dylan&#x27;s album &quot;Oh Mercy&quot;. Various other devices were used to produce the album&#x27;s distinctive sound. Lanois also devised a method to accommodate new or revised lyrics later in an original take, since this was often the case with Dylan.

With two different sets of players competing in performance and two producers with conflicting views on how to approach each song, the sessions were far from disciplined. Years later, when asked about &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, Dickinson replied, &quot;I haven&#x27;t been able to tell what&#x27;s actually happening. I know they were listening to playbacks, I don&#x27;t know whether they were trying to mix it or not! Twelve musicians playing live—three sets of drums... it was unbelievable—two pedal steels, I&#x27;ve never even heard two pedal steels played at the same time before! ... I don&#x27;t know man, I thought that much was overdoing it, quite frankly&quot;.

Lanois admitted some difficulty in producing Dylan. &quot;Well, you just never know what you&#x27;re going to get. He&#x27;s an eccentric man...&quot; In a later interview, Lanois said Dylan and he used to go to the parking lot to discuss the recording in absence of the band. Lanois elaborated their discussion on the song &quot;Standing in the Doorway&quot;. &quot;I said &#x27;listen, I love &quot;Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands&quot;. Can we steal that feel for this song?&#x27; And he&#x27;d say &#x27;you think that&#x27;d work?&#x27; Then we&#x27;d sit on the fender of a truck, in this parking lot in Miami, and I&#x27;d often think, if people see this they won&#x27;t believe it!&quot; With &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, Lanois &quot;produced perhaps the most artificial-sounding album in [Dylan]&#x27;s canon,&quot; says author Clinton Heylin, who described the album as sounding &quot;like a Lanois CV&quot;.
Dylan talked about his difficulty at the recording sessions in an interview with &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine. &quot;I lose my inspiration in the studio real easy, and it&#x27;s very difficult for me to think that I&#x27;m going to eclipse anything I&#x27;ve ever done before. I get bored easily, and my mission, which starts out wide, becomes very dim after a few failed takes and this and that.&quot; In the same interview Dylan cited Buddy Holly as an influence during the recording sessions.

In relation to past works like &quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot;, &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, and &quot;Infidels&quot;, Dylan said:

The album&#x27;s cover art is a blurry photo of Dylan in the recording studio, taken by Lanois.

== Songs ==
;&quot;Love Sick&quot;

The first track on this album is the sparsely recorded &quot;Love Sick&quot;, which was subsequently also released as a single. Daniel Lanois later said about the recording process of this song, &quot;We treated the voice almost like a harmonica when you over-drive it through a small guitar amplifier&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Grayson Haver Callin wrote that the song shows Dylan as he &quot;shuffles through empty streets in the rain, a tangle of warped guitar, haunted organs, and faint drums aptly framing his bleak mood&quot;. Dylan performed &quot;Love Sick&quot; live at the 1998 Grammy Awards ceremony.

;&quot;Dirt Road Blues&quot;
&quot;Dirt Road Blues&quot; was improvised from a country-blues riff of indeterminate origin. Lanois recalls, &quot;He made me pull out the original cassette, sample sixteen bars and we all played over that [for the released version]...&quot; Some critics criticized the performance for being &#x27;mediocre&#x27; and for destroying the mood that was set up by the opening track. Michael Gray writes, Dirt Road Blues&#x27;, which
might under normal production circumstances be a heartening, even dexterous little rockabilly number, puts Dylan so far away and so tiny you just despair&quot;.

;&quot;Standing in the Doorway&quot;
;&quot;Million Miles&quot;
&quot;Million Miles&quot; has a 1950s blues and rock and roll atmosphere. Critics have noted that the song nods to Little Willie John, Elvis Presley, and B.B. King.

;&quot;Tryin&#x27; to Get to Heaven&quot;
;&quot;&#x27;Til I Fell in Love with You&quot;
In &quot;&#x27;Til I Fell in Love with You&quot;, Dylan scholar Jochen Markhurst points to echoes of Ma Rainey&#x27;s &quot;South Bound Blues&#x27;, as well as the influence of Slim Harpo. The &quot;Time out of Mind&quot; outtake &quot;Marchin&#x27; to the City&quot; can be considered an earlier version of this song; in any case the songs share a few lyric lines.

;&quot;Not Dark Yet&quot;

&quot;Not Dark Yet&quot;, the first of two singles from the album, was described by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as &#x27;the moody album&#x27;s center&#x27; and was included in its &quot;Ten Best Bob Dylan Songs&quot; article of 2011. The song explores the singer&#x27;s own existential crises. &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; was recorded at the early recording sessions and featured &quot;a radically different feel&quot;, according to Lanois. &quot;[The demo of &#x27;Not Dark Yet&#x27;] was quicker and more stripped-down and [later during the formal studio sessions], he changed it into a civil war ballad&quot;.

The song is analyzed by Professor Christopher Ricks in his book &quot;Dylan&#x27;s Visions of Sin&quot;. Ricks draws parallels between &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; and John Keats&#x27;s poem &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot;. Both works are musings on mortality, and Ricks argues that &quot;similar turns of phrase, figures of speech, [and] felicities of rhyming&quot; can be found throughout &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; and the &quot;Ode&quot;: &quot;The memories of &quot;Ode to a Nightingale&quot; in &#x27;Not Dark Yet&#x27; come from throughout the &quot;Ode&quot;, diffusedly there.&quot; A promotional video of this song was released.

;&quot;Cold Irons Bound&quot;

The next song, &quot;Cold Irons Bound&quot;, won the 1998 Grammy for best male rock vocal performance. Oliver Trager describes the track as &quot;biting&quot; with &quot;ricocheting guitar licks, rockabilly drums, distorted organ, and [a] voice floating in a blimp of its own echo,&quot; in which &quot;one can still hear, to paraphrase &#x27;Visions of Johanna&#x27;, the ghost of electricity howling from the bones of Dylan&#x27;s face...&quot; Michael Gray also describes this song in detail:

;&quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot;

The song &quot;Make You Feel My Love&quot; was recorded twice under the title &quot;To Make You Feel My Love&quot; by other artists: Billy Joel recorded the song for his &quot;Greatest Hits Volume III&quot; collection before Dylan released the song; subsequently, Garth Brooks recorded it for the &quot;Hope Floats&quot; soundtrack. It was recorded under the original title by Bryan Ferry on &quot;Dylanesque&quot; and by Adele on &quot;19&quot;. This song was criticized for its lyrical inferiority by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;″s Robert Christgau and Greg Kot of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In his review, Kot described the track as &quot;a spare ballad undermined by greetingcard lyrics [that] breaks the album&#x27;s spell&quot;. Opposing his view, Dylan critic Paul Williams said that it was &quot;refreshing&quot; to his ears. He said: &quot;...the ultimate effect is to strengthen the spell the whole record casts—this musical and verbal break is exactly in place&quot;.

;&quot;Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;
The penultimate track of the album is &quot;Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;. Greg Kot wrote, &quot;On &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, [Dylan] paints a self-portrait with words and sound that pivots around a single line from the album&#x27;s penultimate song, &#x27;Can&#x27;t Wait&#x27;: &quot;That&#x27;s how it is when things disintegrate&quot;&quot;. An alternate version of this song is included on the album &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 8 – Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006&quot;. (Deluxe Editions of this album contain two alternate versions of the song.)

;&quot;Highlands&quot;

The closing track, at time of release the longest composition ever released by Dylan, the 16-minute &quot;Highlands&quot;, most probably took its central motif (&quot;My heart&#x27;s in the highlands&quot;) from a poem by Robert Burns called &quot;My heart&#x27;s in the highlands&quot; (published in 1790). In Jim Dickinson&#x27;s account, &quot;I remember, when we finished &#x27;Highlands&#x27;—there are two other versions of that, the one that made the record is the rundown, literally, you can hear the beat turn over, which I think Dylan liked. But, anyway, after we finished it, one of the managers came out, and he said, &quot;Well, Bob, have you got a short version of that song?&quot; And Dylan looked at him and said: &#x27;That &quot;was&quot; the short version&#x27;&quot;.

The song describes a story of the narrator and his interactions with a waitress of a restaurant in Boston Town. Dylan mentions Neil Young and Erica Jong in this song. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote: &quot;The material here is generally slow and meditative, lending the work a consistent tone appropriately capped by the 16-minute &#x27;Highlands&#x27;, a &#x27;Desolation Row&#x27;-style experiment with an extended song form; it&#x27;s further proof that the singer/songwriter is far from coasting&quot;.

== Outtakes ==
Fifteen songs were recorded for &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;, of which eleven made the final cut.

The first song that did not make the album was &quot;Mississippi&quot;, which was re-recorded for &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. According to Dylan, &quot;If you had heard the original recording of [&#x27;Mississippi&#x27;], you&#x27;d see in a second&quot; why it was omitted and recut for &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. &quot;The song was pretty much laid out intact melodically, lyrically and structurally, but Lanois didn&#x27;t see it. Thought it was pedestrian. Took it down the Afro-polyrhythm route—multirhythm drumming, that sort of thing. Polyrhythm has its place, but it doesn&#x27;t work for knife-like lyrics trying to convey majesty and heroism&quot;. Dylan offered the song to Sheryl Crow, who recorded it for &quot;The Globe Sessions&quot;, released in 1998, before Dylan revisited it for &quot;Love and Theft&quot;. Three outtakes of &quot;Mississippi&quot; from the &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot; sessions were included on &quot;The Bootleg Series Vol. 8 – Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006&quot; (two versions on the generally released discs and one on a bonus disc included with the Deluxe Edition of the album).

A second outtake, &quot;Dreamin&#x27; of You&quot;&#x27;, also released on &quot;Tell Tale Signs&quot;, was unveiled for the first time as a free download on Dylan&#x27;s website. Its lyrics were partly adapted into &quot;Standing in the Doorway&quot;, though the melody and music are completely different. The music video, which starred Harry Dean Stanton, premiered on Amazon.com.

Two more songs, &quot;Red River Shore&quot; (which according to Jim Dickinson was &quot;the best song there was from the session&quot;) and &quot;Marchin&#x27; to the City&quot; (which evolved into &quot;&#x27;Til I Fell in Love with You&quot;), were left off the final cut. They were both included on Tell Tale Signs.

Over the years, some fans have criticized Dylan for some of the creative decisions made with his albums, particularly with song selection. &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; was no different except this time the criticism came from colleagues who were disappointed to see their personal favorites left on the shelf. When Dylan accepted the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, he mentioned Columbia Records chairman Don Ienner, who &quot;convinced me to put [the album] out, although his favorite songs aren&#x27;t on it&quot;.

== Reception ==

=== Commercial reception ===

&quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; was a commercial success for Dylan. It was widely hailed as Dylan&#x27;s comeback album and U.S. sales soon passed platinum and stayed on best-selling charts for 29 weeks. In UK the sales passed gold. The album, in other countries also, managed to secure positions on best-selling charts and remained there for several weeks. Again the album&#x27;s highest chart position worldwide was in Norway, where it peaked at No. 2.

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; received mostly positive reviews and began a renaissance of Dylan&#x27;s career. In a 2018 retrospective for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Grayson Haver Currin wrote that the album &quot;would transform Dylan from seemingly obsolete icon to wise, wizened visionary almost overnight&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau said, &quot;The hooks are Dylan&#x27;s spectral vocals—just his latest ventriloquist&#x27;s trick, a new take on ancient, yet so real, so ordained—and a band whose quietude evokes the sleepy postjunk funk of Clapton&#x27;s &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; without the nearness of sex&quot;. He later regarded it as &quot;one of those nearness-of-death albums&quot;, along with Mississippi John Hurt&#x27;s &quot;Last Sessions&quot; (1972), Warren Zevon&#x27;s &quot;The Wind&quot; (2003), Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Wind&quot; (2005), and Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;American VI: Ain&#x27;t No Grave&quot; (2010).

On the NY Rock website, Cook Young called the songs &quot;superb&quot;. He described &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; as &quot;a curious album. It&#x27;s sort of two records mixed together. Half the songs compare to the introspective plaintive compositions that we witnessed on &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;. The other half are 12-bar blues ditties that often sound as if Bob is making &#x27;em up as he goes&quot;. &quot;&quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; is fantastic&quot;, said Elvis Costello. &quot;I think it might be the best record he&#x27;s made&quot;.

Some critics criticized Lanois&#x27;s production for, as Currin wrote, &quot;warping Dylan’s voice too much, for burying it in a cloud of effects&quot;. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote, &quot;&quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; has a grittier foundation—by and large, the songs are bitter and resigned, and Dylan gives them appropriately anguished performances. Lanois bathes them in hazy, ominous sounds, which may suit the spirit of the lyrics, but are often in opposition to Dylan&#x27;s performances&quot;. Michael Gray writes, &quot;The sound is elsewhere unhelpful too on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;. Some tracks have Dylan so buried in echo that there is no hope of hearing the detailing in his voice that was once so central and diamondlike a part of his genius&quot;.

Alex Ross wrote:Everything on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; goes under one dreamy, archaic mood. The album manages to skip the twentieth century: trains discourage gambling, people ride in buggies, there&#x27;s no air-conditioning (&quot;It&#x27;s too hot to sleep&quot;), church bells ring, &quot;gay&quot; means happy, the time of day is measured by the sun, lamps apparently run on gas (and are turned &quot;down low&quot;) and, most of the time, the singer is walking. He is almost ready to stray into the rustic wasteland of Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;, which opens with the Dylanesque lines &quot;I came here a stranger/ A stranger I depart.&quot; The wistfulness is intense...The melancholy could become crushing, but Dylan doesn&#x27;t let it. The best songs on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; are inexplicably funny; there&#x27;s a wicked glee in the performance as Dylan manipulates the tatters of his voice, the scatterdness of his inspiration, the paralysis that might arise from his obsession with history, the prevailing image of himself as a mumbling curmudgeon.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
Shortly after completing the album, Dylan became seriously ill with near-fatal histoplasmosis. His forthcoming tour was canceled, and he spent most of June 1997 in excruciating pain. A potentially serious condition (caused by the fungal infection &quot;Histoplasma capsulatum&quot;), it makes breathing very difficult. &quot;It was something called histoplasmosis that came from just accidentally inhaling a bunch of stuff that was out on one of the rivers by where I live&quot;, said Dylan. &quot;Maybe one month, or two to three days out of the year, the banks around the river get all mucky, and then the wind blows and a bunch of swirling mess is in the air. I happened to inhale a bunch of that. That&#x27;s what made me sick. It went into my heart area, but it wasn&#x27;t anything really attacking my heart&quot;, Dylan told &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine.

In light of Dylan&#x27;s May 1997 health scare, a number of columnists, including Dylanologist A. J. Weberman, speculated that the songs on &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; were inspired by an increased awareness of his own mortality. This was despite the fact that all of the songs were completed, recorded, and even mixed before he was hospitalized. In interviews following its release, Dylan dismissed these speculations.

Beside being ranked as number 410 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, in both Pazz &amp; Jop&#x27;s critics poll and &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; was voted as album of the year. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 652 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

At least two artists have covered &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; in its entirety: guitarist Stephen Michael (recording under the name &quot;Georgia Sam&quot;) and Arve-Gunnar Heløy, who not only recorded every track but translated all of the lyrics into Norwegian.

Hip hop group Public Enemy referenced the album&#x27;s title in their 2007 Dylan tribute song &quot;Long and Whining Road&quot;: &quot;From basement tapes, beyond them dollars and cents / Changing of the guards spent, now where the hell the majors went? / Most of their time out of mind, hating my mess-age rhymes&quot;.

A 2021 &quot;Irish Times&quot; article ranking all 39 of Dylan&#x27;s studio albums placed &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; first.

The National&#x27;s Aaron Dessner has cited it as his favorite Dylan album.

=== 40th Grammy Awards ===
At the 1998 Grammy Awards, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot; won in the categories of Album of the Year, Best Contemporary Folk Album and, for &quot;Cold Irons Bound&quot;, Best Male Rock Vocal Performance. At the awards ceremony, Dylan performed the song &quot;Love Sick&quot;. During the performance, Michael Portnoy, an American multimedia artist and choreographer, ripped off his shirt, ran up next to Dylan, and started dancing and contorting with the words &quot;Soy Bomb&quot; painted in black across his chest. Dylan shot an alarmed glance at Portnoy, but carried on playing. Portnoy continued to dance for about 40 seconds, until another of the background dancers escorted him off stage.

<text>Dame Jilly Cooper, (born Jill Sallitt; 21 February 1937) is an English author. She began her career as a journalist and wrote numerous works of non-fiction before writing several romance novels, the first of which appeared in 1975. Cooper is most famous for writing the &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot;.

==Early life==
Jill Sallitt was born in Hornchurch, Essex, England on 21 February 1937, to Mary Elaine (née Whincup) and Brigadier W. B. Sallitt, OBE. She grew up in Ilkley and Surrey, and was educated at the Moorfield School in Ilkley and Godolphin School in Salisbury.

==Journalism and non-fiction==

After unsuccessfully trying to begin a career in the British national press, Cooper became a junior reporter for &quot;The Middlesex Independent&quot;, based in Brentford. She worked for the paper from 1957 to 1959. Subsequently, she worked as an account executive, copywriter, publisher&#x27;s reader and receptionist. Her break came with a chance meeting at a dinner party. The editor of &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot;, Godfrey Smith, asked her to write a feature about her experiences. This led to a column in which Cooper wrote about marriage, sex and housework. That column ran from 1969 to 1982, when she moved to &quot;The Mail on Sunday&quot;, where she worked for another five years.

Cooper&#x27;s first column led to the publication of her first book, &quot;How to Stay Married&quot;, in 1969, and which was quickly followed by a guide to working life, &quot;How to Survive from Nine to Five&quot;, in 1970. Some of her journalism was collected into a single volume, &quot;Jolly Super&quot;, in 1971. The theme of class dominates much of her writing and her non-fiction (including &quot;Class&quot; itself), which is written from an explicitly upper-middle-class British perspective, with emphasis on the relationships between men and women, and matters of social class in contemporary Britain. 

==Fiction==
As with her non-fiction works, Cooper draws heavily on her own point of view and experiences. For example, her own house is the model for Rupert Campbell-Black&#x27;s. Both houses are very old, although his is larger; her house overlooks a valley called Toadsmoor, while his overlooks a valley called the Frogsmore. She also draws on her love of animals: dogs and horses feature heavily in her books. Woods, hills, fields, pastures and rivers feature frequently. Cooper has been called &quot;the queen of the bonkbuster&quot;, a British term similar to bodice-ripper.

===&quot;Emily&quot;===
In 1975, Cooper published her first work of romantic fiction, &quot;Emily&quot;. It was based on a short story she wrote for a teenage magazine, as were the subsequent romances, all titled with female names: &quot;Bella&quot;, &quot;Imogen&quot;, &quot;Prudence&quot;, &quot;Harriet&quot; and &quot;Octavia&quot;. In October 1993, seven years after &quot;Private Eye&quot; had pointed out the similarities, Cooper admitted that sections of &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;Bella&quot; were plagiarised from &quot;The Dud Avocado&quot; by Elaine Dundy, but said that it was not deliberate.

===&quot;Octavia&quot;===
&quot;Octavia&quot; is one of Cooper&#x27;s &quot;name&quot; books, which each bear a female character&#x27;s name, and has been made into a television movie. It is set in Britain during the 1970s. The broadcast ITV adaptation was produced with a screenplay which was written by Jonathan Harvey.

One character was modelled on George Humphreys, a Welshman with whom Cooper had an affair in the late 1950s.

&quot;The Times&quot; noted that Cooper avoids the traditional romantic convention in which the heroine remains a virgin until the last page. Elizabeth Grey found the jokes annoying but still funny, and confessed to falling in love with the character of Octavia.

===&quot;Riders&quot; and the &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot;===
Cooper&#x27;s best-known works are her Rutshire novels. The first was &quot;Riders&quot; (1985), an international bestseller, and the first volume of &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot;. The first version of &quot;Riders&quot; was written by 1970, but shortly after Cooper had finished it, she took it with her into the West End of London and left the manuscript on a bus. The London &quot;Evening Standard&quot; put out an appeal, but it was never found. She was, she says, &quot;devastated&quot;, and it took her more than a decade to start it again.

&quot;Riders&quot; and the following books feature intricate plots, multiple story lines and a large number of characters. The books are linked by recurring characters and sometimes overlap each other. The stories heavily feature sexual infidelity and general betrayal, melodramatic misunderstandings and emotions, money worries and domestic upheavals.

Each book of the &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot; is set in a glamorous and wealthy milieu, such as show jumping or classical music. These aspects are contrasted with details of the characters&#x27; domestic lives, which are often far from glamorous.

===&quot;Pandora&quot;===
Her novel &quot;Pandora&quot; is not one of the Rutshire Chronicles, but does feature a few characters from the series, and is very similar in style and content. &quot;Wicked!&quot; follows the same approach, including characters from previous novels and introducing new characters who are relatives, friends or rivals of existing characters. It is set in the fictional county of Larkshire, which borders her other fictional county, Rutshire.

===&quot;Jump!&quot;===
Her novel &quot;Jump!&quot; was released in 2010. It features characters from the &quot;Rutshire Chronicles&quot; in the world of National Hunt steeplechase racing, and tells the transformation of a mutilated horse (Mrs Wilkinson) into a successful racehorse. After publication, it was revealed that Cooper had named a goat in the book (Chisolm) in order to hit back at the critic Anne Chisholm.

===Children&#x27;s books===
Cooper also wrote a series of children&#x27;s books featuring the heroine Little Mabel.

==Personal life==
In 1961, she married Leo Cooper, a publisher of military history books. The couple had known each other since 1951 (when Jilly Sallitt was about fourteen), although they did not marry until she was 24 and he was 27. The couple was unable to have children naturally, so adopted two children. They have five grandchildren. The Coopers&#x27; marriage was greatly disrupted in 1990 when publisher Sarah Johnson revealed she and Leo had had an affair for several years, though Jilly and Leo eventually reunited. In 1982 the couple left Putney, southwest London, for The Chantry, an old manor house in Gloucestershire.

Jilly Cooper was a passenger in one of the derailed carriages in the Ladbroke Grove rail crash of 1999, in which 31 people died, and crawled through a window to escape. She later spoke of feeling that her &quot;number was up&quot; and of being absurdly concerned, due to shock, about a manuscript she had been carrying.

Leo Cooper was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 2002. He died on 29 November 2013, at the age of 79. In 2010, Cooper suffered a minor stroke.

Cooper has stated that she is a football fan, and supported Leeds United when she lived in Yorkshire. She is also a supporter of the Conservative Party. Cooper was also in favour of the Iraq War.

In 2018, Cooper said that because of the Me Too movement, young men and women no longer feel free to flirt with one another, and that she enjoys being the subject of wolf whistles.
Cooper is an animal lover and has owned many dogs, in particular, retired greyhounds including Feather and Bluebell.

==Honours and awards==
Cooper was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to literature, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to literature and charity, and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to literature and charity.

On 13 November 2009 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Letters by the University of Gloucestershire at a ceremony in Gloucester Cathedral. She is Honorary Doctor of Letters at Anglia Ruskin University.

==Film and television productions==
In 1971, Cooper created the comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s Awfully Bad for Your Eyes, Darling&quot;, which featured Joanna Lumley, and ran for one series.

Television adaptations of Cooper&#x27;s novels were produced for ITV and Disney+.

Apart from &quot;Octavia&quot;, other productions include the television mini-series &quot;The Man Who Made Husbands Jealous&quot;, starring Hugh Bonneville, produced by Sarah Lawson, &quot;Riders&quot;
and, in 2024, &quot;Rivals&quot;, starring David Tennant, Aiden Turner and Alex Hassell, produced by Eliza Mellor

<text>Mediacorp Pte. Ltd. is the state-owned media conglomerate of Singapore. Owned by Temasek Holdings—the investment arm of the Government of Singapore—it owns and operates television channels, radio, and digital media properties. It is headquartered at the Mediapolis development in Queenstown&#x27;s One-north precinct, which succeeded Caldecott Hill—the long-time home of its predecessors—in 2015; as of 2022, Mediacorp employs over 3,000 employees; a large number of them are in both public and private sector broadcasting.

The company forms half of the mass media duopoly in the country alongside SPH Media Trust; the company was established in its current form in 1999, following the 1994 privatization of one of its predecessors—the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC)—as a group of state-owned enterprises known as Singapore International Media.

Mediacorp holds a monopoly on terrestrial television in Singapore, operating six channels broadcasting in the official languages of English (Channel 5 and the pan-Asian news channel CNA), Mandarin Chinese (Channel 8 and Channel U), Malay (Suria), and Tamil (Vasantham), as well as the streaming service meWatch. It also operates eleven radio stations, and the websites &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;8days&quot;—both of which had previously operated as print publications.

Its monopoly on terrestrial television was briefly broken in the early-2000s by SPH MediaWorks. In 2004, amid struggles at its two channels, SPH sold the MediaWorks subsidiary to MediaCorp in exchange for stakes in its television and publishing businesses; only its Chinese-language Channel U would continue under MediaCorp. SPH divested its stake in MediaCorp in 2017 after &quot;Today&quot; ceased print publication.

==History==

===1925–1965: Pre-independence era===

====First experiments====
The history of radio broadcasting in Singapore began with the formation of the Amateur Wireless Society of Malaya (AWSM) in April 1925, which launched shortwave transmission from a studio in the Union Building at Collyer Quay using a 100-watt transmitter lent by the Marconi Company under callsign 1SE (One Singapore Experimental). The transmissions could be received as far as Penang, albeit with atmospheric interferences at times. In 1930, Sir Earl from the Singapore Port Authority commenced its short wave broadcast every fortnight either on Sundays or Wednesdays. The BBC World Service of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) was inaugurated on 19 December 1932 as the BBC Empire Service, broadcasting on shortwave and aimed principally at English speakers across the British Empire. In his first Christmas Message (1932), King George V characterised the service as intended for &quot;men and women, so cut off by the snow, the desert, or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them&quot;. First hopes for the Empire Service were low. The Director General, Sir John Reith, said in the opening programme:

Don&#x27;t expect too much in the early days; for some time we shall transmit comparatively simple programmes, to give the best chance of intelligible reception and provide evidence as to the type of material most suitable for the service in each zone. The programmes will neither be very interesting nor very good.

In Singapore, the BBC World Service in English is essentially treated as a domestic broadcaster, easily available 24/7 through long-term agreement with British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation which expanded the array of programmes available for resident listeners. In 1933, Radio ZHI was launched as the first professional shortwave broadcasting station in Singapore. Owned by the Radio Service Company of Malaya, it was a shortwave radio station that delivered static-free broadcasts. Radio ZHI acquired a loyal following in Singapore and abroad. Despite its success, the station closed at the end of December 1936 when its license expired because the British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation was granted the status of having the radio monopoly.

====British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation====
The British Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (BMBC) was created on 12 April 1935 with a nominal capital of $500,000, formed on 21 July 1935 and awarded a broadcasting license by the British crown on 1 June 1936 as a radio network. The station was initially scheduled to start broadcasting in 1935, but was subsequently delayed to 1936 due to initial government uncertainties. The station broadcast from the hill on Thomson Road. ZHL made its first broadcast of Chinese music on 10 June 1936 as an experiment. The BMBC conducted auditions in November 1936. On 1 March 1937 at 6pm, its studios and transmitters at Caldecott Hill were officially opened by Governor of the Straits Settlements Shenton Thomas, aiming at a potential target audience of 10,000 listeners.

In a move to adjust its budget, BMBC cut the number of weekly hours in late June 1937, from the initial 34 3/4 hours to 28 3/4. The Sunday schedule was cut from seven hours to four: before the revision, the daytime period ran from 11am to 1:30pm and the evening period from 5:30pm to 10pm. This was cut to 11:30am to 1:30pm for the daytime period (reducing half an hour) and 6pm to 8pm for the evening period (cutting two and a half hours). On weekdays the schedule ran from 6pm to 10pm, simply cutting the last quarter hour on air (before then, the station closed at 10:15pm). On Saturdays, the afternoon period remained in the 12:45pm to 2pm slot, but the evening period, starting at 6pm, now ended at 9:35pm instead of 11:15pm. This also prompted ZHL to reduce the number of artists to those able to perform without paying fees. Juvenile sessions were dropped because the artists had paid more. The existing charter suggested that the daily schedule would last at least four hours, with extensions depending on listener feedback. Any potential expansion was hampered purely by lack of budget. The monthly income was of $3,500, $2,500 from the licence and $1,000 from the Municipality. There were hopes to increase the income due to the start of sponsored programmes. Plans for shortwave broadcasting had been outlined in July 1937, despite concerns over the quality of its reception. In its first trimester on air, the BMBC was operating at a loss, a cause of &quot;grave concern&quot; for the staff.

Work on the shortwave BMBC station started in October 1937, aiming at a March 1938 launch date. The station was to broadcast at a frequency of 31.48 meters daytime and 49.9 meters nighttime. The programming would be the same as the existing medium wave ZHL station.

In January 1938, it was announced that the BMBC would cease receiving its monthly $1,000 grant from the municipality effective the end of February. In the year ending February 28, 1938, the BMBC was operating at a net profit of $275.88; compared to the loss of $5,368.67 The number of listeners now stood at 4,213, up from the initial figure of 2,598 - even so, the figure was relatively lower than the planned target of 10,000 in the formal launch the previous year. Ahead of the start of the shortwave service, it was reported that it would be picked up by over 9,000 radio receivers in Malaya - combined with over 4,000 in Singapore, the number of potential listeners was going to increase threefold. The station started on 19 July 1938 under the callsign ZHP (the &quot;P&quot; stood for &quot;Progress&quot;) attracting an audience not just in Malaya, but also in Sarawak, Borneo and the Dutch Indies, especially in tin mines and rubber estates.

Thanks to the wider coverage range of ZHP, ZHL was able to broadcast more sporting events, namely horse races, tennis and the football, specifically the Malayan Cup. Before the change in policy, it was more likely for attendees to go to the matches.

The shortwave frequency moved in on 1 October 1938 from 30.96 meters to 48.58 meters, under the new callsign ZHO, at the request of the Posts and Telegraphs Department. The extant medium wave frequency (225 metres or 1333kc) remained unchanged.

In February 1939, the government started giving aid to the BMBC. The listener base was by then upgraded to 15,000 listeners: 5,000 in Singapore, a further 5,000 in the Federated Malay States, 2,000 in Penang, 1,000 in Johor and 350 in Malacca. Statistically, out of the 5,104 licence holders (number of receivers) in Singapore, 2,574 were Europeans and Eurasians, 2,023 were Chinese, 219 were Malays, 195 were Indians, 87 were Japanese and six were Siamese. The shortwave transmitter carrying ZHO upgraded its power in mid-1939, from 400 watts to 2 kilowatts. At the 1939 Annual Report, there were plans to create two separate services, an -hour European service and a -hour Asiatic one. Included in the proposal was the creation of a second medium wave transmitter for the two programmes to be delivered from the extant facilities. Subsequently, a second plan to increase the power of the shortwave transmitter was held in early 1940, this time increasing its coverage to reach out to the entirety of Malaya, Borneo, the Netherlands Indies and Siam. Much of the equipment used was already manufactured in Singapore.

====Malaya Broadcasting Corporation====
The corporation was taken over by the Straits Settlements government in 1940 as a part of the British Department of Information, subsequently nationalised and reorganised as the Malaya Broadcasting Corporation (MBC), the local counterpart to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). Additional French programming was added on 16 September 1940.

In order to counter German propaganda, a second shortwave transmitter was added on 29 September 1940, ZHP 3 (the existing transmitter was renamed ZHP 1). The station carried a special programme in German on Friday nights from 10pm to 10:30pm. The remainder of the line-up consisted of music and news, in Hindustani, Dutch, Tamil, Arabic and French. ZHL and ZHP 1 carried primarily content in English and Chinese dialects, with some Malay programming as well. By April 1941 ZHP 2 was activated. The station was merely a relayer of ZHL&#x27;s output, that was also heard on ZHP 1.

====Syonan Broadcasting Station====
During World War II, when the Japanese Imperial Army occupied Singapore from 1942 to 1945, the radio station on the island of Singapore was seized by the Japanese authorities and renamed Syonan Hoso Kyoku (&#x27;Light of the South&#x27; Broadcasting Corporation, 昭南放送局, known in English as the Syonan Broadcasting Station or SBS), the local counterpart to the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK). Broadcasts under the new administration started on 13 March 1942 and broadcast over three frequencies, one in medium wave for within Singapore, another to relay output from Tokyo and a shortwave frequency aimed at the time in Australia. After repairs, broadcasts officially started on 28 March. Programming was at the outset of occupation airing daily from 7pm to 10pm (later the closing time moved to 10:30pm) with an additional hour-long period from 10am to 11am for educational programming. Programming was still in the same mix of languages as before but content in Japanese was added.

In June 1942, the Syonan station broadcast Japanese language learning classes to students, installing sets in 87 schools.

During occupation, a confidential British Far Eastern Broadcasting Service (BFEBS) was carried out by the UK to its occupied territories, briefly having its offices at Caldecott Hill. The facilities were later used as a relay station for the BBC.

====Radio Singapore====
After the war, the British came back into power and reclaimed the radio station, with the station managed by the interim government – British Military Administration (BMA).

Two separate stations were introduced from 23 December 1945. The existing service was renamed Blue Network, carrying programming in English and Malay. The second service, the Red Network, carried content in Tamil, Hindustani and Chinese dialects. The Blue Network was carried on the 41,61,225 metre band and the Red Network, on the 41,61,300 metre band.

On 1 April 1946, Radio Malaya Singapore and the Federation of Malaya (RMSFOM; or Radio Malaya), a short- and mediumwave service, was established in Singapore. Radio news and information, as well as local entertainment, were aired on its stations in English and later Mandarin Chinese and Malay. In June 1947, the BBC initiated a one-year takeover plan of the BFEBS. The plan was culminated on 8 August 1948.

Changes to programming led to the Blue Network adding some Chinese content on from 1 January 1949. Both networks increased their airtime. This was due to requests from individual communities, who demanded more programmes for them. The Chinese output gained its own station on 1 January 1951, the Green Network.

Radio Malaya left the Cathay building on 4 November 1951 at closedown. The two networks increased their schedule again in January 1952.

On the basis of the Radio Malaya broadcasters that moved to Kuala Lumpur in 1958, Radio Singapura took over on 4 January 1959 as the radio service for Singapore, organised into a station each for English, Malay and Mandarin listeners, plus a blocktime slot for Tamil speakers. Shortwave broadcasts commenced on 14 February 1960, consisting of relays of extant Radio Singapore output. The frequency changed in 1961, with test transmissions in the new frequencies (7250, 6175, 6615 and 4280) were carried from mid-January. A new radio station, &quot;Siaran Istimewa&quot;, was announced in May 1961 as the nation&#x27;s first multilingual radio station signing on offially on 3 June, with programming in all 4 languages airing on the 990 kc (990 kHz) band. When Singapore joined Malaysia on 16 September 1963, Radio Singapura&#x27;s stations became part of Radio Malaysia and rebranded as &quot;Radio Malaysia (Singapura)&quot;.

From 2 March 1964, the Malay, Tamil and Mandarin language divisions increased their airtime. The number of radio news bulletins was increased from 29 to 42.

====Television broadcasting====
Shortly after Singapore reached self-government status on 3 June 1959, there were plans to obtain television transmission rights. This manifested the founding of Television Singapura on 4 April 1961.

&quot;Television Singapura&quot; aired test broadcasts on channel 5 from 21 January to 15 February 1963, ahead of its first official pilot broadcast on the evening of 15 February 1963. Minister for Culture S. Rajaratnam became the first person to appear on Singapore TV, announcing that &quot;Tonight might well mark the start of a social and cultural revolution in our lives.&quot; The first programme aired was a documentary, &quot;TV Looks at Singapore&quot;. The pilot service would broadcast for one hour and 40 minutes nightly; at the time, it was estimated that only one in 58 Singaporeans owned a television.

On 2 April 1963, Channel 5 was officially inaugurated by Yang di-Pertuan Negara Yusof Ishak; the service expanded to 7:15 to 11:00 p.m. nightly. By September, its broadcast day had been lengthened to begin at 6:30 p.m. Initially, Channel 5 carried programmes in all four of Singapore&#x27;s official languages. On 31 August, Channel 8 started trial broadcasts, before starting its regular service on 23 November 1963.

In January 1964, Television Singapura became the state branch of the new Televisyen Malaysia from Kuala Lumpur and was subsequently rebranded as sister channel &quot;Television Malaysia (Singapura)&quot;. During its time as part of Malaysia, Singapore, like its three other partners–Sabah, Sarawak and Malaya—had its own radio network, but Singapore was the only state to have its own television network. The state&#x27;s radio and television broadcast right was included as an annex in the Malaysia Agreement which garnered autonomy in this area, among others.

Television advertising started on 15 January 1964.

===1965–1980: Radio Television Singapore===
After the separation of Singapore from the Malaysian federation, its radio and television outlets became part of Radio Television Singapore (RTS), a division of the Ministry of Culture. This led to expansions of the network, including a move to the new $3.6 million Television Centre at Caldecott Hill on 27 August 1966.

Within days of independence, TV Singapura&#x27;s main studio was damaged by a fire on the afternoon of 16 August 1965; this did not affect Radio Singapore&#x27;s broadcasts.

An FM service was announced in January 1967, set to start in June or July of that year, where the four existing stations would be relayed. The experimental FM service started testing in May 1967 and upgraded to a pilot service on 23 June, with FM being ideal for Singapore&#x27;s size. The service went regular on 15 July, broadcasting over five frequencies: 94.2 (Malay), 95.8 and 96.8 (Chinese), 96.8 (Tamil) and 92.4 (English). Test broadcasts of the FM Stereo service started on 18 July 1969 using the 92.4 frequency. New radio studios were built in 1972, starting with the addition of the Radio House, then in 1975 by a new complex costing $4.2 million.

From 30 March 1973, Channel 5 began focusing on English and Malay-language programmes, while Channel 8 would focus on Chinese- and Tamil-language programmes. On 24 October 1973, RTS aired a 40-minute documentary titled &quot;Addiction: Three Experiences&quot;, chronicling the lives of three drug addicts. The documentary was given a Special Commendation by the Asia-Pacific Broadcasting Union in 1974.

In January 1974, RTS bought two colour television transmitters worth $700,000. The old transmitters installed in 1966 would remain as standby equipment. On 2 May 1974, the two channels conducted colour test broadcasts of &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, followed in July by its first live colour broadcast—the 1974 FIFA World Cup final. About 2,000 colour television sets were sold in Singapore three days before the match. On 9 August, that year&#x27;s Singapore National Day Parade became the first live broadcast to be produced by RTS in colour. The second phase of the pilot colour service began on 11 November 1974, with newsreels being converted to colour, but it still had to air monochrome newsreels because some of the footage available was still in black and white. The number of weekly hours given to colour programming increased from two to four on weekdays and four to six on weekends.

In honour of the impending launch of full-time colour broadcasts, RTS held a contest to design a new logo. After 662 submissions, the winning design by Loh Hong Liat and Lawrence Wong Heng Kwok was unveiled in August 1975. Lok designed the letters &quot;R and T&quot; which represent recording, while Wong designed the letter &quot;S&quot;. Full-time colour broadcasts began on 1 November 1977.

RTS radio stations began extending broadcasting hours of programmes in stereo on 3 April 1978, adding technical costs to the broadcaster.

In accordance with the 1975 Geneva Frequency Plan, the RTS radio stations moved their frequencies effective 23 November 1978:
*English Service: 630 kHz 
*Chinese Service: 680 kHz → 675 kHz
*Multilanguage Service: 790 kHz → 792 kHz
*Malay Service: 990 kHz
*Tamil Service: 1370 kHz → 1368 kHz
Since their frequencies were already spaced in the multiples of 9 kHz before the Geneva Frequency Plan, the English and Malay stations had their frequencies unchanged.

===1980–1994: Singapore Broadcasting Corporation===
The ability for RTS to grow was hampered by administrative and budgetary constraints, leading to frequent turnover in staff, and a reliance on imported programmes rather than domestic productions. In September 1979, an act was proposed in the Parliament of Singapore to separate RTS from the Ministry of Culture, and replace it with a new statutory body known as the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC). The SBC was envisioned as an autonomous, state-owned enterprise akin to Singapore Airlines and comparable to the BBC in the United Kingdom and its neighbours&#x27; RTM and TVRI. The SBC Act was approved in parliament on 12 January 1980.

A competition for a new SBC logo was initiated in January 1980. The characteristics of the new brand were to be &quot;simple and attractive&quot;, while not having more than three colours, including the background. The winner would receive a cash prize worth $5,000.

The government officially dissolved RTS on 31 January 1980 and transferred its assets to the SBC. The rebrand was not ceremonious. Ahead of closedown, an announcement was made telling viewers of the rename. The following morning, at 6 a.m., SBC formally started with no preamble, with the only visible changes being a new interim wordmark logo, updated startup and closedown sequences, and a new news intro. The new logo competition finished on 16 February. A preliminary selection was determined by five judges on 22 February. At first the logo was set to be introduced in March. A total of 4,042 entries were received. The new logo was unveiled to the public on 18 May 1980. The winner was Laurence Wong Heng Kwok—who had previously co-designed the RTS logo.

Its programming had not changed much following the relaunch, to the point that some viewers mockingly said that &quot;SBC&quot; stood for &quot;Same Boring Channel&quot;, while some confusing it for the Singapore Bus Service (SBS) and others pejoratively nicknaming it &quot;si bei cham&quot; which meant &quot;damn terrible&quot; in Hokkien. SBC introduced &quot;weather girls&quot; on 1 May 1980 for its English news broadcasts, before expanding to other languages in 1981. The format ended in March 1982 because it wanted the weather report to be the same as the other languages and the &quot;weather report within the news bulletin was adequate&quot;. From June 1980, SBC would start sponsoring the clock before the news on its television channels, which it anticipated could bring in an additional S$1 million in revenue. SBC began adapting a new format for its television news broadcasts in August 1980. The new format would feature two newscasters and more on-location reporting.

SBC introduced political party broadcasts for the 1980 general election campaign on 17 December 1980, with the People&#x27;s Action Party getting 12 minutes of broadcast, the United Front and the Workers&#x27; Party three minutes each and United People&#x27;s Front three and a half minutes. The shortest available broadcasts were for parties with six candidates with two and a half minutes. The participating parties were required to send five copies of their manifestos to SBC. A final broadcast was held on 22 December.

The English-language current affairs programme &quot;Friday Background&quot; debuted in March 1981. In April 1981, to maximise SBC&#x27;s resources in improving its sports presentation, the Malay and Chinese versions of the corporation&#x27;s sports programme &quot;Sports Parade&quot; were cancelled; the programme now only airs in English.

In May 1981, on the day President Benjamin Sheares was pronounced dead, SBC&#x27;s television channels cancelled their regular programming and replaced them with &quot;solemn music and serious documentaries&quot;. The next day, the corporation aired two episodes of &quot;Destiny&quot; and an episode of &quot;Sandiwara&quot;, which SBC thinks were too serious to be aired. SBC also decided not to repeat the state funeral of Sheares because it would &quot;lend levity to a sad occasion&quot;.

On 1 January 1982, SBC renamed its radio stations:
*Radio 1 (English; present-day Gold 905)
*Radio 2 (Malay; present-day Warna 942)
*Radio 3 (Chinese; present-day Capital 958)
*Radio 4 (Tamil 6am to 9pm and Chinese 9pm to midnight; present-day Oli 968)
*Radio 5 (Classical Music, the former FM Stereo; present-day Symphony 924)
The revamp was the result of a 1978 survey where listeners preferred entertainment programming over talk.

On 30 March 1982, SBC 5 began airing the children&#x27;s storytelling programme &quot;Share A Story,&quot; with the Tuesday&#x27;s broadcast aimed at 3 to 5-year-old children and the Thursday&#x27;s broadcast aimed at 6 to 9-year-old children. In 1982, commercial breaks during prime time on SBC 5 were four minutes long with six to nine advertisements squeezed in, while SBC 8&#x27;s were eight to ten minutes. On 1 February 1983, SBC&#x27;s television news broadcasts received a new studio set, described as &quot;duck-egg blue&quot; and &quot;three-dimensional&quot;. A special semi-circular table was created for the set. The previous set was &quot;pink&quot; in colour. The new set was inspired from news and current affairs programmes in the United States. Other changes include each newscaster reading different stories and more graphics and illustrations.

The next day, SBC launched &quot;Newswatch&quot;, a children&#x27;s news programme aimed at 10 to 14-year-old children It would air three times a week for 10 minutes; every Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 7:20 pm. The idea for &quot;Newswatch&quot; was suggested by the-then Cultural Minister in 1980 and planning for its creation started the following year, involving the studying of similar news programmes such as &quot;John Craven&#x27;s Newsround&quot; and &quot;Video Despatch&quot;. The development for Newswatch was headed by SBC news executive Myrna Thomas and is assisted by William Earl of Television New Zealand. The initial presenters of &quot;Newswatch&quot; were Woon Liew and Shantini Sundram. Toh Seng Ling, who presented Newswatch in 1990, would later become the newscaster for &quot;News 5 Tonight&quot; in April 2001.

SBC Radio 1 and SBC Radio 3 started carrying hourly news bulletins on 1 May 1983.

On 31 January 1984, SBC launched Channel 12, a new television service devoted to cultural programming. In connection to its launch, the English and Mandarin news bulletins had their length extended to 30 minutes the following day. The move was taken considering mass interest in Cantonese productions in Malaysia, as well as the limited number of Mandarin speakers in the country. Musical programmes were also included in the agreement, and would also be distributed to Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan, Europe and North America. On 30 July, SBC started dubbing its series to Cantonese for the video market in Malaysia, in a contract with Unity Records that was valid from 1 September.

SBC began on-camera coverage of Parliament proceedings in 1985. &quot;Today in Parliament&quot; began on 1 March 1985 with a one-hour long broadcast. Studio 6, a studio specially made for local programmes especially dramas, was completed in early 1985.

Advertisements on SBC in 1986 were limited to four for a half-hour programme and eight for an hour-hong programme. In May 1986, SBC introduced &quot;subtitle ads&quot;, advertisements appearing as a single-line sentence or one letter at a time and appear for 10 seconds. This format is used to compensate for the advertisement limit imposed by the corporation. However, they only appear on programmes that do not have translation subtitles. While this advertisement format enabled more companies to advertise on television due to its cheaper rates, it has caused irritation among viewers.

On 3 August 1987, by request from listeners overseas, SBC began adding financial news bulletins from Radio 5 on the shortwave versions of Radio 1 and 3, while FM and mediumwave listeners can tune in to regular programming during the bulletin. In August 1988, SBC news broadcasts adopted a new &quot;upbeat and viewer-friendly&quot; look. The backdrop is now that of the skyline of Singapore. It generated positive response from viewers.

On 1 January 1989, SBC launched two new radio stations: Perfect 10 (airing English contemporary hits for youth) and YES (airing Mandarin music).

SBC stopped airing Late News bulletins on Channel 12 in English and Channel 8 in Mandarin on 2 January 1989 due to fewer news developments happening between the main news and the late news bulletins.

Two further radio services were announced in December 1989: 93.3 (airing Mandarin music) and a yet-unnamed MOR service (which would later become Class 95). The former was scheduled to launch on 1 January 1990, similar to Perfect 10 the year before. The existing numbered radio services had some changes: broadcasting hours on Radios 2 and 4 (Malay and Tamil) were extended to 2 a.m. in June 1989, along with Radio 3 (Chinese) but only on Fridays, Saturdays and the eve of public holidays, and Mandarin language broadcasts were phased out from Radio 5. The MOR service, Class 95, started on 1 April 1990. &quot;Ria&quot; (airing popular Malay music) started later.

93.3 at its beginning was also known as Radio 6. The station would also have the same broadcasting hours as almost all of SBC&#x27;s radio stations.

SBC announced on 21 February 1990 that it would begin NICAM stereo broadcasts by August that year, spending $3.5 million in the installation of the systems. Channel 5 began stereo broadcasting on 8 August 1990, the first programme in the new format being &quot;Countdown to National Day 90&quot;. With the start of stereo broadcasts, SBC invested $5 million to upgrade its production facilities for the new technology. Channel 12 followed in December. Additionally, SBC had further ambitious projects throughout the 90s, costing a grand total of $700 million: a new studio complex, upgraded equipment and transmission facilities and the development of new programmes and staff. To minimize congestion from Caldecott Hill, a second facility was to be opened tentatively from Bukit Batok, the location of the television transmitter.

By the early 90s, SBC&#x27;s Mandarin drama series were already being exported to places such as China and Canada.

Up until 1991, broadcasts of the television channels started and ended with multilingual greetings (Mandarin, Malay, Tamil, English), in what was known as the &quot;good-night girls&quot;. The start-up and closedown sequence, including the anthem, was known in Singaporean terminology as a &quot;presso&quot;. From then on, SBC replaced the videos, which changed annually, by a CGI animation created by Ong Lay Hong, that was to be used in both start-ups and closedowns. The new video bagged a bronze medal at the Fuji Network System Title Fair in June 1991, out of more than thirty entries from Asia. Such animation conveyed &quot;human warmth&quot; by including footage from SBC programmes, and the music was arranged to match the multi-ethnic nature of Singapore, incorporating drum beats, sitars and violins.

Four of the five numbered SBC radio stations got their names changed over the course of several months from late 1991 to early 1992. Radio 2 was renamed Warna; Radio 3, The City Channel; Radio 4, Olikkalanjiam and Radio 5, Symphony. Radio 1 maintained its name since the station was &quot;well established as a leader&quot;.

SBC began accepting programmes from production houses in 1992. One of the first programmes commissioned was Kalau Dapur Tak Berasap from Communications 2000. SBC ended live broadcasts of parliament proceedings in June 1992; earlier the corporation trialed broadcasts of the Budget debate. SBC&#x27;s highlights of parliament coverage continued but only as a 15-minute broadcast.

In January 1993, SBC added 20 hours a week of broadcasting hours for its television channels. As a result, each channel refined its identity SBC 5 will only air English and Malay shows, SBC 8 with Mandarin and Tamil and SBC 12 with &quot;serious fare&quot; and sports. Some programmes were reshuffled, while newer programme genres, including talk shows and classic TV in the form of sitcom reruns were introduced. The corporation also introduced block programming; originally began in 1992 with the Saturday morning cartoon slot &quot;Nine to Twelve&quot;.

An educational programming block known as CDIS (Curriculum Development Institute of Singapore) began airing on Channel 12 on 4 January 1993 produced by the Ministry of Education for SBC similar to Malaysia&#x27;s TV Pendidikan and the then Indonesian TPI blocktime service on TVRI. On 1 February of that year, SBC celebrated its 30 years of television broadcasting. Before 7 June 1993 Channel 8 continued to sign-on as late as 5:50pm, On that day itself, Channel 8 expanded its airtime, now broadcasting from 3:00 p.m. on weekdays and at 9:00 a.m on Saturdays (3:00 p.m before the increase). In November that year, SBC announced a satellite television network named Singapore International Television (SITV), to start on 1 January 1994. The service was to be operated by the Singapore International Foundation (SIF) with the aim of promoting the Singaporean way of life abroad, and was to broadcast over a rented transponder in the Palapa satellite from 10:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. nightly.

By 1993, SBC had ambitions to produce more local content and broadcasting hours on channels 5 and 12, with Malay content scheduled to move to Channel 12. Channel 8 would stick to the existing formula of Mandarin and Tamil. SBC made its first attempt at producing an English drama by producing the made-for-TV movie &quot;Time Tomorrow&quot;, which aired on 9 March 1993.

In 1993, SBC launched a home shopping programme called &quot;Sell-a-Vision&quot; (provided by Quantum International and represented locally by LeisureMart Pte Ltd) which broadcast twice daily for two hours a day on its television channels and was expected to run until May 1994. However, &quot;The Straits Times&quot; writer Cherian George mentioned that &quot;Sell-a-Vision&quot; was not part of SBC&#x27;s twelve minutes of advertising per hour rule. It would also expand to SBC 8 in October 1994.

On 1 January 1994, Channel 5 moved its remaining Malay programming to Channel 12, and re-launched as an English-language channel. On the same day, AM radio broadcasts were cut without prior warning.

Radio Singapore International (RSI) was launched on 1 February 1994 as the official radio international broadcasting company in Singapore, airing news and current affairs, lifestyle, and music programming in English, Malay, Mandarin and Indonesian.

SBC began preparing for 24 hour broadcasts for its information-based radio stations in late 1993. 93.3 started 24 hour broadcasts on 1 May 1994; Radio One on 16 May 1994; Class 95 in June and City Sounds 95.8 in October (later moved to December). Love 97.2 launched on 23 September 1994, playing sentimental Mandarin pop music.

===1994–1999: Privatisation===
On 18 December 1991, the Minister of Information and the Arts George Yeo announced that the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation was to be privatised within a period of two years. Its three television channels would be placed under the control of &quot;two or three companies&quot; and the radio stations spun off to a separate company. There were already talks with foreign investors from Hong Kong and the United States regarding the possibility of allowing potential stakes in the new companies. The decision was delayed in March 1993 from year-end 1993 to year-end 1994 to allow for greater competition in the region and abroad. SBC held a committee for the names of the new corporations. One peculiar suggestion came from lettering artist Rathna Kumari, who suggested that the facilities service was to be called &quot;The Backbone&quot;, the radio network &quot;Silksound&quot; and the company in charge of channels 5 and 8 &quot;FutureVision&quot;.

In September 1993, SBC announced that Malay programming would be moved to SBC 12 and expanded, and SBC 5 would become an English-language channel. On 1 January 1994, SBC 5 relaunched with its new English-language format as Channel 5. Singapore International Television launched the same day, broadcasting an hour of programming for international audiences nightly via satellite; the channel opened with a special edition of Channel 5&#x27;s &quot;Inside Asia&quot; followed by a relay of its 10:30 p.m. news. The first half hour was to be devoted to current affairs and lifestyle programming.

Radio Singapore International (RSI) was launched on 1 February 1994 as the official international radio broadcasting company in Singapore, airing news and current affairs, lifestyle, and music programming in English, Malay, Mandarin and Indonesian. 93.3 started 24 hour broadcasts on 1 May 1994, followed by Radio One on 16 May 1994, Class 95 in June, and City Sounds 95.8 in December. Love 97.2 launched on 23 September 1994, playing sentimental Mandarin pop music.

On 1 October 1994, SBC was formally privatised into the new holding company Singapore International Media (SIM), with four business units: Television Corporation of Singapore (TCS, which controlled Channel 5 and 8), Radio Corporation of Singapore (RCS), Singapore Television Twelve (STV12, which controlled Channel 12) and SIM Communications (SIMCOM). The Singapore Broadcasting Authority allocated $40 million per annum of money to TV12 to provide 45 out of the 60 hours a week of public service broadcasting, with 19 hours for arts, sports and culture programming, 15 for Malay programming and 11 for Indian programming. The rest of the hours was funded by TV12.

In early 1995, TCS scrapped the duty officers, who were responsible to gauge feedback from viewers. The programme advisory committee which were made up of members of the public and were useful for internal check were also scrapped. TV12 moved to the Bestway building sometime in July 1995.

On 1 September 1995, Channel 8 expanded into a 24-hour network focusing exclusively on Mandarin-language programmes, while its Tamil programming was assumed by Prime 12—a relaunch of Channel 12 which focused on multilingual programming. TV12 also launched a UHF spin-off channel known as Premiere 12, which featured arts, culture, documentaries, children&#x27;s, and sports programmes.

In October 1995, TV12 was originally asked by the Singapore Broadcasting Authority to launch another classical music station in response to changes in RCS&#x27; 92.4, but later turned down due to the lack of funding from the authorities.

TCS viewed Channel 5 and Premiere 12 as practising &quot;complementary programming&quot; as much as possible, as Channel 5 was positioned as a mass appeal channel while TV12 catered to the special interest audience, with the latter promising to not appeal to the lowest common denominator. However, the separation of TCS and TV12 had caused the channels of both companies competing each other with similar programming at the same time slot, causing viewers to have less choice. Local programming production on TV12, especially Prime 12, is 60% coming from production houses while 40% comes from TV12 itself, using personnel from Vision Production.

On the occasion of TCS&#x27; third anniversary, its executive Daniel Yun said that its two channels, Channel 5 and Channel 8 will become more Singaporean with increasing local productions and its viewers become increasingly bilingual. Yun pointed out that they are not just channels for the &quot;English-educated yuppie&quot; and &quot;the HDB heartlander&quot; respectively.

In March 1998, George Yeo announced at the Parliament that RCS would launch three new radio stations later in the year NewsRadio 93.8, Inter FM and an unnamed financial radio station. On 1 March 1999, TCS launched Channel NewsAsia (CNA), a local news channel. TCS launched its own film production studio Raintree Pictures on 1 August 1998.

===1999–2015: Media Corporation of Singapore===

On 15 June 1999, the Singapore International Media group of companies restructured as the Media Corporation of Singapore (MediaCorp). The new name was created to avoid confusion with the Singapore Institute of Management. There were unfounded rumours of a merger between TCS and STV12, which were denied by Richard Tan. MediaCorp later announced the creation of new strategic business units in July:
*TV Channel Management (channels 5 and 8, upcoming sports channel)
*Public Broadcasting (Singapore Television Twelve, namely Prime 12 and Premiere 12)
*Radio (12 stations owned by the Radio Corporation of Singapore)
*TV/Film Production and Distribution (programme production and distribution units of TCS, STV12 and subsidiary companies)
*News and Current Affairs (Channel NewsAsia)
*Print Media (Caldecott Publishing)
*Multimedia (multimedia units of all subsidiaries).

On 30 January 2000, MediaCorp launched three new channels. Prime 12 and Premiere 12 were relaunched as Suria and Central respectively; Suria would be a Malay-language channel, while Central would be divided into three dayparted blocks under the brands &quot;Kids Central&quot; (children&#x27;s programming), &quot;Vasantham Central&quot; (Tamil-language programming), and &quot;Arts Central&quot;. Sportscity, a sports channel, was also launched the same day. In September 2000, CNA launched an international feed, intending to expand the service into a pan-Asian network. On 10 November, &quot;Today&quot; was launched as a free newspaper to compete with Singapore Press Holdings&#x27; &quot;Streats&quot;. The newspaper was owned by MediaCorp, Singtel, and SMRT, with DelGro pulling out two days earlier.

Ernest Wong was appointed CEO of MediaCorp on 1 October 2000. He had worked with the corporation since 1994, when he joined the Audit Committee of what would become Singapore International Media. Among his accolades in the group were the start of its news channel and its international expansion, as well as the investment in the internet and theatrical businesses. At the time, the government planned to list MediaCorp on the stock market by the end of 2000 or the start of 2001.

On 12 February 2001, MediaCorp completed its establishment of a new senior management team, with Wong serving as CEO of the holding company (Media Corporation of Singapore Pte Ltd) and MediaCorp TV, Farrell Meisel as chief operating officer (COO) of MediaCorp, Kenneth Tan as COO of MediaCorp TV, Woon Tai Ho as COO of MediaCorp TV12, and Chua Foo Yong MediaCorp as COO of MediaCorp Radio.

MediaCorp&#x27;s monopoly on free-to-air television was broken in May 2001, when the Singapore government granted new free-to-air licenses to SPH MediaWorks, a subsidiary of publisher Singapore Press Holdings. The company launched two channels in English and Chinese respectively, TVWorks (later Channel i) and Channel U. In late-2004, citing financial issues, SPH announced an agreement to merge its television business with that of Mediacorp; SPH would transfer Channel i and U to MediaCorp, take a 20% stake in MediaCorp TV, and a 40% stake in &quot;Today&quot;, while discontinuing its competing &quot;Streats&quot;.

Channel i was shut down on 1 January 2005 as it was not considered to be economically viable, while Channel U continued as a complementary service to Channel 8. Alongside the takeover, Channel 8 amended its Chinese name from &quot;Dì bā bō dào (&quot;) to &quot;Bā píndào&quot; () to match the notation that had been used by Channel U (); MediaCorp explained that the change was meant to reflect the integration of SPH and its ideas into the company.

On 21 October 2004, Mediacorp hosted the first Singapore Radio Awards with nominations only open to its radio stations. In July 2005, Mediacorp renewed a transmission agreement with the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) to extend the broadcast of the BBC World Service Radio, which has been aired in Singapore since 1976. In May 2007, the company hired an experienced senior management staff team to help steer the company to strengthening position in the Asian region. On 11 November 2007, Mediacorp launched HD5, the first high definition television channel in Singapore.

In 2007, in effort to establish a new generation of actresses, MediaCorp identified and grouped the seven most promising upcoming actresses from Singapore in the 2000s, namely Jesseca Liu, Jeanette Aw, Rui En, Fiona Xie, Joanne Peh, Felicia Chin and Dawn Yeoh, then all in their twenties, and referred to them collectively as &quot;Seven Princesses of MediaCorp&quot; (新传媒七公主). A similar grouping of its male artistes for similar reasons was carried out in 2014, grouping eight promising upcoming Mediacorp actors from Singapore in the 2010s, namely Zhang Zhenhuan, Romeo Tan, Desmond Tan, Jeffrey Xu, Xu Bin, Ian Fang, Aloysius Pang and Shane Pow, and were collectively known as the &quot;8 Dukes of Caldecott Hill&quot;.

All Mediacorp radio stations converted to 24/7 broadcasting from 1 January 2008. At the time, the only stations that still closed down were Capital 95.8, Ria 89.7, Symphony 92.4, 938LIVE and 96.3 The International Channel (renamed XFM later in 2008). In February, Mediacorp acquires 20% stake in Chinese outdoor advertising firm, Dahe Media, awhile at the same time, the company entered a strategic investment partnership with Vietnamese company, the International Media Corporation (IMC) in which they will &quot;look forward to lending [its] expertise in the areas of programming, branding, promotion, management and airtime sales&quot;.

In March 2008, it was announced that Central would be split into two separate channels, with Vasantham Central being spun-off as a full-time channel serving the Tamil community, and children&#x27;s and arts programming moving to a new channel. The changes took effect in 19 October of that year, with the launch of the new Vasantham and Okto channels. In August 2008, MediaCorp also launched MOBTV, an online television service.

Owing to the diminished effectiveness of a shortwave radio service over time with changing technology and media consumption habits, RSI was dissolved on 31 October 2008.

In January 2009, Mediacorp established its Interactive Media Division where its online and mobile properties will be consolidated into a new division. In March, Mediacorp was among 6 ASEAN broadcasting companies including Media Prima, Media Nusantara Citra (MNC) and ABS-CBN Corporation jointly to form a regional broadcasting alliance, Smart Alliance to carry out an alliance to cooperate in three areas—content, sales and marketing, and technology—and take advantage of economies of scale and combined markets that the region can offer. In December, the company began to phased out its cost-cutting measures and restoring full pay for its staffs.

In 2009, Mediacorp was appointed as the media partner for the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai with Channel NewsAsia providing news coverage in a year-long partnership. The appointment makes the company became the first global media partner of the exhibition. Mediacorp had extended its partnership with the Japanese public broadcaster, NHK for another 3 years, until 2012, during The Asian Pitch competition. In August 2009, Mediacorp Studios started a block on the Philippine network TV5, after doing so in Malaysia. In March 2010, the company signed a licensing deal with Global Yellow Pages in which the deal allows Mediacorp reproduced or using the latter&#x27;s data on its online classified advertising platform Mocca on a &quot;revenue-sharing arrangement&quot;.

In March 2011, Mediacorp announced an &quot;organisational alignment and movements&quot; in its sales business which took effect on 1 April. On 12 August, Mediacorp selected DP Architects and Maki and Associates as the architects of its new campus, which to be located at Mediapolis@one-north.

In 2012, the company partnered with French mobile advertising firm Sofialys &quot;to implement a new multi-platform advertising serving solution&quot;. In August 2013, Mediacorp consolidated its sole Malay channel, Suria and its two Malay radio stations, Warna 942 and Ria 897 into a new division, known as the Malay Broadcast Division.

In April 2015, Mediacorp retrenched its 33 staffs as part of its corporate restructuring exercise. In June, Mediacorp set up its Digital Group to overseen products and services for online consumers and marketers.

===2015–present: New headquarters and transition to digital===

On 8 December 2015, Mediacorp officially opened a new headquarters at one-north&#x27;s Mediapolis development. The 12-storey complex was designed by DP Architects and Maki and Associates and features a &quot;fenceless&quot; design with four studios, a 1,500-seat &quot;broadcast-ready&quot; theatre, and an integrated multi-platform newsroom. The company expected to complete the migration from its previous Caldecott Hill facilities by July 2016. Alongside the new headquarters, Mediacorp also unveiled a new logo, which was designed to reflect the broadcaster&#x27;s &quot;vibrancy&quot; and &quot;multiplicity&quot;, acting as an &quot;a window to the world and a reflection of life&quot;.

In April 2017, Mediacorp began to phase out print publication of &quot;Today&quot; by discontinuing its weekend editions. The weekday editions were then discontinued in September 2017, leaving &quot;Today&quot; as a digital publication. SPH would concurrently divest its stakes in Mediacorp for S$18 million. In September 2018, magazines &quot;8 Days&quot; and &quot;i-Weekly&quot; ceased print publications and went solely on their digital platforms. &quot;i-Weekly&quot; would later merge with &quot;Channel 8 News&quot; to form &quot;8world&quot; for Chinese news, entertainment and lifestyle contents.

Analogue broadcasting of Mediacorp channels ended at midnight on 2 January 2019, transitioning exclusively to digital television.

On 1 May 2019, Okto was discontinued as a standalone channel, with its children&#x27;s programming becoming a daytime block on Channel 5 under the &quot;Okto on 5&quot; branding. Okto&#x27;s sports programming was moved primarily to other Mediacorp outlets. Channel 8 similarly rebranded its existing children&#x27;s block as &quot;Okto尽在8&quot; (lit. &quot;Okto on 8&quot;)

On 30 January 2020, Mediacorp rebranded its digital media platforms Toggle, MeRadio and MeClub as meWatch, meListen and meRewards respectively. The rebranding came as part of the broadcaster&#x27;s &quot;Made for You&quot; initiative to build multi-platform services &quot;designed around consumers&#x27; preferences and consumption habits&quot;.

The company partnered with technology company, Amobee on 24 February 2021 to launched Mediacorp AdDirect, a self-service advertising solution platform which &quot;provides an easy, efficient and effective way for businesses to reach their target customers&quot;.

In July 2022, Mediacorp collaborated with Nanyang Polytechnic to set up a new centre for omnichannel marketing to aid small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which intended to &quot;provide training to SMEs&quot; and &quot;support them in planning, creating, and driving omnichannel marketing campaigns&quot;. The company also partnered with World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in November to produce science-based edutainment content for Okto in order to &quot;build a factually accurate source of engaging edutainment for kids&quot;.

In December 2022, the company entered partnership with YouTube, The Pinkfong Company and Taiwan Creative Content Agency (TAICCA) to produce and acquire video content.

On 16 January 2023, Mediacorp announced a rebranding of nearly all of its properties, which officially took effect on 1 February. The properties adopted a unified branding scheme based around flat design, with logos prefixed by an encircled Mediacorp insignia, and branding elements also incorporating a chevron formed from the top of the insignia. The company signed a deal with global technology research company, Ecosystm in May 2023 to engage with commercial and content collaborations. The deal combined Ecosystm&#x27;s &quot;research and thought leadership&quot; with Mediacorp&#x27;s &quot;creative capabilities and wide audience reach&quot;.

In December 2023, Mediacorp signed an agreement with Taiwanese production company Mission International for content development at the Asia TV Forum and Market (ATF). Both companies also will co-develop scripts ranging from different genres.

On 2 December 2024, Mediacorp began leasing an ABS-CBN Corporation-owned property, ABS-CBN Soundstage at the Horizon IT Park, San Jose del Monte, Bulacan, Philippines, to increase its global footprint.

==Controversies==

===1982 misinformation over Zainal Abidin===
At 6:54am on 6 October 1982, SBC Radio 2 claimed that Malaysian squash champion Zainal Abidin died in a car accident. Said announcement turned out to be a voice test conducted by a newsreader ahead of the 7am bulletin. In the wake of the voice test, Zainal received calls regarding his status. SBC subsequently apologised to Zainal. Azmi Mahmud, who did the voice test, was sacked on 22 January 1983, in the fallout of the incident. To prevent further mishaps, SBC tightened its controls on its news procedures.

===Copyright infringement with RecordTV===
In 2007, cloud software DVR service RecordTV (now InstantTV) filed a lawsuit against Mediacorp for copyright infringement which the latter claimed as &quot;groundless threats&quot;. This comes after the company sent two &quot;cease and desist&quot; letters to RecordTV which &quot;stated the consequences&quot; of alleged copyright violations, which led Mediacorp counter-sued against RecordTV. In December 2009, Mediacorp won the case against RecordTV, in which the Singapore High Court found that RecordTV had infringed copyright laws by allowing users to record programmes shown on three Mediacorp-owned channels.

===2017 &quot;OK Chope!&quot; controversy===
On 29 March 2017, an edition of the Channel 5 comedy panel game show &quot;OK Chope!&quot; featured the following question:
Najib slams ____ for threatening Malaysia&#x27;s progress.
of which the answer was &quot;fake news&quot;. The panelists while trying to find an answer to fill the blank, referred to &quot;kissing Malaysian officers&quot; and the live-action version of &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, whose release was postponed in Malaysia due to the inclusion of a minor gay character. The segment went viral on social media and prompted anger from Malaysian netizens. The Malaysian Artistes Association and the Selangor UMNO Youth both demanded that Vernetta Lopez should apologise for insulting and ridiculing Najib or would face a ban from Malaysian TV shows. Mediacorp issued an apology on 5 April 2017 and removed the episode from Toggle.

<text>The Rutshire Chronicles is a series of romantic novels by Dame Jilly Cooper. The stories tell tales of mainly British upper-class families, as well as the show-jumping and polo crowd, in numerous different sexually charged scenarios, often laced with adultery, illegitimate children, scandal, and sometimes death. They are linked by several recurring characters, chiefly Rupert Campbell-Black, and are set in the fictional English county of Rutshire.

Some of these characters, namely Campbell-Black and numerous characters associated with him, also occur in Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;Pandora&quot;, although it is not part of the series. The Campbell-Blacks, Lloyd-Foxes, France-Lynches, and other families from the Rutshire Chronicles also appear in &quot;Wicked!&quot; (2006). The tales are set in chronological order; however, they are readable as stand-alone novels.

In more recent years, her Rutshire Chronicles have come under fire for dated and problematic portrayals of race, homosexuality, gender roles and sexual consent.

Cooper&#x27;s recent works received a variety of responses from critics, with &quot;The Guardian&quot; praising &quot;her near-magical ability to conjure up a world and populate it with people for whom you feel a deep affection&quot; and &quot;The Express&quot; calling &quot;Jump!&quot; &quot;one of her most captivating novels yet.&quot;

<doc id="928652" wikidata="Q2917928" url="?curid=928652" title="Licking">
<text>Licking is the action of passing the tongue over a surface, typically either to deposit saliva onto the surface, or to collect liquid, food or minerals onto the tongue for ingestion, or to communicate with other animals. Many animals both groom themselves, eat or drink by licking.

==In animals==
Grooming: Animals commonly clean themselves through licking. In mammals, licking helps keep the fur clean and untangled. The tongues of many mammals have a rough upper surface that acts like a brush when the animal licks its fur. Certain reptiles, such as geckos, clean their eyes by licking them, due to them not having eye lids.

Mammals typically lick their offspring clean immediately after birth; in many species this is necessary to free the newborn from the amniotic sac. The licking not only cleans and dries the offspring&#x27;s fur, but also stimulates its breathing and digestive processes. Canids also stimulate their pups to urinate by licking their preputial gland secretions.

Food and water acquisition: Hummingbirds are often said to &quot;sip&quot; nectar, but in fact they up nectar on their long tongues. Their tongues have fringed edges, which help both in nectar-eating and in catching tiny insects. Mother hummingbirds also lick their chicks after a rainstorm to dry them by licking water droplets from the coats of the chicks to avoid them chilling. Many animals drink by licking. While young mammals drink milk from their mothers&#x27; teats by sucking, the typical method of drinking for adult mammals involves dipping the tongue repeatedly into water and using it to scoop water into the mouth. This method of drinking relies in part on the water adhering to the surface of the tongue and in part on muscular control of the tongue to form it into a spoonlike shape. Cattle, horses and other animals lick rocks, salt licks or other objects to obtain mineral nutrients.

Gustation: Animals also use their tongues to enhance their sense of smell. By licking a surface or extending the tongue beyond the mouth, molecules are transferred via the tongue to the olfactory receptors in the nose and in some animals, to the vomeronasal organ. In some mammals, the tongue is used to &quot;lick&quot; the air during the flehmen response to assist transfer of pheremones. Similarly, snakes use smell to track their prey. They smell by using their forked tongues to collect airborne particles, then passing them to the vomeronasal organ. They keep their tongues constantly in motion, sampling particles from the air, ground, and water, analyzing the chemicals found, and determining the presence of prey or predators in the local environment. 

Communication: Dogs and cats use licking both to clean and to show affection among themselves or to humans, typically licking their faces. Many animals use licking as a submissive or appeasement signal in dominance hierarchies.

Thermoregulation: Some animals use licking to cool themselves. Cats do not sweat the way humans do and the saliva deposited by licking provides a similar means of evaporative cooling. Some animals spread saliva over areas of the body with little or no fur to maximise heat loss. For example, kangaroos lick their wrists and rats lick their testicles.

Mating behavior:
Male mammals often lick the genitals of females before copulation. Post-copulatory genital grooming often occurs in male rats and prosimian primates. This behavior may prevent disease transmission.

===In primates===
Ring-tailed lemurs lick each other&#x27;s babies as a means of collective grooming and of reinforcing social cohesion within the community. Macaques and other primates lick leaves for water in addition to dipping their arms into tree crevices and licking the water off. Chimpanzees use licking in a variety of ways: licking objects, such as dead trees, that others in their community have licked, licking each other&#x27;s body parts for grooming and sex and licking rocks for salt. Gorillas use licking in addition to other senses to determine the nature of an object.

====In humans====
Compared to most other mammals, licking has a minor role for humans. The human tongue is relatively short and inflexible, and is not well adapted for either grooming or drinking. Instead, humans prefer to wash themselves using their hands and drink by sucking or pouring fluid into their mouth. Humans have much less hair over their skin than most other mammals, and much of that hair is in places which they cannot reach with their own mouth. The presence of sweat glands all over the human body makes licking as a cooling method unnecessary.

Nonetheless, licking does play a role for humans. Even though humans cannot effectively drink water by licking, the human tongue is quite sufficient for licking more viscous fluids. Some foods are sold in a form intended to be consumed mainly by licking, e.g. ice cream cones and lollipops. Though useful, in some cultures it is considered improper table manners to clean one&#x27;s fingers by licking during a meal.

Some people in the Afar tribe of Ethiopia have been reported to have used their tongues to lick other humans, as a way of cleaning them from the dust that accumulates on them in a very water-scarce region.

Humans use licking for a number of other purposes. For example, licking can moisten the adhesive surfaces of stamps or envelopes. Many people lick a fingertip (usually the one of the index finger) for some extra grip when turning a page, taking a sheet of paper from the top of a pile or opening a plastic bag. In sewing, thread ends are commonly wet by licking to make the fibres stick together and thus make threading them through the eye of a needle easier. Another practice considered uncivilized is licking one&#x27;s hand and using it to groom one&#x27;s hair.

Humans also use their tongues for sexual purposes, such as during cunnilingus, anilingus, fellatio, breast licking, foot licking, and whilst French kissing, where two people lick each other&#x27;s tongues.
=== In dogs ===
==Abnormal licking==

Self-licking can sometimes become abnormally frequent occasionally resulting in a lick granuloma. The most common cause of lick granuloma appears to be psychological, related to stress, anxiety, separation anxiety, boredom, or compulsiveness. Lick granulomae are especially seen in active dogs left alone for long periods of time. One theory is that excessive licking causes endorphin release, which reduces pain and makes the dog feel temporarily euphoric. This provides the animal with positive feedback from the licking, and subsequent addiction to the behaviour.

Animals in captivity sometimes develop a licking stereotypy during which surfaces (walls, bars, gates, etc.) are repeatedly licked for no apparent reason. This has been observed in captive giraffes and camels.

<text>Lee Lai Shan (, born 5 September 1970 in Cheung Chau, Hong Kong) is a former world champion and Olympic gold medal-winning professional windsurfer from Hong Kong. She was the first athlete to win an Olympic medal representing British Hong Kong. As of 2024, she is still the only non-fencer to win an Olympic gold medal for Hong Kong.

== Sports career ==

Lee Lai Shan, popularly known as &quot;San San&quot;, was born in Cheung Chau and started windsurfing aged 12. She began to take part in windsurfing competitions at the age of 17 and joined the Hong Kong team at 19. Over the years, Lee won many international competitions, including the first-ever Olympic gold medal for British Hong Kong, in the women&#x27;s mistral boardsailing class, at the 1996 Summer Olympics and the first champion in the Asian Games representing Hong Kong when it was a British territory.

Hong Kong had never been able to win any medals for as long as it had participated in the Olympic games since 1952 until Lee Lai Shan&#x27;s victory at Atlanta 1996. Notably, the 1996 Summer Olympics was the last international sporting event that Hong Kong participated in as a British Dependent Territory, making Lee&#x27;s medal the only medal that the British Hong Kong team won. It was at that time Lee famously declared to the media: &quot;Hong Kong athletes are not rubbish!&quot;

After the Games she became a student of sports management at Australia&#x27;s University of Canberra in 1996. She was the first Hong Kong athlete to be awarded an honorary Doctorate in social sciences by The Chinese University of Hong Kong.

Lee became a recipient of the &quot;Ten Outstanding Young Persons Award&quot; and the Bronze Bauhinia Star Award in recognition of her outstanding achievements in the international sports scene. There is a monument resembling a windsurf board and mast erected in her honour near the beachfront at Cheung Chau.

In the 1997 New Year Honours, she was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to sport.

In 2008, she was the first person to carry the Olympic torch in the torch relay leg in Hong Kong. She was also the final torchbearer in the 2008 Summer Olympics sailing opening ceremony at Qingdao International Marina.

===Participation record===
*1990 Beijing Asian Games – 2nd
*1992 Barcelona Olympic Games – 11th
*1993 World Championships – 1st

==Honors==
*1994 – Named Best Athlete of Asia

*1995 – Selected Best Athlete in Hong Kong for 1994
*1998 – Voted one of Hong Kong Top Ten Athletes for 1988–1998 by Hong Kong Sports Press Association
*1999 – Selected one of China&#x27;s Top Ten Athletes for 1998 
*1999 – Awarded Special Prize in the &quot;Best Athletes of the Century&quot; selection jointly organised by the Chinese Olympic Committee, Henry Fok Foundation and China Sports Press Association

==Personal information==
Lee married longtime partner Wong Tak-Sum (黃德森) (known in English as Sam Wong), who has also represented Hong Kong internationally in windsurfing, and gave birth to a daughter, Haylie Wong (黃希皚), in August 2005, and to a second daughter, Kallie Wong (黃嘉怡), in August 2007. This was one of the reasons she took a break from competition, though she has not ruled out competing altogether. In 2008, she was involved in the Summer Olympics again when she was one of the presenting team for ATV, in addition to commentating in the sailing event.

In 2006, Lee was featured in a Hang Seng Bank advertisement, in which she said the cost of raising a child in Hong Kong will be HK$4 million (US$510,000). It has caused a slight controversy in Hong Kong as most people do not think it will actually cost that much, and most think that Hang Seng Bank exaggerated the figures.

<text>ACC is a near-C compiler for the MS-DOS operating system on the IBM PC line of computers for programs. The compiler and compiled programs will run on any Intel 80386 or above PC running MS-DOS. Included with the compiler are a 386 assembler and a linker for combining multiple object files. There are also two libraries, which are a protected mode DOS extender (based on Thomas Pytel&#x27;s, AKA Tran&#x27;s PMODE30B + PMODE307 DOS extenders), and a library of functions callable by C programs.

Pointers are 4 bytes, and can access all available memory. All memory can be allocated too. The compiler, assembler and linker are all very small and reportedly very fast.

ACC uses simple commands which place objects and change them. As such, it is very hard to make games with complicated sprites, because there is no command which can group objects. Almost every type of command is two or three letters, for example: tx=text, col=color, oct=octagon, etc. It is similar to Batch.

<text>Lazard Inc. (formerly known as Lazard Ltd and Lazard Frères &amp; Co.) is a financial advisory and asset management firm that engages in investment banking, asset management and other financial services, primarily with institutional clients. It is the world&#x27;s largest independent investment bank, with principal executive offices in New York City, Paris and London.

Lazard was founded in 1848 and operates from 41 cities across 26 countries in North America, Europe, Asia, Australia, and Central and South America. The firm provides advice on mergers and acquisitions, strategic matters, restructuring and capital structure, capital raising and corporate finance, as well as asset management services to corporations, partnerships, institutions, governments and individuals.

==History==

===Early years===
On July 12, 1848, three French brothers, Alexandre Lazard, Lazare Lazard, and Simon Lazard, founded Lazard Frères &amp; Co. as a dry goods merchant store in New Orleans, Louisiana. By 1851, Simon and two more brothers, Maurice and Elie, had all moved to San Francisco, California, while Alexandre moved to New York. Lazard Frères began to serve miners engaged in the California Gold Rush, and soon expanded into banking and foreign exchange.

In 1854, Alexandre Lazard moved to Paris, France, where he opened an office to complement the U.S. business. The firm began advising the French government on gold buying. In 1870, the firm continued to expand its international operations, opening an office in London as well.

The name &quot;Lazard Frères&quot; means &quot;Lazard Brothers&quot; or &quot;the Brothers Lazard&quot; in French. It refers to associations of the Lazard brothers to form various financial services institutions with world-wide offices and investments.

===The Three Houses of Lazard===
In the late 1800s and early 1900s, the firm evolved into three &quot;Houses of Lazard&quot; in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, separately managed but allied. The Lazard partners advised clients on financial matters and built a cross-border network of high-level relationships in business and government. Noted financial advisor George Blumenthal rose to prominence as the head of the U.S. branch of Lazard Frères and was a partner of Lazard Frères in France.

In the economic boom following World War II, the American operations of Lazard expanded significantly under the leadership of the French financier André Meyer. Meyer and Lazard partner Felix Rohatyn have been credited with virtually inventing the modern mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) market.

In 1953, Lazard Investors Ltd began an asset management business in London, which is the origin of today&#x27;s Lazard Asset Management.

===A unified firm===
In 1977, as the health of Meyer began to deteriorate, the firm came to be controlled by Michel David-Weill. Under his leadership, the three houses of Lazard were formally united in 2000 as Lazard LLC.

In 2002, David-Weill hired Bruce Wasserstein to be CEO. Lazard became a public company in 2005, with nearly two-thirds of its shares owned by current and former employees. Wasserstein became its first chairman and CEO. In connection with the initial public offering (IPO), Lazard spun off its broker-dealer business, Lazard Capital Markets.

Following Wasserstein&#x27;s death in 2009, Lazard&#x27;s board of directors elected Kenneth M. Jacobs as chairman and CEO.

Lazard invested in a startup investment bank, Independence Point Advisors, in late 2021.

On May 26, 2023, the firm announced that Peter R. Orszag, CEO of Financial Advisory, had been unanimously elected by its Board to serve as CEO of Lazard and as a Board Director, effective October 1, 2023. Orszag became chief executive officer of Lazard on October 1, 2023.

The publicly traded partnership Lazard Ltd was reincorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law effective January 1, 2024 and changed its name from Lazard Ltd to Lazard, Inc.

==Business overview==

===Financial advisory===
Lazard advises clients on a wide range of strategic and financial issues. These may include advising on the potential acquisition of another company, business or certain assets, or on the sale of certain businesses, assets or an entire company. The firm also advises on alternatives to a sale such as recapitalizations, spin-offs, carve-outs and split-offs. For companies in financial distress or their creditors, Lazard advises on all aspects of restructuring. The firm has advised on many of the largest restructuring assignments in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in mid-2007. Lazard also advises on capital structure and capital raising. Capital structure advice includes reviewing and analyzing structural alternatives and assisting in long-term planning. Capital raising advice includes private and public market financing. Lazard&#x27;s Sovereign Advisory group advises governments and sovereign entities on policy and financial issues.

===Asset management===
Lazard&#x27;s asset management business provides investment management and financial advisory services to institutional clients, financial intermediaries, private clients, and investment vehicles around the world. The firm manages assets on behalf of institutional clients (corporations, labor unions, public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and banks; and through sub-advisory relationships, mutual fund sponsors, broker-dealers and registered advisors) and individual clients (principally family offices and high-net-worth individuals).

<text>The grass snake (Natrix natrix), sometimes called the ringed snake or water snake, is a Eurasian semi-aquatic non-venomous colubrid snake. It is often found near water and feeds almost exclusively on amphibians.

==Subspecies==
Many subspecies are recognized, including:
&quot;Natrix natrix helvetica&quot; (Lacépède, 1789) was formerly treated as a subspecies, but following genetic analysis it was recognised in August 2017 as a separate species, &quot;Natrix helvetica&quot;, the barred grass snake. Four other subspecies were transferred from &quot;N. natrix&quot; to &quot;N. helvetica&quot;, becoming &quot;N. helvetica cettii&quot;, &quot;N. helvetica corsa&quot;, &quot;N. helvetica lanzai&quot; and &quot;N. helvetica sicula&quot;.

==Description==

The grass snake is typically dark green or brown in colour with a characteristic yellow or whitish collar behind the head, which explains the alternative name ringed snake. The colour may also range from grey to black, with darker colours being more prevalent in colder regions, presumably owing to the thermal benefits of being dark in colour. The underside is whitish with irregular blocks of black, which are useful in recognizing individuals. It can grow to or more in length.

==Distribution==
The grass snake is widely distributed in mainland Europe, ranging from mid Scandinavia to southern Italy. It is also found in the Middle East and northwestern Africa.

Grass snakes in Britain were thought to belong to the subspecies &quot;N. n. helvetica&quot; but have been reclassified as the barred grass snake &quot;Natrix helvetica&quot;. Any records of &quot;N. natrix&quot; in Britain are now considered to have originated from imported specimens.

==Ecology==

===Feeding===

Grass snakes mainly prey on amphibians, especially the common toad and the common frog, although they may also occasionally eat ants and larvae. Captive snakes have been observed taking earthworms offered by hand, but dead prey items are never taken. The snake will search actively for prey, often on the edges of the water, using sight and sense of smell (using Jacobson&#x27;s organ). They consume prey live without using constriction.

===Habitat===
Grass snakes are strong swimmers and may be found close to fresh water, although there is evidence individual snakes often do not need bodies of water throughout the entire season.

The preferred habitat appears to be open woodland and &quot;edge&quot; habitat, such as field margins and woodland borders, as these may offer adequate refuge while still affording ample opportunity for thermoregulation through basking. Pond edges are also favoured and the relatively high chance of observing this secretive species in such areas may account for their perceived association with ponds and water.

Grass snakes, like most reptiles, are at the mercy of the thermal environment and need to overwinter in areas which are not subject to freezing. Thus, they typically spend the winter underground where the temperature is relatively stable.
===Reproduction===
As spring approaches, the males emerge first and spend much of the day basking in an effort to raise body temperature and thereby metabolism. This may be a tactic to maximise sperm production, as the males mate with the females as soon as they emerge up to two weeks later in April, or earlier if environmental temperatures are favourable. The leathery-skinned eggs are laid in batches of eight to 40 in June to July and hatch after about 10 weeks. To survive and hatch, the eggs require a temperature of at least , but preferably , with high humidity. Areas of rotting vegetation, such as compost heaps, are preferred locations. The young are about long when they hatch and are immediately independent.

===Migration===
After breeding in summer, snakes tend to hunt and may range widely during this time, moving up to several hundred metres in a day. Prey items tend to be large compared to the size of the snake, and this impairs the movement ability of the snake. Snakes that have recently eaten rarely move any significant distance and will stay in one location, basking to optimize their body temperature until the prey item has been digested. Individual snakes may only need two or three significant prey items throughout an entire season.

===Ecdysis (moulting)===

Ecdysis occurs at least once during the active season. As the outer skin wears and the snake grows, the new skin forms underneath the old, including the eye scales which may turn a milky blue/white colour at this time—referred to as being &#x27;in blue&#x27;. The blue-white colour comes from an oily secretion between the old and new skins; the snake&#x27;s coloration will also look dull, as though the animal is dusty. This process affects the eyesight of the snakes and they do not move or hunt during this time; they are also, in common with most other snakes, more aggressive. The outer skin is eventually sloughed in one piece (inside-out) and normal movement activity is resumed.

===Defence===
In defence they can produce a garlic-smelling fluid from the anal glands, and feign death (thanatosis) by becoming completely limp when they may also secrete blood (autohaemorrhage) from the mouth and nose. They may also perform an aggressive display in defence, hissing and striking without opening the mouth. They rarely bite in defence and lack venomous fangs. When caught they often regurgitate the contents of their stomachs.

Grass snakes display a rare defensive behavior involving raising the front of the body and flattening the head and neck so that it resembles a cobra&#x27;s hood, although the geographic ranges of grass snakes and of cobras overlap very little. However, the fossil record shows that the extinct European cobra &quot;Naja romani&quot; occurs in Miocene-aged strata of France, Germany, Austria, Romania, and Ukraine and thus overlapped with &quot;Natrix&quot; species including the extinct &quot;Natrix longivertebrata&quot;, suggesting that the grass snake&#x27;s behavioral mimicry of cobras is a fossil behavior, although it may protect against predatory birds which migrate to Africa for the winter and encounter cobras there.

===Protection and threats===
The species has various predator species, including corvids, storks, owls and perhaps other birds of prey, foxes, and the domestic cat.

In Denmark it is protected, as all five species of reptiles were protected in 1981. Two of the subspecies are considered critically endangered: &quot;N. n. cetti&quot; (Sardinian grass snake) and &quot;N. n. schweizeri&quot;.

== Mythology ==
=== Baltic ===

In the Baltic mythology, the grass snake (Lithuanian: žaltys, Latvian: zalktis) is seen as a sacred animal. It was frequently kept as a pet, living under a married couple&#x27;s bed or in a special place near the hearth. Supposedly, snakes ate food given to them by hand.

After the Christianization of Lithuania and Latvia, the grass snake still retained some mythological significance. In spite of the serpent&#x27;s symbolic meaning as a symbol of evil in Christianity, in Latvia and Lithuania there were various folk beliefs, dating even to the late 19th century, that killing grass snakes might bring grave misfortune or that an injured snake will take revenge on the offender. The ancient Baltic belief of grass snakes as household spirits transformed into a belief that there is a snake (known or not to the inhabitants) living under every house; if it leaves, the house will burn down. Common Latvian folk sayings include &quot;who kills a grass snake, kills his happiness&quot; and &quot;when the Saulė sees a dead grass snake, she cries for 9 days&quot;.

Well-known literary works based on these traditions include Lithuanian folk tale Eglė the Queen of Serpents (&quot;Eglė žalčių karalienė&quot;) and the Latvian folk fairytale &quot;The grass snake&#x27;s bride&quot; (&quot;Zalkša līgava&quot;). These works include another common theme in Baltic mythology: that grass snakes wear crowns (note grass snake&#x27;s yellow spots) and that there is a king of snakes who wears a golden crown. In some traditions the king of snakes changes every year; he drops his crown in spring and the other snakes fight for it (possibly based on the mating of grass snakes).

Today grass snakes hold a meaning of house blessing among many Latvians and Lithuanians. One tradition is to put a bowl of milk near a snake&#x27;s place of residence, although there is no evidence of a grass snake ever drinking milk. Driven by late 19th century and 20th century Romantic nationalism, grass snake motifs in Latvia have gained a meaning of education and wisdom, and are common ornaments in the military, folk dance groups and education logos and insignia. They are also found on the Lielvārde Belt. The grass snake has also become one of the main symbols of the Lithuanian neo-pagan movement Romuva.

===Roman===
Virgil in his 29 BC &quot;Georgics&quot; (book III, lines 425-439: ) describes the grass snake as a large feared snake living in marshes in Calabria, eating frogs and fish.

<text>Annie Martin (born 7 September 1981) is a Canadian beach volleyball player. She has represented her country at the 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics. Her current playing partner is Marie-Andrée Lessard.

Martin and Lessard lost their first match against the British team of Zara Dampney and Shauna Mullin after winning the first set 21–14, but then lost the second 21–14 and the third by 15–13. The Canadian duo lost their second match by a similar scoreline, 2–1 in sets, against the Russian team of Ekaterina Khomyakova and Evgenia Ukolova.

<text>Kerri Lee Walsh Jennings (born August 15, 1978) is an American professional beach volleyball player, three-time Olympic gold medalist, and a one-time Olympic bronze medalist. She is the beach volleyball leader in career victories as of 2016 having won 135 international and domestic tournaments.

Walsh Jennings and teammate Misty May-Treanor were the gold medalists in beach volleyball at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. They also won the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in 2003, 2005 and 2007. The pair set various records throughout their partnership, including a win streak of 112 consecutive matches (19 consecutive tournament titles) in 20072008, breaking their own previous record of 89 consecutive match wins. They have been called &quot;the greatest beach volleyball team of all time.&quot;

==Early years ==
Walsh was born in Santa Clara, California, the daughter of Margery Lee (née Formico, Italian American) and Timothy Joseph Walsh. Walsh grew up in Scotts Valley, north of Santa Cruz. She attended grade school there until the end of her middle school years. Before she started high school, her family moved to San Jose. Walsh attended Archbishop Mitty High School, competing on the volleyball and basketball teams. She led her school&#x27;s teams to three state championships in volleyball, in 1993, 1994 and 1995. She also led her school&#x27;s basketball team to a state championship in 1995. She was named Gatorade National High School Volleyball Player of the Year in 1996, the first time the award was given. Walsh was also the #1 volleyball athlete recruit in the nation her senior year (1995.) While in high school she competed against her future beach doubles partner, Misty May-Treanor

==College==
Walsh attended Stanford University on a volleyball scholarship. While there she was selected as a first-team All-American four years in a row, becoming only the second player in the history of collegiate volleyball to be chosen first team all four years of their collegiate careers. While at Stanford her school&#x27;s volleyball team won over 90% of its matches, posting a 122–11 overall record. The Cardinal won four Pac-10 titles and three times reached the NCAA Final Four, winning the title in 1996 and 1997, and falling to Penn State in the championship game in her senior year in 1999. She was selected as the MVP of the Final Four in 1996, and was co-National Player of the Year in 1999. She was also the first player in PAC-10 history to record over 1,500 kills (1,553), 1,200 digs (1,285) and 500 blocks (502). Walsh is considered to be one of the best all-around players in collegiate volleyball history. She graduated from Stanford in 2001 with a B.A. in American studies.

==Professional career==
Walsh-Jennings plays professional beach volleyball on the U.S. AVP Tour and internationally on the FIVB World Tour. For most of her career she played with partner Misty May-Treanor, forming the most successful beach pairings in AVP history. May and Walsh formed a partnership on the beach circuit in 2001, finishing the season with the number five ranking in the world. In 2002 the team reached the number one ranking. They continued their dominance in 2003, winning all eight tournaments they entered and a then-record 90 straight matches, including the world championships where they upset defending world champions Brazil in the final.

Following the retirement of partner Misty May-Treanor in 2012, Walsh teamed with April Ross. She went on to break the career record for most wins by a female professional volleyball player when she won the FIVB Grand Slam in Xiamen, China. The win gave Walsh the 113th title of her career, breaking the old mark set by May-Treanor. Walsh and Ross won 21–14, 17–21, 15–12 over the Brazilian pair of Taiana Lima and Talita Da Rocha Antunes.

===Beijing 2008===
On August 21, 2008, Walsh Jennings and May-Treanor repeated as Olympic gold medalists, defeating the first-seeded Chinese team in the final match (they would have been first-seeded, but home rule put them in the #2 spot with China as the #1). May-Treanor and Walsh did not lose a set in either of the past two Olympics. Their final match extended their unbeaten streak to 108 matches.

===London 2012===
Walsh and May-Treanor competed together for the last time in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. After first and second round wins, they continued their Olympic win streak of 32 consecutive sets without a loss until losing the first set of three to Austria in a preliminary round before ultimately winning the match, 17–21; 21–8; 15–10. The pair faced China in the semi-finals, where they won a hard-fought victory over Xue Chen and Zhang Xi 22–20, 22–20 to reach the finals. In an all USA final they defeated fellow Americans Jen Kessy and April Ross, 21–16, 21–16 to win the gold medal. The victory placed Walsh and May-Treanor as one of the few athletes to have won the gold medal in three consecutive Olympiads.

===Rio de Janeiro 2016===
Walsh-Jennings partnered with April Ross for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The pair reached the semi-finals, where they fell to Brazil&#x27;s Ágatha Bednarczuk and Bárbara Seixas in two hard fought sets, (22-20, 21–18). In the bronze medal match, Walsh-Jennings and Ross faced the number one ranked team of Larissa França/Talita Antunes from Brazil. This was the match many thought would be played for the gold medal, but Larissa and Talita had been upset in the semifinals by Germany&#x27;s Laura Ludwig and Kira Walkenhorst, throwing the two top teams into the bronze medal match. Walsh-Jennings and Ross dropped the first set and were down by three in the second before coming back to win, 17–21, 21–17, 15–9. The bronze medal was Walsh-Jennings&#x27;s fourth Olympic medal, making her the most decorated beach volleyball player–male or female–in Olympic history.

<doc id="928709" wikidata="Q1071782" url="?curid=928709" title="Chic Hecht">
<text>Mayer Jacob Hecht (November 30, 1928 – May 15, 2006) was an American Republican politician and diplomat who served as a United States Senator from Nevada from 1983 to 1989, and as U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas from 1989 to 1993.

==Early life and education==
Hecht was born into a Jewish family in Cape Girardeau, Missouri. His mother was born in Kiev and his paternal grandparents were from Poland and Germany. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in retailing from Washington University in St. Louis in 1949.

=== Korean War ===
Hecht attended Military Intelligence School at Fort Holabird and served as an intelligence agent with the U.S. armed forces during the Korean War, from 1951 to 1953.

Hecht was a member of the National Military Intelligence Association, and was inducted into the Military Intelligence Hall of Fame in 1988.

== Career ==
After leaving military service, Hecht moved to Nevada. His business activities included retailing, the operation of a bank, and interests in hotels. He married the former Gail Kahn in 1959.

===Politics===
In 1966, he was elected to the Nevada Senate, the first Republican to represent his predominantly Democratic district in and around Las Vegas in more than 25 years. He was a state senator from 1967 to 1975, serving as Senate minority leader from 1969 to 1970.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1982, he was elected to the U.S. Senate, replacing four-term incumbent Democrat Howard Cannon, whom he had defeated for reelection. He served only one term, from 1983 to 1989, having been defeated for reelection in 1988 by Democratic Governor Richard Bryan. In the Senate, Hecht became known for his verbal slips and miscues, including a vow at one point not to permit a &quot;nuclear suppository&quot; in his home state.

=== Ambassador ===
After his loss, he was then appointed ambassador to the Bahamas by President George H. W. Bush on March 24, 1989. During his confirmation, he encountered opposition from some Democratic senators, an unusual occurrence for senators to oppose the nomination of a former colleague. Some members like Senator Bob Graham and John Breaux argued Hecht was unqualified to serve in a position growing in importance in the War on Drugs and took exception to Hecht&#x27;s remarks during his confirmation hearing, when he stated he would feel at home because the position &quot;is a nice lifestyle&quot; with &quot;a lot of nice golf courses and good fishing.&quot; Nevertheless, Hecht was easily confirmed by a 78 to 19 vote on July 11, 1989. He served from 1989 until 1993.

===Activism for Soviet Jews===
Before the Reykjavík Summit in 1986, Hecht met with President Ronald Reagan. Hecht urged Reagan to ask Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to ease emigration requirements for Soviet Jews, including those on a list that had been prepared by a member of the Council for Soviet Jewry. Hecht reported his effort as successful:

The former senator related that Reagan told him afterwards that he had given the list to the Soviet leader at the beginning of the summit when the two men met alone. Hecht said that Reagan was told by Gorbachev, &quot;as long as nothing is in the paper, there is no publicity, and we don&#x27;t hear about it,&quot; Jews on the list would be quietly released.

Hecht credited the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Schneerson, for prompting him to undertake the effort.

===Relationship with John Kerry===
Hecht&#x27;s name reappeared in the news in the course of the 2004 presidential election because of an event during his term in the Senate. On July 12, 1988, Hecht was leaving a Republican weekly policy lunch when he began to choke on an apple slice from his lunch of fruit salad and cottage cheese. Unable to talk to his colleagues and not wanting to vomit on them, he ran into the hallway, where Senator Kit Bond, a Republican from Missouri, unsuccessfully tried to help Hecht. Senator John Kerry, a Democrat, stepping off an elevator at the same time, recognized what was happening to Hecht and quickly performed the Heimlich maneuver, saving Hecht&#x27;s life.

For the rest of his life, Hecht always called Kerry on Christmas Day (December 25) each year to thank him. Though a conservative Republican who contributed the maximum amount to the re-election campaign of George W. Bush, Hecht said that he would appear in support of Kerry if asked, though he declined to reveal whether he planned to vote for Kerry or for Bush. One of Hecht&#x27;s daughters, Leslie Helmer, who worked for the presidential campaigns of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, helped raise funds for Kerry&#x27;s campaign, out of gratitude for his action.

===Later career===
After finishing his time as ambassador to the Bahamas in 1994, Hecht returned home to Las Vegas to focus on his business activities. On May 24, 2016, his brother, businessman and philanthropist Martin Hecht, died in Palm Springs, California. The Hecht Synagogue at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem was constructed through funds raised for over a decade by Martin. Opened in 1981 and dedicated in 1985 in the presence of the Hecht brothers and Senator Jesse Helms, it was named after the Hechts&#x27; then 96-year-old father.

== Personal life ==
Hecht was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2005. He died of the cancer on May 15, 2006, at the age of 77. Hecht was survived by his wife and two daughters, Lori and Lesley.

<doc id="928718" wikidata="Q313883" url="?curid=928718" title="Alexander II of Macedon">
<text>Alexander II (; 368 BC) was king of the ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon from around 370 BC until his death in 368 BC. He was a member of the Argead dynasty through his father Amyntas III.

==Family==
He was the eldest of the three sons of king Amyntas and Queen Eurydice I. His brothers were Philip and Perdiccas III.

==King of Macedonia==
Although he had already attained his majority, Alexander was very young when he ascended to the throne in 369 BC. This caused immediate problems for the new king as enemies of the dynasty resumed war. Alexander simultaneously faced an Illyrian invasion from the north-west and an attack from the east by the pretender Pausanias. Pausanias quickly captured several cities and threatened the queen mother, who was at the palace in Pella with her young sons. Alexander defeated his enemies with the help of the Athenian general Iphicrates, who had been sailing along the Macedonian coast on the way to recapture Amphipolis.

At the request of the Thessalian Aleuadae, Alexander intervened in a civil war in Thessaly. He successfully gained control of Larissa and several other cities but, betraying a promise he had made, put garrisons in them. This provoked a hostile reaction from Thebes, the leading military power in Greece at the time. The Theban general Pelopidas drove the Macedonians from Thessaly. He then neutralized Alexander by favoring the ambitions of Alexander&#x27;s brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, and forced Alexander to abandon his alliance with Athens in favor of Thebes. As part of this new alliance, Alexander had to hand over hostages, including his younger brother Philip.

He would coin the name of the king&#x27;s personal guard; the Pezhetairos, or the infantry companions. The name would be retooled under Philip II as the name of his pike infantry.

Alexander was assassinated during a performance of the &quot;telesias&quot;, a war dance, at the instigation of Ptolemy. Although Alexander&#x27;s brother Perdiccas III became the next king, he was under age, and Ptolemy became regent and effectively the ruler.

<text>The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. was an American investment bank, securities trading, and brokerage firm that failed in 2008 during the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. After its closure it was subsequently sold to JPMorgan Chase. The company&#x27;s main business areas before its failure were capital markets, investment banking, wealth management, and global clearing services, and it was heavily involved in the subprime mortgage crisis.

In the years leading up to the failure, Bear Stearns was heavily involved in securitization and issued large amounts of asset-backed securities which were, in the case of mortgages, pioneered by Lewis Ranieri, &quot;the father of mortgage securities.&quot; As investor losses mounted in those markets in 2006 and 2007, the company actually increased its exposure, especially to the mortgage-backed assets that were central to the subprime mortgage crisis. In March 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York provided an emergency loan to try to avert a sudden collapse of the company. The company could not be saved, however, and was sold to JPMorgan Chase for $10 per share, a price far below its pre-crisis 52-week high of $133.20 per share, but not as low as the $2 per share originally agreed upon.

The collapse of the company was a prelude to the 2008 financial crisis and the meltdown of the investment banking industry in the United States and elsewhere. In January 2010, JPMorgan ceased using the Bear Stearns name.

== History ==

Bear Stearns was founded as an equity trading house on May 1, 1923, by Joseph Ainslie Bear, Robert B. Stearns and Harold C. Mayer with $500,000 in capital (). Internal tensions quickly arose among the three founders. The firm survived the Wall Street Crash of 1929 without laying off any employees and by 1933 opened its first branch office in Chicago. In 1955 the firm opened its first international office in Amsterdam.

In 1985, Bear Stearns became a publicly traded company. It served corporations, institutions, governments, and individuals. The company&#x27;s business included corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions, institutional equities, fixed income sales &amp; risk management, trading and research, private client services, derivatives, foreign exchange and futures sales and trading, asset management, and custody services. Through Bear Stearns Securities Corp., it offered global clearing services to broker dealers, prime broker clients and other professional traders, including securities lending. 

Bear Stearns&#x27; World Headquarters was located at 383 Madison Avenue, between East 46th Street and East 47th Street in Manhattan. By 2007, the company employed more than 15,500 people worldwide. The firm was headquartered in New York City with offices in Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Houston, Los Angeles, Irvine, San Francisco, St. Louis; Whippany, New Jersey; and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Internationally the firm had offices in London, Beijing, Dublin, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Lugano, Milan, São Paulo, Mumbai, Shanghai, Singapore and Tokyo.

In 2005–2007, Bear Stearns was recognized as the &quot;Most Admired&quot; securities firm in &quot;Fortune&quot; &quot;America&#x27;s Most Admired Companies&quot; survey, and second overall in the securities firm section. The annual survey is a prestigious ranking of employee talent, quality of risk management and business innovation. This was the second time in three years that Bear Stearns had achieved this &quot;top&quot; distinction.

By November 2006, the company had total capital of approximately $66.7 billion and total assets of $350.4 billion and according to the April 2005 issue of &quot;Institutional Investor&quot; magazine, Bear Stearns was the seventh-largest securities firm in terms of total capital.

A year later Bear Stearns had notional contract amounts of approximately $13.40 trillion in derivative financial instruments, of which $1.85 trillion were listed futures and option contracts. In addition, Bear Stearns was carrying more than $28 billion in &#x27;level 3&#x27; assets on its books at the end of fiscal 2007 versus a net equity position of only $11.1 billion. This $11.1 billion supported $395 billion in assets, which means a leverage ratio of 35.6 to 1. This highly leveraged balance sheet, consisting of many illiquid and potentially worthless assets, led to the rapid diminution of investor and lender confidence, which finally evaporated as Bear was forced to call the New York Federal Reserve to stave off the looming cascade of counterparty risk which would ensue from forced liquidation.

=== Start of the crisis – two subprime mortgage funds fail ===

On June 22, 2007, Bear Stearns pledged a collateralized loan of up to $3.2 billion to &quot;bail out&quot; one of its funds, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund, while negotiating with other banks to loan money against collateral to another fund, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund. Bear Stearns had originally put up just $25 million, so they were hesitant about the bailout; nonetheless, CEO James Cayne and other senior executives worried about the damage to the company&#x27;s reputation. The funds were invested in thinly traded collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Merrill Lynch seized $850 million worth of the underlying collateral but only was able to auction $100 million of them. The incident sparked concern of contagion as Bear Stearns might be forced to liquidate its CDOs, prompting a mark-down of similar assets in other portfolios. Richard A. Marin, a senior executive at Bear Stearns Asset Management responsible for the two hedge funds, was replaced on June 29 by Jeffrey B. Lane, a former vice chairman of rival investment bank Lehman Brothers.

During the week of July 16, 2007, Bear Stearns disclosed that the two subprime hedge funds had lost nearly all of their value amid a rapid decline in the market for subprime mortgages.

On August 1, 2007, investors in the two funds took action against Bear Stearns and its top board and risk management managers and officers. The law firms of Jake Zamansky &amp; Associates and Rich &amp; Intelisano both filed arbitration claims with the National Association of Securities Dealers alleging that Bear Stearns misled investors about its exposure to the funds. This was the first legal action made against Bear Stearns. Co-President Warren Spector was asked to resign on August 5, 2007, as a result of the collapse of two hedge funds tied to subprime mortgages. A September 21 report in &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that Bear Stearns posted a 61 percent drop in net profits due to their hedge fund losses. With Samuel Molinaro&#x27;s November 15th revelation that Bear Stearns was writing down a further $1.2 billion in mortgage-related securities and would face its first loss in 83 years, Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s downgraded the company&#x27;s credit rating from AA to A.

Matthew Tannin and Ralph R. Cioffi, both former managers of hedge funds at Bear Stearns, were arrested June 19, 2008. They faced criminal charges and were found not guilty of misleading investors about the risks involved in the subprime market. Tannin and Cioffi were also named in lawsuits brought by Barclays Bank, which claimed they were one of the many investors misled by the executives.

They were also named in civil lawsuits brought in 2007 by investors, including Barclays, who claimed they had been misled. Barclays claimed that Bear Stearns knew that certain assets in the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Master Fund were worth much less than their professed values. The suit claimed that Bear Stearns managers devised &quot;a plan to make more money for themselves and further to use the Enhanced Fund as a repository for risky, poor-quality investments&quot;. The lawsuit said Bear Stearns told Barclays that the enhanced fund was up almost 6% through June 2007—when &quot;in reality, the portfolio&#x27;s asset values were plummeting.&quot;

=== Fed bailout and sale to JPMorgan Chase ===
On March 14, 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (&quot;FRBNY&quot;) agreed to provide a $25 billion loan to Bear Stearns collateralized by unencumbered assets from Bear Stearns in order to provide Bear Stearns the liquidity for up to 28 days that the market was refusing to provide. Shortly thereafter, FRBNY had a change of heart and told Bear Stearns that the 28-day loan was unavailable to them. The deal was then changed to where FRBNY would create a company (what would become Maiden Lane LLC) to buy $30 billion worth of Bear Stearns&#x27; assets, and Bear Stearns would be purchased by JPMorgan Chase in a stock swap worth $2 a share, or less than 7 percent of Bear Stearns&#x27; market value just two days before. This sale price represented a staggering loss as its stock had traded at $172 a share as late as January 2007, and $93 a share as late as February 2008. Eventually, after renegotiating the purchase of Bear Stearns, Maiden Lane LLC was funded by a $29 billion first priority loan from FRBNY and a $1 billion subordinated loan from JPMorgan Chase, without further recourse to JPMorgan Chase. The structure of the transaction, with both loans collateralized by securitized home mortgages and with the JPMorgan Chase loan bearing losses before the FRBNY loan, meant that FRBNY could not seize or otherwise encumber JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s assets if the underlying collateral became insufficient to repay the FRBNY loan. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke defended the bailout by stating that a bankruptcy of Bear Stearns would have affected the real economy and could have caused a &quot;chaotic unwinding&quot; of investments across US markets.

On March 20, SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said the collapse of Bear Stearns was due to a lack of confidence, not a lack of capital. Cox noted that Bear Stearns&#x27; problems escalated when rumors spread about its liquidity crisis which in turn eroded investor confidence in the firm. &quot;Notwithstanding that Bear Stearns continued to have high quality collateral to provide as security for borrowings, market counterparties became less willing to enter into collateralized funding arrangements with Bear Stearns&quot;, said Cox. Bear Stearns&#x27; liquidity pool started at $18.1 billion on March 10 and then plummeted to $2 billion on March 13. Ultimately market rumors about Bear Stearns&#x27; difficulties became self-fulfilling, Cox said.

On March 24, 2008, a class action suit was filed on behalf of shareholders, challenging the terms of JPMorgan&#x27;s acquisition of Bear Stearns. That same day, a new agreement was reached that raised JPMorgan Chase&#x27;s offer to $10 a share, up from the initial $2 offer, which meant an offer of $1.2 billion. The revised deal was aimed to quiet upset investors and was necessitated by what was characterized as loophole in a guarantee that was open-ended, despite the fact that the deal required shareholder approval. While it was not clear if JPMorgan&#x27;s lawyers, Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz, were to blame for the mistake in the hastily written contract, JPMorgan&#x27;s CEO, Jamie Dimon, was described as being &quot;apoplectic&quot; about the mistake. The Bear Stearns bailout was seen as an extreme-case scenario, and continues to raise significant questions about Fed intervention. On April 8, 2008, former Fed chairman Paul Volcker stated that the Fed had taken actions that &quot;extend to the very edge of its lawful and implied powers.&quot; See his remarks at a luncheon of the Economic Club of New York. On May 29, Bear Stearns shareholders approved the sale to JPMorgan Chase at the $10-per-share price.

An article by journalist Matt Taibbi for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; contended that naked short selling had a role in the demise of both Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. A study by finance researchers at the University of Oklahoma Price College of Business studied trading in financial stocks, including Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, and found &quot;no evidence that stock price declines were caused by naked short selling.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine also labelled former Bear Sterns head James Cayne as the CEO most responsible out of all the CEOs who &quot;screwed up Wall Street&quot; during the 2008 financial crisis, even reporting that &quot;none seemed more asleep at the switch than Bear Stearns&#x27; Cayne.&quot;

<text>Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie (15 May 1929 – 7 February 2008) was Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta from 1988 until his death in 2008. 

On 20 February 2015 a formal inquiry for the cause of his beatification and canonisation was opened in Rome.

==Early career==

Bertie was born in London as the elder son of Hon. James Bertie (youngest son of the 7th Earl of Abingdon) and Lady Jean Crichton-Stuart (daughter of the 4th Marquess of Bute).

He was the fifth cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth II, by common descent from King George III and his wife Queen Charlotte Sophia.

He was educated at the English Catholic public school, Ampleforth College, and graduated in Modern History from Christ Church, Oxford. He also attended the School of Oriental and African Studies of the University of London. From 1948 to 1950, he carried out military service in the Scots Guards, becoming a commissioned officer in 1949. After a short experience in the commercial sector, he taught modern languages (particularly French, and Spanish but also Russian, German, Dutch, Tibetan and Maltese) for twenty-three years at Worth School, a Benedictine public school in Sussex, England. One of his pupils there was Dominique, Prince and Count de La Rochefoucauld-Montbel who would become Grand Hospitaller of the Order of Malta. Bertie was a judo black belt and taught judo at Worth School.

== Order of Malta==

Bertie was admitted to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta as a Knight of Honour and Devotion, 14 November 1956. He became a Knight of Obedience 31 March 1968. On 7 February 1975 he entered the novitiate for Knights of Justice and of 28 March 1977 became of Knight of Justice in temporary vows. He made his perpetual vows as a Knight of Justice 20 May 1981.

In 1981 Bertie also joined the government of the Order as a member of the Sovereign Council. In April 1988, he was elected Grand Master in succession to the late Fra&#x27; Angelo de Mojana. Bertie&#x27;s election was ratified by Pope John Paul II 11 April 1988.

Subsequently, Bertie was Hospitaller of the Sanctuary of Lourdes, which is the annual pilgrimage site of the Order of Malta.

Bertie described the aims of the Order as &quot;to help the poor and the sick; that is and always has been our primary aim&quot;:
:&quot;The other military orders were there to fight the Saracens and to save Spain or the Holy Land or Prussia from the pagans. But we always had this special commitment to the poor and the sick. Our aims today are exactly the same as they were in 1099, the sanctification of our members through service to the sick.&quot;

==Personal life==
Bertie never married or had children. He died in Rome from cancer on 7 February 2008, aged 78.

==Ancestry==
==Titles, styles and honours==
===Titles and style===
His full title was: &quot;His Most Eminent Highness Fra&#x27; Andrew Willoughby Ninian Bertie, Prince and Grand Master of the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta, Most Humble Guardian of the Poor of Jesus Christ&quot;.

<text>Anchor Records was a UK-based record label, co-founded by Ian Ralfini and the American Broadcasting Companies, which owned ABC Records in the United States, in 1974. ABC Records marketed (distributed) Anchor albums in the US, and Anchor Records issued many ABC albums in the United Kingdom as &quot;ABC Records Marketed by Anchor Records.&quot;

The Anchor Records label was black with silver print. The logo, at the top of the label, was a British sailor with an anchor behind him and the words &quot;ANCHOR RECORDS LIMITED&quot; above the sailor&#x27;s hat and the word ANCHOR below. Anchor ceased operations in 1978, when ABC Records was purchased by MCA Records.

<text>Chancellor Records was a record label associated with ABC-Paramount Records, which initially distributed the smaller label. Based in Philadelphia, it was an integral part of the dominance of popular Philadelphia artists and music in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Its first hit was &quot;With All My Heart&quot; sung by Jodie Sands (1957), but the major artists the label was famous for were Frankie Avalon and Fabian Forte, and later Claudine Clark. The studio drummer for Chancellor Records was Charles Pasco who played for all of the artists that recorded there. The label was owned by Bob Marcucci, originally with partner Peter De Angelis; Ray Sharkey played Marcucci in the movie &quot;The Idolmaker&quot; (1980).

The record label also had the imprint &quot;Chancellor Country&quot; which was also distributed by ABC-Paramount Records.

<text>Command Records was a record label founded by Enoch Light in 1959 and, in October that year, was acquired by ABC-Paramount Records. Light produced a majority of the releases in the label&#x27;s catalog.

==Origin and history==
After Grand Award Records, the company focused on producing records targeted at audiophiles. Light and sound engineer Bob Fine handled the recording and engineering responsibilities, employing the technique of multiple microphone pickups. They used different types of microphones whose characteristics were best suited to reproduce the sounds of a particular instrument.

Command Records often featured abstract covers. In the early years, all covers were designed by Josef Albers, whose student Charles E. Murphy served as design director. Several are in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Later covers appeared to be imitations of Albers&#x27; work.

In 1966, Light left Command to form Project 3 Records.

==Recording technique==

While the recording industry had made magnetic tape the standard for recording music for release on vinyl, Command&#x27;s albums were recorded onto magnetic 35mm film. Light used the width of the film strip to create multitrack recordings, as opposed to the more limited two or three tracks offered by most recording studios at the time; the slightly higher linear speed provided an advantage in analog fidelity and the sprocket-driven film limited the &quot;wow and flutter&quot; problems associated with tape recording. This enabled Light to record more instruments individually and adjust their audio input levels, as well as their stereo position.

==Command test record==

The Command test record (Stereo Check Out) was an LP album produced by Command Records in 1960. It contained recordings designed to allow users to test their stereo equipment.

===Album details===
Like many other Command records, the Stereo Check Out came in a gatefold cover with extensive liner notes and full technical data inside. Charles Stark narrated both sides, providing both technical details and information about the musical instruments used on the tracks on Side Two.

====Side one====
Side One of this LP consists of turntable tests. An oscilloscope is a useful tool when used in conjunction with these tests:

# Stereo Balance Check
# Left and Right Channel Check
# Volume Reference Check
# Frequency Run Check
# Output Balance Check
# Flutter or Wow Check
# Phasing Check
# Acoustical Check
# Rumble Check

====Side two====
Side Two of this LP consists of musical selections from the Command catalogue:

# Hernando&#x27;s Hideaway (from Provocative Percussion Vol II)
# Cumana (from Provocative Piano)
# Tenderly (from bongos)
# Enjoy Yourself Cha-Cha (from Pertinent Percussion Cha-Cha&#x27;s)

<doc id="928729" wikidata="Q5594281" url="?curid=928729" title="Grand Award Records">
<text>Grand Award Records was a pop, jazz, and gospel music record label founded by violinist and conductor Enoch Light in Harrison, New Jersey in 1955.

Light used the liner notes to describe how the records were made and to advertise their importance by using words such as &quot;acclaimed&quot; and &quot;approved by&quot;. The cover design consisted of a fake frame of black and white around a well-drawn illustration in the middle. Early ones carried the slogan &quot;Great Music – Great Art&quot;. Most of the classical records had reproductions of European masters for the illustrations. The pop records had illustrations by American illustrators of the day: Tracy Sugarman, Elmer Wexler, Arthur Shilstone, David Stone. Among the pop records issued by the label are the &quot;Roaring Twenties&quot; series done by the Charleston City All Stars band conducted by Light. Paul Whiteman recorded for the label.

In 1959 Light formed subsidiary Command Records, and that October, sold Grand Award and all of its subsidiary labels—Command, as well as Audition, Colortone, and Waldorf Music Hall—to ABC. After the sale, Light was vice president and chief of A&amp;R for the labels. For Command releases, he hired audio engineer Robert C. Fine to make audiophile recordings for pop and jazz fans rather than classical, where high fidelity was usually found. He continued to use inflated prose to sell music. His name was prominent on many albums both as musician and producer. A few of the earliest covers were designed by Josef Albers. Other fairly famous artists contributed as well.

Grand Award LPs were phased out by 1961, but the label name was used by ABC at least until 1966.

ABC started the rock label ABC Command Probe, the first home of English progressive rock band Soft Machine. By 1970, the history of Waldorf Music Hall/Grand Award/Command essentially came to an end, although ABC used the Command label later in the 1970s for quadraphonic versions of albums released on its other labels. A few LP reissues (with the label now ABC/Grand Award) kept the music alive until about 1977.

<doc id="928732" wikidata="Q6458550" url="?curid=928732" title="LHI Records">
<text>LHI Records was an American record label founded by Lee Hazlewood. LHI stood for &quot;Lee Hazlewood Industries&quot;. The label was first distributed by Decca Records then by ABC Records (both labels were eventually absorbed by MCA Records). By 1969, LHI was distributed independently with tape distribution by Ampex. The label lasted until 1971.

== Notable releases==
* In 1966 Donnie Owens was named executive producer of the LHI country product. Their first single was &quot;Crying Shade&quot; and &quot;Out of My Hands&quot; by Virgil Warner. 
* In 1967 they released an album by garage rock band The Kitchen Cinq. In total one album and four singles of the group were released during 1967. The label issued a cameo single release of the group under the name A Handful. 
* The 1967 album &quot;Lee Hazlewood Presents The 98% American Mom &amp; Apple Pie 1929 Crash Band&quot; consisted of honky-tonk instrumental versions of highly commercial successful songs and compositions from Lee Hazlewood from the period 1965–1967.
* Country singer Sanford Clark covered Hazlewood&#x27;s composition &quot;Houston&quot; in 1964. The two singles releases on the label &quot;The Black Widow&quot; b/w &quot;The Son of Hickory Holler&#x27;s Tramp&quot; in 1967, and &quot;Farm Labor Camp #2&quot; were followed by the album &quot;Return of The Fool&quot; in 1968. These would be his last released recordings.
* In 1967, The International Submarine Band recorded &quot;Safe At Home&quot; for the label, which some consider to be the first country rock album. Its release was in 1968, including the releasing of two singles spinning off.
* In 1968, US girl group Honey Ltd. released their debut album on LHI. Another album and five singles releases followed until 1970. After getting a second chance under the name Eve, releasing an album and two singles, Hazlewood dropped the group.
* Hazlewood revived The Shacklefords in 1967 and recorded, being a member, three singles with them.
* Hazlewood&#x27;s then girlfriend Suzi Jane Hokom continued her services as demo-singer and assistant record producer, incidentally releasing records, some being duets.
* In 1967, Hazlewood signed Mike Condello&#x27;s band, named them Last Friday&#x27;s Fire, and released three singles with them.
* Swedish-American actress and singer Ann-Margret released one album, three solo singles and two duets with Hazlewood in 1969.
* In 1969 and 1970 Barbara Randolph issued two singles: &quot;Woman To That Man&quot; and &quot;Miracle On 19th Street&quot;, but both never got beyond the status of promotional recordings. After that it lasted until 1979 for her to record again, for Tamla Motown.
* In a last attempt to revive their career The Surprise Package recorded an album &quot;Free Up&quot; in 1968, which spun off the title track as well as their version of the song &quot;MacArthur Park&quot; as singles releases during 1969.
* Other releases included works from artists such as Malibu&#x27;s Kazoos, Buddy Long, Danny Michaels, Virgil Warner, Billie Dearborn, Michael Gram, Hamilton Streetcar, The Aggregation, Arthur Lee Harper, Lynn Castle, Linda Owens, Bob Kaufmann, Phoenix 70, Barney Carl, Ray Chafin, Jon Christian, Raul Danks and Jon Taylor.
* In 2012, the double album &quot;The LHI Years: Singles, Nudes &amp; Backsides (1968–71)&quot;, containing rarities (B-sides, demos etc.) from the label&#x27;s historical shelves, was released on the Light In The Attic label.

<doc id="928736" wikidata="Q6538613" url="?curid=928736" title="Li-Young Lee">
<text>Li-Young Lee (李立揚, pinyin: Lǐ Lìyáng) (born August 19, 1957) is an American poet. He was born in Jakarta, Indonesia, to Chinese parents. His maternal great-grandfather was Yuan Shikai, China&#x27;s first Republican President, who attempted to make himself emperor. Lee&#x27;s father, who was a personal physician to Mao Zedong while in China, relocated his family to Indonesia, where he helped found Gamaliel University. In 1959 the Lee family fled Indonesia to escape widespread anti-Chinese sentiment and after a five-year trek through Hong Kong and Japan, they settled in the United States in 1964. Li-Young Lee attended the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Arizona, and the State University of New York Brockport.

==Development as a poet==
Lee attended the University of Pittsburgh, where he began to develop his love for writing poems. He had seen his father find his passion for ministry and as a result of his father reading to him and encouraging Lee to find his passion, Lee began to dive into the art of language. Lee&#x27;s writing has also been influenced by classic Chinese poets, such as Li Bai and Du Fu. Many of Lee&#x27;s poems are filled with themes of simplicity, strength, and silence. All are strongly influenced by his family history, childhood, and individuality. He writes with simplicity and passion which creates images that take the reader deeper and also requires his audience to fill in the gaps with their own imagination. These feelings of exile and boldness to rebel take shape as they provide common themes for poems.

In his poem “Hymns to Childhood”, the memories of days past, the lost innocence of a carefree childhood embroiled in a constant turmoil of fear and danger, has etched into the memory of the poet. Lee in his mind, in his eyes, questions the meaning and purpose of the living present or its certainty? As a child, having witnessed the two-extremity meant out on his father, from a revered privileged doctor to an overnight marked dissenter dragged and locked away, had shaken then a child Lee, from which he never fully recovered. Such experiences of his parents and even his father’s conversion to Christianity as a minister upon the soil of his new homeland America, Lee, could only find spiritual refuge in penning down the meaning of life or its roots in the various poetry as his memory reel before his eyes. His family life experiences, and his varied mindset of its journey are left formulated in deep thoughts in poems such as Self-Help for Refugees, Immigrant Blues and Station. None of these compositions record a sound of new life experiences embraced with an iota of joy or excitement of &#x27;new beginnings&#x27;, as the original root had already suddenly been pulled and uprooted for him. 

==Lee&#x27;s influence on Asian American poetry==
Li-Young Lee has been an established Asian American poet who has been doing interviews for the past twenty years. &quot;Breaking the Alabaster Jar: Conversations with Li-Young Lee&quot; (BOA Editions, 2006, ed. Earl G. Ingersoll), is the first edited and published collection of interviews with an Asian American poet. In this book, Earl G. Ingersoll has collected interviews with the poet consisting of &quot;conversational&quot; questions meant to bring out Lee&#x27;s views on Asian American poetry, writing, and identity.

==Awards and honors==
Lee has won numerous poetry awards:
*1986: Delmore Schwartz Memorial Award, from New York University, for &quot;Rose&quot;
*1988: Whiting Award

<doc id="928737" wikidata="Q182106" url="?curid=928737" title="Misty May-Treanor">
<text>Misty Elizabeth May-Treanor (; née May; born July 30, 1977) is an American retired professional beach volleyball player. She is a three-time Olympic gold medalist, and , was the most successful female beach volleyball player having won 112 tournaments in domestic and international competition.

May-Treanor and teammate Kerri Walsh Jennings were gold medalists in beach volleyball at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics. They also won the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Championships in 2003, 2005 and 2007. The pair set various records throughout their partnership, including a win streak of 112 consecutive matches (19 consecutive tournament titles) in 20072008, breaking their own previous record of 89 consecutive match wins. They have been called &quot;the greatest beach volleyball team of all time.&quot;

May-Treanor retired from competitive play on August 8, 2012, after she and Walsh Jennings won gold in the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was inducted into the Volleyball Hall of Fame in 2016.

==Early life and education==
May was born in 1977 in Los Angeles to Barbara (née Grubb), a nationally ranked tennis player, and Butch May, a member of the 1968 United States men&#x27;s national volleyball team. She has two older half brothers, Brack and Scott. She grew up playing beach volleyball with her parents at the Santa Monica Pier, and at age 8 teamed with her father to play in her first beach volleyball tournament. May also played soccer and tennis, as well as participating in dance. She attended primary school at Brightwood Elementary School in Monterey Park and Roosevelt Elementary School in Santa Monica. As a child, she was baby-sat by Karch Kiraly, future national volleyball player and United States women&#x27;s national volleyball team head coach.

In her 2010 autobiography, May-Treanor stated both of her parents were alcoholics. She also asserted her mother would at times become violent when drinking. From the age of 4 to 15, she lived with her grandparents. In 1988, her father committed to living his life sober after an automobile accident in which he struck and nearly killed a motorcyclist.

==Education==
===High school===
May grew up in Costa Mesa, California, attending Newport Harbor High School from 1991 through 1995. She helped her team win the state championship in volleyball in both her sophomore and senior years, 1992 and 1994. During her junior year in 1993 she was named the Division I All-CIF team Player of the Year, and the following year she was selected by &quot;USA Today&quot; as the best high school girls&#x27; volleyball player in the nation.

While at Newport Harbor High she also competed in track and field, excelling in the high jump. At the CIF California State Meet in 1993 she finished second in the high jump to future heptathlete, Tracye Lawyer.

May-Treanor was later inducted into the inaugural class of the Newport Harbor High School&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2014.

===College===
May-Treanor played volleyball for the Long Beach State 49ers from 1995 to 1999. The 1998 team that May captained was the first women&#x27;s NCAA volleyball team to have an undefeated season. She graduated with a BA in kinesiology and fitness in 2002 and was inducted into the Long Beach State Athletics Hall of Fame in 2004.

During her tenure there, she racked up numerous Big West Conference and NCAA awards and honors, including the Honda Sports Award for the nation&#x27;s best female volleyball player, and the Honda-Broderick Cup for the best overall female collegiate athlete for 1998–99, and back-to-back National Player of the Year awards in 1997 and 1998.

====1998 NCAA championship====
As the starting setter in 1998, May-Treanor led Long Beach State University to the Division I NCAA Women&#x27;s Volleyball Championship with a 36–0 record. She shared the NCAA Championship Most Outstanding Player award after setting a tournament record with 20 service aces.

===Graduate school===
She attended Concordia University in Irvine, California to earn a master&#x27;s degree in coaching and athletic administration. Her degree was conferred on May 4, 2013.

==Professional career==
===1999–2000: Early career with Holly McPeak===

May played her first professional match on the AVP tour in May 1999 while still a college senior. After graduating from Long Beach State in 1999, she joined the United States women&#x27;s national volleyball team. After a few months she quit the national team to focus on beach volleyball, teaming with Holly McPeak.

The pair played their first tournament together on the FIVB tour in Salvador, Brazil in November 1999. Seeded 22nd, McPeak/May finished 9th.

The 2000 season saw the team of May and McPeak find success, both in domestic and international competitions. They won their first tournament together in April at a USAV event, followed by two wins on the FIVB tour, and one on the now-defunct BVA. May was selected as the BVA Rookie of the Year for 2000. With three FIVB tournament wins and no finishes lower than 5th, the pair qualified for one of the two US Olympic berths, a goal McPeak was looking for when she first partnered with May. At the 2000 Summer Olympics the pair won in the opening round and in the round of 16 before losing 16–14 in a hard-fought quarterfinal match against Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel of Brazil. The quarterfinal loss left the team in a tie for 5th place at the 2000 summer Olympics.

===2001 to Beijing 2008: Dominance with partner Kerri Walsh===
After completing the 2000 season with McPeak, May teamed up with a new partner Kerri Walsh, playing as a defender behind Walsh&#x27;s block. Rather than play on the newly reformed AVP tour, the duo spent the 2001 and 2002 seasons gaining valuable experience competing on the international FIVB tour. They won their first FIVB tour championship in 2002. In 2003, May and Walsh signed with the AVP. They received &quot;Team of the Year&quot; honors after having an undefeated domestic season, going 39–0 in match victories with eight tournament wins. On the 2003 international tour, May-Treanor and Walsh went 52–4 in match victories.

For nearly the entire period from their initial partnering in 2001, to their respective hiatuses in late 2008, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings dominated both the AVP and FIVB beach volleyball tours. At one point, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings had a win streak of 112 consecutive matches and 19 straight tournaments that lasted from August 2007 to August 2008, breaking their own previous record of 89 consecutive match wins and 15 straight tournaments, set before the 2004 Summer Olympics.

===After Beijing===

Following their gold medal victory at the Beijing Olympics, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings returned to the 2008 AVP Tour. Their win streak of 112 matches was broken with an upset victory by fellow 2008 Olympians Nicole Branagh and Elaine Youngs at the AVP Shootout in Cincinnati, Ohio. May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings lost again on September 7, falling to April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the semifinals of an AVP tournament in Santa Barbara, California, marking the first time since April 2007 that the duo missed reaching an AVP tour final.

For the 2010 season, with Walsh Jennings taking a break from competition for the birth of her second son, May-Treanor teamed up with Branagh. The two won several tournaments together, but struggled for much of the year.

===Injuries===
May-Treanor played much of her 2002 season with a torn PCL before undergoing surgery that September.

Soon after winning her gold medal in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, May-Treanor ruptured her achilles tendon during dance practice for a performance on the show &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;. It was successfully repaired, though she did not return to competition for nearly a year.

==Retirement==
May-Treanor, just prior to teaming with Kerri Walsh Jennings for a third straight gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics, announced that she was retiring from beach volleyball. She confirmed this shortly after the Olympics victory.

==Coaching==
May-Treanor was a member of the women&#x27;s volleyball coaching staff at Irvine Valley College beginning in 2001, though she is no longer listed as a staff member. IVC head coach, Tom Pestolesi, was her high school volleyball coach.

As of July 2016, she serves as the Director of Volleyball at Long Beach City College where she coaches the women&#x27;s indoor and beach volleyball teams. The LBCC indoor and beach teams thrived under her leadership. In the 2016–17 season, the Vikings went 16-5 and won their first conference title in 16 years, also qualifying for the state playoffs where they made it to the second round. For beach, they were successful in their inaugural year, making it to the state finals and having one of the teams win the state title. In the 2017–18 season, the indoor team went 18-5 and again lost in the second round of playoffs.

She also owns a beach volleyball club called Dream in Gold (DIG) to train the next generation of beach volleyball players.

==Olympic history==
===Sydney 2000===
Affected by an abdominal injury in her first Olympics, May finished fifth with partner Holly McPeak in the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

===Athens 2004===
Riding a 90-match win streak, May and Walsh continued their winning ways through the 2004 Summer Olympics. In semifinal play, the pair defeated fellow Americans — and May&#x27;s former partner — Holly McPeak and partner Elaine Youngs. May and Walsh defeated Brazil in the championship match to win the gold medal. The duo did not lose a single set in all seven matches.

===Beijing 2008===
On August 21, May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings repeated as Olympic gold medalists, defeating the first-seeded Chinese team in two games. They are the only beach volleyball team to repeat as gold medalists. May-Treanor was named the Most Outstanding Player for the women&#x27;s competition.

===London 2012===
May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings competed in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In the preliminary round, they extended their Olympic winning streak to 32 consecutive sets without a loss with wins over Australia and the Czech Republic. The streak came to an end when they lost their first set to the Schwaiger sisters from Austria; May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings went on to win the match 17–21, 21–8,
15–10.

May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings defeated fellow Americans April Ross and Jennifer Kessy in the final to claim the gold medal (21–16, 21–16).

==Politics and philanthropy==
May-Treanor serves as a Sports Ambassador for Special Olympics Southern California.

==Personal life==
May began dating professional baseball catcher, Matt Treanor, in January 2004. The two later wed in November of that year. She and her husband reside in Yorba Linda, CA. May-Treanor gave birth to the couple&#x27;s first child, Malia Barbara, on June 3, 2014. The couple later gave birth to fraternal twin girls, Mele Elizarin and Mia Kanoelani, on November 9, 2017.

Both May-Treanor&#x27;s maternal aunt, Betty Ann Grubb Stuart, and maternal first cousin, Taylor Dent, were professional tennis players.

In her 2010 memoir, May-Treanor revealed she had been sexually assaulted while in college, pressed charges against her assailant, and testified at the trial.

A tattoo on May-Treanor&#x27;s shoulder of an angel with the initials &quot;B.M.&quot; is a dedication to her mother, Barbara May, who died of cancer in 2002.

==Television and film appearances==
May-Treanor has made numerous minor television appearances, including &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot;, episodes of &quot;&quot;, &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;, and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

In 2008, she competed in season 7 of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; with partner, Maksim Chmerkovskiy. May-Treanor ruptured her Achilles tendon during a training session for the show, and was consequently forced to withdraw from the competition.

Following the 2008 Olympics, May-Treanor appeared in an episode of the Disney series &quot;Wizards of Waverly Place&quot;. On August 14, 2012, she appeared on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;.

May-Treanor appeared alongside Jennifer Kessy in the season 9 episode of &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot; as chef&#x27;s table guest in the red kitchen.

<doc id="928738" wikidata="Q2378884" url="?curid=928738" title="Idioteque">
<text>&quot;Idioteque&quot; is a song by the English rock band Radiohead, released on their fourth album, &quot;Kid A&quot; (2000). Radiohead developed it while experimenting with modular synthesisers. It contains samples of two 1970s computer music compositions.

&quot;Idioteque&quot; was named one of the best songs of the decade by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2021, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it number 48 on their list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

A live version appears on the 2001 album &quot;I Might Be Wrong: Live Recordings&quot;. &quot;Idioteque&quot; was included on &quot;&quot; (2008).

==Recording==
The Radiohead singer, Thom Yorke, described &quot;Idioteque&quot; as &quot;an attempt to capture that exploding beat sound where you&#x27;re at the club and the PA&#x27;s so loud, you know it&#x27;s doing damage&quot;.

The song began with an electronic rhythm created by Jonny Greenwood. Greenwood created a drum machine using synthesiser modules similar to those available in the 1970s, using components such as filters to create and shape sounds. Feeling the rhythm &quot;needed chaos&quot;, he experimented with found sounds and sampling. He recorded 50 minutes of improvisation and gave it to Yorke, who took a short sequence and used it to write the song. Yorke said: &quot;Some of it was just &#x27;what?&#x27;, but then there was this section of about 40 seconds long in the middle of it that was absolute genius, and I just cut that up.&quot;

As with other songs on &quot;Kid A&quot;, Yorke created lyrics by cutting up phrases and drawing them from a hat. In the second chorus, his vocals are rearranged so that he seems to say &quot;the first of the children&quot; in 5/4, creating a grouping dissonance against the original 4/4 chorus.

=== Samples ===

Greenwood could not remember where the four-chord synthesiser phrase had come from, and assumed he had played it himself. He later realised he had sampled it from , a computer music piece by the American composer Paul Lansky. Lansky wrote during 197374 at Princeton University on an IBM mainframe computer using Music 360 and FM synthesis. It was released on the 1976 compilation &quot;Electronic Music Winners&quot;, which Greenwood discovered in a second-hand record shop while Radiohead were touring the US.

Lansky allowed Radiohead to use the sample after Greenwood wrote to him with a copy of &quot;Idioteque&quot;. In an essay about the experience, Lansky wrote that he found Radiohead&#x27;s use of the sample &quot;imaginative and inventive&quot; and that he had himself &quot;sampled&quot; the chord progression by using the Tristan chord. &quot;Idioteque&quot; also samples another composition from &quot;Electronic Music Winners&quot;, &quot;Short Piece&quot;, by Arthur Kreiger, who became a professor of music at Connecticut College.

== Reception ==
The critic Simon Reynolds wrote that &quot;Idioteque&quot; &quot;does for the modern dance what PiL and Joy Division&#x27;s &#x27;She&#x27;s Lost Control&#x27; did for disco. Call it bleak house or glum &#x27;n&#x27; bass, but the track works through the contrast between Yorke&#x27;s tremulous hyperemotionality and the rigid grid of rhythm.&quot; Keith Cameron of &quot;NME&quot; wrote that despite its &quot;naff&quot; title and &quot;gauche&quot; attempt at creating &quot;garage-noir&quot;, &quot;Idioteque&quot; was &quot;a nonetheless brilliantly persuasive two-step litany of paranoia, fear and unease. Yorke sings it like he means it.&quot;

Tom Ewing of &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot; dismissed &quot;Idioteque&quot; as a &quot;plain awful, a piss-poor&quot; imitation of the 1999 Aphex Twin track &#x27;&quot;Windowlicker&quot;, with &quot;Yorke yammering excruciatingly over the top&quot;. However, the Rock&#x27;s Backpages reviewer Barney Hoskyns wrote that while &quot;Idioteque&quot; was arguably too derivative of Aphex Twin, it contributed &quot;something irresistibly powerful to the [Aphex Twin] template&quot;. Brent DiCrescenzo of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that it &quot;clicks and thuds like Aphex Twin and Bjork&#x27;s &quot;Homogenic&quot;, revealing brilliant new frontiers for the &#x27;band&#x27;.&quot; The &quot;Q&quot; reviewer Stuart Maconie wrote that listeners expecting a &quot;cheesy ATB-style trance anthem&quot; would be disappointed by the &quot;whiny, metallic attack&quot; and anxious refrain, resulting in a song that is &quot;about as uplifting as Mandrax&quot;.

&quot;Idioteque&quot; was named the eighth-best song of the decade by &quot;Pitchfork&quot; and the 56th-best by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. In 2018, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it the 33rd-greatest song of the century so far. In 2021 and 2024, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Idioteque&quot; number 48 on its lists of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, describing it as &quot;the foreboding, spellbinding centrepiece of &quot;Kid A&quot;&quot;.

==Cover versions==
In July 2010, Amanda Palmer released a cover of &quot;Idioteque&quot; as the first single from her Radiohead covers album; her cover was National Public Radio&#x27;s Song of the Day for January 11, 2011. In 2010, Yoav used a loop pedal to build a layered acoustic version.

<doc id="928750" wikidata="Q676104" url="?curid=928750" title="A2 motorway (Switzerland)">
<text>The A2 (the Gotthard Motorway) is a motorway in Switzerland. It forms Switzerland&#x27;s main north–south axis from Basel to Chiasso, meandering with a slight drift toward the east. It lies on the Gotthard axis and crosses the Alps. Opened in 1955 under the name &quot;Road Lucerne-south&quot;, A2 is one of the busiest motorways in Switzerland.

The A2 motorway leaves Basel heading south toward Olten, Sursee, Luzern, Stans, Altdorf, Erstfeld, Göschenen, Airolo, Biasca, Bellinzona, Lugano and reaches Chiasso. It intersects with the A1, A8, A13 and A14 motorways.

The St. Gotthard Tunnel lies at the heart of the motorway and makes up its culminating point. With a maximum elevation of at the tunnel&#x27;s highest point, the A2 motorway has the lowest maximum elevation of any direct north–south road through the Alps. Traffic jams stretching for kilometres on end are frequently found on both entrances of the tunnel, but more frequently on the northern flank. The difficulty with driving through the St. Gotthard tunnel is that it is a motorway tunnel with one lane per direction, but without a central reservation. So far, The Swiss government has decided to upgrade the second tunnel into a full road tunnel in order to allow for the necessary reconstruction of the first road tunnel. Once the works on the first tunnel are finished, the Swiss government plans to operate one single lane in each tunnel (northbound traffic in the newly constructed tunnel, southbound traffic in the renovated one) in order to maintain the current tunnel overall capacity, in compliance with the Swiss constitutional norm that forbids a further growth of the traffic capacity across the Alps. The reconstruction would have lasted for several years in any variant – one variant would push the traffic over the mountain pass, another proposed to load the vehicles onto trains with a new terminal, a third would close the tunnel for several months every year over time range of a decade. All of these have their drawbacks and the usage of the second tunnel was chosen as the best option to allow for the reconstruction. Further usage of both tunnels was subject to a popular referendum that was held in February 2016, where it was approved. The actual upgrade mining of the second road tunnel would last from 2020 to 2027 at a cost of 2.7 billion francs for the whole project including the following reconstruction of the first tunnel.

Near Lucerne, this motorway passes through the Sonnenberg Tunnel, which until recently was the world&#x27;s largest nuclear blast shelter.

<doc id="928751" wikidata="Q7126541" url="?curid=928751" title="Palaestra at Delphi">
<text>The [[palaestra]] at Delphi is part of a gymnasium at the sanctuary. It is the oldest existing gymnasium from the Greek world, dating to the second half of the fourth century B.C. It was built on two terraces, with the palaestra and baths on the lower terrace. The frequent earthquakes and landslides at Delphi have damaged the palaestra the most seriously of all of the gymnasium areas.

The palaestra is small, measuring thirty-two metres square. The central court is 14 metres square with an Ionic peristyle in blue limestone. The eastern wall of the palaestra is formed by the retaining wall for the terrace above. Several rooms open onto the north and west sides of the court. There are three rooms of identical dimensions (8 X 5.80 meters) along the north side of the palaestra. The middle of the three rooms was faced with two columns &quot;in antis&quot; and divided by a wall pierced with a door. Along the west side of the building there are also three rooms. The large room in the northwest corner measures 11 by 6.80 metres. Moving south, the two other rooms measure 7 by 10.70 and 11.50 by 10.70 meters, respectively.

For the most part, the uses of these rooms cannot be determined. Inscriptions have been found indicating that among these rooms were an &quot;apodyterion&quot; (undressing room) and two &quot;sphairisteria&quot; (ball play courts or rooms). The other rooms would certainly have included an &quot;elaiothesion&quot; (oiling room) and &quot;konisterion&quot; (dusting room), as dust (i.e. powder in the form of fine sand) and oil were essential parts of the athletic regime (the wrestlers anointed themselves with oil and sprinkled themselves with fine sand).

The palaestra itself did not include any bathing rooms because a bathing facility was built directly to the north along the same terrace. A corridor in the north side of the palaestra leads to the baths. The bathhouse or &quot;loutrón&quot; had eleven animal head spouts, through which water flowed from a nearby spring into ten basins and a large plunge bath 9.70 metres in diameter and 1.904 metres deep.

<doc id="928756" wikidata="Q2947026" url="?curid=928756" title="Cesare Previti">
<text>Cesare Previti (born 21 October 1934 in Reggio Calabria) is a former Italian politician, disbarred lawyer, and convicted criminal. Along with Marcello Dell&#x27;Utri, he was a close friend and right-hand of Silvio Berlusconi and founder of Forza Italia (FI).

==Biography==
Born in Reggio Calabria, he grew up in Rome, where he started practicing law. In 1971 he became acquainted with Silvio Berlusconi, the construction magnate, later to be media mogul and Prime Minister of Italy. He was the administrator of the property of a nineteen-year-old girl, whose father, the Marquess Casati Stampa, had killed her mother and her mother&#x27;s lover before committing suicide in a celebrated case. In this capacity, he engineered the sale of her villa in Arcore to Berlusconi, for 500 million lire, paid in the form of shares in then-unquoted companies. Many people would later cry foul, claiming that the amount was insufficient by far. In the end, she found herself forced to sell back the shares to Berlusconi and Previti for 250 million lire, half their previous value. After that, Previti worked for Berlusconi&#x27;s own Fininvest company, and acquired a reputation as a ruthless but extremely capable lawyer.

In 1994, after Berlusconi had founded his Forza Italia political party, Previti won election to the Senate. Berlusconi, upon forming his first Cabinet, had wanted him as Minister of Justice, but President of the Republic Oscar Luigi Scalfaro was opposed on account of Previti&#x27;s allegedly shady dealings, so ultimately it was decided he should exchange portfolios with Alfredo Biondi, who had been earmarked for Defence. Thus Previti became the Minister of Defence in Berlusconi&#x27;s first government, from May to December 1994 (serving until January 1995 as caretaker).

Previti was elected to the Chamber of Deputies, again for Forza Italia, both in 1996 and in 2001, but was investigated, together with Berlusconi, for allegedly bribing judges in a series of high-profile cases relating to his years of service as Berlusconi&#x27;s attorney before entering politics. Previti strenuously defended his record, claiming the judges were politically motivated.

== SME trial ==

In the &quot;Sme&quot; case, he was sentenced to five years in jail on 22 November 2003 but he appealed and remained free. On 2 December 2005 he was condemned again and sentenced to five years, but he appealed once more. On 30 November 2006 the verdict was invalidated by the Corte di Cassazione, on the ground that the Milan court did not have jurisdiction to try the case. The case has been transferred to Perugia. The prescription term, however, was very close (April 2007). He is accused of corrupting judge Renato Squillante: the sum of about $434,000 was transferred from Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s personal account to one of his lawyer Previti&#x27;s accounts and later to the judge&#x27;s account.

== IMI-SIR trial ==
In the &quot;Imi-Sir&quot; case, he was sentenced to eleven years in jail on 29 April 2003 and he appealed. He was later sentenced to seven years on 23 May 2005 but he appealed again.

=== Final conviction ===
On 4 May 2006, he was definitely sentenced by the Court of Cassation to six years.

==House Arrests==
Thanks to laws passed by Silvio Berlusconi government, at the time of his arrest, he was already old enough to ask to have his prison time turned into house arrest. The change was carried out on 10 May 2006. Previti had spent only few days in prison.
In both cases, he was also forbidden to run for or hold public offices. On 11 December 2006 he was charged with defamation. He had accused judges of hiding evidence in previous Berlusconi trials. Milan court judges were found not guilty by the Brescia court, which later opened a case against Previti.
He finally resigned under great pressure from the Chamber of Deputies on 31 July 2007.

<text>André Philippus Brink (29 May 1935 – 6 February 2015) was a South African novelist, essayist and poet. He wrote in both Afrikaans and English and taught English at the University of Cape Town.

In the 1960s Brink, Ingrid Jonker, Etienne Leroux and Breyten Breytenbach were key figures in the significant Afrikaans dissident intellectual and literary movement known as &quot;Die Sestigers&quot; (&quot;The Sixty-ers&quot;). These writers sought to expose the Afrikaner people to world literature, to use the Afrikaans language to speak out against the extreme Afrikaner nationalist and white supremacist National Party-controlled government, and also to introduce literary modernism, postmodernist literature, magic realism and other global trends into Afrikaans literature. While André Brink&#x27;s early novels were especially concerned with his own opposition to apartheid, his later work engaged the new questions of life in South Africa since the end of National Party rule in 1994.

== Biography ==
Brink was born in Vrede, in the Free State. Brink moved to Lydenburg, where he matriculated at Hoërskool Lydenburg in 1952 with seven distinctions, the second student from the then Transvaal to achieve this feat and studied Afrikaans literature in the Potchefstroom University of South Africa. His immense attachment with literature carried him to France from 1959 to 1961, where he got his degree from Sorbonne University in Paris in comparative literature.

During his stay, he came across an undeniable fact that changed his mind forever: black students were treated on an equal social basis with other students. Back in South Africa, he became one of the most prominent young Afrikaans writers, along with the novelist Etienne Leroux and the poet Breyten Breytenbach, to challenge the apartheid policy of the National party through his writings. During a second journey in France between 1967 and 1968, he hardened his political position against Apartheid and began writing both in Afrikaans and English to enlarge his audience and outplay the censure he was facing in his native country at the time.

Indeed, his novel &quot;Kennis van die aand&quot; (1973) was the first Afrikaans book to be banned by the South African government. André Brink translated &quot;Kennis van die aand&quot; into English and published it abroad as &quot;Looking on Darkness&quot;. This was his first self-translation. After that, André Brink wrote his works simultaneously in English and Afrikaans. In 1975, he obtained his PhD in Literature at Rhodes University.

In 2008, in an echo of a scene from his novel &quot;A Chain of Voices&quot;, his family was beset by tragedy, when his nephew Adri Brink was murdered in front of his wife and children in their Gauteng home.

Brink died on a flight from Amsterdam to South Africa, having visited Belgium to receive an honorary doctorate from the Belgian Francophone Université Catholique de Louvain. He was married five times. Brink&#x27;s son, Anton Brink, is an artist.

<text>Brian Thomas Littrell (; born February 20, 1975) is an American singer and a member of the Backstreet Boys. He is also a contemporary Christian music artist and released the solo album &quot;Welcome Home&quot; in 2006. He is the father of country singer Baylee Littrell.

In 2015, Littrell was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame along with his cousin and bandmate Kevin Richardson.

==Early life==
Littrell was born in Lexington, Kentucky, to Jacqueline &quot;Jackie&quot; R. (née Fox), a dentist&#x27;s secretary, and Harold Baker Littrell Jr, an IBM employee. He has an older brother, Harold III, who is an actor and singer. Littrell is the cousin of fellow Backstreet Boys member Kevin Richardson; his father, Harold, and Richardson&#x27;s mother, Ann, are siblings.

Littrell was skilled at sports and played in both Little League and the Babe Ruth League. Growing up in a religious Baptist family, he sang his first solo in Porter Memorial Baptist Church at age 7, and was voted President of the Youth Chorus by his peers one year. At 14, he began performing at weddings after Barry Turner, his choir teacher at Tates Creek High School, suggested he could make money singing at social events. Littrell also performed in school plays including a production of &quot;Grease&quot;, and worked at fast food chain Long John Silver&#x27;s.

Littrell aspired to become a basketball player. However, he was seldom selected for high school tournaments at . He also aspired to become a music minister.

In April 1993, Littrell&#x27;s cousin and future bandmate Kevin Richardson called him out of an American History class and informed him of an audition for a fifth member of the Backstreet Boys. A spot in the group had opened up when Burk Parsons left the group due to his desire to become a Christian minister. Littrell flew to Orlando the next day and finished high school via correspondence, graduating in 1994.

== Career ==
=== Backstreet Boys ===

In 1997, Littrell was instrumental in bringing a lawsuit against the group&#x27;s creator Lou Pearlman, claiming Pearlman had concealed information regarding the group&#x27;s earnings. Bandmates AJ McLean, Richardson, and Howie Dorough joined the lawsuit, which eventually resulted in a number of settlements, details of which were not disclosed. In 2000, he was among &quot;Teen People&quot;&#x27;s 25 Hottest People Under 25, tying with Justin Timberlake of rival band *NSYNC.

=== Christian music ===

Littrell longed to record Christian music, a genre he described as &quot;pop positive.&quot; In 2004, Littrell signed a solo deal with Reunion Records and released the solo album &quot;Welcome Home&quot; in 2005. Littrell co-wrote six of the songs on the album, which sold over 100,000 copies in the US and reached No. 74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts. On the Christian album charts, &quot;Welcome Home&quot; debuted at No. 3. Four singles were released from the album – &quot;In Christ Alone,&quot; &quot;Wish,&quot; &quot;Over My Head&quot; and Welcome Home (You)&quot;, with the latter reaching No. 2 on the US Christian AC Charts. For three weeks, it was also No. 1 on Reach FM&#x27;s Top 40 chart and on the US R&amp;R Christian Inspirational charts. In the summer of 2005, his solo single, &quot;In Christ Alone&quot;, went to No. 1 on the Christian charts. Despite this change in his career, he remains a member of the Backstreet Boys.

Littrell won a Dove Award for Inspirational Recorded Song of the Year (&quot;In Christ Alone&quot;) in 2006 along with songwriters Don Koch and Shawn Craig, and another in 2008 for &quot;By His Wounds&quot; with Glory Revealed. He also won Special Event Album of the Year in 2008 for Glory Revealed, which was a compilation album with many other Christian artists, and in 2010, Special Event Album of the Year for &quot;Glory Revealed II&quot;.

Littrell released two Christmas collections featuring his wife Leighanne and son Baylee, &quot;Brian Littrell&#x27;s Family Christmas&quot;, released on December 6, 2010, and &quot;Christmas with the Littrells&quot;, released on December 6, 2011.

=== TV and film appearances ===
Littrell made appearances with the Backstreet Boys on &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, and he and bandmate McLean had cameos in &quot;Olive Juice&quot;, a film starring Littrell&#x27;s wife Leighanne. Littrell also performed with The Backstreet Boys on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, in 1998 and 1999. In 2013, Littrell appeared with his bandmates in the film &quot;This Is the End&quot;.

=== Other ventures ===
During the band&#x27;s hiatus, Littrell became committed to a number of other show business activities, most of them for charity. He has joined other celebrities in yearly NBA tours where he played basketball in every NBA city before a game, and has also played charity baseball, softball and golf games.

== Personal life ==
===Relationships===
In June 1997, following the breakup of his relationship with girlfriend Samantha Stonebraker, Littrell met an actress and model, Leighanne Reena Wallace, on the set of &quot;As Long as You Love Me&quot; video shoot where she was an extra. Littrell stated in J-14 magazine about this relationship that he had been out of the dating game for a while and meeting Leighanne opened a whole new chapter for him. &quot;I had just gotten out of a relationship with a high school sweetheart that didn&#x27;t work out. I didn&#x27;t really have my eyes or mind set on anybody. It was something that just happened. If I was looking, I wouldn&#x27;t have been able to find her.&quot; Littrell and Wallace dated for two years, and he proposed to her on Christmas 1999. Their engagement, along with the engagement of cousin and bandmate Kevin Richardson to Kristin Willits, was announced on MTV on February 15, 2000. The couple married on September 2, 2000, at Peachtree Christian Church in Atlanta.

On September 11, 2001, Leighanne was scheduled to board American Airlines Flight 11, which later was hijacked and flown into the World Trade Center as part of the 9/11 attacks. Leighanne Littrell had canceled her flight the previous night. On November 26, 2002, they had their son Baylee Thomas Wylee Littrell, who is now pursuing a similar path as his father&#x27;s in the entertainment industry.

As of 2024, the family lives in Alpharetta, Georgia, near Atlanta, having been there since 2000, soon after Littrell and his wife got engaged.

Littrell stated during a show in Georgia on the DNA World Tour that his wife lost her mother from a heart condition in June 2022 and was a matriarch to him and the family.

=== Health issues ===
Littrell was born with a congenital heart condition, making him susceptible to infections. He was diagnosed with a heart murmur when he was six weeks old. At age five, he was hospitalized for two months due to a bacterial infection. Due to his hospitalization, Littrell was held back in school and had to repeat the first grade.

In November 1997, doctors found that Littrell&#x27;s heart condition had caused his heart to enlarge considerably. Littrell postponed open-heart surgery to meet touring obligations. He underwent open heart surgery on May 8, 1998. Littrell&#x27;s surgery was referred to in his scenes in the band&#x27;s music video for &quot;Show Me the Meaning of Being Lonely.&quot; He later established the Brian Littrell Healthy Heart Club, a non-profit organization assisting children with heart conditions.

In October 2009, Littrell became infected with swine flu, causing the cancellation of the Backstreet Boys &quot;This Is Us&quot; promotional tour.

In the 2015 documentary film, Littrell revealed his 2011 diagnosis of vocal tension dysphonia and dystonia. He has worked with a therapist to help improve his condition.

=== Religious beliefs ===
A devout Christian, Littrell has stated he believes Christians have to be open about their faith, saying, &quot;I think as Christians we need to join hands and mount up together and lift God up and talk about our faith publicly and talk about all of the things God has done for us in our life to touch other people.&quot; Littrell, who has been born again since the age of 8, has said that he attributes his success in life to God and that his faith has always been &quot;the utmost important thing&quot; in his life.

===Heritage===
In 2019, a DNA heritage test revealed Littrell&#x27;s ancestry to be 90.1% British Isles (20.7% English and 70.1% Irish/Scottish/Welsh), plus 7.1% Finnish and 2.1% Scandinavian.

<text>Lake Manitou is the largest lake on Manitoulin Island in Ontario, Canada. With an area of ,
it is the largest lake on a lake island in the world.
Reaching depths of up to 162 ft, it is also the deepest of the 108 lakes on Manitoulin Island. Lake Manitou&#x27;s depth creates a natural habitat for lake trout and ling, making it a popular fishing destination. Other fish including bass, whitefish, pickerel, and pike are also seen throughout the deep, clear waters. It is drained by the Manitou River. 

There are several small islands in Lake Manitou, such as Roper Island and Bear Island in the very south of the western lobe of the lake, and McCracken&#x27;s Island in the neck connecting the two lobes, making them islands in a lake on an island in a lake. However, none of the islands are as large as Treasure Island in a neighbouring, smaller lake on Manitoulin Island.

<doc id="928779" wikidata="Q536351" url="?curid=928779" title="First principle">
<text>In philosophy and science, a first principle is a basic proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. First principles in philosophy are from first cause attitudes and taught by Aristotelians, and nuanced versions of first principles are referred to as postulates by Kantians.

In mathematics and formal logic, first principles are referred to as axioms or postulates. In physics and other sciences, theoretical work is said to be from first principles, or &quot;ab initio&quot;, if it starts directly at the level of established science and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and parameter fitting. &quot;First principles thinking&quot; consists of decomposing things down to the fundamental axioms in the given arena, before reasoning up by asking which ones are relevant to the question at hand, then cross referencing conclusions based on chosen axioms and making sure conclusions do not violate any fundamental laws. Physicists include counterintuitive concepts with reiteration.

==In formal logic==
In a formal logical system, that is, a set of propositions that are consistent with one another, it is possible that some of the statements can be deduced from other statements. For example, in the syllogism, &quot;All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Socrates is mortal&quot; the last claim can be deduced from the first two.

A first principle is an axiom that cannot be deduced from any other within that system. The classic example is that of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;; its hundreds of geometric propositions can be deduced from a set of definitions, postulates, and primitive notions: all three types constitute first principles.

==Philosophy==
In philosophy, &quot;first principles&quot; are from first cause attitudes commonly referred to as &quot;a priori&quot; terms and arguments, which are contrasted to &quot;a posteriori&quot; terms, reasoning, or arguments, in that the former are simply assumed and exist prior to the reasoning process, and the latter are deduced or inferred after the initial reasoning process. First principles are generally treated in the realm of philosophy known as epistemology but are an important factor in any metaphysical speculation.

In philosophy, &quot;first principles&quot; are often somewhat synonymous with &quot;a priori&quot;, datum, and axiomatic reasoning.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
In Ancient Greek philosophy, a first principle from which other principles are derived is called an &quot;arche&quot; and later &quot;first principle&quot; or &quot;element&quot;. By extension, it may mean &quot;first place&quot;, &quot;method of government&quot;, &quot;empire, realm&quot;, &quot;authorities&quot; The concept of an &quot;arche&quot; was adapted from the earliest cosmogonies of Hesiod and Orphism, through the physical theories of Pre-Socratic philosophy and Plato before being formalized as a part of metaphysics by Aristotle. &quot;Arche&quot; sometimes also transcribed as &quot;arkhé&quot;) is an Ancient Greek word with primary senses &quot;beginning&quot;, &quot;origin&quot; or &quot;source of action&quot;: from the beginning, οr the original argument, &quot;command&quot;. The first principle or element corresponds to the &quot;ultimate underlying substance&quot; and &quot;ultimate indemonstrable principle&quot;.

====Mythical cosmogonies====
The heritage of Greek mythology already embodied the desire to articulate reality as a whole and this universalizing impulse was fundamental for the first projects of speculative theorizing. It appears that the order of &quot;being&quot; was first imaginatively visualized before it was abstractly thought.

In the mythological cosmogonies of the Near East, the universe is formless and empty and the only existing thing prior to creation was the water abyss. In the Babylonian creation story, Enuma Elish, the primordial world is described as a &quot;watery chaos&quot; from which everything else appeared. This watery chaos has similarities in the cosmogony of the Greek mythographer Pherecydes of Syros. In the mythical Greek cosmogony of Hesiod (8th to 7th century BC), the origin of the world is Chaos, considered as a divine primordial condition, from which everything else appeared. In the creation &quot;chaos&quot; is a gaping-void, but later the word is used to describe the space between the Earth and the sky, after their separation. &quot;Chaos&quot; may mean infinite space, or a formless matter which can be differentiated. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality. The conception of the &quot;divine&quot; as an origin influenced the first Greek philosophers. In the Orphic cosmogony, the unaging Chronos produced Aether and Chaos and made in divine Aether a silvery egg, from which everything else appeared.

====Ionian school====
The earliest Pre-Socratic philosophers, the Ionian material monists, sought to explain all of nature (physis) in terms of one unifying &quot;arche.&quot; Among the material monists were the three Milesian philosophers: Thales, who believed that everything was composed of water; Anaximander, who believed it was &quot;apeiron&quot;; and Anaximenes, who believed it was air. This is considered as a permanent substance or either one or more which is conserved in the generation of rest of it. From this all things first come to be and into this they are resolved in a final state. This source of entity is always preserved. Although their theories were primitive, these philosophers were the first to give an explanation of the physical world without referencing the supernatural; this opened the way for much of modern science (and philosophy), which has the same goal of explaining the world without dependence on the supernatural.

Thales of Miletus (7th to 6th century BC), the father of philosophy, claimed that the first principle of all things is water, and considered it as a substance that contains in it motion and change. His theory was supported by the observation of moisture throughout the world and coincided with his theory that the Earth floated on water. His ideas were influenced by the Near-Eastern mythological cosmogony and probably by the Homeric statement that the surrounding Oceanus (ocean) is the source of all springs and rivers.

Anaximander argued that water could not be the arche, because it could not give rise to its opposite, fire. Anaximander claimed that none of the elements (earth, fire, air, water) could be arche for the same reason. Instead, he proposed the existence of the apeiron, an indefinite substance from which all things are born and to which all things will return. &quot;Apeiron&quot; (endless or boundless) is something completely indefinite; and Anaximander was probably influenced by the original &quot;chaos&quot; of Hesiod (yawning abyss).

Anaximander was the first philosopher that used &quot;arche&quot; for that which writers from Aristotle onwards called &quot;the substratum&quot; (Simplicius Phys. 150, 22). He probably intended it to mean primarily &quot;indefinite in kind&quot; but assumed it also to be &quot;of unlimited extent and duration&quot;. The notion of temporal infinity was familiar to the Greek mind from remote antiquity in the religious conception of immortality and Anaximander&#x27;s description was in terms appropriate to this conception. This &quot;arche&quot; is called &quot;eternal and ageless&quot;. (Hippolitus I,6, I;DK B2)

Anaximenes, Anaximander&#x27;s pupil, advanced yet another theory. He returns to the elemental theory, but this time posits air, rather than water, as the arche and ascribes to it divine attributes. He was the first recorded philosopher who provided a theory of change and supported it with observation. Using two contrary processes of rarefaction and condensation (thinning or thickening), he explains how air is part of a series of changes. Rarefied air becomes fire, condensed it becomes first wind, then cloud, water, earth, and stone in order. The &quot;arche&quot; is technically what underlies all of reality/appearances.

====Aristotle====
Terence Irwin writes:
===Modern philosophy===
====Descartes====
Profoundly influenced by Euclid, Descartes was a rationalist who invented the foundationalist system of philosophy. He used the &quot;method of doubt&quot;, now called Cartesian doubt, to systematically doubt everything he could possibly doubt until he was left with what he saw as purely indubitable truths. Using these self-evident propositions as his axioms, or foundations, he went on to deduce his entire body of knowledge from them. The foundations are also called &quot;a priori&quot; truths. His most famous proposition is &quot;Je pense, donc je suis&quot; (&quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, or &quot;Cogito ergo sum&quot;), which he indicated in his Discourse on the Method was &quot;the first principle of the philosophy of which I was in search.&quot;

Descartes describes the concept of a first principle in the following excerpt from the preface to the &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644):
== In physics ==

In physics, a calculation is said to be &quot;from first principles&quot;, or &quot;ab initio&quot;, if it starts directly at the level of established laws of physics and does not make assumptions such as empirical model and fitting parameters.

For example, calculation of electronic structure using Schrödinger&#x27;s equation within a set of approximations that do not include fitting the model to experimental data is an &quot;ab initio&quot; approach.

<doc id="928781" wikidata="Q7098797" url="?curid=928781" title="Optic nerve hypoplasia">
<text>Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a medical condition arising from the underdevelopment (hypoplasia) of the optic nerve(s). This condition is the most common congenital optic nerve anomaly. The optic disc appears abnormally small, because not all the optic nerve axons have developed properly. It is often associated with endocrinopathies (hormone deficiencies), developmental delay, and brain malformations. The optic nerve, which is responsible for transmitting visual signals from the retina to the brain, has approximately 1.2 million nerve fibers in the average person. In those diagnosed with ONH, however, there are noticeably fewer nerves.

==Symptoms==
ONH may be found in isolation or in conjunction with myriad functional and anatomic abnormalities of the central nervous system. Nearly 80% of those affected with ONH will experience hypothalamic dysfunction and/or impaired development of the brain, regardless of MRI findings or severity of ONH.

===Vision===
ONH can be unilateral (in one eye) or bilateral (in both eyes), though it presents most often bilaterally (80%). Unilateral cases tend to have better vision and are typically diagnosed at a later age than bilateral cases. Visual acuity can range from no light perception to near-normal vision.

Children diagnosed with ONH generally present with vision problems which include nystagmus (involuntary movement of the eyes), which tends to develop at 1 to 3 months and/or strabismus (inability to align both eyes simultaneously), manifested during the first year of life.

The majority of children affected experience improvement in vision during the first few years of life, though the reason for this occurrence is unknown. There have been no reported cases of decline in vision due to ONH.

===Neuroradiographic abnormalities===
Estimates of cerebral malformations vary from 39% to 90% of children with ONH. Abnormalities evident via neuroradiography can include agenesis (absence) or hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, absence or incomplete development of the septum pellucidum, malformations of the pituitary gland, schizencephaly, cortical heterotopia, white matter hypoplasia, pachygyria, and holoprosencephaly. Hypoplasia of the corpus callosum, often in conjunction with other major malformations, is significantly associated with poor and delayed developmental outcome.

ONH is often referred to as septo-optic dysplasia, a term that refers to agenesis of the septum pellucidum. It is now clear that the absence of the septum pellucidum does not correlate with the associated symptoms of ONH.

===Hypothalamic dysfunction===
Dysfunction of the hypothalamus results in loss of regulation over behavior and function of the pituitary gland (master gland). Hypopituitarism is present in 75% to 80% of patients with ONH. The anterior pituitary gland contributes to growth, metabolism, and sexual development. The most common pituitary endocrinopathies are growth hormone (GH) deficiency (70%), hypothyroidism (43%), adrenal insufficiency (27%), and diabetes insipidus (5%).

Absence of GH may often be indicated by short stature, although this is not always the case. Other indicators of GH deficiency may include hypoglycemic events (including seizures), prolonged jaundice, micropenis in boys, and delayed dentition. Testing for GH may involve blood tests (IGF-1 and IGFBP-3), growth hormone stimulation test, or bone age x-ray of the hand or wrist (or body for children younger than 2 years).

A poorly functioning pituitary gland may also cause a lack of thyroid hormone, leading to central hypothyroidism. Thyroid hormone is critical for growth and brain development, especially during the first few weeks to months of life. Children with untreated hypothyroidism are at high risk of mental retardation; thus, early detection is crucial. Central hypothyroidism can be diagnosed by a low or normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in the presence of a low level of free T4. Free T-4 should be checked annually for at least four years.

Cortisol is made in times of stress. Approximately one-quarter of patients with ONH have adrenal insufficiency, meaning they do not produce enough cortisol on a daily basis or in stressful situations.

Imbalances in sex hormone may result in a delay in sexual development (puberty) or precocious puberty. Sex hormones may be tested from birth to 6 months of age (during mini-puberty).

Hyperprolactinemia (an excess of prolactin) often occurs in conjunction with ONH and indicates either dysfunction of the hypothalamus or a disconnect between the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Hyperprolactinemia often correlates with development of obesity in children with ONH.

The posterior pituitary gland produces anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which controls outflow of water from the body by urine. ADH deficiency, also known as diabetes insipidus (DI), results in dehydration and high sodium levels in the body from excessive urination. Testing for DI involves blood and urine testing, including water deprivation tests, to determine ADH creation levels by the body. DI may be treated with a medication called desmopressin acetate (DDAVP).

Oxytocin is also produced in the posterior pituitary gland. Though best known for its role in childbirth and lactation, oxytocin has also been found to have a role in human bonding, increase in trust, and decrease in fear.

Hypothalamic dysfunction may also result in problems with feeding, sleep, and body temperature regulation. Feeding behaviors in children with ONH often include hyperphagia (overeating), resulting in obesity; or hypophagia (reduced food intake) with or without weight loss. Children also frequently experience aversion to specific textures of food. Disturbance of circadian sleep rhythm, resulting in abnormal sleep-wake cycles, is noted in one-third of children with ONH. This disturbance could result in behavioral problems and disruption of family life.

===Development===
More than 70% of children with ONH experience developmental delay, ranging from isolated focal defects to delay in all areas of development (global delay). Motor delay is most common (75%) and communication delay is least common (44%). Predictors of significantly delayed development include hypoplasia or agenesis of the corpus callosum and hypothyroidism. The absence of the septum pellucidum does not predict developmental delay. Delays may occur in unilateral (39%) as well as bilateral (78%) cases.

== Cause==

===Genetic risks===

Mutations of genes involved in transcription regulation, chromatin remodelling, α-dystroglycan glycosylation, cytoskeleton and scaffolding protein, RNA splicing, and the MAP kinase signalling pathway are currently known to cause ONH. Many transcription factors for eye development are also involved in the morphogenesis of forebrain, which may explain why ONH is commonly a part of a syndrome involving brain malformations.

ONH impacts all ethnic groups, although in the United States, occurrence is lower in persons of Asian descent. To date, there have been few reports of ONH occurrence in Asian countries, although it is uncertain why this is so.

===Gestational and exposure history===
Although many perinatal and prenatal risk factors for ONH have been suggested, the predominant, enduring, most frequent risk factors are young maternal age and primiparity (the affected child being the first child born to the mother). Increased frequency of delivery by caesarean section and fetal/neonatal complications, preterm labor, gestational vaginal bleeding, low maternal weight gain, and weight loss during pregnancy are also associated with ONH.

==Diagnosis==

ONH is diagnosed by ophthalmoscopic examination. Patients with ONH exhibit an optic nerve that appears smaller than normal and different in appearance from small optic nerves caused by other eye conditions such as optic (nerve) atrophy.

DM:DD ratio has proven to be a clinically useful measurement to help diagnose optic nerve hypoplasia. Where &quot;DM&quot; represents the distance from Disk to Macula, and &quot;DD&quot; represents Disc Diameter.

The mean disc diameter (DD) is (Vertical diameter of Disc+Horizontal diameter of Disc) divided by 2. The distance between the center of the disc and the macula is DM.

&quot;Interpretation:&quot; When the ratio of DM to DD is greater than 3, ONH is suspected, and when it is greater than 4, Optic Nerve Hypoplasia is definite.

==Treatment==
There is no cure for ONH; however, many therapeutic interventions exist for the care of its symptoms. These may include hormone therapy for hypopituitarism, occupational, physical, and/or speech therapy for other issues, and services of a teacher for students with blindness/visually impairment. Special attention should be paid to early development of oral motor skills and acclimation to textured foods for children with texture aversion, or who are otherwise resistant to eating.

Sleep dysfunction can be ameliorated using melatonin in the evening in order to adjust a child&#x27;s circadian clock.

Treatment for strabismus may include patching of the better eye, which may result in improved vision in the worse eye; however, this should be reserved for cases in which the potential for vision improvement in both eyes is felt to be good. Surgery to align the eyes can be performed once children with strabismus develop equal visual acuity in both eyes, most often after the age of three. Generally surgery results in improved appearance only and not in improved visual function.

==Prognosis==
The visual prognosis in optic nerve hypoplasia is quite variable. Occasionally, optic nerve hypoplasia may be compatible with near-normal vision; in other cases, one or both eyes may be functionally, or legally blind. Although most patients with only optic nerve involvement lead normally productive lives, those with accompanying endocrine dysfunction or other midline cerebral abnormalities are more at risk for on-going intellectual and other disabilities.

==Epidemiology==
Optic nerve hypoplasia (ONH) is a congenital condition in which the optic nerve is underdeveloped (small).
Many times, de Morsier’s Syndrome or septo-optic dysplasia (SOD) is associated with ONH, however, it is possible to have ONH without any additional issues like SOD. SOD is a condition that can involve multiple problems in the midline structures of the brain, stemming from miswiring of the brain and central nervous system. Besides having small optic nerves, persons with ONH can have agenesis of the corpus callosum, absence of the septum pellucidum, maldevelopment of the anterior and posterior pituitary gland, and anomalies of the hypothalamus. Because of this, all children with ONH are at risk for developmental delays and hormonal deficiencies, regardless of severity of ONH, or whether abnormalities are visible by MRI.

ONH is the single leading cause of permanent legal blindness in children in the western world. The incidence of ONH is increasing, although it is difficult to estimate the true prevalence. Between 1980 and 1999, the occurrences of ONH in Sweden increased four-fold to 7.2 per 100,000, while all other causes of childhood blindness had declined. In 1997, ONH overtook retinopathy of prematurity as the single leading cause of infant blindness in Sweden, with 6.3 in every 100,000 births diagnosed with ONH. The most recent prevalence report out of England in 2006 is 10.9 per 100,000.

<text>Morningside is a southside suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Morningside had a population of 11,755 people.

== Geography ==
It is located east of the CBD, and borders Cannon Hill, Norman Park, Seven Hills, Balmoral, and Hawthorne.

There are many older-style weatherboard and chamferboard homes in this area as well as modern units and townhouses.

== History ==
Morningside is said to be named after a local estate belonging to David Longlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;RE/MAX&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the estate itself likely referred either to the Scottish town, or to the estate&#x27;s location on the eastern side of Brisbane. It is also said to be named for the sight of the morning sun catching the banks of the river.

The area was first settled by Europeans in the early 1870s. The land at that time was used mainly for agriculture; in particular, dairy, sugarcane and tobacco production.

The old suburb of Colmslie was merged into Morningside. At the corner of Bennetts and Wynnum Roads is the historic Bulimba Cemetery (also known as the Balmoral Cemetery) dating from 1875. Morningside started off as a rural area with small dairy and tobacco farms before becoming a popular residential area in the post-war boom.

In December 1884, &quot;The Richmond Park Estate&quot; made up of 145 allotments, was advertised to be auctioned by Hooker, Son &amp; Elliott. A map advertising the auction shows an area bordering Main Cleveland Road, between what is now Wynnum Road and Richmond Road in Morningside. The Bulimba Divisional Board offices and grounds are clearly marked.

In March 1920, the area of land on the hill adjacent to Morningside Station, was offered for sale as the &quot;Morningside Estate&quot;, to be auctioned by A.M. Newman. A map of the estate shows the allotments offered for sale. Coronation Park estate Morningside was advertised for sale on 21 July 1923. The estate is centred on the Keralgerie Park in Morningside. Marooba Estate on the corner of Riding Road and Lawson Street was advertised for sale on 25 August 1928, 20 business and residential blocks were auctioned.

Morningside Infants Provisional School opened on 28 May 2023. In 1926, it ceased to be an Infant school and became Morningside State School.

A quarry was established post-World War I to obtain bluestone for roads in the growing suburbs. By 1940, the quarry had been filled in to provide a swimming pool for residents. In 1948, the Australian diving championships were held in the quarry swimming pool. After 2 drownings and the detection of typhoid in the water by 1952, the quarry was drained and filled to create Keralgerie Park. The quarry was at 181 Richmond Road ().

Until 13 April 1969, electric trams skirted the western edge of the suburb, operating along Wynnum Road and Riding Road.

The Cairncross Dockyard was constructed in Morningside between 1942 and 1944. The facility closed in 2014, and as of 2016 was to be redeveloped into a commercial and residential area. In 2022, there was an attempt to have the site listed on the Queensland Heritage Register. In June 2023, the Queensland Heritage Council declined to list the dockyard on the heritage register and the site was then offered for sale.

== Demographics ==
In the , Morningside had a population of 10,481 people.

In the , Morningside had a population of 11,755 people.

== Education ==
Morningside State School is a government primary (Prep–6) school for boys and girls at 67 Pashen Street (). In 2017, the school had an enrolment of 454 students with 37 teachers (29 full-time equivalent) and 26 non-teaching staff (15 full-time equivalent). It includes a special education program. The school has 26 classrooms, with a swimming pool, tennis court and a large oval.

In October 2018, a major fire broke out at Morningside State School which caused extensive damage to the school. The school re-opened one week later with the assistance and hard work of the entire school community.

There are no secondary schools in Morningside. The nearest secondary school is Balmoral State High School at 259 Thynne Road in neighbouring Balmoral.

== Amenities ==
There are two shopping centres in Morningside; Morningside Central, located on the corner of Junction Road and Wynnum Road, and Colmslie Plaza on the opposite side of Junction Road. The Colmslie Hotel is located next to Colmslie Plaza.

The Balmoral Cemetery is located at the corner of Wynnum and Bennetts Road, Morningside. Opened in 1875, this is no longer an active cemetery, but existing graves can be re-used for family members. It is also known as Bulimba Cemetery and Morningside Cemetery and was historically known as Kangaroo Point Cemetery.

== Heritage listings ==
Morningside has three heritage-listed sites:
* 82 Colmslie Road: former Commonwealth Acetate of Lime Factory
*67 Pashen Street: Morningside State School
* 105 Pashen Street: Balmoral Fire Station
* 580 Wynnum Road: Morningside Air Raid Shelter

== Transport ==
Morningside&#x27;s main road is Wynnum Road, and Morningside station connects the suburb to the Cleveland railway line.

== Notable residents ==
*Fazerdaze, aka Amelia Murray, a musician from the area who released her first studio album with &quot;Morningside&quot; as the title of the project
* Mal Michael, Australian rules footballer
* Michael and Brett Voss, two brothers who played for the Brisbane Lions and St Kilda Football Club respectively

<text>Újpalota is a panel housing estate in the 15th district of Budapest, Hungary. 

==History==

In 1969, a new panel housing estate was founded on the northeastern border of Budapest, in a wheat field and a former cemetery, near the Szilas-patak (Szilas Brook), commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Hungarian Soviet Republic (1919). It was named &quot;Újpalota&quot; (literally &quot;Newcastle&quot;) after the adjacent village of Palota (&quot;Castle&quot;), which initially became a suburb of the Hungarian capital, and later part of Greater Budapest.

104 panel buildings (5, 7, 11, 13 and 15-storey blocks) were planned for the area, containing 14,105 flats with an average floor space of (including one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom apartements). According to Tibor Tenke, the architect of the housing estate, the original plan was revised to increase the number of flats to 15,560. Construction was by the &quot;BHK III.&quot; (3rd Housing Factory of Budapest) using Soviet-Hungarian technology, and was completed in 1978.

==Demographics==

In the late 1970s, Újpalota had 60,000 inhabitants from all over the country, but mostly from the poor neighbourhoods of Budapest (Józsefváros, Kőbánya, Újpest, Kispest, Angyalföld), where the slum housing was demolished. Újpalota provided these poor families with a large improvement in living conditions, including district heating, piped hot water and flush toilets. According to a 1975 survey, 70% of householders were considered to be &quot;workers&quot;, and only 12% had passed the maturity exam (), a complex exam at the end of high school in Hungary). 21% of couples raised 1 child, 46% two children and 19% three children.

According to the 2011 census, Újpalota had 33,557 inhabitants, a significant decrease since the late 1970s.

<text>Rano Raraku is a volcanic crater formed of consolidated volcanic ash, or tuff, and located on the lower slopes of Terevaka in the Rapa Nui National Park on Easter Island in Chile. It was a quarry for about 500 years until the early eighteenth century, and supplied the stone from which about 95% of the island&#x27;s known monolithic sculptures (moai) were carved. Rano Raraku is a visual record of moai design vocabulary and technological innovation, where 887 moai remain. Rano Raraku is in the World Heritage Site of Rapa Nui National Park and gives its name to one of the seven sections of the park.

==Description==
The sides of Rano Raraku crater are high and steep except on the north and northwest, where they are much lower and gently sloping. The interior contains one of the island&#x27;s three freshwater crater lakes, which is bordered by nga&#x27;atu or totora reeds. These plants, once thought as evidence of contact with the South American mainland, are now known to have been growing on the island for at least 30,000 years and were used by the Rapa Nui for thatched shelter and swimming aids.

==Incomplete moai in the quarry==
The incomplete statues in the quarry are remarkable for their number, for the inaccessibility of some that were high on the outside crater wall and for the size of the largest; at 21.6 m (71 feet) in height, almost twice that of any moai ever completed and weighing an estimated 270 tonnes, many times the weight of any transported.

Some of the incomplete moai seem to have been abandoned after the carvers encountered inclusions of very hard rock in the material.

Others may be sculptures that were never intended to be separated from the rock in which they are carved.
==Standing moai at Ranu Raraku==
On the outside of the quarry are a number of moai, some of which are partially buried to their shoulders in the spoil from the quarry. They are distinctive in that their eyes were not hollowed out, they do not have pukao and they were not cast down in the island&#x27;s civil wars. For this last reason, they supplied some of the most famous images of the island.

===Tukuturi===

Tukuturi is an unusual moai. Its beard and kneeling posture distinguish it from standard moai.

The peculiar posture of this statue is well known on Easter Island and is called &quot;tuku turi&quot; or simply &quot;tuku.&quot; It was the posture used by the men and women who formed the chorus in the festivals called &quot;riu,&quot; where the posture was known as &quot;tuku riu&quot;. Typical also of the singers was the slightly backward inclination of the trunk, the raised head, and the goatee, all also seen in the statue.

Tukuturi is possibly related to the Tangata manu cult, in which case it would be one of the last moai ever made.

It seems likely that this statue represents a riu singer and was made after the production of classic statues had ceased.

<doc id="928828" wikidata="Q2702747" url="?curid=928828" title="Noriko Matsueda">
<text>is a Japanese former video game composer. She is best known for her work on the &quot;Front Mission&quot; series, &quot;The Bouncer&quot;, and &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;. Matsueda collaborated with fellow composer Takahito Eguchi on several games. Composing music at an early age, she began studying the piano and electronic organ when she was three years old. She graduated from the Tokyo Conservatoire Shobi, where she met Eguchi.

She joined Square (now Square Enix) in 1994, where she created music for nine games. Her last credited work was &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s piano arrangement album, &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection&quot; from 2004, after which she decided to leave the company alongside Eguchi. She composed mostly jazz music for the scores she worked on.

==Biography==
Born in Tochigi, Japan, Noriko Matsueda began creating music at an early age. She received a scholarship in music at the age of three and went on to study the piano and electronic organ. Matsueda took various composition and performance courses at the Tokyo Conservatoire Shobi, where she also met long-term collaborator Takahito Eguchi. She joined Square in 1994, where her first assignment was to score the 1995 title &quot;Front Mission&quot; alongside Yoko Shimomura. She subsequently contributed the track &quot;Boss Battle 1&quot; to &quot;Chrono Trigger&quot;, arranged by Nobuo Uematsu. Matsueda&#x27;s first solo work was &quot;Bahamut Lagoon&quot;, which also represented her first collaboration with Eguchi, who arranged and orchestrated &quot;Theme of Bahamut Lagoon ~ Opening&quot; for the bonus disc of its original soundtrack. In 1996, she created the composition &quot;Tower Block&quot; for the multi-composer game &quot;Tobal No. 1&quot;. The following year, she created the soundtrack to &quot;Front Mission 2&quot;.

In 1999, Matsueda and Eguchi made their first major collaboration by scoring the role-playing racing game &quot;Racing Lagoon&quot;, with synthesizer programmer Ryo Yamazaki providing three tracks. Matsueda was responsible for all the music except the battle, opening, and ending themes. They collaborated again on the soundtrack to the PlayStation 2 title &quot;The Bouncer&quot; in 2000, whereas the two took a more equal share of the music. A large amount of the compositions produced was not used in the game and there were also many post-production demands. Afterward, Matsueda created 25 pieces of background music for Square&#x27;s PlayOnline viewer used for &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot; and &quot;Tetra Master&quot;.

She reunited with Eguchi to create the soundtrack to &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot; in 2003, with Matsueda contributing most of the setting themes. Having replaced &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;″s regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu to create a work entirely different from the predecessor &quot;Final Fantasy X&quot;, their score received mixed reviews from critics and backlash from fans, but was commercially successful regardless. The following year, she worked on &quot;Final Fantasy X-2&quot;″s international version &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission&quot; and provided three arrangements to the &quot;Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection&quot; album, which were both better received by critics. The Piano Collections album was her last credited work, and she has since left Square Enix along with Eguchi.

==Musical style and influences==
Matsueda is noted for her jazzy style, which she often incorporated into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was responsible for most of the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate way to express herself.

She cites George Gershwin, Herbie Hancock, Chick Corea, Igor Stravinsky, and Gustav Mahler as musical influences. When composing music for games, Matsueda draws inspiration from all parts of the game, including the story, the world view, the personality of the characters, the graphics, and the tone of color. She has stated that she makes the music thinking about the goal of the sounds for the game and its total balance.

<doc id="928838" wikidata="Q82677" url="?curid=928838" title="Gal Fridman">
<text>Gal Fridman (or Friedman, ; born September 16, 1975) is an Israeli windsurfer and Israel&#x27;s first Olympic gold medalist. Fridman won a bronze medal in the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics, and a gold medal in the Athens 2004 Summer Olympics. He is the first of two Israelis athletes to win two Olympic Medals, and the first Olympic Gold medalist in Israeli history. His first name, Gal, means &quot;wave&quot; in Hebrew.

He was born in Karkur, Israel, and lives close to the water in Sdot Yam, a nearby kibbutz.

==Early life and career==
Fridman was born in Karkur, Israel, to an Ashkenazi Jewish family. The second of three children, Fridman was born to Dganit and Uri Fridman, and has an older sister, Maayan and a younger brother, Yuval. Growing up close to the Mediterranean Sea, Gal was introduced by his father to windsurfing. Fridman started sailing at age seven, and began racing when he was 11. He began competing internationally in youth categories while still in school. After his service in the Israel Defense Forces he began competing as an adult.

In 1995, he won the ASA Boardsailing Championship in Eilat, Israel. In 1999, he won the International ASA Windsurfing Championship in Eilat. In 2002, he won the Mistral World Championship held in Pattaya, Thailand, and was ranked No. 1 on the International Sailing Federation rankings in February 2003.

==1996 Summer Olympic Games, Atlanta==

At the 1996 Summer Olympics, Fridman won a bronze medal for Israel in the Olympic Sailing Windsurfing Event (Mistral Men&#x27;s Windsurfing category), and was named Israeli Sportsman of the Year.

==2000 Summer Olympics, Sydney, Australia==

Despite his form in the previous years, he failed to win the Israeli Olympic Trials and did not represent Israel in the Sydney 2000 Olympics. Amit Inbar represented Israel in the 2000 Olympics and finished 7th overall.

==2004 Summer Olympics, Athens, Greece==
Back on form leading up to the 2004 Olympics, Fridman was one of Israel&#x27;s Olympic Team favorites to win a Medal (along with judoka Ariel Ze&#x27;evi and athlete Aleksander Averbukh), and prepared intensively for the Olympic Games two years prior to the event. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Fridman again competed in the Olympic windsurfing discipline of sailing (Mistral Windsurfer Class), a discipline that included 11 races.

Fridman was coached by retired Olympic windsurfing silver (1992) and bronze medalist (1988) Michael Gebhardt from the U.S.

(&quot;Note&quot;: the worst race score is thrown out)

In the last race on August 25, 2004, Fridman finished a hard-fought 2nd, exploiting a tactical mistake made by Brazilian leader Ricardo Santos and beat Greek windsurfer Nikolaos Kaklamanakis to end the Olympic Regatta with the lowest score of 42 points, which secured his 2004 Olympic gold medal in windsurfing. Olympic sailing events scores are tabulated with the lowest score (best results combines) winning. Fridman won Israel&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal.

Fridman dedicated his medal to the memory of the 11 Israeli athletes murdered by terrorists during the 1972 Summer Olympics.

Final results

1st: Gal Fridman – Israel (Gold medal)

2nd: Nikolaos Kaklamanakis – Greece (Silver medal)

3rd: Nick Dempsey – Great Britain (Bronze medal)

4th: Ricardo Santos – Brazil

5th: Przemysław Miarczyński – Poland

==2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing, China==

Approaching the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Fridman found it hard to adjust to the new Olympic Windsurf board model, the RS:X Neil Pryde windsurfer. Also he had some crucial equipment failures at key Olympic trail regattas and failed to qualify for the 2008 Israeli Olympic Sailing Team. Shahar Tzuberi took his place and went on to win the 2008 Olympic bronze medal for Israel.

==Later years; cycling and coaching==
Fridman, an avid cyclist, won a gold medal in the Israeli cycling championship in 2005. In 2007, he won the Men&#x27;s Windsurfer New Year International Regatta in Limassol, Cyprus.

After 2008, Fridman retired from competition in windsurfing and focused on coaching up-and-coming Israeli windsurfers. He guided Nimrod Mashiah to the silver medal in the 2009 World Championship. 

He coaches Tom Reuveny, who became the Olympic champion winning the gold medal, at 24 years of age, representing Israel at the 2024 Paris Olympics in windsurfing in the Men&#x27;s iQFoil in Marseille, France.

Fridman is a Vegan.

==Hall of Fame==
In 2005, Fridman was named to the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

<text>David John Lee Maloney (14 December 1933 – 18 July 2006) was a British television director and producer, best known for his work on the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; and &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him on his death as &quot;one of that old school who could turn out 30-minute dramas in two days shooting time&quot;.

==Early life==

Maloney was born in Alvechurch, Worcestershire, educated at King Edward VI Five Ways and served in the Royal Air Force before becoming an actor in repertory theatre.

==Career==

Maloney joined the BBC as a television production assistant and trained to be a director at the corporation. His directing credits included the police series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, &quot;Softly, Softly: Taskforce&quot; and &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot;, and an adaptation of the Walter Scott novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1970).

He first worked on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as a production assistant to Christopher Barry on the serial &quot;The Rescue&quot; (1965). He directed eight &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials between 1968 and 1977. He became, along with Douglas Camfield, one of producer Philip Hinchcliffe&#x27;s two favourite directors. He then became the producer of the first three seasons of &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; (1978–80), which included directing three episodes himself. He left &quot;Blake&#x27;s 7&quot; to produce the last series of &quot;When the Boat Comes In&quot; (1981). He also produced the BBC&#x27;s adaptation of John Wyndham&#x27;s novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot; (1981).

==Later work==

After his work in television drama, Maloney moved to factual programme-making and travelled the world making various documentaries for the ITV contractor Central. Towards the end of his life, he appeared in a number of TV and DVD documentaries about his work on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He also provided DVD commentaries for three of the serials he directed, &quot;The Mind Robber&quot; (1968), &quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (1975) and &quot;The Talons of Weng-Chiang&quot; (1977).

==Death==

Maloney died on 18 July 2006.

<doc id="928855" wikidata="Q497805" url="?curid=928855" title="Shebeen">
<text>A shebeen (, &quot;home-made whiskey&quot;) was originally an illicit bar or club where accessible alcoholic beverages were sold without a license. The term has spread far from its origins in Ireland, to Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Zimbabwe, the English-speaking Caribbean, Namibia, Malawi, and South Africa. In modern South Africa, many shebeens are now fully legal.

==South Africa==

Originally shebeens were operated illegally by women who were called Shebeen Queens and were themselves a revival of the African tradition that assigned the role of women in brewing. The Shebeen Queens would sell homebrewed and home-distilled alcohol and provided patrons with a place to meet and discuss political and social issues. Often, patrons and owners were arrested by the police, though the shebeens were frequently reopened because of their importance in unifying the community and providing a safe place for discussion. During the apartheid era, shebeens became a crucial meeting place for activists, some attracting working-class activists and community members, while others attracted lawyers, doctors and musicians. One reason the government allowed the shebeens to remain open was because some of Shebeen Queens were informers for the police.

Shebeens also provided music and dancing, allowing patrons to express themselves culturally, which helped give rise and support the musical genre kwaito. Currently, shebeens are legal in South Africa and have become an integral part of South African urban culture, serving diverse commercial brands from beer, cider to whisky as well as umqombothi, a traditional African beer made from maize and sorghum. Shebeens still form an important part of today&#x27;s social scene. In contemporary South Africa, they serve a function similar to juke joints for African Americans in the rural Deep South of the USA. They represent a sense of community, identity, and belonging.

Today, most alcoholic beverages&#x27; target market is the affluent black African class (particularly male), whose persona is perceived to be educated, tied to the high end job market and a step up in the social ladder. As well as appealing to South Africa&#x27;s youth, most shebeens are owned by black men. Shebeens are bouncing back as South Africans try to aspire to better economic conditions in order to preserve some of their cultural and economic affairs.

==United States==
In the United States, the word &quot;shebeen&quot; saw general use by Irish immigrants who worked in the anthracite patches of Pennsylvania.

==Newfoundland==
Like many traditional Irish words, &quot;shebeen&quot; has persisted in Newfoundland. The &quot;Dictionary of Newfoundland English&quot; defines &quot;shebeen&quot;, also &#x27; and &#x27;, as an &quot;unlicensed place where illicit liquor is sold.&quot; In the 1880s, the proliferation of shebeens was a hot topic, pitting temperance advocates against those who considered the shebeens harmless fun.

On January 5, 1888, the &quot;Twillingate Sun&quot; reported: &quot;A policeman entered a shebeen and found a number of persons drinking. A panic ensued, and there was a general stampede. The transgressor of the law, on being brought before the magistrate, pleaded that he was merely entertaining a few friends. The Judge duly remarked he thought it a strange way to entertain friends, when the said friends tried to hide themselves and their drinking utensils away, on the approach of a constable.&quot;

In April 1898, the Chief Steward of the S.S. &quot;Bruce&quot; raged in response to a &quot;St. John&#x27;s Evening Telegram&quot; story querying whether his ship was &quot;a floating shebeen&quot;.

<doc id="928857" wikidata="Q3239411" url="?curid=928857" title="Notchback">
<text>A notchback is a car design with the rear section distinct from the passenger compartment and where the back of the passenger compartment is at an angle to the top of what is typically the rear baggage compartment. Notchback cars have &quot;a trunk whose lid forms a distinct deck.&quot; In profile view, the body has a step down from the roof with a downward inclined passenger compartment&#x27;s rear window to meet an almost horizontal trunk lid extending to the rear of the car.

The category may be characterized as having a three-box design where the trunk volume is less pronounced than the engine and passenger compartments.

Many models of sedans, coupés, or hatchbacks could be classified as notchbacks. However, the category has limited salience outside American car manufacturers, who distinguish the three-box models from other body styles in the same model range. For example, the Chevrolet Vega range included both a notchback coupe and a fastback coupe.

==North America==
One of the first cars marketed as a notchback is the 1938 Cadillac Sixty Special.

In a major design change among U.S. automakers for the 1952 model year, a notchback version of the Nash Ambassador was introduced. This was in contrast to the previous fastback aerodynamic body shape that made the 1949 through 1950 Nash Ambassadors the &quot;most streamlined form on the road.&quot; The new cars had a distinctive reverse slanting C-pillar and featured boxier styling that became a design trend.

In 1971, Chevrolet marketed the three-box sedan models of the Chevrolet Vega as a &quot;notchback&quot; to differentiate them from the fastback Vega models. For the 1973 model year, the car&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Vega Notchback&quot;.

== English-speaking countries ==
While many car models have notchback characteristics, the category is largely unused outside North America, with their body style being described using other terms. For example, a three-box sedan is more generally known as a &quot;saloon&quot; in British English. &quot;Notchback&quot; has appeared in a few British English publications; however, it is not a term that is used in common parlance in Britain.

<text>Guido Pieter Theodorus Josephus Gezelle (1 May 1830 – 27 November 1899) was an influential writer and poet and a Roman Catholic priest from Belgium. He is famous for the use of the West Flemish dialect, but he also wrote in other languages like Dutch, English, French, German, Latin and Greek.

== Life ==

Gezelle was born in Bruges in the province of West Flanders to Monica Devrieze and Pieter Jan Gezelle, a gardener. The house where he was born is now literary museum &quot;Gezellehuis&quot;.

Gezelle was ordained a priest in 1854, and worked as a teacher at the Minor Seminary, Roeselare. Interested in all things English and became the chaplain to the , where he died.

His works are often inspired by his mystic love towards God and Creation. Later, his poetry was associated with literary Impressionism, and he is considered a forerunner of that movement.

Gezelle was a proponent of developing the Flemish dialects independently from (now) mainstream Dutch, with its dominantly Hollandic character. The Dutch he used in his poems was heavily influenced by local West Flemish dialect. Gezelle also was a translator of poetry and prose, notably of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow&#x27;s &quot;Song of Hiawatha&quot;, published in 1886. Having read the original in Roeselare in 1856 the poem interested him for its portrayal of American Indians and their relation to Christian missionaries.

For his linguistic mastery, Gezelle is considered one of the most important poets of Dutch literature.

The Flemish writer Stijn Streuvels (Frank Lateur) was his nephew.

<text>Michael Mronz (born 1 March 1967) is a German sports and events manager.

==Early life and education==
Mronz was born in Cologne in 1967 and grew up in Cologne-Junkersdorf, the youngest son of gallerist Ute Mronz and architect Johannes Mronz. He was very interested in sport at an early age. His brother is former tennis professional Alexander Mronz. Mronz began to organise tennis tournaments while studying economics in Göttingen. He completed his degree in Economics at the University of Cologne in the winter of 1999 and obtained the qualification as a business graduate.

==Career==

In 1989, Mronz organised his first tennis tournament, the Pohland Cup in Cologne, then later the Cologne Open.

Michael Mronz e.K. was founded by Mronz in 1992 as MM Promotion Michael Mronz and was renamed Michael Mronz e.K. in November 2016. The focal point of the events that he organises are sports events such as marathons, equestrian, tennis, beach volleyball and hockey tournaments. Mronz advises companies, associations as well as individual people and clubs on issues concerning sports sponsoring and sports marketing. He is also responsible for the marketing of major TV events, the most well-known of which are Stefan Raab’s Wok World Championships, the Bundesvision Song Contest and the TV total Diving Competition.

Mronz (who himself does not ride) has been the General Manager of the Aachener Reitturnier GmbH (ART) since 1 October 1997, which is responsible for the marketing of the CHIO Aachen, the largest equestrian event in the world. Based on the competences he acquired in this position, Mronz was also appointed Head of the Organising Committee of the World Equestrian Games in 2006, the second largest sporting event in Germany after the Football World Cup that was staged in the same year. For the first time since the Equestrian and Driving World Championships were founded in 1990, this event succeeded in closing on a positive net result. After the great success of the FEI World Equestrian Games, the trade magazine &quot;Horizont&quot; elected Michael Mronz as &quot;Sports Manager of the Year&quot;.

In his capacity as Marketing Director, Mronz was responsible for the marketing and ticketing of the World Athletics Championships in 2009 in Berlin.

In 2002, Mronz became a member of the board of the Hanne-Nüsslein Foundation of the KTHC Red-White stadium. The foundation has set itself the aim of promoting young tennis talents. Up until December 2003, he was shareholder and Managing Director of the American Sports GmbH, under the umbrella of which the first ladies’ and the first men’s team of the German basketball league club, RheinEnergie Cologne, fall. He stepped down due to differences of opinion concerning the future alignment of the organisation’s structure. Since January 2007, Michael Mronz has been a member of the board of the German America&#x27;s Cup team, United Internet Team Germany, where he is responsible for the press activities.

Since 2013, he has been the organiser of the famous ATP tournament, BMW Open by FWU AG, in Munich. He advises the organisers of the German racing series DTM and of the 2018 European Athletics Championships in Berlin.

Mronz is the initiator and organiser of the &quot;Rhine-Ruhr Olympic City 2028&quot; initiative that is backed by the private sector. This idea of the Rhine-Ruhr region putting in a bid to stage the 2028 Summer Olympics is being met with great enthusiasm from economic and political circles. Mronz has developed a concept that relies upon sustainability and the usage of existing sports and event facilities.

Mronz took over the Chair of the Westerwelle Foundation in 2016, which asserts itself on an international basis for democracy, the rule of law, the social market economy, and political and economic participation.

He became an IOC member in 2023.

==Other activities==
* 1. FC Köln, Member of the Advisory Board (since 2020)
* &quot;A heart for children&quot;, Chairman

==Personal life==
Mronz was the partner of German FDP politician Guido Westerwelle from 2003 to 2016, when Westerwelle died of leukaemia. Mronz and Westerwelle entered into a registered civil partnership in Bonn on 17 September 2010, at a time when Westerwelle was serving as Germany&#x27;s Foreign Minister under Chancellor Angela Merkel.

<text>The Sunday Independent is an Irish Sunday newspaper broadsheet published by Independent News &amp; Media plc, a subsidiary of Mediahuis.

It is the Sunday edition of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, and maintains an editorial position midway between magazine and tabloid.

==History==
The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; was first published in 1905 as the Sunday edition of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;. Following the creation of the Irish Free State, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; followed its daily counterpart&#x27;s political line by supporting Cumann na nGaedheal and its successor Fine Gael.

From the 1940s until 1970, the paper was run by Hector Legge (1901–1994). Legge&#x27;s time at the paper was notable for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; in 1948 leaking the news that the Irish government were going to leave the British Commonwealth by repealing the External Relations Act. Legge also published a series of articles by the writer Frank O&#x27;Connor (under the pseudonym &quot;Ben Mayo&quot;) in the paper.

In the 1970s, under the editorship of Conor O&#x27;Brien, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; became known for a series of investigations by journalist Joe MacAnthony into the activities of the Irish Sweepstakes.

O&#x27;Brien was succeeded as editor in 1976 by Michael Hand. Aengus Fanning became editor following Hand&#x27;s departure in 1984.

In 1984 the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; logo changed from black to purple in colour.

Anne Harris succeeded her husband Aengus Fanning after his death in January 2012.

On 20 December 2014, Harris ended her tenure as the &quot;Sunday Independent&#x27;s&quot; editor; at her going-away party, the marketing department of Independent News and Media gave her a painting of the number &quot;30%&quot; to commemorate the fact Harris had raised the newspaper&#x27;s circulation to 30% of the Irish market.

Cormac Bourke, the former executive editor of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, became the new editor of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; in January 2015.

Alan English, who was previously the Editor of the &quot;Limerick Leader&quot;, was appointed as editor of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; in January 2020.

On 17 October 2021, the paper launched a Northern Ireland edition with some localised content.

===Digital archives===
The Sunday Independent is available on the Irish Newspaper Archives and from 1959 to October 2006 at the British Newspaper Archive.

==Content==
The newspaper is a general Sunday newspaper, covering news and politics. It is published in five sections: News, Sport, Business, Property, and Living, as well as a magazine section. In terms of news, while the newspaper maintains a broadsheet outlook, it has come in for much criticism lately due to its increasing emphasis on lifestyle features in the main section. It has also been criticised for regularly tending towards sensationalism, and for the often opinion-focused, rather than news-focused nature of its articles. It is probably better described as a &quot;middle-of-the-road&quot; newspaper, rather than a newspaper of record. In the 1980s and 1990s, the deputy editor was Anne Harris.

A 1997 article in &quot;Magill&quot; magazine about the newspaper stated, &quot;Its critics have characterised it as nasty and narcissistic, its supporters as lively and libidinous, a tornado of fresh air in a stale and shrinking industry&quot;.

It often supported Fianna Fáil, particularly Bertie Ahern and then Brian Lenihan, with articles focused on that party and its policies. That Government&#x27;s former Minister for Defence, Willie O&#x27;Dea has written columns for the newspaper. Other politicians to have written columns for the newspaper include Fine Gael&#x27;s former Minister for Justice Alan Shatter and former Labour Party TD Michael McNamara.

Articles on transgender topics feature, often written by Eilis O&#x27;Hanlon, Mark Tighe, and Tommy Conlon. On 27 August 2022, a protest outside the newspaper&#x27;s office taking issue with the Sunday Independent&#x27;s coverage of transgender issues was organised by Trans and Intersex Pride Dublin.

Popularly nicknamed &quot;The Sindo&quot;, the paper has been a zealous critic of the Provisional IRA and Sinn Féin for many years. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; was reproachful toward SDLP politician John Hume, whom the newspaper accused of being insufficiently attentive to the needs of the Ulster Unionists. Many of the &quot;Sunday Independent&#x27;s&quot; columnists also criticised Hume for negotiating with Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams, accusing Hume of being naive about Adams.

==Editorial policy==
The editorial policy of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; can be described as support for laissez-faire policies in economics and strong opposition to armed republicanism; some have described the newspaper&#x27;s policies as those of the New Right. It was strongly supportive of the Progressive Democrats and in favour of income tax reduction and the rolling back of the state. Issues of interest have included big government, the size of the public sector, terrorism, and the Republic&#x27;s regime of stamp duty on newly acquired property. Brendan O&#x27;Connor contributes a weekly write-up for the newspaper&#x27;s front page. Prior to his death, former editor Aengus Fanning also contributed editorial material. When he was deputy editor Willie Kealy did. Anne Harris did. Jody Corcoran did.

The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; has, historically, been quite hostile to the Irish Labour Party and social democratic policies; in the early 1990s, the paper singled out Labour politicians Mary Robinson (then serving as President of Ireland), Dick Spring and Michael D. Higgins for intense criticism. The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; also took a negative tone towards rival media outlets RTÉ and &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, objecting to perceived left-wing and pro-nationalist bias in these organisations.

The &quot;Sunday Independent&#x27;s&quot; editorials came out strongly against Martin McGuinness&#x27;s campaign to become President of Ireland in 2011, claiming McGuiness&#x27;s IRA past made him unsuitable for the role: &quot;Those who contemplate voting for ... McGuinness should ask if, within the context of the murders committed by the IRA on our security forces, they are prepared to force our soldiers and gardai to salute President McGuinness with equally heavy hearts.&quot;.

==Print circulation==
In 2019, Independent News &amp; Media exited the ABC auditing process.

==Controversies==
The newspaper has been the source of many controversies over the years:

===Bishop Casey controversy===
In 1993, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; advertised what was claimed as a &quot;world exclusive&quot; interview with Bishop Eamon Casey after he had fled Ireland following the revelation of his affair with Annie Murphy. However it was later revealed that Casey had refused to speak to the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; and the &quot;interview&quot; was in fact a telephone recording of Casey speaking to a friend. The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; later apologised for this incident, stating &quot;We are not satisfied the bishop was interviewed in any normal sense of the word&quot;.

===The Keane Edge===
The Keane Edge was a gossip column written by Terry Keane, a fashion journalist and estranged wife of former Chief Justice of Ireland, Ronan Keane. It was frequently the subject of successful libel actions by persons angered by accusations therein. In it there were often hints of a relationship with a prominent political figure, named in the column as &quot;Sweetie&quot;. In 1999, it was revealed by Keane on the RTÉ One programme, &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;, that the figure had been the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey. Keane gave the story as an exclusive to rival newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, while still employed by Independent News and Media. She abruptly left the newspaper (amid much recriminations) and her column continued as &quot;Not The Keane Edge&quot;, soon renamed &quot;The Double Edge&quot;.

===Mary Ellen Synon controversy===
Mary Ellen Synon, a columnist with the newspaper, caused much controversy when she attacked the Paralympic Games as being &quot;perverse&quot;, in an article of 22 October 2000. This became the subject of much public debate and lead to the columnist being criticised in the Oireachtas (Irish Parliament). Initially, the editor, Aengus Fanning, defended the columnist, however he eventually issued an apology, after the then health boards threatened to withdraw advertising from the newspaper. Synon has not written for the newspaper since, although it was denied that she had been dismissed from the newspaper.

===The 03 team===
The 03 (later 04) team were a group of young female journalists who appeared in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; during 2003 and early 2004. The articles, originally appearing in the &quot;Living&quot; supplement but soon promoted to the main section, comprised the various members of the team writing usually very poor quality short articles on a common subject. However, they were usually accompanied by a large colour group photo of the team posing scantily clad and very occasionally topless. Eventually the feature was dropped, but not before the team had made a television appearance on the RTÉ One show &quot;Open House&quot;. They occasionally featured as a fantasy figure for fictional &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot; character Ross O&#x27;Carroll-Kelly.

===Death of Liam Lawlor===
On 22 October 2005, the controversial Irish politician Liam Lawlor was killed in a road traffic accident in the Khimki district of Moscow during the early hours of Saturday morning. His driver was also killed in the accident, and a female passenger in the back seat of the car was slightly injured. The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; edition of 23 October published a story on its front page, written by Ciarán Byrne, Jody Corcoran and Nick Paton Walsh, claiming that Lawlor&#x27;s car had been travelling &quot;from a red-light district&quot; of Moscow and that police had claimed that the female passenger was a teenage girl who police claimed was &quot;likely to be a prostitute&quot;. Reports later during Sunday revealed that the female passenger was actually a 32-year-old Ukrainian national who worked in Prague as a legal secretary and interpreter and who had worked in that role for Lawlor before during previous business trips to Russia. As the furore over the accuracy of the article continued on the Sunday, the article disappeared from the front page of the newspaper&#x27;s website (although it could still be accessed by specifying its URL), and the PDF copy of the front page of the newspaper (usually available on the website) was also taken down.

On Monday 24 October, the managing director of Independent Newspapers, Michael Denieffe, admitted in an interview on RTÉ Radio 1&#x27;s lunchtime news programme, &quot;News at One&quot;, that the report had been &quot;inaccurate&quot; and apologised to the Lawlor family for the distress caused. The original article had by this point disappeared from the website entirely, and the PDF copy of the front page had reappeared on the website with the offending article blanked out. Later that afternoon, the editor of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, Aengus Fanning, also apologised to the Lawlor family and said that he &quot;took full responsibility&quot; for the inaccurate report. There had been considerable outrage about the report during the day, with calls being made on phone-in radio programmes for a boycott of the newspaper unless the editor and others responsible for the report resigned or were sacked.

On Tuesday 25 October, &quot;The Observer&quot;, whose Moscow correspondent Nick Paton Walsh had been one of those by-lined in the original story, issued a statement acknowledging that there had been &quot;serious discrepancies&quot; in the article it had published (also claiming that the woman concerned was a prostitute), apologised for the distress caused, and removed the article from its website. In addition, Paton Walsh stated that he had had &quot;no hand&quot; in the drafting of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; article. Paton Walsh said that &quot;an editor&quot; in the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; had contacted him on the Saturday seeking help to confirm reports that Mr Lawlor had died. Paton Walsh said that he had spoken with an official police spokesperson and relayed only the contents of three conversations with this same person to their news desk, saying that he had stressed that it was &quot;only a possibility the girl was a prostitute&quot;.

It was reported on Wednesday 26 October that the interpreter, Julia Kushnir, was seeking apologies from those newspapers who had published erroneous reports that she was a prostitute, and that she was likely to sue for damages if the newspapers did not comply.

The controversy sparked a debate over press standards in Ireland, with the Labour Party Senator Kathleen O&#x27;Meara calling for the establishment of a Press Council to monitor standards in the print media. The then Minister for Justice, Michael McDowell, stated that the print media coverage of Mr Lawlor&#x27;s death was &quot;grossly offensive, cruel and lacking in foundation and fact&quot;, and that defamation was not enough to deal with this kind of posthumous coverage. He said that legislation was being drafted to establish an appropriate press complaints council.

On 10 June 2006, the &quot;Irish Times&quot; reported that Kushnir was to sue &quot;The Observer&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Sunday World&quot;, the &quot;Irish Sunday Mirror&quot;, and the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; over the erroneous claim that she was a prostitute. On 6 November 2007, the four Irish newspapers agreed to pay Kushnir libel damages totalling €500,000 before libel proceedings began in the Irish High Court and lawyers for the four newspapers apologised in court for the offence caused. &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper had earlier settled its libel action for approximately €100,000.

===Death of Sgt. Tania Corcoran===
The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; sparked another furore in March 2007 when the newspaper featured a front-page report of the death in childbirth of Garda Sergeant Tania Corcoran. A headline noted that Sgt Corcoran was the wife of the ERU Garda who had fired a fatal shot in the Abbeylara siege, incensing friends and relatives of the couple.

===Pat Finucane controversy===
The newspaper was sued by relatives of the murdered solicitor Pat Finucane over allegations that Finucane was a member of the Provisional IRA. Finucane was a solicitor who came to prominence due to successfully challenging the British Government over several important human rights cases in the 1980s. He was shot fourteen times as he sat eating a meal at his Belfast home with his three children and wife, who was wounded in the attack. His killer was a member of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and an informer called Ken Barrett. The Stevens Report found that Pat Finucane was never a member of the Provisional IRA and that his death was the result of collusion between the UDA and members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The paper was sued by relatives of Finucane over comments made by their security correspondent Jim Cusack, and over an opinion piece written by the Unionist writer, Ruth Dudley Edwards who claimed that various &quot;relatives, friends, associates and clients&quot; of the Finucane had killed people. The paper was forced print an apology to the family of Finucane. The political magazine, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, estimated that the libel action cost the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; €500,000 in damages and legal costs

===Supporting Bertie Ahern===
The newspaper strongly supported Bertie Ahern during the 2007 Irish general election and continued to support him during his appearances before the Mahon Tribunal. Columnists Eoghan Harris and Brendan O&#x27;Connor have been particularly strong in supporting Ahern. In August 2007 Harris was appointed to Seanad Éireann by Ahern. At the same time as supporting Ahern, the newspaper has been strongly critical of Taoiseach, Brian Cowen. Several front-page articles, written by Jody Corcoran and Daniel McConnell, have accused him of mishandling the economy since the May 2007 election. According to McConnell&#x27;s recent articles, Cowen has refused repeatedly to deal with &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; information requests.

=== Familial ties ===
The &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; is noteworthy for the numerous familial ties within the publication.

Anne Harris, is now editor of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, her daughter Constance Harris writes for the newspaper as a fashion writer. Anne Harris is the former wife of Eoghan Harris who is an opinion columnist for the newspaper and she was the partner of the previous &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; editor, the late Aengus Fanning whose son Dion Fanning also writes for the newspaper as a sports writer covering soccer. Another of Fanning&#x27;s sons, Evan also writes for the newspaper while his nephew, Brendan Fanning is rugby correspondent.

Sarah Caden and Brendan O&#x27;Connor, a married couple, are both columnists; however, they met while both were working for the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;.

Shane Ross is a former Business Editor of the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, he was succeeded by his son-in-law Nick Webb. Ironically, Ross was a frequent critic of nepotism, cronyism and under-performance in Irish companies, particularly the Smurfit family&#x27;s influence within the Smurfit Group despite the family status as minority shareholders.

Despite being a publicly listed company, the parent company Independent News and Media employed as its CEO Gavin O&#x27;Reilly whose father was the largest shareholder and Chairman Tony O&#x27;Reilly. Gavin O&#x27;Reilly was ousted as CEO after INM&#x27;s share price collapsed and Denis O&#x27;Brien became the largest shareholder.

=== INM plc support and Denis O&#x27;Brien ===

The Independent group has often been accused of supporting the business interests of the O&#x27;Reilly family and in particular the parent group INM plc. Shane Ross, business editor and columnist, in particular has repeatedly praised the performance of Independent News and Media and its largest shareholder Tony O&#x27;Reilly and refrained from commenting on the subsequent collapse in the INM share-price and debt restructuring. Denis O&#x27;Brien in contrast has been the frequent subject of critical comment, in particular when his business activities conflicted with the O&#x27;Reilly family.

In the 2001 battle for control of Eircom with then-largest shareholder Tony O&#x27;Reilly, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; wrote of the inevitability of the sale to O&#x27;Brien, writing &quot;The Employee Share Option Trust (ESOT) has made its position clear: better dead than Denis. If they stick to this line it will be almost impossible for him to secure the votes needed to capture Eircom. Deadlock looms. And what happens if Valentia then walks away, leaving Denis as the highest bidder? Not yet likely, but possible. Sir Anthony is not going to pay a silly price for Eircom.&quot;

In a 2002 article headlined as &quot;tough questions for the INM board&quot;, Tony O&#x27;Reilly was referred to as the &quot;noble Knight&quot; by Shane Ross, who reminded shareholders of historic share-price performance and &quot;good dividend&quot; while referring to the &quot;well-publicised woes of the Irish Times&quot; and refraining from comment on the €400 million spent on &quot;The Belfast Telegraph&quot;. In 2006 he wrote glowingly of &quot;success fuelled by global strategy&quot; and referred reverentially to O&#x27;Reilly &quot;global nature of INM&#x27;s earnings is surely its strength? Tony O&#x27;Reilly has exploited an enviable knack of targeting the right geographical zones with an uncanny anticipation of future trends.&quot;

While Denis O&#x27;Brien is often newsworthy, the &quot;Sunday Independent&quot; has paid particular attention to him when his business activities conflicted with Independent News Media. Denis O&#x27;Brien has perceived bias in the Independent Group&#x27;s coverage and in a 2003 letter to Gavin O&#x27;Reilly wrote &quot;As far as I am concerned, Independent News and Media have spent the last seven years trying to destroy my reputation. Some of the coverage of my affairs, both business and personal, in the &quot;Sunday Tribune&quot;, &quot;Sunday Independent&quot;, &quot;Irish Independent&quot; and &quot;Evening Herald&quot; have caused hurt and enormous damage to my reputation, not to mention the emotional distress suffered by my wife, Catherine and my family. I very much doubt whether you or your family could have survived a similar onslaught.&quot;

After this O&#x27;Brien began to build a personal stake in INM plc at huge cost and in 2007 as O&#x27;Brien stepped up his criticism of the O&#x27;Reilly management Shane Ross labeled Denis O&#x27;Brien as a dissident shareholder and accused him of launching &quot;a destabilisation strategy&quot; due to the critical report into INM&#x27;s corporate governance. Ross also described the critics as &quot;human stooges&quot; and lauded the share price under O&#x27;Reilly, and looked forward to a &quot;bright future&quot; &quot;Shareholders in Independent Newspapers have never been better off. On Wednesday its stock stood at €3.66, close to its high. In the last year it has outperformed the Irish index. A record dividend is due to drop into shareholders&#x27; letterboxes . The stock yields 3.5 per cent. While the future looks bright, the past is dazzling. Any shareholder who invested €1,000 in the Indo&#x27;s shares in 1973, when O&#x27;Reilly took over, will now have €580,000&quot;

In a 2008 commentary on the INM plc AGM Shane Ross referred to O&#x27;Brien as &quot;an ordinary, likeable bloke ... from a solid middle-class background&quot; but a &quot;little businessman&quot; and &quot;no star&quot;, and mocked his Malta residency, although not only was Chairman Tony O&#x27;Reilly a resident in an offshore tax haven (Bahamas) but 70% of CEO Gavin O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s remuneration was paid into an-off shore Jersey entity. &quot;Whatever the source of the obvious personal resentment which the man from Malta feels for Sir Anthony O&#x27;Reilly, this weekend let us show him some gratitude. He gave us shareholders a clear choice. In return we gave him an unambiguous verdict. Vacate the pitch.&quot; After Ross wrote the article the share price collapsed and the company was restructured, without attracting additional comment from Ross&#x27;s column.

In 2009 in a phone call to Gavin O&#x27;Reilly, O&#x27;Brien, by then a 26% shareholder in INM, criticized O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s stewardship of the company and issued a series of ultimatums and threatened to call an extraordinary general meeting if not implemented. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s criticisms intensified, culminating with Mr O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s threat to Mr O&#x27;Reilly: &quot;I will destroy you and your father and I will go after everything.&quot;

<text>The Shire is a British breed of draught horse. It is usually black, bay, or grey. It is a tall breed, and Shires have at various times held world records both for the largest horse and for the tallest horse. The Shire has a great capacity for weight-pulling; it was used for farm work, to tow barges at a time when the canal system was the principal means of goods transport, and as a cart-horse for road transport. One traditional use was for pulling brewer&#x27;s drays for delivery of beer, and some are still used in this way; others are used for forestry, for riding and for commercial promotion.

The Shire breed was established in the mid-eighteenth century, although its origins are much older. A breed society was formed in 1876, and in 1878 the first stud-book was published. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there were large numbers of Shires, and many were exported to the United States. With the progressive mechanisation of agriculture and of transport, the need for draught horses decreased rapidly and by the 1960s numbers had fallen from a million or more to a few thousand. Numbers began to increase again from the 1970s, but the breed is still considered &quot;at risk&quot; by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust.

Outside the United Kingdom, there are stud-books and breed associations in Australia, the United States, and Canada.

== History ==

Though oxen were used for most farm work into the eighteenth century, horses &quot;fit for the dray, the plough, or the chariot&quot; were on sale at Smithfield Market in London as early as 1145.

The English Great Horse was valued during the reign of Henry VIII, when stallions measuring less than &quot;fifteen handfuls&quot; were not allowed, but the increasing role of gunpowder brought an end to the use of heavy horses in battle. Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s cavalry favoured lighter, faster mounts and the big horses began to be used for draught work instead. During the sixteenth century, Dutch engineers brought Friesian horses with them when they came to England to drain the fens, and these horses may have had an influence on what became the Shire breed.

From this medieval horse came an animal called the Old English Black Horse in the seventeenth century. The horse was improved by Robert Bakewell of Leicestershire, resulting in a horse sometimes known as the &quot;Bakewell Black&quot;. Bakewell imported six Dutch or Flanders mares, notable since breeders tended to concentrate on improving the male line. Two different types of horses developed: the Lincolnshire fens type and the Leicester or Midlands type. The Fen type tended to be larger, with more bone and hair, while the Midlands type tended to have more endurance while being of a finer appearance.

The term &quot;Shire horse&quot; was first used in the mid-seventeenth century, and incomplete records begin to appear near the end of the eighteenth century. The &quot;Packington Blind Horse&quot;, from Leicestershire, is one of the best-known horses of the era, with direct descendants being recorded from 1770 to 1832. This horse is usually recognised as the foundation stallion for the Shire breed, and he stood at stud from 1755 to 1770. During the nineteenth century, Shires were used extensively as cart horses to move goods from the docks through the cities and countryside. The rough roads created a need for massive horses with great strength. 
In 1878, the English Cart Horse Society was formed, and in 1884 changed its name to the Shire Horse Society. The Society published a stud book, with the first edition in 1878 containing 2,381 stallions and records dating back to 1770. Between 1901 and 1914, 5,000 Shires were registered each year with the society.

The first Shires were imported to the United States in 1853, with large numbers of horses being imported in the 1880s. The American Shire Horse Association was established in 1885 to register and promote the breed. The Shire soon became popular in the United States, and almost 4,000 Shires were imported between 1900 and 1918. Approximately 6,700 Shires were registered with the US association between 1909 and 1911.

Around the time of the Second World War, increasing mechanisation and strict regulations on the purchase of livestock feed reduced the need for and ability to keep draught horses. Thousands of Shires were slaughtered and several large breeding studs closed. The breed fell to its lowest point in the 1950s and 1960s, and in 1955 fewer than 100 horses were shown at the annual British Spring Show.

In the 1970s, the breed began to be revived through increased public interest. Breed societies have been established in the United States, Canada, the Netherlands, France, and Germany, and in 1996 the first World Shire Horse Congress was held in Peterborough. The first use within the breed of artificial insemination through frozen semen was with several Australian mares in 1997.

Between the 1920s and 1930s and today, the Shire has changed in conformation. The Clydesdale was used for cross-breeding in the 1950s and 1960s, which changed the conformation of the Shire and most notably changed the feathering on the lower legs from a mass of coarse hair into the silky feathering associated with modern Shires.

At the peak of their population, Shires numbered over a million. In the 1950s and 1960s, this number declined to a few thousand. In the United States, the Shire population dropped significantly in the early part of the twentieth century, and continued to decline in the 1940s and 1950s. Between 1950 and 1959, only 25 horses were registered in the United States. However, numbers began to increase, and 121 horses were registered in the US by 1985.

The National Shire Horse Spring Show is held annually and is the largest Shire show in Great Britain.

The conservation status of the Shire is listed by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust as &quot;at risk&quot;, meaning that population numbers are estimated to be under 1500 head. In the United States, the Livestock Conservancy lists it as &quot;critical&quot;, while the Equus Survival Trust calls it &quot;vulnerable&quot;.

== Characteristics ==

Shire stallions may be black, bay, brown or grey. They may not be roan or have large amounts of white markings. Mares and geldings may be black, bay, brown, grey or roan. In the UK stallions may not be chestnut, but the colour is allowed by the US association.

The average height at the withers of grown stallions is about , with a minimum of ; geldings should stand at least , and mares no less than . Weight ranges from for geldings and stallions, with no set standard for mares.

The head of a Shire is long and lean, with large eyes, set on a neck that is slightly arched and long in proportion to the body. The shoulder is deep and wide, the chest wide, the back muscular and short and the hindquarters long and wide. Not too much feathering is to occur on the legs, and the hair is fine, straight, and silky.

The Shire is known for its easy-going temperament. Shires have been identified to be at risk for chronic progressive lymphedema, a chronic progressive disease that includes symptoms of progressive swelling, hyperkeratosis, and fibrosis of distal limbs. The disease is similar to chronic lymphedema in humans.

The Shire has an enormous capacity for pulling weight. In 1924, at a British exhibition, a pair of horses was estimated to have pulled a starting load equal to 50 tonnes, although an exact number could not be determined as their pull exceeded the maximum reading on the dynamometer. Working in slippery footing, the same pair of horses pulled 18.5 tonnes at a later exhibition.

The tallest and heaviest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire gelding named Sampson (also known as Mammoth), foaled in Bedfordshire in 1846. He stood over , and weighed an estimated .

==Uses==

The Shire horse was originally the staple breed used to draw brewer&#x27;s drays. A few breweries still maintain this tradition in the UK, among them the Wadworth Brewery in Devizes, Wiltshire, the Hook Norton Brewery, the Samuel Smith Old Brewery in Tadcaster, Robinsons Brewery and Thwaites Brewery, which made Shire-drawn deliveries from the early 1800s to the 1920s, then resumed service in 1960. Several breweries have withdrawn their Shire horse teams, including the Tetley brewery in Leeds.

The horses are also used for forestry work and leisure riding.

<text>Park Kwang-su (born January 22, 1955) is a South Korean filmmaker. He was born in Sokcho, Gangwon Province and grew up in Busan. Park joined the Yallasung Film Group as a student of Fine Arts at Seoul National University. Upon graduation, he founded and led the Seoul Film Group which was dedicated to renewing Korean film culture and closely tied to the student protest movement. The Seoul Film Group was a significant part of the independent film movement and a strong voice speaking out against the military dictatorship. Park studied film at the ESEC film school in Paris, then returned to Korea to work as an assistant director to Lee Chang-Ho. He made his own first feature in 1988, and in 1993 became the first Korean filmmaker to found his own production company.

Park is considered the leader of the &quot;New Korean Cinema&quot; movement and one of Korea&#x27;s most distinguished filmmakers. His films have garnered critical acclaim and he has received numerous domestic and international awards for his films.

==Influence: the emergence of the New Korean Wave==
With the formation of new French and German cultural centers in Seoul, screenings of foreign art films were held, which eventually led to the creation of cinema clubs in which film was discussed and studied. Names such as Park Kwang-su, Chung Ji-young, Kim Hong-joon, and a number of other directors, producers and film critics were exposed to a world of international cinema and eventually branched off in order to create films and documentaries that showed Korean culture and history through the viewpoint of the people, predominantly the working class. Some of these short films and documentaries were produced by the Seoul Film Collective which was launched in 1982 and made up of Seoul National University graduates including Park Kwang-su, Jang Sun-woo and other directors. &quot;That Summer&quot; (1984), which focused on labourers from rural areas working in Seoul, and &quot;Suri-se&quot; (1984), which touched upon agricultural issues in southwestern Korea, are just two of the works that the Seoul Film Collective produced.

The New Korean Wave was made possible by two developments: a partial relaxation of censorship and the second change in film policy. Due to the relaxation of censorship, filmmakers such as Park Kwang-Su had more freedom to produce films that were originally prohibited by the government during the early censorship periods. The second film policy made it easier for independent producers like Park to enter the Korean film industry. Rather than trying to fill the “quotas” to produce mediocre Korean films, Park and other independent film producers were able to collaborate on quality films that pushed for social change. Without these policy changes, Park Kwang-Su would not have been able to make such films such as Chilsu and Mansu, which was a catalyst to the wave of New Korean Cinema. “While all of Park&#x27;s movies are firmly rooted in the political history of his country, he belongs to a group of international filmmakers whose work transcends their specific political situations to address, with great artistry, more universal issues of human freedom.”

<doc id="928887" wikidata="Q2292505" url="?curid=928887" title="Action Man">
<text>Action Man is an action figure launched in Britain in 1966 by Palitoy as a licensed copy of Hasbro&#x27;s American &quot;movable fighting man&quot;, G.I. Joe.

Action Man was originally produced and sold in the United Kingdom and Australia by Palitoy Ltd of Coalville, Leicestershire from 1966 until 1984. Palitoy offered sub-licences to toy manufacturers in other markets.

The figure and accessories were originally based on the Hasbro (US) 1964 G.I. Joe figure, for 1966–1969 production. Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe figure was patented in 1966. Even the specific method of attaching the appendages was patented as a &quot;Connection for Use in Toy Figures&quot;. The first Action Man figures were &quot;Action Soldier&quot;, &quot;Action Sailor&quot; and &quot;Action Pilot&quot;. All were available in the four original hair colours: Blonde, Auburn, Brown and Black. They were accompanied by outfits depicting the United States Armed Forces of World War II and the Korean War. From 1970 to 1984, the basic boxed figures and accompanying uniforms and accessories reflected the forces of the United Kingdom rather than the United States. Action Man was reintroduced in 1993, based on the G.I. Joe Hall of Fame figure of that time.

==History==
===Beginnings and success===
From 1964, Palitoy, a British subsidiary of General Mills, was the UK licensee for Hasbro Industries. Palitoy developed from a plastics firm, established by Alfred Edward Pallett in 1909 and became one of Britain&#x27;s leading toy manufacturers, until its closure in 1984.

In 1964, Sales Director Hal Belton returned from the United States with a new toy called G.I. Joe as a present for his grandson. When he realised that it was well received by his grandson he &quot;borrowed&quot; the toy and presented it to the General Manager Miles Fletcher. Miles and his Production Director Brian Wybrow made contact with Hasbro at the New York toy fair the next year. Samples were acquired from Hasbro and marketing research was carried out – Palitoy employees were given samples to take home for their children to test. The controversy at the time was &quot;should boys be playing with a doll&quot;. Palitoy (as Hasbro before) ignored these concerns and the word &quot;doll&quot; was banned when discussing the new toy. 

A name was needed and Gee Advertising was commissioned to come up with some ideas. A list was passed around the company (as remembered by Stuart Moore, designer of the successful Tiny Tears) for people to cast their preference. One name remembered was &quot;Ace 21&quot; because the mannequin had 21 separate components. Both Peter Watson, of Gees, and Les Cooke, Palitoy Brand Manager (later to become managing director), claim authorship of the name Action Man, but it was Sales Manager Harry Trowell who suggested the name to Miles Fletcher over lunch at the local pub, the Fox and Goose. Eventually after lengthy negotiation a licensing deal to produce the toy using Hasbro tooling and Far East sourcing was agreed in late 1965, just prior to the launch at the British Toy Fair in January 1966.

In the early years, Action Man competed with the entirely British Tommy Gunn by Pedigree Toys who were the producers of the Sindy doll. The Tommy Gunn figure copied aspects of Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe, released two years earlier in the United States. Regardless, Tommy Gunn was generally regarded as a higher quality in terms of equipment and accuracy of accessories, especially since the Action Man of the 1960s was little more than a re-packaged G.I. Joe. He was ultimately unable to compete with Action Man and was discontinued in 1968. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, many other companies produced competition for Action Man, but all were of the cheap blow-moulded variety, which produces thin-walled components lacking the articulation and sturdiness of the Palitoy components, which utilised more costly Injection and Rotational moulding processes.

Action Man was developed with primarily British themes from 1970 onwards: military, adventurers, and sportsman, as Palitoy wanted to distinguish their product line from the U.S. counterpart. (Bill) William A.G. Pugh was the head of Action Man&#x27;s product development at Palitoy, and can be credited with the development of innovations to the product line which included the flocked hair and gripping hands, which crossed over to the G.I. Joe line. Hasbro realised adding a new feature to the manikin helped to maintain sales and developed the Eagle Eyes, which was adopted by Palitoy for Action Man, and by extension to that of other Hasbro licensees.

One series that truly set Palitoy&#x27;s line apart from Hasbro&#x27;s was the &quot;Ceremonials&quot;. Although Hasbro had a set of Cadet ceremonial outfits, they did not match the scope and range of the British versions, which also included a horse of the Life Guards with full ceremonial regalia as an optional set. The non-military was also covered with adventurous elements such as mountain rescue, Arctic exploration, scuba and deep sea diving. One outfit was only available through the Action Man stars scheme; the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (and accompanying mastiff dog). In the G.I. Joe lineup, this outfit was sold with figure in a variety of configurations through Hasbro Canada.

===Hasbro relaunch===
The military style Action Man toys made a brief resurgence in the early 1990s, but between 1995 and 2006 Hasbro used the name without any military theme as a modern adventurer complete with arch-enemies Dr. X and Professor Gangrene. Marketing changed from producing a basic figure with the option to buy several different outfits to each product being its own stand-alone figure, with included accessories such as an outfit and equipment for a given &quot;mission&quot;. This specialisation together with improved production techniques led to figures with built-in abilities, such as karate moves or a working blowpipe. 

A tie-in &quot;Action Man&quot; animated series was produced but was only available on video in the UK, because of broadcast rules about advertising to children: a toy could follow a TV production but not the other way around.

A 3 3/4 inch sized Action Man was sold in 2004 as part of a G.I. Joe &#x27;Night Force&#x27; set sold exclusively at the Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us chain of stores in the United States.

===Collectors&#x27; version===

In 2006 Hasbro licensed reproductions of a variety of the original boxed Action Man figures, under the 40th Anniversary &quot;Nostalgic Collection&quot; banner, in a packaging format similar to Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe &quot;40th Anniversary&quot; collection.

===Subsequent revivals===
At the 2011 New York Comic Con, Hasbro distributed a catalogue titled &#x27;UNIT E&#x27; featuring comic strips based on several Hasbro properties, some of which were defunct. Among the latter toy ranges was a new iteration of Action Man, dubbed &#x27;The Action Man&#x27;. However, the comic was produced as a &quot;brain storming&quot; concept, and the comic&#x27;s introduction specifically noted that none of the concepts within the book were guaranteed to ever see production or release.

The Action Man character was again rebooted by IDW Publishing in 2016 for a four-issue limited comic book series. The series was published to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of Action Man, with the cover of each issue featuring the original Palitoy-era Action Man logo.

==Appearance: 1966–1984==
===Figure construction===

The original 1964 Action Man had a moulded vinyl painted head (which sometimes shrank and became harder, as with Hasbro&#x27;s figures), with a livid scar on the cheek registered as a trademark, identical to G.I. Joe. Talking Commander figures often have the soft vinyl painted head also used for talking G.I. Joe figures. Action Man figures of the seventies tend to have a pinker colouration than G.I. Joe; the feet are of the smaller original G.I. Joe variety. They were held together by elastic with crimped metal eyelets through which rivets passed, for the legs, and metal hooks retaining the neck post and shoulders. 

Pre-1970 bodies used the painted-rivets similar to G.I. Joe, 1970–1977 bodies have chromed rivets which were not used on the Hasbro U.S. version. Especially noticeable with 1970 is that on figures, the limb sections tend to be slightly smaller than the G.I. Joe counterpart, hence Action Man is slightly shorter in height, very similar to the &quot;Masterpiece Edition&quot; G.I. Joe. The pelvis, also smaller, has an extra ridge on each side immediately above the buttocks, which also distinguishes it from the U.S. version, trademarkings aside. The Canadian G.I. Joe body uses this pelvis. Bodies from 1978 on are all-plastic construction, with a flexible rubber connection for the neck post (this is subject to deterioration). 

===Gripping Hands===
The initial releases had hands that were virtually identical to those of G.I. Joe. The hands were always an element of frustration, as observed by (Bill) William A.G. Pugh during setups for the annual toy fairs; he found it was hard to get them to really hold any of the accessories securely. Being of hard vinyl construction, glue had to be used to secure the accessories. As a result, gripping hands were the next feature to be introduced in 1973; the hard moulded hands of the original were replaced by a flexible vinyl. These hands were invented by Bill Pugh and designed and sculpted by Chief Designer, Bob Brechin, using his left hand as a model. 

A modified, simpler version was used by Hasbro for G.I. Joe in 1974. A thimble was provided with each boxed figure to protect the fingers when changing its outfit. The early (pre 1978) vinyl is prone to breakdown as with the G I Joe version; the deterioration of 73–77 flex hands includes hardening of the outer layers, cracks, discolouration, fingers breaking off and sometimes shrivelling.

===Flocked hair and Eagle Eyes===
The first innovation for Action Man was a form of flocking giving the effect of a short &quot;fuzzy&quot; hairstyle in 1970, very similar to the hair flocking used on early &quot;Ken&quot; dolls produced by Mattel. Bill Pugh contacted the company he saw on a TV programme producing bottles covered with a flocked fibre. Dracon Limited, whose promotional items included a flocked car, provided the basis for the electrostatic process that would give Action Man his new look. 

With the introduction of the soft flock-haired head, all figures came with blue eyes unlike the painted heads and G.I. Joe Adventurers that still had brown eyes in some instances. This flocking innovation crossed back over the Atlantic and was introduced for G.I. Joe within the year. The equipment for Hasbro&#x27;s G.I. Joe was assembled and tested in the UK before being crated and shipped to Hong Kong for mass production. Hong Kong was also the location of Palitoy&#x27;s production. G.I. Joe&#x27;s &quot;sea adventurer&quot; was a bearded redhead, never used in the UK market. 

The Action Man Sailor now dressed for the Royal Navy sported a similarly produced beard in blonde or brown only. Unlike G.I. Joe, Action Man was truly ubiquitous; he had only one face, regardless of euro-centric nationality, whereas G.I. Joe had two ethnic variants, commonly referred to as &quot;Foreign Heads&quot;; one European, one Japanese. Palitoy did not market the brown-skinned figure sold as African American in the pre-1970s G.I. Joe lineup.

For the initial 1970–71 production run, some &quot;soft&quot; painted heads were treated to the flock-haired makeover by Palitoy and distributed to the public. These figures are commonly found as the blue-eyed variant, but the rare combination of flocked hair and brown eyes can also be found on an original Action Man. There are also a range of skin tones, some were paler, some were warmer in tone; all these permutations give each and every figure a personality of their own. The fact that these were hand-painted is often evidenced in the appearance of variations such as mismatched eye colouration. Given the length of time the figure was in production, it is quite possible to find heads that have been altered, but that still may appear to be &quot;factory&quot;. The only Action Man that came with sideburns and not a full beard, was the &quot;Georgie Best&quot; footballer figure.

The next major shift in marketing of the doll occurred with the introduction of an improved head with &quot;Eagle Eyes&quot; in 1976, which had been invented by George W. Ptaszek and James A. King at Hasbro. The design utilized a mechanism operated by a simple lever at the back of the head, moving the gaze of the eyeballs back and forth – an improvement on the fixed stare of the original albeit at the price of a slightly larger head, and the loss of the original facial features of the previous 10 years. For Action Man, the head was only available in brown and blonde hair and only blue eyes, with bearded versions of each, GI Joe also had red flocking.

===Trademarkings and ID tags===
From 1966 to 1977, he was tagged on his lower back &quot;Made in England By Palitoy Under Licence From Hasbro ® 1964&quot;, instead of on his right buttock, as was G.I. Joe. Early talker variants were similarly marked. Later standard figures from 1978 to 1984 were marked &quot;CPG Products Corp 1978&quot;. Later talker variants were marked &quot;© 1975 Hasbro® Pat Pend Pawt R.I. Made in Japan&quot; or &quot;General Mills. Toy Group. Europe © 1975 Pat. No. 1458647&quot;. Talker torsos were held together with 2 screws recessed in the left and right shoulders, and from 1978, 2 additional screws above the hip line.

Early Action Man came with a dogtag similar to G.I. Joe&#x27;s; a thin stamped aluminum tag. From 1970 on, Palitoy devised their own design, made of hard plastic with &quot;bullet holes&quot; passing through the logo, and cast in grey or green, which was used until the 1980s. Talkers have the tag attached directly to the pull cord, standard bodies have the tag attached to a small chain. In the 1980s, a modified identity tag with decals to be applied was released; these decals vary according to the figure. On talker figures, the tag was tied directly to the pull-string, on standard bodies, it was suspended by a black cord around the neck. The Hasbro-authorised reproductions of the 1960s metal and 1970s identity tags are virtually indistinguishable from the original.

All original Action Man uniforms were tagged inside the neck collar; the early issue even had the bullet holes of the box logo. This was later discontinued. The fabric used for the tags also varied, by the late seventies/early eighties a synthetic fabric was used.

===Body variations 1978–84===
In 1977, the official catalogue included four new figures. Three of them were variations on the standard Action Man; a cyborg Atomic Man (influenced by &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; television series), a dark-skinned (African ethnic) Commando Tom Stone, a red and silver superhero Bullet Man, and lastly a brutish Neanderthal look-alike; The Intruder, which was a minimally articulated figure. All were taken from Hasbro, though Atomic Man although taken from the same mould as G.I. Joe&#x27;s &quot;Mike Powers&quot;, was given flocked hair and a silver plastic &quot;Heart Plug&quot; with a black button in its center. &quot;Tom Stone&quot; was a repackaged African-ethnic Hasbro Muscle Body Action Adventurer, Palitoy never produced any of the ethnic figures in the line themselves. Both Bullet Man and Tom Stone utilized the body Hasbro patented: &quot;Posable figure having one piece connector for torso, legs&quot;.

From 1978 to the end of the original period of Action Man in 1984, the body was replaced with an entirely new design: at a glance, the most obvious detail is fact that the flesh coloured pelvic area of the body was replaced with a blue section giving the effect of blue shorts rather than the sexless mannequin look; at the same time the body took on a more muscular tone. This body type was known as the &quot;Dynamic Physique. This was mainly designed by Designer Ivor Edmunds, with help from Chief Designer Bob Brechin under the direction of Bill Pugh. Tooling and material selection was under the supervision of Process Manager Alec Langton.

The tooling that produced the components for the Hasbro designed manikin were wearing badly and delivering poor quality mouldings; this was because the tooling was, what is known as &quot;family tools&quot; (all components to produce the limbs of the manikin were moulded on the same tool), it meant that if one component was below standard the whole shot was potentially scrap. However what was happening in production was that the good components were used but there became an imbalance in the numbers of good components, so substandard mouldings were reworked to make them acceptable and good components were ground up with bad components and the sprues for remoulding. 

This was becoming very uneconomic. The mouldings for the new Dynamique Physique manikin were moulded on non-family hot-runner tools (no sprues to be recycled). That is a separate tool for each component. It was easy to maintain equal numbers of components to make up the figures and the quality was assured. Prototype tooling using the hot-runner system was organised by Alec Langton to prove the manufacturing and design, as well as provide sales samples and product for toy fairs.

The brief for the design was to eliminate rivets and elastic of the Hasbro design yet maintain full manoeuvrability of the manikin. A construction based on snap-together components (known as the &quot;skeleton&quot;) covered by an outer moulding (the &quot;muscles&quot;) was devised for the arms and legs which were assembled by hand (no jigs and fixtures needed). The assembled limbs were held in a two-part torso (&quot;clam shell&quot; design) which was sonic welded together (the only mechanical process involved). The biggest challenge to the designers was the design of the hip area. The final solution, and thus maintaining the full manoeuvrability of the figure, was solved by Designer Peter Mansell. Figures from the prototype tooling were produced with green underpants, whereas in production they were moulded blue. The U.S. patent was applied for in November 1977.

The Dynamique Physique figure continued until Action Man was &quot;demobbed&quot; in 1984. A new marketing feature was required and in 1980 a notch was added to the neck (like an Adam&#x27;s Apple) to allow the head to be held back in a &quot;sharpshooter&quot; pose. This was the idea of Toby Hawkes, the son of John Hawkes, who was design director after Bill Pugh.

The talking Action Commander released in the late sixties issued eight commands at random (depending on how far out is pulled the cord): &quot;This is your commander speaking&quot;, &quot;Enemy aircraft action stations&quot;, &quot;Volunteer needed for a special mission&quot;, &quot;Enemy in sight: range 1000&quot;, &quot;Action Man patrol fall in&quot;, &quot;Hold your fire until I give the order&quot;, &quot;Mortar attack dig in&quot;, and &quot;Commander to base request support fire&quot;. The Dynamic Physique Talker introduced in 1978 had only five commands: &quot;Enemy Tanks Approaching&quot;, &quot;Give Me Some Cover&quot;, &quot;Send Out The Patrol&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;s the password&quot; and &quot;Advance in Single File&quot;.

==Soldier==
Action Man &quot;Soldier&quot; figure appeared in 1966 using the Hasbro GI Joe box graphics and US army outfit. In 1970 the UK outfit and revised Palitoy box graphics were introduced. It became one of the most popular Action Man figures. The figure from 1973 consisted of olive green jumper, trousers, scarf, black beret, and boots, with rifle.

==Sailor==
Action Man &quot;Sailor&quot; figure appeared in 1966 using the Hasbro GI Joe box graphics and US sailor outfit. In 1970 the UK outfit and revised Palitoy box graphics were introduced.

==Desert fighter==
Action Man &quot;Desert Fighter&quot; figure is one of the rarest original Action Man figures, who appeared in 1975. Figure only wore khaki shorts, bush hat, and boots, with Thompson submachine gun.

==Adventurer==
Action Man &quot;Adventurer&quot; figure appeared in 1970. Usually bearded, the figure wore a jumper, jeans, and boots.

===Spacemen===
A new line was released featuring spacemen: Captain Zargon (the Space Pirate), and Zargonite and Space Ranger Captain. Captain Zargon used the same body mould, but in black plastic with silver printed tattoos and a &quot;skull&quot; head inside a moulded helmet. At the same time, Action Man gained a new set of equipment under the &quot;Space Ranger&quot; title, including a &quot;Space speeder&quot;, a two-man four-in-one vehicle, and the single occupant &quot;Solar Hurricane&quot;. 

The outfits were futuristic rather than previous space suits which had been based on the equipment of the Gemini and Apollo missions. Subsequent Space Rangers had cloth outfits, rather than the somewhat impractical rubber of the first release. One Space Ranger produced by Palitoy was only sold in the European market under the &quot;Group Action Joe&quot; licensee as Captain Cosmos. 

Another Space Ranger was the Millennium 2000 Special Edition. In 1980, one more figure not based on the Action Man doll was added: &quot;ROM&quot; the Robot, licensed from Parker Brothers and originally called Rom Spaceknight, that would be adapted into a long-running comic book series by Marvel.

==Packaging: 1960s–80s==
===Figure boxes===
The initial releases of the basic figures were packaged in boxes just slighter taller than the figure, with dynamic graphics depicting the figures in action poses on the front and back, with photos of the various accessory sets on the left and right side panels. The graphics were direct copies of those used for the U.S. 1964–1968 production G.I. Joe. The boxes featured wood grain background detail for soldiers, blue background for sailor, and yellow/brown for pilot.

The boxes opened at the top, rather than the lidded version used in the U.S., for G.I. Joe. The figure enclosed was dressed in basic fatigues appropriate to the military branch, but since this did not match the box graphics, it raised truth in advertising issues, since the purchaser could rightly assume the contents &quot;should&quot; match the packaging. As a result, the boxes were modified to include a photo image on the lower right of the actual contents. From 1970 on, the graphics depicted the actual dressed figure as enclosed.

===Wooden footlocker===
As with G.I. Joe, during the 1960s, Action Man had a wooden footlocker (Kit locker box) with a plastic tray insert to store his accessories in. It is overall dimensionally identical to the G.I. Joe item, but the production details varied.

===Uniform sets===
Starting in 1970, Palitoy largely departed from Hasbro&#x27;s lineup though some items and accessories and vehicles were still based on Hasbro&#x27;s moulds. Palitoy created a wide range of uniform sets for the UK market. British military formed a large part of this range, with ceremonial outfits being among the most spectacular. From a collectors standpoint, they are very desirable. Many outfits were available as complete boxed figure sets. Some outfits were sold in a box format, some came with a Locker Box to store the outfit when not in use. 

There were six &quot;soldiers of the century&quot;, which matched Hasbro&#x27;s six &quot;soldiers of the world&quot;, with the exception of the Japanese outfit and figure, which was never offered in the Palitoy range. These sets included an &quot;intelligence manual&quot; that covered all the available offerings in the lineup, and pages on light and heavy weapons, officer rank insignia, and morse code. As with G.I. Joe, early issue clothing is consistently of a heavier and more durable fabric although in terms of scale, the thinner fabric is more appropriate. 

The standard boxed soldier from 1973 onwards was outfitted with the then current &quot;NATO&quot; pullover, khaki lightweight trousers, short boots, scarf, black beret, and SLR rifle typical of the British Army barracks wear of the time. A contemporary boxed talking field officer was also available. The deep sea diver was so innovative it was also patented by Sam Speers.

===Uniform details===
Palitoy was quite particular about the level and attention to detail for their uniforms and accessory detailing; in some respects, some outfits were fairly simplistic compared to the actual outfit (certainly in comparison to the level of detail achieved with modern offerings from Dragon and other action figure companies) as can be seen in any of the product catalogs on offer from a variety of online vendors. Palitoy created appropriate insignia, such as the British Royal Military Police Cap and other uniform. The standard dropped by the end of the 1970s for number of reasons, not the least of which being rising production costs. With 1960s and early 1970s variations, often they were die-cast instead of plastic, the uniforms themselves were of heavy cotton and chevrons were typically embroidered and sewn on, rather than paper decals. Over the many years Action Man was in production, almost every item produced for the line had a multitude of variations.

===Boxed sets===
Over the course of Action Man production, a wide variety of boxed sets were sold; one popular at the time of the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Colditz&quot; television series in the 1970s was &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot;, which provided both. Included were reproductions of a variety of Prisoner of war artifacts from Colditz, and a history. An &quot;Escape from Colditz&quot; board game had already been released by Parker Brothers (UK), a division of Palitoy.

The Radio BackPack was also sold in a deluxe set with Action Man Field Officer. Spain&#x27;s Geyperman, although a Hasbro Licensee, used Palitoy&#x27;s product line as the basis for their products.

===Literature and star scheme===
All boxed figures came with certain pieces of literature, usually an &quot;Equipment Manual&quot;, a catalogue of then current offerings that children could wish for, a star scheme card and a usage guide for the specific figure type that illustrated how to use and care for the flex hands, eagle eyes, etc., as appropriate.

Some outfits and figure sets came with instructions for proper use and care, they illustrate the identical items offered for G.I. Joe at that time; the only variation is the absence of Marine items offered in the U.S.

Other related items were also produced; in the 1960s–70s there were companion leaflets for various sets that provided background information on the actual activity/military division. In 1977 six novels were published under the pseudonym Mike Brogan, and into the 1980s, Action Man annuals were released.

Virtually all Action Man packaging from 1966 came with stars; the more expensive the item, the more stars it came with, with a scale of 1 to 5 stars. These stars were intended to be clipped from the packaging, and affixed to a &quot;Star Scheme&quot; sheet that came with boxed figures. It had spaces for up to 21 stars, and included a list of the various items available for varying numbers of stars collected, with a &quot;free&quot; unclothed figure being the top item. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police, his dog, and various outfits were available over the life of the program, which continued till the end of Action Man&#x27;s production in 1984. Figures redeemed through the star scheme were sent in a plain manila cardboard box. The Star Scheme is credited with the poor availability of intact packaging for collectors.

===Carded accessories and weapons===
Small items were offered on blister pack carding in the 1970s–80s. Earlier versions of the Robin James Sullivan toys from the sixties were identical to G.I. Joes&#x27;; woodgrain background, plastic wrapped, with a small rivet hole for display/retail. The early items mirrored the G.I. Joe releases, and were therefore primarily US weaponry. A vast array of small and heavy weapons were produced and marketed in this manner for the Action Man line. Examples such as the Emergency Highway were sold in the late seventies and early eighties. They were mostly priced to be affordable for children to purchase with their pocket money. Details that varied over the course of time were trademark stamping, colouration and straps; earlier items had elastic straps, later issues had plastic.

===Vehicles===
Among the larger accessories produced for Action Man were versions, not to true 1/6 scale, of current British Army equipment: the Scorpion tank which is the exception in being very true to scale, Spartan armoured personnel carrier, Ferret armoured car, the 105 mm Light Gun, Airportable Land Rover and trailer. A German Sd. Kfz. 222 armoured car was made, albeit with a larger gun than in reality. 

There was a Fire Tender, DUKW, a VTOL &quot;Pursuit&quot; aircraft, Army Helicopter &quot;Capture Helicopter&quot;, backpack Helicopter, &quot;Skyhawk&quot; hang glider, Motorcycle with Sidecar, another true to scale offering; &quot;Power-Hog&quot;, Police motorcycle, Submarine, Multi-terrain vehicle, Jeep, and a Trailer. Other large sets included a Training tower with zip line and the Mobile operations HQ. There was a replica rigid inflatable boat with a battery-powered outboard engine. A Space capsule was produced in 1970, though Great Britain had no crewed spaceflight programme.

==Film==
In 2012, film studio Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films signed a deal to work on a cinematic feature-length live-action film adaptation of Action Man with Hasbro Studios and its subsidiary company Allspark Pictures, along with other Hasbro properties such as the board games Monopoly, with Lionsgate, and Hungry Hungry Hippos. The expectation was that work on the first film, &quot;Monopoly&quot;, would start in 2013. In 2018, Paramount Players said James Bobin will direct the film from Simon Farnaby&#x27;s script.

==Cultural impact==
From 1980 onwards, each box proudly announced that Action Man was &#x27;Toy of the decade&#x27; for the 1970s. In March 2018, Action Man appeared in an advert for Moneysupermarket.com.

During the 1980s to 1990s, the figure was made under licence in Spain under the merchandise trade name of &quot;Geyperman&quot;.

<text>BET Her is an American basic cable television network currently owned by the BET Media Group subsidiary of Paramount Global&#x27;s CBS Entertainment Group. 

The channel originally launched in 1996 as BET on Jazz, a spin-off from BET with a focus on jazz music programming targeting African Americans. By 2006, the network&#x27;s name was shortened to BET J and was carrying a broader array of music-based and demographic-centric, general-interest programming. In 2009, the network relaunched as Centric, with a focus on lifestyle and music programming targeting an upscale audience. Centric would be re-positioned as a general entertainment brand targeting women by 2014, and in 2017, the network would be relaunched under its current name.

, BET Her is available to approximately 33,000,000 pay television households in the United States; down from its 2017 peak of 51,000,000 households.

== History ==
=== Music and general entertainment formats ===
The channel launched on January 15, 1996, as BET on Jazz, as a spin-off channel to BET. It would later be rebranded as BET Jazz in 2002; and BET J, on March 1, 2006.

As BET J, the channel&#x27;s focus shifted from pure jazz programming into general interest offerings. While jazz music still remained the stated primary focus, programming expanded to include a block of Caribbean-oriented programs as well as some R&amp;B, neo soul, reggaetón and alternative hip hop. To a lesser extent, BET J also focused on go-go, electronica and alternative rock. Programs introduced during this era included &quot;My Two Cents&quot; with Keith Boykin, Bryonn Bain, Crystal McCarey Anthony and Staceyann Chin, &quot;The Best Shorts&quot; hosted by Abiola Abrams, &quot;Living the Life of Marley&quot; about Ky-Mani Marley, &quot;My Model is Better Than Your Model&quot; with Eva Pigford and &quot;The Turn On&quot; hosted by Charlotte Burley. 

On April 24, 2009, network officials announced it would rebrand BET J as Centric, a new general entertainment network with lifestyle and music programming targeting &quot;upscale&quot; African-American adults. The new channel was considered to be a competitor to TV One (owned by rival broadcaster Urban One). Centric&#x27;s initial lineup primarily featured programming sourced from other BET&#x27;s corporate siblings, and others that had been previously announced for BET J. The network planned to launch more original programs in 2010, such as the reality series &quot;Keeping Up With The Joneses&quot; and &quot;Model City&quot;. The channel also picked up reruns of the music series &quot;Soul Train&quot;, and revived the &quot;Soul Train&quot; Music Awards. Centric launched on September 28, 2009; its launch day primetime programming featured a tribute to Michael Jackson.

=== Shift to Woman-centric programming ===
At its 2014 upfronts, BET&#x27;s parent company (then known as Viacom) announced that it would re-position Centric as a network targeting African-American women. Included in the repositioning was a development deal with Queen Latifah&#x27;s Flavor Unit Entertainment (which saw a fourth season renewal for its comedy-drama &quot;Single Ladies&quot;, moving from VH1). 

On September 25, 2017, Centric rebranded as BET Her, as part of an ongoing restructuring of Viacom&#x27;s networks around its flagship brands.

== Programming ==
The channel has produced and aired a limited amount of original programming over the years (including &quot;BET Her Presents: The Couch&quot;, and the fourth season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Single Ladies&quot; as Centric). Currently, BET Her&#x27;s main programming consists of reruns and simulcasts of BET programming, along with a morning block of music videos, acquired and syndicated programs, and film telecasts.

<text>Country Music Television, often abbreviated to CMT, is an American pay TV network that launched on March 5, 1983. It is currently owned by Paramount Global through the MTV Entertainment Group unit of its networks division. CMT was the first nationally available channel devoted to country music and country music videos, with its programming also including concerts, specials, and biographies of country music stars. 

Over time, the network&#x27;s programming expanded to incorporate original lifestyle and reality programming, and acquired sitcoms. , CMT is available to approximately 56,000,000 pay television households in the United States; down from its 2011 peak of 93,000,000 households. The channel&#x27;s headquarters are located in One Astor Plaza in New York City, and has additional offices in Nashville, Tennessee. 

== History ==
=== Early years (1983–1997) ===

CMTV, an initialism for Country Music Television, was founded by Glenn D. Daniels, the owner of Video World Productions in Hendersonville, Tennessee. Daniels put together the ownership group of Telestar Corporation and the Blinder Robinson &amp; Company investment bank in a three-way split. Daniels also served as the program director and the first president of the network. The network launched on March 5, 1983, at 6:19 p.m. CT, beating its chief competitor, The Nashville Network, to air by two days. The first video clip to air on CMT was Faron Young&#x27;s 1971 hit &quot;It&#x27;s Four in the Morning&quot;. The following summer, MTV (which would be acquired by Viacom 16 years later) filed a trademark infringement lawsuit over the initials CMTV, and the network changed its name to simply CMT.

In 1991, Opryland USA and its owner Gaylord Entertainment Company acquired CMT in a $34 million deal. The network was sold by a group led by radio station owner Robert Sillerman, record producer James Guercio and Nyhl L Henson. Opryland USA and owner Gaylord also owned CMT&#x27;s competitor The Nashville Network. In October 1992, CMT launched its first international channel, CMT Europe, as part of the Sky Multichannels package. In July 1995, CMT launched its Brazilian version in association with Grupo Abril&#x27;s TVA. By 1998, Gaylord reported $10 million in losses from CMT Europe and decided to cease broadcasting the network on March 31, 1998. Gaylord had planned to emulate the successful model created by E!, by selling large programming blocks to other European channels, but these plans never occurred.

On October 1, 1994, CMT made its first major format change by adding several new music-oriented programs. In 1995, CMT dropped all videos by Canadian artists without U.S. record contracts in response to the network being replaced in Canada by Calgary, Alberta-based New Country Network. By March 1996, CMT had eventually returned the dropped videos to its playlist after reaching an agreement to acquire a 20% ownership of New Country Network, relaunching it as a domestic version of CMT.

=== Under CBS/Viacom (1997–2017) ===

In 1997, both CMT and TNN were sold to Westinghouse, then-owner of CBS, for a reported $1.5 billion. CBS would in-turn be acquired by Viacom in 2000, assuming ownership of CMT and TNN and folding them into the MTV Networks. TNN would phase out country programming to avoid overlap with CMT, changing its full name to &quot;The National Network&quot;. In-spite of the decrease in music programming, in part due to the rise of internet-based platforms in the 2000s, CMT would experience significant ratings gains in the years&#x27; since its acquisition. By 2007, the channel was available in more than 83 million homes. 

On April 4, 2012, CMT announced its first adult animated series, &quot;Bounty Hunters&quot;; and &quot;Trinity 911&quot;, a 10-episode &quot;workplace docu-comedy&quot;. &quot;Trinity 911&quot; was later renamed &quot;Big Texas Heat&quot; and was removed from the schedule after airing four episodes.

On June 10, 2016, CMT announced that they would pick up the ABC series &quot;Nashville&quot; following its cancellation. The network would order a fifth season of 22 episodes.

=== Restructuring (2017–present) ===
In 2017, as part of Viacom&#x27;s restructuring plans, CMT would begin a transition back to unscripted programming. As a result, &quot;Nashville&quot;&#x27;s sixth season would also be its last.

As part of its shift back to unscripted programming, CMT announced &quot;Music City&quot; in September 2017, a reality series created by Adam DiVello of &quot;The Hills&quot; and &quot;Laguna Beach&quot; fame. Set in Nashville, the show features Bryant Lowry, a drummer in the Nashville pop band Jet Black Alley Cat. The series premiered on March 1, 2018.

In 2019, Viacom acquired Pluto TV, and launched several CMT-branded channels, including a channel focused on Western genre movies (CMT Westerns) and a channel dedicated to &quot;Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders: Making the Team&quot;.

In October 2021, CMT picked up the second season of &quot;The Last Cowboy&quot;—a reality series by &quot;Yellowstone&quot; co-creator Taylor Sheridan. The program had moved from Paramount Network following abandoned plans to relaunch the outlet as a movie network.

== Programming ==

CMT&#x27;s current programming consists largely of acquired sitcoms and movies. The channel&#x27;s daily country music programming consists of a five-hour music video block, seen during the early morning hours, as well as &quot;CMT Hot Twenty&quot;, which airs on weekend mornings. Of Paramount&#x27;s former music channels (not counting its suite of all-music digital channels), CMT has historically been the most devoted to music-related programming and previously set aside at least six hours of its daily schedule for music videos during the overnight and morning hours. In addition, most of CMT&#x27;s original programming is centered on, or related to, the Culture of Dallas or Nashville, Tennessee, where the network&#x27;s studios are located.

CMT&#x27;s music mix is primarily focused on mainstream hit country songs, but also includes occasional videos from crossover, Americana, and alternative acts (dubbed &quot;CMT Edge&quot;). Specials seen on the network include the annual &quot;CMT Music Awards&quot; (with an &quot;extended version&quot; airing since 2022, when the live telecast moved to CBS), and &quot;CMT Crossroads&quot;, which pairs country music artists with musicians from other music genres. It also carries simulcasts of MTV and Nickelodeon&#x27;s own award specials as part of Paramount&#x27;s common &quot;road block&quot; event programming strategy.

== International and related networks ==
* CMT Europe - Launched in October 1992 and closed in March 1998.
* CMT Brazil - Launched in July 1995 and closed in March 2001. Replaced by MusicCountry.
* CMT Australia - Launched on July 1, 2020, as a replacement for Country Music Channel. Dedicated to country music videos.
* CMT Canada - Canadian version majority-owned by Corus Entertainment with Paramount owning a 10% stake. During the 2010s, the channel drifted away from country-related programming, phased out CMT&#x27;s original programming (while producing its own programming), and eventually dropped music programming altogether.
* The Nashville Network - A former rival network, TNN became a sibling to CMT in 1997. TNN would eventually shift to a general entertainment format in order to prevent overlap; later relaunching as the male-oriented Spike TV in 2003 and, Paramount Network in 2018.

== CMT Music ==
CMT Music (formerly CMT Pure Country) is an American pay television channel and a sister network to CMT. It exclusively carries country music videos in an 8-hour programming wheel schedule similar to several other video-exclusive networks owned by Paramount Global.

=== History ===

The network was first launched as VH1 Country, a country music video-oriented spinoff of VH1, on August 1, 1998; predating the folding of CBS Cable networks TNN and CMT into Viacom. On May 27, 2006, the channel rebranded as CMT Pure Country to realign the CMT brand to solely represent Viacom&#x27;s country music-related programming.

On January 4, 2016, the network&#x27;s name was changed to CMT Music. Outside of the addition of full-length video tags throughout videos and new imaging, no major changes came to the channel&#x27;s programming. In 2015, the network discontinued specific video blocks due to that year&#x27;s cutbacks throughout Viacom, including music video programmers.

The network has lost carriage throughout time with the growth of streaming video options, being carried solely in standard definition, and CMT no longer being considered a prime network among those in Paramount Global&#x27;s suite. CMT Music has generally been depreciated by Paramount Global in current retransmission consent negotiations with cable and streaming providers for other options; such as Pluto TV, which provides several CMT and Vevo-branded country music channels. in 2021, Spectrum removed it from their current-day packages, with only grandfathered subscribers with older packages able to view the network.

==== Programming ====
Currently, the network offers an eight-hour wheel of videos, all under the EPG-only title of &quot;CMT Music&quot; with little theming of video blocks outside promoting special events such as the CMT Music Awards nominees and winners around the ceremony. As Pure Country, the network featured branded blocks of programming sub-divided by genres and periods of time:
* Pure Vintage featured a mix of classic and vintage country music videos that were filmed and aired prior to 2000, including older performance video clips of songs. The block aired for 30 minutes, twice a day.
* The Edge Bluegrass, neo-traditionalist country, and Americana music videos are featured. Originally branded as Wide Open Country
* Studio 330 Sessions Live sessions recorded at CMT&#x27;s studios in Nashville (330 refers to CMT&#x27;s Nashville address of 330 Commerce Street). Segments from the sessions continue to air in the channel&#x27;s current rotation.
* Pure 12 Pack Countdown As with all of MTV&#x27;s countdown shows, a limited pool of videos was voted on by fans online and sorted by popularity without industry or recording metrics.

<text>Almo Sounds was a record label which was started in 1994 by Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss after they sold A&amp;M Records to PolyGram. The intent for the label was to recreate the initial concept of A&amp;M Records as a small, &quot;boutique&quot; label.

The label signed artists Gillian Welch, Imogen Heap, Ozomatli and Garbage and several other artists. Psychic TV did demos that were rejected for the label. Herb Alpert himself released his &quot;Second Wind&quot;, &quot;Passion Dance&quot;, and &quot;Colours&quot; albums on the label.

A Nashville division was launched in 1995. Headed by record producer Garth Fundis, it released albums by Paul Jefferson, Billy Yates, and Bekka &amp; Billy.

The label has not released new product since 1999 and in 2000 it was sold to Universal Music Group. Commercially viable catalog albums remain available through Interscope Records, a current sister label to A&amp;M.

<text>Kilnsey is a small village in Wharfedale, North Yorkshire, England. It lies on the B6160 road, between the villages of Grassington and Kettlewell, near Arncliffe and just across the River Wharfe from Conistone. The village is north of Skipton and south of Kettlewell.

==History==
The village is mentioned in the Domesday Book as &quot;Chilsie&quot; when it was described as waste. Soon after the Domesday Book had been completed, the lands in and around Kilnsey were given to Edulf de Culnese. The derivation of the name is believed to come from &quot;Kyle&quot; and &quot;Ea&quot;, which means &quot;the chilly stream&quot;.

The most notable feature of Kilnsey is a large limestone cliff called &quot;Kilnsey Crag&quot;, overlooking the road and the River Wharfe from the west. The crag is around 170 feet high, with an overhang of 40 feet. It was painted by J. M. W. Turner in 1816. The crag contains several of Britain&#x27;s most extreme sport climbing routes, such as &quot;Northern Lights&quot; , and &quot;North Star&quot; , by Steve McClure.

West from Kilnsey towards Malham Tarn runs the historic Mastiles Lane, a Roman marching road, later an important route for monks leading sheep from Fountains Abbey to summer pasture on higher ground. This is now a Dales walking track.

The village of Kilnsey is a small collection of stone-built Yorkshire Dales cottages, many dating back to the 1600s. Kilnsey Old Hall is believed to have been a medieval administrative site for the monks of Fountains Abbey who farmed flocks of sheep in the area. Most of the present building dates from 1648.

Kilnsey Park is a visitor attraction and fishing lake that was established in 1978 by the Roberts family. The park offers attractions including fishing, a nature trail and farm animals. There is also a working fish farm, smokehouse, and cafe.

Kilnsey has one pub, the Tennant Arms, named after the Tennant family of Chapel House (on the site of an ancient chapel belonging to Kilnsey Grange, a possession of Fountains Abbey) which owned the Kilnsey Estate from 1572 to 1911.

Each autumn the village hosts Kilnsey Show, one of the largest one-day agricultural shows in the country. The show was officially established in 1897 and regularly attracts over 12,000 visitors, though records dating back to the mid-1800s tell of harness racing and the fell race having been run for most of that century. The timing of the show has been linked as possibly tying in with the saint&#x27;s day for St Mary&#x27;s Church in nearby Conistone. One of the highlights is the Kilnsey Crag Race, a distance of and a climb of which dashes up and down the side of the crag.

On 5 July 2014, the Tour de France Stage 1 from Leeds to Harrogate passed through the village.

===Old Nan===
Old Nan was allegedly a witch living under Kilnsey Crag and well known locally. She was known as far as Skipton, where she had a stand in the market.

<text>Microsoft Development Center Norway (known as FAST (Fast Search &amp; Transfer ASA) before 2010) is a Norwegian company, founded in 1997 and based in Oslo, with offices located in Germany, Italy, Sri Lanka, France, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Brazil, Mexico and other countries around the world. FAST focused on data search technologies.

On April 24, 2008, Microsoft acquired FAST, which is now known as Microsoft Development Center Norway.

FAST offered an enterprise search product, FAST ESP. ESP is a service-oriented architecture development platform which is geared towards production of searchable indexes. It provided a framework for creating ETL applications for indexing of searchable content. Fast also offered a number of search-derivative applications, focused on specific search use cases, including publishing, market intelligence and mobile search. The Search Derivative Applications (SDA) are built upon the Enterprise Search Platform (ESP). The company was developing PHAROS, a new European multimedia search engine.

== Technology ==

===Products===
FAST delivers real-time search and business intelligence products, and currently has about 3,600 implementations. They offer a core search platform, FAST ESP, and develop products on top of the platform. FAST&#x27;s products are used in three areas: external (online and mobile), internal (information access and discovery) and OEM (embedded in other vendor&#x27;s products).

Some examples of their applications were: 
*FAST Ad Momentum for online advertising
*FAST Data Cleansing for cleansing multiple structured data repositories
*FAST Impulse for eCommerce and online catalogs
*FAST Radar for dashboarding and business intelligence

===Technology Ownership===
FAST used complementary technologies from BBN Technologies for speech recognition and Stellent (now part of Oracle) for the conversion of different file formats. In 2007, FAST was sued by a company which claims that FAST, as well as Google, Yahoo, Facebook and other major web companies, stole its technology.

===Research Projects===

====Information Access Disruptions====
Information Access Disruptions (IAD) is a research Centre funded by the Research Council of Norway and the center&#x27;s partners. FAST was the host institution and the research Centre manager was Bjørn Olstad, adjunct professor at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) and Chief Technology Officer of FAST. iAd sought to identify opportunities and develop the next-generation search engines that could extract user-friendly information from vast and complex amounts of data. iAd also facilitated interaction between international content and technology suppliers.

Norwegian partners were the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, the University of Oslo, the University of Tromsø, the Norwegian School of Management, Schibsted and Accenture. International partners are Cornell University, University College Dublin and Dublin City University.

====PHAROS====
The European Commission (EC) funded the research project “The Platform for Search of Audiovisual Resources Across Online Spaces” (PHAROS). The mission of PHAROS was to transform audiovisual search from a point-solution search engine model to an integrated search platform paradigm, incorporating future user and search requirements as key design principles.

==History==

===1997–1999: Development===
FAST was founded in 1997, and the initiation of the company stems from the Department of Computer and Information Science at NTNU. Professor Arne Halaas at NTNU was a substantial contributor in the early days of FAST. John M. Lervik, a student from NTNU, was one of the first employees at FAST. He took his doctorate under the supervision of Professor Tor A. Ramstad and eventually became the company&#x27;s CEO, until January 2009.

During 1998 and 1999, FAST announced strategic alliances with Lycos, Dell and TIBCO, and the first commercial launch of products took place in 1999.

===2000–2003: Commercialization===
During 2000, FAST announced several new European and US customers and partners. The company&#x27;s IPO took place in June 2001, and FAST is publicly traded on the main board of the Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE) under the ticker symbol &#x27;FAST&#x27;. The company continued over the next couple of years to announce new contracts with customers and partners such as eBay, IBM, BEA, Microsoft, Telus, Elsevier, and Broadvision. FAST was ranked number three on the 2002 Deloitte Technology Fast 500, a ranking of the 500 fastest-growing technology companies in Europe.

In 2003, FAST decided to focus on enterprise search, and sells their Internet division, including FAST Web Search, FAST Partner Site and AlltheWeb.com, to Overture Services, Inc. (later acquired by Yahoo!).

===2004–2007: Expansion===
In January 2004, FAST introduced the FAST Enterprise Search Platform (FAST ESP.) to the market. During the following three years, FAST expanded its geographical reach by opening new offices in Asia, Middle East, Latin America and Africa, extended its partnership relations through the introduction of the FAST X10 partner program, and introduced new solutions aimed specifically at certain business areas, like FAST Impulse for eCommerce and FAST Advisor for Internet yellow pages and portals.

The company was for the first time placed in the Leader&#x27;s Quadrant of the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Information Access Technology in 2004, and stayed in the Leader&#x27;s Quadrant over the next years as well. The company almost quadrupled its revenues from 2003 (US$42M) to 2006 ($162M).

FAST acquired Convera&#x27;s RetrievalWare in August 2007 for US$23 million (~$ in ).

Fast&#x27;s Q4 2007 Intra-quarterly update gave enterprise as 30% of its business (page 17). With Q3 2007 enterprise license revenues of less than $4M (~$ in ), it was one of the less significant players in enterprise search market.

=== Late 2007 Decline ===
On 30 July 2007, FAST announced a reduction in revenue of 40% due to changes in financial controls on revenue recognition. It had been forecasting US$55M of Q2 2007 revenue and profitability; in a statement on the company&#x27;s website, it revealed revenue would be reduced to US$35M and it would be unprofitable. According to the company it had been recognizing revenue without signed contracts using Memoranda of Understanding. The shares fell 28% to hit a three-year low.

That, along with problems with lack of customer payment, was raised by Goldman Sachs in a report, written in June 2007 by Moawalla. Finansavisen newspaper on August 6, 2007, ran an article entitled &quot;FAST under investigation again&quot; reporting on an ongoing investigation by the unit of The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway (&quot;Kredittilsynet&quot;) that oversees all listed companies’ financial reporting. On August 8 the company reported actual Q2 2007 numbers with revenue of US$34.1M (license sales down 41% sequentially and 24% y on y) and operating loss of US$38M. As a result of this, the company has announced that it will implement a layoff program of 20% of all staff, reducing the quarterly operational cost base in excess of US$12M, as it tries to return to profitability. It expects to be unprofitable until 2008.

On 5 September 2007, FAST signed a deal with The Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Parks and Resorts Online for the Fast Enterprise Search Platform, including software licenses, maintenance fees and other services. On 7 September, FAST informed investors in its quarterly update that the predicted losses for Q3 would rise again to over $60M, and that the company would be concentrating its remaining resources on the &quot;monetization&quot; or ad serving business managed by their Ad Momentum platform. The downplaying of those older functions and concentration on the new market area was welcomed by financial markets.

===Q3 2007 Results===
FAST received a further blow when a major customer, Schibsted, said it had made a too-risky decision in choosing to implement its own web search engine and was changing its strategy.

Investors and customers were hoping that, to reverse the slide, the company would announce new accounting and quality controls in its Q3 report. However, on 30 October, FAST reported a loss of $100M in the quarter (up from the anticipated $60M loss), with another collapse of license revenue, down 55% year on year, resulting in a significant loss of software market share. The operation of the company as a software company rather than a services company was accompanied by its gross margin falling to 67% from 83% a year earlier. The problems with the non-payment of bills by customers continued, with $26M of debt being written off.

===Board of Directors===
The conduct of FAST&#x27;s directors was the subject of much comment in Norway, with one director resigning and another making public statements about other directors and major shareholders. FAST board member, Robert Keith, told the newspaper Finansavisen: &quot;I ought to have seen the problems in FAST earlier. And I ought to have understood that Hans Gude Gudesen is a crazy liar. Also, I ought have shot Oystein Stray Spetalen the first time I met him. That would have helped a lot of people.&quot; Spetalen and Hans Gude Gudesen were both major shareholders in FAST. Furthermore, directors Keith and Fussel were allegedly being pursued by the Norwegian tax authorities for US$50M in unpaid taxes. In the event of non-payment, there was concern that liability might fall on the company.

The ongoing turmoil saw three directors resign from the board, the last being Johan Fredrik Odfjell, who was quoted in the company&#x27;s release as saying: &quot;FAST faces many challenges and opportunities going forward&quot;.

On 22 December, Orkla, FAST&#x27;s largest shareholder, demanded an extraordinary general meeting to force Fussel and Keith off the board.

===Need to Restate Accounts for 2006 and 2007===
On 12 December 2007, the Oslo Stock Exchange suspended trading of FAST shares. The next morning, the company announced it was reviewing the accounts both for 2006 and the preliminary results for 2007, with the likely outcome that the results would be changed. In an article entitled &quot;Fast restates its accounts&quot;, www.dagensit.no reported that FAST&#x27;s results for 2006 and 2007 might be revised, in what it called &quot;another clean up round.&quot; It also stated: &quot;The Search technology vendor Fast Search &amp; Transfer have had several rounds with restating of accounts.&quot; Some months after CFO Joseph Lacson declared that “everything is cleaned up”, there seemed to be skeletons in the closet. Wednesday afternoon trading was suspended after what the stock exchange called “certain conditions”. The shares fell around 7% on the news.

===Microsoft Acquisition===
On 8 January 2008, it was announced that the board of FAST had unanimously accepted a $1.2 billion takeover offer from Microsoft. Microsoft had secured the backing of FAST&#x27;s two largest institutional shareholders, Orkla and Hermes Focus Asset Management Europe. As of 24 April 2008, 97.37% of all FAST shares were controlled by MACS Holdings Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Microsoft Corp. The stock was de-listed from Oslo Stock Exchange 16 May 2008.

On 26 November 2008, it was reported that FAST Search had laid off 25 employees as a result of the acquisition by Microsoft.

As more information came to light about the major readjustment of the accounts, it was reported that Microsoft might not have completed its due diligence adequately.
On 2 December 2009, Microsoft sold FAST&#x27;s Folio and NXT businesses to Rocket Software. The complementary products were application suites used by businesses to publish and index reference material onto discs, network workstations, and online.

==Criminal Investigation==
On 24 May 2008, Norwegian news website E24.no reported that the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway had asked police to investigate anomalies it had uncovered in the FAST accounts. On 13 October 2008, Norwegian Økokrim raided FAST&#x27;s offices in Oslo.

Under scrutiny by the Norwegian police for possible fraudulent behavior prior to the FAST acquisition by Microsoft, former founder and CEO, John Lervik, resigned from the wholly owned Microsoft subsidiary on 23 January 2009. CTO and Microsoft Distinguished Engineer, Bjørn Olstad, then assumed Lervik&#x27;s duties as the head of Microsoft&#x27;s Enterprise Search Group.

<doc id="928911" wikidata="Q903398" url="?curid=928911" title="Great American Family">
<text>Great American Family is an American cable television network owned by Great American Media, who also operates Great American Faith &amp; Living. The channel broadcasts family-oriented general entertainment programming, including television series and made-for-TV movies.

It was originally established in 1995 by Jones Radio Network as Great American Country (GAC), a country music channel. GAC was later acquired by Scripps Networks and, in turn, Discovery Inc. Under Scripps, GAC&#x27;s format was widened to include lifestyle programming pertaining to the American Heartland and the South, but the network did continue carrying some country music-related programming for a period.

On June 28, 2021, GAC was acquired by GAC Media—a new ownership group that includes former Crown Media CEO Bill Abbott and Hicks Equity Partners. On September 27, 2021, the network was relaunched as GAC Family (later Great American Family), with a format and original programming strategy mirroring Abbott&#x27;s former employer Hallmark Channel (including an emphasis on original television films tied to holidays), and leveraging talent previously associated with that network. The previous country lifestyle format was moved to Ride TV—a second channel acquired by GAC Media–which was concurrently relaunched as the sister network GAC Living (later Great American Faith &amp; Living). In 2022, Abbott described the network as featuring a mix of secular and &quot;soft&quot; faith-based programming.

As of February 2015, GAC was available to approximately 59 million television households (51% of pay television customers) in the United States.

==History==
=== As Great American Country ===

The channel was launched on December 31, 1995, with the first music video to be broadcast on the channel, Garth Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Thunder Rolls&quot;. The channel was originally owned by the Centennial, Colorado-based Jones Radio Network.

On October 12, 2004, Scripps Networks acquired Great American Country from Jones Radio Network.

In late 2005, television industry trade publication &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; named GAC as one of TV&#x27;s &quot;Breakout Networks&quot;, saying of the channel: &quot;The emerging GAC is a younger, hipper version [of CMT] that respects Nashville&#x27;s country roads but widens the boulevards.&quot;

In December 2007, the network announced a partnership with ABC Radio Networks (now Cumulus Media Networks) to produce &quot;GAC Nights: Live from Nashville&quot;, a syndicated country music radio show broadcast from GAC&#x27;s Music Row studios and hosted by GAC personalities Suzanne Alexander, Storme Warren, and Nan Kelley.

In July 2008, Scripps Networks was spun off from the E. W. Scripps Company as Scripps Networks Interactive.

On October 1, 2013, the network unveiled a new logo inspired by the U.S. flag, dropping the &quot;GAC&quot; acronym in favor of using the &quot;Great American Country&quot; name in full. The network stated that it wanted to emphasize its expansion from a country music-oriented channel to one with a larger emphasis on &quot;country&quot; as referring to a &quot;sense of place&quot; and lifestyles (citing programming such as &quot;Celebrity Motor Homes&quot; and &quot;Farm Kings&quot; as examples). With the channel&#x27;s rebranding, the daily music video show &quot;Daily Countdown&quot; was renamed &quot;Great American Playlist&quot;. &quot;Top 20 Country Countdown&quot; continued to air (it was cancelled in December 2018), and the network still offered country music specials including &quot;Backstory&quot;, &quot;Introducing&quot; and &quot;Origins&quot;.

In March 2018, Discovery Inc. acquired Scripps Networks Interactive.

=== As GAC Family/Great American Family ===

On June 7, 2021, GAC Media, a Fort Worth-based investment group led by private equity investor Tom Hicks and former Crown Media Holdings CEO Bill Abbott announced that it would acquire Great American Country from Discovery Inc.; the company had recently announced its intent to merge with WarnerMedia. GAC Media would also acquire the equestrian network Ride TV. Abbott had abruptly stepped down from Crown Media in January 2020, shortly after Hallmark Channel was criticized for pulling commercials from the wedding registry Zola that included a lesbian couple.

In August 2021, GAC Media announced that it would relaunch Great American Country as GAC Family on September 27, with the GAC initials re-backronymed to stand for &quot;Great American Channels&quot;; The channel was repositioned as a family-oriented general entertainment service with similarities to Hallmark Channel, which Abbot had previously overseen as Crown Media CEO. The previous country lifestyle format was assumed by Ride TV, which concurrently rebranded as the sister channel GAC Living. 

GAC Family would mirror many of the programming strategies that Abbott developed while overseeing Hallmark Channel, including original made-for-TV movies and holiday programming. The network has signed deals with a number of actors that have been associated with Hallmark Channel productions, including Trevor Donovan, Jen Lilley, Jessica Lowndes, Jesse Metcalfe, Danica McKellar, and Cameron Mathison, to appear in GAC Family original movies. On April 19, 2022, it was announced that GAC Media had hired Candace Cameron Bure—who had a long-standing relationship with Hallmark Channel dating back to 2008—as its chief content officer, and that she would develop, produce and star in original romantic comedies and holiday content for its networks.

During GAC Media&#x27;s first upfronts presentation in April 2022, Abbott told &quot;Broadcasting &amp; Cable&quot; that the quick transition to GAC Family did not give them enough time to promote the channel to advertisers—many of whom had already made their advertising commitments for the fourth quarter—leaving it unable to fully capitalize from the Christmas holiday season in 2021. However, Abbott felt that the market would be &quot;pretty strong&quot; in 2022, and believed that the network was &quot;certainly selling family-friendly content and quality original movies with talent that people love and resonate with viewers&quot;. The network slated 18 new original movie premieres for Great American Christmas in 2022. He also revealed plans for new digital platforms, including a free ad-supported streaming service known as &quot;Great American Adventure&quot;, and a &quot;fan portal&quot; that would allow users to interact with GAC talent. 

In July 2022, GAC Media announced a corporate rebranding that would replace the &quot;GAC&quot; prefix with &quot;Great American&quot;, with GAC Family being rebranded as Great American Family on August 20, 2022, and GAC Media changing its trade name to Great American Media.

On February 6, 2024, Mario Lopez announced a multi-year deal with Great American Media to appear in productions across its properties, with Lopez expected to be involved in Great American Family&#x27;s slate of Christmas movies for 2024.

==Programming==
Great American Family is positioned as a family-oriented channel with original series and movies reflecting &quot;American culture, lifestyle and heritage&quot;, and emphasizing &quot;relationships and the emotional connections related to holidays, seasons and occasions&quot;. Abbott stated that the network planned to feature &quot;soft faith&quot; and secular programming, describing the market for faith-based programming as being &quot;grossly underserved&quot;.

The network acquired season 2 of &quot;When Hope Calls&quot;, a spin-off of Hallmark Channel&#x27;s &quot;When Calls the Heart&quot; that originally aired on the network&#x27;s streaming service Hallmark Movies Now. In February 2022, it acquired reruns of the &quot;Full House&quot; sequel series &quot;Fuller House&quot;, which was originally produced for Netflix. 

Under its previous ownership, original programming included series such as &quot;Kimberly&#x27;s Simply Southern&quot;, a cooking show featuring Kimberly Schlapman of the country group Little Big Town; &quot;Farm Kings&quot;, a reality show chronicling the King family of Freedom Farms; and &quot;Celebrity Motorhomes&quot;. From 2011 through 2013, GAC broadcast the National Finals Rodeo.

Following the cancellation of Hallmark Channel&#x27;s annual &quot;Kitten Bowl&quot; special (a feline-centric parallel to Animal Planet&#x27;s annual &quot;Puppy Bowl&quot; special, which airs on the day of the Super Bowl), the network announced that it would present a similar event known as the &quot;Great American Rescue Bowl&quot; in 2023, with host Beth Stern moving over to the new program.

In July 2023, it was announced that Great American Family would broadcast the Tournament of Roses Parade beginning in 2024 under a multi-year deal, replacing Hallmark Channel as its &quot;official&quot; cable broadcaster (notwithstanding the event also being carried on cable by Cowboy Channel).

=== Content standards ===
In a November 2022 interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, chief creative officer Candace Cameron Bure stated her desire to produce movies with stronger faith-based themes for Great American Family, explaining that GAC &quot;wanted to promote faith programming and good family entertainment&quot;. She stated, &quot;I think that Great American Family will keep traditional marriage at the core.&quot; Of Bure&#x27;s implication that Great American Media productions would never depict same-sex couples, Abbott responded, &quot;It&#x27;s certainly the year 2022, so we&#x27;re aware of the trends. There&#x27;s no whiteboard that says, &#x27;Yes, this&#x27; or &#x27;No, we&#x27;ll never go here.

Bure&#x27;s remarks faced criticism from members and supporters of the LGBT community, as they were believed to be an allusion to the increasing use of progressive themes—such as recognition of LGBT relationships—in Hallmark Channel productions. In response to the criticism, Bure stated that people of various &quot;identities&quot; worked on Great American Media programming, and that &quot;all of you who know me, know beyond question that I have great love and affection for all people.&quot; In December 2022, actor Neal Bledsoe announced via social media that he would end his relationship with GAC Media, stating that &quot;the thought that my work could be used to deliberately discriminate against anyone horrifies and infuriates me&quot;, and that &quot;I could never forgive myself for continuing my relationship with a network that actively chooses to exclude the LGBTQIA+ community&quot;. In October 2023, Abbott distanced himself from Bure&#x27;s statements, stating that they were not on behalf of Great American Media.

== Carriage ==
On November 5, 2010, AT&amp;T U-verse dropped all Scripps Networks, including GAC, due to a carriage dispute over an increase in retransmission fees. Two days later the dispute was resolved.

In October 2021, GAC Media reached an agreement with over-the-top service Frndly TV.

In November 2021, Philo and GAC Media reached a deal to add GAC Living and GAC Family to the service beginning in early December 2021.

<text>Jacob Letterstedt (December 15, 1796 – March 18, 1862), born Lallerstedt in Östergötland, was a Swedish businessman who settled in the Cape Colony (part of present-day South Africa). He arrived at Cape Town in 1820, where he made his fortune in the grain trade. Later he founded the company that became South African Breweries. In 1839 he was appointed acting Consul of Sweden-Norway, in 1841 ordinary Consul and in 1857 Consul General.

Letterstedt donated money to several prizes and to the Letterstedt Association, which promotes Nordic cooperation. In 1860, he was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The same year he returned to Europe and was living in Paris at the time of his death.

<doc id="928923" wikidata="Q546298" url="?curid=928923" title="Samuel Prideaux Tregelles">
<text>Samuel Prideaux Tregelles (30 January 1813 – 24 April 1875) was an English biblical scholar, lexicographer, Christian Hebraist, textual critic, and theologian.

== Life ==
Tregelles was born at Wodehouse Place, Falmouth, of Quaker parents, but he himself was for many years in communion with the Plymouth Brethren and then later in life became a Presbyterian (or perhaps an Anglican). 
He was the son of Samuel Tregelles (1789–1828) and his wife Dorothy (1790–1873) and was the nephew of Edwin Octavius Tregelles. He was educated at Falmouth classical school from 1825 to 1828.

For a time Tregelles worked at the ironworks, Neath Abbey, Glamorgan, where he devoted his spare time to learning Greek, Hebrew, Aramaic, and Welsh. His interest in Welsh developed from a desire to spread the Christian gospel and especially to combat the influence of atheism, Roman Catholicism, and Mormonism in Wales. Tregelles became a private tutor in Falmouth, and finally devoted himself to scholarship until incapacitated by paralysis in 1870.

In April 1839, Tregelles married Sarah Anna Prideaux (born 22 September 1807), a daughter of the Plymouth banker and Quaker Walter Prideaux, whose bank &quot;Hingston &amp; Prideaux&quot; later became the &quot;Devon and Cornwall Bank&quot;. They had no children. Tregelles received an LL.D. degree from St. Andrews in 1850 and a pension of £200 from the civil list in 1862. He died at Plymouth.

== Works ==
Deciding that the &quot;Textus Receptus&quot; did not rest on ancient authority, Tregelles decided to publish a new version of the Greek text of the New Testament based on ancient manuscripts and the citations of the early Church Fathers, his work paralleling that of German philologist and textual critic, Karl Lachmann. Tregelles first became generally known through his &quot;Book of Revelation in Greek Edited from Ancient Authorities&quot; (1844), which contained the announcement of his intention to prepare the new Greek New Testament. In 1845 he went to Rome intending to collate the codex belonging to the Vatican. Although he was not allowed to copy the manuscript, he did note important readings. From Rome he went to Florence, Modena, Venice, Munich, and Basel, reading and collating manuscripts. He returned to England in November 1846, continuing to collate manuscripts in the British Museum. Tregelles also visited Paris, Hamburg, Berlin (where he met Lachmann), and Leipzig (where he collaborated with Constantin von Tischendorf), Dresden, Wolfenbüttel, and Utrecht.

Most of his numerous publications had reference to his great critical edition of the New Testament (1857–1872). They include an &quot;Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament&quot; (1854), a new edition of T. H. Horne&#x27;s &quot;Introduction&quot; (1860), and Canon Muratorianus: &quot;Earliest Catalogue of Books of the New Testament&quot; (1868). Tregelles was a member of the English revision committee overseeing the preparation of the Bible translation known as the Revised Version (or English Revised Version), of which the New Testament was published in 1881, six years after his death.

Tregelles also wrote &quot;Heads of Hebrew Grammar&quot; (1852), translated Gesenius&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew and Chaldee Lexicon&quot; (1846, 1857) from Latin, and was the author of a little work on the Jansenists (1851) and of various works in exposition of his special eschatological views including &quot;Remarks on the Prophetic Visions of Daniel&quot; (1852, new ed., 1864) and &quot;The Hope of Christ&#x27;s Second Coming&quot; (1864). Like his cousin by marriage, Benjamin Wills Newton, who was instrumental in Tregelles&#x27;s conversion and who helped finance publication of his books, Tregelles was a post-tribulationist.

An acquaintance said of Tregelles that he was &quot;able to shed a light upon any topic that might be introduced&quot;, but that to ask him a question was dangerous because &quot;doing so was like reaching to take a book and having the whole shelf-full precipitated upon your head&quot;. Despite his erudition, Tregelles was also a warm-hearted evangelical who wrote many hymns, now largely forgotten, the earliest of which were published in the Plymouth Brethren&#x27;s &quot;Hymns for the Poor of the Flock&quot; (1838).

<text>NPG Records is a record label that was owned by Prince and run by Trevor Guy. &quot;NPG&quot; is short for New Power Generation. It was founded to release his music after Paisley Park Records was shut down by Warner Bros. Records in 1994.

Though the 1994 compilation &quot;1-800-NEW-FUNK&quot; featured several artists, NPG Records never developed into a full label like Paisley Park did; instead, it exclusively released Prince&#x27;s albums or side-projects.

<text>Mark Dacey (born June 22, 1966) is a Canadian curler originally from Saskatchewan. He was based at the Mayflower Curling Club in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

Dacey is a former Canadian men&#x27;s curling champion skip, having won the 2004 Nokia Brier. He defeated Randy Ferbey&#x27;s team, ending their 3-year Brier winning streak. Dacey went on to win a bronze medal at the 2004 Ford World Curling Championship.

==Competitive history==
Mark Dacey was a runner-up in the 1995 Brier, as the vice-skip for team Saskatchewan (skipped by Brad Heidt). After meeting at the 1995 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship, Dacey started dating 1991 Canadian Junior champion Heather Smith, and moved to New Brunswick to be with her for the 1995–96 season. While in New Brunswick, he skipped a team to the final of the 1996 provincial men&#x27;s championship, where he lost to Mike Kennedy. After the season, Dacey returned to his hometown of Saskatoon to rejoin the Heidt rink while Smith went to school in Scotland. Dacey only played one season in Saskatchewan before he and Smith moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1997.

Representing Nova Scotia, he reached the 2001 Nokia Brier, finishing with a 6-5 record, and at the 2003 Nokia Brier in Halifax, he finished third during the round-robin, with a 7-4 record. They lost the final to Randy Ferbey.

Dacey also won the 2002 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship. In 2005, Dacey was unable to win the Nova Scotia men&#x27;s championship, precluding him from defending his National title at the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. In 2006, Dacey recaptured the provincial championship to return to the Brier. His team finished 7-4 in the round-robin, and defeated Alberta&#x27;s Kevin Martin in the first playoff game. They lost to eventual champion Jean-Michel Ménard of Quebec in the semifinal, securing a third-place finish.

The Dacey team announced it was taking a year off as of Tuesday April 9, 2007.

However, in the 2008 Nova Scotia provincials, the team was back minus Dacey. Bruce Lohnes (Third), Rob Harris (Second), Andrew Gibson (Lead), curled in the provincial finals with Colleen Jones&#x27; husband Scott Saunders skipping them.

Dacey won his second mixed title in November 2009 at the 2010 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship. This qualified him and his wife, Heather to represent Canada at the 2010 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship. However, they had to pull out after being delayed by the air travel disruption after the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull eruption.

==Personal life==
He was the husband of 2004 Nova Scotia women&#x27;s curling champion Heather Smith; they separated in 2013.

<doc id="928953" wikidata="Q4762258" url="?curid=928953" title="Angel Records">
<text>Angel Records was a record label founded by EMI in 1953. It specialised in classical music, but included an occasional operetta or Broadway score. and one Peter Sellers comedy disc. The famous Recording Angel trademark was used by the Gramophone Company, EMI and its affiliated companies from 1898. The label has been inactive since 2006, when it dissolved and reassigned its active artists and catalogue while retaining its recent catalogue to sister labels EMI Classics, Virgin Classics and Manhattan Records and its musical theatre artists and catalogue to another sister label, Capitol Records.

==Recording angel==
A recording angel is a traditional figure that watches over people, marking their actions on a tablet for future judgment. Artist Theodore Birnbaum devised a modified version of this image, depicting a cherub marking grooves into a phonograph disc with a quill. Beginning in 1898, the Gramophone Company in the United Kingdom used this angel as a trademark on its record labels and players, as did affiliated companies worldwide.

From 1909, Gramophone and related companies began replacing the angel with the famous &quot;His Master&#x27;s Voice&quot; trademark depicting Nipper the dog listening to a gramophone. The recording angel was retained in areas where the depiction of a dog was deemed offensive, and in North and South America where the His Master&#x27;s Voice trademark was controlled by RCA Victor.

==Angel Records==

In 1953 Gramophone successor EMI lost its U.S. distribution arrangement with Columbia Records, which had elected to make Philips Records distributor of U.S. Columbia recordings outside North America. In response, EMI established Angel Records in New York City under the direction of record producers Dorle Soria (December 14, 1900 – July 7, 2002) and her husband Dario Soria (May 21, 1912 – March 28, 1980). The couple concentrated on distributing EMI classical recordings in the U.S. market. They departed the label in 1957, having already accumulated a catalog of about 500 titles, when EMI merged Angel into its recently acquired Capitol Records subsidiary and moved from imported discs to U.S. production. However, Angel recordings such as Sir Thomas Beecham&#x27;s 1957 performance of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, made in England in stereo with the Royal Philharmonic, were still imported to the U.S.

In the 1960s, EMI introduced the budget Seraphim Records label, primarily in the United States, to compete with the low-priced RCA Victrola and Columbia Odyssey labels, which featured historic recordings issued by all three companies. In 1967, as RCA Victrola celebrated the centenary of Arturo Toscanini with the reissue of numerous recordings of the Maestro and the NBC Symphony Orchestra, Seraphim reissued some of Toscanini&#x27;s EMI British recordings with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, made in London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Hall from 1937 to 1939; these recordings had formerly been distributed in the U.S. by RCA Victor. Several albums featured Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, including Beecham&#x27;s 1959 stereo recordings, which were switched from the Angel label to Seraphim. Some historic EMI recordings have appeared in the U.S. on the Seraphim label on CD in recent years.

Since 1990, international use of the Angel mark has been replaced by the EMI Classics label while it was retained in the U.S.

In 1992, Angel expanded into the musical theatre genre by adding the Angel Broadway imprint.

Angel achieved its first top 10 album on the Billboard 200 chart in 1994 with &quot;Chant&quot;, an album of Gregorian chants by the Benedictine Monks of Santo Domingo de Silos.

In 2001, Angel released newly remastered and expanded editions of the soundtracks of three Rodgers and Hammerstein films – &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;, &quot;Carousel&quot; and &quot;The King and I&quot;. The LP versions and original CD versions of these soundtracks had previously been released by Capitol Records.

In the mid-2000s the Angel label was used by Parlophone Records in the UK for a number of releases by American acts such as Diana Ross&#x27; &quot;I Love You&quot; album and rapper Mims&#x27; single &quot;This Is Why I&#x27;m Hot&quot;

The label has been dormant since 2006 when it was placed under the Blue Note Label Group, which dissolving and reassigning Angel Records&#x27; active artists and catalogue while retaining its recent catalogue to its sister labels EMI Classics, Virgin Classics and Manhattan Records which their also under the Blue Note Label Group and musical theatre artists and catalogue to its other sister label Capitol Records. EMI Classics and Virgin Classics were sold and absorbed into Warner Classics and Erato Records in 2013.

<text>Seraphim Records is the sister label of Angel Records.

==History==
During the 1960s through the 1980s, it was Angel&#x27;s low-price label; recordings that had originally been released on the Angel label were re-released at a bargain price on the Seraphim label. The very first release was of stereophonic recordings by Sir Thomas Beecham and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, including several pieces previously unreleased.

The label has specialized in historic recordings, including some originally released on 78-rpm discs. In 1967, Seraphim issued some of the 1937–39 recordings by Arturo Toscanini and the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Some opera recordings were released, including Pietro Mascagni&#x27;s historic 1940 recording of his opera &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot;, complete with the original spoken introduction (in Italian) by the composer.

EMI used the label for CDs consisting of re-released music recorded during the LP era, primarily in stereo. Some early digital recordings were also reissued on the label.

EMI&#x27;s classical-music operations were sold to Warner Music Group in 2013 after its dismantling by Universal Music. The status of which company owns Seraphim is now unknown.

In March 2019, she was chosen as the Fashion Icon honoree at the Daily Front Row Awards.

In 2021, Lima was chosen by &quot;HOLA! USA&quot; as one of the &quot;Changemakers&quot; of their &quot;Latina Powerhouse Top 100&quot; list.

<text>EMI Classics was a record label founded by Thorn EMI in 1990 to reduce the need to create country-specific packaging and catalogues for internationally distributed classical music releases. After Thorn EMI demerged in 1996, its recorded music division became the EMI Music Group. Following the European Commission&#x27;s approval of the takeover of EMI Music Group by Universal Music Group in September 2012, EMI Classics was listed for divestment. The label was sold to Warner Music Group, which absorbed EMI Classics into Warner Classics in 2013.

Classical recordings were formerly simultaneously released under combinations of Angel, Seraphim, Odeon, Columbia, His Master&#x27;s Voice, and other labels, in part because competitors own these names in various countries. These were moved under the EMI Classics umbrella to avoid the trademark problems. Prior to this, compact discs distributed globally bore the Angel Records recording angel logo that EMI owned globally. Releases created for distribution in specific countries continued to be distributed under the historical names, with the exception of Columbia, since EMI had sold the Columbia name to Sony Music Entertainment. The red logo harkens back to the Red Seal releases, introduced by EMI predecessor the Gramophone Company in 1902: His Master&#x27;s Voice classical releases were issued with red labels. EMI Classics was also responsible for managing Pye Records&#x27; classical recordings acquired by Thorn EMI in 1990.

EMI Classics also included the Virgin Classics label, both of them were formerly managed under The Blue Note Label Group in the U.S. until 2013.

With the sale of EMI Music Group to Universal Music Group in 2012, European regulators forced Universal Music Group to divest itself of EMI Classics, which was operated with other European EMI assets to be divested as the Parlophone Label Group. In February 2013, Universal Music Group sold the Parlophone Label Group, including EMI Classics and Virgin Classics, to Warner Music Group. The European Union approved the deal on May, and Warner Music Group took control of the label on 1 July. It was then announced that the EMI Classics artist roster and catalogue would be absorbed into the Warner Classics label and Virgin Classics would be absorbed into Erato Records.

<text>Kurt Arthur Benno Student (12 May 1890 – 1 July 1978) was a German general in the Luftwaffe during World War II. An early pioneer of airborne forces, Student was in overall command of developing a paratrooper force to be known as the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;, and as the most senior member of the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot;, commanded it throughout the war. Student led the first major airborne attack in history, the Battle for The Hague, in May 1940. He also commanded the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; in its last major airborne operation, the invasion of Crete in May 1941. The operation was a success despite German losses, and led the Allies to hasten the training and development of their own airborne units.

In 1947, Student was tried and convicted of war crimes for the mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war by his men in Crete. Student was also responsible for a wave of reprisal massacres committed against Cretan civilians in 1941 but avoided harsh punishment.

==Early life and career==
Student entered the Prussian Army as a Fähnrich in 1910 and was commissioned a lieutenant in March 1911. He qualified as a pilot in 1913 and served during World War I.

===World War I===
In July 1916, Student became a charter member of the Fokker Scourge, when he scored his first confirmed victory, forcing Nieuport 11 no. 1324 to land behind German lines. He then served in aerial units of the Third Army on the Western Front, including &quot;Jagdstaffel 9&quot; (&quot;Jasta 9&quot;), which he commanded from 5 October 1916 to 2 May 1917, when he was wounded. He achieved flying ace status and scored six air-to-air victories over French aircraft between 1916 and 1917, with two coming after his wound. He left &quot;Jasta 9&quot; on 14 March 1918.

===Interwar period===
In the immediate postwar years, Student was assigned to military research and development. He became involved in military gliders since gliding was not forbidden by the Treaty of Versailles. He also attended the Red Army Air Force&#x27;s maneuvers in Lipetsk fighter-pilot school and first came in contact with the idea of airborne operations. After Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was secretly re-established. Student transferred from the Army to the Air Force and was appointed by Hermann Göring to be the head of its training schools. In July 1938, he was named commander of airborne and air-landing troops and, in September, commanding general of the 7th Air Division, Germany&#x27;s first paratroop division.

==World War II==
After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, which marked the beginning of the Second World War in Europe, the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; were first deployed during the invasions of Norway and Denmark in Operation Weserübung in April 1940. In this operation the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; were deployed on several locations. In Denmark, a small unit dropped on Masnedø island to seize the Storstrøm Bridge linking Falster and Zealand. A paratroop detachment also dropped at Aalborg Airfield, which was crucial for Luftwaffe operations over Norway. In Norway, a company of paratroopers dropped at Oslo&#x27;s undefended airstrip. Over the course of the morning and early afternoon of April 9, 1940, the Germans flew in sufficient reinforcements to seize the capital, but by that time the Norwegian government had fled.
The paratroopers&#x27; first major action (and the first large-scale airborne operation in history) was the battle for The Hague on 10 May 1940. German paratroopers landed at three airfields near The Hague. From one of these airfields, they were driven out after the first wave of reinforcements, brought in by Ju 52s, was annihilated by anti-aircraft fire and fierce resistance by some remaining Dutch defenders. The other two airfields were recaptured as well. Simultaneously, small packets of paratroopers seized the crucial bridges that led directly across the Netherlands and into the heart of the country. They opened the way for the 9th Panzer Division. Within a day, the Dutch position became indefensible. Nevertheless, Dutch forces inflicted high losses on German transportation aircraft. Moreover, 1200 German élite troops from the , taken prisoner around The Hague, were shipped to England just before the capitulation of the Dutch armed forces.

During airborne operations in the Battle of Rotterdam of 10 to 14 May 1940, Student was almost taken prisoner, and was shot in the head – by what was later determined to be a stray German round. His capture was halted by the &quot;Rotterdam Blitz&quot; on 14 May and by the subsequent capitulation of the Netherlands.

On 10 May 1940, the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; performed a successful raid on the largest fort in the world at the time, Eben-Emael, manned by 1,200 Belgian troops. The raid was accomplished by an assault group which consisted of only 85 soldiers. It took the &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; only hours to take control of the fort. The fall of Eben-Emael opened up Belgium for invasion by Army Group B. For his role in the raid, Student was decorated with the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross.

In January 1941, Student was named commanding general of the , the newly formed command for the expanding German airborne forces. He was ordered to prepare a plan to use airborne forces for the capture of Gibraltar. In May 1941, Student directed Operation Mercury (&quot;Unternehmen Merkur&quot;), the airborne invasion of Crete, which was defended by British, Greek and Commonwealth forces. Crete was taken, in what became the greatest victory of the , but the high casualties caused Hitler to forbid future major airborne operations.

During the invasion of Crete, the German forces encountered unexpected mass resistance from the civilian population and several German parachutists were killed by civilians armed only with knives and clubs. The German troops were initially surprised and later outraged. German military intelligence, the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, had predicted that the Cretan population would welcome the Germans as liberators, due to Cretans&#x27; strong republican and anti-monarchist feelings and that they would want to receive the &quot;... favourable terms which had been arranged on the mainland ...&quot;. Student was made the temporary commander of Crete immediately after the island&#x27;s surrender on 31 May 1941. On Hermann Göring&#x27;s orders, Student launched a wave of brutal reprisals against the local population with the massacre of Kondomari, the Alikianos executions, and the razing of Kandanos being well-known examples.

In 1943, Student ordered Major Harald Mors to plan Operation Oak (&quot;Unternehmen Eiche&quot;), the successful raid conducted by a special &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; unit to free Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. They landed with gliders and STOL aircraft on a hilltop. Student received the Oak Leaves to the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for his role in this operation.

Student was transferred to Italy and later to France, where he was involved in the battles of Normandy in 1944. He was put in charge of the First Paratroop Army and took part in countering the Allied Operation Market Garden, near Arnhem. After a brief time at the Eastern Front in Mecklenburg in 1945, he was captured by British forces in Schleswig-Holstein in April of that same year before he could take command of Army Group Vistula.

==War crimes conviction==

In May 1947, Student was put on trial on eight charges of mistreatment and murder of prisoners of war by his men in Crete, and crimes against the civilian population of Crete, like those at Kondomari, Alikianos and Kandanos. He was found guilty of three charges relating to prisoners of war, but acquitted of crimes against civilians owing to the testimony of Brigadier Lindsay Inglis, commander of the 4th New Zealand Brigade. Student was sentenced to five years of imprisonment but was given an early discharge in 1948 for medical reasons. He died in 1978, the last surviving &quot;Luftwaffe Generaloberst&quot;.

<text>Adriana (&quot;Adrie&quot;) Visser (born 19 October 1983 in Hoorn) is a former Dutch track and road racer who lives in Wieringerwerf.

Visser started her professional career in 2001, when she finished second at the Dutch road race championship. She came fifth in the time trial. In track cycling she won her first national titles, becoming Dutch champion in the 500m time trial and sprint. She also won a silver medal in the points race. At the world championships in Trexlertown, Pennsylvania, USA, she was seventh in the 500m time trial and eighth in the sprint and individual pursuit.

She won a bronze medal at the 2003 World Track Championships in Stuttgart. In the same year she won the Dutch points, scratch and individual pursuit championships for the first time. In May 2004 she won her first World Cup meeting in Sydney, where she won the scratch before finishing 10th at the world championships in Melbourne a week later. Her first achievement in road cycling was the blue jersey for sprints in the Eumakumeen Bira in June 2004. A month later she won her first road race in Alblasserdam.

Back on the track that year she won another three national titles (points, individual pursuit and scratch). She also took part in the 2004 Summer Olympics participating in the points race and finishing 11th.

At the world championships in Manchester, England, in 2005, she finished fourth in the scratch event. She was fifth in the points race and seventh in the pursuit. In June on the road she won the Omloop Middag-Humsterland, Profronde van Stiphout and a race in Dalen. These brought her into the national team for the world road championship for the first time, finishing 84th in Madrid. She won her second World Cup track event in Manchester where she won the scratch again before defending her three national Dutch titles.

2006 started well when in January she won Egmond-Pier-Egmond. In March she won the road race in Oud Vossemeer. She finished in the top 10 in both the road race and the time trial championship (7th and 9th). Between 15 July and 1 August she won four road races; (Ochten), Barendrecht, Alblasserdam and Surhuisterveen). Dutch national coach Egon van Kessel selected her for the World championship again following these results.

On 31 March 2007, Visser took the bronze medal in the scratch race at the UCI Track World Championships in Palma de Mallorca. Two weeks later, she won her first big UCI Women&#x27;s Road World Cup race, the Ronde van Drenthe (Netherlands).
