<text>Atassi () () is the name of a prominent family in Homs, Syria, of a noble lineage dating back to the 15th century AD. In modern times, members of the family led the national movement against the French mandate. The power and prestige of the family reached an apex at the formation of the modern Republic of Syria in 1936, when its second head of state, Hashim al-Atassi was elected president. Two out of the seven members of the constitutional assembly who drafted the first constitution of Syria in 1919 were prominent Atassis: Wasfi al-Atassi and Hashim al-Atassi. Two more scions, Lu&#x27;ay al-Atassi and Nureddin al-Atassi, were in turn installed as heads of state in the 1960s. Family members included magistrates, governors, ambassadors, heads of political parties, military officers and other public officials throughout Ottoman and modern times.

==Background==

Many leading family members assumed prominent religious and political positions in Ottoman, French, and Independent Syria.

The oldest mention of the family was in a religious manuscript dated in 1450, copied in service to one the family ancestors, Sheikh Ibrahim bin Ahmad Al-Atassi, who was named Imam of Prince Toghan bin Seqlesiz, Prince of the Turkman. The family appeared in Hims around the end of the 15th century. Its ancestor, Ali Bin Khalil Atassi, was buried in 1508 in a tomb in a mosque which later became known as the Atassi Mosque. The tomb exists until today.

The name al-Atassi evolved from the word &quot;&quot; (from &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;the sneezer&quot; in Arabic) which later changed to &quot; then to &quot; or Atassi.

==Atassi muftis of Homs and Tripoli==
The office of Mufti of the town of Homs, the highest religious jurisdiction in the city, was hereditary in the Atassi family for over four centuries. At least eighteen Atassi scholars held this position. In addition, two Atassis are known to have been Muftis of the city of Tripoli as well. The Sibaie House of Homs was another scholarly family who were often in competition with the Atassi House for the seat of the mufti, and the Sibaie were able to secure it at least four times in the town history.

The following are members of the family who attained the position of mufti:

(Dates represent period served in that position) 

*Al-Shihab Ahmad Sham al-Deen ibn Khalil al-Atassi, The first. 1533-1596.
*Mahmood ibn Ahmad al-Atassi. Held position starting in 1596.
*Ahmad ibn Mahmood al-Atassi, the second. Held position until death in 1653.
*Hasan ibn Mahmood al-Atassi. Held position starting in 1653.
*Mohammad ibn Ahmad al-Atassi, the first. Held position until death in 1698.
*Ali ibn Hasan al-Atassi. Held position starting in 1703.
*Abdul-Wahhab ibn Ali al-Atassi. mid-18th century, period not exactly known.
*Burhan Al-Deen Ibraheem ibn Ali al-Atassi. Late 18th century, period in Homs not known, Mufti of Homs, later of Tripoli.
*Yaseen ibn Ibraheem al-Atassi, Mufti of Tripoli.
*Abdul-Sattar ibn Ibraheem al-Atassi. 1805-1829.

*Mohammad Tayyeb ibn Abdul-Fattah al-Atassi. 1966-1984.
* Zuhair bin Abdul-Rahman Mumtaz Al-Atassi. 2017-current
Other members served as religious scholars in other capacities such as judges, chief clerks, and imams. One mufti, Sayed Ibraheem Efendi al-Atassi, also served as Mufti of Tripoli in the late 18th century. Taher al-Atassi served as the supreme judge of Basra in Iraq, and Nablus and Jerusalem in Palestine in the late Ottoman period.

Although members of the Atassi family were naturally involved in the politics of the city of Homs by virtue of holding the mufti position and by belonging to the wealthy class and being Ashraf, it was not until the late 19th century that they started holding non-religious governmental offices. Two scholars who held the position of mufti also held political offices: Khaled al-Atassi (1837–1908), and his son, Taher al-Atassi (1860–1940). In 1876, Sayed Khaled Efendi Al-Atassi was elected to the first parliament of the Ottoman Empire as the deputy from Homs and Hama. In 1922, Sayed Taher Efendi was elected to membership of the Council of the Syrian Union as the representative of Homs in the state of Damascus. Other Atassis have since held legislative positions.

The family achieved further influence through education with a tradition of sending the young men of the family to be educated at the Imperial capital of Istanbul during the Ottoman administration, and then to the Sorbonne and other European centers of learning during the French Mandate.

<doc id="933994" wikidata="Q5415387" url="?curid=933994" title="Evan Forde">
<text>Evan B. Forde is an American oceanographer at the Atlantic Oceanographic &amp; Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) with the National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). He was the first African-American scientist to perform research in a submersible. Forde is widely considered an expert on the formation of submarine canyons and his recent research uses satellite sensors to analyze atmospheric conditions related to hurricane formation.

== Education ==
Forde was born in Miami, Florida, and received his primary education in the Miami-Dade County public schools. He received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in Geology with an oceanography specialty in 1974 followed by his Master of Arts (M.A.) degree in marine geology and geophysics from Columbia University. Forde became a researcher in the Marine Geology and Geophysics laboratory at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x27;s (NOAA) Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) while an undergraduate at Columbia during the summer of 1973. Forde has stated that French oceanographer Jacques Cousteau was a large inspiration in his love of oceanography.

== Research ==
After earning his M.A., Forde worked at NOAA AOML in Miami mapping the Atlantic sea floor. In 1979, Forde became the first African-American oceanographer to conduct a research mission aboard a submersible craft when he dove in the Nekton Gamma. He subsequently completed submersible dive expeditions in Alvin in 1980 and the Johnson Sea Link in 1981. One of his most significant discoveries was the submarine sediment slide off the coast of New Jersey, which caused New Jersey offshore drilling to stop in 1980.

Soon after, Forde begun to research hydrothermal plumes and satellite-tracking of hurricanes to improve hurricane forecasting and intensity prediction models. This is still a large part of his current research, and it has expanded to include threat mitigation and training exercises for hurricane response. He has additionally conducted research on the effects that dust storms from Africa have on the formation of Atlantic basin hurricanes.

Utilizing his background in classical Marine Geology techniques, Forde became a recognized authority on the formation, evolution, and sedimentary processes of east coast U.S. submarine canyons. Additional scientific research efforts by Forde have included studies of gravity-induced mass sediment movements on continental slopes, 3-dimensional mapping of hydrothermal plumes, and the study of ocean-atmosphere exchange of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.

== Leadership and outreach ==

Forde has also worked extensively in the area of science education. He authored science experiments in multiple children&#x27;s magazines, including &quot;Science Corner&quot; in Ebony Jr!, with custom-made experiments for several years, and created a Severe Weather Poster for NOAA that was distributed nationally to 50,000 teachers by the National Science Teachers Association. He has spoken to more than 40,000 school children through presentations about his oceanographic and academic careers. Forde created and taught a graduate level tropical meteorology course for the University of Miami&#x27;s INSTAR program for seven years, and also created and teaches an oceanography course for middle school students called Oceanographic Curriculum Empowering Achievement in Natural Sciences (OCEANS). Forde has been the subject of three museum exhibits, and has been featured in numerous periodical articles, text books and many other publications on prominent African American scientists.

In addition to his scientific career, Evan Forde has served as a PTA President, a church trustee, Scoutmaster, youth basketball coach, church webmaster, Sunday School and youth ministry teacher, neighborhood Crime Watch chairman and in numerous other roles that have fostered youth and improved his community. He has initiated programs to combat community food scarcity and actively supports NOAA&#x27;s Equal Opportunity Employment (EEO) initiatives.

== Awards and recognitions ==

In 2001, Forde was named NOAA Research Employee of the Year. In 2008, he was recognized as South Florida&#x27;s Federal Employee of the Year in the Service to the Community Category, along with a Congressional Commendation. &quot;Evan B. Forde&quot; days were celebrated in the City of North Miami on February 10, 2009, and Miami-Dade County on April 21, 2009. In 2011, he also received the NOAA Administrator&#x27;s (Under Secretary of Commerce) Award for outstanding communication of NOAA science. Additionally, Forde has been the recipient of a host of career and community awards that include being named NOAA&#x27;s Environmental Research Laboratories EEO Outstanding Employee.

<text>Curtis is a nationally syndicated comic strip written and illustrated by Ray Billingsley, with a predominantly African American cast. The comic strip started up on October 3, 1988, and is syndicated by King Features.

The comic strip portrays the daily life of a middle-class family living in a large American city, especially that of Curtis, the eponymous main character. It frequently chronicles aspects of African American culture and history.

&quot;Curtis&quot; has been compared to Li&#x27;l Abner, which Billingsley cites as his favorite comic strip, in style.

== Themes ==
A recurring theme is Curtis&#x27; efforts to convince his father to try give up smoking, a personal issue for Billingsley, who is a prominent advocate for public health and the dangers of smoking. For his efforts in educating young people about smoking, Billingsley has earned multiple awards from the American Lung Association.

Though a fundamentally humorous comic, &quot;Curtis&quot; frequently addresses serious themes. Examples include bullying, drug addiction and gentrification. A storyline in 2020 involved the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the holiday season, Billingsley sometimes deviates from his usual characters to present special two-to-three week stories celebrating the Festival of Kwanzaa. Once an annual tradition in the strip, these specials became irregular in the mid-2010s, with Ray Billingsley citing declining reader interest in them.

<text>Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox (21 September 1516 – 4 September 1571) was a leader of the Catholic nobility in Scotland. He was the paternal grandfather of King James VI of Scotland. He owned Temple Newsam in Yorkshire, England.

== Origins ==
He was the son of John Stewart, 3rd Earl of Lennox (d.1526) by his wife Lady Elizabeth Stewart, a daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Atholl.

== Conflict with Regent Arran (1543–1547) ==
Matthew Stewart succeeded as Earl of Lennox on the death of his father in 1526. His mother sent him and his younger brother John Stewart to France into the care of their great uncle Robert Stewart, 5th Lord of Aubigny, who enrolled them in the Garde Écossaise.

When King James V of Scotland died in 1542, Cardinal Beaton urged Lennox to return to Scotland to rival James Hamilton, 2nd Earl of Arran. Lennox arrived in March with two ships at his stronghold of Dumbarton Castle just days after Parliament had declared Arran as Regent and heir to the throne after the infant Mary Queen of Scots. Both Arran and Lennox had claims to the throne as descendants of Mary Stewart, a daughter of King James II of Scotland, but Arran had the better claim as a grandson through a male line, while Lennox was a great-grandson through a female line. Lennox however claimed that Arran was illegitimate because his father had failed to divorce his first wife before marrying Arran&#x27;s mother.

=== Coronation at Stirling ===
Arran made the Treaty of Greenwich with England on 1 July 1543, which sought to betroth Mary to Prince Edward Tudor, the son and heir of King Henry VIII of England. Regent Arran began to fortify Linlithgow Palace, where Mary was held with her mother, Mary of Guise, the dowager Queen of Scotland. Lennox allied himself with the pro-French Cardinal Beaton, and their forces camped outside the palace, but lacked artillery for an assault. The Cardinal&#x27;s party signed a &quot;Secret Bond&quot; to resist the English marriage plan. Their representatives parleyed with Arran&#x27;s men at Kirkliston, near Edinburgh, and agreed that Arran would rule with the advice of a council, and Mary would be moved to Stirling Castle. Lennox escorted Mary to Stirling on 26 July 1543.

Mary was crowned at Stirling on 9 September 1543. Lennox held the sceptre. Although Lennox had come to Scotland lured by the prospect of marriage to the widow Mary of Guise, by September he had been offered the chance to marry Lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of the Dowager Queen Margaret Tudor (wife of King James IV of Scotland and sister of King Henry VIII), and half-sister of the deceased King James V. After Lennox had seized the French money and artillery that was sent to Mary of Guise, she offered the hand of her daughter Queen Mary in marriage. 

=== The Rough Wooing ===
When the Parliament of Scotland rejected the Greenwich treaty, Lennox changed sides and supported King Henry VIII&#x27;s military efforts to secure a marriage between Queen Mary and his son Prince Edward, in the war now known as the Rough Wooing. In the summer of 1544, Lennox plundered the Isle of Arran and made himself master of the Isle of Bute and Rothesay Castle, with the support of eighteen ships and 800 men supplied by King Henry VIII. At the Battle of Glasgow Muir, his army managed to drive the first rank of Arran&#x27;s more numerous forces back into the second rank and captured their cannon. However, the battle ended more favourably for the Regent Arran. There were about 300 slain on both sides, and Lennox himself withdrew to Dumbarton Castle. 

After a consultation with his English officers, Lennox attacked Dunoon Castle and burnt the nearby village and church. He subsequently laid waste to a large part of Kintyre, but as he had not succeeded in regaining possession of Dumbarton Castle, he retreated to his ships and sailed for England on about 28 May 1544. He stayed for a time at Wressle Castle. He was granted a letter of denization by Henry VIII in July 1544. Donald Dubh formed an alliance of Highland Isles landowners in support of Lennox, on 5 August 1545 swearing an oath of allegiance to Henry VIII and acknowledging the Lennox as the true regent of Scotland (rather than Regent Arran or Mary of Guise). Despite English support, Dubh&#x27;s Rebellion was ineffective, due to disorganization and poor logistics.

Lennox joined the English invasion force in September 1547. When the main English army approached Edinburgh before the Battle of Pinkie, far to the west, a diversionary invasion of 5,000 men was led jointly by Thomas Wharton and Lennox. They took Castlemilk and burnt Annan, after a bitter struggle to capture its fortified church.

== Later life ==
For a time Lennox and his family resided at Whorlton Castle in North Yorkshire, which had been granted, with the estate, to him by King Henry VIII. Later, at some point in the late 16th century, a house was built there by the Lennox family adjoining the northwest end of the castle&#x27;s gatehouse.

In August 1548 Lennox gave four promises to Mary of Guise in order for her assent to her daughter Queen Mary&#x27;s marriage to King Francis II of France. These were as follows: that he and his friends and retainers would preserve the Catholic faith in Scotland; that they would guard the Auld Alliance; that Guise would remain guardian of the Queen and that he would punish all who supported the King of England.

Lennox returned to Scotland upon the urging of Queen Elizabeth I of England, during the marriage negotiations of Queen Mary of Scots in October 1564. He was given lodgings in Holyrood Palace, and the queen&#x27;s tapestry worker Pierre Martin refurbished a crimson velvet bed for him. Lennox gave Mary a &quot;marvellous fair and rich&quot; jewell, a clock, and a looking glass set with precious stones, and diamond rings to several courtiers and presents to the queen&#x27;s four Maries. Lennox quickly took up his position as the most powerful lord in the Glasgow area and was later instrumental in the marriage of his elder son, Lord Darnley, to Queen Mary. Whether Queen Elizabeth I had intended this (in order to eliminate the threat of a continental marriage), as is sometimes conjectured, remains doubtful. The Queen of England reacted with disapproval and had Lennox&#x27;s wife Margaret confined in the Tower of London. By August 1565 William Cecil had heard that the insolence of his son Lord Darnley had driven Lennox from the Scottish court.

After his elder son Lord Darnley was murdered early in 1567 Lennox was the most ardent pursuant of justice against the lords who had conspired in the murder. He also became the main witness against Queen Mary though her possible involvement in the murder thought to have been carried out by her later husband, Lord Bothwell, is controversial.

== Death ==
In 1570 Lennox became regent for his grandson King James VI of Scotland, but Queen Mary&#x27;s party declared war against him. He was shot dead next year in a skirmish when the Queen&#x27;s party attacked Stirling. The raid on Stirling on 4 September 1571 was led by the George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly, Claude Hamilton, and the lairds of Buccleuch and Ferniehurst. Early reports said he was killed by his own party. William Kirkcaldy of Grange said the shot was fired by the Queen&#x27;s party, and another account names David Bochinant as the assassin.

Lennox is thought to have been buried within the Chapel Royal at Stirling Castle, which was unusual. The site of the burial has not been conclusively determined. A burial discovered by archaeologists in an old chapel site at the Castle, the Governor&#x27;s Kitchen, dated by radiocarbon methods to the correct period, could have been Lennox&#x27;s.

== Marriage and issue ==
In 1544 he married Lady Margaret Douglas, daughter of Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, by his wife the Dowager Queen Margaret Tudor, who had a claim to the English throne. By Margaret he had issue: 
* Henry Stuart (1544–1544) who died shortly after birth;
* Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley (1546–1567), born at Temple Newsam, who married Mary, Queen of Scots, daughter of King James V; his son was King James VI of Scotland and I of England;
* Philip Stuart (1556);
* Charles Stuart, 5th Earl of Lennox (1557–1576), who in 1574 married Elizabeth Cavendish, a daughter of Sir William Cavendish by his wife Elizabeth Hardwick. His daughter was Lady Arbella Stuart.

<text>A host of legendary creatures, animals, and mythic humanoids occur in ancient Greek mythology. Anything related to mythology is mythological. A mythological creature (also mythical or fictional entity) is a type of fictional entity, typically a hybrid, that has not been proven and that is described in folklore (including myths and legends), but may be featured in historical accounts before modernity. Something mythological can also be described as mythic, mythical, or mythologic.

<text>Prior to the 1917 federal election in Canada, the Liberal Party of Canada split into two factions. To differentiate the groups, historians tend to use two retrospective names:

* The Laurier Liberals, who opposed conscription of soldiers to support Canada&#x27;s involvement in World War I and who were led by former Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier; and
* The [[Liberal-Unionist|Liberal Unionists]] who joined Sir Robert Borden&#x27;s Unionist government.

Seeking broader support for the imposition of conscription in 1917, Borden invited the Liberals into a wartime coalition government with the Conservatives. Sir Wilfrid Laurier, an opponent of conscription who feared for the nation if an opposition was not represented in Parliament, refused the request.

Despite Laurier&#x27;s refusal, the request split the Liberal Party largely along linguistic lines. Many provincial Liberal parties in English-speaking Canada and a number of Liberal Members of Parliament supported conscription and decided to support Borden&#x27;s &quot;Unionist&quot; government.

Quebec Liberals, along with a minority of English candidates (such as William Lyon Mackenzie King) refused to join Borden and continued in the party under Laurier&#x27;s leadership. The candidates ran as Liberals, and on military ballots, were labelled as &quot;Opposition.&quot;

Of the 235 seats in the House of Commons of Canada, only 82 returned Laurier Liberals in the election held December 17, 1917:
* 62 were elected in Quebec ridings,
* 1 from Alberta, 
* 1 was from a Manitoba riding with a large francophone population, 
* 4 were from New Brunswick, 
* 4 were from Nova Scotia, 
* 2 were from Prince Edward Island, and 
* 8 were from Ontario.

With only 20 seats outside Quebec, the Liberal Party was reduced to a largely French-Canadian parliamentary rump in 1917.

The Conservatives attempted to make their alliance with Liberal Unionists permanent through the formation of the National Liberal and Conservative Party. However, under a new leader, William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Liberals were able to recover enough of their support in English Canada to form a minority government following the 1921 federal election.

* Shashikala holds the record of most consecutive nominations with 6 between 1963 and 1967, being nominated twice in 1967, winning twice consecutively in 1963 and 1964.
* Nine actresses share the record for the most nominations in a single year. In chronological order, they are: Shubha Khote (1962), Shashikala (1967), Nutan (1974), Bindu (1975), Smita Patil (1984), Sushmita Sen (2000), Rani Mukerji (2005), Konkona Sen Sharma (2008) and Seema Bhargava Pahwa (2018). Among these, Sushmita Sen, Rani Mukerji and Konkona Sen Sharma won the awards in their respective years. The other six thus hold the record of not winning despite having multiple nominations, in a particular year.
* Bindu holds the record of maximum nominations without ever winning, with 7, followed by Waheeda Rehman and Tanvi Azmi with 5 nominations, and Reema Lagoo and Ratna Pathak Shah with 4 nominations each.
* Farrukh Jaffar, in 2021, became the eldest winner at age 88, winning for &quot;Gulabo Sitabo&quot; (2020), whilst Ayesha Kapur, in 2006, became the youngest winner and youngest nominee, at age 11, winning for &quot;Black&quot; (2005). Kamini Kaushal, in 2020, became the eldest nominee at age 93 for her role in &quot;Kabir Singh&quot; (2019).
* Karisma Kapoor and Kareena Kapoor are the only siblings who have both won the award.
* There was no repeat winner in the 1950s, on the contrary in the &#x27;60s three actresses had two wins, namely, Nirupa Roy, Shashikala and Simi Garewal. Again, &#x27;70s had no repeat wins, but Supriya Pathak achieved two consecutive wins in the &#x27;80s. Farida Jalal followed suit with two wins in the &#x27;90s. Jaya Bachchan took over in the 2000s with three wins. There were no repeat winners in the 2010s. Until now, no one is leading in the 2020s. * Chandramukhi is the only charector for the movie Devdas Vyjayanthimala and Madhuri Dixit won the award for best supporting actress same roll Chandramukhi 
* Vyjayanthimala was the first actress to win both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. She was also the first person to refuse a Filmfare Award for her role in &quot;Devdas&quot; (1955), which then followed by Reena Roy for her role in &quot;Apnapan&quot; (1977). Both refused it citing that their roles were leading and not supporting.
* Only once have siblings been nominated for the award during the same year: Ratna Pathak and Supriya Pathak in 2011.
* 14 actresses who have won both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards include Vyjayanthimala, Raakhee, Padmini Kolhapure, Nutan, Dimple Kapadia, Rekha, Karisma Kapoor, Jaya Bachchan, Madhuri Dixit, Rani Mukerji, Kareena Kapoor, Kangana Ranaut, Priyanka Chopra and Shabana Azmi. Mukerji is the first and only actress to win both these awards in the same year (2005).
* Two actresses were nominated for both Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress awards for the same performance: Nutan for &quot;Saudagar&quot; (1974) and for &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1979) and Raakhee for &quot;Doosra Aadmi&quot; (1978); Nutan won Best Actress award for &quot;Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki&quot; (1979).
* Rani Mukerji is the overall most nominated performer in the female acting categories, with 21 nominations overall. Mukerji has 11 for Best Actress and 7 for Best Supporting Actress. and 3 nominations for Best Actress Critics.
* Kareena Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra are the only two actresses to win Filmfare Awards in five different categories. Both actresses have won Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress and Best Female Debut awards once each. Kapoor won twice, while Chopra won once in the Best Actress (Critics) category. Kapoor and Chopra also won one Special Award, one Best Villain Award, respectively. Kapoor and Chopra, thus have 6 and 5 Filmfare Awards respectively.

<doc id="934064" wikidata="Q1872538" url="?curid=934064" title="Low-κ dielectric">
<text>In semiconductor manufacturing, a low-κ is a material with a small relative dielectric constant (κ, kappa) relative to silicon dioxide. Low-κ dielectric material implementation is one of several strategies used to allow continued scaling of microelectronic devices, colloquially referred to as extending Moore&#x27;s law. In digital circuits, insulating dielectrics separate the conducting parts (wire interconnects and transistors) from one another. As components have scaled and transistors have gotten closer together, the insulating dielectrics have thinned to the point where charge build up and crosstalk adversely affect the performance of the device. Replacing the silicon dioxide with a low-κ dielectric of the same thickness reduces parasitic capacitance, enabling faster switching speeds (in case of synchronous circuits) and lower heat dissipation. In conversation such materials may be referred to as &quot;low-k&quot; (spoken &quot;low-kay&quot;) rather than &quot;low-κ&quot; (low-kappa).

==Low-κ materials==
In integrated circuits, and CMOS devices, silicon dioxide can readily be formed on surfaces of Si through thermal oxidation, and can further be deposited on the surfaces of conductors using chemical vapor deposition or various other thin film fabrication methods. Due to the wide range of methods that can be used to cheaply form silicon dioxide layers, this material is used conventionally as the baseline to which other low permittivity dielectrics are compared. The relative dielectric constant of SiO2, the insulating material still used in silicon chips, is 3.9. This number is the ratio of the permittivity of SiO2 divided by permittivity of vacuum, εSiO2/ε0, where ε0 = 8.854×10−6 pF/μm. There are many materials with lower relative dielectric constants but few of them can be suitably integrated into a manufacturing process. Development efforts have focused primarily on the following classes of materials:

===Fluorine-doped silicon dioxide===

By doping SiO2 with fluorine to produce fluorinated silica glass, the relative dielectric constant is lowered from 3.9 to 3.5. Fluorine-doped oxide materials were used for the 180 nm and 130 nm technology nodes.

===Organosilicate glass or OSG (Carbon-doped oxide or CDO)===
By doping SiO2 with carbon, one can lower the relative dielectric constant to 3.0, the density to 1.4 g/cm3 and the thermal conductivity to 0.39 W/(m*K). The semiconductor industry has been using the organosilicate glass dielectrics since the 90 nm technology node.

===Porous silicon dioxide===
Various methods may be employed to create voids or pores in a silicon dioxide dielectric. Voids can have a relative dielectric constant of nearly 1, thus the dielectric constant of the porous material may be reduced by increasing the porosity of the film. Relative dielectric constants lower than 2.0 have been reported. Integration difficulties related to porous silicon dioxide implementation include low mechanical strength and difficult integration with etch and polish processes.

===Porous organosilicate glass (carbon-doped oxide)===
Porous organosilicate materials are usually obtained by a two-step procedure where the first step consists of the co-deposition of a labile organic phase (known as porogen) together with an organosilicate phase resulting in an organic-inorganic hybrid material. In the second step, the organic phase is decomposed by UV curing or annealing at a temperature of up to 400 °C, leaving behind pores in the organosilicate low-κ materials. Porous organosilicate glasses have been employed since the 45 nm technology node.

===Spin-on organic polymeric dielectrics===
Polymeric dielectrics are generally deposited by a spin-on approach, which is traditionally used for the deposition of photoresist materials, rather than chemical vapor deposition. Integration difficulties include low mechanical strength, coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) mismatch and thermal stability. Some examples of spin-on organic low-κ polymers are polyimide, polynorbornenes, benzocyclobutene, and PTFE.

===Spin-on silicon based polymeric dielectric===
There are two kinds of silicon based polymeric dielectric materials, hydrogen silsesquioxane and methylsilsesquioxane.

===Air gaps===
The ultimate low-κ material is air with a relative permittivity value of ~1.0. However, the placement of air gaps between the conducting wires compromises the mechanical stability of the integrated circuit making it impractical to build an IC consisting entirely of air as the insulating material. Nevertheless, the strategic placement of air gaps can improve the chip&#x27;s electrical performance without compromising critically its durability. For example, Intel uses air gaps for two interconnect levels in its 14 nm FinFET technology.

By definition, it is equivalent to half of the body height of the typeface (e.g., in 16-point type it is 8 points). The en is sometimes referred to as the &quot;nut&quot;, to avoid confusion with the similar-sounding &quot;em&quot;.

The en dash () and en space () are each one &quot;en&quot; wide. In English, the en dash is commonly used for inclusive ranges (e.g., &quot;pages 12–17&quot; or &quot;August 7, 1988 – November 26, 2005&quot;), to connect prefixes to open compounds (e.g., &quot;pre–World War II&quot;). 

The en-dash is also increasingly used to replace the long dash (&quot;—&quot;, also called an em dash or em rule). When using it to replace a long dash, spaces are needed either side of it – like so. This is standard practice in the German language, where the hyphen is the only dash without spaces on either side (line breaks are not spaces &quot;per se&quot;).

==History==
Some sources claim the term &quot;en&quot; was derived from the letter &quot;n&quot;, which is roughly half the width of the letter &quot;m&quot;. This etymology, however, is disputed.

Beginning in the late 18th century, compositors were frequently paid by the en, rather than by the page. In the United Kingdom, a commonly cited &quot;standard&quot; rate was 1,000 ens per hour, although actual compositors&#x27; output varied widely. Many workers fell short of this figure, while skilled workers were known to set 2,000–3,000 ens per hour, and late-1900s typesetting competitions often saw participants reach a corrected rate of 4,000 ens per hour. After the introduction of the Linotype typesetters frequently reached rates of at least 6,000 ens per hour.

<text>Almost Here is the debut studio album by English rock band Unbelievable Truth. Available on Virgin Records, catalogue number CDVX2849. Also available on MiniDisc MDV2849 / 7243 8 45155 8 4.

==Background and recording==
Vocalist and guitarist Andy Yorke and drummer Nigel Powell met while attending school, with the latter later meeting bassist Jason Moulster through mutual friends. Yorke had been studying Russian literature abroad in Russia; while there, he wrote several songs and subsequently asked Moulster to form a band on his behalf so they could work on the material when he returned. Unbelievable Truth subsequently formed in 1993, taking their name from a Hal Hartley film. After initial performances, and despite receiving a publishing offer from Zomba Group, Yorke took several more trips to Russia over the next few years, offering himself as an interpreter. The band reformed in September 1996, signing to Virgin Records in March 1997, and getting a publishing deal with Chrysalis Music.

Unbelievable Truth&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Stone&quot;, was released in mid-1997, and was promoted with supporting slots for Beth Orton, Sparklehorse and the Sundays. &quot;Almost Here&quot; was recorded at Great Linford Manor in Buckinghamshire and Powell&#x27;s house. Powell acted as the producer, with Jeremy Wheatley co-producing the sessions. The latter also served as the engineer for the whole album, with Andy Lovegrove and Andy Shillito also engineering &quot;Finest Little Space&quot; and &quot;Higher Than Reason&quot;, respectively. Powell did some additional engineering, with Ady Winman assisting at Great Linford Manor. Wheatley mixed the recordings at Olympic Studios in London with assistant engineer Wayne Wilkins.

==Composition and lyrics==
Musically, the sound of &quot;Almost Here&quot; has been described as soft rock. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine referred to it as an &quot;alluringly moody record, similar to the epic soundscapes&quot; of Radiohead and the Verve, &quot;only with a bit of a country-rock underpinning&quot;. &quot;PopMatters&quot; founder Sarah Zupko wrote that it &quot;relies on largely acoustic arrangements and intricate dynamics&quot;, with influences from emo and &quot;Dog Man Star&quot; (1994) by Suede. Yorke said the music is typically written first with the lyrics coming last; Powell said he would take each individual&#x27;s part and coalesce them together to form a complete song. String instrumentation was added to the various recordings by other musicians: Sharon Warnes (violin on &quot;Angel&quot;, &quot;Same Mistakes&quot; and &quot;Building&quot;); Olivier Bonnici (violin on &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Building&quot;); Philip Heyman (viola on &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Building&quot;); and William Bruce (cello on &quot;Solved&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Stone&quot;). &quot;Solved&quot; and &quot;Settle Down&quot; had the most similarities to Radiohead, with the former not sounding out of place from the material on their third studio album &quot;OK Computer&quot; (1997). &quot;Higher Than Reason&quot; evoked the sound of Jeff Buckley and Nick Drake.

==Release==
To promote the &quot;Higher Than Reason&quot; single, the band went on a UK tour in November 1997. Jim Crosskey assisted the band for their live shows, playing guitars and keyboards. In February 1998, they went on another UK tour. &quot;Higher Than Reason&quot; was released as a single in the US on 2 February 1998. &quot;Almost Here&quot; was released through Virgin Records on 11 May 1998. The band promoted it with a launch show at the Virgin Megastore in Oxford, prior to a UK tour for the rest of the month. Shortly afterwards, they appeared at T in the Park and Glastonbury Festival. &quot;Almost Here&quot; was issued in the US on 20 October 1998. Between October and December 1998, the band supported Tori Amos on her cross-country tour of the US.

==Reception==

Erlewine said Yorke&#x27;s lyricism can be viewed as &quot;adolescent and the Unbelievable Truth&#x27;s ambition often outweighs their accomplishments, but the promise they flaunt on their debut proves that they are almost there&quot;. Zupko added to this, saying that the band had &quot;sculpted a set of compelling, introspective songs that form a cohesive artistic statement&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; writer Angela Lewis saw it as a &quot;true beaut of a debut album [...] with 11 arresting songs that eschew everything the Cool Britannia party has to offer&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer Brent DiCrescenzo said they perform &quot;sylvan, introspective soft-rock that&#x27;s pretty and pleasant, but too mono-emotional (read: sad)&quot;. MTV&#x27;s Kim Stitzel called it &quot;restrained, mild, kinda pretty, and overwhelmingly inoffensive&quot;. Victoria Segal of &quot;NME&quot; went further by writing that it was &quot;supernaturally dull, vaporised by its earnestness&quot; and that it was &quot;useful only as road music for somnambulists, &#x27;Almost Here&#x27; will knock you out. Cold.&quot;

Several reviews compared it to Radiohead; Segal wrote that the band had &quot;enough of a resemblance to Radiohead - serious, sensitive, the usual - to make it unavoidable&quot;. DiCrescenzo was not surprised that the band &quot;sounds like a watered-down Radiohead&quot;, though felt that Andy Yorke lacked the &quot;intensity, tension, and questionable sanity&quot; of Thom Yorke. Tim Mohr of &quot;Consumable Online&quot; dismissed this comparison, stating that the band &quot;don&#x27;t sound remotely similar to Radiohead&quot;, being more inline with Arnold and Crowded House. He goes on to say Andy Yorke&#x27;s vocal &quot;style is completely his own and shows no trace of Thom&quot;. &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; David Jarman wrote that the album &quot;reveals a promising band that doesn&#x27;t need to ride on anyone&#x27;s coattails&quot;, though did admit that Yorke &quot;shares some vocal tics with his brother – a lilting tenor, a fondness for quivering and hurt phrasing&quot;. &quot;Spin&quot; writer Tracey Pepper said Yorke &quot;asserts his independence [from his brother Thom] with a more acoustic sound and lyrics far removed from android paranoia.&quot;

<text>A verst () is an obsolete Russian unit of length defined as 500 sazhen. This makes a verst equal to .

== Plurals and variants ==
In the English language, &quot;verst&quot; is singular with the normal plural &quot;versts&quot;. In Russian, the nominative singular is , but the form usually used with numbers is the genitive plural —10 verst, 25 verst, etc.—whence the English form.

A (, literally &quot;border verst&quot;) is twice as long as a verst.

The verst of the 17th century was 700 sazhens or 1.49 km as against the 500 sazhens or 1.067 km it became at the time of Peter the Great.

== Finnish &quot;virsta&quot; ==

In Finland, a was 1,068.84 m according to the Swedish standard, defined in 1827 as of a , the Finnish language name for the pre-metric Swedish &quot;mil&quot;, used in Finland since the early 17th century (see Obsolete Finnish units of measurement), or 600 (Swedish fathoms, 1.781 m). Metrication replaced with the kilometre in the 1880s.

<text>Bipolar Integrated Technology, Inc. (BIT), later Bit, Inc., was a privately held semiconductor company based in Beaverton, Oregon, which sold products implemented with emitter-coupled logic technology. The company was founded in 1983 by former Floating Point Systems, Intel, and Tektronix engineers. The company, which occupied a 46,000-square-foot manufacturing facility at the Oregon Graduate Center, raised $36 million in start-up capital within three years of its foundation.

The initial product was a floating-point co-processor chipset. Later, the company produced the B5000 SPARC ECL microprocessor (never reached production in a Sun Microsystems product, though used by Floating Point Systems). They also produced the R6000 MIPS ECL microprocessor, which did reach production as a MIPS minicomputer. Initial yields of the R6000 were very poor, leading to parts shortages for MIPS Computer Systems; the latter company attributed their first quarterly loss in October 1990 to BIT. The two signed an agreement in June 1991 to allow BIT to market the R6000 on the open market, dissolving the previous exclusivity agreement with MIPS.

Under its new president Fred Hanson, BIT had its first profitable year in 1991, reaching peak revenues of $20 million. Revenues dropped the following year to about $10 million, however, after it had lost four of its largest customers, including MIPS, Floating Point, and Control Data. The company eventually entered the telecommunications market with Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) devices and Ethernet switches. The company was acquired by PMC-Sierra in September 1996 for these later communications products.

<text>Fort Oglethorpe was a United States Army post in the US state of Georgia. It was established in a 1902 regulation, and received its first contingent in 1904. It served largely as a cavalry post for the 6th Cavalry. During World War I, Fort Oglethorpe housed 4,000 German prisoners of war and civilian detainees. During World War I and World War II, it served as an induction and processing center. During World War II, it was a major training center for the Women&#x27;s Army Corps. 

Originally established with the purchase of 813 acres by the US Government, Fort Oglethorpe also expanded into the territory of the adjacent Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park. (All facilities were removed from the park after the end of WW2, and no evidence remains today.) The Fort was considered to be one of the most modern in the country, and it was used for many things. The Fort saw extensive field-testing of the Bantam Reconnaissance Car, later to be known as the &quot;Jeep.&quot; The Fort was also a major factor in the development of various forms of the Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, or &quot;MASH,&quot; and the perfection of many medical techniques used in trench warfare. Then-Captain Dwight D. Eisenhower served here for four months in 1917 as an instructor. 

The post was declared surplus after World War II and sold. The final flag was lowered at 5:00 PM on December 31, 1946. The majority of the old post formed the nucleus for the present community of Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. Incorporated in February, 1949, it was the first city to be incorporated in Georgia after World War 2.

In the 1930s, soldiers played polo with Summerfield Johnston Sr. (Summerfield Johnston Jr.&#x27;s father), of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company, later known as Coca-Cola Enterprises, at Fort Oglethorpe and on the Johnston farm in McDonald, Tennessee. Polo and other pursuits were considered by the Army to be an important way for soldiers to maintain their riding skills in the years between World Wars 1 and 2, and the Fort hosted both horse shows and national competitions.

The American comic book artist and writer Marc Swayze was stationed at Fort Oglethorpe at the beginning of World War II.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Mitsuru Adachi. It was serialized in Shogakukan&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Sunday&quot; from January 1990 to April 1992, with its chapters collected in 11 volumes. The story is set in a place very similar in appearance to Earth in the Edo period; however, Adachi regularly reminds the reader all throughout the series that the setting is another planet in the distant future which just happens to look like Earth.

After the death of his mother, Shichimi sets out to join his half-brothers and -sister who live together in Karakuri Tenement, a place provided by the father they have never met. He finds out that each of them had different mothers (all of whom have died), but were fathered by the same man. Not long after Shichimi&#x27;s arrival, the siblings decide to journey to visit the graves of each of their mothers. On this journey, they encounter many dangers.

The names are puns on Japanese spices, each one being an ingredient in , also known since the Edo period as , a seasoning made of seven ingredients including chili powder.
==Characters==
===Seven siblings===
:The fourth oldest of the sibling at 15 years old. In his hometown, he was a fireman. He is an expert at using a fireman&#x27;s pike, and he uses a telescoping one – created by Chinpi – as a weapon. He is the only one of the siblings who openly dislikes their mysterious father. Unexpectedly strong, he is the second strongest fighter (or may be the first), behind Asajirō, in their family. Shichimi cannot swim, and fears open water, ships and islands.
:Goma is the oldest of the siblings at 22 years old. He is a rakugo comedian; his stage name is Hirateigoma. He gets along very well with the third brother Keshi, sharing many habits including feasting, drinking, shogi and go. Goma means sesame in Japanese.
:Asajirō is the second oldest, 20 years old, and a wandering artist. He frequently takes long trips for inspiration, occasionally briefly stopping by the tenement between trips. He holds the record for being the youngest to achieve the rank of master in the Haniwa-style sword technique. He has the ability of and usually subconsciously depicted his visions in drawings; at the end of the manga, he subconsciously drew Shichimi and Natane in their future wedding. The first character of Asajiro&#x27;s name means hemp.
:The third oldest, 18 years old, and raised as a monk in a Buddhist temple. He is an extremely strong martial artist, though he is weak when it comes to alcohol and dealing with women. It seems he was a bully when he was a kid, seen from the attitude of villagers (and his friend) after they hear his name. Keshi means poppy seed.
:The only girl among the siblings, Natane is 13 years old. She has learned her swordcraft and painting from Asajirō, and has become very skilled. She is constantly bickering with Shichimi. Natane means rapeseed. Later in the series, she learned that she was actually an adopted daughter of the shogun, unlike the other siblings. She frequently had dreams about a brother she had who abandoned her when they were children. That brother was ultimately revealed as Furon. In the last chapter, Asajirō foresaw her marriage with her adoptive brother Shichimi.
:Chinpi is a brilliant inventor despite being only 10 years old. He wears glasses, and is the second youngest. He is also shown as a skilled craftsman, making various tools and weapons, including Shichimi&#x27;s pike, explosive ammunition, and even a helicopter for dispersing pesticide and herbicide. Chinpi means citrus peel.
:The youngest, at three years old, Sanshō possesses amazing ninjutsu abilities due to his frequent training with Hanzō, head of the ninja clan under the shogun&#x27;s command and came from a ninja village. Sanshō mean Sichuan pepper.
:A very powerful swordsman who wanders around in search of his step-sister Natane, and the true child of the shogun, thus the true one of the seven siblings. After accidentally killing his step-father as a child in a training session, he left home and went on for training out of guilt. Nearly at the end of the manga, he made the ultimate sacrifice of his life to protect Natane from Shōgo&#x27;s trap. Even at the last moment of his life, he refused to acknowledge any relation other than that to his sister when Shichimi told him the truth.

===The Shogunate===
:The eighth shogun of the Okugawa clan (possibly a spoof on the actual shogun clan of Tokugawa). He appeared to be a happy-go-lucky pervert who frequently wandered from town to town and neglected his shogun duty, but he was also a very skilled swordsman, which enabled him to save his son Shichimi and his daughter Natane. His perversion was evidenced by the fact that he had six different children with six different women, who had all died by the time the story took place. His encounter with Shichimi and Natane on their way to pay tribute to all of the mothers later revealed that Natane was not his blood daughter and that brother of hers was his blood son. He liked to put on several disguises to help his children, one of which involved a mask of Ranma from &quot;Ranma ½&quot;.
:Akimitsu&#x27;s sassy and entitled princess. She always wore western clothes, and always hated Natane due to her closeness with Shichimi. She eavesdropped the truth from the shogun and went straight to tell it in order to hurt Natane.
:An old man who served the shogun and kept him in check. He gathered all the siblings (except Furon) at a shared home, but never told them who their father was.
:Likely based on Hattori Hanzō, he was a master ninja. Under Hikoroku&#x27;s instructions, he gave his all to keeping the shogun&#x27;s children from harm&#x27;s way (including destroying evidence of Natane&#x27;s true origin), which ultimately cost him his life to Shōgo&#x27;s dirty trick.

===Other characters===
:An actual alien who came with his partner from another Earth, one that was a lot more modern and polluted, unlike this Earth which was still in feudal times, although everyone else at the time just thought of them as western foreigners. He frequently had nightmares about the polluted Earth he ran away from, except for that one time when he, for some reason, &quot;exchanged&quot; dreams with the shogun for a &quot;wetter&quot; one, which made the shogun wake up at night because of the strange dream he got in return. At first, he schemed to influence the shogunate, but later he decided settle on this Earth, got married with a Japanese woman, and decided to devote his life to building a better world unlike his former one.
:Akimitsu&#x27;s younger brother. He always tried to overthrow his brother with his evil schemes, with the help from the &quot;foreigners&quot;. He ultimately died by karma: being stung by a poisonous wasp.
:Takamitsu&#x27;s disgruntled son who had &quot;daddy issues&quot; with his father, who never cared about him and his mother. He always tried to kill Shichimi and take Natane away. At one encounter, he had to retreat because the shogun intervened to save his children in the Ranma mask.
:A cowardly and incompetent ninja who served Takamitsu. He considered himself to be Hanzō&#x27;s rival, and he was assigned to assassinate the shogun&#x27;s children. Of course, he could never succeed as they were protected by Hanzō, but also because of his utmost cowardice and incompetence. When Hanzō died, it was stated that Akamaru would never die because of his stupidity.
:An American boy who got stranded in Japan and captured by a Japanese ship. Captain Ban sent assassins to kill him in fear that he would expose their true nature. He was saved by Shichimi&#x27;s gang and followed them since. He could barely speak Japanese, but somehow he was able to understand Japanese up to a point. His home state&#x27;s name, Ohio, sounded almost like &quot;ohayo&quot;, the Japanese word for &quot;good morning&quot;, which triggered Natane and Shichimi into killing their own siblings when they were under hypnosis from one of Takamitsu&#x27;s assassins. At the end of the manga, he dated Koto because she could not continue to hit on Shichimi now that she knew he was her brother.

<text>Arthur Benner Lintgen (born 1942) is an American physician from Philadelphia who can recognize classical phonograph records with the naked eye. This ability was verified by James Randi in 1982, although Lintgen claims no extrasensory powers, merely knowledge of the way that the groove forms patterns on particular recordings.

Lintgen attended the University of Pennsylvania and Jefferson Medical College. He first attempted to identify a record with its label covered after a colleague challenged him to try it at a party. When Lintgen sees a vinyl record, he can recognize the music in a couple of seconds. Based on the physical construction and the grooves and contours on the record, he can recognize sections where music is loud or quiet, the length of each movement and so on. Then he uses his extensive knowledge of European classical music to recognize the music. He can also draw extra information about the structure of the vinyl; for example, because records from different companies are slightly different, he can sometimes guess the conductor.

However, his ability is strictly limited to classical orchestral music by and after Beethoven. He says instrumental and chamber music creates unrecognizable patterns, and that pre-Beethoven orchestral pieces are usually too alike in structure to identify. When given an Alice Cooper recording as a control, he said it looked &quot;disorganized&quot; and &quot;[like] gibberish&quot;. Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony is the most common record he is asked to identify; on one occasion he correctly guessed the record without even glancing at it.

<text>Potts Point is a small and densely populated suburb in inner-city Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Potts Point is located east of the Sydney central business district and is part of the local government area of the City of Sydney.

Potts Point sits on a ridge immediately east of Woolloomooloo, west of Elizabeth Bay and Rushcutters Bay and north of Darlinghurst. The suburb has a roughly trapezoidal shape, and at its greatest extent is no more than long by wide. The suburb&#x27;s boundaries include Macleay Street to the east, Darlinghurst Road to the southeast, William Street to the south, Brougham Street and part of Cowper Wharf Roadway to the west.

==Kings Cross and Garden Island==
Kings Cross is not an officially designated suburb of Sydney, but rather a locality encompassed entirely by the suburbs of Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay. Kings Cross is a commercial area that is dominated by bars, restaurants, nightclubs, strip clubs and adult bookstores.

Kings Cross railway station is situated beneath Darlinghurst Road, and the Garden Island facility of the Royal Australian Navy sits on the north end of Potts Point.

==History==
The original name of the land now known as Potts Point is Derrawunn, Dharag Language.

Potts Point is named for Joseph Hyde Potts, who was employed by the Bank of New South Wales. He purchased six-and-a-half acres of harbourside land in an area then known as Woolloomooloo Hill – which he renamed Potts Point.

Much of the area that today comprises Potts Point and the adjacent suburb of Elizabeth Bay, originally constituted part of a land grant to Alexander Macleay, who was the New South Wales Colonial Secretary from 1826 to 1837, and for whom Macleay Street is named. NSW Judge Advocate, John Wylde (for whom Wylde Street is named) was another 19th-century public servant who owned land in the area. Potts Point is mentioned in the poem William Street by notable Australian poet Henry Lawson.

===19th century===

The area was further subdivided after Macleay&#x27;s time, and a number of grand Georgian mansions were built along the high point of the suburb&#x27;s ridge line. Several of these survive (albeit much hemmed in by later buildings), including Rockwall and Tusculum. Rockwall, located in Rockwall Crescent, is a two-storey (plus cellar) sandstone villa with five bays and a verandah that encircles the house. It was one of the earlier homes designed by architect John Verge and was built from 1831 to 1837. It is the only one of these which has a garden and is in private ownership.

Tusculum, located in Manning Street, is a two-storey Regency mansion that was also designed by John Verge. His client was the merchant A. B. Spark, for whom the house was built in 1831–35. It was a twin to Rockwell House and was enlarged in the 1870s by the addition of verandahs on three sides. The first tenant was Bishop William Broughton.

Kenilworth, was built on land that was originally part of the 1831 grant to Thomas Barker and was once a neighbour Barker&#x27;s house, Rosyln Hall.

The Roslyn Hall estate was subdivided into seven lots in 1860 and Roslyn Street was created. Around 1869, Kenilworth was built for Henry Williams. It remained in the hands of its original family until 1944 when it was sold to St Luke&#x27;s Hospital.

Manar, in Macleay Street, is a complex of three blocks of flats which dates back from the original house c.1880 through to the Inter-war Free Classical style buildings of the 1920s. They are two to three stories in height with cement rendered masonry walls and terracotta tiles roofs. The 1920s wings were designed by the architectural practice of Ernest A Scott and Green (1911–1932), later known as Scott Green and Scott (1932–1947). Residents of Manar have included William Parker who served as Master in Lunacy in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, Sir Mungo William MacCallum, Sydney Ure Smith, Sir Garfield Barwick, Senator John Ignatius Armstrong, Mary McEwen, widow of Sir John McEwen, and Mary Bailey-Tart, the only daughter of Sir Earle Page

Other heritage buildings in the area include the Mansions Terrace in Bayswater Road; the terrace and townhouse group extending from 13 to 29 Challis Avenue; the group of Late Victorian terraces from 1–13 Kellett Street; the gazebo in HMAS Kuttabul; and Bomera and Tarana on the corner of Wylde Street and Cowper Wharf Roadway. These buildings are all listed on the Register of the National Estate.

In 1871, Edmund Blacket built Stramshall in Macleay Street for the Hordern family of merchants. Thomas Rowe made further additions in 1877. The house was later known as Jenner House and was taken over by the Department of Defence, who sold it to the horse breeder Tony Peterson in 1998. Peterson sold the house for $15 million in 2009. It was listed by the National Trust in 1967.

Most of the other mansions, such as Orwell, have survived only as street names. The area also boasts many fine Victorian-era terraces. These are chiefly located along Victoria Street, which bisects Potts Point from north to south, and is widely known for its impressive canopy of plane trees.

===20th century===

Potts Point was the site of some of Australia&#x27;s earliest blocks of flats, and from the 1920s through to World War II the area was intensively developed along those lines. As a result, it boasts the highest concentration of Art Deco architecture in Australia. Amongst the most notable examples are the Macleay Regis, Cahors and Franconia residential buildings in Macleay Street, and Carinthia and Carisbrooke in Springfield Avenue.

Two notable Streamline Moderne buildings in Australia: the Minerva (or Metro) Theatre and the Minerva Building are in Orwell Street. The Metro Theatre (as it was then known) was designed by Bruce Dellit and built in 1940. It was the site of the first Australian production of the musical &quot;Hair&quot; in 1970, and is heritage-listed.

During the Vietnam War, the Darlinghurst Road precinct (commonly known as Kings Cross), which straddles Potts Point and Elizabeth Bay, became a popular destination for US military personnel on R&amp;R, due chiefly to its proximity to a major naval facility. Partially as a result of this, the area attracted organised crime syndicates and developed an unsavoury reputation as Australia&#x27;s drugs and prostitution capital. Dozens of hotels constructed at the time ensured that &quot;The Cross&quot; remained a tourism mecca well into the 1990s.

In 1964, the Rev. Ted Noffs started the Wayside Chapel, an unorthodox Methodist ministry to the Kings Cross area. It began as a small drop-in centre in a block of flats at 29 Hughes Street, and grew into a complex that occupies two blocks of flats. It is a major welfare and community centre in the area.

===21st century===

At the turn of the 21st century, almost all of Potts Point&#x27;s hotels were acquired by developers attracted by the area&#x27;s proximity to transportation and amenities. By 2004 most tourist hotels had been converted or rebuilt as expensive unit developments, resulting in a rapid wider gentrification of the area and increasingly large numbers of gay residents that make up a significant portion of affluent same-sex couples in Australia although the continued presence of a number of large and small backpacker hostels in Victoria Street and surrounding streets and dozens of pubs, nightclubs, restaurants and similar venues have confirmed the suburb&#x27;s role as one of Sydney&#x27;s leading entertainment precincts.

From 2003 to 2004, the City of Sydney undertook a major streetscape upgrade centred on Darlinghurst Road and the southern part of Macleay Street, involving footpath-widening, roadside tree-plantings and the installation of new paving, street furniture and lighting. Plans to force the replacement of historic neon shopfront and awning signage on strip clubs and other adult commercial premises in the area with generic signage proved more controversial and have not been implemented.

Potts Point can be accessed on foot from Woolloomooloo. There is a number of stairways that connect the two neighbouring suburbs: Butler and Hills Stairs (103 and 24 steps, respectively), McElhone Stairs (113 steps) – also known as the &quot;Stairs of Doom&quot; or &quot;Stairs of Death&quot; by locals – and Horderns Stairs.

==Politics==
Potts Point has been administered by Sydney City Council since March 2004. Prior to this it was administered alternately by South Sydney Council and Sydney City Council at various periods throughout its history.

<doc id="934113" wikidata="Q202391" url="?curid=934113" title="Racewalking">
<text>Race walking, or racewalking, is a long-distance discipline within the sport of athletics. Although a foot race, it is different from running in that one foot must appear to be in contact with the ground at all times. Race judges carefully assess that this is maintained throughout the race. Typically held on either roads or running tracks, common distances range from up to 100 kilometres (62.1 mi).

The current race walking contests at the Summer Olympics are the 20 kilometres race walk (men and women) and the marathon race walk mixed relay, the latter of which debuted at the 2024 Summer Olympics. The 50 kilometres race walk (men only) was discontinued after the 2020 Summer Olympics. The biennial World Athletics Championships also features both 20 and 50 kilometer events, the 50 km walk for women being contested until 2019. The 50 km race walk was replaced by the 35 kilometres race walk as standard championship discipline in 2022. The IAAF World Race Walking Cup, first held in 1961, is a stand-alone global competition for the discipline and it has 10 kilometres race walks for junior athletes, in addition to the Olympic-standard events. The IAAF World Indoor Championships featured 5000 m and 3000 m race walk variations, but these were discontinued after 1993. Top-level athletics championships and games typically feature 20 km racewalking events.

The sport emerged from a British culture of long-distance competitive walking known as pedestrianism, which began to develop the ruleset that is the basis of the modern discipline around the mid-19th century. Since the mid-20th century onwards, Russian and Chinese athletes have been among the most successful on the global stage, with Europe and parts of Latin America producing most of the remaining top-level walkers. However, it has been particularly affected by doping, with many Russian world and Olympic champions testing positive for banned performance-enhancing drugs.

Compared to other forms of foot racing, stride length is reduced; to achieve competitive speeds racewalkers must attain cadence rates comparable to those achieved by running.

==Rules==
There are only two rules that govern race walking. The first dictates that the athlete&#x27;s back toe cannot leave the ground until the heel of the front foot has touched. Violation of this rule is known as &quot;loss of contact.&quot; The second rule requires that the supporting leg must straighten from the point of contact with the ground and remain straightened until the body passes directly over it. These rules are judged by the unaided human eye. Athletes regularly lose contact for a few milliseconds per stride, which can be caught on film, but such a short flight phase is said to be undetectable to the human eye.

Athletes stay low to the ground by keeping their arms pumping low, close to their hips. If one sees a racewalker&#x27;s shoulders rising, it may be a sign that the athlete is losing contact with the ground. What appears to be an exaggerated swivel to the hip is, in fact, a full rotation of the pelvis. Athletes aim to move the pelvis forward and to minimize sideways motion in order to achieve maximum forward propulsion. Speed is achieved by stepping quickly with the aim of rapid turnover. This minimizes the risk of the feet leaving the ground. Strides are short and quick, with pushoff coming forward from the ball of the foot, again to minimize the risk of losing contact with the ground. World-class race walkers (male and female) can average under 4 and 5 minutes per kilometre in a 20 km race walk (12 to 15 kilometers per hour or 7.5 to 9 miles per hour).

==Distances==

Races have been walked at distances as short as at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and as long as 100 km (62.1 mi). The men&#x27;s world record for the 50-mile race walk is held by Israeli Shaul Ladany, whose time of 7:23:50 in 1972 beat the world record that had stood since 1935. The modern Olympic events are the 20 km (12.4 mi) race walk (men and women) and 50 km (31 mi) race walk (men only). One example of a longer race walking competition is the annual Paris-Colmar which is 450 to 500 km. Indoor races are 3000 m and 5000 m.

==Judges==

There are judges on the course to monitor form. Three judges submitting &quot;red cards&quot; for violations results in disqualification of the competitor. There is a scoreboard placed on the course so competitors can see their violation status. If the third violation is received, the chief judge removes the competitor from the course by showing a red paddle. For monitoring reasons, races are held on a looped course or on a track so judges get to see competitors several times during a race. A judge could also &quot;caution&quot; competitors in danger of losing form by showing a paddle that indicates either losing contact or bent knees. No judge may submit more than one card for each walker. The chief judge&#x27;s job is only to disqualify the offending walker and may not submit any caution cards. Disqualifications are routine at the elite level, such as the famous case of Jane Saville, disqualified within sight of a gold medal in front of her home crowd in the 2000 Summer Olympics, or Lü Xiuzhi, disqualified 20 metres before the finish line at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics.

==Beginning==
Race walking developed as one of the original track and field events of the first meeting of the English Amateur Athletics Association in 1880. The first race walking codes came from an attempt to regulate rules for popular 19th-century long-distance competitive walking events, called pedestrianism. Pedestrianism had developed, like footraces and horse racing, as a popular working class British and American pastime, and a venue for wagering. Walkers organised the first English amateur walking championship in 1866, which was won by John Chambers, and judged by the &quot;fair heel and toe&quot; rule. This rather vague code was the basis for the rules codified at the first Championships Meeting in 1880 of the Amateur Athletics Association in England, the birth of modern athletics. With football (soccer), cricket, and other sports codified in the 19th century, the transition from professional pedestrianism to amateur race walking was, while relatively late, part of a process of regularisation occurring in most modern sports at this time.

The Walk was included at the 1876 to 1879 National Association of Amateur Athletes of America Championships.

==Olympics==

Race walking is an Olympic athletics (track and field) event with distances of 20 kilometres for both men and women and 50 kilometres for men only. 

Race walking first appeared in the modern Olympics in 1904 in the form of a half-mile (804.672m) walk in the all-round competition, the precursor to the 10-event decathlon. In 1908, stand-alone 1,500m and 3,000m race walks were added, and, excluding 1924, there has been at least one race walk (for men) in every Olympics since. 

Women&#x27;s race walking became an Olympic event in 1992, following years of active lobbying by female internationals. 

A World Cup in race walking is held biennially, and race walk events appear in the World Athletics Championships, the Commonwealth Games and the Pan American Games, among others.

==World Race Walking Challenge==
Since 2003, the IAAF has organised the IAAF Race Walking Challenge, an annual worldwide competition series in which elite athletes accumulate points for the right to compete in the IAAF Race Walking Challenge Final and to share over US$200,000 of prize money. The series of televised events takes place in several countries each year including Mexico, Spain, Russia and China.

==Age groups==
USA Track &amp; Field offers racewalking at the Youth, Open, All-Comers, and Masters levels.

High School: Racewalking is sometimes included in high school indoor and outdoor track meets, the rules often more relaxed. The distances walked tend to be relatively short, with the 1500 m being the most commonly held event. Racing also occurs at 3 km, 5 km and 10 km, with records kept and annual rankings published.

==As an individual pursuit==
While participating in races essentially defines race walking, it can be practised by individuals for their own benefit, much like joggers not taking part in racing. One former jogger has written about injuries sustained while running, recommending race walking, which is much easier on the joints, instead. Requiring to have one foot in contact with the ground at all times reduces the impacts on ankles, knees, and hips that lead to running injuries.

The women&#x27;s 50 km walk is a new event, having been controversially added to the World Athletics Championships for the first time in 2017.

==In popular culture==
Despite being one of the original disciplines of modern athletics, racewalking is sometimes derided as a contrived or &quot;artificial&quot; sport. In 1992, noted sportscaster and longtime Olympic commentator Bob Costas compared it to &quot;a contest to see who can whisper the loudest&quot;.

In &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; season 4 episode &quot;Malcolm Holds His Tongue&quot;, Hal gets into the sport and exposes his local park rival as &#x27;nothing but a common jogger&#x27; by proving that both of his feet leave the ground once every fourth step.

In the 1966 film &quot;Walk, Don&#x27;t Run&quot;, Jim Hutton plays a racewalker competing in the Tokyo Olympics. Cary Grant and Samantha Eggar co-star. 

Irish Olympian John Kelly appears briefly as a racewalker in the 1968 musical film &quot;Star!&quot;, starring Julie Andrews and Richard Crenna. 

In the 2021 film &quot;Queenpins&quot;, actress Kristen Bell plays a 3-time gold medal Olympic racewalker and extreme couponer.

In a local Seattle sketch comedy series &quot;Almost Live!&quot;, Bill Nye played &quot;Speed Walker&quot;: a superhero who fights crime while adhering to the standards of competitive speed-walking.

<text>Save the Children International, formerly known as the International Save The Children Alliance, is a worldwide non-profit organization that aims to improve the living of children. There are 30 Save the Children member organizations around the world.

==History==
The Save the Children Alliance was founded in Geneva in 1972 by a number of Save the Children members, to co-ordinate their work.

In 1997, a more formal structure was set up and the organisation was renamed the International Save the Children Alliance. Soon afterward, a permanent secretariat was set up in London. This was later moved to Geneva but currently is based once more in London. Since 2010 it has been known as Save the Children International.

Save the Children International continues the worldwide aims of the original Save the Children organization, which was founded in 1919 in London and became part of the International Save the Children Union founded in Geneva in 1920.

Save the Children was founded in 1919 after the First World War. It was founded in the United Kingdom by Eglantyne Jebb, a British social reformer, and her sister Dorothy, to improve the lives of children through better education, economic help, emergency aid, and health care in the United Kingdom. In 1924, the League of Nations adopted Jebb&#x27;s charter on children&#x27;s rights.

<text>Laskarina Pinotsi, commonly known as Bouboulina (; 1771 – 22 May 1825), was a Greek naval commander, a woman of the Greek War of Independence in 1821, and considered perhaps the first woman to attain the rank of admiral.

Bouboulina was born in Constantinople in 1771. Her father was Stavrianos Pinotsis, an Arvanite from Hydra and her mother was Skevo Kokkini, descendant of the Byzantine Kokkinis family. During her youth, she developed an interest in sailing which was facilitated by her stepfather&#x27;s liberal attitude to education. She was widowed twice, inheriting a considerable sum of money from her second husband. She later allegedly joined the Filiki Etaireia secret society which sought to achieve Greek independence from the Ottoman Empire, being among the few women to do so. Following the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence she commanded a fleet of Spetsiot ships which contributed to several campaigns most notably the siege of Nafplion.

Following the defeat of her faction in the Greek civil war in 1824, Bouboulina was briefly imprisoned and expelled to Spetses. She was killed on 22 May 1825, during the course of a family feud.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Bouboulina was born in 1771 in Constantinople. She was the daughter of Stavrianos Pinotsis, a captain from Hydra island, and his wife Skevo (Paraskevi) Kokkini, descendant of the notable Byzantine Kokkinis family; a large part of this family lived in the island of Zakynthos. From her father&#x27;s side, she originated from the local native Arvanite population of the island of Hydra. The Ottomans had imprisoned Pinotsis for his part in the failed Orlov revolt of 1769–1770 against the Ottoman rule shortly after the birth of his daughter. Her father died soon afterward and the mother and child returned to Hydra. Bouboulina&#x27;s family moved to Spetses when she was four years old. Her mother later married Spetsiot Dimitrios Lazarou-Orlov. Lazarou had previously double-barrelled his family name to Lazarou-Orlov in order to commemorate his participation in the Orlov revolt and declare his loyalty to Russia. Bouboulina grew up alongside her half-siblings. During her youth she enjoyed swimming, fishing, riding on horseback, sailing and singing klepht songs. Her stepfather encouraged her interest in sailing beyond the accepted social norms of the time, a decision which has been attributed to his admiration for Russian empress Catherine the Great. Her home&#x27;s library contained many books from Enlightenment era writers including those of Friedrich von Schiller and Voltaire.

She married captain Dimitrios Yiannouzas with whom she had three children; Yiannouzas drowned during a battle against Algerian pirates. She later remarried the wealthy shipowner and captain Dimitrios Bouboulis, taking his surname. Bouboulis likewise drowned in a battle against Algerian pirates on 10 May 1811 off the shore of Lampedusa. Bouboulina took over his fortune and his trading business, acquiring shares in other Spetsiot ships. She traveled to Constantinople in 1814. The Ottomans were aware of the fortune Bouboulina had inherited from her husband and were seeking a premise to seize it in 1816. The Ottomans argued that Bouboulis&#x27; assets should be forfeited since he had fought on the Russian side during the last Russo-Turkish war. Bouboulina returned to Constantinople in 1816 to argue her case, enlisting the help of the Russian ambassador and the Valide Sultan. The latter was able to convince the Ottoman officials to allow Bouboulina to retain her property.

Bouboulina was visited by nationalist priest Papaflessas in 1818. Following her meeting with Papaflessas, she made her third visit to Constantinople. Bouboulina joined the Filiki Etaireia, an underground organization that was preparing Greece for revolution against Ottoman rule. She would have been one of a few women, but she is not named in historical members lists. Upon her return to Spetses, she ordered the construction of a ship that was larger than Ottoman regulations would allow. The Ottomans dispatched admiral Hussein to ensure Bouboulina adhered to Ottoman law. Bouboulina proceeded to bribe Hussein, who then signed a report indicating that the ship was a long range Spetsiot trade ship. &quot;Agamemnon&quot; was armed with 18 cannons and went on to become the first warship in modern-day Greece.

===Greek War of Independence===
Upon the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence, Bouboulina sailed on the &quot;Agamemnon,&quot; which was commanded by her son Yiannis Yiannouzas, to Nafplion, along with another ship commanded by her half brother Manolis Lazarou-Orlov, imposing a naval blockade on the city on 4 April 1821. Bouboulina and Staikos Staikopoulos then appealed to the Spetsiots who dispatched seven more ships to assist in the siege. Bouboulina commanded great respect among the revolutionaries who nicknamed her Kapetanissa (Captain) and Kyra (Lady). On 10 April, the besieged Ottomans exploited the fact that the Greek sentries were celebrating Orthodox Easter, breaking through the siege. Bouboulina then disembarked at Myloi and traveled to Argos on horseback, supplying the local rebels with money and ammunition. In Argos, Bouboulina participated in a conference of local military commanders and kodjabashis, where the Greeks decided to resume the siege of Nafplion.

The siege of Nafplion continued until the rebels became aware of the Kehaya Bey&#x27;s force which had reached Corinth and was heading to relieve the siege. Yiannis Yiannouzas then assembled troops from Argos, Spetses and Kranidi in order to check the Kehaya Bey&#x27;s advance and was killed in May in the ensuing battle outside Argos. Bouboulina subsequently traveled to the battlefield in order to collect her son&#x27;s remains who was beheaded in the aftermath of the battle. According to Dutch consul she personally executed three Ottoman prisoners during her son&#x27;s funeral ceremony. After failing to capture Argos or burning it (according to Kolokotronis), the Kehaya Bey reinforced Nafplion&#x27;s garrison and departed for Tripolitsa. Bouboulina then resumed the naval blockade of Nafplion. In May 1821, she blockaded Monemvasia with the &quot;Agamemnon&quot;, while the rest of the Spetsiot fleet remained off the shore of Nafplion. The garrison of Monemvasia surrendered on 25 July, at the same time another of her ships resupplied Galaxidi. Rumors of Bouboulina&#x27;s exploits spread beyond Greece and many foreign philhellenes sought to meet her. During one such meeting in Astros, one foreign volunteer (Maurice Persat) showed her a lithograph depicting her which he had purchased in Paris. The highly romanticized and inaccurate depiction caused Bouboulina to burst out laughing.

In September 1821, she arrived in Tripolitsa which was besieged by the troops of general Theodoros Kolokotronis. The Ottomans were on the brink of surrender and were requesting a safe exit of the local officials along with their harems and release of a number of prisoners. On 18 September, Kolokotronis convened a meeting of his officers to discuss the terms offered by their adversaries. Bouboulina took an active part in the negotiations, intervening to save the lives of the women from Hursit&#x27;s harem upon Valide Sultan&#x27;s request. Kolokotronis allowed only the officials of Albanian origin to depart the city. Three days later the city fell to the Greeks who massacred the local Muslim population and looted their properties. Bouboulina was subsequently accused on taking part in the looting (which was a common practice in both Greek and Ottoman warfare of the period). After the fall of Tripolitsa, Bouboulina returned to Nafplion to personally oversee its blockade.

She participated to the naval section of a failed assault on Nauplia in December 1821, where she distinguished herself by her courage. Her biographers don&#x27;t provide details of her activities during the subsequent phases of the siege of Nauplia: she is not mentioned as having taken part in the events of the Expedition of Dramali which resulted in another break of the siege of Nauplia, nor to the battle of Nauplia in September 1822.

On 22 November 1822, the Ottomans surrendered the Palamidi fortress. On 3 December 1822, the Ottoman population of Nafplion was allowed to safely depart for Asia Minor, surrendering the city to the Greeks. Bouboulina was appointed to one of the commissions tasked with redistributing the property of Nafplio&#x27;s Muslim population, a position she abused for personal gain.

Bouboulina then moved into a house in Nafplion. Soon afterward she gave her daughter Eleni Boubouli in marriage to Kolokotronis&#x27; son Panos Kolokotronis. Panos Kolokotronis was appointed the commander of Nafplion&#x27;s garrison, making Bouboulina one of the region&#x27;s most powerful people.

Bouboulina stayed in Nafplion until the civil war of 1824 during which she supported the faction of Kolokotronis. She and Panos Kolokotronis were blockaded in the city by pro-governmental forces from 8/20 March 1824, at sea by Miaoulis with two brigs and two gunboats, and on the land by 500 Kranidiots and Poriots. After the agreement that put an end to the first civil war, P. Kolokotronis eventually surrendered the fortress on June 7/19 and joined his father in Karytaina Discussions about Bouboulina&#x27;s treatment illustrated the growing dissent between members of the victorious governmental faction: the president Koundouriotis insisted on her expulsion from Nafplion, while Zaimis and Londos interceded in her favor, to no avail.: her house in Nafplion was confiscated and she departed for Spetses. She was imprisoned for some time on false charges of witchcraft and heresy by her islander political opponents before being eventually released.

On 22 November 1824, during the second civil war, Panos Kolokotronis was either (according to conflicting interpretations) murdered or killed in battle. by pro-governmental troops. Although Theodoros Kolokotronis wanted to giver her in marriage to someone of his choice, Bouboulina secretly took her daughter Eleni back, leaving her dowry behind, perhaps to marry her to the Northern chieftain Theodore Grivas in order to secure an alliance with him, or because the two had alteady an extramarital affair After the final defeat of his faction in the second civil war, Kolokotronis was imprisoned in February 1825.

===Death in feud===
Eugenia Koutsi and Bouboulina&#x27;s son Georgios Yiannouzas had eloped, after the former was forced by her family to betroth a man she disliked. Bouboulina had supported her son&#x27;s decision. On 22 May 1825, armed members of the Koutsis family went to Bouboulina&#x27;s house, believing that the couple was hiding inside. When Bouboulina confronted them from the balcony, she was shot and killed by one of the armed men.

==Legacy==
A few days after her death, a Russian delegation presented her with the honorary rank of Admiral of the Russian Navy granted by Tsar Alexander I of Russia, making her perhaps the first woman in world naval history to hold this title. In 2018 she was granted the title of Rear Admiral (expressed in Greek as Υποναύαρχος) in the Hellenic Navy.

Bouboulina was depicted on the reverse of both the Greek ₯50 banknote of 1978 and the ₯1 coin of 1988–2001. A statue of Bouboulina sculpted by Natalia Mela-Konstantinidou is located at Spetses. A bust of Bouboulina created by Lazaros Lameras is located in Tinos while a copy of it hosted in the Pedion tou Areos. There is also a bust of her at the junction of Bouboulinas street and Emmanouil Sofroni street in Nafplion.
The Greek drama film, &quot;Bouboulina&quot;, starring Irene Papas in the titular role was released in 1959, it was directed and written by Kostas Andritsos. A documentary film based on a fictionalized account of her life and deeds, &quot;The Brave Stepped Back: The Life and Times of Laskarina Bouboulina&quot;, was released in 2005, debuting at the Armata Festival in Spetses.

Lela Karagianni (sometimes spelled Karayanni or Carayannis), leader of the Greek Resistance cell Bouboulina during the Second World War, was her great-granddaughter.

<text>Alphonse Bertillon (; 22 April 1853 – 13 February 1914) was a French police officer and biometrics researcher who applied the anthropological technique of anthropometry to law enforcement creating an identification system based on physical measurements.

Anthropometry was the first scientific system used by police to identify criminals. Before that time, criminals could only be identified by name or photograph. The method was eventually supplanted by fingerprinting.

He is also the inventor of the mug shot. Photographing of criminals began in the 1840s only a few years after the invention of photography, but it was not until 1888 that Bertillon standardized the process.

His flawed evidence was used to wrongly convict Alfred Dreyfus in the infamous Dreyfus affair.

== Biography ==
Alphonse Bertillon was born in Paris. He was a son of statistician Louis-Adolphe Bertillon and younger brother of the statistician and demographer Jacques Bertillon.

After being expelled from the Imperial Lycée of Versailles, Bertillon drifted through a number of jobs in England and France, before being conscripted into the French army in 1875. Several years later, he was discharged from the army with no real higher education, so his father arranged for his employment in a low-level clerical job at the Prefecture of Police in Paris. Thus, Bertillon began his police career on 15 March 1879 as a department copyist.

Being an orderly man, he was dissatisfied with the &quot;ad hoc&quot; methods used to identify the increasing number of captured criminals who had been arrested before. This, together with the steadily rising recidivism rate in France since 1870, motivated his invention of anthropometrics. He did his measurements in his spare time. He used the famous La Santé Prison in Paris for his activities, facing jeers from the prison inmates as well as police officers.

Bertillon also created many other forensics techniques, including the use of galvanoplastic compounds to preserve footprints, ballistics, and the dynamometer, used to determine the degree of force used in breaking and entering.

The nearly 100-year-old standard of comparing 16 ridge characteristics to identify latent prints at crime scenes against criminal records of fingerprint impressions was based on claims in a 1912 paper Bertillon published in France.

Alphonse Bertillon died 13 February 1914 in Paris.

== Bertillon and the Dreyfus affair ==
Alphonse Bertillon was a witness for the prosecution in the Dreyfus affair in 1894 and again in 1899. He testified as a handwriting expert and claimed that Alfred Dreyfus had written the incriminating document (known as the &quot;bordereau&quot;). However, he was not a handwriting expert, and his convoluted and flawed evidence was a significant contributing factor to one of the most infamous miscarriages of justice — the condemnation of the innocent Dreyfus to life imprisonment on Devil&#x27;s Island.

Using a complex system of measurements, he attempted to prove that Dreyfus had disguised his handwriting by imitating his own handwriting as if someone else was doing so, so that if anyone thought the &quot;bordereau&quot; was in Dreyfus&#x27;s hand, he would be able to say that someone else had forged his writing. Both courts martial evidently accepted this, and Dreyfus was convicted. The verdict of the second court martial caused a huge scandal, and it was eventually overturned.

Bertillon was by many accounts regarded as extremely eccentric. According to Maurice Paléologue, who observed him at the second court-martial, Bertillon was &quot;certainly not in full possession of his faculties&quot;. Paléologue goes on to describe Bertillon&#x27;s argument as &quot;... a long tissue of absurdities&quot;, and writes of &quot;... his moonstruck eyes, his sepulchral voice, the saturnine magnetism&quot; that made him feel that he was &quot;... in the presence of a necromancer&quot;.

Bertillon claimed that his graphological system was based on mathematical probability calculus. A later analysis undertaken in 1904 by three renowned mathematicians, Henri Poincaré, Jean Gaston Darboux, and Paul Émile Appell, concluded that Bertillon&#x27;s system was devoid of any scientific value and that he had failed both to apply the method and to present his data properly. With this key evidence against Dreyfus debunked, he was finally acquitted in 1906.

== Bertillon system ==
The specific anthropological technique practiced by Alphonse Bertillon is often called the Bertillon system. This system consisted of five initial measurements — head length, head breadth, length of middle finger, length of the left foot, and length of the cubit. Along with these measurements, Bertillon used photography, now known as a mug shot, to complete this system of record. These methods of identification were combined into a system for law enforcement officials to access information and images quickly.

Although the system was based in scientific measures, it was known to have its flaws. For example, it may not have been able to accurately apply to children or women, as it was mostly designed for men who had reached full physical maturity and had short hair.

=== Alley workers in Minneapolis ===
In the late 19th and 20th centuries, black women who were working as prostitutes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, became known as &quot;alley workers&quot;. The Minneapolis Police Department followed the Bertillon system as a means to identify and document the crimes of these alley workers. The system soon became used as a tool to police and categorise these women.

In order to bypass the system, many black women would use aliases instead of their real names. The most common name that was used as an alias was &quot;Mamie&quot;, which was also the alias used by Mamie Knight, who was the only surviving photo of an alley worker during the department&#x27;s period of using the Bertillon system. Her photo is currently located in the St. Paul police department archives.

<text>Jacques Bertillon (11 November 1851 – 4 July 1922) was a French statistician and demographer.
Born in Paris, Bertillon was the son of statistician Louis Bertillon and the older brother of Alphonse Bertillon. He was educated as a physician but turned to statistical analysis. In 1880 he wrote &quot;La Statistique humaine en France&quot;. In 1891-93 he chaired a committee that introduced the Bertillon Classification of Causes of Death, which was adopted by several countries; it was the precursor to today&#x27;s International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD) which continues to be published by the World Health Organization. By comparing statistics from different European countries he discovered the correlation between suicide rates and divorces, claiming that both phenomena were associated with social disequilibrium, ideas influencing Émile Durkheim in his work &quot;Suicide&quot;.

Bertillon married the physician Caroline Schultze; they had two daughters.

He died in Paris on 4 July 1922. Anticipating his death, he prepared a letter to several newspaper editors which stated &quot;When you receive this I will no longer exist,&quot; and respectfully requested an obituary for himself.

<text>Juan Vucetich Kovacevich (born Ivan Vučetić; 20 July 1858 – 25 January 1925) was an Argentine - Croatian anthropologist and police official who pioneered the use of dactyloscopy (fingerprint identification).

== Biography ==
Vucetich was born in Hvar, Kingdom of Dalmatia, then part of the Austrian Empire, and immigrated to Argentina in 1884.

In 1891, he began the first filing of fingerprints based on ideas of Francis Galton, which he expanded significantly. He became the director of the Center for Dactyloscopy in Buenos Aires. At the time, he included the Bertillon system alongside the fingerprint files.

The first positive identification of a criminal was made in 1892, when Francisca Rojas killed her two children, then cut her own throat in an attempt to put the blame on an outside attacker. A bloody print identified her as the killer. Argentine police adopted Vucetich&#x27;s method of fingerprinting classification and it spread to police forces all over the world. Vucetich improved his method with new material; he published &quot;Dactiloscopía Comparada&quot; (&quot;Comparative Dactyloscopy&quot;) in 1904.

Vucetich died in Dolores, Buenos Aires.

== Legacy ==
The Buenos Aires Provincial Police academy near La Plata is named the Escuela de Policia Juan Vucetich; an eponymous police museum was also founded.

In Croatia, the Forensic Science Centre Ivan Vučetić in Zagreb also bears his name. The city of Pula has a memorial marker to commemorate his service in the Austro-Hungarian Navy while stationed there. There is a bust in his native Hvar. In 2023, a museum was opened in Hvar, named in his honor.

<text>The Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS) is a United States Space Force system intended to meet the United States&#x27; Department of Defense infrared space surveillance needs through the first two to three decades of the 21st century. The SBIRS program is designed to provide key capabilities in the areas of missile warning, missile defense, battlespace characterization and technical intelligence via satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO), sensors hosted on satellites in highly elliptical orbit (HEO), and ground-based data processing and control.

A total of twelve satellites carrying SBIRS or STSS payloads had been launched: SBIRS GEO-1 (USA-230, 2011), SBIRS GEO-2 (USA-241, 2013), SBIRS GEO-3 (USA-273, 2017), SBIRS GEO-4 (USA-282, 2018), SBIRS GEO-5 (USA-315, 2021), SBIRS GEO-6 (USA-336, 2022), SBIRS HEO-1 (USA-184, 2006), SBIRS HEO-2 (USA-200, 2008), SBIRS HEO-3 (USA-259, 2014), STSS-ATRR (USA-205, 2009), STSS Demo 1 (USA-208, 2009) and STSS Demo 2 (USA-209, 2009). The manufacturing contract for SBIRS GEO-5 and SBIRS GEO-6 was awarded in 2014. Funding for SBIRS GEO-7 and SBIRS GEO-8 was canceled in 2019.

==Background==
Based on its experiences with the launching of short-range theater missiles by Iraq during the 1991 Persian Gulf War, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) concluded that expanded theater missile warning capabilities were needed, and it began planning for an improved infrared satellite sensor capability that would support both long-range strategic and short-range theater ballistic missile warning and defense operations. In 1994, DoD studied consolidating various infrared space requirements, such as for ballistic missile warning and defense, technical intelligence, and battlespace characterization, and it selected SBIRS to replace and enhance the capabilities provided by the Defense Support Program (DSP). DSP satellites are built with infrared detectors that can sense missile plumes, and have been providing early warning for long-range ballistic missile launches for over 30 years. DoD had previously attempted to replace DSP with:
*the Advanced Warning System in the early 1980s
*the Boost Surveillance and Tracking System in the late 1980s
*the Follow-on Early Warning System in the early 1990s

According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), these attempts failed due to immature technology, high cost, and affordability issues. SBIRS is to use more sophisticated infrared technologies than the DSP to enhance the detection of strategic and theater ballistic missile launches and the performance of the missile-tracking function.

The original contract consisted of 2 SBIRS HEO satellite sensors and 2-3 SBIRS GEO sensors (and satellites) with an option to buy a total of 5 GEOs. A complement of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) was planned as part of the program (SBIRS-Low), but this has been moved into the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) program.

SBIRS continues to struggle with cost overruns, with Nunn-McCurdy breaches occurring in 2001 and 2005. By September 2007, the expected project cost had increased to US$10.4 billion. In December 2005, following the third SBIRS Nunn-McCurdy violation, the government decided to compete SBIRS GEO-4 and SBIRS GEO-5, with an option to buy the SBIRS GEO-3 contingent based on the performance of the first two.

On 2 June 2009, Lockheed Martin announced it had been awarded a contract for the third SBIRS HEO payload and the third SBIRS GEO satellite, and for associated ground equipment modifications. On 10 July 2009, Lockheed Martin was awarded US$262.5 million as down payment by the USAF towards the purchase of a fourth satellite. The first SBIRS GEO satellite of the SBIRS program, SBIRS GEO-1, was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral on an Atlas V launch vehicle on 7 May 2011. In June 2014, Lockheed Martin was contracted by the USAF to build SBIRS GEO-5 and SBIRS GEO-6, at a cost of US$1.86 billion.

The FY 2021 budget allocates US$2.5 billion to SBIRS for the United States Space Force.

==SBIRS High==

SBIRS High (also now simply referred to as &quot;SBIRS&quot;) is to consist of four dedicated satellites operating in geosynchronous Earth orbit, and sensors on two host satellites operating in a highly elliptical orbit. SBIRS High will replace the Defense Support Program (DSP) satellites and is intended primarily to provide enhanced strategic and theater ballistic missile warning capabilities. SBIRS High GEO 1 was launched on 7 May 2011. Two SBIRS sensors hosted on two classified satellites in highly elliptical orbit have already been launched, probably as part of the NROL-22 (USA 184) and NROL-28 (USA 200) launches in 2006 and 2008. USA 184 and USA 200 are believed by analysts to be ELINT satellites in the family of JUMPSEAT and TRUMPET; TRUMPET has been reported to have carried an infrared sensor called HERITAGE.

The prime contractor for SBIRS is Lockheed Martin, with Northrop Grumman as the major subcontractor. Lockheed Martin also provides the satellite for SBIRS GEO. The system&#x27;s expected deployment was delayed from December 2009 to 2011 because of problems with Lockheed&#x27;s workmanship on system components, including unresolved software malfunctions and several broken solder joints in a subcontract procured gyroscope assembly on the first spacecraft being built.

It was feared that a further launch postponement into late 2011 would lead to conflict with the planned launches of NASA&#x27;s Juno spacecraft and Mars Science Laboratory, which would all use the same launch facility. However, the first GEO launch, SBIRS GEO-1, was successfully conducted on 7 May 2011.

According to a Reuters report, the first two SBIRS GEO satellites started operations in 2013. SBIRS GEO-3 launched on 20 January 2017, and SBIRS GEO-4 was successfully deployed on 20 January 2018. In 2017, the United States Air Force requested US$1.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2018 for SBIRS, and funds for advance procurement of SBIRS 7 and 8. While US$643 million in funding was provided for SBIRS in Fiscal Year 2019, funding for SBIRS 7 and 8 was eliminated in favor of a new program, Next-Gen OPIR (Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared). Plans remained to launch SBIRS GEO-5 in 2021 and SBIRS GEO-6 in 2022. SBIRS GEO-5 was successfully launched on 18 May 2021, while SBIRS GEO-6 was successfully launched on 4 August 2022.

==SBIRS Low (Space Tracking and Surveillance System)==

The SBIRS Low contract is now managed by the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and has been renamed the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS).

===Original SBIRS Low===
The SBIRS Low program was originally expected to consist of about 24 satellites in low Earth orbit. The primary purpose of SBIRS Low was the tracking of ballistic missiles; with discrimination between warheads and other objects, such as decoys, that separate from the missile bodies throughout the middle portion of their flights. The system was to have two major sensors, coordinated by an on-board computer:
*a scanning infrared sensor, designed to acquire ballistic missiles in the early stages of flight, and
*a tracking infrared sensor, designed to follow missiles, warheads, and other objects such as debris and decoys during the middle and later stages of flight. The tracking sensor would be cooled to very low temperatures.

SBIRS Low&#x27;s original deployment schedule was 2010, the date when its capabilities were said to be needed by the National Missile Defense System.

===Space Tracking and Surveillance System===

In 2001, the Missile Defense Agency assessed the programs needed for a national ballistic missile defense system (BMDS) and found that they were lacking in the relatively new arena of space. The MDA decided to absorb the SBIRS Low constellation in its very early stages of development and renamed the program the Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS). This transition changed the direction of the program somewhat, but the overall mission remained the same — detection and tracking of ballistic missiles through all phases of flight.

<text>Jules René Lucien Belbenoît (; 4 April 1899 – 25 February 1959) was a French prisoner on Devil&#x27;s Island who successfully escaped to the United States. He later published the memoirs, &quot;Dry Guillotine&quot; (1938) and &quot;Hell on Trial&quot; (1940), about his exploits.

==Early life==
René Belbenoît was born on April 4, 1899, in Paris.

During his childhood, in the 1900s, Belbenoît was abandoned by his mother, Louise Daumière, while she was working as a teacher for the children of the Czar of Russia. Belbenoît&#x27;s father, Louis Belbenoît, who worked as the conductor of the Paris-Orleans Express, was rarely at home and could not raise the young René himself. Belbenoît was then sent to live with his grandparents.

== Scams, burglaries and thefts ==
Between 1920 and 1921, Belbenoît committed several scams, burglaries and shoplifting offences. Belbenoît committed various crimes in Tours, Saint-Nazaire, Chartres, in company with people whom he had come to know in the past. As he defrauded, burgled, and robbed people — these events taking place over a year — Belbenoît accumulated a large number of victims. Belbenoît had no particular criteria for the victims.
In June 1921, Belbenoît began working in a restaurant in Besançon as a dishwasher for eight francs a day along with room and board. After having worked there for only 11 days, Belbenoît stole a wallet containing 4,000 francs, then a motor scooter that he used to leave Besançon, and moved to Nantes. When he arrived in Nantes, Belbenoît was out of work, but soon began work as a valet at the Ben Ali Castle, property of the Comtesse d&#x27;Entremeuse. Despite the benevolence of his employer, Belbenoît only worked for one month at the castle. In August 1921, while working at Ben Ali Castle, Belbenoît took advantage of the monument to steal the pearls of the Comtesse d&#x27;Entremeuse as well as some money from her dressing table. Belbenoît escaped directly and found refuge on a train to Paris. He finally went to Dijon, after only two days in Paris.

On August 18, 1921, Belbenoît was hired as a waiter in a restaurant located in Dijon. The next day, he broke into the room containing his boss&#x27;s office and stole 2,800 francs from the cash box, then fled to Paris by train. Arriving in Paris, Belbenoît sent a letter to his boss and thanked her for the 2,800 francs. The boss lodged a complaint and the police managed to go back to the bank of Paris, using the stamp inscribed on the letter, then managed to identify the person who posted this letter as René Belbenoît, 22, wanted by the police in Tours, Saint-Nazaire, Chartres, Nantes and Besançon.

== Arrest and trial ==
René Belbenoît was arrested in Paris on August 21, 1921, and placed in pre-trial detention. While in prison, after a first indictment for the theft from the restaurant in Dijon, Belbenoît was also charged with the multiple thefts, scams and frauds for which he was wanted. Although the acts committed by Belbenoît were misdemeanors, the young man was sent back to the Dijon Assize Court, on grounds that he was in a state of recidivism as a repeat offender.

Belbenoît appeared on May 22, 1922, before the Dijon Assize Court for the acts of fraud, burglary and shoplifting committed in Tours, Saint-Nazaire, Chartres, Besançon, Nantes and Dijon. At age 23, Belbenoît already had a heavy past behind him that did not incline to indulgence. Moreover, during the trial, Belbenoît behaved stoically, showing no remorse and was haughty. The Assize Court also considered that Belbenoît was far from being in a position to mend his ways because of his recidivism. Found guilty, Belbenoît was sentenced to 8 years of forced labor in the penal colony of French Guiana. By virtue of the &quot;doubling&quot;, this sentence meant that after completing the sentence of forced labor, the convicted person was required to stay in French Guiana for a time equal to his sentence before being able to return to mainland France.

Contesting his conviction, which forced him to stay in French Guiana until his death (even after his release), Belbenoît filed an appeal in cassation but the Court of Cassation dismissed the appeal a few months later. Belbenoît was placed, in January 1923, the prison of Saint-Martin-de-Ré while waiting to serve his prison sentence in French Guiana. On the morning of June 7, 1923, Belbenoît left the Saint-Martin-de-Ré prison of aboard the freighter Le Martinière. The journey lasted 14 days during which all the prisoners condemned to the Bagne – killers and thieves – were transported and some of them killed other freed inmates during the journey.

==Imprisonment==
René Belbenoît landed on June 21, 1923, in the penal colony of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni with the status of &quot;transported&quot;. Aged only 24, Belbenoît offered a first escape plan to one of his fellow prisoners, Léonce, who accepted his proposal, also seeking to escape. Despite the warnings of more experienced prisoners, the two convicts then prepared provisions and a raft to ensure their escape. On August 14, 1923, Belbenoît attempted a first escape along with Léonce. They embarked on a raft, but the current of the sea being relatively strong, the two convicts ran aground a few kilometers further down the French shore. They spent the night there in traumatic circumstances, as he would later explain in his memoir, &quot;Dry Guillotine&quot;. The next morning, René and Léonce got back on their raft and managed to reach Dutch Guiana. They arrived on the shore but, forced to walk through the jungle, René and Léonce were surrounded by a troop of Indians, who brought them back to the penal colony of Saint-Laurent-du-Maroni. The two convicts were sent to the mitard du Bagne, a place for other prisoners who had tried to escape, and where it was common for one prisoner to kill another. Belbenoît nevertheless escaped death. After leaving the mitard, Belbenoît, still a convict in Cayenne, became a nurse in the prison and prepared a new escape plan.

On November 18, 1924, around 9 p.m., Belbenoît escaped again, in the company of a gang of seven other &quot;tough guys&quot;: &quot;Lulu&quot;, &quot;Gipsy&quot;, &quot;Jojo&quot; (Gipsy&#x27;s companion), &quot;Le Basque&quot;, and three other convicts. The next morning, the escapees were blown off course by the wind towards the Dutch Guianan coast. Following this, &quot;Le Basque&quot; (one of the escapees), calling himself &quot;connaisseur&quot;, convinced the group to tie cords to the canoe.The rope broke in heavy waves, carrying away the provisions. The rest of the troupe, being furious, stabbed &quot;Le Basque&quot; in the heart on the order of &quot;Lulu&quot;. A few days later, after a long journey, &quot;Gipsy&quot; killed &quot;Jojo&quot; with a saber in order to rob him. Following the discovery of &quot;Jojo&#x27;s&quot; body by the other escapees, &quot;Lulu&quot; stabbed &quot;Gipsy&quot; and disembowelled him, before the five surviving members ate his remains. The next day, the troop resumed their march towards Dutch Guiana, before being surrounded by Indians, who brought the band back to the Bagne de Cayenne. Belbenoît&#x27;s sentence was increased by six months, while the other surviving escapees had a year added to their sentences. Belbenoît would later admit in his book that he &quot;was no longer himself&quot;, after several days of the escapade, starvation and the journey.

Following his return to Bagne de Cayenne, René Belbenoît signed a petition to protest against the conditions of detention. The revolts of Belbenoît annoyed the administration of the Bagne, which led to his being placed under the surveillance of the prison guards in 1925 and 1926, news which aroused a lively debate among journalists on the subject. In July and August 1927, a British journalist, having interviewed Belbenoît, published press articles on the daily life of the convicts of Cayenne. Following this, Belbenoît, now 28, attempted two new escapes, but these did not succeed and he saw his sentence increased by 13 months from his conviction, now at nine years and one month of forced labor instead of the 8 years of forced labor to which he had been sentenced.

== Release and recidive ==
René Belbenoît was released from the Bagne de Cayenne on September 21, 1930, after serving his nine years in prison. Before the Warden Siadous was transferred back to France, he gave Belbenoît a one-year permit to leave the penal colony. Belbenoît spent most of this year working in the Panama Canal Zone as a gardener. However, with the one year permit soon to expire, he decided to go back to France in order to argue his case. In November 1931, longing to return to Paris, Belbenoît decided to embark on a boat leading to Le Havre, but was stopped when he arrived at his destination. Belbenoît was charged with violation of his parole and the conditions of his release, and he returned to prison while awaiting trial. On October 14, 1933, Belbenoît was sentenced to three years of additional forced labor for his clandestine return to France. He was sent back to French Guiana&#x27;s Bagne de Cayenne on the same freighter as Henri Charrière, known as &quot;Papillon&quot;.

==Release, escape and success of &quot;Dry Guillotine&quot;==
On November 2, 1934, Belbenoît was officially released, but that just meant he became a &quot;libéré&quot;, a free prisoner who was still not allowed to return to France. He made a living by capturing and selling butterflies and making items out of natural rubber and selling them. During the years of his imprisonment he had lost all his teeth. Belbenoît planned yet another escape from French Guiana. He met five other convicts, nicknamed &quot;Bébère&quot;, &quot;Dadar&quot;, &quot;Cap&quot;, &quot;Panama&quot; and &quot;Chiflot&quot;, who are also forced to stay in French Guiana until the end of their lives. On May 2, 1935, Belbenoît and his gang escaped from the colony by sea. The six escapees traveled for seventeen days in a 19-foot boat and then reached Trinidad, where the English entrusted them with a sinking trawler. The escapees could stay on the island for three weeks and were given new supplies, and even a new boat. On June 10, they continued their trip. Sixteen days later they ran aground on a beach in Colombia, and locals stole their clothing. They reached Santa Marta, Colombia, where a local general fed them, but he also notified the French consul and took them to the local military prison. However, some of the local authorities separated Belbenoît from the others and, with the cooperation of local prison authorities, a sympathetic local newspaperman helped him to escape in April 1936 in exchange for writing about prison conditions. Belbenoît traveled slowly north and stole a number of native canoes to continue his journey. 

In Panama he spent about seven months with the Kuna tribe and later sold a large collection of butterflies in Panama City. There he also met Preston Rambo, who worked to translate his manuscript into English. In La Libertad, El Salvador, he hid in a ship that took him to Los Angeles in March 1937. In 1938, Belbenoit&#x27;s memoir of his imprisonment, &quot;Dry Guillotine&quot;, was published in United States with an introduction by the prominent South American explorer and journalist William LaVarre. The best-selling memoir went through 14 printings in less than a year.

&quot;Dry Guillotine&quot; attracted the attention of the U.S. immigration authorities, and Belbenoît was arrested. He received a visitor&#x27;s visa, but was told to leave the U.S. in 1941. Belbenoît then traveled to Mexico, and tried to slip back into the United States a year later. However, he was arrested in Brownsville, Texas, and sentenced to 15 months in prison. After his release, Belbenoît acquired a valid passport and went to Los Angeles to work for Warner Bros. as a technical advisor for the film &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944).

In 1951, Belbenoît moved to Lucerne Valley, California, and founded René&#x27;s Ranch Store, where he also lived. Neighbors knew who he was. His new book, &quot;Hell on Trial&quot;, again attracted the attention of immigration authorities, and in May 1951 he was summoned to Los Angeles. His former movie co-workers from &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; spoke on his behalf, and he received U.S. citizenship in 1956.

==Personal life==
Belbenoît married Lee Gumpert, a widow who had one son, William Gumpert.

==Death==
Belbenoît died of cardiac arrest at his store in Lucerne Valley on February 26, 1959, aged 59.

<text>Spion Kop (or the Kop for short) is a colloquial name or term for a number of single-tier terraces and stands at sports stadiums, particularly in the United Kingdom. The steep nature resembles the Spion Kop, a hill near Ladysmith, South Africa, which was the scene of the Battle of Spion Kop in January 1900 during the Second Boer War.

== History ==
The first recorded reference to a sports terrace as &quot;Kop&quot; related to Woolwich Arsenal&#x27;s Manor Ground in 1904, four years after the Second Boer War. A local newsman likened the silhouette of fans standing on a newly raised bank of earth to soldiers standing atop the hill at the Battle of Spion Kop. Two years later in 1906, &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot; sports editor Ernest Edwards noted of a new open-air embankment at Anfield: 
The use of the name for the stand was given recognition at Anfield in 1928 when it was extended to a 27,000 capacity and a cantilever roof was added which amplified the roar of the crowd to create an intense atmosphere. Traditionally, Liverpool&#x27;s most vocal supporters congregate in this stand and are referred to as &quot;kopites&quot;. Such is the reputation of the stand that it was claimed that the crowd in the Kop could suck the ball into the goal and it has become one of the most famous football stands in the world.

Liverpool&#x27;s Spion Kop (capacity 27,000, although crowds of 30,000+ have been recorded) was redesigned in 1994 (completed) to comply with requirements of the Taylor Report, which made all-seater stadiums obligatory in the highest two divisions of English football. A new Spion Kop was built in its place with 12,390 seats, making it the largest single-tier stand in the country at the time. This new Kop still stands and currently houses the club&#x27;s museum.
Following the opening of the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Anfield&#x27;s Kop ceased to be the largest single-tier stand in the country. The South Stand of the new stadium has 17,500 seats and has an incline of 34 degrees, making it one of the steepest stands in the country.

Manchester United&#x27;s proposed new 100,000-capacity Old Trafford stadium will reportedly take inspiration from Tottenham&#x27;s South Stand with a &#x27;new Stretford End&#x27; to be a single-tier, steep stand which, due to the overall ground&#x27;s significantly higher capacity, would likely house 25,000 supporters, indeed a stadium designed to the same proportions but with a 100,000 capacity would actually see this &#x27;new Stretford End&#x27; holding as many as 29,000.

Villa Park&#x27;s old Holte End was historically the largest of all Kop ends, closely followed by the old South Bank at Molineux, both once regularly holding crowds in excess of 30,000.

Many other English football clubs and some rugby league clubs (such as Wigan&#x27;s former home Central Park) applied the same name to stands in later years.

== Composition ==
There is much debate about what type of stand constitutes a Kop. The size and location of the stand in the stadium varies; most are located behind the goal and are occupied by its club&#x27;s most vocal supporters. It is usually a single-tiered stand and was traditionally terraced. In England, safety regulations brought into effect after the 1989 Hillsborough disaster required many to be made all-seated. A Kop is not necessarily the largest stand in the stadium and does not have to have a particularly large capacity; for example, Chesterfield&#x27;s former stadium, Saltergate, had a Kop with a capacity of only a few thousand.

<doc id="934136" wikidata="Q5467695" url="?curid=934136" title="Ford Cologne V6 engine">
<text>The Ford Cologne V6 is a series of 60° cast iron block V6 engines produced by the Ford Motor Company from 1962 to 2011 in displacements between and . Originally, the Cologne V6 was installed in vehicles intended for Germany and Continental Europe, while the unrelated British Essex V6 was used in cars for the British market. Later, the Cologne V6 largely replaced the Essex V6 for British-market vehicles. These engines were also used in the United States, especially in compact trucks.

During its production run the Cologne V6 was offered in displacements of 1.8, 2.0, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, and 4.0 litres. All except the Cosworth 24v derivative and later 4.0 litre SOHC engines were pushrod overhead-valve engines, with a single camshaft between the banks.

The Cologne V6 was designed to be compatible in installation with the Ford Taunus V4 engine, having the same transmission bolt pattern, the same engine mounts, and in many versions, a cylinder head featuring &quot;siamesed&quot; exhaust passages, which reduced the three exhaust outlets down to two on each side. The latter feature was great for compatibility, but poor for performance. The 2.4, 2.8 (in U.S.), 2.9, and 4.0 had three exhaust ports, making them preferable.

The engine was available in both carburetted and fuel-injected forms.

==1.8==
The smallest version of the V6 was the with a bore and stroke. Its output is and . Its only application was the Ford 17M P7 from 1968 to 1971.

==2.0==
The original displacement of the V6 was with a bore and stroke. Output is and or and .

Applications:
* 1964–1967 Ford Taunus 20M (P5)

==2.4==

The was used only in Europe. Like the 2.9 L version, the camshaft is chain-driven, it has fuel injection system (EFI) and Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine management. Bore and stroke is . Power output is at 5800 rpm and torque at 3500 rpm.

Applications:
* Ford Scorpio/Granada III

==2.6==

The largest first-generation V6 was the introduced in 1969. It had a bore and stroke. Output was and .

Applications:
* 1969–1971 Ford 20M RS
* 1969–1971 Ford 26M
* 1970–1974 Ford Capri (Not available on UK models)
* 1972–1977 Ford Granada (Not available on UK models)

==2.6 RS==
The 2.6 RS was a special high-performance fuel-injected version. It had a bore and stroke, and produced and . 

The only fuel injected first-generation engine, its sole application was the 1970-1973 Ford Capri RS 2600. It was replaced with the RS 3100. Weslake developed a racing version of the engine, bored to to give of displacement and producing in excess of .
* Ford Capri 2600 RS from 1970 to 1973

== 2.8==
The second-generation Cologne V6 was introduced in 1974. It displaced with a bore and stroke of , and used a geared camshaft design. While based on the 2.6, the larger bore necessitated a different block. The European version used a &quot;siamesed&quot; two-port exhaust manifold, similar to the one used on the V4, while the American version used three-port heads. The European approach was useful in that existing cars with the V4 engine could be upgraded with relative ease. Output was rated at for the US market and for the European market, depending on the model.

In Europe, the 2.8 was produced with carburetor , mechanical fuel injection (Bosch K-Jetronic, , and electronic injection (Ford EEC-IV, ). Electronic injection only featured on the 2.8 Granada models for one year before being replaced with the 2.9 unit.

Tuning options are very limited with the Bosch K-Jetronic models. The siamesed inlet and exhaust ports of the 2.8 only respond well to forced induction or an overbore; normal tuning will yield only minor power results. The MFI 2.8 Cologne (Capri/Sierra 2.8i) uses a very restricted induction setup, and no open air kit is available due to this.

Ford offered a limited run of approximately 150 &quot;Capri turbos&quot; with turbocharged 2.8 engines. These engines displayed RS badging and used a productionized version of an existing aftermarket kit offered by a Ford dealer in Germany.

TVR Tasmin/280i used the Cologne 2.8 with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection, as did the early TVR &#x27;S&#x27; series in 2.8 and revised 2.9 efi injection form.

Applications:
* TVR 280i/Tasmin
* TVR S1
* Ford Ranger
* Ford Bronco II
* Ford Aerostar
* Ford Pinto
* Mercury Bobcat
* Mercury Capri
* Ford Mustang II
* Ford Mustang (Gen 3 1979)
* Ford Granada
* Ford Capri III
* Ford Sierra XR4x4 and XR4i
* Ford Scorpio
* Bandvagn 206
* Reliant Scimitar (1979 onwards)
* Panther Kallista

==2.9==
The 2.9 L shares the same basic design as the 2.8 L model, bar a few subtle differences. The camshaft is chain-driven rather than gear driven, so it rotates in the same direction as the crankshaft. The arrangement of the exhaust valves is different, eliminating the &quot;hot-spot&quot; that existed on the 2.8 L model. The cylinder heads also sport a more conventional three-port exhaust manifold. Output was rated at at 4600 rpm and at 2600 rpm for the light trucks (1986–92 Ranger and 1986–90 Bronco II) and at 4800 rpm for the Merkur Scorpio in the US market and for the European market. Bore and stroke was for a total displacement of .

In Europe, this engine was commonly fitted with the Bosch L-Jetronic fuel-injection system, married to Ford&#x27;s EEC-IV engine management. Because of this difference over the 2.8 L model, this version was a more popular candidate for aftermarket modification (typically turbocharging) from companies such as Janspeed and Turbo Technics.

Applications:
* TVR S2/S3(C)/S4C
* Ford Bronco II
* Ford Ranger
* Ford Sierra XR 4X4, Ghia 4x4 Estate
* Ford Granada
* Ford Scorpio
* Ford Transit
* Merkur Scorpio
* Panther Kallista
* Middlebridge Scimitar GTE

===2.9 Cosworth===
A special twin DOHC (QUAD CAM) version of the 2.9 was created by Cosworth Engineering in 1991. Although it shared the same block as the standard 2.9, power output was up to and torque was boosted to at 4500 rpm. This engine (code BOA) was used in the Ford Scorpio Cosworth 24V. This engine configuration was only paired with an improved A4LDe automatic gearbox with partial electronic shift control. No manual gearbox was offered from the factory.

The standard Ford-issued block was machined differently to improve strength. In place of the single-cam arrangement, an endless duplex hydraulically tensioned timing chain was used to drive the overhead cams. The chain measured . The casting and bearings for the standard underhead cam were repurposed for a shaft which drove the oil pump. Ignition was controlled by an EDIS-6 system, which would become a standard feature.

The engine was known for its substantial increase in power delivery above 4000 rpm relative to the unmodified version; in recent years, the engine has become a popular choice as a replacement engine for the Ford Sierra XR4x4 and XR4i.

An improved version of this engine (code BOB) was available in the restyled 1995 Ford Scorpio. Differences included two simplex chains with two hydraulic tensioners and the addition of a variable-length intake system called VIS. Power output was increased to . This was mated to a fully electronically controlled A4LDE automatic transmission.

==4.0==
The pushrod , with a bore and stroke version, although produced in Cologne, Germany, was only fitted to American vehicles. The OHV engine was produced until 2000 and was used in the Ford Explorer, Ford Aerostar, Mazda B4000, and Ford Ranger. Output was and . Though some variation exists, typically is quoted as horsepower for 1990–92 applications.

Applications:
* Ford Ranger/Mazda B-Series
* Ford Explorer/Mazda Navajo
* Cross Lander 244X
* Ford Aerostar (1990–1997)

===SOHC===

The SOHC version was introduced in 1997 in the Ford Explorer, alongside the original pushrod version. It features a variable length intake manifold and produces and f. (The variable length intake manifold was discontinued in 1998, replaced by a standard intake.) It uses a jackshaft in place of a camshaft to drive a timing chain to each cylinder head. Three timing chains are used, one from the crank to the jackshaft, one in the front of the engine to drive the cam for the left bank, and one on the back of the engine to drive the cam for the right bank. In addition, the 4WD Ranger/Explorer with the SOHC 4.0 had a 4th timing chain driving what Ford called a balance shaft. Ford has since phased out the engine in favor of the more powerful and efficient Duratec 37.

==== Timing chain problems ====

The 4.0 SOHC engine was notorious for the OEM timing chain guides and tensioners breaking, resulting in timing chain rattle or &quot;death rattle&quot;. This problem can occur as early as in some vehicles. Due to the SOHC engine&#x27;s unique design involving both front and rear timing chains, the repair of the timing guides would often require complete engine removal depending on the severity of the problem. When the engine is run for an extended period of time with this issue the engine can jump timing, damaging the heads and valves.

Timing chain rattle was mitigated in later years of the SOHC (in most vehicles, after 2002) with updated cassettes and tensioners. This problem occurs with varying frequency among some Ford vehicles equipped with the SOHC engine including the Ford Mustang, Ford Explorer, and Ford Ranger. The 4.0 OHV was not affected by this issue.

====Other versions====

A version of the engine is used in the Land Rover Discovery 3 / LR3 in Australia/North America and Ford Courier in Australia, producing and of torque at 3,000 rpm for the Land Rover version. The Ford Courier version produces of power and of torque. The Land Rover version of the engine became unavailable in the United States for the 2008 model year.

Applications:
* 2001–2012 Ford Ranger
* 2001–2010 Mazda B4000
* 1997–2010 Ford Explorer/Mercury Mountaineer
* 2004–2006 Ford Courier
* 2005–2010 Ford Mustang
* 2005–2009 Land Rover Discovery 3 / LR3 The Land Rover version of the cast iron engine block has different motor mount castings/machined surfaces for the motor mounts and the left mount engine knock sensor, plus the engine girdle (upper oil pan) has a threaded hole drilled and tapped for an engine oil temperature sensor.

<text>Gaetano Badalamenti (; 14 September 1923 – 29 April 2004) was a powerful member of the Sicilian Mafia. &quot;Don Tano&quot; Badalamenti was the capofamiglia of his hometown Cinisi, Sicily, and headed the Sicilian Mafia Commission in the 1970s. In 1987, he was sentenced in the United States to 45 years in federal prison for being one of the leaders in the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot;, a $1.65 billion drug-trafficking ring that used pizzerias as fronts to distribute heroin from 1975 to 1984. He was also sentenced in Italy to life imprisonment in 2002 for the 1978 murder of Peppino Impastato.

==Early years==
Tano Badalamenti was the youngest of a family with five boys and four girls. His family owned a dairy farm in Cinisi. He had minimal schooling, attending school for only four years, before he was put to work as a field hand at age ten. In 1941, he was conscripted into the Royal Italian Army and deserted during the Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. His elder brother Emanuele Badalamenti had moved to the United States and operated a supermarket and gas station in Monroe, Michigan. In 1946 Gaetano was named in an arrest warrant on charges of conspiracy and kidnapping. In 1947 he was charged with murder as well, and he fled to his brother Emanuele in the US. Badalamenti was arrested in 1950 and deported back to Italy. He married Theresa Vitale (her sister was married to Filippo Rimi, the capomafia of Alcamo) and set up a business on the family land as a lemon grower. His judicial difficulties were all resolved because of insufficient evidence.

Badalamenti founded a successful construction business that supplied the crushed rock for Palermo&#x27;s Punta Raisi Airport which fell within the Cinisi family&#x27;s sphere of influence. In the early 1960s, he successfully bribed officials to have the airport built near his hometown, despite its inconvenient geographical position. The construction needed supplies of rock and gravel, which were available in large quantities on the family property. His two construction firms, a concrete plant and a fleet of trucks provided much needed employment for the townsfolk and enriched Badalamenti.

==Capomafia of Cinisi==
Badalamenti assumed leadership of the Mafia in Cinisi in 1963 after a car bomb killed Cesare Manzella during the First Mafia War. The Ciaculli Massacre on 30 June 1963 – when seven police and military officers sent to defuse a car bomb intended for mafioso Salvatore Greco were killed – changed the Mafia War into a war against the Mafia. It prompted the first concerted anti-mafia efforts by the state in post-war Italy. Within a period of ten weeks 1,200 mafiosi were arrested, many of whom would be kept out of circulation for five or six years. The Sicilian Mafia Commission was dissolved.

Badalamenti had complete control in Cinisi. &quot;It seemed that Badalamenti was well liked by the Carabinieri as he was calm, reliable, and always liked a chat. It almost felt like he was doing them a favour in that nothing ever happened in Cinisi, it was a quiet little town.&quot; and &quot;I often used to see them walking arm in arm with Tano Badalamenti and his henchmen. You can&#x27;t have faith in the institutions when you see the police arm in arm with mafiosi&quot;, according to Giovanni Impastato – the brother of murdered anti-mafia activist Giuseppe Impastato – in his declaration before the Italian Antimafia Commission.

==Pizza connection==
Gaetano Badalamenti would become one of the major heroin traffickers of the Sicilian Mafia. From 1975 to 1984, he was one of the main ringleaders of a US$1.65 billion heroin trafficking operation, known as the Pizza Connection, that imported heroin from the Middle East and distributed the drugs through U.S. mid-western pizzeria store fronts. In 1951, the American police identified a 50 kilogram shipment of heroin to Badalamenti who was then living in Detroit as an illegal immigrant. However, in the 1950s most money was made by smuggling foreign cigarettes into Italy. In 1953 Badalamenti was arrested for cigarette smuggling in Italy for the first time. In 1957 he was caught again with 3,000 kilograms of foreign-made cigarettes. The repression caused by the Ciaculli Massacre disrupted the Sicilian heroin trade to the United States. Mafiosi were banned, arrested and incarcerated. Control of the trade fell into the hands of a few fugitives: the cousins Salvatore &quot;Ciaschiteddu&quot; Greco and Salvatore Greco, also known as &quot;l&#x27;ingegnere&quot;, Pietro Davì, Tommaso Buscetta and Gaetano Badalamenti.

In 1970, the Sicilian Mafia Commission was revived. It consisted of ten members but was initially ruled by a triumvirate consisting of Gaetano Badalamenti, Stefano Bontade and the Corleonesi boss Luciano Leggio, although it was Salvatore Riina who would actually represent the Corleonesi. One of the first issue that had to be confronted was an offer of Prince Junio Valerio Borghese who asked for support for his plans for a neofascist coup in return for a pardon of convicted mobsters like Vincenzo Rimi and Luciano Leggio. Giuseppe Calderone and Di Cristina went to visit Borghese in Rome. Badalamenti opposed the plan. However, the Golpe Borghese fizzled out in the night of 8 December 1970.

In 1974 the full Commission was reconstituted under the leadership of Badalamenti. The Commission was meant to settle disputes and keep the peace, but Salvatore Riina, was plotting to decimate the Palermo clans. After 1975, Badalamenti joined forces with Salvatore Catalano of the Sicilian faction in the Bonanno family in New York and was involved with the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; case, where the mafia smuggled millions worth of heroin and cocaine to the United States using mafia-owned pizzerias as distribution points. In January 1978, the old and ailing former head of the Commission Salvatore &quot;Ciaschiteddu&quot; Greco came all the way from Venezuela to try to restrain Badalamenti, Giuseppe Di Cristina and Giuseppe Calderone from retaliating against the growing power of the Corleonesi. Di Cristina and Badalamenti wanted to kill Francesco Madonia, the boss of Vallelunga Mafia family and an ally of the Corleonesi in the province of Caltanissetta. Greco tried to convince them not to go ahead and offered Di Cristina to emigrate to Venezuela. Nevertheless, Badalamenti and Di Cristina decided to go on and on 8 April 1978, Francesco Madonia was murdered. In retaliation, Di Cristina was killed in May 1978 by the Corleonesi. Next was Giuseppe Calderone, who was killed on 8 September 1978. Later in 1978, Gaetano Badalamenti was expelled from the Commission, and Michele Greco replaced him.

Badalamenti was replaced as head of the Cinisi Mafia family by his cousin Antonio Badalamenti. He fled to Brazil through Spain and settled in São Paulo. In 1984, again through telephone interceptions, the FBI discovered that Badalamenti had planned a meeting in Madrid with his nephew Pietro &quot;Pete&quot; Alfano, owner of a pizzeria in Oregon, Illinois, and considered him the &quot;main point of contact in the United States&quot; for heroin trafficking. On 8 April 1984, in Madrid, Spain, the agents of the FBI and those of the Italian and Spanish police arrested Badalamenti and his son Vito Badalamenti together with Pietro Alfano; on 15 November, they were extradited to the United States. In 1985, Badalamenti, and over a dozen other defendants were on trial in New York, in what became known as the &quot;Pizza Connection&quot; case. The trial lasted about 17 months, the longest in the judicial history of the United States, ending on 2 March 1987 with a conviction for Badalamenti and Salvatore Catalano, who were each sentenced to 45 years in prison on 22 June 1987. Only his son Vito was released after being acquitted. Gaetano Badalamenti was also fined $125,000, and since he was extradited from Spain with the provision that he serve no more than 30 years, he was ordered to be released after 30 years should he live that long.

==Political contacts and murder charge==
Italy&#x27;s highest court, the Court of Cassation, ruled in October 2004 that former Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti had &quot;friendly and even direct ties&quot; with top men in the moderate wing of Cosa Nostra, Gaetano Badalamenti and Stefano Bontade, favored by the connection between them and Salvo Lima through the Salvo cousins. According to investigating magistrates Andreotti also commissioned the Mafia to kill the journalist Mino Pecorelli, managing editor of a magazine &quot;&quot; (OP). The murder took place on 20 March 1979. On 6 April 1993, Mafia turncoat Tommaso Buscetta told Palermo prosecutors that he had learnt from his boss Badalamenti that Pecorelli&#x27;s murder had been carried out in the interest of Andreotti. The Salvo cousins, two powerful Sicilian politicians with deep ties to local Mafia families, were also involved in the murder. Buscetta testified that Gaetano Badalamenti told him that the murder had been commissioned by the Salvo cousins as a favor to Andreotti. Andreotti was allegedly afraid that Pecorelli was about to publish information that could have destroyed his political career. Among the information was the complete memorial of Aldo Moro, which would be published only in 1990 and which Pecorelli had shown to General Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa before his death.

Dalla Chiesa was assassinated by Mafia in September 1982. Andreotti was acquitted along with his co-defendants in 1999. Local prosecutors successfully appealed the acquittal and there was a retrial, which in 2002 convicted Andreotti and sentenced him to 24 years imprisonment. Italians of all political allegiances denounced the conviction. Many failed to understand how the court could convict Andreotti of orchestrating the killing, yet acquit his co-accused, who supposedly had carried out his orders by setting up and committing the murder. The Italian supreme court definitively acquitted Andreotti of the murder in 2003. In April 2002, an Italian court convicted Badalamenti of the 1978 murder of activist radio broadcaster Peppino Impastato and sentenced him to life imprisonment. Impastato used humor and satire as his weapon against the Mafia. In his popular daily radio program &quot;Onda pazza&quot; (Crazy Wave) he mocked politicians and mafiosi alike. On a daily basis he exposed the crimes and dealings of mafiosi in &quot;Mafiopoli&quot; (Cinisi) and the activities of &quot;Tano Seduto&quot; (Sitting Tano), a thinly disguised pseudonym of Don Tano Badalamenti, the capomafia of Cinisi.

==Death==
On 29 April 2004, Badalamenti died from heart failure, at the age of 80, at the Devens Federal Medical Center in Ayer, Massachusetts. Ralph Blumenthal, a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter, depicted Badalamenti as &quot;a manipulator who would do anything to regain leadership of the Sicilian mob&quot; in his 1988 book, &quot;Last Days of the Sicilians&quot;. Shana Alexander, portrayed him as &quot;a man of unusual dignity&quot; in her book &quot;The Pizza Connection&quot;, published the same year.

<text>In early modern Europe, particularly in Germany, a court Jew (, ) or court factor (, ) was a Jewish banker who handled the finances of, or lent money to, royalty and nobility. In return for their services, court Jews gained social privileges, including, in some cases, being granted noble status.

Examples of what would be later called court Jews emerged in the High Middle Ages when the royalty, the nobility, and the church borrowed money from money changers or employed them as financiers. Among the most notable of these were Aaron of Lincoln and Vivelin of Strasbourg. Jewish financiers could use their family connections to provide their sponsors with finance, food, arms, ammunition, gold and other precious metals.

The rise of the absolute monarchies in Central Europe brought many Jews, mostly of Ashkenazi origin, into the position of negotiating loans for the various courts. They could amass personal fortunes and gain political and social influence. However, the court Jew had social connections and influence in the Christian world mainly through the Christian nobility and church. Due to the precarious position of Jews, some nobles could ignore their debts. If the sponsoring noble died, his Jewish financier could face exile or execution. The most famous example of this occurred in Württemberg in 1737–1738, when, after the death of his sponsor Charles Alexander, Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was put on trial and executed. In an effort to avoid such fate, some court bankers in the late 18th century — including Samuel Bleichröder, Mayer Amschel Rothschild, and Aron Elias Seligmann — successfully detached their businesses from these courts and established what eventually developed into full-fledged banks.

== Background ==

Prohibited from nearly every other trade, some Jews began to occupy an economic niche as moneylenders in the Middle Ages. While the Church condemned usury universally, canon law applied only to Christians, meaning that Jews were allowed to lend money at interest. Eventually, a sizable sector of the Jewish community were engaged in financial occupations, and the community was a financially highly successful part of the medieval economy. The religious restrictions on moneylending had inadvertently created a source of monopoly rents, causing profits associated with moneylending to be higher than they otherwise would have been. By most parameters, the standard of living of the Jewish community in early medieval period was at least equal to that of the lower nobility. However, despite this economic prosperity, the community was not safe: religious hostility manifested itself in the form of massacres and expulsions, culminating in repeated expulsions of all Jews from various parts of Western Europe in the late medieval period.

Although the phenomenon of &quot;Court Jewry&quot; did not occur until the early 17th century, there are some earlier examples of Jewish moneylenders who accumulated enough capital to finance the nobility. Among them was Josce of Gloucester, who financed Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s conquest of Ireland in 1170; and Aaron of Lincoln, &quot;probably the wealthiest person in England,&quot; who left an estate of about £100,000. Also notable was Vivelin of Strasbourg, who in 1339 — just prior to the Hundred Years&#x27; War — lent 340,000 florins to Edward III of England. By the 16th century, Jewish financiers had become increasingly connected to rulers and courts. of Frankfurt (d. 1572), also known as &quot;Jud Joseph zum Goldenen Schwan&quot;, became the most important Jewish businessman of his era, trading not only with the Fuggers and Imhoffs, but also with the nobility and the Church. In the early 17th century the Habsburgs employed the services of Jacob Bassevi of Prague, Joseph Pincherle of Gorizia, and Moses and Jacob Marburger of Gradisca.

At the dawn of mercantilism, while most Sephardi Jews were primarily active in the west in maritime and colonial trade, the Ashkenazi Jews in the service of the emperor and princes tended toward domestic trade. They were mostly wealthy businessmen, distinguished above their co-religionists by their commercial instincts and their adaptability. Court Jews frequently came into conflict with court rivals and co-religionists.

The court Jews, as the agents of the rulers, and in times of war as the purveyors and the treasurers of the state, enjoyed special privileges. They were under the jurisdiction of the court marshal, and were not compelled to wear the Jews&#x27; badge. They were permitted to stay wherever the Emperor held his court, and to live anywhere in the Holy Roman Empire, even in places where no other Jews were allowed. Wherever they settled they could buy houses, slaughter meat according to the Jewish ritual, and maintain a rabbi. They could sell their goods wholesale and retail, and could not be taxed or assessed higher than the Christians. Jews were sometimes assigned the role of local tax collectors.
== At the Austrian court ==

The Holy Roman Emperors from the House of Habsburg kept a considerable number of court Jews. Among those of Emperor Ferdinand II are mentioned the following: Solomon and Ber Mayer, who furnished cloth for four squadrons of cavalry for the wedding of the Emperor and Eleonora of Mantua; Joseph Pincherle of Görz; Moses and Joseph Marburger (Morpurgo) of Gradisca; Ventura Pariente of Trieste; the physician Elijah Chalfon of Vienna; Samuel zum Drachen, Samuel zum Straussen, and Samuel zum Weissen Drachen of Frankfurt am Main; and Mordecai Meisel of Prague. A specially favored court Jew was Jacob Bassevi, the first Jew to be ennobled, with the title &quot;von Treuenberg&quot;.

Important as court Jews were also Samuel Oppenheimer, who went from Heidelberg to Vienna, and Samson Wertheimer (Wertheimher) from Worms. Oppenheimer, who was appointed chief court factor, together with his two sons Emanuel and Wolf, and Wertheimer, who was at first associated with him, devoted their time and talents to the service of Austria and the House of Habsburg: during the Rhenish, French, Turkish, and Spanish wars they loaned millions of florins for provisions, munitions, etc. Wertheimer, who, by title at least, was also chief court factor to the electors of Mainz, the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Treves, received from the emperor a chain of honor with his miniature.

Samson Wertheimer was succeeded as court factor by his son Wolf. Contemporaneous with him was Leffmann Behrends, of Hanover, court factor and agent of the elector Ernest Augustus and of the duke Rudolf August of Brunswick. He also had relationships with several other rulers and high dignitaries. Behrends&#x27; two sons, Mordecai Gumpel and Isaac, received the same titles as he, chief court factors and agents. Isaac Cohen&#x27;s father-in-law, Behrend Lehman, called also &quot;Bärmann Halberstadt&quot;, was a court factor of Saxony, with the title of &quot;Resident&quot;; and his son Lehman Behrend was called to Dresden as court factor by King Augustus the Strong. Moses Bonaventura of Prague was also court Jew of Saxony in 1679.

== Intrigues of court Jews ==

The Model family were court Jews of the margraves of Ansbach about the middle of the seventeenth century. Especially influential was Marx Model, who had the largest business in the whole principality and extensively supplied the court and the army. He fell into disgrace through the intrigues of the court Jew Elkan Fränkel, member of a family that had been driven from Vienna. Fränkel, a , energetic, and proud man, possessed the confidence of the margrave to such a degree that his advice was sought in the most important affairs of the state. Denounced by a certain Isaiah Fränkel, however, who desired to be baptized, an accusation was brought against Elkan Fränkel; and the latter was pilloried, scourged, and sent to the Würzburg for life imprisonment on November 2, 1712. He died there in 1720.

David Rost, Gabriel Fränkel, and, in 1730, Isaac Nathan (Ischerlein) were court Jews together with Elkan Fränkel; Ischerlein, through the intrigues of the Fränkels, suffered the same fate as Elkan Fränkel. Nevertheless, Nathan&#x27;s son-in-law, Dessauer, became court Jew. Other court Jews of the princes of Ansbach were Michael Simon and Löw Israel (1743), Meyer Berlin, and Amson Solomon Seligmann (1763).

== The Great Elector ==

The Great Elector, Frederick William, also kept a court Jew, Israel Aaron (1670), who by his influence tried to prevent the influx of foreign Jews into Berlin. Other court Jews of Frederick William were Elias Gumperz in Cleves (died 1672), Berend Wulff (1675), and Solomon Fränkel (1678). More influential than any of these was Jost Liebmann. Through his marriage with the widow of the above-named Israel Aaron, he succeeded to the latter&#x27;s position, and was highly esteemed by the elector. He had continual quarrels with the court Jew of the crown prince, Markus Magnus. After his death, his influential position fell to his widow, the well-known Liebmannin, who was so well received by Frederick III (from 1701 King Frederick I of Prussia) that she could go unannounced into his cabinet.

== Other German courts==

There were court Jews at all the petty German courts; e.g., Zacharias Seligmann (1694) in the service of the Prince of Hesse-Homburg, and others in the service of the dukes of Mecklenburg. Others mentioned toward the end of the seventeenth century are: Bendix and Ruben Goldschmidt of Hamburg; Michael Hinrichsen of Glückstadt in Mecklenburg, who soon associated himself with Moses Israel Fürst, and whose son, Ruben Hinrichsen, in 1750 had a fixed salary as court agent. About this time the court agent Wolf lived at the court of Frederick III of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Disputes with the court Jews often led to protracted lawsuits.

The last actual court Jews were Israel Jacobson, court agent of Brunswick, and Wolf Breidenbach, factor to the Elector of Hesse, both of whom occupy honorable positions in the history of the Jews.

<text>Kate ter Horst MBE (6 July 1906, Amsterdam – 21 February 1992, Oosterbeek) was a Dutch housewife and mother who tended wounded and dying Allied soldiers during the Battle of Arnhem. Her British patients nicknamed her the Angel of Arnhem.

Ter Horst was born Kate Anna Arriëns, daughter of Pieter Albert Arriëns and Catharina Maingay. She married Jan ter Horst, a lawyer from Rotterdam, with whom she had six children.

==Second World War==
Kate ter Horst witnessed the landings by the British 1st Airborne Division at the beginning of Operation Market Garden on 17 September 1944, noting the event in her diary.

The goal of the operation was for the paratroopers to seize the bridges in and around Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem. The plan called for the British XXX Corps to advance across these bridges and then push into the Ruhr Valley industrial area of Germany. However, the advance on Arnhem fell behind schedule, and the troops there were forced into a defensive pocket at Oosterbeek.

Captain Randall Martin asked the ter Horsts permission to set up a Regimental Aid Post in their house at the Benedendorpsweg in Oosterbeek.

During the eight days of fighting, ter Horst tended to about 250 wounded British paratroopers herself. Some of her most famous actions in looking after the British troops included walking around her home reading the Bible to dying soldiers and finding water in the most unlikely places (such as the boiler and toilet) when, due to the large concentration of British troops, the house became a target.

Ter Horst wrote about these experiences in a book called &quot;Cloud Over Arnhem&quot;. Writing the foreword for the book, Arnhem veteran General Sir Frank King noted:

==After the war==
In November 1947, her eldest son, Pieter Albert, was killed by a leftover anti-tank mine in a meadow along the Rhine.

She starred in &quot;Theirs is the Glory&quot;, a film made directly after the war about the battle of Arnhem in which survivors were asked to re-enact the parts they played in the battle.

In 1980, the British ambassador to the Netherlands decorated Kate and her husband as Honorary Members of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.

In 1992, Kate ter Horst died after she was struck by a car outside her home. Jan died on 1 August 2003 at the age of 98.

Following her death, an Early Day Motion was passed by the British House of Commons paying tribute to Kate ter Horst.

==Cultural depictions==
Ter Horst narrated the opening montage of the 1977 film &quot;A Bridge Too Far&quot; in English. In the film, she is played by Liv Ullmann.

<text>Sabine Zlatin (13 January 1907 – 21 September 1996) was a Polish-born Jewish Frenchwoman who hid Jewish children during World War II.

==Life==
Zlatin was born Sabine Chwast in a Jewish family in Warsaw. As a young woman she moved to France, where she married Miron Zlatin. With him she ran a poultry farm in Landas in the north of France. Both received French citizenship in 1939. 

Sabine Chwast was the last of twelve children. The father was an architect. He did not like the name given to his daughter, and decided to call her Yanka, a name she kept thereafter. Sabine could not abide the stifling home environment or the widespread anti-Semitism in Poland, so she decided in the mid-1920s to leave her homeland. Through her studies, she moved successively, to Danzig, Koenigsberg, Berlin, Brussels and finally arrived in Nancy, France, where she began studying art history.
She met a young Jewish student from Russia, Miron Zlatin who was preparing a graduate degree in Agricultural University of Nancy. They were married July 31, 1927. The couple had no children. In 1929, Miron and Sabine acquired a poultry farm currently rue Miron-Zlatin to Landas in the North. After some difficulties, the operation proved a success. They were naturalized July 26, 1939.

After the outbreak of World War II, Sabine Zlatin began to train with the Red Cross. When the Germans advanced into France, the Zlatins moved to Montpellier, where Sabine Zlatin was posted to a military hospital. After the formation of the Vichy France government in 1941, she was forced to leave.

At the Hérault prefecture in the French-occupied zone, she contacted OSE, a charity for Jewish children. She helped to secure the release of children who had been interned in the camps at Agde and Rivesaltes. 

When the Germans occupied the rest of the France in 1943, Zlatin took 17 children with her to the Italian-occupied zone. Through the recommendation of the sub-prefect of Belley, she received permission to use a house in Izieu, 60 miles from Lyon in the Rhône Valley, and founded the Hérault refugee children&#x27;s home &quot;La Maison d&#x27;Izieu&quot; (&quot;Children&#x27;s Home of Izieu), where Jewish children were hidden.

However, on 6 April 1944, the Lyon Gestapo, led by Klaus Barbie, raided the house and took away all 44 of the children and the seven adults who were taking care of them. Zlatin herself was elsewhere at the time. Forty-two of the children and five of the adults were gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp, while two of the teenage children and the home superintendent, Miron Zlatin, were executed by firing squad at Reval in Estonia. 

In 1987 Zlatin testified against Barbie in his war crimes trial. The same year she founded an association to create a museum for the Izieu victims. She received support from various sources, including from French president François Mitterrand. The museum opened on 4 April 1994 in the very house that she had used to try to protect the children.

<doc id="934150" wikidata="Q5081965" url="?curid=934150" title="Charles Redheffer">
<text>Charles Redheffer was an American inventor who claimed to have invented a perpetual motion machine. First appearing in Philadelphia, Redheffer exhibited his machine to the public, charging high prices for viewing. When he applied to the government for more money, a group of inspectors were sent to examine the machine. It was discovered the machine was actually powered by a device Redheffer claimed was powered by the machine.

Redheffer moved to New York City and set up a similar scam after rebuilding his machine. However, an engineer detected that it was a fake by listening to its unsteady motions at an exhibition. He discovered that the machine was operated by a man using a crank in a room on the floor above. Redheffer returned to Philadelphia. He later claimed to have created another machine, but refused to demonstrate it to anyone. He managed to get a patent for his machine in 1820, but after this his fate is unknown.

==Personal life==
Little has been recorded about Redheffer&#x27;s life, other than his connection to the hoax. According to one source, he was from Germantown in Philadelphia, but most sources simply state that he appeared in Philadelphia with his machine. Redheffer disappeared from public view after the discovery of the fraud, and his fate is unknown.

==Appearance in Philadelphia==
Charles Redheffer and his machine became well known in Philadelphia in 1812. Redheffer claimed he had invented a perpetual motion machine and exhibited it in a house near the Schuylkill River in the outskirts of the city. He charged an admission fee of $5 (some sources claim $1) for men to view it; depending on the source, women were admitted free or at a charge of $1. The machine caused a sensation, and Redheffer lobbied for funds to build a larger version.

On January 21, 1813, eight city commissioners visited Redheffer to inspect the machine. They had to do so through a barred window, as Redheffer was concerned anyone going near the machine might damage it. One of the inspectors, Nathan Sellers, was accompanied by his son Coleman, who noticed something odd about the gears. The machine itself was said to be powering a separate device through a series of gears and weights. Coleman noticed that the cogs were worn on the wrong side and suggested that the device was in fact powering the machine.

The elder Sellers was convinced the machine was a hoax. To validate his suspicions, he hired local engineer Isaiah Lukens to build a similar machine, using a hidden clockwork motor as a power source. They then arranged a demonstration of the machine to Redheffer, who was immediately convinced and offered to buy it. Meanwhile, Redheffer&#x27;s machine appeared in the &quot;Philadelphia Gazette&quot;. Civil engineer Charles Gobort offered to bet sums of money ranging from $6,000 to $10,000 that the machine was genuine, and that Redheffer had discovered perpetual motion.

==Move to New York City==

His ruse revealed, Redheffer immediately departed for New York City where he was still unknown. He changed his machine somewhat so that it could not be detected as easily, and he exhibited it as he had done in Philadelphia.

When mechanical engineer Robert Fulton went to see the machine, he noticed that the machine was unsteady as if someone were driving it manually and irregularly with a crank. Fulton also detected that the sound was uneven, uncharacteristic of a machine&#x27;s motions. He announced the machine was a fraud, and challenged Redheffer exclaiming he would expose the secret power source, otherwise he would pay for all the damage he would cause. Redheffer agreed, so Fulton removed some boards from the wall alongside the machine and exposed a catgut cord that led to the upper floor. Upstairs he found an old man who was turning a hand-crank with one hand and eating bread with the other. Spectators realized they had been duped and destroyed the machine; Redheffer fled the city.

==Later appearances==
Redheffer appears to have constructed another machine in 1816, which he stated his intention to demonstrate to a group of men including the mayor and chief justice of Philadelphia. However, despite several meetings, Redheffer refused to demonstrate the machine to them.

On July 11, 1820, the U.S. Patent Office granted a patent to Charles Redheffer (or Charles Redheiffer) for a device listed as &quot;machinery for the purpose of gaining power&quot;. (All patents up to 1836 were lost in the 1836 U.S. Patent Office fire. If recovered, it would be X-Patent X3,215.)

<doc id="934154" wikidata="Q60535" url="?curid=934154" title="Joseph Süß Oppenheimer">
<text>Joseph Süß Oppenheimer ( – February 4, 1738) was a German banker who was court Jew for Charles Alexander, Duke of Württemberg, managing several of his enterprises. Throughout his career, Oppenheimer made scores of powerful enemies, some of whom conspired to bring about his arrest and execution after Charles Alexander&#x27;s death.

In the centuries since his execution, Oppenheimer&#x27;s rise and fall have been treated in two notable literary works, and his ordeal inspired two films, including the antisemitic production &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, released in Nazi Germany in 1940, itself the cause for a famous postwar trial.

==Career==

Oppenheimer was born in Heidelberg to a Jewish tax collector and his wife. The father died early, and the exact whereabouts of Joseph Süß in the following years are not certain. By the 1720s, Oppenheimer was working as a court Jew in Mannheim, Darmstadt, and finally Frankfurt am Main. In Frankfurt he was introduced to Karl Alexander, the future Duke of Württemberg, in 1732. When Karl Alexander ascended the throne in the following year, Oppenheimer served as his chief financial adviser. As envoy to Frankfurt in 1733, his privileged position allowed him to live outside the &quot;Judengasse&quot; in the comfort of the Golden Swan Inn.

==Arrest, trial and execution==
When his protector, Karl Alexander, suddenly died on March 12, 1737, Oppenheimer was arrested and accused of various crimes, including fraud, embezzlement, treason, lecherous relations with various women, and accepting bribes. While some Jews tried to help him during the trial, others gave incriminatory testimonies against him. The charge of lechery was dropped in order to protect reputable women.

After the heavily publicized trial, Oppenheimer was sentenced to death, without naming any specific crime. When his jailers asked that he convert to Christianity, he refused.

 Niall Ferguson writes that Süß-Oppenheimer was executed because his prosecutors found him guilty of wielding excessive political power and undermining the position of the Württemberg estates (Stände).

Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was led to the gallows on February 4, 1738, and given a final chance to convert to Christianity, which he refused to do. He was throttled, with his last words reportedly being the Jewish prayer, &quot;Hear, O Israel: the Lord is our God, the Lord is one&quot;.

The case records were then declared secret until 1918. His corpse was gibbeted in a cage that hung outside of Stuttgart in the Pragsattel district for six years until the inauguration of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg, who in his first act as ruler permitted the burial of his corpse below the gallows.

==In literature, art and film==

The story of Joseph Süß Oppenheimer was the subject of a number of literary and dramatic treatments over the course of the past two centuries. The earliest of these was Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s 1827 novella titled &quot;Jud Süß&quot;. The most successful literary adaptation was Lion Feuchtwanger&#x27;s 1925 novel titled &quot;Jud Süß&quot; based on a play that he had written in 1916 though never performed and subsequently withdrawn by Feuchtwanger.

Ashley Dukes and Paul Kornfeld also wrote dramatic adaptations of the Feuchtwanger novel. In 1934, Lothar Mendes directed a film adaptation of the novel in which Süß was portrayed by actor Conrad Veidt. An anti-semitic Nazi propaganda film titled &quot;Jud Süß&quot; was made in 1940 by Veit Harlan, in which Süß was portrayed by actor Ferdinand Marian.

In the 1990s, the German sculptor Angela Laich created a sculpture devoted to Joseph Süß Oppenheimer as well as illustrations for Hellmut G. Haasis&#x27;s biography.

In 2016 the movie &quot;Norman&quot; was released, loosely inspired by Oppenheimer&#x27;s life, starring Richard Gere.

==Biographies==
Shortly after Feuchtwanger&#x27;s novel was published, Selma Stern published a biography of Oppenheimer titled &quot;Jud Süß: Ein Beitrag zur deutschen und zur jüdischen Geschichte.&quot; More recently, Hellmut G. Haasis published a biography titled &quot;Joseph Süß Oppenheimer, genannt Jud Süß: Finanzier, Freidenker, Justizopfer.&quot; It is still the standard work on the topic. In 2017, Yair Mintzker, a history professor at Princeton University, published a new account of Oppenheimer&#x27;s trial, &quot;The Many Deaths of Jew Süss&quot;, which is the most comprehensive treatment of Oppenheimer&#x27;s trial available in English.

<doc id="934155" wikidata="Q1335818" url="?curid=934155" title="Supranational union">
<text>A supranational union is a type of international organization and political union that is empowered to directly exercise some of the powers and functions otherwise reserved to states. A supranational organization involves a greater transfer of or limitation of state sovereignty than other kinds of international organizations.

The European Union (EU) has been described as a paradigmatic case of a supranational organization, as it has deep political, economic and social integration, which includes a common market, joint border control, a supreme court, and regular popular elections.

Another method of decision-making in international organisations is intergovernmentalism, in which state governments play a more prominent role.

==Origin as a legal concept==
After the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, Albert Einstein spoke and wrote frequently in the late 1940s in favour of a &quot;supranational&quot; organization to control all military forces except for local police forces, including nuclear weapons. He thought this might begin with the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union, and grow to encompass most other nations, presenting this as the only way to avoid nuclear war. He broached the idea in the November 1945 and November 1947 articles in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; that described how the constitution of such an organization might be written. In an April 1948 address at Carnegie Hall, he reiterated: &quot;There is only &quot;one&quot; path to peace and security: the path of supranational organization.&quot; Thanks to his celebrity, Einstein&#x27;s ideas on the subject generated much discussion and controversy, but the proposal did not generate much support in the West and the Soviet Union viewed it with hostility.
With its founding Statute of 1949 and its Convention of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, which came into force in 1953, the Council of Europe created a system based on human rights and the rule of law. Robert Schuman, French foreign minister, initiated the debate on supranational democracy in his speeches at the United Nations, at the signing of the council&#x27;s Statutes and at a series of other speeches across Europe and North America.

The term &quot;supranational&quot; occurs in an international treaty for the first time (twice) in the Treaty of Paris, 18 April 1951. This new legal term defined the community method in creating the European Coal and Steel Community and the beginning of the democratic re-organisation of Europe. It defines the relationship between the High Authority or European Commission and the other four institutions. In the treaty, it relates to a new democratic and legal concept.

The Founding Fathers of the European Community and the present European Union said that supranationalism was the cornerstone of the governmental system. This is enshrined in the &quot;Europe Declaration&quot; made on 18 April 1951, the same day as the European Founding Fathers signed the Treaty of Paris.

&quot;By the signature of this Treaty, the participating Parties give proof of their determination to create the first supranational institution and that thus they are laying the true foundation of an organised Europe. This Europe remains open to all nations. We profoundly hope that other nations will join us in our common endeavour.&quot;

This declaration of principles that included their judgement for the necessary future developments was signed by Konrad Adenauer (West Germany), Paul van Zeeland and Joseph Meurice (Belgium), Robert Schuman (France), Count Sforza (Italy), Joseph Bech (Luxembourg), and Dirk Stikker and Jan van den Brink (The Netherlands). It was made to recall future generations to their historic duty of uniting Europe based on liberty and democracy under the rule of law. Thus, they viewed the creation of a wider and deeper Europe as intimately bound to the healthy development of the supranational or Community system.

This Europe was open to all nations who were free to decide, a reference/or an invitation and encouragement of liberty to the Iron Curtain countries. The term supranational does not occur in succeeding treaties, such as the Treaties of Rome, the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Nice or the Constitutional Treaty or the very similar Treaty of Lisbon.

==Distinguishing features of a supranational union==
A supranational union is a supranational polity which lies somewhere between a confederation that is an association of sovereign states and a federation that is a single sovereign state. The European Economic Community was described by its founder Robert Schuman as midway between confederalism which recognises the complete independence of states in an association and federalism which seeks to fuse them in a super-state. The EU has supranational competences, but it possesses these competences only to the extent that they are conferred on it by its member states (&quot;Kompetenz-Kompetenz&quot;). Within the scope of these competences, the union exercises its powers in a sovereign manner, having its own legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. The supranational Community also has a chamber for organised civil society including economic and social associations and regional bodies.

The union has legal supremacy over its member states only to the extent that its member state governments have conferred competences on the union. It is up to the individual governments to assure that they have full democratic backing in each of the member states. The citizens of the member states, though retaining their nationality and national citizenship, additionally become citizens of the union, as is the case with the European Union.

The European Union, the only clear example of a supranational union, has a parliament with legislative oversight, elected by its citizens.
To this extent, a supranational union like the European Union has characteristics that are not entirely dissimilar to the characteristics of a federal state like the United States of America. However, the differences in scale become apparent if one compares the United States federal budget with the budget of the European Union (which amounts only to about one percent of combined GDP) or the size of the federal civil service of the United States with the Civil Service of the European Union.

==Supranationalism in the European Union==

Historically the concept was introduced and made a concrete reality by Robert Schuman when the French Government agreed to the principle in the Schuman Declaration and accepted the Schuman Plan confined to specific sectors of vital interest of peace and war. Thus commenced the European Community system beginning with the European Coal and Steel Community. The six founder States (France, Italy, West Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg) agreed on the goal: making &quot;war not only unthinkable but materially impossible&quot;. They agreed about the means: putting the vital interests, namely coal and steel production, under a common High Authority, subject to common democratic and legal institutions. They agreed on the European rule of law and a new democratic procedure.

The five institutions (besides the High Authority) were a Consultative Committee (a chamber representing civil society interests of enterprises, workers and consumers), a parliament, and a Council of government ministers. A Court of Justice would decide disputes coming from governments, public or private enterprises, consumer groups, any other group interests or even an individual. A complaint could be lodged in a local tribunal or national courts, where appropriate. Member states have yet to fulfil and develop the articles in the Paris and Rome treaties for full democracy in the European Parliament and other institutions such as the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of Regions.

Schuman described supranational unions as a new stage in human development. It contrasted with destructive nationalisms of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries that began in a glorious patriotism and ended in wars. He traced the beginning concept of supranationality back to the nineteenth century, such as the Postal Union, and the term supranational is used around the time of the First World War. Democracy, which he defined as &quot;in the service of the people and acting in agreement with it&quot;, was a fundamental part of a supranational community. However, governments only began to hold direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979, and then not according to the treaties. A single electoral statute was specified in the treaty for Europe&#x27;s first community of coal and steel in 1951. Civil society (largely non-political) was to have its own elected chamber in the Consultative Committees specific to each Community as democratically agreed, but the process was frozen (as were Europe&#x27;s parliamentary elections) by Charles de Gaulle and other politicians who opposed the Community method.

Today supranationalism only exists in the two European Communities inside the EU: the Economic Community (often called the European Community although it does not legally cover all State activities) and Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community, a non-proliferation community, in which certain potentialities have been frozen or blocked). Supranational Communities provide powerful but generally unexploited and innovatory means for democratic foreign policy, by mobilising civil society to the democratically agreed goals of the Community.

The first Community of Coal and Steel was agreed only for fifty years. Opposition, mainly by enterprises which had to pay a small European tax of less than 1% and government ministers in the council, led to its democratic mandate not being renewed. Its jurisprudence and heritage remains part of the European Community system.

De Gaulle attempted to turn the European Commission into a political secretariat under his control in the Fouchet Plan but this move was thwarted by such democrats in the Benelux countries as Paul-Henri Spaak, Joseph Luns and Joseph Bech as well as a large wave of other pro-Europeans in all the Community countries.

The supranational Community method came under attack, not only from de Gaulle but also from other nationalists and Communists. In the post-de Gaulle period, rather than holding pan-European elections under a single statute as specified in all the treaties, governments held and continue to hold separate national elections for the European Parliament. These often favour the major parties and discriminate against smaller, regional parties. Rather than granting elections to organised civil society in the consultative committees, governments created a three-pillar system under the Amsterdam Treaty and Maastricht Treaty, mixing intergovernmental and supranational systems. Two pillars governing External policy and Justice and Home affairs are not subject to the same democratic controls as the Community system.

In the Lisbon Treaty and the earlier nearly identical Constitutional Treaty, the democratic independence of the five key institutions is further blurred. This moves the project from full democratic supranationalism in the direction of not just intergovernmentalism but the politicisation of the institutions, and control by two or three major party political organisations. The Commission defines key legal aspects of the supranational system because its members must be independent of commercial, labour, consumer, political or lobby interests (Article 9 of the Paris Treaty). The commission was to be composed of a small number of experienced personalities, whose impartiality was beyond question. As such, the early presidents of the Commission and the High Authority were strong defenders of European democracy against national, autocratic practice or the rule of the strong over the weak.

The idea in the Constitutional and Lisbon Treaties is to run the European Commission as a political office. Governments would prefer to have a &quot;national&quot; member in the commission, although this is against the principle of supranational democracy. (The original concept was that the commission should act as a single impartial college of independent, experienced personalities having public confidence. One of the Communities was defined in the treaty with a Commission with fewer members than the number of its member states.) Thus, the members of the commission are becoming predominantly party-political, and composed of sometimes rejected, disgraced or unwanted national politicians.

The first president of the High Authority was Jean Monnet, who never joined a political party, as was the case with most of the other members of the Commissions. They came from diverse liberal professions, having made recognised European contributions.

Governments also wish to retain the secrecy of their deliberations in the Council of Ministers or the European Council, which discusses matters of the most vital interest to European citizens. While some institutions such as the European Parliament have their debates open to the public, others such as the Council of Ministers and numerous committees are not. Schuman wrote in his book, &quot;Pour l&#x27;Europe&quot; (&quot;For Europe&quot;), that in a democratic supranational Community &quot;the Councils, committees and other organs should be placed under the control of public opinion that was effectual without paralysing their activity nor useful initiatives&quot;.

===Categorising European supranationalism===
Joseph H. H. Weiler, in his work &quot;The Dual Character of Supranationalism&quot;, states that there are two main facets to European supranationalism, although these seem to be true of many supranational systems. These are:
* Normative supranationalism: The Relationships and hierarchy which exist between Community policies and legal measures on one hand and the competing policies and legal measures of the member states on the other (the executive dimension)
* Decisional supranationalism: The institutional framework and decision making by which such measures are initiated, debated, formulated, promulgated and, finally, executed (the legislative-judicial dimension)

In many ways, the split sees the separation of powers confined to merely two branches.

==Comparing the European Union and the United States==
In the Lisbon Treaty, the distribution of competences in various policy areas between member states and the European Union is redistributed in three categories. In 19th century US, it had exclusive competences only. Competences not explicitly listed belong to lower levels of governance.

== Democratic deficit in the EU and other supranational unions ==

In a supranational union, the problem of how to reconcile the principle of equality among nation states, which applies to international (intergovernmental) organisations, and the principle of equality among citizens, which applies within nation states is resolved by taking a sectoral approach. This allows an innovatory, democratic broadening the number of actors to be included. These are present not only in the classical Parliament which has slightly different functions but also in the Consultative Committees such as the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions which the treaties give powers equivalent to parliaments in their own areas but which are at present still developing their potential. In the European Union, the Lisbon Treaty mixes two principles (classical parliamentary government with a politically elected government) and a supranational community with an independent European Commission. 

Governments are also trying to treat the Lisbon Treaty as a simple classical treaty, or even an amendment to one, which does not require citizens&#x27; support or democratic approval. The proposed Lisbon Treaty and the earlier Constitutional draft still retain in the European Union elements of a supranational union, as distinct from a federal state on the lines of the United States of America. But this is at the expense of the democratic potentialities of a full supranational union as conceived in the first Community.

==Other international organisations with some degree of integration==
The only union generally recognised as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the European Union. 

Although the Soviet Union was created under an initial ideological appearance of forming a supranational union, it never de facto functioned as one, and constitutionally was a federation; see &quot;Republics of the Soviet Union § Constitutional status&quot; for details. 

There are a number of other regional organisations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects.
* African Union (AU)
* Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
* Benelux, a political union of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Luxembourg. Though part of the EU, EU treaties contain an exception that EU law does not preclude further Benelux integration.
* Caribbean Community (CARICOM)
* Central American Integration System (SICA)
* Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), a successor organization to the Soviet Union
* Community for Democracy and Rights of Nations
* Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (Gulf Cooperation council) (GCC)
* Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO)
* Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU)
* Group of 77 (G77) is a coalition of 134 developing countries, designed to promote its members&#x27; collective economic interests and create an enhanced joint negotiating capacity in the United Nations. It was founded by non-aligned states during the Cold War.
* Organization of Ibero-American States (OEI)
* Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)
* Organization of Turkic States
* Pacific Alliance, a Latin American trade bloc
* South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
* Union of South American Nations (USAN)
* Union State, a union of Russian Federation and Belarus

Other organisations that have also discussed greater integration include:
* Arab League into an &quot;Arab Union&quot;
* Pacific Islands Forum into the &quot;Pacific Union&quot;
* Eurasian Customs Union into the &quot;Eurasian Economic Union&quot;
* Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC) into the &quot;Latin American Union&quot;
* East African Community into the &quot;East African Federation&quot;
* Economic Community of Central African States (CEMAC)
* Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS)

<text>William Blundell (1946 – 3 July 2023) was an Australian painter and art copyist. He painted copies, which he called innuendos, for Sydney art dealer Germaine Marie François Toussaint Curvers.

Blundell painted works with the style of, among others, Australian artists Charles Blackman, Arthur Boyd, William Dobell, Russell Drysdale, Sidney Nolan, Lloyd Rees, Arthur Streeton, Elioth Gruner, Brett Whiteley and also Claude Monet. According to Blundell, he sold them to Curvers as copies for decorative purposes only. He does not call them forgeries but &quot;innuendos&quot;, works in the style of a specific artist. Many of the paintings were sold privately or at auction for up to $65,000. In an interview with &quot;Four Corners&quot;, Blundell claimed that he had painted at least 400 Whiteleys alone.

The forgeries were publicly exposed as a result of a dispute over Curvers&#x27; estate. Curvers had amassed a large private art collection, including an original E. Phillips Fox. Shortly before her death, Curvers dictated a new will to Blundell, appointing him executor, and leaving nothing to her husband and son. Curvers&#x27; husband, John, contested the will, and in the course of the estate investigation, summoned several art experts to examine the private collection because he doubted the authenticity of some of the paintings. As a result, John produced a list of nearly 200 works that he claimed were copies, stating that it was unknown to his late wife.

In court, Blundell confessed they were his works, but insisted that Germaine knew they were copies, stating &#x27;She&#x27;s six feet under now, so they will have to take my word for it&#x27;. Blundell said that the intention was that his paintings would be given away or sold for a nominal fee and that they would be used for decoration. He denies any intention to pass them as genuine to deceive collectors. Blundell stated that his early works were unsigned or contained clues that they were not originals, placing &quot;d&#x27;après&quot; in the hair of his figures to indicate that it was &quot;after&quot; not &quot;by&quot; the artist.

It has been pointed out that it was Germaine who made the greatest profit from the copies. The Sydney Morning Herald stated &#x27;Her records, produced to the court, show that over 10 years she paid Blundell - always by cash or cash cheque - only about $40,000, typically $100 to $200 per painting. Her profits were extraordinary - often, just by adding an old $50 frame, she could make a 2,000 per cent profit.&#x27;

Germaine was nearly exposed in 1994 by a Paddington doctor who purchased 11 &#x27;Whiteleys&#x27; from her for $30,000. One art expert pronounced the works genuine and valued them at $85,000 for insurance purposes. However, two subsequent experts pointed out they were fakes, and the police were called in. Curvers refunded the money, and told reporters that she purchased them in good faith; therefore, no charges were laid.

Blundell later moved to Tasmania. He died in Penguin, Tasmania on 3 July 2023.

<text>Henri Lemoine (&quot;fl.&quot; 1905–1908) was a French fraudster who claimed to be able to produce synthetic diamonds.

==Fraud==
In 1905, Lemoine contacted Sir Julius Wernher, British banker and one of the governors of De Beers Diamond Mines. He said he had discovered a process to produce gem-sized diamonds from coal and agreed to sell his invention if Wernher would be willing to invest to further his research. He invited Wernher to his laboratory in Paris to witness the process. Wernher took Francis Oats, a De Beers executive, and two other associates with him.

Lemoine invited his guests in and left the room; moments later he reappeared naked, to prove that he was not concealing any diamonds in his clothing. He mixed a number of substances including iron filings and coal into a small crucible, showed the mixture to his guests, and placed it into a furnace in the center of the room.

After fifteen minutes, Lemoine removed the hot crucible and let it cool. Then he picked a pair of tweezers and took out about twenty small, well-formed diamonds. Oats examined the diamonds and demanded that Lemoine repeat the procedure. He did so successfully.

Wernher offered to pay Lemoine to develop his invention if he would keep it a secret. Lemoine agreed and promised him an option to buy his secret formula, which he deposited in a London bank deposit box.

For the next three years, Sir Julius sent Lemoine a total of £64,000. Lemoine promised to build a factory to duplicate diamonds; actually he just took a picture of an electric plant in southern France and sent it to Sir Julius.

In 1908, a Persian jeweler revealed that he had sold Lemoine small diamonds that matched the description of the diamonds Lemoine had shown during the first demonstration. Lemoine was indicted for fraud.

In court, Lemoine continued to claim that his process was genuine but was unable to duplicate it for the judges. The secret formula was unsealed by a court order; it was a mixture of powdered carbon and sugar. Before the court could agree on his guilt, Lemoine left the country for parts unknown.

==In Literature==

&quot;The Lemoine Affair&quot; is a collection of literary pastiches by Marcel Proust, in which he spoofs the writing styles of several fellow French authors. The overall theme is Lemoine, his fraud and its outcome. Proust, himself, lost considerable money on the scheme.

<doc id="934164" wikidata="Q20828805" url="?curid=934164" title="Sprite (folklore)">
<text>A sprite is a supernatural entity in European mythology. They are often depicted as fairy-like creatures or as an ethereal entity.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;sprite&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;spiritus&quot; (&quot;spirit&quot;), via the French &quot;&quot;. Variations on the term include &quot;spright&quot; and the Celtic &quot;spriggan&quot;. The term is chiefly used with regard to elves and fairies in European folklore, and in modern English is rarely used in reference to spirits. 

== Belief in sprites ==

The belief in diminutive beings such as sprites, elves, fairies, etc. has been common in many parts of the world, and might to some extent still be found within neo-spiritual and religious movements such as &quot;neo-druidism&quot; and Ásatrú.

In some elemental magics, the sprite is often believed to be the elemental of air (see also sylph).

== Water sprite ==


A water sprite (also called a water fairy or water faery) is a general term for an elemental spirit associated with water, according to alchemist Paracelsus. Water sprites are said to be able to breathe water or air and sometimes can fly.

These creatures exist in the mythology of various groups. Ancient Greeks knew water nymphs in several types such as naiads (or &quot;nyads&quot;), which were divine entities that tended to be fixed in one place and so differed from gods or physical creatures. Slavic mythology knows them as vilas.

Water sprites differ from corporeal beings, such as selkies, mermaids, and sirens, as they are not purely physical and are more akin to local deities than animals.

<doc id="934168" wikidata="Q5635387" url="?curid=934168" title="HNoMS Rap (1873)">
<text>The Norwegian warship HNoMS &quot;Rap&quot; was a torpedo boat built in 1873. She was one of the first torpedo boats to carry the self-propelled Whitehead torpedo after being converted to use them in 1879, the same year the Royal Navy&#x27;s HMS &quot;Lightning&quot; entered service. The name &quot;Rap&quot; (&quot;Rapp&quot; in the modern spelling) translates as &quot;quick&quot;.

== Design ==
&quot;Rap&quot; was ordered from Thornycroft shipbuilding company, England, in either 1872 or 1873, and was built at Thornycroft&#x27;s shipyard at Church Wharf in Chiswick on the River Thames. Managing a speed of , she was one of the fastest boats afloat when completed. The Norwegians initially planned to arm her with a spar torpedo, but this may never have been fitted. &quot;Rap&quot; was briefly used for experiments with a towed torpedo before finally being outfitted with launch racks for the new self-propelled Whitehead torpedoes in 1879. Her initial commanding officer was First Lieutenant Koren, who also designed the torpedo racks.

Although &quot;Rap&quot; had been built several years earlier, the first true torpedo boat built to carry self-propelled torpedoes was the British HMS &quot;Lightning&quot;, and she was in fact fitted with such torpedoes before &quot;Rap&quot;. The first warship of any kind to carry self-propelled torpedoes was of 1873.

With a displacement of less than ten tons, &quot;Rap&quot; was very limited in terms of endurance and seaworthiness. Over the next three decades &quot;Rap&quot; would be followed by many other Norwegian torpedo boats of ever-increasing size and complexity. She was finally stricken from the fleet in 1920, long after she had become obsolete.

== Gallery ==
== Legacy ==
Today, &quot;Rap&quot; is exhibited at the Naval Museum in Horten, Norway.

&quot;Rap&quot; was also the name given to a class of six motor torpedo boats built for the Royal Norwegian Navy in the 1950s.

<text>Giovanni Francesco &quot;Gianfrancesco&quot; Straparola, also known as Zoan or Zuan Francesco Straparola da Caravaggio (ca. 1485–1558), was an Italian writer of poetry, and collector and writer of short stories. Some time during his life, he migrated from Caravaggio to Venice where he published a collection of stories in two volumes called &quot;The Facetious Nights&quot; or &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot;. This collection includes some of the first known printed versions of fairy tales in Europe, as they are known today.

==Biography==

=== Life ===
Not much is known of Straparola&#x27;s life except for a few facts regarding his published works. He was likely born some time around 1485 in Caravaggio, Italy (on the Lombard plain east of Milan). However, nothing more is known of his life until 1508 when he was found to be in Venice where he signed his name &quot;Zoan&quot; on the title page of his &quot;Opera nova de Zoan Francesco Straparola da Caravaggio novamente stampata&quot; (&quot;New Works&quot;).

Prior to issuing the first volume of &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot;, Straparola obtained permission to publish from the Venetian authorities on March 8, 1550, though the name on the permission reads &quot;Zuan Francesco Sstraparola da Caravaggio.&quot;

Straparola was said to have died in 1558. But his death may have occurred earlier as after the 1556 or 1557 print run, the woodcut portrait of the author disappeared from the work as well as the words &quot;All’instanza dall’autore&quot; (at the behest of the author), the printer being Comin da Trino, Venice. This possibly could put Straparola&#x27;s death prior to 1558 (Bottigheimer suggests 1555 due to the plague at that time, and in some city other than Venice as his death is not recorded in the death records of Venice in the 1550s or early 1560s.

As a lettered man not native to Venice, Straparola may have held the position of teacher, private secretary, or a type of ‘ghost writer’ for a patron.

===Name===
The name &quot;Straparola&quot; is unlikely to be Giovanni Francesco&#x27;s real name. Bottigheimer suggests &quot;Straparola&quot; is a nickname derived from the Italian verb &quot;straparlare&quot;, meaning &quot;to talk too much&quot; or &quot;to talk nonsense&quot;. Zipes has the name meaning &quot;loquacious&quot;. The use of a nickname is understandable as the publishing of satirical writings in sixteenth-century Venice often held personal danger for the author.

==Writings==

===&quot;New Works&quot;===
In Venice in 1508, Straparola published his &quot;Opera nova de Zoan Francesco Straparola da Caravazo novamente stampata&quot; (&quot;New Works&quot;), which contained sonnets, &quot;strambotti&quot; (satirical verse), &quot;epistre&quot; (epistles), and &quot;capitoli&quot; (satirical poetry). It was reprinted in 1515.

===&quot;The Facetious Nights&quot;===
In 1551, also in Venice, Straparola published the first volume of his &quot;Le Piacevoli Notti Di M. Giovanfrancesco Straparola da Caravaggio&quot;, which is often translated as &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot; or &quot;The Facetious Nights&quot;, the second volume of this work appearing in 1553.

&quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot; is the work for which Straparola is most noted, and which contains a total of seventy-five short stories, fables, and fairy tales (Straparola 1894, vol.1 has 25; vol. 2 has 50). The tales, or novelle, are divided into Nights, rather than chapters, and resemble the type of narrative presentation found in Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (1350–52). This presentation is of a gathering of Italian aristocrats, men and women, who entertain themselves by singing songs, dancing, and telling stories, &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot; having added enigmas (riddles). [Compare Boccaccio 2010 with Straparola 1894.]

One story in the second book of &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot;, &quot;The Tailor&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; or &quot;Maestro Lattantio and His Apprentice Dionigi&quot; (Straparola 1984 vol. 2, 102–110.), was removed a few years after first appearing in the second volume due to Church influence, while the entire collection entered a number of Indexes of prohibited books between 1580 and 1624.

It is claimed that many of the stories in &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot; had been taken from earlier works, specifically from Girolamo Morlini, a 15th/16th century lawyer from Naples whose &quot;Novellae, fabulae, comoedia&quot; appeared in 1520. Today, in at least one instance, the name of Girolamo Morlini has been associated in print with &quot;The Facetious Nights&quot;.

If taken at his word, Straparola never denied this. In the Dedication at the front of the second volume, Straparola wrote that the stories &quot;. . . &quot;written and collected in this volume&quot; [vol. 2 only?] &quot;are none of mine, but goods which I have feloniously taken from this man and that. Of a truth I confess they are not mine, and if I said otherwise I should lie, but nevertheless I have faithfully set them down according to the manner in which they were told by the ladies, nobles, learned men and gentlemen who gathered together for recreation&quot;.&quot; Zipes even mentioned at one time that &quot;&quot;Straparola was not an original writer&quot;.&quot; It was often the case in Renaissance Italy that the use of the &quot;frame tale&quot; allowed an author to dodge some of the criticism for printing stories from other writers by disclaiming original authorship, saying they only wrote down what they heard.

Though this Dedication is signed &quot;From Giovanni Francesco Straparola,&quot; Bottigheimer suggests that changes in narrative style between volume 1 and 2, both within the stories themselves and the frame tale, imply that someone other than Straparola could have worked on or finished the second volume, taking some of the stories at random from Morlini&#x27;s &quot;Novellea&quot;.

==Fairy tales==
Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Pleasant Nights&quot; is the first known work where fairy tales as they are known today appeared in print. Zipes lists these as being:

* &quot;Cassandrino&quot; (&quot;The Master Thief&quot;) [1: 20–27]
* &quot;Pre Scarpafico&quot; (&quot;The Priest Scarpafico&quot;) [1: 28–34]
* &quot;Tebaldo&quot; (&quot;Doralice&quot;) [1: 35–44]
* &quot;Galeotto&quot; (&quot;The Pig King&quot; or &quot;Prince Pig&quot;) [1: 58–66]
* &quot;Pietro&quot; (&quot;Peter the Fool&quot;) [1: 102–110]
* &quot;Biancabella&quot; (&quot;Biancabella and the Snake&quot;) [1: 125–139]
* &quot;Fortunio&quot; (&quot;Fortunio and the Siren&quot;) [1: 140–152]
* &quot;Ricardo&quot; (&quot;Costanza/Costanzo&quot;) [1: 167–178]
* &quot;Aciolotto&quot; (&quot;Ancilotto, King of Provino&quot; [?]) [1: 186–198]
* &quot;Guerrino&quot; (&quot;Guerrino and the Savage Man&quot;) [1: 221–236]
* &quot;I tre fratelli&quot; (&quot;The Three Brothers&quot;) [2: 71–74]
* &quot;Maestro Lattantio&quot; (&quot;The Tailor&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; or &quot;Maestro Lattantio and His Apprentice Dionigi&quot;) [2: 102–110]
* &quot;Cesarino&quot; (&quot;Cesarino the Dragon Slayer&quot;) [2: 182–191]
* &quot;Soriana&quot; (&quot;Costantino Fortunato&quot;) [2: 209–214]

The numbers in brackets refers to the volume and the pages in Straparola 1894. Why &quot;Livoretto&quot; [1: 110–125] and &quot;Adamantina and the Doll&quot; [1: 236–245] are not included is not explained.

===Invention of the rise tale===
With regard to the plots used within fairy tales, it has been suggested that Straparola might have created the &quot;rise plot&quot; or &quot;rise tale&quot; often seen in fairy tales today. The &quot;rise&quot; plot takes a poor person—man or woman, girl or boy—and through the use of magic they obtain a marriage that leads to wealth: &quot;rags-magic-marriage-riches&quot;. However, this has yet to be satisfactorily established.

The stories of Straparola that can be considered ‘rise’ tales include &quot;Peter the Fool&quot;: through the auspices of a talking fish and its magic powers, a town fool rises to be a king; &quot;Fortunio and the Siren&quot;: an orphaned boy uses magic powers transferred to him by animals to secure a royal marriage; &quot;Adamantina and the Doll&quot;: a magic doll aids two women in securing royal marriages; and &quot;Costantino Fortunato&quot;: a talking cat gains marriage and wealth for her master.

==Effect on later writers==
Mme. de Murat (1670–1716), herself a writer of fairy tales, is noted as remarking in 1699 &quot;that everybody, including herself, was taking their stories from ‘Straparola.’&quot; Some of Straparola&#x27;s tales or their plot elements can indeed be found in the works of later authors. Please note that these similarities alone do not confirm the claim that any of the plots or plotlines in &quot;The Pleasant Nights&quot; originated with Straparola.

Giambattista Basile&#x27;s (1575?–1632) &quot;Peruonto&quot; and Mme d’Aulnoy&#x27;s (1650?–1705) &quot;The Dolphin,&quot; contain most of the same storyline as Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Peter the Fool&quot;, though the two former are studded with added morality: a foolish/ugly protagonist releases a fish/dolphin with magic powers that grants whatever is asked of it. (Compare Basile 2007, 32–41 and d’Aulnoy 1892, 509–535 with Straparola 1894, 1: 102–110.)

Both Basile&#x27;s &quot;Cagliuso&quot; and Charles Perrault&#x27;s (1628–1703) &quot;The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots&quot; follow the same plotlines as Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Costantino Fortunato:&quot; the protagonist inherits a talking cat that gains a royal marriage and wealth for her/his master. (Compare Basile 2007, 145–150 and Perrault 1969, 45–57 with Straparola 1894 2: 209–214.)

&quot;Der Eisenhans&quot; (&quot;Iron Jack&quot;) in Grimm (1785–1863 &amp; 1786–1859) contains the same basic plot as that of &quot;Guerrino and the Savage Man:&quot; the protagonist is helped in his quest(s) by a wild or savage man he sets free. (Compare Grimm 1972, 612–620 with Straparola 1894 1: 221–236.) The Brothers Grimm never invented fairy-tales, they exclusively collected and published folktales which had been passed on from generation to generation. This fact indicates that &quot;Guerrino&quot; is one of Straparola&#x27;s collected folktales rather than one of his invented literary fairy-tales.

The plot in Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Ancilotto&quot; is followed closely, with some differing details, in &quot;The Dancing Water, the Singing Apple, and the Speaking Bird&quot; as found in Joseph Jacobs&#x27;s collection of 1916: to prevent a king from meeting with his children, they’re sent on near-impossible quests. (Compare Straparola 1894 vol. 1: 186–198 with Jacobs 1916, 51–65.) In this same collection of Jacob&#x27;s is the story &quot;The Master Thief,&quot; which follows the same plot as Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Cassandrino the Thief&quot;: a magistrate or lord has a thief prove how good he is or will be killed. (Compare Jacobs 1916, 121–128 with Straparola 1894 1: 20–27.)

Basile&#x27;s ‘The Goose’ follows the same plotline as Straparola&#x27;s &quot;Adamantina and the Doll&quot;: a doll/goose that grants bounty to two poor sisters ultimately leads them to marrying royally. (Compare Basile 2007, 397–401 with Straparola 1894 1: 236–245.)

Italo Calvino was inspired by Straparola in the curation of his work &quot;Fiabe italiane&quot;.

<doc id="934177" wikidata="Q2344888" url="?curid=934177" title="First Great Awakening">
<text>The First Great Awakening, sometimes Great Awakening or the Evangelical Revival, was a series of Christian revivals that swept Britain and its thirteen North American colonies in the 1730s and 1740s. The revival movement permanently affected Protestantism as adherents strove to renew individual piety and religious devotion. The Great Awakening marked the emergence of Anglo-American evangelicalism as a trans-denominational movement within the Protestant churches. In the United States, the term &quot;Great Awakening&quot; is most often used, while in the United Kingdom, the movement is referred to as the &quot;Evangelical Revival&quot;.

Building on the foundations of older traditions—Puritanism, Pietism, and Presbyterianism—major leaders of the revival such as George Whitefield, John Wesley, and Jonathan Edwards articulated a theology of revival and salvation that transcended denominational boundaries and helped forge a common evangelical identity. Revivalists added to the doctrinal imperatives of Reformation Protestantism an emphasis on providential outpourings of the Holy Spirit. Extemporaneous preaching gave listeners a sense of deep personal conviction about their need for salvation by Jesus Christ and fostered introspection and commitment to a new standard of personal morality. Revival theology stressed that religious conversion was not only intellectual assent to correct Christian doctrine but had to be a &quot;new birth&quot; experienced in the heart. Revivalists also taught that receiving assurance of salvation was a normal expectation in the Christian life.

While the Evangelical Revival united evangelicals across various denominations around shared beliefs, it also led to division in existing churches between those who supported the revivals and those who did not. Opponents accused the revivals of fostering disorder and fanaticism within the churches by enabling uneducated, itinerant preachers and encouraging religious enthusiasm. In England,evangelical Anglicans would grow into an important constituency within the Church of England, and Methodism would develop out of the ministries of Whitefield and Wesley. In the American colonies, the Awakening caused the Congregational and Presbyterian churches to split, while strengthening both the Methodist and Baptist denominations. It had little immediate impact on most Lutherans, Quakers, and non-Protestants, but later gave rise to a schism among Quakers that persists to this day.

Evangelical preachers &quot;sought to include every person in conversion, regardless of gender, race, and status&quot;. Throughout the North American colonies, especially in the South, the revival movement increased the number of African slaves and free blacks who were exposed to (and subsequently converted to) Christianity. It also inspired the founding of new missionary societies, such as the Baptist Missionary Society in 1792.

==Continental Europe==
Historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom sees the Great Awakening as part of a &quot;great international Protestant upheaval&quot; that also created Pietism in the Lutheran and Reformed churches of continental Europe. Pietism emphasized heartfelt religious faith in reaction to an overly intellectual Protestant scholasticism perceived as spiritually dry. Significantly, the Pietists placed less emphasis on traditional doctrinal divisions between Protestant churches, focusing rather on religious experience and affections.

Pietism prepared Europe for revival, and it usually occurred in areas where pietism was strong. The most important leader of the Awakening in central Europe was Nicolaus Zinzendorf, a Saxon noble who studied under Pietist leader August Hermann Francke at Halle University. In 1722, Zinzendorf invited members of the Moravian Church to live and worship on his estates, establishing a community at Herrnhut. The Moravians came to Herrnhut as refugees, but under Zinzendorf&#x27;s guidance, the group enjoyed a religious revival. Soon, the community became a refuge for other Protestants as well, including German Lutherans, Reformed Christians, and Anabaptists. The church began to grow, and Moravian societies would be established in England, where they would help foster the Evangelical Revival as well.

==Evangelical Revival in Britain==
===England===
While known as the &quot;Great Awakening&quot; in the United States, the 18th-century revival movement is referred to as the &quot;Evangelical Revival&quot; in Britain. In England, the major leaders of the Evangelical Revival were three Anglican priests: the brothers John and Charles Wesley and their friend George Whitefield. Together, they founded what would become Methodism. They had been members of a religious society at Oxford University called the Holy Club and &quot;Methodists&quot; due to their methodical piety and rigorous asceticism. This society was modeled on the &quot;collegia pietatis&quot; (cell groups) used by pietists for Bible study, prayer, and accountability. All three men experienced a spiritual crisis in which they sought true conversion and assurance of faith.

George Whitefield joined the Holy Club in 1733 and, under the influence of Charles Wesley, read German pietist August Hermann Francke&#x27;s &quot;Against the Fear of Man&quot; and Scottish theologian Henry Scougal&#x27;s &quot;The Life of God in the Soul of Man&quot; (the latter work was a favorite of Puritans). Scougal wrote that many people mistakenly understood Christianity to be &quot;Orthodox Notions and Opinions&quot;, &quot;external Duties&quot; or &quot;rapturous Heats and extatic Devotion&quot;. Rather, Scougal wrote, &quot;True Religion is an Union of the Soul with God ... &quot;It is Christ formed within us&quot;.&quot; Whitefield wrote that &quot;though I had fasted, watched and prayed, and received the Sacrament long, yet I never knew what true religion was&quot; until he read Scougal. From that point on, Whitefield sought a new birth. After a period of spiritual struggle, Whitefield experienced conversion during Lent in 1735. In 1736, he began preaching in Bristol and London. His preaching attracted large crowds who were drawn to his simple message of the necessity of the new birth as well as by his manner of delivery. His style was dramatic, and his preaching appealed to his audience&#x27;s emotions. At times, he wept or impersonated Bible characters. By the time he left England for the colony of Georgia in December 1737, Whitefield had become a celebrity.

John Wesley left for Georgia in October 1735 to become a missionary for the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. Wesley made contact with members of the Moravian Church, led by August Gottlieb Spangenberg. Wesley was impressed by their faith and piety, especially their belief that it was normal for a Christian to have assurance of faith. The failure of his mission and encounters with the Moravians led Wesley to question his own faith. He wrote in his journal, &quot;I, who went to America to convert others, was never myself converted to God.&quot;

Back in London, Wesley became friends with Moravian minister Peter Boehler and joined a Moravian small group called the Fetter Lane Society. In May 1738, Wesley attended a Moravian meeting on Aldersgate Street, where he felt spiritually transformed during a reading of Martin Luther&#x27;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans. Wesley recounted that &quot;I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away &quot;my&quot; sins, even &quot;mine&quot;, and saved &quot;me&quot; from the law of sin and death.&quot; Wesley understood his Aldersgate experience to be an evangelical conversion, and it provided him with the assurance he had been seeking. Afterwards, he traveled to Herrnhut and met Zinzendorf in person.

John Wesley returned to England in September 1738. Both John and Charles preached in London churches. Whitefield stayed in Georgia for three months to establish Bethesda Orphanage before returning to England in December. While enjoying success, Whitefield&#x27;s itinerant preaching was controversial. Many pulpits were closed to him, and he had to struggle against Anglicans who opposed the Methodists and the &quot;doctrine of the New Birth&quot;. Whitefield wrote of his opponents, &quot;I am fully convinced there is a fundamental difference between us and them. They believe only an outward Christ, we further believe that He must be inwardly formed in our hearts also.&quot;

In February 1739, parish priests in Bath and Bristol refused to allow Whitefield to preach in their churches on the grounds that he was a religious enthusiast. In response, he began open-air field preaching in the mining community of Kingswood, near Bristol. Open-air preaching was common in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, but it was unheard of in England. Further, Whitefield violated protocol by preaching in another priest&#x27;s parish without permission. Within a week, he was preaching to crowds of 10,000. By March, Whitefield had moved on to preach elsewhere. By May, he was preaching to London crowds of 50,000. He left his followers in Bristol in the care of John Wesley. Whitefield&#x27;s notoriety was increased through the use of newspaper advertisements to promote his revivals. Wesley was at first uneasy about preaching outdoors, as it was contrary to his high-church sense of decency. Eventually, however, Wesley changed his mind, claiming that &quot;all the world [is] my parish&quot;. On April 2, 1739, Wesley preached to about 3,000 people near Bristol. From then on, he continued to preach wherever he could gather an assembly, taking the opportunity to recruit followers to the movement.

Faced with growing evangelistic and pastoral responsibilities, Wesley and Whitefield appointed lay preachers and leaders. Methodist preachers focused particularly on evangelizing people who had been &quot;neglected&quot; by the established Church of England. Wesley and his assistant preachers organized the new converts into Methodist societies. These societies were divided into groups called &quot;classes&quot;—intimate meetings where individuals were encouraged to confess their sins to one another and to build each other up. They also took part in love feasts, which allowed for the sharing of testimony, a key feature of early Methodism. Growth in numbers and increasing hostility impressed upon the revival converts a deep sense of their corporate identity. Three teachings that Methodists saw as the foundation of Christian faith were:
# People are all, by nature, &quot;dead in sin&quot;.
# They are &quot;justified by faith alone&quot;.
# Faith produces inward and outward holiness.

The evangelicals responded vigorously to opposition—both literary criticism and even mob violence—and thrived despite the attacks against them. John Wesley&#x27;s organizational skills during and after the peak of revivalism established him as the primary founder of the Methodist movement. By the time of Wesley&#x27;s death in 1791, there were an estimated 71,668 Methodists in England and 43,265 in America.

===Wales and Scotland===

The Evangelical Revival first broke out in Wales. In 1735, Howell Harris and Daniel Rowland experienced a religious conversion and began preaching to large crowds throughout South Wales. Their preaching initiated the Welsh Methodist revival.

The origins of revivalism in Scotland stretch back to the 1620s. The attempts by the Stuart Kings to impose bishops on the Church of Scotland led to national protests in the form of the Covenanters. In addition, radical Presbyterian clergy held outdoor conventicles throughout southern and western Scotland, centered on the communion season. These revivals would also spread to Ulster and feature &quot;marathon extemporaneous preaching and excessive popular enthusiasm.&quot; In the 18th century, the Evangelical Revival was led by ministers such as Ebenezer Erskine, William M&#x27;Culloch (the minister who presided over the Cambuslang Work of 1742), and James Robe (minister at Kilsyth). A substantial number of Church of Scotland ministers held evangelical views.

==Great Awakening in North America==
===Early revivals===
In the early 18th century, the Thirteen Colonies were religiously diverse. In New England, the Congregational churches were the established religion, whereas in the religiously tolerant Middle Colonies, the Quakers, Dutch Reformed, Anglican, Presbyterian, Lutheran, Congregational, and Baptist churches all competed with each other on equal terms. In the Southern Colonies, the Anglican Church was officially established, though there were significant numbers of Baptists, Quakers, and Presbyterians. At the same time, church membership was low because it had failed to keep up with population growth, and the influence of Enlightenment rationalism was leading many people to turn to atheism, Deism, Unitarianism, and Universalism. The churches in New England had fallen into a &quot;staid and routine formalism in which experiential faith had been a reality to only a scattered few.&quot;

In response to these trends, ministers influenced by New England Puritanism, Scots-Irish Presbyterianism, and European Pietism began calling for a revival of religion and piety. The blending of these three traditions would produce an evangelical Protestantism that placed greater importance &quot;on seasons of revival, or outpourings of the Holy Spirit, and on converted sinners experiencing God&#x27;s love personally.&quot; In the 1710s and 1720s, revivals became more frequent among New England Congregationalists. These early revivals remained local affairs due to the lack of coverage in print media. The first revival to receive widespread publicity was that precipitated by an earthquake in 1727. As they began to be publicized more widely, revivals transformed from merely local to regional and transatlantic events.

In the 1720s and 1730s, an evangelical party took shape in the Presbyterian churches of the Middle Colonies, led by William Tennent, Sr. He established a seminary called the Log College, where he trained nearly 20 Presbyterian revivalists for the ministry, including his three sons and Samuel Blair. While pastoring a church in New Jersey, Gilbert Tennent became acquainted with Dutch Reformed minister Theodorus Jacobus Frelinghuysen. Historian Sydney Ahlstrom described Frelinghuysen as &quot;an important herald, if not the father of the Great Awakening&quot;. A pietist, Frelinghuysen believed in the necessity of personal conversion and living a holy life. The revivals he led in the Raritan Valley were &quot;forerunners&quot; of the Great Awakening in the Middle Colonies. Under Frelinghuysen&#x27;s influence, Tennent came to believe that a definite conversion experience followed by assurance of salvation was the key mark of a Christian. By 1729, Tennent was seeing signs of revival in the Presbyterian churches of New Brunswick and Staten Island. At the same time, Gilbert&#x27;s brothers, William and John, oversaw a revival in Freehold, New Jersey.

===Northampton revival===

The most influential evangelical revival was the Northampton revival of 1734–1735, under the leadership of Congregational minister Jonathan Edwards. In the fall of 1734, Edwards preached a sermon series on justification by faith alone, and the community&#x27;s response was extraordinary. Signs of religious commitment among the laity increased, especially among the town&#x27;s young people. Edwards wrote to Boston minister Benjamin Colman that the town &quot;never was so full of Love, nor so full of Joy, nor so full of distress as it has lately been. ... I never saw the Christian spirit in Love to Enemies so exemplified, in all my Life as I have seen it within this half-year.&quot; The revival ultimately spread to 25 communities in western Massachusetts and central Connecticut until it began to wane in 1737.

At a time when Enlightenment rationalism and Arminian theology were popular among some Congregational clergy, Edwards held to traditional Calvinist doctrine. He understood conversion to be the experience of moving from spiritual deadness to joy in the knowledge of one&#x27;s election (that one had been chosen by God for salvation). While a Christian might have several conversion moments as part of this process, Edwards believed there was a single point in time when God regenerated an individual, even if the exact moment could not be pinpointed.

The Northampton revival featured instances of what critics called enthusiasm but what supporters believed were signs of the Holy Spirit. Services became more emotional, and some people had visions and mystical experiences. Edwards cautiously defended these experiences as long as they led individuals to a greater belief in God&#x27;s glory than in self-glorification. Similar experiences would appear in most of the major revivals of the 18th century.

Edwards wrote an account of the Northampton revival, &quot;A Faithful Narrative&quot;, which was published in England through the efforts of prominent evangelicals John Guyse and Isaac Watts. The publication of his account made Edwards a celebrity in Britain and influenced the growing revival movement in that nation. &quot;A Faithful Narrative&quot; would become a model on which other revivals would be conducted.

===Whitefield, Tennent, and Davenport===
George Whitefield first came to America in 1738 to serve at Christ Church in Savannah and found Bethesda Orphanage. Whitefield returned to the Colonies in November 1739. His first stop was in Philadelphia, where he initially preached at Christ Church, Philadelphia&#x27;s Anglican Church, and then preached to a large outdoor crowd from the courthouse steps. He then preached in many Presbyterian churches. From Philadelphia, Whitefield traveled to New York and then to the South. In the Middle Colonies, he was popular in the Dutch and German communities as well as among the British. Lutheran pastor Henry Muhlenberg told of a German woman who heard Whitefield preach and, though she spoke no English, later said she had never before been so edified.

In 1740, Whitefield began touring New England. He landed in Newport, Rhode Island, on September 14, 1740, and preached several times in the Anglican church. He then moved on to Boston, Massachusetts, where he spent a week. There were prayers at King&#x27;s Chapel (at the time an Anglican church) and preaching at Brattle Street Church and South Church. On September 20, Whitefield preached at First Church and then outside of it to about 8,000 people who could not gain entrance. The next day, he preached outdoors again to about 15,000 people. On Tuesday, he preached at Second Church and on Wednesday at Harvard University. After traveling as far as Portsmouth, New Hampshire, he returned to Boston on October 12 to preach to 30,000 people before continuing his tour.

Whitefield then traveled to Northampton at the invitation of Jonathan Edwards. He preached twice in the parish church, and Edwards was so moved that he wept. He then spent time in New Haven, Connecticut, where he preached at Yale University. From there, he traveled down the coast, reaching New York on October 29. Whitefield&#x27;s assessment of New England&#x27;s churches and clergy prior to his intervention was negative. &quot;I am verily persuaded,&quot; he wrote, &quot;the Generality of Preachers talk of an unknown, unfelt Christ. And the Reason why Congregations have been so dead, is because dead Men preach to them.&quot;

Whitefield met Gilbert Tennent on Staten Island and asked him to preach in Boston to continue the revival there. Tennent accepted and, in December, began a three-month-long preaching tour throughout New England. Besides Boston, Tennent preached in towns throughout Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. Like Whitefield&#x27;s, Tennent&#x27;s preaching produced large crowds, many conversions, and much controversy. While antirevivalists such as Timothy Cutler heavily criticized Tennent&#x27;s preaching, most of Boston&#x27;s ministers were supportive.

Tennent was followed in the summer of 1741 by itinerant minister James Davenport, who proved to be more controversial than either Tennent or Whitefield. His rants and attacks against &quot;unconverted&quot; ministers inspired much opposition, and he was arrested in Connecticut for violating a law against itinerant preaching. At his trial, he was found mentally ill and deported to Long Island. Soon after, he arrived in Boston and resumed his fanatical preaching, only to once again be declared insane and expelled. The last of Davenport&#x27;s radical episodes took place in March 1743 in New London, when he ordered his followers to burn wigs, cloaks, rings, and other vanities. He also ordered the burning of books by religious authors such as John Flavel and Increase Mather. Following the intervention of two pro-revival &quot;New Light&quot; ministers, Davenport&#x27;s mental state apparently improved, and he published a retraction of his earlier excesses.

Whitefield, Tennent, and Davenport would be followed by a number of both clerical and lay itinerants. However, the Awakening in New England was primarily sustained by the efforts of parish ministers. Sometimes revival would be initiated by regular preaching or the customary pulpit exchanges between two ministers. Through their efforts, New England experienced a &quot;great and general Awakening&quot; between 1740 and 1743, characterized by a greater interest in religious experience, widespread emotional preaching, and intense emotional reactions accompanying conversion, including fainting and weeping. There was a greater emphasis on prayer and devotional reading, and the Puritan ideal of converted church membership was revived. It is estimated that between 20,000 and 50,000 new members were admitted to New England&#x27;s Congregational churches even as expectations for members increased.

By 1745, the Awakening had begun to wane. Revivals would continue to spread to the southern backcountry and slave communities in the 1750s and 1760s.

===Conflict===
The Great Awakening aggravated existing conflicts within the Protestant churches, often leading to schisms between supporters of revival, known as &quot;New Lights&quot;, and opponents of revival, known as &quot;Old Lights&quot;. The Old Lights saw the religious enthusiasm and itinerant preaching unleashed by the Awakening as disruptive to church order, preferring formal worship and a settled, university-educated ministry. They mocked revivalists as being ignorant, heterodox, or con artists. New Lights accused Old Lights of being more concerned with social status than with saving souls and even questioned whether some Old Light ministers were even converted. They also supported itinerant ministers who disregarded parish boundaries.

Congregationalists in New England experienced 98 schisms, which in Connecticut also affected which group would be considered &quot;official&quot; for tax purposes. It is estimated in New England that in the churches there were about one-third each of New Lights, Old Lights, and those who saw both sides as valid. The Awakening aroused a wave of separatist feeling within the Congregational churches of New England. Around 100 Separatist congregations were organized throughout the region by Strict Congregationalists. Objecting to the Halfway Covenant, Strict Congregationalists required evidence of conversion for church membership and also objected to the semi-presbyterian Saybrook Platform, which they felt infringed on congregational autonomy. Because they threatened Congregationalist uniformity, the Separatists were persecuted, and in Connecticut they were denied the same legal toleration enjoyed by Baptists, Quakers, and Anglicans.

The Baptists benefited the most from the Great Awakening. Although numerically small before the outbreak of revival, Baptist churches experienced growth during the last half of the 18th century. By 1804, there were over 300 Baptist churches in New England. This growth was primarily due to an influx of former New Light Congregationalists who became convinced of Baptist doctrines, such as believer&#x27;s baptism. In some cases, entire Separatist congregations accepted Baptist beliefs.

As revivalism spread through the Presbyterian churches, the Old Side–New Side Controversy broke out between the anti-revival &quot;Old Side&quot; and the pro-revival &quot;New Side&quot;. At issue was the place of revivalism in American Presbyterianism, specifically the &quot;relation between doctrinal orthodoxy and experimental knowledge of Christ.&quot; The New Side, led by Gilbert Tennent and Jonathan Dickinson, believed that strict adherence to orthodoxy was meaningless if one lacked a personal religious experience, a sentiment expressed in Tennent&#x27;s 1739 sermon &quot;The Danger of an Unconverted Ministry&quot;. Whitefield&#x27;s tour had helped the revival party grow but only worsened the controversy. When the Presbyterian Synod of Philadelphia met in May 1741, the Old Side expelled the New Side, which then reorganized itself into the Synod of New York.

===Aftermath===
Historian John Howard Smith noted that the Great Awakening made sectarianism an essential characteristic of American Christianity. While the Awakening divided many Protestant churches between Old and New Lights, it also unleashed a strong impulse towards interdenominational unity among the various Protestant denominations. Evangelicals considered the new birth to be &quot;a bond of fellowship that transcended disagreements on fine points of doctrine and polity&quot;, allowing Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and others to cooperate across denominational lines.

While divisions between the Old and New Lights remained, the New Lights became less radical over time, and evangelicalism became more mainstream. By 1758, the Old Side–New Side split in the Presbyterian Church had been healed, and the two factions had reunited. In part, this was due to the growth of the New Side and the numerical decline of the Old Side. In 1741, the pro-revival party had around 22 ministers, but this number had increased to 73 by 1758. While the fervor of the Awakening would fade, the acceptance of revivalism and insistence on personal conversion would remain recurring features in 18th- and 19th-century Presbyterianism.

The Great Awakening inspired the creation of evangelical educational institutions. In 1746, New Side Presbyterians founded what would become Princeton University. In 1754, the efforts of Eleazar Wheelock led to what would become Dartmouth College, originally established to train Native American boys for missionary work among their own people. While initially resistant, well-established Yale University came to embrace revivalism and played a leading role in American evangelicalism for the next century.

==Revival theology==

The Great Awakening was not the first time that Protestant churches had experienced revival; however, it was the first time a common evangelical identity had emerged based on a fairly uniform understanding of salvation, preaching the gospel, and conversion. Revival theology focused on the way of salvation—the stages by which a person receives Christian faith and then expresses that faith in the way they live.

The major figures of the Great Awakening, such as George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Gilbert Tennent, Jonathan Dickinson, and Samuel Davies, were moderate evangelicals who preached a pietistic form of Calvinism heavily influenced by the Puritan tradition, which held that religion was not only an intellectual exercise but also had to be felt and experienced in the heart. This moderate revival theology consisted of a three-stage process. The first stage was conviction of sin, which was spiritual preparation for faith by God&#x27;s law and the means of grace. The second stage was conversion, in which a person experienced spiritual illumination, repentance, and faith. The third stage was consolation, which was searching for and receiving assurance of salvation. This process generally takes place over an extended period of time.

===Conviction of sin===
Conviction of sin was the stage that prepared someone to receive salvation, and this stage often lasted weeks or months. When under conviction, nonbelievers realized they were guilty of sin and under divine condemnation and subsequently faced feelings of sorrow and anguish. When revivalists preached, they emphasized God&#x27;s moral law to highlight the holiness of God and to spark conviction in the unconverted. Jonathan Edwards&#x27; sermon &quot;Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God&quot; is an example of such preaching.

As Calvinists, revivalists also preached the doctrines of original sin and unconditional election. Due to the fall of man, humans are naturally inclined to rebel against God and are unable to initiate or merit salvation, according to the doctrine of original sin. Unconditional election relates to the doctrine of predestination—that before the creation of the world, God determined who would be saved (the elect) on the basis of his own choosing. The preaching of these doctrines resulted in the convicted feeling both guilty and totally helpless, since God was in complete control over whether they would be saved or not.

Revivalists counseled those under conviction to apply the means of grace to their lives. These were spiritual disciplines such as prayer, Bible study, church attendance, and personal moral improvement. While no human action could produce saving faith, revivalists taught that the means of grace &quot;might&quot; make conversion more likely.

Revival preaching was controversial among Calvinists. Because Calvinists believed in election and predestination, some thought it inappropriate to preach to strangers that they could repent and receive salvation. For some, such preaching was only acceptable within their own churches and communities. The revivalists use of &quot;indiscriminate&quot; evangelism—the &quot;practice of extending the gospel promises to everyone in their audiences, without stressing that God redeems only those elected for salvation&quot;—was contrary to these notions. While they preached indiscriminately, however, revivalists continued to affirm Calvinist doctrines of election and predestination.

Another issue that had to be addressed was the intense physical and emotional reactions to conviction experienced during the Awakening. Samuel Blair described such responses to his preaching in 1740: &quot;Several would be overcome and fainting; others deeply sobbing, hardly able to contain, others crying in a most dolorous manner, many others more silently weeping. ... And sometimes the soul exercises of some, thought comparatively but very few, would so far affect their bodies, as to occasion some strange, unusual bodily motions.&quot; Moderate evangelicals took a cautious approach to this issue, neither encouraging nor discouraging these responses, but they recognized that people might express their conviction in different ways.

===Conversion===
The conviction stage lasted so long because potential converts were waiting to find evidence of regeneration in their lives. The revivalists believed regeneration, or the new birth, was not simply an outward profession of faith or conformity to Christianity. They believed it was an instantaneous, supernatural work of the Holy Spirit, providing someone with &quot;a new awareness of the beauty of Christ, new desires to love God, and a firm commitment to follow God&#x27;s holy law.&quot; The reality of regeneration was discerned through self-examination, and while it occurred instantly, a convert might only gradually realize it had occurred.

Regeneration was always accompanied by saving faith, repentance, and love for God—all aspects of the conversion experience, which typically lasted several days or weeks under the guidance of a trained pastor. True conversion began when the mind opened to a new awareness and love of the gospel message. Following this illumination, converts placed their faith in Christ, depending on him alone for salvation. At the same time, a hatred of sin and a commitment to eliminate it from the heart would take hold, setting the foundation for a life of repentance or turning away from sin. Revivalists distinguished true conversion (which was motivated by love of God and hatred of sin) from false conversion (which was motivated by fear of hell).

===Consolation===
True conversion meant that a person was among the elect, but even a person with saving faith might doubt his election and salvation. Revivalists taught that assurance of salvation was the product of Christian maturity and sanctification. Converts were encouraged to seek assurance through self-examination of their own spiritual progress. The treatise &quot;Religious Affections&quot; by Jonathan Edwards was written to help converts examine themselves for the presence of genuine &quot;religious affections&quot; or spiritual desires, such as selfless love of God, certitude in the divine inspiration of the gospel, and other Christian virtues.

It was not enough, however, to simply reflect on past experiences. Revivalists taught that assurance could only be gained by actively seeking to grow in grace and holiness through mortification of sin and using the means of grace. In &quot;Religious Affections&quot;, the last sign addressed by Edwards was &quot;Christian practice&quot;, and it was this sign to which he gave the most space in his treatise. The search for assurance required conscious effort on the part of a convert and took months or even years to achieve.

==Social effects==
===Women===
The Awakening played a major role in the lives of women, though they were rarely allowed to preach or take leadership roles. A deep sense of religious enthusiasm encouraged women, especially to analyze their feelings, share them with other women, and write about them. They became more independent in their decisions, as in the choice of a husband. This introspection led many women to keep diaries or write memoirs. The autobiography of Hannah Heaton (1721–1794), a farm wife of North Haven, Connecticut, tells of her experiences in the Great Awakening, her encounters with Satan, her intellectual and spiritual development, and daily life on the farm.

Phillis Wheatley was the first published black female poet, and she was converted to Christianity as a child after she was brought to America. Her beliefs were overt in her works; she describes the journey of being taken from a Pagan land to be exposed to Christianity in the colonies in a poem entitled &quot;On Being Brought from Africa to America.&quot; Wheatley became so influenced by the revivals and especially George Whitefield that she dedicated a poem to him after his death in which she referred to him as an &quot;Impartial Saviour&quot;. Sarah Osborn adds another layer to the role of women during the Awakening. She was a Rhode Island schoolteacher, and her writings offer a glimpse into the spiritual and cultural upheaval of the time period, including a 1743 memoir, various diaries and letters, and her anonymously published &quot;The Nature, Certainty and Evidence of True Christianity&quot; (1753).

===African Americans===
The First Great Awakening led to changes in Americans&#x27; understanding of God, themselves, the world around them, and religion. In the southern Tidewater and Low Country, northern Baptist and Methodist preachers converted both white and black people. Some were enslaved at their time of conversion, while others were free. Caucasians began to welcome dark-skinned individuals into their churches, taking their religious experiences seriously while also admitting them to active roles in congregations as exhorters, deacons, and even preachers, although the last was a rarity.

The message of spiritual equality appealed to many enslaved people, and, as African religious traditions continued to decline in North America, black people accepted Christianity in large numbers for the first time.

Evangelical leaders in the southern colonies had to deal with the issue of slavery more frequently than those in the North. Still, many leaders of the revivals proclaimed that slaveholders should educate enslaved people so that they could become literate and be able to read and study the Bible. Many Africans were finally provided with some sort of education.

George Whitefield&#x27;s sermons reiterated an egalitarian message but only translated into spiritual equality for Africans in the colonies, who mostly remained enslaved. Whitefield was known to criticize slaveholders who treated enslaved people cruelly and those who did not educate them, but he had no intention to abolish slavery. He lobbied to have slavery reinstated in Georgia and proceeded to become a slaveholder himself. Whitefield shared a common belief held among evangelicals that, after conversion, slaves would be granted true equality in heaven. Despite his stance on slavery, Whitefield became influential among many Africans.

Samuel Davies was a Presbyterian minister who later became the fourth president of Princeton University. He was noted for preaching to African enslaved people who converted to Christianity in unusually large numbers, and he is credited with the first sustained proselytization of enslaved people in Virginia. Davies wrote a letter in 1757 in which he refers to the religious zeal of an enslaved man whom he had encountered during his journey. &quot;I am a poor slave, brought into a strange country, where I never expect to enjoy my liberty. While I lived in my own country, I knew nothing of that Jesus I have heard you speak so much about. I lived quite careless what will become of me when I die; but I now see such a life will never do, and I come to you, Sir, that you may tell me some good things, concerning Jesus Christ, and my Duty to GOD, for I am resolved not to live any more as I have done.&quot;

Davies became accustomed to hearing such excitement from many black people who were exposed to the revivals. He believed that black people could attain knowledge equal to that of white people if given an adequate education, and he promoted the importance of allowing slaveholders to permit enslaved people to become literate so that they could become more familiar with the instructions of the Bible.

The emotional worship of the revivals appealed to many Africans, and African leaders started to emerge from the revivals in substantial numbers soon after they converted. These figures paved the way for the establishment of the first black congregations and churches in the American colonies. Before the American Revolution, the first black Baptist churches were founded in the South in Virginia, South Carolina, and Georgia; two black Baptist churches were founded in Petersburg, Virginia.

==Scholarly interpretation==

The idea of a &quot;great awakening&quot; has been contested by historian Jon Butler as vague and exaggerated. He suggested that historians abandon the term &quot;Great Awakening&quot; because the 18th-century revivals were only regional events that occurred in only half of the American colonies, and their effects on American religion and society were minimal. Historians have debated whether the Awakening had a political impact on the American Revolution, which took place soon after. Alan Heimert sees a major impact, but most historians think it had only a minor impact.

<doc id="934180" wikidata="Q231549" url="?curid=934180" title="Anne Bonny">
<text>Anne Bonny (disappeared after 28 November 1720) was a pirate who served under John &quot;Calico Jack&quot; Rackham. Amongst the few recorded female pirates in history, she has become one of the most recognized pirates of the Golden Age of Piracy as well as in the history of piracy in general.

Much of Bonny&#x27;s background is unknown. The first biography of Bonny comes from Captain Charles Johnson&#x27;s 1724 book &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;, though the information presented by Johnson about her is considered dubious. According to Johnson, Bonny was born in Ireland the illegitimate daughter of an attorney and his servant. Bonny and her father would later move to Carolina, where she married a sailor named James Bonny. Though Johnson&#x27;s version of events has become generally accepted, there is little evidence to support them.

At an unknown date, Bonny travelled to the Bahamas where she became acquainted with the pirate John Rackham. Bonny would join Rackham&#x27;s crew, alongside another female pirate, Mary Read, and helped steal the sloop &quot;William&quot; in August 1720. Rackham and his crew would carry out a number of attacks on merchant ships in the West Indies until they were captured following a brief naval engagement in October 1720. Rackham, along with all the male crew members, were tried and sentenced to death, but Bonny and Read had their executions stayed due to both of them claiming to be pregnant. Read died in jail around mid April 1721, but Bonny&#x27;s fate is unknown.

==Early life==
Bonny&#x27;s date and place of birth are unknown. Nothing definitive is known about her early life. No primary source including her own trial transcript makes mention of her age or nation of origin. No Anne Bonny born in the late 17th century has been found in the baptism records of Ireland. Bonny is not noted to have been a colonist of Nassau before 1713. Prior to 22 August 1720, little can be definitively said about Bonny&#x27;s early life. 
===Early life according to &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot;===

All details concerning Bonny&#x27;s early life stem from Captain Charles Johnson&#x27;s &quot;A General History of the Pyrates&quot; (a greatly unreliable series of pirate biographies). Johnson writes that Bonny was born in a town near Cork in the Kingdom of Ireland. She was the daughter of a servant woman named Mary, and her employer, an unnamed attorney. Later renditions of this story would refer to the attorney as William Cormac and the mother as Peg/Mary Brennan. These are fictional names first written down in the 1964 romance novel Mistress of the Seas. 

The attorney&#x27;s wife had become ill and was moved to her mother-in-law&#x27;s home a few miles away to be cared for. Whilst his wife was away for four months, he began an affair with Mary. The attorney&#x27;s wife discovered the affair following a comical mix up concerning silver spoons.

This theatrical misunderstanding began with a tanner Mary knew stealing three silver spoons and hiding them in her bed. Mary called a constable on the man, but they were not found. Upon the wife&#x27;s return, the tanner told her the entire story about stealing silver spoons, but confessed it was only a joke. The wife found the three silver spoons in Mary&#x27;s bed as the tanner had claimed. She became suspicious however, the tanner had noted he had hidden the silver spoons days ago. The wife questioned why Mary had not been sleeping in her bed. The wife then assumed her husband had been unfaithful the past four months. The wife stayed in the bed and waited for the attorney, who called for Mary and laid in her bed, confirming the affair. The wife then put the silver spoons back into the bed, and when Mary went to sleep, she found them and hid them in her trunk. The wife later accused Mary of theft and called a constable, who wrongfully arrested her. With the affair exposed, the wife separated from the attorney and moved to a different home. 

Mary became pregnant from the affair and gave birth to a daughter, Anne, while in prison. After Anne&#x27;s birth, Mary was let go out of pity. The attorney&#x27;s mother in law died not long after, leaving a major source of income to be an allowance his estranged wife gave him out of sympathy.

How Johnson was aware of the theft of spoons and the exact nature of Anne&#x27;s birth, is never revealed.

Because everyone in town knew Mary had given birth to a bastard daughter, the attorney raised Anne as a boy, claiming she was the child of a friend. The attorney even hoped to raise Anne as a clerk. The attorney&#x27;s wife soon found out who the child was, and cut off any allowance she had been giving him. The attorney in response ended the ruse and openly lived with Anne as his daughter, but this scandal damaged his reputation and few locals wished to work with him. The attorney was forced to move elsewhere.

The attorney first moved to Cork, but this proved not far enough. The attorney then moved to the Province of Carolina, taking along Anne and her mother Mary. At first, the attorney attempted to continue his law career, but eventually became a merchant instead. He proved quite successful as a merchant, earning enough money to buy a large plantation. At an undisclosed period of time, Mary died, Anne Bonny was now grown up.

Johnson claims that Bonny possessed a fierce temper, such as supposedly stabbing a maid to death with a knife. A claim he immediately finds groundless. He also says she once beat a man severely for attempting to sleep with her.

There is no documented example of an attorney becoming a plantation owner in the Carolinas in the 17th and 18th century, not least of which one with a daughter named Anne Bonny and a history of violence.

The attorney expected Bonny to marry a good man, instead she married a poor sailor. The attorney was so outraged he threw her out. In the original volume of &quot;A General History&quot;, the sailor husband is unnamed. In &quot;A General History&quot; volume II released in 1728, the sailor is named James Bonny.

After being kicked out, Anne and James Bonny moved to Nassau, on New Providence Island, known as a sanctuary for pirates. Johnson claims that, after the arrival of Governor Woodes Rogers in the summer of 1718, James Bonny became a minor officer for the governor after taking a pardon. Anne cared little for James and frequently cheated on him. James Bonny serving Woodes Rogers is highly unlikely, as no James Bonny is noted in Captain Vincent Pearse&#x27;s list of pirates who took the Kings Pardon. No documentation outside of &quot;A General History&quot; even confirms there was a James Bonny, making it possible he is one of Johnsons fictional creations, similar to Captain Misson.

==John Rackham and Piracy==

While in Nassau, Bonny at some point met John &quot;Calico Jack&quot; Rackham. The nature of his relationship with her is unclear; &quot;A General History&quot; claims it was romantic, while her own trial transcript says nothing on the matter. She was likely well acquainted with Rackham by the year 1720, after the War of the Quadruple Alliance and two years into the reign of Governor Rogers.
In August 1720, Bonny, Rackham, and another woman, Mary Read, together with about a dozen other pirate crewmembers, stole the sloop &quot;William&quot;, then at anchor in Nassau harbor, and put out to sea. The crew spent months in the West Indies attacking merchant ships. Bonny took part in piracy alongside the men, handing out gunpowder to fellow pirates, a job usually referred to as a powder monkey. On 5 September 1720, Governor Rogers put out a proclamation later published in &quot;The Boston Gazette&quot;, demanding the arrest of Rackham and his associates. Among those named are Anne Bonny and Mary Read.
&quot;A General History&quot; claims Bonny eventually fell in love with another pirate on board, only to discover it was Mary Read. To abate the jealousy of Rackham, who suspected romantic involvement between the two, Bonny told him that Read was a woman and swore him to secrecy. This is unlikely, since Rogers&#x27; proclamation names both women openly. Later drawings of Bonny and Read would emphasise their femininity, although this too likely did not reflect reality.

A victim of the pirates, Dorothy Thomas of Jamaica, would describe in detail Bonny and Read&#x27;s appearance during their trial: They &quot;wore men&#x27;s jackets, and long trousers, and handkerchiefs tied about their heads: and ... each of them had a machete and pistol in their hands and they cursed and swore at the men to murder her [Dorothy Thomas].&quot; Thomas also recorded that she knew that they were women, &quot;from the largeness of their breasts.&quot;

==Capture and imprisonment==

On 22 October 1720, Rackham and his crew were attacked by a sloop captained by Jonathan Barnet under a commission from Nicholas Lawes, Governor of Jamaica. Rackham and his crew briefly resisted, but surrendered soon after the fight began. They were taken to Jamaica where in groups, they were tried for the crime of piracy. Rackham was tried on 16 November and found guilty. His execution at Port Royal was carried out two days later on the 18th.

Anne Bonny was tried for piracy alongside Mary Read in Spanish Town on 28 November. Like Rackham, the trial was short and the verdict inevitable. After calling three witnesses and a brief period of discussion, Governor Lawes found Bonny and Read guilty of piracy and sentenced them both to be hanged.

With the judgement pronounced, Bonny and Read both &quot;pleaded their bellies&quot;, asking for mercy, a jury of matrons likely granted them a stay of execution until they gave birth, but it is debatable if they were actually pregnant. Read died in prison of unknown causes around April 1721. A burial registry for Saint Catherine Parish lists her burial on 28 April 1721 as, &quot;Mary Read, Pirate&quot;.

==Fate==
There is no record of Bonny&#x27;s release, and this has fed speculation as to her fate. Johnson writes in &quot;A General History&quot; that: &quot;She was continued in Prison, to the Time of her lying in, and afterward reprieved from Time to Time; but what is become of her since we cannot tell; only this we know, that she was not executed&quot;.

Claims of Bonny being freed by family intervention and moving to the American colonies, dying around the 1780s, are unlikely and appear to originate from John Carlova&#x27;s &quot;Mistress of the Seas&quot;. Such claims were later amplified by Tamara Eastman and Constance Bond&#x27;s 2000 book &quot;The Pirate Trial of Anne Bonny and Mary Read&quot;, which claimed Bonny lived until 1782. The claim rested on &quot;family papers in the collection of descendants,&quot; which was later proven to be false.
A burial register in Spanish Town, where Bonny was tried, lists the burial of an &quot;Ann Bonny&quot; on 29 December 1733. This is notable but not conclusive evidence that Bonny never left Jamaica.

==Legacy==
Despite a career of only two months, Anne Bonny is among the most famous pirates in recorded history, primarily due to her gender. Within a decade, Bonny-inspired characters were already appearing. The first notable inspiration is Jenny Diver in John Gay&#x27;s Polly. Despite already appearing in Gay&#x27;s previous play The Beggars Opera, and being based on the historical Jenny Diver, her characterization in Polly is blatantly Bonny.

In the 19th century, literature such as Charles Ellms&#x27; &quot;Pirates Own Book&quot; would discuss Bonny at length, often with illustrations. An 1888 cigarette card would depict Bonny as a redhead, a trait that continues to this day despite no evidence supporting it. Swashbuckling cinema would often include a dashing redhaired woman or female pirate companion, occasionally directly naming Bonny.

By the 21st century, Bonny has appeared in hundreds of books, movies, stage shows, TV programs, and video games. Almost every female pirate character, is in some form, inspired by Anne Bonny.

===Speculation of Bonny&#x27;s Sexuality===

Since the mid 18th century, certain writers have claimed that Anne Bonny was the lesbian lover of Mary Read. This was never stated in the trial transcript or newspapers, and only begins to appear after much of Bonny&#x27;s legend was written, and by highly suspect sources.

The first written appearance of this claim is in an unauthorized 1725 reproduction of &quot;A General History&quot; titled, &quot;The History and Lives of All the Most Notorious Pirates and Their Crews&quot;. In the passage describing the trial of Bonny and Read, the book briefly says they were lovers. Since &quot;A General History&quot; is itself unreliable, this claim cannot be trusted. &quot;History and Lives&quot; would be the only book to claim Bonny and Read were lovers for almost a century. A chapbook knock off of &quot;History and Lives&quot; would again repeat the claim verbatim in 1813, but discussion of Bonny&#x27;s sexuality would only really begin in the 20th century.

This claim would briefly appear again in 1914, via sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld&#x27;s book, &quot;The Homosexuality of Men and Women&quot;. Much like &quot;History and Lives&quot;, it contains a mere one sentence claim that Mary Read was a lesbian.

The claim that Bonny and Read were lesbians largely entered popular understanding via radical feminist Susan Baker&#x27;s 1972 article, &quot;Anne Bonny &amp; Mary Read: They Killed Pricks&quot; published in a newspaper run by the lesbian separatist organization, The Furies Collective. This article would inspire writers such as Steve Gooch, which in turn would influence many media depictions.

In 2020, a statue of Bonny and Read was unveiled at Execution Dock in Wapping, London. The statues were created in part for the podcast series Hellcats, which centers on a lesbian relationship between Bonny and Read. The statues themselves are abstract depictions of Bonny and Read, claiming that one emotionally completed the other. It was originally planned for the statues to be permanently placed on Burgh Island in south Devon, but these plans were withdrawn after complaints of glamorizing piracy, and because Bonny and Read have no association with the island. The statues were eventually accepted by Lewes F.C.

Ultimately, it is impossible to determine if Anne Bonny was Mary Read&#x27;s lover. Neither woman left any primary sources behind, and sources such as the trial transcript make no mention of their personal lives.

<text>Ercole Antonio Mattioli (1 December 1640 – 1694) was an Italian politician, who was a minister of Duke Charles IV of Mantua. He was kidnapped and imprisoned by Louis XIV of France. He has been associated with the Man in the Iron Mask.

==Biography==
Mattioli was born at Valenza, in what is now the province of Alessandria. He worked as a minister of Charles IV, Duke of Mantua, who, as Marquess of Montferrat, possessed the strategic fortress of Casale Monferrato. Louis XIV wanted the fortress and was willing to purchase it for 100,000 crowns. Since a French occupation would be unpopular, secrecy was needed until the deal was finalised.

Mattioli successfully negotiated the trade and in gratitude, Louis XIV rewarded him lavishly. However, when the French were about to occupy the castle, Mattioli revealed the secret deal to the governments of Austria, Savoy, Spain and Venice, possibly for additional rewards. Louis XIV had to cancel the deal and withdraw though he eventually took control of Casale two years later.

In 1679, Louis XIV had his French envoy d&#x27;Estrades kidnap Mattioli and take him to France. There Mattioli was imprisoned in the fortress of Pinerolo, where he was eventually put into solitary confinement. By 1680 he was described as nearly mad. His manservant was also kidnapped and held with him.

Ercole Antonio Mattioli died in 1694 while incarcerated on the island of Sainte-Marguerite.

==Man in the Iron Mask==
Another prisoner at Pignerol was Eustache , the so-called Man in the Iron Mask, which some have said was actually made of black velvet cloth. was in the custody of a man named Saint-Mars and was held in the prisons of which Saint-Mars was governor.

It has been suggested that Mattioli himself was the masked prisoner, and this was a popular theory during much of the 19th century. Since the prisoner is known to have been buried under the name &quot;Marchioly&quot;, many believe that this is proof enough that he was the man in the mask. However, letters sent by Saint-Mars indicate that he was only held at Pignerol and Sainte-Marguerite; never at the Bastille, where the Man in the Iron Mask was held during the last years of his life.

<text>Kitsilano ( ) is a neighbourhood located in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Kitsilano is named after Squamish chief August Jack Khatsahlano, and the neighbourhood is located in Vancouver&#x27;s West Side along the south shore of English Bay, between the neighbourhoods of West Point Grey and Fairview. The area is mostly residential with two main commercial areas, West 4th Avenue and West Broadway, known for their retail stores, restaurants and organic food markets.

== History ==

=== Pre-colonial history ===
The area has been home to the Squamish people for thousands of years, sharing the territory with the Musqueam and the Tsleil-Waututh Peoples. All three Nations moved throughout their shared traditional territory, using the resources it provided for fishing, hunting, trapping and gathering.

=== Post-colonial history ===
The name &#x27;Kitsilano&#x27; is derived from , the Squamish name of chief August Jack Khatsahlano. 

In 1911, an amendment to the Indian Act by the federal government to legalize the unsettling of reserves stated that &quot;an Indian reserve which adjoins or is situated wholly or partly within an incorporated town or city having a population of [more] than eight thousand&quot;, could at the recommendation of the Superintendent General be removed without their consent if it was &quot;having regard to the interest of the public&quot; without the need for consent from the reserve&#x27;s residents. 

Subsequently, both provincial and federal governments began the &quot;unsettling of reserves&quot; process, which was the &quot;emptying&quot; of the reserves that &quot;be[came] a source of nuisance and an impediment to progress&quot;, or, in other words, the government unsettled reserves for growing cities and potential business ventures; and by the end of 1911 the reserve was sold to the Government of British Columbia. At this time in Canadian history, the federal government had already isolated the Indigenous population on to morsels of reserve lands, only to further deprive Indigenous peoples of what the government first thought was negligible land. 

The Squamish Nation formally surrendered the majority of reserve to the federal government in 1946. Part of the expropriated land was used by the Canadian Pacific Railway who pursued selling the land they had deed to in the 1980s despite the original agreement with the Squamish Nation that they should regain control of the land. This went to court, and in August 2002 the BC Court of Appeals upheld a lower court&#x27;s ruling in favour of the Squamish. This Indian reserve land is at the foot of the Burrard Street Bridge, called Senakw (commonly spelled Snauq historically) in the Squamish language, and sənaʔqʷ in the Musqueam people&#x27;s hən&#x27;q&#x27;əmin&#x27;əm&#x27; language, where August Jack Khatsahlano lived.

The forced relocation of the Musqueam Nation by the Canadian government resulted in a Musqueam Reserve created on the north arm of the Fraser River. The Squamish Nation was forcibly relocated to reserves on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, currently the cities North Vancouver and West Vancouver, as well as the False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6.

==== False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6 ====

The False Creek Indian Reserve No. 6, also known as the Kitsilano Indian Reserve, is an Indian Reserve developed by the colonial government in 1869. The reserve is located on the former site of a Squamish village, known as &quot;sən’a?qw&quot; in hən’q’emin’əm’, the language of the Musqueam people, and as &quot;Sen’ákw&quot; in Sḵwx̱wú7mesh sníchim, the language of the Squamish people. Inside the reserve there was a large longhouse that housed families, held potlach ceremonies, and became a central point of trade. The land appealed to its residents and attracted settlers by providing access to natural resources. It served as an important fishing area where inhabitants could set up tidal weirs of vine maple fencing and nettle fibre nets to catch fish. Additionally, the Squamish people cultivated an orchard as well as cherry trees on this land. Between 1869 and 1965, as the development of railway lines drew attention to the reserve, the Burrard Street Bridge and various leases began to occupy the reserve land. The land set aside for the Squamish people was continually appropriated until it was completely sold off. After decades of legal proceedings, the Squamish Nation reclaimed a small amount of the reserve land in 2002.

=== Settler history ===

The city&#x27;s streetcar lines used to have a &quot;loop&quot; at Arbutus &amp; Cornwall, which made &quot;Greer&#x27;s Beach&quot;, as the area first became known after the holdout settler who lived there, easy to get to from the new city, then still mostly contained on the downtown peninsula. With the opening of the Lulu Island Railway interurban line from Granville &amp; Pacific to Richmond via Seventh Avenue and Arbutus Street to Kerrisdale in the 1890s, more of Kitsilano was put within easy range of downtown and housing and commercial areas carved out of the forests and swamp. The lowland area beyond Macdonald, from 4th Avenue to King Edward, was known as Malaria Flats because of its swampy air. Like most of Vancouver, it had only a few decades before been covered in dense West Coast forest.

From the 1890s, the Vancouver Lawn Tennis Club in Granville Park became a trendy club for the local elite, hosting an annual Championship which attracted some nationally successful Canadian players.

Kitsilano was also the site of the second Sikh temple to be built in Canada, a few years after the first opened Golden in 1905. Opened in 1908, the temple served early South Asian settlers who worked at nearby sawmills along false creek at the time.

The area was an inexpensive neighbourhood to live in the 1960s and attracted many from the counterculture from across Canada and the United States and was known as one of the two hotbeds of the hippie culture in the city, the other being Gastown. However, the area became gentrified by &#x27;yuppies&#x27; in subsequent decades. Close proximity to downtown Vancouver, walking distance to parks, beaches and popular Granville Island has made the neighbourhood a very desirable community to live. One of the main concert venues in the city in the days of the counterculture was the Soft Rock Cafe (not to be confused with the Hard Rock Cafe), near 4th and Maple, later rebuilt into a modern shopping complex.

One remaining artifact of the 1960s is the Naam Cafe at 4th and Macdonald, providing vegetarian, vegan, and natural foods. The area is also known for having the first of certain kinds of restaurants, such as the California-style Topanga Cafe. Three of the first neighbourhood pub licenses in Vancouver are still located on 4th Avenue - Bimini&#x27;s at Maple (reopened after a fire in 2007), Darby D. Dawes at Macdonald, and Jerry&#x27;s Cove—the original name of Jericho—near Alma.

Greenpeace - founded in the home of Dorothy Stowe at 2775 Courtney Ave. in upper Point Grey near Pacific Spirit Regional Park and UBC - originally found a home in Kitsilano in the backroom of a small office on the SE corner of Broadway at Cypress, and shortly after that at 2007 4th Ave. and Maple (now 2009 due to address change), sharing the upstairs office with SPEC. The first offices of the Green Party of British Columbia were originally located in the home of longtime party leader Adriane Carr and her husband Paul George on Trafalgar Street, near 6th, in early 1983, before being moved by the summer of that year to offices near Broadway and Cypress, which also became the first offices of the Green Party of Canada.

== Geography ==
Like all of Vancouver, Kitsilano is located in traditional Coast Salish territory. The land that is currently known as Kitsilano has been shared by the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Watuth peoples since time immemorial. Thus, their traditional place names are valuable descriptors of this landscape. The area that is currently known as Point Grey is traditionally known as Chitchilayuk. Beaches now known as Spanish Banks is traditionally known as Pookcha, Jericho Beach is traditionally known as Eyalmo and E-Eyalmo, and Kitsilano Beach is traditionally known as Skwa-yoos. The area that is currently Sasamat Street was once known as Kokohpai, while the area of Bayswater Street was called Simsahmuls.

Kitsilano is located in the West Side of Vancouver, along the southern shore of English Bay, with Burrard Street as the neighborhood&#x27;s eastern boundary, Alma Street its western boundary, and 16th Avenue its southern boundary.

Adjacent neighbourhoods include the West End northeast across the Burrard Bridge and False Creek, Fairview directly to the east, Shaughnessy to the southeast, Arbutus Ridge directly south, Dunbar-Southlands southwest, and West Point Grey directly west.

== Demographics ==
As of 2016, Kitsilano has 43,045 people. 13.3% of the population is under the age of 20; 40.1% is between 20 and 39; 32.8% is between 40 and 64; and 13.8% is 65 or older. 74.2% of Kitsilano residents speak English as a first language, 5.6% speak a Chinese language, 2.6% speak French and 0.2% speaking hən&#x27;q&#x27;əmin&#x27;əm. The median household income is $72,839 and 14.7% of its population lives in low-income households. The unemployment rate is 5.2%.

== Culture &amp; recreation ==
Notable landmarks in Kitsilano include the Burrard Bridge, Kitsilano Beach, and the Museum of Vancouver/H. R. MacMillan Space Centre. The Museum of Vancouver has gained several pieces of Northwest Coast from Indigenous artists. Much of the work is displayed in a wide variety of mediums to showcase the Indigenous culture that surrounds this city.

The neighborhood has played host to a number of annual events such as the Vancouver International Children&#x27;s Festival, the Bard on the Beach outdoor Shakespeare festival, and the Celebration of Light fireworks competition. Indigenous murals can be seen as the connection between the City of Reconciliation and the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations. The goal is to expose the public to the culturally contemporary Indigenous artists that are present in today&#x27;s society.

Kitsilano is home to a number of Vancouver&#x27;s annual festivals and events:

* Each June, Greek Day is an annual street festival celebrating Greek culture and cuisine along several blocks of Greek West Broadway, which is Vancouver&#x27;s Greektown.
* Vanier Park is home to the Vancouver International Children&#x27;s Festival (at Granville Island as of 2014) and &quot;Bard on the Beach&quot;, the outdoor Shakespeare festival.
* The Celebration of Light is held on the waters of English Bay between Vanier Park and the West End.
* The Khatsahlano Street Party is held on 4th Avenue on a July Saturday.

=== Parks and beaches ===
Kitsilano is home to 17 parks, which include six playgrounds, an off-leash dog park, and Kitsilano Beach, one of Vancouver&#x27;s most popular beaches. Along with the beach itself, Kitsilano Beach Park also contains a franchise restaurant, Kitsilano Pool, and the Kitsilano Showboat. The Kitsilano Showboat, operating since 1935, is essentially an open-air amphitheatre with the ocean and mountains as a backdrop. All summer long, the showboat hosts free performances from local bands, dance groups, and other performers. Its main goal is to entertain residents and tourists, showcasing amateur talent. It is located on the south side of the Kitsilano Pool along Cornwall Avenue. Weather permitting, shows typically start at 7:30 p.m. on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. Beatrice Leinbach, or Captain Bea, has been playing a role in maintaining the showboat since the mid-1940s. As of 2006, she is the president of the non-profit Kitsilano Showboat Society.

As of September 2018, there was an attempt to reconcile with the Indigenous communities whose land was taken during the expansion of Vancouver. By renaming the beaches and parks, one of which included Kitsilano Beach, Stuart Mackinnon park board chairman was going to work with the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations to rename those areas after their original Indigenous names. However, the Indigenous community replied by saying the original areas were not named previously, because they were only forests before colonization. As of today no beaches or parks, including Kitsilano Beach have been renamed in the hən&#x27;q&#x27;əmin&#x27;əm&#x27; (Musqueam Halkomelem) or Skwxwú7mesh Snichim (Squamish language).

Vanier Park is another one of Kitsilano&#x27;s most popular parks, and is the location of the Museum of Vancouver, the H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, the Vancouver Maritime Museum, as well as the public art installations &quot;Gate to the Northwest Passage&quot; by artist Alan Chung Hung and &quot;Freezing Water #7&quot; by Jun Ren.

=== Buildings ===
Landmark buildings in Kitsilano include the Burrard Bridge, a five-lane, Art Deco style, steel truss bridge constructed in 1930-1932 connecting downtown Vancouver with Kitsilano via connections to Burrard Street on both ends, as well as several historic sites such as the Museum of Vancouver and H. R. MacMillan Space Centre, St. Roch National Historic Site of Canada, Kitsilano Secondary School, General Gordon Elementary School and the Bessborough Armoury. Busy Macdonald Street and some quiet, leafy adjoining streets still have some 1910s–1920s craftsman houses that cannot be found anywhere else in Vancouver. According to Exploring Vancouver, an architectural guide to the city: 

== Government ==
Kitsilano is situated within the Canadian federal electoral districts of Vancouver Quadra and Vancouver Centre, currently held by Joyce Murray and Hedy Fry, respectively. Both are members of the Liberal Party of Canada. Provincially, Kitsilano lies within the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia electoral districts of Vancouver-Point Grey, Vancouver-Fairview, and Vancouver-False Creek. Vancouver-Point Grey is currently held by David Eby of the BC NDP, Vancouver-Fairview by fellow BC NDP member George Heyman, and Vancouver-False Creek by BC NDP member Brenda Bailey.

<text>The Dungeness crab (Metacarcinus magister) makes up one of the most important seafood industries along the west coast of North America. Its typical range extends from Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands to Point Conception, near Santa Barbara, California. Dungeness typically grow at their widest point and inhabit eelgrass beds and sandy bottoms. Its common name comes from the Dungeness Spit in the Strait of Juan de Fuca, Washington state, United States, which shelters a shallow bay inhabited by the crabs.

==Description==
Dungeness crabs have four pairs of armored legs, two claws, and a wide, hard shell. A Dungeness&#x27;s legs are shorter compared to other commercial crabs and their claws have a distinctive hook. The claws of the crab are used both as defense and to tear apart large food items. The crab uses its smaller appendages to pass the food particles into its mouth. Once inside the crab&#x27;s stomach, food is further digested by the &quot;gastric mill&quot;, a collection of tooth-like structures . 

Crabs must periodically molt to grow; this process is called ecdysis. Molting has the ability to regenerate lost limbs, although they will be smaller the first molt after loss. During a molt&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; the shell will separate where the carapace and abdomen meet. This allows the crab to exit the old shell. Once outside the old shell the soft new shell will fill with water and the crab will become 15-25% bigger than its original size. During the first few weeks after molting, the crab is very vulnerable due to the softness of its shell; the shell will not fully harden for two months after molting. For the first two years of a crab&#x27;s life, it will molt six times a year. In the third year&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; males molt twice and females molt once. After that, all crabs will molt once a year, with females molting in the spring and males molting in the summer. Dungeness typically live five years and measure at the end of their life. However, the crabs can live up to eight years on the west coast of the US and have been seen to reach 13 years in the northern reaches of their range. At these ages, maximum female size can be up to and maximum male size up to .

&quot;M. magister&quot; prefers to eat clams, other crustaceans, and small fish, but is also an effective scavenger. Their scavenging habits can even lead them to eat other Dungeness.

A genetic analysis of adult Dungeness crabs indicated that there is one population across the California Current System, but it is likely that interannual variation in physical oceanographic conditions (such as ocean circulation patterns) influence larval recruitment among regions, causing genetic diversity to change through time.

==Life cycle ==

Mature female crabs generally molt in late spring, although exact timing varies with location. Mating occurs immediately after the female has molted and before the new exoskeleton hardens. Males are able to detect when females are molting, presumably through pheromones although this is not confirmed yet. Each mating season, male crabs may mate with many partners. Upon locating an available female, the male initiates a protective premating embrace that lasts for several days. In this embrace, the female is tucked underneath the male, oriented such that their abdomens touch and their heads face each other. The sperm deposited by the male is stored in the spermatheca and all sperm can be stored for up to two and a half years. This means a female may choose to use older sperm or not to mate at all during a given year. Fertilization occurs from October to December when eggs are deposited into the adnominal flap of the female. The females extrude the fertilized eggs and hold them in specialized hair located on their tail flap. Dungeness eggs are at first bright orange and darken as they develop. A single female can hold up to 2 million eggs depending on her size; females that use older sperm will carry fewer eggs. In the winter, a female crab will bury herself in the sand and become inactive in order to protect her eggs. Eggs typically hatch in the spring, although exact time varies with location.

Young crabs are free-swimming after hatching and are diel vertical migrators that can be found at depths up to during the day. The crabs go through five zoeal larval stages and one megalops stage before settling to the bottom in their first juvenile stage. The free-swimming stages typically take three months to four months, although in Alaska crabs may remain larvae for up to a year. Sexual maturity is reached after about 12 molts or two years. The crab&#x27;s typical lifespan is 8-13 years.

==Habitat==
Dungeness are most often found in areas with sandy bottoms but can be found on a wide variety of bottom types. The crabs are found in high density from the intertidal zone to a depth of between . Individual Dungeness have been found as deep as . Adult Dungeness require water with surface temperatures ranging from and salinity ranging from 11 to 35 practical salinity units (PSU). Larvae are much more sensitive to such environmental conditions as salinity and require temperatures of between .

The typical range of the Dungeness extends from Alaska&#x27;s Aleutian Islands to Point Conception, near Santa Barbara, California. Occasionally, the crab can be found as far south as Magdalena Bay, Baja California Sur, Mexico.

== Fishery ==
The Dungeness fishery was started by San Francisco fishermen in 1848. By the early 1900s the fishery had expanded to match the entire range of the crabs. Around this time regulations were put in place to allow only hard-shelled male crabs that were at least inches at their widest point. Similar regulations are still followed today.

In all areas where Dungeness are fished a license is required for harvest whether it is commercial or recreational. Commercially in Oregon and Washington&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; a logbook that is to be turned in at the end of the season is additionally required. Trip limits (how many crabs someone can take in one day) and pot limits (how many pots someone can have in the water at once) are set for both commercial and recreational crabbing in all areas. In Washington state&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; bi-weekly crab condition testing occurs and if the crabs are found to be too soft shelled, the limits will be reduced. The crabbing season is generally open from November or December to late August or early September. Crabbing is closed in the fall to protect soft-shelled crabs.

Some recreational fishermen use crab rings or hoops to harvest Dungeness. These hoops sit flat on the bottom and are pulled up periodically, trapping any crabs in the hoop at the moment. Most crabs, however, are caught in wire pots attached to a small buoy. Pots are baited in the center and have one way door flaps for the crabs to enter through. Crab pots in all regions are required to have biodegradable rot cord attaching the pot and the buoy in case they are lost. Pots in Alaska are additionally required to be made with biodegradable twine so that the pot will fall apart if lost. In pots of all regions&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; escape rings are required to allow the escape of undersized and female crabs. In California, Oregon, and Washington these are required to be ; in Alaska rings are required to be ; in Canada they are required to be . Pots are typically set in waters deep. 

The legal size of crabs is in California, Oregon, and Washington for commercial fisheries and in Alaska and Canada. In recreational fisheries, the minimum size in California and Oregon is , while Washington is . In Alaska, Washington, Oregon, and California (commercial) fisheries, only male crabs are allowed to be harvested. Crabs typically reach legal size at three to five years depending on location (Alaska has much slower growth).

The Dungeness fishery has been closed in the Cook Inlet, Alaska, since 1991&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; Yakutat, Alaska and the Prince William Sound, Alaska since 2000&lt;ins&gt;;&lt;/ins&gt; and the southern region of the Puget Sound, Washington since 2018. In Alaska&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; these closures are due to population decreases likely caused by increased otter predation and environmental shifts. In Washington state, the closures are due to population decreases caused by unknown factors.

== Sustainability ==
It is estimated that every season since 1970 the fishery has taken 9-98% of the legal-sized male population with an average of 66% a year. The majority of this catch is caught in the first six weeks of the season. Despite this, the fishery has had a stable mean catch for over thirty years indicating populations are not overfished. This is likely due to the regulations put in place that allow crabs at least one year of sexual maturity before capture. Although 143 crabs are thrown back for every 100 kept, the trapping and subsequent throwing back of non-legal Dungeness does not seem to cause an overabundance of harm to the population. Soft-shelled crabs have been shown to have the highest mortality rates at just 9-25%.

Due to catch averages staying consistent&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; it is assumed populations are healthy, but in reality very little is known about Dungeness crab populations. In California, Alaska, and Washington&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; research is minimal and information about populations is assumed from catch records. In Canada&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; two out of seven crabbing areas are examined twice every year. The other areas are studied inconsistently and usually in relation to specific research questions. In Oregon, monitoring programs are in place for mating success, genetic structure, population structure, and discard mortality.

The effect of the fishery on other species is variable. The effects on benthic species and bycatch are relatively unknown, although the effect&lt;ins&gt;s&lt;/ins&gt; are assumed to be negligible for both. In Alaska and Canada there is no known effect on any other species. In Washington, Oregon, and California&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; humpback whales are known to be highly affected with a high of 19 humpbacks entangled in crabbing line in 2016. In California&lt;ins&gt;,&lt;/ins&gt; leatherback turtles, orcas, and blue whales have also been known to be impacted. In recent years entanglements of all species have increased; this is attributed to increased reporting and changes in these species&#x27; migration due to changes in prey abundance as a result of climate change. It is important to note that entanglements are lower than they could be due to the timing of the crabbing season: the first six weeks of the crabbing season (when most fishing occurs) happens before the migration of many species. The high seen in 2016 was likely due to a late opening of the season because of toxic algal blooms.

Ghost fishing from lost equipment is a problem in the industry, the scale of which is generally unknown. It is estimated that 10-20% of gear is lost each year with 7.5-32.5% of that ghost fishing. Ghost fishing can entangle marine mammals, cause crab death, and harm the ecosystem. Additionally, lost gear may ghost fish in places far from their original spots due to currents and tides; buoys from lost pots in Oregon were recovered four years later in the Hawaiian islands.

Overall, Seafood Watch has given the Dungeness crab a sustainable seafood rating of &quot;Good Alternative&quot; meaning they are okay to buy but be sure to be aware of potential concerns.

==Culinary use==
The Dungeness crab is considered a delicacy in the United States and Canada. Long before the area was settled by Europeans, Indigenous peoples throughout the crustacean&#x27;s range had the crab as a traditional part of their diet and harvested them every year at low tide. The flesh has what is considered to be a delicate flavor and slightly sweet taste. Today they are an integral part of the cuisines of California, British Columbia, and the Pacific Northwest and traditionally feature in dishes like Crab Louie or Cioppino.

About one-quarter of the crab&#x27;s weight is meat. Dungeness crabs can typically be purchased either live or cooked. A humane way to kill a live crab is to: 1) stun the crab by submerging it in ice water for several minutes, 2) flip the crab onto its back, and 3) drive the tip of a small pick about an inch below the center of its mouth. However, many cook live crabs by simply dropping them into boiling salt water. The crab then is allowed to cook for 15 minutes, after which time the crabs are removed and placed into cold water to cool and then cleaned. Cleaning the crab consists of removing the shell, scooping out the gills and intestines, and separating the legs and claws from the body. When removing the shell there will be a yellow substance, this is called crab fat and is used in many dishes. Another method of preparing crab is called half backing. Half backing is done by flipping the crab upside down and chopping it in half (from head to &quot;tail&quot;), after which the guts and gills can be scooped or hosed out. Many consider half backing to be superior to cooking the entire crab, because the meat is not contaminated by the flavor or toxins of the guts. Furthermore, half backed crabs boil faster or can be quickly steamed instead of boiled. Some common tools for removing crab meat from the shell are a crab cracker and a shrimp fork.

== Threats ==
In some areas adult Dungeness crabs can be found in or near estuaries. The hyposaline conditions of the estuaries are lethal to some of the crab&#x27;s symbionts, such as &quot;Carcinonemertes errans&quot; which consumes a brooding female&#x27;s live eggs. Dungeness crabs surveyed in Coos Bay were less likely to be infected by &quot;C. errans&quot; and have fewer worms present on their carapace when inhabiting less saline waters farther inland. 

A 2020 study funded by NOAA showed that larval crabs are being affected by ocean acidification.&quot; Another potential harm related to global warming is red tides.

Another threat to the Dungeness crab is a invasive species called the European Green Crab. The green crab outcompetes the Dungeness Crab for food and habitat.

==Celebrations of the Dungeness crab==
In 2009, after lobbying from school children at Sunset Primary School in West Linn, Oregon, and citing its importance to the Oregon economy, the Oregon Legislative Assembly designated the Dungeness crab as the state crustacean of Oregon. In 2024, California governor Gavin Newsom signed legislation designating the Dungeness crab as California&#x27;s official state crustacean. The 2022-23 crab season brought revenue of about $54.4 million to the California economy.

The annual Dungeness Crab Festival is held in Port Angeles, Washington, each October.

<text>The common eland (Taurotragus oryx), also known as the southern eland or eland antelope, is a large-sized savannah and plains antelope found in East and Southern Africa. An adult male is around tall at the shoulder and can weigh up to with a typical range of . Females are around tall and weigh . It is the second-largest antelope in the world, being slightly smaller on average than the giant eland. It was scientifically described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1766.

Mainly a herbivore, its diet is primarily grasses and leaves. Common elands form herds of up to 500 animals, but are not territorial. The common eland prefers habitats with a wide variety of flowering plants such as savannah, woodlands, and open and montane grasslands; it avoids dense forests. It uses loud barks, visual and postural movements, and the flehmen response to communicate and warn others of danger. The common eland is used by humans for leather, and meat and has been domesticated in southern Africa. Eland milk contains more butterfat than cow&#x27;s milk, and can keep longer without pasteurising.

It is native to Angola, Botswana, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Rwanda, South Africa, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, but is no longer present in Burundi. While the common eland&#x27;s population is decreasing, it is classified as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

==Etymology==
The scientific name of the common eland is &quot;Taurotragus oryx&quot;, composed of three words: &quot;tauros&quot;, &quot;tragos&quot;, and &quot;oryx&quot;. &quot;Tauros&quot; is Greek for a bull or bullock, meaning the same as the Latin &quot;taurus&quot;. &quot;Tragos&quot; is Greek for a male goat, referring to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland&#x27;s ear and its resemblance to a goat&#x27;s beard. &quot;Oryx&quot; is Latin and Greek (genitive: &quot;orygos&quot;) for pickaxe, referring to the pointed horns of North African antelopes like the common eland and scimitar-horned oryx.

The name &quot;eland&quot; is Afrikaans for &quot;elk&quot; or &quot;moose&quot;, from Dutch &quot;eland&quot;, from obsolete German &quot;Elend&quot;, probably from obsolete Lithuanian &quot;ellenis&quot;. When Dutch settlers came to the Cape of Good Hope, creating the Dutch Cape Colony, they named the animal after the large, herbivorous moose. In Dutch, the animal is called &quot;eland antelope&quot; to distinguish it from the moose, which is found in the northern boreal forests.

==Physical description==
Common elands are spiral-horned antelopes. They are sexually dimorphic, with females being smaller than the males. Females weigh , measure from the snout to the base of the tail and stand at the shoulder. Bulls weigh , are from the snout to the base of the tail and stand at the shoulder. The tail is long. Male elands can weigh up to .
Their coat differs geographically, with elands in northern part of their range having distinctive markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have a tan coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls may also have a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.

Both sexes have horns with a steady spiral ridge (resembling that of the bushbuck). The horns are visible as small buds in newborns and grow rapidly during the first seven months. The horns of males are thicker and shorter than those of females (males&#x27; horns are long and females&#x27; are long), and have a tighter spiral. Males use their horns during rutting season to wrestle and butt heads with rivals, while females use their horns to protect their young from predators.

The common eland is the slowest antelope, with a peak speed of that tires them quickly. However, they can maintain a trot indefinitely. Elands are capable of jumping up to from a standing start when startled (up to for young elands). The common eland&#x27;s life expectancy is generally between 15 and 20 years; in captivity, some live up to 25 years.

Eland herds are accompanied by a loud clicking sound that has been subject to considerable speculation. The weight of the animal may cause the two halves of its hooves to splay apart, and the clicking is the result of the hoof snapping together when the animal raises its leg. The sound carries some distance from a herd, and may be a form of communication.

==Taxonomy==

The common eland was first described in 1766 by German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas. It belongs to the order Artiodactyla, family Bovidae, and subfamily Bovinae. Common elands are sometimes considered part of the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; on the basis of molecular phylogenetics, but are usually categorized as &quot;Taurotragus&quot;, along with the giant eland (&quot;T. derbianus&quot;).

===Subspecies===
Three subspecies of common elands have been recognized, though their validity has been disputed.

* T. o. oryx (Pallas, 1766; Cape eland): also called &quot;alces&quot;, &quot;barbatus&quot;, &quot;canna&quot; and &quot;oreas&quot;. It is found in Southern and southwestern Africa. The fur is tawny and adults lose their stripes.
* T. o. livingstonii (Sclater, 1864; Livingstone&#x27;s eland): also called &quot;kaufmanni&quot;, &quot;niediecki&quot;, &quot;selousi&quot; and &quot;triangularis&quot;. It is found in the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands. Livingstone&#x27;s eland has brown fur with up to 12 stripes.
* T. o. pattersonianus (Lydekker, 1906; East African eland or Patterson&#x27;s eland): also called &quot;billingae&quot;. It is found in East Africa, hence its common name. Like Livingstone&#x27;s eland, its fur can also have up to 12 stripes.
:Found by and named after John Henry Patterson, who describes the specimen in &quot;The Man-eaters of Tsavo&quot; (1907).
==Genetics and evolution==
Male elands have 31 diploid chromosomes and females have 32. The male (Y) chromosome has been translocated to the short arm of an autosome. Both the X chromosome and Y chromosome replicate late; they do not match well and are variable. The chromosomes resemble those of the greater kudu (&quot;Tragelaphus strepsiceros&quot;).

Male elands and female greater kudus can produce a viable male hybrid, though whether it is sterile is unknown. An accidental crossing of an East African common eland (&quot;T. o. &quot;&#x27;) with an East African kudu (&quot;T. s. bea&quot;) occurred in the San Diego Zoo Safari Park. This was believed to be due to the absence of male kudus in the herd. The hybrid produced was sterile. The study confirmed the chromosome numbers of both the eland and the kudu and the strangeness of their attached Y chromosomes. Attempt matings of male elands with domestic (&quot;Bos primigenius&quot;) and zebu cows (&quot;Bos indicus&quot;) indicated the species are not able to interbreed. Female elands have acted as surrogates for bongos.

The Bovidae family ancestors of the common eland arose approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France, but the best records are in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear six million years ago during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (&quot;Taurotragus arkelli&quot;) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first &quot;T. oryx&quot; fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria.

In 2010, a genetic study was made basing on the evolutionary history of common elands. Using material from East and Southern Africa, analysis of mitochondrial DNA control-region fragments from 122 individuals revealed information concerning the phylogeography, genetic diversity, and demographic history of the species. The conclusions supported the presence of a long-standing population in the southern Africa and a mosaic of Pleistocene refugia in eastern Africa. The similarity of dates obtained from other studies indicates a significant genetic event around 200 ka.

==Habitat and distribution==

Common elands live on the open plains of Southern Africa and along the foothills of the great southern African plateau. The species extends north into Ethiopia and most arid zones of South Sudan, west into eastern Angola and Namibia, and south to South Africa. However, a low density of elands exists in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.

Elands prefer to live in semiarid areas that contain many shrub-like bushes, and often inhabit grasslands, woodlands, subdesert, bush, and mountaintops with altitudes of about . Elands do, however, avoid forests, swamps and deserts. The places inhabited by elands generally contain &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Combretum&quot;, &quot;Commiphora&quot;, &quot;Diospyros&quot;, &quot;Grewia&quot;, &quot;Rhus&quot;, and &quot;Ziziphus&quot; trees and shrubs; some of these also serve as their food.

Eland can be found in many national parks and reserves today, including Nairobi National Park and Tsavo East National Park, Tsavo West National Park, Masai Mara National Reserve, (Kenya); Serengeti National Park, Ruaha National Park and Tarangire National Park, Ngorongoro Crater, (Tanzania); Kagera National Park (Rwanda); Nyika National Park (Malawi); Lake Mburo National Park (Uganda); Kidepo Valley National Park (Uganda); Luangwa Valley and Kafue National Park (Zambia); Hwange National Park, Matobo National Park, Tuli Safari Area and Chimanimani Eland Sanctuary (Zimbabwe); Kruger National Park, Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park, Giant&#x27;s Castle and Suikerbosrand NR (South Africa).

They live on home ranges that can be 200–400 km2 for females and juveniles and 50 km2 for males.

==Ecology and behavior==

Common elands are nomadic and crepuscular. They eat in the morning and evening, rest in shade when hot, and remain in sunlight when cold. They are commonly found in herds numbering up to 500, with individual members remaining in the herd from several hours to several months. Juveniles and mothers tend to form larger herds, while males may separate into smaller groups or wander individually. During estrus, mainly in the rainy season, groups tend to form more regularly. In Southern Africa, common elands will often associate with herds of zebras, roan antelopes and oryxes.

Common elands communicate via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues, and display behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males in response to contact with female urine or genitals. Females urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, as well as to indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they bark and attempt to attract the attention of others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African wild dogs, cheetahs, and spotted hyenas. Eland calves are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.

===Diet=== 

Common elands are herbivores that browse during drier winter, but have also adapted to grazing during the rainy season when grasses are more common and nutritious. They require a high-protein diet of succulent leaves from flowering plants, but will consume lower-quality plant material if available, including forbs, trees, shrubs, grasses, seeds, and tubers. Grasses that elands eat include &quot;Setaria&quot; and &quot;Themeda&quot; and fruits from &quot;Securinega&quot; and &quot;Strychnos&quot;. Large antelope can survive on lower-quality food in times of little rain. 

Most of their water is obtained from their food, though they drink water when available. As they quickly adjust to the surroundings due to seasonal changes and other causes, they change their feeding habits. They also use their horns to break off branches that are hard to reach.

=== Thermoregulation ===
Common elands have several thermoregulatory adaptations to help them withstand the extreme temperatures of their environments. Using peripheral thermal receptors on the skin, elands can sense heat and increase or decrease evaporative cooling accordingly. On sunnier days, common elands maintain a cooler skin temperature relative to their inner body temperature. Elands achieve cooler skin temperatures by increasing cutaneous evaporation. This allows them to feel cooler, even though their internal body temperature stays relatively the same throughout the day. The eland can also conserve water by increasing its body temperature. When temperatures rise above a certain threshold, an increase in sweating and panting is also observed. Common elands use their sparse fur coats to dissipate excess heat via reradiation. The dewlap is also believed to play a role in thermoregulation. Due to its high surface area to volume ratio, it may allow for efficient thermoregulation in larger common elands with larger dewlaps.

===Sociability and reproduction===

Females are sexually mature at 15 to 36 months and males at 4 to 5 years. Mating may occur anytime after reaching sexual maturity, but is mostly seen in the rainy season. In Zambia, young are born in July and August, while elsewhere this is the mating season. Mating begins when elands gather to feed on lush, green plains with plentiful grass, and some males and females start mating with each other in separate pairs. Males chase the females to find out if they are in estrus. They also test the female&#x27;s urine. Usually, a female chooses the most dominant and fit male to mate with. Sometimes, she runs away from males trying to mate, causing more attraction. This results in fights between males, in which their hard horns are used. A female allows a male to mount after two to four hours. Males usually keep close contact with females in the mating period. The dominant male can mate with more than one female. Females have a gestation period of nine months, and give birth to only one calf each time.

Males, females, and juveniles each form separate social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together and search for food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group, while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they are at least two years old and join a male or female group.

===Diseases and parasites===
Common elands are resistant to trypanosomiasis, a protozoan infection that has the tsetse fly as a vector, but not to the &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot;-transmitted disease theileriosis. The disease-causing bacterium &quot;Theileria taurotragi&quot; has caused many eland deaths. &quot;Clostridium chauvoei&quot;, another bacterium, can be harmful, as well. Elands are also hosts to several kinds of ticks. In one study, an eland was found to be host to the &quot;Amblyomma&quot; species &quot;A. gemma&quot; and &quot;A. variegatum&quot;, and &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot; species &quot;R. decoloratus&quot;, &quot;R. appendiculatus&quot;, &quot;R. evertsi&quot;, &quot;R. pulchellus&quot; and &quot;R. pravus&quot;. Elands produce antibodies for &quot;Brucella&quot; bacteria, but none for &quot;Mycobacterium paratuberculosis&quot; or various types of pneumonia like contagious bovine pneumonia and contagious caprine pneumonia, normally infectious in cows or antelopes.

==Interaction with humans==
===Conservation===

Currently, common elands are not endangered. They are conserved by the United States Endangered Species Act, and regulated in international trade by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. A 2016 assessment for the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List estimates the number of mature individuals to be 90,000-110,000, with populations considered stable or increasing in the countries of Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Malawi, Kenya and Tanzania.

The population is, however, gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, caused by expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat. As they are docile and inactive most of the time, they can easily be killed. The species became extinct in Eswatini and Zimbabwe, but has been reintroduced.

The IUCN states that about half of the estimated total population lives in protected areas and 30% on private land. Protected areas that support major populations include Omo (Ethiopia), Serengeti, Katavi, Ruaha, and Selous-Kilombero (Tanzania), Kafue and North Luangwa (Zambia), Nyika (Malawi), Etosha (Namibia), Kgalagadi Transfrontier Park (Botswana/South Africa) and Ukhahlamba Drakensberg Park (South Africa). Most of these populations appear to be stable. Relatively large numbers of common elands now live on private land, particularly in Namibia, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, reflecting its value as a trophy animal. Common elands have also been widely domesticated in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Kenya, Russia, and Ukraine.

===Uses===

The common eland is sometimes farmed and hunted for its meat, and in some cases can be better used than cattle because it is more suited to African climates. This has led to some Southern African farmers switching from cattle to eland. Common elands are also pictured as supporters in the coat of arms of Grootfontein, Namibia.

===Husbandry===
Common elands have a mild temperament and have been successfully domesticated for meat and milk production in South Africa and Russia. Their need for water is quite low because they produce urine with a high urea content, but they require a substantial grazing area, along with salt licks and large amounts of supplementary feed such as maize, sorghum, melons, and beans, which can be expensive. A female can produce up to of milk per day that is richer in milkfat than cow milk. The pleasant-tasting milk has a butterfat content of 11-17% and can be stored for up to eight months if properly prepared, versus several days for cow milk.

Housing common elands is difficult due to their ability to jump over fences as high as or simply break through using their substantial mass. Sometimes, wild elands break through enclosures to mix with domesticated ones. Common elands can reproduce in captivity, but calf survival is low and the young may need to be separated from their mothers to ensure health and adequate feeding. Husbandry requires care because the generally placid animals startle easily and require large amounts of space.

<doc id="934213" wikidata="Q3263902" url="?curid=934213" title="David Armstrong Extreme Park">
<text>The David Armstrong Extreme Park, formerly called the Louisville Extreme Park, is a 40,000 square foot (3,700 m2) public skatepark located near downtown Louisville, Kentucky, United States, in the Butchertown neighborhood. It opened on April 5, 2002, and gained national recognition after the release of Tony Hawk&#x27;s Gigantic Skatepark Tour, in which the park was featured. The park was designed with the input of a local task force. The public skatepark is owned by Louisville Metro Government and operated by Metro Parks.

In 2014, about one-third of the park was demolished, to be followed by the rebuilding of facilities on adjacent property, to make way for flyover ramps to support the new Abraham Lincoln Bridge. The rebuild was completed on April 14, 2015, where the park was dedicated in former Louisville Mayor David L. Armstrong&#x27;s honor.

In 2023, it was announced that the park would be closing at 11PM every night, transitioning to a limited operating schedule for the first time since the park opened. This was a response to a rise in criminal activity and increased need for police presence at the park during late-night hours. At this time, several cameras were installed to enforce the curfew, and better monitor the park during operating hours.

==Park features==
The park is known for its full pipe, but it also has other features, including two bowls, two bowls, two bowls, a bowl, a few fun boxes, a street course, a flat bank, several ledges, rails, and endless lines. It also has a wooden vert ramp with a extension. There are also publicly accessible restrooms and emergency telephones.

<doc id="934227" wikidata="Q1391814" url="?curid=934227" title="Commercial Drive, Vancouver">
<text>Commercial Drive is a roadway in the city of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, that extends from Powell Street at its northern extremity, near the waterfront, south through the heart of the Grandview–Woodland neighbourhood to the Victoria Diversion near Trout Lake. The neighbourhood is so dominated by the businesses, cultural facilities, and residents along Commercial Drive that the area is far better known as &quot;The Drive&quot; than by the civic boundaries. The district is one of Vancouver&#x27;s Business Improvement Areas (BIA).

The district is served by many different bus routes, as well as both the SkyTrain&#x27;s Expo Line and Millennium Line at Commercial–Broadway Station.

Commercial Drive is a mixed residential-commercial area with a high proportion of ethnic and vegetarian restaurants, businesses, and public housing. The area has low property prices compared to the westside of Vancouver, yet has good city services and is a local transit hub. It has been the destination for generations of immigrants to Vancouver and has significant Italian, Asian, Latin America, East Indian, and African communities. As of the Canada 2001 Census, English is a minority language in Grandview-Woodland, though still the most common.

Commercial Drive has many local ethnic stores and community groups, Edwardian-style heritage buildings, European-style cafes, bars, and alternative shops and entertainment venues. As of late August 2007, there are 93 restaurants on Commercial Drive between Venables and Broadway, of which 19 are coffee bars.

It is home to an active street festival culture; notable annual events include the Vancouver Dyke March in August and the Parade of Lost Souls in October. It also plays host to Vancouver&#x27;s only queer spoken word and musician performance night, Unsweetened (and Outspoken).

==History==
The Drive was originally a skid road for dragging logs to the harbour. It was named &quot;Park Drive&quot; but renamed &quot;Commercial Drive&quot; in 1911, possibly to avoid confusion with other Park Drives in Vancouver. Commercial Drive ends in the south at 16th Avenue,
the former end of Vancouver/start of City of South Vancouver, when it diverts to Victoria Diversion and eventually Victoria Drive. A limited light industrial Commercial Street carries on to 22nd Avenue, and around the Selkirk school there, until 54th Avenue as a residential street.

During the pre-World War One period, a number of speculators—including McSpadden and Odlum (both of whom have nearby streets named for them) -- attempted to turn the Grandview neighbourhood, centered on the Drive, into a real estate area comparable to the West End and the newly opened Shaughnessy Heights. The global financial collapse around 1913 put an end to their hopes.

After World War II many Italian immigrants settled in eastern Vancouver, and the northern part of Commercial Drive came to be known as &quot;Little Italy&quot;. A sizable Portuguese community came to the area as well. During the 1960s, immigration from Asian countries began to dilute the European influence. A wave of Latino immigrants came in the 1980s as a result of the turmoil and civil wars in Central America. Many came from the Mercosur Republics of South America as well. Vietnamese nationals also immigrated here.

Throughout the 1980s, The Drive attracted a large counter-culture demographic, including political activists and punks. Around the turn of the millennium, local outlets of multi-national companies became the target of the anti-globalization movement and civil disobedience campaigns. SkyTrain opened into the neighbourhood with Broadway Station in December 1985. Increasing real estate prices near the downtown (e.g. Downtown Eastside) pushed many lower-income residents east toward Commercial Drive. Meanwhile, gentrification began to occur in the vicinity of the Drive, increasing housing prices, and driving housing development and new storefronts replacing old wood-frame stores.

In 2002, many restaurant owners were upset with the infamous &quot;dancing police&quot;; bylaw enforcement officers who ticketed establishments hosting any dancing to live music. In late 2004, Commercial Drive gained national notoriety when the media complained that several cafes there were openly selling marijuana. As of 2005, there are still very few large retail or restaurant chains on Commercial Drive. The Da Kine, an Amsterdam-style cafe, was raided by police and owner Carol Gwilt charged with trafficking. She was eventually sentenced to prison. The issue has publicised the city&#x27;s lack of enforcement of Canadian drug laws, and demonstrated a commitment to its stated &quot;Four Pillars&quot; drug strategy.

In early summer 2005, Commercial Drive hosted its first car-free festival, in which 16 blocks were cleared of all vehicles and tens of thousands of people celebrated with walks, dancing, and food. The festival has since become an annual event, expanding to other parts of the city in 2008.

Today Commercial Drive is a multicultural and urban area.

== Events ==

=== Car Free Day Festival ===
Commercial Drive held the first Car Free Day celebration in 2005. Beginning in 2008, Car free days expanded to the West End, Main Street, Kitsilano, and North Vancouver (North Van). These celebrations aim to showcase the diversity and culture of local neighbourhoods, and increase foot traffic and sustainability within the city.

On Commercial Drive, Car Free day is held in early July, where the City blocks off Commercial Drive from Venables Street to Grandview Highway. The festival showcases local artisans, musicians, and activities. Local businesses are invited to move their production outside to the sidewalk and street for the day, creating outdoor spaces for eating and shopping. Since the festival&#x27;s beginnings, it has become increasingly popular every year, bringing in more foot traffic as well as increasing numbers of local vendors and artisans.

=== Italian Days ===
Italian day is a day of celebration of Commercial Drive&#x27;s Italian roots and the Italian influences that have fostered the neighbourhood&#x27;s growth over the years. Beginning in the early 1940s, when large numbers of Italians immigrated to the area, street festivals were often held by the community for general celebrations of Italian culture. The last festival before the modern revitalization of the celebration was held in 1982 when Italy won the World Cup for the first time since 1938.

The festival was rejuvenated in 2010 and has run every year since, bringing in businesses and foot-traffic. Italian Day is the largest one day cultural festival in Vancouver, bringing in an increasing attendance every year. The festival continues to celebrate Commercial Drive&#x27;s Italian roots today, and does so by engaging local vendors, merchants, restaurant patios, stages with live music and theatre, street performances, activities and displays.

<doc id="934228" wikidata="Q2578605" url="?curid=934228" title="Kathāvatthu">
<text>Kathāvatthu (Pāli) (; abbreviated Kv, Kvu; ) is a Buddhist scripture, one of the seven books in the Theravada Abhidhamma Pitaka. The text contrasts the orthodox Theravada position on a range of issues to the heterodox views of various interlocutors; the latter are not identified in the primary source text, but were speculatively identified with specific schools of thought in the (historically subsequent) commentaries. The original text is putatively dated to coincide with the reign of King Ashoka (around 240 B.C.), but this, too, is debatable. Though the core of the text may have begun to take shape during Ashoka&#x27;s reign, Bhikkhu Sujato notes that &quot;the work as a whole cannot have been composed at that time, for it is the outcome of a long period of elaboration, and discusses many views of schools that did not emerge until long after the time of Aśoka.&quot;

==Organization==
The Kathavatthu documents over 200 points of contention. The debated points are divided into four &#x27; (lit., &quot;group of 50&quot;). Each &#x27; is again divided, into 20 chapters (&quot;vagga&quot;) in all. In addition, three more &quot;vagga&quot; follow the four &quot;&quot;.

Each chapter contains questions and answers by means of which the most diverse views are presented, refuted and rejected. The form of the debates gives no identification of the participants, and does not step outside the debate to state explicitly which side is right.

The views deemed non-heretical by the commentary&#x27;s interpretation of the &quot;Katthavatthu&quot; were embraced by the Theravada denomination. According to the Commentaries those whose views were rejected include the Sarvastivada.

==Doctrinal positions==
The text focuses on refuting the views of various Buddhist schools, these include:

*The views of the Pudgalavada school, which held that a &#x27;person&#x27; exists as a real and ultimate fact and that it transmigrates from one life to the next. 
*That a perfected being (Arhat) can fall away from perfection.
*The views of the Sarvastivadins, that &quot;all [dharmas] exists&quot; in the three times (past, present, future), a form of temporal eternalism. 
*That an Arhat can have a nocturnal emission. 
*That an Arhat may be lacking in knowledge, have doubts or be excelled by others. 
*That the duration of an awareness event can last a day or more.
*That penetration and insight into the various stages of enlightenment is achieved gradually. 
*That the Buddha&#x27;s worldly speech was somehow supramundane.
*That all the powers of the Buddha are also possessed by his leading disciples.
*That a can become an Arhat.
*That one can attain enlightenment at the moment of rebirth. 
*That the Four Noble Truths, the immaterial states, space, and dependent origination are unconditioned. 
*That there is an intermediate state (Bardo) of existence
*That all dhammas last for only a moment (&quot;ksana&quot;). 
*That all is due to Karma.
*That it ought not be said the monastic order accepts gifts.
*That the Buddha himself did not teach the dharma, but that it was taught by his magical creation. 
*That one who has attained jhana continues to hear sound
*That the five gravest transgressions (matricide, patricide, etc.) involve immediate retribution even when committed unintentionally.
*That final liberation can be obtained without eliminating a certain fetter.

==Canonicity==

The inclusion of the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; in the Abhidhamma Pitaka has sometimes been thought of as something of an anomaly. First, the book is not regarded as being the words of the Buddha himself - its authorship is traditionally attributed to Moggaliputta Tissa. However this is not unusual: the Vinaya&#x27;s accounts of the first two Councils are obviously also not the Buddha&#x27;s actual words.
Second, the subject matter of the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; differs substantially from that of the other texts in the Abhidhamma – but this is true of the &quot;Puggalapaññatti&quot; as well.

Scholars sometimes also point to the inclusion of some obviously later (relatively new) sections of the &quot;Kathavatthu&quot; in the Tipitaka as an indication that the Pāli Canon was more &#x27;open&#x27; than has sometimes been thought, and as illustrative of the process of codifying new texts as canonical. In fact this too is not unusual, there being quite a bit of relatively late material in the Canon.

==Interpretation==

The debates are understood by the tradition, followed by many scholars, as disputes between different schools of Buddhism. However, L. S. Cousins, described by Professor Gombrich as the West&#x27;s leading abhidhamma scholar, says:

&quot;In spiritual traditions the world over, instructors have frequently employed apparent contradictions as part of their teaching method – perhaps to induce greater awareness in the pupil or to bring about a deeper and wider view of the subject in hand. The Pali Canon contains many explicit examples of such methods. (Indeed much of the Kathāvatthu makes better sense in these terms than as sectarian controversy.)&quot;

<doc id="934230" wikidata="Q529157" url="?curid=934230" title="Frontline Ltd.">
<text>Frontline PLC is the world&#x27;s fourth largest oil tanker shipping company, based in Limassol, Cyprus and controlled by John Fredriksen. Its primary business is transporting crude oil. As of 2008 the company had one of the world&#x27;s largest tanker fleets consisting of VLCC, Suezmax and Suezmax OBO carriers (82 tankers in total with 18 more on order).

==History==
Frontline has its origin in Frontline AB, which was founded in 1985, and which was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange from 1989 to 1997. Hemen Holding (a company indirectly controlled by the largest shareholder and chairman of Frontline, John Fredriksen) became the largest shareholder of Frontline in 1996. In May 1997, a decision was made at the general meeting in Frontline AB to change its domicile from Sweden to Bermuda and to list its shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange. The change of domicile was executed through a share for share exchange offer from the then newly formed Frontline in Bermuda.

Under Fredriksen the company absorbed several other companies: London and Overseas Freighters (1997), ICB (1999), and Golden Ocean (2000). These takeovers made Frontline the world&#x27;s largest tanker company, a position it has retained to the present day.

== Today ==
As of 31 December 2010, Frontline&#x27;s tanker and OBO fleet consisted of 73 vessels. The fleet consists of 44 VLCCs, which are either owned or chartered in, 21 Suezmax tankers which are either owned or chartered in and eight Suezmax OBOs which are chartered in. Frontline also had five VLCC newbuildings and two Suezmax newbuildings on order and three VLCCs under their commercial management. The company&#x27;s largest shareholder is Hemen Holding Ltd., a company indirectly controlled by the chairman of Frontline, billionaire John Fredriksen, Norway&#x27;s highest net worth person.

The freight market is very volatile, with standard deviations of up to 70%. From an options perspective, this is a possibility for a very large up and downside—part of this downside can be hedged away via freight derivatives. AG-Japan clean and dirty are the most liquid routes traded in the derivatives market. Frontline has a very high dividend yield, both in cash and in Ship Finance (SFL) stocks; for example, in late 2007 its annual dividend ran between 12 and 18%, depending on the fluctuating share price. SFL is an offshoot of Frontline; the offshoot is estimated to have generated 25% gains to shareholders due to the different risk in Frontline and SFL. Golden Ocean Group (GOGL), a dry bulk carrier firm, was also spun off of Frontline and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. GOGL is a volatile stock, and as with Frontline, dry freight derivatives are available. In 2006, Frontline started a new Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) project, Sea Production.

In June 2007, Frontline sold its entire holding of 25,500,000 shares in Sea Production. The sale of the shares was in line with Frontline&#x27;s strategy to remain a pure crude oil transportation company. Frontline and Sea Production will continue a strategic partnership with respect to conversion of crude oil tankers into oil storage and production units.

On 7 April 2022 there was announced a merger between Euronav and Frontline Ltd. pending regulatory approval and ironing out of the last details. The merger would have created the world&#x27;s largest publicly listed tanker company. Euronav&#x27;s largest shareholder, Compagnie Maritime Belge, opposed the merger and on 9 January 2023, Frontline announced that the merger would not take place. On 9 October 2023, Frontline sold its 26% stake in Euronav to Compagnie Maritime Belge. As part of the sale, Frontline acquired 24 of Euronav&#x27;s oil tankers for an aggregate purchase price of $2.35 billion USD.

<doc id="934232" wikidata="Q654150" url="?curid=934232" title="Archery at the Summer Olympics">
<text>Archery had its debut at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been contested in 18 Olympiads. 105 nations have competed in the Olympic archery events, with France appearing the most often at 15 times. The most noticeable trend has been the excellence of South Korean archers, who have won 32 out of 44 gold medals in archery events since 1984. Olympic archery is governed by the World Archery Federation (WA; formerly FITA). Recurve archery is the only discipline of archery featured at the Olympic Games. Archery is also an event at the Summer Paralympics.

==Summary==
;Key
 Archery events not held &lt;br&gt;
 Olympic Games not held &lt;br&gt;
==History==
The second Olympic Games, Paris 1900, saw the first appearance of archery. Seven men&#x27;s disciplines in varying distances were contested. At the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, six archery events were contested, of which three were men&#x27;s and three were women&#x27;s competitions. Team archery was introduced, as was women&#x27;s archery. At the 1908 Summer Olympics, three archery events were held. Archery was not featured at the 1912 Summer Olympics but reappeared in the 1920 Summer Olympics but only as a men&#x27;s event.

Archery has appeared in the Olympics only eighteen times, as between 1920 and 1972 it was not included in the program. The archery competition featured at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich consisted of a double FITA Round (from 2014 known as a &#x27;1440 Round&#x27;) competition with two events: men&#x27;s individual and women&#x27;s individual. This form of archery competition was held until the 1988 Summer Olympics, when team competition was added and the Grand FITA Round format was used. Starting at the 1992 Summer Olympics, the Olympic Round with head-to-head matches was adopted and has been used ever since.

In 1984 at Los Angeles, Neroli Fairhall of New Zealand was the first paraplegic competitor in the Olympic Games.

Since 2004, the archery competitions at the Olympic Games have often been held in iconic locations like the Panathinaikos Stadium (2004), Lord’s Cricket Ground (2012), and the Sambodromo (2016). In the 2024 Paris games, it took place outside the Hôtel des Invalides in the Esplanade.

==Medal table==
Archery competitions in 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1920 years preceded the modern, standardized archery competition under the rules of the World Archery Federation. They were contested by three nations at most in any given year, and were dominated by home nations in both the number of participants and number of medals won. The nations that competed during that period were France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and the United States. In some events in Antwerp (1920) bronze medals were not awarded as only two nations competed.

1972 marked the beginning of the modern archery competition at the Olympic Games. The events began to use standardized forms and many nations competed.

This table includes archery competitions in 1900, 1904, 1908, and 1920 in addition to the ones from 1972 onward.

==Qualification==
Qualification spots in archery are allotted to National Olympic Committees rather than to individual athletes. The minimum age for an Olympic archer is 16, according to World Archery (The Federation for the sport). There are two ways an NOC may earn qualification spots: by team or by an individual. For each gender, an NOC that earns a team qualification spot may send three archers to compete in that team event; each archer also competes in the individual competition. NOCs that earn individual qualification spots are limited to a single entry in the individual event.

For each gender, there are 12 team qualification spots: the host nation, the top 8 teams at the World Archery Championships, and the top 3 teams at the Final World Team Qualification Tournament.

In addition to the 36 entries awarded through team qualification, an additional 28 individual qualification spots are available for each gender, bringing the total number of competitors in each individual event to 64.

Qualification for the mixed team event is done through the ranking round at the Olympics.

===2012===
For 2012, the qualification rules were adjusted slightly. The host nation continued to receive three spots, as did the top eight teams at the World Championship. However, only 8 further individuals qualified through the individual placement at the World Championship. The continental tournaments received unbalanced allocations, with Africa and Oceania receiving only two qualification spots to the other continents&#x27; three. The Tripartite Commission retained its three selections. The remaining 13 spots were decided by Final Qualification Tournaments. Three additional team spots (9 individual spots) were allocated through the Final Qualification team event, and the last 4 spots through the Final Qualification individual tournament. If any of the NOCs qualifying through Final Qualification had already earned an individual spot, one more spot as added to the individual Final Qualification quota.

===2016===
Africa received 3 qualification spots in the continental tournaments, leaving Oceania as the only continent to receive 2 spots rather than 3.

===2020===
For the 2020 Olympics (which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), the five Continental Games were added to the qualification pathway. The winning NOC in the mixed team event at each of the five receives one allocation spot per gender; there is also one quota spot per gender for the individual event winners at the Asian, European, and Pan American Games. The World Championship allocation was reduced to 4 per gender and the Tripartite Commission allocation was reduced to 2 per gender. The European continental tournament received an additional spot (up to 4) at the expense of Oceania (down to 1) and Africa (down to 2). The base allocation for the final individual qualification tournament was reduced to only 1 per gender, though this tournament also reallocates unused quota spots.

==Competition==
From 1988 through 2016, Olympic archery consisted of four medal events: men&#x27;s individual, women&#x27;s individual, men&#x27;s team, and women&#x27;s team. The mixed team event was added in 2020. In all five events, the distance from the archer to the target is 70 meters.

===Individual===
In the individual competitions, 64 archers compete. The competition begins with the ranking round. Each archer shoots 72 arrows (in six ends, or groups, of 12 arrows). They are then ranked by score to determine their seeding for the single-elimination bracket. After this, final rankings for each archer are determined by the archer&#x27;s score in the round in which the archer was defeated, with the archers defeated in the first round being ranked 33rd through 64th.

====Pre-2008====
The first elimination round pits the first ranked archer against the sixty-fourth, the second against the sixty-third, and so on. In this match as well as the second and third, the archers shoot simultaneously 18 arrows in ends of 3 arrows. The archer with the higher score after 18 arrows moves on to the next round while the loser is eliminated.

After three such rounds, there are 8 archers remaining. The remaining three rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and medal matches) are referred to as the finals rounds. They consist of each archer shooting 12 arrows, again in ends of 3 arrows. The two archers in the match alternate by arrow instead of shooting their arrows simultaneously as in the first three rounds. The losers of the quarterfinals are eliminated, while the losers of the semifinals play each other to determine the bronze medal and fourth place. The two archers who are undefeated through the semifinals face each other in the gold medal match, in which the winner takes the gold medal while the loser receives the silver medal.

====2008 changes====
All matches in 2008 were in the previous finals round format, using 12 arrow matches. Archers alternated shooting by arrow.

====2012 changes====
The individual match system was completely overhauled for the 2012 Olympics, though the single elimination with bronze medal match format was retained. The matches now consisted of sets. Each set comprised both archers shooting three arrows. The archer with the best score in the set received two points; if the set was drawn, each archer received one point. The match would continue until one archer reached six points. If the match was tied after five sets, a single arrow shoot-off was held with the closest arrow to center winning.

===Team===
The team event uses the results of the same ranking round as the individual competition to determine seeding for the teams. The team&#x27;s three individual archers&#x27; scores are summed to get a team ranking round score. The competition thereafter is a single-elimination bracket, with the top 4 teams receiving a bye into the quarterfinals. The semifinal losers face each other in the bronze medal match. The set format from the individual competition was not used in 2012, but was used beginning in 2016. In team matches prior to 2016, each archer shot 8 arrows, with the best overall team score (for the total of 24 arrows) winning the match. Beginning with 2016, the set format (with each archer shooting two arrows per set for a total of six arrows per team per set) is used. The teams score 2 set points for every match won, if a tie occurs both teams will be given 1 point each. the first team to reach 5 set points wins.

===Mixed team===
The mixed team competition uses the results of the ranking round to both qualify and seed teams. Each of the 16 teams that compete consist of one man and one woman. 

==Events==

===Early Games===
Early Olympic archery competitions had events that were unique for each of the Games.

<text>The Jefferson Memorial Forest is a forest located in southwest Louisville, Kentucky, in the Knobs region of Kentucky. At , it is one of the largest municipal urban forests in the United States.

The forest was established as a tribute to area war dead but ultimately this was extended to all U.S. veterans. It is operated as a city park by Louisville Metro Government.

In 1975, the forest was designated a National Audubon Society Wildlife Refuge.

==Facilities==

The forest offers nearly of hiking and equestrian trails, including several which offer views of downtown Louisville. Several discrete usage areas are featured, including the Tom Wallace Recreation Area, with the Tom Wallace Lake; the Paul Yost Recreation Area, and the Horine Conference Center. Camping and fishing are both permitted. Tom Wallace Lake is stocked with trout and catfish twice a year. Tom Wallace Recreation Area features various handicapped-accessible facilities, including a fishing dock and a -long natural trail, the Tulip Tree Trail. The Horine Conference Center is a popular field trip destination for Louisville schools.

A hiking trail, the Siltstone Trail, traverses much of the forest from east to west. There are several local hiking trails, in addition. Horine also features many hiking trails and both the Paul Yost and Tom Wallace Recreation Areas have horse trails. No mountain biking is permitted in the forest at this time, but the low traffic roads and hilly terrain afford road cyclists many challenging routes through the forest and surrounding areas.

==History==

Beginning in August 1945, Jefferson County, Kentucky, undertook to establish a forest preserve in the southwestern part of the county. Dedicated October 10, 1948, the Jefferson County Memorial Forest was named as a memorial to the area&#x27;s World War II dead. Since then, the forest has been redesignated to remember all who served in the armed forces.

The original land purchases were guided by Paul Yost, who was appointed as the county forester. were secured by the time of dedication, and through 1954, an additional were acquired. The next significant acquisitions occurred from 1979 through the end of the 1980s, when the forest expanded to . During this period, due to the efforts of Mitch McConnell, then the Jefferson County Judge/Executive (1977–1984) and currently U.S. Senate Minority Leader, the forest doubled in size. Since the 1980s, acquisition has proceeded slowly.

On October 4, 1975, Elvis Stahr, president of the National Audubon Society, officially declared the forest a National Audubon Wildlife Refuge. At the time, then-Louisville mayor Harvey I. Sloane contrasted the serenity of the forest with the bustle of the nearby city and continued: &quot;This is a tremendous asset for the city and county ... and the cooperation here of federal government, the society and local government is unique.&quot;

In 1994, the Mitchell Hill School, a former country schoolhouse built in 1915, was renovated as a visitor and welcome center.

On May 28, 1996, thousand of forest trees were downed by a tornado, which caused several trails to be temporarily closed. The damage was compared to what occurred in Cherokee Park during the 1974 Super Outbreak.

==Natural history==

There are some fifty types of trees, including ten species of oaks, and a rich flora of wildflowers and seventeen species of ferns and fern allies. A wide variety of animals can be seen, including bobcats, coyotes, red foxes, white-tailed deer, great blue herons and horned owls.

Like many other natural areas in the eastern United States, the forest has a significant problem with invasive exotics, including tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), autumn olive (Eleagnus umbellata), Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii), Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), and princess tree (Paulownia tomentosa).

The forest is located in the Knobs region of Kentucky, also known as the Muldraugh Escarpment. This is a belt of rugged hills lying between the Bluegrass and the Pennyrile regions. The underlying geology of these hills is primarily siltstone and shale, with the siltstone creating extremely steep hillsides. The most important of these in the forest area is the Holtzclaw Siltstone, named after Holsclaw Hill.

<doc id="934247" wikidata="Q7313040" url="?curid=934247" title="Renegade Legion">
<text>Renegade Legion is a series of science fiction games that were designed by Sam Lewis, produced by FASA, and published from 1989 to 1993. The line was then licensed to Nightshift games, a spin-off of the garage company Crunchy Frog Enterprises by Paul Arden Lidberg, which published one scenario book, a gaming aid, and three issues of a fanzine-quality periodical before reverting the license.

Set in the 69th Century, the series allowed gamers to play out the battles between the &quot;Terran Overlord Government (TOG)&quot;, a corrupt galactic empire, and the &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, an alliance of humans and aliens. The focus of the plot, like with many strategy games, is to present a long term conflict to enable as many individual situations and environments as possible. Most of Renegade Legion deals with large, military battles to be played on hexagonal grid mapsheets in a turn-based rules system.

== The Plotline ==

The setting can best fit into the space opera category. The themes involve large-scale military operations as the Terran Overlord Government (TOG for short) attempts to completely conquer the Milky Way Galaxy. There are many alien races involved, and stories often use elements such royal bloodlines, betrayal, and normally leave little room for a peaceful solution.

The back story to the setting has the human race exploring and colonizing many worlds in the galaxy, and coming into contact with several important alien races. After the Snow Plague that eliminates most of the human race, Earth is invaded and conquered by the Kess Rith, a reptilian alien race that can best be physically described as half iguana and half centaur.

Later the humans on Earth successfully rebel and drive off the Kess Rith by emulating the ancient Roman civilization. Over the span of centuries of time this new human movement, which started out as only a noble liberation of Earth and human colony worlds becomes a military dictatorship after a terrorist bomb kills most of the senate. The new government is then led by a Caesar (dictator for life), and appoints a number of personal representatives called Overlords who wield nearly unlimited legal power. It is at this time that a significant disaffected portion of the TOG military defects to the Commonwealth, another human space faring nation smaller than the TOG. TOG becomes increasingly militant, engages in bloodsports, legalizes slavery, and reduces women to property of their father or husband in order to remove their right to vote as women often ruled against further military expansion and conquests. After defeating the Kess Rith, the new Terran Overlord Government continues their military conquest and attacks other nations who were neutral during their time spent under Kess Rith rule.

The single largest enemy of the TOG is the Commonwealth. It is based primarily on old Earth culture of Britain. While still maintaining its own royal family, it is far more democratic than the TOG, accepts women and aliens as equals, and even includes refugees from both the former Kess Rith empire, exiled or disgusted TOG military legions, and large numbers of TOG women who defect to the Commonwealth. Those women often join all female Commonwealth units called Minerva legions. It is from these various rogue TOG units the setting derives the name of Renegade Legion as they form half of the professional army of the Commonwealth. Their symbol continues to include the original TOG symbol of the planet Earth on an inverted pyramid background, however a hastily painted letter &quot;R&quot; made of four straight brush strokes in red paint is used to deface that original TOG symbol.

During a panel at RedCon95, FASA President Sam Lewis stated that the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series of games were originally designed for use with the Star Wars license. Since the license was awarded to West End Games, FASA chose to use the systems with their own setting.

The &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series was made up of five board games, a role-playing game, a war game, two computer games, with another two games, one board game and one computer game, announced but never published. With the exception of one of the board games and the two computer games, the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series was compatible on all levels.

== Board games ==

Each of the boxed boardgames in the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series used a template-based mechanic to determine weapon damage. When a unit was hit by a weapon, an additional die roll was used to determine the hit location; a geometric template was placed on the ship diagram at that location, and the armor boxes beneath that template were marked as destroyed. Each weapon had a unique template; more- or less-powerful weapons would use larger or smaller versions of a standard template. The intent was to add depth to the game system beyond simply counting up damage points (as in FASA&#x27;s BattleTech), as weapon type and hit location would now be important to game resolution.

Another key aspect of the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series was interoperability. All of the games in the system included rules for simultaneous play with the other games, for example using the starfighters from &quot;Interceptor&quot; as support for the action in a game of &quot;Centurion&quot;.

&quot;Renegade Legion&quot; games first shipped with die-cut cardboard boxes as the playing pieces; each side of the box depicted the unit from the appropriate angle (front, back, side, top, or bottom.) The second edition of &quot;Centurion&quot; replaced these with plastic miniatures.

=== Interceptor &quot;&quot;===
&quot;Interceptor&quot; was the first game of the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series, and was based on single- or two-crewmember starfighter combat. A second Edition of the game was announced but not published. &quot;Interceptor&quot; used a complex diagram of ship systems to track internal damage; this feature proved difficult for players to use and was not carried into the other games of the series.

===Centurion &quot;&quot; ===
&quot;Centurion&quot;, the second in the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; series, covered ground combat. The primary units were high-speed antigravity tanks; the game also included ground vehicles, artillery, and infantry.

===Leviathan &quot;&quot; ===
&quot;Leviathan&quot; covered capital ship combat. The starfighters from &quot;Interceptor&quot; were represented not as individual units, but as whole squadrons launched from massive starships. While &quot;Leviathan&quot; used the same template-based damage resolution mechanic as the other games, the templates were much less complex.

=== Prefect ===
&quot;Prefect&quot; was a more traditional wargame with large fold-out maps and hundreds of small cardboard counters, that shifted the action from the tactical level to the operational and involved the invasion of an entire star system. The player of &quot;Prefect&quot; was a high-level commander in either the TOG or Commonwealth forces and controlled thousands of ships, tanks and soldiers fighting over multiple worlds and millions of miles of space.

=== Circus Imperium ===
&quot;Circus Imperium&quot; was the fifth of the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; board games published by FASA, but unlike the others in the series, this tongue-in-cheek game of chariot racing was played strictly for laughs. The game involved anti-grav chariots being pulled by carnivorous beasts, with the object of the game to defeat the other racers, usually by knocking them out of the race or getting them eaten by the monsters. Outcomes of player actions were often random and unpredictable, and players could get points for eliciting laughs or the loudest cheers from other gamers. Ral Partha produced a series of lead figures for the game, including chariots, senators and imperial guards. Older catalogs have had these figures present as items available to order but in the exchange of &quot;BattleTech&quot; figures the Identifiers have changed. There were 3 variants under the old Ral Partha banner dependent on country of purchase.

=== Legionnaire ===
&quot;Legionnaire&quot; was the role-playing game (RPG) set in the Renegade Legion universe. It expanded the original Renegade Legion setting with three new alien races: the Menelvagoreans, the Vauvusar, and the Zog.

== Races in the Renegade Legion Universe ==
In the Renegade Legion Universe, aliens are designated as a greater or lesser race determined by whether the race had acquired spaceflight before first contact with other alien species.

* Baufrin (Greater Race): One of the founding races of the Commonwealth, this insectoid race is strongly allied with the Renegades.
* Huldice, Lungdo, and Ritha (Lesser Races): Three early alien species encountered by the early TOG Empire. TOG was extremely xenophobic during this period and quickly conquered all three alien species, forcing them to be settled across the Empire in small colonies designed to prevent them from acquiring enough genetic diversity to survive as a species. The only surviving members wander the spacelanes as a sort of &quot;Space Gypsies&quot; trying to make a living as nomadic traders. Widely believed to be an extinct species.
* Hivers (Lesser Race): Discovered in a densely-packed cluster near the center of the galaxy, they have been dispersed among human settlements. They may have stolen a spaceship and escaped back to their home territory.
* Humans (Greater Race): A near-dominant species in the Renegade Legion Universe, split into two major factions, who are engaged in a civil war. The two factions are the Terran Overlord Government (T.O.G.) and the Commonwealth or Renegades. Each human faction possesses a variety of alien allies and enemies.
* Kessrith (Greater Race): An aggressive reptilian alien race best described as half-iguana, half-centaur. The Kessrith have a warrior society that is loosely allied with the Renegades. The Kessrith acquired FTL travel from the S&#x27;sora and used slow sub-light generation ships before their encounters with the S&#x27;sora.
* Menelvagoreans (Lesser Race): Large, hermaphroditic brutes standing over two meters tall and commonly weighing over 200 kilos. They come from a strange volcanically active hot world with a triple star system. Little is known about them, but many hypothesize that they are a silicoid species since they withstand the high heat levels of their home world. The Menelvagoreans are loosely allied with TOG.
* Naram (Greater Race): A humanoid race, nearly identical to mainstream humanity, who are strongly allied with the Renegades. Despite the very similar appearance and capability of interbreeding with humans, the Naram have developed a very different culture with different values than TOG humanity.
* S&#x27;sora (Greater Race): Reptilian humanoids who are allied with TOG. The S&#x27;sora had a large space empire by the time they encountered humanity and had also encountered the Kessrith. It is difficult to determine which S&#x27;sora stories are true since the S&#x27;sora are known for spreading disinformation amongst others.
* Vauvusar (Greater Race): An amphibian race, with four arms, two legs, and a large skulled head with eyes located on the side of the skull, well adapted to life on land or in the water. The Vauvusar are loosely allied with the Renegades. The Vauvusar are also believed to be an extra-galactic visitor race from the Magellanic Clouds outside of the origin galaxy. It is unknown how they have travelled such vast distances.
* Zog (Lesser Race): A highly imitative primate-like race allied with TOG.

== Technology ==

=== Grav vehicles ===
One of the most common technologies of the setting are anti-gravity devices that allow planetary vehicles, starfighters, and other machines to fly. The largest vehicles are corvette class starships used as scouts, couriers, and landing craft. The main unit of the armies of Renegade Legion are grav tanks, grav APC&#x27;s for transporting infantry, and Bounce Infantry that use grav belts to enable them to jump long distances even while fully loaded. Gravity control is even used for nuclear devices in the form of a device known as a HELL bomb. The bomb instantaneously increases the local gravity to such an extent that nearby matter undergoes nuclear fusion and explodes.

Because of the use of Grav vehicles, roads are not nearly as important to armies of the Renegade Legion setting. Rivers often become major routes of travel as they are clear of obstructions. Tank battles can also occur far out at sea, as grav tanks fly above the surface of the ocean, popping up from the troughs of large waves and exchanging fire with the enemy forces. However, the altitude limit of anti-gravity is usually several hundred feet, and the top speed is 500 miles per hour at that altitude. Flying a few feet above the ground is safer as grav vehicles are vulnerable to hits from below, and this also slows their top speed as they avoid crashing into terrain.

The visual art style of Renegade legion most often depicts grav vehicles as having a box shaped hull with two downward sloping prong bow section with upturned tips. Frequently a large cannon is fitted into the hull between the bow prongs, as well as a turret with secondary weapons on top of the box hull.

=== Laser Weapons ===
Another common weapon, but best known in the Renegade Legion setting for being a source of misery. The crystals used to make the lasers are mined on various planets, but the crystals are toxic and mining them in the TOG is done with slave labor, often in a penal unit as punishment. Very large lasers are the Main armament of Starships and group-fired in large batteries (or bays) of 10-100 guns each. These guns range from 7.6 cm (3&quot;) to 37.5 cm (15&quot;) in diameter. Smaller ships (fighters or ground vehicles) are limited to the 7.6 cm as their maximum with smaller weapons available.

=== Gauss Weapons ===

Military forces in the Renegade Legion setting make extensive use of electromagnetic projectile weapons, variously referred to as &quot;mass drivers&quot; or &quot;gauss cannons&quot;. These weapons range in size from infantry small arms to massive short-range weapons mounted in the bows of some starships, known as &quot;spinal Mounts&quot; they are referred to by crews as &#x27;Crowbars&#x27; and used to open massive holes in the armor of ships that wander too close across their bow. These weapons are not available for ships configured as Fighter Carriers. Smaller weapons of up to 20 cm (8&quot;) are carried by ground vehicles as their main armament. these weapons can cripple enemy vehicles with as little as 1 hit, though usually more are needed.

=== Missile Weapons ===

Military forces in the Renegade Legion setting also commonly use guided missiles of various types. Most starships carry mass volleys of powerful anti-ship missiles, Ground vehicles use smaller missiles of 2 type a laser-enhanced missile used to penetrate armor, also used by infantry, and a submunitions missile used to weaken armor ahead of other weapons. Fighter doctrine varies, the RL have missiles but tends to prefer weapons with more battlefield endurance such as lasers and mass-drivers, while the TOG prefers large missile volleys as their main fighter weapons, with other weapons as backup, for use when the missiles run out.

=== High Energy Weapons (Plasma, Particle, etc.) ===

Plasma and various variants of high energy weapons (Proton, electron, neutron particle guns, etc.) also exist with one of the best known types being the Thorium Plasma Projector.

=== Weapons of Mass Destruction ===

Various weapons of mass destruction also exist including the THOR satellite system (orbital kinetic-bombardment) and the HELL bomb, which instantaneously increases the local gravity to such an extent that nearby matter undergoes nuclear fusion and explodes. HELL bombs are similar to 20th century nuclear weapons.

=== Artillery, Ortillery and Other Weapons ===

Ground combat in the Renegade Legion setting has a number of types of long-range fire support, including both indirect-fire artillery munitions and orbital kinetic-bombardment weapons (referred to as Thor satellites.)

=== T-space ===
Faster than light travel (FTL) is possible in Renegade legion by spaceships that enter Tachyon-space, also known as T-space. T-Space travel requires a ship to accelerate under computer control along a precise flight path before activating the T-space drive. Once inside T-space the ship cannot turn in any direction as T-space does not follow the normal laws of physics. In addition the energies involved will build up within the solid matter of the ship and crews, requiring no more than a month of travel in T-space before becoming dangerous. An equal amount of time must be spent in the real space to dissipate the energy, known as Shimmer Heat, so named for the visual shimmering effect crews can see when entering and leaving T-space. The ships of the Leviathan board game feature large fins on their hulls, and these are used to dissipate Shimmer Heat.

Exceeding the recommended maximum of one month in T-space will result in the over-charged solid matter exploding.

=== P-Comm ===
The faster than light (FTL) communication related to T-space travel. The range is limited, but it is possible to communicate with nearby star systems. The devices are small enough to fit onto small spaceships. However, the P-comm cannot be used while actually traveling in T-space.

=== Very Large Communication Relays (VLCA) ===
VLCA stands for (Very Large Communications Array) and is the fastest communications technology available. Only the TOG possesses this technology, which requires huge surface or orbital facilities. It can also be mounted on large, specialized starships. The arrays are large space stations and can transmit and receive over far greater distances than the P-comm devices, even across the entire Milky Way galaxy. This allowed the Republic/TOG government to make use of smaller forces for maximum effect than their enemies using only P-comm system. However, they are quite large and must operate by line of sight to other known relay stations, rendering them useless on moving starships, or starships not at their assigned coordinates.

=== Shields ===
Most military vehicles, ships, and fighters are equipped with invisible energy shields. They deflect incoming attacks, though their protection is based on their flicker rate. Shields cannot run continuously, so instead they cycle on and off many times a second. A fixed percentage of attacks are rendered harmless due to their flicker rates, and higher quality shields have a better ratio of on-cycles to off-cycles when compared to low quality shields. However, shields have limitations beyond this. In grav tank battles the solid metal rounds fired by main gun/Gauss cannon are not affected by shields, as well as Thor satellite attacks and nuclear detonations. Lasers, missiles, and infantry weapons are potentially stopped by shields, or hit with full impact depending if the shield was on or off at the moment of impact.

Shields are also directional. A ship or tank can have very powerful shields in one direction, but weak or even no shields in another direction. Grav vehicles usually have weak shield below them to save weight, and simply fly very close to the ground to avoid being hit in this weak spot.

== Other games ==

=== Role-playing Game ===
&quot;Legionnaire&quot; was the name of the role-playing game set in the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; universe. While designed primarily as a stand-alone game, it could be integrated into the board games in the series, with stat conversions and guidelines for players who wished to do so.

=== Video games ===
In addition to the board games and the role-playing game, two computer games set in this universe were published by Strategic Simulations, Inc. &quot;Renegade Legion: Interceptor&quot; was a straight translation of the turned-based board game of the same name, and allowed two players to fight each other with a squadron of starfighters. The &quot;Interceptor&quot; computer game also contained a ship creation generator, providing players the ability to produce custom ships.

The second game was called &quot;&quot;. This game deviated from the &quot;Interceptor&quot; game system by becoming a space dogfighting simulator, very similar to &quot;Wing Commander&quot;.

A sequel to this game, titled &quot;Renegade II: Return to Jacob&#x27;s Star&quot;, was near enough to completion to be reviewed in professional gaming magazines, but was never released. &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that &quot;In its defense, &quot;Renegade 2&quot; has succeeded in cutting down load times, and the high-res graphics are gorgeous without the need for the kind of horsepower required for Origin&#x27;s latest, &quot;Wing Commander IV&quot;. Still, none of this is enough to keep &quot;Renegade 2&quot; from being anything but a mediocre game at best.&quot;

=== Games development ===
Nightshift games had given Don Gallagher the task of evolving the background as well as revising &quot;Interceptor&quot; into the long-announced 2nd Edition and creating the announced &quot;Phalanx&quot; board game.

In his proposal for the background, &quot;TOG&quot; collapsed and a new human ./. Kess Rith-conflict ensued. In Fan circles, this was received with mixed emotions, and many fans continue to play in the old storyline.

&quot;Interceptor, 2nd Edition&quot; abolished the flow chart-like internal damage system, in effect making it to &quot;Centurion in Space&quot;. The completed rules have been released freely onto the internet, and have a certain following, but never existed as a published work in book format.

&quot;Phalanx&quot; was to be the game of individual combat, like &quot;Battletroops&quot; in &quot;Battletech&quot; or &quot;DMZ&quot; in &quot;Shadowrun&quot;. Luc Nadon and Dallen Masters did a playtest version that differed heavily from the &quot;Battletroops&quot; rules, in effect making &quot;Phalanx&quot; a tabletop game. No more than a HTML-ed playtest version exists.

== Novels and modules ==
FASA published a number of titles in support of their &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; games. &quot;Interceptor&quot;, &quot;Centurion&quot; and &quot;Leviathan&quot; each had a number of modules that provided interlinking scenarios for gamers, and each had one technical sourcebook that provided additional ship and vehicle designs. In addition, FASA published &quot;Shannedam County&quot;, a sourcebook which profiled dozen of planets and star systems where adventures and battles could be set.

There were several paperback novels that used the &quot;Renegade Legion&quot; setting: &quot;Renegade&#x27;s Honor&quot; by William H. Keith, Jr.; and &quot;Damned If We Do …&quot;, &quot;Frost Death&quot;, and &quot;Monsoon&quot;, all by Peter L. Rice.

&quot;Renegade Legion&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Leviathan&quot; module was used as the base for FASA&#x27;s Battletech new aerospace rules known at the time as BattleSpace. Much of Leviathan&#x27;s movement &amp; damage system rules were used to make it. The &quot;Leviathan&quot; rules have continued to be used, updated and revised for Battletech&#x27;s newer aerospace ruleset, &quot;Aerotech 2&quot;.

In 2006 Catalyst Game Labs revised and enhanced the &quot;Aerotech 2&quot; rules. They were split up between &quot;Total Warfare&quot; and &quot;Techmanual&quot;. Rules for large naval ships and spacestations are included in the 2008 rulebook, &quot;Strategic Operations&quot;.

In 2021, an anthology entitled &quot;&quot;Voices of Varuna&quot;&quot; set in the Renegade Legion universe was published.

<text>Hendrik &quot;Erik&quot; Dekker (born 21 August 1970) is a retired Dutch professional road racing cyclist active from 1992 until 2006. He was a member of the Rabobank cycling team from 1992 till 2006. From 2007 to 2015 he was one of Rabobank&#x27;s team managers.

==Cycling career==

===Amateur career===
Dekker rode his first race at eight, and soon became successful. In 1985 he was invited to join the national selection for juniors. As an amateur, his most important results were second places at the youth world championships in Bergamo in 1987 and at the road race in the 1992 Summer Olympics.
In that Olympic road race, Dekker got away at 30 km before the finish, together with Fabio Casartelli and Dainis Ozols. Dekker was outsprinted by Casartelli, but was so happy that he won a medal that he also finished with his arms in the air.

Directly after the Olympic Games, he became professional, and rode his first race a few weeks later in the Tour de l&#x27;Avenir.

===Professional career===
His first win as a professional was a stage of the Tour of the Basque Country of 1994, the year he rode his first Tour de France. In 1997 Dekker won the Ronde van Nederland, but a large part of 1998 was lost because of injuries.

The year 2000 was Dekker&#x27;s best. He won three stages in the 2000 Tour de France, although neither a sprinter nor a favourite for the overall win, and was voted most combative cyclist. In the autumn of that year, Dekker won his first classic, the Clásica de San Sebastián.

In 2001 Dekker won the Amstel Gold Race and the UCI Road World Cup. In the 2001 Tour de France he took a stage, after having helped his teammate Marc Wauters to a stage win. At the end of the year he was named Dutch Sportsman of the year.

The years 2002 and 2003 were less successful because of injuries. He came back in 2004 in the spring classics and a victory in Paris–Tours. He had announced his retirement for the autumn of 2006, but he crashed heavily in the 2006 Tour de France and decided to stop.

===Managing career===
In 2007, Dekker started as team manager of the Rabobank team. At the end of the 2015 season, he left the team.

<doc id="934274" wikidata="Q5866844" url="?curid=934274" title="History of Thailand (1973–2001)">
<text>The history of Thailand from 1973 to 2001 saw an unstable period of democracy, with military rule being reimposed after a bloody coup in 1976. (The previous military rulers had been removed, as a result of the revolution of 14 October 1973.)

For most of the 1980s, Thailand was ruled by Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda, a democratically inclined strongman who restored parliamentary politics. Thereafter the country remained a democracy apart from a brief period of military rule from 1991 to 1992.

Between 1985 and 1994, Thailand was the world&#x27;s fastest growing economy according to the World Bank. Foreign investment primarily from Japan turned Thailand into a manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia by the end of the century. 

The 1997 Asian financial crisis culminated in populist Thaksin Shinawatra&#x27;s victory in the 2001 Thai general election.

==Popular uprising (1973–1976)==
The events of October 1973 amounted to a revolution in Thai politics. For the first time the urban middle class, led by the students, had challenged the ruling junta, and had gained the apparent blessing of King Bhumibol Adulyadej for a transition to democracy. The leaders of the junta were forced to step down; they took refuge in the United States or Taiwan.

Thailand, however, had not yet produced a political class able to make this bold new democracy function smoothly. The January 1975 elections failed to produce a stable party majority, and fresh elections in April 1976 produced the same result. The veteran politician Seni Pramoj and his brother Kukrit Pramoj alternated in power, but were unable to carry out a coherent reform program. The sharp increase in oil prices in 1974 led to recession and inflation, weakening the government&#x27;s position. The democratic government&#x27;s most popular move was to secure the withdrawal of American forces from Thailand. The communist insurgency led by the Thai communist party gradually became more active in the countryside, allying with urban intellectuals and students.

South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia fell to communist forces in 1975. The threat of the communists in the neighboring countries soon led to panic among the people. The arrival of communist regimes on Thailand&#x27;s borders, the abolition of the 600-year-old Lao monarchy, and the arrival of a flood of refugees from Laos and Cambodia swung public opinion in Thailand to the right, and conservatives did much better in the 1976 elections than they had done in 1975.

==Return to military rule (1976–1980)==

By late 1976 moderate middle class opinion had turned away from the activism of the students, who had moved increasingly to the left. The army and the right-wing parties began a propaganda war against student liberalism by accusing student activists of being &#x27;communists&#x27; and through formal paramilitary organizations such the Nawaphon, the Village Scouts, and the Red Gaurs, many of those students were killed. Matters came to a head in October when Thanom Kittikachorn returned to Thailand to enter a royal monastery, Wat Bovorn.

Tension between workers and factory owners became fierce, as the civil rights movement became more active after 1973. Socialism and leftist ideology gained popularity among intellectuals and the working class. The political atmosphere became even more tense. Workers were found hung in Nakhon Pathom after protesting against a factory owner. A Thai version of anti-communist McCarthyism spread widely. Whoever staged a protest could be accused of being part of a communist conspiracy.

In 1976, students protesters occupied the Thammasat University campus and held protests over the violent deaths of the workers and staged a mock hanging of the victims, one of whom allegedly bore a resemblance to Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Some newspapers the following day, including the Bangkok Post, published an altered version of a photo of the event, which suggested the protestors had committed lèse majesté. Rightist and ultra-conservative icons such as Samak Sundaravej blasted the protestors, instigating violent means to suppress them, culminating in the 6 October 1976 massacre. The army unleashed the paramilitaries and mob violence followed, in which many were killed.

The same evening, a junta staged a coup, declaring the end of the Democrat Party led-coalition government. The army installed Thanin Kraivichien, an ultra-conservative former judge, as prime minister, and carried out a sweeping purge of the universities, the media and the civil service. Thousands of students, intellectuals and other leftists fled Bangkok and took refuge with the Communist Party&#x27;s insurgent forces in the north and north-east, operating from safe bases in Laos. Others left for exile, including Dr. Puey Ungphakorn, a respected economist and Rector of Thammasat University. The economy was also in serious difficulties, in no small part due to Thanin&#x27;s policies, which frightened foreign investors.

The new regime proved as unstable as the democratic experiment had been. In March 1977, one army faction staged a coup d&#x27;état attempt but failed. In October 1977 a different section of the army staged another &quot;coup&quot; and replaced Thanin with General Kriangsak Chamanan. In 1978 the government offered an amnesty to Thai communists willing to &quot;work with us to build a prosperous nation&quot;. The offer included housing, family reunion and security.

By this time, Thai forces had to deal with the situation resulting from the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. There was another flood of refugees, and both Vietnamese and Khmer Rouge forces periodically crossed into Thai territory, sparking clashes along the borders. A 1979 visit to Beijing earned Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s agreement to end support for Thailand&#x27;s communist movement; in return, the Thai authorities agreed to give safe haven to the Khmer Rouge forces fleeing west following the invasion of Cambodia. Revelations of the crimes of the defeated Khmer Rouge also sharply reduced the appeal of communism to the Thai public. Kriangsak&#x27;s position as prime minister soon became untenable and he was forced to step down in February 1980 at a time of economic troubles. Kriangsak was succeeded by the army commander-in-chief, General Prem Tinsulanonda, a staunch royalist with a reputation for being incorruptible.

===Vietnamese incursions===

Between 1979 and 1988, Vietnamese occupation forces in Kampuchea made incursions into Thai territory, allegedly seeking rebel guerrillas they claimed were hiding in refugee camps (where many Laotians and Vietnamese refugees had also settled). Sporadic skirmishes continued along the border from 1985 to 1988, as Vietnamese troops periodically made cross border raids to wipe out Khmer Rouge border camps in Thailand, which along with China was a major supporter of the Khmer Rouge resistance. At times this led to direct combat with the Royal Thai Army, which drove back the intruders.

==Premiership of Prem (1980–1988)==
Much of the 1980s saw a process of democratization overseen by King Bhumibol and Prem Tinsulanonda. The two preferred constitutional rule, and acted to put an end to violent military interventions.

In April 1981 a clique of junior army officers popularly known as the &quot;Young Turks&quot; staged a coup attempt, taking control of Bangkok. They dissolved the National Assembly and promised sweeping social changes. But their position quickly crumbled when Prem Tinsulanonda accompanied the royal family to Khorat. With King Bhumibol&#x27;s support for Prem made clear, loyalist units under the palace favourite General Arthit Kamlang-ek managed to recapture the capital in an almost bloodless counterattack.

This episode raised the prestige of the monarchy still further, and also enhanced Prem&#x27;s status as a relative moderate. A compromise was therefore reached. The insurgency ended and most of the ex-student guerillas returned to Bangkok under an amnesty. In December 1982, the Thai army Commander in Chief accepted flag of the Communist Party of Thailand at a widely publicized ceremony held in Banbak. Here, communist fighters and their supporters handed in their weapons and swore allegiance to the government. Prem declared the armed struggle over. The army returned to its barracks, and yet another constitution was promulgated, creating an appointed Senate to balance the popularly elected National Assembly. Elections were held in April 1983, giving Prem, now in the guise of a civilian politician, a large majority in the legislature (an arrangement which came to be known as &quot;Premocracy&quot;).

Prem was also the beneficiary of the accelerating economic revolution which was sweeping south-east Asia. After the recession of the mid-1970s, economic growth took off. For the first time Thailand became a significant industrial power, and manufactured goods such as computer parts, textiles and footwear overtook rice, rubber and tin as Thailand&#x27;s leading exports. With the end of the Indochina wars and the insurgency, tourism developed rapidly and became a major earner. The urban population continued to grow rapidly, but overall population growth began to decline, leading to a rise in living standards even in rural areas, although the Isaan continued to lag behind. While Thailand did not grow as fast as the &quot;Four Asian Tigers,&quot; (namely Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore) it achieved sustained growth, reaching an estimated $7100 GDP per capita (PPP) by 1990, approximately double its 1980 average.

Prem held office for eight years, surviving another coup in 1985 and two more general elections in 1983 and 1986, and remained personally popular, but the revival of democratic politics led to a demand for a more adventurous leader. In 1988 fresh elections brought former General Chatichai Choonhavan to power. Prem rejected the invitation offered by major political parties for the third term of premiership.

==Black May (1988–1992)==

By allowing one faction of the military to get rich on government contracts, Chatichai provoked a rival faction, led by Generals Sunthorn Kongsompong, Suchinda Kraprayoon, and other generals of Class 5 of the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy to stage the 1991 Thai coup d&#x27;état in February 1991, charging Chatichai&#x27;s government as a corrupt regime or &#x27;Buffet Cabinet&#x27;. The junta called itself the National Peace Keeping Council. The NPKC brought in a civilian prime minister, Anand Panyarachun, who was still responsible to the military. Anand&#x27;s anti-corruption and straightforward measures proved popular. Another general election was held in March 1992.
The winning coalition appointed coup leader Suchinda Kraprayoon to become Prime Minister, in effect breaking a promise he had made earlier to King Bhumibol and confirming the widespread suspicion that the new government was going to be a military regime in disguise. However, the Thailand of 1992 was not the Siam of 1932. Suchinda&#x27;s action brought hundreds of thousands of people out in the largest demonstrations ever seen in Bangkok, led by the former governor of Bangkok, Major-General Chamlong Srimuang.

Suchinda brought military units personally loyal to him into the city and tried to suppress the demonstrations by force, leading to a massacre and riots in the heart of the capital, Bangkok, in which hundreds died. Rumours spread out as there was a rift in the armed forces. Amidst the fear of civil war, King Bhumibol intervened: he summoned Suchinda and Chamlong to a televised audience, and urged them to follow the peaceful solution. This meeting resulted in Suchinda&#x27;s resignation.

==People&#x27;s constitution (1992–1997)==
King Bhumibol re-appointed royalist Anand as interim prime minister until elections could be held in September 1992, which brought the Democrat Party under Chuan Leekpai to power, mainly representing the voters of Bangkok and the south. Chuan was a competent administrator who held power until 1995, when he was defeated at elections by a coalition of conservative and provincial parties led by Banharn Silpa-Archa. Tainted by corruption charges from the very beginning, Banharn&#x27;s government was forced to call early elections in 1996, in which General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh&#x27;s New Aspiration Party managed to gain a narrow victory.

The 1997 Constitution was the first constitution to be drafted by a popularly elected Constitutional Drafting Assembly, and was popularly called the &quot;people&#x27;s constitution&quot;. The 1997 Constitution created a bicameral legislature consisting of a 500-seat House of Representatives (สภาผู้แทนราษฎร, &quot;sapha phu thaen ratsadon&quot;) and a 200-seat Senate (วุฒิสภา, &quot;wutthisapha&quot;). For the first time in Thai history, both houses were directly elected.

Many human rights were explicitly acknowledged, and measures were established to increase the stability of elected governments. The House was elected by the first past the post system, where only one candidate with a simple majority could be elected in one constituency. The Senate was elected based on the provincial system, where one province could return more than one senator depending on its population size.

The two houses of the National Assembly have two different terms. In accordance with the constitution the Senate is elected to a six-year term, while the House is elected to a four-year term. Overall the term of the National Assembly is based on that of the House. The National Assembly each year will sit in two sessions: an &quot;ordinary session&quot; and a &quot;legislative session&quot;. The first session of the National Assembly must take place within thirty days after the general election of the House of Representatives. The first session must be opened by the king in person by reading a Speech from the Throne; this ceremony is held in the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. He may also appoint the crown prince or a representative to carry out this duty. It is also the duty of the king to prorogue sessions through a royal decree when the House term expires. The king also has the prerogative to call extraordinary sessions and prolong sessions upon advice of the House of Representatives.

The National Assembly may host a &quot;joint-sitting&quot; of both Houses under several circumstances. These include: The appointment of a regent, any alteration to the 1924 Palace Law of Succession, the opening of the first session, the announcement of policies by the Cabinet of Thailand, the approval of the declaration of war, the hearing of explanations and approval of a treaty and the amendment of the Constitution.

Members of the House of Representatives served four-year terms, while senators served six-year terms. The 1997 People&#x27;s Constitution also promoted human rights more than any other constitution. The court system (ศาล, san) included a constitutional court with jurisdiction over the constitutionality of parliamentary acts, royal decrees, and political matters.

==Financial crisis (1997–2001)==

Soon after coming into office, Prime Minister Chavalit was confronted by the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997. After coming under strong criticism for his handling of the crisis, Chavilit resigned in November 1997 and Chuan returned to power. Chuan came to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund which stabilised the currency and allowed IMF intervention on the Thai economic recovery. In contrast to the country&#x27;s previous history, the crisis was resolved by civilian rulers under democratic procedures.

During the 2001 election Chuan&#x27;s agreement with the IMF and use of injection funds to boost the economy were a cause for great debate, whilst Thaksin&#x27;s policies appealed to the mass electorate. Thaksin campaigned effectively against the old politics, corruption, organized crime, and drugs. In January 2001 he had a sweeping victory at the polls, winning a larger popular mandate (40%) than any Thai prime minister has ever had in a freely elected National Assembly.

<text>Orvelte () is a village in the Dutch province of Drenthe. It is a part of the municipality of Midden-Drenthe, and lies about 18 km northeast of Hoogeveen.

Orvelte presents itself as a museum village. There is a saw mill, a blacksmith and a wooden shoe maker, all open to the public. A number of events are held throughout the year featuring traditional Dutch activities.

== History ==
The village was first mentioned in 1362 as &quot;in Oervelde&quot;, and probably means &quot;other side of the (heath) field&quot;. Orvelte is an &quot;esdorp&quot; which developed in the Middle Ages on the road from Westerbork to Zweeloo. It may have been a daughter settlement of Westerbork.

The farm Bruntingerhof was built between 1560 and 1650, and is the oldest extant farm in Drenthe. It used to be located in the hamlet of Bruntinge, but was moved to Orvelte in the 1960s.

Orvelte was home to 140 people in 1840.

In 1967, the village was designated a protected site. It became a museum village and attempts were made to return the village to the layout of 1830. The &quot;brink&quot; (village square) has been restored and historical farms and barns from other villages which were scheduled to be demolished, have been purchased and moved to Orvelte. The former toll house was built around 1870 and is in use as a museum and tourist information site. Cars are no longer allowed in the village. A horse tram has been made available as public transport.

<doc id="934288" wikidata="Q640089" url="?curid=934288" title="Caudebec-en-Caux">
<text>Caudebec-en-Caux (, literally &quot;Caudebec in Caux&quot;) is a former commune in the Seine-Maritime department in the Normandy region in northern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Rives-en-Seine.

==Geography==
Caudebec-en-Caux is located W.N.W. of Rouen, on the right bank of the River Seine. The tidal bore in the estuary of the Seine which is known as the &quot;mascaret&quot; in French, but locally as the &quot;barre&quot;, used to be well seen at this point. The development of the industrial polder towards Harfleur has changed the geometry of the estuary so that mascaret now seems to be a phenomenon of the past.

Since 1977 Caudebec has been served by the Pont de Brotonne, one of three bridges built across the Seine, downstream from Rouen since 1960, to replace the many ferries so making vehicular access between the Pays de Caux and the Autoroute A13 easier.

==History==
Caudebec is one of numerous places in Normandy having names which are clearly derived from a Scandinavian language.
&quot;Caldebec&quot; Abt 1025 (like Caldbeck, &quot;Caldebeck&quot; 1060, Cumberland.) derives from the old Danish &quot;kaldr bekkr&quot;: cold stream, cold brook.

In May 1592 during the French Wars of Religion Caudebec had been taken by Spanish and French Catholic League forces of Duke of Parma but was trapped by an army under Henry IV of France. Parma though wounded then made a miraculous escape avoiding complete defeat but died at Arras.

=== Heraldry ===
==Sights==

The chief architectural interest of the town lies in its Flamboyant church, which was constructed during the 15th and the early 16th centuries. Round its top run balustrades formed of Gothic letters, which read as part of the &quot;Magnificat&quot;. Its west portal, the decoration of the spire of the tower, and its stained glass are among the features which make it one of the finest churches of the Rouen diocese.

* In the town are also
**&quot;Maison des Templiers&quot; (The Templars&#x27; House) from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. The building was saved by a society set up for the purpose and houses a small museum of local archaeology and history. A domestic building of this period is a rarity.
**The former prison from the fourteenth century.
**&quot;Hôtel du Bailli&quot;, a town house.
**&quot;Hôtel de ville&quot; (Town Hall) from around 1800.
**The riverside embankments (Les Quais).
**&quot;Musée de la marine de Seine&quot;, on the history of river navigation.
*Just outside the town:
**&quot;Château d&#x27;Etelan&quot; a renaissance château overlooking the final loop of the river Seine
**The short length of riverside road between Caudebec and St Wandrille, passes under the &quot;Pont de Brotonne&quot;, a high-level cable-stayed bridge.
**&quot;Monument du Latham 47&quot;
**Fontenelle Abbey (&quot;Abbaye de Saint-Wandrille&quot;), in the nearby village of Saint-Wandrille-Rançon.
==Economy==
Historically, its industries included tanning and leather-currying, and there was trade in grain. The port had a small trade in coal, livestock and farm produce. Caudebec was formerly the location of the French seaplane manufacturer Latham.

==Caudebec-en-Caux in fiction==
* Caudebec-en-Caux (though shortened to &#x27;Caudebec&#x27;) is the site of the death of the character Captain William Bush, in C.S. Forester&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord Hornblower&quot;, part of the popular Horatio Hornblower series set during the Napoleonic Wars. Bush, Hornblower&#x27;s loyal companion for much of the series, was killed due to an explosion in a minor military operation in the Seine estuary near to the town of Caudebec.
* Much of the action in &quot;They Wouldn&#x27;t Be Chessmen&quot; by A. E. W. Mason takes place in Caudebec.

==Notable people==
* Thomas Basin, historian, was born here in 1412.
* Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 10th Earl of Shaftesbury was raised here after his father, the 9th Earl of Shaftesbury died in 1947. The 10th Earl&#x27;s mother was the French-born Françoise Soulier, daughter of Georges Soulier.
* François Duprat (1941–1978), French writer, was killed here.
* Hippolyte Sebron (1801-1879), painter and associate of Louis Daguerre, was born here.

<doc id="934295" wikidata="Q1094116" url="?curid=934295" title="Fourth Great Awakening">
<text>The Fourth Great Awakening was a Christian awakening that some scholars including economic historian, Robert Fogel say took place in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s, while others look at the post-war era. The terminology is controversial, with some historians believing the religious changes that took place in the US during these years were not equivalent to those of the first three Great Awakenings. Thus, the idea of a Fourth Great Awakening itself has not been generally accepted.

Whether or not they constitute an &quot;awakening&quot;, many changes did take place. The &quot;mainline&quot; Protestant churches weakened sharply in both membership and influence while the most conservative denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly in numbers, spread across the United States, had grave internal theological battles and schisms, and became politically powerful. Other evangelical and fundamentalist denominations also expanded rapidly. At the same time, secularism grew dramatically, and the more conservative churches saw themselves battling secularism in terms of issues such as LGBT rights, abortion, and creationism. Many new religious movements emerged such as the People&#x27;s Temple and Heaven&#x27;s Gate, and the corresponding rise of the anti-cult movement.

==New movements==

Concomitant to the power shift was a change in evangelicalism itself, with new groups arising and extant ones switching their focus. There was a new emphasis on a personal relationship with Jesus from newly styled &quot;non-denominational&quot; churches and &quot;community faith centers&quot;. This period also saw the rise of non-traditional churches and megachurches with conservative theologies and a growth in parachurch organizations while mainline Protestantism lost many members. The Jesus Movement is considered by some to be part of the Fourth Great Awakening.

Vinson Synan (1997) argues that a charismatic awakening occurred between 1961 and 1982. This stemmed from a Pentecostal movement that placed emphasis on experiencing what they saw as the gifts of the Spirit, including speaking in tongues, faith healing, and prophecy. It also focused on strengthening spiritual convictions through these gifts and through signs taken to be from the Holy Spirit. Originally a Protestant movement, its influence spread to some in the Roman Catholic Church at a time when Catholic leaders were opening up to more ecumenical beliefs, to a reduced emphasis on institutional structures, and to an increased emphasis on spirituality at the lay level.

==Trends==
Organized religion in the United States changed in the face of secularizing pressures after World War II. There was a proliferation of megachurches. Denominations such as the Assemblies of God, Southern Baptists (), and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) became more popular. Three particular religious leaders were very influential: Martin Luther King Jr., Billy Graham, and Pope John Paul II. Megachurches won attention for the simple reason that 10 churches with 2,000 members were more visible than 100 churches with 200 members. The populist denominations&#x27; growth coincided with the simultaneous decline of the mainline bodies. While the former trend did not come at the expense of the latter (it represented different fertility and retention rates, not switching), to the media and many ordinary observers those developments signaled the aggressive swelling of religious strength.

The &quot;mainstream&quot; Protestant churches contracted sharply in terms of membership and influence.

After World War II, some conservative Christian denominations including the Southern Baptists, Missouri Synod Lutherans (), the Church of God, Pentecostals, Holiness groups, and Nazarenes grew rapidly in numbers and also spread nationwide. Some of these denominations, such as the Southern Baptists and Missouri Synod Lutherans, would go on to face theological battles and schisms from the 1960s onward. LCMS would see a split in the 1970s which would ultimately lead to the forming of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, while the SBC would face its own battles resulting in the Southern Baptist Convention conservative resurgence. Many of the more conservative churches would go on to become politically powerful as part of the &quot;religious right&quot;. At the same time, the influence of secularism (the belief that government and law should not be based on religion) grew dramatically, and the more conservative churches saw themselves battling secularism in terms of issues such as gay rights, abortion, and creationism.

Byrnes and Segers note regarding the abortion issue, &quot;While more theologically conservative Protestant denominations, such as the Missouri-Synod Lutherans and the Southern Baptist Convention, expressed disapproval of Roe, they became politically active only in the mid and late 1970s.&quot; The SBC itself actually passed resolutions at two Annual Meetings in support of legalized abortion; not until 1980 (in the early days of the Conservative Resurgence) would it reverse its position and, from that point on, continually adopt resolutions opposing it. However, the political involvement of churches ranged from actively participating in organizations such as the Moral Majority and the Christian Coalition to adopting the much more indirect and unorganized approach of Missouri Synod Lutherans.

<text>Bloomers is a British sitcom starring Richard Beckinsale that aired on BBC2 in 1979. Five episodes of the show were made before Beckinsale died suddenly from a heart attack just before a planned rehearsal for the sixth and final episode of the first series. &quot;Bloomers&quot; was immediately shelved, though the five completed episodes were broadcast later in the same year.

==Plot==
Stan is a worker for a small London flower business. The humour centred on the relationships between the workers and the scrapes they got into doing odd jobs in the gardens of houses in the district. Beckinsale&#x27;s character, Stan, was apt to wind up in bed with lonely housewives, and equally apt to spend time with said housewives musing on philosophy and the pointlessness of life.

==Cast==
*Richard Beckinsale – Stan
*Anna Calder-Marshall – Lena
*Paul Curran – George
*David Swift – Dingley
*Pat Gorman – Pub Landlord
*June Ritchie – Diana
*Beryl Nesbitt – Connie
*Declan Mulholland - O&#x27;Shaughnessy
*Vernon Dobtcheff - Dr. Lamb
*Glory Annen - Dr. Lamb&#x27;s Daughter

==Background==
Writer James Saunders thought up the idea for &quot;Bloomers&quot; while talking with actor John Challis, who owned and worked at a garden centre, while taking a break from acting. Said Saunders: &quot;The idea was based on fact. The local florist was telling me about the number of funny things that happened and I thought it would make a good series.&quot; Challis stated: &quot;I remember the writer James Saunders was a customer at my garden centre and he wrote a script about my experiences. I gave the script to my agent who gave it to John Howard Davies at the BBC who was looking for a vehicle for Richard Beckinsale. So Bloomers was written with me in mind but I wasn&#x27;t famous enough, but Richard Beckinsale was wonderful and I got an episode out of it!&quot; The scene in episode three where Stan and Dingley attempt to steal Christmas trees from a roundabout was based on a real-life incident with Challis. In the episode, Challis plays one of the policemen who busts up the theft.

The five completed episodes of &quot;Bloomers&quot; were recorded prior to Christmas 1978. Due to an industrial dispute at the BBC, (the same dispute which delayed the recording of the final episode of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;), the recording of the sixth episode was postponed until 20 March, but it ended up never being recorded at all, due to Beckinsale&#x27;s death the previous day.

==Episodes==
==Broadcast==
Beckinsale&#x27;s widow, Judy Loe, gave her approval for the five completed episodes to be broadcast. &quot;Bloomers&quot; aired from 27 September 1979 to 25 October 1979 on BBC2. Four of the episodes were given a repeat viewing the following year on BBC1 from 6 August 1980 to 27 August 1980. The show also aired in 1983 on ABC in Australia and the only publicly available recordings of &quot;Bloomers&quot; are from these broadcasts. Poor quality transfers of the five episodes are available to view on YouTube. &quot;Bloomers&quot; has never been aired again by the BBC, nor has there been any official release of the series.

<text>Les Cheneaux Islands () are an archipelago of 36 small islands, some inhabited, along 12 miles of Lake Huron shoreline on the southeastern tip of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States. The name is French for &quot;the Channels&quot;, noting the many channels between the islands in the group. They are about 30 miles northeast of Mackinac Island and about 35 miles south of Sault Ste. Marie. The islands are a popular resort and boating and kayaking area. The nearby communities of Hessel and Cedarville on the mainland offer marinas, camping, lodging, restaurants, and shopping. The Les Cheneaux Islands Antique Boat Show &amp; Festival of the Arts has been held on the second Saturday of each August since 1976 in Hessel. It is the world&#x27;s largest antique wooden boat show.

==History==
The area that encompasses Les Cheneaux was traditionally occupied by the Wyandotte and the Odawa people. In 1634, French colonial explorer Jean Nicolet navigated the channels of Les Cheneaux while attempting to reach Michillimackinac via Lake Huron (then referred to as &quot;Mer Douce&quot;). He was accompanied by seven Wyandotte tribesmen. Nicolet and later explorers noted that the locals referred to the chain as &quot;Onomonee&quot; or &quot;Anaminang&quot;, derived from the Odawa word for &quot;island&quot;, &quot;minis&quot;. Jacques Marquette would be the first European to draw a map of Les Cheneaux, while navigating it during the summer of 1671.

By the late 17th century, the fur trade dominated the island chain.

==Overview of Area==
32 of the 36 islands are named. They include:

*Alligator Island
*Bear Island
*Birch Island
*Boot Island
*Burnham Island
*Coryell Island

*Little La Salle Island
*Lone Susan Island
*Long Island
*Marquette Island
*Penny Island

<text>Pierre Lescot ( – 10 September 1578) was a French architect of the French Renaissance period. He is known for designing the Fontaine des Innocents and the Lescot wing of the Louvre in Paris. Lescot contributed to the incorporation of classical architectural elements into French architecture.

==Biography==
Lescot was born in Paris. King Francis I of France appointed him as the architect responsible for building projects at the Palais du Louvre, transforming the old château into the renowned palace. A design proposed by the Italian architect and theorist Sebastiano Serlio was set aside in favor of Lescot&#x27;s plan. His design envisioned enclosing three sides of a square courtyard with elaborate apartments, while the eastern side, facing the city as it then stood, was likely intended to be lightly enclosed with an arcade. Festive corner pavilions of impressive height, adorned with pillars and statues, were planned to replace the medieval towers. However, elsewhere in the Louvre, little progress was made beyond demolishing parts of the old feudal structure.

After the death of King Francis I, Lescot was confirmed in his role by his successor, Henry II, and continued working on the Louvre project until his death. Despite this, only the west side and part of the south side were completed, forming the present southwest wing of the &quot;Cour Carré&quot;, known as the &quot;Aile Lescot&quot;, or &quot;Lescot Wing&quot; (&quot;illustration&quot;). Constructed between 1546 and 1551, this structure set the standard for French classicism.

The wing features two stories with an attic adorned with Jean Goujon&#x27;s richly detailed bas-relief panels and is topped by a sloping roof, a traditional French architectural element suited to a rainy climate. The ground floor&#x27;s deeply recessed arch-headed windows create the impression of an arcade, while the central and end pavilions project outward, each crowned by small round &quot;oeil de boeuf&quot; windows. On the second floor, slender fluted pilasters divide the windows, which alternate between triangular and arched pediments.

Goujon&#x27;s sculptural work and architectural decorations are skillfully integrated into the overall design. The ground-floor &quot;Salle des Caryatides&quot; (1546–1549), named for Goujon&#x27;s four caryatid figures supporting the musicians&#x27; gallery, is a notable surviving feature. Other remnants of Lescot&#x27;s contributions to the Louvre include the &quot;Salle des Gardes&quot; and the Henry II staircase.

Lescot&#x27;s earliest works, completed between 1540 and 1545, included the rood screen at Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois, though only some sculptures by Jean Goujon have survived. In Paris, he designed the Hôtel de Ligneris (1548–1550), now known as the Musée Carnavalet, which was later extensively modified by François Mansart. 

In the Fountain of Nymphs (1547–1549), Lescot’s architectural contributions play a more subdued role compared to the prominence of Goujon&#x27;s sculptures. Lescot was also responsible for the design of the Château de Vallery.

Lescot&#x27;s career is poorly documented, leaving it uncertain whether he ever visited Italy or if his understanding of Italian architectural practices came solely from the architecture and engravings associated with the School of Fontainebleau. All of Lescot&#x27;s known works feature sculptural decoration by Trebatti and Jean Goujon, who collaborated with him on the Louvre.

Unlike many architects of the French Flamboyant Gothic and Renaissance periods, Lescot did not come from a lineage of masons with practical experience. Instead, he was the son of a seigneur. His father, also named Pierre Lescot, was the &quot;sieur&quot; of Lissy-en-Brie and Clagny, near Versailles—lands that Lescot inherited.

According to a eulogistic poem by Ronsard, Lescot devoted his early youth to drawing and painting and, after the age of twenty, turned his attention to mathematics and architecture. However, his wealth and official responsibilities seem to have limited his artistic pursuits later in life. Beyond his recognized works, no other documented projects are attributed to him. A dismissive mention in the memoirs of the duc de Nevers, published long after Lescot&#x27;s death, refers to &quot;Magny&quot; (likely Clagny) as &quot;a painter who used to make inventions of masquerades and tourneys,&quot; reflecting the expectation for court architects of the 15th to 17th centuries to design such spectacles.

Upon Lescot&#x27;s death, Jean Baptiste Androuet du Cerceau succeeded him as the architect of the Louvre.

<doc id="934310" wikidata="Q1384613" url="?curid=934310" title="Ibn al-Nadim">
<text>Abū al-Faraj Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq an-Nadīm (), also Ibn Abī Yaʿqūb Isḥāq ibn Muḥammad ibn Isḥāq al-Warrāq, and commonly known by the &quot;nasab&quot; (patronymic) Ibn an-Nadīm (; died 17 September 995 or 998), was an important Arab Muslim bibliographer and biographer of Baghdad who compiled the encyclopedia &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; (&quot;The Book Catalogue&quot;).

==Biography==
Much known of an-Nadim is deduced from his epithets. &#x27;an-Nadim&#x27; (), &#x27;the Court Companion&#x27; and &#x27;al-Warrāq () &#x27;the copyist of manuscripts&#x27;. Probably born in Baghdad ca. 320/932 he died there on Wednesday, 20th of Shaʿban A.H. 385. He was a Persian or perhaps an Arab.
Little is known about Ibn an-Nadīm&#x27;s life. Some historians say that he was of Persian descent , but this is not certain. However, the choice of the rarely used Persian word pehrest (fehrest/fehres/fahrasat) meaning &quot;The List&quot; as the title for a handbook on Arabic literature is noteworthy in this context. 

From age six, he may have attended a &quot;madrasa&quot; and received comprehensive education in Islamic studies, history, geography, comparative religion, the sciences, grammar, rhetoric and Qurʾanic commentary. Ibrahim al-Abyari, author of &quot;Turāth al-Insaniyah&quot; says an-Nadim studied with al-Hasan ibn Sawwar, a logician and translator of science books; Yunus al-Qass, translator of classical mathematical texts; and Abu al-Hasan Muhammad ibn Yusuf al-Naqit, scholar in Greek science.
An inscription, in an early copy of al-Fihrist, probably by the historian al-Maqrizi, relates that an-Nadim was a pupil of the jurist Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Sirafi (d.978/9), the poet Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani, and the historian Abu Abdullah al-Marzubani and others. Al-Maqrizi&#x27;s phrase &#x27;but no one quoted him&#x27;, would imply an-Nadim himself did not teach. While attending lectures of some of the leading scholars of the tenth century, he served an apprenticeship in his father&#x27;s profession, the book trade. His father, a bookdealer and owner of a prosperous bookstore, commissioned an-Nadim to buy manuscripts from dealers. an-Nadim, with the other calligrapher scribes employed, would then copy these for the customers. The bookshop, customarily on an upper floor, would have been a popular hangout for intellectuals.

He probably visited the intellectual centers at Basra and Kufa in search of scholarly material. He may have visited Aleppo, a center of literature and culture under the rule of Sayf al-Dawla. In a library in Mosul he found a fragment of a book by Euclid and works of poetry. an-Nadim may have served as &#x27;Court Companion&#x27; to Nasir al-Dawla, a Hamdanid ruler of Mosul who promoted learning. His family were highly educated and he, or his ancestor, may have been a &#x27;member of the Round Table of the prince&#x27;. The Buyid caliph &#x27;Adud al-Dawla (r. 356–367 H), was the great friend of arts and sciences, loved poets and scholars, gave them salaries, and founded a significant library. More probably service at the court of Mu&#x27;izz al-Dawla, and later his son Izz al-Dawlah&#x27;s, in Baghdad, earned him the title. He mentions meeting someone in Dar al-Rum in 988, about the period of the book&#x27;s compilation. However, it is probable that, here, &#x27;Dar al-Rum&#x27; refers to the Greek Orthodox sector of Baghdad rather than Constantinople.

Others among his wide circle of elites were Ali ibn Harun ibn al-Munajjim (d. 963), of the Banu Munajjim and the Christian philosopher Ibn al-Khammar. He admired Abu Sulayman Sijistani, son of Ali bin Isa the &quot;Good Vizier&quot; of the Banu al-Jarrah, for his knowledge of philosophy, logic and the Greek, Persian and Indian sciences, especially Aristotle. The physician Ibn Abi Usaibia (d. 1273), mentions an-Nadim thirteen times and calls him a writer, or perhaps a government secretary. an-Nadim&#x27;s &quot;kunya&quot; &#x27;Abu al-Faraj&#x27; indicates he was married with at least one son.

In 987, Ibn an-Nadim began compiling &quot;al-Fihrist&quot; (The Catalogue), as a useful reference index for customers and traders of books. Over a long period he noted thousands of authors, their biographical data, and works, gathered from his regular visits to private book collectors and libraries across the region - including Mosul and Damascus - and through active participation in the lively literary scene of Baghdad in the period.

==Religion==
Ishaq an-Nadim&#x27;s broad discussions of religions and religious sects in his writings and the subtleties of his descriptions and terminologies raised questions as to his own religious beliefs and affiliations. It seems Ibn Hajar&#x27;s claim that an-Nadim was Shiʿah, was based on his use of the term &quot;specific people&quot; () for the Shiʿah, &quot;general people&quot; () for non-Shiʿahs, and of the pejorative term &quot;Ḥashawīyya&quot; (), for Sunnis. Reinforcing this suspicion are references to the Hanbali school as &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; (&quot;People of the Hadith&quot;), and not &quot;Ahl al-Sunna&quot; (&quot;People of the Tradition&quot;), use of the supplication of &quot;peace be upon him&quot; () after the names of the &quot;Ahl al-Bayt&quot; (Descendants of Muhammad) and reference to the Shia imam Ali ar-Rida as &quot;mawlana&quot; (master). He alleges that al-Waqidi concealed being a Shiʿah by &quot;taqiyya&quot; (dissimulation) and that most of the traditionalists were Zaydis. Ibn Hajar also claimed an-Nadim was a Muʿtazila. The sect is discussed in chapter five of &quot;Al-Fihrist&quot; where they are called the &quot;People of Justice&quot; (). an-Nadim calls the Ash&#x27;arites &quot;al-Mujbira&quot;, and harshly criticises the Sab&#x27;iyya doctrine and history. An allusion to a certain Shafi&#x27;i scholar as a &#x27;secret Twelver&#x27;, is said to indicate his possible Twelver affiliation. Within his circle were the theologian Al-Mufid, the &quot;da&#x27;i&quot; Ibn Hamdan, the author Khushkunanadh, and the Jacobite philosopher Yahya ibn &#x27;Adi (d. 363/973) preceptor to Isa bin Ali and a fellow copyist and bookseller (p. t64, 8). Another unsubstantiated claim that an-Nadim was Isma&#x27;ili, rests on his meeting with an Isma&#x27;ili leader.

==&quot;Al-Fihrist&quot;==
The &quot;Kitāb al-Fihrist&quot; () is a compendium of the knowledge and literature of tenth-century Islam referencing approx. 10,000 books and 2,000 authors. This crucial source of medieval Arabic-Islamic literature, informed by various ancient Hellenic and Roman civilizations, preserves from his own hand the names of authors, books and accounts otherwise entirely lost. &quot;Al-Fihrist&quot; is evidence of an-Nadim&#x27;s thirst for knowledge among the exciting sophisticated milieu of Baghdad&#x27;s intellectual elite. As a record of civilisation transmitted through Muslim culture to the West world, it provides unique classical material and links to other civilisations.

<doc id="934313" wikidata="Q6166277" url="?curid=934313" title="Jay's Grave">
<text>Jay&#x27;s Grave (or Kitty Jay&#x27;s Grave) is supposedly the last resting place of a suicide victim who is thought to have died in the late 18th century. It has become a well-known landmark on Dartmoor, Devon, in South-West England, and is the subject of local folklore, and several ghost stories.

The small burial mound is at the side of a minor road, about 1 mile (1.6 km) north west of Hound Tor, at the entrance to a green lane that leads to Natsworthy. Fresh flowers are regularly placed on the grave, although no-one admits to putting them there.

==Folklore==
Since it was first set down in the late 19th century, the story attached to the grave has changed and has been greatly embellished.

===Early references===
An early newspaper account of the discovery of the grave appears on page 5 of the &quot;North Devon Journal&quot; for 23 January 1851, under &quot;County Intelligence&quot;:
In 1876 Robert Dymond edited and published a book entitled &quot;&quot;Things Old and New&quot; Concerning the Parish of Widecombe-in-the-Moor and its Neighbourhood&quot; which contains the following:
In Volume 1 of the &quot;Western Antiquary&quot;, dated October 1881, one F. B. Doveton asked for further details of a grave that he had noted by the side of the road to Hey Tor. Doveton&#x27;s guide had told him that it 

In a reply to Doveton&#x27;s enquiry that was published later the same month, P. F. S. Amery quoted the above passage from Dymond and added some extra information:
Twenty years later, in the first volume of &quot;Devon Notes and Queries&quot; (1900–01), W. H. Thornton, who identified himself as the rector of North Bovey, asked:
In reply to this enquiry P. F. S. Amery, who was by now one of the editors of &quot;Devon Notes and Queries&quot;, wrote:
In a map from 1905, the grave appears as &quot;Jane&#x27;s Grave&quot;.

In 1909, William Crossing, in his &quot;Guide to Dartmoor&quot; repeated Amery&#x27;s report, though he named the suicide as &quot;Kitty Jay, as she used to be spoken of&quot;, and amended the location of the incident to &quot;Canna, a farm not far from the foot of East Down&quot;.

The Dartmoor author Beatrice Chase wrote about the legend in her 1914 novel &quot;The Heart of the Moor&quot;, and claimed in a prefixed publisher&#x27;s note that the events it describes are true. In the novel she says:
Because there is no inscription on the grave she sets out to discover whose it might be. After asking several locals and searching maps and guidebooks without success, she eventually finds that &quot;Granny Caunter&quot; knows the story:
Patricia Milton, writing in 2006, points out that Chase was being disingenuous in her novel, because as early as 1905 the grave was being mentioned in guidebooks, and coach drivers were already pointing it out to tourists.

===Later versions===
By 1965 Jay&#x27;s Grave had become a major Dartmoor attraction, with tourist coaches stopping there while the driver/guide related their own version of the story. The mysterious appearance of fresh flowers upon the grave was always mentioned.

Recent versions of the legend include embellishments such as the orphaned baby being taken into the Poor House in Newton Abbot or Wolborough where she was given the name Mary Jay. She now sometimes acquires the name Kitty after being sent to Canna Farm as a teenage apprentice. In one version of the tale, she is raped by a local farmhand. In another version, she finds romance with the farmer&#x27;s son. Either way, she becomes pregnant which results in her being thrown out of the farm and left with a reputation. Such is her shame and despair that she hangs herself in a barn, or perhaps from the great kitchen fireplace lintel, or else she drowns herself in a shallow pool.

It is now said that the three local parishes of Widecombe-in-the-Moor, North Bovey and Manaton all refused to bury her body within consecrated ground, so she was buried at a crossroads, which was standard practice for suicide victims at the time. It is also often said that this crossroads is at the point where the three parishes met, though the Ordnance Survey map confirms that this is not the case.

==The grave==
There are always fresh flowers on the grave, the placement of which is the subject of local folklore – some claim they are placed there by pixies, but it is known that the author Beatrice Chase was one person who did this, before her death in 1955. By 2007 the placing of flowers had expanded into all sorts of votive offerings: coins, candles, shells, small crosses and toys, for instance.

Motorists, passing at night, claim to have glimpsed ghostly figures in their headlights, others report seeing a dark, hooded figure kneeling there.

==Notable uses of the story==
Jay&#x27;s Grave was the inspiration for John Galsworthy&#x27;s short story &quot;The Apple Tree&quot;, written in 1916.

In the late 1960s, knowledge of the legend prompted Martin Turner of local rock band the Empty Vessels to visit the grave with his brother Glenn, late at night after a gig. Some years later, by then a founder member of Wishbone Ash, Turner used the experience to write the lyrics to a song called &quot;Lady Jay&quot; which appears on the band&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;There&#x27;s the Rub&quot;. &quot;I thought it was tragic, yet very romantic,&quot; he later said.

David Rudkin wrote an episode inspired by the tale entitled &quot;The Living Grave&quot; for the BBC 2 TV anthology series &quot;Leap in the Dark&quot;, broadcast in 1980. It also inspired Seth Lakeman to write his 2004 song and album, both called &quot;Kitty Jay&quot;. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle visited the nearby house, Heatree with his friend, Bertram Fletcher Robinson, and this is said to have been inspired by the location of the house and its proximity to Jay&#x27;s Grave, Bowerman&#x27;s nose, Hound Tor and Grimspound to write &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

<doc id="934316" wikidata="Q738184" url="?curid=934316" title="Brading">
<text>The ancient &#x27;Kynges Towne&#x27; of Brading is the main town of the civil parish of the same name. The ecclesiastical parish of Brading used to cover about a tenth of the Isle of Wight. The civil parish now includes the town itself and Adgestone, Morton, Nunwell and other outlying areas between Ryde, St Helens, Bembridge, Sandown and Arreton. Alverstone was transferred to the Newchurch parish some thirty years ago.

Brading has a population of 1,906 according to the 2021 Census.

==History==

===Early history===
From early times, Brading ranked as an important Island port. The ancient name of Brerdynge, from which &#x27;Brading&#x27; is derived, probably meant &quot;the people living by the ridge of the Downs&quot;, and dates from at least 683.

The Roman Villa south of the town, and Roman relics discovered locally, indicate that this was an important seaport 2,000 years ago. Signs of prehistoric activity have also been found on Brading Down.

History records that St Wilfrid came to the island during the 680s, landed at Brading, preached there to the islanders, and began the conversion of the Island. Bede states that King Caedwalla of Wessex killed the pagan population &quot;with merciless slaughter&quot; and replaced them with his own Christian followers, dedicating a quarter of the Isle of Wight to Wilfrid and the Church. Wilfrid would thus have been literally preaching to the converted because everyone else was dead.
This legend was illustrated by a tableau at the Waxworks.

===Royal charter and governance===
Brading was first granted a charter in 1280, unusually for the time directly from King Edward I, rather than the Lord of the Isle (who was its private owner). This led to it being known as the &#x27;King&#x27;s Town&#x27;.

The charter granted to Brading by Edward VI in 1548 refers to the previous charter granted by Edward I. This charter allowed the town to hold two annual fairs. Nowadays the fair is called Brading Day and is held over the first weekend in July.

Because of its status as a town, Brading has a mayor and an elected town council.

In medieval times the town was governed by the steward, bailiffs and 13 jurats, and returned two MPs to the Westminster Parliament. The Reform Act 1832 created a single Isle of Wight parliamentary constituency covering the whole island, until it was divided into two constituencies in 2024. Now the town is a part of the Isle of Wight East parliamentary constituency.

===The old port===
Until the 16th century the port was active. Ships lay alongside at the quay behind the Bugle Inn in the High Street. Ships came into Brading Haven for shelter and for provisions, particularly water, which was of a high quality. The north-eastern part of the haven was closed off by an embankment completed in 1594, much of which is still present. Ships would then tie up at the far end of Quay Lane on the other side of the embankment.

Throughout the Middle Ages various attempts were made to drain off the rest of the harbour; for it had gradually become silted up and, except for the main channel of the river, was too shallow to be of any commercial use. Sir Hugh Myddleton, who had constructed the New River from Hertfordshire to central London for James I, undertook this work; but the sea broke in and flooded the land once again. After others had also tried and failed, this reclamation was finally accomplished in 1881 by the building of a substantial embankment right across the harbour, with the building of the railway to Bembridge.

So Brading now shares with Winchelsea and Romney the distinction of being a seaport without any sea. Losing access to the sea caused Brading to decline in importance and prevented the sort of growth enjoyed by Cowes and Newport.

===The Old Town Hall===

The Old Town Hall stands near to the church. There is no record of the earliest Town Hall, but an entry in The Court Leet Book 1729 refers to the assessment of one shilling rate, and also a subscription towards building a new Town Hall, Market House and Prison, so it is likely it was completed around 1730. This new building remained until 1876 when it was restored to its present state, and then contained the Free Town Library.

===The Bull Ring===
Set in the ground outside the New Town Hall (1903), there is an iron bullring which was once used to secure a bull whilst it was being baited by dogs. According to the diaries of Sir John Oglander, the Governor of the Isle of Wight would donate 5 guineas for the purchase of the bull to be baited; the meat was afterwards donated to the poor of the town. The Mayor attended this ceremony in full regalia and a dog, known as the Mayor&#x27;s Dog, would be decked with coloured ribbons and set on the bull after the proclamation had been made.

A large wooden carving of a bull decorates the Bullring. This is by local artist Paul Sivell. Another of his works is an approximately 10-foot wooden statue of the goddess Diana positioned in the woods above Brading at Kelly&#x27;s Copse entitled &quot;For Camilla&quot;. This commemorates the murder of a Danish exchange student by a sex attacker from Gosport in 2002. Many local people have added plastic flowers and stuffed toys as tribute.

===The Town Gun===
The town possesses a gun. It is a brass piece, made in 1549 by the Owine Brothers, John and Robert, so that the town might be defended from French invasion. The gun was never used in action, but was taken to the top of Brading Down in 1832 so that it could be fired to celebrate the passing of the Reform Bill. Unfortunately it exploded and split, putting a stop to celebrations for the day. It is currently kept at the coach house at Nunwell House.

==Governance==
Brading is part of the electoral ward called Brading, St. Helens and Bembridge. At the 2011 census the population of this ward was 6,935.

==Wildlife and landscape==

The southern-western part of the parish is included within the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. There are two Sites of Important Nature Conservation close to Morton and another on the downs.

Brading Down is a viewpoint and downland beauty spot. From the north side of the hill it is possible to look over the town towards the mainland. From further up visitors can see the Solent and the Spinnaker Tower at Portsmouth. This elevated site is also of archaeological importance.

The RSPB Brading Marshes nature reserve is the first Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve on the Isle of Wight. Situated on the reclaimed land of the old harbour, behind the present-day Bembridge Harbour, it was bought in 2001 and is a mix of lagoons and ditches, reed beds and meadows, with a fringe of ancient woodland. The reserve is free and open to visitors all year round. Notable species include marsh harriers, red squirrels and cetti&#x27;s warbler.

==Transport==
Brading is served by Brading railway station on the Island Line Railway with direct connection to the Wightlink ferry at Ryde Pier Head and stops at Ryde, Smallbrook, Sandown, Lake and Shanklin. The southern fringes of Brading are also on the Island&#x27;s circular cycle route used for the annual &quot;Bicycle Island Randonée&quot;.

The main A3055 road from Ryde to Sandown passes through the town.

The town is well-connected to the surrounding countryside by footpaths and bridleways. The Bembridge Trail passes through the town along Doctors Lane, Cross Street, High Street and Quay Lane (Wall Lane) then along the top of the embankment to St Urian&#x27;s Copse. There are 71 other footpaths, by-ways and bridle paths in the civil parish area and organised parties of walkers may often be seen meeting at the station or the Bullring.

Southern Vectis run buses on route 3 from the town, serving Newport, Ryde, Sandown, Shanklin and Ventnor, and some other places. Night buses are run at weekends.

==Features of the town==


The main street of Brading contains most of the facilities expected of a large village, or in Brading&#x27;s case, small town. There are four pubs; The Bugle Inn where the sea almost met the High Street when Brading Haven was a major port, the Wheatsheaf Inn which faces the Bull Ring, The Kynges Well (formerly the Dark Horse) which is on the High Street and one at nearby Yarbridge named the Yarbridge Inn (known for many years as the Anglers Inn) which is famous for its selection of real ales. St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Brading is at the north end of the town and the Methodist chapel is near the centre. There is a small supermarket, a post office, a newsagent, several other specialist shops,a hairdresser&#x27;s and a fish and chip shop. In addition to these facilities, there is Brading Primary School.

Brading has many tourist attractions, but primarily the beach. These aldo include the Lilliput Doll and Toy Museum; and The Roman Villa at Morton with its protective cover (new in 2004) and interpretation centre.

There used to be the Brading Waxworks, a museum and waxworks exhibition housed in a Tudor pub (named as of 2005 &#x27;Brading: The Experience&#x27;). However, the attraction announced its closure in late 2009 as a result of falling visitor numbers and the increasing costs of running and maintaining the site. It was closed for good on 3 January 2010, and most of the vast collection of taxidermy pieces, historical artefacts and vehicles was auctioned off in April 2010.

The railway station building, as well as remaining an operational railway station has been restored as a café, railway memorabilia shop and small rail museum. The non-operational signal box has been restored to the state it may have been in during the steam era. It is staffed by volunteers.

==Sport and leisure==

Brading has a Non-League football club Brading Town F.C., which plays at The Peter Henry Ground.

==Famous connections==
One of the town&#x27;s claims to fame is that the boards used in churches all over the world to display hymn numbers were invented here by the Rev Legh Richmond, who was curate-in-charge of Brading and Yaverland 1757 to 1805, and a famous writer of inspirational evangelist pamphlets at that time.

&#x27;Little&#x27; Jane Squibb A devout young Christian girl who attended the Reverend&#x27;s weekly Sunday school at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Brading. Her story is told in Rev Legh Richmond&#x27;s Annals Of The Poor, under &#x27;The Young Cottager&#x27;. She succumbed to the disease, Tuberculosis known in those days as Consumption, on 30 January 1799. Her death affected Rev Legh greatly. Her grave can be found in St Mary&#x27;s Churchyard, Brading &amp; her cottage in The Mall, Brading.

Brading, fictionalised as &quot;Barling&quot;, is the central location of Maxwell Gray&#x27;s 1899 novel &quot;The House of Hidden Treasure&quot;.

The Victorian diarist Francis Kilvert visited Brading on the day of John Oglander&#x27;s funeral and recorded details of his visit to Brading in his diary.

<text>The steppe bison or steppe wisent (Bison&quot; &quot;priscus) is an extinct species of bison. It was widely distributed across the mammoth steppe, ranging from Western Europe to eastern Beringia in North America during the Late Pleistocene. It is ancestral to all North American bison, including ultimately modern American bison. Three chronological subspecies, &quot;Bison priscus priscus&quot;, &quot;Bison priscus mediator&quot;, and &quot;Bison priscus gigas&quot;, have been suggested.

==Evolution==

The steppe bison first appeared during the mid Middle Pleistocene in eastern Eurasia, subsequently dispersing westwards as far as Western Europe. During the late Middle Pleistocene, around 195,000-135,000 years ago, the steppe bison migrated across the Bering land bridge into North America, becoming ancestral to endemic North American bison species, including the largest known bison, the long-horned &quot;Bison latifrons,&quot; and the smaller &quot;Bison antiquus,&quot; the latter of which is thought to be ancestral to modern American bison. 

== Description ==
Resembling the modern bison species, especially the American wood bison (&quot;Bison bison athabascae&quot;), the steppe bison was over tall at the withers, reaching in weight. The tips of the horns were a meter apart, the horns themselves being over half a meter long.

&quot;Bison priscus gigas&quot; is the largest known bison of Eurasia. This subspecies was possibly analogous to &quot;Bison latifrons&quot;, attaining similar body sizes and horns which were up to apart, and presumably favored similar habitat conditions.

The steppe bison was also anatomically similar to the European bison (&quot;Bison bonasus&quot;), to the point of difficulty distinguishing between the two when complete skeletons are unavailable. The two species were close enough to interbreed; however they were also genetically distinct, indicating that interbreeding was in fact rare, possibly as a result of niche partitioning between the species.

== Palaeoecology ==
Dental microwear analysis suggests the steppe bison was a mixed feeder, rather than a strict grazer. Humans are known to have fed on steppe bison, with their processed remains having been found in Palaeolithic archaeological sites. Other likely predators of steppe bison include cave hyenas, whose dens have been found to contain steppe bison remains, and cave lions, whose claw marks were found on the “Blue Babe” mummy. Steppe bison may also have been preyed on by scimitar toothed cats and possibly wolves.

== Extinction ==

The steppe bison distribution contracted to the north after the end of the last glacial period, surviving into the mid Holocene before becoming extinct as part of the Quaternary extinction event. A steppe bison skeleton was radiocarbon dated to 5,400 years Before Present (c. 3450 BCE) in Alaska. &quot;B. priscus&quot; remains in the northern Angara River in Asia were dated to 2550-2450 BCE, and in the Oyat River in Leningrad Oblast, Russia to 1130-1060 BCE. The causes for the extinction of the steppe bison and many other primarily megafaunal species remain hotly debated, but the selectivity for large animals suggests that the spread of modern humans played a substantial role.

==Discoveries==

Steppe bison appear in cave art, notably in the Cave of Altamira and Lascaux, and the carving &quot;Bison Licking Insect Bite&quot;, and have been found in naturally ice-preserved form.

Blue Babe is the 36,000-year-old mummy of a male steppe bison which was discovered north of Fairbanks, Alaska, in July 1979. The mummy was noticed by a gold miner who named the mummy Blue Babe – &quot;Babe&quot; for Paul Bunyan&#x27;s mythical giant ox, permanently turned blue when he was buried to the horns in a blizzard (Blue Babe&#x27;s own bluish cast was caused by a coating of vivianite, a blue iron phosphate covering much of the specimen). Claw marks on the rear of the mummy and tooth punctures in the skin indicate that Blue Babe was killed by a cave lion. Blue Babe appears to have died during the fall or winter, when it was relatively cold. The carcass probably cooled rapidly and soon froze, which made it difficult for scavengers to eat. Blue Babe is also frequently referenced when talking about scientists eating their own specimens: the research team that was preparing it for permanent display in the University of Alaska Museum removed a portion of the mummy&#x27;s neck, stewed it, and dined on it to celebrate the accomplishment.

In early September 2007, near Tsiigehtchic, local resident Shane Van Loon discovered a carcass of a steppe bison which was radiocarbon dated to c. 13,650 cal BP. This carcass appears to represent the first Pleistocene mummified soft tissue remains from the glaciated regions of northern Canada.

In 2011, a 9,300-year-old mummy was found at Yukagir in Siberia.

In 2016, a frozen tail was discovered in the north of the Republic of Sakha in Russia. The exact age was not clear, but tests showed it was not younger than 8,000 years old. A team of Russian and South Korean scientists proposed extracting DNA from the specimen and cloning it in the future.

The steppe wisent is known from Denisova Cave, famous for being the site where the first Denisovan remains were discovered.

<text>Fogaras was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Romania (south-eastern Transylvania). The county&#x27;s capital was Fogaras (present-day Făgăraș).

==Geography==

Fogaras county shared borders with Romania and the Hungarian counties Szeben, Nagy-Küküllő and Brassó. The river Olt formed most of its northern border. The ridge of the southern Carpathian Mountains forms its southern border. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
The Fogaras region was an administrative territorial entity of the Kingdom of Hungary since the 15th century. Fogaras county was formed in 1876, when the administrative structure of Transylvania was changed. In 1920, by the Treaty of Trianon the county became part of Romania; Făgăraș County was created, with an identical territory. The territory lies in the present Romanian counties Brașov and Sibiu (the westernmost part).

==Demographics==



==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Fogaras county were:

<doc id="934319" wikidata="Q2714343" url="?curid=934319" title="Mailto">
<text>mailto is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) scheme for email addresses. It is used to produce hyperlinks on websites that allow users to send an email to a specific address directly from an HTML document, without having to copy it and entering it into an email client. 

It was originally defined by Request for Comments (RFC) 1738 in December 1994, expanded by RFC 2368 in July 1998, and refined by RFC 6068 in October 2010.

== Examples ==
&quot;mailto&quot; can be used within an HTML document to generate a link for sending email:
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:someone@example.com&quot;&gt;Send email&lt;/a&gt;

Clicking on the hyperlink automatically opens the default email client, with the destination email address pre-filled.

It is possible to specify initial values for headers (e.g. subject, cc, etc.) and message body in the URL. Blanks, carriage returns, and linefeeds cannot be directly embedded but must be percent-encoded:
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:someone@example.com?subject=This%20is%20the%20subject&amp;cc=someone_else@example.com&amp;body=This%20is%20the%20body&quot;&gt;Send email&lt;/a&gt;

Multiple addresses can be specified:
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:someone@example.com,someoneelse@example.com&quot;&gt;Send email&lt;/a&gt;

The address can be omitted:
&lt;a href=&quot;mailto:?subject=mailto%20with%20examples&amp;body=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMailto&quot;&gt;Share this knowledge...&lt;/a&gt;Only the initial header must use a question mark (?) prepended. All subsequent headers require an ampersand (&amp;). Should this not be the case, the scheme will not properly copy over the headers to the email client.

==Security and privacy==
A number of security issues are mentioned in RFC 6068, one of them being robotic address harvesting. Mailto constructs are locatable within HTML pages by automated means which typically include the use of DOM constructs or regular expressions. Addresses harvested by such means are liable to be added to spammers&#x27; mass-mailing lists and thus to receive large amounts of unwanted mail.

While methods exist to &quot;harden&quot; mailto links against harvesting—address munging and JavaScript-based address obfuscation among them—these protections can be circumvented by sufficiently sophisticated harvesting robots. Other techniques, like walling the address behind a CAPTCHA or similar &quot;humanity check&quot;, provide security on par with that available for other contact methods, most notably web forms, which experience similar challenges with preventing spam.

<text>Silver Strand Falls drops 574 feet (175m) along Meadow Brook, at the western end of Yosemite Valley, within Yosemite National Park. The falls are commonly thought to drop 1170 feet (356m); this is incorrect. The name Widow&#x27;s Tears had been applied to Silver Strand Falls in the past, but the lower-volume waterfall located one drainage to the east of Meadow Brook is now known as Widow&#x27;s Tears and is thought to drop , hence the confusion regarding the height.

Note that the recent 1:24,000 topo map of Yosemite Valley shows the height of this waterfall as , not , which is derived, apparently, from ice climbers. Since the waterfall is not vertical, it is possible that the ice-climbing height is, in fact, , while the difference in elevation between the top and bottom is as shown on the topo sheet at .

The origin of the number &quot;1,170 feet&quot; for the height either of this or of nearby Widow&#x27;s Tears is obscure. But in any case, this height is not supported either by a field survey or by the topo sheet. It appears that the Widow&#x27;s Tears drop more or less steeply in a square alcove for about , then proceeds to drop at generally lower angle an additional over a series of small stepdowns and slabs.

Since both Silver Strand and Widow&#x27;s Tears are located on streams draining small, relatively low areas, they both dry up completely in a normal year by mid June since they are fed exclusively by melting snow.

<doc id="934323" wikidata="Q1134057" url="?curid=934323" title="Lèse-majesté">
<text>Lèse-majesté or lese-majesty ( , ) is an offence or defamation against the dignity of a ruling head of state (traditionally a monarch but now more often a president) or of the state itself. The English name for this crime is a modernised borrowing from the medieval French, where the phrase meant . In classical Latin, meant &#x27;hurt/violated majesty&#x27; or &#x27;injured sovereignty&#x27; (originally with reference to the majesty of the sovereign people, in post-classical Latin also of the monarch).

The concept of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; expressed the idea of a criminal offence against the dignity of the Roman Republic of ancient Rome. In the Dominate, or late Empire period (from the 3rd century CE), the emperors continued to distance themselves from the republican ideals of the Roman Republic, and increasingly equated themselves with the state. Although legally the (the emperor&#x27;s official title, meaning, roughly, &#x27;first citizen&#x27;) could never become a sovereign because the republic was never officially abolished, emperors were deified as divus, first posthumously but later (by the Dominate period) while still reigning. Deified emperors enjoyed the same legal protection that was accorded to the divinities of the state cult; by the time Christianity replaced paganism in the Roman Empire, what was in all but name a monarchical tradition had already become well established.

Narrower conceptions of offences against majesty as offences against the Crown predominated in the European kingdoms that emerged in the early medieval period. In feudal Europe, legal systems classified some crimes as &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; even if they were not intentionally or specifically directed against the Crown. For example: counterfeiting ranked as &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; because coins bore the monarch&#x27;s effigy and/or coat of arms.

With the decline of absolute monarchy in Europe, &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; came to be viewed there as a less serious crime. However, certain malicious acts formerly classified as involving the crime of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; could still be prosecuted as treason. Some republics still classify any offence against the highest representatives of the state as a crime. &quot;Lèse-majesté&quot; laws still apply as well in monarchies outside of Europe, notably in modern Thailand and Cambodia.

==Current laws==

===Europe===

==== Belarus ====
On 31 January 2022, a woman in Belarus was handed an 18-month prison sentence for &quot;insulting&quot; the country&#x27;s President, Alexander Lukashenko, and other authorities after pictures mocking the officials were found on her phone.

==== Denmark ====
In Denmark, the monarch is protected by the usual libel paragraph (§267 of the Danish Penal Code which allows for up to four months of imprisonment), but §115 allows for doubling of the usual punishment when the reigning monarch is target of the libel. When a queen consort, queen dowager or the crown prince is the target, the punishment may be increased by 50%. There are no historical records of §115 having ever been used, but in March 2011, Greenpeace activists who unfurled a banner at a dinner at the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference were charged under this section. They were acquitted of the charge relating to the monarch but received minor sentences for other crimes.

====Estonia====

Insulting a foreign dignitary, their representatives or family members, or desecrating their flag or anthem can be punished by up to two years of imprisonment according to the Penal Code §247 and §249.

====Germany====

Until 2017, it was illegal to publicly insult foreign heads of state. On 25 January 2017, the German justice minister Heiko Maas announced a decision by the cabinet to remove this law from the German criminal code, effective 1 January 2018. The decision came several months after Chancellor Angela Merkel announced in April 2016 a controversial decision to honour the Turkish government&#x27;s request to prosecute a German comedian for reading an obscene poem about Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on late-night television. In that announcement, Merkel also stated the intention to consider repeal of the little-known law. The prosecution was dropped in November 2016.

Insulting the federal president is still illegal, but prosecution requires the authorisation of the president. However, German members of Parliament can and have been sanctioned for denouncing the head of state during debates. Given that the president is recognized as an unbiased symbol of unity, it is not considered appropriate or acceptable for politicians to criticise him or her in public.

====Iceland====
Insulting a country, foreign head of state, its representatives or flag can be punished by up to two years of imprisonment according to the 95th article of the penal code. For a very serious breach, the term can be extended to six years.

====Italy====
Impugning the honour or prestige of the president of Italy is punishable with one to five years in jail. This includes personal offences made regarding their exercise of powers or otherwise, with no distinction between past or current events or between the public and private spheres.

In 2019, former Northern League leader Umberto Bossi was sentenced to a year and 15 days in jail after using the racial slur &quot;terrone&quot; in reference then-president Giorgio Napolitano&#x27;s southern origins, but was later pardoned by the then president Sergio Mattarella.

Similarly, it is also illegal to violate the prestige of foreign flags and emblems; a similar law concerning foreign heads of state was repealed in 1999.

====Netherlands====
In 1966, Dutch cartoonist Willem depicted Queen Juliana of the Netherlands as a window prostitute in the 1st issue of the &quot;Provo movement&quot; cartoon magazine, &quot;&quot;. He was sued for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, but the judge eventually acquitted him of the charge. Willem moved to France afterwards.

&quot;Lèse-majesté&quot; of the King was punishable with up to five years in prison and/or a fine. The insulting of the Royal Consort, the heir apparent or their consort, or the Regent, was punishable by four years in prison and/or a fine. In the same vein, the insulting of an allied head of state, who is in the Netherlands in their official capacity, was punishable by up to two years and/or a fine.

In total, 18 prosecutions were brought under the law between 2000 and 2012, half of which resulted in convictions. In October 2007, a 47-year-old man was sentenced to one week&#x27;s imprisonment and fined €400 for, amongst other things, calling Queen Beatrix a &quot;whore&quot; and telling a police officer that he would have anal sex with her because &quot;she would like it&quot;. In July 2016, a 44-year-old man was sentenced to 30 days in jail for &quot;intentionally insulting&quot; King Willem-Alexander, accusing him of being a murderer, thief and rapist.

These laws have been abolished as of January 1, 2020. Insulting the King, the Royal Consort, the heir apparent or their consort, or the Regent, is now punishable on the same level as public officials in their official capacity, which adds one-third to the maximum severity of the punishment of three months in prison and/or a fine. Prosecutions do still take place. On 23 January 2020, an individual was sentenced to 40 hours community service for insulting the Dutch Queen Máxima Zorreguieta, referring to her as the daughter of a murderer (she is the daughter of Jorge Horacio Zorreguieta, who served as a minister in the Argentine military regime of Jorge Rafael Videla).

====Poland====

In Poland, it is illegal to insult foreign heads of state publicly.

*On 5 January 2005, left-wing magazine publisher Jerzy Urban was sentenced by a Polish court to a fine of 20,000 złoty (about €5,000, £3,400 or US$6,200) for having insulted Pope John Paul II, a visiting head of state.
*On 26–27 January 2005, 28 human rights activists were temporarily detained by the Polish authorities for allegedly insulting Vladimir Putin, a visiting head of state. The activists were released after about 30 hours, and only one was actually charged with insulting a foreign head of state.

Article 135 of the Polish penal code states that anyone who publicly insults () the President of Poland is punishable by up to three years of imprisonment. Prior to March 2021, the Polish Constitutional Tribunal declared the law consistent with the Polish constitution and Polish international treaty obligations, arguing that the effective carrying out of the duties of the president requires having authority and being especially respected.

, there had been at least one conviction, and there were several ongoing legal cases under the law. In December 2020, a man in Toruń was sentenced to six months of community service, 20 hours per month, under &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;, for having drawn a penis on a poster of president Andrzej Duda. The man&#x27;s act of writing &quot;five years of shame&quot; on the poster and drawing an &quot;X&quot; symbol on the president&#x27;s image were not considered insulting by the judge in the final hearing. On 23 March 2021, three pupils appeared in court in Kalisz for a 10-minute incident in June 2020 in Sulmierzyce, in which a family member of a town councillor video-recorded the pupils pulling down a poster of president Andrzej Duda, cutting the poster, using insulting words, and proposing to burn the poster. , the three pupils risked three years&#x27; imprisonment under &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;.

The writer and journalist Jakub Żulczyk was charged under &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; in March 2021 for referring to president Andrzej Duda as a &quot;moron&quot; () in online social media in the context of comments criticising Duda&#x27;s description of Joe Biden&#x27;s 2020 United States presidential election victory.

====Russia====
In March 2019, the Russian Federal Assembly passed a law criminalising publication of online statements that are found &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;disrespectful&quot; towards Russian state or government officials (including the president), stipulating fines of up to 100,000 roubles for first-time offenders, and 200,000 roubles or up to 15 days imprisonment for repeat offenders.

====Spain====
Articles 490 and 491 of the criminal code govern &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; (in Spanish , &#x27;insults to the Crown&#x27;). Any person who defames or insults the king, the queen, their ancestors or their descendants can be imprisoned for up to two years. The Spanish satirical magazine was fined for violation of Spain&#x27;s &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; laws after publishing an issue with a caricature of the then Prince of Asturias, current King Felipe VI, and his wife engaging in sexual intercourse on the cover of one of their issues in 2007.

On 23 December 2020, the Audiencia Nacional summoned 12 individuals accused of offence against the crown for having pulled down mock statues of Christopher Columbus and incumbent King Felipe VI on the Day of Hispanity in Pamplona earlier that year, following a report drawn up by the National Police and Civil Guard, as stated by the accused.

On 13 March 2018, the European Court of Human Rights ruled against Spain for punishing with imprisonment two protesters in Girona, Catalonia, convicted of burning pictures depicting the King of Spain. On 17 February 2021, there were huge protests over Catalan rapper Pablo Hasél&#x27;s arrest for violation of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; laws. Later that year, Belgium denied the extradition to Spain of the Catalan rapper Valtonyc, prosecuted for allegedly insulting the king and incitement to terrorism.

====Switzerland====
In Switzerland, it is illegal to insult foreign heads of state publicly.

Any person who publicly insults a foreign state in the person of its head of state, the members of its government, its diplomatic representatives, its official delegates to a diplomatic conference taking place in Switzerland, or one of its official representatives to an international organisation or department thereof based or sitting in Switzerland is liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty.

=== Middle East===

==== Iran ====
Iranian courts have given prison sentences for insulting the Supreme Leader of Iran or the judicial system of Iran.

====Jordan====
In September 2012, pro-reform activists faced charges of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; following protests in two locations in Jordan. The protests turned violent after the activists reportedly chanted slogans against the Jordanian regime and insulted King Abdullah II and the Royal Court.

In August 2014, Mohammad Saeed Baker, a member of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s shura council, was arrested in Jordan and sentenced to six months in prison for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;. He was released in February 2015. In April 2021, following an incident where a female Jordanian was sentenced for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; after saying that she believed her father was better than the king, King Abdullah II instructed courts to abandon ruling in cases related to &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; in Jordan.

====Kuwait====
In the State of Kuwait, a charge of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; is punishable with two years&#x27; imprisonment. In January 2009 a Kuwaiti-Australian woman spent six months in prison for allegedly insulting the Emir of Kuwait during a dispute with Kuwaiti immigration authorities.

====Qatar====
In 2013, a Qatari poet was sentenced to 15 years in prison for criticizing former Emir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.

====Saudi Arabia====
Under the counterterrorism law that took effect in 2014, actions that &quot;threaten Saudi Arabia’s unity, disturb public order, or defame the reputation of the state or the king&quot; are considered acts of terrorism. The offense may carry harsh corporal punishment, including lengthy jail terms and even death, with the sentences potentially determined on a case-by-case basis, owing to the arbitrary nature of the Saudi legal system.

====Turkey====
Under Turkish law it is illegal to insult the Turkish nation, the Turkish Republic, Turkish government institutions, and Turkish national heroes. Additionally, according to Law No. 5816, insulting or swearing against the founder and First President of the country, Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, will be punished with imprisonment from one year to three years. It is also illegal to insult the President of Turkey, with the scope of such indictment affecting comical and satirical depictions. 
*Bahadır Baruter and Özer Aydoğan, two Turkish cartoonists from , were arrested for insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
*On 18 September 2020, the lawyer of Turkey&#x27;s president, Hüseyin Aydın, filed a complaint against Greek newspaper () over a derogatory headline run. The headline, , meaning &quot;Fuck off Mr. Erdogan&quot; in Turkish, appeared next to the photo of the president. The headline also included an English translation.
*In October 2020, a French political comic magazine, &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot;, faced possible charges in Turkey over insulting President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The cover of the magazine involved an image of Erdoğan lifting his wife&#x27;s dress while sitting in a chair drunk.

===Africa===

====Mauritius====

Mauritians are routinely prosecuted for statements deemed offensive to the members of the Jugnauth Government (which has been in power from 2015 till late November 2024). In 2019, Patrick Hofman, a former pilot for Air Mauritius, was deported for having called the Prime Minister, Pravind Jugnauth, a &quot;lunatic&quot;. The Prime Minister had the citizenship law changed so that his absolute authorization is needed for any immigrant who wishes to stay in Mauritius. The law was changed specifically to be able to deport Hofman as a &quot;prohibited immigrant&quot;, thereby ostracizing him and his Mauritian spouse out of the country. When his Mauritian spouse subsequently died, Hofman was still not allowed to enter Mauritius for her funeral rites. The question was raised directly to the Prime Minister himself in Parliament.

Similarly, the social media law has been changed in Mauritius to allow the Government (via the police) to jail anyone who criticizes them on social media. The person targeted has only to feel &quot;annoyed&quot; for the police to arrest the critic. Hassenjee Ruhomaully and his spouse, Farirah Ruhomaully have both (in separate instances) been taken out of bed in the early hours of the morning, to be jailed for having &quot;annoyed&quot; a member of Government. The couple was jailed for having shared a photo, on social media, of the spouse of the Prime Minister, Kobita Jugnauth, (also called Lady Macbeth) hugging one of their (former) advisors.

In 2022, a former adviser of the Prime Minister, Gerard Sanspeur (who left after witnessing the blatant corruption and theft by the members of Government), was arrested after commenting on a post about the Minister of ICT. In an operation of damage control where it was proved that the Prime Minister allowed the Indian Government to illegally tap on the SAFE fiber optic cable in total disregard of the consortium of countries who own the cable, the IT Minister (who has no IT background ) claimed that a laptop used to tap this cable would have exploded(Not Possible) from the amount of data from the SAFE cable during a public conference.

In October 2022, Bradley Vincent, the athlete who has the highest number of medals ever brought to Mauritius, was suspended for three years by the Mauritius Olympic Committee for arriving late to the flag raising ceremony in Birmingham where the Prime Minister was present. Vincent came late with three other athletes, since the bus picking them up was delayed in traffic. While the other athletes got away with a severe warning, Vincent was suspended for three years, seemingly for having questioned why the athletes did not get the £100 per diem that they had been told they would have.

====Morocco====
Moroccans are routinely prosecuted for statements deemed offensive to the king. The minimum penalty for such a statement is one year&#x27;s imprisonment if the statement is made in private (i.e. not broadcast), and three years&#x27; imprisonment if made in public. Either way, the maximum is 5 years.

The cases of Yassine Belassal and Nasser Ahmed (a 95-year-old who died in jail after being convicted of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;), and the Fouad Mourtada Affair, revived the debate on these laws and their applications. In 2008, an 18-year-old was charged with &quot;breach of due respect to the king&quot; for writing &quot;God, Homeland, Barça&quot; on a school board, in reference to his favorite football club and satirising the national motto (&quot;God, Homeland, King&quot;).

In February 2012, 18-year-old Walid Bahomane was convicted for posting two cartoons of the king on Facebook. The procès-verbal cites two Facebook pages and a computer being seized as evidence. Walid was officially prosecuted for &quot;touching the sacralities&quot;.

====Senegal====
Offending the Head of State is punishable by a prison sentence of six months to two years and a fine of 100,000 to 1,500,000 CFA (180 to 2,700 USD).

====Zimbabwe====
Prosecutions still take place under the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, punishable by up to one year in jail or a fine of up to Z$4,800 (US$13.26),

===Asia===

====Bhutan====
Although Bhutan transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy in 2008, the country&#x27;s royalty are still considered gods incarnate, making criticism of the royalty punishable under blasphemy laws.

====Brunei====
&quot;Lèse-majesté&quot; is a crime in Brunei Darussalam, punishable with prison sentences of up to three years.

====Cambodia====
In February 2018, the Parliament of Cambodia voted to make insulting any monarch punishable with between one and five years in prison, along with a fine of 2 to 10 million riel.

In January 2019, a Cambodian man was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts. This is the second sentence handed down under the law.

====Indonesia====
The current Indonesian criminal code (KUHP) (to be repealed in 2 January 2026) criminalizes defamation of the president and vice president of Indonesia, inherited directly from similar laws in the Netherlands.

This was then inherited by the new KUHP to commence in 2 January 2026, with threats of imprisonment from 18 to 54 months or a fine from Rp10 million to Rp200 million.

====North Korea====
The Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System mandate reverence for former North Korean president Kim Il Sung, and his successor Kim Jong Il. Some suggest that the execution of Jang Song Thaek in 2013 may have been related to him clapping &quot;half-heartedly&quot; at the 3rd Conference of the Worker&#x27;s Party of Korea, however most emphasize the importance of factional disputes in causing his execution. South Korean and international media agencies have claimed North Korean officials have been executed for &quot;dozing off&quot; in official meetings, especially following the execution of Kim Yong Jin in 2016, citing anonymous sources.

====Malaysia====
Malaysia uses the Sedition Act 1948 to charge people for allegedly insulting the royal institution. In 2013, Melissa Gooi and four other friends were detained for allegedly insulting the royal institution.

In 2014, Ali Abd Jalil was detained and served 22 days in prison for insulting the royal family of Johor and Sultan of Selangor. A prison sentence was passed in Johor for attacking the royal family to Muhammad Amirul Azwan Mohd Shakri.

Malaysian royalty is one of the components of 3R (Race, Religion and Royalty) of which citizens are not allowed to criticise.

====Thailand====
Thailand&#x27;s criminal code has carried a prohibition against &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; since 1908. In 1932, when Thailand&#x27;s monarchy ceased to be absolute and a constitution was adopted, it too included language prohibiting &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;. The 2016 Constitution of Thailand, and all previous versions since 1932, contain the clause, &quot;The King shall be enthroned in a position of revered worship and shall not be violated. No person shall expose the King to any sort of accusation or action.&quot; The Thai criminal code elaborates in Article 112: &quot;Whoever defames, insults or threatens the King, Queen, the Heir-apparent or the Regent, shall be punished with imprisonment of three to fifteen years.&quot; Missing from the code, however, is a definition of what actions constitute &quot;defamation&quot; or &quot;insult&quot;. From 1990 to 2005, the Thai court system only saw four or five &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; cases a year. From January 2006 to May 2011, however, more than 400 cases came to trial. Observers attribute the increase to increased polarization following the 2006 military coup and sensitivity over the elderly king&#x27;s declining health. In 2013, the Supreme Court of Thailand ruled in case no. 6374/2556 that Article 112 of the Penal Code protects past kings as well as the present one. Criticism or comments which tarnish past kings or the monarchy are punishable by law. However, scholars raised doubts as to how far back &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; will be applied as the present Thai monarchy (Chakri dynasty) dates back more than 200 years while other monarchies which ruled Siam can be traced back almost 800 years.

Neither the king nor any member of the royal family has ever personally filed any charges under this law. In fact, during his birthday speech in 2005, King Bhumibol Adulyadej encouraged criticism: &quot;Actually, I must also be criticized. I am not afraid if the criticism concerns what I do wrong, because then I know.&quot; He later added, &quot;But the King do wrong&quot;, in reference to those he was appealing to not to overlook his human nature.

Under the NCPO junta which overthrew the democratic regime in May 2014, charges of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; have increased significantly, especially against the opponents of the junta. &quot;Lèse-majesté&quot; is now seeing increasing use as a tool to stifle free speech and dissent in the country. Even the parents of the former princess Srirasmi Suwadee as well as her uncle have been charged with &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;. On 9 March 2015, a court sentenced her father Apiruj Suwadee and mother Wanthanee for insulting the royal family and lodging a malicious claim. They pleaded guilty to the offenses named and were sentenced to two-and-a-half years in prison. On 9 June 2017 in Bangkok a 33-year-old Thai man by the first name of Wichai was given 35 years imprisonment for posting 10 Facebook photos and comments about the Thai royalty. This sentence was reduced from the initial 70 years following a guilty plea made after a year in jail before the trial.

In June 2017, the United Nations called on Thailand to amend its law on &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;.

===South America===

====Brazil====
Brazilian Law contains in its Penal Code three types of criminal offenses against the honor of people in general:

* Slander: Falsely imputing something defined as a crime to someone, which has a penalty of detention for between six months to two years, and a fine.
* Defamation: Falsely imputing an offensive behavior to someone&#x27;s reputation, which has a penalty of detention for between three months to one year, and a fine.
* Injury: Offending the dignity or decorum of someone, which has a penalty of detention for between one and six months, or a fine.

These penalties can be increased by one third when practiced against the President of the Republic. The Brazilian Penal Code states that crimes against life or freedom of the President of the Republic are subject to Brazilian law, even if committed abroad. The law is also expanded to apply the penalties for slander or defamation against other authorities, such as members of the Federal Senate, the Chamber of Deputies or the Supreme Federal Court, with penalty of imprisonment, from 1 to 4 years.

In March 2019, the Supreme Federal Court opened an investigation which has been handled in secrecy at the Court, to investigate attacks and fake news involving the court and its members. The inquiry has been heavily criticized by the media because of its use to censor articles published by newspapers, including one about a member of the court being possibly named by Marcelo Odebrecht in a ramification of Operation Car Wash. The criticized inquiry is still ongoing and has been used by the court to request other actions, including the investigation of some supporters of the former president of the country, Jair Bolsonaro, causing a crisis between the two branches of the Brazilian government.

==Former laws==
===Asia===
====Japan====

Laws against offending the Emperor of Japan were in place between 1880 and 1947, when the law was abolished, during the United States-led Allied occupation. The last person to be convicted of the crime was Shōtarō Matsushima, a factory worker and member of the Japanese Communist Party. During a 1946 protest against food shortages in front of the Imperial Palace, during which the protesters demanded entry into the palace kitchens which were said to be stocked with staple foods, Matsushima wielded a placard reading, on the one side, &quot;Imperial Edict: The Emperor system has been preserved. I, the Emperor, have eaten to my heart&#x27;s content, but you, my subjects, should starve to death! Signed, (Imperial Seal)&quot;. The other side demanded that the Emperor give a public accounting of the food shortages. Matsushima was arrested and charged with impairing the dignity of the Emperor. The Allied occupation authorities intervened and had the charges reduced to libel. Matsushima was convicted and sentenced to eight months in prison, but was pardoned immediately under an Imperial amnesty commemorating the new Constitution.

===Europe===
==== Belgium ====
On 28 October 2021, Belgium&#x27;s Constitutional Court ruled that a law dating from 1847 which penalised insulting the monarch with a fine or imprisonment violates the right to freedom of expression as guaranteed under the Belgian Constitution as well as the European Convention on Human Rights. The law was repealed in January 2023.

====Nazi Germany====

Adolf Hitler&#x27;s cult of personality served as a powerful force for political integration in Nazi Germany, often shielding him from criticism that frequently targeted other Nazi leaders and the regime. His image partly relied on his role in the recovery of the economy of Nazi Germany, contributing to the (perceived) legitimacy of his charismatic authority. But some dissent simmered beneath the surface, with outbursts prompting journalists to coin the term (, approximating ). Most arrests for were reported in working-class districts, where the insults were also most forceful.

Hitler was often identified as a megalomaniac or a criminal (e.g., a self-proclaimed classmate said Hitler was a &quot;crook&quot; who tortured animals). Many insults were scatological, drawing on the Swabian salute as in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Götz von Berlichingen&quot;, or sexual, as when a night-watchman in Vienna was arrested for claiming he slept with Hitler. Others were more serious, even wielding the Nazis&#x27; own metaphors, as when a furnace apprentice called Hitler and Hermann Göring insects in need of extermination.

After the 1939 Bürgerbräukeller Bombing, there were reports of arrests for comments &quot;that the attempt on the Führer&#x27;s life was simply a result of his repression of the Catholic population&quot;. A mechanic in Wiener Neustadt was arrested for saying the attackers deserved medals. Three others in Vienna were also arrested for similar remarks; one suggested he would kill Hitler himself.

====Norway====
Following the 2005 Penal Code (introduced in 2015), &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; is no longer considered a criminal offense.

The 1902 Penal Code, article 101, provided a fine or up to five years of prison for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot;. According to article 103, prosecution had to be ordered or accepted by the king. Article 101 stated: &quot;If any defamation is exercised against the King or the Regent, the guilty is punished with a fine or up to five years of prison.&quot;

==== Romania ====
In Romania, the &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; laws were abolished in 2014, after the adoption of the 2009 Penal Code. However, Article 30.7 of the Romanian constitution specifies that defamation of the state and the nation shall be prohibited by law. 

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the laws for &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; were cancelled in 1948.

====United Kingdom====
The Treason Felony Act 1848 makes it an offence to advocate for the abolition of the monarchy. Such advocation is punishable by up to life imprisonment under the Act. Though still in the statute book, the law is no longer enforced in practice.

Section 51 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 abolished the common law criminal offences of sedition and &quot;leasing-making&quot; in Scottish law. The latter offence was considered an offence of &quot;lèse-majesté&quot; or making remarks critical of the monarch of the United Kingdom. The final prosecution for this offence had occurred in 1715.

===North America===
====United States====
The Sedition Act, enacted in 1798, forbade criticism of the President of the United States or of the Federal government; the law was denounced as unconstitutional by its opponents, but was never brought before the Supreme Court. It expired in 1801. Modern jurisprudence concerning the First Amendment to the United States Constitution would make such laws unconstitutional.

<text> fa : صف بندی بر اساس کلاس
Class-based queuing (CBQ) is a queuing discipline for the network scheduler that allows traffic to share bandwidth equally, after being grouped by classes. The classes can be based upon a variety of parameters, such as priority, interface, or originating program.

CBQ is a traffic management algorithm developed by the Network Research Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as an alternative to traditional router-based technology. Now in the public domain as an open technology, CBQ is deployed by companies at the boundary of their WANs.

CBQ divides user traffic into a hierarchy of classes based on any combination of IP addresses, protocols and application types. A company&#x27;s accounting department, for example, may not need the same Internet access privileges as the engineering department. Because every company is organized differently and has different policies and business requirements, it is vital for traffic management technology to provide flexibility and granularity in classifying traffic flows. 

CBQ lets network managers classify traffic in a multilevel hierarchy. For instance, some companies may first identify the overall needs of each department or business group, and then define the requirements of each application or group of applications within each department. For performance and architectural reasons, traditional router-based queuing schemes are limited to a small number of classes and only allow one-dimensional classification. 

Because it operates at the IP network layer, CBQ provides the same benefits across any Layer 2 technology and is equally effective with any IP protocol, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). It also operates with any client or server TCP/IP stack variation, since it takes advantage of standard TCP/IP flow control mechanisms to control end-to-end traffic.

An implementation is available under the GNU General Public License for the Linux kernel.

<text>Capcir (; ) is a historical Catalan comarca of Northern Catalonia, now part of the French department of Pyrénées-Orientales. The capital of the comarca was Formiguera, and it borders the historical comarques of Conflent and Alta Cerdanya. Capcir is on a plateau, averaging 1500 metres above sea level, and allows passage between the high valleys of Aude and both the Spanish Cerdanya and French Cerdagne. It has traditionally been rural, but has developed considerably in last the forty years thanks to its tourist attractions. Capcir has two nicknames: little Siberia or little Canada. This gives an idea of the climate which can prevail during the winter. It is one of the last places in Western Europe where the arctic plant Ligularia sibirica can be found .

<text>Frank Leslie (March 29, 1821 – January 10, 1880) was an English-born American engraver, illustrator, and publisher of family periodicals.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Leslie was born on March 29, 1821, in Ipswich, England as Henry Carter, the son of Joseph Carter, the proprietor of a long-standing and prosperous glove manufacturing firm. He was educated in Ipswich and he then trained for commerce in London. As a boy on his way to and from school, he passed a silversmith&#x27;s shop whose workers he took a detailed interest in, especially those who engraved designs and letters upon various articles of silver and gold. He took note of the tools that were used and the manner of using them and acquired the necessary tools to do the work himself. At the age of 13, he did his first wood engraving of the coat of arms of his home town.

At 17, he was sent to London to learn more about the glove-making business in the extensive dry goods establishment of his uncle, but every moment that could be snatched from the &quot;dreary drudgery of the desk&#x27;s dead wood&quot; was surreptitiously devoted to sketching, drawing or engraving. His father, uncle and relatives so discouraged his artistic aspirations, that he was constrained to keep his work a secret from them.
He contributed sketches to the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot;, signing them as Frank Leslie to insure his anonymity. These were so cordially welcomed that he eventually gave up commerce and was made superintendent of engraving on that journal. He made himself an expert and inventor in his new work. It was here that he learned the operation known as overlaying – the system of regulating light and shade effects – in pictorial printing, a system which he was the first to introduce to the United States.

He was first married in England, and had three sons with his first wife, Harry, Alfred and Scipio. He and she separated in 1860. He legally changed his name to Frank Leslie in 1857.

===United States===

In 1848 he came to the United States, in 1852 working for &quot;Gleason&#x27;s Pictorial&quot; in Boston. He discovered he could accelerate the engraving process significantly by dividing a drawing into many small blocks and distributing the work among many engravers. A job on a large-format wood engraving which might have taken a month for a single wood engraver to complete, could be completed in a day by 30 engravers.

In 1853, he arrived in New York City to engrave woodcuts for P. T. Barnum&#x27;s short-lived &quot;Illustrated News&quot;. After its failure, he began publishing the first of his many illustrated journalistic ventures, &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Ladies&#x27; Gazette of Fashion and Fancy Needlework&quot;, with good woodcuts by Leslie &amp; Hooper, a partnership which dissolved in 1854. &quot;The New York Journal&quot; soon followed, with &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot; (1855) (called &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Weekly&quot;), &quot;The Boy&#x27;s and Girl&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, &quot;The Budget of Fun&quot;, and many others. &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;, which included news as well as fiction, survived until 1922.

Illustrations made by Leslie and his artists on the battlefield during the American Civil War are well regarded for their historical value. 
He was commissioner to the Paris Exhibition of 1867 and received a prize there for his artistic services.

===Second wife===
When the editor of Frank Leslie&#x27;s &quot;Lady&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, Ephraim Squier, had fallen ill, the then Miriam Folline Squier volunteered to fill in, and the ill editor still received the salary. Mrs. Squier took on the position permanently; in 1873 she divorced her ill husband and shortly thereafter, about 1874, she and Leslie were married. It was his second marriage, and her third. Their summer home, &quot;Interlaken&quot;, was in Saratoga Springs, New York, where they entertained many notables. In 1877, they undertook a lavish train trip from New York to San Francisco in the company of many friends. Miriam Leslie wrote her book &quot;From Gotham to the Golden Gate&quot; telling the story of this trip. The expense of this trip, and a business depression left Leslie&#x27;s business badly in debt.

Frank Leslie accepted his last illustration (by Georgina A. Davis) in January 1880 and died the same month, the debts amounted to $300,000, and his will was contested. Miriam Leslie took the business in hand and put it on a paying basis, even going so far as to having her name legally changed to Frank Leslie in June 1881. She was a notable feminist and author in her own right. Both his and her remains are interred at Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.
