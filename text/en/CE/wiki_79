<text>[[Pythagoras]] is a prominent impact crater located near the northwestern limb of the Moon. It lies just to the northwest of the somewhat larger Babbage. The crater has an oval appearance due to the oblique viewing angle. Only the western face of the interior can be viewed from the Earth, the other side being permanently out of sight.

The well-preserved rim of Pythagoras has a wide system, and a slight around the exterior. Although generally circular, the crater outline has a hexagonal form. The floor is flattened, but with an irregular, hilly surface. There is evidence of landslips around the periphery. In the center is a sharp, mountainous rise with a double peak that ascends 1.5 kilometers above the crater floor.

Pythagoras is a crater of Eratosthenian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pythagoras.

<doc id="929287" wikidata="Q8081700" url="?curid=929287" title="Ōshima, Nagasaki (Kitamatsuura)">
<text>was a village located on Azuchi-Oshima Island in Kitamatsuura District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the village had an estimated population of 1,659 and a density of 106.89 persons per km2. The total area was 15.52 km2.

On October 1, 2005, Ōshima, along with the towns of Ikitsuki and Tabira (all from Kitamatsuura District), was merged into the expanded city of Hirado.

== Economy ==
The main occupations on the island are fishing, including fish farming, and farming. Crops include tobacco, rice, and potatoes. One use of Ōshima&#x27;s rice is in the brewing of sake. Other occupations include local government and school teachers. There are also over a dozen wind turbines beautifully located on the island. This wind farm is operated by the company Mitsuuroko Green Energy. The installation consists of 16 Vestas V80-2.0MW with a nameplate capacity of 32000 kW. It began full operation in 2007.

== Access ==
Ōshima can only be reached via a ferry boat from Hirado Port. It takes approximately 45 minutes to get to the island and there are five departures every day in each direction.

== Education ==
There is a public primary school, middle school, and nursery. In March 2011, the only high school on the island closed its doors after its last nine students graduated. During its last three years as an institution, there were as many students as teachers. This closure was due to the general declining birthrate in Japan. Three years earlier the school had stopped accepting incoming students. The building was transferred to the City of Hirado and turned into a community center. Some of the former students at the high school were boarders, some were trouble kids in other schools. The boarders also served to keep up the student numbers in Ōshima&#x27;s small population.

==Entertainment==

Ōshima has a pachinko parlor, a snack tavern (karaoke), as well as two &quot;izakaya&quot;.

<doc id="929291" wikidata="Q11574569" url="?curid=929291" title="Ikitsuki, Nagasaki">
<text>was a town on the island of the same name located in Kitamatsuura District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 7,392 and a density of 445.84 people per km2. The total area was 16.58 km2.

On October 1, 2005, Ikitsuki, along with the town of Tabira and the village of Ōshima (all from Kitamatsuura District), was merged into the expanded city of Hirado.

Ikitsuki is known historically for two primary reasons: a legacy of whaling and hidden Christians. Near the south end of the island is a museum with exhibits on both these aspects of Ikitsuki&#x27;s history.

Nearly all the people of Ikitsuki live on the east side of the island. The west side faces out into the open ocean (sea) and is very windy. In addition, much of the west side of the island is cliff-face, with only a few spots which are flat enough even for terraced farming.

The scenery is stunning in Ikitsuki, and has attracted a great number of domestic tourists since road access was available through bridges connecting Hirado Island with the mainland and Ikitsuki Island to Hirado. The dialect of Ikitsuki can be difficult to understand, even for Japanese people who live in nearby towns. However, this is more true among the older people, and &quot;standard&quot; Japanese is spoken in educational and governmental settings.

==Economy==
Ikitsuki&#x27;s economy is still mainly supported by a niche fishing industry. As fishing and agriculture, in general, are in decline in Japan and other industrialized nations in the world, Ikitsuki&#x27;s fishing fleet, as well as its tax base, has been declining in recent years. However, as Ikitsuki has traditionally been dependent on specialty catches, namely squid (&quot;ika&quot;), and flying fish (&quot;ago&quot;), the island has weathered Japan&#x27;s shrinking fishing industry better than most other rural communities.

==Education==
There are two elementary schools on Ikitsuki: Ikutsuki Elementary School (生月小学校) and Yamada Elementary School (山田小学校). There is one junior high – Ikutsuki Middle School (生月中学校). There is no high school; kids are required to commute off of the island. Many go to high schools in the surrounding communities (Hirado, Tabira, Shikamachi), while a few venture all the way to more academically rigorous high schools in Sasebo and Nagasaki, the two largest cities in Nagasaki Prefecture.

==Transport==

===Air===
The nearest airport is Nagasaki Airport in Ōmura City. By car, it is three hours away. Approximately the same distance away is Fukuoka Airport in Fukuoka City (Fukuoka Prefecture), which is a large regional air hub in Asia.

===Rail===
There are no rail links to Ikitsuki. The nearest rail station is in Tabira (now a part of Hirado), which is approximately 40 minutes away by car.

===Automobile===

The Ikitsuki bridge allows automobile access from Ikitsuki to Hirado and the rest of Japan. Previously, the only option to travel off the island was by ferry to various ports in Kyūshū. Since the merger of Ikitsuki into Hirado City, tolls on the bridge have significantly decreased. Before October 1, 2005, tolls were 450 yen one way for a yellow plate car (small) and 600 yen for a white plate (large). This has since decreased threefold to 150 yen one way for yellow plate cars, and 200 yen for white plate cars. From April 1, 2010, no fee is required to pass the Ikitsuki Bridge.

Access to mainland Kyūshū is through a separate bridge on Hirado Island. It takes about 30 minutes to drive from Ikitsuki to Hirado.

The bridge connecting Ikitsuki to the neighboring Hirado Island is the longest continuous truss bridge in the world, measuring in at 1312 ft (400 meters).

====Principal roads====
*Nagasaki Prefectural Highway 42: Hirado-Ikitsuki Line
*Ikitsuki Bridge Toll Road (大橋生月)

==Places of interest==

===Ikitsuki Island Museum===
This museum, near the bridge connecting Hirado and Ikitsuki, prominently displays the history of Ikitsuki Island. Featured are legacies of the old whaling industry, as well as the presence of hidden Christians. A full whale skeleton is on display in the main atrium, as well as other numerous artifacts from Ikitsuki&#x27;s history. Other odds and ends include a famous sumo wrestler from the island. The gift shop features canned whale and whale hotdogs among its items. Admission is 500 yen, and the museum is open daily.

===Ikitsuki Daigyoran Kannon Statue===
The Ikitsuki Daigyoran Kannon Statue is the largest bronze statue in Japan. The massive statue, completed on April 29, 1980, is 18 meters tall and weights 150 metric tons. It rests on a 3-meter stone foundation, inside of which one can find a Buddhist altar.

&quot;In Japanese Buddhism, Kannon is the Bodhisattva of compassion, and is therefore different from a Buddha as depicted by the famous bronze statues in Nara and Kamakura. The Ikitsuki Daigyoran Kannon prays for world peace and the safety of those that are out on the sea. It also mourns over all shipwrecked people and marine animals.&quot;

===Yamada Church===
This church is the last remaining one in Nagasaki Prefecture to have an organized group of Hidden Christians (Kakure Kirishitan) in practice and existence. Located near Yamada Elementary School, this small church holds much history as one of the first and last outposts of Christian belief and persecution in Japan.

==People from Ikitsuki==

* Takanowaka, one of the top hundred sumo wrestlers in Japan, was born and raised in Ikitsuki. He visits the island annually after competing in the Grand Sumo tournament in Fukuoka City each November.
* Genjirō Kaneko, politician and member of the Liberal Democratic Party, former Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.

<doc id="929295" wikidata="Q633422" url="?curid=929295" title="Ojika, Nagasaki">
<text>is a town located in Kitamatsuura District, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan.

It covers the island of the same name Ojika, located north of Gotō Islands.

As of the 2020 census, the town has an estimated population of 2,288 and a density of 90 persons per km2. The total area is 25.46 km².

The islands of Ojika are part of Saikai National Park.
==History==
The town of Ojika is made up of 17 large and small islands, six of which are populated: Ojika, Madara, Kuroshima, Noshima, Mushima, and Ōshima. Over 20 volcanoes can be found in the sea surrounding the island. The area has been called the &quot;Eastern Galapagos Island.&quot; The main island is approximately 34 km in circumference, with all islands totaling 97 km in circumference. The islands are found within the boundaries of Saikai National Park, preserving the region&#x27;s natural heritage.

Stone tools dated from 10,000 B.C. have been discovered on the islands, along with other relics. The first mention of Ojika was in Nihon Shoki in the 8th century. Although Ojika Island is one of the smallest islands in the Gotō Islands, it was characterized as the entrance to the East China Sea. Around the year 1600, whaling became a major industry, with certain families such as the Oda family profiting from the trade. The Oda Whaling Guild, based in Ojika, established a whaling base on Hirado Island in 1692 and operated until 1859. The present day Ojika History Museum was the former home of the Oda family.

71% of trade ceramics on the Gotō Islands were found at sites throughout the islands of Ojika, with another 22% found from the neighboring Ukushima. In 2001, archeological survey was carried out by the Ojika City Board of Education in conjunction with the Kyushu and Okinawa Society for Underwater Archeology at the underwater site of Yamami, situated on a small reef 100 meters from the eastern shore of Ojika in the Karamizaki ward. A number of shards of Thai stoneware, as well as Chinese blue and white pottery, likely from Jingdezhen, dating to the 16th and 17th centuries were found. Many of the ceramics can now be found at the Ojika History Museum. It is likely that many wokou, island pirates, were active around Ojika and Uku.

Ojika and the now-abandoned, neighboring island of Nozaki were some of the islands settled by the Hidden Christians who fled mainland Japan after the ban of Christianity by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 16th century. Following the repeal of the ban in 1873, a small church, the Nokubi Christian Church, was built on Nozaki. The remains of the villages on Nozaki are now included as the UNESCO World Heritage Site Hidden Christian Sites in the Nagasaki Region.

== Demographics ==
The population of Ojika peaked in the 1950s at roughly 11,000. Today the population of the island is rapidly decreasing, and is now around half the number as in the 1970s. The remaining islanders have largely gathered on the main island and abandoned some of the smaller outlying islands, such as Nozaki. Nozaki was abandoned by the six remaining families in 1971 after a pregnant woman died in childbirth with no doctor present due to stormy weather making the island inaccessible. In 2015, 46.4% of the population of Ojika was above 65 years old, compared to the national average of 26.8%, a common trend among other remote islands in Japan. The local government has promoted initiatives for &quot;U-turn&quot;, where former residents return to the islands, and &quot;I-turn&quot;, where newcomers settle on the islands from more urban areas, such as an agricultural school that guarantees free land use following graduation.

Because of the stressed financial situation of the town, the local community discussed whether the town should merge with Sasebo, but ultimately decided not to do so and remain as a single town in April 2008.

The island hosts the Ojika International Music Festival and Kids Camping Kingdom, as well as various other activities promoting sightseeing. Nozaki Island, though abandoned, has been developed as an eco-camp with a number of hiking trails. Nature programs targeted for elementary and junior high school students began in 2001, using a former school building as accommodation for these groups. Besides tourism, major industries include fishing and farming. A wide variety of Ojika&#x27;s marine products are famous, such as chicken grunt, amberjack, beltfish, and abalone. The Ojika islands are one of the most important abalone fishing areas in Nagasaki Prefecture, with a tradition of abalone fishing dating back over 300 years. 
==Major sights==
===Akahama coast===
Ojika islands are made up of volcanic rocks, thus much of the coast consists of red sands.

===Chinokoujima Shrine===

Chinokoujima Shrine (地ノ神嶋神社) consists of a rare torii which is composed of three parts. Maegata Bay is adjacent to the shrine - a twin shrine, Okinokoujima, is directly opposite of Chinokoujima on Nozaki Island.

===Hime no Matsubara===

A 450 meter long avenue of pine trees, this avenue has been selected as the best of 100 pine tree locations in Japan, and the best of 8 sights in the Hokusho region.

=== Kominka ===
In 2007, the Ojika municipal government began a program of converting century-old private houses known as kominka (古民家) into lodging. All the homes were donated by the houses&#x27; original owners, which were then renovated and restored. Six houses, one restaurant, and one guesthouse have so far been converted.

== Ecology ==
The native forests of Ojika were cut down in order to create space for rice paddies and cattle farming. The remaining forest has been largely colonized by invasive species brought to the island as a result of trade with Japan and China over the centuries.

The main island of Ojika is surrounded by a shallow underwater plateau with an extensive rocky seabed around the islands. This contributes to breeding and fishing grounds for abalone, which are caught once or twice per year using a form of breath-hold diving. Abalone are dependent on the presence and quality of macroalgae beds, which has significantly degraded around the Ojika islands, contributing the gradual decline in the annual landed catches of abalone since the late 1980s. Decreases and disappearances of macroalgal beds have affected the two main species of abalone, &quot;Haliotis discus&quot; and &quot;Haliotis gigantea&quot;, differently. &quot;H. discus&quot; has been able to mature and the catch per unit effort (CPUE) has remained stable. However almost no &quot;H. gigantea&quot; were able to mature due to the loss of macroalgal beds and the population will become locally extinct without intervention for the recovery of the macroalgal beds.

The sea star &quot;Ophidaster multispinus&quot;, previously found only in the Hainan Strait of southern China, was first identified in Japan in the Ojika islands.

== Transportation ==
Ojika can be reached by two ferry lines, one from Fukuoka which is a five-hour journey, and the other from Sasebo, which takes about two hours.

Although there is an airport on the island, it does not have regular service. Instead, planes can be chartered to Ojika during the higher parts of the tourist seasons.

<text>Asylum Records is an American record label, founded in 1971 by David Geffen and partner Elliot Roberts. It was taken over by Warner Communications (now the Warner Music Group) in 1972, and later merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records.

After previous incarnations, it is geared primarily towards hip-hop, along with rock and alternative metal. It is owned and distributed by Warner Music Group.

==History==

===Formation===

Asylum was founded in 1971 by David Geffen, and partner Elliot Roberts, both of whom had previously worked as agents at the William Morris Agency, and operated a folk/rock label. They had also previously founded their own management company. While unsuccessfully pitching a recording contract for their client Jackson Browne to Atlantic Records president Ahmet Ertegun, Geffen said, &quot;You&#x27;ll make a lot of money.&quot; Ertegun replied, &quot;You know what, David, I have a lot of money. Why don&#x27;t you start a record company and then you&#x27;ll have a lot of money.&quot; A deal was then struck in which Ertegun would put up the initial funds, Atlantic Records would distribute Asylum Records, and the profits would be split 50/50.

Although they knew they would sign Browne, the first act that Geffen asked to join the label was his close friend Laura Nyro, whose career he was managing at the time. Nyro initially agreed, but without Geffen&#x27;s knowledge she changed her mind and re-signed with Columbia Records. Geffen said it was the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point and that he &quot;cried for days&quot;.

Asylum&#x27;s early releases were distributed by Atlantic Records. The same year, Asylum signed Jo Jo Gunne, Linda Ronstadt, John David Souther, Judee Sill, David Blue, Joni Mitchell and Glenn Frey (whom Geffen encouraged to form the Eagles, with Don Henley, Bernie Leadon, and Randy Meisner). In 1972, then folk-based singer/songwriter Tom Waits signed with the label, releasing his debut, &quot;Closing Time&quot;, in 1973. His seventh and final album for the label, &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot;, was released in 1980. Former Creedence Clearwater Revival frontman John Fogerty signed with the label in 1974. The biggest coup for Asylum was signing Bob Dylan, who had been with Columbia Records since the early 1960s but who, after a falling-out with the company, was shopping around for a new label. Dylan recorded two albums, &quot;Planet Waves&quot; and the live &quot;Before the Flood&quot;, for Asylum before returning to Columbia. Columbia reissued Dylan&#x27;s two Asylum albums in 1981.

===Merger with Elektra Records===

Asylum was taken over by Warner Communications in 1973 and merged with Elektra Records to become Elektra/Asylum Records. David Geffen and Elliot Roberts each received $2 million in cash and $5 million in Warner Communications stock, thereby becoming two of the company&#x27;s largest shareholders. Geffen served as president and chairman of Elektra/Asylum Records until 1975, when he crossed over to film and was named vice-chairman of Warner Bros. One of Asylum&#x27;s most prominent signings after Geffen&#x27;s departure was Warren Zevon, who released a series of successful and critically acclaimed LPs for the label; his self-titled 1976 label debut has been called the best California rock album of the decade.

By the early 1980s, although the copyright lines on albums still read &quot;Elektra/Asylum Records&quot; or &quot;Elektra/Asylum/Nonesuch Records&quot;, Elektra was becoming the more prominent of the two labels with Asylum turning into a secondary imprint. By the middle of the decade, the company was unofficially calling itself Elektra Records, and in 1989 it was renamed Elektra Entertainment. By this time Asylum&#x27;s remaining acts had been shifted to the Elektra roster, although catalog recordings and reissues continued to be sold with the Asylum label on them.

===Country format===
Asylum was reformatted into a country music label, still operated by Elektra, in 1992. Under the new format, Asylum scored successful recordings by such acts as Emmylou Harris, Brother Phelps, Thrasher Shiver, Kevin Sharp, Bryan White, and Lila McCann. They also produced many critically acclaimed albums by artists such as George Jones, Mandy Barnett, Guy Clark, The Cox Family, Bob Woodruff, Monte Warden, JD Myers and Jamie Hartford (although the last two artists&#x27; albums were initially shelved. By the end of the decade, however, mismanagement and a lack of promotion money led to the dissolution of the Asylum country label.

In 2003, Mike Curb, head of Curb Records, revived the Nashville division of Asylum, forming a new label known as Asylum-Curb. LeAnn Rimes, Clay Walker, Lee Brice, Rio Grand, Hank Williams, Jr. and Wynonna were among the artists on the Asylum-Curb division.

===Relaunch===
After being dormant for several years, Asylum Records was revived as an urban music-based label in 2004, with some of its releases distributed in conjunction with Warner Bros. Records and others through Atlantic Records. Asylum found success with American rapper Paul Wall. Asylum released Paul Wall&#x27;s commercial debut studio album, &quot;The Peoples Champ&quot;‚ in September 2005. The album debuted and peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, and was ultimately certified Platinum in America. In 2006, WMG shifted Asylum to operate under their newly created Independent Label Group, which also comprises Cordless Recordings and East West Records. In December 2006, Asylum Records announced the signing of Atlanta, Georgia-based metal band Sevendust, the first non-hip-hop artist to be signed to the newly reconfigured label. On March 30, 2009, Asylum president and CEO Todd Moscowitz was promoted to co-president of Warner Bros. Records Inc. Subsequently, Asylum was detached from the Independent Label Group and operated under Warner Bros. from 2009 to 2013 before being moved to Atlantic. Cee Lo Green was signed to the label as well as New Boyz and Ed Sheeran. The label achieved its first number 1 hit on the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Feel the Love&quot; by Rudimental in May 2012. The label was relaunched in the US in 2017, operating separately from the UK label.

== History ==
The onset of the 1950s brought rapid growth, with coal extraction bringing the railway and many new workers to Sechibaru. When the coal ran out, the town had only its older tea industry to rely on, which lacked the economic strength to keep the trains or people coming back.

On April 1, 2005, Sechibaru, along with the town of Yoshii (also from Kitamatsuura District), was merged into the expanded city of Sasebo.

<text>ATCO Records is an American record label founded in 1955. It is owned by Warner Music Group and operates as an imprint of Atlantic Records. After several decades of dormancy and infrequent activity under alternating Warner Music labels, the company was relaunched by Atlantic Records in early 2020.

==History==
===1950s–1960s: Beginnings===
ATCO Records was devised as an outlet for productions by one of Atlantic Records&#x27; founders, Herb Abramson, who had returned to the company from military service. The label was also intended as a home for acts that did not fit the format of the main Atlantic brand, which was releasing blues, jazz, rhythm and blues and soul. The planned name for the label was Atlas. But it was changed to ATCO when it was discovered there was already an Atlas Records. The ATCO name is an abbreviation of ATlantic COrporation. ATCO also provided distribution for other labels, including RSO, Volt, Island, Modern, Ruthless, Hansa, and Rolling Stones. For most of its history, ATCO was known for pop and rock music, but during its early years, it produced some jazz albums. These included Harry Arnold, Betty Carter, King Curtis, Herb Geller, Roland Hanna, and Helen Merrill.

ATCO&#x27;s rock era began with Bobby Darin and The Coasters. In the early 1960s, Atlantic began to license material from international sources, leading to instrumental hit singles from Jorgen Ingmann, Acker Bilk and Bent Fabric. Starting in the mid-1960s, ATCO moved into rock-and-roll with Sonny and Cher, Buffalo Springfield, Vanilla Fudge, Iron Butterfly and Cream (the latter under license from British label Polydor).

In 1964, ATCO released a single in the US by the Beatles, &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; (flip side &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, with lead singer Tony Sheridan), which had been recorded in Hamburg in 1961. With lead vocals by John Lennon, &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; reached No. 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart in August 1964. It featured new drums overdubbed by session drummer Bernard Purdie.

ATCO also released an album entitled &quot;Ain&#x27;t She Sweet&quot; which featured the other two tracks by Sheridan and The Beatles from the Hamburg session and filled out by eight other songs covered by The Swallows.

In 1966, ATCO released &quot;Substitute&quot; by the Who. The song was issued through an arrangement with UK Polydor Records because of the dispute The Who was having with their producer, Shel Talmy, and their contract with US Decca Records and UK Brunswick Records. This would be the only Who recording to appear on ATCO, although Pete Townshend and John Entwistle would eventually sign to ATCO as solo artists, and Roger Daltrey later signed a US solo deal with Atlantic. This release differs from the UK release with a different structure/edit (the break comes in after the first verse vs. second), a substitute lyric (&quot;I try walking forward but my feet walk back&quot; in place of &quot;I look all white but my dad was black&quot;).

===1970s–1980s: Downsizing ===
During the 1970s, Atlantic Records began to broaden the range of its own roster, causing ATCO to become deemphasized as many of its acts would eventually have their material released under the main Atlantic brand. In the middle 1970s, ATCO became increasingly used for hard rock acts and some British and European bands. During this time, the label issued early albums from AC/DC. Starting in 1978, however, AC/DC releases were issued on Atlantic until their contract with the label ended in the 1990s. In 1980, ATCO&#x27;s visibility rose with strong chart performances from Pete Townshend&#x27;s &quot;Empty Glass&quot; album and the song &quot;Cars&quot; by Gary Numan. As the 1980s wore on, ATCO continued to have streamlined success with artists such as Sweet Sensation, JJ Fad and Michel&#x27;le (the latter who were signed to the label in conjunction with Ruthless Records), while steadily becoming less active overall.

===1990s: Merger with EastWest Records America and dormancy===
The last number one hit on ATCO was &quot;If Wishes Came True&quot; by Sweet Sensation in 1990. The following year, Atlantic Records Senior VP Sylvia Rhone orchestrated the merger of ATCO with Atlantic&#x27;s fledgling EastWest Records America label and briefly operated the combination as Atco/EastWest Records. By 1994, however, the ATCO name was dropped and the label reverted to the EastWest Records America branding. During this time, EastWest moved its operations to Atlantic&#x27;s sister label Elektra Records. As a result of Elektra&#x27;s takeover of EastWest, ATCO&#x27;s back catalog and retained artists were now under its control. In the decade to come, the ATCO name and logo would be occasionally used on reissues of past material, but the imprint itself was now dormant.

===2000s: Revival under Rhino Entertainment===
In 2005, after more than a decade in hibernation, ATCO (in a joint venture with Rhino Records) released the soundtrack of the Bobby Darin biopic &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, which starred Kevin Spacey and featured his renditions of Darin&#x27;s songs. This led to Warner Music Group reactivating the label in 2006 in conjunction with Rhino. Scarlett Johansson, Keith Sweat and Art Garfunkel were among the first artists signed to the label. Garfunkel issued &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot; on January 30, 2007. Johansson issued &quot;Anywhere I Lay My Head&quot; on May 20, 2008. Queensrÿche released its &quot;American Soldier&quot; album on ATCO on March 31, 2009. The New York Dolls released its album &quot;Cause I Sez So&quot; on ATCO on May 5, 2009. Shortly thereafter, ATCO would become dormant again.

===2020s: Return to Atlantic Records and second relaunch===
In 2020, ATCO returned to the aegis of Atlantic Records, where it was relaunched. On February 14, &quot;Billboard&quot; announced that Atlantic Records President of A&amp;R Pete Ganbarg was appointed president of the newly relaunched ATCO Records. Ganbarg&#x27;s first ATCO signing is Philadelphia-based alternative act Zero 9:36.

<doc id="929323" wikidata="Q718294" url="?curid=929323" title="Origin of the Albanians">
<text>The origin of the Albanians has been the subject of historical, linguistic, archaeological and genetic studies. The first mention of the ethnonym &quot;Albanoi&quot; occurred in the 2nd century AD by Ptolemy describing an Illyrian tribe who lived around present-day central Albania. The first attestation of Albanians as an ethnic group is in the 11th century.

Albanians have a western Paleo-Balkan origin. Besides the Illyrians, theories regarding which specific ancient Paleo-Balkan group had participated in the origin of the Albanians vary between attributing Thracian, Dacian, or another Paleo-Balkan component whose language was unattested. Among those scholars who support an exclusively Illyrian origin, there is a distinction between those who propose a direct continuity from Illyrian times, and those who propose an in-migration of a different Illyrian population. However, these propositions are not mutually exclusive. The Albanians are also one of Europe&#x27;s ethnic groups with the highest number of common ancestors within their own ethnic group even though they share ancestors with other ethnic groups.

Albanian is an Indo-European language and the only surviving representative of its own branch, which belongs to the Paleo-Balkan group, having its formative core in the Balkans after the Indo-European migrations in the region. Early Proto-Albanian speakers came into contact with Doric Greek (West Greek) since the 7th century BCE, and with Ancient Macedonian during the 5th–4th centuries BCE. Thereafter they also had contacts with Koine Greek. Proto-Albanian speakers came into contact with Latin after the Roman conquest of the Western Balkans in the 2nd century BCE, but the major Latin influence in Proto-Albanian occurred during the first years of the common era onwards, when the Western Balkans were eventually incorporated into the Roman Empire after the Great Illyrian Revolt (6–9 CE). Latin loanwords were borrowed through the entire period of spoken Latin in the Western Balkans, reflecting different chronological layers and penetrating into almost all semantic fields. Proto-Albanian speakers were Christianized under the Latin sphere of influence, specifically in the 4th century CE.

All aspects of Albanian tribal society have been directed by the Albanian traditional law code, which is of interest to Indo-European studies as it reflects many legal practices of great antiquity that find precise echoes in Vedic India and ancient Greece and Rome. The surviving pre-Christian elements of Albanian culture indicate that Albanian mythology and folklore are of pagan Paleo-Balkanic origin.

==Endonyms==
===Arbënesh===
The two ethnonyms used by Albanians to refer to themselves are &quot;Arbënesh(ë)&quot;/&quot;Arbëresh(ë)&quot; and &quot;Shqiptar(ë)&quot;. &quot;Arbënesh&quot; is the original Albanian endonym and forms that basis for most names of Albanians in foreign languages and the name of Albania as a country. Greek &quot;Arvanitai&quot;, &quot;Alvanitai&quot; and &quot;Alvanoi&quot;, Turkish &quot;Arnaut&quot;, Serbo-Croatian &quot;Arbanasi&quot; and others derive from this term. The ethnic name &quot;Albanian&quot; was used by Latin and Byzantine sources in the forms &quot;arb-&quot; and &quot;alb-&quot; since at least the 2nd century A.D, and eventually in Old Albanian texts as an endonym. The ancient attestation of the ethnic designation is not considered strong evidence of an Albanian continuity in southern Illyria, since there are many examples in history of an ethnic name shifting from one ethnos to another. Nevertheless, the ancient ethnonym gave rise to the Albanian old endonym, early generalized to all the tribes of Illyria who spoke the same idiom. The process was similar to the spread of the name &quot;Illyrians&quot; from a small group of people on the Adriatic coast, the &quot;Illyrioi&quot;.

Albanians gradually replaced their old endonym by the term &quot;Shqiptar&quot;, a change most likely trigged after the Ottoman conquests of the Balkans in the 15th century. The words &quot;Shqipëri&quot; and &quot;Shqiptar&quot; are attested from 14th century onward, but it was only at the end of 17th and beginning of the early 18th centuries that the placename and the ethnic demonym &quot;Shqiptarë&quot; gradually replaced &quot;Arbëria&quot; and &quot;Arbëreshë&quot; amongst Albanian speakers. The usage of the old endonym &quot;Arbënesh/Arbëresh&quot;, however, persisted and was retained by Albanian communities which had migrated from Albania and adjacent areas centuries before the change of the self-designation, namely the Arbëreshë of Italy, the Arvanites of Greece as well as the Arbanasi in Croatia. As such, the medieval migrants to Greece and later migrants to Italy during the 15th-century are not aware of the term &quot;Shqiptar&quot;.

=== References to Albania ===
*In the 2nd century BC, the &quot;History of the World&quot; written by Polybius, mentions a location named &quot;Arbona&quot; (; Latinised form: &quot;Arbo&quot;) in which some Illyrian troops, under Queen Teuta, scattered and fled to in order to escape the Romans. Arbona was perhaps an island in Liburnia or another location within Illyria.
*The names Albanoi and Albanopolis have been attested in ancient funeral inscriptions in present-day North Macedonia. The toponym Albanopolis has been found on a funeral inscription in Gorno Sonje, near the city of Skopje (ancient Scupi), present-day North Macedonia. It was excavated in 1931 by Nikola Vulić and its text was curated and published in 1982 by Borka Dragojević-Josifovska. The inscription in Latin reads &quot;POSIS MESTYLU F[ILIUS] FL[AVIA] DELVS MVCATI F[ILIA] DOM[O] ALBANOP[OLI] IPSA DELVS&quot; (&quot;Posis Mestylu, son of Flavia Delus, daughter of Mucat, who comes from Albanopolis&quot;). It dates to the end of the 1st century AD and the beginning of the 2nd century AD.
*In the 2nd century AD, Ptolemy, the geographer and astronomer from Alexandria, drafted a map that shows the city of Albanopolis, located Northeast of Durrës) in the Roman province of Macedonia and the tribe of Albanoi, which were viewed as Illyrians by later historians.
*The ethnonym Albanos was found on a funeral inscription from ancient Stobi in present-day North Macedonia, near Gradsko about 90 km to the southeast of Gorno Sonje. The inscription in ancient Greek reads &quot;ΦΛ(ΑΒΙΩ) ΑΛΒΑΝΩ ΤΩ ΤΕΚΝΩ ΑΙΜΙΛΙΑΝΟΣ ΑΛΒΑΝΟ(Σ) ΜΝΗΜ(Η)Σ [ΧΑΡΗΝ]&quot; (&quot;In memory of Flavios Albanos, his son Aemilianos Albanos&quot;). It dates to the 2nd/3rd century AD.
*In the 6th century AD, Stephanus of Byzantium, in his important geographical dictionary entitled &quot;Ethnica&quot; (Ἐθνικά), mentions a city in Illyria called &quot;Arbon&quot; (), and gives an ethnic name for its inhabitants, in two singular number forms, i.e. &quot;Arbonios&quot; (; pl. &quot;Arbonioi&quot;) and &quot;Arbonites&quot; (; pl. &quot;Arbonitai&quot;). He cites Polybius (as he does many other times in &quot;Ethnica&quot;).

===References to the Albanians in medieval sources===
Michael Attaleiates (1022-1080) mentions the term &quot;Albanoi&quot; twice and the term &quot;Arbanitai&quot; once. The term &quot;Albanoi&quot; is used first to describe the groups which rebelled in southern Italy and Sicily against the Byzantines in 1038–40. The second use of the term &quot;Albanoi&quot; is related to groups which supported the revolt of George Maniakes in 1042 and marched with him throughout the Balkans against the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The term &quot;Arvanitai&quot; is used to describe a revolt of Bulgarians (Boulgaroi) and &quot;Arbanitai&quot; in the theme of Dyrrhachium in 1078–79. It is generally accepted that &quot;Arbanitai&quot; refers to the ethnonym of medieval Albanians. As such, it is considered to be the first attestation of Albanian as an ethnic group in Byzantine historiography. The use of the term &quot;Albanoi&quot; in 1038-49 and 1042 as an ethnonym related to Albanians have been a subject of debate. In what has been termed the &quot;Ducellier-Vrannousi&quot; debate, Alain Ducellier proposed that both uses of the term referred to medieval Albanians. Era Vrannousi counter-suggested that the first use referred to Normans, while the second did not have an ethnic connotation necessarily and could be a reference to the Normans as &quot;foreigners&quot; () in Epirus which Maniakes and his army traversed. The debate has never been resolved. A newer synthesis about the second use of the term &quot;Albanoi&quot; by Pëllumb Xhufi suggests that the term &quot;Albanoi&quot; may have referred to Albanians of the specific district of Arbanon, while &quot;Arbanitai&quot; to Albanians in general regardless of the specific region they inhabited.

* The &quot;Arbanasi&quot; people are recorded as being &#x27;half-believers&#x27; and speaking their own language in a Bulgarian text found in a Serbian manuscript dating to 1628; the text was written by an anonymous author that according to Radoslav Grujić (1934) dated to the reign of Samuel of Bulgaria (997–1014), or possibly, according to R. Elsie, 1000–1018.
* In &quot;History&quot; written in 1079–1080, Byzantine historian Michael Attaliates referred to the &quot;Albanoi&quot; as having taken part in a revolt against Constantinople in 1043 and to the &quot;Arbanitai&quot; as subjects of the duke of Dyrrhachium. It is disputed, however, whether the &quot;Albanoi&quot; of the events of 1043 refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense or whether &quot;Albanoi&quot; is a reference to folks from southern Italy under an archaic name (there was also a tribe of Italy by the name of &quot;Albani&quot;). However a later reference to Albanians from the same Attaliates, regarding the participation of Albanians in a rebellion in 1078, is undisputed. That rebellion was led by Nikephoros Basilakes, doux of Dyrrhachium.
* Some authors (like Alain Ducellier, 1968) believe that &quot;Arvanoi&quot; are mentioned in Book IV of the &quot;Alexiad&quot; by Anna Comnena (c. 1148). Others believe that this is a wrong reading and interpretation of the Greek phrase &quot;ἐξ Ἀρβάνων&quot; (i.e. ‘from Arvana’) found in the original manuscript and in one edition (Bonn, 1839) of the &quot;Alexiad&quot;.
* The earliest Serbian source mentioning &quot;Albania&quot; (Ar&#x27;banas&#x27;) is a charter by Stefan Nemanja, dated 1198, which lists the region of Pilot (Pulatum) among the parts Nemanja conquered from Albania (ѡд Арьбанась Пилоть, &quot;de Albania Pulatum&quot;).
* In the 12th to 13th centuries, Byzantine writers used the name &quot;Arbanon&quot; () for a principality in the region of Kruja.
*The oldest reference to Albanians in Epirus is from a Venetian document dating to 1210, which states that “the continent facing the island of Corfu is inhabited by Albanians”.
*A Ragusan document dating to 1285 states: &quot;I heard a voice crying in the mountains in Albanian&quot; .

== Language ==
===Pre-Indo-European linguistic substratum===

Pre-Indo-European sites are found throughout the territory of Albania; such as in Maliq, Vashtëm, Burimas, Barç, Dërsnik in Korçë District, Kamnik in Kolonja, Kolsh in Kukës District, Rashtan in Librazhd and Nezir in Mat District. As in other parts of Europe, these migratory Indo-European tribes entered the Balkans and contributed to the formation of the historical Paleo-Balkan tribes, to which Albanians trace their origin. The previous populations – during the process of assimilation by the immigrating IE tribes – have played an important part in the formation of the various ethnic groups generated by their long symbiosis. Consequently, the IE languages that developed in the Balkan Peninsula, in addition to their natural evolution, have also been impacted by the idioms of the assimilated pre-Indo-European people. In terms of linguistics, the pre-Indo-European substrate language spoken in the southern Balkans has probably influenced pre-Proto-Albanian, the ancestor idiom of Albanian. The extent of this linguistic impact cannot be determined with precision due to the uncertain position of Albanian among Paleo-Balkan languages and their scarce attestation. Some loanwords, however, have been proposed, such as and ; compare with pre-Greek . Albanian is also the only language in the Balkans which has retained elements of the vigesimal numeral system – , – which was prevalent in the pre-Indo-European languages of Europe; such as the Basque language, which broadly uses vigesimal numeration.

This pre-Indo-European substratum has also been identified as one of the contributing factors to the customs of Albanians.

=== Attestation ===
The first attested mention of Albanian occurred in 1285 at the Venetian city of Ragusa (present-day Dubrovnik, Croatia) when a crime witness named Matthew testified: &quot;I heard a voice crying in the mountains in Albanian&quot; ().

The earliest attested written specimens of Albanian are Formula e pagëzimit (1462) and Arnold Ritter von Harff&#x27;s lexicon (1496). The first Albanian text written with Greek letters is a fragment of the &quot;Ungjilli i Pashkëve&quot; (Passover Gospel) from the 15 or 16th century. The first printed books in Albanian are &quot;Meshari&quot; (1555) and Luca Matranga&#x27;s &quot;E mbsuame e krështerë&quot; (1592).

However, as Fortson notes, Albanian written works existed before this point; they have simply been lost. The existence of written Albanian is explicitly mentioned in a letter attested from 1332, and the first preserved books, including both those in Gheg and in Tosk, share orthographic features that indicate that some form of common literary language had developed.

=== Toponymy ===

In the Balkans and southern Italy, several toponyms, river and mountain names which have been attested since antiquity can be explained etymologically via Albanian or have evolved phonologically through Albanian and later adopted in other languages. Inherited toponyms from a Proto-Albanian language and the date of adoption of non-Albanian toponyms indicate in Albanology the regions were the Albanian language originated, evolved and expanded. Depending on which proposed etymology and phonological development linguists support, different etymologies are usually used to link Albanian to Illyrian, Messapic, Dardanian, Thracian or an unattested Paleo-Balkan language.
*Brindisi is a town in southern Italy. &quot;Brundisium&quot; was originally a settlement of the Iapygian Messapians, descendants of an Illyrian people who migrated from the Balkans to Italy in Late Bronze/Early Iron Age transition. The name highlights the ties between Messapic to Albanian as Messapic &quot;brendo&quot; (stag) is linked to Old Gheg &quot;bri&quot; (horns).
*Bunë is a river in northwestern Albania, near the cities of Shkodër and Ulcinj (Ulqin). The majority of scholars consider it a directly inherited hydronym from Illyrian &quot;Barbanna&quot;. A less accepted proposition by Eqrem Çabej considers it an unrelated name which derives from &quot;buenë&quot; (overflow of waters). The hydronym Bunë via which Slavic &quot;Bojana&quot; emerged, is often seen as indication that Albanian was spoken in the pre-Slavic era in southern Montenegro.
*Drin is a river in northern Albania, Kosovo and North Macedonia. Similar hydronyms include Drino in southern Albania and Drina in Bosnia. It is generally considered to be of Illyrian origin.
*Durrës is a city in central Albania. It was founded as an ancient Greek colony and greatly expanded in Roman times. It was known as &quot;Epidamnos&quot; and &quot;Dyrrhachion&quot;/&quot;Dyrrhachium&quot;. &quot;Dyrrhachium&quot; is of Greek origin and refers to the position of the city on a rocky shore. The modern names of the city in Albanian (&quot;Durrës&quot;) and Italian (&quot;Durazzo&quot;, ) are derived from &quot;Dyrrachium&quot;/&quot;Dyrrachion&quot;. An intermediate, palatalized antecedent is found in the form &quot;Dyrratio&quot;, attested in the early centuries AD. The palatalized /-tio/ ending probably represents a phonetic change in the way the inhabitants of the city pronounced its name. The preservation of old Doric /u/ indicates that the modern name derives from populations to whom the toponym was known in its original Doric pronunciation. The initial stress in Albanian &quot;Durrës&quot; presupposes an Illyrian accentuation on the first syllable. Theories which support local Illyrian-Albanian continuity interpret Durrës &lt; Dyrratio as evidence that Albanian-speakers continuously lived in coastal central Albania. Other theories propose that the toponym doesn&#x27;t necessarily show continuity but can equally be the evolution of a loanword acquired by a Proto-Albanian population which moved in the city and its area in late antiquity from northern Albanian regions.
*Epidamnos is the oldest known name of Durrës and it is the first name under which the ancient Greek Corinthian colony was known. It is widely considered to be of Illyrian origin, as first proposed by linguist Hans Krahe, and is attested in Thucydides (5th century BC), Aristotle (4th century BC), and Polybius (2nd century BC). Etymologically, &quot;Epidamnos&quot; may be related to Proto-Albanian *dami (cub, young animal, young bull) &gt; dem (modern Albanian) as proposed by linguist Eqrem Çabej.
*Erzen is a river in central Albania. It derives from Illyrian &quot;Ardaxanos&quot; (*daksa &quot;water&quot;, &quot;sea&quot;) found in Daksa and the name of the Dassareti tribe. 
*Ishëm is a river in central Albania. It is recorded as Illyrian &quot;Isamnus&quot; in antiquity. Albanian &quot;Ishëm&quot; derives directly from &quot;Isamnus&quot; and indicates that its ancestral language was spoken in the area.
*Mat is a river in northern Albania. It is generally considered to be of Illyrian origin and originally meant &quot;river bank, shore&quot;. It evolved within Albanian as an inherited term from its ancestral language. It indicates that it was spoken in the Mat river valley. A similar hydronym, Matlumë, is found in Kaçanik.
*Nish (&quot;Niš&quot;) is a city in southeastern Serbia. It evolved from a toponym attested in Ancient Greek as (&quot;Naissos&quot;), which achieved its present form via phonetic changes in Proto-Albanian and thereafter entered Slavic. &quot;Nish&quot; might indicate that Proto-Albanians lived in the region in pre-Slavic times. When this settlement happened is a matter of debate, as Proto-Albanians might have moved relatively late in antiquity in the area which might have been an eastern expansion of Proto-Albanian settlement as no other toponyms known in antiquity in the area presuppose an Albanian development. The development of &quot;Nish&quot; &lt; &quot;Naiss-&quot; may also represent a regional development in late antiquity Balkans which while related may not be identical with Albanian.
*Vjosë is a river in southern Albania and northern Greece. In antiquity, it formed part of the boundary between Illyrian and Epirotic Greek languages. In the early Middle Ages, the Vjosa (in Greek, Aoos or Vovousa) river valley was settled by Slavic peoples. A gradual evolution within Albanian and a borrowing by Slavic-speakers or a borrowing from Slavic *Vojusha into Albanian have been proposed for Albanian &quot;Vjosë&quot;. Both propositions are disputed. Regardless of the etymology, the Vjosë valley is an area of Albanian-Slavic linguistic contact from the 6th-7th century onwards.
*Vlorë is a city in southwestern Albania. It was founded as ancient Greek colony &quot;Aulona&quot; (/Avlon/) in the pre-Roman era. Albanian &quot;Vlorë&quot; is a direct derivation from ancient Greek &quot;Aulon&quot;. A proposed Slavic intermediation from *Vavlona has been rejected as it doesn&#x27;t conform to Albanian phonological development. The toponym has two forms, &quot;Vlorë&quot; (Tosk) and &quot;Vlonë&quot; (Gheg), which indicates that it was already in use among the population of Northern Albania before the appearance of rhotacism in Tosk.
*Shkodër is a city in northwestern Albania. It is one of the most significant settlements in Albania and in the pre-Roman era it was the capital of the Illyrian kingdom of Genthius. Late antiquity &quot;Scodra&quot; was a Romanized city, which even relatively late in the Middle Ages had a native Dalmatian-speaking population which called it &quot;Skudra&quot;. Slavic &quot;Skadar&quot; is a borrowing from the Romance name. The origin of Albanian &quot;Shkodër&quot;/&quot;Shkodra&quot; as a direct development of Illyrian &quot;Scodra&quot; or as the development of a Latin loanword in Proto-Albanian is a subject of debate. In theories which reject a direct derivation from &quot;Scodra&quot;, the possible break in linguistic continuity from the Illyrian form is invoked as indication that Albanian was not spoken continuously in Shkodra and the surrounding area from pre-Roman to late antiquity.
*Shkumbin is a river in central Albania. It derives from Latin &quot;Scampinus&quot; which replaced Illyrian &quot;Genusus&quot;, as recorded in Latin and ancient Greek literature. A Slavic intermediation has been rejected. Its inclusion in Latin loanwords into Proto-Albanian and phonetic evolution coincides with the historical existence of a large Roman town (near present-day Elbasan) which gave the river its new name.
*Shtip (&quot;Štip&quot;) is a city in eastern North Macedonia. It was known in antiquity as &quot;Astibo-s&quot;. It is generally acknowledged that Slavic Štip was acquired via Albanian Shtip. About the date of settlement of Proto-Albanians in eastern Macedonia similar arguments as in the case of &quot;Nish&quot; have emerged.

=== Linguistic reconstruction ===
Albanian is attested in a written form beginning only in the 15th century AD. In the absence of prior data on the language, scholars have used Albanian linguistic contacts with Ancient Greek, Latin and Slavic for identifying its historical location. The precursor of Albanian can be considered a completely formed independent IE language since at least the first millennium BCE, with the beginning of the early Proto-Albanian phase. Proto-Albanian is reconstructed by way of the comparative method between the Tosk and Gheg dialects and between Albanian and other Indo-European languages, as well as through contact linguistics studying early loanwords from and into Albanian and structural and phonological convergences with other languages. Loanwords into Albanian treated through its phonetic evolution can be traced back as early as the first contacts with Doric Greek (West Greek) since the 7th century BCE, and with Ancient Macedonian during the 5th–4th centuries BCE, but the most important of which are those from Latin (dated to the period 167 BCE to 400 CE) and from Slavic (dated from 600 CE onward). The evidence from loanwords allows linguists to construct in great detail the shape of Albanian native words at the points of major influxes of loans from well-attested languages.

====Pastoralism====
That Albanian possesses a rich and &quot;elaborated&quot; pastoral vocabulary which has been taken to suggest Albanian society in post-Roman times was pastoral, with widespread transhumance, and stock-breeding particularly of sheep and goats. Joseph takes interest in the fact that some of the lexemes in question have &quot;exact counterparts&quot; in Romanian. The fact that the Albanian language reflects a clear pastoralist stage does not allow conclusions about the Proto-Albanian speakers&#x27; way of life during classical antiquity, as only the speech of the mountain pastoralists managed to survive the Great Migrations.

Albanian-speakers appear to have been cattle breeders given the vastness of preserved native vocabulary pertaining to cow breeding, milking and so forth, while words pertaining to dogs tend to be loaned. Many words concerning horses are preserved, but the word for horse itself is a Latin loan. The original Palaeo-Balkan word for &#x27;horse&#x27;, preserved in Albanian &quot;mëz&quot; or &quot;mâz&quot; &#x27;foal&#x27;, from &quot;*me(n)za-&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;, underwent a later semantic shift &#x27;horse&#x27; &gt; &#x27;foal&#x27; after the loan from Latin &quot;caballus&quot; into Albanian &quot;kalë&quot; &#x27;horse&#x27;. The Albanian name &quot;Mazrek(u)&quot;, which means &#x27;horse breeder&#x27; in Albanian, is found throughout all Albanian regions, and notably it was the name used by the Kastrioti noble family to highlight their tribal affiliation (Albanian: &quot;farefisní&quot;). Also the Palaeo-Balkan word for &#x27;mule&#x27; has been preserved in Albanian &quot;mushk(ë)&quot; &#x27;mule&#x27;.

====Hydronyms====
Concerning the inheritance of hydronymic vocabulary, it has been noted that there were no lexemes relating to seamanship in the Proto-Indo-European language. PIE hydronyms reconstructed so far refer to swamps, marshes, lakes, and riverine environments, but not to the sea. For instance, the Greek term &quot;thalassa&quot; &quot;sea&quot; is Pre-Greek, not an inherited Indo-European word. The Albanian term for &quot;sea&quot; (&quot;det&quot; ), which was considered by some Albanologists to be an inherited term from Proto-Albanian &quot;*deubeta&quot; as a cognate of Proto-Germanic &quot;*deupiþō-&quot; &quot;depth&quot;, is firmly dismissed by present-day historical linguists. Instead, a borrowing from Greek &quot;delta&quot; &quot;river delta&quot; has been proposed recently. At least two other Albanian terms from the same semantic field are early Greek loanwords: &quot;pellg&quot; &quot;pond, basin, depth&quot; from πέλαγος &quot;pelagos&quot; &quot;sea&quot;, and &quot;zall&quot; &quot;riverbank, river sand&quot;, from αι҆γιαλός &quot;sea-shore&quot;, which underwent in Proto-Albanian a semantic shift, indicating for this language a change in location after its contact with Ancient Greek. Also all Albanian words relating to seamanship appear to be loans.

Words referring to large streams and their banks tend to be loans, but &quot;lumë&quot; (&quot;river&quot;) is native, as is &quot;rrymë&quot; (the flow of river water). Words for smaller streams and stagnant pools of water are more often native, except &quot;pellg&quot;. Albanian has maintained since Proto-Indo-European a specific term referring to a riverside forest (&quot;gjazë&quot;), as well as its words for marshes. Albanian has maintained native terms for &quot;whirlpool&quot;, &quot;water pit&quot; and (aquatic) &quot;deep place&quot;, leading Orel to speculate that Albanian was likely spoken in an area with an excess of dangerous whirlpools and depths. The term &quot;mat&quot;, meaning &quot;height&quot;, &quot;beach&quot;, &quot;bank/shore&quot; in Northern Albanian and &quot;beach&quot;, &quot;shore&quot; in Arbëresh, is inherited from Proto-Albanian &quot;*mata&quot; &lt; &quot;*mn̥-ti&quot; &quot;height&quot; (cf. Latin &quot;mŏns&quot; &quot;mountain&quot;), after which the river Mat (and the region with the same name) in north-central Albania was named, which can be explained as &quot;mountain river&quot;. The meaning &quot;bank/shore&quot; hence would have emerged only at a later time (cf. German &quot;Berg&quot; &quot;mountain&quot; in relation to Slavic &quot;*bergъ&quot; &quot;bank/shore&quot;).

====Vegetation====
Regarding forests, words for most conifers and shrubs are native, as are the terms for &quot;alder&quot;, &quot;elm&quot;, &quot;oak&quot;, &quot;beech&quot;, and &quot;linden&quot;, while &quot;ash&quot;, &quot;chestnut&quot;, &quot;birch&quot;, &quot;maple&quot;, &quot;poplar&quot;, and &quot;willow&quot; are loans.

====Social organization====

The original kinship terminology of Indo-European was radically reshaped; changes included a shift from &quot;mother&quot; to &quot;sister&quot;, and were so thorough that only three terms retained their original function; the words for &quot;son-in-law&quot;, &quot;mother-in-law&quot; and &quot;father-in-law&quot;. All the words for second-degree blood kinship, including &quot;aunt&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;nephew&quot;, &quot;niece&quot;, and terms for grandchildren, are ancient loans from Latin.

=== Linguistic contacts ===

====Overall patterns in loaning====
Openness to loans has been called a &quot;characteristic feature&quot; of Albanian. The Albanian original lexical items directly inherited from Proto-Indo-European are far fewer in comparison to the loanwords, though loans are considered to be &quot;perfectly integrated&quot; and not distinguishable from native vocabulary on a synchronic level. Although Albanian is characterized by the absorption of many loans, even, in the case of Latin, reaching deep into the core vocabulary, certain semantic fields nevertheless remained more resistant. Terms pertaining to social organization are often preserved, though not those pertaining to political organization, while those pertaining to trade are all loaned or innovated.

While the words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, the names for fish and for agricultural activities are often assumed to have been borrowed from other languages. However, considering the presence of some preserved old terms related to the sea fauna, some have proposed that this vocabulary might have been lost in the course of time after proto-Albanian tribes were pushed back into the inland during invasions. Wilkes holds that the Slavic loans in Albanian suggest that contacts between the two populations took place when Albanians dwelt in forests 600–900 metres above sea level.

====Greek====
Linguistic contact between Albanian and Greek has been securely dated to the Iron Age. Also contacts between the respective post-PIE languages which gave rise to the two languages also occurred in previous times. Common traces of the Mediterranean-Balkan substratum are considered to date to the common Indo-European phase of Albanian and Greek (c.f. Graeco-Albanian). Innovative creations of agricultural terms shared only between Albanian and Greek, such as &quot;*h₂(e)lbʰ-it-&quot; &#x27;barley&#x27; and &quot;*spor-eh₂-&quot; &#x27;seed&#x27;, were formed from non-agricultural Proto-Indo-European roots through semantic changes to adapt them for agriculture. Since they are limited only to Albanian and Greek, they could be traced back with certainty only to their last common Indo-European ancestor, and not projected back into Proto-Indo-European. Shortly after they had diverged from one another, Albanian, Greek and Armenian, also underwent a longer period of contact (as can be seen, for example, in the irregular correspondence: Greek σκόρ(ο)δον, Armenian &quot;sxtor&quot;, &quot;xstor&quot;, and Albanian &quot;hudhër&quot;, &quot;hurdhë&quot; &quot;garlic&quot;). Furthermore, intense Greek–Albanian contacts have certainly occurred thereafter, with ongoing connections between them in the Balkans from the ancient times, continuing up to the present-days.

Ancient Greek loans in Proto-Albanian originated from two distinct geographical and historical groups: borrowings from the Greek colonies on the Adriatic coast from the 7th century BCE, either directly or indirectly through trade communication in the hinterland; direct borrowings from Greek-speaking populations of ancient Macedonia during the 5th–4th centuries BCE, before the replacement of Ancient Macedonian with Koine Greek. Several Proto-Albanian terms have been preserved in the lexicon of Hesychius of Alexandria and other ancient glossaries. Some of the Proto-Albanian glosses in Hesychius are considered to have been loaned to the Dorik Greek as early as the 7th century BCE. Witczak (2016) specifically points to seven words recorded by the Greek grammarian Hesychius of Alexandria (5th century AD), and particularly to the term &#x27;a kind of earring&#x27;, which was first attested in the work of the choral lyric poet Alcman (fl. 7th century BCE). This means that the ancestors of the Albanians were in contact with the northwestern part of Ancient Greek civilization and probably borrowed words from Greek cities (Dyrrachium, Apollonia, etc.) in the Illyrian territory, colonies which belonged to the Doric division of Greek, or from contacts in the Epirus area. The earliest Greek loans began to enter Albanian circa 600 BC, and are of Doric provenance, tending to refer to vegetables, fruits, spices, animals and tools. This stratum reflects contacts between Greeks and Proto-Albanians from the 8th century BC onward, with the Greeks being either colonists on the Adriatic coast or Greek merchants inland in the Balkans. The second wave of Greek loans began after the split of the Roman empire in 395 and continued throughout the Byzantine, Ottoman and modern periods.

According to Hermann Ölberg, the modern Albanian lexicon may include 33 words of ancient Greek origin, although it can be increased if the Albanian lexicon is properly evaluated. An argument claimed by some scholars as an indication of a location of Albanian further north than present-day Albania in antiquity is the number of loanwords from Ancient Greek, mostly from Doric dialect, which is considered by them relatively small, even though Southern Illyria neighbored the Classical Greek civilization and there were a number of Greek colonies along the Illyrian coastline. For instance, according to Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev there is limited Greek influence in Albanian (See &quot;Jireček Line&quot; of Roman times), and if Albanians had been inhabiting a homeland situated in modern Albania continuously since ancient times, the number of Greek loanwords in Albanian should be higher. However, the number of surviving loanwords is not a valid argument, as many Greek loans were likely lost through replacement by later Latin and Slavic loans, just as notoriously happened to most native Albanian vocabulary. On the other hand, the specifically Northwestern/Doric affiliations and ancient dating of Greek loans imply a specifically Western Balkan Albanian presence to the north and west of Greeks specifically in antiquity, though Huld cautions that the classical &quot;precursors&quot; of the Albanians would be &quot;&#x27;Illyrians&#x27; to classical writers&quot;, but that the Illyrian label is hardly &quot;enlightening&quot; since classical ethnology was imprecise.

Evidence of a significant level of early linguistic contact between Albanian and Greek is provided by ancient common structural innovations and phonologic convergence such as:
*the rise of the close front rounded vowel /y/ (documented in Attic and Koine Greek);
*the rise of dental fricatives;
*the voicing of voiceless plosives after nasal consonants;
*the replacement, with a form that featured a prefix, of the inherited present tense 3rd person singular of the verb &quot;be&quot; (documented in Koine Greek).
Those innovations are limited only to the Albanian and Greek languages and are not shared with other languages of the Balkan sprachbund. Since they precede the Balkan sprachbund era, those innovations date to a prehistoric phase of the Albanian language, spoken at that time in the same area as Greek and within a social frame of bilingualism among early Albanians having to be able to speak some form of Greek.

====Latin and early Romance loans====

Latin loans are dated to the period of 167 BC to 400 AD. 167 BC coincides with the fall of the kingdom ruled by Gentius and reflects the early date of the entry of Latin-based vocabulary in Albanian. It entered Albanian in the Early Proto-Albanian stage and evolved in later stages as a part of the Proto-Albanian vocabulary and within its phonological system. Albanian is one of the oldest languages that came into contact with Latin and adopted Latin vocabulary. It has preserved 270 Latin-based words which are found in all Romance languages, 85 words which are not found in Romance languages, 151 which are found in Albanian but not in Eastern Romance and its descendant Romanian, and 39 words which are found only in Albanian and Romanian. The contact zone between Albanian and Romanian was likely located in eastern and southeastern Serbia. The preservation of Proto-Albanian vocabulary and linguistic features in Romanian highlights that at least partly Balkan Latin emerged as Albanian-speakers shifted to Latin.

The other layer of linguistic contacts of Albanian with Latin involves Old Dalmatian, a western Balkan derivative of Balkan Latin. Albanian maintained links with both coastal western and central inland Balkan Latin formations. Hamp indicates there are words that follow Dalmatian phonetic rules in Albanian, giving as an example the word &quot;drejt&quot; &#x27;straight&#x27; &lt; &quot;d(i)rectus&quot; matching developments in Old Dalmatian &quot;traita&quot; &lt; &quot;tract&quot;. Romanian scholars Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of Albanian, have concluded that Albanian was also heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and Dalmatian. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly less than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that Albanian evolved in a region with much greater contact with Western Romance regions than with Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western North Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.

The Christian religious vocabulary of Albanian is mostly Latin as well, including even the basic terms such &quot;to bless&quot;, &quot;altar,&quot; and &quot;to receive communion&quot;. It indicates that Albanians were Christianized under the Latin-based liturgy and ecclesiastical order which would be known as &quot;Roman Catholic&quot; in later centuries.

====Slavic====
The contacts began after the South Slavic migrations to Southeastern Europe in the 6th and 7th centuries. The modern Albanian lexicon contains around 250 Slavic borrowings that are shared among all the dialects. Slavic settlement probably shaped the present geographic spread of the Albanians. It is likely that Albanians took refuge in the mountainous areas of northern and central Albania, eastern Montenegro, western North Macedonia, and Kosovo. Long-standing contact between Slavs and Albanians might have been common in mountain passages and agriculture or fishing areas, in particular in the valleys of the White and Black branches of the Drin and around the Shkodër and Ohrid lakes. Such contact with one another in these areas has caused many changes in Slavic and Albanian local dialects. Historical linguist Eric P. Hamp, analyzing the influence of substrates on the Old Serbo-Croatian language, has concluded that the toponymic and Romanian evidence indicate that the South Slavs who became Serbo-Croatian speakers settled in a zone of former Albanoid speech, which reasonably explains why the resultant population was well-predisposed to preserve the richest system of lateral consonant distinctions and alternations among the later Slavic-speaking peoples.

The evolution of the ancient toponym &quot;Lychnidus&quot; into &quot;Oh(ë)r(id)&quot; (city and lake), which is attested in this form from 879 CE, required an early long-standing period of Tosk Albanian–East South Slavic bilingualism, or at least contact, resulting from the Tosk Albanian rhotacism &quot;-n-&quot; into &quot;-r-&quot; and Eastern South Slavic l-vocalization &quot;ly-&quot; into &quot;o-&quot;.

As Albanian and Slavic have been in contact since the early Middle Ages, toponymical loanwords in both belong to different chronological strata and reveal different periods of acquisition. Old Slavic loanwords into Albanian develop early Slavic *s as sh and *y as u within Albanian phonology of that era. Norbert Jokl defined this older period from the earliest Albanian-Slavic contacts to 1000 AD at the latest, while contemporary linguists like Vladimir Orel define it as between the 6th and the 8th century AD. Newer loanwords preserve Slavic /s/ and other features which no longer show phonological development within Albanian. Such toponyms from the earlier period of contact in Albania include Bushtricë (Kukës), Dishnica (Përmet), &quot;Dragoshtunjë&quot; (Elbasan), &quot;Leshnjë&quot; (Leshnjë, Berat and other areas), Shelcan (Elbasan), Shishtavec (Kukës/Gora), Shuec (Devoll) and &quot;Shtëpëz&quot; (Gjirokastër), &quot;Shopël&quot; (Iballë), &quot;Veleshnjë&quot; (Skrapar) and others. Similar toponyms in a later period produced different results e.g. &quot;Bistricë&quot; (Sarandë) instead of &quot;Bushtricë&quot; or &quot;Selcan&quot; (Këlcyrë) instead of &quot;Shelcan&quot;. Part of the toponyms of Slavic origin were acquired in Albanian before undergoing the changes of Slavic liquid metathesis (before ca. the end of the 8th century). They include Ardenicë (Lushnjë), Berzanë (Lezhë), Gërdec and Berzi (Tiranë) and a cluster of toponyms along the route Berat-Tepelenë-Përmet. Labëri, from the Albanian endonym, resulted through the Slavic liquid metathesis, and was reborrowed in that form into Albanian.

====Unidentified Romance language hypothesis====
It has been concluded that the partial Latinization of Roman-era Albania was heavy in coastal areas, in the plains, and along the &quot;Via Egnatia&quot;, which passed through Albania. In these regions, Madgearu notes that the survival of Illyrian names and the depiction of people with Illyrian dress on gravestones is not enough to prove successful resistance against Romanization, and that in these regions there were many Latin inscriptions and Roman settlements. Madgearu concludes that only the northern mountain regions escaped Romanization. In some regions, Madgearu concludes that it has been shown that in some areas a Latinate population that survived until at least the seventh century passed on local place names that had mixed characteristics of Eastern and Western Romance into Albanian.

==Archaeology==
The Komani-Kruja culture is an archaeological culture attested from late antiquity to the Middle Ages in central and northern Albania, southern Montenegro and similar sites in the western parts of North Macedonia. It consists of settlements usually built below hillforts along the Lezhë (Praevalitana)-Dardania and Via Egnatia road networks which connected the Adriatic coastline with the central Balkan Roman provinces. Its type site is Komani and the nearby Dalmace hill in the Drin river valley. Limited excavations campaigns occurred until the 1990s. Objects from a vast area covering nearby regions the entire Byzantine Empire, the northern Balkans and Hungary and sea routes from Sicily to Crimea were found in Dalmace and other sites coming from many different production centres: local, Byzantine, Sicilian, Avar-Slavic, Hungarian, Crimean and even possibly Merovingian and Carolingian. Within Albanian archaeology, based on the continuity of pre-Roman Illyrian forms in the production of several types of local objects found in graves, the population of Komani-Kruja was framed as a group which descended from the local Illyrians who &quot;re-asserted their independence&quot; from the Roman Empire after many centuries and formed the core of the later historical region of Arbanon. As research focused almost entirely on grave contexts and burial sites, settlements and living spaces were often ignored. Yugoslav archaeology proposed an opposite narrative and tried to frame the population as Slavic, especially in the region of western Macedonia. Archaeological research has shown that these sites were not related to regions then inhabited by Slavs and even in regions like Macedonia, no Slavic settlements had been founded in the 7th century.

What was established in this early phase of research was that Komani-Kruja settlements represented a local, non-Slavic population which has been described as Romanized Illyrian, Latin-speaking or Latin-literate. This is corroborated by the absence of Slavic toponyms and survival of Latin ones in the Komani-Kruja area. In terms of historiography, the thesis of older Albanian archaeology was an untestable hypothesis as no historical sources exist which can link Komani-Kruja to the first definite attestation of medieval Albanians in the 11th century. Archaeologically, while it was considered possible and even likely that Komani-Kruja sites were used continuously from the 7th century onwards, it remained an untested hypothesis as research was still limited. Whether this population represented local continuity or arrived at an earlier period from a more northern location as the Slavs entered the Balkans remained unclear at the time but regardless of their ultimate geographical origins, these groups maintained Justinianic era cultural traditions of the 6th century possibly as a statement of their collective identity and derived their material cultural references to the Justinianic military system. In this context, they may have used burial customs as a means of reference to an &quot;idealized image of the past Roman power&quot;.

Research greatly expanded after 2009 and the first survey of Komani&#x27;s topography was produced in 2014. Until then, except for the area of the cemetery the size of the settlement and its extension remained unknown. In 2014, it was revealed that Komani occupied an area of more than 40 ha, a much larger territory than originally thought. Its oldest settlement phase dates to the Hellenistic era. Proper development began in the late antiquity and continued well into the Middle Ages (13th-14th centuries). It indicates that Komani was a late Roman fort and an important trading node in the networks of Praevalitana and Dardania. In the Avar-Slavic raids, communities from present-day northern Albania and nearby areas clustered around hill sites for better protection as is the case of other areas like Lezha and Sarda. During the 7th century as Byzantine authority was reestablished after the Avar-Slavic raids and the prosperity of the settlements increased, Komani saw increase in population and a new elite began to take shape. Increase in population and wealth was marked by the establishment of new settlements and new churches in their vicinity. Komani formed a local network with Lezha and Kruja and in turn this network was integrated in the wider Byzantine Mediterranean world, maintained contacts with the northern Balkans and engaged in long-distance trade. Tom Winnifrith (2020) says that the Komani-Kruja culture shows that in that area a Latin-Illyrian civilization survived, to emerge later as Albanians and Vlachs. The lack of interest among Slavs for the barren mountains of Northern Albania would explain the survival of Albanian as a language.

==Paleo-Balkan linguistic theories==


The general consensus is that Albanians originate from one or possibly a mixture of Paleo-Balkan peoples but which specific peoples besides Illyrians is a matter of continuing debate.

Messapic is the only sufficiently attested ancient language via which commonly accepted Illyrian-Albanian connections have been produced. It is unclear whether Messapic was an Illyrian dialect or if it diverged enough to be a separate language, although in general it is treated as a distinct language. Dardanian in the context of a distinct language has gained prominence in the possible genealogy of the Albanian language in recent decades.

Vladimir I. Georgiev, although accepting an Illyrian component in Albanian, and even not excluding an Illyrian origin of Albanian, proposed as the ancestor of Albanian a language called &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; by him, considering it a separate language from Thracian. Georgiev maintained that &quot;Daco-Mysian tribes gradually migrated to the northern-central part of the Balkan Peninsula, approximately to Dardania, probably in the second millennium B.C. (or not later than the first half of the first millennium B.C.), and thence they migrated to the areas of present Albania&quot;. Based on shared innovations between Albanian and Messapic, Eric P. Hamp has argued that Albanian is closely related to Illyrian and not to Thracian or Daco-Moesian, maintaining that it descended from a language that was sibling of Illyrian and that was once closer to the Danube and in contact with Daco-Moesian. Due to the paucity of written evidence, what can be said with certainty in current research is that on the one hand a significant group of shared Indo-European non-Romance cognates between Albanian and Romanian indicates at least contact with the &#x27;Daco-Thraco-Moesian complex&#x27;, and that on the other hand there is some evidence to argue that Albanian is descended from the &#x27;Illyrian complex&#x27;. From a &quot;genealogical standpoint&quot;, Messapic is the closest at least partially attested language to Albanian. Hyllested &amp; Joseph (2022) label this Albanian-Messapic branch as &quot;Illyric&quot; and in agreement with recent bibliography identify Greco-Phrygian as the IE branch closest to the Albanian-Messapic one. These two branches form an areal grouping - which is often called &quot;Balkan IE&quot; - with Armenian.

The Illyrian linguistic theory has some consensus, but Illyrian language is too little attested for definite comparisons to be made. Further issues are linked to the definitions of &quot;Illyrian&quot; and &quot;Thracian&quot; which are vague and aren&#x27;t applied to the same areas which were considered to be part of Illyria and Thrace in antiquity. For instance, Martin Huld argues that the classical &quot;precursors&quot; of the Albanians would be &quot;&#x27;Illyrians&#x27; to classical writers&quot;, but that the Illyrian label is hardly &quot;enlightening&quot; because ethnology in classical antiquity was imprecise. It is also uncertain whether Illyrians spoke a homogeneous language or rather a collection of different but related languages that were wrongly considered the same language by ancient writers. In contemporary research, two main onomastic provinces have been defined in which Illyrian personal names occur; the southern Illyrian or south-eastern Dalmatian province (Albania, Montenegro and their hinterland) and the central Illyrian or middle Dalmatian-Pannonian province (parts of Croatia, Bosnia and western Serbia). The region of the Dardani (modern Kosovo, parts of northern North Macedonia, parts of eastern Serbia) saw the overlap of the southern/south-eastern, Dalmatian and local anthroponymy. A third area around modern Slovenia sometimes considered part of Illyria in antiquity is considered to have been closer to Venetic, which is no longer considered to be related to Illyrian. The conceptual paucity of the label &#x27;Illyrian&#x27; makes its usage uncomfortable to some scholars, for this reason in current research some call the Albanian&#x27;s ancestor &#x27;Albanoid&#x27; in reference to a &quot;specific ethnolinguistically pertinent and historically compact language group&quot;, which still remains relatable with Messapic. The term &#x27;Albanoid&#x27; for the ancestor of the Albanian was used for the first time by Hamp, who developed the thesis about the Proto-Albanoid dialects, spoken in the central-western Balkans including the historical regions of Dardania, Illyria proper, Paeonia, Upper Moesia, western Dacia and western Thrace.

Albanian shows traces of satemization within the Indo-European language tree, however the majority of Albanologists hold that unlike most satem languages it has preserved the distinction of /kʷ/ and /gʷ/ from /k/ and /g/ before front vowels (merged in satem languages), and there is a debate whether Illyrian was centum or satem. On the other hand, Dacian and Thracian seem to belong to satem. A clear isogloss that distinguishes Albanoid languages and Thracian is the palatilization of the IE labiovelars, which in Albanoid was present well before Roman times, while the IE labiovelars clearly did not palatalize in the pre-Roman period in Thracian or in the area where it was spoken.

The debate is often politically charged, and to be conclusive, more evidence is needed. Such evidence unfortunately may not be easily forthcoming because of a lack of sources.

===Illyrian===

The very first recorded mention of a connection between Illyrians and Albanians is in 1709, attributed to the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Leibniz, most famous for being the co-inventor of calculus along with Isaac Newton. In a series of letters, he first speculated Albanian to be related to the other Slavic languages along the Adriatic, but soon changed his mind and connected the Albanian language to that of the ancient Illyrians.

In terms of linguists or historians, the theory that Albanians were related to the Illyrians was proposed for the first time by the Swedish historian Johann Erich Thunmann in 1774. The scholars who advocate an Illyrian origin are numerous. Those who argue in favour of an Illyrian origin maintain that the indigenous Illyrian tribes dwelling in South Illyria (including today&#x27;s Albania) went up into the mountains when Slavs occupied the lowlands, while another version of this hypothesis states that the Albanians are the descendants of Illyrian tribes located between Dalmatia and the Danube who spilled south.

Some of the arguments for the Illyrian-Albanian connection have been as follows:
*From what is known from the old Balkan populations territories (Greeks, Illyrians, Thracians, Dacians), Albanian is spoken in a region where Illyrian was spoken in ancient times.
*There is no evidence of any major migration into Albanian territory since the records of Illyrian occupation. Because descent from Illyrians makes &quot;geographical sense&quot; and there is no linguistic or historical evidence proving a replacement, then the burden of proof lies on the side of those who would deny a connection of Albanian with Illyrian. 
*The Albanian tribal society has preserved the ancient Illyrian social structure based on tribal units. In addition, Çabej analyzed the morphology of some tribal names and pointed out that the Illyrian suffix -at appeared in the names of Illyrian tribes, such as Docleatae, Labeatae, Autariates, Delmatae correspondends to the suffix -at appeared in the 15th century Albanian tribes names like Bakirat and Demat; in Albania today, the suffixes of the names of some villages, such as Dukat and Filat, do match to the Illyrian one.
*Many of what remain as attested words to Illyrian have an Albanian explanation and also a number of Illyrian lexical items (toponyms, hydronyms, oronyms, anthroponyms, etc.) have been linked to Albanian. 
*Words borrowed from Latin (e.g. Latin &quot;aurum &gt; ar&quot; &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;gaudium &gt; gaz&quot; &quot;joy&quot; etc.) date back before the Christian era, while the Illyrians on the territory of modern Albania were the first from the old Balkan populations to be conquered by Romans in 229–167 BC, the Thracians were conquered in 45 AD and the Dacians in 106 AD.
*The characteristics of the Albanian dialects Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages, have led to the conclusion that the dialectal split occurred after Christianisation of the region (4th century AD) and at the time of the Slavic migration to the Balkans or thereafter between the 6th to 7th century AD with the historic boundary between the Gheg and Tosk dialects being the Shkumbin river which straddled the Jireček line.

====Messapic====

Messapic is an Iron Age language spoken in Apulia by the Iapygians (Messapians, Peucetians, Daunians), which settled in Italy as part of an Illyrian migration from the Balkans in the transitional period between the Bronze and Iron Ages. As Messapic was attested after over 500 years of development in the Italian peninsula, it&#x27;s generally treated as distinct linguistically from Illyrian. Both languages are placed in the same branch of Indo-European. Eric Hamp has grouped them under &quot;Messapo-Illyrian&quot; which is further grouped with Albanian under &quot;Adriatic Indo-European&quot;. Other schemes group the three languages under &quot;General Illyrian&quot; and &quot;Western Paleo-Balkan&quot;. Messapian shares several exclusive lexical correspondences and general features with Albanian. Whether Messapian and Albanian share common features because of a common ancestral Illyrian idiom or whether these are features which developed in convergence among the languages of their grouping in the territory of Illyria. Shared cognates and features indicate a closer link between the two languages. The cognates include Messapic &quot;aran&quot; and Albanian &quot;arë&quot; (&quot;field&quot;), &quot;biliā&quot; and &quot;bijë&quot; (&quot;daughter&quot;), &quot;menza-&quot; (in the name Manzanas) and &quot;mëz&quot; (&quot;foal&quot;), &quot;brendion&quot; (in Brundisium) and &quot;bri&quot; (horn) . Some Messapian toponyms like Manduria in Apulia have no etymological forms outside Albanian linguistic sources. Other linguistic elements such as particles, prepositions, suffixes and phonological features of the Messapic language find singular affinities with Albanian.

===Thracian or &quot;Daco-Moesian&quot;===
Aside from an Illyrian origin, Thracian or &quot;Daco-Moesian&quot; origins have also been hypothesized based on linguistic arguments that had been claimed as evidence, although in current historical linguistics the documented Thracian material clearly points to a different language than Albanian or its reconstructed precursor, whereas the &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; hypothetical relation is highly based on speculations that have been thoroughly dismantled by other scholars.

Scholars who support a Dacian origin maintain on their side that Albanians moved southwards between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD from the Moesian area. Others argue instead for a Thracian origin and maintain that the proto-Albanians are to be located in the area between Niš, Skopje, Sofia and Albania or between the Rhodope and Balkan Mountains, from which they moved to present-day Albania before the arrival of the Slavs.

German historian Gottfried Schramm speculated that the Albanians derived from the Christianized Bessi, after their remnants were allegedly pushed by Slavs and Bulgars during the 9th century westwards into today Albania. Archaeologically, there is absolutely no evidence of a 9th-century migration of any population, such as the Bessi, from western Bulgaria to Albania. Also according to historical linguistics the Thracian-Bessian hypothesis of the origin of Albanian should be rejected, since only very little comparative linguistic material is available (the Thracian is attested only marginally, while the Bessian is completely unknown), and at the same time the individual phonetic history of Albanian and Thracian clearly indicates a very different sound development that cannot be considered as the result of one language. Furthermore, the Christian vocabulary of Albanian is mainly Latin, which speaks against the construct of a &quot;Bessian church language&quot;. The elite of the Bessi tribe was gradually Hellenized. Low level of borrowings from Greek in the Albanian language is a further argument against the identification of Albanian with the Bessi. Also the dialectal division of the Albanian-speaking area in the Early Middle Ages contradicts the alleged migration of Albanians in the hinterland of Dyrrhachium in the first decades of the 9th century AD, especially because the dialectal division of a linguistic space is in general a result of a number of linguistic phenomena occurring during a considerable span of time and requires a very large number of natural speakers.

Cities whose names follow Albanian phonetic laws – such as &quot;Shtip&quot; (Štip), &quot;Shkupi&quot; (Skopje) and &quot;Nish&quot; (Niš) – lie in the areas, believed to historically been inhabited by Thracians, Paionians and Dardani; the latter is most often considered an Illyrian tribe by ancient historians. While there still is no clear picture of where the Illyrian-Thracian border was, Niš is mostly considered Illyrian territory.

There are some close correspondences between Thracian and Albanian words. However, as with Illyrian, most Dacian and Thracian words and names have not been closely linked with Albanian (v. Hamp). Also, many Dacian and Thracian placenames were made out of joined names (such as Dacian &quot;Sucidava&quot; or Thracian &quot;Bessapara&quot;; see List of Dacian cities and List of ancient Thracian cities), while modern Albanian does not allow this. Many city names were composed of an initial lexical element affixed to -dava, -daua, -deva, -deba, -daba, or -dova, which meant &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot; Endings on more southern regions are exclusively -bria (&quot;town, city&quot;), -disza, -diza, -dizos (&quot;fortress, walled settlement&quot;), -para, -paron, -pera, -phara (&quot;town, village&quot;). Most Illyrian names are composed of a single unit; many Thracian ones are made of two units joined. Several Thracian place-names end in -para, for example, which is thought to mean &#x27;ford&#x27;, or -diza, which is thought to mean &#x27;fortress&#x27;. Thus in the territory of the Bessi, a well-known Thracian tribe, we have the town of Bessapara, &#x27;ford of the Bessi&#x27;. The structure here is the same as in many European languages: thus the &#x27;town of Peter&#x27; can be called Peterborough, Petrograd, Petersburg, Pierreville, and so on. But the crucial fact is that this structure is impossible in Albanian, which can only say &#x27;Qytet i Pjetrit&#x27;, not &#x27;Pjeterqytet&#x27;. If para were the Albanian for &#x27;ford&#x27;, then the place-name would have to be &#x27;Para e Besseve&#x27;; this might be reduced in time to something like &#x27;Parabessa&#x27;, but it could never become &#x27;Bessapara&#x27;. And what is at stake here is not some superficial feature of the language, which might easily change over time, but a profound structural principle. This is one of the strongest available arguments to show that Albanian cannot have developed out of Thracian or Dacian.

Bulgarian linguist Vladimir I. Georgiev posits that Albanians descend from a Dacian population from Moesia, now the Morava region of eastern Serbia, and that Illyrian toponyms are found in a far smaller area than the traditional area of Illyrian settlement. According to Georgiev, Latin loanwords into Albanian show East Balkan Latin (proto-Romanian) phonetics, rather than West Balkan (Dalmatian) phonetics. Combined with the fact that the Romanian language contains several hundred words similar only to Albanian, Georgiev proposes that Albanian formed in Dardania, in the Roman province of Moesia Superior, where his &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; construct had allegedly been spoken probably since the 2nd millennium BCE or not later than circa 500 BCE. He suggests that Romanian is a fully Romanised Dacian language, whereas Albanian a partly Romanized &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; language. Georgiev&#x27;s theory however has been challenged and dismantled by other scholars. Noel Malcolm suggests Romanian and Aromanian originated in the Southern Balkans from Romanized Illyrians.

Apart from the linguistic theory that Albanian is more akin to East Balkan Romance (i.e. Dacian substrate) than West Balkan Romance (i.e. Illyrian/Dalmatian substrate), Georgiev also notes that marine words in Albanian are borrowed from other languages, suggesting that Albanians were not originally a coastal people. According to Georgiev the scarcity of Greek loan words also supports a &quot;Daco-Mysian&quot; theory – if Albanians originated in the region of Illyria there would surely be a heavy Greek influence. According to historian John Van Antwerp Fine, who does define &quot;Albanians&quot; in his glossary as &quot;an Indo-European people, probably descended from the ancient Illyrians&quot;, nevertheless states that &quot;these are serious (non-chauvinistic) arguments that cannot be summarily dismissed.&quot; Romanian scholars Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of Albanian, have concluded that Albanian was also heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and Dalmatian. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly less than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that Albanian evolved in a region with much greater contact to Western Romance regions than to Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western North Macedonia, spanning east to Bitola and Pristina.

An argument against a Thracian origin (which does not apply to Dacian) is that most Thracian territory was on the Greek half of the Jireček Line, aside from varied Thracian populations stretching from Thrace into Albania, passing through Paionia and Dardania and up into Moesia; it is considered that most Thracians were Hellenized in Thrace (v. Hoddinott) and Macedonia.

The Dacian theory could also be consistent with the known patterns of barbarian incursions. Although there is no documentation of an Albanian migration, &quot;during the fourth to sixth centuries the Rumanian region was heavily affected by large-scale invasion of Goths and Slavs, and the Morava valley (in Serbia) was a possible main invasion route and the site of the earliest known Slavic sites. Thus this would have been a region from which an indigenous population would naturally have fled&quot;.

==Genetic studies==


Various genetic studies have been done on the European population, some of them including current Albanian population, Albanian-speaking populations outside Albania, and the Balkan region as a whole. Albanians share similar genetics with neighbouring ethnic populations with close clusters forming primarily with mainland Greeks and southern Italian populations.

===Y-DNA===
The three haplogroups most strongly associated with Albanian people are E-V13, R1b and J2b-L283.

*E-V13, the most common European sub-clade of E1b1b1a (E-M78) represents about 1/3 of all Albanian men and peaks in Kosovo (~40%). The current distribution of this lineage might be the result of several demographic expansions from the Balkans, such as that associated with the Balkan Bronze Age, and more recently, during the Roman era with the so-called &quot;rise of Illyrian soldiery&quot;. The peak of the haplogroup in Kosovo, however, has been attributed to genetic drift.
*R1b-M269 represents about 1/5 of Albanian men, mostly under clades R-Z2103 and R-PF7562. It is linked with the introduction of the Indo-European languages in the Balkans. The oldest R1b (&gt; R-RPF7562) sample in historically Albanian-inhabited regions has been found in EBA Çinamak, northern Albania, 2663-2472 calBCE (4045±25 BP, PSUAMS-7926). In the same site during the Iron Age, half of the men carried R-M269 (R-CTS1450 x1).
*J2b-L283 represents 14-18% of Albanian men. It peaks in northern Albania. The oldest J-L283 (&gt; J-Z597) sample in Albania found in MBA Shkrel as early as the 19th century BC. It first spread from the northwestern Balkans southwards during the EBA/MBA with cultures likes Cetina (Dalmatia) and Cetina-derived groups which have yielded most J-L283 samples in antiquity. In a 2022 study, J-L283 and its paternal clade J-M241 were found in three out of seven Daunian samples. In IA Çinamak(northern Albania), half of the samples belonged to J-L283.
*Y haplogroup I is represented by I1 more common in northern Europe and I2 where several of its sub-clades are found in significant amounts in the South Slavic population. The specific I sub-clade which has attracted most discussion in Balkan studies currently referred to as I2a1b, defined by SNP M423 This clade has higher frequencies to the north of the Albanophone area, in Dalmatia and Bosnia. The expansion of I2a-Din took place during Late Antiquity and Early Middle Ages and today is common in Slavic speaking peoples.
* Haplogroup R1a is common in Central and Eastern Europe, especially in Slavic nations, (and is also common in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent). In the Balkans, it is strongly associated with Slavic areas.

A study by Battaglia et al. in 2008 found the following haplogroup distributions among Albanians in Albania itself: 
The same study by Battaglia et al. (2008) also found the following distributions among Albanians in North Macedonia:

The same study by Battaglia et al. (2008) also found the following distributions among Albanians in Albania itself and Albanians in North Macedonia:

A study by Peričić et al. in 2005 found the following Y-Dna haplogroup frequencies in Albanians from Kosovo with E-V13 subclade of haplogroup E1b1b representing 43.85% of the total (note that Albanians from other regions have slightly lower percentages of E-V13, but similar J2b and R1b):
The same study by Peričić et al. in 2005 found the following Y-Dna haplogroup frequencies in Albanians from Kosovo with E-V13 subclade of haplogroup E1b1b representing 43.85% of the total (note that Albanians from other regions have slightly lower percentages of E-V13, but similar J2b and R1b):


Table notes:
A study on the Y chromosome haplotypes DYS19 STR and YAP and on mitochondrial DNA found no significant difference between Albanians and most other Europeans.

Larger samples collected by volunteer-led projects, show the Albanians belong largely to Y-chromosomes J2b2-L283, R1b-Z2103/BY611 and EV-13 from Ancient Balkan populations.

In a 2013 study which compared one Albanian sample to other European samples, the authors concluded that it did not differ significantly to other European populations, especially groups such as Greeks, Italians and Macedonians.

===mtDNA===
Another study of old Balkan populations and their genetic affinities with current European populations was done in 2004, based on mitochondrial DNA on the skeletal remains of some old Thracian populations from SE of Romania, dating from the Bronze and Iron Age. This study was during excavations of some human fossil bones of 20 individuals dating about 3200–4100 years, from the Bronze Age, belonging to some cultures such as Tei, Monteoru and Noua were found in graves from some necropoles SE of Romania, namely in Zimnicea, Smeeni, Candesti, Cioinagi-Balintesti, Gradistea-Coslogeni and Sultana-Malu Rosu; and the human fossil bones and teeth of 27 individuals from the early Iron Age, dating from the 10th to 7th centuries BC from the Hallstatt Era (the Babadag culture), were found extremely SE of Romania near the Black Sea coast, in some settlements from Dobruja, namely: Jurilovca, Satu Nou, Babadag, Niculitel and Enisala-Palanca. After comparing this material with the present-day European population, the authors concluded:

Computing the frequency of common point mutations of the present-day European population with the Thracian population has resulted that the Italian (7.9%), the Albanian (6.3%) and the Greek (5.8%) have shown a bias of closer [mtDna] genetic kinship with the Thracian individuals than the Romanian and Bulgarian individuals (only 4.2%).

===Autosomal DNA===

Analysis of autosomal DNA, which analyses &quot;all&quot; genetic components has revealed that few rigid genetic discontinuities exist in European populations, apart from certain outliers such as Saami, Sardinians, Basques, Finns and Kosovar Albanians. They found that Albanians, on the one hand, have a high amount of identity by descent sharing, suggesting that Albanian-speakers derived from a relatively small population that expanded recently and rapidly in the last 1,500 years. On the other hand, they are not wholly isolated or endogamous because Greek and Macedonian samples shared much higher numbers of common ancestors with Albanian speakers than with other neighbors, possibly a result of historical migrations, or else perhaps smaller effects of the Slavic expansion in these populations. At the same time the sampled Italians shared nearly as much IBD with Albanian speakers as with each other.

In Lazaridis et al. (2022) a transect of samples from Albania which date from the EBA to the present day were tested. The population of Albania &quot;appears to be largely made up of the same components in similar proportions&quot; since the MBA. The core part of this profile consists of 50% Anatolian Neolithic Farmers, 20-25% Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers, 10-15% Eastern Hunter-Gatherers. According to this study, the speakers of Albanian, as well as Greek and other Paleo-Balkan languages, go back directly to the migration of Yamnaya steppe pastoralists into the Balkans about 5,000 to 4,500 years ago, whose admixture with the local populations generated a tapestry of various ancestry, which in Albanians resulted in the above-mentioned components.

Another study, from 2023, concludes that &quot;a significant proportion&quot; of the Modern Albanians paternal ancestry comes from West Balkans &quot;including those traditionally known as &quot;Illyrians&quot;&quot;

==Obsolete hypotheses==
===Italian hypothesis===
Laonikos Chalkokondyles (c. 1423–1490), the Byzantine historian, considered the Albanians to be an extension of the Italians. The theory has its origin in the first mention of the Albanians, disputed whether it refers to Albanians in an ethnic sense, made by Attaliates (11th century): &quot;...For when subsequent commanders made base and shameful plans and decisions, not only was the island lost to Byzantium, but also the greater part of the army. Unfortunately, the people who had once been our allies and who possessed the same rights as citizens and the same religion, i.e. the Albanians and the Latins, who live in the Italian regions of our Empire beyond Western Rome, quite suddenly became enemies when Michael Dokeianos insanely directed his command against their leaders...&quot;

===Caucasian hypothesis===
One of the earliest theories on the origins of the Albanians, now considered obsolete, incorrectly identified the proto-Albanians with an area of the eastern Caucasus, separately referred to by classical geographers as Caucasian Albania, located in what roughly corresponds to modern-day southern Dagestan, northern Azerbaijan and bordering Caucasian Iberia to its west. This theory conflated the two Albanias supposing that the ancestors of the Balkan Albanians (&quot;Shqiptarët&quot;) had migrated westward in the late classical or early medieval period. The Caucasian theory was first proposed by Pope Pius II in his writings. and later by Renaissance humanists who were familiar with the works of classical geographers, and further developed by early 19th-century French consul and writer François Pouqueville. It was soon rendered obsolete in the 19th century when linguists proved Albanian as being an Indo-European, rather than a Caucasian language.

=== Pelasgian hypothesis===
In terms of historical theories, an outdated theory is the 19th century theory that Albanians specifically descend from the Pelasgians, a broad term used by classical authors to denote the autochthonous, pre-Indo-European inhabitants of Greece and the southern Balkans in general. However, there is no evidence about the possible language, customs and existence of the Pelasgians as a distinct and homogeneous people and thus any particular connection to this population is unfounded. This theory was developed by the Austrian linguist Johann Georg von Hahn in his work &quot;Albanesische Studien&quot; in 1854. According to Hahn, the Pelasgians were the original proto-Albanians and the language spoken by the Pelasgians, Illyrians, Epirotes and ancient Macedonians were closely related. In Hahn&#x27;s theory the term &quot;Pelasgians&quot; was mostly used as a synonym for &quot;Illyrians&quot;. This theory quickly attracted support in Albanian circles, as it established a claim of predecence over other Balkan nations, particularly the Greeks. In addition to establishing &quot;historic right&quot; to territory this theory also established that the ancient Greek civilization and its achievements had an &quot;Albanian&quot; origin. The theory gained staunch support among early 20th-century Albanian publicists. This theory is rejected by scholars today. In contemporary times with the Arvanite revival of the Pelasgian theory, it has also been recently borrowed by other Albanian speaking populations within and from Albania in Greece to counter the negative image of their communities.

===&quot;Free Dacian&quot; hypothesis===
In the late 19th and early 20th century Romanian linguist Hasdeu speculated the origin of Albanians from the free Dacians (i.e., according to him, the Costoboci, the Carpi and the Bessi), after their alleged migration southwards from outside the Danubian or Carpathian limes during Roman Imperial times. His outdated methods are linguistically unsustainable and his reconstructed narrative is based on no factual evidence. This unfounded narrative was revived in the late 20th century by Romanian historian I. I. Russu persistently and beyond the scientific knowledge that was achieved in the meantime. Despite having a history background, he made claims in the field of philology and comparative linguistics, eager to prove the autochthony of the Romanian people in their present-day heartlands (mainly north of the Danube and in Transylvania). According to him, the pre-Roman lexical element shared with Romanian (&quot;Traco-Dacian&quot;), the massive Roman lexical element in Albanian, and the little Ancient Greek element, indicate an origin from the Thracian Carpi beyond the northeastern borders of the Empire, in the Carpatho-Danubian areas where Romanization could have been averted. Although Russu himself reported Pedersen&#x27;s argument according to which precisely the large Latin influence and the small Ancient Greek influence speak in favor of the Illyrian origin of Albanian, the question arises why Russu ignored the fact that the large Latin influence actually indicates the location of Albanian within the Roman world and not outside it. Russu&#x27;s linguistic analysis obviously has errors, and above all his mode of argumentation goes even beyond Hasdeu&#x27;s romantic narrative.

<text>Stuff is a British consumer electronics magazine published by Kelsey Media.

== History ==
&quot;Stuff&quot; was first published in Britain in November 1996 by Dennis Publishing. A bimonthly title, it followed the success of magazines such as &quot;FHM&quot; and &quot;Loaded&quot; in being pitched toward a young, male audience, with a focus on consumer goods and electronics.

The brand took a more lifestyle-orientated direction in 1998, before publishing group Haymarket bought the title in January 1999 and refocused the magazine to consumer electronics.

In May 2018, the brand was sold to Kelsey Media, after the attempt to sell the brand to Future plc (which already owned competing title &quot;T3&quot;) fell through due to regulatory concerns. 

Haymarket Media Group CEO Kevin Costello said at the time of the sale: &quot;&quot;Stuff&quot; is a truly iconic brand, trusted by its tech-loving followers to entertain, educate, and inspire. It&#x27;s been a big part of the Haymarket story, but our strategic focus has shifted, and &quot;Stuff&quot; needs a new home, where the brand can really achieve its potential.&quot;

== British edition ==
The British version of the magazine is focused on gadgets, games, and gear, including innovative and exciting consumer electronics. &quot;Hot Stuff&quot; is the news section concerned with new or forthcoming products. Top 10s of currently available items are featured toward the back of the magazine.

== American edition ==
The American edition of &quot;Stuff&quot; was launched in 1999 by Dennis&#x27;s US arm. Spun off from a regular section in another of the group&#x27;s titles, &quot;Maxim&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;&#x27;s American edition featured reviews of consumer electronics alongside other articles of interest to a predominantly male audience. In June 2007, all but one of Dennis&#x27;s US titles were sold to private equity firm Quadrangle Group, which closed the magazine later the same year.

== Malaysian edition ==
Founded in 2004, &quot;Stuff&quot; Malaysia is one of the country&#x27;s leading and best-selling consumer electronics, technology, and lifestyle magazines. It is published by Catcha Lifestyle Publications Sdn. Bhd.

== Singapore edition ==
&quot;Stuff&quot; magazine has been locally published in Singapore since 2004. The magazine gained recognition and established itself as a leading name in the consumer electronics and tech lifestyle segment in Singapore. Its website launched in December 2013. The magazine was also relaunched and published by content owner Haymarket Media Group.&quot; Stuff &quot;Singapore closed in January 2018.

== Indian edition ==
&quot;Stuff&quot; India, the Indian edition of &quot;Stuff&quot;, launched on 1 December 2008 with a cover price of Rs. 100 ($2). The magazine launched with a print run of 40,000 copies. &quot;Stuff&quot; India is edited by Nishant Padhiar, formerly the editor of &quot;T3&quot; and consultant editor on &quot;AV MAX&quot;.

== South African edition ==
&quot;Stuff&quot; South Africa was published under license by Times Media between 2007 and December 2012. In November 2012, the publishers announced that the licence had not been renewed, but that a new publishing venture would continue the title. Circulation has been recorded at 25,811.

== Mexican edition ==
&quot;Stuff México&quot; was published under license by Grupo Medios starting June 2012. The magazine launched with a print run of 50,000 copies. &quot;Stuff México&quot; is no longer edited since 2015.

== Middle Eastern edition ==

<text>Kurt Albert Gerlach (22 August 1886, Hanover – 19 October 1922, Frankfurt) was a German professor and sociologist.

== Life ==

Gerlach was the son of the chemist and later director of the Continental AG Albert Gerlach and his wife Martha Friedmann. He had studied at the university of Kiel under Ferdinand Tönnies and received his doctorate in 1911 with a work on the role of Denmark in global economy. He then studied at the University of Leipzig. In 1911 and 1912 he went to England and studied at the London School of Economics (LSE) and became a member of the Fabian Society. In 1913 he habilitated in Leipzig with a treaty on protective measures for female factory workers in England. The lecture was on syndicalism.

He joined the institute for world economy and sea-trade in Kiel, directed by Bernhard Harms. From 1919 on, Gerlach taught economy at the Aachen Polytechnic. In 1922, Gerlach was accepted as the future director of the Frankfurt Institute for Social Research (Institut für Sozialforschung) in Frankfurt by the Prussian ministry of education and he taught economy and sociology at Frankfurt University. He had already designed the agenda of the institute, but because of his untimely death from diabetes in 1922, Carl Grünberg became the founding director in his stead, followed by Max Horkheimer in 1930.

Gerlach had been close to adherents of a moderate socialism from above, coupled with social reforms (Kathedersozialisten), but became a member of the SPD in November 1914 and changed to the more radical USPD in the autumn of 1919. Later on, he sympathised with Anarcho-Syndicalism and became a Marxist.

He divorced his wife Christine Gerlach so that she could marry in May 1921 her dashing lover and former pupil of Kurt Albert Gerlach, Richard Sorge. Her marriage to Sorge only lasted a few years.

<text>Rheita is a lunar impact crater located in the southwestern sector of the Moon. It was named after Czech astronomer and optician Anton Maria Schyrleus of Rheita. It lies to the northeast of the crater Metius, and northwest of Young. The southwestern rim overlies the edge of Vallis Rheita, a long lunar valley stretching for over 200 kilometers on a line running northeast to southwest. At its widest the valley is 25 kilometers wide and a kilometer deep.

The rim of Rheita remains well-defined with a sharp lip and a d inner wall. The rim overlaps a slightly smaller crater to the east, and has a pair of small impact craters in the northern wall. The crater floor is flat and it has a central peak.

Rheita is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rheita. It has overlapping craters.

The Registan was a public square, where people gathered to hear royal proclamations, heralded by blasts on enormous copper pipes called &quot;dzharchis&quot; — and a place of public executions. It is framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Persian architecture. The square was regarded as the hub of the Timurid Renaissance.

==Madrasahs==
The three madrasahs of the Registan are the Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417–1420), the Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619–1636), and the Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646–1660). &quot;Madrasah&quot; is an Arabic term meaning school.
===Ulugh Beg Madrasah (1417–1420)===
The Ulugh Beg Madrasah, built by Ulugh Beg during the Timurid Empire era of Timur, has an imposing iwan with a lancet-arch pishtaq or portal facing the square. The corners are flanked by high minarets. The mosaic panel over the iwan&#x27;s entrance arch is decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The square courtyard includes a mosque and lecture rooms, and is fringed by the dormitory cells in which students lived. There are deep galleries along the axes. Originally the Ulugh Beg Madrasah was a two-storied building with four domed &quot;darskhona&quot;s (lecture rooms) at the corners.

The Ulugh Beg Madrasah () was one of the best clergy universities of the Muslim Orient in the 15th century CE. Abdul-Rahman Jami, the great Persian poet, scholar, mystic, scientist and philosopher studied at the madrasah. Ulugh Beg himself gave lectures there. During Ulugh Beg&#x27;s government the madrasah was a centre of learning.

===Sher-Dor Madrasah (1619–1636)===
In the 17th century Uzbek ruler of Samarkand, Yalangtoʻsh Bakhodir, ordered the construction of the Sher-Dor () and Tillya-Kori () madrasahs. The tiger mosaics with a rising sun on their back are especially interesting for their depiction of living beings and use of Turko-Persian motifs.

===Tilya-Kori Madrasah (1646–1660)===
Ten years later the Tilya-Kori (, meaning &quot;Gilded&quot;) Madrasah was built. It was not only a residential college for students, but also played the role of grand &quot;masjid&quot; (mosque). It has a two-storied main facade and a vast courtyard fringed by dormitory cells, with four galleries along the axes. The mosque building (see picture) is situated in the western section of the courtyard. The main hall of the mosque is abundantly gilded.

==Other buildings==

===Mausoleum of Shaybanids===
To the east of the Tilya-Kori Madrasah, the mausoleum of Shaybanids (16th century) is located (see picture). The real founder of Shaybanid power was Muhammad Shaybani—grandson of Abu&#x27;l-Khayr Khan. In 1500, with the backing of the Chaghataite Khanate, then based in Tashkent, Muhammad Shaybani conquered Samarkand and Bukhara from their last Timurid rulers. The founder of the dynasty then turned on his benefactors and in 1503 took old Tashkent. He captured Khiva in 1506 and in 1507 he swooped down on Merv (Turkmenistan), eastern Persia, and western Afghanistan. The Shaybanids stopped the advance of the Safavids, who in 1502 had defeated the Akkoyunlu (Azerbaijan). Muhammad Shaybani was a leader of nomadic Uzbek tribes. During the ensuing years they substantially settled down in oases of the Central Asia, Caspian shore, Tian Shan valleys, Russian steeps and Indostan . The one of the last and vast Uzbek invasion of the 15th century CE was the large component of today&#x27;s Uzbek nation ethnogeny.

===Chorsu trading dome===
The trading dome Chorsu (1785) is situated right behind the Sher-Dor. Chorsu located at southeast of the Registan at the intersection of the cross-roads connecting Samarkand, Tashkent, Bukhara, and Shahrisabz. &quot;Chorsu&quot; is a word of Persian origin meaning &quot;crossing roads,&quot; referring to this famous intersection of busy roadways. The building is old. It has a rather rich centuries-old history.  At the moment, it is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List along with the rest of the historical part of the glorious city. 

Chorsu was originally a bazaar constructed in the 15th century but was rebuilt in the 18th century, becoming a hat market. The current building was built during the reign of Amir Shahmurad, in 1785. Today, the bazaar which was previously located at Chorsu is nowadays the Siyob Bazaar near the Bibi-Khanym Mosque.

In 2005, ownership of Chorsu was transferred to the Academy of Arts of Uzbekistan. While renovating the building, three meters of dirt were removed from the building revealing the original base construction. Chorsu now serves as an art gallery which offers the work of artists both contemporary and historical. The art of in the Chorsu gallery displays the arts, culture, history, and diversity of the multi-national Uzbek people.

<doc id="929346" wikidata="Q433245" url="?curid=929346" title="Alt porn">
<text>Alternative porn (also known as alt porn, alternaporn, or simply alt in context), a shortening of &quot;alternative pornography,&quot; is a subgenre of pornography that is centered around alternative subcultures, such as goths, hipsters, emos, scenes, skaters or ravers, and is often produced by small and independent websites or filmmakers. It often features models with body modifications such as tattoos, piercings, or scarifications, or temporary modifications such as dyed hair or extreme makeup. The term indie porn is occasionally used, though this term is more generally used as a synonym for independent pornography, regardless of affinity with any kind of alternative subculture.

== History ==
The work of Gregory Dark, David Aaron Clark, Michael Ninn, and Stephen Sayadian are seen as the early creators of the alt porn genre. The Cinema of Transgression of Richard Kern and Nick Zedd (as well as Kern&#x27;s later photographic work) can also be viewed as early examples of alt porn.
The first venue explicitly devoted to &quot;subcultural erotica&quot; was Blue Blood, a glossy magazine that began in 1992 and featured models with a goth or cyberpunk look. The biggest market for alt porn however has been on the Internet. Other than a few ephemeral personal websites, the earliest explicitly alt porn site was Blue Blood&#x27;s GothicSluts.com, established in early 1999. This was followed shortly after by Raverporn.net, which was later renamed EroticBPM.com, in July of the same year, and later followed by NakkidNerds in December, Supercult had appeared in 2000. By late 2001, SuicideGirls had grown to become the most popular and financially lucrative alt porn site and has been since. With the success of SuicideGirls, the number of alt porn sites has grown in number since 2002. In addition to the above-mentioned sites, well-known altporn websites in operation as of September 2008 include Lazerbunny, Burning Angel, and GodsGirls.

The terms &quot;alternative porn&quot; or &quot;alt porn&quot; were coined in the early 2000s in reference to SuicideGirls, RaverPorn, and similar sites. Longer-standing projects, such as Blue Blood, generally used terms such as &quot;subcultural erotica&quot;.

Alt porn websites are often distinguished by their use of message boards, blogs, social networking, and other features of online community, encouraging participation by both models and viewers. While these features are not exclusive to alt porn sites, their inclusion stands in stark contrast to the standard operating procedures adopted by more typical porn sites which tend to feature more or less anonymous models who are viewed by anonymous visitors.

Alt porn-themed videos are also becoming a growing niche in the adult video market. The work of directors Stephen Sayadian and Gregory Dark during the 1980s and early 1990s had many of the features of later alt porn, and are often cited as being key contributing influences on current alt porn video. In 2001, two amateur videos under the title &quot;Technosex&quot; were produced, featuring women involved in the rave scene along with a techno music soundtrack. Since 2004, director Eon McKai has been producing alt porn-themed videos for VCA Pictures (an otherwise mainstream adult video studio) and, in 2006, was signed by Vivid Entertainment to produce alt porn-themed videos under the Vivid-ALT imprint. In 2006, McKai remade Gregory Dark&#x27;s seminal punk porno film &quot;New Wave Hookers&quot;, using some of the original script with a different twist and calling the film &quot;Neu Wave Hookers.&quot; Vivid-ALT had also signed noted fetish photographers Dave Naz and Octavio &quot;Winkytiki&quot; Arizala.

== Controversies ==

Many members of the alt porn community disagree on the definition of alt porn. Some consider it mostly an aesthetic quality while others see it as having a more ideological definition. This includes controversies over whether alt porn sites and videos should restrict themselves to softcore pin-up photography or include more sexually explicit hardcore content, whether alt porn need be explicitly feminist or not, and whether alt porn venues should present models of all genders and a range of body types rather than just conventionally attractive young women. Since every pornography company conducts its business and treats their models differently, it is hard to define it on an ideological basis, although the models&#x27; freedom to speak their mind both about the industry, their employers, and political agendas is considered by some to be a vital part of the alt porn community. SuicideGirls have been criticized for restricting their employees&#x27; ability to make public comments of this nature. This led to a public falling out between the owners of SuicideGirls and a number of their former models, and larger debates as to whether alternative porn was inherently any more empowering than mainstream porn.

<text>Rosse is a bowl-shaped lunar impact crater located in the southern part of Mare Nectaris. It was named after Irish astronomer Lord Rosse. To the southwest is the large, flooded crater Fracastorius.

The interior of the crater has a higher albedo than the surrounding lunar mare, making it readily visible. While it lacks a ray system of its own, rays from distant Tycho cross it. Low ridges in the mare lie between this crater and Fracastorius to the southwest.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Rosse.

<text>Inge Sørensen (18 July 1924 – 9 March 2011), later Inge Tabur, sometimes known as &quot;Lille henrivende Inge&quot; (&quot;Little endearing Inge&quot;) was a Danish swimmer who at age 12 won a bronze medal in the 200 meter breaststroke at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. This makes her the youngest Olympic medal winner in an individual competition.

During 1936-1944 she won nine Danish championships, two Nordic championships and one European championship. She set 14 Danish records in breaststroke. She also broke the world record in the 400m and 500m breaststroke and became the first Danish female swimmer to finish in under 3 minutes in the 200m breaststroke.

Her swimming career was cut short by World War II. After the war she married a Danish engineer and moved abroad, eventually residing in the US.

==Early life==

Inge Sørensen was born in Skovshoved, Denmark, the daughter of a fishmonger, in 1924. She began swimming at age 3 in the harbor of Skovshoved north of Copenhagen and won her first Danish championship aged 11 in 1936 in the 200m breaststroke. Because of this, she was selected for the Olympic Games in Berlin the same year.

==Olympic Games in Berlin, 1936==
At the Olympic Games, aged 12, she won a bronze medal in the 200m breaststroke. She is the youngest medal winner at the Olympic Games in an individual competition. Her final on 11 August was the first event to be broadcast live on air by Danish radio, which itself was a sensation. During the games she got the nickname &quot;Lille henrivende Inge&quot; (&quot;Little Lovely Inge&quot;).

On her return from Berlin she and the other Danish female medal winner, Ragnhild Hveger, received an enthusiastic welcome in Copenhagen.

==European Championships in London, 1938==
Between 1936 and 1938 Sørensen improved her times in swimming, despite concerns that puberty would slow her down. At the European championships in swimming in London in 1938, she won a gold medal in the 200m breaststroke.

==World War II==
The period 1939-1941 was the height of her career. In 1939 she broke the world record in the 400m and 500m breaststroke, and in 1941 she became the first Danish female swimmer to finish in under 3 minutes in the 200m breaststroke.

Nevertheless, World War II meant that the Summer Olympics in 1940 and 1944 were cancelled with the European Championships in 1942. This led to her ending her swimming career in 1944.

Unlike other Danish swimmers, such as Ragnhild Hveger, she did not go to Germany for international competition during the war.

== Later life==
Sørensen received an education in instructing and coaching in 1946, and then taught gymnastics and swimming. After being married in 1948 to Danish engineer Janus Tabur, she followed him to South Africa, and later Canada and then from 1951 the United States. She lived in New Jersey until her death in 2011.

<text>Gina G (born Gina Mary Garrison, 3 August 1970) is an Australian former singer who represented the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest in 1996, with the song &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;, which reached No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart. The song also reached the US top 20 in 1997 and earned her a 1998 Grammy Award nomination for Best Dance Recording. Her other UK Top 30 hits are &quot;I Belong to You&quot; #6 (1996), &quot;Fresh&quot; #6 (1997), &quot;Ti Amo&quot; #11 (1997) and &quot;Gimme Some Love&quot; #25 (1997).

==Career==
===Early 1990s===
During the early 1990s, Gina G was a DJ in Melbourne and a singer in the Australian dance music group Bass Culture. She appeared under the name Geena for a track she co-wrote with the group, &quot;Love the Life&quot;, which was released in Australia in May 1992.

===Mid- to late 1990s===
By 1995, she had moved to the UK, where she entered the &quot;A Song for Europe&quot; competition. She won, becoming the UK&#x27;s entry in the 1996 Eurovision Song Contest, with the song &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;. The song finished in eighth place at Eurovision, and peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart. The song was also successful in the US, reaching #12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #3 on the Hot Dance Club Play, #13 on the Rhythmic Top 40, #5 on the Mainstream Top 40, #25 on the Adult Top 40 and #11 on the Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales chart. The song was nominated for a Grammy in the Best Dance Recording category in 1998.

Gina G released &quot;I Belong to You&quot; later in 1996, which was also a top 10 hit in the UK. The following year, she scored a succession of UK hits with &quot;Fresh!&quot;, &quot;Ti Amo&quot;, &quot;Gimme Some Love&quot;, and &quot;Everytime I Fall&quot;, all of which were included on her debut album &quot;Fresh!. &quot;The album&#x27;s cover was shot by David LaChapelle and featured her whole body covered in chocolate. &quot;Gimme Some Love&quot; was also a hit in the US, reaching #46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, #18 on both the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales charts, and #22 on the Top 40 Mainstream chart.

Following this, she disappeared from the music industry for several years. A long lawsuit against a former manager was reported as taking all her energy, and despite the fact that a lot of new music was recorded for a second album, she was prevented from releasing the material.

===2000s===
By 2000, she recorded a number of songs with Swedish producers Lagoona, including a new version of her debut hit &quot;Ooh Aah... Just a Little Bit&quot;, and a cover of Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;These Boots Are Made for Walkin&#x27;&quot;. The latter was released as a CD single through a small independent label, but the release did not attract any major attention.

After this quiet period, G returned to the spotlight in March 2003, when she took part in the reality television show &quot;Reborn in the USA&quot;, alongside Sonia, Michelle Gayle, Tony Hadley, Peter Cox and Elkie Brooks. Even though she received the most votes from the American audience and won the first show, she got the fewest votes in the next show, and went up for the British public&#x27;s vote. She lost, and was eliminated from the show in the third programme.

In early 2005, Gina G attempted to represent the United Kingdom at the Eurovision Song Contest, she finished last out of five entries on the pre-selection program with her song &quot;Flashback&quot;. She competed against Javine and Katie Price.

In August, she released her second album, &quot;Get Up &amp; Dance&quot; to good reviews. However the album was only available through her website, with the majority of first orders being personally signed by G.

In June 2006, her debut album, &quot;Fresh!&quot;, became available for download on iTunes. She set up her own record label, Stuntgirl, with distribution through Universal Records. Based in Los Angeles, she records in her own studio there as well as in London. In late 2006 she released a new single, &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; and promoted it round the clubs and it went into the commercial dance chart at #2. It was released on 2 October through download and larger music stores. The single charted at #57 in the UK Singles Chart on 8 October.

In March 2009, her second album &quot;Get Up &amp; Dance&quot;, previously only available through her website, was released on iTunes. The album had a new cover design.

===2010s===
Gina G released &quot;Next 2 You&quot; on 27 May 2011 to iTunes Australia. It was written by Gina G, Billy Pace, Duane Morrison, and John Collins. New remixes featuring rapper Vigilante were released in November 2011. A planned second single called &#x27;Set the Night on Fire&#x27; was scheduled for early 2012 and a music video was planned, but ultimately both song and video were never released, and , Gina G has not returned to musical activity. In May 2024, &quot;Fresh!&quot; was re-released on purple vinyl and double CD/DVD versions by 90/9 Records.

<text>Disordered eating describes a variety of abnormal eating behaviors that, by themselves, do not warrant diagnosis of an eating disorder.

Disordered eating includes behaviors that are common features of eating disorders, such as:

* Chronic restrained eating.
* Compulsive eating.
* Binge eating, with associated loss of control.
* Self-induced vomiting.

Disordered eating also includes behaviors that are not characteristic of a specific eating disorder, such as:

* Irregular, chaotic eating patterns.
* Ignoring physical feelings of hunger and satiety (fullness).
* Use of diet pills.
* Emotional eating.
* Night eating.
* Secretive food concocting: the consumption of embarrassing food combinations, such as mashed potatoes mixed with sandwich cookies. See also Food craving § Pregnancy and Nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder § Symptoms and behaviors.

== Potential causes of disordered eating ==
Disordered eating can represent a change in eating patterns caused by other mental disorders (e.g. clinical depression), or by factors that are generally considered to be unrelated to mental disorders (e.g. extreme homesickness).

Certain factors among adolescents tend to be associated with disordered eating, including perceived pressure from parents and peers, nuclear family dynamic, body mass index, negative affect (mood), self-esteem, perfectionism, drug use, and participation in sports that focus on leanness. These factors are similar among boys and girls alike. However, the reported incidence rates of disordered eating are consistently and significantly higher in female than male participants. 61% of females and 28% of males reported disordered eating behaviors in a study of over 1600 adolescents.

=== Nuclear family environment ===
The nuclear family dynamic of an adolescent plays a large part in the formation of their psychological, and thus behavioral, development. A research article published in the &quot;Journal of Adolescence&quot; concluded that, “…while families do not appear to play a primary casual role in eating pathology, dysfunctional family environments and unhealthy parenting can affect the genesis and maintenance of disordered eating.”

One study explored the connection between the disordered eating patterns of adolescents and the poor socioemotional coping mechanisms of guardians with mental disorders. It was found that in homes of parents with mental health issues (such as depression or anxiety), the children living in these environments self-reported experiencing stressful home environments, parental withdrawal, rejection, unfulfilled emotional needs, or over-involvement from their guardians. It was hypothesized that this was directly related to adolescent study participants also reporting poor emotional awareness, expression, and regulation in relation to internalized/externalized eating disordered habits. Parental anxiety/depression could not be directly linked to disordered eating, but could be linked to the development of poor coping skills that can lead to disordered eating behaviors.

Another study specifically investigated whether a parental&#x27;s eating disorder could predict disordered eating in their children. It was found that rates of eating disorder appearances in children with either parent having a history of an eating disorder were much higher than those with parents without an eating disorder. Reported disordered eating peaked between ages 15 and 17 with the risk of eating disorder occurrences in females 12.7 times greater than of that in males. This is, &quot;of particular interest as it has been shown that maternal ED [eating disorders] predict disordered eating behaviour in their daughters.&quot; This suggests that poor eating habits result as a coping mechanism for other direct issues presented by an unstable home environment.

=== Social stresses ===
Additional stress from outside the home environment influence disordered eating characteristics. Social stresses from peer environments, such as feeling out of place or discriminated against, has been shown to increase feelings of body shame and social anxiety in studies of minority groups that lead to a prevalence of disordered eating.

A study published in the &quot;International Journal of Eating Disorders&quot; used data from the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Surveys from 1999 to 2013 to examine how disordered eating has trended in heterosexual versus LGB (lesbian, gay, bisexual) youth. The data from over 26,000 surveys investigated the practices of purging, fasting, and using diet pills. It was found that, &quot;sexual minority youth report disproportionately higher prevalence of disordered eating compared to heterosexual peers: up to 1 in 4 sexual minority youth report…patterns of disordered eating…&quot; In addition, the gap between the number of LGBT females and heterosexual females controlling weight in unhealthy ways has continued to widen.

The concept this study proposed to explain this disparity comes from the minority stress theory. This states that unhealthy behaviors are directly related to the distal stress, or social stress, that minorities experience. These stressors could include rejection or pressure by peers, and physical, mental, and emotional harassment.

A study published in &quot;Psychology of Women Quarterly&quot; explored the connection between social anxiety stresses and eating disordered habits more in depth in women in the LGBTQ community who were also racial minorities. Over 450 women ranked their interactions with everyday discrimination, their LGBTQ identity, social anxiety, their objectified body consciousness, and an eating disorder inventory diagnostic scale. The findings of the compilation of survey responses indicated that increased discrimination led to proximal minority stress, leading to feelings of social anxiety and body shame, which could be directly associated with binge eating, bulimia, and other signs of disordered eating. It has also been suggested that being a “double” or “triple” minority who experiences discrimination towards multiple characteristics contributes to more intense psychological distress and maladaptive coping mechanisms.

=== Athletic influences ===
Disordered eating among athletes, particularly female athletes, has been the subject of much research. In one study, women with disordered eating were 3.6 times as likely to have an eating disorder if they were athletes. In addition, female collegiate athletes who compete in heavily body conscious sports like gymnastics, swimming, or diving are shown to be more at risk for developing an eating disorder. This is a result of the engagement in sports where weekly repeated weigh-ins are standard, and usually required by coaches.

A study published in &quot;Eating Behaviors&quot; examined the pressure of mandated weigh-ins on female collegiate athletes and how that pressure was dealt with in terms of weight management. After analyzing over 400 survey responses, it was found that athletes reported increased uses of diet pills/laxatives, consuming less calories than needed for their sport, and following nutrition information from unqualified sources. 75% of the weighed athletes reported using a weight-management method such as restricting food intake, increasing exercise, eating low fat foods, taking laxatives, vomiting, and other.

These habits were found to be worse in athletes that were weighed in front of their peers than those weighed in private. In addition, especially in gymnasts, preoccupation and anxiety about gaining weight and being weighed, and viewing food as the enemy were prevalent mindsets. This harmful mindset continued even after the gymnasts were retired from their sport: &quot;Although retired, these gymnasts were still afraid to step onto a scale, were anxious about gaining weight…suggesting that the negative effects of being weighed can linger…[and] suggest[ing] that the weight/ fitness requirements acted as a socio-cultural pressure that would substantially increase the women’s risk of developing an eating disorder in the future.&quot;

Disordered eating, along with amenorrhea and bone demineralization, form what clinicians refer to as the female athletic triad, or FAT. In contribution to these eating disorders that these female athletes develop, Results in the lack of nutrition. This can lead to the loss of several or more consecutive periods which then leads to calcium and bone loss, putting the athlete at great risk of fracturing bones and damaging tissues. Each of these conditions is a medical concern as they create serious health risks that may be life-threatening to the individual. While any female athlete can develop the triad, adolescent girls are considered most at risk because of the active biological changes and growth spurts that they experience, rapidly changing life circumstances that are observed within the teenage years, and peer and social pressures.

=== Social media ===
Researchers have said the most pervasive and influential factor controlling body image perception is the mass media. One study examined the impact of celebrity and peer Instagram images on women&#x27;s body image as, “comparisons will be most readily made with individuals who are perceived as being similar” to the target as there is more of a relationship between the two parties. The participants in this study, 138 female undergraduate students ages 18–30, were shown 15 images each of attractive celebrities, attractive unknown peers, and travel destinations. The participant&#x27;s reactions were observed and visual scales were used to measure mood and dissatisfaction before and after viewing the images. The findings of this experiment determined that negative mood and body dissatisfaction rankings were greater after being exposed to the celebrity and peer images, with no difference between celebrity versus peer images. The media is especially dangerous for females at risk for developing body image issues, and disordered eating, because the sheer number of possible comparisons become larger. Nutrition fraud has also become prevalent on social media, with some users spreading &quot;misleading claims for food and nutrition products. These products can include traditional foods, dietary supplements, dietary products, food substances, diet plans and devices.&quot; This can lead to those influenced at a greater risk for developing body image issues, or disordered eating. With many looking to the internet for nutrition and medical help, the large amount of false information circulating on platforms is very concerning for users.

<doc id="929376" wikidata="Q1357724" url="?curid=929376" title="Koruna Česká (party)">
<text>Czech Crown (Monarchist Party of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia) (, Monarchiste.cz) is a Czech monarchist political party that strives for the restoration of Czech monarchy with the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. The party was founded in 1990 and its current leader is . In the 2017 Czech legislative election, Koruna Česká ran in a coalition with TOP 09 and received 5.35% of the vote. In the 2019 European Parliament election, it ran together with the KDU-ČSL and received 7.24% of the vote.

== History ==

=== Political movement ===
Koruna Česká is one of the oldest active political parties in the Czech Republic founded after the end of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia. Its precursor was a monarchist civic initiative, &quot;&quot;, founded in 1988 by Petr Placák as a dissident group against the communist regime. They published a samizdat magazine called &quot;Koruna&quot;.

Koruna Česká as a political movement was founded on 25 November 1990 in Prague&#x27;s Švanda Theatre, officially naming itself &quot;Czech Crown (Royalist Movement of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia)&quot;. was elected as its first leader. On 14 December 1991 the first General Assembly of Koruna Česká convened. In 1993 KČ formed a political partnership with the Christian Democratic Party of Václav Benda and in the following years they closely cooperated, until the latter merged with the Civic Democratic Party in 1996.

The second leader of KČ (1997–1999) was and the third (1999–2003) was , a musician and brother of famous Czech rock singer Jiří Schelinger. In 2003 KČ was transformed from a political movement into a political party.

=== Political party ===
In May 2003 Schelinger resigned as the leader of the party and in November 2003 , who had been the party&#x27;s hejtman of Bohemia, was elected as the new leader. Since 2004 the party has actively contested in every election. In the 2006 Czech municipal elections they gained their first local councillors and mayors.

While in the early years, the official position of KČ was that they have no authority to decide who would be the new Czech king, in 2007 KČ clarified its monarchist position as legitimism (actively supporting the claim of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine as descendants of Charles I of Austria, the last King of Bohemia).

In 2011 KČ suffered an internal crisis when a &quot;conservative platform&quot; was formed, critical of the policy of the party and striving to shift its political position more in a national conservative direction. The conservative platform tried to take over the party, but it was defeated during the XX General Assembly in November 2011. Many of its members then left the party and founded a conservative monarchist association called MONOS.

In the 2013 Czech presidential election, the first direct presidential election in the country, KČ boycotted the election, as it was contrary to its goal of unelected head of state. At the same time, an independent monarchist candidate, sculptor announced his candidacy, but he failed to gather enough signatures of citizens to become a candidate. Some members of KČ supported him, while others urged the party to support the candidacy of Karel Schwarzenberg as an aristocrat and a personal friend of the royal house. KČ remained neutral, but issued a statement that if monarchists want to participate, then Schwarzenberg is the best choice. Some KČ members also created mock ballots for Karl von Habsburg as an heir to the throne, which garnered some media attention.

In the 2013 legislative election KČ competed in 11 of 14 regions. They were locally successful in Hlinná in Ústí nad Labem Region, where they got 16% of the vote.

In the 2014 Senate election a coalition candidate of KČ and ODS -- -- was successful in Plzeň. In the XXIII General Assembly on 29 November 2014 defeated with 72% of the vote to become the new leader of the party.

In the 2017 legislative election, Koruna Česká -- together with the Conservative Party and Club of Committed Non-Party Members -- agreed to jointly endorse TOP 09, while TOP 09 added candidates of the smaller parties to its list. The TOP 09 list eventually received 5.3% of the vote, winning seven seats in the parliament, albeit none of them for KČ members.

In the 2018 presidential election KČ again boycotted the election and urged their members to cast a symbolic but invalid ballot for Karl von Habsburg. But in the 2018 Czech Senate election, Jitka Chalánková, an independent candidate running with the support of Koruna Česká and the Conservative Party, was successful.

In the XXVII General Assembly in November 2018, was elected as the new leader of the party.

In the 2019 European Parliament election Koruna Česká, together with other smaller parties, formed a coalition with the KDU-ČSL; their combined list received 7.24% of the vote. After the election, KČ suggested Archduke Karl von Habsburg as the next President of the European Commission and sent a formal request to the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic to support him. Since June 2019 Czech royalists have been heavily involved in the protests against Prime Minister Andrej Babiš and President Miloš Zeman as was reported by some Czech media and the International Monarchist League.

<text>Jill Savege (born March 17, 1974) is a Canadian triathlete. Born in Toronto, Ontario, Savege now lives in Thousand Oaks, California. A graduate of Simon Fraser University, she was a swimmer while a student and only turned to triathlon after graduation.

In 2003 Savege had an excellent year capturing a number of world circuit titles and winning gold at the Pan-American Games. She was ranked as one of the best in the world. However, a number of injuries have since deprived her of top form. She was still considered a medal contender at the 2004 Summer Olympics and was going in ranked fourth in the world. However, early in the cycling stage of the Olympic triathlon she crashed and only finished 39th with a time of 2:18:10.99.

== Personal life ==
Savege is married to Jordan Rapp, the 2011 ITU Long Distance Triathlon world champion.

<text>Intensive stage, or by its full name, &quot;predominantly intensive stage of accumulation&quot; pertains to one of the periodizations of capitalism, as proposed by Aglietta (1976). It is the second stage of capitalism: when the extensive stage becomes exhausted, expansion of (commodity) production is reduced to the increase in productivity of labour, or to the &quot;intensification&quot; of production.

The extensive stage reached its limits in England by the 1810s and after a lease of life through imperial expansion, definitively by the 1860s; in Germany, by the 1880s; in the US, by the 1920s (Aglietta, 1976); in Brazil, by the 1970s. In contemporary capitalism (or Late capitalism) it is generalized over virtually the whole world economy and some see itself having reached its limits with the exhaustion of the post-war boom by the mid-1960s.

It is disputed whether the social organization—or mode of production—based on commodity production and wage labour, that is to say, capitalism itself, can make a transition from its present form to one in which the ever-increasing branch of services can be commodified.

<text>TASIS or TASIS Switzerland, formally known as The American School In Switzerland, is a private American international boarding and day school in Switzerland. TASIS ranked number 67 in IB test scores among European private schools.

Located in Montagnola, Collina D&#x27;Oro near Lugano, in the Canton of Ticino, the school enrolls approximately 700 pupils from around the world. It offers a primary school, middle school and high school.

==Accreditation==

=== Switzerland ===
TASIS&#x27;s (upper) secondary education (middle and high school) is not approved as a Mittelschule/Collège/Liceo by the Swiss Federal State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI), meaning it does not offer the Swiss Federal Matura. It does offer the International Baccalaureate.

=== United States ===
TASIS is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges.

=== International ===
TASIS is accredited by the European Council of International Schools. It is not accredited by the Council of International Schools.

==History==
TASIS was founded in 1956 by M. Crist Fleming. For the first few years the school was operating, it was located in Locarno, then in Lugano-Loreto until the purchase of the 17th-century Villa de Nobili in Montagnola in 1960. The school added a post-graduate program in 1959 and summer programs in 1972. Since its establishment, TASIS has expanded to include schools and summer programs in England, Greece, Cyprus, Italy, France, Spain, and Puerto Rico.

The school is owned by the TASIS Foundation, a non-profit organization.

==Academics==
Elementary students follow the Core Knowledge Foundation curriculum as well as an Italian Section curriculum. Middle and high school program includes English-as-an-Additional-Language (EAL) content courses, Advanced Placement courses, and the International Baccalaureate program.

Students are required to wear school uniforms.

===Athletics===
TASIS offers soccer, volleyball, basketball, swimming, tennis, badminton, track and cross country at the varsity and junior varsity levels. Students travel throughout Switzerland and Europe for tournaments.

TASIS is a member of the Swiss Group of International Schools (SGIS).

==Campus==
The TASIS campus is located on the Collina d&#x27;Oro, overlooking the city of Lugano and Lake Lugano to the North. The most notable campus building is Villa De Nobili, a 17th-century mansion that still contains the suits of armor placed there when the building was owned by Marchese De Nobili, Italian Ambassador to Switzerland. It houses dormitories, classrooms, administrative offices, and the school&#x27;s dining room.

== Media coverage ==
Davide Illarietti writing in 2023 for Corriere del Ticino noted the school has &quot;the reputation of the &#x27;school of the oligarchs.&#x27;&quot; Illarietti described the scene &quot;after the bell&quot; as security officers escort students to &quot;a parade of mothers&quot; who pick them up in &quot;Mercedes, Bentley&#x27;s and Ferraris,&quot; as looking &quot;like a big time gala,&#x27; &quot;

In 2021, Radio Free Europe reported that Leonid Slutsky, a member of Russia&#x27;s Duma who was sanctioned by the US, had enrolled his daughter at TASIS.

The school has been separately listed by outlets The Independent and SCMP as one of the most expensive both in Switzerland and the world based on its boarding fees.

<text>Lava Records (Lava Music, LLC) is an American record label owned by Jason Flom, in partnership with Universal Music Group.

==Company history==
In 1995, Flom launched Lava Records in partnership with Atlantic Records. For the next decade, he continued to discover and champion artists under the Lava label who went on to sell over 100 million records globally, including Matchbox 20, Kid Rock, The Corrs, Simple Plan, The Blue Man Group, Edwin McCain, Sugar Ray, and Trans-Siberian Orchestra. Flom also signed his first black artist, David Josias, known for his hit single “Mindblowin”.

In 2004, Flom sold Lava Records to Atlantic Records Group, where he was named chairman and CEO of the Atlantic Records Group. In this role, he oversaw a resurgence of the label and continued to sign and break major artists, most notably Paramore.

Following 15 years of success at Atlantic and Lava, Flom was tapped in 2005 as Chairman and CEO of Virgin Records. In 2007, he led a merger with Capitol Records to create the Capitol Music Group, where he was named Chairman and CEO. During Flom’s tenure, he oversaw releases from artists including Lenny Kravitz, Coldplay, and the Rolling Stones. In keeping with his track record of identifying and supporting new talent, under Flom’s leadership eleven new artists rose to gold, platinum and multi-platinum status, which included Thirty Seconds to Mars. In 2007 he signed Katy Perry and personally A&amp;R’d her debut album, &quot;One of the Boys&quot;.

In 2008, Flom departed from Capitol Music Group to re-launch his own Lava Records label, this time in partnership with Universal Music Group’s industry-leading Republic Records. There he signed Jessie J, whose 2011 singles under the Lava banner &quot;Do It Like a Dude&quot; and &quot;Price Tag&quot; featuring B.o.B, topped the singles charts in the UK and 17 other countries. Her multi-platinum debut album &quot;Who You Are&quot; sold over three million copies worldwide.

In 2013, Flom identified Lorde, a then-unknown artist from New Zealand, and Lava released her debut single, &quot;Royals,&quot; which stayed at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 for eight weeks, becoming the biggest alternative radio hit by a female artist. Lorde went on to win two Grammy Awards including Song of the Year for “Royals” at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards.

Following successful Lava rock releases from Black Veil Brides and their frontman Andy Black, Flom signed breakthrough rock band Greta Van Fleet to Lava in 2017, who revitalized the global rock scene with multiple number one rock hits and over 1 million albums sold, all while touring over the last several years. When Robert Plant was asked about Greta Van Fleet in an interview with Australia&#x27;s Network Ten, he proclaimed, &quot;They are Led Zeppelin I,&quot; and described 21-year-old Josh Kiszka as &quot;...a beautiful little singer. I hate him.” Elton John lauded the band in the LA Times: &quot;Whoever says rock music is dead is completely wrong. When I first saw them, they knocked me out...They are going to be one of the biggest bands of the year.&quot; The band picked up four nominations at the 2018 Grammy Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Rock Album for their double-EP &quot;From the Fires&quot;.

Flom founded Lava Publishing in 2014, which includes among its roster of writers break-out alternative rocker Evan Konrad, writer/performer Maty Noyes, and all four members of Greta Van Fleet. 

Flom also founded the podcast company Lava for Good, which has produced critically-acclaimed podcasts &quot;Bone Valley&quot; and &quot;Earwitness&quot; (about the case of Alabama death row prisoner Toforest Johnson), both of which were named to Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s list of Top 30 True Crime Podcasts of All Time.

<doc id="929395" wikidata="Q2539423" url="?curid=929395" title="Imperiex">
<text>Imperiex () is a supervillain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. He was initially introduced as an adversary to the superhero Superman before becoming a main antagonist for the crossover &quot;Our Worlds at War&quot;.

Imperiex has made limited appearances in media outside comics, with Phil Morris voicing him in the animated series &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;.

==Publication history==

Imperiex first appeared in &quot;Superman&quot; vol. 2 #153 (February 2000), and was created by Jeph Loeb and Ed McGuinness. He is heavily inspired by Marvel Comics character Galactus.

==Fictional character biography==
The embodiment of entropy, Imperiex takes the form of pure energy contained in armor. Since the beginning of the universe, he has repeatedly destroyed it to create a new one from the remains of the old. 

In the present, Imperiex and his probes attempt to destroy Earth, which serves as a keystone for the universe. They destroy Daxam, Almerac, Kalanor, and Karna, among other planets, before Brainiac absorbs Imperiex&#x27;s powers and consciousness. Superman and Lex Luthor retrieve one of Imperiex&#x27;s probes and combine it with a temporal weapon and Darkseid&#x27;s energy to transport Imperiex and Brainiac to the beginning of the universe, killing them.
During the conflict with Imperiex, Doomsday, Strange Visitor, Sgt. Rock, Maxima, Aquaman, Guy Gardner, Hippolyta, Sam Lane, and Steel are killed or presumed dead.

== Powers and abilities ==
Being the embodiment of entropy, Imperiex wields the power of the Big Bang, and can project powerful blasts of energy as well as create black holes capable of destroying entire universes. He also possesses superhuman strength, durability, and speed, and can create smaller probes resembling him.

==In other media==
===Television===

Imperiex appears in the second season of &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, voiced by Phil Morris. This version originates from Apokolips in the 41st century, possesses cybernetic enhancements, and was originally a gladiator before becoming a universal conqueror, with the artificial intelligence K3NT creating a clone of Superman named Kell-El to oppose him. After Kell-El travels to the 31st century to gain the Legion of Super-Heroes&#x27;s help, Imperiex follows him through time and allies with the Fatal Five, the Legion of Super-Villains, and the Dominators. Eventually, he manipulates Brainiac 5 into succumbing to the original Brainiac&#x27;s influence, only to be betrayed and killed by him.

===Film===
The &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot; incarnation of Imperiex makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in &quot;Scooby-Doo! and Krypto, Too!&quot;.

===Video games===
Imperiex appears as a character summon in &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
* Imperiex appears in &quot;Injustice 2&quot; #19.
* An alternate universe incarnation of Imperiex appears in the &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot; tie-in comic book as the evolved monstrous form of Doctor Psycho.

<text>A gope board (or kwoi) is a wooden ritual object made in the Papuan Gulf of New Guinea. Each board represents the spirit of an ancestral hero that can protect clans from evil spirits and death.

== Design ==
&quot;Gope&quot; is a term for a spiritually charged carved board made to represent an ancestral hero in the Papuan Gulf of Papua New Guinea. Papuan Gulf people of Kikori, Baimaru, Uruma, Hohao, and Orokolo refer to these sculptured boards as &quot;Kwoi&quot;. 

The sculptures are often made from the sides of an old canoe. 

==Use==
Gope sculptures are believed to protect the island clansmen from evil spirits and death A full size board is made and named by the uncle of a boy for his initiation (into adulthood) ceremony. Also, warriors are awarded gope boards for each act of bravery they perform in battle—these boards are often made from the remains of an enemy&#x27;s canoe. Gope boards have a consistent elliptical shape and can vary in size up to eight feet long. They are carved in relief and then painted with lime (to whiten), red ochre, and other native paints. Gope boards have a similar style and may depict the face of an ancestral spirit. Small unnamed gope boards are sometimes given to uninitiated boys.

=== In headhunting ===
Gope boards are also used in raids on other clans and headhunting missions. They are consulted as to which enemy to attack, and the spirits contained in the boards are thought to go in advance of the warriors to sap the enemies of their strength. &quot;Agiba&quot; (or &quot;skull racks&quot;) are similar to Gope boards and are used to display any skulls won in battle.

<text>Avco Records was a record label started by music producers/composers Hugo Peretti and Luigi Creatore together with film and TV producer Joseph E. Levine in 1968 as Avco Embassy Records.

==History==
Hugo and Luigi had previously worked together from the late 1950s for a number of labels, including Mercury, Roulette, and RCA Victor, where they were involved with acts such as Elvis Presley, the Tokens, and Sam Cooke. Levine was the head of Avco Embassy Pictures following a long career in the film industry.

Avco&#x27;s best-known artists were the R&amp;B/soul groups the Stylistics, who had a series of major hits in the pop and R&amp;B charts mainly produced by Thom Bell, and Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials. One of the most memorable albums recorded for Avco was 1975&#x27;s &quot;Disco Baby&quot; by top producer/arranger/writer Van McCoy. This featured the classic disco hit &quot;The Hustle&quot;, a million-seller that topped both the Billboard Hot 100 and the R&amp;B chart, as well as charts worldwide (#3 in the UK). The release was the company&#x27;s only Number 1 success in the US, although the Stylistics&#x27; &quot;You Make Me Feel Brand New&quot; stayed at #2 for two weeks in the Hot 100 in 1974. In the UK, the same group&#x27;s &quot;Can&#x27;t Give You Anything (But My Love)&quot; was a #1 hit in mid-1975.

Early on, the other artists released on the label covered a wide range of music. Of the many soul acts on their roster, they included Donnie Elbert, the Softones, Maxine Brown, Chocolate Syrup, Limmie &amp; the Family Cookin&#x27;. Pop song stylist turned actress and talk show hostess Della Reese had a disco-styled outing on the label with &quot;If It Feels Good&quot;.

The label was named simply Avco Records when the &#x27;Embassy&#x27; part was dropped in 1971. In 1976, with Avco deciding to exit the record business, Hugo &amp; Luigi bought out the label &amp; renamed it to H&amp;L Records. In 1978, H&amp;L Records filed for bankruptcy, soon after opening their own new studios in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. In 1984, Amherst Records of Buffalo, New York, acquired the Avco/H&amp;L Records catalog.

<text>Tu B&#x27;Av () is a minor Jewish holiday. In modern-day Israel, it is celebrated as a holiday of love ( ), akin to Valentine&#x27;s Day. It has been said to be an auspicious day for weddings.

==Etymology==
Called Tu B&#x27;Av because of the sound of the two Hebrew letters whose combined numerical value corresponds to that of the date (15). The value 15 is obtained by combining the values of the letter Tet (9) and Vav (6), which, together, can be read as &quot;tu,&quot; hence the name of the festival, Tu b&#x27;Av. The number 15 can also be obtained by combining the letters Yud (10) and Hey (5), but such combination would coincide with the first two letters of the Tetragrammaton, and thus are supplanted by the letters Tet and Vav to avoid using a name for the divine. Av is the name of the month in the Jewish calendar.

==Historical significance==
According to the Mishna, Tu B&#x27;Av was a joyous holiday in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, marking the beginning of the grape harvest. On Yom Kippur and Tu B&#x27;Av, the unmarried girls of Jerusalem dressed in white garments and went out to dance in the vineyards. The Talmud states that there were no holy days as happy for the Jews as Tu B&#x27;Av and Yom Kippur.

Various reasons for celebrating on Tu B&#x27;Av are cited by the Talmud and Talmudic commentators:
* While the Israelites wandered in the desert for forty years, female orphans without brothers could only marry within their tribe to prevent their father&#x27;s inherited territory in the Land of Israel from passing on to other tribes, following the incident of the Daughters of Zelophehad. After the conquest and division of Canaan under Joshua, this ban was lifted on the fifteenth of Av and inter-tribal marriage was allowed.
* At the end of Israel&#x27;s wandering in the wilderness, the last remnant of the generation of the sin of the spies, which had been forbidden from entering the Promised Land, found that they were not destined to die. For forty years, every Tisha B&#x27;av the Israelites made graves for themselves in which they slept expecting to be their last night; every year a proportion of them died. In the 40th year, the fifteen thousand who had remained from the first generation went to sleep in the graves and woke up the next day to their surprise. Thinking they made a mistake with the date, they kept sleeping in graves until they reached Tu B&#x27;Av and saw a full moon. Only then did they know they were going to enter the Land of Israel with the new generation.
*The Tribe of Benjamin was allowed to intermarry with the other tribes after the incident of the Concubine of Gibeah (see ).
*Cutting of the wood for the main altar in the Temple was completed for the year. The holiday celebrated the wood-offering brought in the Temple (see ). Josephus refers to it as the Feast of Xylophory (&quot;Wood-bearing&quot;).
*King Hoshea of the northern kingdom removed the sentries on the road leading to Jerusalem, allowing the ten tribes to once again have access to the Temple.
*The nights, traditionally the ideal time for Torah study, are lengthened again after the summer solstice, permitting more study.
*The Roman occupiers permitted burial of the victims of the massacre at Bethar during the Bar Kochba rebellion. Miraculously, the bodies had not decomposed, despite exposure to the elements for over a year.

==Modern times==
Tu B&#x27;Av is a day of joy that follows Tisha B&#x27;Av by six days and contrasts with the sadness of Tisha B&#x27;Av. Tu B&#x27;Av does not have many established religious rituals associated with its celebration except that Tachanun is not said—either at mincha the day before or on the day itself—and a bride and groom traditionally do not fast if their wedding falls on Tu B&#x27;Av. These customs commemorate the happy events that occurred in the history of the Jewish People.

In modern times, it has become a romantic Jewish holiday among secular Jews who mostly see it as the Jewish equivalent of Valentine&#x27;s Day. After experiencing a surge in popularity in the modern state of Israel, Israelis prefer to celebrate love on Tu B&#x27;Av and North American Jewish organizations throw celebrations and offer teachings on Tu B&#x27;Av. It serves as a day for matchmaking, weddings, and proposing, but also for increasing Torah study. Tu B&#x27;Av is more popular than Valentine&#x27;s Day since secular Jews and Haredi celebrate Tu B&#x27;Av while Haredi are less likely to be aware of Valentine&#x27;s Day.
==Pop culture==
In Isaac Blum&#x27;s 2022 novel, &quot;The Life and Crimes of Hoodie Rosen&quot; the story begins during Tu B&#x27;Av.

<text>The &quot;Le Redoutable&quot;-class submarine was a ballistic missile submarine class of the French Navy (&quot;Marine Nationale&quot;). In French, the type is called &quot;Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d&#x27;Engins&quot; (SNLE), literally &quot;Missile-launching nuclear submarine&quot;. When commissioned, they constituted the strategic part of the naval component of the French nuclear triad, then called &quot;Force de frappe&quot; (the aircraft carriers and constituting the tactical part).

The class entered active service in 1971 with , six submarines were built in total. All have since been decommissioned. The structural changes in &quot;Inflexible&quot; have seen it regarded as a different class from the early boats. The class has been superseded by the .

==Background==
With the election of Charles de Gaulle as president of France, the French Armed Forces saw a change in direction. Under the new government, French forces were withdrawn from NATO formations due to French unhappiness with American domination of the group. Beginning in the 1960s, French foreign policy would be reshaped to create independence from both of the major opponents of the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union. This was later defined in the mantra &quot;to deter – to intervene – to defend&quot;. From the foreign policy arose the concept of submarine-based &quot;Force de Dissuassion&quot;, with emphasis on the &quot;to deter&quot;, which was the focus of new French naval spending.

The new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed submarine force was planned to be of similar size to the British Royal Navy. However, unlike the British, the French received no support from other nations and the French nuclear program began with a lack of technological expertise to draw from. Furthermore, the Americans refused to provide the French Navy with enriched uranium for the creation of a nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, the project was authorized in 1963. The French Navy resorted to working in conjunction with the civil French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (French: &quot;Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives&quot;), which the US allowed to acquire enriched uranium for experimental land use. A nuclear plant was constructed on land at Cadarache and the reactor was tested to simulate nuclear-powered submarine patrols. Other developments made by the groups working on the project include the development of high-tensile steel by France and the adaption of the submarine hull to nuclear propulsion.

At the same time as the French were developing nuclear propulsion, they were also researching ballistic missiles and nuclear warheads. Caissons were constructed to test fire missiles and by 1967, the submarine was fitted with the guidance and navigation systems to be tested. The first ballistic missile launch was at the Landes Trials Centre (French: &quot;Centre d&#x27;Essais des Landes&quot;) at the end of 1968 and nuclear warheads were tested at Moruroa in the Pacific Ocean.

==Description==

Designated &quot;Sous-marin Nucléaire Lanceur d&#x27;Engins&quot; (SNLE) literally &quot;Missile-launching nuclear submarine&quot;, the design initially measured long overall with a beam of and a draught of . The submarines initially displaced surfaced and submerged. This later increased to surfaced. The submarines were powered by one pressurised water reactor providing steam to two turbines and two alternators and turning one propeller via a turbo reduction drive creating . The submarines also sported electric emergency propulsion capable of providing a range of . The vessels could dive more than and had a maximum speed of . Each boat had two twin crews comprising 15 officers and 120 men.

===Armament===
The &quot;Redoutable&quot; class all have 16 compartments for submarine-launched ballistic missiles. &quot;Redoutable&quot; initially deployed with 16 the M1 MSBS (&quot;Mer-Sol Balistique Stratégique&quot;). The M1 missile was a two stage ballistic missile with a height and each missile weighed . The M1 had a 400-kiloton warhead and an approximate range. &quot;Terrible&quot; was also constructed to carry this missile. The design of &quot;Foudroyant&quot; was altered to carry the improved M2 MSBS missile in 1974. The M2 was heavier at , had a 500-kiloton warhead and a longer range than the M1. In 1977, both the M1 and M2 were replaced by the M20 MSBS.

==Vessels in class==
==Service history==
The first submarine, &quot;Redoutable&quot;, was ordered in 1963, built at Cherbourg, launched in 1967 and commissioned in 1971. This was replaced by the M2 MSBS beginning in 1974, which was in turn replaced by the M20 MSBS beginning in 1977. All except &quot;Redoutable&quot; were heavily upgraded from 1985 to fire the second generation MIRV capable M4 missile – &quot;Tonnant&quot; was recommissioned in 1987; &quot;Indomptable&quot; in 1989; &quot;Terrible&quot; in 1990; and &quot;Foudroyant&quot; in 1993.
&quot;Redoutable&quot; has been preserved since 2002 as a museum ship at the &quot;Cité de la Mer&quot; naval museum in Cherbourg-Octeville, France. The reactor compartment has been replaced by a new section.

<doc id="929431" wikidata="Q1254743" url="?curid=929431" title="Gulf of Papua">
<text>The Gulf of Papua is located in the southern coast region of New Guinea. It has a total surface area of .

== Geography ==
Some of New Guinea&#x27;s largest rivers, such as the Fly River, Turama River, Kikori River, Purari River, and Wawoi River flow into the gulf, making it a large delta. While the western coast is characterized by swampy tidal waterways, land to the east ending at Cape Possession is flat and sandy.

The Papuan Gulf&#x27;s central and eastern interior slowly rises to meet the mountainous Southern Highlands and is covered in a variety of inland swamps and dense tropical hardwood forests. The western interior possesses a large region of limestone karst. The dry season begins in October and extends to February, after which the wet season starts.

The southern border of the gulf is defined as a line from the southwestern corner of the Fly River Delta in the west, to Cape Suckling 355 km east of this, which is 70 km northwest of Port Moresby. This encloses a sea area of approximately 35,000 km². The Gulf of Papua forms a broad shelf with a maximum width of about 150 km between the shelf break, at about 140 m water depth, and the Fly Delta. It narrows to less than 20 km east of the Purari River delta. In the southwest, the Gulf adjoins the broad, shallow Torres Strait shelf, at the northeastern tip of Australia.

The Gulf of Papua shelf can be divided into four geomorphic zones: a low-relief, inner-shelf, deltaic zone; a high-relief, mid- to outer-shelf incised valley zone; a high-relief, southern reef zone; and a moderate to low-relief mid- to outer shelf zone in the east and northeast. The deltaic zone is an extensive flat, shallow surface in 5–30 m water depth. It is bordered by a relatively steep delta region in 20–50 m of water, that extends along the coast between the tide-dominated Fly and wave-dominated Purari River mouths. 
The incised valley zone has a complex, offshore-onshore-trending seafloor topography on the middle to outer shelf between 50 m and 100 m water depth. Evidence suggests that the largest of these valleys formed by erosive tidal currents during the Pleistocene when the sea level was about 30–50 m below its present position. The reef zone is a complex of barrier and patch reefs south of 9° 30&#x27; lat., the bathymetry is rugged near steep-sided coral reefs which locally may have vertical sides. Between the reefs, however, the shelf is a mostly flat and featureless surface with water depths of 20–50 m. Water depths increase rapidly to the east of the Great Barrier Reef, which is located on the shelf margin of the Coral Sea basin in water 120–140 m deep. The moderate- to low-relief mid- to outer shelf zone lies north of the incised valleys and offshore from the deltaic zone. Although the 60 m to 80 m isobaths suggest the existence of east-west trending valleys, these are much lower in relief than those to the south. Generally, this zone forms a low-relief plain, gently dipping towards the shelf break which is in about 140 m of water. A drowned barrier reef system forms a rim near the shelf break along the southeastern part of the Gulf.

== Demographics and economy ==
Communities inhabiting the Papuan Gulf primarily live in both villages on the shore or coastal mangrove forests, as well as in key regional centers (Kikori, Baimuru, Ihu, Kerema, and Malalaua). These semi-urban centers are where the health services are located, as well as high schools, and large trade stores. The provincial government of the Gulf Province, which administers the bulk of the Papuan Gulf, is located in Kerema. As a result of the services available in these centers, they are all composed of a mixture of Papuan Gulf ethnic groups.

Since the 1950s, people of the Gulf of Papua have been migrating to Papua New Guinea&#x27;s national capital Port Moresby to find work. As a result of these demographic shifts, Port Moresby is home to a sizable community of Papuan Gulf residents. They are located primarily in the settlements of Kaugere, Kila Kila, and Horse Camp. Gulf Communities have access to a regional air service that connects them to the wider nation.

A sealed road links communities near Malalaua to Port Moresby. When not washed out a dirt road connects Kerema to Malalaua. Despite this infrastructure, the primary means of travel remains canoes and fiber-glass dinghies with outboard motors. Within the Purari Delta and among the Elema it is common for individuals, particularly men, to travel to Port Moresby at least once a year to see relatives and to earn money.

Today, people primarily rely on fishing and hunting, sago palms, and depending on the area agriculture and horticulture. Communities in the eastern Gulf (Toaripi and Elema), where the soil is elevated have large gardens. Communities (Purari, Urama, Gope, Goaribari, Kerewa) in the west have small inland gardens and tend to focus their cultivation efforts on a variety of fruit and nut-bearing trees.

Since the early 1990s, communities of the Papuan Gulf have experienced intensive localized development by multinational companies in search of oil and revenue found in the region&#x27;s tropical hardwood forest. With the development of the Kutubu oil project in the Southern Highlands, an oil pipeline now stretches from the oil wells to an offshore oil terminal in the Gulf of Papua.

Since the mid-1990s, several logging camps have been established, several of which are operated by the Malaysian company Rimbunan Hijau. Communities whose land and water resources are being impacted by these projects receive some monetary compensation through royalty payments. As a result, impacted communities now can purchase rice, tinned fish, kerosene, etc. The long-term social and environmental impacts of these resource extraction projects have yet to be assessed.

== Cultural history ==
The diverse set of cultural groups that inhabit this region possess some loose cultural affinities. The majority speak non-Austronesian languages and possess patrilineal descent systems. Communities are organized based on tribal and clan boundaries. While these boundaries have remained intact over time, Gulf communities do now intermarry within the region and with outside ethnic groups.

During the region&#x27;s early colonial period (1880–1920), communities became renowned in Europe for their large-scale longhouses and their fantastic artworks. In the Purari Delta, the Purari constructed buildings with facades of 80 feet, which then tapered down along a central ridge pole of 120 feet. In contrast, the Goaribari, who occupied the mouth of the Omati and Kikori Rivers, possessed longhouses that were uniform in height (20 feet) and reached lengths of 600 feet. While communities in the east (the Purari, Elema, and Toaripi) no longer construct these buildings, it is still possible to find longhouses among Urama, Gope, and Era River communities. These buildings were where many of the region&#x27;s incredible ritual arts were made and stored.

Rituals such as headhunting and cannibalism were common in the Gulf of Papua before foreign contact. These rituals included displays of magic powers and the initiation of young men. An integral part of these rituals is tribal art. This art is mostly made of wood and is carved in relief and painted with local dyes of red ochre, lime, and coal. Examples of this art are sculptures, masks, bullroarers, and gope.

Several authors, namely the British anthropologist Alfred Haddon (1920) and the art historian Douglas Newton (1961), have noted similarities between the Papuan Gulf&#x27;s various art forms with that of groups living along the Sepik River. Based on these formal similarities they have suggested the possibility of a cultural link between the two areas. However, to date, no scholarly research has confirmed such a linkage, and it remains a speculation based on stylistic similarities.

<doc id="929444" wikidata="Q1548451" url="?curid=929444" title="QF 4.5-inch Mk I – V naval gun">
<text>The QF 4.5 inch gun has been the standard medium-calibre naval gun used by the Royal Navy as a medium-range weapon capable of use against surface, aircraft and shore targets since 1938. This article covers the early 45-calibre family of guns up to the 1970s. For the later unrelated 55-calibre Royal Navy gun, see 4.5 inch Mark 8 naval gun. Like all British nominally 4.5 inch naval guns, the QF Mk I has an actual calibre of 4.45 inches (113 mm).

==Background==
From the BL Mark I gun of 1916 the 4.7-inch (120 mm) calibre was the mid-calibre weapon of the Royal Navy, used particularly on destroyers. Apart from some ships armed with QF 4-inch Mk V guns due to shortages, it remained the standard weapon for destroyers up to the W-class destroyers of 1943. Its usefulness as an anti-aircraft weapon had been limited by the failure to develop a mounting with elevation over 55°, the lack of a predictive fire control system in destroyer classes built prior to the introduction of the 4.7 inch twin mount (see HACS), and the setting of fuzes by hand on early, pre-war, mountings. Later 4.7 inch mountings used mechanical fuze setters that were identical to those used on the 4.5 inch mountings.

==History==
The QF 4.5 inch L/45 was developed originally as a dual-purpose weapon with which to arm aircraft carriers and reconstructed battleships and battlecruisers. It was later developed as a new dual-purpose weapon with which to arm destroyers, supplanting the ubiquitous 4.7 inch gun. Despite the lower calibre, it had a heavier shell, resulting in a more powerful weapon.

==Variants==
The nomenclature system for guns used by the Royal Navy can be somewhat confusing. The gun and mounting each have their own Mark number and a letter(s) giving additional information. QF stands for &quot;quick firing&quot;, UD for &quot;upper deck&quot;, BD for &quot;between decks&quot; and CP for &quot;central pivot&quot;.
* QF Mark I: adopted after failure of a 5-inch gun project and used a fixed round, which proved to be somewhat heavy for the loaders to keep up the intended firing rate. Was fitted in twin mountings UD Mark III.
* QF Mark II: Land service used by the British Army.
* QF Mark III: same as Mark I, except for firing mechanism. Was fitted in twin mountings BD Mark II, BD Mark II** and BD Mark IV. HMS Illustrious fired about 3,000 rounds of 4.5-inch ammunition, at an average of 12 rounds per gun per minute, during one action in January 1941.
* QF Mark IV: used a two part (charge and shell) ammunition system. Designed for use by small warships. Fitted in mountings BD Mark IV, CP Mark V and UD Mark VI.
* QF Mark V: a further development of the Mark IV, designed for anti-aircraft use with remote power control (RPC, where the guns automatically train and elevate the target following the director) and a high rate-of-fire assisted by automatic ramming. Carried in the mounting UD Mark VI, with separate high-angle and low-angle hoists for the two types of ammunition (AA and SAP/HE) and a third for the cartridges. The rate of fire of the Mk V was 24 rounds per minute when power-loaded, 12–14 when hand-loaded, and up to 18 in burst mode when hand-loaded. Some 800 naval 4.5-inch guns of various marks were built. 474 guns were built for the army, all in 1939–41.

During the 1950s, a change was made in weapons systems nomenclature which focused on the gun mount rather than the gun. Together with a change from Roman numerals, the Gun QF Mark V on mounting BD Mark VI became simply the Mark 6. The Mark 7 was never produced as the planned &quot;Malta&quot;-class aircraft carriers they would have been used on were never built. The majority of new escort vessels built for the Royal Navy in the 1950s and 1960s carried at least one Mark 6 mounting, with two in the &quot;Leopard&quot;-class frigates and County-class destroyers and three in the &quot;Daring&quot;-class destroyers. This gave these ships a level of firepower unprecedented only 15 years earlier. The Type 81 Tribal-class frigates were an exception, using reconditioned Mark V mounts from scrapped C-class destroyers that were fitted with RPC and known as the Mark 5* Mod 1. The evolution of the 45-calibre 4.5 inch gun family ended with the Mark V gun / Mark 6 mounting. It has been replaced by a new weapon of original design, the 4.5 inch Mark 8 with a 55 calibre-long barrel.

==Land service==

QF Mark II was a single gun mounting (Mounting Mk 1) anti-aircraft gun in static sites. The pedestal mount was bolted to concrete in an unarmoured turret, a travelling platform was available to transport the gun and mounting between positions. The first unit became operational in February 1939. These 16.5 ton anti-aircraft mountings had a maximum elevation angle of 80 degrees. However, most mountings were Mark 1A with an elevation range of -9.5 to 80 degrees. This enabled the gun to be dual role (anti-aircraft and coastal defence) in coastal areas. Armour piercing rounds were provided for anti-ship engagements.

The guns were fitted with Magslip electrical data transfer from Predictors AA Nos 3, 5 and 10 and were probably used initially with GL radars and UB 10 18 feet base optical height and range finders. AA control radars evolved rapidly. The gun was laid and fuzes set by pointer matching, it is unclear the extent to which advances in 3.7-inch fire control were applied to 4.5-inch. During the war Machine Fuze Setter No 10 was added, This improved the rate of fire from 8 to 10 rounds per minute and raised the effective ceiling to 34,500 feet. Gun positions were usually in the vicinity of naval bases where they could use the naval ammunition supply. Initially the standard fuze was an igniferous design, No 199 with a maximum running time of 30 seconds that limited performance. Subsequently, No 209 a mechanical time fuze was introduced. It appears that VT fuzes were not issued. Guns were usually deployed in troops of 4 as part of a two-troop battery, although sections of two guns occupied some positions. Deployment included:

This was used with a 4.5 barrel lined down to 3.7 inches but retaining the large chamber, allowing a large propelling charge to be employed. Ordnance, QF 3.7 inch Mk 6, only on a static mounting, entered service in 1943 and continued in service until 1959. It had an effective ceiling of 45,000 feet. The high performance of QF 3.7 inch Mk 6 and QF 5.25 inch meant that QF 4.5 inch was not retained in land service after World War II.

<doc id="929447" wikidata="Q1481415" url="?curid=929447" title="Mah Nà Mah Nà">
<text>&quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; is a popular song by Italian composer Piero Umiliani. It originally appeared in the Italian film &quot;&quot; (&quot;Svezia, inferno e paradiso&quot;). On its own it was a minor radio hit in the United States and in Britain, but became better known internationally after it was used by The Muppets and on &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;.

&quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; gained popularity in English-speaking countries from its use in the recurring cold open blackout sketch for the 1969–1970 season of &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; first airing in October 1969.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; producer Joan Ganz Cooney heard the track on the radio and decided it would be a perfect addition to the show. Its first Sesame Street performance was by Jim Henson, Frank Oz and Loretta Long (Susan) on the fourteenth episode of the show, broadcast on November 27, 1969. The following Sunday, Henson and his Muppets performed the song on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Seven years later the song was part of the premiere episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

Starting in 1971, &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;—in its second incarnation now at Thames Television where it launched in 1969 in colour—included &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; as part of a background music medley during their frequent slapstick sketches. The medley became a &quot;Benny Hill Show&quot; tradition for the rest of its run.

==Original version==
Although Umiliani used a very similar theme in 1966 for the soundtrack of the Italian film &quot;Ring Around the World&quot;, &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; debuted as part of Umiliani&#x27;s soundtrack for the Italian mondo film &quot;&quot; (1968), an exploitation documentary film about wild sexual activity and other behaviour in Sweden. The song accompanied a scene in the film set in a sauna which gave its original title &quot;&quot; (&quot;Hooray for the Swedish Sauna&quot;). It was performed by a band called Marc 4 (four session musicians from the RAI orchestra) and the lead part was sung by Italian singer/composer Alessandro Alessandroni and his wife Giulia. The song also appeared on the 1968 U.S. soundtrack album released for the film.

&quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; was a hit in many countries in 1968–1969. In the United States, it peaked at No. 55 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart and No. 44 on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; magazine chart in October 1969. It also reached No. 12 on the United States Adult Contemporary chart. In Canada, the song reached No. 22 in the &quot;RPM&quot; magazine top singles charts, October 11, 1969, and No. 5 on the AC Chart a week later. The original UK single release, on the Pye International label (7N 25499), left the artists name uncredited on the label, and a cover version by Giorgio Moroder, pseudonymously credited to &quot;The Great Unknowns&quot; and released the same year on the Major Minor label (MM 658), featured Moroder&#x27;s &quot;Doo-be-doo-be-do&quot; on the B side (also sometimes featured in &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;). Umiliani&#x27;s original version, now credited to Umiliani on the label, was reissued by EMI Records in the UK in 1977 and reached No. 8 in the charts. During its 1–15 September 1969 run on the WLS 890 Hit Parade, the surveys erroneously credited the record to someone named Pete Howard. WPTR did much the same, except that the credit was given to the station&#x27;s disc jockey, J.W. Wagner.

The song&#x27;s lyrics contain no actual words, only iambic nonsense syllables resembling scat singing. At times, melodies from other songs are quoted. One quoted melody is the First Swedish Rhapsody of Hugo Alfvén. The Italian tune &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; is also quoted. In the movie soundtrack version, from which the record was edited, there is a quote of Army bugle call &quot;Assembly&quot;, but this verse was omitted from the record, which instead repeated the first three verses. The Muppets&#x27; version includes part of &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot; by George Shearing.

==Chart history==

==Other versions==
In 1969, Henri Salvador recorded a variation titled &quot;Mais non, mais non&quot; (&quot;But No, But No&quot; or &quot;Of Course Not, Of Course Not&quot;), with lyrics he had written in French to Umiliani&#x27;s tune.

Giorgio Moroder released a version in 1969 under the pseudonyms &quot;The Great Unknowns&quot; (UK 45) and the &quot;Stop Studio Group&quot; (French 45).

In 1969, the Dave Pell Singers recorded a version for Liberty Records which achieved considerable radio exposure.

In 1969, &quot;Mah-Nà-Mah-Nà&quot; was recorded in French by Midas (Roger Giguère).

During its 1969–70 season, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; used the Umiliani recording as background music for a recurring blackout sketch (used as a cold open to the program, before the opening introductory sequence). The otherwise silent bits featured Red and another performer, dressed as moon creatures, playing with equipment left behind by the Apollo program astronauts.
The song is the title track of a 1970 LP on GRT Records (Cat No.: GRT 20003), released after the initial success of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; it is purportedly sung by a fuzzy Muppet lookalike, who is pictured on the sleeve. Other songs on the album, including &quot;Peg O&#x27; My Heart&quot;, &quot;Zip A Dee Doo Dah&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Mud&quot;, and &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; To Town&quot;, are sung with the syllables &quot;mah na mah na&quot; filling in for the actual words of the song. Many tracks also feature kazoo accompaniment.

In 1971, a Hebrew version, &quot;Parah Parah&quot; (&quot;cow by cow&quot;, slang for &quot;one thing at a time&quot;), was released by the duo HaDudaim.

In 1971 it was recorded by Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops for Polydor Records.

In 1972, Ismael Rivera aka &quot;Maelo&quot; a Puerto Rican composer and salsa singer, release the album &quot;Esto fue lo que trajo el barco&quot;, which included the song Maña Maña that uses sample of the original song.

In 1973, a rendition of &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; on the Moog synthesizer was released on the album &quot;More Hot Butter&quot; (Musicor MS 3254) by Hot Butter, best known for the pop tune &quot;Popcorn&quot;. It was re-released on CD in 2000.

In 1984, Odessa comic and pantomime group Maski debuted on television with their short theatrical performance &quot;Vocal duet&quot; () for &quot;Vokrug smekha&quot; comedy TV program. A Pierrot characters (Aleksandr Postolenko) spelling &quot;mana mana&quot;, while his Harlequin partner (Georgiy Deliev) singing motive of the rest of the song.

American disco group Lipstique released a disco version of the song in 1978.

A heavy metal version was recorded by UK band Skin in 1996, for the &quot;Perfect Day&quot; single; a minor hit in the UK – No. 33. The song is however titled &quot;The Muppet Song (Mah Na Mah Na)&quot;.

The British pop group Vanilla also used the song as a basis for their first single &quot;No Way, No Way&quot; in 1997.

A Canadian Dunkin&#x27; Donuts commercial used the song to promote its &quot;Mini Donuts&quot; line in the early 1990s.

In 1999, the Brazilian band Pato Fu used samples of &quot;Mah Nà Mah Nà&quot; in the song &quot;Made In Japan&quot; on the album &quot;Isopor&quot;.

In 2003, several cast members perform their version in the opening scene of episode 1, season 2 of the UK series &quot;The Office&quot;.

A sketch in the final episode of &quot;Jam&quot; in 2000 features a scene where two strangely dressed characters, one carrying a clarinet, sing the song where and when police are trying to find a dead body. When the police find the corpse and are still examining it, the two characters continue to sing the song at the corpse, whilst the clarinet carrier puts the clarinet into the corpse&#x27;s mouth, who &quot;plays&quot; it out of key.

The musical group Cake recorded a horn-driven version of this song featuring many different sounds. This version was recorded as a children&#x27;s song and appears on an album called &quot;For the Kids&quot;, released in 2002, and on their compilation album, &quot;B-Sides and Rarities&quot;, released in 2007.

Surrounding Super Bowl XL in 2006, a version of the song was recorded for the Pittsburgh Steelers, replacing the title syllables with &quot;Polamalu&quot;, the last name of the Steelers&#x27; star strong safety.

Since 2009, the pro soccer team Philadelphia Union&#x27;s fan supporters, the Sons of Ben, have used the song, substituting the group&#x27;s name in place of the song&#x27;s title.

A version sung in Arabic was released by actor/singer Samir Ghanem using the words &quot;anam, anam&quot; (meaning &quot;sleep, sleep&quot;).

In 2011, alternative rock band The Fray released a cover of the song on &quot;&quot;, though a remaster of the original version from &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; performance appears on the soundtrack from the 2011 film &quot;The Muppets&quot;.

The Mexican department store chain Sanborns used a version of this song for their animated commercials featuring the &quot;Tecolotes&quot; (Owl) family mascots.

A cover version of the song was made for the popular music/rhythm game &quot;Just Dance 2015&quot;.

Mexican rock band Maná sung the song on Jimmy Kimmel&#x27;s show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in 2016.

==&quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot; version==

In 1969, British comedian Benny Hill switched from BBC Television to Thames Television. This move also marked the major start of color television in the United Kingdom. As part of the new format by Benny Hill, many risque jokes and sketches were featured. As with the signature &quot;Yakety Sax&quot; instrumental on the end of each show, the implementation of &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot; on &quot;Benny Hill&quot; was used to great effect to reflect the comedy action of particular sketches — notably the ones transitioning into slapstick mode, providing the backdrop of the story of the moment, most often sped up and (mostly) with no audible dialogue.

On the new Thames incarnation of &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot; was part of an organized, horn-driven, four-song instrumental comic medley, starting off with a percussion tapping beat of the track leading into a rendition of &quot;Doo-Bee-Doo-Bee-Doo&quot;, a very early track written by famed record producer Giorgio Moroder, which in itself was directly based on and, as a result, takes on a tightly identical rhythmic cadence and style to &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot;. The four-song medley then continues with a rendition of &quot;Für Elise&quot; (which is always heard with the accompaniment of a flute and a muted trumpet), then &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot;, finally finishing with &quot;Gimme Dat Ding&quot;, then looping back to the start of the progression.

This medley was first used on Thames Episode 10, which was first screened on British television on November the 24th, 1971. The original recordings of the instrumental medley often featured vocals by Benny Hill&#x27;s backing chorus, The Ladybirds. However, as there were numerous recordings and renditions of the &quot;Benny Hill Medley&quot; throughout the entire Thames run, some versions featured other female vocalists (after The Ladybirds departed the show) while the rest of them were otherwise completely instrumental.

==Versions by the Muppets==
Aside from its notoriety as the primary silent comedy sketch scene music for &quot;The Benny Hill Show&quot;, &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; became familiar to many from its renditions by the Muppets on television. In 1969, the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; featured a sketch featuring two Muppet girls voiced by Frank Oz and Loretta Long who are unsure of what to do, until they decide to sing a song. A short, shaggy-haired male Muppet character enters, and begins singing &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot;, prompting the girls to join him. The male Muppet who led the &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; call-and-response was referred to as simply &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot; or &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; in scripts and most &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; albums, though he was named &quot;Bip Bippadotta&quot; (ref. Kip Addotta) on the 1979 album &quot;Every Body&#x27;s Record&quot;. The character was originally performed by Muppets creator Jim Henson, and has performed by Muppeteer veteran Bill Barretta since 2005.

On 30 November 1969, &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; was performed on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; by three new and more fully detailed Muppet characters. The male Muppet character was purple with wild, orange hair and a furry, green tunic, while the female Muppet characters were two identical pink cow-like alien creatures with horns and cone-like mouths (with yellow lips) that always remained open. The female characters – now called the Snowths (originally spelled &quot;Snouths&quot;, as a portmanteau of &quot;snout&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot; since their mouth also served as their noses), both performed by Muppeteer veteran Frank Oz – would shake their heads in apparent disapproval whenever the male character began singing the scat portion of the song. The song &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; was played at a slower tempo and given a more playful, quintessential &quot;children&#x27;s&quot;-style arrangement as opposed to the previous arrangement which was slightly reminiscent of early 1960s calypso music.

In 1976, on the first episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; to be recorded (featuring Juliet Prowse), the 1969 &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; routine from &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; was reworked and used as the first sketch with the same characters and a new recording of the last musical arrangement. &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; became an immediate hit and &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot; was the highlight of that episode. During the sketch, Mahna Mahna managed to dance his way backstage and out of the Muppet Theater, phoning the Snowths to sing the title lyrics one last time and end the song. At the end of the episode, he managed to enter Statler and Waldorf&#x27;s box.

As a result, the original Piero Umiliani recording finally became a hit in the UK (#8 in the UK charts in May 1977), where the &quot;Muppet Show&quot; soundtrack album featuring the Muppets&#x27; version went to number one. It was at that point that the name &quot;Mahna Mahna and The Snouths&quot; was given the incorrect credit of &quot;Mahna Mahna and The Snowths&quot;, which has served as the definitive spelling ever since then. The single from the album, &quot;Halfway Down the Stairs&quot;, reached the top Ten in the UK charts – and its B side was &quot;Mah Na Mah Na&quot; – making the song appear three times in the charts at the same time, albeit as a B side, the Piero Umiliani version and also a track on the album.

Later on in that same episode, a snippet of the song &quot;Lullaby of Birdland&quot; is &#x27;hummed&#x27; during one of the improvisational passages, as part of a running gag involving &quot;Mahna Mahna&quot;.

The later Muppet TV series &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot; (1996–1998) revisited it in a sketch with Sandra Bullock where Kermit the Frog visits a doctor to complain about weird things that happen to him whenever he says the word &quot;phenomena&quot;, namely the Snowths suddenly appear with musical accompaniment to sing their part of the song.

In the Muppets version of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; at 00:02:25, the Snowths make a cameo appearance, singing the titular lyric.

The song is performed in the 2011 feature film &quot;The Muppets&quot;, in which various celebrities sing with the Snowths in the end credits.

==Commercially licensed versions==
In the late 1960s, the original tune was featured in an American television commercial, but the product being pitched has of yet been undetermined. The product was ice tea, nobody has determined the brand. 

The Muppets filmed a new version of the song in 2005, for a New Zealand charity called CanTeen. In the ad, an updated version of the Mahna Mahna puppet was puppeteered and voiced by Bill Barretta, and the lyrics were changed to &quot;Bandanana&quot;, supporting CanTeen&#x27;s &quot;Bandana Week&quot;.

It was featured in the 2005 pilot of the sitcom &quot;Committed&quot; where Marni attempted to get her date to sing a duet with her in a restaurant, and continued to appear in the background in later episodes as her ringtone.

In the 2011 episode &quot;The Firefly&quot; of &quot;Fringe&quot;, the song was playing on a record player in Walter Bishop&#x27;s home while he was creating a formula to restore the missing pieces of his brain—pieces which were surgically removed years before in an agreement with William Bell.

In &quot;This Is My House, This Is My Home,&quot; the (2011) season eight finale of &quot;One Tree Hill&quot;, Nathan Scott performs this song with his daughter, Lydia, as wife Haley James Scott watches.

At the BBC&#x27;s Children in Need 2011 telethon, Kermit and Miss Piggy introduced a performance of the song, which featured many stars of British television, including Harry Hill, Noel Edmonds and Gary Lineker.

Cee Lo Green samples the song in his original Christmas song &quot;All I Need Is Love&quot; which features guest vocals by The Muppets for his 2012 holiday album &quot;Cee Lo&#x27;s Magic Moment&quot;.

A modified version of the song featured in adverts for the BN biscuit in the United Kingdom, which referenced the biscuits&#x27; name.

The Australian sunscreen company Banana Boat used a version of the song with lyrics as a jingle.

In 2007, it was used for a Saturn Aura commercial.

In 2017, it served as the soundtrack for a Ford Explorer commercial, &quot;For What Matters Most,&quot; in which a father and daughter make repeated trips to a hardware store while building a &quot;Pinewood derby&quot; car.

<text>Macedonio Melloni (11 April 1798 – 11 August 1854) was an Italian physicist, notable for demonstrating that radiant heat has similar physical properties to those of light.

==Life==
Born at Parma, in 1824 he was appointed professor at the local University but was compelled to escape to France after taking part in the revolution of 1831. In 1839 he went to Naples and was soon appointed director of the Vesuvius Observatory, a post that he held until 1848. In 1845, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He died at Portici, near Naples, of cholera, aged 56.

==Work==
Melloni&#x27;s reputation as a physicist rests principally on his discoveries in radiant heat, made with the aid of the &quot;thermomultiplier&quot;, a combination of thermopile and galvanometer. In 1831, soon after the discovery of thermoelectricity by Thomas Johann Seebeck, he and Leopoldo Nobili employed the instrument in experiments especially concerned with characteristics of (in modern language) black-body radiation transmitted by various materials.

He used an optical bench fitted with thermopiles, shields and light and heat sources, such as Locatelli&#x27;s lamp and Leslie&#x27;s cube, in order to show that radiant heat could be reflected, refracted and polarised in the same way as light.

His most important book, &quot;La thermocrose au la coloration calorifique&quot; (Vol. I., Naples, 1850), was unfinished at his death.

He also studied the magnetism of rocks, electrostatic induction and photography.

==Honours==
*Rumford Medal of the Royal Society (1834);
*Correspondent of the Académie des Sciences (1835);
*Foreign member of the Royal Society, (1839).

<doc id="929452" wikidata="Q4660407" url="?curid=929452" title="A Very British Coup">
<text>A Very British Coup is a 1982 novel by British Labour politician Chris Mullin. The novel has twice been adapted for television; as &quot;A Very British Coup&quot; in 1988 and as &quot;Secret State&quot; in 2012.

==Plot==
Harry Perkins is the left-wing Leader of the Labour Party and Member of Parliament for Sheffield Central. Beating all the odds, Harry becomes Prime Minister following a landslide victory in the 1989 general election, and sets out to dismantle media monopolies, establish Britain as a neutral country through withdrawal from NATO, the removal of American military bases from British soil and unilateral nuclear disarmament, achieve public control of finances, revive manufacturing by withdrawing from the Common Market and imposing import controls, and create an open government. Many people in the media, financial services, and the intelligence services are deeply unhappy with Harry&#x27;s win and his policies, and they unite with the United States government to stop him by any means. Shortly after entering office, Perkins hires &quot;Independent Socialist&quot; journalist Fred Thompson as an aide to answer his letters and to keep an eye on the Civil Service at the Cabinet Office.

After Perkins undiplomatically rejects the pleas of the US Secretary of State to reconsider his defence policies, a run on pound sterling and a resultant balance of payments crisis are engineered to discredit him, with the US and other NATO members refusing to offer standby credit. The International Monetary Fund offers to grant Britain a loan only on the condition of cutting public spending by £10,000,000,000 (approximately £24,000,000,000 in 2022) over two years. Foreign Secretary Tom Newsome, feigning illness, embarks on a secret tour of Algeria, Libya and Iraq, securing £10,000,000,000 in standby credit in support of Labour&#x27;s policies of the removal of American military bases and the creation of a Palestinian homeland. In retaliation, DI5 reports Newsome&#x27;s affair with Maureen Jackson, a young member of the Hampstead Labour Party, to Perkins. Although Perkins is reluctant to accept Newsome&#x27;s resignation, he is left with no choice after the story is reported in the newspapers, implying a security threat due to Maureen&#x27;s flatmate being a member of the Workers&#x27; Revolutionary Party. Following his resignation, Newsome returns home to find his wife having committed suicide by overdosing.

Reg Smith, the Secretary of the United Power Workers&#x27; Union, calls for a work-to-rule by power workers in protest against the Perkins ministry&#x27;s proposed ten per cent pay increase for workers, obstensibly hoping to secure a fifty per cent increase and extra holiday time. Smith is an asset of American intelligence, having secured his loyalty through paid lecture tours, and is opposed to Perkins&#x27; policies of abolishing the House of Lords and the honours system due to his personal desire for a peerage. With newspaper magnate Sir George Fison and BBC editor Jonathan Alford, amongst others, ensuring media support for Smith&#x27;s case (which they depict as comparable to Lech Wałęsa&#x27;s and Solidarity&#x27;s), the resultant blackouts and Perkins&#x27; refusal to deploy soldiers as strike-breakers seriously damages the government&#x27;s approval rating. Smith calls off the work-to-rule once enthusiasm amongst his members wains.

At a Chequers conference held to discuss Perkins&#x27; defence policies, the General Staff attempt to misinform the Perkins Cabinet about the extent to which nuclear disarmament and the removal of American bases could be achieved, and the military capabilities of NATO and the Warsaw Pact. The only civil servant supportive of Perkins&#x27; policies is Sir Montague Kowalski, Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence. At this conference, Home Secretary Joan Cook overhears Chancellor of the Exchequer Lawrence Wainwright conspiring with Sir Peregrine Craddock, the Director General of DI5. Conspiratorial opposition to Perkins&#x27; defence policies also includes Smith&#x27;s creation of Trade Unions for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament (TUM), aggressive media campaigns accusing Perkins of leaving Britain defenceless against Soviet invasion, and the organisation of civil disruption by police at a Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament demonstration at which Perkins himself was speaking.

Perkins&#x27; premiership is brought to an end by an accident at the experimental Windermere nuclear power station, which threatened to contaminate an area including Blackpool and Liverpool with radiation. Although Perkins approved the station as Secretary of State for the Public Sector to save British manufacturing jobs, DI5 utilise Perkins&#x27; affair with Molly Spence, then the mistress and now the wife of Michael Jarvis, the managing director of British Insulated, the firm which built Windermere&#x27;s reactors, to imply that his support had been bought. Believing that Molly was threatening to leak the story, Perkins&#x27; agrees to DI5&#x27;s recommendation that he resign on grounds of ill health.

Following Perkins&#x27; resignation, a disputed leadership selection process results in Wainwright being elected leader by a majority of Labour MPs and Leader of the Commons Jock Steeples being selected as leader by Labour&#x27;s National Executive Committee. With the King appointing the former as Prime Minister on the advice of DI5, Wainwright replaces the entire Cabinet and abandons most of Perkins&#x27; policies, much to the jubilation of the conspirators who cheer their achievement of &#x27;a very British coup&#x27;.

The epilogue reveals that Perkins, Cook, and Steeples would never hold government office again, that Sir Peregrine quietly retired, that Fison and Smith both received peerages, and that Thompson married his aristocratic girlfriend Elizabeth Fain, moved to Scotland, and started writing a (likely to be unpublished) book about what really happened to Perkins&#x27; premiership.

==Analysis==
The book was written in 1981, at a time when Tony Benn looked likely to become deputy leader of the Labour Party which at the time was strongly challenging the government of Margaret Thatcher in the opinion polls. It also has strong echoes of the persistent rumours that have circulated over the years about attempts by members of the British security services, and other wings of the British Establishment, to undermine and depose Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government of the mid-1970s. This first became widespread public knowledge around 1986 with the controversy over &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, after the publication of the novel but before the broadcast of the TV version. The story also has echoes of the 1975 Australian constitutional crisis in which there was alleged CIA involvement to remove a government proposing to close US military bases on Australian soil.

Some editions of the book include a quote by Peregrine Worsthorne from his article &quot;When Treason Can Be Right&quot;, which argues that treason to defend the UK&#x27;s alliance with the USA would be justified. This indicates the choice of name for Sir Peregrine, the chief conspirator in the novel.

==Editions==
The novel was published by Serpent&#x27;s Tail, and was re-released in 2010. Subsequent reprints have been credited by Mullin to the appointment of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader in 2015.

==Sequel==
In 2015 Mullin revealed that he was working on a sequel, which was published in March 2019 under the title &quot;The Friends of Harry Perkins&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The novel has twice been adapted for television.

===&quot;A Very British Coup&quot; (1988)===

The first version, also titled &quot;A Very British Coup&quot;, was adapted in 1988 by screenwriter Alan Plater and starred Ray McAnally.

===&quot;Secret State&quot; (2012)===

The 2012 four-part Channel 4 series, &quot;Secret State&quot;, was &quot;inspired&quot; by the same novel. Starring Gabriel Byrne, this version was written by Robert Jones.

<text>York North was a federal riding in Ontario, Canada, that was in the House of Commons of Canada from Confederation in 1867 until 2004.

The federal riding was eliminated in 2003 when it was redistributed between two new ridings of Newmarket—Aurora and York—Simcoe. Another small section was incorporated into Oak Ridges—Markham. The riding covered the northern suburbs of the city of Toronto often including such towns as Aurora, Vaughan, Newmarket, Richmond Hill and Markham. The borders changed often, however, most notably in 1996 when the riding was so altered that it contained very little of the same territory as before.

==Evolution of the riding==

The British North America Act, 1867 designated the electoral districts to be used in elected the members of the House of Commons. By virtue of the size of its population, the County of York was divided into a number of ridings, instead of being allocated one seat in the House of Commons like many other counties. The initial boundaries of the North Riding of York were defined in 1859 to consist of the Township of King, Whitchurch, Georgina, East Gwillimbury and North Gwillimbury, and the villages of Aurora, Newmarket and Holland Landing. Over time, the boundaries were adjusted as the City of Toronto expanded, and as the population of the area grew.

In 1882, the riding was redefined to consist of the townships of King, East Gwillimbury, West Gwillimbury, North Gwillimbury and Georgina, and the villages of Holland Landing, Bradford and Aurora.

In 1903, the north riding was redefined to consist of the townships of Georgina, East Gwillimbury, North Gwillimbury, King, and Whitchurch, the towns of Aurora and Newmarket, and the villages of Holland Landing, Stouffville and Sutton.

In 1924, York North was defined as consisting of all that part of the county of York north of the southerly boundary of the townships of Vaughan and Markham. In 1933, its boundary was the townships of North York and Whitchurch, excluding the village of Stouffville. In 1947, it was redefined to consist of that part of the county of York lying north of the line being the southerly boundary of the township of North York, Yonge Street and the southerly boundary of the township of Markham.

In 1952, it was defined as consisting of that part of the county of York lying north of Highway 7, excluding the town of Woodbridge.

In 1966, it was defined as consisting of a north-central section of the Borough of North York in Metropolitan Toronto, the Town of Richmond Hill, the Township of Markham excluding the Village of Stouffville, and part of the Township of Vaughan.

In 1976, it was redefined to consist of the Towns of Markham, Richmond Hill and Vaughan in the Regional Municipality of York. In 1987, it was redefined to consist of the towns of Aurora, Richmond Hill and Vaughan, and the southern part of the Township of King.

In 1996, it was redefined to consist of the towns of East Gwillimbury, Georgina, and Newmarket, as well as the part of King north of Side Road 18, shedding a portion to create the new riding of Thornhill.

The electoral district was abolished in 2003 when it was redistributed between the electoral districts of Newmarket—Aurora, Oak Ridges—Markham and York—Simcoe.

<text>The Suffolk Horse, also historically known as the Suffolk Punch or Suffolk Sorrel, is an English breed of draught horse. The first part of the name is from the county of Suffolk in East Anglia, and the word &quot;punch&quot; is an old English word for a short stout person. It is a heavy draught horse which is always chestnut in colour. Suffolk Punches are known as good doers, and tend to have energetic gaits.

The breed was developed in the early 16th century, and remains similar in phenotype to its founding stock. The Suffolk Punch was developed for farm work, and gained popularity during the early 20th century. However, as agriculture became increasingly mechanised, the breed fell out of favour, particularly from the middle part of the century, and almost disappeared completely. The breed&#x27;s status is listed as critical by the UK Rare Breeds Survival Trust and The Livestock Conservancy. The breed pulled artillery and non-motorised commercial vans and buses, as well as being used for farm work. It was also exported to other countries to upgrade local equine stock. Today, they are used for draught work, forestry and advertising.

== History ==

The Suffolk Punch registry is the oldest English breed society. The first known mention of the Suffolk Punch is in William Camden&#x27;s &quot;Britannia&quot;, published in 1586, in which he describes a working horse of the eastern counties of England that is easily recognisable as the Suffolk Punch. This description makes them the oldest breed of horse that is recognisable in the same form today. A detailed genetic study shows that the Suffolk Punch is closely genetically grouped not only with the Fell and Dales British ponies, but also with the European Haflinger. They were developed in Norfolk and Suffolk in the east of England, a relatively isolated area. The local farmers developed the Suffolk Punch for farm work, for which they needed a horse with power, stamina, health, longevity, and docility, and they bred the Suffolk to comply with these needs. Because the farmers used these horses on their land, they seldom had any to sell, which helped to keep the bloodlines pure and unchanged.
The foundation sire of the modern Suffolk Punch breed was a stallion foaled near Woodbridge in 1768 and owned by Thomas Crisp of Ufford. At this time, the breed was known as the Suffolk Sorrel. This horse was never named, and is simply known as &quot;Crisp&#x27;s horse&quot;. Although it is commonly (and mistakenly) thought that this was the first horse of the breed, by the 1760s, all other male lines of the breed had died out, resulting in a genetic bottleneck. Another bottleneck occurred in the late 18th century.

In his &quot;History and Antiquities of Hawsted, in the County of Suffolk&quot; of 1784, Sir John Cullum describes the Suffolk Punch as &quot;... generally about 15 hands high, of a remarkably short and compact make; their legs bony; and their shoulders loaded with flesh. Their colour is often of a light sorrel&quot;. During its development, the breed was influenced by the Norfolk Trotter, Norfolk Cob, and later the Thoroughbred. The uniform colouring derives in part from a small trotting stallion named Blakes Farmer, foaled in 1760. Other breeds were crossbred in an attempt to increase the size and stature of the Suffolk Punch, as well as to improve the shoulders, but they had little lasting influence, and the breed remains much as it was before any crossbreeding took place. The Suffolk Horse Society, formed in Britain in 1877 to promote the Suffolk Punch, published its first stud book in 1880. The first official exports of Suffolks to Canada took place in 1865. In 1880, the first Suffolks were imported into the United States, with more following in 1888 and 1903 to begin the breeding of Suffolk Punches in the US. The American Suffolk Horse Association was established and published its first stud book in 1907. By 1908, the Suffolk had also been exported from England to Spain, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Sweden, various parts of Africa, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina and other countries.

By the time of the First World War, the Suffolk Punch had become a popular workhorse on large farms in East Anglia due to its good temperament and excellent work ethic. It remained popular until the Second World War, when a combination of the need for increased wartime food production (which resulted in many horses being sent to the slaughterhouse), and increased farm mechanisation which followed the war-decimated population numbers. Only nine foals were registered with the Suffolk Horse Society in 1966, but a revival of interest in the breed has occurred since the late 1960s, and numbers have risen continuously. The breed did remain rare, and in 1998, only 80 breeding mares were in Britain, producing around 40 foals per year. In the United States, the American Suffolk Horse Association became inactive after the war and remained so for 15 years, but restarted in May 1961 as the draught-horse market began to recover. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the American registry allowed some Belgians to be bred to Suffolk Punches, but only the fillies from these crosses were permitted registry with the American Suffolk Horse Association.

As of 2001, horses bred with American bloodlines were not allowed to be registered with the British Association, and the breed was considered the rarest horse breed in the United Kingdom. Although the Suffolk Punch population has continued to increase, the Rare Breeds Survival Trust of the UK considers their survival status critical, in 2011, between 800 and 1,200 horses were in the United States and around 150 were in England. The Livestock Conservancy also lists the breed as critical. The Suffolk Horse Society recorded the births of 36 purebred foals in 2007, and a further 33 foals as of March 2008. By 2016, about 300 Suffolk Punches were in the UK with 30 to 40 purebred foals being born annually.

==Characteristics==
Suffolk Punches generally stand , weigh , and are always chestnut in colour. The traditional spelling, still used by the Suffolk Horse Society, is &quot;&quot; (with no &quot;t&quot; in the middle of the word). Horses of the breed come in many different shades of chestnut, ranging from dark to red to light. Suffolk horse breeders in the UK use several different colour terms specific to the breed, including dark liver, dull dark, red, and bright. White markings are rare and generally limited to small areas on the face and lower legs. Equestrian author Marguerite Henry described the breed by saying, &quot;His color is bright chestnut – like a tongue of fire against black field furrows, against green corn blades, against yellow wheat, against blue horizons. Never is he any other color.&quot;

The Suffolk Punch tends to be shorter but more massively built than other British heavy draught breeds, such as the Clydesdale or the Shire, as a result of having been developed for agricultural work rather than road haulage. The breed has a powerful, arching neck; well-muscled, sloping shoulders; a short, wide back; and a muscular, broad croup. Legs are short and strong, with broad joints; sound, well-formed hooves; and little or no feathering on the fetlocks. The movement of the Suffolk Punch is said to be energetic, especially at the trot. The breed tends to mature early and be long-lived, and is economical to keep, needing less feed than other horses of similar type and size. They are hard workers, said to be willing to &quot;pull a heavily laden wagon till [they] dropped.&quot;

In the past, the Suffolk was often criticised for its poor feet, having hooves that were too small for its body mass. This was corrected by the introduction of classes at major shows in which hoof conformation and structure were judged. This practice, unique among horse breeds, resulted in such an improvement that the Suffolk Punch is now considered to have excellent foot conformation.

==Uses==

The Suffolk Punch was used mainly for draught work on farms but was also often used to pull heavy artillery in wartime. Like other heavy horses, they were also used to pull non-motorised vans and other commercial vehicles. Today, they are used for commercial forestry operations, for other draught work, and in advertising. They are also used for crossbreeding, to produce heavy sport horses for use in hunter and show jumping competition. As a symbol of the county in which they are based, Ipswich Town F.C. incorporate a Suffolk Punch as a dominant part of their team crest.

The Suffolk Punch contributed significantly to the creation of the Jutland breed in Denmark. Oppenheimer LXII, a Suffolk Punch imported to Denmark in the 1860s by noted Suffolk dealer Oppenheimer of Hamburg, was one of the founding stallions of the Jutland. Oppenheimer specialised in selling Suffolk Punches, importing them to the Mecklenburg Stud in Germany. The stallion Oppenheimer founded the Jutland breed&#x27;s most important bloodline, through his descendant Oldrup Munkedal. Suffolks were also exported to Pakistan in the 20th century, to be used in upgrading native breeds, and they have been crossed with Pakistani horses and donkeys to create army remounts and mules. Suffolks have adapted well to the Pakistani climate, despite their large size, and the programme has been successful. The Vladimir Heavy Draft, a draught breed from the former USSR, is another which has been influenced by the Suffolk.

<text>My Morning Jacket is an American rock band formed in Louisville, Kentucky, in 1998. The band consists of vocalist/guitarist Jim James, bassist Tom Blankenship, drummer Patrick Hallahan, guitarist Carl Broemel, and keyboardist Bo Koster. The band&#x27;s sound, rooted in rock and country, is often experimental and psychedelic. The group amassed a following beginning in the 2000s in part due to their live performances.

The group first found success in Europe after the release of its debut album, &quot;The Tennessee Fire&quot; (1999). Its next release, &quot;At Dawn&quot; (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label ATO Records, the group released two albums, &quot;It Still Moves&quot; (2003) and &quot;Z&quot; (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. The group&#x27;s next release, &quot;Evil Urges&quot; (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while &quot;Circuital&quot; (2011), its sixth album, saw a more measured response. The band&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;The Waterfall&quot;, was released in 2015, followed by &quot;The Waterfall II&quot; in 2020 and &quot;My Morning Jacket&quot; in 2021.

==History==

===Formation and debut releases (1998–2000)===
My Morning Jacket was formed in Louisville, Kentucky in 1998 by singer-songwriter Jim James. James created the group as an outlet for acoustic songs he had developed on his own that his band at the time, Month of Sundays, could not use. The group&#x27;s first lineup included his cousin, Johnny Quaid (guitar), Tom Blankenship (bass), and J. Glenn on drums, all formerly of Shelbyville-based emo-punk band Winter Death Club. The band&#x27;s name stems from James, who once found a discarded coat with the emblazoned letters MMJ.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Tennessee Fire&quot;, was released in May 1999. It was mildly successful in the U.S., though it became a surprise hit internationally, particularly in the Netherlands and Belgium. Soon, the group launched a European tour, where it received high marks from Dutch and Belgian press; the group also appeared in the Dutch documentary, &quot;This is NOT America&quot;. Danny Cash joined the band as keyboardist in 2000.

===Early years and breakthrough (2001–2007)===
The band&#x27;s second effort, &quot;At Dawn&quot; (2001), helped grow the group&#x27;s fanbase in its home country. For the album, James recorded his vocals in a grain silo, creating a sound heavy on echo that became a hallmark of the band&#x27;s early releases. Subsequently, drummer J. Glenn left the band, and was briefly replaced by Chris Guetig. Patrick Hallahan, James&#x27; childhood best friend, replaced Guetig. In the early 2000s, the band toured heavily, often supporting bands such as Guided by Voices, Doves, and Foo Fighters. The group signed to independent label ATO Records in 2002 ahead of its third album, &quot;It Still Moves&quot;, which saw release in September 2003 to wide acclaim. In January 2004, Cash and Quaid announced their departure from the group; they were replaced by keyboardist Bo Koster and guitarist Carl Broemel.

&quot;Z&quot;, released in 2005, became the group&#x27;s breakthrough album. It received positive critical reviews; in his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, critic David Fricke wrote, &quot;America is a lot closer to getting its own Radiohead, and it isn&#x27;t Wilco&quot;. The album was noticeable for a break from James&#x27; heavily reverbed vocals, and featured experimentation with dub, reggae and psychedelic rock. &quot;Okonokos&quot;, a live album captured while the band toured &quot;Z&quot;, was released in 2006.
===Shift in sound (2008–2013)===
The band&#x27;s next release, &quot;Evil Urges&quot;, marked a considerable shift in their sound, and it received polarizing reactions from fans and critics. Many songs on the album developed on 90-minute walks James would embark on in Louisville. Its lyrics centered on a relationship that fell apart shortly before recording. To promote the album, the band appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. The band toured in support of the record that summer, which included a storied appearance at Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee. The band, beginning at midnight, performed for four hours in the rain. Unfazed by a torrential downpour for much of its first half, the band&#x27;s set went on to feature thirty-five songs, including all but two tracks from &quot;Evil Urges&quot; and numerous covers, and featured a guest appearance from Kirk Hammett of Metallica. The set has commonly been regarded among the band&#x27;s personal best and one of the best in the history of the festival. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it &quot;career-defining.&quot; &quot;Evil Urges&quot; was nominated for a Grammy for Best Alternative Rock Album. My Morning Jacket performed before a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden in New York. 

The band members appeared as themselves in the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode, &quot;My Morning Straitjacket&quot;, which aired on November 22, 2009. The episode is based on American Dad! co-creator Mike Barker&#x27;s &quot;life-changing experience&quot; at the band&#x27;s 2008 Bonnaroo performance.

In 2010, My Morning Jacket took up residency at New York&#x27;s Terminal 5 on October 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23, performing one of its five studio releases each night along with additional material from the relevant period. According to the September 16, 2010 issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, My Morning Jacket started working on its next LP. &quot;We&#x27;ve got five songs done,&quot; says front man Jim James. &quot;It&#x27;ll probably be out next spring.&quot; James co-produced the record with The Decemberists collaborator Tucker Martine in an old church in My Morning Jacket&#x27;s hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. &quot;We&#x27;re trying to do everything but the strings live,&quot; said James. &quot;There&#x27;s something old and dirty-sounding about it.&quot; The band&#x27;s sixth album &quot;Circuital&quot; was released on May 31, 2011. The band toured for two years in support of &quot;Circuital&quot;. In 2013, it embarked on a tour alongside Wilco and Bob Dylan that left band members disappointed, as they had falsely been told Dylan desired to work with them.

===Recent events (2014–present)===
While the band took a break, James stayed busy, touring behind his solo album, &quot;Regions of Light and Sound of God&quot;, and collaborating with Elvis Costello and Marcus Mumford for the New Basement Tapes project. These individual side projects, rather than detach the musicians, worked to strengthen band members&#x27; skill as musicians, according to Blankenship. This led to a greater appreciation of the group upon their return to it. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Waterfall&quot;, was mainly recorded at a hilltop mansion above Stinson Beach in Marin County, California. The band felt the surroundings were &quot;slightly supernatural,&quot; which produced a largely idyllic recording process. &quot;The Waterfall&quot; was released in May 2015, debuting number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the U.S., with 33,000 copies sold in its first week. In December 2015, &quot;The Waterfall&quot; was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.

The sessions for &quot;The Waterfall&quot; were fruitful, producing over 24 completed songs, enough to fill two albums. MMJ took most of 2018 and the early part of 2019 off from touring, but regrouped for select shows in August 2019. James described the shows as among his favorite recent MMJ performances and says the group worked through some of their personal issues in advance of the shows. The members of My Morning Jacket admitted that they were not sure if they were ever going to reunite for a period of time during their extended break.

&quot;The Waterfall II&quot; was released on July 10, 2020. The band contributed a cover of the Metallica song &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; to the charity tribute album &quot;The Metallica Blacklist,&quot; released in September 2021. The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, the self-titled &quot;My Morning Jacket&quot;, was released on October 22, 2021. Its first single, &quot;Regularly Scheduled Programming&quot;, debuted on August 24 along with an accompanying music video. On November 24, 2023, they released their first Christmas LP &quot;Happy Holiday!&quot;.

In March 2024, the band announced that they would do an East Coast tour with Nathaniel Rateliff that fall. While on tour, the band released a single titled &quot;Aren’t We One?&quot; which they performed live on tour and would be part of an upcoming album.

<text>Aleksandr Gelyevich Dugin (; born 7 January 1962) is a Russian far-right political philosopher and the leading theorist of Russian neo-Eurasianism.

Born into a military intelligence family, Dugin was an anti-communist dissident during the 1980s and joined the ultranationalist and antisemitic Pamyat organization. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, he co-founded the National Bolshevik Party, which espoused National Bolshevism, with Eduard Limonov in 1993 before leaving in 1998. In 1997, Dugin published his most well-known work, &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot;, in which he called on Russia to rebuild its influence through alliances and conquest in order to challenge a purported rival Atlanticist empire led by the United States. Dugin founded the Eurasia Party in 2002, and continued to develop his ideology in books including &quot;The Fourth Political Theory&quot; (2009). His views have been characterized as fascist or neo-fascist, although he explicitly rejects fascism along with liberal democracy and Marxism, instead advocating a &quot;conservative revolution&quot; against Enlightenment ideas in Russia. He has drawn on the writings of René Guénon, Julius Evola, Carl Schmitt, and Martin Heidegger.

Dugin was an early advisor to the Communist Party of the Russian Federation and later to Chairmen of the State Duma Gennadiy Seleznyov and Sergey Naryshkin. He served as head of the Department of Sociology of International Relations at Moscow State University from 2009 to 2014, when he lost his post due to backlash after he called for the death of pro-Maidan Ukrainians. Since 2023, he has served as the director of the Ivan Ilyin Higher School of Politics at the Russian State University for the Humanities.

Dugin is a strong supporter of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Although he has no official ties to the Kremlin, he is often referred to in foreign media as &quot;Putin&#x27;s brain&quot;; others say that his influence is exaggerated. Dugin vocally supported the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, and since 2022 has supported its full invasion of Ukraine as representing a battle against &quot;absolute Evil, embodied in Western civilisation, its liberal-totalitarian hegemony and in Ukrainian Nazism&quot;. Dugin&#x27;s daughter, Darya, was assassinated in car bombing in 2022. The assassination is widely believed to have been conducted by Ukraine, though the exact relation of the assassins to the Ukrainian government is undetermined.

==Early life and education==
Dugin was born in Moscow, into the family of a colonel-general in the GRU, a Soviet military intelligence agency, and candidate of law, Geliy Aleksandrovich Dugin, and his wife Galina, a doctor and candidate of medicine. His father left the family when he was three, but ensured that they had a good standard of living, and helped Dugin out of trouble with the authorities on occasion. He was transferred to the customs service due to his son&#x27;s behaviour in 1983.

In 1979, Aleksandr entered the Moscow Aviation Institute. He was expelled without a degree either because of low academic achievement, dissident activities or both. Afterwards, he began working as a street cleaner. He used a forged reader&#x27;s card to access the Lenin Library and continue studying. However, other sources claim he instead started working in a KGB archive, where he had access to banned literature on Masonry, fascism, and paganism.

In 1980, Dugin joined the &quot;&quot;, an avant-garde dissident group which dabbled in Satanism, esoteric Nazism and other forms of the occult. The Yuzhinsky circle gained a reputation for Satanism, for séances, a devotion to all things esoteric – mysticism, hypnotism, Ouija boards, Sufism, trances, pentagrams and so forth. In the group, he was known for his embrace of Nazism which he attributes to a rebellion against his Soviet upbringing, as opposed to genuine sympathy for Hitler. He adopted an alter ego with the name of &quot;Hans Sievers&quot;, a reference to Wolfram Sievers, a Nazi researcher of the paranormal.

Studying by himself, he learned to speak Italian, German, French, English, and Spanish. He was influenced by René Guénon and by the Traditionalist School. In the Lenin Library, he discovered the writings of Julius Evola, whose book &quot;Pagan Imperialism&quot; he translated into Russian.

==Career and political views==


=== Early activism ===
In the 1980s, Dugin was a dissident and an anti-communist. Dugin worked as a journalist before becoming involved in politics just before the fall of communism. In 1988, he and his friend Geydar Dzhemal joined the ultranationalist and antisemitic group Pamyat (Memory), which would later give rise to Russian fascism. For a brief period at the beginning of the 1990s he was close to Gennady Zyuganov, leader of the newly formed Communist Party of the Russian Federation, and probably had a role in formulating its nationalist communist ideology. In 1993 he co-founded, together with Eduard Limonov, the National Bolshevik Party, whose nationalistic interpretation of Bolshevism was based on the ideas of Ernst Niekisch. He left the party in 1998 following disputes with Limonov.

=== Publishing career ===
Dugin published &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot; in 1997. The book was published in multiple editions, and is used in university courses on geopolitics, reportedly including the Academy of the General Staff of the Russian military. It alarmed political scientists in the US, and is sometimes referenced by them as being &quot;Russia&#x27;s Manifest Destiny&quot;. In 1997, his article, &quot;Fascism – Borderless and Red&quot;, described &quot;national capitalism&quot; as pre-empting the development of a &quot;genuine, true, radically revolutionary and consistent, fascist fascism&quot; in Russia. He believes that it was &quot;by no means the racist and chauvinist aspects of National Socialism that determined the nature of its ideology. The excesses of this ideology in Germany are a matter exclusively of the Germans... while Russian fascism is a combination of natural national conservatism with a passionate desire for true changes.&quot; The &quot;Waffen-SS and especially the scientific sector of this organization, Ahnenerbe,&quot; was &quot;an intellectual oasis in the framework of the National Socialist regime&quot;, according to him.

Dugin soon began publishing his own journal entitled &quot;Elementy&quot;, which initially began by praising Franco-Belgian Jean-François Thiriart, belatedly a supporter of a &quot;Euro-Soviet empire which would stretch from Dublin to Vladivostok and would also need to expand to the south, since it require(s) a port on the Indian Ocean.&quot; Consistently glorifying both Tsarist and Stalinist Soviet Russia, &quot;Elementy&quot; also indicated his admiration for Julius Evola. Dugin also collaborated with the weekly journal &quot;Den&quot; (The Day), previously directed by Alexander Prokhanov. In the journal he obtained the last interview of the Belgian Nazi collaborator Leon Degrelle six months before his death.

=== Ideology ===

Dugin disapproves of liberalism and the West, particularly US hegemony. He asserts: &quot;We are on the side of Stalin and the Soviet Union&quot;. He describes himself as being a conservative: &quot;We, conservatives, want a strong, solid state, want order and healthy family, positive values, the reinforcing of the importance of religion and the Church in society&quot;. He adds: &quot;We want patriotic radio, TV, patriotic experts, patriotic clubs. We want the media that expresses national interests&quot;.

According to political scientist Marlène Laruelle, the thinking of Dugin, main manufacturer of a fascism &quot;à-la-russe&quot;, could be described as a series of concentric circles, with far-right ideologies underpinned by different political and philosophical traditions (Esoteric Nazism, Traditionalism/Perennialism, the German Conservative Revolution and the European New Right) at its backbone.

Dugin adapts Martin Heidegger&#x27;s notion of &quot;Dasein&quot; (Existence) and transforms it into a geo–philosophical concept. According to Dugin, the forces of liberal and capitalist Western civilization represent what the ancient Greeks called &quot;ὕβρις&quot; (hubris), &quot;the essential form of titanism&quot; (the anti-ideal form), which opposes Heaven (&quot;the ideal form—in terms of space, time, being&quot;). In other words, the West would summarize &quot;the revolt of the Earth against Heaven&quot;. To what he calls the West&#x27;s &quot;atomizing&quot; universalism, Dugin contrasts an apophatic universalism, expressed in the political idea of &quot;empire&quot;. Values of democracy, human rights and individualism are considered by him not to be universal but uniquely Western.

In 2019, Dugin engaged in a debate with French intellectual Bernard-Henri Lévy on the theme of what has been called &quot;the crisis of capitalism&quot; and the insurrection of nationalist populisms.

====Eurasianism, and views on geopolitics====
Dugin has theorized the foundation of a &quot;Euro-Asian empire&quot; capable of fighting the US-led Western world. In this regard, he was the organizer and the first leader of the ultranationalist National Bolshevik Party from 1993 to 1998 (along with Eduard Limonov) and, subsequently, of the National Bolshevik Front and of the Eurasia Party, which then became a non-governmental association. Dugin&#x27;s Eurasitic ideology therefore aims at the unification of all Russian-speaking peoples in a single country. His views have been characterised as Fascist by some critics.

In the early 1990s, Dugin&#x27;s work at the National Bolshevik Front included research into the roots of national movements and the activities of supporting esoteric groups in the first half of the 20th century. Partnering with Christian Bouchet, a then-member of the French branch of Ordo Templi Orientis, and building on Nationalist and migratory-integrative interest groups in Asia and Europe, they contribute in bringing international politics closer to Russia&#x27;s Eurasian geopolitical concept.

Dugin spent two years studying the geopolitical, semiotic and esoteric theories of the controversial Dutch thinker Herman Wirth (1885–1981), one of the founders of the German Ahnenerbe. This resulted in the book &quot;Hyperborean Theory&quot; (1993), in which Dugin largely endorsed Wirth&#x27;s ideas as a possible foundation for his Eurasianism. Apparently, this is &quot;one of the most extensive summaries and treatments of Wirth in any language&quot;. According to the Moldovan anthropologist Leonid Mosionjnik, Wirth&#x27;s overtly wild ideas fitted perfectly well in the ideological void after the demise of communism, liberalism and democracy. Dugin also promoted Wirth&#x27;s claim to have written a book on the history of the Jewish People and the Old Testament, the so-called &quot;Palestinabuch&quot;, which could have changed the world had it not been stolen.

At the end of the Second Chechen War, Dugin was apparently requested by the Chechen side to come and negotiate, in addition he has met with the former president of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the ambassadors of Iran and Syria.

Dugin&#x27;s ideas, particularly those on &quot;a Turkic–Slavic alliance in the Eurasian sphere&quot;, have begun to receive attention among certain nationalistic circles in Turkey, most notably among alleged members of the Ergenekon network, which is the subject of a high-profile trial (on charges of conspiracy). Dugin&#x27;s Eurasianist ideology has also been linked to his adherence to the doctrines of the Traditionalist School. (Dugin&#x27;s Traditionalist beliefs are the subject of a book length study by J. Heiser, &quot;The American Empire Should Be Destroyed—Aleksandr Dugin and the Perils of Immanentized Eschatology.&quot;) Dugin also advocates for a Russo-Arab alliance.

The reborn Russia, according to Dugin&#x27;s concept, is said by Charles Clover of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; to be a slightly remade version of the Soviet Union with echoes of &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; by George Orwell, where Eurasia was one of three continent-sized super states including Eastasia and Oceania as the other two and was participating in endless war between them. In the Eurasian public discourse sphere, the totalitarian communist policy deployed in over three decades of works by various international groups that are part of the movement, is &quot;a version of reintegration of the post-Soviet space into a &#x27;Eurasian&#x27; sphere of influence for Russia&quot;. The North American program &quot;works with a wide range of partners from all sectors of civil society&quot; and &quot;is advanced through grant making, advocacy and research, regional initiatives, and close engagement&quot;.

The Kremlin invited Dugin to speak at its Anti-Orange Rally in Moscow in February 2012. There, Dugin addressed tens of thousands with this message:

====Russian Orthodoxy and Rodnovery====
Dugin was baptized at the age of six in the Russian Orthodox church of Michurinsk by his great-grandmother Elena Mikhailovna Kargaltseva. Since 1999, he formally embraced a branch of the Old Believers, a Russian religious movement which rejected the 1652–1666 reforms of the official Russian Orthodox Church. Dugin&#x27;s Eurasian philosophy owes much to Traditional Integralism and &quot;Nouvelle Droite&quot; movements, and as such it resonates with Neopaganism, a category which in this context means the movement of Slavic Native Faith (Rodnovery), especially in the forms of Anastasianism and Ynglism.

Dugin&#x27;s Eurasianism is often cited as belonging to the same spectrum of these movements, as well as also having influences from Hermetic, Gnostic and Eastern traditions. He calls to rely upon &quot;Eastern theology and mystical currents&quot; for the development of the Fourth Political Theory.

According to Marlene Laruelle, Dugin&#x27;s adherence to the Old Believers allows him to stand between Paganism and Orthodox Christianity without formally adopting either of them. His choice is not paradoxical, since, according to him—in the wake of René Guénon—Russian Orthodoxy and especially the Old Believers have preserved an esoteric and initiatory character which was utterly lost in Western Christianity. As such, the Russian Orthodox tradition may be merged with Neopaganism and may host &quot;Neopaganism&#x27;s nationalist force, which anchors it in the Russian soil, and separates it from the two other Christian confessions&quot;.

====Other views====
In &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot;, Dugin advocated for the dismantling of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, with Xinjiang, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Manchuria becoming buffer states.

Dugin wrote a 1997 essay in which he described Soviet-era serial killer Andrei Chikatilo as a mystic and &quot;a practitioner of Dionysian &quot;sacraments&quot; in which the killer/torturer and the victim transcend their &quot;metaphysical dualism&quot; and become one&quot;.

Psychopathological analysis of some of the Dugin&#x27;s texts: 

=== Political parties ===

==== National Bolshevik Party ====
In 1992, Eduard Limonov founded the National Bolshevik Front (NBF) as an amalgamation of six minor groups. Aleksandr Dugin was among its earliest members and was instrumental in convincing Limonov to enter politics, and signed the declaration of the founding of the party in 1993. The party first attracted attention in 1992 when two members were arrested for possessing grenades. The incident gave the NBP publicity for a boycott campaign they were organizing against Western goods.

The NBF joined forces with the National Salvation Front (a broad coalition of Russian communists and nationalists). In 1998, Dugin left the NBP as a result of a conflict with other members of the party. This led to the party moving further left in Russia&#x27;s political spectrum, and led to members of the party denouncing Dugin and his group as fascists.

====Eurasia Party====
The Eurasia Party, which advances neo-Eurasianist ideas, was launched in April 2001. Dugin was reported as the group&#x27;s founder. He said the movement would stress cultural diversity in Russian politics, and oppose &quot;American style globalisation, and would also resist a return to communism and nationalism.&quot; It was officially recognized by the Ministry of Justice on 31 May 2001. The Eurasia Party claims support in some military circles and by leaders of the Orthodox Christian faith in Russia. The party hopes to play a key role in attempts to resolve the Chechen problem, setting the stage for Dugin&#x27;s objective of a Russian strategic alliance with European and Middle Eastern states, primarily Iran.

In 2005, Dugin founded the Eurasian Youth Union of Russia as the youth wing of the International Eurasia Movement.

===Stance on Ukraine and role in Russian politics===

Dugin supports Russian President Vladimir Putin and his foreign policies but has opposed the Russian government&#x27;s economic policies. He stated in 2007: &quot;There are no more opponents of Putin&#x27;s course and, if there are, they are mentally ill and need to be sent off for clinical examination. Putin is everywhere, Putin is everything, Putin is absolute, and Putin is indispensable&quot;. It was voted number two in flattery by readers of &quot;Kommersant&quot;.

In the Kremlin, Dugin represents the &quot;war party&quot;, a division within the leadership over Ukraine. Dugin is an author of Putin&#x27;s initiative for the annexation of Crimea by Russia. He considered the war between Russia and Ukraine to be inevitable and appealed for Putin to intervene in the war in Donbas. Dugin said: &quot;The Russian Renaissance can only stop at Kyiv.&quot;

During the 2014 pro-Russian conflict in Ukraine, Dugin was in regular contact with pro-Russian separatist insurgents. He described his position as &quot;unconditionally pro-DPR and pro-LPR&quot;. A Skype video call posted on YouTube showed Dugin providing instructions to separatists of South and Eastern Ukraine as well as advising Ekaterina Gubareva, whose husband Pavel Gubarev declared himself the Donetsk Region governor and after that was arrested by the Security Service of Ukraine.

On 31 March 2014, Oleg Bahtiyarov, a member of the Eurasia Youth Union of Russia founded by Dugin, was arrested. He had trained a group of about 200 people to seize parliament and another government building, according to the Security Service of Ukraine.

Dugin stated he was disappointed in President Putin, saying that Putin did not aid the pro-Russian insurgents in Ukraine after the Ukrainian Army&#x27;s early July 2014 offensive. In August 2014, Dugin called for an eradication of Ukrainian identity.

Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group said that the influence of Dugin&#x27;s &quot;Eurasian ideology&quot; on events in eastern Ukraine and on Russia&#x27;s invasion of the Crimea was beyond any doubt. According to Vincent Jauvert, Dugin&#x27;s radical ideology became the basis for the internal and foreign policy of the Russian authorities. &quot;So Dugin is worth listening to, in order to understand to which fate the Kremlin is leading its country and the whole of Europe.&quot;

Ukraine gave Dugin a five-year entry ban, starting in June 2006, and Kyiv declared him a &quot;persona non grata&quot; in 2007. His Eurasian Youth Union was banned in Ukraine. In 2007, the Security Service of Ukraine identified persons of the Eurasian Youth Union who committed vandalism on Hoverla in 2007: they climbed up the mountain of Hoverla, imitated sawing down the details of the construction in the form of the small coat of arms of Ukraine by tools brought with them and painted the emblem of the Eurasian Youth Union on the memorial symbol of the Constitution of Ukraine. He was deported back to Russia when he arrived at Simferopol International Airport in June 2007.

Before war broke out between Russia and Georgia in 2008, Dugin visited South Ossetia and predicted: &quot;Our troops will occupy the Georgian capital Tbilisi, the entire country, and perhaps even Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula, which is historically part of Russia, anyway.&quot; Afterwards he said Russia should &quot;not stop at liberating South Ossetia but should move further,&quot; and &quot;we have to do something similar in Ukraine.&quot; In 2008, Dugin stated that Russia should repeat the Georgian scenario in Ukraine, namely attack it. In September 2008, after the Russian-Georgian war, he did not hide his anger towards Putin, who &quot;dared not drop the other shoe&quot; and &quot;restore the Empire.&quot;

On 10 October 2014, Dugin said, &quot;Only after restoring the Greater Russia that is the Eurasian Union, we can become a credible global player. Now these processes slowed down very much. The Ukrainian maidan was the response of the West to the advance of the Russian integration.&quot; He described the Euromaidan as a coup d&#x27;état carried out by the United States: &quot;America wishes to wage the war against Russia not by its own hands but by the hands of the Ukrainians. Promising to wink at up to 10 thousand victims among the peaceful population of Ukraine and actually demanding the victims, the United States led to this war. The United States carried out the coup d&#x27;état during the maidan for the purpose of this war. The United States raised neo-Nazis Russophobes to the power for the purpose of this war.&quot;

Dugin said Russia is the major driving force for the current events in Ukraine: &quot;Russia insists on its sovereignty, its liberty, responds to challenges thrown down to it, for example, in Ukraine. Russia is attempting to integrate the post-Soviet space.&quot; As Israeli political scientist Vyacheslav Likhachov states, &quot;If one seriously takes the fact that such a person as Alexander Dugin is the ideologist of the imperial dash for the West, then one can establish that Russia is not going to stop as far as the Atlantic Ocean.&quot;

In the 2014 article by Dmitry Bykov &quot;Why TV, Alexander Dugin and Galina Pyshnyak crucified a boy&quot;, Channel One Russia&#x27;s use of the aired story by Dugin and Pyshnyak about the allegedly crucified boy as a pretext for escalating the conflict was compared to the case of Beilis. On 9 July 2014, Dugin on his Facebook account wrote a story that a 6-year-old child was allegedly nailed down to an advertisement board and shot to death before his father&#x27;s eyes.

On 16 July 2014, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; provided a videotape of its correspondent Eugen Feldman walking along the main square in Sloviansk, asking local old women if they had heard of the murder of the child. They said such an event did not take place. The website Change.org hosted a petition of citizens who demanded &quot;a comprehensive investigation with identification for all persons involved in the fabrication of the plot.&quot;

On 2 October 2014, Dugin described the situation in Donbas: &quot;The humanitarian crisis has long since been raging on the territory of Novorossiya. Already up to a million, if not more, refugees are in the Russian Federation. A large part of the inhabitants of the DPR and the LPR simply moved abroad.&quot; In the end of October 2014, Dugin advised the separatists to establish dictatorship in Novorossiya until they win in the confrontation.

==== Influence on Putin ====
Dugin&#x27;s influence on the Russian government and on president Vladimir Putin is disputed. He has no official ties to the Kremlin, but is often referred to in the media as &quot;Putin&#x27;s brain&quot;, and as being responsible for shaping Russian foreign policy. Others contend that Dugin&#x27;s influence is limited and has been greatly exaggerated, on the basis that the correlations between his views and Russian foreign policy do not imply causation.

In 2016, international relations professor Peter Rutland wrote a review of a book by Charles Clover, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;&#x27;s Moscow correspondent. Rutland wrote:&quot;Clover makes it clear that Dugin does not have any sort of direct influence over Putin. Rather what is happening is that Dugin expressed, early on, the zeitgeist of post-Soviet Russia, identifying the forces of disorientation and ressentiment that fueled Putin&#x27;s subsequent actions.&quot;Mark Galeotti, writing in 2022 for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, argued that Western commentators tend to overstate the importance of Dugin in Russian politics, sometimes even describing him as a new Rasputin. He argued that Dugin&#x27;s influence on the politics since 2016 was negligible, but that he tried to present himself as an influential person.

In November 2022, the Latvia-based newspaper &quot;Meduza&quot; reported that, according to sources close to the Kremlin, Dugin&#x27;s influence on Putin had grown after the killing of his daughter Daria Dugina. According to Meduza&#x27;s interlocutors, the Western media had often exaggerated Dugin&#x27;s political influence in the past, but after the murder of Dugina, Putin had allegedly started to take a serious interest in his ideas and to use one of his favourite terms (&quot;Anglo-Saxon&quot;) in a public speech.

Dugin openly criticized Putin for failing to defend &quot;Russian cities&quot; such as Kherson, which was liberated from Russian control on 11 November 2022.

==== Relationships with radical groups in other countries ====
Dugin made contact with the French far-right thinker Alain de Benoist in 1990. Around the same time he also met the Belgian Jean-François Thiriart and Yves Lacoste. In 1992 he invited some of the European far-right figures he had met into Russia. He also brought members of Jobbik and Golden Dawn to Russia to strengthen their ties to the country.

According to the book &quot;War for Eternity&quot; by Benjamin R. Teitelbaum, Dugin met Steve Bannon in Rome in 2018 to discuss Heidegger, Traditionalist esotericism, and a series of geopolitical matters which Bannon disagreed with him, wherein Bannon pressed him to abandon his support for China, Turkey, and Iran. Dugin also developed links with far-right and far-left political parties in the European Union, including Syriza in Greece, Ataka in Bulgaria, the Freedom Party of Austria, and Front National in France, to influence EU policy on Ukraine and Russia. Dugin is also closely aligned with Israeli journalist Avigdor Eskin, who previously served on the board of Dugin&#x27;s Eurasia Party.

===Fifth column===
The typical rhetoric about the fifth column as foreign agents is used by Dugin for political accusations in many publications. In his 2014 interview published by &quot;Vzglyad&quot; and &quot;Komsomolskaya Pravda&quot;, he says, &quot;A huge struggle is being conducted. And, of course, Europe has its own fifth column, its own Bolotnaya Square-minded people. And if we have them sitting idly and doing nasty things on TV Rain, Europe is indeed dominated and ruled by the fifth column in full swing. This is the same American riffraff.&quot;

He sees the United States standing behind all the scenes, including the Russian fifth column. According to his statement, &quot;The danger of our fifth column is not that they are strong, they are absolutely paltry, but that they are hired by the greatest &#x27;godfather&#x27; of the modern world—by the United States. That is why they are effective, they work, they are listened to, they get away with anything because they have the world power standing behind them.&quot; He sees the US embassy as the center for funding and guiding the fifth column and asserts, &quot;We know that the fifth column receives money and instructions from the American embassy.&quot;

According to Dugin, the fifth column promoted the breakup of the Soviet Union as a land continental construction, seized power under Boris Yeltsin, and headed Russia as the ruling politico-economic and cultural elite until the 2000s. The fifth column is the regime of liberal reformers of the 1990s and includes former Russian oligarchs Vladimir Gusinsky, Boris Berezovsky, former government officials Mikhail Kasyanov, Boris Nemtsov, Vladimir Ryzhkov, artistic, cultural, and media workers, the Echo of Moscow, the Russian State University for the Humanities, the highest ranks of the National Research University Higher School of Economics, a significant part of teachers of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and a minority part of teachers of the Moscow State University.

Dugin proposes to deprive the fifth column of Russian citizenship and deport the group from Russia: &quot;I believe it is necessary to deport the fifth column and deprive them of their citizenship.&quot; However, in 2007, Dugin argued, &quot;There are no longer opponents of Putin&#x27;s policy, and if there are, they are mentally ill and should be sent to prophylactic health examination.&quot; In 2014, Dugin in an interview to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; confirmed that he considers the opponents of Putin to be mentally ill.

In one of his publications, Dugin introduced the term &quot;the sixth column&quot; and defined it as &quot;the fifth column which just pretends to be something different&quot;, those who are in favor of Putin, but demand that he stand for liberal values (as opposed to the liberal fifth column, which is specifically against Putin). During the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Dugin said that all the Russian sixth column stood up staunchly for Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov. As he asserts, &quot;We need to struggle against the fifth and sixth columns.&quot;

Russian-American artist Mihail Chemiakin says Dugin is inventing &quot;the sixth column&quot;. &quot;Soon, probably, there would already be the seventh one as well. &#x27;The fifth column&#x27; is understandable. That is we, intelligentsia, lousy, dirty, who read Camus. And &#x27;the sixth column&#x27;, in his opinion, is more dangerous, because that is the personal entourage of Vladimir Putin. But he is naïve and understands nothing. And as for Dugin, he can tell him who to shoot to death and who to imprison. Maybe Kudrin, and maybe Medvedev...&quot;

According to Dugin, the whole Internet should be banned: &quot;I think that Internet as such, as a phenomenon is worth prohibiting because it gives nobody anything good.&quot; In June 2012, Dugin said in a lecture that chemistry and physics are demonic sciences, and that all Orthodox Russians need to unite around the president of Russia in the last battle between good and evil, following the example of Iran and North Korea. He added: &quot;If we want to liberate ourselves from the West, it is needed to liberate ourselves from textbooks on physics and chemistry.&quot;

Dugin has characterized his position on the Ukrainian conflict as &quot;firm opposition to the Junta and Ukrainian Nazism that are annihilating peaceful civilians&quot; as well as rejection of liberalism and US hegemony.

===Loss of departmental headship===
In 2008 Dugin established a Center for Conservative Studies at the Moscow State University. The Center focused on counter-Enlightenment and conservative ideas of authors such as Guénon, Evola, Schmitt and Heidegger, and on their application to Russian politics. In 2014 Dugin lost that academic position due to the controversy following an interview where he commented on the death of 42 anti-Maidan activists in Odesa saying &quot;But what we see on May 2nd is beyond any limits. Kill them, kill them, kill them. There should not be any more conversations. As a professor, I consider it so&quot;. Media outlets interpreted this as a call to kill Ukrainians. A petition entitled &quot;We demand the dismissal of MSU Faculty of Sociology Professor A. G. Dugin!&quot; was signed by over 10,000 people and sent to the MSU rector Viktor Sadovnichiy.

Dugin claimed to have been fired from this post. The university claimed the offer of the position of the department head resulted from a technical error and was therefore cancelled, and that he would remain a professor and deputy department head under contract until September 2014. Dugin wrote the statement of resignation from the faculty staff to be reappointed to the Moscow State University staff due to the offered position of department head, but since the appointment was cancelled he was no longer a staff member of the faculty nor a staff member of the Moscow State University (the two staff memberships are formally different at the MSU).

===Chief editorship of Tsargrad TV===
Dugin was named chief editor of Tsargrad TV by businessman Konstantin Malofeev soon after the TV station&#x27;s founding in 2015.

=== Cooperation with Fudan University ===
After the loss of leadership in Russia, Zhang Weiwei, director of the China Institute of Fudan University, invited Dugin for lectures, which caused a shift in Dugin&#x27;s attitude towards China. Originally advocating &quot;territorial disintegration, division, and political and administrative partition&quot; of China, Dugin has since supported China&#x27;s &quot;Tianxia&quot; and believes that a Russian-Chinese alliance would help counter Atlanticism. Dugin has been appointed as a senior fellow at Fudan University, and Chinese public opinion considers Dugin to be the most important thinker around Putin.

==Personal life==
Dugin&#x27;s first wife was Evgenia Debryanskaya, a Russian activist. They have a son, Artur Dugin, whom they named in honor of Arthur Rimbaud. Dugin had a daughter, Darya Dugina, with his second wife, philosopher Natalya Melentyeva. On 20 August 2022, Darya Dugina was killed in a car bombing when the car she was driving exploded near Bolshiye Vyazemy, a suburb of Moscow. It is unclear whether she was targeted deliberately, or whether her father, who had been expected to travel with her, but switched to another car at the last minute, was the intended target.

==Sanctions==
On 11 March 2015, the United States Department of the Treasury added Dugin to its list of Russian citizens who are sanctioned as a result of their involvement in the Russo-Ukrainian war; his Eurasian Youth Union was targeted too. In June 2015, Canada added Dugin to its list of sanctioned individuals.

On 3 March 2022, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned the outlet due to its alleged control by Dugin. Additionally, the United States Department of the Treasury sanctioned Dugin&#x27;s daughter Darya on the basis of her work as chief editor of the website United World International (UWI). According to the United States Department of the Treasury, UWI was developed as part of Project Lakhta, owned by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who is held responsible for part of the Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.

In January 2023, both Japan and Ukraine imposed sanctions on Dugin for promoting Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

<doc id="929472" wikidata="Q2389573" url="?curid=929472" title="Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown">
<text>Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown is a 1977 American animated adventure comedy film produced by United Feature Syndicate for Paramount Pictures, directed by Bill Melendez and Phil Roman, and the third in a series of films based on the &quot;Peanuts&quot; comic strip. It was the first &quot;Peanuts&quot; feature-length film produced after the death of composer Vince Guaraldi, who was originally intended to score the film, and used the same voice cast from the 1975 and 1976 TV specials, &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Sport, Charlie Brown&quot;, &quot;Happy Anniversary, Charlie Brown&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Arbor Day, Charlie Brown&quot;, and the same voice cast member from the 1974 TV special, &quot;It&#x27;s a Mystery, Charlie Brown&quot;. However, Liam Martin voiced Linus van Pelt for the last time in the movie, and went on to voice Charlie Brown in the 1978 TV special, &quot;What a Nightmare, Charlie Brown!&quot;. This would be Stuart Brotman&#x27;s final role before his death from a brain aneurysm in 2011.

Unlike the previous two &quot;Peanuts&quot; theatrical films, Charles M. Schulz wrote an original plot without relying on any specific storyline from the strip. The idea for the film came to him during a family trip, during which he tried rafting with his wife on Rouge River. However, some gags were taken from the strip, such as the one where Snoopy and Peppermint Patty jump on the waterbed. The film received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics and came 5 years after &quot;Snoopy Come Home&quot;, and 3 years before &quot;Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and Don&#x27;t Come Back!!)&quot;.

==Plot==
The children embark on a journey to Camp Remote, an isolated camp situated in the mountains. Upon arrival, they are introduced to the regimented structure and harsh conditions of camp life. In addition to these challenges, they must contend with a trio of domineering bullies and their aggressive bobcat, Brutus. Even Snoopy and Woodstock find themselves intimidated. The bullies boast of their repeated victories in the annual raft race, though it is soon revealed that their success is achieved solely through deception. Their raft is equipped with an outboard motor, radar, sonar, and a direction finder, and they employ underhanded tactics to sabotage their competitors. 

The children are divided into three teams: the boys’ team, consisting of Charlie Brown, Linus, Schroeder, and Franklin; the girls’ team, led by Peppermint Patty and including Marcie, Sally, and Lucy; and Snoopy and Woodstock, who compete independently. Charlie Brown reluctantly assumes leadership of the boys’ team, doubting his abilities. Peppermint Patty, in contrast, is assertive but ineffective, insisting that all decisions be made through secret ballot votes. However, when the results do not align with her preferences, she disregards them in favor of her own judgment. Meanwhile, the bullies’ arrogance results in an early misstep as they crash into a dock, losing valuable time. 

Throughout the race, the children traverse a variety of landscapes, including dense forests, towering mountains, and a logging community built along a river. Along the way, they encounter numerous challenges such as getting lost, enduring severe storms, and suffering repeated sabotage at the hands of the bullies. During one particularly treacherous storm, Snoopy and Woodstock are separated. Snoopy searches tirelessly for Woodstock, eventually taking refuge in an abandoned cabin for the night, where he has an unsettling encounter with a bear. After a prolonged search, he and Woodstock are joyfully reunited. Later, they arrive at the same cabin where the girls have sought shelter, but rather than being welcomed, they — along with the boys’ team — are forced to camp outside in the snow. 

As the journey continues, Charlie Brown demonstrates growing confidence and leadership. Though initially blamed for various mishaps, he gradually rises to the occasion, proving himself to be a capable leader. When the bullies ultimately destroy the other teams’ rafts, the boys and girls merge into a single group. Despite ongoing setbacks, Charlie Brown maintains his composure and leads them toward the final stage of the race. 

As the race nears its climax, the group appears poised for victory due to Charlie Brown’s newfound self-assurance. However, their progress is derailed when Peppermint Patty prematurely initiates a celebration, inadvertently knocking the boys overboard. The girls attempt to rescue them but fall into the water themselves. Seizing the opportunity, the bullies revel in their imminent triumph. However, their consistent recklessness and internal disputes have weakened their raft, and just before reaching the finish line, it collapses and sinks. 

With all other competitors eliminated, Snoopy and Woodstock remain the only ones in contention. Brutus attempts one final act of sabotage by puncturing Snoopy’s inner tube. Undeterred, Woodstock swiftly constructs a makeshift raft using twigs and a leaf for a sail, continuing toward victory. When Brutus attempts to attack him, Snoopy intervenes, striking the bobcat and ensuring Woodstock’s safe passage. Ultimately, Woodstock crosses the finish line first, securing victory. The bullies begrudgingly concede but vow revenge in the next year’s race. Their threats are cut short when Snoopy subdues Brutus once more, sending him fleeing in terror. 

As the children prepare to return home, Charlie Brown reflects on the experience, resolving to be more confident and assertive. However, as he finishes speaking, his moment of self-assurance is abruptly undercut when the bus departs without him (just like it happened earlier in the film), forcing him to hitch an alternate ride with Snoopy and Woodstock on a motorcycle.

==Reception==
&quot;Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown&quot; received 3 out of 5 stars in &quot;The New York Times&quot; from Janet Maslin, who wrote: &quot;The film runs an hour and quarter and has a rambling plot about a regatta, but it seems less like a continuous story than a series of droll blackout sketches, many of them ending with the obligatory &#x27;Good Grief!&#x27; ... The net effect is that of having read the comic strip for an unusually long spell, which can amount to either a delightful experience or a pleasant but slightly wearing one, depending upon the intensity of one&#x27;s fascination with the basic &quot;Peanuts&quot; mystique.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gave the movie 2.5 out of 4 stars (his lowest rating for the original four &quot;Peanuts&quot; movies), stating it&#x27;s &quot;mildly entertaining, but lacks punch&quot;.

==Home media==
The film was released on VHS in 1979 as a Fotomat exclusive, Betamax the same year and LaserDisc in the early 1980s. It was also the very first release in 1981 on RCA&#x27;s now defunct CED format. The VHS was released to mass markets in the early 1980s. It was released on VHS again with new artwork on August 17, 1994, and again on October 1, 1996, under the Paramount Family Favorites label. The film was released for the first time on DVD on February 10, 2015.

<text>Line of sight, sometimes written line-of-sight or abbreviated to LoS, is the visibility (that is, who can see what) on the playing field in wargames and some role-playing games (RPGs). Many abilities can only be used on entities within a character&#x27;s line of sight.

In some games, miniature figures are used to determine line of sight. Many wargames use counters to represent units and determine line of sight. A common technique is to hold a length of thread between two counters. If the thread, held straight, doesn&#x27;t encounter any obstacles, the line of sight is valid.

The first computer game to implement line of sight graphics was &quot;Dungeon&quot;, which was played on a PDP-10 mainframe computer (1975).

==Examples==
A tank behind a tall hill would not be able to see an enemy tank on the other side of the hill. Therefore, the first tank does not have a line of sight to the enemy tank. Conversely, a squad of soldiers atop the hill may be able to see both tanks, though the tanks may not be able to see them (since the tank&#x27;s upward line of sight is limited).

In an RPG, players may not see doors, objects or monsters located around the corner in a dungeon.

Line of sight is crucial to many types of video games, including, but not limited to, first-person shooters, strategy games, stealth games, and role-playing video games. In simplistic games with a top-down perspective, such as roguelikes, Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm can be used to determine line of sight. In first person games such as battlefield and flight simulators an implicit min/max kd-tree may be used to efficiently evaluate terrain line of sight queries.

In some live action role-playing games, such as NERO International, the line of sight is used as the duration for some spells and abilities. For example, a &quot;paralyze&quot; spell only lasts as long as the target remains within line of sight of the spell&#x27;s caster.

On the other hand, line of sight can be used offensively, like luring a player behind a pillar in order to set a trap - his teammate, being out of line of sight, won&#x27;t be able to help out until he gets in LoS, which in turn takes time. This time is usually the key moment to strike and go for a kill, if said player falls in said trap.

One algorithm for calculating 2-dimensional line of sight is given in the StraightEdge project.

<text>Haitian mythology consists of many folklore stories from different time periods, involving sacred dance and deities, all the way to Vodou. Haitian Vodou is a syncretic mixture of Roman Catholic rituals developed during the French colonial period, based on traditional African beliefs, with roots in Dahomey, Kongo and Yoruba traditions, and folkloric influence from the indigenous Taino peoples of Haiti. The lwa, or spirits with whom Vodou adherents work and practice, are not gods but servants of the Supreme Creator Bondye (pronounced Bon Dieu). A lot of the Iwa identities come from deities formed in the West African traditional regions, especially the Fon and Yoruba. In keeping with the French-Catholic influence of the faith, Vodou practioneers are for the most part monotheists, believing that the lwa are great and powerful forces in the world with whom humans interact and vice versa, resulting in a symbiotic relationship intended to bring both humans and the lwa back to Bondye. &quot;Vodou is a religious practice, a faith that points toward an intimate knowledge of God, and offers its practitioners a means to come into communion with the Divine, through an ever evolving paradigm of dance, song and prayers.&quot;

== History and origins of Voodooism in Haiti ==
Vodou originated from the Animist beliefs of the Yoruba tribes in Benin.

Voudon encapsulates an assortment of cultural elements, including personal creeds and practices, among which is a complex system of folk medical practices. Voudon to some is more than a belief but a way of life, upon which popular proverbs, stories, songs, and folklore are based around. Voudon teaches belief in a supreme being called Bondye, an unknowable and uninvolved created god. Voudon believers worship the lwa. There are in total 180 lwa in the Vodou religion, each of them carrying a name and, a specific and exclusive function. For instance, &quot;Gede&quot; are the spirit of life and death who is assigned to separate the souls and bodies of people when the time comes and also to watch over their graveyards. Gede also serve the role of connecting the past, present, and future, as well as amalgamating them into one reality.

Mythology in Haiti was used not only for politics but also for the revolution. Myths like: &quot;L&#x27;Union Fait La Force&quot; (Togetherness is Strength), is a story about slaves who rose up on August 22, 1791, in a heroic battle to win their freedom, and is a story about solidarity between two different groups of people to get freedom for the collective. Mythical symbols of Voudon and the tradition of the shifting from chaos to collectivity known as the religion of Vodou play a big role in the forming of Haitian mythology. Today, individuals referred to as &quot;Alchemists of Memory&quot; are the keepers of Vodou history and Haitian mythology, preserving the stories told by their ancestors.

<text>The Lichfield Canal, as it is now known, was historically a part of the Wyrley and Essington Canal, being the section of that canal from Ogley Junction at Brownhills on the northern Birmingham Canal Navigations to Huddlesford Junction, east of Lichfield, on the Coventry Canal, a length of 7 miles (11.3 km). The branch was abandoned in 1955, along with several other branches of the Wyrley and Essington, and much of it was filled in.

Restoration plans were first voiced in 1975, and since 1990, the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust have been actively engaged in excavating and rebuilding sections of the canal as they have become available. Major projects have included an isolated aqueduct over the M6 Toll motorway, ready for when the canal reaches it.

==History==
The Wyrley and Essington Canal was built under an act of Parliament, the Birmingham Canal Navigation Act 1792 (32 Geo. 3. c. 81), passed on 30 April 1792, for a canal which would run from Horseley Junction near Wolverhampton to Sneyd Junction, near Bloxwich. The main line would be level, following the contour. From this junction, a branch would run to Wyrley Bank and on to Essington, which would include nine locks, and another level branch would run to Birchills, near Walsall. In 1794, the company obtained a second act of Parliament, the Wyrley and Essington Canal Act 1794 (34 Geo. 3. c. 25), which authorised a long extension from Birchills to Brownhills, again on the level, but then descending through 30 locks to reach Huddlesford Junction, on the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal near Lichfield. The whole canal was opened on 9 May 1797, although there were problems with inadequate water supply, which were not resolved until 1800, with the building of Cannock Chase reservoir, Chasewater.

Although not prosperous, the Wyrley and Essington Canal Company made enough profit to start paying dividends, which eventually rose to 6 per cent in 1825. The price of coal in Lichfield dropped considerably, due to the benefits of cheap transport. Following an agreement reached on 9 February 1840, the whole canal became part of the Birmingham Canal Navigations from April of that year. Under the terms of an act of Parliament authorising abandonment obtained in 1954, most of the branches of the original Wyrley and Essington Canal were closed, including the branch from Ogley to Huddlesford, which was abandoned in 1955. Much of the bed was subsequently filled in, although a short section at Huddlesford Junction remains in use as moorings. The branch has subsequently been named the Lichfield Canal, while Huddlesford Junction is now considered to be on the Coventry Canal.

==Restoration==

Plans to restore the Lichfield Canal were first raised in 1975, when area planning authorities were required to produce county structure plans. The Inland Waterways Association (IWA) encouraged all members to ensure that local waterways were properly noted in the structure plans. Ideas for the restoration were put before the West Midlands planning team. Although the scheme was deemed to be unviable, interest in restoration continued, and the Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust (LHCRT) was formed to promote the restoration of the Lichfield Canal and the Hatherton Canal. Lichfield District Council allowed the Trust to start work on a half-mile (0.8 km) section near Fosseway Lane in 1990. In 1993, the Trust published detailed plans for the Ogley Locks Branch, now formally branded the &quot;Lichfield Canal&quot;.

All of the canal are within the jurisdiction of Lichfield District Council. The Trust began working on three main sites, as they became available. The first site was the half mile at Fossway Lane, bounded by locks 18 and 19, which was owned by the council. The second was at Darnford Lane, on either side of lock 29, which was bought by the council in 1995, using a Derelict Land Grant. The third was at Tamworth Road, covering locks 24 to 26. The upper two have been largely restored, while lock 24 was excavated to assess its condition, but was filled in again to conserve it, pending a decision on how the canal will cross Cricket Lane, immediately upstream from the lock. This whole area has been landscaped, and designated the Borrowcop Locks Canal Park.
Restoration was threatened by the construction of the M6 Toll motorway around the north of Birmingham, which cut across the canal&#x27;s route. The Inspector heading the enquiry for the Northern Relief Road ruled that the contractor would only be responsible for the footings for a new aqueduct to carry the canal over the motorway, and that the Trust would need to raise the costs for the rest of the structure. An appeal was launched for funds, headed by the actor David Suchet, and together with a grant of £250,000 from the Manifold Trust, the £450,000 cost was met, the road contractors built the supporting columns, and on 16 August 2003, a steel trough was craned into position, having been pre-fabricated by Rowecord Engineering, who are based in South Wales. (The aqueduct has been finished but the canal has yet to reach it, giving it an odd appearance). This had a beneficial side-effect – the Government promised that never again would a new road be built in the path of a waterway restoration scheme, unless an aqueduct or tunnel was provided.

A new bridge taking Cappers Lane over the canal near Whittington was opened on 21 April 2006.

By August 2010, most of the work on a by-wash for lock 25, adjacent to the Borrowcop Locks Canal Park, had been carried out by members of the Restoration Trust, with help from the Waterway Recovery Group during weekend visits to Lichfield. The canal between Lock 25 and 26 was filled with water in April 2011, the first part of the canal to be filled with water since restoration works started.

<text>Aalborg Air Base () also Air Transport Wing Aalborg is a military air base for the Royal Danish Air Force . It is located at Vadum, near Aalborg, Denmark.
Aalborg Air Base shares its runway system as well as some services (Air Traffic Control etc.) with Aalborg Lufthavn.

Residing Royal Danish Air Force units are:
* 721 Squadron which is an air transport squadron equipped with 
**four Lockheed C-130J-30 Hercules 
**four CL-604 Challenger aircraft

It is also the base for Denmark&#x27;s elite &quot;Jægerkorpset&quot; special forces unit.

Until their decommissioning on 10 January 2006, Aalborg Air Base was also home to:
* 723 Squadron
* 726 Squadron
These two squadrons were reconnaissance and fighter squadrons equipped with Lockheed F-16MLU Fighting Falcon aircraft.
The aircraft from these squadrons were transferred to Skrydstrup Air Base instead.

== History ==
Aalborg Air Base was established along with Aalborg Airport in 1938, serving the first Danish domestic flight between Aalborg and Copenhagen. The air base was established following pressure from the Aalborg Portland cement factory as local authorities were hesitant to invest in air traffic infrastructure.

When Germany invaded Denmark on 9 April 1940, the German Luftwaffe (Air Force) launched one of the first airborne operations in history, in which paratroopers captured the airport. Aalborg Lufthavn was considered a crucial element in the ferrying of troops and equipment from Germany to Norway as it acted as a refuelling base for Luftwaffe transport planes, especially Junkers Ju 52/3m, during the campaign.

A well known air battle took place over the airport on 13 August 1940, when a squadron of Royal Air Force Bristol Blenheim bombers attacked the German aircraft based there. All eleven attacking aircraft were shot down by either German anti-aircraft fire or Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter aircraft.

The Luftwaffe greatly expanded the airport - which they called &quot;Fliegerhorst Aalborg West&quot; - from 140 to 2750 hectares of land.

On June 16, 1944, RAF de Havilland Mosquitoes attacked the airfield. One of the RAF pilots, New Zealand fighter ace Michael Herrick, was killed leading aircraft of No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron. His earlier service had included flying night fighters in the Battle of Britain and two operational tours flying Curtiss P-40 Kittyhawks in the Pacific before returning to Britain to fly Mosquitoes against the Luftwaffe.

After the war, an internment camp for Baltic German refugees was set up at the location.

When the Royal Air Force arrived at the airport in 1945 most military and airport equipment had been destroyed. At this time the airport is by far the largest in Denmark.

When the Royal Danish Air Force was created in 1950, it took over the Fliegerhorst.

<text>In mathematics, the Kantorovich inequality is a particular case of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, which is itself a generalization of the triangle inequality.

The triangle inequality states that the length of two sides of any triangle, added together, will be equal to or greater than the length of the third side. In simplest terms, the Kantorovich inequality translates the basic idea of the triangle inequality into the terms and notational conventions of linear programming. (See vector space, inner product, and normed vector space for other examples of how the basic ideas inherent in the triangle inequality—line segment and distance—can be generalized into a broader context.)

More formally, the Kantorovich inequality can be expressed this way:

:Let

:: formula_1 
:Let formula_2 
:Then 
:: formula_3

The Kantorovich inequality is used in convergence analysis; it bounds the convergence rate of Cauchy&#x27;s steepest descent.

Equivalents of the Kantorovich inequality have arisen in a number of different fields. For instance, the Cauchy–Schwarz–Bunyakovsky inequality and the Wielandt inequality are equivalent to the Kantorovich inequality and all of these are, in turn, special cases of the Hölder inequality.

The Kantorovich inequality is named after Soviet economist, mathematician, and Nobel Prize winner Leonid Kantorovich, a pioneer in the field of linear programming.

There is also Matrix version of the Kantorovich inequality due to Marshall and Olkin (1990). Its extensions and their applications to statistics are available; see e.g. Liu and Neudecker (1999) and Liu et al. (2022).

<doc id="929503" wikidata="Q6540875" url="?curid=929503" title="Liberalism and radicalism in Italy">
<text>[[Liberalism]] and [[Classical radicalism|radicalism]] have played a role in the political history of Italy since the country&#x27;s unification, started in 1861 and largely completed in 1871, and currently influence several leading political parties.

During the first decades of Italy as a united country, the main parliamentary parties included liberals, but it was not until 1877 that the left-wing Radical Party was established as the first organized liberal party. The more centrist Liberal Union followed in 1913. Most liberal and radical parties were banned in 1926 under Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Fascist government.

After World War II and the establishment of the Italian Republic there have been frequent changes in the configuration of political parties and, for the most part, the representation of liberal and radical views has been split among a number of parties that may also espouse other views. These parties have often been part of governing coalitions.

During the so-called &quot;First Republic&quot; three minor liberal parties were active: the Italian Liberal Party (centre-right), the Italian Republican Party (centre-left) and the modern-day Radical Party (centre-left). More recently, liberals have been split primarily among the centre-right The People of Freedom/Forza Italia and the centre-left Democratic Party.

==Overview==
In the 19th century both early Italian political groupings, the Historical Right and the Historical Left, were composed of monarchist liberals and functioned mainly as loose parliamentary groups, while radicals organised themselves as the Radical Party, and republicans, who were influenced also by socialism, as the Italian Republican Party. These two parties had in fact been part of The Extreme, which included also the Italian Socialist Party and its predecessors.

In 1913 the liberals around Giovanni Giolitti joined forces in the Liberal Union and in 1922 the Italian Liberal Party is formed. In that period, other liberal parties emerged: the Constitutional Democratic Party, the Democratic Liberal Party (merger of the Radicals with other liberal groups), and the Italian Social Democratic Party.

When Benito Mussolini&#x27;s National Fascist Party came to power in 1922, some Liberals and Radicals flirted with Fascism, but, ultimately, a Fascist regime was established and all the parties, notably including the Italian Liberal Party and the Italian Republican Party, were banned.

After the end of World War II, both Liberals and Republicans reorganised themselves, followed by more liberal parties in the upcoming decades (notably including the new Radical Party), and, despite their modest results in elections, they were often part of the Italian government, in alliance with Christian Democracy. In the 1940s, during the resistance movement and the writing of the republican Constitution, an important role was played by the Action Party, a social-liberal, republican and liberal-socialist outfit, successor of the Justice and Freedom movement. In this phase the Liberals adhered to conservative liberalism and Republicans to social liberalism.

Since 1992–1994, following the &quot;Tangentopoli&quot; scandals, the subsequent &quot;Mani pulite&quot; inquiries and the resulting shake-up of the Italian party system, the liberal movement has been strongly divided. As a result, a broad group of parties, not all included here, started to use the &quot;liberal&quot; label.

Italian liberals are basically divided between the centre-right Forza Italia (successor of the former Forza Italia, itself primarily a merger of liberal and Christian-democratic forces, and The People of Freedom, which integrated the more conservative National Alliance) and the centre-left Democratic Party (a merger of social democrats, progressive Christian democrats and social liberals, the latter two mainly organised in Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy in the early 2000s).

Minor liberal parties include, among others, Civic Choice, the Italian Radicals (ALDE Party and Liberal International member), the aforementioned Italian Republican Party (which stretched a long way from the far-left to the centre-right of the political spectrum), and Act to Stop the Decline (a party which is the standard-bearer of a more classical- and libertarian-oriented form of liberalism). Also the centrist-populist Italy of Values was a member of the ALDE Party, but it is hardly a liberal party.

From 1994 on, most Liberals and several Republicans joined Forza Italia and the other parties of the House of Freedoms coalition. This is the reason why the term &quot;liberal&quot; is more often used when speaking of the centre-right than the centre-left. A new Italian Liberal Party was launched in 1997, but, as the Italian Republican Party, it survives as a very minor party. The former two, Civic Choice, Act to Stop the Decline and minor groups joined forces in European Choice, with disappointing results, in 2014.

<doc id="929505" wikidata="Q444912" url="?curid=929505" title="Romanian Old Kingdom">
<text>The Romanian Old Kingdom ( or just &quot;Regat&quot;; or ) is a colloquial term referring to the territory covered by the first independent Romanian nation state, which was composed of the Romanian Principalities: Wallachia and Moldavia. The union of the two principalities was achieved when, under the auspices of the Treaty of Paris (1856), the &quot;ad hoc&quot; Divans of both countries, which were then under Ottoman Empire suzerainty, voted for Alexander Ioan Cuza as their prince. This process achieved a &quot;de facto&quot; unification under the name of the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia. The region itself is defined by the result of that political act, followed by the Romanian War of Independence, the inclusion of Northern Dobruja and the transfer of the southern part of Bessarabia to the Russian Empire in 1878, the proclamation of the Kingdom of Romania in 1881, and the annexation of Southern Dobruja in 1913.

The term came into use after World War I, when the Old Kingdom became Greater Romania, after including Transylvania, Banat, Bessarabia, and Bukovina. The term now has mainly a historical relevance and is otherwise used as a common term for all regions in Romania included in both the Old Kingdom and the present borders (Wallachia, Moldavia, and Northern Dobruja).

<doc id="929506" wikidata="Q5339335" url="?curid=929506" title="Edmund Burke School">
<text>Edmund Burke School is an independent college preparatory school in Washington, D.C. Located on Connecticut Avenue NW, two blocks from the Van Ness - UDC metro station, Burke is home to a middle school (grades 6-8) and high school (grades 9-12).

Founded in 1968 by Jean Mooskin and Dick Roth, the school practices progressive pedagogy: classes and advisory groups are small, teachers go by their first names, and students have significant independence.

The school was named for 18th century British parliamentarian and philosopher Edmund Burke, , &quot;When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall one by one.&quot; These words are often cited as inspiration for the saying, &quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;

== History ==
Edmund Burke School was founded in 1968 by Roth and Mooskin, who met while teaching at the Hawthorne School, which would close in 1982. Burke first opened in a building at 2107 Wyoming Avenue NW and initially enrolled 17 students. Elizabeth Ely, a teacher at Burke when it opened, went on to found The Field School in 1972, and the two schools later became athletic rivals. In 1971, Burke&#x27;s growth prompted a move to 2120 Wyoming Avenue NW. In 1973, the school purchased 2955 Upton Street NW, which it later expanded to add a gymnasium and other facilities.

In 2003, Burke earned city approval to expand its facilities with a new building that would increase both size and capacity and now includes new computer labs, offices, middle school classrooms, athletic facilities, a theater, and an underground parking garage. A new building, dedicated primarily to the Middle School and the arts, connected with the school&#x27;s longtime home, opened in 2006.

In summer 2021, Burke began a renovation to the historic high school building, which resulted in a new ceramics studio, renovated space for digital and wet photography, community gathering space, new fitness center, and a lunch servery.

Co-founders Mooskin and Roth retired in 1999, and David Shapiro became the Head of School. The current Head of School is Steve McManus.

=== 2022 shooting ===
On April 22, 2022, a gunman armed with four rifles modified to fire on fully-automatic and mounted with scopes, along with two handguns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition, positioned himself on the fifth floor of an apartment building adjacent to the school. He proceeded to fire at least 239 shots toward the school and other nearby buildings, barely wounding four people, and breaking glass in the school. During the incident, the gunman posted a video of the shooting on 4chan and edited the school&#x27;s Wikipedia page to report the incident. About five hours later, police found and breached the apartment of the gunman; they found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.

== Profile ==

Burke enrolls approximately 225 high school students (Grades 9–12) and 90 middle school students (Grades 6–8). In 2024–25, those students represent 59 different zip codes in DC, Maryland, and Virginia and 40% self-identify as people of color. The Class of 2024 attended 49 different colleges and universities in the United States and Canada.

The school employs roughly 70 faculty and staff, and 77% of teachers hold advanced degrees. The average class size is 12- students, and high school students can pursue independent studies and serve as teaching assistants. All graduating seniors complete an independent senior project.

The school dedicates 15% of its annual budget to Financial Aid and, on average, one-third of Burke families receive financial aid.

== Facilities ==

The school has two buildings, affectionately dubbed &quot;Calvin&quot; and &quot;Hobbes&quot;. The school, while physically small in comparison to others in the area, is home to a black box theater, a gym, library, computer lab, ceramics studio, photography studio, and two music rooms. Burke&#x27;s athletics teams practice and play at Howard Field (Howard University School of Law), UDC Athletic Fields, and UDC Pool/Natatorium (University of the District of Columbia), just across the street. Burke is also located less than 20 minutes (on foot) from Rock Creek Park, National Zoological Park (United States), and Levine School of Music.

== Athletics ==
The Burke Bengals compete primarily in the Potomac Valley Athletic Conference (PVAC). Burke offers varsity teams in Volleyball, Cross Country, Soccer, Basketball, Swimming, Baseball, Track and Field, Ultimate Frisbee, Golf, and Softball, which won three consecutive championship titles in 2017-19.

In 2023-24, the middle school girls soccer team and high school girls swim team were the PVAC Champions, as were seven individual athletes in swimming and track &amp; field.

Burke has a &quot;no-cut&quot; policy, such that all interested students can have a place on a team, regardless of ability. Varsity teams do require annual tryouts.

<text>Sahaptian (also Sahaptianic, Sahaptin, Shahaptian) is a two-language branch of the hypothetical Plateau Penutian family spoken by Native American peoples in the Columbia Plateau region of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho in the northwestern United States.

The terms &quot;Sahaptian&quot; (the family) and &quot;Sahaptin&quot; (the language) have often been confused and used interchangeably in the literature.

==Family division==
Sahaptian includes two languages:

:1. Nez Perce (&quot;Niimiipuutímt&quot;)
:2. Sahaptin

Nez Perce has two principal dialects, Upper and Lower. Sahaptin has somewhat greater internal diversity, with its main dialects being Umatilla and Yakama.

Noel Rude&#x27;s (2012) classification of Sahaptian is as follows.
*Proto-Sahaptian
**Nez Perce
**Sahaptin
***&quot;Columbia River&quot; dialect
***&quot;Northern&quot; dialect
****&quot;Northwest&quot; dialect
****&quot;Northeast&quot; dialect
==Proto-language==
Work on Proto-Sahaptian reconstruction has been undertaken by Aoki (1962) and Noel Rude (2006, 2012).

<doc id="929514" wikidata="Q5684690" url="?curid=929514" title="Hawazma tribe">
<text>Hawazma, part of Sudan&#x27;s Baggara tribe, are cattle herders who roam the area from the southern parts of North Kurdufan to the southern borders of South Kurdufan, a distance of about 300 kilometers. Through their nomadic movement, the Hawazma know the area, terrain, ethnic groups, local tribes, tribal cultures, ecosystems, climate, vegetation, existence of risks and diseases, and water resources better than any other inhabitants of the region. The term Baggara is a collective name applied to all cattle-herding tribes with Arab roots. Cattle herders from Nuba tribes are not called Baggara. Cattle herders of middle and eastern Sudan, although they are Arab in roots, are also not Baggara. The Baggara occupy a wide area, from Kordofan, Mid-Western Sudan, to Darfur in the far Western Sudan and extending to neighboring Chad. They are a collection of seven major tribes: Hawazma, Messiria Humr Messiria Zurug, Rizeigat, Ta’isha, Habbaniya, Beni Halba, Awlad Himayd, and Beni Selam. All Baggara have similar physical facial features, costumes, dance, religion, food, and in general a common culture and way of life.

==Origins==
The Hawazma are believed to have migrated to Sudan during early days of Islamic missionaries to Africa as part of Baggara Arabs, perhaps as early as the 12th century. Most historians believe they belong to the Juhayna group; a clan of Bedouin Arabs which migrated from Saudi Arabia. Hawazma traditional historians say they originally came from the Arabian Peninsula to Egypt then followed the River Nile until they settled on Jebel Awliyya part of Khartoum Province and as the grazing land became scarce and overcrowded they gradually moved to Western Sudan. These stories correspond well with the presence of scores of Hawazma in Kosti, Middle Sudan, Um Rowaba, Eastern part of Kordofan and Al Rahad, middle-eastern part of Kordofan. The journey continued beyond Kordofan, to Darfur on the Western Sudan and today they have reached Chad, the country on western border of Sudan.

According to British colonial administrator Harold MacMichael, in the mid-eighteenth century in the days of the Funj, heads of families from six tribes, finding themselves unable to stand alone, came to the Hawazma and asked for protection and agreed to join the Hawazma. The leaders of these groups swore an oath binding themselves to the Hawazma, and they were referred to henceforth as the Halafa. The six tribes that formed the Halafa subgroup of the Hawazma: the Bedaria, Takarir, Jellaba Howara, Zenara and Nuba. 

== Present routes ==
Wherever Baggara settle they start a seasonal nomadic movement that goes from north to south, in a Round-Robin fashion according to the season and perpendicular to their historical migration route. Mostly they only follow two routes, one route from north to south and different route from south to north. But the routes are not far apart, and they are permanent, they never change them. Any tribe has its own routes. Hawazma are mostly found in routes originating from Al Obeid city in North Kurdufan, through Deling city and its eastern part, Kadugli city and its eastern part, to Talodi region. Messiria just borders them to the west. Humr borders Messiria to the west. And so forth.

Today the Hawazma in particular and Baggara in general bear little resemblance to Bedouin Arabs, due to their acclimatization and their inter-marriage with other African tribes. Many Hawazma subtribes have dark skin, and closely resemble Nuba tribes. And many members of these tribes speak Nuba dialects fluently. Still some tribe names indicate their mixed origins. Other Hawazma subtribes have preserved their Arabic features: light brown complexion, and thick eyebrows and lashes.

==Socio-economic factors: pastoralism and agriculture==

When Hawazma families lose their herds they settle. Generally, Hawazma settled in villages or established villages from southern parts of Al Obeid city in Northern Kordofan to Talodi city in South Kordofan. Those who settled in northern border of South Kordofan or Southern border of North Kordofan are mostly Gumaiyya, including: Gumaiyya Kilaibab, Gumaiyya Al Hussienat, and Gumaiyya Matrafia, in addition to other Hawazma Oulad Gaboush and Dar Niayylie. These subtribes intermarried with Bidaria and Mosabaat and other Kordofanian tribes. Their lifestyle closely resembles the Kordofanian tribes. Mostly engaged in raising crops and cattle. Notably their Hawazma Arabic Accent is inclined to include Kordofanian Arabic accents. Similarly, they adopted a way of cultivation, crop tending, and harvesting similar to those other Kordofanian tribes. They used a long-handled spade called Jarrieh and Saloqqa, they tend their farm while standing, not similar to those of Hawazma deep in South Kordofan who tend while they are sitting on their heels. Their crops include: millet, watermelon, groundnuts, sesame and hibiscus.

Those who settled in the middle of South Kordofan in Kadugli and its suburb, include: Gumaiyya Nafar Balal, Gumaiyya Nafar Ayyad, Gumaiyya Nafar Adam and others. These who settled around the Deling city and its suburb are mostly Hawazma Dar Niayylie. Both groups have adopted the mainstream Hawazma way of life and their Hawazma Arabic accents. In terms of agricultural practices, they grow sorghum, sesame, cotton and okra. They mostly use tools such as Sollucab for seeding and Antabab and axe for clearing shrubs and trees. Mostly cultivate by uprooting grasses with their bare hands. These are among the most victimized Hawazma during this civil wars.
On the southern parts of South Kordofan, settled Hawazma Al Rawawqa. Al Rawawqa subtribe embodies large subsubtribal diversity. Among the most prevalent are Rawawqa Oulad Nuba. These are group of Hawazma who most resembles Nuba in most of their living habits and agricultural practices. They cultivate with Jarrieh a Nuba developed tool, tend while sitting on their heels. Mostly grow sorghum, sesame, and groundnuts and gather wild okra. Again these are among the most victimized Hawazma in the region.

On the eastern side of South Kordofan, lives Hawazma Darbettie, now separated from those living central South Kordofan, due to geographic distance.
On the western parts of South Kordofan, no Hawazma live their, it is found our cousins: Messiria, Humr, Rezeigat, Ta&#x27;isha and Habbaniya. They have similar lifestyles as Hawazma, and only differentiated by their phonetic accents of Arabic language.

==Character, appearance and costumes==
Hawazma, like any other Baggara people, have graceful slim physical statues; their skins range from light brown to dark colors. However, although they are referred to as Arabs; phenotypically, the Hawazma and other Baggara peoples are similar to other local indigenous populations. E The men wear a white gown called Jallabiyya, white pants (pajamas), a head cap called a , big white turbans called and locally made leather shoes called . Men of all ages always carry knives, which are worn on the forceps of the left arm and hidden in a decorated leather covering, carry sticks, spears, sometimes swords or big spears. The women wear a dress called , and cover their bodies with taubes such as Indian sari. Young men wear eye-catching colored flashy shirts, shorts, pants, beads, necklaces, and bracelets. Young women wear during festivals and dancing to show their ornate braided hairstyles.

==Sociological issues: gender, health and education==
Baggara are mostly illiterate. In the early days, they look to the school as a way to alienate their kids, to teach them moral delinquencies, to distract them from Baggara way of life: cattle herding and nomadic movement. Young Baggara look after cows daylong, they return to Baggara camp during evening times. Baggara lack clean drinking water, health clinics, electricity, television, radio and other forms of media. Pregnant women rarely visit clinics or doctors. Female genital circumcision is common. Facial scarring called Shoulokh, lips sticking, and braided hair are usual practices among women.

Women represent an important workforce; they milk cows, prepare meals, raise kids, market dairy products, build houses, and participate in crop cultivation. Baggara youth are cheerful group in the Baggara families; their main mental set to look for festivals, rituals, dancing gossip around for abstinence and only supervises young kids to range cattle. Men are completely idle during dry seasons, play Dala (sort of cards played with sticks) and coordinate the meager activity during summer such as delivering grains to mills and bringing the daily family grocery from women&#x27;s marketed-dairy-product money. Baggara raise huge herds, never for marketing, but for prestige. The wealth and prestige is determined by the size of one&#x27;s herds. The work of anthropologist Barbara Michael work is a large contribution to the subject of Hawazma socio-enonomics.

==Beginnings of conflict==
Beginning in early 1983, radio broadcasts by South Sudanese rebels alarmed the people of South Kordofan and increased tensions in the area.

Soon after, weapons started to appear on the black market. The military started recalling retirees and drafting young men for service. The weapons trade was flourishing with gun sellers roaming the Baggara villages and nomad camps. The militiamen given themselves roles to protect the Baggara camps and fight to defend the villages.

Gaafar Nimeiry&#x27;s regime began arming Messiria Zurug and Messiria Humr, known as the Muraheleen milita, to balance the rebel attack on Abyei area. The rebels attacked a Chevron Oil Company site, killing four Chevron employees. Also, they attacked the Baggara campuses to acquire cattle for food. Now the war completely broke at southwest of South Kordofan. By the end of Normeri&#x27;s regime, in 1985, South Kordofan was in chaos although other parts of Kordofan were peaceful.

During, Al Sadiq Al Mahdi era, the Messiria Zurug and Messiria Humr were armored, the paramilitary forces became legal and carrying weapons was legal. Everyone had AK-47 machine gun. During this time rebels attacked the southern part of South Kordofan, especially Gardoud village, around Talodi city. The Baggara were heavily victimized in Gardoud; sixty Baggara were dead, 82 wounded. Religious leaders and Imams, were publicly executed, women were raped, houses were burned and cattle herds were raided. South Kordofan now is a war zone. People evacuated the cities, traders stopped their trades, and all other tribes and ethnic groups not from South Kordofan left the region.

==Civil war==
In 1987, Yusif Kuwa Mekki entered South Kordofan as commander for the rebels. Immediately war expanded to el Hamra, el Buram, Um Sirdiba and surrounding areas. Hawazma villages were systematically targeted by rebels, killing them as groups, individuals or evacuated them completely as happened in Um Sirdiba. Africa Justice organization provided many reports documenting abuses by SPLA . These reports indicate the worse human rights situation in South Kordofan.

In 1989, Al Boukhas village was completely destroyed and about 40 villages of Hawazma were either attacked or evacuated before the attack and the people left their possessions and crops. By the end of 1989, about 300,000 Baggara were either relocated to big cities or displaced and resettled on the northern border of South Kordofan. For six years, Kuwa war machines (six battalions) were directed to systematic torturing of Baggara tribes, completely destroying their infrastructures and eliminating their educated youth; leaders; and the elite. We have not seen any major attack on military campuses or major military stronghold places in South Kordofan. The war was directed toward Baggara tribesmen.

In January 1990 Abu Safifa village was burned to the ground. By February 1990, only Baggara men stayed on the villages while kids, women and the elderly were displaced or relocated. The war became ethnic cleansings against the Baggara, while the west was still misled with the NGOs, which look after their religious and political agenda in South Kordofan&#x27;s desperate tribal wars. Rebel guerrilla fighters were looking for excitement in the news by destroying Baggara villages to show their presence, then escape to the mountains tops such as Morou Mountain or Tolishi Mountains.

Nuba militia fighters found a breeding ground in the presence of rebels fighters. Tarrevera militia fighters, from Morou, crossed the road for every vehicle; evacuating Baggara and executing them. They placed road mines and ambushed cars. When mines went off, they would attack; kill or loot goods and then they would escape to mountains or densely forested valleys.

During the military regime of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, which came to power in June 1989, by revolting against elected Prime Minister Sadiq Al Mahdi government, South Kordofan entered a new phase of the civil war. Islamic jihad war against infidels was completely the norm of life in South Kordofan. Religious decrees (Fatwas) were declared urging people to join the war. The Baggara are 100 percent Muslims and 75 percent of Nuba are Muslims. Then who was the Islamic war against? However, due to the desperation of Baggara, following the unspeakable atrocities by rebels, they sided with the military forces to protect themselves. Soon, Yusuf Kuwa and rebels fighters realized the effect of Baggara on the war balance; basically attributed to their knowledge of the terrain and the intricacies of South Kordofan. The Baggara lead the government forces to caves and hiding places for the rebels. Rebels Commander Yusif Kuwa Mekki started to negotiate with Baggara, either to take side with him or at least to refrain from supporting the government army against the rebels. Yusuf Kuwa succeeded in convening and writing many mutual agreements with local Baggara leaders.

Baggara held good to their agreements. This came to disadvantage the government. The government, thereafter, started a full swing against Baggara, who hold to their agreements by jailing, torturing or killing or forcing them to refrain from any agreements.

As of today, with peace agreement in progress, Baggara has nothing to negotiate. They were used, abused and victimized by the rebels and the Government forces. NGOs never came to Baggara villages to report the atrocities, and probably assumed not deserving any human rights.

And in fact specifically at the beginning of our entry in &#x27;89 a lot of soldiers started to rampage and to loot, and we started (to impose) very harsh punishments, even we (sent some to the)firing squad. We tried our best to stop that. Another time when we had hunger in &#x27;91-&#x27;92, some started to use their guns so they can acquire whatever [they need]. That is why we tried to politicise the soldiers. We try to tell them that it is not our purpose to come and loot our own people and harass them. Whoever does this will be punished. We gave them very harsh punishments&quot; end quote.

The report speak to that effect.
* Dr Mohamed Suliman, Chairman, Institute for African Alternatives, London, said in this link: &quot;The Baggara lost some of their traditional lands, many men, and animals. Their trade with the Nuba collapsed. Losses forced the Baggara in several areas to negotiate peace with the Nuba&quot;.

<text>Yverdon-les-Bains () (called Eburodunum and Ebredunum during the Roman era) is a municipality in the district of Jura-Nord vaudois of the canton of Vaud in Switzerland. It is the seat of the district. The population of Yverdon-les-Bains, , was .

Yverdon is located in the heart of a natural setting formed by the Jura mountains, the plains of the Orbe, the hills of the Broye and Lake Neuchâtel. It is the second most important town in the Canton of Vaud. It is known for its thermal springs and is an important regional centre for commerce and tourism.

It was awarded the Wakker Prize in 2009 for the way the city handled and developed the public areas and connected the old city with Lake Neuchâtel.

== History ==
The heights nearby Yverdon seem to have been settled at least since the Neolithic Age about 5000 BCE, as present archeological evidence shows. The town was at that time only a small market place, at the crossroads of terrestrial and fluvial communication ways. People began to settle, at first in temporary huts at the water-front, for fishers and merchants, then in permanent dwellings.

The Celtic Helvetii are said to have been the first permanent settlers of Eburodunum (Celtic and Roman name of Yverdon), from about the 2nd century BCE.

About a century later, the Romans realized the commercial and strategic importance of this place: it controlled major routes such as Geneva-Avenches, connecting the Rhône and Rhine basins, as well as those of Rhone and Danube.

The imposing &quot;Castrum&quot;, or stronghold, called &quot;Castrum Ebredunense&quot; was the second largest in Switzerland and demonstrated the importance the Romans attached to Yverdon. The port served as naval base for the barges supplying the defensive positions along the Rhine, which marked the North-Eastern border of the Empire. Thus the Roman &quot;Vicus&quot; of Eburodunum developed into a prosperous urban centre. The sulphur springs were already used for a thermal spa, as attested by excavations. It is even possible that the Helvetii appreciated the beneficial effects of these waters.

=== The Castrum ===

About a century after the first invasions of the Alemanni, when the &quot;Vicus&quot; had been completely destroyed, the Romans built a large military stronghold (about 325 CE). It covered about and was protected by gigantic ramparts and 15 masonry towers (&quot;Castrum&quot;).
The Barbarians invaded Italy in the 5th century, and threatened to assault Rome. In a last desperate effort to save the city, all troops stationed North of the Alps were ordered back to Italy. The garrison and the Roman administration had to abandon the Yverdon camp. The inhabitants of Eburodunum, up to then assigned to live beyond the ramparts, immediately took possession of the &quot;Castrum&quot;, using it for their own safety. Like this, Eburodunum-Yverdon survived the hard times, until the 15th century. The Castrum was noted in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (dated c. 420 CE).

=== Savoy era ===
With the lake receding, the ancient town confined to the &quot;Castrum&quot; had lost its strategic position: no more direct access to the port, or to the new trade routes alongshore.

When Peter II of Savoy gradually extended his rule over the &quot;Pays de Vaud&quot; (&quot;Land of Vaud&quot;), he managed to impose road tolls as well as port and fishing taxes. He founded the new town (&quot;Ville Neuve&quot;) of Yverdon, defended by walls and a castle. Construction works were launched around 1259 and attracted many settlers.

=== Yverdon Castle ===
The imposing main walls and their four towers were erected within a few years. The design of the castle followed the geometric characteristics used for castles set in plains, and had been planned by the young mason and architect Jacques de Saint-Georges. Jacques also planned Caernarvon Castle and built the castle Saint-Georges d&#x27;Espéranches, near Lyon.

Yverdon&#x27;s castle used to be the residence of the castellans of the Savoy dynasty, until 1536, followed by the bailiffs of Bern state. In 1798, the &quot;Département du Léman&quot; became the castle&#x27;s owner. The &quot;Département&quot; had been set up by the short-lived &quot;Helvetian Republic&quot; (1798–1803), imposed by Napoleon I.

A few years later, Yverdon acquired the castle, to entrust it to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi and his institute. After 1838, the castle housed a public school. New classrooms were created, especially on the second floor: dividing walls were erected, additional windows changed the severe look of the castle&#x27;s façade.
After 1950, these classrooms were gradually abandoned; the last classes left in 1974. The original medieval structure was then restored. The castle is today a multi-purpose cultural centre, housing a regional museum, a theatre, various conference rooms and the oldest public library of French-speaking Switzerland, founded already in 1763. The library is now part of the castle museum, existing since 1830.

=== Bernese era (1536–1798) ===
The Savoy rulers granted bountiful franchise and liberties to the burghers of Yverdon. The township prospered during the two hundred years preceding the Burgundy wars.

The Bernese conquest followed. During the nearly three hundred years of Bernese occupation, economic life continued to thrive.

The 18th century proved to be one of Yverdon&#x27;s most favorable periods, marked by cultural and economic highlights. Then a town of about 2.000 inhabitants, Yverdon became known as a spa, and as a centre of thought (58 tomes of Yverdon Encyclopedia, published between 1770 and 1780), being in close contact with the great minds and movements of the time.

=== Town hall ===
Burnand, its architect, erected the town hall between 1768 and 1773, on the site of the former covered market. Inside the building, furniture and decorations are displayed, faience stoves, panels, wainscots and paintings. The vaults of the ancient granary are used year-round for art exhibitions.

=== The temple ===

The Geneva architect Billon erected this Protestant church in 1757, on the site of Notre-Dame chapel of the 14th century. Its spire had been rebuilt in 1608, on the base of the original one, for which huge, sculpted blocks from the ruins of the Roman &quot;Castrum&quot; had been used.
14 stalls, figuring apostles and prophets, originate from the ancient chapel and are ascribed to Claude de Peney, who had worked at Fribourg and Hauterive. Peney died in 1499, and Bon Bottolier, cabinetmaker in Lausanne, was charged with crafting the stalls (1501–1502). Potier, of French origin, built the organ in 1766.

=== Thermal springs ===
The springs were known for their mineral baths and used at least since the Roman era, but most probably before, at the time of the Helvetii. It is supposed that the springs were a sacred place, with some sort of wooden structure. Middle Age documents prove the existence of a spa centre, as early as 1429, and mention several useful buildings.

By 1728, the authorities decided to have a new spa constructed. Its reputation grew rapidly. The 18th century saw major developments and brilliant success, for the town and the spa. Then followed a period of decline: the spa lost its popularity, and by 1800 had declined to a simple political meeting point. Completely neglected, the buildings dilapidated.
Encouraged by the Spanish scientist A. Gimbernat, the local Council decided to reconstruct the spa centre and to renovate its hotel in 1897. The consequences of the First World War (1914–1918) were detrimental, the number of guests having significantly declined. Its reputation remained intact, however, until the 1930s.

Another period of decay followed, and by 1960 the centre and its equipment were again so dilapidated that they had to be closed. The idea of balneology had also completely changed. The Municipality repurchased the spa, including the neighbouring Château d&#x27;Entremonts.
Restoration failed twice, but in 1974 the project could finally be realized. The spa reopened in 1977. Prospects for further thermal springs were successful in 1982, and a new outdoor pool was added a year later. Today, the spa welcomes more than 1200 visitors per day.

During an independent test by the RTS in February 2008, it was found that the water in the shower area of the thermal center had high levels of legionella pneumophila. During another test in 2011, the same programme found no significant levels of dangerous bacteria in the waters. However, in October 2014, there was a leak of 4000l of hydrochloric acid from one of the tanks in the thermal center. No one was hurt, and the bathers remaining in the pools were asked to evacuate.

=== Champ-Pittet manor house ===
The 18th century manor house, near the road to Yvonand, has served as summer residence of Frédéric Haldimand, burgher of Yverdon and first Governor of Canada (1777–1786), when this territory became part of the British crown.
This country-seat now belongs to Pro Natura, the Swiss League for the Protection of Nature, and is one of its two nature centres; organizing special exhibitions, audio-visual shows as well as guided tours of the nature reserve, the &quot;Grande Caricaie&quot;.

<doc id="929524" wikidata="Q186229" url="?curid=929524" title="Jean-François Thiriart">
<text>Jean-François Thiriart (; 22 March 1922, Brussels – 23 November 1992), often known as Jean Thiriart, was a Belgian far-right political theorist.
Coming from a left-wing background, during the Second World War he was a collaborator with the Nazi Third Reich, as a result of which he served a prison sentence. In the 1960s, he founded and directed the transnational Jeune Europe (Young Europe) movement. He was the theorist of European national communism, a synthesis of revolutionary nationalism and Pan-European nationalism, a form of revolutionary nationalism transposed up to the scale of Europe as a unitary state.

==Youth==
Coming from a left-wing family, Thiriart was initially a member of some Socialist and antifascist movements. He switched to far-right politics and joined the extremist &quot;Fichte Bund&quot;. In 1940, he was associated with &quot;Les Amis du grand Reich Allemand&quot;, a group composed of former far-left activists which supported collaborationism with the Third Reich. Thiriart himself served in the Waffen SS and later served time in prison for his collaboration. Upon his release, he set up in business as an optometrist.

==Cold War syncretism==
Thiriart returned to the political scene in the 1960s, after in 1960 Belgium had granted independence to the Belgian Congo, which became the Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville), setting off the Congo Crisis. Due to his strong opposition to this development, Thiriart became associated with the Mouvement d&#x27;Action Civique (MAC), although he also became interested in a more international vision. Establishing links with French groups similarly opposed to decolonization, Thiriart eventually became a European nationalist, convinced of the need for a united Europe. As a result, he formed &quot;Jeune Europe&quot;, a movement aiming to reach out across Europe, soon founding branches in Italy, Spain, and France. In Belgium, he continued to co-operate with MAC, which enjoyed close ties to &quot;Jeune Europe&quot;. 

Thiriart publicly disavowed fascism and called Nazism obsolete, but his movement was still accused of having a fascist basis, partly as a result of adopting as its emblem the Celtic cross, a symbol widely used in neo-fascism, and partly because in its weekly magazine &quot;Jeune Europe&quot; it advertised the activities of the allegedly neo-Nazi Hans-Ulrich Rudel, leader of the &quot;Deutsche Reichspartei&quot;. 

With a policy that was both Anti-American and Anti-Soviet, Thiriart represented Europe as the true cradle of civilisation, and was opposed to uncontrolled immigration and imperialism, instead supporting national liberation, sovereignty and self-determination for all Europeans and what he called the &quot;allied ethnicities&quot; of Europe. Thiriart&#x27;s views won him many enemies, on both the orthodox right and the left, this is partly due to the fact that he was highly influenced by the thinking of Francis Parker Yockey. He denied that he was a Nazi, claiming to belong to the centre of the political spectrum. Thiriart attempted to put his ideas into practice by being instrumental in the formation of the National Party of Europe, an unsuccessful attempt at creating a Europe-wide nationalist party.

Seeking to support radical revolutionaries in Latin America and Black Power movements in the United States, Thiriart began to develop the idea of creating &quot;Political Soldiers&quot;, and set up training camps to facilitate indoctrination. He also became an admirer of Nicolae Ceauşescu, indicating a sympathy towards Stalinism that displayed strong Nationalist characteristics. He also admired the People&#x27;s Republic of China for these same reasons. Historian Walter Laqueur called his views a form of fascist Maoism.

According to US academic George Michael, Thiriart served as an adviser to Fatah of the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1970s.

==National Bolshevism and later life==
Thiriart moved towards National Bolshevism and in later life he worked closely with such exponents of this idea as Aleksandr Dugin. 

Thiriart was later in life a supporter of a &quot;Euro-Soviet empire which would stretch from Dublin to Vladivostok and would also need to expand to the south, since it require(s) a port on the Indian Ocean.&quot; Dugin liked the idea so much, he made it the frontispiece of his 1997 book &quot;Foundations of Geopolitics&quot;.

As well as being a member of the small pan-European European Liberation Front, Thiriart came to spend a lot of time in Russia where he saw the potential for an explosion in European Nationalism. He is the author of several books.

Thiriart died of a heart attack in 1992.

<doc id="929530" wikidata="Q1660081" url="?curid=929530" title="Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair">
<text>Ruaidrí mac Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (Modern Irish: Ruairí Ó Conchúir; anglicised as Rory O&#x27;Conor) ( – 2 December 1198) was King of Connacht from 1156 to 1186, and High King of Ireland from 1166 to 1198. He was the last High King of Ireland before the Anglo-Norman invasion.

Ruaidrí was one of over twenty sons of King Tairrdelbach Ua Conchobair (1088–1156). He and his sister Mór were Tairrdelbach&#x27;s only children from his third wife, Cailech Dé Ní hEidin of Aidhne.

==&quot;Rigdamna Connachta&quot;==
Ruaidrí was not a favourite of his father, his brother Conchobar Ua Conchobair being Tairrdelbach&#x27;s &quot;tánaiste&quot; and designated heir. In 1136, he and his brother Aedh (died 1195) took advantage of a low in Tairrdelbach&#x27;s fortunes to stage a rebellion. Aedh was blinded by Conchobar on Tairrdelbach&#x27;s orders but Ruaidrí was protected by the Archbishop of Connacht, Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh. In 1143, he staged another rebellion. He was arrested by Conchobar and Tighearnán Ua Ruairc.
&quot; Ruaidhri, was taken by Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair, in violation of laity and clergy, relics and protection. These were the sureties: Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, with the clergy and laity of Connacht; Tadhg Ua Briain, lord of Thomond; Tighearnan Ua Ruairc, lord of Breifne; and Murchadh, son of Gilla-na-naemh Ua Fearghail, lord of Muintir-Anghaile. The clergy of Connacht, with Muireadhach Ua Dubhthaigh, fasted at Rath-Brenainn, to get their guarantee, but it was not observed for them.&quot;
After a year&#x27;s imprisonment, Archbishop of Armagh Gilla Meic Liac mac Diarmata sought his release by April 1144, along with his confederates Domnall Ua Flaithbertaig and Cathal Ua Conchobair. However, Tairrdelbach only acquiesced upon the assassination of Conchobar in Mide, later that year. 

==Tánaiste==
Tairrdelbach now chose another son, Donnell Mor Mideach Ua Conchobair, as &quot;tánaiste&quot;, but Ruaidrí improved his status with raids against Tighearnán Ua Ruairc in 1146 and capturing and killing Tairrdelbach&#x27;s nephew and opponent, Domnall Ua Conchobar, in 1150. Donnell Mór Mideach began to lose favour in 1147 and his fate was sealed when he was arrested in 1151, making solid Ruadrí&#x27;s claim as his father&#x27;s heir. In that year, Ruadrí successfully raided Thomond, where Tairrdelbach won a great victory at the Battle of Móin Mór.

==Dearbhforgaill&#x27;s alleged abduction==
In 1152, Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn travelled into Mide, compelling hostages of Tairrdelbach.
&quot;They divided Meath into two parts on this occasion; ... On this occasion Dearbhforgaill, daughter of Murchadh Ua Maeleachlainn, and wife of Tighearnan Ua Ruairc, was brought away by the King of Leinster&quot; (Dermot MacMurrough).
This account was written more than 500 years after the events took place. More contemporary accounts suggest that the &#x27;abduction&#x27; may have been closer to an elopement where Dearbhforgaill abandoned her ageing husband for someone closer to her own age.

==Activity to 1156==
Ruaidrí remained active in suppressing the Ua Briains of Munster, burning Croome, dividing Munster in half (Thomond to Tadhg Ua Briain, Desmond to Diarmaid MacCartaigh), expelling Toirrdelbach mac Diarmata into Ailech. This gave reason for Mac Lochlainn to travel south with an army in 1153. Tairrdelbach was beaten off by Mac Lochlainn, leaving Ruaidhri and his men exposed at Fordruim, (now in County Westmeath):
&quot;Ruaidhri, son of Toirdhealbhach, and the battalion of West Connacht, and the recruits of Sil-Muireadhaigh, came to Fordruim; but as they were pitching their camp there, the heroes of the North poured upon them without previous notice, and numbers of the Connachtmen were slain by them, and among the rest Gillacheallaigh Ua hEidhin, lord of Aidhne, and his son, Aedh; Brian Ua Dubhda, lord of Ui-Fiachrach of the North; Muircheartach, son of Conchobhar (who was son of Toirdhealbhach) Ua Conchobhair; Domhnall Ua Birn; Domhnall, son of Cathal Ua Conchobhair; and Sitric Mac Dubhghaill.&quot;
The Ua Conchobairs brought &quot;the fleets of Dun-Gaillmhe, of Conmhaicne-mara, of the men of Umhall, of Ui-Amhalghadha, and Ui-Fiachrach&quot; north and defeated Mac Lochlainn at Inis Eoghain, but the latter was strong on land, forcing them to respond to incursions in east Connacht and Breifne, along with attempted settlements in Mide in 1155. The latter led to &quot;The castle of Cuileanntrach [being] burned and demolished by Ruaidhri.&quot;

==King of Connacht==

Tairrdelbach died at his capital of Dunmore, County Galway. Ruaidri became king of Connacht &quot;without any opposition&quot;. As a precaution, he arrested three of his twenty-two brothers, &quot;&quot;Brian Breifneach, Brian Luighneach, and Muircheartach Muimhneach&quot;&quot; to prevent them from usurping him; Brian Breifneach was blinded.

On learning of Tairrdelbach&#x27;s death, Mac Lochlainn assumed the High Kingship and began a war of attrition in Leinster and Osraige, using their regional allies against one another.

Over the winter of 1156–57, he positioned a fleet on the River Shannon in anticipation of an attack from Aileach. Yet Mac Lochlainn successfully imposed his own client king in Mide, took hostages from Dermot MacMurrough, evicted the kings of Loígis, Uí Failghe and Osraige, all of whom fled to Connacht. He then subdued all Munster and captured Luimneach. Forced to attack or lose face, Ruaidrí responded by plundering and burning areas around Strabane and Derry. Then, while Mac Lochlainn was returning home to counter him, Ruaidrí entered Munster and overturned Mac Lochlainn&#x27;s political settlement. 

==High King of Ireland==

After the death of Mac Lochlainn in 1166, Ruadhrí rode to Dublin where he was inaugurated as High King of Ireland, arguably the first without opposition. He then celebrated Óenach Tailten, a recognised prerogative of the High Kings, in which he made a number of charitable donations and gifts.

One of Ruadhrí&#x27;s first acts as King was to invade Leinster and expel its king, Dermot Mac Morrough. He then received hostages from all the major lordships and kings of Ireland to show their submission. However, his power base was still in his home Province of Connacht. Dublin was under the rule of Ascaill mac Ragnaill who had submitted to Ruadhrí.

Ruadhrí&#x27;s position in Ireland remained strong until the Norman invasion of Ireland, who had come to aid Dermot mac Morrough regain his throne as king of Leinster. Ruadhrí experienced mixed success fighting the Norman and their rebellious Irish allies, losing much of Leinster, along with the Norse-Gael cities of Waterford and Wexford.

He was, however, able to unite much of the Irish military forces, something not seen since the days of Brian Boru. He allegedly led a massive army of sixty thousand men and a fleet of 30 ships during a campaign to retake the land they had lost to the Normans, in particular Dublin. He drove the Normans out of Kildare and Meath, burning Norman castles at Trim and Kells. This led to the siege of Dublin in 1171. However, the King was defeated after the Normans sallied out to Ruadhrí&#x27;s camp and killed many of the Irish soldiers as they were resting and bathing. After this defeat, Ruadhrí&#x27;s army withdrew.

This army was part of a massive counter-offensive led by the High King which pushed the Normans out of the Midlands and towards Dublin and the east coast. Despite the defeat at Dublin, Ruadhrí managed to keep control of the Midlands.

The Normans managed to conquer northern and southern Leinster, and parts of eastern Munster. However, this was arguably the limit of their expansion during Ruadhrí&#x27;s reign. A Norman expedition into Munster was wiped out by Ruadhrí at the Battle of Thurles, while the northern kings of Oriel and Northern Uí Néill repelled attacks on their kingdoms and raided and plundered much of northern Leinster.

He signed the Treaty of Windsor with King Henry II of England. Whether he was unable or unwilling to, Henry did not or could not control the Norman barons, who continued conquering Irish territory, while Ruadhrí could not control the lesser Irish kings. This led to further conflict which would continue for centuries. Ruadhrí abdicated in 1183, but returned to rule briefly twice after that. Ruadhrí died in the year 1198. He would be the last Gaelic king of Ireland, except for perhaps Brian Ua Néill (died 1260).

==Children and descendants==
The last of Ruaidrí&#x27;s descendants to hold the kingship of Connacht, Aedh mac Ruaidri Ua Conchobair, died in 1233. The Annals of Connacht give the following reason for this:

Aed mac Ruaidri had been five years King of Connacht, as the poet said: &quot;Aed mac Ruaidri of the swift onslaught, five years his rule over the province, till he fell—a loss on every frontier—by the hand of Fedlimid.&quot; Here ends the rule of the children of Ruaidri O Conchobair, King of Ireland. For the Pope offered him the title to [the kingship of] Ireland for himself and his seed for ever, and likewise six wives, if he would renounce the sin of adultery henceforth; and since he would not accept these terms God took the rule and sovranty from his seed for ever, in punishment for his sin.

The annals and genealogies list thirteen children fathered by Ruaidrí. There may have been more.

* Conchobar Ua Conchobair
* Muirchertach Ua Conchobair
* Aedh Muimhnech Ua Conchobair. Had a son, Conchobar, alive in 1236.
* Domnall Mór Ua Conchobair. Had a son, Niall, killed in 1242.
* Aed mac Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, died 1159.
* &quot;The daughter of Ruaidhri Ua Conchobair, wife of [F]laithbertach Ua Maeldoraidh, was killed by the sons of Ua Cairella[i]n&quot; in 1176.
* Rose Ní Conchobair, married Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath about 1180, and had descendants.
* Conchobar Máenmaige Ua Conchobhair, died 1189.
* Diarmait mac Ruaidrí Ó Conchobair, died 1221. Had sons Diarmait (fl. 1237), Donnchad (fl. 1237), Muirchertach (k. 1237) and Cormac.
* Muirghis Cananach Ua Conchobhair, died 1224.
* Nuala Ní Conchobair, died 1226.
* Aedh mac Ruaidri Ó Conchobair, died 1233.
* Toirdhealbhach mac Ruaidhrí Ó Conchobhair, died 1239. Had sons Conchobar Buide and Brian.
* &quot;M1211.8. Raghnailt and Caillech De, two daughters of Roderic O&#x27;Conor, died.&quot;

All of Ruaidrí&#x27;s large number of male progeny faded into obscurity in the first half of the 13th century. The last to be mentioned in the Gaelic-Irish annals was his grandson, Niall son of Domnall Mór, who was killed in 1242.

The result is that there are no demonstratable male-line descendants of Ireland&#x27;s last high-king recorded after the 1240s. All kings of Connacht from 1233 descended from Ruaidrí&#x27;s much younger brother, Cathal Crobhdearg Ua Conchobair. The Ó Conchubhair Donn, the senior member of the entire Síol Muireadaigh dynasty, likewise descends from Cathal Crobhdearg.

Only two of Ruaidrí&#x27;s descendants have ever attempted to claim the Irish High Kingship:

* Brian Ua Néill from 1258 to 1260
* Edward Bruce from 1315 to 1318

<doc id="929531" wikidata="Q6540908" url="?curid=929531" title="Liberalism in Israel">
<text>[[Liberalism]] in [[Israel]] has played a role since the country&#x27;s founding.

Several liberal political parties have claimed substantial popular support, mainly proved by having representation in the Knesset. While liberalism is usually suspicious of nationalism, Jewish liberals in Israel generally support some form of Zionism. They tend to be more receptive towards a Two-state solution.

Conservative liberals (see General Zionists, Liberal Party) were founding members of the Likud, the country&#x27;s main conservative party, while social liberals (see Progressive Party, Independent Liberals) were integrated in the social-democratic Labor Party. Later on, a long-time liberal, anti-clerical and pro-free market party was Shinui, a member of the Liberal International. More recently, Kadima was a broad liberal and centrist party, integrating politicians from the left and the right. Current liberal (and liberal Zionist) parties are Yesh Atid and the Resilience Party (Blue and White). New Hope is a national-liberal party. By contrast, Balad draws upon liberal values in its aim to eliminate discrimination against Arab citizens and redefine Israel as a state for all its citizens rather than a &quot;Jewish and democratic state&quot;, but it is a secular party rather than a liberal one.

<doc id="929532" wikidata="Q1141979" url="?curid=929532" title="Haemophilus influenzae">
<text>Haemophilus influenzae (formerly called Pfeiffer&#x27;s bacillus or Bacillus influenzae) is a Gram-negative, non-motile, coccobacillary, facultatively anaerobic, capnophilic pathogenic bacterium of the family Pasteurellaceae. The bacteria are mesophilic and grow best at temperatures between 35 and 37 °C.

&quot;H. influenzae&quot; was first described in 1893 by Richard Pfeiffer during an influenza pandemic when he incorrectly identified it as the causative microbe, which is why the bacteria was given the name &quot;influenzae&quot;. &quot;H. influenzae&quot; is responsible for a wide range of localized and invasive infections, typically in infants and children, including pneumonia, meningitis, or bloodstream infections. Treatment consists of antibiotics; however, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; is often resistant to the penicillin family, but amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used in mild cases. Serotype B &quot;H. influenzae&quot; have been a major cause of meningitis in infants and small children, frequently causing deafness and mental retardation. However, the development in the 1980s of a vaccine effective in this age group (the Hib vaccine) has almost eliminated this in developed countries.

This species was the first organism to have its entire genome sequenced.

== Physiology and metabolism ==

=== Structure ===
&quot;H. influenzae&quot; is a small Gram-negative bacterium, approximately 0.3 micrometer to 1 micrometer. Like other Gram-negative bacteria, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; has a thin peptidoglycan layer surrounded by an outer membrane containing lipopolysaccharide. Some types of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; contain a polysaccharide capsule around the outer membrane to aid in protection and colonization. The bacteria are pleomorphic, meaning the shape of the bacterium is variable, however it is typically coccobacillus or rod-shaped. &quot;H. Influenzae&quot; contains pili, which are specialized to adhere to the human nasopharynx. The &quot;H. Influenzae&quot; pili, unlike those of &quot;E. coli,&quot; resist unwinding, allowing for stronger adhesion to resist expulsion when coughing or sneezing. A minority of non-typeable, or unencapsulated, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; employ a variety of attachment techniques, such as pili, adhesins, or Hia and Hap proteins. Though the bacteria possess pili, they are not used for traditional movement or motility, and the bacterium is still considered to be non-motile.

The cell wall of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; bacterium contains various proteins, referred to as autotransporters, for adherence and colony formation. &quot;H. influenzae&quot; prefers to bind to mucus linings or non-ciliated epithelial cells, which is facilitated by Hap𝘴 autotransporters in the cell wall binding with unknown receptors within the epithelium. The Hap𝘴 autotransporters also facilitate the formation of microcolonies of the bacteria. These microcolonies are likely responsible for the formation of various biofilms within the body, such as those responsible for middle ear or lung infections.

=== Penicillin binding proteins ===
Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) catalyze steps in peptidoglycan metabolism. They carry out essential processes needed to build and modify the cell wall. These proteins are the targets blocked by penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics that bind to PBPs, hence their name. Some antibiotic-resistant isolates of &quot;H. Influenzae&quot; contain modified PBPs that resist beta-lactam action by producing beta-lactamases to degrade these antibiotics. This resistance is likely due to a N526K mutation, or R517H substitution in conjunction with another unknown mutation. The R517H substitution alone did not have a lower affinity for penicillin, and therefore cannot cause resistance alone. Beta-lactamase emergence in the 1970s caused the therapy for severe cases of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; to be changed from ampicillin to cephalosporins, however further resistance to cephalosporins has occurred due to changes in the transpeptidase domain of penicillin binding protein 3 (PBP3).

=== Serotypes ===
&quot;H. influenzae&quot; isolates were initially characterized as either encapsulated (having an extracellular polysaccharide layer, the bacterial capsule) or unencapsulated. Encapsulated strains were further classified on the basis of the immune response to the type of polysaccharides in their capsule. The six generally recognized types of encapsulated &quot;H. influenzae&quot; are: a, b, c, d, e, and f. &quot;H. Influenzae&quot; type b, also known as Hib, is the most common form, recognizable by its polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule, and found mostly in children. Types a, e, and f have been isolated infrequently, while types d and c are rarely isolated. Unencapsulated strains are more genetically diverse than the encapsulated group. Unencapsulated strains are termed nontypable (NTHi) because they lack capsular serotypes; however, all &quot;H. influenzae&quot; isolates can now be classified by multilocus sequence typing and other molecular methods. Most NTHi strains are considered to be part of the normal human flora in the upper and lower respiratory tract, genitals, and conjunctivae (mucous membranes of the eye).

=== Metabolism ===
&quot;H. influenzae&quot; uses the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway for glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, which is anabolic rather than catabolic. The citric acid cycle is incomplete and lacks several enzymes that are found in a fully functioning cycle. The enzymes missing from the TCA cycle are citrate synthase, aconitate hydratase, and isocitrate dehydrogenase. &quot;H. influenzae&quot; has been found in both aerobic and anaerobic environments, as well as environments with different pH&#x27;s.

==Genome and genetics==
&quot;H. influenzae&quot; was the first free-living organism to have its entire genome sequenced. The sequencing was completed by Craig Venter and his team at the Institute for Genomic Research, now part of the J. Craig Venter Institute. &quot;Haemophilus&quot; was chosen because one of the project leaders, Nobel laureate Hamilton Smith, had been working on it for decades and was able to provide high-quality DNA libraries. The sequencing method used was whole-genome shotgun, which was completed and published in &quot;Science&quot; in 1995.

The genome of strain Rd KW20 consists of 1,830,138 base pairs of DNA in a single circular chromosome that contains 1604 protein-coding genes, 117 pseudogenes, 57 tRNA genes, and 23 other RNA genes. About 90% of the genes have homologs in &quot;E. coli,&quot; another gamma-proteobacterium. In fact, the similarity between genes of the two species ranges from 18% to 98% protein sequence identity, with the majority sharing 40–80% of their amino acids (with an average of 59%).

Conjugative plasmids (DNA molecules that are capable of horizontal transfer between different species of bacteria) can frequently be found in &quot;H. influenzae&quot;. It is common that the F+ plasmid of a competent &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; bacterium conjugates into the &quot;H. influenzae&quot; bacterium, which then allows the plasmid to transfer among &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strands via conjugation.

=== Role of transformation ===
&quot;H. influenzae&quot; mutants defective in their &quot;rec1&quot; gene (a homolog of &quot;recA&quot;) are very susceptible to being killed by the oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide. This finding suggests that &quot;rec1&quot; expression is important for &quot;H. influenzae&quot; survival under conditions of oxidative stress. Since it is a homolog of &quot;recA&quot;, &quot;rec1&quot; likely plays a key role in recombinational repair of DNA damage. Thus, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; may protect its genome against the reactive oxygen species produced by the host&#x27;s phagocytic cells through recombinational repair of oxidative DNA damages. Recombinational repair of a damaged site of a chromosome requires, in addition to &quot;rec1&quot;, a second homologous undamaged DNA molecule. Individual &quot;H. influenzae&quot; cells are capable of taking up homologous DNA from other cells by the process of transformation. Transformation in &quot;H. influenzae&quot; involves at least 15 gene products, and is likely an adaptation for repairing DNA damage in the resident chromosome.

==Culture methods and diagnosis of infections==


===Culture===

Bacterial culture of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; is performed on agar plates. The strongest growth is seen on chocolate agar at 37 °C in a CO2-enriched incubator. The ideal CO2 concentration for the culture is ~5%. However adequate growth is often seen on brain-heart infusion agar supplemented with hemin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) 

Colonies of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; appear as convex, smooth, pale, grey, or transparent colonies with a mild odor&quot;. H. influenzae&quot; will only grow on blood agar if other bacteria are present to release these factors from the red blood cells, forming &#x27;satellite&#x27; colonies around these bacteria. For example, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; will grow in the hemolytic zone of &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; on blood agar plates; the hemolysis of cells by &quot;S. aureus&quot; releases NAD which is needed for its growth. &quot;H. influenzae&quot; will not grow outside the hemolytic zone of &quot;S. aureus&quot; due to the lack of nutrients in these areas.

=== Diagnosis of infections ===
Clinical features of a respiratory tract infection may include initial symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection mimicking a viral infection, usually associated with low-grade fevers. This may progress to the lower respiratory tract within a few days, with features often resembling those of wheezy bronchitis. Sputum may be difficult to expectorate and is often grey or creamy in color. The cough may persist for weeks without appropriate treatment. Many cases are diagnosed after presenting chest infections that do not respond to penicillins or first-generation cephalosporins. A chest X-ray can identify alveolar consolidation.

Clinical diagnosis of invasive &quot;H. influenzae&quot; infection (infection that has spread to the bloodstream and internal tissues) is typically confirmed by bacterial culture, latex particle agglutination tests, or polymerase chain reaction tests on clinical samples obtained from an otherwise sterile body site. In this respect, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; cultured from the nasopharyngeal cavity or throat would not indicate &quot;H. influenzae&quot; disease, because these sites are colonized in disease-free individuals. However, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; isolated from cerebrospinal fluid or blood or joint fluid would indicate invasive &quot;H. influenzae&quot; infection. Microscopic observation of a Gram stained specimen of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; will show Gram-negative coccobacillus. The cultured organism can be further characterized using catalase and oxidase tests, both of which should be positive. Further serological testing is necessary to distinguish the capsular polysaccharide and differentiate between &quot;H. influenzae&quot; b and nonencapsulated strains.

Although highly specific, bacterial culture of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; lacks sensitivity. Use of antibiotics prior to sample collection greatly reduces the isolation rate by killing the bacteria before identification is possible. Recent work has shown that &quot;H. influenzae&quot; uses a highly specialized spectrum of nutrients where lactate is a preferred carbon source.

==== Latex particle agglutination ====
The latex particle agglutination test (LAT) is a more sensitive method to detect &quot;H. influenzae&quot; than is culture. Because the method relies on antigen rather than viable bacteria, the results are not disrupted by prior antibiotic use. It also has the added benefit of being quicker than culture methods. However, antibiotic sensitivity testing is not possible with LAT alone, so a parallel culture is necessary.

==== Molecular methods ====
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been proven to be more sensitive than either LAT or culture tests and are highly specific. These PCR tests can be used for capsular typing of encapsulated &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strains.

==Pathogenicity==
=== Host colonization ===
Many microbes colonize within a host organism. Colonization occurs when a microorganism continues to multiply within the host, without interaction, causing no visible signs of illness or infection. &quot;H. influenzae&quot; colonizes differently in adults than it does young children. Because this bacterium colonizes more rapidly in young children, they are capable of carrying more than one strain of the same bacterium. Once in the adult stage of life, a human is likely to only be carrying one strain as this bacterium does not colonize as aggressively in adults. Nearly all infants will undergo colonization of this bacteria within their first year of life.

&quot;H. influenzae&quot; is generally found within and upon the human body, but can also live on various dry, hard surfaces for up to 12 days.
Most strains of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; are opportunistic pathogens; that is, they usually live in their host without causing disease, but cause problems only when other factors (such as a viral infection, reduced immune function or chronically inflamed tissues, e.g. from allergies) create an opportunity. They infect the host by sticking to the host cell using trimeric autotransporter adhesins.

The pathogenesis of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; infections is not completely understood, although the presence of the polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) capsule in encapsulated type b (Hib), a serotype causing conditions such as epiglottitis, is known to be a major factor in virulence. Their capsule allows them to resist phagocytosis and complement-mediated lysis in the nonimmune host. The unencapsulated strains are almost always less invasive; however, they can produce an inflammatory response in humans, which can lead to many symptoms. Vaccination with Hib conjugate vaccine is effective in preventing Hib infection but does not prevent infection with NTHi strains.

&quot;H. influenzae&quot; can cause respiratory tract infections including pneumonia, otitis media, epiglottitis (swelling in the throat), eye infections and bloodstream infection, meningitis. It can also cause cellulitis (skin infection) and infectious arthritis (inflammation of the joint).

===&quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; type b (Hib) infection===

Naturally acquired disease caused by &quot;H. influenzae&quot; seems to occur in humans only. In healthy children under the age of 5, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; type b was responsible for more than 80% of aggressive infections, before the introduction of the [Hib] vaccine. In infants and young children, &quot;H. influenzae&quot; type b (Hib) causes bacteremia, pneumonia, epiglottitis and acute bacterial meningitis. On occasion, it causes cellulitis, osteomyelitis, and infectious arthritis. It is one cause of neonatal infection.

Due to routine use of the Hib vaccine in the U.S. since 1990, the incidence of invasive Hib disease has decreased to 1.3/100,000 in children. However, Hib remains a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections in infants and children in developing countries where the vaccine is not widely used. Unencapsulated &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strains are unaffected by the Hib vaccine and cause ear infections (otitis media), eye infections (conjunctivitis), and sinusitis in children, and are associated with pneumonia.

==Treatment==
Some strains of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; produce beta-lactamases, and are also able to modify its penicillin-binding proteins, so the bacteria have gained resistance to the penicillin family of antibiotics. In severe cases, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone delivered directly into the bloodstream are the elected antibiotics, and, for the less severe cases, an association of ampicillin and sulbactam, cephalosporins of the second and third generation, or fluoroquinolones are preferred. (Fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of &quot;H. influenzae&quot; have been observed).

Macrolides and fluoroquinolones have activity against non-typeable &quot;H. influenzae&quot; and could be used in patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, macrolide resistance has also been observed.

==Serious and chronic complications==
The serious complications of HiB are brain damage, hearing loss, and even death. While non-typable &quot;H. influenzae&quot; strains rarely cause serious disease, they are more likely to cause chronic infections because they have the ability to change their surface antigens. Chronic infections are usually not as serious as acute infections.

There are a few other possible diseases and conditions that can arise from the &quot;H. influenzae&quot; depending on the areas that they exist in within the human body. This bacterium can exist in the nasal passages (especially the nasopharynx), the ear canal, and the lungs. The bacterium&#x27;s presence in these areas can lead to some conditions such as otitis media, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), epiglottitis, and asthma which can become severe.

== Vaccination ==

Effective vaccines for &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; serotype b have been available since the early 1990s, and are recommended for children under age 5 and asplenic patients. The World Health Organization recommends a pentavalent vaccine, combining vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B and Hib. There is not yet sufficient evidence on how effective this pentavalent vaccine is in relation to the individual vaccines.

Hib vaccines cost about seven times the total cost of vaccines against measles, polio, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. Consequently, whereas 92% of the populations of developed countries were vaccinated against Hib as of 2023, vaccination coverage was 77% globally 94% for European countries, and only 33% for people living in the western pacific region.

The Hib vaccines do not provide cross-protection to any other &quot;H. influenzae&quot; serotypes like Hia, Hic, Hid, Hie or Hif.

An oral vaccination has been developed for non-typeable &quot;H.&quot; &quot;influenzae&quot; (NTHi) for patients with chronic bronchitis, but it has not shown to be effective in reducing the number and severity of COPD exacerbations. However, there is no effective vaccine for the other types of capsulated &quot;H. influenzae&quot; or NTHi.

Vaccines that target unencapsulated &quot;H. influenzae&quot; serotypes are in development.

<text>BlitzMail was an e-mail system used at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, United States. It was one of the earliest e-mail server/client packages. Use of BlitzMail ended in 2011, in favor of a Microsoft suite of email/online collaboration programs, but students still use the term &quot;blitz&quot; rather than &quot;email.&quot;

== History ==
BlitzMail was developed by Dartmouth in 1987 and went live in the summer of 1988. The name &quot;BlitzMail&quot; started as a joke among its programmers, as it had to be developed quickly. 

In 1991, when Dartmouth required every student to own a computer, the server code was updated to allow multiple servers to accommodate the heavy demand for the system. In 1993, the server was rewritten to support mail folders. In 1994, the client and server software was released for use outside of Dartmouth. Some non-Dartmouth BlitzMail deployments include Valley.Net, an internet service provider in New England&#x27;s Upper Valley region and, from 1991 to 2005, Reed College in Portland, Oregon. 

The first versions of the client ran only on the Apple Macintosh operating system. The client was ported to Windows around the time of Windows 3.1. 

Dartmouth&#x27;s Computing Services rolled out an updated BlitzMail client for Mac OS X that featured encrypted client-server communications. Developed in May 2006 by computer science doctoral candidate Chris Masone, the software became available in late 2007. Version 2.9 for Mac OS X 10.3 was available beginning in October 2008.

Recent releases of the client have experimental support for rendering (but not composing) HTML-based messages.

A project at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center continued to use the Windows BlitzMail service, which was no longer being developed or supported. Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center BlitzMail servers were scheduled to be deactivated on October 1, 2012. A Microsoft suite developed by email/online program collaborators was released to fill in its role.

== Dartmouth College ==
BlitzMail became the primary means of communication of all types on the Dartmouth College campus, between students, professors, and administrators. Hundreds of public terminals were located around campus, in libraries, dining halls, and academic buildings. In the mid-1990s, Mac Classic public terminals were commonly referred to as &quot;Blitzcheckers.&quot; Additionally, &quot;blitz&quot; became used as a noun and verb, used the same way &quot;email&quot; might be. While BlitzMail is no longer used, students as of 2020 still use &quot;blitz&quot; instead of &quot;email.&quot;

Until the mid-2000s, largely due to poor cellular reception on campus, many students opted to use BlitzMail rather than cellular phones, but this trend decreased as service improved on campus. In 2006, students began checking blitz on their cell phones.

== Client ==
The BlitzMail client was graphical, and ran on Windows and Macintosh computers. Several Java implementations exist, as well as web-based clients, such as NetBlitz and WebBlitz. The client has not had major updates since the late 1990s, with the exception of a port to Mac OS X. The client does not officially support HTML-based e-mail, dealing only in plaintext. (HTML files are viewed as attachments.) There is unofficial support to allow HTML-based email to be opened within the client normally.

The program is portable for users. A user&#x27;s mailbox, address book, and preferences are all stored on the server. Any user can log into any installation of the client and have full access to their data. After a user logs out, no data or personalization is stored on the local machine. This feature allows the use of the many public terminals.

BlitzMail also acted as a pseudo-instant messaging client. Messages were processed by the server and delivered to the recipient almost immediately. 

The program was integrated with the Dartmouth Name Directory (DND), allowing users to message any recipient with a Dartmouth email address by searching for their name.

== Technical specifications ==
BlitzMail speaks its own protocol between client and server, meaning that only the BlitzMail client can utilize the full feature-set of the server.

Messages entering and leaving the BlitzMail domain are handled via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). , patches were available that allowed clients to connect to a BlitzMail server via POP3 and IMAP (with SSL.) The client communicates to the server on TCP ports 2151 and 1119 and the notification service runs on UDP port 2154.

In 2002, SpamAssassin functionality was added to BlitzMail. The DND server was also modified to allow LDAP lookups.

The BlitzMail and DND servers run on DEC Unix and many Linux flavors. The OS must support POSIX threading or Mach kernel-style cthreads. The server will run on systems with very low hardware requirements.

The BlitzMail servers have run on a variety of hardware at Dartmouth. In the early 1990s, the mail and DND servers ran on 25 MHz NeXT cubes named after Santa Claus&#x27; reindeer. At the time, hundreds of sessions could be handled on each machine. Later, the servers were migrated to DEC 3000 AXP Model 300s.

A Python library implementation called PyBlitz was released in 2006 by Michael Fromberger.

The BlitzMail client and server software were available under an BSD-style (with ad clause) license.

<doc id="929536" wikidata="Q10327021" url="?curid=929536" title="Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions">
<text>Marvel Super Hero Contest of Champions is a three-issue comic book limited series published from June to August 1982 by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Mark Gruenwald, with art by John Romita Jr. and Bob Layton.

This series was significant as it was Marvel&#x27;s first published limited series. &quot;Contest of Champions&quot; brought forth the idea of a major event affecting the Marvel Universe; it introduced crossovers before the concept of multi-title crossovers was even conceived.

An unrelated five issue limited series published in 1999, &quot;Contest of Champions II&quot;, is a sequel in title only.

==Publication history==
The story was intended to be a celebration of the 1980 Summer Olympics held in Moscow, and depicted Marvel superheroes engaging in competitions. The plan was scuttled when the United States refused to participate in the summer games, as a protest against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979. The comic was already mostly-complete, so Marvel published &quot;Contest of Champions&quot; two years later, with a reworked storyline that avoided any connection to the Olympics.

==Plot summary==
An Elder of the Universe, the Grandmaster, challenges a hooded female called the &quot;Unknown&quot;—eventually revealed to be Death—to a game for the life of his fellow Elder, the Collector (killed by the cosmic being Korvac in the title &quot;Avengers&quot;). The pair decide to use various superheroes from Earth as pawns, the goal being to collect the four pieces of a prize called the &quot;Golden Globe of Life&quot;. A victory for the Grandmaster&#x27;s team means the Collector may be resurrected, while a loss indicates the character must remain dead.

The Grandmaster&#x27;s team consists of Captain America, Talisman,
Darkstar, Captain Britain, Wolverine, Defensor, Sasquatch, Daredevil, Peregrine, She-Hulk, the Thing, and Blitzkrieg.

Death&#x27;s team consists of Iron Man, Vanguard, Iron Fist, Shamrock, Storm, Arabian Knight, Sabra, Invisible Girl, Angel, Black Panther, Sunfire, and the Collective Man.

Although the storyline depicts a tie and the Grandmaster&#x27;s team is written as being successful, Death advises that the Collector can only be resurrected if the Grandmaster takes his fellow Elder&#x27;s place in the Realm of the Dead, with the character agreeing to the terms. International heroes Blitzkrieg (Germany); Collective Man (China); Defensor (Argentina); Peregrine (France); Shamrock (Ireland); and Talisman (Australia) debut in the series, and each issue contained a catalogue of all featured heroes and was the prototype for the publication the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;.

In 2015 &quot;Deadpool&#x27;s Secret Secret Wars&quot; revealed that alongside the main contest a bonus round occurred featuring lesser-to-unknown characters. The Grandmaster&#x27;s team consists of Rocket Racer, She-Man-Thing, The Vile Tapeworm, and Frog-Man. Death&#x27;s team consists of Deadpool, Howard the Duck, Doop and The Pink Sphinx. Death&#x27;s team wins, the prize being a &#x27;participant&#x27; trophy.

An &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; eventually reveals that this was a ruse perpetrated by the Grandmaster as he is able to steal Death&#x27;s powers and then, via another deception, forces the entity to banish all Elders from her realm, effectively making them immortal.

==&quot;Contest of Champions&quot; (2015)==

In the aftermath of &quot;Secret Wars&quot;, the Collector and Grandmaster put in motion another Contest of Champions. They use the remnants of Doom&#x27;s Battleworld as their base of operations which becomes known as the Battlerealm, with the prize being an artifact called the Iso-Sphere.

==In other media==
===Television===
* A version of the Contest of Champions storyline was adapted in &quot;Fantastic Four: World&#x27;s Greatest Heroes&quot;. In this version, the Grandmaster pits the Fantastic Four against Ronan the Accuser, Impossible Man, Annihilus, and the Super-Skrull. In the end, the Thing defeats Ronan and saves Earth from destruction.
* A variation of the Contest of Champions was adapted in the self-titled four-part season three finale of &quot;Ultimate Spider-Man&quot;. As opposed to the comic book storyline, Spider-Man teams up with the Avengers, the New Warriors, the Agents of S.M.A.S.H., and the Collector to save Earth from the Grandmaster and his army of supervillains. Ultimately, Spider-Man and the Collector defeat the Grandmaster and saves Earth from destruction.

===Film===
* In &quot;&quot;, the Contest of Champions is the name of the gladiatorial event the Grandmaster runs on Sakaar. In the film, Thor is forced to do battle with the Hulk in the contest.

===Video games===
* The comic book was adapted into a 2014 fighting game for Android and iOS with a similar title, &quot;&quot;.

===Miscellaneous===
* Scott Lobdell began submitting stories for Marvel, based on these characters for short stories in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot;.

<text>Duping refers to the practice of using a bug in a video game to illegitimately create duplicates of unique items or currency in a persistent online game, such as an MMOG. Duping can vastly destabilize a virtual economy or even the gameplay itself, depending on the item duplicated and the rate at which duplication occurs. Modern persistent world games include automated detection of duping. Duping is usually considered to be a game cheat.

==Effects==
The effect of duping on a game&#x27;s economy depends on whether an item or currency was being duplicated and to what degree the duping took place. Currency dupes cause inflation and conversely item dupes cause the item to lose value.
On 7 November 2003 in the MMORPG &quot;RuneScape&quot;, an extremely rare item, the Magenta Party hat (now the Purple Party hat) was duped well over 2 million times; the effects are still seen today in the game&#x27;s economy. While Jagex, the game&#x27;s owners, did everything they could to ban the duping users, the duped party hats are still circulating. Due to the fact that the discontinued items, party-hats, were no longer available, the purple party-hat being duped caused it to become the cheapest hat. While its price is still high for an item, it is considered &quot;the noob&#x27;s party-hat&quot;.

When currency is duplicated, it increases the overall amount of money in the virtual economy and increases prices in player-to-player transactions. In a 2005 case of currency duping in &quot;EverQuest II&quot;, the game&#x27;s developers noticed an unexpected 20% rise in the total money found in the economy over a 24-hour period following the dissemination of the dupe. A significant currency dupe in &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; was found after the designers compared how much money was created versus how much money was destroyed and noted that, despite more money leaving the system than entering, they observed no shortage of money in the virtual world.

Item dupes generally have the opposite effect, causing the price of the duped items to drop as the supply of that item increases.

In addition to the effects on the game economy, the sudden influx of currency or items also affects players involved in real-money trading. In the &quot;EverQuest II&quot; case, the dupers attempted to sell the illegitimate currency on Station Exchange for real money and supposedly made over US$70,000 from online auctions. Dupes are highly prized among those involved in real-money trading, and in this form it has been likened to counterfeiting except with reduced risk.

==Response==
As with other exploits, a common response to duping is to ban the involved players. Banning players for duping can be controversial though depending on how the game developer determines a player to be &quot;involved&quot; in the dupe. In &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; some players learned how to dupe the currency. Sony Online Entertainment (SOE) banned players who possessed duped currency. It is alleged that people who were not directly involved in the exploit, but who accepted duped currency in legitimate trade were also banned. In reaction to what was perceived to be an unjust punishment, several players joined a mass demonstration at a central location in the game world. SOE responded to the disruption caused by the large gathering by teleporting all player characters involved away from the demonstration area. A popular online urban legend is that many player characters were teleported into space, essentially killing them. Although evidence as to whether or not this occurred cannot be substantiated, it has been voiced in many popular gaming avenues, such as &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;.

Another method to mitigate the effects of duping would be a rollback, in which game data is reset to an earlier data backup prior to the first known instance of duping. This can include all game data or be limited to specific items, characters, or other means determined to be involved in the duping. Significant rollbacks can be a highly unpopular decision with the players and is best done before much time has passed. Alternately, SOE was able to track and remove the duped currency in &quot;EverQuest II&quot;.

The virtual world designers may find more natural ways to remove the offending currency or items from the game. In &quot;Star Wars Galaxies&quot; the legitimate economy had been losing money faster than money was being created due to a variety of money sinks. After the dupe bug was fixed and trillions of potentially duped in-game currency deleted, the designers decided to let the economy to continue running at a net loss until the levels could return to normal.

An immediate, although often temporary, step to prevent further issues from duping calls for aspects of the game to be disabled until the exploit can be addressed permanently. SOE stopped Station Exchange auctions to prevent the dupers from selling the illegitimate &quot;EverQuest II&quot; currency.

==Other notable cases==

The video game &quot;Phantasy Star Online Episode I &amp; II&quot; had a duping glitch, which was activated by talking repeatedly with a walking NPC and a merchant. Because the characters and data of the game were saved on memory cards, SEGA could not remove the duping glitch, and the online game was filled with duped items and money.

In the Xbox 360 game &quot;Forza Motorsport 2&quot;, there was a duping glitch which enabled the player to sell car upgrades they had not yet purchased. By selecting an upgrade, and quickly pressing X, the player is able to have the option to sell the upgrade, without having to buy it first. This caused the Auction House to become flawed, because players who had earned their money via the glitch, were able to out-buy players that only had money they have gotten through races. There is a patch to fix the glitch, but players can still perform it, and transfer the money onto another account.

<text>Beverly Mills Vincent (March 28, 1890 – August 15, 1980) was a U.S. representative from Kentucky.

He was born in Brownsville, Edmonson County, Kentucky, March 28, 1890; attended the public schools, Western Kentucky State Teachers College at Bowling Green, and the law department of the University of Kentucky at Lexington; was admitted to the bar in 1915 and commenced practice in Brownsville, Kentucky. He was county judge of Edmonson County, Kentucky from 1916 to 1918.

During the First World War he served as a private in Battery A, 72nd Field Artillery Regiment at Camp Knox, Kentucky, from August 27, 1918, to January 9, 1919.

He was an assistant attorney general of Kentucky in 1919–20; a member of the Kentucky Senate in 1928–1932 and presidential elector for the Democratic ticket in 1932. He was elected attorney general of Kentucky in 1935, serving from 1936 until his resignation in March 1937, when he wad nominated by the Democratic Party to as its candidate in a special election to fill the vacancy caused by the death of United States Representative Glover H. Cary of Owensboro, and was elected to fill the unexpired trem. He was elected to the three succeeding Congresses (March 2, 1937 – January 3, 1945).

In 1940, Congressman Vincent struck Congressman Martin Sweeney on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives as the House debated conscription during World War II. Sweeney opposed the draft bill; Vincent called him a &quot;traitor&quot;, which led to the fistfight. As quoted in &quot;Time&quot; magazine &quot;ancient Doorkeeper Joseph Sinnot [who favored the draft] said it was the best blow he had heard in his 50 years in the House.&quot;

He filed for re-election for the Seventy-ninth Congress in 1944, but withdrew, ceding the nomination to state Senate Majority Leader Earle Clements of Morganfield, who had challenged him. He ran unsuccessfully for the state Court of Appeals in 1958 and the Senate in 1969. He resumed the practice of law, pursued agricultural interests, and was a resident of Brownsville, Kentucky, until his death there on August 15, 1980.

<doc id="929556" wikidata="Q5907728" url="?curid=929556" title="Ian Marter">
<text>Ian Don Marter (28 October 194428 October 1986) was an English actor and writer known for his role as Harry Sullivan in the BBC science-fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; from December 1974 to September 1975, with a non-regular, one-serial return in November and December 1975. He sometimes used the pseudonym Ian Don.

==Early life==
Born in Warwickshire, the son of Donald Marter and his wife Helen Donaldson, Marter attended Beckenham and Penge Grammar School and was awarded a scholarship to St Edmund Hall, Oxford where he read English language and literature and was involved in the college&#x27;s drama society. Marter graduated from St Edmund Hall in 1966 and started work at the Bristol Old Vic theatre, where he served as a stage manager in addition to acting in stage roles.

==&quot;Doctor Who&quot;==

===Actor===
In 1971, Marter auditioned for the regular role of Captain Mike Yates in the eighth season of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He was offered the part, but was unable to accept due to a prior commitment. The production team were sufficiently impressed that they kept him in mind and cast him in a supporting role in the 1973 story &quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot;, broadcast as part of the tenth season of the programme.

The following year, Marter was cast in the role of Harry Sullivan, a character developed by the production team on the basis that the incoming Fourth Doctor could be portrayed by an older actor who would not be able to handle the more physical action scenes. After 40-year-old Tom Baker was cast, such concerns were allayed and Harry was written out after only one season.

Television appearances

*&quot;Carnival of Monsters&quot; (as John Andrews)
*&quot;Robot&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;The Ark in Space&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;The Sontaran Experiment&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;Genesis of the Daleks&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;Revenge of the Cybermen&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;Terror of the Zygons&quot; (as Harry Sullivan)
*&quot;The Android Invasion&quot; (episodes 2–4 as an Android impersonating Harry Sullivan, episode 4 as Harry Sullivan.)
===Author===
Marter remained involved with &quot;Doctor Who&quot; after his departure from the regular cast. He co-wrote the script for a feature film version, provisionally titled &quot;Doctor Who Meets Scratchman&quot; (also known as &quot;Doctor Who and the Big Game&quot;), in collaboration with Baker and director James Hill; due to a lack of funding, the project was ultimately abandoned. Marter&#x27;s plot concerned Baker&#x27;s Doctor coming face to face with Scratchman (an ancient term for the Devil); the finale was to have been acted out on a colossal pinball table, with the holes in the table being portals to other dimensions. Eventually, in 2019, a novelization of this story by Baker and James Goss, simply titled &quot;Scratchman&quot;, was released by BBC Books, dedicated to Marter ().

Marter later became involved with the writing of novelisations of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; TV serials for Target Books, penning nine such adaptations in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Marter&#x27;s novelisations were somewhat controversial, most notably when the word &quot;bastard&quot; appeared in his novelisation of the 1967 story &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot;. The last of Marter&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations was &quot;The Rescue&quot;, which had to be completed by range editor Nigel Robinson due to Marter&#x27;s unexpected death. Marter was one of a small group of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actors to write licensed fiction based on the series.

Marter also wrote an original spin-off novel for Target, &quot;Harry Sullivan&#x27;s War&quot;, featuring the return of his character, which was published in 1986 and was one of the earliest original &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-related novels to be released. Marter had been planning both a sequel to this novel and an adaptation of his unused &quot;Doctor Who Meets Scratchman&quot; script at the time of his death.

==Later career==

===Actor===
Marter&#x27;s acting career beyond &quot;Doctor Who&quot; comprised mainly roles in episodes of series such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Brothers&quot; (1972), &quot;Crown Court&quot;, &quot;Bergerac&quot; (1981) and Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;The Return of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1986). He also had minor roles in several films, such as &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; (1967), &quot;The Abominable Dr. Phibes&quot; (1971), &quot;North and South&quot;, &quot;The Medusa Touch&quot; (1978), and the comedy short &quot;The Waterloo Bridge Handicap&quot; (1978). Marter lived and worked in New Zealand in the early 1980s, appearing in the soap opera &quot;Close to Home&quot; from 1982.

===Author===
In addition to his &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations, Marter wrote adaptations of several 1980s American films such as &quot;Splash&quot; and &quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; for Target and its imprint, Star Books. Some of these books were published under the pen name Ian Don.

Other novelizations:

*&quot;Splash&quot; (as Ian Don, Touchstone, Star Books, 1984)
*&quot;Baby&quot; (as Ian Don, Disney, Star Books, 1985)
*&quot;My Science Project&quot; (as Ian Don, Touchstone, Target Books, 1985)
*&quot;Down and Out in Beverly Hills&quot; (as Ian Marter, Touchstone, Star Books, 1986)
*&quot;Tough Guys&quot; (as Ian Don, Touchstone, Star Books, 1986)

Gummi Bears Picture Books:
*&quot;Book 1 Disney&#x27;s Gummi Bears: Zummi Makes It Hot&quot; (as Ian Don, Disney, Target Books, 1986)
*&quot;Book 2 Disney&#x27;s Gummi Bears: Gummi In A Gilded Cage&quot; (as Ian Don, Disney, Target Books, 1986)
*&quot;Book 3 Disney&#x27;s Gummi Bears: The Secret of the Juice&quot; (as Ian Don, Disney, Target Books, 1986)
*&quot;Book 4 Disney&#x27;s Gummi Bears: Light Makes Right&quot; (as Ian Don, Disney, Target Books, 1986)

==Personal life==
According to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; co-star Nicholas Courtney, Marter had come out to him as bisexual. He and his wife divorced.

Marter died in 1986, on his 42nd birthday, from a heart attack associated with diabetes-related cardiovascular disease.

<text>Isadore Blumenfeld (September 8, 1900 – June 21, 1981), commonly known as Kid Cann, was a Romanian-born Jewish-American organized crime enforcer based in Minneapolis, Minnesota, for over four decades. He remains the most notorious mobster in the history of Minnesota. He was associated with several high-profile crimes in the city&#x27;s history. He was tried and acquitted for the 1924 murder of cab driver Charles Goldberg. Blumenfeld was also present at the scene of the attempted murder by Verne Miller of Minneapolis Police Department officer James H. Trepanier. Blumenfeld was also tried and acquitted for personally firing the murder weapon, a Thompson submachine gun, in the globally infamous December 1935 contract killing of Twin Cities investigative journalist Walter Liggett. He was also unsuccessfully prosecuted in Federal Court for both conspiracy and racketeering in the mobbed up hostile takeover and dismantling of the Twin City Rapid Transit streetcar system during the early 1950s.

Blumenfeld was convicted of violating the Federal Mann Act in 1959 and of attempted jury tampering in 1961. After a short prison term, Blumenfeld retired to Miami Beach, Florida, where he and Meyer Lansky operated a real estate empire. He remained involved in organized crime until his death and left behind an estimated $10 million fortune.

==Life==
===Early life===
Blumenfeld was born in 1900 in the Romanian shtetl of Râmnicu Sărat, Buzău County, to an Orthodox Jewish family. According to U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service documents, his parents emigrated to America in 1902 via the port of Duluth, Minnesota. His father, a Romanian Jewish furrier named Phillip Blumenfeld, settled his wife Eva Blumenfeld (née Abromowitz) at 824 S. Seventh Street Minneapolis. During childhood, Isadore had to leave school and support his family by selling newspapers on Minneapolis&#x27; &quot;Newspaper Row.&quot; At the time, the best selling locations had to be held by force against gangs of other boys. Blumenfeld would also tell stories of how he had made extra money picking up bus tokens and reselling them. Enraged by the poverty of his family, he turned to running errands for the pimps and madams of Minneapolis&#x27;s red light district.

Two tales are told of the origins of his famous nickname. According to one legend, he picked up the name during a brief attempt at boxing. Another story told by his fellow North Side Jews alleges that young Isadore Blumenfeld would always lock himself in the outhouse (that is, the &quot;can&quot;) to avoid gang fights in the neighborhood. Kid Cann indignantly denied both versions. Journalist Neal Karlen confirms that both stories were false, &quot;Kid enjoyed not only fighting, but killing.&quot;

===Prohibition===
With the onset of Prohibition, Kid Cann and his brothers Harry Bloom and Jacob Blumenfeld (alias &quot;Dandy&quot; and &quot;Yiddy Bloom&quot;), were transformed from small-time hoods into major organized crime figures in association with the American Mafia. 

By his 20s, Blumenfeld and his brothers held considerable power over criminal activities in Minneapolis and oversaw bootlegging, illegal gambling, prostitution, extortion, and labor racketeering. Neil Karlen has described their organization as, &quot;led by the Kid on machine gun and Harry and Yiddy Bloom on brains.&quot;

Their ties to the Chicago Outfit and New York City&#x27;s Genovese crime family date back to the Prohibition period.

According to a later trial, they would legally import industrial grade alcohol from Samuel Bronfmans distillery in Montreal, which was shipped across the Great Lakes to Duluth, and then driven on souped up Ford automobiles to the La Pompoudor &quot;perfume factory&quot; in the Twin Cities. The brothers also ran illegal distilleries in the forests near Fort Snelling.

According to historian Elaine Davis, Kid Cann and his brothers, like many other organized crime figures from the Twin Cities, Chicago, and Kansas City, made frequent trips to Stearns and Morrison Counties to purchase Minnesota 13; a very high quality moonshine distilled locally by Polish- and German-American farmers with the collusion of local politicians and law enforcement. Davis writes that the main go-between connecting local moonshiners with organized crime was Melrose resident &quot;Chick&quot; Molitor, who lived with his family on a dairy farm near Big Birch Lake. The Blumenfelds, with whom Molitor had a very close business relationship, visited the area so often that they allegedly owned property south of the Rock Tavern in Melrose.

According to Twin Cities crime reporter Paul Maccabee, Kid Cann&#x27;s rivalry with Minneapolis&#x27;s Irish Mob ended after he and Irish Mob bosses Big Ed Morgan and Tommy Banks divided the city with a handshake.

A number of deaths are attributed to Blumenfeld and his gang, including journalists who were killed after writing articles exposing the inner workings of his organization as well as his ties to corrupt politicians from several parties. A Jewish restaurant owner who recalls this era once said that the Blumenfelds were worshipped by several generations of neighborhood boys.

There was a high degree of political and civil corruption in the region in the 1920s and 1930s. The mainstream newspapers hardly mentioned what was going on, as any outlet that published articles critical of the status quo was threatened. Some small tabloid newspapers attempted to report what was going on, but reporters and editors quickly became targets. Howard Guilford of the &quot;Twin City Reporter&quot; was shot and killed on September 6, 1934.

Sports journalist Sid Hartman, who grew up in a poor Russian Jewish family in North Minneapolis, was an eleven year old newspaper peddler when he was brought by &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; street circulation manager Joseph Katzman into the upper room at Jack Doyle&#x27;s restaurant on Hennepin Avenue between Fourth and Fifth Streets. At the time, the restaurant was downstairs and upstairs was one of the largest sports betting operations in Minneapolis. Kid Cann, Tommy Banks, and the Berman Brothers were regular visitors and Hartman&#x27;s decades long friendship with them began during those years.

From their headquarters at &quot;The Flame&quot; jazz club in Minneapolis&#x27; Washington Avenue Gateway District, the AZ Syndicate also committed many other crimes.

According to Hartman, &quot;Kid Cann would bring in Sophie Tucker, Cab Calloway - entertainers like that - to appear at his club. Then, after hours, they would close the doors and the real show would begin. One time, the cops came barging in at 4am, took us all out, and put everyone in the Paddy wagon. If they had booked me with the rest of the people, I probably would have made the newspaper and lost my job at the &quot;Tribune&quot;. I did some begging and the cops let me go.&quot;

On August 23, 1933, a Federal grand jury in Oklahoma City indicted Blumenfeld for money laundering. 
The $200,000 ransom Machine Gun Kelly had received following the kidnapping of oil man Charles F. Urschel had been traced to Hennepin State Bank in Minneapolis. Blumenfeld was arrested and transported to Oklahoma City to await his trial. Minneapolis Police Chief Joseph Lehmeyer traveled down to Oklahoma City to testify in favor of Kid Cann and the charges were dropped.

In December 1933, the AZ Syndicate&#x27;s accountant, Conrad Althen, who had become a secret informant for the Internal Revenue Service and whom according to Paul Maccabee &quot;knew where every penny and body was buried&quot;, was thrown out of a car into a Dakota County cornfield and shot to death with a Thompson submachine gun.

===After Prohibition===
Following the end of Prohibition, Blumenfeld and his family continued to maintain control over the now legal liquor industry and owned, &quot;all the big liquor stores; East Hennepin, Loring Liquors, and Lake Street. They monopolized the liquor business, and that&#x27;s why they had so many enemies.&quot;

According to an internal FBI memo, &quot;It is impossible to operate any place in Minneapolis without first getting permission from the Syndicate, and if a place is operated without obtaining such permission, the Syndicate sees to it that the new place is immediately closed.&quot;

===The Liggett murder===
The most notorious murder was that of Walter Liggett, one of the founders of the Farmer-Labor Party and the editor of a weekly newspaper called &quot;The Midwest American&quot;.

As part of what was termed the &quot;Ligget-Townley Revolt&quot; against Farmer Labor Party leader and Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson, Ligget began reporting on links he found between Twin Cities Irish and Jewish organized crime and senior politicians from the Farmer-Labor Party. Beginning on June 29, 1935, every issue of &quot;The Midwest American&quot; printed ten reasons for impeaching Governor Olson, including political corruption and collusion with organized crime.

Throughout September 1935, Liggett reported on &quot;a wet-councilmanic ring&quot; which allowed &quot;The Syndicate&quot;, led by the Blumenfeld brothers, to dominate the newly legalized liquor trade in Minneapolis. During the same month, &quot;The Midwest American&quot; also published articles about Kid Cann&#x27;s criminal history and how associate Meyer Schuldberg employed him as a &quot;salesman&quot; for &quot;La Pompadour&quot; perfume factory during Prohibition, which had switched since repeal to producing Chesapeake Brands Liquors. Liggett also alleged that the Blumenfelds had been so certain that the city council would grant them a license for Lake Street liquors, that they had begun buying advertisements ten days before the council&#x27;s vote.

After announcing in print that he had refused offers of both bribes and paid advertisements by AZ Syndicate-controlled businesses, Liggett reported on October 2, 1935, that Minneapolis aldermen Henry Banks and Romeo Riley had both attended the prizefight between Joe Louis and Max Baer as personal guests of Kid Cann. Liggett also reported that State Liquor Commissioner David Arundel had also attended the fight as a guest of Farmer-Labor fixer and Syndicate liquor lobbyist Fred Ossanna.

According to Neal Karlen, Kid Cann allegedly claimed to fellow members of Minneapolis&#x27; criminal underworld that Liggett was using &quot;The Midwest American&quot; to try and extort money from &quot;him&quot;. Blumenfeld allegedly also believed that no journalist would ever dare to report Governor Olson&#x27;s ties to the AZ Syndicate and was outraged when Liggett did so.

Liggett was beaten up, prosecuted for a non-existent rape incident, and finally died after being machine gunned in the alley behind his home on December 9, 1935. His wife and daughter witnessed the assassination as did several neighbors. All identified Kid Cann as the shooter. Kid Cann was indicted by a grand jury and, on January 29, 1936, his trial began, where he was prosecuted jointly by the Hennepin County Attorney and the State&#x27;s Attorney&#x27;s Office.

Meanwhile, Kid Cann&#x27;s younger half-brother Jacob Blumenfeld, alias &quot;Yiddy Bloom&quot;, whom many sources allege to have been the acting boss of the organization, resurfaced in Paris. In an interview with the &quot;Washington Times&quot;, Jacob Blumenfeld called Liggett&#x27;s murder, &quot;a terrible extreme, but what the hell. Liggett persecuted the AZ Syndicate, which only wanted to live in peace with him. He was fiercely honest and became ridiculously inconvenient.&quot;

Poor investigative work and a careless trial, however, meant that Kid Cann was acquitted. Edith Liggett always believed that Minnesota Governor Floyd Olson and Farmer-Labor Party fixer Charles Ward were responsible for setting up her husband&#x27;s murder. Liggett had repeatedly accused the Governor in print of having links to organized crime.

===Other crimes===
Although indicted for shooting dead taxicab driver Charles Goldberg and arrested for the attempted murder of police officer James H. Trepanier, who was left paralyzed, Blumenfeld continued to avoid conviction for serious crimes.

According to Twin Cities crime historian Paul Maccabee, FBI files reveal that rival Minneapolis Jewish mob boss David Berman contributed very heavily to Marvin L. Kline&#x27;s mayoral campaign under the understanding that Berman would receive a monopoly over illegal gambling in Minneapolis. Therefore, during Kline&#x27;s 1941–1945 term as Mayor, Berman briefly eclipsed the Blumenfelds and became the leader of the Minneapolis criminal underworld.

In 1942, FBI documents described Kid Cann as the, &quot;recognized leader of graft and racketeering in Minneapolis&quot;. They added that Blumenfeld was, &quot;known to have corrupted City and County officials... and has been known to harbor criminals of various types.&quot; The files also report that Kid Cann often boasted that he had the Minneapolis City Council, &quot;in the palm of his hand.&quot;

FBI files also allege that Kid Cann was involved with Bugsy Siegel in the running of the El Cortez Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The December 1944 issue of the &quot;Public Press&quot;, edited by Walter Liggett-style anti-corruption crusader Arthur Kasherman, featured the headline &quot;Kline Administration Most Corrupt Regime in the History of the City&quot;. A month later, on the night of Jan. 22, 1945, Kasherman was ambushed after eating dinner with a friend and shot dead on a sidewalk at 15th and Chicago avenues in Minneapolis. His murder made the front pages of newspapers across the Twin Cities, but few in Minneapolis were surprised when the police investigation was quickly shut down.

Public outrage over Kasherman&#x27;s murder led, however, to the first term of Hubert Humphrey, who ran for the Minneapolis mayor&#x27;s office promising to be a racket buster. According to historian Paul Maccabee, however, Humphrey succeeded only in shutting down the far more visible criminal operations of David Berman and leaving those of Tommy Banks and the Blumenfelds largely unscathed. Berman and his associates then moved their operations to Las Vegas, Nevada and left the Blumenfelds to take their place in Minneapolis.

According to journalists Neal Karlen and Bob Patrin, Blumenfeld and his brothers made three verbal requests to Frank Fietek, the owner of the &quot;Swing City&quot; jazz club at 1682 Rice Street in St. Paul, to either pay protection money to them or hand over control of his club. When Fietek allegedly refused the third time, he was abducted and was dumped with two broken legs on County Road D. When a permanently crippled Fietek still refused to pay, his club was the target of an arson attack in November 1945. In response to Fietek&#x27;s continued refusal to sell, Kid Cann was allegedly responsible for Fietek&#x27;s murder by strangulation on March 4, 1946. No one, however, was ever indicted or prosecuted.

As the electric streetcar system, operated by Twin City Rapid Transit, was being dismantled in the early 1950s and replaced with diesel buses, Blumenfeld owned a 16% stake in the company. He was later accused of allying himself with an Italian-American Farmer-Labor Party fixer turned corporate raider named Fred Ossanna, and using force to intimidate stockholders to selling. Then, following the success of their hostile takeover and the company&#x27;s transfer from streetcars to diesel busses, both Kid Cann and Ossanna received significant kickbacks while disposing of the scrap metal from the streetcars. What remained of Twin City Rapid Transit was taken over at the behest of Governor Orville Freeman by noted Minneapolitan Carl Pohlad in 1960.

In 1954, the Chicago Crime Commission named Kid Cann as involved with the Chicago Outfit in the jukebox racket.

As public interest in organized crime grew over the course of the 1950s, Twin Cities Federal Agents and Prosecutors became increasingly determined to put Blumenfeld and his associates in prison.

During the late 1950s, the Immigration and Naturalization Service added Blumenfeld to the &quot;Denaturalization and Deportation Program&quot;. In the hope of deporting Blumenfeld back to the Socialist Republic of Romania for moral turpitude, both the INS and the FBI launched an investigation between 1959 and 1960 of Kid Cann&#x27;s sexual activities.

According to Blumenfeld&#x27;s close friend Sid Hartman, however, the Federal Government&#x27;s pursuit of &quot;The AZ Syndicate&quot; was motivated solely by anti-Semitism. Hartman wrote in his memoirs, &quot;It was OK for the Kennedy family in Boston and for some of the families that are now among the wealthiest in the Twin Cities - families living off trust funds in Wayzata - to have made their money in bootlegging. But it drove a lot of people nuts that the Jews were running Minneapolis and still making money in the liquor business.&quot;

===Convictions and imprisonment===
In 1959, Kid Cann was indicted on Federal charges for violating the Mann Act by transporting a Chicago prostitute named Marilyn Tollefson across State lines to work for his prostitution ring in the Twin Cities. Although Blumenfeld&#x27;s defense counsel read &quot;smoky passages&quot; from Tollefson&#x27;s love letters to Kid Cann to suggest that, &quot;it was not just money that lured her across State lines&quot;, in 1960 a Federal court found Blumenfeld guilty and sentenced him to two years imprisonment.

As this conviction was being appealed, a Federal grand jury indicted Kid Cann, Fred Ossanna, and six other executives of the Twin City Rapid Transit Company for mail fraud, wire fraud, and transporting fraudulently obtained property across State lines. All defendants were convicted at trial, except Blumenfeld, who was acquitted of all thirteen charges against him.

In another Federal trial in 1960, the IRS used ownership forms to prove that Blumenfeld, his relatives, and other members of the &quot;AZ Syndicate&quot; continued to control the Minneapolis liquor industry. Blumenfeld offered a $10,000 bribe to one of the jurors, but was caught within hours. When charged with attempted jury tampering, Blumenfeld plead guilty.

In an interview with Paul Maccabee, FBI Special Agent Bill Lais recalled sitting with Blumenfeld as he awaited sentencing, &quot;Isadore lit my cigarette for me, took off my coat for me, called me, &#x27;sir&#x27;. He admitted that he&#x27;d tried to bribe a juror at his trial. Then he said he wanted to send a nice present to my wife. It was Cann&#x27;s opening gambit to see if I could be bribed, too!&quot;

In 1961, after being accused during sentencing of ordering rigged dice for use in his Twin Cities illegal gambling operations, of blowing up a business rival&#x27;s house in Miami Beach, and of receiving a cut of the money skimmed from Las Vegas&#x27; &quot;Sands Hotel and Casino&quot; through a &quot;strawman&quot; named Mr. Isaacs, Kid Cann was sentenced by Federal Judge Edward Devitt to a second two-year sentence for attempted jury tampering.

Kid Cann served four years at USP Leavenworth and was released in 1964, after his wife Lillian paid his $12,500 fine for violating the Mann Act.

===Later years===
After his release from prison, Kid Cann moved to Miami Beach, Florida with his brothers. They continued to make money through criminal activities, though they changed tack and focused instead on questionable real estate dealings. In 1967, Miami newspapers alleged that Kid Cann, Meyer Lansky, and their relatives either owned or had financial stakes in ten of Miami&#x27;s best hotels. Blumenfeld and Lansky were also alleged to have set up a labyrinth of businesses, deeds, mortgages, leases, and subleases to conceal their involvement and evade Federal income taxes.

According to Neal Karlen, Lansky once said of Blumenfeld, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t trust that &quot;momzer&quot;&quot;, (bastard), &quot;with my pocket comb.&quot; Karlen adds, however, that Lansky loved Blumenfeld&#x27;s brothers Harry and Yiddy and could refuse them nothing.

Kid Cann frequently visited his family and friends in Minnesota. During an interview with a Minneapolis reporter in 1976, Blumenfeld denounced the Federal Agents and Prosecutors who had put him away as his &quot;persecutors&quot;, and called his conviction under the Mann Act, a &quot;trumped up charge&quot;, that involved, &quot;a two-dollar whore.&quot; Blumenfeld added that he had recently turned down an offer to write his memoirs, saying &quot;I have nothing to say, really.&quot;

In 1978, however, Blumenfeld and his brothers were allegedly responsible for manipulating Magic Marker stock prices.

==Personal life==
Blumenfeld smoked Parliament cigarettes and wore flashy clothes. His favorite outfit included a maroon suit, maroon suede shoes, a canary yellow shirt, and matching socks.

Blumenfeld reportedly hated his famous nickname and preferred to be called Dr. Ferguson, or &quot;Fergie&quot;, especially by his many female lovers. He would also oddly enough ask his family to call him, &quot;Fergie&quot; as well. 

According to Paul Maccabee, after the death of legendary Twin Cities madam Nina Clifford in July 1929, the AZ Syndicate assigned Blumenfeld&#x27;s girlfriend, Lillian Lee, to run Clifford&#x27;s brothel at 147 and 145 South Washington Street in St. Paul. City Directories confirm that Lillian Lee, described as a &quot;saleswoman&quot;, ran the brothel between 1931 and 1934.

After several years of living together, Blumenfeld and Lillian Lee were married on August 25, 1936. They had no children and, following her death, Lillian Blumenfeld was buried next to her husband at Adath Yeshurun Cemetery in Edina.

==Death==
After allegedly returning home to die, Kid Cann died in Minneapolis&#x27; Mount Sinai Hospital of heart disease on June 21, 1981. Blumenfeld&#x27;s death was news from coast to coast.

At the time of his death, Isadore Blumenfeld&#x27;s estate was conservatively estimated at $10 million. According to an obituary in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; which incorrectly listed his place of death as New York City, Kid Cann was also a philanthropist and, although Jewish, had donated an estimated 10% of his estimated $10 million fortune to churches as well as to synagogues. When once asked why, Blumenfeld had replied, &quot;I believe in playing all the angles. I&#x27;m superstitious.&quot;

Rabbi Max Shapiro of Temple Israel, &quot;the leading rabbi at the largest congregation in the city&quot;, and &quot;the city&#x27;s most sought after eulogist&quot;, recited the graveside services and the &quot;Kaddish&quot; in a driving rain before Blumenfeld&#x27;s burial at the Adath Yeshurun Cemetery in Edina, Minnesota. Taxi driver Charles Goldberg, whom Blumenfeld shot dead in an allegedly accidental shooting during, &quot;an argument over a girl&quot;, in front of Minneapolis&#x27; Café Vienna in 1924, lies buried only a few yards away.

In an onsite interview with &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; reporter Bonnie Miller Rubin, mourner Harry Horowitz said of Blumenfeld, &quot;He was a wonderful fellow when a person needed something. He helped out many a person who was broke - who had absolutely nothing. He never forgot his friends and he always kept the family together.&quot;

Rabbi Shapiro later recalled,

After Kid Cann&#x27;s funeral, I received a call from someone who asked how could I possibly officiate at the funeral of such a terrible human being? And I answered, it&#x27;s my belief that every Jew at death, no matter what he did in life, deserves to have the Mourners Kaddish – the last prayer – said for him. So I said Kaddish for Kid Cann.

==Folklore==
In Minnesota folklore, tales of Kid Cann and his rumored dark deeds may be considered to have made him a local urban legend, similar to Al Capone or Whitey Bulger.

In later years, he was alleged to have installed bulletproof windows on his suburban house and to have been able to fix any problem with a single phone call. During his lifetime, Kid Cann bore a love–hate relationship with his legend, on one hand glorying in the attention and also feeling infuriated by the increased F.B.I. surveillance that it brought him beginning in the early 1950s. In a 1976 interview, he snapped, &quot;Ninety percent of what was written about me is bullshit!&quot;

==In popular culture==
* In October 2010, the &quot;Minnesota Landmarks and Lakeshore Players&quot; performed a stage play about Kid Cann&#x27;s life and trials at Saint Paul&#x27;s Landmark Center, the historic Ramsey County Courthouse. The play was written and directed by Joan Gill Elwell.

<text>William Wymark Jacobs (8 September 1863 – 1 September 1943) was an English author of short fiction and drama. He is best known for his story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;.

==Early life==
He was born in 1863 at 5, Crombie&#x27;s Row, Mile End Old Town (not Wapping, as is often stated), London, to William Gage Jacobs, wharf manager, and his wife Sophia. His father managed the South Devon wharf in Lower East Smithfield, by the St Katherine Docks and, according to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;the young Jacobs spent much time on Thames-side, growing familiar with the life of the neighbourhood&quot; and &quot;ran wild in Wapping&quot;. Jacobs and his siblings were still young when their mother died. Their father then married his housekeeper and had seven more children, including illustrator Helen Jacobs. Jacobs attended a private London school before Birkbeck College (Birkbeck Literary and Scientific Institution, now part of the University of London), where he befriended William Pett Ridgcap.


==Early work==
In 1879, Jacobs began work as a clerk in the Post Office Savings Bank. By 1885 he had his first short story published, but success came slowly. Yet Arnold Bennett in 1898 was astonished to hear that Jacobs had turned down £50 for six short stories. He was financially secure enough to be able to leave the Post Office in 1899.

==Literature==
Jacobs is remembered for a macabre tale, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;, (published 1902 in a short-story collection, &quot;The Lady of the Barge&quot;) and several other ghost stories, including &quot;The Toll House&quot; (from the 1909 collection &quot;Sailors&#x27; Knots&quot;) and &quot;Jerry Bundler&quot; (from the 1901 &quot;Light Freights&quot;). Most of his work was humorous. His favourite subject was marine life – &quot;men who go down to the sea in ships of moderate tonnage&quot;, said &quot;Punch&quot;, reviewing his first collection, &quot;Many Cargoes&quot;, which gained popular success on publication in 1896.

Michael Sadleir has said of Jacobs&#x27;s fiction, &quot;He wrote stories of three kinds: describing the misadventures of sailor-men ashore; celebrating the artful dodger of a slow-witted village; and tales of the macabre.&quot;
&quot;Many Cargoes&quot; was followed by the novel &quot;The Skipper&#x27;s Wooing&quot; in 1897, and another collection of short stories, &quot;Sea Urchins&quot; (1898), confirmed his popularity. Other titles included &quot;Captains All&quot;, &quot;Sailors&#x27; Knots&quot;, and &quot;Night Watches&quot;. The title of the last reflects the popularity of an enduring character: the night-watchman on the wharf in Wapping, recounting the preposterous adventures of his acquaintances Ginger Dick, Sam Small, and Peter Russet. These three characters, pockets full after a long voyage, took lodgings together, set on enjoying a long spell ashore, but the crafty inhabitants of dockland London soon relieved them of their funds, assisted by their own fecklessness and credulity. Jacobs showed a delicacy of touch in his use of the coarse vernacular of the East End of London, which attracted the respect of P. G. Wodehouse, who mentions Jacobs in his autobiographical work &quot;Bring on the Girls!&quot;, written with Guy Bolton and published in 1954.

The stories in &quot;Many Cargoes&quot; had varied previous serial publication, while those in &quot;Sea Urchins&quot; were for the most part published in Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Idler&quot;. From October 1898, Jacobs&#x27;s stories appeared in &quot;The Strand&quot;, which provided him with financial security almost up to his death.

John Drinkwater described Jacobs&#x27;s fiction as &quot;in the Dickens tradition&quot;.

==Dramatic work==
Jacobs&#x27;s short-story output declined somewhat around the time of the First World War. His literary efforts thereafter were mainly adaptations of his own short stories for the stage. His first stage work, &quot;The Ghost of Jerry Bundler&quot;, opened in London in 1899, was revived in 1902, and was eventually published in 1908. He wrote 18 plays altogether, some in collaboration with other writers.

==Adult life==
Jacobs married Agnes Eleanor Williams in 1900 at West Ham, Essex. Agnes was later a noted suffragette. The 1901 Census records their living with a first child, a three-month-old daughter, at Kings Place Road, Buckhurst Hill, Essex. Also recorded in the household were his journalist sister Amy, his sister-in-law, Nancy Williams, a cook, and an additional domestic servant. Altogether the Jacobses had two sons and three daughters.

Jacobs went on to set up home in Loughton, Essex, first at the Outlook in Park Hill, and then at Feltham House in Goldings Hill, which bears a blue plaque to him. Loughton is the &quot;Claybury&quot; of some of the stories; Jacobs&#x27;s love for the local forest scenery features in &quot;Land Of Cockaigne&quot;. Another blue plaque appears on Jacobs&#x27;s central London residence at 15 Gloucester Gate, Regents Park (later held by the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Institute of Architecture).

Jacobs stated that after his youthful left-wing opinions, his political position in later years was &quot;Conservative and Individualistic&quot;.

On 7 January 1914, in King&#x27;s Hall, Covent Garden, Jacobs was a member of the jury in the mock trial of John Jasper for the murder of Edwin Drood. At this all-star event G. K. Chesterton was Judge and George Bernard Shaw appeared as foreman of the jury.

In 1928 he was involved in the creation of films of his works. The first film made was titled &quot;The Bravo&quot;. Fifty actresses were auditioned and Jacob was said to be impressed by Paddy Naismith who was chosen to play the lead role.

Jacobs died on 1 September 1943 at Hornsey Lane, Islington, London, at the age of 79. An obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; (2 September 1943) described him as &quot;quiet, gentle and modest ... not fond of large functions and crowds.&quot; Ian Hay remarked, &quot;He invented an entirely new form of humorous narrative. Its outstanding characteristics were compression and understatement.&quot;

<text>Hezekiah Leroy Gordon Smith (August 14, 1909 – September 25, 1967), better known as Stuff Smith, was an American jazz violinist. He is well known for the song &quot;If You&#x27;re a Viper&quot; (the original title was &quot;You&#x27;se a Viper&quot;).

Smith was, along with Stéphane Grappelli, Michel Warlop, Svend Asmussen, Ray Nance and Joe Venuti, one of jazz music&#x27;s preeminent violinists of the swing era.

==Biography==
He was born in Portsmouth, Ohio, United States in 1909, and studied violin with his father. Smith cited Louis Armstrong as his primary influence and inspiration to play jazz, and like Armstrong, was a vocalist as well as instrumentalist. In the 1920s, he played in Texas as a member of Alphonse Trent&#x27;s band. After moving to New York City he performed regularly with his sextet at the Onyx Club starting in 1935, and also with Coleman Hawkins, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and later, Sun Ra.

After being signed to Vocalion Records in 1936, he had a hit with &quot;I&#x27;se a Muggin and was billed as Stuff Smith and His Onyx Club Boys. He recorded for Vocalion in 1936, Decca in 1937, and Varsity in 1939–1940.

He is featured in several numbers on the Nat King Cole Trio album, &quot;After Midnight&quot;.

Part of Smith&#x27;s performance at what is considered the first outdoor jazz festival, the 1938 Carnival of Swing on Randall&#x27;s Island, turned up unexpectedly on audio engineer William Savory&#x27;s discs, which were self-recorded off the radio at the time, then long-sequestered. Some newsreel footage survived but no audio of the festival was thought to have survived until the discs were acquired in 2012 by Loren Schoenberg, executive director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem.

Smith was critical of the bebop movement, although his own style represented a transition between swing and bebop. He is credited as being the first violinist to use electric amplification techniques on a violin. He was one of the writers of the song &quot;It&#x27;s Wonderful&quot; (1937), which was often performed by Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald throughout their careers. Smith moved to Copenhagen in 1965, performed actively in Europe, and died in Munich in 1967. He is buried at Klakring Cemetery in Jutland, Denmark.

Stuff Smith is one of the 57 jazz musicians photographed in the 1958 portrait &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;.
