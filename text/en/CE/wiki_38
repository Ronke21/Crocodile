<text>Genu valgum, commonly called &quot;knock-knee&quot;, is a condition in which the knees angle in and touch each other when the legs are straightened. Individuals with severe valgus deformities are typically unable to touch their feet together while simultaneously straightening the legs. The term originates , but is also used to describe the distal portion of the knee joint which bends outwards and thus the proximal portion seems to be bent inwards. 

Mild genu valgum is diagnosed when a person standing upright with the feet touching also shows the knees touching. It can be seen in children from ages 2 to 5, and is often corrected naturally as children grow. The condition may continue or worsen with age, particularly when it is the result of a disease, such as rickets. Idiopathic genu valgum is a form that is either congenital or has no known cause.

Other systemic conditions may be associated, such as Schnyder crystalline corneal dystrophy, an autosomal dominant condition frequently reported with hyperlipidemia.

==Causes==
Genu valgum can arise from a variety of causes including nutritional, genetic, traumatic, idiopathic or physiologic and infectious.

===Rickets=== 
Nutritional rickets is an important cause of childhood genu valgum or knock knees in some parts of the world. Nutritional rickets arises from unhealthy life style habits as insufficient exposure to sun light which is the main source of vitamin D. Insufficient dietary intake of calcium is another contributing factor. Genu valgum may arise from rickets caused by genetic abnormalities, called vitamin D-resistant rickets or X-linked hypophosphatemia.

===Osteochondrodysplasia=== 
Osteochondrodysplasia are a variable group of genetic bone diseases or genetic skeletal dysplasias that present with generalized bone deformities involving all extremities and the spine. Genu valgum or knock knees is one of the known skeletal manifestations of Osteochondrodysplasias. A complete bone X-ray survey is mandatory to reach a definitive diagnosis.

==Diagnosis ==

The degree of genu valgum can clinically be estimated by the , which is the angle formed by a line drawn from the anterior superior iliac spine through the center of the patella and a line drawn from the center of the patella to the center of the tibial tubercle. In women, the Q angle should be less than 22 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 9 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. In men, the Q angle should be less than 18 degrees with the knee in extension and less than 8 degrees with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. A typical Q angle is 12 degrees for men and 17 degrees for women.

===Radiography===
On projectional radiography, the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the &quot;hip-knee-ankle angle&quot;, which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. Normal ranges are different in children.
==Treatment==
The treatment of genu valgum in children depends on the underlying cause. Developmental also known as idiopathic genu valgum is usually self-limiting and resolves during childhood. Genu valgum secondary to nutritional rickets is typically treated with lifestyle modifications in the form of adequate sun exposure to ensure receiving the daily requirements of vitamin D and nutrition with a rich calcium diet. Additionally, calcium and vitamin D supplementations may be used. If the deformity does not resolve despite the above conservative treatment and the deformity is severe and causing gait impairment, then surgery can be an option. Typically, guided growth surgery is used to straighten the deformed bone. Genu valgum arising from osteochondrodysplasia usually needs repeated guided growth surgical interventions. Genu valgum secondary to trauma depends on the degree of physical damage. Usually, limb reconstruction procedures are needed, especially if trauma occurs in the early years of life where the anticipated remaining longitudinal bone growth is great. 
The treatment of genu valgum in adults depends on the underlying cause and the degree of joint involvement namely arthritis. Bone corrective osteotomies and prosthetic joint replacement may be used depending upon the patient&#x27;s age and symptomatology in terms of pain and functional impairment. Weight loss and substitution of high-impact for low-impact exercise can help slow progression of the condition. With every step, the patient&#x27;s weight places a distortion on the knee toward a knocked knee position, and the effect is increased with increased angle or increased weight. Even in the normal knee position, the femurs function at an angle because they connect to the hip girdle at points much further apart than they connect at the knees.

Working with a physical medicine specialist such as a physiatrist, or a physiotherapist may assist a patient in learning how to improve outcomes and use the leg muscles properly to support the bone structures. Alternative or complementary treatments may include certain procedures from Iyengar Yoga or the Feldenkrais Method.

<text>Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue (French: Justine, ou Les Malheurs de la Vertu) is a 1791 novel by Donatien Alphonse François de Sade, better known as the Marquis de Sade. &quot;Justine&quot; is set just before the French Revolution in France and tells the story of a young girl who goes under the name of Thérèse. Her story is recounted to Madame de Lorsagne while defending herself for her crimes, en route to punishment and death. She explains the series of misfortunes that led to her present situation.

==History of the work==
&quot;Justine&quot; (original French title: Les infortunes de la vertu) was an early work by the Marquis de Sade, written in two weeks in 1787 while he was imprisoned in the Bastille. It is a novella (187 pages) with relatively little of the obscenity that characterised his later writing, as it was written in the classical style (which was fashionable at the time), with much verbose and metaphorical description.

A much extended and more graphic version, entitled &quot;Justine ou Les Malheurs de la vertu&quot; (1791) (English title: &quot;Justine, or The Misfortunes of the Virtue&quot; or simply &quot;Justine&quot;), was the first of Sade&#x27;s books published.

A further extended version, &quot;La Nouvelle Justine ou Les Malheurs de la vertu&quot; (&quot;The New Justine&quot;), was published in the Netherlands in 1797. This final version, &quot;La Nouvelle Justine&quot;, departed from the first-person narrative of the previous two versions, and included around 100 engravings. It was accompanied by a continuation, &quot;Juliette&quot;, about Justine&#x27;s sister. The two together formed 10 volumes of nearly 4,000 pages in total; publication was completed in 1801.

Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of &quot;Justine&quot; and &quot;Juliette&quot;, and as a result Sade was incarcerated for the last 13 years of his life. The book&#x27;s destruction was ordered by the Cour Royale de Paris on May 19, 1815.

==Modern publication==

A censored English translation of &quot;Justine&quot; was issued in the US by the Risus Press in the early 1930s, and went through many reprints. The first unexpurgated English translation of &quot;Justine&quot; (by &#x27;Pieralessandro Casavini&#x27;, a pseudonym for Austryn Wainhouse) was published by the Olympia Press in 1953. Wainhouse later revised this translation for publication in the United States by Grove Press (1965). Another modern translated version still in print is the 1999 Wordsworth a translation of the original version in which Justine calls herself Sophie and not Thérèse.

The final 1797 version &quot;La Nouvelle Justine&quot; has never been published in English translation, although it was published in French in the permissive conditions of the late 1960s, as part of two rival limited-editions of the definitive collected works of Sade: Jean-Jacques Pauvert&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres complètes de Sade&quot; (1968, 30 volumes) and Cercle du Livre Precieux&#x27;s &quot;Œuvres complètes du Marquis de Sade: editions definitive&quot; (1967, 16 volumes).

==Plot==
The plot concerns Justine, a 12-year-old maiden (&quot;As for Justine, aged as we have remarked, twelve&quot;) who sets off to make her way in France. It follows her until age 26 in her quest for virtue. She is presented with sexual lessons, hidden under a virtuous mask. The unfortunate situations include the time when she seeks refuge and confession in a monastery, but is forced to become a sex slave to the monks, who subject her to countless orgies, rapes and similar rigours and the time when, helping a gentleman who is robbed in a field, he takes her back to his château with promises of a post caring for his wife, but she is then confined in a cave and subject to much the same punishment. These punishments are mostly the same throughout, even when she goes to a judge to beg for mercy in her case as an arsonist and then finds herself openly humiliated in court, unable to defend herself. These are described in true Sadean form. However, unlike some of his other works, the novel is not just a catalogue of sadism.

Justine (Thérèse or Sophie in the first version) and Juliette were the daughters of Monsieur de Bertole. Bertole was a widower banker who fell in love with another man&#x27;s lover. The man, Monsieur de Noirseuil, in the interest of revenge, pretended to be his friend, made sure he became bankrupt and eventually poisoned him, leaving the girls orphans. Juliette and Justine lived in a nunnery, where the abbess of the nunnery corrupted Juliette (and attempted to corrupt Justine too). However, Justine was sweet and virtuous. When the abbess found out about Bertole&#x27;s death, she threw both girls out. Juliette&#x27;s story is told in another book and Justine continues on in pursuit of virtue, beginning from becoming a maid in the house of the usurer Harpin, which is where her troubles begin anew.

In her search for work and shelter Justine constantly fell into the hands of rogues who would ravish and torture her and the people she makes friends with. Justine was falsely accused of theft by Harpin and sent to jail expecting execution. She had to ally herself with a Miss Dubois, a criminal who helped her to escape along with her band. To escape, Miss Dubois arranged a fire to break out in the prison, in which 21 people died. After escaping the band of Dubois, Justine wanders off and accidentally trespasses upon the lands of the count of Bressac.

The story is told by &quot;Thérèse&quot; (&quot;Sophie&quot; in the first version) in an inn, to Madame de Lorsagne. It is finally revealed that Madame de Lorsagne is her long-lost sister. The irony is that her sister submitted to a brief period of vice and found herself a comfortable existence where she could exercise good, while Justine refused to make concessions for the greater good and was plunged further into vice than those who would go willingly.

The story ends with Madame de Lorsagne relieving her from a life of vice and clearing her name. Soon afterward, Justine becomes introverted and morose and is finally struck by a bolt of lightning and killed instantly. Madame de Lorsagne joins a religious order after Justine&#x27;s death.

==Scholarship==
Simone de Beauvoir wrote a notable essay on Sade, &quot;Faut-il brûler Sade?&quot; (&quot;Should we burn Sade?&quot;), published in 1955. She argues that, beyond the scandalous element, Sade uses &quot;Justine&quot; to reconcile individual pleasure with societal existence and to explore an ethical dimension to libertine philosophy. 

One scholar commented:
The libertines derive as much satisfaction from defeating their opponents intellectually as they do from subduing and abusing them physically, while the victims themselves (and Justine offers the best example of this) rise admirably to the challenge with equally forceful and reasoned replies.

James Fowler writes that &quot;her piety offers her the most intense pleasure she can experience in life&quot; and describes her responses to the libertine Marquis de Bressac as &quot;pious hedonism&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1798, the rival writer Rétif de la Bretonne published his &quot;Anti-Justine&quot;.

In Lars von Trier&#x27;s 2011 film &quot;Melancholia&quot;, the main character, played by Kirsten Dunst, is named after de Sade&#x27;s Justine.

A retelling in contemporary terms is &quot;The Turkish Bath&quot;, a 1969 novel published by Olympia Press, allegedly by Justine and Juliette Lemercier in an autobiographical format.

==Film, TV or theatrical adaptations==
The story has been adapted for film several times, most notably in a 1969 international co-production directed by Jesús Franco and starring Jack Palance, Romina Power, and Klaus Kinski as the Marquis, titled &quot;Marquis de Sade: Justine&quot;. There has also been a graphic novel version by Guido Crepax. In 1972, French director Claude Pierson filmed a very faithful adaptation of Sade&#x27;s work entitled &quot;Justine de Sade&quot;, with French Alice Arno in the title role. In 1973, the Japanese director Tatsumi Kumashiro filmed an adaptation of &quot;Justine&quot; as part of Nikkatsu&#x27;s Roman Porno series. The film was titled . In 1977, a film version of the novel, entitled &quot;Cruel Passion&quot;, was released.

&quot;Justine&quot; was also featured in the 2000 film &quot;Quills&quot; based on the life of the Marquis de Sade.

Julia Ducournau, director of the film &quot;Raw&quot;, said in an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; that she named the protagonist after Sade&#x27;s Justine.

===Depot division===

The War Department established the 76th Division on 5 August 1917, to be organized at Camp Devens, Ayer, Massachusetts; drafts anticipated for 1917, from Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont, furnished the division&#x27;s first enlisted personnel. On 13 August, the organization of the division headquarters is directed, and its commissioned personnel are ordered to report on or before 15 August. On 16 August, the commander of Camp Devens is directed to organize the division in accordance with the tables of organization of 8 August 1917. On 25 August, Major General Harry F. Hodges assumes command of the division, and the program for the movement of Selective Service men to camps is announced. During the last week in August, organization begins from a cadre of officers and men of the Regular Army, and from Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and National Army officers of the First Officers Training Camps. From 5-10 September, the initial draft of 2,000 Selective Service men arrived at camp, and from 19-24 September, an additional 17,500 arrived. In September, systematic training began. From 3-8 October, the last drafts of 1917 furnished the camp with 17,500 men. On 31 October, the 76th Division numbered about 22,000 personnel. During the winter, fresh drafts and transfers arrived, but are exceeded by the losses which include, in November alone, 3,600, the majority of whom were transferred to the 82nd Division. On 31 March 1918, the 76th Division aggregated less than one-half the authorized strength. In April and June 1918, new drafts and transfers completed the division. On 28 June, the Advance Detachment sailed from New York and arrived on 10 July at Liverpool, England. On 14 July 1918, the 76th Division, less the 151st Field Artillery Brigade, 301st Engineers and Train, and 301st Field Signal Battalion, was designated as a depot division, reduced to a cadre strength and used to receive, equip, train, and forward replacements and hospital returnees to combat units of the American Expeditionary Forces.

==Interwar period==

The 76th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the First Corps Area, and assigned to the XI Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island as its home area. Headquarters of the “Onaway” Division was organized on 1 September 1921 at the State Armory in Hartford, Connecticut. The headquarters was subsequently relocated on 18 January 1928 to Room 411, Donaghue Building at 535 Main Street in Hartford, and finally to the Federal Building at Church and High Streets on 28 February 1933, and remained there until activated for World War II. The 373rd-375th Infantry Regiments, part of the provisional 94th Division in World War I which was intended to be composed of Puerto Rican soldiers, were allotted to Puerto Rico&#x27;s 211th Infantry Brigade as part of a hypothetical division which was never organized, and the unorganized 376th Infantry was assigned to the 94th Division, which was allotted to Massachusetts. To flesh out the rest of the 94th Division&#x27;s infantry, the 301st and 302nd Infantry Regiments (part of the 76th Division in World War I) were assigned, along with the newly-constituted 419th Infantry. The 76th Division retained only its World War I-era 304th Infantry, taking the 385th Infantry from the 97th Division and adding the newly-constituted 417th and 418th Infantry Regiments, while the 97th Division took the 76th Division&#x27;s 303rd Infantry and retained the 386th-388th Infantry Regiments.

Upon reorganization after the Great War, the 76th Division was slow to build its strength. By 1926, the division was still only about 67 percent complete with 605 officers assigned out of 905 authorized. This slow progression was due, in part, to the small number of ROTC programs located in the First Corps Area from which the division could draw its officers. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division headquarters published a newsletter named “The Spirit of ‘76” in keeping with division’s numerical designation and the military, geographical, and historical background of the region from which it drew its personnel. The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Devens, Massachusetts, the location where much of the 76th Division’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. For the few summers when it was called to duty for training as a unit, the headquarters often trained with the staff of the 9th Division&#x27;s 18th Infantry Brigade at Camp Devens. The summer training for the personnel assigned to the division headquarters was varied and included staff training, branch-specific training, and command post exercises (CPXs). For several summers, however, the division headquarters conducted its summer training at the Connecticut Agricultural College in Storrs, Connecticut. The camp at Storrs was also designated the “Special Officers Camp” and consisted of training for unassigned officers, officers who could not attend training with their assigned units, and basic training for recent ROTC and CMTC commissionees. The division’s subordinate units trained all over the First Corps Area. Divisional infantry regiments, for example, held their summer training primarily with the units of the 18th Infantry Brigade at Camp Devens, Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, and Fort Adams, Rhode Island. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the First, Second, and Third Corps Areas, usually with Regular Army units of the same branch. For example, the 301st Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 301st Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 301st Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated the responsibility for conducting the CMTC held at Camp Devens each year.

On a number of occasions, the 76th Division participated in First Corps Area or First Army CPXs in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers an opportunity to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 76th Division did not participate in the First Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some were assigned duties as umpires or support personnel.

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

The 76th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service on 15 June 1942 around a cadre of officers and men from the 1st Infantry Division. After a period of service as a replacement division that held and processed men for assignment to other units or overseas from October 1942 to March 1943, intensive training began on 12 April 1943. This was followed by advanced training in July 1943 at A.P. Hill Military Reservation near Fredericksburg, Virginia. Winter training started in September 1943 at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin. (Skis, snowshoes, toboggans, snow tractors, snow goggles, winter camouflage suits, Eskimo parkas, etc.) Simultaneously, an advanced training group moved in November 1943 to northern Michigan near Watersmeet. Winter training experts from the Mountain Training Center at Camp Hale, Colorado gave a special training program. Additional winter training began at Ottawa National Forest near Watersmeet on 19 February 1944. During this training, temperatures dropped to .

Four exercises were conducted during which the 385th Infantry Regiment (headquartered in Pori, Michigan, opposed the division as an enemy force.
On 12 March 1944, the division returned to Camp McCoy. 7,000 troops, mainly infantry, were taken from the 76th from April to September 1944 to build up forces for the impending invasion of France (D-Day); the division was replenished by men diverted from the Army Specialized Training Program, aviation cadets, men from disbanded antiaircraft and tank destroyer units, and men who were allowed to volunteer for the infantry from other branches of the Army. In November 1944, trains headed to Camp Myles Standish in Taunton, Massachusetts for staging before transport to Europe.

On Thanksgiving Day 1944, three transports sailed from Boston Port of Embarkation to Europe. The 304th Infantry plus a division headquarters party sailed on the SS &quot;Brazil&quot;. The 304th reached Southampton, England on 4 December 1944. The 385th Infantry crossed the Atlantic on the SS &quot;Sea Owl&quot;. The 385th reached Southampton on 4 December 1944 The 417th Infantry sailed on the SS &quot;Marine Raven&quot;. The 417th docked at Plymouth 4 December 1944. The remainder of the division sailed from Boston on 10 December 1944 aboard the Coast Guard operated transport SS &quot;Richardson&quot;. The SS &quot;Richardson&quot; docked at the Clyde River near Grenoch, Scotland on 12 December 1944. The remainder of the division headquarters sailed from New York on 4 December on the Dutch liner &quot;New Amsterdam&quot;.
===Combat chronicle===
The 76th Infantry Division arrived in England, 20 December 1944, where it received additional training. It landed at Le Havre, France, 12 January 1945, and proceeded to the Limesy concentration area. The Division moved to Beine east of Reims and then to Champlon, Belgium, 23 January, to prepare for combat. Relieving the 87th Division in defensive positions along the Sauer and Moselle Rivers in the vicinity of Echternach, Luxembourg, 25 January, the 76th sent out patrols and crossed the Sauer, 7 February, and breached the Siegfried Line in a heavy assault. The advance continued across the Prum and Nims Rivers, 25–27 February. Katzenkopf fortress and Irrel fell on 28 February and the attack pushed on toward Trier, reaching the Moselle, 3 March. Driving across the Kyll River, the division took Hosten, 3 March, Speicher on 5 March and Karl on 10 March; swung south and cleared the area north of the Moselle, crossing the river, 18 March, near Mülheim an der Mosel. Moving to the Rhine, the 76th took over defenses from Boppard to St. Goar and crossed the Rhine at Boppard, 27 March. It drove east and took Kamberg in a house-to-house struggle, 29 March. A new attack was launched 4 April and the Werra River was reached the next day. The attack continued in conjunction with the 6th Armored Division; Langensalza fell and the Gera River was crossed, 11 April. Zeitz was captured after a violent struggle, 14–15 April, and the 76th reached the Mulde River on 16 April, going into defensive positions to hold a bridgehead across the Mulde near Chemnitz until VE-day.

==Cold War to 1996==
The 76th Division was reconstituted in October 1946 and reactivated in November of that year as a part of the Organized Reserve, and was headquartered in West Hartford, Connecticut. Units of the division were spread throughout the six New England states.

For the next 13 years, the division served as a traditional line Infantry division, training annually at Camp Edwards, Massachusetts and at Pine Camp (now Fort Drum), New York. In May 1959, the Division was re-designated and reorganized as the 76th Division (Training) with the mission of training initial (basic) entry soldiers of various branches and in later years the division also became able to train infantry volunteers or draftees.

In this role during 1985 and 1986, in an operation codenamed &quot;Onaway Eagle&quot;, the division successfully defined, established and executed the first USAR (United States Army Reserve) mobilization army training center at Fort Campbell, Kentucky which became the model for utilization and employment of other reserve training divisions in the United States Army. In Operation Onaway Eagle, elements of the division successfully conducted Basic Combat Training for hundreds of new soldiers.

In 1990–1991, during Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the division validated and deployed to the Middle East over 600 of its soldiers where they served with distinction with the Third Army. As part of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, the 1205th Transportation Railway Services Unit (later 1205th Transportation Railway Operating Battalion), based in Middletown, CT, was mobilized to augment civilian railway employees at Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, a U.S. Army munitions outport located just south of Wilmington, NC, bringing in tons of explosives by rail to the secure port for shipment to the war zone. On 1 October 1994, the division was again redesignated and on 18 April 1995 was reorganized as the 76th Division (Institutional Training). Just over two years later, the division was inactivated on 15 November 1996 at West Hartford, Connecticut. The commander at the time was BG John G Pappas, who served in this position from 1 Oct 1994 until 9 Sept 1996.

==Reactivation in 2013 to present==
In February 2013, Major General Daniel York sought a historical designation for a new command being stood up in the Army Reserve. The 76th Division was reactivated as the 76th USAR Operational Response Command (ORC) and is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah. Their mission is to provide operational engagement packages and joint enabling capabilities for homeland response, cyber defense, legal support, information operations, and global force space enhancement requirements to combatant, unified, Joint and Department of Defense Agency Commanders.

From October 2015 to September 2017, Major General Ricky L. Waddell served as commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command.

From November 2017 to June 2018, Major General A.C. Roper served as commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command.

From June 2018 to July 2019, Brigadier General Douglas A. Cherry served as acting commanding general of the 76th Operational Response Command.

From July 2019 to March 2020, Major General Frederick R. Maiocco served as commanding general.

From March 2020 to August 2020, Brigadier General Douglas A. Cherry served as acting commanding general.

Major General Miles Davis is the current commanding general.

The command is made up of over 6,000 soldiers with a presence in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and select locations in Europe.

<doc id="915293" wikidata="Q7080739" url="?curid=915293" title="Ohio Apportionment Board">
<text>The Ohio Apportionment Board was an administrative body which drew the single-member legislative districts for the Ohio General Assembly every ten years following the census from 1851 to 2011. Each of the 33 senate districts is composed of three contiguous of the 99 house of representatives district.

The board had five members:

*the Governor of Ohio,
*the Ohio Secretary of State,
*the Ohio State Auditor,
*a member selected by the Speaker of the Ohio House of Representatives and the senate leader of the same party.
*a member selected by the house and senate leaders of other party.

The members selected by the legislators were added when voters amended Article XI of the Ohio Constitution in 1967. This format ensured that no party can hold all five seats and at least one seat would belong to the minority party.

In 2011, the board&#x27;s members were:

*Gov. John Kasich (R)
*State Auditor Dave Yost (R)
*Secretary of State Jon A. Husted (R)
*Assembly Republican Member: Senator Tom Niehaus (R), and
*Assembly Democratic Member: Representative Armond Budish (D)

Democrats controlled the apportionment board in 1971 and 1981. Republicans controlled the apportionment board in 1991, 2001 and 2011.

Following the 2011 redistricting cycle and resulting legislative gridlock, the he board was replaced by the Ohio Redistricting Commission following the passage of a constitutional amendment in 2015.

<doc id="915295" wikidata="Q2598134" url="?curid=915295" title="Kangaroo care">
<text>Kangaroo mother care (KMC), which involves skin-to-skin contact (SSC), is an intervention to care for premature or low birth weight (LBW) infants. The technique and intervention is the recommended evidence-based care for LBW infants by the World Health Organization (WHO) since 2003.

In the 2003 WHO Kangaroo Mother Care practical guide, KMC is defined as a &quot;powerful, easy-to-use method to promote the health and well-being of infants born preterm as well as full-term&quot;, with its key components being:
* Early, continuous, and prolonged SSC between the mother and the baby;
* Exclusive breastfeeding (ideally);
* Initiated in a hospital setting and can be continued at home;
* Allows for early discharge of the baby to the family;
* After discharge, includes close followup 

The early KMC technique was first presented by Rey and Martinez in 1983, in Bogotá, Colombia, where it was developed as an alternative to inadequate and insufficient incubator care for those preterm newborn infants who had overcome initial problems and required only to feed and grow. Decades of research and development, much from researchers from emerging economies, has improved upon the initial work and has documented that modern evidence-based KMC lowers infant mortality and the risk of hospital-acquired infection, increases weight gain of infants, increases rates of breastfeeding, protects neuromotor and brain development of infants, and improves mother-infants bonding, among other benefits. Today, the WHO recommends &quot;Kangaroo mother care (KMC) for preterm or low-birth-weight infants should be started as soon as possible after birth&quot; based on &quot;high-certainty evidence&quot;.

==Scientific documentation of benefits==
Originally babies who were eligible for KMC included LBW infants weighing less than and breathing and eating independently. Cardiopulmonary monitoring, oximetry, supplemental oxygen or nasal ventilation (continuous positive airway pressure), intravenous infusions, and monitor leads do not prevent KMC. In fact, babies who are in KMC tend to be less prone to apnea and bradycardia and have stabilization of oxygen needs.

KMC has been shown to provide many benefits to the infant, as well as to the family directly involved in the infant&#x27;s care. Large reviews of the thousands of scientific articles that present the body of evidence have been published, that serve as the bases for practical guides for practitioners.

After initial reviews of scientific evidence in the mid-1990s highlighted research ongoing in both developed and developing countries, research into KMC grew exponentially. Systematic reviews of hundreds of scientific articles have documented the impact of KMC on mortality, morbidity, and quality of survival LBW infants.

A randomized controlled trial published in 2016 reported that babies born between became physiologically stable in SSC starting from birth, compared to similar babies in incubators. A descriptive study of case series in a hospital without any technical resources evaluated two of the components of the KMC: the inpatient kangaroo position and kangaroo feeding and was published in 1994. This paper supports the hypothesis that, in cases of absence of technical resources, inpatient kangaroo position and nutrition is an acceptable alternative.

In 2016, a Cochrane review, &quot;Kangaroo mother care to reduce morbidity and mortality in low birthweight infants&quot;, was published bringing together data from 21 studies including 3,042 LBW babies (less than at birth). This review showed that babies receiving kangaroo care had a reduced risk of death, hospital-acquired infection, and low body temperature (hypothermia); was also associated with increased weight gain, growth in length, and rates of breastfeeding.

===Preterm and LBW infants===
Kangaroo care &quot;is an effective and safe alternative to conventional neonatal care for LBW infants, mainly in resource-limited countries&quot;. KMC reduces mortality, and also morbidity in resource limited settings, though further studies are needed.

Kangaroo care arguably offers the most benefits for preterm and LBW infants, who experience more normalized temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate, increased weight gain, and fewer hospital-acquired infections. Additionally, studies suggest that preterm infants who experience kangaroo care have improved cognitive development, decreased stress levels, reduced pain responses, normalized growth, and positive effects on motor development. Kangaroo care also helps to improve sleep patterns of infants and may be a good intervention for colic. Earlier discharge from hospital is also a possible outcome Finally, kangaroo care helps to promote frequent breastfeeding and can enhance mother–infant bonding. Evidence from a recent systematic review supports the use of kangaroo mother care as a substitute for conventional neonatal care in settings where resources are limited.

===For parents===
Kangaroo care is beneficial for parents because it promotes attachment and bonding, improves parental confidence, and helps to promote increased milk production and breastfeeding success.

A 2017 study found that the psychological benefits of kangaroo care for parents of preterm infants are fairly extensive. Research shows that the use of kangaroo care is linked to lower parental anxiety levels. It was shown to decrease anxiety scores in both mothers and fathers, unrelated to parents&#x27; marital status. Kangaroo care has also been shown to lead to greater confidence in parenting skills. Parents who used kangaroo care displayed higher confidence in their ability to care for their child. It has been shown to positively impact breastfeeding as well, with mothers producing larger amounts of milk for longer periods of time.

===For fathers===

Both preterm and full term infants benefit from SSC for the first few weeks of life with the baby&#x27;s father as well. The new baby is familiar with the father&#x27;s voice, and it is believed that contact with the father helps the infant to stabilize and promotes father to infant bonding. If the infant&#x27;s mother had a caesarean birth, the father can hold their baby in SSC while the mother recovers from the anesthetic.

A 2016 study looked at international literature reviews of early SSC benefits for infants and fathers. Their findings for infants included:
* Swedish and German reviews found that father SSC is as effective as mother SSC in raising a baby&#x27;s temperature, and there is no difference between father and mother skin-to-skin on biophysical measures of the baby&#x27;s expenditure of energy.
* A Swedish review found that babies experiencing father SSC had significantly higher blood glucose levels than babies who were placed in an incubator. A higher glucose level protects a baby from cold temperatures.
* A Swedish review found that babies who experienced father SSC showed lower levels of salivary cortisol when handled, which indicates a lower stress response.
* A Swedish review found that babies receiving father SSC were more easily comforted and stopped crying more quickly than babies that had been separated from a parent.
* A Swedish review found that prefeeding behaviors, such as rooting and sucking, were less frequent among the infants who received father SSC. Infants receiving father SSC started breastfeeding a little later than those receiving SSC only from their mothers.

Looking at the review, researchers found that SSC was of benefit to fathers as well. Their findings included:
* A Colombian study focused on India found that fathers who provided SSC to preterm infants exhibited more caring behaviours and developed a more sensitive approach to their infants.
* A Colombian randomized control trial found that after a pre-term birth, father SSC was linked to better cognitive development of the infant and more engagement by the father when the couple returned to their home.
* Reviews done in the US and Sweden showed that fathers who provided SSC felt less stress, were less anxious, and had a better relationship with the mother.
* Reviews done in Denmark and Sweden found that father SSC, like mother SSC, promotes verbal interaction between infant and parent within minutes of the birth. The review also found that fathers who have experienced SSC participated more in infant care and felt more in control when handling unexpected situations.

===Following cesarean section birth===

Although the WHO and UNICEF recommend that infants born by cesarean section should also have SSC as soon as the mother is alert and responsive, a 2014 review of medical literature found that many hospitals were not providing SSC following a C-section. Immediate SSC following a spinal or epidural anesthetic is possible because the mother remains alert; however, after a general anesthetic, the father or other family member may provide SSC until the mother is able.

It is known that, during the hours of labor before a vaginal birth, a woman&#x27;s body begins to produce oxytocin which aids in the bonding process, and the authors believe that SSC can be of special importance following a C-section birth. Indeed, women reported that they felt that SSC had helped them to feel close to and bond with their infant. The review reported comments made by mothers such as &quot;My baby calms down right away when I put him to my chest. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s related to holding him skin‐to‐skin during the cesarean—but I think it is.&quot; Newborns were also found to cry less and relax quicker when they had SSC with their father as well. There is evidence that women who give birth by C-section are less likely to breastfeed and those that do have increased difficulties in establishing breastfeeding. The review, however, found that immediate or early SSC increased the likelihood of successful breastfeeding.

===Promotes breastfeeding===

According to some authorities, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that early SSC of mother and baby stimulates breastfeeding behavior in the baby. Newborn infants who are immediately placed on their mother&#x27;s skin have a natural instinct to latch on to the breast and start nursing, typically within one hour of being born. It is thought that immediate SSC provides a form of imprinting that makes subsequent feeding significantly easier. The WHO reports that, in addition to more successful breastfeeding, SSC between a mother and her newborn baby immediately after delivery also reduces crying, improves mother to infant interaction, and keeps baby warm. According to studies quoted by UNICEF, babies have been observed to naturally follow a unique process which leads to a first breastfeed. After birth, babies who are placed skin to skin on their mothers chest will:
* Initially babies cry briefly—a very distinctive birth cry
* Then, they will enter a stage of relaxation, recovering from the birth
* Then the baby will start to wake up
* Then begin to move, initially little movements, perhaps of the arms, shoulders, and head
* As these movements increase, the baby will actually start to crawl toward the breast
* Once the baby has found the breast and therefore the food source, there is a period of rest. Often, this can be mistaken as the baby is not hungry or wanting to feed
* After resting, the baby will explore and get familiar with the breast, perhaps by nuzzling, smelling, and licking before attaching

Providing that there are no interruptions, all babies are said to follow this process and it is suggested that trying to rush the process or interruptions such as removing the baby to weigh or measure is counterproductive and may lead to problems at subsequent breastfeeds.

For mothers with low milk supply, increasing SSC is recommended, as it promotes more frequent feeding and stimulates the milk ejection reflex, prompting the body to produce more milk.

=== Pain control ===
SSC is effective in reducing pain in infants during painful procedures. There appears to be no difference between mothers and others who provide SSC during medical treatments.

=== KMC as a neuroprotective intervention on the brain development ===
The Kangaroo Foundation research team in partnership with Colombian and Canadian university teams were able to locate and engage almost 200 adults that represent 70% of the randomized cohort of infants that received KMC 20 years earlier. The team performed a cross-sectional evaluation of neurophysiology and neuroimaging with the application of a neuropsychological test battery. Results already published show that KMC should be considered a neuroprotective drug for the immature brain of the premature child. KMC allows a multisensory stimulation (olfactory, auditory, tactile, sensitive, and proprioceptive) that allows this immature brain to grow and connect in the best available condition.

===For institutions===
Kangaroo care often results in reduced hospital stays, reduced need for expensive healthcare technology, increased parental involvement and teaching opportunities, and better use of healthcare dollars.

=== Additional evidence for SSC ===
There are a number of early studies on the impact of SSC on the health of all newly born humans, including a 1979 study that showed increased breastfeeding rates when SSC started at birth and when early breastfeeding was encouraged every two hours.

A randomized controlled trial published in 2004 reported that babies born between became physiologically stable in SSC starting from birth, compared to similar babies in incubators. In another randomized controlled trial conducted in Ethiopia, survival improved when SSC was started before six hours of age.

In the 1990s, studies began to note a series of innate behaviors in full term infants when placed in SSC with their mothers. One 2011 study described a sequence of nine innate behaviors as:
 It is believed that

A Cochrane review on &quot;Early skin-to-skin contact for mothers and their healthy babies&quot;, updated in 2015, provided clinical support for the scientific rationale but looked at evidence for early SSC for healthy babies. The available evidence showed that early SSC was associated with increased rates of breastfeeding, and some evidence of improved physiological outcomes (early stability of the heart rate and breathing) for the babies.

== Technique ==
Kangaroo care seeks to provide restored closeness of the newborn with family members by placing the infant in direct SSC with one of them. This ensures physiological and psychological warmth and bonding. The parent&#x27;s stable body temperature helps to regulate the neonate&#x27;s temperature more smoothly than an incubator and allows for readily accessible breastfeeding when the mother holds the baby this way.

While this model of infant care is substantially different from the typical Western neonatal intensive care unit procedures, the two are not mutually exclusive, and it is estimated that more than 200 neonatal intensive care units practice kangaroo care. One survey found that 82% of neonatal intensive care units use kangaroo care in the US.

In kangaroo care, the baby wears only a small diaper and a hat and is placed in a flexed (fetal position) with maximum SSC on parent&#x27;s chest. The baby is secured with a wrap that goes around the naked torso of the adult, providing the baby with proper support and positioning (maintain flexion), constant containment without pressure points or creases, and protecting from air drafts (thermoregulation). If it is cold, the parent may wear a shirt or hospital gown with an opening to the front and a blanket over the wrap for the baby.

The tight bundling is enough to stimulate the baby: vestibular stimulation from the parent&#x27;s breathing and chest movement, auditory stimulation from the parent&#x27;s voice and natural sounds of breathing and the heartbeat, touch by the skin of the parent, the wrap, and the natural tendency to hold the baby. All this stimulation is important for the baby&#x27;s development.

&quot;Birth Kangaroo Care&quot; places the baby in kangaroo care with the mother within one minute after birth and up to the first feeding. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends this practice, with minimal disruption for babies that do not require life support. The baby&#x27;s head must be dried immediately after birth and then the baby is placed with a hat on the mother&#x27;s chest. Measurements etc. are performed after the first feeding. According to the US Institute of Kangaroo Care, healthy babies should maintain SSC method for about three months so that both baby and mother are established in breastfeeding and have achieved physiological recovery from the birth process.

For premature babies, this method can be used continuously around the clock or for sessions of no less than one hour in duration (the length of one full sleep cycle). It can be started as soon as the baby is stabilized, so it may be at birth or within hours, days, or weeks after birth.

Kangaroo care is different from the practice of babywearing. In kangaroo care, the adult and the baby are skin-to-skin and chest-to-chest, securing the position of the baby with a stretchy wrap, and it is practiced to provide developmental care to premature babies for six months and full-term newborns for three months. In babywearing, the adult and the child are fully clothed, the child may be in the front or back of the adult, it can be done with many different types of carriers and slings, and it is commonly practiced with infants and toddlers.

In primates, early SSC is part of a universal reproductive behavior, and early separation is used as a research modality to test the harmful effects on early development. Research suggests that, for all mammals, the maternal environment (or place of care) is the primary requirement for regulation of all physiological needs (homeostasis), maternal absence leads to dysregulation and adaptation to adversity.

In mainstream clinical medicine, KMC is used as an adjunct to advanced technology that requires maternal infant separation. However, SSC may have a better scientific rationale than the incubator. All other supportive technology can be provided as part of care to extremely LBW babies during SSC and appears to produce a better effect.

Based on the scientific rationale, it has been suggested that SSC should be initiated immediately, to avoid the harmful effects of separation (Bergman Curationis). In terms of classification and proper defining for research purposes, the following aspects that categorize and define SSC have been proposed:
* Initiation time, (minutes, hours from birth), ideal is zero separation.
* Dose of SSC, (hours per day, or as percentage of day), ideal &gt;90%.
* Duration, (measured in days or weeks from birth), ideally until infant refuses.

Safe technique should ensure that obstructive apnea cannot occur. Since the mother must be able to sleep to provide adequate dose, this requires keeping the airway safely open, and close containment to mother&#x27;s bare chest using a garment, various of these are described in the WHO guidelines.

The primary provider of SSC should be the parent or caregiver, but other family members can also be used. Since SSC is basic to early bonding and attachment, it should probably not be done by hospital staff and other surrogates.

==Terminology==
Kangaroo care is likely the most widely used term in the US for SSC. Gene Cranston Anderson may have been the first to coin the term kangaroo care in the US. The defining feature of this is however for skin-to-skin contact (SSC, or sometimes STS). This is used synonymously with &quot;skin-to-skin care&quot;. Nils Bergman, one of the founders of the Kangaroo Mother Care Movement, argues that, since SSC is a place of care, not a kind of care in itself, SSC should be the preferred term.

KMC is a broader package of care defined by the WHO. KMC originally referred only to care of LMW and preterm infants and is defined as a care strategy including three main components: kangaroo position, nutrition, and discharge. Kangaroo position means direct SSC between mother and baby but can include father, other family member, or surrogate. The infant should be upright on the chest, and the airway secured with safe technique. (The term KMC is commonly used to mean SSC, despite its definition from the WHO as including a broader strategy). Kangaroo nutrition implies exclusive breastfeeding, with additional support as required but with the aim of achieving ultimately exclusive breastfeeding. Kangaroo discharge requires that the infant is sent home early, meaning as soon as the mother is breastfeeding and able to provide all basic care herself. In Colombia in 1985, this took place at weights around , with oxygen cylinders for home use; the reason was that overcrowding in their hospital meant that three babies in an incubator would result in potentially lethal cross-infections. An essential part of this is close followup and access to daily visits.

== History ==
An early example of skin-to-skin infant care is the traditional Inuit woman&#x27;s garment, the &quot;amauti&quot;, had a large pouch at the back where the baby would sit against the mother&#x27;s bare back. This skin-to-skin approach is also present in many other cultures around the world.

Peter de Chateau in Sweden first described studies of &quot;early contact&quot; with mother and baby at birth in 1976, but the articles do not describe specifically that this was SSC. Klaus and Kennell did very similar work in the US, more well known in the context of early maternal-infant bonding. The first reported use of the term &quot;skin-to-skin contact&quot; is by Thomson in 1979 and quotes the work of de Chateau in its rationale. The inception of Kangaroo Mother Care happens in Bogota, Colombia, which included the use of skin-to-skin as part of a multiprong approach to LBW infant care, together with exclusive breastfeeding, early discharge, among other aspect.

In 1978, due to increasing morbidity and mortality rates in the Instituto Materno Infantil NICU in Bogotá, Colombia, Edgar Rey Sanabria, professor of neonatology at Department of Paediatry National University of Colombia, and the next year Hector Martinez Gomez as coordinator, introduced a method to alleviate the shortage of caregivers and lack of resources. They suggested that mothers have continuous SSC with their premature or LBW babies to keep them warm and to give exclusive breastfeeding as needed. This freed up overcrowded incubator space and care givers.

SSC is the cornerstone of KMC and initially adopted with the goal of thermal regulation. The SSC of the kangaroo position is done in an upright prono position, preferably on the mother, in a frog position and with an elastic support that allows a support of the position at the same time as it allows the child to make small movements as when he was in the womb. It is necessary to ensure the freedom of the respiratory tract, the position is continuous to ensure the thermal regulation or alternates with an incubator if the child or their mother does not tolerate the position anymore. The mother learns to feed the baby at short intervals. As soon as the mother feels able to carry her growing baby and feed it, she can go home with a close monitoring.

Another feature of kangaroo care was early discharge in the kangaroo position despite prematurity. It has proven successful in improving survival rates of premature and low birth weight newborns and in lowering the risks of nosocomial infection, severe illness, and lower respiratory tract disease. It also increased exclusive breastfeeding and for a longer duration and improved maternal satisfaction and confidence.

Rey Sanabria and Martinez Gomez published their results in 1981 in Spanish and used the term &quot;Kangaroo Mother Method&quot;. This was brought to the attention of English speaking health professionals in an article by Whitelaw and Sleath in 1985. Gene Cranston Anderson and Susan Ludington were instrumental in introducing this to North America.

In 1989, a group of health professionals, including Nathalie Charpak, began the evaluation and dissemination of KMC in Colombia and began applying a scientific rigorous research approach to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of KMC. In 1994, they created the Fundacion Canguro o Kangaroo Foundation, which has trained almost a hundred medical teams from more than 50 countries in KMC. The foundation continues to be a center for research, dissemination, and training in KMC.

In 1996, 30 interested researchers convened by Adriano Cattaneo and colleagues in November 1996 in Trieste, Italy, together with the WHO represented by Jelka Zupan, decided to adopt the original term &quot;Kangaroo Mother Care&quot; created by Rey Sanabria in 1978, in Colombia.

An International Network of Kangaroo Mother Care (INK) was convened at the Trieste meeting and has overseen workshops and conferences every two years. After Trieste, meetings were held all over the world every two years, with major support from the Fundacion Canguro. These include: in Bogotá, Colombia, 1998; Yogyakarta, Indonesia, 2000; Cape Town, South Africa, 2002; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2004; Cleveland, US, 2006; Uppsala, Sweden, 2008; Quebec, Canada, 2010; Ahmedabad, India, 2012; Kigali, Rwanda, 2014; Trieste 2016; Bogotá 2018; Manille 2020 (virtual); and Madrid, Spain, 2022. Papers have been published on the results of these workshop, the latest being in 2020.

An informal steering committee coordinates these meetings: (alphabetically, current) Nils Bergman, Adriano Cattaneo, Nathalie Charpak, Juan Gabriel Ruiz, Kerstin Hedberg-Nyqvist, Ochi Ibe, Susan Ludington, Socorro Mendoza, Mantoa Mokrachane, Carmen Pallas, Réjean Tessier, and Rekha Udani.

Susan Ludington maintains a &quot;KC BIB&quot; (bibliography) on behalf of INK, endeavoring to be a complete inventory of any and all publications relevant to KMC. This is also broken down in an analysis of 120 charts, in which specific outcomes are collated.

The International Kangaroo Care Awareness Day has been celebrated worldwide on 15 May since 2011. It is a day to increase awareness to enhance the practice of kangaroo care in NICUS, Post Partum, Labor and Delivery, and any hospital unit that has babies up to three months of age.

== Society and culture ==

The International Kangaroo Care Awareness Day, sometimes referred to as World Kangaroo Care Day, or just Kangaroo Care Day, is celebrated on 15 May since 2011. It is a day to increase awareness, education, and celebration to enhance the practice of kangaroo care/SAC globally. Healthcare professionals, parents, and volunteers around the world show their support, in their own way, for improving kangaroo care practice to benefit babies, parents, and society at large.

World Prematurity Day is observed on 17 November each year to raise awareness of preterm birth and the concerns of preterm babies and their families worldwide. It is also the day to speak about KMC and prematurity and family centered care.

==Controversy==
The main controversy among proponents of KMC relates to eligibility to initiate kangaroo position: in the original Rey Sanabria–Martinez Gomez model and as described in the WHO guidelines, the infant should be stable to &quot;tolerate skin-to-skin contact&quot;.

For the Fundacion Canguro of Bogota, the kangaroo position should be started as soon as possible after birth and for as long as possible until the child can no longer tolerate the position. If the mother cannot carry the child, the father or a family member can replace her temporarily.

From a biological and neuroscience perspective, others argue that it is separation from mother that causes the instability.

Regarding &#x27;kangaroo nutrition&#x27;, there is little controversy, with accumulating evidence for the benefits of breastfeeding as such, and evidence that even preterm infants can exclusively breastfeed.

The Kangaroo Method, known for its safety and low cost, can help prevent complications associated with premature birth. However, more evidence is needed to understand its effects on neonatal physiology, growth, and development. Although consistent results in various contexts support its widespread use, further research is necessary to determine factors such as the optimal daily duration, parental roles, effective inclusion of fathers and other family members, immunological benefits, and its application in patients under phototherapy, among others. Future qualitative studies will help implement the MC in a culturally adapted manner. More studies are needed to resolve discrepancies and establish recommendations based on more solid and homogeneous evidence.

<text>The 75th Innovation Command (75th IC) is a separate command of the United States Army Reserve.

The 75th IC was activated as the 75th Infantry Division in World War II. Inactivated in 1945, it was reactivated in 1952 at Houston, Texas, from the assets of the disbanded 22nd Armored Division of the United States Army Organized Reserves. It was active as an Infantry Division from 1952 to 1957, when it was reorganized and redesignated as the 75th Maneuver Area Command (MAC), and given responsibility for planning and conducting Field Training Exercises (FTX) and Command Post Exercises (CPX) for all Reserve Component units west of the Mississippi River. In 1993, the 75th MAC was redesignated as the 75th Division (Training Support) in the Army Reserve, which in later years became designated the 75th Training Command. In January 2003, numerous units of the 75th were mobilized to train other Army Reserve and Army National Guard units deploying overseas in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF). In January 2018, the 75th was reorganized into the 75th Innovation Command with its training divisions reassigned to the 84th Training Command.

===Combat chronicle===

These combat chronicles, current as of October 1948, are drawn from &quot;The Army Almanac: A Book of Facts Concerning the Army of the United States&quot;.

The 75th Infantry Division arrived in Britain, 22 November 1944; headquarters having arrived on 2 November 1944. After a brief training program, the division landed at Le Havre and Rouen, 13 December, and bivouacked at Yvetot on the 14th. When the Von Rundstedt offensive broke in the Ardennes, the 75th was rushed to the front and entered defensive combat, 23 December 1944, alongside the Ourthe River, advanced to the Aisne River, and entered Grandmenil, 5 January 1945. The division relieved the 82d Airborne Division along the Salm River, 8 January, and strengthened its defensive positions until 17 January when it attacked, taking Vielsalm and other towns in the area.

Shifting to the Seventh Army area in Alsace—Lorraine, the 75th crossed the Colmar Canal, 1 February, and took part in the liberation of Colmar and in the fighting between the Rhine River and the Vosges Mountains. It crossed the Marne-Rhine Canal and reached the Rhine, 7 February. After a brief rest at Lunéville, it returned to combat, relieving the 6th British Airborne Division on a defensive front along the Meuse (&quot;Maas&quot;), near Roermond, in the Netherlands, on 21 February. From 13 to 23 March, the 75th patrolled a sector along the west bank of the Rhine from Wesel to Homburg, and probed enemy defenses at night.

On 24 March, elements crossed the Rhine in the wake of the 30th and 79th Divisions. Pursuit of the enemy continued as the 75th cleared the Haard Forest, 1 April, crossed the Dortmund-Ems Canal on the 4th, and cleared the approaches to Dortmund, which fell to the 95th Division, 13 April. Around the same time, troops of the division liberated Stalag VI-A, a POW camp where thousands of Soviet and Polish prisoners of war had died of malnutrition and disease. After taking Herdecke, 13 April, the division moved to Braumbauer for rest and rehabilitation, then took over security and military government duties in Westphalia. The father of Randy Pausch was wounded and received a Bronze Star during this time, as related in The Last Lecture.

<text>Edward Rell &quot;Ed&quot; Madigan (January 13, 1936 – December 7, 1994) was a businessman and a Republican Party politician from Lincoln, Illinois. He served almost twenty years in the United States House of Representatives and was U.S. secretary of agriculture under President George H. W. Bush.

==Early life, education, and politics==
Madigan was born in Lincoln on January 13, 1936. He attended Lincoln [Junior] College before starting his own taxicab business. He entered public service as a member of the Lincoln Board of Zoning Appeals from 1965 to 1969. During that time, he was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives where he served from 1967 to 1973.

==U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture==
In November, 1972, he was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was subsequently elected to nine more terms. Madigan narrowly lost the race for minority whip in 1989 to future Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich of Georgia. Madigan served in Congress from 1973 to 1991, when Clayton Keith Yeutter resigned, and Madigan was appointed secretary of agriculture. Serving from 1991 to 1993, Madigan was the first Roman Catholic to serve as secretary of agriculture.

==Death and legacy==
He died of complications from lung cancer on December 7, 1994, at St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Springfield, Illinois, at the age of 58. He and his wife, Evelyn, had three daughters.

Madigan was in charge of implementing the famous 1992 Food Pyramid. This food pyramid suggested 6 to 11 servings of cereals, grains, and breads each day. After the implementation of the food pyramid, Madigan went and worked for Philip Morris. Edward Madigan worked for Philip Morris from 1993 to 1994. He joined the company after his tenure as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture and served as the Senior Vice President for Government Affairs. His role involved handling government relations and navigating the regulatory landscape for Philip Morris during a period of significant change and expansion.

In 1995, Edward R. Madigan State Fish and Wildlife Area, a state park near Lincoln, was renamed in Madigan&#x27;s honor. Edward Madigan came from a politically active family. His younger brother Robert Madigan served as the City Clerk for Lincoln, Illinois for several terms, then sat in the Illinois State Senate for 14 years and finally concluded his public service with a brief term on the Illinois Commerce Commission.

In 1984, Illinois native, and future congressman from Nebraska Don Bacon interned in Madigan&#x27;s Washington, D.C., office.

<doc id="915306" wikidata="Q1041839" url="?curid=915306" title="Better Off Dead (film)">
<text>Better Off Dead is a 1985 American teen black comedy film written and directed by Savage Steve Holland. It stars John Cusack, David Ogden Stiers, Diane Franklin and Kim Darby. The film was released in August 1985.

Initially met with mixed reviews on release, it has since developed a cult following for its unconventionally surreal and absurdist humor.

==Plot==
In the town of Greendale, Northern California, high school student Lane Meyer&#x27;s two main interests are skiing and his girlfriend of six months, Beth. Shortly before Christmas, Beth dumps him for the handsome and popular captain of the ski team, Roy Stalin. 

Roy is an arrogant bully who unfairly rejects Lane at ski team tryouts. Beth also criticizes Lane&#x27;s car, an old station wagon. Although Lane also owns a 1967 Camaro, he has not been able to get it running and it sits dilapitated in the driveway.

Lane lives in a suburban development with his mother Jenny, a ditzy housewife who routinely concocts creepy (and creeping) family meals; his genius little brother Badger, who never speaks but at the age of &quot;almost 8&quot; can build powerful lasers and attract trashy women from &quot;How-to&quot; books; and his lawyer father, Al, who daily tries to stop the menacing paperboy, Johnny, from breaking his garage door windows with thrown newspapers. 

Furthermore, Johnny claims that the Meyers owe him two dollars for newspapers, and persistently hounds Lane, yelling &quot;I want my two dollars!&quot; Lane also regularly encounters two Japanese drag racers, one who only speaks in Japanese and the other who learned to speak English by listening to Howard Cosell.

Lane cannot move past Beth&#x27;s rejection, so decides that death is the only way out of his misery. He makes several half-hearted attempts at suicide, which all comically fail. With the help of his best friend, Charles de Mar (who in lieu of not being able to get &quot;real drugs&quot; in their &quot;bodaciously small town,&quot; constantly inhales everyday substances like Jell-O, snow, and nitrous oxide from a whipped cream can), Lane tries to ski the K-12, the highest peak in town, in hopes of getting Beth back, but wipes out. 

Lane is further embarrassed when he gets fired from his humiliating fast food job at Pig Burgers in front of Roy and Beth, who are there on a date. To top it all, he increasingly begins to suffer from neurotic hallucinations owing to the mounting frustrations in his life.

As Lane attempts to either end his life or win back his ex-girlfriend, he gradually gets to know a new girl: a French foreign-exchange student named Monique, who has a crush on him. She is staying with Lane&#x27;s overbearing neighbor Mrs. Smith, who continually tries to force Monique into being a girlfriend for her socially awkward son Ricky. 

The Smiths are so annoying that Monique pretends she cannot speak English. She is a Los Angeles Dodgers fan, who turns out to be an excellent auto mechanic and skier. Monique both helps Lane fix his Camaro and tries to build his confidence. 

When Roy insults Monique, Lane challenges him to a ski race down the K-12, with the winner to be captain of the ski team. She helps Lane prepare for the race, which he ultimately wins despite losing a ski and being pursued by Johnny. Beth rushes to embrace Lane at the finish line, but he rejects her and after besting Ricky (who attempts to keep Lane from rescuing Monique from the restraints of his mother) in a ski-pole swordfight, drives off with Monique in his Camaro. 

Lane and Monique are last seen kissing on home plate at Dodger Stadium, with Johnny bicycling towards them, while in a mid-credit scene Badger launches a homemade space shuttle from his room through the roof of the house.

==Production==
Parts of the film were shot in Alta, Brighton, and Snowbird, in Utah. The Meyers home is located at 1636 Virginia Avenue, in Glendale, CA. Across the street, at 1633 Virginia, is the home of the Smith family and French exchange student Monique Junot. Lane&#x27;s high school is Hollywood High School, located at 1521 North Highland Avenue, in Los Angeles, CA. Pig Burgers was filmed at Sandy&#x27;s Char Burger at 6223 Lankershim Blvd. The restaurant has since gone out of business, but the building still sports the burger signage. The exterior of the school dance sequence was shot at Anderson W. Clark Magnet High School in La Crescenta, CA. The street on which Lane is consistently challenged by the Japanese drag racers is located near the foothills of Monrovia, CA. Several other driving scenes were shot in the Los Angeles suburbs of Duarte and Sierra Madre.

The hand-drawn animation in the movie was animated by Savage Steve Holland&#x27;s collaborator Bill Kopp, who would later work with him on &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot; (1986) and &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot;. A dream sequence where hamburgers and fries come to life was produced in stop motion.

According to an interview with Diane Franklin on the RetroZest Podcast, actor Yano Anaya, who played one of Johnny Gasparini&#x27;s paperboy gang members, also looped all of Demian Slade&#x27;s dialogue as Johnny the paperboy. Anaya also played bully Grover Dill in &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983) and young Michael Anthony in the music video for Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; (1984).

==Reception==
&quot;Better Off Dead&quot; was one of the few films critics Siskel &amp; Ebert featured on their weekly television show &quot;At the Movies&quot; while bypassing entirely in their respective Chicago newspapers. They gave the film &quot;two thumbs down&quot;. Bill Cosford of &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; wrote, &quot;&quot;Better Off Dead&quot; has the body of a tired teen comedy but the soul of an inspired student film; it&#x27;s the first movie in a long time to interrupt itself periodically with flights of animated fancy.&quot;

According to Holland, Cusack did not like the film and walked out of a screening during the filming of Holland&#x27;s &quot;One Crazy Summer&quot; (in which he also starred), later confronting Holland, saying &quot;Better Off Dead&quot; &quot;was the worst thing I have ever seen. I will never trust you as a director ever again, so don&#x27;t speak to me.&quot; Holland claimed that Cusack felt he had been made to look foolish and that his comments &quot;made me not care about movies anymore&quot;. However, in a 2013 Reddit &quot;Ask Me Anything&quot; chat, Cusack was asked if he hated filming &quot;Better Off Dead&quot;, and responded, &quot;No, I just thought it could have been better, but I think that about almost all my films. I have nothing against the film... Glad people love it still.&quot;

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 77% based on 26 reviews, with an average rating of 6.90/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Better Off Dead&quot; is an anarchic mix of black humor and surreal comedy anchored by John Cusack&#x27;s winsome, charming performance.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received a score of 51 based on 7 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

The film&#x27;s soundtrack was produced primarily by Rupert Hine.

The opening track, &quot;With One Look (The Wildest Dream)&quot;, was produced by Hine and features Cy Curnin and Jamie West-Oram of the Fixx on lead vocals and guitars, respectively. Hine had previously worked with Curnin and West-Oram, and also contributed vocals to the song. The following track, &quot;Arrested by You&quot;, as well as &quot;Better Off Dub (Title Music)&quot; and &quot;Race the K-12 (Instrumental)&quot;, were performed solely by Hine. &quot;Arrested by You&quot; was covered by Dusty Springfield on her 1990 album, &quot;Reputation&quot;.

&quot;Dancing in Isolation&quot; features Terri Nunn of Berlin on lead vocals. Hine produced the song and was reportedly under consideration to produce an album for Berlin.

&quot;Come to Your Rescue&quot; was performed by Thinkman, a group formed by, and including, Hine for the purpose of restoring his solo career without the music press knowing about it. West-Oram also provided guitar work to this song, as well as the instrumental &quot;The Falcon Beat&quot;.

The only two tracks on the CD without Hine&#x27;s involvement are &quot;A Little Luck&quot; and &quot;One Way Love (Better Off Dead)&quot;. Elizabeth Daily, credited on the soundtrack as E.G. Daily, sang lead vocals on both songs and also performed them in the film during the high school dance scene.

A number of songs that appear in the film do not appear on the CD soundtrack, including Howard Jones&#x27; &quot;Like to Get to Know You Well&quot;, Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Everybody Wants Some!!&quot;, Neil Sedaka&#x27;s &quot;Breaking Up Is Hard to Do&quot;, Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover&quot;, Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Foxy Lady&quot;, Frank Sinatra singing &quot;A Man Alone&quot; by Rod McKuen, Hall &amp; Oates&#x27; &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;, and Muddy Waters&#x27; &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;.

<doc id="915309" wikidata="Q7130852" url="?curid=915309" title="Panera Bread">
<text>Panera Bread is an American chain of bakery-café fast casual restaurants with over 2,000 locations, all of which are in the United States and Canada. Its headquarters are in Sunset Hills, Missouri. The chain operates as Saint Louis Bread Company in the Greater St. Louis area, with over 100 locations.

Panera offers a wide array of pastries and baked goods, such as bagels, brownies, cookies, croissants, muffins, and scones. These, along with Panera&#x27;s artisan breads, are typically baked by an on-staff baker the day before. Aside from the bakery section, Panera has a regular menu for dine-in or takeout including flatbreads, pizzas, warm grain bowls, panini, pasta, salads, sandwiches, side choices, and soups, as well as coffee, espresso drinks, frozen drinks, fruit smoothies, hot chocolate, iced drinks, lattes, lemonade, and tea.

Panera Bread, formerly owned by Au Bon Pain, is currently owned by JAB Holding Company, which is, in turn, owned by the Reimann family of Germany. Panera was once the largest provider of free Wi-Fi hotspots in the United States.

==History==

Ken and Linda Rosenthal founded the St. Louis Bread Company in 1987 with the first location in Kirkwood, Missouri. The Rosenthals invested $150,000 and received a $150,000 Small Business Administration loan.

Au Bon Pain Co., a public company, purchased the St. Louis Bread Company in 1993 for $23 million.

In 1997, Au Bon Pain changed the company name to Panera, from a word that has roots in the Latin word for &quot;breadbasket&quot; (Classical , Vulgar ) and is identical to the word for &quot;breadbasket&quot; in Spanish and Catalan. It kept its original name for locations in Missouri. At the same time, the St. Louis Bread Company renovated its 20 bakery-cafés in the St. Louis area.

In May 1999, Au Bon Pain Co. sold Au Bon Pain to the firm Bruckmann, Rosser, Sherrill &amp; Co. for $78 million to focus on the Panera Bread chain.

In 2000, Panera Bread moved its headquarters to Richmond Heights, Missouri.

In 2007, Panera Bread purchased a 51% stake in Paradise Bakery &amp; Café, a Phoenix metropolitan area-based concept with over 70 locations in 10 states, predominantly in the west and southwest, for $21.1 million. The company purchased the balance of Paradise in June 2009.

=== Expansion into Canada ===
In October 2008, Panera Bread expanded into Canada, opening locations in Richmond Hill, Thornhill, Oakville, and Mississauga in the Greater Toronto Area.

A class action lawsuit was filed against the company in February 2008, alleging it failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company&#x27;s financial well-being, business relationships, and prospects. In February 2011, Panera agreed to pay $5.75 million to shareholders while admitting no wrongdoing, settling the lawsuit.

In November 2010, Panera Bread relocated its headquarters to Sunset Hills while vacating its Richmond Heights headquarters and Brentwood, Missouri offices. The company leased additional space for its headquarters in 2013.

=== Ordering and delivery ===
In May 2014, Panera unveiled &quot;Panera 2.0&quot;, a series of integrated technologies including new capabilities for digital ordering, payment, operations, and consumption. It includes tablet kiosks with iPads, which the company calls &quot;Fast Lane&quot;, where customers may place an order and pay without approaching the counter. Customers can also place orders and pay via an app on their smartphone or tablet. In 2017, digital orders accounted for over $1 billion in orders or 26% of sales.

The company introduced delivery services in May 2018, servicing 897 cities in 43 states and employing its own drivers. According to the company, this created 13,000 jobs.

=== Rebranding, acquisitions, and use of technology ===
====2010s====
Paradise Bakery &amp; Café locations were rebranded in September 2015 as Panera Bread.

In the fourth quarter of 2015, Panera acquired a majority stake in Tatte Bakery &amp; Cafe, a bakery-cafe concept chain with locations in the Boston area, later opening in metro Washington D.C.

On March 23, 2016, Panera opened its 2,000th location, a cafe in Elyria, Ohio.

In January 2017, Panera announced its food menu was free of artificial colors, flavors, sweeteners, and preservatives.

JAB Holding Company acquired the company on July 11, 2017, for $7.5 billion.

On November 8, 2017, Panera announced that founder Ron Shaich was stepping down as CEO, and company president Blaine Hurst would take over. Shaich remained chairman. The company also announced the acquisition of Au Bon Pain.

Panera divested Tatte Bakery &amp; Café to Act III Holdings, LLC, owned by Shaich in January 2018.

In January 2018, the company formed a consulting business to help restaurants remove artificial ingredients from their menus.

On April 2, 2018, Brian Krebs reported that the Panera Bread website had leaked between 7 million and 37 million customer records—including names, email, and physical addresses, customer loyalty account numbers, birthdays, and last four digits of the customers&#x27; credit card numbers—for at least eight months before the site was taken offline. Panera was notified privately about the vulnerability in August 2017 but failed to fix it until after it was disclosed publicly eight months later. Panera said the leak affected fewer than 10,000 customers and had been fixed.

====2020s====
On October 28, 2020, Panera announced they would add pizza to their menu to increase dinner options for customers.

Panera announced on August 25, 2021, that it had merged with Caribou Coffee and Einstein Bros. Bagels to form Panera Brands.

In August 2022, the company announced that it was testing the use of artificial intelligence in its drive-thru lanes via two locations in upstate New York. It used OpenCity&#x27;s voice ordering technology, Tori. At the time of the announcement, roughly 45% of the chain&#x27;s locations have drive-thru lanes. In making this move, the firm was joining other firms in the restaurant industry, like McDonald&#x27;s, Burger King, and Taco Bell, and it came on top of other uses of artificial intelligence at the chain.

In September 2022, Panera announced that legacy St. Louis Bread Co. locations outside St. Louis City and St. Louis County would be rebranded as Panera when remodeled, with locations in the inner core of the metro retaining the Bread Co. name. One location in St. Louis County is named Panera as it is a prototype of the &quot;Next Gen&quot; restaurant design.

In December 2023, it was learned that Panera Bread confidentially filed to go public again. The company was last publicly traded in 2017 before being acquired by JAB Holding for $7.5 billion. On February 14, 2025, Ken Rosenthal, the founder of St. Louis Bread Company, died at age 81 due to complications from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Social responsibility==

=== Panera Cares: non-profit restaurants ===
In 2010, the company&#x27;s nonprofit foundation created Panera Cares, a &quot;Pay what you can&quot;, pay it forward (PIF), and traditional charitable behavior restaurant in its home market of St. Louis. CEO Ron Shaich based the idea on an NBC profile of the SAME Cafe in Denver, Colorado. It later expanded the concept to Dearborn, Michigan; Portland, Oregon; Chicago; and Boston. Several of their sites served 3,500 customers weekly. The Panera Cares in Chicago shut down at the end of January 2015. The Panera Cares in Portland, Oregon shut down at the end of June 2016. The original location near St. Louis closed in January 2018. The last location in Boston closed on February 15, 2019.

=== Caged and cage-free eggs ===
On November 5, 2015, Panera pledged that it would use only cage-free eggs in all of its stores by 2020. Panera also announced the addition of more plant-based proteins, such as edamame and organic quinoa, to its menu. At the time of the announcement, the company said it was 21% cage-free in the roughly 70 million eggs it used in 2015. In December 2016, it published its third animal welfare progress report, announcing new efforts to improve broiler chicken welfare. In 2021, Panera announced that it had transitioned to cage-free eggs for 65% of its egg supply but not yet the remaining 35%.

=== Panera Bread on climate change ===
Panera Bread includes a cool food pledge in its campaign to curb global warming. Though associated with high carbon emissions, meat consumption in the United States remains high. Also, beef production accounts for about 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions. Panera Bread provides American consumers with dietary guidelines to help them change their eating patterns to help reduce carbon emissions. Through the Cool Foods pledge, the company uses traffic lights for different healthy and unhealthy foods. Foods labeled green are considered healthy, while those labeled yellow should be consumed in moderation. In 2015, Panera Bread also announced its policy against the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), making it the first food chain in the country to question the safety and environmental friendliness of these foods.

=== Community giving ===
The Day-End Dough-Nation program provides unsold bread and baked goods to local area hunger relief agencies and charities. Panera Bread bakery-cafes donate $100 million worth of unsold bread and baked goods annually to local organizations in need. Panera also supports events held by nonprofit organizations serving those in need by donating a certificate or fresh bakery products.

== Controversies and lawsuits ==

===Violation of California Labor Code===
In 2009 and 2011, class action lawsuits were filed by former workers alleging that the company violated the California Labor Code, failed to pay overtime, failed to provide meal and rest periods, failed to pay employees upon termination, and violated California&#x27;s Unfair Competition Law. Panera paid $5 million to settle all claims and denied any wrongdoing.

===Racial discrimination allegation (2011)===
In 2011, a former employee filed a racial discrimination lawsuit alleging that he was fired after repeatedly having a Black man work the cash register instead of putting him in a less visible location, and assigning &quot;pretty young girls&quot; as the cashiers, as requested by supervisors. The plaintiff also said he was fired after requesting another month off after returning from three months of sick leave. Panera said that it &quot;does not discriminate based on national origin, race or sex&quot; and that the plaintiff &quot;was terminated because he had used all of his medical leave and was unable to return to work&quot;. The plaintiff worked in a store owned by franchisee Sam Covelli, who also owns the stores that were involved in the 2003 racial discrimination lawsuit. Covelli Enterprises is the single largest franchisee of Panera Bread with nearly 300 stores in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Florida. The lawsuit was settled in June 2012.

=== Peanut butter allergy ===
In 2016, a lawsuit was filed after an employee at a Natick, Massachusetts, store put peanut butter on a sandwich, despite being informed that the person receiving the sandwich had a peanut allergy. The plaintiffs charged the company and those employees involved with intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress as well as assault and battery. The recipient of the sandwich was hospitalized briefly.

===Class action for failure to pay overtime wages (2017)===
In December 2017, former employees filed a class action lawsuit against the company, claiming they were not paid overtime wages.

=== &quot;Tabler v. Panera LLC et al&quot; ===
In March 2019, Plaintiff Brianna Tabler in California filed a class action lawsuit, accusing Panera of false advertising and fraud. While Panera&#x27;s former CEO Ron Schaich claimed that Panera&#x27;s menus continue to be completely void of artificial flavors, sweeteners, and ingredients, Tabler argues against the company&#x27;s intentional redaction of the fact that their products contain traces of the synthetic biocide glyphosate. In October 2019, Judge Lucy Koh granted a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Tabler filed an amended complaint in November 2019, to which Panera filed in January 2020 another motion to dismiss. Tabler filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the complaint on July 30, 2020, closing the case.

=== Charged Lemonade lawsuits ===
On September 10, 2022, 21-year-old Sarah Katz, a student at the University of Pennsylvania, purchased and consumed a &quot;supercharged&quot; lemonade drink from a Panera location in Philadelphia. Allegedly, Katz was unaware of the high caffeine content of the drinks, which has been criticized as extremely dangerous; a Panera Charged Lemonade contained 260 mg of caffeine, equivalent to four espresso shots, and the 30-ounce (890 mL) lemonade contained 390 mg (six espressos). Katz suffered from Long QT Type 1 Syndrome, a heart condition that can result in an irregular heartbeat in certain situations. On the same day, Katz went into cardiac arrest while at another restaurant and was transported to the Pennsylvania Presbyterian Hospital, where she suffered another arrest and was pronounced dead.

In October 2023, Katz&#x27;s parents sued Panera for the wrongful death of their daughter caused by misleading labeling and description of the drink. Later in October, amid reports that dispensers had been moved behind the counter to limit access, Panera changed labeling for the drink, noting its caffeine content and need for moderation, and warning potentially sensitive consumers.

In December 2023, a second individual was reported as having died after consuming Panera&#x27;s Charged Lemonade. The individual, Dennis Brown, died at age 46 after reportedly consuming three servings of Charged Lemonade at a Panera location in Fleming Island, Florida. Brown had high blood pressure, a developmental delay, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and a chromosomal disorder that caused a mild intellectual disability and blurry vision, according to a wrongful death lawsuit filed by family members. Social media commentators began to nickname the drink &quot;the lemonade that kills you&quot;.

The caffeine content was later reduced by Panera in December 2023, with the 30-ounce drink reduced to 237 mg and the 20-ounce to 158 mg. In May 2024, the company announced they would begin phasing out the drink.

===Delivery costs===
In February 2024, Panera settled a class-action lawsuit for $2 million, which accused the company a year beforehand of misleading customers from 2020 to 2021 about its costs for delivery orders. Panera did not admit fault in the settlement.

==Awards and recognition==

In 2005, Panera ranked 37th on &quot;Bloomberg BusinessWeek&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;Hot Growth Companies&quot;, earning $38.6 million with a 42.9 percent increase in profits.

In a 2008 &quot;Health&quot; magazine study, Panera Bread was judged North America&#x27;s healthiest fast casual restaurant.

In 2009 and 2012, Zagat named Panera one of the most popular restaurants for eating on the go.

Panera was also rated No. 1 for Best Healthy Option, Best Salad, and Best Facilities, among restaurants with fewer than 5,000 locations in 2009.

<doc id="915315" wikidata="Q3180765" url="?curid=915315" title="Rugrats Go Wild">
<text>Rugrats Go Wild (originally titled The Rugrats Meet the Wild Thornberrys) is a 2003 American animated crossover adventure film based on the Nickelodeon animated television series &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot;. It is the final installment of both the &quot;Rugrats&quot; and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys&quot; film series and the sequel to both the films &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; (2002). The film was the first to feature Nancy Cartwright as the voice of Chuckie Finster following original voice actress Christine Cavanaugh&#x27;s retirement in 2001. The film follows the Rugrats and their families as they prepare for their planned vacation, but eventually get stranded on an uncharted island in the Pacific, where they meet the Wild Thornberrys for the first time.

The film was produced by Nickelodeon Movies and Klasky Csupo and released in theaters on June 13, 2003, by Paramount Pictures. &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; grossed $55.4 million worldwide and unlike its predecessors, it received unfavorable reviews from critics. The film used &quot;Odorama&quot;, which allowed people to smell odors and aromas from the film using scratch and sniff cards (reminiscent of 1960s Smell-O-Vision). This is the only &quot;Rugrats&quot; film to receive a PG rating by the MPAA.

==Plot==
The Rugrats go on an imaginary safari: Tommy impersonates Nigel Thornberry, who is his role model, and spoofs his nature show. The babies and their families are about to go on vacation on a tropical cruise ship, courtesy of Tommy&#x27;s father, Stu. Upon arriving at the pier to depart, they discover that he has instead rented a ramshackle boat as their real vacation. The families are angered that Stu did not consult them on his plans, and during their journey, the boat is flipped over by a rogue wave during a tropical storm. Everyone is forced to abandon the ship and board a life raft as the ship sinks; the group blames Stu.

The next morning, they arrive on a small, seemingly uninhabited island in the South China Sea. The adults make Betty the leader after Didi forbids Stu from volunteering, much to his chagrin. On the opposite side of the island is the famous globe-trotting family, the Thornberrys, out to film a clouded leopard. The kids, except for Angelica, set off to find Nigel to get his help to get them home, for they suspect he is somewhere on the island. Along the way, Chuckie gets lost and runs into the Thornberry&#x27;s son Donnie, who steals his clothes, forcing Chuckie to wear Donnie&#x27;s shorts.

Meanwhile, Eliza Thornberry is exploring the jungle with Darwin, her chimpanzee companion, and runs into Spike, the Pickles&#x27; dog. Since Eliza can talk to animals, Spike is heard speaking; he informs her that his babies are lost somewhere on the island. Under the impression that Spike means he is looking for puppies, Eliza and a reluctant Darwin agree to help him find them. Following a close encounter with Siri, an angry clouded leopard, they learn that he meant human babies.

Simultaneously, Eliza&#x27;s father, Nigel, finds the lost babies. He heads in their direction but ends up tumbling down a hill and suffers amnesia after a coconut falls on his head, which reverts him to his three year-old self. They encounter Siri, but Donnie fends her off; Chuckie finds him and they swap back their clothes. After escaping from Siri on a high-speed pram, the gang lands in a crater. Angelica runs into Debbie Thornberry, and takes off with Debbie in the Thornberry&#x27;s all-purpose mobile communication vehicle (commvee). To get back more quickly, Angelica steals the Thornberry&#x27;s bathysphere and accidentally sinks the commvee in her attempt to pilot it. She manages to find and retrieve the babies and Nigel.

Meanwhile, Stu, has managed to create a working coconut radio. He and the other parents run into Donnie. After chasing him down the beach, they run into Marianne Thornberry, the mother of Eliza and Debbie and the wife of Nigel. Stu&#x27;s coconut radio picks up the babies, as Angelica accidentally turned on the bathysphere&#x27;s radio. Angelica and Susie, while fighting for control, crash the bathysphere at the bottom of the ocean. Nigel hits his head in the crash and reverts back to his normal self. Stu comes up with a plan to raise the commvee, and Marianne then uses the automatic-retrieval system to rescue Nigel and the babies just as the air runs out.

The babies and Nigel are reunited with their respective families, with Stu being thanked and forgiven, he forgives everyone for being harsh on him, and everyone gets on board the cruise they had wanted originally. The Thornberrys join them, too, deciding that they should take a vacation, much to Debbie&#x27;s delight, and Spike vows never to lose his babies again.

==Release==
During its initial theatrical run, &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; was presented in &quot;Smell-O-Vision&quot;. During certain scenes in the movie, an icon would pop up on screen with an item inside of it (example: a smelly shoe). When this happened, audience members would smell a scratch-and-sniff card (which were handed out at the box office) with the corresponding image.

===Marketing===
Among the biggest promotion the film received was Bruce Willis voicing Spike, and the use of &quot;Odorama&quot; cards to enhance the viewing experience, Burger King and Blockbuster released a scratch and sniff piece of cardboard that was to be scratched and sniffed during the run of the movie. The cards would later be released with the DVD release of the movie.

===Controversy===
There were some complaints with the Odorama cards, including the claim that the cards only smelled like cardboard. The Odorama card was considered an homage to John Waters&#x27; 1981 film &quot;Polyester&quot;. Waters felt he was ripped off and realized that New Line Cinema, the studio that released &quot;Polyester&quot;, did not renew the copyright for Odorama. He later said that &quot;a cheque would have been an homage&quot;.

==Home media==
&quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on December 16, 2003, by Paramount Home Entertainment. Most VHS copies included a &quot;Smell-O-Vision&quot; scratch-and-sniff card, as did most initial run DVDs. Later copies of the DVD did not include additional cards, but did retain the option to view the film with the scratch-and-sniff icons on.

On March 15, 2011, along with &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; and &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, the film was re-released in a three-disc movie trilogy collection DVD set, in honor of &quot;Rugrats&quot;&#x27; 20th anniversary. On August 29, 2017, &quot;Rugrats Go Wild&quot; was re-released on DVD. On March 8, 2022, along with &quot;The Rugrats Movie&quot; and &quot;Rugrats in Paris: The Movie&quot;, the film was released on Blu-ray as part of the trilogy movie collection.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film grossed $39 million in the United States and $16 million internationally for a worldwide total of $55 million against a production budget of $25 million. The film opened at #4 behind &quot;Finding Nemo&quot;, &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;, and &quot;Bruce Almighty&quot;.

===Critical response===

On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of based on reviews and an average rating of . The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;The &quot;Rugrats&quot; franchise has gone from fresh to formulaic.&quot; Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 38 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Neil Smith at the BBC gave the film 2 out of 5. Film4 stated the film was not as bad as other reviews suggested but &quot;it just doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to 2002&#x27;s charming and superior &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot;&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

An original soundtrack was released on June 10, 2003, from Hollywood Records.

<text>Marmaduke Lumley (died 1450) was an English priest, Bishop of Carlisle from 1429 to 1450, and Knight Commander of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem. He was a son of Ralph de Lumley, 1st Baron Lumley and Eleanor de Neville. He was elected about 5 December 1429, and consecrated on 16 April 1430. He was Bishop of Lincoln for a short time before his death in December 1450. He was educated at University of Cambridge and was appointed Precentor of Lincoln Cathedral in 1425. He also became Chancellor of the University of Cambridge in 1427 and was Master of Trinity Hall, Cambridge from 1429 to 1443. From 1446 to 1449 he served as Lord High Treasurer of England.

<doc id="915322" wikidata="Q1890697" url="?curid=915322" title="Salchow jump">
<text>The Salchow jump is an edge jump in figure skating. It was named after its inventor, Ulrich Salchow, in 1909. The Salchow is accomplished with a takeoff from the back inside edge of one foot and a landing on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. It is &quot;usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple&quot;. Timing is critical because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge. A Salchow is deemed cheated if the skate blade starts to turn forward before the takeoff, or if it has not turned completely backward when the skater lands back on the ice.

In competitions, the base value of a single Salchow is 0.40, for a double Salchow it is 1.30, for a triple 4.30, 9.70 for a quadruple, and 14 for a quintuple.

==History==

The Salchow jump was named after its inventor, Swedish world champion Ulrich Salchow in 1909. According to writer Ellyn Kestnbaum, American skater Theresa Weld &quot;received reprimands&quot; at the 1920 Olympics &quot;for performing a single Salchow jump because her skirt would fly up to her knees, creating an image deemed too risque&quot;.

===Firsts===

=== Multiple quadruple Salchows in one program ===
==Execution==
As defined by the ISU, the Salchow jump is an edge jump. Its takeoff is made from the back inside edge of one foot and its landing is made on the back outside edge of the opposite foot. The skater enters into the jump with a backward approach, launches it using their inside edge, and lands on the opposite outside edge. The free leg is extended behind the skater and swings toward the front as they spring into the air while, at the same time, drawing in their arms. Skaters do not have to draw in their arms or free leg close to their bodies while performing the single Salchow because bringing the free side of their bodies forward and around the opposite side of their bodies after they turn towards the back, is enough to produce the necessary rotation. 

The rotation in the air, with respect to a fixed point, is slightly less than 360 degrees because the takeoff edge curves in the same direction as the rotation in the air. When a skater pulls the arms into their body and/or brings their free leg inward, more rotations can be performed; for this reason, the Salchow is &quot;usually the first jump that skaters learn to double, and the first or second to triple&quot;. As U.S. Figure Skating states, however, &quot;timing is critical&quot; because both the takeoff and landing must be on the backward edge.

<doc id="915331" wikidata="Q4769875" url="?curid=915331" title="Anointed (band)">
<text>Anointed is a contemporary Christian music duo from Columbus, Ohio, known for their strong vocals and harmonies, featuring siblings Steve Crawford and Da&#x27;dra Crawford Greathouse, along with former members Nee-C Walls (who left the group in 2001) and Mary Tiller (who left in 1995). Their musical style includes elements of R&amp;B, pop, rock, funk and piano ballads. The group has won seven Dove Awards, two Stellar Awards and three Grammy Award nominations. The group has also been featured on several Christian compilation albums such as &quot;Real Life Music&quot;, 1996 and WOW The 90s.

==History==
Anointed was formed in 1988. They were all still in high school at that time. Their debut, &quot;Spiritual Love Affair&quot;, was released on Brainstorm Records in 1993 and distributed by WAL Records (Words Associated Labels), a subsidiary of Word.

===1995–2000===
In 1995 Anointed released their second album, &quot;The Call&quot;. This album would go on to become their best selling album to date, and to this day it is one of the best selling and popular contemporary Christian albums of the 1990s. The album won three Dove Awards, a Stellar award and a Grammy nomination. The group released &quot;Under the Influence&quot; in October 1996.

After the release of the group&#x27;s self-titled fourth album in 1999, an extended tour followed. This was probably one of the most exciting, yet demanding times for the group. The demand also gave way to a trio becoming a duet.

===2001–present===
In 2001, the sibling duo headed for the studio to produce what would be their first brother and sister project. 

&quot;If We Pray&quot; was released early fall 2001. However, in 2002, because of transitions in the label, Anointed requested to be released from their deal and they and Word records amicably parted ways. Following this, the band was signed on to the Sony Urban label and &quot;Now Is The Time&quot; was released on April 5, 2005.

Both Da&#x27;dra and Steve are currently leading worship and Pastoring at Lakewood Church in Houston, Texas. They have been there since 2006. They have also released solo projects within the last few years which have been digitally distributed.

<text>Warrant is an American glam metal band formed in 1984 in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, that experienced success from 1989 to 1996 with five albums reaching international sales of over 10 million. The band first came into the national spotlight with their double platinum debut album &quot;Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich&quot; (1989) and one of its singles, &quot;Heaven&quot;, which reached No. 1 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The band&#x27;s success continued in the early 1990s with the double platinum album &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; (1990), which provided the hit song of the same name.

Following the critically-acclaimed gold album &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot; (1992), the band started to experience frequent changes to the line-up and despite the drop in popularity with the arrival of grunge, they released &quot;Ultraphobic&quot; in 1995 and a successful greatest hits album in 1996. The band also changed their musical direction with the release of the grunge-influenced &quot;Belly to Belly&quot; in 1996, but returned to their roots very quickly by the end of the decade. The band experienced highs and lows in the 2000s with successful tours, a new covers album &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, lead singer Jani Lane leaving, a new album called &quot;Born Again&quot; with Black &#x27;n Blue singer Jaime St. James and a brief reunion of the original line up. In 2011, Jani Lane died of alcohol poisoning. As of 2024, the band is still recording music and performing, now with former Lynch Mob lead vocalist Robert Mason.

==History==
===Early years (1984–1987)===
Warrant was formed in 1984 by high school drummer Max Asher (born Max Asher/Masursky), who also named the band. In addition to Asher, the original line-up included lead vocalist Adam Shore, guitarists Josh Lewis (born Josh Cohen) and Erik Turner, and bassist Chris Vincent, who was quickly replaced by Jerry Dixon. The band gigged all over California, opening for Hurricane, Ted Nugent, Stryper and Black &#x27;n Blue among others. In September 1986, Shore and Asher quit to create Hot Wheelz. Later that month, Erik Turner was at a gig watching a band called Plain Jane who had become a regular feature in the Los Angeles club circuit, and, impressed by the band&#x27;s songwriting and vocal performance, invited lead singer Jani Lane and drummer Steven Sweet (born Steven Chamberlin/Chamberlain) to jam with Warrant at Hollywood&#x27;s db Sound in September 1986. Lane and Sweet, along with guitarist Joey Allen (born Joey Cagle), who replaced Lewis, completed the revamped lineup in 1987. The recruitment of Lane proved pivotal in the band&#x27;s future, with the singer quickly assuming the role of songwriter.

After achieving fame on the Los Angeles club scene, the band recorded a demo tape in September 1987 for Paisley Park Records, a label owned by musician Prince. With other major labels taking an interest, and after recording tracks for A&amp;M Records, Warrant also contributed to the soundtrack for &quot;Bill and Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;. Eventually, it was announced that Columbia had signed the band. Lane immediately spent his advance on a black Corvette, which he promptly crashed.

Warrant opened their tour in September, billed with D&#x27;MOLLS, followed by dates with Britny Fox. The label immediately arranged for them to work with in demand producer Beau Hill, on what would become the band&#x27;s debut album.

===Peak of popularity (1988–1993)===
Warrant signed a contract with Columbia Records in January 1988, and in April they began recording their debut album &quot;Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich&quot;. Released on January 31, 1989, the record was a significant success, charting at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album spawned four hit singles on the US charts: the No. 2 power ballad &quot;Heaven&quot;, the No. 20 Power Ballad &quot;Sometimes She Cries&quot;, the No. 27 rock anthem &quot;Down Boys&quot;, which is now Warrant&#x27;s alias, and &quot;Big Talk&quot;, which reached No. 30. Warrant became an instant hit, fitting perfectly among the popular big-hair glam metal bands of the era, and their music videos made much of their look. The band toured with Paul Stanley, Poison, Mötley Crüe, Queensrÿche, Cinderella and Kingdom Come, alongside copious MTV coverage.

The band was featured in &quot;Screamer Magazine&quot; several times before finally landing the cover of its June 1989 issue.

Warrant&#x27;s first video album, &quot;Warrant: Live – Dirty Rotten Filthy Stinking Rich&quot; was released in 1990 on VHS and Laserdisc, featuring the band performing live in concert. The video was certified platinum

The band&#x27;s momentum at this point carried them to further success with the much anticipated second album &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; in 1990. Once more produced by Beau Hill, the album&#x27;s title track was released as the first single and immediately propelled itself to a top 10 placing in the American singles chart. The album had tentatively been titled &#x27;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&#x27; after the original opening track. However, the label wanted an &#x27;anthem&#x27; track, resulting in Lane coming up with &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; and the track becoming not only the lead cut but the album&#x27;s title track. The video for the song employed model actress Bobbie Brown, whom Lane would later marry.

The album charted at No. 7 on &quot;The Billboard 200&quot; and featured guest appearances by Poison&#x27;s C.C. DeVille, Danger Danger&#x27;s Bruno Ravel and Steve West, and Fiona. The album, which spawned the hit singles &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; (Featured in &quot;Guitar Hero II&quot;), &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (the acoustic intro was performed by Eric Oswald – Jani&#x27;s brother), &quot;Blind Faith&quot; and &quot;I Saw Red&quot; which also reached the Top Ten in the United States, and the album went on to sell three million copies.

The release of &quot;Cherry Pie&quot; was followed by a world tour with Poison, which ended in January 1991 after a conflict between the two bands over stage room. The band&#x27;s European tour with David Lee Roth was cut short after Lane fractured several ribs in a stage dive in Birmingham, England. Warrant soon returned to touring, headlining shows in America on their &#x27;Blood, Sweat And Beers&#x27; tour, supported by FireHouse and Trixter.

The band released their second video album &quot;Cherry Pie: Quality You Can Taste&quot; in 1991. The video features backstage interviews, concert clips including a preview of the band&#x27;s next album and all the music videos from &quot;Cherry Pie&quot;.

In 1992, Warrant released their third album the critically acclaimed &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. The record achieved only moderate commercial success compared with the first two albums, but still sold over 500,000 copies reaching Gold status and charting at No. 25 on the US charts. While the record suffered poor sales performance in America, it was still considered as Warrant&#x27;s strongest record, and a favorite among many devoted fans. The band snared a European touring slot, playing a number of shows on the &quot;Monsters Of Rock&quot; festival, headlined by Iron Maiden. The album featured the singles &quot;Machine Gun&quot;, &quot;The Bitter Pill&quot; and &quot;The Hole in my Wall&quot;.

Warrant also cut two tracks for the &quot;Gladiator&quot; movie in a cover version of Queen&#x27;s anthem &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; and &quot;The Power&quot;.

===Changing times (1994–1999)===
The 1990s were characterized by frequent changes to the band&#x27;s line-up. Following their Dog Eat Dog world tour Lane temporarily left the band to start a solo career and the band was then dropped by Columbia, following the arrival of grunge and the death of Warrant&#x27;s long-time manager Tom Hulett. In September 1993, Lane returned to the band and a short U.S. club tour commenced. In May 1994, guitarist Allen left Warrant and was followed by drummer Sweet in the following month. In November 1994, former Kingdom Come member, Rick Steier replaced Allen on guitar and fellow Kingdom Come alumnus James Kottak replaced Sweet on drums. Shortly thereafter, a new record deal was signed with Tom Lipsky of CMC Records in September 1994. A Japanese deal was signed with Pony Canyon Records at the same time.

The band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Ultraphobic&quot; was released in March 1995 and, although critically acclaimed, was not as successful as its predecessors. The new album (produced by a returning Beau Hill) saw Warrant acknowledging the grunge phenomenon with a record that openly admitted to a Seattle influence, although was still a natural progression from the hard edged &quot;Dog Eat Dog&quot;. The album featured the singles &quot;Family Picnic&quot;, &quot;Followed&quot; and the ballad &quot;Stronger Now&quot; and the band went on tour again, touring America, Japan and Europe.

Drummer Kottak left the band in March 1996 and was replaced by Bobby Borg, formerly of Beggars &amp; Thieves. &quot;The Best Of Warrant&quot; was the band&#x27;s first compilation album released in 1996 which was good timing and sold well, featuring all of the hits from previous albums.

Adopting the official handle of WARRANT 96 (in order to signify the group&#x27;s new musical direction), the group came up with their fifth studio album, the grunge infested &quot;Belly to Belly&quot; in October 1996. The record dispensed with the melodic rock niceties of previous works. The record was described by guitarist Steier as a &quot;concept album&quot; that follows a rags-to-riches-to-rags storyline concerning fame, fortune and the examination of one&#x27;s value system once the spotlight fades.

Warrant released their first live compilation &quot;Warrant Live 86-97&quot; in July 1997. It was recorded live at Harpos Concert Theatre, Detroit, Michigan on November 22, 1996. Warrant toured in 1997 opening for Alice Cooper in America alongside label mates Dokken and Slaughter. In October 1997, drummer Borg left the band to pursue a career as an author of several books including The Musicians Handbook, and was briefly replaced by touring drummer Vikki Foxx. The band was featured on the Rock Never Stops Tour in 1998. In 1999 Warrant released &quot;Greatest &amp; Latest&quot; album featuring new re-recorded versions of some their classic songs and three new tracks.

===Lane leaves, solo albums, new singer (2000–2007)===
Guitarist Steier and keyboardist Danny Wagner (the latter of whom also performed drums) left the band in January 2000. Keri Kelli replaced Steier on guitars as a touring member and Mike Fasano became the newest in a long line of drummers. Keri Kelli and Mike Fasano had previously played together in Dad&#x27;s Porno Mag. In August 2000, Kelli toured with Slash&#x27;s Snakepit.

Warrant&#x27;s next record was an album of cover versions, &quot;Under the Influence&quot;, released in May 2001, also featuring two new original tracks: &quot;Subhuman&quot; and &quot;Face&quot; Produced by Jerry Dixon. The band toured with Poison again in the summer of 2001, but the tour was cut short due to back injuries sustained by Poison bassist Bobby Dall.

Lane released his official debut solo album, &quot;Back Down to One&quot;, in 2002 through &quot;Z Records&quot;. It carried a &quot;power pop&quot; sound which was more closely aligned with the sound of Warrant than his unreleased &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; project. Shortly after the album&#x27;s release Lane was admitted to a rehab center for alcohol and drug-related exhaustion.

The band again featured on the Rock Never Stops Tour in 2003 and in April 2003, Warrant replaced drummer Fasano with Kevan Phares.

Following rehab, Lane officially quit Warrant again in January 2004. After a few appearances on tribute compilations, Lane attempted to restart his own version of Warrant which would be stopped by legal action from his former bandmates.

Mike Fasano was briefly rehired in early 2004, before Steven Sweet rejoined the band. Joey Allen also rejoined in February 2004 and Lane was replaced with former Black N&#x27; Blue vocalist Jaime St. James.

Warrant released their seventh studio album entitled &quot;Born Again&quot; on February 4, 2006, with producer and engineer Pat Regan, who has previously worked with Ace Frehley, Deep Purple, Mr. Big and L.A. Guns. Music Videos were shot for all the songs on &quot;Born Again&quot; including the singles &quot;Bourbon County Line&quot; and &quot;Dirty Jack&quot;, they appear on the DVD &quot;Born Again: Delvis Video Diaries&quot; along with behind the scenes footage, on tour clips and the making of the album. This was the first album to not feature Lane on lead vocals. On July 14, 2007, Warrant performed at the hard rock festival Rocklahoma.

===Original lineup reunion (2008)===
In January 2008, the band&#x27;s agent, the William Morris Agency, issued a new photograph of the band with Lane prominently featured, confirming his return to the band for the 20 year anniversary. This version of the band was scheduled to play at Rocklahoma 2008. In March 2008, Warrant announced on its official website that it would co-headline with Cinderella on a summer reunion tour after Rocklahoma 2008. Ultimately, the tour was canceled after Cinderella singer Tom Keifer&#x27;s left vocal cord hemorrhaged, making it impossible for him to sing in the immediate future. They had several shows outside of the Cinderella tour including 2 dates in Canada, Rocklahoma, and several in August.

On September 5, 2008, Jani Lane left Warrant and Robert Mason (ex-Lynch Mob) took over vocals. A statement from the band, published by Blabbermouth.net, said that:
On September 10, Rita Wilde&#x27;s &quot;Rock Report&quot; confirmed that Jani Lane was out of Warrant due to song writing disagreements, but offered no further details on replacements or the band&#x27;s future. Mason eventually agreed not only to finish the tour but also to become a permanent member of the band.

A compilation reunion DVD was released in late 2008 titled &quot;They Came From Hollywood&quot;.

===Post Jani Lane (2009–2011)===
In December 2010 Turner and Dixon appeared with longtime friend David Castagno on RadioScreamer to discuss Warrant&#x27;s long and successful career as well as the band&#x27;s next album plans.

On January 27, 2011, Allen announced that the bass and drums for fourteen songs for Warrant&#x27;s next album had been completed, with the rhythm guitar parts for seven also completed.

The release of the new album, titled &quot;Rockaholic&quot;, on May 13, 2011, in Europe and May 17, 2011, in North America was confirmed by Frontiers Records. It subsequently peaked at number 22 on the Billboard Top Hard Rock Albums chart. The album features two new music videos for the singles: &quot;Life&#x27;s a Song&quot; and &quot;Home&quot;.

The Rockaholic Tour of Canada and the US with label mates Whitesnake as well as Cinderella and fellow Sunset Strip Kings Poison, had Warrant playing over 50 dates in support of the album.

===Death of Jani Lane (2011)===
On Thursday evening, August 11, 2011, the Los Angeles Police Department announced that Jani Lane, 47, former lead singer (1986–2004, 2008), had been found dead. It was confirmed that Lane was officially pronounced dead by fire department personnel who responded to a call shortly before 5:30 p.m. at a Comfort Inn hotel on the 20100 block of Ventura Boulevard in Woodland Hills, California. Lane died of acute alcohol poisoning.

A public memorial concert for Lane – with performances by fellow metal rock bands, including Great White, Slammin&#x27; Gladys, Quiet Riot and L.A. Guns — was held on Monday, August 29, 2011, at the Key Club in Hollywood, California.

===Recent events (2012–present)===

In 2016, Warrant guitarist Allen announced that the band intends to enter a recording studio in the fall (possibly in Nashville or Los Angeles) to begin its follow up to 2011&#x27;s Rockaholic. The band already had nine new songs fully demoed and another 20 ideas &quot;floating around&quot;.

On May 12, 2017, Warrant released their ninth studio album, &quot;Louder Harder Faster&quot;. The album features a remake of the classic Merle Haggard song &quot;I Think I&#x27;ll Just Stay Here and Drink&quot; as the first single and the &#x27;Professional Bull Riders&#x27; new &quot;party anthem&quot;. The official video premiered at an official kickoff party at St Louis in Ballpark Village on February 25, accompanied by a live performance. The clip was filmed in Anaheim. The band also released the single and music video for the album&#x27;s title track &quot;Louder Harder Faster&quot; on May 4, 2017. The album charted at #19 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart.
Currently, Robbie Crane is playing bass for Warrant on the first few shows coming back from Covid 19 freeze on live shows.

<doc id="915346" wikidata="Q7786063" url="?curid=915346" title="This Is the Sea">
<text>This Is the Sea is the third studio album by the Waterboys, released on 16 September 1985 by Ensign Records. The last of their &quot;Big Music&quot; albums, it is considered by critics to be the finest album of the Waterboys&#x27; early rock-oriented sound, described as &quot;epic&quot; and &quot;a defining moment&quot;. It peaked at number 37 in the UK Albums Chart. Steve Wickham makes his Waterboys recording debut playing violin on &quot;The Pan Within&quot; and subsequently joined the band. &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; is the last Waterboys album with contributions from Karl Wallinger, who left the group to form his own band, World Party.

The album was recorded between March and July 1985, and released that October. Mike Scott, the album&#x27;s principal songwriter and leader of the Waterboys, describes &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; as &quot;the record on which I achieved all my youthful musical ambitions&quot;, &quot;the final, fully realised expression of the early Waterboys sound&quot;, influenced by The Velvet Underground, Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Astral Weeks&quot;, and Steve Reich.

&quot;This Is the Sea&quot; contains the best-selling Waterboys single, &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;. The album cover is a photograph taken by Lynn Goldsmith.

A remastered and expanded version was released in 2004. A complete box set of studio recording sessions, demos and live recordings was released as &quot;1985&quot; in 2024, documenting the making of &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;.

==Production history==
Scott began writing songs for &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; in the spring of 1984, beginning with the song &quot;Trumpets&quot;. Scott recalls that in December 1984 &quot;during the Waterboys&#x27; first American tour, [he] bought two huge hard-bound books... in which to assemble [his] new songs&quot; For the following two months Scott worked on the songs in his apartment, writing the lyrics, and working on guitar and piano arrangements. Scott wrote between 35 and 40 songs, but felt that the nine songs that made it onto the album &quot;were the ones that were intended to be there&quot;. The first song from the album to be played live was &quot;Trumpets&quot;, on 10 April 1984.

The first recording session for &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; began in March 1985 at Park Gates Studio in Hastings, England with engineer and producer John Brand. Band members Scott, Anthony Thistlethwaite, Karl Wallinger, Chris Whitten, and Roddy Lorimer performed the new material. Wallinger&#x27;s home studio heard demo recordings for a number of the album&#x27;s songs. Some of the recordings, like the ones of the last two albums, are relatively untouched by studio engineering. On other recordings, however, Scott added a drum machine and layered the sound, using a studio technique similar to that of the famous record producer Phil Spector, with help from Wallinger. &quot;Having Karl [Wallinger] in the studio&quot;, writes Scott, &quot;was like having a one-man orchestra around. There might have been a &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; without him, but it wouldn&#x27;t have been the same – or as good&quot;. Nonetheless, it was Wallinger&#x27;s second and last appearance on a Waterboys album.

The recording sessions continued through June. By July, Wickham, after an invitation from Scott, entered the studio with the band to add his fiddle to &quot;The Pan Within&quot;. Produced from the original sessions at Park Gates Studio, along with recordings from Livingston Studios in London, Amazon in Liverpool, Seaview, and The Townhouse Studio, among others, the album was released in October. Peter Anderson, writing in &quot;Record Collector&quot;, describes Scott as &quot;completely at home in the studio&quot; and writes that Scott &quot;spared nothing on&quot; &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;.

A remastered version was released in 2004, with a second CD of material from the album&#x27;s singles, and unreleased tracks from the &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; recording sessions.

==Album promotion==
&quot;This Is the Sea&quot; was promoted heavily and reached number 37 in the UK Albums Chart. Neither of the two preceding albums had charted in the Top 40.

The album was followed by tours in the United Kingdom, and in North America as the headliners. Sinéad O&#x27;Connor made her UK live debut as a backing singer on &quot;The Big Music&quot; at a concert at the London Town and Country Club. In December, the Waterboys joined the band Simple Minds for a European tour. During the three major tours, the band&#x27;s lineup began to change, and the album received more exposure than its two predecessors. Mike Scott, however, in a decision that expressed the values he had written about when authoring punk rock fanzines, refused to promote the album and the single &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; because he would not lip sync, a requirement on the show at that time.

===Music video===
Meiert Avis directed the video for &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, using visionary lighting elements based on Mark Helprin&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; and his memories of a 1962 theatrical production of Charles Kingsley&#x27;s &quot;The Water Babies&quot;. Avis addressed Scott&#x27;s aversion to lip syncing, by shooting the visuals for &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; while capturing a unique live audio performance of the single. Avis later used this technique on several videos with Bruce Springsteen, who shares Scott&#x27;s aversion.

==Song details==
Themes of the album include spirituality (&quot;Spirit&quot;, &quot;The Pan Within&quot;), romantic love (&quot;Trumpets&quot;), and English politics (&quot;Old England&quot;), while the album&#x27;s eponymous single (&quot;This Is The Sea&quot;) utilizes the allusion of the flowing river as a life affirming recognition of constant renewal and regeneration. Michael Tucker, in an article entitled &quot;The Body Electric: The Shamanic Spirit in Twentieth Century Music&quot;, lists &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; as an example of shamanistic themes in twentieth-century Western music. Irish musician Bono includes the album on his &quot;top ten&quot; list, noting &quot;In rock, the word &#x27;poet&#x27; gets thrown around a lot. Not here...&quot;

&quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot;, the lyrics of which encourage environmentalism, was released as a single in Germany, with a song titled &quot;Ways of Men&quot; as the B-side. The first draft of the song&#x27;s music was written by Wallinger. Scott reworked the arrangement, changing its rhythm and &quot;feel&quot;, but Wallinger&#x27;s melody and chords were preserved.
&quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, one of the Waterboys&#x27; best-known songs and their most commercially successful, was first released as a twelve-inch single, and reached number twenty-eight on the UK Singles Chart. The single also contained a live recording of &quot;The Girl in the Swing&quot;, from &quot;The Waterboys&quot;, the band&#x27;s debut album, an extended mix of &quot;Spirit&quot;, and a song titled &quot;Medicine Jack&quot;. The latter two appear on the second disc of the album&#x27;s re-release. When the single was reissued in 1990, it reached number 3, and was awarded the Ivor Novello Award in 1991. Including the 2004 remastered album, the song has been officially released four times.

The song began as a &quot;scribble on the back of an envelope on a wintry New York street&quot;, after Scott&#x27;s girlfriend asked him if it was difficult to write a song, and was unfinished at the beginning of the recording sessions, eventually being completed in May 1985. The song, like the Waterboys&#x27; first single &quot;A Girl Called Johnny&quot; is a tribute to an inspirational figure. In each line, the singer describes his own perspective and immediately contrasts it with that of the song&#x27;s subject, summarizing the difference with the line &quot;I saw the crescent / You saw the whole of the moon&quot;. &quot;You saw Brigadoon&quot;, one of these contrasts, refers to a fictional village that exists only one day every century (from the musical of the same name).

The subject of the song has inspired some speculation. Musician Nikki Sudden, with whom Scott had collaborated before forming the Waterboys, said that Scott told Max Edie, the backing singer for &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot;, that the song was written about Sudden. AllMusic instead suggests that its subject is actually a number of people who inspired Scott, including Christian writer C. S. Lewis and the musician Prince. Scott himself says that he &quot;couldn&#x27;t have written&quot; the song without having read Mark Helprin&#x27;s novel &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, but goes on to state that the song is not about Helprin (a different song inspired by and named after the &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; character Beverly Penn was recorded during the album sessions, and appeared on the 2004 reissue). The official Waterboys website&#x27;s Frequently Asked Questions clarifies that Scott has said that the song&#x27;s subject is &quot;a composite of many people&quot;, including C. S. Lewis, but explicitly states that it is not about Prince.

A feature of &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; is the trumpet work on the recording, courtesy of the classically trained Lorimer, who spent three days with Scott working on the song&#x27;s arrangement. According to Lorimer, he &quot;went home with a tape of the song and thought about a more classical approach. After a while sitting at the piano I came up with the idea of antiphonal trumpets. A piccolo trumpet on the left answered a piccolo on the right and then the same again, growing by adding a Bb trumpet below each side of the stereo picture. Mike [Scott] loved it, except the slightly jazzy chords I had used on the run down at the very end, which he simplified. I used the same classical approach later in the song, mixing two classical-type trumpets behind a later verse.&quot; Lorimer also contributes falsetto background vocals to the song, while Thistlethwaite, another brass section member, performs a saxophone solo near the end. 

&quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; was covered by Jennifer Warnes on her 1992 album &quot;The Hunter&quot;, by Mandy Moore on her 2003 album &quot;Coverage&quot;, by the band Human Drama on the compilation album &quot;New Wave Goes to Hell&quot; and by folk singer-songwriter Peter Mulvey on his 1995 release &quot;Rapture&quot;. It has also appeared on numerous other compilations.

&quot;Spirit&quot;, a song praising the resilience of the human spirit, originally appeared on a short, one-and-a-half minute version. A full four-minute version of the song was released on the 2004 remastered disc.

The lyrics of &quot;The Pan Within&quot; are partly derived from meditation techniques (&quot;Close your eyes / Breathe slow / And we&#x27;ll begin&quot;). It was the first of two Waterboys songs about the Ancient Greek god Pan, which have been played as a at Waterboys concerts. Scott describes the song&#x27;s guitar solo as &quot;[consisting] of a series of phrases or lines/melodies that generally build in an order (which may change), though which includes a lot of improvisation which is different each night. The lines have never been &#x27;tabbed&#x27; or written down... The song is in the key of A-minor (the chords under the solo are F – Em – Am – Am repeated)&quot;. The second Pan song, &quot;The Return of Pan&quot;, appears on the album &quot;Dream Harder&quot;. &quot;The Pan Within&quot; is the first Waterboys song to feature Wickham&#x27;s fiddle playing. It was selected as one of DWXB-FM&#x27;s Hits of 1986. In Southeast Asia, particularly in the Philippines, when the New Wave era started in 1985, the group&#x27;s biggest hit single is &quot;The Pan Within&quot;, aside from &quot;The Whole of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot;.

An alternative version of &quot;Medicine Bow&quot; was released as a single in Germany, with an instrumental version of &quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot; for the 7-inch. The 12-inch contained another mix of &quot;Medicine Bow&quot; and &quot;Ways of Men&quot;. Scott writes that he invented the name, and was unaware of Medicine Bow, Wyoming. The album&#x27;s re-release contains a &quot;full length&quot; version of the song that contains an instrumental &quot;piano storm – from first sonic droplets of rain to final crashing thunder and lightning&quot; performed by Adrian Johnston.

&quot;Old England&quot; is a criticism of Thatcherism, blaming Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s economic policies for what Scott perceived to be an increase in desperation amongst the young and poor in the England of that time, and a rise in drug addiction, specifically to heroin. The refrain, &quot;Old England is dying&quot; is a quote from James Joyce, and the lines &quot;You&#x27;re asking what makes me sigh now / What it is makes me shudder so&quot; are from W. B. Yeats&#x27; poem, &quot;Mad as the Mist and Snow&quot;. The Clash, one of the bands that had inspired Scott during his punk music phase, released &quot;This Is England&quot;, a song with a similar theme, as a single the same year. Scott and the Waterboys would move to Ireland the following year.

&quot;Be My Enemy&quot; is an uptempo track, heavily influenced by Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Tombstone Blues&quot; and &quot;Bob Dylan&#x27;s 115th Dream&quot;. 

&quot;Trumpets&quot;, a love song, was the first song written for the album, in the spring of 1984, and the first song from the album to be performed live. It quotes from &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, a recording by The Beatles. Regarding the lack of trumpets in the song, trumpeter Lorimer stated, &#x27;My impressions are that Mike found them noble, bright, pure, these sort of words. So, &#x27;My love feels like trumpets&#x27;... I understand it at that level. It&#x27;s such an ancient instrument, a martial instrument. Amongst swords and spears and shields being clattered about, someone sounds the trumpet and everyone hears that. It&#x27;s the clarion call, the clarity of it finds its way through.&quot;

The title track, the last song on the original release, has a slower tempo than most of the other arrangements. Scott notes that he wrote over twenty verses for the song, some of which wound up included on the &quot;alter ego&quot; of &quot;This Is the Sea&quot;, &quot;That Was the River&quot;, which was released in 1994 on &quot;The Secret Life of the Waterboys&quot;. Waterboys chronicler Ian Abrahams wrote that the album and song were about Scott painting, &quot;...a mystical, spiritual route that can be attained simply through letting-go of the mundane and trusting to the sanctity of the inner self.&quot; Abrahams further described the song as, &quot;...an instruction to throw away the old and embrace the new, catch the train, see the previous existence as something old and gone. It&#x27;s as though there is a split personality, the war raging inside the head, the mental anguish and the internal argument. This song gets right back into the thrust of &quot;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&quot; and comes full circle, rejecting the soulless existence painted in the LP&#x27;s opening moments and treating it as a journey, comparable with the traveling of the river into the sea. It&#x27;s really the sentiment of somebody making a huge adjustment in their life and that really elucidates the theme of the album and points to a crossroads in Mike Scott&#x27;s creative thinking.&quot; 

&quot;This Is the Sea&quot; was first performed in Worcester on 2 December 1984, and a longer version than would eventually appear on the album, was played at a benefit concert for miners in February 1985. Despite these performances the song is seldom performed live as Scott finds it difficult to replace the studio&#x27;s version&#x27;s ocean effects in such a setting, also stating that he find the melody &quot;very limiting &quot; going on to say &quot;My abilities with melodies have improved a lot, have developed a lot since those days, and that song doesn&#x27;t really make it for me.&quot; The subject of the lyrics is conflicted about their present (&quot;You&#x27;ve got a war in your head / And it&#x27;s tearing you up inside&quot;), and nostalgic for a past clarity (&quot;And you know you once held the key&quot;). The speaker instead argues that the past is irrelevant (&quot;But that was the river / This is the sea)&quot;.

Those additional tracks on the re-release that are not alternative versions of songs originally appearing on the album were recorded in the same recording sessions.

&quot;This Is the Sea&quot; was played in the end credits to the documentary &quot;Riding Giants&quot;.

The chorus line &quot;That was the river, this is the sea&quot; (credited to Mike Scott) features as the epigraph to the final chapter of Andrew Chadwick&#x27;s book &quot;The Hybrid Media System: Politics and Power.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Upon its release, Malcolm Dome of &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; as &quot;a veritable shoal of musical ideas, held firm by a ballast of keyboard horizons and string tugs&quot; and continued, &quot;Best in this direction are &#x27;Don&#x27;t Bang the Drum&#x27;, &#x27;The Whole of the Moon&#x27;, &#x27;The Pan Within&#x27; and &#x27;This Is the Sea&#x27;, all of which hum and thrive with life in the fullest sense of the term. This isn&#x27;t merely aural wallpaper but a strident, confident attempt at eliciting response; the art of texture and dynamics has rarely been better illustrated.&quot; Deanne Pearson of &quot;Number One&quot; concluded, &quot;From Scott&#x27;s vocals to the musical arrangements ripped through with piercing sax, it&#x27;s rock music infused with heart and soul.&quot;

&quot;Music Week&quot; considered it to go &quot;straight for the epic stuff in an uncommonly well realised manner&quot; and added, &quot;Scott is now a consummate songwriter and while his slightly clipped, almost folky vocal requires some listener tolerance the sheer power of this LP sweeps you away.&quot; Andy Strickland of &quot;Record Mirror&quot; called it &quot;a fine LP&quot; and noted Scott&#x27;s &quot;continued ability to [produce] excellent rock songs&quot;. He felt the album &quot;takes up where &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; left off&quot;, but &quot;disappointingly lacks the triumphant feel and classic consistency of its elder brother&quot;, noting that the &quot;subborn production [is] so similar that it veers dangerously towards being &#x27;just another Waterboys album&#x27; rather than a step forward&quot;. He also believed it would have been improved with &quot;a more diverse guitar sound, a bit more light and shade which is currently left to the excellent Scott voice&quot;.

In the US, &quot;Cash Box&quot; summarised, &quot;With breathtaking, panoramic sweeps, Scott evidences his brilliance with every song. Scott&#x27;s talent is rare.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Parke Puterbaugh wrote, &quot;Mike Scott is more of a poet than a songwriter, yet within his limitations he weaves trances so spellbinding that he has few peers among his musical contemporaries.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; described it as &quot;punchy rock with an occasionally John Waite-ish lead vocal&quot; and also praised the &quot;imaginative orchestrations&quot; and &quot;solid songwriting&quot;.

In a retrospective review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic noted that &quot;This Is the Sea&quot; &quot;expand[ed] the epic, multi-layered sound&quot; of &quot;A Pagan Place&quot; and proved to be &quot;a more ambitious yet more successful record, since it finds Mike Scott at his melodic peak&quot;. He added it has &quot;enough strong, accessible moments to make Scott&#x27;s indulgences forgivable&quot;. &quot;The Rough Guide to Rock&quot; called it an &quot;unpolished nugget&quot; which showcased Scott&#x27;s vocals &quot;beginning to mature into something very tasty indeed.&quot;

<text>The concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister), first chair (U.S.) or leader (U.K.) is the principal first violin player in an orchestra (clarinet or oboe in a concert band). After the conductor, the concertmaster is the most significant leader in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble.

== Orchestra ==

In an orchestra, the concertmaster is customarily the leader of the first violin section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a violin concerto, in which case a guest soloist usually plays). It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by their playing and bow gestures.

The concertmaster sits to the conductor&#x27;s left, closest to the audience, in what is called the &quot;first chair,&quot; &quot;first [music] stand&quot; or outside of the US &quot;first desk.&quot; The concertmaster makes decisions regarding bowing and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. The concertmaster leads the orchestra in tuning before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management. Leading the orchestral tuning is not a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, they will signal to the oboe player to play another &quot;A.&quot; Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster&#x27;s absence.

The concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the auditions of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.

== Other large ensembles ==

In a standard concert band, the concertmaster is the principal clarinet or oboe and leads the ensemble&#x27;s tuning. The first-chair concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead flautist will receive similar responsibilities to the concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the ensemble. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.

In brass bands, the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo cornet or trumpet.

== Duties ==
The duties and tasks of the concertmaster are many. Primarily, the concertmaster acts as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and is accountable to both parties.

One of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the first violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of first violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece.

Another primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is, often (unless they are a string player), a generalist.

Full-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor&#x27;s gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor&#x27;s gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra. 

In performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated, and bow and receive applause before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, the concertmaster will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.

<doc id="915360" wikidata="Q7340076" url="?curid=915360" title="Rob Dean">
<text>Rob Dean (born 23 April 1955) is a British musician turned professional illustrator, who rose to prominence playing lead guitar as a member of the British new wave band Japan from 1975 to 1981.

==Biography==
He is from the Clapton district of Hackney, northeast London, England.

===Japan===
Dean joined Japan in 1975 at the age of 20. The band began as an alternative glam rock-style band and became a popular new wave sensation in the early 1980s. Dean left the band in May 1981 following their &#x27;Art of Parties&#x27; tour, as his guitar work had become increasingly marginalised as they developed a more electronic sound.

He had previously played on their albums &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot; (1978), &quot;Obscure Alternatives&quot; (1978) and &quot;Quiet Life&quot; (1979). His last studio contributions were on the &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; album, released in November 1980. Dean left the band just prior to them achieving mainstream success, which lasted until they finally disbanded in December 1982.

===Collaborations===
After leaving Japan, he worked on initial ideas for a solo album with keyboardist and composer Roger Mason known for his work with Gary Numan, among others. He also contributed to Gary Numan&#x27;s &quot;Dance&quot; album in 1981. He played on Sinéad O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s first album &quot;The Lion and the Cobra&quot; in 1987 (on which he co-wrote one of the songs). Dean continued to work on projects with Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri and Mick Karn such as a 1995 compilation album and a number of other works on their Medium Productions label.

==Other projects==
===Vivabeat===
Vivabeat (supported by Peter Gabriel) combined the influences of 70s British art-rock with the kind of lush technopop performed by David Bowie, Roxy Music and Sparks. The band was the first American band signed to Charisma Records. The band had a worldwide hit with the track &quot;Man From China&quot; from their debut album &quot;Party in the War Zone&quot;. Dean played on the follow-up single, &quot;The House is Burning (But There&#x27;s No One Home)&quot;, which was featured on the band&#x27;s self-titled EP. The &quot;House is Burning&quot; song and video (also featuring Dean) appeared in Brian DePalma&#x27;s movie &quot;Body Double&quot;. In 2001 a &#x27;best of&#x27; Vivabeat album titled &quot;The Good Life&quot; was released, with Dean&#x27;s work on several tracks.

===Illustrated Man===
Dean formed Illustrated Man (1984) with Hugo Burnham (ex-Gang of Four), Roger Mason (Numan and others) and Australian singer/bassist Philip Foxman but their commercial success was limited.

===The Slow Club&#x27;s &quot;World of Wonders&quot;===

Rob Dean contributed to this Australian band (1990)

===Jansen, Barbieri, Karn===

&quot;Beginning to Melt&quot;
This 1993 album features Rob Dean and ex-members of Japan.

Little has been heard of Rob Dean as a musician since. The occasional demo tapes from the eighties have surfaced for a range of projects (known as &#x27;The Lost Tapes&#x27;) where Dean experimented with electronica (with Roger Mason), his trademark guitar sounds and even acoustic tracks with vocals.

==Present day==
Dean&#x27;s principal activity now is as a professional ornithology writer and artist on the birds of Central America. He lives in Monteverde, Costa Rica, and, now known as Robert Dean, has established a reputation as an expert on the region&#x27;s birdlife. In 2007 Dean collaborated as illustrator on a field guide (along with author Richard Garrigues), entitled &quot;The Birds of Costa Rica: A Field Guide,&quot; and in 2010 (with author George Angehr) on &quot;The Birds of Panama: A Field Guide&quot;. He has been reported as occasionally playing guitar with local bands including Monteverde&#x27;s rock band Chanchos de Monte, fronted by Alan Masters.

More recently Robert has formed a group named &#x27;Light of Day&#x27; with Isaac Moraga and their debut album &quot;Dimensions&quot; was completed in 2019 with UK/Europe/Latin America release expected in 2020. In addition, a Spanish language e.p. featuring alternate versions of several album tracks is also being prepared for release in Costa Rica in 2020.

<doc id="915361" wikidata="Q1550742" url="?curid=915361" title="Genu varum">
<text>Genu varum (also called bow-leggedness, bandiness, bandy-leg, and tibia vara) is a varus deformity marked by (outward) bowing at the knee, which means that the lower leg is angled inward (medially) in relation to the thigh&#x27;s axis, giving the limb overall the appearance of an archer&#x27;s bow. Usually medial angulation of both lower limb bones (fibula and tibia) is involved.

==Causes==
If a child is sickly, either with rickets or any other ailment that prevents ossification of the bones or is improperly fed, the bowed condition may persist. Thus the chief cause of this deformity is rickets. Skeletal problems, infection, and tumors can also affect the growth of the leg, sometimes giving rise to a one-sided bow-leggedness. The remaining causes are occupational, especially among jockeys, and from physical trauma, the condition being very likely to supervene after accidents involving the condyles of the femur.

===Childhood===
Children until the age of 3 to 4 have a degree of genu varum. The child sits with the soles of the feet facing one another; the tibia and femur are curved outwards; and, if the limbs are extended, although the ankles are in contact, there is a distinct space between the knee-joints. During the first year of life, a gradual change takes place. The knee-joints approach one another; the femur slopes downward and inward towards the knee joints; the tibia become straight, and the sole of the foot faces almost directly downwards.

While these changes are occurring, the bones, which at first consist principally of cartilage, are gradually becoming ossified. By the time a normal child begins to walk, the lower limbs are prepared, both by their general direction and by the rigidity of the bones which form them, to support the weight of the body.

===Rickets===
Nutritional rickets is an important cause of childhood genu varum or bow legs in some parts of the world. Nutritional rickets is due to unhealthy life style habits as insufficient exposure to sun light which is the main source of vitamin D. Insufficient dietary intake of calcium is another contributing factor. Rickets may also have genetic causes, occasionally called resistant rickets. Rickets usually causes bone deformities in all four extremities. Genu varum may resolve spontaneously with modification of life style activities or after receiving medical treatment. Some deformities do not correct spontaneously and need surgical intervention especially if they are severe and causing gait difficulties. The main surgical modality used to treat genu varum arising from rickets is guided growth surgery, also known as growth modulation surgery.

===Blount&#x27;s disease===
Blount&#x27;s disease is a deformity in the legs, mostly from the knees to the ankles. The affected bone curves in or out and forms the usual &quot;archers bow&quot; which can also be called bow-legs. There are two types of Blount&#x27;s disease. The first type is Infantile: this means that children under four are diagnosed with this disease. Blount&#x27;s disease in this age is very risky because sometimes it is not detected and it passes to the second type of Blount&#x27;s disease. The second type of Blount&#x27;s disease is found mostly in older children and in teenagers, sometimes in one leg and sometimes in both; the patient&#x27;s age determines how severe the diagnosis is.

===Osteochondrodysplasia===
Osteochondrodysplasia are a diverse group of genetic bone diseases or genetic skeletal dysplasias that manifest in generalized bone deformities involving the extremities and the spine. Bow legs or genu varum is one of these deformities. The characteristic bone X-ray survey findings are important to confirm the diagnosis.

==Diagnosis==

On projectional radiography, the degree of varus or valgus deformity can be quantified by the &quot;hip-knee-ankle angle&quot;, which is an angle between the femoral mechanical axis and the center of the ankle joint. It is normally between 1.0° and 1.5° of varus in adults. Normal ranges are different in children.
==Treatment==

Generally, no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children. Treatment is indicated when it persists beyond years old. In the case of unilateral presentation or progressive worsening of the curvature, when caused by rickets, the most important thing is to treat the constitutional disease, at the same time instructing the care-giver never to place the child on their feet. In many cases, this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure, but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying splints. When the deformity arises in older patients, either from trauma or occupation, the only permanent treatment is surgery, but orthopaedic bracing can provide relief.

===Rickets===
Rickets usually causes bone deformities in all four extremities. Genu varum may resolve spontaneously with modification of lifestyle activities or after receiving medical treatment. Some deformities do not correct spontaneously and need surgical intervention especially if they are severe and causing gait difficulties. The main surgical modality used to treat genu varum arising from rickets is guided growth surgery, also known as growth modulation surgery.

===Blount&#x27;s disease===
Treatment for children with Blount&#x27;s disease is typically braces but surgery may also be necessary. In children guided growth surgery is used to gradually correct/straighten the bow legs. For teenagers osteotomy or bone cutting is often used to correct the bone deformity. The operation consists of removing a piece of tibia, breaking the fibula and straightening out the bone; there is also a choice of elongating the legs. If not treated early enough, the condition worsens quickly.

===Osteochondrodysplasia=== 
Guided growth surgery in children is widely used to achieve gradual correction of knee deformities arising from Osteochondrodysplasia including genu varum. Yet, this treatment is associated with a high incidence of recurrence and repeated surgeries may be needed to maintain proper bone alignment.

==Prognosis==

In most cases persisting after childhood, there is little or no effect on the ability to walk. Due to uneven stress and wear on the knees, however, even milder manifestations can see an accelerated onset of arthritis.

<text>Goodspeed Musicals is a non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation and advancement of musical theater and the creation of new works, located in East Haddam, Connecticut. Its landmark Goodspeed Opera House is a distinctive feature of the view from the Connecticut River and is the birthplace of some of the world&#x27;s most famous musicals, including &quot;Annie&quot;, &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot;, and &quot;Shenandoah&quot;. Goodspeed Musicals also includes the Norma Terris Theatre in Chester as well as several writing and performing seminars. Goodspeed Musicals is considered one of the foremost regional theaters in the United States to date producing 250 musicals, over 70 world premieres, and sending 21 productions to Broadway. Goodspeed Musicals is the first regional theatre in America to earn two special Tony Awards, one in 1980 for outstanding contributions to the American musical and a second in 1995 for distinguished achievement for a regional theatre.

== Goodspeed Opera House ==
The Opera House was originally built by a local merchant and banker, William Henry Goodspeed. Construction began in 1876 and finished in 1877. Despite the name, it was not in fact an opera house, but rather a venue for presenting plays. Its first play, &quot;Charles II&quot;, opened on October 24, 1877. After William Goodspeed&#x27;s death in 1882, the opera house fell into disrepair, facing a series of less glamorous uses—from a militia base during World War I to a general store and a Department of Transportation storage facility.

The building is unique for a theater. The theater itself is actually located on the top two floors of the building, making for interesting and sometimes difficult scenery and show load-ins. Scenery is loaded-in from the dock area up a vacant elevator shaft that is now outfitted with a winch system to haul the scenery up to the stage level. Much care has to be taken in order to get the scenery up the shaft without scratching or ruining the scenery. One story told around Goodspeed is that while loading in the scenery for Annie&#x27;s original pre-Broadway run, a strong gust of wind took a large piece of scenery out of the hands of the loaders and blew it into the Connecticut River.

== Goodspeed Musicals ==
Goodspeed Musicals was formed in 1959 by a group of concerned citizens after the state of Connecticut had condemned the building. The state agreed to sell the building to the group for one dollar, provided they acquire enough funding to restore and maintain it. The restoration project took nearly four years, and the Goodspeed Opera House was rededicated on June 8, 1963. The first performance in the new opera house was &quot;Oh, Lady! Lady!&quot; Under the direction of Michael P. Price from 1968 to 2014, and Michael Gennaro since 2014, Goodspeed Musicals has sent 19 productions to Broadway. Goodspeed productions have won more than a dozen Tony Awards, while Goodspeed Musicals itself has won two special Tonys, one for outstanding contributions to American Musicals and the other for outstanding achievement by a regional theatre.

Goodspeed Musicals also pursues its mission through the Max Showalter Center for Education in Musical Theatre, which offers internships and new writers&#x27; residency programs. Their Arts Education Collaboration provides art-education programs for underserved Connecticut youth. Goodspeed&#x27;s annual Festival of New Musicals features students from the Hartt School and the Boston Conservatory performing staged readings of new musicals, seminars, a symposium and cabaret performances. Each winter, Goodspeed also hosts the Johnny Mercer Foundation Writers Grove, a retreat for theater writers. Critic fellows from the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Waterford, CT travel to the Goodspeed each summer to practice reviewing full productions.

Goodspeed Musicals is also home to the Scherer Library of Musical Theatre, which houses the largest musical theatre research facility in the United States. They have also built state-of-the-art production facilities including scenery shops, costume shops and a large costume storage facility. Goodspeed Costume Rentals houses the premier costume collection on the East Coast. More than 250,000 items are available to rent for professional and amateur productions, featuring costumes from Tony-winning Broadway designers such as William Ivey Long, Gregg Barnes, Catherine Zuber, Willa Kim, Florence Klotz, Linda Cho, Anthony Powell, and more. 

Tours of many of the Goodspeed facilities can be scheduled in advance for a small fee. Tickets to the opera house or theatre productions should be ordered in advance as most performances in the relatively small theater sell-out quickly.

== Norma Terris Theatre ==

In 1984, Goodspeed Musicals added a second performance venue—the Norma Terris Theatre—in nearby Chester, Connecticut, occasionally referred to as the Goodspeed-At-Chester. While the main stage presents a mixture of revivals and new musicals as part of its 3 production season, The Norma Terris presents exclusively new musicals each season. Several original musicals debuted there or at the opera house before going on to Broadway and winning Tony Awards.

<doc id="915376" wikidata="Q793479" url="?curid=915376" title="Azahari Husin">
<text>Azahari bin Husin (14 September 1957 – 9 November 2005), also known as Azahari Husin or Azhari Husin, was a Malaysian engineer and former university lecturer who was believed to be the technical mastermind behind the series of terrorist attacks in Indonesia in the early 2000s (including the 2002 Bali bombings). Nicknamed the &quot;Demolition Man&quot; by Malaysian newspapers, he was one of the most wanted men in Indonesia along with Noordin Mohammad Top.

==History==
Azahari studied in Australia for four years since 1975. Later on, he was an engineer with a PhD from the University of Reading, United Kingdom and was a lecturer at the University of Technology Malaysia in Johor, Malaysia. 

In the late 1990s, he received extensive bomb training in Afghanistan and the southern Philippines. He authored the Jemaah Islamiyah bomb manual, used in the Philippine consulate bombing in Jakarta, Jakarta Stock Exchange bombing, the Christmas Eve bombings, the 2002 Bali bombings, and the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing. He also planned the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta and was implicated in the 2002 Makassar bombing, the 2004 Poso bus bombing, the 2005 Tentena market bombings and the 2005 Bali bombings.

In July 2004, Azahari and Noordin narrowly escaped a police raid on a rented house west of Jakarta, where forensic experts later found traces of explosives used in the embassy bombing. Neighbours described both as reclusive men who left the property only to pray at a nearby mosque; and they said that before the bombing, they saw the duo loading heavy boxes into a white delivery van which is the same type used in that attack. 

Before the Marriott Hotel bombing, Azahari is known to have stayed with Asmar Latin Sani, the suspected Marriott suicide bomber, at his home in Bengkulu on the island of Sumatra.

Both men were close associates of Jemaah Islamiyah&#x27;s former operational chief, Riduan Isamuddin (better known as Hambali), who was captured in Thailand in 2003.

==Death==
On 9 November 2005, Indonesian police, acting on a tip-off, located Azahari. They conducted a raid on one of his hideouts in Batu, East Java with Detachment 88 operators sent to assist regular police officers. Three suspected jihadist terrorists barricaded themselves inside a house and they put up stiff resistance, throwing grenades and firing bullets at the police outside. This was followed by a series of explosions, one of which was a suicide blast by his assistant setting off his bomb vest. Police identified the intact corpse of Azahari, with a bullet wound in his chest. Azahari was shot and killed by a police sniper, after which one of his disciples blew himself up to prevent him from being taken alive.

<text>Mark Alexander Boyd (13 January 1562 – 10 April 1601) was a Scottish poet and soldier of fortune. He was born in Ayrshire, Scotland. His father was from Penkill, Carrick, in Ayrshire. He was educated under the care of his uncle, the Archbishop of Glasgow, James Boyd of Trochrig. As a young man, he left Scotland for France, where he studied civil law. He took part in the French Wars of Religion, serving in the army of Henri III.

He had two collections of Latin poems published, in 1590 and 1592, at a time when he was teaching at the College of Guienne in Bordeaux. He returned to Scotland in 1596, and died back in Ayrshire on 10 April 1601. He is now remembered for one poem in Scots, the &quot;Sonnet of Venus and Cupid&quot;, which was attributed to him by Arthur Quiller-Couch in 1900, and which Ezra Pound called &quot;the most beautiful sonnet in the language&quot;

<text>Stewart Edgertson McLean (21 November 1913 – 13 April 1996) was a Manitoba politician. He served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir, and unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1967.

The son of David McLean, he was born and raised in Dauphin, Manitoba, and received a B.A. and an LL.B. from the University of Saskatchewan. McLean came down with tuberculosis before he entered service in the Royal Canadian Air Force during World War II. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1945, and served as Mayor of Dauphin from 1955 to 1958.

In 1958, McLean was elected to the Manitoba legislature for the riding of Dauphin. A Progressive Conservative, McLean was appointed Minister of Education in the minority government of Dufferin Roblin. He retained this position after Roblin&#x27;s Tories won a majority government in 1959, and was responsible for overseeing the consolidation of several school boards.

On 9 December 1963, McLean was shifted to the office of Attorney-General. He held this position until 22 July 1966, when he was appointed Provincial Secretary and Minister of Public Works.

Ideologically, McLean was a representative of the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s right wing, and had difficulty accepting some of Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s more innovative policies (for instance, &quot;shared services&quot; for separate schools).

When Roblin moved to federal politics in 1967, McLean was one of four candidates who sought to replace him. He placed third on the first ballot with 87 votes, and was eliminated on the second after falling to 73. Most of his supporters voted for Weir, the winning candidate, on the third and final ballot.

Weir initially kept McLean as Provincial Secretary and Public Works Minister, but shifted him to the Ministry of Transportation on 24 September 1968.

Weir&#x27;s Tories were defeated by Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats in 1969. McLean was personally defeated in by New Democrat Peter Burtniak, after a recount, by 41 votes. He did not return to provincial politics after this.

After leaving politics, he served as a judge in Saskatchewan, retiring in 1983.

McLean died at home in Dauphin in 1996.

<doc id="915395" wikidata="Q5346137" url="?curid=915395" title="Edwards v. California">
<text>Edwards v. People of State of California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), was a landmark United States Supreme Court case where a California law prohibiting the bringing of a non-resident &quot;indigent person&quot; into the state was struck down as unconstitutional.

The so-called anti-Okie law made it a misdemeanor to bring into California &quot;any indigent person who is not a resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person.&quot; Edwards was a Californian who had driven to Texas and returned with his unemployed brother-in-law. He was tried, convicted and given a six-month suspended sentence. 

On appeal from the Superior Court of Yuba County, the Supreme Court unanimously vacated the verdict and declared the law unconstitutional, as violating the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause. Justice Byrnes wrote the majority opinion. In concurring opinions, Justices Douglas joined by Justices Black and Murphy, and Justice Jackson held that the law violated the Privileges or Immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

==Background==
Edwards was a citizen of the United States and a Californian resident. In December 1939, he left his home in Marysville for Spur, Texas, with the intent of picking up his brother-in-law, Frank Duncan, a citizen of the US and of Texas, and returning home to California with Duncan. During the course of his trip, Edwards was made aware of the fact that Duncan was unemployed and had little money and few personal possessions. 

As such, Duncan was classified as an indigent individual under California state law, the transportation of which into the state was strictly prohibited under Section 2615 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of California: &quot;Every person, firm or corporation, or officer or agent thereof that brings or assists in bringing into the State any indigent person who is not a resident of the State, knowing him to be an indigent person, is guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot; 

A complaint was subsequently filed against Edwards in Justice Court, where he was convicted and sentenced to six months imprisonment in the county jail. Edwards appealed to the Superior Court of Yuba County and later to the Supreme Court of the United States, on the argument that his sentence was unconstitutional on the basis that the California law violated the Commerce Clause.

==Holding==

The Court found that Section 2615 of the Welfare and Institutions Code of California violated Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.

==Concurrences==

In writing their concurring opinions, the additional justices chose to forgo the explanation that California had violated Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, arguing that defining the transportation of human beings as “commerce” raises a number of troubling moral questions which undermine individual rights and devalue the original intent of the Commerce Clause. Instead, they propose the idea that the impairment of one&#x27;s ability to freely traverse interstate borders is a violation of the implied rights of US citizenship, and thereby violates the 14th Amendment and the individual&#x27;s right to equal protection.

<text>Blacon is a suburb that is predominately a council estate on the outskirts of Chester, England. It was once one of the largest council housing estates in Europe.

==Geography==

Blacon is next to the Welsh border, on a hill one mile north-west of and overlooking Chester. The village is built on what was previously farmland and is surrounded by open countryside. Blacon has views across to the city centre of Chester and to the Welsh hills twenty miles to the west.
Other nearby places include Upton-by-Chester to the north, Saughall and Mollington to the north-west, Newtown to the north-east and the border town of Saltney to the south. Blacon also has a close proximity to the Wirral, being 6.5 miles from the village of Overpool.

==History==
===North Blacon (Blacon Hall)===

Blacon was originally known as &quot;Blakon Hill&quot; and was owned by the Marquess of Crewe.
The Parish of Blacon cum Crabwall was formed in 1923, and on 1 April 1936, under the Cheshire County Review Order, 1936, most of the parish was transferred to Chester County Borough.

It was a small farming village community until major building work by Chester City Council began in the early 1950s. Most of the older and original estate was built in the ten years to 1960, though further parts were added, on the old army camp site in South Blacon, in the late 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. &#x27;The Parade&#x27; Shops, built in 1954 in north Blacon, are an example of Chester City Council building. In 2015, the Parade Enterprise Centre opened, a joint venture between Avenue Services and Cheshire West and Chester Council. The Parade Enterprise Centre houses Sanctuary Housing, Blacon Library, as well as a community hall and various other offices for local businesses.

===Blacon Camp (Blacon Lodge)===

The British Army maintained an army camp in south Blacon, from just before, to just after, the Second World War. A mixture of wooden and &#x27;Nissen&#x27; huts were occupied by soldiers until the late 1950s; and the army firing range was still in evidence until the Chester City Council &#x27;tower block&#x27; buildings of the mid-1960s. Blacon Camp housed various military operations, containing aircraft and war prisoners at the time. This part of (South) Blacon is referred to as &#x27;The Camp&#x27; by local residents.

==Community initiatives==
The Blacon Together Pathfinder was established in 2001 as part of the first round of Pathfinders and subsequently the Blacon community took part in many initiatives, led by the government&#x27;s Neighbourhood Management Pathfinder Programme, and a number of projects have been established by, and for, Blacon residents.

Progress to improve the estate continues apace, with work done by the Blacon Community Trust in partnership with the Chester and District Housing Trust forming &#x27;The Blacon Alliance&#x27;.

==Policing==
Blacon is home to the new headquarters of the Western Division of the Cheshire Constabulary.

==Schools==
===Primary===
* Highfield Community Primary School
* J H Godwin Primary School
* Dee Point Primary School
* St Thereas&#x27;s Catholic Primary School
* The Arches Community Primary School
*Chester Blue Coat CE Primary School

===Secondary===
* Blacon High School, previously a specialist Sports College school

===Former===
* Bishop&#x27;s School
* Charles Kingsley Secondary School for Girls
*Highfield Middle School 
*Dee Point Middle School

==Places of worship==
There are several places of worship in Blacon to cater for Christian and Islamic faiths. Holy Trinity-Without-The-Walls is the Church of England parish church. St Theresa&#x27;s is the Roman Catholic Church, erected in 1959 with the support of the local Catholic Community; it is associated with a primary school of the same name and which is located behind the church. The primary school was formed by the combination of the former Our Lady of Mount Carmel Middle School and St Theresa&#x27;s Junior School which was situated on Blacon Point Road. 
The Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses is on Melbourne Road. 
There is a Shah Jalal Mosque on Clifton Drive to the south of the suburb.

==Blacon Cemetery==
Blacon Cemetery was laid out in 1940, during the Second World War, when two plots, in Sections A and H, were set aside for service burials. The cemetery&#x27;s first interment took place on 20 December 1941. The cemetery contains in all the war graves of 461 Commonwealth service personnel, including an unidentified Royal Air Force airman, and 97 war graves of other nationalities (86 of them Polish servicemen from various hospitals in the area) that are maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The plot in Section A was a Royal Air Force regional cemetery for air personnel from bases in Cheshire and neighbouring counties, while members of other armed services were buried in Section H.

In 1965 Chester Crematorium, built with garden of remembrance adjoining Section A, was opened. The original chapel was replaced with a new larger chapel that was built alongside it and opened in April 2013. The site of the older building, after its demolition, has been utilised as a memorial garden.

==Blacon railway station==


Blacon station was served from Chester Northgate Station, Newtown; however, the station was closed to passengers on 9 September 1968 as part of the &#x27;Beeching Axe&#x27; for the economic modernisation of the British railway network in the mid-1960s. Freight trains ran through Blacon until 20 April 1984, resuming as a single track line on 31 August 1986 before closing again in 1992.

Although the old station and railway line have gone, they have been replaced with a tarmac road surface, which now provides a cycle path, jogging track and a countryside walkway.
This amenity is accessed from the side of old Blacon station bridge; but its route can also be joined (just off) Chester&#x27;s &#x27;Fountain&#x27; roundabout, travelling via Blacon, and on to the North Wales countryside. Other joined routes can be accessed along the way.

In 2008, a volunteer group headed by Stephen Perry in association with the Blacon Community Trust began to raise support for a major improvement of the Blacon Railway Station site. Improvements to date have included woodland sculptures, clearing and new planting of shrubs and trees and the planting of narcissi with much volunteer involvement from local schools and residents. The site (in November 2009) was undergoing phase 2 of a major development to introduce pathways, fencing and special hard-landscaping features. The community trust placed a large train wheel mosaic consisting of pieces from schools and services local to the Blacon area.

As of July 2015, the Blacon Railway has been refurbished and fully maintained. There are now new stairs and ramps for easy access, signs containing the history of the station (exact contents will be given at a later date), and various landscaping improvements to increase appearance and appeal. There is also a large concrete circle at the centre of the station, which contains various carvings into concrete slabs and pieces arranged into sections. These segments were carved by school children and teenagers from the local schools and projects, and contain each student&#x27;s particular activity, object or person that they at the time cherished the most.

==Politics==
===Local government changes, April 2009===
Blacon consisted of two Chester City Council wards, each of which elected three councillors. Chester City Council became defunct on 1 April 2009 due to structural changes.

Cheshire West and Chester (CWAC) is the successor unitary authority area with borough status, in the ceremonial county of Cheshire. It was established in April 2009 as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England, by virtue of an order under the Local Government and Public Involvement in Health Act 2007.

<doc id="915415" wikidata="Q551776" url="?curid=915415" title="Patrick Poivre d'Arvor">
<text>Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor (PPDA; né Patrick Jean Marcel Poivre, ; born 20 September 1947) is a French TV journalist and writer. He is a household name in France, and nicknamed &quot;PPDA&quot;. With over 30 years and in excess of 4,500 editions of television news to his credit, he was one of the longest serving newsreaders in the world until he was fired in 2008. He presented his last newscast on TF1 on 10 July 2008.
Since 2021, a total of 27 women have accused Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor of sexual assault or rape that would have allegedly happened during decades prior. Seventeen women filed a formal complaint. Among them, eight did so for alleged rape.
==Biography==
Patrick Poivre was born in Reims, France. He obtained his Baccalauréat at 15, the year he became a father. He then studied Oriental Languages at the Institut national des langues et civilisations orientales and Law. Poivre claims to be descended in the male line from Jacques Poivre, brother of Pierre Poivre, an 18th-century nobleman in the time of Louis XV, &quot;d&#x27;Arvor&quot; being Jacques Poivre&#x27;s pseudonym. Poivre, his siblings and his three surviving children legally changed their surname to Poivre d&#x27;Arvor in 1994.

===Journalistic career===
Poivre started training as a journalist at the Centre de formation des journalistes (CFJ) at 22. He obtained his first job in 1971 on France Inter as morning newsreader.

In 1974, at the time of Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s accession to the Presidency, Poivre joined Antenne 2. He made his first TV appearance there in 1975, and was presenter for news bulletins from 16 February 1976 to 28 July 1983. After a brief stint with Canal+, he joined TF1 in 1986 for the Sunday program &quot;A la folie pas du tout&quot; and &quot;Ex Libris&quot;, from Frederic Lepage.

On 31 August 1987, he became presenter for the weekday news of TF1 at 8 pm from Monday to Thursday. He is satirised in the French puppet show &quot;Les Guignols de l&#x27;info&quot; on Canal+, where his alter ego is the puppet PPD, the news presenter. In 2004, Poivre was cast in a minor voice-only role as a newscaster in the French version of the Pixar animated film &quot;The Incredibles&quot; (&quot;Les Indestructibles&quot;).

On 9 June 2008, it was announced that by Laurence Ferrari would replace Poivre d&#x27;Arvor as presenter of the 8 pm news. He made his last broadcast on 10 July. In an interview, he said that there was &quot;no objective&quot; reason for his dismissal, but declined to comment on &quot;rumours&quot; of political interference.

Since January 2009, Patrick Poivre d&#x27;Arvor presents &quot;La traversée du miroir&quot; on France 5. He also presented &quot;L&#x27;avis des autres&quot; on Arte.

In July 2009, he was approached by the I-Télé channel to present&quot;The&quot;18h-20h. But he declined the invitation.

In June 2010, he led a team in the French TV show &quot;Fort Boyard&quot;.

===Professional controversies===
His greatest controversy prior to his being accused of rape was the faked interview - actually footage of a press conference with added questions - he purported to have made with Cuban president Fidel Castro, broadcast on 16 December 1991. &quot;Télérama&quot; journalist Pierre Carles exposed this fraud, which Poivre blamed on his colleague and co-interviewer Régis Faucon, after the latter had departed TF1.

On 10 January 1996, the Court of Appeal sentenced Poivre to 15 months in prison (suspended) and fined him 200,000 Francs for his part in misappropriation of public funds in a case involving Pierre Botton and his father-in-law and then deputy mayor of Lyon, Michel Noir.

In December 2008, Nonce Paolini, former Chief Executive of TF1, filed for defamation against Poivre d&#x27;Arvor in the Correctional Tribunal of Paris: during an interview by &quot;Bretons&quot; in the preceding July, Poivre had accused the TF1 chief of having &quot;installed a clocking-in system with access badges&quot; and had formed &quot;a private police force whose aim was scrutinising staff movements in the smallest detail&quot;.

===Personal life===
He married Véronique Courcoux in 1971, with whom he had six children. They divorced in 2010. He has three surviving children from that marriage and one son from an affair with fellow news-anchor Claire Chazal. His and Véronique&#x27;s son Arnaud, spoke about the divorce of his parents in 2010 in the Magazine Gala. One daughter, Solenn, committed suicide at a Paris metro station in 1995, aged 19, having been a long-term anorexic. Her plight became a symbol of the problems of anorexia and bulimia, with Poivre becoming a campaigner and writer on the issue. In December 2004, Bernadette Chirac, wife of former President Jacques Chirac, whose daughter also suffered from the disorder, opened a treatment centre in Paris for adolescents and named it &quot;Maison de Solenn&quot;.

Poivre caused controversy by presenting his regular news bulletin the evening after Solenn&#x27;s death.

For several years in the 1990s, rumours abounded that Poivre had had an affair with Claire Chazal, his weekend counterpart as TF1 8 pm news presenter. The pair refused to confirm the story until August 2005, when Poivre acknowledged in &quot;Confessions&quot;, a book of interviews to journalist Serge Raffy, that he was the father of Claire Chazal&#x27;s 10-year-old son, François. &quot;We had set at [François&#x27; age] ten the time that this story would be revealed&quot;, Poivre said.

In February 2021, the prosecutors&#x27; office in Nanterre confirmed that Poivre was under investigation due to allegations of rape by a female writer, Florence Porcel, on several occasions between 2004 and 2009, as reported in her autobiographical book &quot;Pandorini&quot;. He was formally charged of rape in December 2023.

==Published works==
He has published many books, two of which are dedicated to his daughter Solenn. He has also written prefaces to books by other authors, and these are not listed here.

<doc id="915418" wikidata="Q644406" url="?curid=915418" title="A. S. F. Gow">
<text>Andrew Sydenham Farrar Gow (27 August 1886 – 2 February 1978) was an English classical scholar and teacher. Apart from eleven years as a master at Eton College between 1914 and 1925 his career was entirely at Trinity College, Cambridge.

At Trinity, Gow was a colleague and friend of A. E. Housman, on whose works he became an authority. The two men shared a sharp-tongued scholarly intolerance of anything they saw as slipshod, pretentious or badly thought-through, but Gow nonetheless won the affection of many of his students. He was Housman&#x27;s literary executor, and published a book about his friend shortly after Housman&#x27;s death.

Gow&#x27;s principal subject as a scholar was the Greek bucolic poet Theocritus, his works on whom remain a core source for modern students of the poet.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Gow was born in Gower Street, London, the eldest of the three children, all of whom were boys, of Dr (later the Rev) James Gow (1854–1923) and his wife Gertrude Sydenham, &quot;née&quot; Everett-Green. James Gow, formerly a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, was headmaster of Nottingham High School from 1885 to 1901, and of Westminster School from 1901 to 1919. Gow was christened Andrew after an uncle who was Keeper of the Royal Academy, and, according to a biographical sketch in &quot;The Times&quot;, it may well have been from the uncle and his circle of friends, which included Poynter and Alma-Tadema, that Gow derived his interest in paintings.

Gow was educated at Nottingham High School and then at Rugby School, after which, in 1905, he won a classical scholarship to Trinity, Cambridge. In the following five years he twice won the Porson Prize for Greek verse composition, the Browne medal for Latin and Greek poetry, and the Charles Oldham Classical Scholarship. Together with Rupert Brooke and others he helped to found the Marlowe Society. He took a first class in both parts of the tripos, gaining a distinction in classical archaeology.

===Early career===

Gow was elected a Fellow of Trinity in 1911, and took a number of pupils. He applied on four occasions for permanent posts in Cambridge, but was unsuccessful each time. His biographer Hugh Lloyd-Jones suggests that Gow&#x27;s personality and appearance were a hindrance:
In 1914 Gow became a master at Eton College, where he remained for eleven years. He did not serve in the armed forces during the First World War, because a heart murmur disqualified him for service; he volunteered to help train young soldiers in the use of the Lewis gun. Lloyd-Jones comments that some of Gow&#x27;s Eton pupils were daunted by his dryness and his caustic wit, others recognised his fine scholarship and the considerable help he gave them; he became known, not unaffectionately, as &quot;Granny Gow&quot; by pupils and colleagues. His Eton pupils included Alan Clutton-Brock, David Lindsay, Anthony Powell, and George Orwell.

===Trinity don===

By 1925 Gow was settled at Eton and looking forward to becoming a housemaster, when he was invited to resume his fellowship at Trinity as a preliminary to being appointed Tutor. He hesitated because his perfectionism led him to question whether he could meet the academic standards he felt necessary for such a post. Two academics who knew him well, D. S. Robertson and A. E. Housman convinced him that his doubts were unwarranted, and he accepted. Trinity remained his home for the rest of his life. He was a University Lecturer, 1925–51; Tutor, 1929–42; Praelector, 1946–51; and Brereton Reader in Classics, 1947–51.

Gow served successively on the Council of the Senate, the General Board of the Faculties, and, as chairman, the Board of Fine Arts. More congenial to him, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, was his long membership of the Fitzwilliam Museum board. Lloyd-Jones writes that Gow did much to interest undergraduates in art, &quot;a subject by no means popular among the Cambridge dons of his generation.&quot; Though not a man of means, Gow became a respected collector and connoisseur of art. Among the undergraduates who were grateful for his enthusiasm and guidance was Anthony Blunt; he wrote of Gow:
Gow, like his friend and Trinity colleague Housman, was known for his high standards, impatience with anything second-rate, and a sharp tongue. His Eton colleague and lifelong friend George Lyttelton commented, &quot;That Housman blend of an impossibly lofty and unsympathetic standard with needlessly abusive words is really very regrettable and unhelpful&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; observed that another side to Gow&#x27;s character was shown in the letters he wrote month by month to pupils serving in the forces during the Second World War: &quot;In them he is as his friends knew him – wise, warm-hearted, and possessed of a rich sense of humour. For Housman, &quot;No one could have a better friend than I have found in Gow,&quot; although even Gow sometimes found the older man daunting: when asked by colleagues to put a knotty question of translation to Housman, he refused, on the grounds that Housman would merely say that the meaning was obvious to the feeblest intellect. Shortly after Housman&#x27;s death in 1936 he published a short study of his friend; although it concentrated on Housman&#x27;s scholarship, in Lloyd-Jones&#x27;s view it &quot;throws more light upon him than almost any of the studies by literary persons&quot;. Gow acted as Housman&#x27;s literary executor, collaborating uneasily with Laurence Housman, the poet&#x27;s brother, whom he found difficult; Gow supervised a second edition of Housman&#x27;s edition of Manilius in 1937.

From 1947 to 1953 Gow served as a trustee of the National Gallery. He built up a private collection of the works of Degas, which he left to the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Gow&#x27;s scholarly publications include editions of his main study, Theocritus, and works by Nicander, Machon, Moschus, and Bion. He prepared the second edition of Housman&#x27;s edition of Manilius, and the second volume of Sir William Ridgeway&#x27;s &quot;The Early Age of Greece&quot;. In Lloyd-Jones&#x27;s view Gow&#x27;s work on Theocritus and Hellenistic epigrams will remain &quot;an essential instrument of scholarship&quot;.

In 1951 Gow retired from his lecturing posts, continuing to live in rooms at Trinity until 1973 when he moved to a nursing home in Cambridge, where he died in 1978 at the age of ninety-one. He never married.

<text>George Johnson, OC (November 18, 1920 – July 8, 1995) was a medical doctor and is seen by historians as one of the leading political reformers of the twentieth century in Manitoba. He served as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir and as the province&#x27;s 20th Lieutenant Governor from 1986 to 1993.

==Early life==
Johnson was born in Winnipeg, to a family of Icelandic heritage. He received a B.Sc. and M.D. from the University of Manitoba and served as a Lieutenant (later, Captain) with the Royal Canadian Navy from 1941 to 1945.

==Political career==
Johnson was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1958, for the riding of Gimli, north of Winnipeg. A Progressive Conservative, he was appointed Minister of Health and Public Welfare in the minority government of Dufferin Roblin, who had personally recruited him to run for the party. He retained the health portfolio when the Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in 1959, and oversaw a policy of major hospital expansions in the province and other significant reforms between 1959 and 1963.

On December 9, 1963, Johnson moved to the Ministry of Education as the government sought to cope with the educational requirements of a rapidly expanding baby-boom population. He held this position until September 24, 1968, and was responsible for, among other achievements, the establishment of the universities of Winnipeg and Brandon, respectively, and the Manitoba Institute of Technology (later &#x27;Red River Community College&#x27;), and for introducing the policy of &quot;shared services&quot; for public and separate schools (allowing children in separate schools to access public programs for busing, textbooks and the like). In 1968, Johnson returned to his old portfolio as Minister of Health, to oversee an historic change in the provision of medical services: the implementation of medicare in Manitoba.

Ideologically, Johnson was a progressive, often referred to as (somewhat erroneously) a Red Tory with beliefs similar to those held by Premier Roblin. Along with Roblin, he is considered by historians to be the leading political reformer of his generation and among the most influential cabinet ministers in Manitoba history. Although generally a free marketeer, Johnson supported government intervention in the economy in certain areas, for example, in such areas as public utility management, education, major infrastructure projects and certain medical services. When Roblin shifted to federal politics in 1967, Johnson was the only candidate from the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s progressive wing to seek its leadership. A late entry into the leadership race hurt his campaign and while he was the alternative choice for leader among many delegates, the fact that Johnson did not survive to the later balloting prevented him from emerging as the possible compromise choice for party leader among delegates.

===Break from politics===
Johnson did not seek re-election in 1969, and returned to medical practice in Winnipeg. An experienced physician, within a few years he had one of the largest medical practices in Manitoba.

===Lieutenant governorship===
Leaving medicine again for the public arena in 1978, Johnson served for the subsequent eight years as a special consultant to the Manitoba government, providing strategic advice and counsel to the government in various areas of health policy. On December 11, 1986, in &quot;recognition of his services to the people of Manitoba&quot;, he was appointed as the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor by Governor General Jeanne Sauvé, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. He served in this position until March 5, 1993.

==Honours==
In his career, the governments of Canada and Iceland conferred on Johnson the highest civilian honours that can be bestowed on their respective citizens: the Order of Canada in 1994, and the Icelandic Order of the Falcon in 1992. He was also awarded honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from three universities: Manitoba, Winnipeg and Royal Roads (1992–95).

George Johnson Middle School in Gimli was named in his honour.

==Death==
Johnson died in 1995 in Gimli. His wife, the former Doris Blondal, died the following year. They had six children and ten grandchildren. Their daughter Janis was a Manitoba senator for twenty six years.

<text>Project Open Hand is a California nonprofit organization that provides medically tailored meals and groceries to elderly and homebound people in San Francisco and Alameda County. Founded in 1985 to deliver meals to people with AIDS, it also took over food banks in the 1980s and 1990s and in the 21st century extended its services to include people with other acute and chronic conditions and to serve lunches to seniors. Its headquarters are at 730 Polk Street in the Tenderloin; its CEO is Paul Hepfer.
== History ==
Project Open Hand was created in 1985 by Ruth Brinker, who had worked in food service and as an executive director for Meals on Wheels and recognized the relatively small number of social services for those infected with HIV and their particular need for nourishing food since there was at the time no treatment for AIDS. It began as meal service to seven people with AIDS, paid for by a $2,000 grant from the San Francisco Zen Center and the Golden Gate Business Association. Meals were initially cooked in her kitchen and later at Trinity Episcopal Church; in 1987, a grant from the Chevron Corporation enabled a move to a professional kitchen, and Project Open Hand took over a food bank. In 1991, it also took over the AIDS Food Bank from the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. It served 500 meals a day by 1988, and opened its Oakland branch on October 17, 1989, the day of the Loma Prieta earthquake; it opened a second professional kitchen in Oakland in 1996, and in 1997 moved to 730 Polk Street, which it had purchased as its headquarters.

Tom Nolan, executive director from 1994 to 2011, began expanding the organization&#x27;s mission to include senior citizens and people with serious illnesses other than AIDS and chronic conditions such as diabetes. Nolan was succeeded by Kevin Winge, who expanded food pickup services from those with HIV or breast cancer to people with other conditions including diabetes and heart disease, followed in 2016 by Mark Ryle. Paul Hepfer became executive director in March 2019.

In 2014–16, Project Open Hand participated in a study by the University of California, San Francisco of the role of nutritious food in supporting the sick; since its institution in June 2017, it has played a major role in Food is Medicine, a three-year state-funded pilot project to provide medically tailored meals to chronically ill people receiving assistance through Medi-Cal, the California version of Medicaid.

Much of the organization&#x27;s work is done by volunteers, 125 a day in 2003. It is funded by a combination of donations, including from foundations such as the Isabel Allende Foundation, federal, and city assistance. it delivered 1,600 dinners a day and 1,500 bags of groceries a week, and provided as many as 300 bags of groceries to walk-in clients at its food bank. it was serving almost 2,000 clients a day, and in 2004 it had a total of 30,000 clients. it was receiving $5.6 million a year in donations and government funding and serving almost 2,600 meals a day, to seniors and people with cancer and other serious illnesses in addition to AIDS, as well as providing groceries. it had a $10 million budget and served approximately 8,000 clients, including 4,400 in the senior lunch program. it provided 2,500 meals and 200 bags of groceries a day. Until 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic prevented it, it also hosted holiday gatherings at the end of the year.

Responding to the AIDS emergency led many charities formed at the time, including Project Open Hand, to prioritize services over bookkeeping; after being taken to task by the &quot;Bay Area Reporter&quot;, the organization instituted a board of directors and reduced pay for the director. In the late 1980s and early 1990s its finances were investigated and no improprieties found.

Singer-songwriter Sylvester dictated in his will that posthumous proceeds from his albums would be directed to Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. After the fulfillment of his past debts in the 1990s, the balance of his proceeds have been split between the two organizations since.

<text>Anna Maree Devenish Meares (born 21 September 1983) is an Australian retired track cyclist. She currently resides in Adelaide in South Australia where the Australian Institute of Sport&#x27;s Track Cycling program has its headquarters at the Adelaide Super-Drome.

She has been the 500 metre track time trial world champion on four occasions, and a gold medallist at the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. At the 2015 UCI Track Cycling World Championships Meares took the gold in the keirin—her 11th world title in total, which made her the most decorated female track cyclist of all time.

She was the flag-bearer and captain for the Australian team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where she won a bronze medal in keirin. This made her the first Australian to win individual medals in four consecutive Olympics.

On 16 October 2016, Meares announced her official retirement from her current competitive cycling career. In November 2022, she was appointed as the Chef de Mission of the Australian team for the 2024 Paris Olympic Games.

==Biography==
Anna Meares started competitive cycling at the age of 11 in 1994, following her older sister Kerrie Meares into the sport. The family were inspired to take up competitive cycling by Kathy Watt winning a cycling gold medal at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. With the family living in the small Queensland coal-mining town of Middlemount, it was more than two hours drive to the nearest cycling track at Mackay for the girls to train.

Over the course of her career, Meares has talked about how gradually she became aware of her position as a role model, portraying &quot;a different stereotypical image of what it is to be a strong woman. It&#x27;s not always about being skinny. It&#x27;s about your presentation and your confidence and everyone is unique.&quot;

In February 2020, she gave birth to a daughter, Evelyn, with her partner Nick Flygger.

===2002===
In 2002 Meares narrowly missed a bronze medal in the inaugural inclusion of the 500-metre time trial at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, while her older sister, Kerrie Meares won the gold medal in the event. She won a bronze medal in the sprint.

===2004===
During the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, she won a gold medal, and set a new world record in the Women&#x27;s 500-metre time trial of 33.952 seconds. Meares had to beat a new Olympic record set just minutes previously by the reigning World Record holder, Yonghua Jiang of China. (See Cycling at the 2004 Summer Olympics). The event was abolished from the Olympic program so Meares could not defend her title in 2008.
Meares also won a bronze medal in the Women&#x27;s 200m Sprint event in Athens.

In May 2004 at the Time Trial World Titles in Melbourne Meares claimed the title of Women&#x27;s World time trial champion, and won a silver for the sprint event. Also claimed first in the 2004 World Cup Time Trial in Sydney.

===2005===
In 2005, Meares enrolled in a Bachelor of Learning Design course at Central Queensland University, but deferred her studies to concentrate on sport.

===2008===
Meares made an astonishing come back from a very bad cycling accident at the World Cup in January 2008 when she broke her neck. Meares crashed in the third round of the World Cup circuit in Los Angeles in January 2008, seven months out from the Olympics. Meares fractured her C2 vertebra, dislocated her right shoulder, suffered torn ligaments and tendons, a heavily bruised right hip and skin abrasions as a result of skin sliding on wood when she crashed at 65 km/h. Astonishingly she was back on the bike just 10 days after the fall and went through intensive rehabilitation. With the points Meares had secured prior to the crash, she was able to fight her way back and qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Meares had an eventful semi-final in the sprint at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Having lost the first heat to her opponent Guo Shuang, she won the second heat. The third heat saw Guo come down the banking too steeply and her front wheel slipped from beneath her. The heat was re-run and although Guo won by a few millimetres, she was relegated for coming down the track and pushing Meares onto the côte d&#x27;azure on the final lap. This put Meares through to the final ride-off for gold against Victoria Pendleton, where she was beaten and received the silver medal.

===2012===
At the 2012 World Championships which took place in Meares&#x27; home country of Australia in Melbourne, Meares was favourite for three gold medals. In the team sprint Meares won silver as Germany set two world records in the event. In qualification for the individual sprint Meares broke the world record for the flying start 200 metres. Meares completed her four laps in just 10.782 seconds shaving 11 thousands of a second off Simona Krupeckaitė&#x27;s mark. In the semi-final Meares faced her old rival Pendleton. Pendleton clashed with the Australian in their first heat and ended up on the floor before Meares was relegated from the second for going outside of her lane. In the decider Pendleton won in a photo finish, with Meares settling for bronze after defeating Lyubov Shulika. In the keirin, Meares won both her qualifying races before reaching the final, where she held off Russian Ekaterina Gnidenko and German Kristina Vogel to win the first of two world championships in Melbourne. Meares set her second world record of the championships in her final event. Meares recorded 33.010 seconds to break the record by .286 of a second which was previously held by Simona Krupeckaitė. With the time Meares won her second title of the championships and equaled Felicia Ballanger&#x27;s record of ten world titles.

In preparation for the Olympics, Meares and her coach, West, tailored a &#x27;Project Know Thy Enemy&#x27; program. The &#x27;Project&#x27; involved Meares racing against male sprinter: Alex Bird; who would mimic Pendleton: former &quot;friend&quot; turned &quot;enemy&quot;. The objective was to run multiple racing scenarios and find the best tactic to beat &quot;Queen Vic&quot;.

At the 2012 London Olympics, Meares qualified for the final of the sprint, where she again faced Victoria Pendleton. In the first sprint of the final, Pendleton crossed the line first, but was controversially relegated after illegally moving off her line as the cyclists sped through the final banking, which many believe was as a result of Meares aggressive riding. Meares won the second sprint to win 2–0 and take the gold medal. When asked about her tactics, perceived as being unsporting, she responded: &quot;this is sport [...] We&#x27;re not out there to have a cup of tea&quot;. She also won a bronze medal with Kaarle McCulloch in the team sprint.

===2013===
Meares took rest after the 2012 Olympics and skipped the 2013 World Championship. She returned to competitions in July 2013. Later that year she set a new world record of 32.836 seconds in the women&#x27;s 500 m time trial at the UCI Mexico Track World Cup, making her the first woman to go under 33 seconds in the event.

===2015–16===
In late February 2015, Meares competed at the world championships and won three medals. She also separated from her husband of nine years, Mark Chadwick, early in 2015.

At the 2016 Rio Olympics Meares took part in three events. She won a bronze medal in the keirin, placing tenth in the individual sprint and fourth in the team sprint.

<doc id="915438" wikidata="Q3522915" url="?curid=915438" title="The Suicide Commandos">
<text>The Suicide Commandos are an American punk rock trio from Minneapolis. They formed in 1975 and released two 7-inch EPs on an indie label in 1976 and 1977 before signing with Blank Records (a subsidiary label of Mercury Records) in 1977 and releasing one album, &quot;Make a Record&quot;. Despite their short original 4-year stint together, the Suicide Commandos are considered the pioneers for jump-starting a punk rock music scene in the Twin Cities, which eventually produced bands like The Suburbs, Hüsker Dü, The Replacements and Soul Asylum.

==History==
Their first album, &quot;Make a Record,&quot; was recorded and released in 1977, and then re-released on Mercury Records on CD in 1996 and on Island/DefJam iTunes in 2007. A live album, &quot;The Suicide Commandos Commit Suicide Dance Concert&quot; was released on Twin/Tone Records in 1979, which was their last performance together before the band broke up. Only 1,000 numbered copies were pressed. In 2000, it was re-released on CD by Garage D&#x27;Or Records. The original vinyl release contained 19 tracks, while the CD re-release increased this figure, bringing the total number of tracks to 32.

Their 1977 song &quot;Burn It Down&quot; inspired a short film directed by rock video pioneer Chuck Statler, which featured the burning of a house the band had used for rehearsing for several years. &quot;Burn It Down&quot; was part of a Chuck Statler video retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in 2006.

===Hiatus===
When the Commandos broke up in 1980, Almaas went to New York and formed a band called The Crackers, then issued a solo EP titled &quot;Beat Rodeo&quot;. In 1982, Almaas formed a four-man group called (The) Beat Rodeo, which issued two well-received albums in the mid-80s before disbanding. Almaas then went solo again, issuing six albums over the next two decades.

===Re-formation===
The Suicide Commandos&#x27; song &quot;Complicated Fun&quot; was used for Target commercials for Xbox and PlayStation products in 2003–2004. The band was a headline act at the Minnesota State Fair in 2007.

Ahl and Osgood were street corner acoustic musicians in St. Paul during the 2008 Republican convention.

On January 17, 2009, the Commandos played a benefit at Nick &amp; Eddie in Minneapolis for Laura Kennedy, bassist and founding member of the NYC no-wave band the Bush Tetras, who had recently received a liver transplant. David Thomas of Pere Ubu was guest vocalist. November 7, 2009, was declared &quot;Suicide Commando Day&quot; in the city of Minneapolis, MN by Mayor RT Rybak.

On January 29, 2012, the band were a co-headlining act at the 7th Birthday Party for the popular member-supported radio station, &quot;The Current&quot; (89.3 FM). The event was held at 1st Avenue in downtown Minneapolis and brought thousands of the most dedicated fans of the radio station together to witness an important piece of punk rock history at a legendary Minneapolis venue.

The Current released a ten-inch EP called &quot;The Current Makes A Record&quot; featuring studio performances by The Hold Steady and The Suicide Commandos in a limited, numbered 1,000-copy edition to celebrate their 10th Anniversary in January 2015. (Much like the limited, numbered 1000 copies of Twin/Tone Records &quot;The Commandos Commit Suicide Dance Party&quot;- recorded performances of the Commandos &quot;final shows&quot; at The Longhorn Bar, Minneapolis in December 1978.) There was a Record Release Party featuring The Commandos and Craig Finn and Tad Kubler of The Hold Steady at The Turf Club, St. Paul January 16, 2015.

On July 29, 2015, a new Hennepin County highway sign revealed that &quot;The Suicide Commandos Punk Rock Band&quot; had adopted a 1.5 mile stretch of Hennepin County Road 16 or McGinty Road in Minnetonka, MN.

In 2016, the Commandos recorded their first studio album in 38 years. &quot;Time Bomb&quot; was recorded by Kevin Bowe at Master Mix, Minneapolis, MN, mixed by Mitch Easter at Fidelitorium, Kernersville, NC and mastered by Bruce Templeton at Microphonic Mastering, Minneapolis, MN. Additional recording happened in West Saugerties and Chester, New York. Minneapolis&#x27;s pioneering alternative music label Twin/Tone Records was revived to release &quot;Time Bomb&quot;, the label&#x27;s first release since 1994. Each member contributed four songs to the album. The thirteenth song, &quot;If I Can&#x27;t Make You Love Me&quot; was co-written by the band. The first single, “Boogie’s Coldest Acre” became available to United States radio April 5, 2017. Twin/Tone Records began taking pre-orders April 15. 1,000 numbered copies of vinyl and downloads of the album release May 5, 2017, with Listening Party and in-store appearances that weekend.

St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman and Minneapolis Mayor Betsy Hodges declared May 5, 2017 &quot;Commando Day&quot; in the Twin Cities. Vinyl copies of &quot;Time Bomb&quot; sold out immediately.
The Suicide Commandos have been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

June 9, 2021, The Smithsonian issued a &quot;Museum Moment&quot; press release noting that Chris Osgood&#x27;s Commando motorcycle jacket had been added to the collection of the National Museum of American History, as well as a &quot;Your Pal Chris Osgood&quot; guitar pick. Osgood’s jacket and guitar pick “speak evocatively to the establishment of a global aesthetic of punk, established in a synergy of local scenes and community movements, from the Twin Cities to New York City and London,” explains the museum’s Curator of American Music, John W. Troutman, adding that through the collection of these objects, the museum can “further develop its representation of Minneapolis’s diverse and extraordinarily significant music communities.”

<text>Port Hudson is an unincorporated community in East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, United States. Located about northwest of Baton Rouge, it is known primarily as the location of an American Civil War battle, the siege of Port Hudson, in 1863.

==Geography==
Port Hudson is located at , and is along the east bank of the Mississippi River.

==History==
In 1833, one of the first railroads in the United States was built from Port Hudson to Clinton. Clinton was the entrepôt for the produce of much of the region, which, sent by rail, was transferred to steamboats at Port Hudson. Old Port Hudson was incorporated as a town in 1838.

During the American Civil War, the area was the scene of bitter fighting as the Confederacy and Union struggled over control of the Mississippi River (see Siege of Port Hudson). Location of the tracks and the old town can be seen at the bend of the Mississippi River (view 1864 map). The rails and crossties of the track were removed before 1920.

What were then called the 1st and 3rd Regiments of the Louisiana Native Guards (later re-formed as regiments of the United States Colored Troops) proved themselves in battle on the Union side; they were the first black troops to have some black officers. A minority of men in the regiments were free men of color, who had been educated before the war; most of the soldiers were African-American slaves who had escaped to Union lines to gain freedom and support the war.

Port Hudson National Cemetery was established in the area, first as a place of burial of Union dead.

==Landmarks==

A portion of the battlefield site is maintained by the state as a park and museum, called the Port Hudson State Historic Site (in adjacent East Feliciana Parish).

In 1930 the Louisiana Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy erected the Confederate Soldiers monument at the site; it is an 11,000-pound obelisk, dedicated to the defenders&#x27; memory. In 2007 the monument was moved to the yard of one of Port Hudson&#x27;s few surviving buildings from the time of the siege.

In 1974 the Port Hudson National Cemetery was designated a National Historic Landmark by the U.S. Department of the Interior; it is administered by the National Park Service.

In 2009, it was designated among the first 26 featured sites of the Louisiana African American Heritage Trail.

==Representation in culture==
&quot;The Black Brigade at Port Hudson&quot; is a poem by John A. Dorgan, anthologized in &quot;The Rebellion Record: a Diary of American Events: Poetry and Incidents.&quot;

&quot;The Black Regiment: Port Hudson, May 27, 1863&quot;, poem by George Henry Boker (1823-1890). was originally published as a broadside by the Union League, it was included in &quot;The Rebellion Record: A Diary of American Events, Poetry.&quot; The poem was translated into German and published as a broadside, a copy of which has been preserved in the &quot;Black Soldiers Collection&quot; of the Historic New Orleans Collection at the Williams Research Center in New Orleans.

==Events==

A Civil War reenactment is held annually at the Port Hudson State Historic Site.

<text>Trevone (, meaning &quot;river farm&quot;) is a seaside village and bay (, meaning &quot;Musun cove&quot;) near Padstow in Cornwall, England, UK.

==Geography==
Trevone Bay is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). It contains four Geological Conservation Review sites (GCR) and is within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). There are Goniatite fossils on Pentonwarra Point and Conodont fossils on Marble Cliff. The &#x27;Sink Hole&#x27;, a large blowhole formed by a collapsed sea cave, can be seen on a sloping field above the east side of the bay.

Porthmissen Beach received the highest rating for water quality in 2008 and a good rating in 2002. No dogs are allowed on the beach during the summer months.

==Facilities==
The village has a village hall, a shop, a Surfing shop and small seasonal cafe. There is also a general store halfway between the top of the hill and the beach. Trevone has recently had its post office closed down, and the general store where the PO operated from is also now closed. However, there is a new store based at Trevone Farm. 

Trevone used to have many hotels including Green Waves, Newlands, Trevone Bay Hotel, and The Sea Spray, but the only remaining hotel (and pub) in the bay is the Well Parc. The Newlands Hotel (bed and breakfast) has been renamed Trevone Beach House, and is currently being developed into a private family house. The other hotels are now tourist apartments.


==St Saviour&#x27;s Church==
St Saviour&#x27;s Church was built in 1959 with local sandstone from St Columb Downs, replacing a wooden mission church built in 1894. The stone is iron-rich which works outwards as the stone is weathered to give a hard casing. The roof is of Delabole slate. It is dedicated to St Saviour because there was a St Saviour&#x27;s Chapel on what is now St Saviour&#x27;s Point, on the Camel Estuary outside Padstow, inside the Doom Bar.

Elizabeth Maria Molteno, the South African suffragist, poet and civil rights activist, retired to Trevone and is buried at St Saviour&#x27;s.

<text>Counterexamples in Topology (1970, 2nd ed. 1978) is a book on mathematics by topologists Lynn Steen and J. Arthur Seebach, Jr.

In the process of working on problems like the metrization problem, topologists (including Steen and Seebach) have defined a wide variety of topological properties. It is often useful in the study and understanding of abstracts such as topological spaces to determine that one property does not follow from another. One of the easiest ways of doing this is to find a counterexample which exhibits one property but not the other. In &quot;Counterexamples in Topology&quot;, Steen and Seebach, together with five students in an undergraduate research project at St. Olaf College, Minnesota in the summer of 1967, canvassed the field of topology for such counterexamples and compiled them in an attempt to simplify the literature.

For instance, an example of a first-countable space which is not second-countable is counterexample #3, the discrete topology on an uncountable set. This particular counterexample shows that second-countability does not follow from first-countability.

Several other &quot;Counterexamples in ...&quot; books and papers have followed, with similar motivations.

==Reviews==
In her review of the first edition, Mary Ellen Rudin wrote:
:In other mathematical fields one restricts one&#x27;s problem by requiring that the space be Hausdorff or paracompact or metric, and usually one doesn&#x27;t really care which, so long as the restriction is strong enough to avoid this dense forest of counterexamples. A usable map of the forest is a fine thing...
In his submission to Mathematical Reviews C. Wayne Patty wrote:
:...the book is extremely useful, and the general topology student will no doubt find it very valuable. In addition it is very well written.
When the second edition appeared in 1978 its review in Advances in Mathematics treated topology as territory to be explored:
:Lebesgue once said that every mathematician should be something of a naturalist. This book, the updated journal of a continuing expedition to the never-never land of general topology, should appeal to the latent naturalist in every mathematician.

==Notation==
Several of the naming conventions in this book differ from more accepted modern conventions, particularly with respect to the separation axioms. The authors use the terms T3, T4, and T5 to refer to regular, normal, and completely normal. They also refer to completely Hausdorff as Urysohn. This was a result of the different historical development of metrization theory and general topology; see History of the separation axioms for more.

The long line in example 45 is what most topologists nowadays would call the &#x27;closed long ray&#x27;.

<doc id="915455" wikidata="Q1086874" url="?curid=915455" title="Christopher Newport">
<text>Christopher Newport ( – ) was an English seaman and privateer. He is best known as the captain of the &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, the largest of three ships which carried settlers for the Virginia Company in 1607 on the way to found the settlement at Jamestown in the Virginia Colony, which became the first permanent English settlement in North America. He was also in overall command of the other two ships on that initial voyage, in order of their size, the &quot;Godspeed&quot; and the &quot;Discovery&quot;.

He made several voyages of supply between England and Jamestown; in 1609, he became Captain of the Virginia Company&#x27;s new flagship, &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, which met a hurricane during the Third Supply mission and was shipwrecked on the archipelago of Bermuda.
Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia, was named in his honour.

==Early life==
Christopher Newport was born in Limehouse, an important trading port on the River Thames in December 1561. His father, also named Christopher Newport, was a shipmaster who worked in the commercial shipping trade on the east coast of England. The maiden name of his mother Jane is unknown. Newport was christened at the Anglican St. Nicholas Church in Harwich on 29 December. Newport went to sea in 1580, and he quickly rose to the rank of a master mariner and dealt with trade going into London. On 19 October 1584 he married Katherine Proctor in Harwich.

===Privateer===

From 1585 following the outbreak of the Anglo–Spanish War, Newport worked as a privateer who raided Spanish freighters off and on in the Caribbean. Over the years he commanded a series of privateer ships, including the &quot;Little John&quot;, the &quot;Margaret&quot;, and the &quot;Golden Dragon&quot;. In 1590, Newport participated in an expedition to the Caribbean, which was financed and organised by famed London merchant John Watts. On this voyage, Newport lost an arm during a fight to capture a Spanish galleon.

Despite his injury, Newport continued to conduct privateer raids for almost twenty years, working with Watts. His accomplishments during this period included a successful expedition off Cuba in 1591 and raided Hispaniola and the Bay of Hondruas. A few months later Newport assisted in the capture of the Portuguese ship &quot;Madre de Deus&quot; off the Azores in 1592. This prize yielded the greatest English plunder of the century, including five hundred tons of spices, silks, gemstones, and other treasures. Christopher Newport also sailed with Sir Francis Drake on Drake&#x27;s famous raid on Cadiz, Spain.

Back in the Caribbean Newport captured Tabasco in November 1599. An attempt to raid Spanish Jamaica in January 1603 ended in failure, after being repelled by militia under the command of Governor Fernando Melgarejo. A month later Newport conducted his last big raid of the war, raiding Puerto Caballos. He continued raiding the Caribbean until May taking an additional pair of Spanish prizes near Havana before heading back to England. The spoils from all these raids were shared with London merchants who funded them. By the time the war had ended in 1604 Newport had raided the Spanish Main more times than Francis Drake had.

In a peaceful mission to the Caribbean, he returned to England in late 1605 with two baby crocodiles and a wild boar. These he presented as gifts to King James I, who had a fascination with exotic animals.

==Jamestown==
It was Newport&#x27;s experience as well as his reputation which led to his hiring in 1606 by the Virginia Company of London. The company had been granted a proprietorship to establish a settlement in the Virginia Colony by King James I. Newport took charge of the ship &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, and on the 1606–1607 voyage, she carried 71 colonists, all male, one of whom was John Smith. As soon as land was in sight, sealed orders from the Virginia Company were opened which named Newport as a member of the governing Council of the Colony. On 29 April, Newport erected a cross at the mouth of the bay, at a place they named Cape Henry, to claim the land for the Crown. In the following days, the ships ventured inland upstream along the James River seeking a suitable location for their settlement as defined in their orders. Newport (accompanied by Smith) then explored the Powhatan Flu (River) up to the site of present-day Richmond (the Powhatan Flu would soon be called the James River), then a few weeks after arriving at Jamestown he was allowed to assume his seat on the council.

===First and Second Supply missions===
In June 1607, a week after the initial Fort at Jamestown was completed, Newport sailed back for London on the &quot;Susan Constant&quot; with a load of pyrite (&quot;fools&#x27; gold&quot;) and other supposedly precious minerals, leaving behind 104 colonists, and the tiny &quot;Discovery&quot; for the use of the colonists. The &quot;Susan Constant&quot;, which had been a rental ship that had customarily been used to transport freight, did not return to Virginia again. However, Newport did return twice from England with additional supplies in the following 18 months, leading what were termed the First and Second Supply missions. Despite original intentions to grow food and trade with the Native Americans, the barely surviving colonists became dependent upon the supply missions. Before the arrival of the First Supply, over half of the colonists perished in the winter of 1607–08.
The urgently needed First Supply mission arrived in Jamestown on 8 January 1608. The two ships under Newport&#x27;s command were the &quot;John and Francis&quot; and the &quot;Phoenix&quot;. However, despite replenishing the supplies, the two ships also brought an additional 120 men, so with the survivors of the initial group, there were now 158 colonists, as recorded later by John Smith. Accordingly, Newport left again for England almost immediately to obtain more supplies for the colonists. On this trip Newport took Powhatan&#x27;s tribesman Namontack to London, arriving on 10 April 1608. Namontack remained in London for three months and then returned to Virginia with Newport.

The Second Supply arrived in September 1608, this time with Newport commanding the &quot;Mary Margaret&quot;, a ship of about 150 tons. In addition to urgently needed supplies, the Second Supply delivered another 70 persons as well as the first two women from England, a &quot;gentlewoman&quot; and a woman servant. Realizing that Powhatan&#x27;s friendship was crucial to the survival of the small Jamestown colony, Newport was also ordered to &quot;crown&quot; the chief with a ceremonial crown to make him an English &quot;vassal.&quot; The coronation went badly however, because he stated he was already a king and refused to kneel to receive the crown. The need for another, ideally much larger, supply mission was conveyed to the leaders of the Virginia Company effectively when Newport returned to England. Additional funds and resources were gathered and readied. However, the Third Supply, as well as the company&#x27;s new purpose-built flagship, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, were each to become big problems for Jamestown.

===Third Supply: ill-fated &quot;Sea Venture&quot;===

Newport made a third trip to America in June 1609, as captain of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; and &quot;Vice Admiral&quot; of the Third Supply mission. Normally, ships destined for North America from Europe sailed south as far as the Canary Islands as at that latitude the mean direction of the wind is to the West, pushing them across the Atlantic (ships returning to Europe turned eastward at the Carolinas, as at that latitude the mean wind direction is to the East), then followed the chain of west Indian islands to Florida and from there followed the Atlantic coast of the continent. However, with the West Indies firmly in the grip of the Spanish Empire, the English fleet turned Northwards in the open Atlantic, intending to bypass the Spanish threat and head directly for Virginia. Days away from Jamestown, on 24 July, the nine ships encountered a massive three-day-long storm, and became separated. The flagship of the mission, the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;, being newly built for the voyage, was leaking heavily, having lost her caulking. Admiral Sir George Somers, who had taken the helm, deliberately drove her upon a reef in Bermuda to prevent her foundering. Eventually, in May 1610, the survivors (150 colonists and crew members, and one dog) constructed two smaller ships, the &quot;Deliverance&quot; and the &quot;Patience&quot;, from the wreck and the abundant native Bermuda cedar. Arriving at Jamestown 10 months later than planned, where the death of over 80% of the colonists had occurred during the Starving Time, Newport and the others had precious few supplies to share. Both groups felt they had no alternative but to return to England. On 7 June, they boarded the ships, and started to sail downstream and abandon Jamestown. However, as they approached Mulberry Island, they were met by a &#x27;fourth&quot; supply mission sailing upstream headed by a new governor, Thomas West, who ordered the remaining settlers to return.

On his last voyage to Jamestown in 1610, Newport brought John Rolfe. Rolfe would engineer a new kind of tobacco that would become the key to the colony&#x27;s eventual prosperity.

== Later voyages, death ==
On 12 May 1611 Newport arrived once again back at Jamestown, accompanied by Sir Thomas Dale, departing 20 August, for what would be his last time. In 1612, he joined the Royal Navy, accepting a commission first offered to him in 1606, and entered the English East India Company. In 1613, aboard the &quot;Expedition&quot;, Newport commanded the twelfth voyage of the company to the Far East. In 1615 he sailed to India. In November 1616 he wrote his will, and set out on his third voyage to the East Indies (this time accompanied by his son, also called Christopher, who joined the crew). By May 1617, he was in South Africa, but he died in Java (now part of Indonesia) sometime after 15 August 1617 of unknown causes.

== Legacy ==
* Newport, Kentucky, US was named in his honour.
* Newport News Point (where the mouth of the James River joins the harbour of Hampton Roads) and the city of Newport News, Virginia US, are believed to have been named after him, although this is disputed.
* Christopher Newport University, in Newport News, Virginia is named in honour of him.
** In 2007, a statue commemorating Captain Newport was unveiled at his namesake University. The statue has been the subject of some controversy, as it depicts Newport with both hands, while it is historically documented that Newport lost his entire right arm in 1590. The creator of the statue says, in an interview, that we should &quot;not remember our heroes as mutilated.&quot;
* The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honour.
* Captain Newport was portrayed by actors David Hemblen in &quot;&quot; in 1999 and Christopher Plummer in Terrence Malick&#x27;s 2005 film &quot;The New World&quot;, but did not appear in the 1995 Disney animated film or its 1998 direct-to-video sequel. In the Disney films, his role is replaced by the villainous Governor Ratcliffe.

<doc id="915459" wikidata="Q11443101" url="?curid=915459" title="Pirahã people">
<text>The Pirahã () are an indigenous people of the Amazon Rainforest in Brazil. They are the sole surviving subgroup of the Mura people, and are hunter-gatherers. They live mainly on the banks of the Maici River in Humaitá and Manicoré in the state of Amazonas. , they number 800 individuals. The name &quot;Pirahã&quot; is an exonym; the Pirahã call themselves the &#x27; or &#x27;, roughly translated as &quot;the straight ones&quot;.

The Pirahã speak the Pirahã language. They call any other language &quot;crooked head&quot;. Members of the Pirahã can whistle their language, which is how Pirahã men communicate when hunting in the jungle.

== Culture ==
According to the linguistic anthropologist and former Christian missionary Daniel Everett, The Pirahã are supremely gifted in all the ways necessary to ensure their continued survival in the jungle: they know the usefulness and location of all important plants in their area; they understand the behavior of local animals and how to catch and avoid them; and they can walk into the jungle naked, with no tools or weapons, and walk out three days later with baskets of fruit, nuts, and small game.

As far as the Pirahã have related to researchers, their culture is concerned solely with matters that fall within direct personal experience, and thus there is no history beyond living memory. Pirahã have a simple kinship system that includes &quot;baíxi&quot; (parent, grandparent, or elder), &quot;xahaigí&quot; (sibling, male or female), &quot;hoagí&quot; or &quot;hoísai&quot; (son), &quot;kai&quot; (daughter), and &quot;piihí&quot; (stepchild, favorite child, child with at least one deceased parent, and more).

Daniel Everett states that one of the strongest Pirahã values is no coercion; one does not tell other people what to do. There appears to be no social hierarchy; the Pirahã have no formal leaders. Their social system is similar to that of many other hunter-gatherer bands in the world, although rare in the Amazon because of a history of horticulture before Western contact (see history of the Amazon).

Although the Pirahã use canoes every day for fishing and for crossing the river beside which they live, when their canoes wear out, they use pieces of bark as temporary canoes. Everett brought in a master builder who taught and supervised the Pirahã in making a canoe, so that they could make their own. However, when they needed another canoe, they said that &quot;Pirahã do not make canoes&quot; and told Everett he should buy them a canoe. The Pirahã rely on neighboring communities&#x27; canoe work, and use those canoes for themselves.

Pirahã build simple huts where they keep a few pots, pans, knives, and machetes. They make only scraping implements (for making arrowheads), loosely woven palm-leaf bags, bows, and arrows. They take naps of 15 minutes to, at the most, two hours throughout the day and night, and rarely sleep through the night.

They do not store food in any quantity, but generally eat it when they get it. Pirahã have ignored lessons in preserving meats by salting or smoking. They cultivate manioc plants that grow from spit-out seeds and make only a few days&#x27; worth of manioc flour at a time. They trade Brazil nuts and sex for consumables or tools, e.g. machetes, gunpowder, powdered milk, sugar, whiskey. Chastity is not a cultural value. They trade Brazil nuts, wood, and &quot;sorva&quot; (rubbery sap used in chewing gum) for soda-can pull-tabs, which are used for necklaces. Men wear T-shirts and shorts that they get from traders; women sew their own plain cotton dresses.

Their decoration is mostly necklaces, used primarily to ward off spirits. The concept of drawing is alien to them and when asked to draw a person, animal, tree, or river, the result is simple lines. However, on seeing a novelty such as an airplane, a child may make a model of it, which may be soon discarded.

According to Everett, the Pirahã have no concept of a supreme spirit or god; however, they do believe in spirits that can sometimes take on the shape of things in the environment. These spirits can be jaguars, trees, or other visible, tangible things including people. Everett reported one incident where the Pirahã said that &quot;&quot;Xigagaí&quot;, one of the beings that lives above the clouds, was standing on a beach yelling at us, telling us that he would kill us if we go into the jungle.&quot; Everett and his daughter could see nothing and yet the Pirahã insisted that &quot;Xigagaí&quot; was still on the beach.

===Adoption of Western culture===
A 2012 documentary called &quot;The Grammar of Happiness&quot;, which aired on the Smithsonian Channel, reported that a school had been opened for the Pirahã community where they learn Portuguese and mathematics. According to FUNAI the school is the responsibility of the Ministry of Education of Brazil. In addition to a formal school being introduced to the culture, the documentary also reported that the Brazilian government installed a modern medical clinic, electricity and television in the remote area.

== Language ==

Anthropological linguist Daniel Everett, who wrote the first Pirahã grammar, claims that there are related pairs of curiosities in their language and culture.

After working with the language for 30 years, Everett states that it has no relative clauses or grammatical recursion. Everett points out that there is recursion of ideas: that in a story, there may be subordinate ideas inside other ideas. He also pointed out that different experts have different definitions of recursion. If the language lacks grammatical recursion, then it is proposed as a counterexample to the theory proposed by Chomsky, Hauser and Fitch (2002) that recursion is a feature which all human languages must have.

Pirahã is perhaps second only to Rotokas in New Guinea for the distinction of having the fewest phonemes of any of the world&#x27;s languages. Women sometimes pronounce &quot;s&quot; as &quot;h&quot;, reducing the inventory further still. Everett states that Pirahã, Rotokas, and Hawaiian each have 11 phonemes.

Their language is a unique living language (it is related to Mura, which is no longer spoken). John Colapinto explains, &quot;Unrelated to any other extant tongue, and based on just eight consonants and three vowels, Pirahã has one of the simplest sound systems known. Yet it possesses such a complex array of tones, stresses, and syllable lengths that its speakers can dispense with their vowels and consonants altogether and sing, hum, or whistle conversations.&quot; Peter Gordon writes that the language has a very complex verb structure: &quot;To the verb stem are appended up to 15 potential slots for morphological markers that encode aspectual notions such as whether events were witnessed, whether the speaker is certain of its occurrence, whether it is desired, whether it was proximal or distal, and so on. None of the markers encode features such as person, number, tense or gender.&quot;

Curiously, although not unprecedentedly, the language has no cardinal or ordinal numbers. Some researchers, such as Peter Gordon of Columbia University, claim that the Pirahã are incapable of learning numeracy. His colleague, Daniel L. Everett, on the other hand, argues that the Pirahã are cognitively capable of counting; they simply choose not to do so. They believe that their culture is complete and does not need anything from outside cultures. Everett says, &quot;The crucial thing is that the Pirahã have not borrowed any numbers—and they want to learn to count. They asked me to give them classes in Brazilian numbers, so for eight months I spent an hour every night trying to teach them how to count. And it never got anywhere, except for a few of the children. Some of the children learned to do reasonably well, but as soon as anybody started to perform well, they were sent away from the classes. It was just a fun time to eat popcorn and watch me write things on the board.&quot;

The language does not have words for precise numbers, but rather concepts for a small amount and a larger amount.

The language may have no unique words for colors, contradicting Berlin and Kay&#x27;s hypothesis on the . There are no unanalyzable root words for color; the recorded color words are all compounds like &quot;mii sai&quot; or &quot;bii sai&quot;, &quot;blood-like&quot;, indicating that colors in the language are adjectival comparisons that are not consistently applied.

It is suspected that the language&#x27;s entire pronoun set was recently borrowed from one of the Tupí–Guaraní languages, and that before that the language may have had no pronouns whatsoever. Many linguists, however, find this claim questionable due to lack of evidence. However, if there had been pronouns at an earlier stage of Pirahã, this would not affect Everett&#x27;s claim of the significance of the system&#x27;s simplicity today. There are few Tupi–Guaraní loanwords in areas of the lexicon more susceptible to borrowing (such as nouns referring to cultural items, for instance).

<text>The Pilatus P-3 was a military training aircraft built by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland.

==Design and development==
The Pilatus P-3 was designed for primary and advanced training (including night flying, aerobatics and instrument flying). The military versions were designated P-3-03 to P-3-05. It was of all-metal construction with a retractable tricycle undercarriage and tandem seating. There was provision for underwing racks for light practice bombs or rockets and a machine gun in a pod below the port wing. Although such kits were purchased, they were never used.

==Operational history==

The first prototype P-3.01 was built in 1953 and flew on 3 September the same year with a two-blade propeller. The power of the engine of the aircraft proved to be insufficient. A second prototype to become the military prototype flew in August, 1954, now equipped with a different engine and a three blade propeller. During the evaluation of the military prototype, now designated P-3.02 (HB-HOO, becoming A-801 in January 1956), the aircraft had to perform against a T-34 Mentor that had been brought to Switzerland. The test pilot at the demonstration flight went to the limits and flew a standing &quot;8&quot;, knowing, the Mentor would not be able to fly this manoeuvre. After the acceptance by the Swiss Air Force, the service received a pre-series of 12 aircraft type P-3.03 (A-802-A-813). Six additional examples were built and flew with civilian markings, those P-3.04 were later acquired by the Brazilian Navy. The Swiss Air Force then purchased 60 airframes of the type P-3.05 (A-814-A-873) and used their P-3s as a training aircraft until 1983, although it continued to be used as a liaison aircraft for another decade. In 1993–1995, 65 ex-Swiss Air Force aircraft were sold on the private market.

After two crashes resulting from an aircraft going into a flat spin, the aircraft A-858 received a ventral fin. After successful testing, all swiss P-3 received the fin.

The prototype P-3.01 HB-HON was used by Pilatus&#x27; sister company Contraves as a target tug before returning to Pilatus to become the prototype of the PC-7 in 1966.

==Operators==

<doc id="915472" wikidata="Q2363719" url="?curid=915472" title="Asymptotic curve">
<text>In the differential geometry of surfaces, an asymptotic curve is a curve always tangent to an asymptotic direction of the surface (where they exist). It is sometimes called an asymptotic line, although it need not be a line. 

==Definitions==
There are several equivalent definitions for asymptotic directions, or equivalently, asymptotic curves.

* The asymptotic directions are the same as the asymptotes of the hyperbola of the Dupin indicatrix through a hyperbolic point, or the unique asymptote through a parabolic point.

* An asymptotic direction is a direction along which the normal curvature is zero: take the plane spanned by the direction and the surface&#x27;s normal at that point. The curve of intersection of the plane and the surface has zero curvature at that point.
* An asymptotic curve is a curve such that, at each point, the plane tangent to the surface is an osculating plane of the curve.

== Properties ==
Asymptotic directions can only occur when the Gaussian curvature is negative (or zero). 

There are two asymptotic directions through every point with negative Gaussian curvature, bisected by the principal directions. There is one or infinitely many asymptotic directions through every point with zero Gaussian curvature. 

If the surface is minimal and not flat, then the asymptotic directions are orthogonal to one another (and 45 degrees with the two principal directions). 

For a developable surface, the asymptotic lines are the generatrices, and them only. 

If a straight line is included in a surface, then it is an asymptotic curve of the surface.

==Related notions==
A related notion is a curvature line, which is a curve always tangent to a principal direction.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Nebraska (in case citations, D. Neb.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction is the state of Nebraska. Court offices are in Omaha and Lincoln.

Appeals from the District of Nebraska are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Nebraska represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. As of August 17, 2024, the United States attorney is Susan T. Lehr, beginning on July 1, 2023.

== Notable case ==

In May 2005, Judge Joseph Bataillon struck down a constitutional amendment passed by Nebraska voters in 2000 that would have banned gay marriages. That decision, however, was reversed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In its opinion issued on July 14, 2006, the Eighth Circuit held: the amendment rationally related to legitimate state interests, and therefore did not violate the Equal Protection Clause; the amendment could not be considered a bill of attainder; the amendment did not violate homosexuals&#x27; First Amendment right to associate; and the amendment did not violate homosexuals&#x27; First Amendment right to petition the government for redress of grievances.

<doc id="915483" wikidata="Q982977" url="?curid=915483" title="Innocent of Alaska">
<text>Innocent of Alaska (; August 26, 1797 – ), also known as Innocent Metropolitan of Moscow, was a Russian Orthodox missionary priest, then the first Orthodox bishop and archbishop in the Americas, and finally the Metropolitan of Moscow and Kolomna. Remembered for his missionary work, scholarship, and leadership in Alaska and the Russian Far East during the 19th century, he is known for his abilities as a scholar, linguist, and administrator, as well as his great zeal for his work.

As a missionary priest he took his wife and family with him. In these territories he learned several languages and dialects of the indigenous peoples. He wrote many of the earliest scholarly works about the native peoples of Alaska, including dictionaries and grammars for their languages for which he devised writing systems; also, he wrote religious works in, and translated parts of the Bible into, several of these languages. His books were published beginning in 1840.

==Early life and education==
Innocent was born Ivan Evseyevich Popov (Иван Евсеевич Попов) on August 26, 1797, into the family of a church server in the village of Anginskoye, Verkholensk District, Irkutsk Governorate, in Russia. His father, Evsey Popov, died when Ivan was six, and Ivan lived with his uncle, the parish deacon, in Anga.

In 1807 at age 10, Ivan entered the Irkutsk Theological Seminary, where the rector renamed him Veniaminov in honor of the recently deceased Bishop Veniamin of Irkutsk.

In 1817 he married a local priest&#x27;s daughter named Catherine. On May 18 that year Ivan Veniaminov was ordained a deacon of the Church of the Annunciation in Irkutsk.

After completing his studies in 1818, Veniaminov was appointed a teacher in a parish school. On May 18, 1821 he was ordained a priest to serve in the Church of the Annunciation in Irkutsk. In Russian he was known as Father &quot;Ioann,&quot; the religious version of Ivan.

==Ministry in Alaska==
At the beginning of 1823, Bishop Michael of Irkutsk received instructions to send a priest to the island of Unalaska in the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Father Ioann Veniaminov volunteered to go and on May 7, 1823, he departed from Irkutsk, accompanied by his aging mother, his brother Stefan, his wife, and their son, Innocent, an infant. After a difficult yearlong journey by land and water, they arrived at Unalaska on July 29, 1824.

After Father Ioann and his family built and moved into an earthen hut, he set about studying the local languages and dialects. He trained some of his new parishioners in Russian building techniques. With them he undertook the construction of Holy Ascension Church, which was finished the following July.
Father Ioann&#x27;s parish included the island of Unalaska and the neighboring groups of Fox and Pribilof islands, occupied by indigenous people who had been converted to Christianity before his arrival. They also retained many of their earlier religious beliefs and customs. Father Ioann often traveled between the islands in a canoe, battling the stormy ocean in the Gulf of Alaska.

By his travels through the islands, Father Ioann Veniaminov became familiar with the local dialects. In a short time he mastered six of the dialects. He devised an alphabet using Cyrillic letters for the most widely used dialect, the Unangan dialect of Aleut. In 1828, he translated portions of the Bible and other church material into that dialect. In 1829, he journeyed to the Bering Sea coast of the Alaskan mainland and preached to the people there.

In 1834, Father Ioann was transferred to Sitka Island, to the town of Novoarkhangelsk, later called Sitka. He devoted himself to the Tlingit people and studied their language and customs. From his studies there, he wrote the scholarly works &quot;Notes on the Kolushchan and Kodiak Tongues&quot; and &quot;Other Dialects of the Russo-American Territories, with a Russian-Kolushchan Glossary&quot;.

In 1836, Father Veniaminov made the journey south on a pastoral tour of the southernmost extent of Russian America, landing at Fort Ross in Northern California. While there he conducted a census and performed the sacraments of marriage and baptism for the Russian population and local natives.

==Kamchatka ministry==

In 1838, Father Ioann journeyed to St. Petersburg (where on Christmas Day 1839 he was promoted to archpriest), Moscow and Kiev to report on his activities and request an expansion of the Church&#x27;s activities in Russian America. While he was there, he received notice that his wife had died during her visit to Irkutsk. He requested permission to return to his hometown. Instead, church officials suggested that he take vows as a monk. Father Ioann at first ignored these suggestions, but, on November 29, 1840, he was tonsured a monk with the name &quot;Innocent&quot; in honor of Saint Innocent, the first bishop of Irkutsk (†1731, commemorated on November 26). He was elevated to the rank of Archimandrite.

On December 15, 1840, Archimandrite Innocent was consecrated Bishop of Kamchatka and Kuril Islands in Russia and the Aleutian Islands in Russian America. His see was located in Novoarkhangelsk (Sitka), to which he returned in September 1841. He spent the next nine years administering his diocese as well as taking several long missionary journeys to its remote areas.

On April 21, 1850, Bishop Innocent was elevated to archbishop. In 1852 the Yakut area was admitted to the Kamchatka Diocese. In September 1853 Archbishop Innocent took up permanent residence in the town of Yakutsk. Innocent took frequent trips throughout his enlarged diocese. He devoted much energy to the translation of the scriptures and service books into the Yakut (Sakha) language.

In April 1865 Archbishop Innocent was appointed a member of the Holy Governing Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church.

==Metropolitan of Moscow==
On November 19, 1867, he was appointed the Metropolitan of Moscow, succeeding his friend and mentor, Filaret, who had died. As metropolitan, he undertook revisions of many church texts that contained errors, raised funds to improve the living conditions of impoverished priests, and established a retirement home for clergy.

==Death and legacy==

Innocent died on March 31, 1879. He was buried on April 5, 1879, at Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra, outside Moscow.

== Sainthood ==
On the Russian Orthodox Church, acting on the official request of the Orthodox Church in America, glorified (canonized) Innocent as a saint, giving him the title &quot;Enlightener of the Aleuts, Apostle to America.&quot;

Innocent&#x27;s feast day is celebrated by the Orthodox Church three times a year: March 31, the date of his repose according to the Julian Calendar (April 13 N.S.); October 6, the anniversary of his canonization (September 23 O.S.); and October 18, the Synaxis of the Moscow Hierarchs (October 5 O.S.).

Innocent is widely venerated with the epithet Equal-to-apostles
as the Orthodox apostle of America.

On the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA), Innocent is honored with a feast day on March 30.

<text>The Gun in Betty Lou&#x27;s Handbag is a 1992 American screwball comedy film directed by Allan Moyle and produced by Scott Kroopf. It stars Penelope Ann Miller, Eric Thal, William Forsythe, Cathy Moriarty and Alfre Woodard. Rock and roll recording pioneer Cordell Jackson played a bit part as &quot;Bathroom Woman&quot;.

The film was distributed by Touchstone Pictures for Interscope Communications.

==Plot==
Betty Lou Perkins is a meek librarian in New Orleans who nobody pays much attention to, in particular her husband, Alex. A criminal kingpin is killed in cold blood, and Betty Lou happens to find the murder gun. She is so mousy, however, that she cannot even get the police to listen to her, including Alex, who is a detective. In sheer frustration, she not only produces the gun, but also announces that she is the one who committed the crime.

Behind bars, Betty Lou meets a variety of hardened and colorful characters. Rather than intimidate her, they actually increase her self-confidence. Once she is released, she begins to dress, speak, and act differently. Unfortunately for her, criminal acquaintances of the victim assume she must have confessed to the murder for a reason. They conclude she must be his mistress, and soon, the bad guys want a few words with her ... or worse.

&quot;The Gun in Betty Lou&#x27;s Handbag&quot; received generally negative reviews from critics. It holds a 14% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, reviewing the film when it was released in home video, gave the film a D+, and called it a &quot;foolish farce&quot;. The British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; gave it three stars out of five, calling it &quot;watchable&quot; and noting that &quot;Miller is a winning heroine&quot;, but characterizing the film as &quot;too busy to be really funny&quot;. &quot;The Austin Chronicle&quot; gave it two stars: &quot;The cast shines in &quot;The Gun in Betty Lou&#x27;s Handbag&quot;; watching these performers, you know this movie would have made for an inspired farce, given better writing and direction.&quot;

==Home media==
The film was released on DVD by Touchstone Home Entertainment on September 2, 2003, and on Blu-ray by Mill Creek Entertainment in May 2011.

<doc id="915488" wikidata="Q7889786" url="?curid=915488" title="United States District Court for the District of Oregon">
<text>The United States District Court for the District of Oregon (in case citations, D. Ore. or D. Or.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction comprises the state of Oregon. It was created in 1859 when the state was admitted to the Union. Appellate jurisdiction belongs to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit). Matthew P. Deady served as its first judge.

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Oregon represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. , the United States attorney is William Narus.

== Organization ==
The court has four divisional offices within the state (three with staff): Portland, Eugene, Medford, and Pendleton. The Portland Division holds court at the Mark O. Hatfield United States Courthouse and handles cases from Clackamas, Clatsop, Columbia, Hood River, Jefferson, Multnomah, Polk, Tillamook, Wasco, Washington, and Yamhill Counties. The Medford Division meets at the James A. Redden United States Courthouse and handles cases from Curry, Jackson, Josephine, Klamath and Lake Counties. The Pendleton Division holds session at John F. Kilkenny United States Post Office and Courthouse and covers cases from Baker, Crook, Gilliam, Grant, Harney, Malheur, Morrow, Sherman, Umatilla, Union, Wallowa and Wheeler Counties. The Wayne L. Morse United States Courthouse houses the Eugene Division that handles cases from Benton, Coos, Deschutes, Douglas, Lane, Lincoln, Linn, and Marion Counties.

== History ==
After Oregon became a state on February 14, 1859, the United States Congress created the District of Oregon encompassing the entire state on March 3, 1859. The bill creating the district authorized a single judge and also designated it as a judicial circuit. President James Buchanan appointed Matthew Deady as judge, and the court was to hold annual sessions in April and September at the seat of government in Salem. Deady held the first session of the court on September 12, 1859, in Salem, but was able to have the court relocated to Portland by the September session of 1860. Beginning in 1933, the court was housed in the United States Courthouse (now Gus J. Solomon United States Courthouse) before moving to the new Hatfield Courthouse in 1997.

On March 3, 1863, Congress passed a law that removed the circuit court jurisdiction and transferred appeals court jurisdiction to the Tenth Circuit, and in 1866 transferred it again to the Ninth Circuit. On April 18, 1877, court clerk Ralph Wilcox committed suicide in his office at the court using a Deringer pistol. On March 27, 1885, Judge Deady admitted Mary Leonard to the federal bar, the first woman admitted in Oregon. In 1909, Congress added another seat to the court, followed by another judgeship in 1949. On October 20, 1978, Congress passed a law authorizing two more positions on the bench of the Oregon district court. The first woman to serve on the court was Helen J. Frye, whose service began on February 20, 1980. In 1990, Congress added a sixth judgeship for the district. Ancer L. Haggerty, the first African American on the court, began his service on March 28, 1994.

<text>The Kern County child abuse cases started the day care sexual abuse hysteria of the 1980s in Kern County, California. The cases involved allegations of satanic ritual abuse by a sex ring against as many as 60 children who testified they had been abused. At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years in prison. Thirty-four convictions were overturned on appeal. The district attorney responsible for the convictions was Ed Jagels, who was sued by at least one of those whose conviction was overturned, and who remained in office until 2009. Two of the convicted individuals were unable to prove their innocence because they died in prison.

==History==
In 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan&#x27;s two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a &quot;sex ring&quot; that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens&#x27; two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted in 1984 and given a combined sentence of more than 1000 years in prison. In 1996 the convictions were overturned and the two couples were released. A television movie about the Kniffens titled &quot;Just Ask My Children&quot; was broadcast on Lifetime in 2001.

Six similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution&#x27;s evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group—40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. &quot;It never happened,&quot; Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was overturned. In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation. The county paid nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims. A documentary titled &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;, which emphasized primarily Stoll&#x27;s case, was produced and released in 2007. MSNBC also made a documentary concerning John Stoll and the Kern County cases.

In 2004 Sampley and three other former accusers returned to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said they always knew that Stoll had never touched them. However, Stoll&#x27;s son has &quot;continued to say that he had been molested.&quot; In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll&#x27;s pool house briefly. John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released due to the new testimony. Self was sent to a mental hospital for sexual offenders because he had two prior convictions for child molestation. Self was freed in 2009. He was re-arrested in 2012 on suspicion of child molestation in Oregon. In July 2013, Self pleaded guilty to sexually abusing three young boys and was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison.

Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that emphasized satanic ritual abuse as a major element of child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir &quot;Michelle Remembers&quot; as training material.

<text>The name Robert is an ancient Germanic given name, from Proto-Germanic &quot;fame&quot; and &quot;bright&quot; (&quot;Hrōþiberhtaz&quot;). Compare Old Dutch &quot;Robrecht&quot; and Old High German &quot;Hrodebert&quot; (a compound of &quot;Hruod&quot; () &quot;fame, glory, honour, praise, renown, godlike&quot; and &quot;berht&quot; &quot;bright, light, shining&quot;). It is the second most frequently used given name of ancient Germanic origin. It is also in use as a surname. Another commonly used form of the name is Rupert.

After becoming widely used in Continental Europe, the name entered England in its Old French form &quot;Robert&quot;, where an Old English cognate form (&quot;Hrēodbēorht&quot;, &quot;Hrodberht&quot;, &quot;Hrēodbēorð&quot;, &quot;Hrœdbœrð&quot;, &quot;Hrœdberð&quot;, &quot;Hrōðberχtŕ&quot;) had existed before the Norman Conquest. The feminine version is Roberta. The Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish form is Roberto.

Robert is also a common name in many Germanic languages, including English, German, Dutch, Norwegian, Swedish, Scots, Danish, and Icelandic. It can be used as a French, Polish, Irish, Finnish, Romanian, and Estonian name as well.

==Popularity and trivia==

The name &quot;Robert&quot; was a royal name in France, Germany, Scotland and England during the medieval period, and was the name of several kings, dukes, and other rulers and noblemen. It was one of the most popular male names in medieval Europe, likely due to its frequent usage amongst royalty and nobility. To this day, &quot;Robert&quot; remains one of the most frequently given male names.

&quot;Robert&quot; was in the top 10 most given boys&#x27; names in the United States for 47 years, from 1925 to 1972. While some names become less frequently used due to negative associations, &quot;Robert&quot; is still widely used despite its connection to many negatively evaluated historical figures.

It is the fourth most common name in the United States, according to 100 years of Social Security Administration naming and mortality data. There are 3,085,000 males and 13,571 females with this name, for a total of 3,098,571 people with this name.

In Italy during the Second World War, the form Roberto briefly acquired a new meaning derived from, and referring to the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo Axis.

The name&#x27;s second component, &quot;*berhta-&quot;, is the original root for the modern English word &quot;bright&quot;.

<text>Andrew James Hoy, (born 8 February 1959) is an Australian equestrian rider. He has won six Olympic medals: three gold, two silvers and one bronze. He has competed in eight Olympic games, from 1984 to 2020 with the exception of 2008,[] which is an Australian record; and at the 2020 Summer Olympics he was 62 years old, making him Australia&#x27;s oldest ever male Olympian. After winning two medals in Tokyo, he did not rule out trying for future Olympic teams.

Hoy is based in Leicestershire, in the United Kingdom with his team. He has been living in the UK since 1993.

Hoy was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2000.

== Early years ==
Andrew Hoy was born in Culcairn, NSW, and spent his earlier years there. He started riding when only six-years-old. The rest of his life has been spent around horses. In 1978, he moved to England to train and now lives there.

Hoy participated in his first International Championships at the age of 19 where he represented Australia at the 1978 World Championships in Kentucky. A year later, he won his first CCI4* competition.

<doc id="915495" wikidata="Q3483340" url="?curid=915495" title="Sidney Spivak">
<text>Sidney Joel Spivak, (May 23, 1928 – July 8, 2002) was a Manitoba politician. He was a Cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin, Walter Weir and Sterling Lyon, and was himself leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba (PCs) from 1971 to 1975.

Spivak was born to Jewish parents, Malick and Rose Spivak, in Winnipeg, and was educated at the University of Manitoba and Harvard University. He worked as a barrister and became Vice-President of Golden Age Beverages Limited and Mathers Investments Limited as well. In 1955, Spivak married Mira Steele; they had three children together. He was named Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1966.

Spivak was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1966 provincial election, in the riding of River Heights, which was then in far southwest Winnipeg. A Progressive Conservative, Spivak was appointed Minister of Industry and Commerce in Dufferin Roblin&#x27;s government. He continued to hold this position after Walter Weir became premier in 1967.

Weir&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives were defeated in the 1969 election, although Spivak was easily re-elected in his own riding. Two years later, he defeated Harry Enns by 46 votes to become the party&#x27;s leader.

Ideologically, Spivak was a Red Tory (on the left of the party). He represented an urban and progressive wing within the party, and did not have the complete confidence of his caucus, which was dominated by more right-wing figures. In the 1973 election, Spivak presented himself as being to the right of Premier Edward Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats, but to the left of the Liberals under Israel Asper. He specifically rejected Asper&#x27;s laissez-faire economic policies, and promised to govern as a centrist.

The Progressive Conservatives won 21 seats in the 1973 election, up one from their position at the dissolution of the assembly. Schreyer&#x27;s New Democrats, however, were re-elected with a majority, and many PC members blamed Spivak for the party&#x27;s loss. (Some have suggested that the Tory defeat was due in part to antisemitism. This interpretation has never been verified, however, and has been rejected by some prominent Jewish figures in Manitoba.)

In 1975, former minister Sterling Lyon, who had not held office since 1969 at that point, challenged Spivak for the Progressive Conservative leadership. This challenge was extremely divisive, pitting Spivak&#x27;s left-leaning ideology against Lyon&#x27;s conservatism and dividing the PC membership accordingly. There have also been suggestions that some of Lyon&#x27;s supporters conducted an antisemitic &quot;whispering campaign&quot; against Spivak, suggesting that the party would be unable to form government under a Jewish leader. Lyon, however, had several prominent Jews on his leadership campaign team.

When the delegates gathered on December 6, Lyon defeated Spivak by 57 votes. Shortly after the vote, Spivak claimed that the party would have difficulty being elected on a right-wing platform. Lyon led the PCs to victory at the 1977 election, however, and Spivak was appointed as a Minister without Portfolio in the Lyon cabinet (also becoming co-chair of a Task Force on Government Organization and Economy). On October 20, 1978, he became the Minister of Government Services.

Spivak resigned from the Manitoba legislature in 1979. He ran for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the federal riding of Winnipeg—Fort Garry in that year&#x27;s federal election. He lost to Liberal Lloyd Axworthy, later a high-ranking federal cabinet minister, by 485 out of 45,757 votes.

After his defeat in the 1979 federal election, Spivak did not seek further elected office and returned to business full-time. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, he served as chair of the Canada-Israel Committee; this organization opposed the Oslo Peace Accord of 1993, although Spivak himself was subsequently a promoter of peace in the Middle East. He also served on the Churchill Regional Health Authority Board in the late 1990s. Spivak wanted to be appointed Lieutenant Governor of Manitoba in 1993 (he would have succeeded George Johnson, his former ministerial colleague in the Roblin and Weir governments), but Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, through Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn, appointed Yvon Dumont instead.

He served on the board of governors of the University of Manitoba and on the board of directors for the Saint Boniface Hospital.

Sidney Spivak died of a heart attack in Winnipeg in 2002. His widow Mira Spivak was a member of the Senate of Canada from Manitoba from 1986 until she took mandatory retirement on her seventy-fifth birthday in 2009.

<text>Bettina Hoy (born Bettina Overesch: November 7, 1962) is an Olympic-level equestrian rider who competes for Germany in Eventing competitions. Bettina competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics, 1996 Summer Olympics, and 2004 Summer Olympics.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, held in Athens, Hoy competed in the three-day eventing competition, both as an individual rider and as part of the German team.

After the dressage and cross-country stages, Nicolas Touzaint was leading the field on the third day, Hoy was in second place, France was leading the team event, with Germany in second place as well. In the first round of show jumping, the third and final event, Hoy (the final jumper for the German team, as the best placed German rider) did not knock any fences down. However, Hoy had crossed the start line twice and was awarded 14 time penalties. After Hoy had crossed the start line the first time, the time clock had restarted and Hoy had thought she had the option of circling around again before starting her show jumping round.

The German team protested the time penalties to the appeals panel of the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), stating that Hoy could not have known her real time as the clock did not show her true time and that she could have ridden harder to avoid the time penalties. The decision to add the time penalties were reversed, with team gold being awarded to Germany and the individual gold to Hoy.

However, the British, French and American teams subsequently appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), arguing that the FEI was wrong to remove Hoy&#x27;s time penalties from her final result. The CAS&#x27; verdict was that the FEI appeals panel had overstated their jurisdiction in removing the time penalties. The CAS also stated that its decision was not based on any matters of FEI-rules, just on formal jurisdictional reasons. As a result, Hoy and the German team lost their gold medals, Germany getting placed 4th, Hoy 9th. Britain&#x27;s Leslie Law received the individual gold medal, America&#x27;s Kimberly Severson the silver and Britain&#x27;s Pippa Funnell the bronze, Nicolas Touzaint finished 8th. In the team event, France won the gold, Britain the silver and America the bronze.

<text>The Dorset Cursus is a Neolithic cursus monument that spans across 10 km (6¼ miles) of the chalk downland of Cranborne Chase in east Dorset, United Kingdom. Its extreme length makes it a notable example of this class of linear earthwork; it is better interpreted as a pair of same-length cursus constructed end to end, with the more southerly cursus (the Gussage Cursus) pre-dating the northerly one (the Pentridge Cursus).

==Context==
Very little remains above ground of the Dorset Cursus, which once stretched for 10 km (6¼ miles) through the undulating chalkland of Cranborne Chase in east Dorset, from Martin Down to Thickthorn Down (both near the A354 road). It is by far the largest example of this class of ancient monument: it is over three times longer than the archetypical Great Cursus near Stonehenge. Most of the current knowledge about the course of this ancient earthwork comes from aerial photography (where its course can be seen as cropmarks or soil marks) and other geophysical surveying techniques. However, there are a few locations (mentioned below) where the banks, much reduced in size, are still visible; the best-preserved earthworks are those of the southwestern terminal on Thickthorn Down ().
The Cursus dates from 3300 BCE which makes it contemporary with the earthen long barrows on Cranborne Chase: many of these are found near, on, or within the Cursus and since they are still in existence they help trace the Cursus&#x27; course in the modern landscape. The relationship between the Cursus and the alignment of these barrows suggests that they had a common ritual significance to the Neolithic people who spent an estimated 0.5 million worker-hours in its construction.


==Physical details==
The Cursus consisted of a pair of parallel banks (1.5 m tall) running about 82 m apart, with external ditches 1.5 m deep and 2 m wide. One bank is regular, whilst the other meanders, suggesting that the former was laid out first and the latter was dug using the former as a reference. The remains of these banks are still visible within Salisbury Plantation on Oakley Down, where a long barrow is built into the northwest bank (). A 250 m length of the south-east bank remains on the northeast-facing slope of Bottlebush Down (, at right angles to the B3081 road). These banks were linked together by cross-banks at the terminals; of these only the southwestern terminal bank on Thickthorn Down remains (), the north-eastern terminal on Martin Down () has been removed by centuries of ploughing.
The overall orientation of the Cursus is northeast–southwest; it does not follow a perfectly straight line between its terminals, but consists of several straight sections (of varying lengths) with abrupt but small changes in direction. It is believed that the cursus was built in two separate phases. First the southwesterly section from Thickthorn Down to Bottlebush Down, sometimes referred to as the Gussage Cursus. This was later extended another northeast, from Bottlebush Down to the terminal on Martin Down.

The quasi-linear course of the Cursus means that it ignores topographical features of the landscape. It is by no means flat, and there is also no overall &#x27;downhill&#x27; direction. In fact the vertical profile of the Gussage Cursus is quite symmetric: it has the ridge of Gussage Down in the middle, with river valleys on either side and the terminals near the summits of the neighbouring ridges. The later Pentridge Cursus has one steep valley crossing (between Bottlebush Down and Salisbury Plantation) and beyond that it stops traversing the contours and follows them instead, gently undulating its way towards the terminal on Martin Down.

==Interpretation==

In the absence of any evidence for a more mundane purpose, it is assumed that the Cursus served a religious or ceremonial function. There is considerable speculation about the links between the &#x27;ritual landscape&#x27; and the course of the Cursus. The Cursus&#x27; only significant astronomical alignment is related to its southwesterly orientation: an observer at the Gussage Cursus terminal on Bottlebush Down would see the midwinter sun set behind the long barrow lying across the Cursus on the ridge of Gussage Down. It has been suggested that any processions along the Cursus would take place from the Martin Down terminal in a southwesterly direction for maximum visual impact (of natural and artificial features) along the route.

Archaeological excavation of the eastern ditch indicated that it was permitted to silt up rapidly and may therefore have fallen out of use quite soon after being built before being re-appropriated by later peoples. Later Bronze Age sites such as the barrow cemeteries on Oakley and Wyke Downs appear to have respected the presence of the Cursus. This is in contrast to the Roman engineers who built the Ackling Dyke road across the middle of the cursus on Wyke Down, and also cut across the barrows in the Oakley Down cemetery.

<text>Land of the Dead (also known as George A. Romero&#x27;s Land of the Dead) is a 2005 post-apocalyptic horror film written and directed by George A. Romero; the fourth of Romero&#x27;s six &quot;Living Dead&quot; movies, it is preceded by &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, and succeeded by &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot; and &quot;Survival of the Dead&quot;. It was released in 2005, with a budget of $15–19 million, the highest in Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dead&quot; series, and grossed $46 million.

The story of &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; deals with a zombie assault on Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where a feudal-like government exists. The survivors in the film have fled to the Golden Triangle area of downtown Pittsburgh, protected on two sides by rivers and on the third by an electric barricade termed &quot;the Throat&quot;. Released in North America on June 24, 2005, &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; received mostly positive reviews from film critics.

== Plot ==
Years after the zombie apocalypse, the scattered remnants of human civilization have established a chain of protected city-states across North America. One such sanctuary is located in downtown Pittsburgh, ruled by a feudal-like government. Bordered on two sides by rivers and barricaded on the third with an electrified fence guarded by a militia, the city has become a relatively secure haven. Outside the city&#x27;s barriers are barren countryside and dilapidated suburban towns long deserted by humans but overrun with numerous zombies. The rich and powerful live in a luxury high-rise called &quot;Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot;, while the rest of the population subsists in squalor. All forms of commerce within this protected zone are controlled by Paul Kaufman, the city&#x27;s ruthless plutocratic ruler who owns &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;, an armored personnel vehicle that can easily travel through zombie-infested areas.

Riley Denbo, &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;″s designer and commander, and his crew pilot the vehicle into the no-man&#x27;s-land to scavenge for necessary food and medical supplies for the citizens as well as luxury items to use as a means of barter within Kaufman&#x27;s oppressive oligarchic regime. On one mission, they notice many zombies exhibiting intelligent behavior, especially former gas station attendant &quot;Big Daddy&quot;. During the mission, rookie Mike is bitten by a zombie and commits suicide before he turns.

After the mission, Riley retires from commanding &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;. Weary of a marginal existence in a post-apocalyptic city, he plans to depart for Canada once repairs on his car are finished. Back in the city, he discovers his car missing and he visits a pimp named Chihuahua, whose men were supposed to be fixing it. At Chihuahua&#x27;s joint, he sees a prostitute named Slack being forced into a cage with some zombies to entertain guests. Riley and his best friend Charlie Houk rescue Slack; after Charlie kills Chihuahua in the ensuing chaos, the trio are arrested. Slack reveals that Kaufman ordered her execution for assisting a resistance leader named Mulligan.

Meanwhile, Cholo DeMora, &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;″s second in command, is denied an apartment in Fiddler&#x27;s Green despite assisting Kaufman in eradicating his political enemies. Cholo commandeers the vehicle and threatens to destroy Fiddler&#x27;s Green unless Kaufman pays him a $5,000,000 ransom. Kaufman approaches Riley and tasks him, Charlie and Slack, with retrieving the vehicle. 

After catching up with &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;, Riley approaches the vehicle alone. Realizing Riley is working for Kaufman, Cholo holds both him and Charlie at gunpoint. As Cholo prepares to fire &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;″s missiles at Fiddler&#x27;s Green, Riley deactivates the weapons systems remotely. Kaufman&#x27;s stooge Motown opens fire and nearly kills both Riley and Cholo, but is bitten by a zombie and killed by Slack. Riley asks Cholo to come with him, but Cholo opts to confront Kaufman at Fiddler&#x27;s Green. While en route, Cholo is bitten by a zombie, while Riley returns to Fiddler&#x27;s Green in &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;.

Big Daddy leads a legion of zombies across the river where they breach the perimeter fence, overpower the border guards, and invade the city. Kaufman flees but encounters a zombified Cholo in the parking garage, where Big Daddy kills both of them with an exploding propane tank. Riley&#x27;s group manages to escape, where they use missiles to mercy-kill people being devoured by the zombies. Mulligan appears, revealing he rescued most of the poor people; he and Riley bid each other farewell before parting with their groups. Witnessing Big Daddy and the zombies leaving the city, sparing the surviving humans, Riley similarly decides to spare them, realizing that they also seek sanctuary. After lighting the remaining fireworks, Riley&#x27;s group embarks for Canada on &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;.

==Cast==
== Production ==
=== Development ===
After a decade of disinterest towards the zombie genre through the 1990s, zombies had begun to rise in popularity again in the 2000s after box-office hits like &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002) and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; (2004). This inspired George A. Romero to make his long-awaited fourth installment of the zombie series since its most recent installment, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, released in 1985. Romero had negotiated with 20th Century Fox, who wanted the film to be titled &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. He refused, wanting to use the title &quot;Dead Reckoning&quot;, and the studio then wanted to title it &quot;Night of the Living Dead: Dead Reckoning&quot;. It turned out that Fox sought to own the rights to the &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; franchise, and Romero decided not to do business with them. Romero was offered a budget of $15 million-19 million after negotiating with Universal Pictures, making the film his highest-budgeted film in the series. He used this as a chance to draw upon on some elements he was not able to use on &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, due to budget constraints.

=== Casting ===
Despite having a bigger budget with him this time than most of his films, Romero still wanted to cast lesser-known actors for the lead roles like Simon Baker and Robert Joy with exceptions being actors like Dennis Hopper and John Leguizamo, the former of which Romero cast after being impressed by most of his films. Romero cast Asia Argento for the role of Slack after working with her father, Dario Argento, on some of his films like &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978) and &quot;Two Evil Eyes&quot; (1990). He also cast his longtime makeup artist friend, Tom Savini and &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; star Simon Pegg and director Edgar Wright for zombie roles, with Savini reprising his biker character, Blades, from &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, now as a zombie and with Pegg and Wright appearing as Photo Booth Zombies.

=== Filming ===
Filming took place in Toronto and Hamilton, Ontario, Canada between October and December 2004.

== Release ==
The film received positive reviews upon release. It was released one year and three months after the release of the remake &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;. The film grossed over $40 million and is second behind &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; with the highest-grossing revenue (unadjusted for inflation) in the &quot;Living Dead&quot; series (not including the remakes), the two lowest being &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) and &quot;Diary of the Dead&quot; (2008). The film opened the MTV Saturday Horror block on February 27, 2010.

=== Ratings ===
&quot;Land of the Dead&quot; is the first film in the series to receive an MPAA rating for its theatrical release. Romero had said for years that he would film two versions: an &quot;R&quot; rated cut for theatrical release and first DVD, and an unrated cut for the second DVD release. Both DVDs were released in the U.S. on October 18, 2005. Rumors suggested that Romero shot alternate, less explicit, gore scenes for the theatrical release, but this is not entirely accurate. The more extreme instances of gore (e.g. a woman having her navel piercing graphically torn out by a zombie) were obscured by foreground elements filmed on bluescreen, so that these overlaid elements could be easily removed for the unrated DVD. Other ways to obscure blood to get an R-rating were achieved by simply trimming the grislier shots by a few seconds, by digitally repainting blood so that it is more black than red, or by digitally painting the blood out altogether.

British Columbia, Manitoba and Ontario gave both the theatrical version and DVD version a rating of &quot;18A&quot;, though it was only given a 13+ rating in Quebec.

In the UK, the BBFC gave both the theatrical version and the unrated version a 15 certificate for &quot;strong language, violence, horror and gore&quot;. Every UK release bar the UMD version were rated 18 overall due to a bonus feature (a highlights reel of the goriest moments called &quot;Scenes of Carnage&quot;).

In Germany, both the theatrical and unrated versions were rated 18 anyway. As such, only the unrated version was widely available in Germany.

The film was banned in Ukraine.

== Reception ==
The film earned a 74% approval rating at the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes based on 179 reviews and an average rating of 6.70/10. The site&#x27;s consensus says, &quot;George A. Romero&#x27;s latest entry in his much-vaunted &quot;Dead&quot; series is not as fresh as his genre-inventing original, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;. But &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; does deliver on the gore and zombies-feasting-on-flesh action.&quot; On Metacritic, which assesses film with a score out of 100, the film holds a rating of 71 based on 30 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four for what he considered its skillful and creative allusions, something that he argued was pervasive among Romero&#x27;s previous three installments, which contained numerous satirical metaphors to American life. Ebert noted this installment&#x27;s distinction between the rich and poor, those that live in Fiddler&#x27;s Green and those that live in the slums. John Lutz, in &quot;Zombies of the World, Unite: Class Struggle and Alienation in Land of the Dead&quot;, drew comparisons between the fireworks which were set off to distract the zombies in &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; to the US military &#x27;shock and awe&#x27; displays seen in its military actions. Jeffrey Westhoff of &quot;Northwest Herald&quot; gave the film a rating of 3.5 stars out of four, saying, &quot;The most shocking thing about &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; is not the vivid dismemberments but how boldly Romero holds a macabre mirror up to post-9/11 America.&quot; Michael Wilmington of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded the film four stars, writing, &quot;It&#x27;s another hard-edged, funny, playfully perverse and violent exercise in movie fear and loathing, with an increasingly dark take on a world spinning out of control. By now, Romero has become a classicist who uses character and dialogue as much as stomach-turning special effects to achieve his shivers.&quot; &quot;The New York Sun&quot; declared it &quot;the American movie of the year&quot;.

Several filmmakers, including John Landis, Eli Roth, Clive Barker, and Guillermo del Toro, paid tribute to Romero in a &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; special. Guillermo del Toro said: &quot;Finally someone was smart enough to realize that it was about time, and gave George the tools. It should be a cause of celebration amongst all of us that Michelangelo has started another ceiling. It&#x27;s really a momentous occasion...&quot;

== Video game ==
A prequel, &quot;Land of the Dead: Road to Fiddler&#x27;s Green&quot;, was released later that year.

<text>Breakfast Television (BT) is the 3rd most viewed morning show in Ontario behind CP24 and CHCH morning live. BT is a Canadian morning television program that is broadcast by Citytv. First premiering in 1989, the program originated as the morning show of the network&#x27;s original station CITY in Toronto.

The program currently consists of a local segment for the Greater Toronto Area airing from 6:00 a.m. to 8:30 a.m. ET, which airs exclusively on Citytv Toronto. This is then followed by a national portion carried by most other Citytv stations (barring Citytv Saskatchewan, which does not air news programming due to its educational remits); in Toronto, this segment is carried from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. ET, with scheduling varying in other markets.

The &quot;BT&quot; format and branding had also been franchised to local morning shows carried by other Citytv stations in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, Edmonton, Montreal, and the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN)—which was owned by former Citytv parent company CHUM Limited (after the sale of CHUM to CTVglobemedia and resulting sale of Citytv to Rogers Media, ASN continued using the brand under license until 2011, when it rebranded as CTV Two Atlantic and the program was retitled &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;). In the mid- and late-2010s, the local versions of &quot;BT&quot; began to either be cancelled or replaced by &quot;hybrid&quot; productions incorporating segments of national interest from the Toronto show. In 2020, the two remaining local versions in Calgary and Vancouver were cancelled by Rogers in preparation for the expansion of its national content.

==History==

&quot;Breakfast Television&quot; premiered on September 5, 1989 with co-hosts Ann Rohmer and David Onley, with MuchMusic VJ Steve Anthony broadcasting from a different spot around the area each day. Kevin Frankish handled news updates from the &quot;CityPulse&quot; (later &quot;CityNews&quot;) newsroom (he also handled the overnight updates broadcast from the assignment desk that flowed directly into &quot;BT&quot;). From 1995 to 2008, &quot;BT&quot; was simulcast on then-sister station CKVR in Barrie, with &quot;VRLand News&quot; inserts replacing the &quot;CityPulse&quot;/&quot;CityNews&quot; segments. Just as many people within the &quot;CityNews&quot; team started off on the CHUM phoneline, both Jennifer Valentyne and producer Kevin Forget started by working at &quot;the &quot;BT&quot; Diner&quot;.

Co-host Liza Fromer quit her job at &quot;BT&quot; in July 2006, days after the birth of her child. Kevin Frankish has blogged that her departure from the show was &quot;on the absolute best of terms&quot;. &quot;BT&quot; has encouraged people to send audition tapes for consideration. During the summer of 2006, a number of CHUM personalities were invited to guest co-host with Kevin Frankish in the search for the next permanent host. The guest hosts included &quot;CityNews&quot; sports anchor Kathryn Humphreys, health specialist Laura DiBattista, consumer specialist Jee-Yun-Lee, former Citytv weather specialist Nalini Sharma, former reporter Melissa Grelo, &quot;etalk&quot; correspondent Tracy Melchor, BT&#x27;s own Jennifer Valentyne, and Star!&#x27;s Dina Pugliese. On October 13, 2006, Dina Pugliese became the show&#x27;s new co-host.

Every August since 2005, &quot;BT&quot; has organized a &quot;Viewer Appreciation Day&quot;, held in the BT parking lot. Gates open at 6 a.m., and closed due to capacity crowds early into 7 a.m. Some people began camping out at &quot;BT&quot; at 5:30 p.m. the day before the 2006 Viewer Appreciation Day. &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; has also held other events, such as a successful world record attempt and a Christmas party. The BT Viewer Appreciation Day has since been canceled, with only the Christmas Party remaining.

On September 5, 2011, each of the local editions of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; across all of the Citytv owned-and-operated stations began starting a half-hour earlier, running from 5:30–9 a.m. In April 2012, the Winnipeg edition reverted to the 6-9 a.m. runtime.

In January 2015, the Winnipeg version of the program was cancelled and replaced with a simulcast of the CITI-FM morning show. In September 2019, the Montreal version of the program was cancelled, while the Calgary and Vancouver versions were re-launched on September 23, 2019 using a &quot;hybrid&quot; format incorporating segments of national interest from the Toronto version. Meanwhile, the Toronto version celebrated its 30th anniversary.

In March 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, Citytv announced that it would expand &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; to include a new national hour dedicated to coverage related to COVID-19. The hour would air live nationwide at 9 a.m. ET following the Toronto show, pre-empting an hour of &quot;BT&quot; in Calgary and Vancouver.

In July 2020, Roger Petersen announced that he would leave &quot;BT&quot; Toronto.

On November 17, 2020, Rogers announced that the local versions of &quot;BT&quot; in Calgary and Vancouver would be cancelled, as it planned to reformat the Toronto version to include more national content beginning in 2021.

On January 21, 2021, it was announced Sid Seixeiro of Sportsnet&#x27;s &quot;Tim &amp; Sid&quot; would become the new co-host of the program on March 10, 2021.

On February 15, 2023, Dina Pugliese announced her departure from &quot;BT&quot;, and her last show was on February 24, 2023. On September 5, 2023, Meredith Shaw joined &quot;BT&quot; to replace Pugliese.

In May 2024, Rogers cancelled Citytv&#x27;s long-running lifestyle show &quot;CityLine&quot;, and announced that it would be subsumed in September 2024 by &quot;BT with Tracy and Cheryl&quot;, an additional, lifestyle-oriented hour of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; featuring former &quot;CityLine&quot; and &quot;ET Canada&quot; hosts Tracy Moore and Cheryl Hickey. The new hour did not premiere in September, and the network announced in January 2025 that production would not proceed. On February 10, 2025, Citytv then announced that it had also released Sid Seixeiro and Meredith Shaw, citing a planned &quot;evolution&quot; of the show to be announced &quot;in the coming weeks&quot;.

==Local versions==

=== Vancouver edition ===
CKVU launched a local version of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in 2002. The original hosts of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; were Michael Eckford and Fiona Forbes, then they were replaced by Shane Foxman and Beverley Mahood, and since 2005, Simi Sara and Dave Gerry hosted the program, but as of August 13, 2008, they were let go.

On January 19, 2010, the length of BT was shortened from four hours to three hours, and six employees laid off as a result of &quot;severe financial issues&quot; with the Citytv stations.

A new format for &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; debuted in September 2008, with a new traffic and TransLink reporter. As part of Rogers Media&#x27;s May 3, 2012 renewal of its affiliation agreement with Jim Pattison Group-owned Citytv affiliates CKPG-TV/Prince George, CFJC-TV/Kamloops and CHAT-TV/Medicine Hat, the three stations will begin simulcasting the Vancouver edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on September 1, 2012 as part of an expansion of Citytv programming on the stations, which will follow the program grid of CKVU (with breakaways from the Vancouver program grid for their weekday evening and midday newscasts and other locally produced programs).

On September 5, 2019, Rogers laid off 4 employees from CKVU and placed &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on hiatus until September 23. At this time the program was relaunched with a new hybrid format, consisting of a mixture of local content with national entertainment and lifestyle segments produced from Toronto.

On November 17, 2020, Rogers imposed staff cuts across the country, including cancelling &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in Vancouver and Calgary.

=== Calgary edition ===
CHUM Limited purchased Craig Media in late 2004. The $265 million deal included, among other things, Craig&#x27;s three A-Channel stations (CKAL-TV in Calgary, Alberta; CKEM-TV in Edmonton, Alberta and CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba).

In February 2005, CHUM announced that the A-Channel stations would be relaunched as Citytv stations by that fall. The morning show on the original A-Channel stations, &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot;, was relaunched as &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; on August 2, 2005 alongside their re-branding as Citytv. The A-Channel brand was subsequently transferred to CHUM&#x27;s NewNet stations, whose own morning programs were retitled &quot;A-Channel Morning&quot;.

As in Vancouver, Rogers made cuts to &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in Calgary in September 2019, placing the program on hiatus and re-launching it on September 23 with the same, aforementioned format changes.

Former presenters
* Ross Hull - Live Eye reporter
* Dave Kelly - Main anchor (2005–2009)
* Mike McCourt - News anchor
* Jill Belland - Host

=== Winnipeg edition ===
CHMI-TV in Winnipeg, Manitoba produced a version of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; from August 2, 2005 to January 6, 2015 - the station was purchased along with CKAL-DT in Calgary and CKEM-DT in Edmonton. The final hosts were Courtney Ketchen, Jeremy John, Jenna Khan and Drew Kozub. It was replaced with a simulcast of &quot;Wheeler in the Morning&quot;—the morning show of sister radio station CITI-FM—starting on January 12, 2015. Khan and Kozub were retained as co-hosts for news and entertainment segments shown during the program on television in place of music.

Former presenters
* Pay Chen - Host (2009–2011)
* Jon Ljungberg - Host (?-2010)
* Erin Selby - Host (2005–2007)

===Atlantic Canada edition===
From 1992 to 2011, the Atlantic Satellite Network (ASN) in Atlantic Canada, now known as CTV Two Atlantic, aired its own local version of &quot;BT&quot;. At the time of its launch, ASN and Citytv (Toronto) were both owned by CHUM Limited, and both channels had a similar overall movies-focused format. The Atlantic edition of &quot;BT&quot; was similar to the Toronto version, but with a greater emphasis on the culture of the region, as matters such as commuter traffic are typically less of a concern in Atlantic Canada.

ASN was acquired by Baton Broadcasting (predecessor of the present-day Bell Media) in 1997, but was permitted to continue using &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; as the title of its morning show. In August 2011, the program was re-branded as &quot;CTV Morning Live&quot;, in keeping with the launch (or relaunch) of local morning shows under the same title on CTV and CTV Two stations in various parts of Canada.

Former presenters
* Scott Boyd
* Jill Krop
* Liz Rigney
* Kurt Stoodley
* Cyril Lunney
* JC Michaels
* Todd Battis
* JC Douglas
* Jayson Baxter
* Maria Panapolis

=== Edmonton edition ===
On May 7, 2015, Rogers announced the cancellation of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; in Edmonton as part of cutbacks. It was replaced by a spin-off known as Dinner Television, a new two-hour evening program hosted by Jason Strudwick, joined by &quot;BT&quot; personalities Bridget Ryan and Courtney Theriault. The program was a newsmagazine with discussion segments, and did not feature original news reporting. The former &quot;BT&quot; timeslot was filled by encores of the previous evening&#x27;s edition of &quot;Dinner Television&quot; with on-screen news, traffic, and weather information. &quot;Dinner Television&quot; was subsequently cancelled in 2017 with the relaunch of local &quot;CityNews Edmonton&quot; newscasts.

Former presenters
* Bill Welychka - Host (2005–2006)

=== Montreal edition ===
Rogers was granted approval by the CRTC on December 20, 2012 to acquire CJNT Montreal and convert it from a multicultural station to a fully English Citytv station. As part of the approval, Rogers had until September 1, 2013 to produce local programming on the station, which included a three-hour Montreal edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot;.

On June 6, 2013, Rogers announced that the Montreal edition of &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; would premiere on August 26, 2013, and would be hosted by Alexandre Despatie and Joanne Vrakas. Despatie left the program in 2015, and was succeeded by Derick Fage.

On September 5, 2019, Rogers Media announced the cancellation of &quot;Breakfast Television Montreal&quot;, effective immediately. Colette Watson, senior vice-president of television and broadcast operations at Rogers Media, stated that the program was &quot;not sustainable&quot;.

Former presenters
* Joanne Vrakas - Co-host
* Derick Fage - Co-host (2015–2019)
* Catherine Verdon Diamond - Weather and traffic
* Alexandre Despatie - Co-host (2013–2015)

<text>Samantha Jane Bond (born 27 November 1961) is an English actress. She played Miss Moneypenny in four James Bond films during the Pierce Brosnan era, and appeared in &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; as the wealthy widow Lady Rosamund Painswick, sister of Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham. On television, she played &quot;Auntie Angela&quot; in the sitcom &quot;Outnumbered&quot; and the villain Mrs Wormwood in the CBBC &quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off, &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;. She also originated the role of &quot;Miz Liz&quot; Probert in the &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; series. She is a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company.

==Early life==
Bond is the daughter of actor Philip Bond and television producer Pat Sandys, and is the sister of the actress Abigail Bond and the journalist Matthew Bond. Bond&#x27;s paternal grandparents were Welsh. She was brought up in London and Richmond-upon-Thames, in homes in Barnes and St Margarets. She attended the Godolphin and Latymer School, and studied acting at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School.

==Career==

===Early career===

Bond&#x27;s first acting role came as a student at age 21, in the original stage production of &quot;Daisy Pulls It Off&quot;, Denise Deegan&#x27;s play about a girls school, which opened at Southampton&#x27;s Nuffield Theatre in 1983. Her earliest television roles took place the same year: she played Maria Rushworth (née Bertram) in the BBC mini-series adaptation of Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Mansfield Park&quot;, and Rumpole&#x27;s pupil in chambers &quot;Miz Liz&quot; Probert in the fourth series of &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;. In 1985, she appeared as Julia Simmons in the BBC&#x27;s televised adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s crime novel &quot;A Murder is Announced&quot;, part of the Miss Marple series.

===Theatre===

Bond&#x27;s work with the Royal Shakespeare Company (the RSC) began in 1987, when she performed in three of the company&#x27;s stage productions: &quot;Les Liaisons Dangereuses&quot;, &quot;Hero and Leander&quot;, and &quot;Lorca&#x27;s Women&quot;. In 1992, the RSC cast her as Rosalind in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which she performed in their Stratford-upon-Avon and London theatres, and as Hermione in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, also at the company&#x27;s two theatres. She then toured with the RSC as Hermione in 1993.

Bond starred as the titular Amy in the Royal National Theatre&#x27;s West End production of David Hare&#x27;s play &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot;, opposite Judi Dench, in 1997 and into early 1998. Later in 1998, she co-starred in playwright Shelagh Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;The Memory of Water&quot;, also in the West End.

In 1999, Bond and Dench reprised their roles in &quot;Amy&#x27;s View&quot; on Broadway for a limited run at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre. Their performances garnered Bond a Tony nomination for Best Featured Actress in a Play, and Dench the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Play. Hare received a special citation from the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle.

Bond revisited &quot;The Memory of Water&quot;, making her directorial debut on a short touring production of the play in 2000, the same year it won an Olivier award for Best New Comedy. She also performed in numerous stage productions during the 2000s, among them: 
Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; in 2001, as Hippolyta and Titania, again for the RSC; Donald Margulies&#x27;s Pulitzer prize-winning &quot;Dinner with Friends&quot;, as Karen, opposite her &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; co-star Elizabeth McGovern and directed by McGovern&#x27;s husband Simon Curtis, in 2001; &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot; in 2002; and in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, as Lady Macbeth opposite Sean Bean in the title role, on tour in 2002 and 2003.

Other stage performances include Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; in 2003; &quot;The Rubenstein Kiss&quot; in 2005; Michael Frayn&#x27;s &quot;Donkey&#x27;s Years&quot; at London&#x27;s Comedy Theatre in 2006; and David Leveaux&#x27;s West End revival of Tom Stoppard&#x27;s &quot;Arcadia&quot; at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre, in 2009 as Hannah, alongside another &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; co-star, Dan Stevens.

The next decade brought Bond onstage in Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, as Mrs. Cheveley opposite her real-life actor husband Alexander Hanson as Mr. Cheveley, in 2010–2011, and as Nell in Passion Play by Peter Nichols in 2013. In 2014, Bond acted and sang in the West End musical production of &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot;, playing the role of Muriel Eubanks. Bond stated in an interview that she had not sung on stage in over 30 years and was nervous at the prospect. In a Radio Times review of the play, the critic described Bond as &quot;stage royalty&quot; and &quot;hilarious.&quot; In October and November 2017, Bond appeared in the English language premiere of Florian Zeller&#x27;s modern French farce, &quot;The Lie&quot;, once again alongside her husband, Alexander Hanson, at an Off-West End theatre called the Menier Chocolate Factory.

===Television and film===

In 1989, Bond starred as Mary MacKenzie, a young Scottish woman, in an independent fantasy film (a the television adaptation of Oswald Wynd&#x27;s novel &quot;The Ginger Tree&quot;), alongside Tim Robbins in &quot;Erik the Viking&quot;.

She appeared in a 1990 adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s short story &quot;The Adventure of the Cheap Flat&quot; for the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot; on ITV, starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot. Bond was also seen on ITV in an episode of the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; detective drama series based on novels by Colin Dexter, in 1992, and in a 1995 episode of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, an anthology series of ghost stories on the BBC. In 1996, she portrayed Mrs. Weston in the television movie &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Emma&quot;, starring Kate Beckinsale as Emma, a Meridian-ITV/A&amp;E production that has been described as grittier and &quot;more authentic&quot; to Austen&#x27;s story than the theatrical film starring Gwyneth Paltrow that was released the same year. 

From 1995 to 2002, Bond played Miss Moneypenny, M&#x27;s secretary at MI6, opposite Dench as M and Pierce Brosnan as Agent 007: &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, and &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. The role of Miss Moneypenny is the smallest role she ever played, yet the character remains a favorite among James Bond fans. In a BBC interview, Bond remarked that she retired from the role when Pierce Brosnan stepped down as the lead.

Bond co-starred in 2004 with Peter Davison, as a married couple who uproot themselves to a remote island to save their marriage, in the ITV drama-comedy &quot;Distant Shores&quot;. In 2007, she played the villain Mrs. Wormwood in the pilot episode of the BBC children&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Sarah Jane Adventures&quot;, a spin-off of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. She later came back to play the same character in the two-part finale of the show&#x27;s second series, &quot;Enemy of the Bane&quot;.

Bond guest-starred in three episodes of the murder mystery series &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot;: &quot;Destroying Angel&quot; in 2001, &quot;Shot at Dawn&quot; in 2008, both starring fellow RSC member John Nettles in the lead role of DCI Tom Barnaby, as well as the first episode in 2011&#x27;s series 14, &quot;Death in the Slow Lane&quot;.

From 2007 to 2014, Bond had a recurring role as Auntie Angela in the BBC&#x27;s semi-improvised comedy series &quot;Outnumbered&quot;, alongside Hugh Dennis, Claire Skinner and David Ryall.

From 2010 through 2015, Bond appeared as Lady Rosamund Painswick in the ensemble cast of ITV&#x27;s drama series &quot;Downton Abbey&quot;, written and produced by Julian Fellowes. Each series was shown in the US on PBS&#x27;s Masterpiece program one year after its broadcast in the UK; according to PBS, &quot;Downton Abbey&quot; became the most watched drama ever shown on the station, and the most watched series in the history of Masterpiece. Lady Rosamund is the widowed, wealthy sister of Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham. Bond&#x27;s first appearance was in the last episode of the first series; she appeared in 18 episodes in total.

The ITV show &quot;Home Fires&quot;, featured Bond as Frances Barden, a woman working to strengthen connections among the women in her small English village by keeping the local &quot;Women&#x27;s Institute&quot; operating during the early days of World War II. The show premiered in the UK in 2015 and was cancelled in 2016; fans petitioned ITV to reinstate it, to no avail. It played in the US on PBS&#x27;s Masterpiece in 2016 and 2017, where viewers were similarly disappointed to learn of the show&#x27;s demise. The series creator, Simon Block, has stated he intends to continue the story in written form, as novels. In 2020 Bond played Joanne Henderson in &quot;Death in Paradise&quot; (S9:E5). In September 2023, Bond starred in the Channel 5 drama series &quot;The Inheritance&quot;, appearing alongside Rob James-Collier, Jemima Rooper, Gaynor Faye and Adil Ray.

===Audiobooks===
Bond has narrated a number of audiobooks including Mary Norton&#x27;s &quot;The Borrowers&quot;, Joanna Trollope&#x27;s &quot;An Unsuitable Match&quot;, Anthony Horowitz&#x27;s &quot;Magpie Murders&quot; and Helen Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Baby: The Diaries&#x27; &#x27;Goldeneye&quot;. She has most recently released S J Bennett&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Windsor Knot&quot;. She received an Earphones Award for &quot;Magpie Murders&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bond lives in St Margarets, London, and has been married since 1989 to Alexander Hanson, with whom she has two children. She received an honorary doctorate from the University of Northampton in 2014.

<text>Advertising mail, also known as direct mail (by its senders), junk mail (by its recipients), mailshot or admail (North America), letterbox drop or letterboxing (Australia), is the delivery of advertising material to recipients of postal mail. The delivery of advertising mail forms a large and growing service for many postal services, and direct-mail marketing forms a significant portion of the direct marketing industry. Some organizations attempt to help people opt out of receiving advertising mail, in many cases motivated by a concern over its negative environmental impact.

Advertising mail includes advertising circulars, plastic mailers, coupon envelopes (Money Mailer, Valpak), catalogs, CDs, &quot;pre-approved&quot; credit card applications, and other commercial merchandising materials delivered to homes and businesses. It may be addressed to pre-selected individuals, or unaddressed and delivered on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis.

== Origin ==
North Carolina state historians say Lunsford Richardson &quot;is widely to considered to have invented ‘junk mail.’&quot; In the process of expanding the market for his new products made by the Vicks company of Greensboro, North Carolina. In 1917, the U.S. Postal Service began allowing mail to be sent to rural addresses without including the name of the addressee. Vicks sent out millions of samples of Vicks VapoRub.

== Postal services ==
Postal systems offer lower rates for buyers of bulk mail permits. In order to qualify for these rates, marketers must format and sort the mail in specific ways – which reduces the handling required by the postal service.

Income from advertising mail represents a significant and growing portion of some postal services&#x27; budgets, and it is a service actively marketed by them. In the United States, ad mail dollars decreased from $96.6 billion in 2004, to $80.9 billion in 2013. A study by Boston Consulting Group predicts that overall share of ad-spend in the US will increase from 11% in to 12% by 2020. In Canada, addressed and unaddressed advertising mail accounted for 20% of Canada Post&#x27;s revenue in 2005, and the share is increasing. Postal services employ the terms &quot;advertising mail&quot;, &quot;admail&quot;, and &quot;direct mail&quot;, while avoiding and objecting to the pejorative term &quot;junk mail&quot;.

The United States Postal Service offers a direct mail service known as Every Door Direct Mail, that provides resources allowing businesses to target, design, print and mail to specific households without needing to know the addresses.

In many developed countries, advertising mail represents a significant and growing amount of the total volume of mail. In the United States, &quot;Standard mail: advertising&quot; comprised 29% of all mail in 1980 and 43% in 2003.
== Direct mail marketing ==


Direct mail is a common form of direct marketing, and may be employed by for-profit businesses, charities and other non-profits, political campaigns, and other organizations. Direct mail encompasses a wide variety of marketing materials, including brochures, catalogs, postcards, newsletters and sales letters. In 2015 more than 150 million direct mail promotions were sent out with a reported 42% of respondents scanning or reading the mail.

=== Creation ===
Copywriters write the words, also known as copy, for direct mail. These copywriters are known inside the trade as direct response copywriters. Direct response copy follows a proven format based on testing results. Graphic designers who specialize in direct marketing also play a key role in the success of direct mail programs. Many direct mail marketers will mail different version of copy (A/B testing) to test the effectiveness of different appeals. The winning mail package will be known as the control and the direct mail company will continue to mail the control until a different package produces improved results, usually measured by metrics such as revenue and conversion rate.

=== Targeting ===
Advertisers often refine direct mail practices into targeted mailing in which mail is sent following database analysis to select recipients considered most likely to respond positively. This reduces costs for mailers by narrowing the mailing universe to only the most likely audience. For example, a person who has demonstrated an interest in golf may receive direct mail for golf-related products or perhaps for goods and services that are appropriate for golfers. This use of database analysis is a type of database marketing. Alternatively, unaddressed direct mail may be sent on a neighbourhood-by-neighbourhood basis. Whether at the individual or neighbourhood level, direct mail marketing allows recipients to be targeted, attempting to match the demographic profile of the recipients to one most closely matching that of likely customers. Individually targeted direct mail may be tailored based on previous transactions and gathered data. For example, all male recipients of an offer may receive a personalized package with a man&#x27;s picture on the cover while all female recipients receive a picture of a woman.

Often advertisers will include a Johnson Box in letters. These are aimed at drawing the targeted consumers into reading further in the letter.

=== Cost-effectiveness ===
To the non-professional, direct mail may seem wasteful, yet the medium can be one of the most cost-effective. Database targeting combined with an effective pricing, creative and list strategy can reduce waste and maximize profitable results for the mailer. Testing is accomplished in a variety of ways including A/B split testing of new mailings versus a control and testing lists through &quot;Nth&quot; name selects.

=== Political usage ===
Political campaigns make frequent use of direct mail, both to gain votes from the electorate as a whole, and to target certain groups of voters thought to be open to a candidate&#x27;s message and to appeal for campaign funds.

Certain organizations and individuals have become known for their prowess in direct mail, including in the US, the Free Congress Foundation in the 1970s, Response Dynamics, Inc. in the 1980s, the National Congressional Club, and Richard Viguerie. With the advent of the Internet in political campaigns, direct mail became just one of many campaign management tools, but still played a significant role.

=== Nonprofit ===
Nonprofit companies use direct mail marketing as a consistent form of advertising. In its modern form, direct mail fundraising appeared in the United States after World War II when nationwide charities such as the National Easter Seal Society sought ways to broaden their fundraising base.

It was only with the advent in the 1960s of the ZIP code and, later, the computer that direct mail fundraising began to gain wide use. Before the ZIP code, it was difficult to target appropriate recipients of direct mail fundraising appeals, and before the computer, compiling and maintaining lists of supporters was tedious and costly. During the 1970s, when computers became increasingly affordable, the use of direct mail fundraising spread widely. It quickly became the means by which most Americans learned about and first provided financial support for their charities of choice.

The explosive growth of the nonprofit sector in the United States—quadrupling in the 1980s and doubling again in the 1990s and early 2000s—led to a massive expansion in the use of direct mail to build and sustain large, nationwide donor and membership lists. Today, direct mail fundraising accounts for at least one-fifth of the more than $250 billion contributed annually in the U.S. to the nation&#x27;s 1.6 million nonprofit organizations

Direct mail fundraising has its own unique jargon, with much of it related to the art and science of creating, producing and mailing the right appeal to the right list at the right time, and measuring the results.

In recent years, electronic communication media has been used more commonly among nonprofits. Online, email, and social media campaigns, collectively referred to as digital fundraising, have been used in coordination with direct mail fundraising. Nonprofits supplement direct mail campaigns with email blasts and social media posts, using similar messaging and visuals to tie the various communications together. However, digital fundraising has not grown fast enough to replace direct mail for most nonprofits. In 2012, digital fundraising accounted for 7 percent of charitable donations in the United States.

This form of marketing is increasingly used by charitable groups in the UK. In 2013, £239 million was spent by British charities on direct mail advertising campaigns.

=== Current relevance ===
Direct mail marketing is under scrutiny by many of its former and current advocates. The arguments against using direct mail marketing include possible impact on the environment and changing attitudes among consumers.

In the United States, the common practice of address standardization can defeat the purpose of advertising mail by stripping away local identity, thus leaving many recipients alienated. It is also argued that direct mail is not cost-efficient. It has been suggested that social media will eventually replace direct mail as the preferred method for marketing communications. Those who believe direct mail marketing has a future cite its strong growth in 2011. It has been reported that large publishers like the Tribune Company and RR Donnelley have growing direct mail divisions. Nonprofit organizations continue to use direct mail at a subsidized USPS rate.

=== Business-to-business mailings (B2B) ===
When targeted to other businesses rather than individuals, direct mail is known as a business-to-business mailing. Traditionally, this worked in one of two ways: as a direct sale, therefore precluding the use of a salesperson or a retail store, or as a method of generating leads for a salesforce. The former method was ideally used by products that were easy to sell, were familiar to the prospect and needed no demonstration. The latter method was used for large-ticket items or for those that needed demonstration, for example.

One method of direct mailing used in B2B is known as &quot;bill-me.&quot; In this direct-mail marketing offer, the buyer is shipped the product prior to payment and is then sent an invoice later.

== Opting out ==

Several organizations offer opt-out services to people who wish to reduce or eliminate the amount of addressed advertising mail they receive. In the UK, the Mailing Preference Service allows people to register with them for removal from posted as opposed to hand-delivered mail. As of 2017 in the United States two organizations offering these services include Catalog Choice and DMAChoice. A similar organization by the name of 41pounds.org received customer complaints and then became defunct. Another one by the name of Tonic Mailstopper (formerly GreenDimes) no longer appears to be in business either.

Several websites critical of junk mail have guides for people interested in reducing the amount of junk mail they get, such as the Center for a New American Dream.

In response to a US Supreme Court ruling (&quot;Rowan v. Post Office Dept.&quot;, 397 U.S. 728 (1970)), the United States Postal Service enables an applicant to obtain a Prohibitory Order, which gives people the power to stop non-governmental organizations from sending them mail, and to demand such organizations remove the consumers’ information from their mailing lists.
In Canada, the highly publicized Red Dot Campaign offers advice on reducing unaddressed advertising mail. The campaign focuses on advertising the Canada Post policy to respect &quot;No Junkmail&quot; signs, noting that this policy is not promoted by Canada Post itself. The name &quot;red dot&quot; refers to an internal marker used by Canada Post to indicate which households do not wish to receive unaddressed admail.

The UK Royal Mail also offers an opt-out service, though unaddressed government mailings cannot be separated from advertisements, and those who opted out of the latter would stop receiving the former as well.
== Criticism ==
=== Environmental effect ===

Several of the above organizations, as well as environmental groups, express concern about the environmental impact generated by direct mail.

In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 44% of junk mail is discarded without being opened or read, equalling four million tons of waste paper per year, with 32% recovered for recycling. Further, the Ohio Office of Compliance Assistance and Pollution Prevention (OCAPP) estimates that 250,000 homes could be heated for a single day&#x27;s junk mail (70,000,000,000,000/3 btus of energy or 28,870,000,000/21 kWh of energy).

In the UK, the Minister of State responsible for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs estimated that &quot;direct mail and promotions&quot; accounted for between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes of paper in 2002, with 13% being recycled. The government and the Direct Marketing Association (UK) together agreed on recycling targets for the direct mail industry, including a goal of 55% by 2009, though the DMA&#x27;s latest estimates are that the industry will fall well short of this mark.

Mike Berners-Lee estimates that receiving five letters per day plus two printed catalogs per week results in CO2e per year.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; article from 2009 states that in the United States 51.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gases are emitted each year from mail advertisements. The Environmental Protection Agency indicates that in 2009 total US greenhouse gas emissions were 6,700.10 million metric tons.

===Privacy issues===

Recipients may conceive of advertising mail as a privacy problem, both because its generation requires extensive collection and use of information, and because receipt of mail can be an intrusion into the home. Numerous public opinion polls have found that Americans find advertising mail intrusive, for instance, in June 2003, the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project found that 19 percent of Americans found, &quot;junk mail delivered by the postal service&quot; a very big intrusion and 33 percent found it to be a big intrusion. Researchers at the University of California recently found that four out of five Americans favor a do-not-mail law, similar to the existing do-not-call telemarketing registry.

===Attention===
Advertising mail has been criticized as a form of attention theft.

<doc id="915525" wikidata="Q5145089" url="?curid=915525" title="Colin Fletcher">
<text>Colin Fletcher (14 March 1922 – 12 June 2007) was a pioneering backpacker and writer.

In 1963, Fletcher walked the length of that portion of Grand Canyon contained within the 1963 boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park. Although his route spans only a little more than one-third the length of Grand Canyon, Fletcher was only the second person to complete this section and the first to accomplish the feat &quot;in one go&quot;  – as chronicled in his bestselling 1968 memoir &quot;The Man Who Walked Through Time&quot;. Fletcher obtained the route information critical for successfully completing his epic trip from the godfather of Grand Canyon hiking, Harvey Butchart, who completed the distance barely ahead of Fletcher the same year  – having hiked it one section at a time over 17 years. Through his influential hiker&#x27;s guide, &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;, published the same year, he became a kind of &quot;spiritual godfather&quot; of the wilderness backpacking movement. Through successive editions, this book became the definitive work on the topic and was christened &quot;the Hiker&#x27;s Bible&quot; by &quot;Field &amp; Stream&quot; magazine.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Born in Cardiff, Wales, on 14 March 1922, Fletcher was educated in England and served six years in the Royal Marine Commandos during World War II. He married Sonia Mary Ash in 1945 and they lived in St. Ives, Cornwall, for a year where he was an instructor at the Mountain Warfare Training Centre. They moved to Kenya in 1947 where they ran the Kitale Hotel. They separated in 1948 and he spent time farming in Kenya, surveying in Zimbabwe, and as a prospector in western Canada. He moved to the United States in 1956. Two years later, he walked the length of the state of California, a journey that was the basis for his first book, &quot;The Thousand-Mile Summer&quot;.

===Writing career===
Fletcher published a total of 10 books between 1964 and 2001, which included four editions of &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;. His first book, &quot;The Thousand-Mile Summer&quot; (1964) recounted his 1958 hike along the entire eastern edge of California. His second book was &quot;The Man Who Walked Through Time&quot; (1968), in which Fletcher was the first person to walk a continuous route through Grand Canyon National Park. The book covered such topics as technique, the journey itself, and reflections which included the concept, after weeks of walking, of achieving a state of mentally &quot;merging&quot; with the place that one is visiting. When Fletcher conducted the trip in 1963, the National Park did not encompass the entire length of the canyon, the park was later expanded to include the entire Canyon. The first person to walk the entire length of the Grand Canyon was Kenton Grua in 1977. He was inspired by Fletcher&#x27;s book but set out to &quot;do it right&quot; by walking from end to end, not just the section of the canyon inside the National Park.

In 1968, Fletcher published the first edition of &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;, his most popular work, including three new editions, with the last in 2001, in total selling over 500,000 copies. Fletcher&#x27;s book is distinguished by its encyclopedic treatment of the technique and equipment of wilderness travel, as well as by what critics and readers have praised as its rousing humor and elegant, vigorous prose. While certainly comprehensive in its discussion of all aspects of wilderness travel, it also devotes a generous amount of coverage to Fletcher&#x27;s self-confessed idiosyncrasies, ranging from his affection for walking staffs and corduroy shorts to his loathing of wilderness trail guidebooks.

In the early 1970s, Fletcher returned to Kenya&#x27;s Serengeti Plain, and Great Rift Valley for a year, an experience he recounted in &quot;The Winds of Mara&quot;, published in 1973.

In 1981, he published &quot;The Man From the Cave&quot;, which relates how, after finding a trunk and a few belongings abandoned by someone in a desert cave in Nevada, he spent years piecing together the life story of &quot;Trunkman.&quot; As he pieced together the mystery of the man&#x27;s life, Fletcher saw in it a discovery and reflection of himself, &quot;We both valued solitude and silence and square, smoothed-off granite boulders.&quot;

In 1989, Fletcher rafted and hiked the entire length of the Green/Colorado River from its source in the Wind River Range of Wyoming to the Gulf of California. He related the story of the journey in &quot;River&quot; (1997), using his customary description of the places through which he travelled as a metaphor, comparing the course of the river and its emptying into the sea, to life itself, and his own life in particular.

His last edition of &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;, &quot;The Complete Walker IV&quot; (2002), was written with Chip Rawlins.

===Later years===
In his later years, Fletcher became a prolific writer on environmental issues. He was publicity-shy, rarely responding to letters or interview requests, although always willing to incorporate reader feedback into revised editions of &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;.

In 2001, at the age of seventy-nine, Fletcher was struck and seriously injured by an SUV while walking to a town meeting near his home in Monterey County, California. His survival was attributed to his excellent physical condition. Within a year of the accident, he was back on his feet and walking daily.

According to published obituaries, Fletcher died on 12 June 2007 in Monterey, California, as a result of complications from a head injury sustained from being hit by the car six years earlier.

==Influence and legacy==
Annette McGivney, editor of &quot;Backpacker&quot;, has written that &quot;Colin was sort of the founding father of modern backpacking, the first person to write about going out for an extended period and being self-sufficient.&quot; Because many people started following Fletcher&#x27;s advice in &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;, according to McGivney, &quot;the book could be credited with starting the backpacking industry,&quot; including equipment makers and periodicals like &quot;Backpacker&quot;. Through his writings Fletcher &quot;inspired a generation of young Americans to take up backpacking as means of filling a spiritual void,&quot; and to escape from the confusion of Vietnam-era America:&quot;After Vietnam, I was trying to figure out what to do with my life. So many of my friends had died from bullet holes,&quot; recalls &quot;Backpacker&quot; contributing editor Buck Tilton. &quot;I read &quot;The Man Who Walked Through Time&quot;, and it was the only thing that made sense to me. Fletcher&#x27;s words gave meaning to backpacking. I loaded my pack exactly the way Fletcher did and carried a walking stick like his. He was my hero.&quot;

== Quotes ==
* God is light, we are told, and Hell is outer darkness. But look at a desert mountain stripped bare by the sun, and you learn only geography. Watch darkness claim it, and for a moment you may grasp why God had to create Satan  – or man to create both.  – &quot;The Thousand-Mile Summer&quot; (1964)
* Dedicated urbanites &quot;know&quot; beyond shadow of doubt  – because doubt never raises its disturbing head  – that civilization is the real world: you only &quot;escape&quot; to wilderness. When you&#x27;re out and away and immersed, you &quot;know&quot; the obverse: the wilderness world is real, the human world a superimposed facade ... The controversy is, of course, spurious. Neither view can stand alone. Both worlds are real. But the wilderness world is certainly older and will almost certainly last longer. Besides, the second view seems far healthier for a human to embrace.  – &quot;River&quot; (1997)
* But if you judge safety to be the paramount consideration in life you should never, under any circumstances, go on long hikes alone. Don&#x27;t take short hikes alone, either  – or, for that matter, go anywhere alone. And avoid at all costs such foolhardy activities as driving, falling in love, or inhaling air that is almost certainly riddled with deadly germs. Wear wool next to the skin. Insure every good and chattel you possess against every conceivable contingency the future might bring, even if the premiums half-cripple the present. Never cross an intersection against a red light, even when you can see all roads are clear for miles. And never, of course, explore the guts of an idea that seems as if it might threaten one of your more cherished beliefs. In your wisdom you will probably live to be a ripe old age. But you may discover, just before you die, that you have been dead for a long, long time.  – &quot;The Complete Walker&quot;

<doc id="915528" wikidata="Q5059580" url="?curid=915528" title="Center for Democracy and Technology">
<text>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology (CDT) is a Washington, D.C.–based 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that advocates for digital rights and freedom of expression. CDT seeks to promote legislation that enables individuals to use the internet for purposes of well-intent, while at the same time reducing its potential for harm. It advocates for transparency, accountability, and limiting the collection of personal information.

The CDT seeks to mitigate online media censorship, enable individuals to access information freely without retaliation or punishment, and encourages consensus among all parties interested in the future of the Internet. 

The CDT strives to act as a non-partisan body, drawing together perspectives from varying backgrounds to emphasize the importance of technology&#x27;s role in the freedom, expression, security, privacy, and integrity of the individual. It advises government officials, agencies, corporations, and civil society. In addition to its office in Washington, D.C., the CDT has a full-time presence in Brussels.

== History ==
===Founding ===
CDT was founded in 1994, by Jerry Berman, the former executive director and former policy director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Specifically, the passage of Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), which expanded law enforcement wiretapping capabilities by requiring telephone companies to design their networks to ensure a certain basic level of government access, spurred Berman to found CDT. Recognizing a threat to privacy and innovation in CALEA&#x27;s design mandates, CDT fought the passage of the CALEA and later worked to ensure that its implementation would not extend to the Internet. In the end, CALEA did not contain wiretapping design mandates for the Internet and required transparency surrounding design standards. CDT&#x27;s launch was assisted by seed donations from AT&amp;T Corporation, Bell Atlantic, Nynex, Apple, and Microsoft.

=== 1994–1999 ===
In its early years, CDT fought the Communications Decency Act (CDA) in its attempt to restrict free expression online for the sake of child safety. CDT founded the Citizens Internet Empowerment Coalition (CIEC), a coalition of free speech groups and tech companies for the advancement of free speech. Against the proposed government censorship of the CDA, the CIEC maintained that both child safety and free speech could be protected by giving users the right to control their own content access. To provide further context for the case, CDT wired the courtroom so that the judges of Philadelphia&#x27;s District Court could see the Internet. After combining forces with the ACLU, the CIEC&#x27;s counsel argued the case before the Supreme Court. The CDA was struck down unanimously in 1997.

In the following year, CDT helped to craft the Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act. Testifying before Congress, CDT argued that the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) should be able to develop rules to protect both adults&#x27; and children&#x27;s privacy online. Forming a coalition of free expression and youth rights groups, CDT and its coalition secured an amendment to limit parental consent to children 12 and under, allowing teenagers to enjoy more freedom online.

In a 1999 report, CDT made clear that the Federal Election Commission&#x27;s (FEC) attempts to regulate online political speech according to campaign finance laws were impractical and to the detriment of civic political engagement. CDT worked against the FEC&#x27;s proposal with an organized group of online activists and bloggers. In collaboration with the Institute for Politics, Democracy, and the Internet, CDT created guidelines to help the FEC and Congress consider their treatment of citizens&#x27; political speech online. In support, hundreds of concerned parties signed onto the listing of principles, urging the FEC to drop its proposed rules and Congress to end the rule-making. CDT&#x27;s grassroots advocacy reversed the tide. The FEC abandoned its proposal and issued a new rule that applied campaign finance regulations only to paid online advertising, protecting the online political speech of citizens.

===2000–2007===
CDT launched the Global Internet Policy Initiative in 2000, partnering with Internews to survey 11 developing countries to assess their telecom and Internet policies. CDT staff worked with Frank LaRue to shape a report on Internet human rights and the U.S. Ambassador to the UN Human Rights Council to educate members of the Council on Internet freedom in advance of the successful Resolution on Internet Freedom.

Following an influx of spyware in 2003, CDT filed complaints against egregious actors with the FTC, resulting in historic settlements against spyware companies. CDT pulled together anti-spyware and anti-virus companies, leading security product distributors, and public interest groups to create the Anti-Spyware Coalition (ASC). The ASC developed a self-regulatory model for companies based on shared definitions of spyware, a comprehensive risk model, best practices for software companies, and a concise vendor conflict resolution process. Using the ASC outputs, anti-spyware companies could label malicious software and protect consumers without fear of being sued by the companies they were targeting, and advertisers could keep better track of where their advertisements were displayed.

In 2006, CDT united with the Business for Social Responsibility to assemble human rights advocates, companies, researchers, and investors to deal with government calls for censorship and restriction of information access. The pairing has successfully worked together to create an accountability framework and principles for the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a human rights organization that promotes the privacy of individual users while preventing online censorship by authoritarian governments.

In 2007, CDT was among the first advocacy organizations to formally call for a Do Not Track (DNT) list from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In addition, CDT has played an integral role in pushing for a standardized DNT header at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). In 2010, the FTC requested a system that would allow consumers to control whether they were tracked online. In response, all five major browsers put DNT features into place, granting users the ability to surf the web incognito. The W3C formed a Tracking Protection Working Group in order to standardize the DNT compliance, which CDT leadership had a prominent role in.

===2008–2012===
In 2008 CDT was given a grant of $125,000 over two years from the MacArthur Foundation to support the Internet, Human Rights and Corporate Responsibility Initiative. CDT has also voiced privacy concerns about &quot;deep packet inspection&quot; (DPI), a technology that allows companies to collect data from Internet service providers (ISPs) and categorize individual Internet traffic streams to service ads based on that information without user consent. CDT conducted legal analysis to show how DPI advertising practices could violate the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) and testified before Congress. In 2009, major ISPs affirmed that they would not use DPI-based behavioral advertising without robust opt-in provisions. In the same year, CDT started the Health Privacy Project to bring expertise to complex privacy issues surrounding technology use in health care. A year later, CDT recommended new guidelines for reporting data breaches and for protecting health data used in marketing. These guidelines were incorporated into the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.

Later in 2009, the CDT commented on aspects of smart home appliances and the Smart Grid, and the potential dangers of the then-growing technology. More specifically, the potential risks of the information that could be collected, noting &quot;device identifiers that uniquely identify a smart device and the manufacturer, control signals that reveal the function of smart devices, energy consumption at frequent time intervals at both the household and device level, temperature inside customers’ home, status of smart devices such as IP address and firmware version, and customers’ geographic region&quot;. They drew concern over the usage of the data collected, citing said concern over the potential benefits of smart appliances but the dangers of &quot;invading the traditionally protected zone of he home and home life. Without planning, such adverse impacts could drive opposition to the Smart Grid and prompt a backlash against data collection that could be socially beneficial when limited to the narrow purposes of improving efficiency&quot;.

Later in 2010, CDT launched the Digital Due Process Coalition, establishing four principles for Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) reform. Currently, the coalition has over one hundred members including some of the biggest Internet companies to advocacy groups across the entire political spectrum. The campaign for ECPA reform has brought the need for extending full constitutional protections to the Internet to the forefront of the national debate and has resulted in 2013 coalition-supported bipartisan bills in both houses of Congress.

Two copyright enforcement bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), were introduced to the US Congress in 2010 and 2011. Both bills posed serious threats to the technical grounds of the Internet, as well as freedom of expression online, by increasing the role of ISPs and Internet intermediaries in combating online copyright infringement. In opposition to SOPA and PIPA, the CDT gathered organizations from technical and civil society backgrounds. The efforts of CDT provided critical legal analysis which laid the foundation for 2012&#x27;s surge of grassroots resistance against SOPA and PIPA.

CDT was one of the few civil society organizations involved in the founding of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), encouraging a bottom-up style of governance and making certain that the voice of the Internet users be included at the table. In the ICANN deliberations, CDT argued for public representation and for the placement of a Civil Society representative on its board. In helping to form the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development&#x27;s (OECD) Principles for Internet Policy Making in 2011, CDT also pushed for a multi-stakeholder approach to Internet governance. OECD&#x27;s 34 member states committed to respect human rights, open governance, rule of law, and consideration of numerous viewpoints by accepting the principles.

=== Since 2012 ===
At the International Telecommunication Union&#x27;s (ITU) World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) in 2012, CDT brought inclusive Internet governance into focus. Though many governments came bearing proposals to escalate government and ITU control over Internet governance, CDT defeated all such proposals through organized civil society advocacy. In addition, CDT fortified relationships between organizations for the sake of future advocacy efforts. Even now, inclusive Internet governance faces serious obstacles as nations scramble to respond to news of the National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance. CDT continues to work with an expanding group of partners motivated by civil society concern to preserve the free and open nature of the Internet.

CDT requested Congress make Congressional Research Services Reports (CRS) publicly available and easily accessible. When Congress failed to do so, CDT started a website, OpenCRS.com, that made CRS reports freely available online. OpenCRS.com was one of the leading sources of CRS reports. By collecting CRS reports acquired by organizations and citizens through direct appeals to their representatives, the OpenCRS website served as a valuable repository of information. Though no longer in operation, the OpenCRS inspired other CRS websites and open resources.

CDT has long been an active supporter of Internet neutrality. In a brief filed in 2012, CDT supported the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s (FCC) Open Internet Rules. The rules detailed the limited role of the agency by blocking discrimination by broadband providers. In this way, the FCC intended to protect online free expression and innovation. In 2014, the Open Internet Rules were struck down, drawing CDT back into the fight for Internet neutrality on a global scale. By offering up extensive expertise, CDT has ensured that any EU regulation on Internet neutrality takes into account the central tenet of nondiscrimination.

In the early 1990s, the NSA developed and promoted the &#x27;clipper chip&#x27;, an encryption device for telephone calls. The NSA argued that government access to cryptographic keys was essential to national security – CDT and its allies claimed that the clipper chip would introduce greater vulnerabilities into the country&#x27;s communications networks. In 2013, on behalf of a coalition of Internet companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, and Twitter and advocates for free speech and privacy rights such as ACLU, EFF, and Mozilla, CDT delivered a &quot;We Need To Know&quot; letter to U.S. government officials, demanding greater transparency in matters of national security-related surveillance of Internet and telephone communications. Advocating for reform, CDT&#x27;s firm stance is that the NSA&#x27;s surveillance programs and its interference with Internet security infringe on privacy, are chilling free speech and association, and threaten the free flow of information that is the foundation of the open Internet. As an advocacy organization, CDT has outlined key reforms to NSA surveillance. On March 17, 2016, the CDT released a statement about the senates unwillingness to vote in favor of or against Merrick Garlands nomination to the Supreme Court, opting to wait for the election cycle. They did applaud his contributions in the federal court circuits of recognizing the merits of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, and ordering the CIA to release information about their drone strikes. They did not outright support him, only in favor of the senate making a decision after the longwinded period. In February 2017, stating the importance of privacy on smart televisions as they became more prevalent. This was following Vizio being fined by the FTC for tracking what users were viewing, and matching it to other identifying information collected about the consumer, eventually getting sold to third-parties interested in such data. In 2018, the CDT played a role in opposing the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), a controversial bill which they argued as &quot;a bill that will lead to censorship of a broad range of speech and speakers while failing to help law enforcement prosecute criminal traffickers&quot;. However, the law was passed and was enacted into public law on April 11, 2018.

In May 2020, the CDT filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration for his executive order 13,925 on preventing online censorship arguing that this executive order violates the first amendment. However, the court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. In May 2021, President Joe Biden revoked former president Trump&#x27;s executive order. The Center for Democracy and Technology praised this, quoting them referring to the executive order &quot;was an attempt to use threats of retaliation to coerce social media companies into allowing disinformation and hateful speech to go unchecked.&quot; In September 2020, the CDT organized a coalition opposed to the then recently proposed EARN IT Act, stating that the bill would potentially result in &quot;online censorship disproportionately impacting marginalized communities, jeopardize access to encrypted services, and risk undermining child abuse prosecutions&quot;. In July 2021, the CEO of CDT Alexandra Givens commented on a story relating to artificial intelligence hiring tools. Her concerns were about them adversely effecting candidates with disabilities, as artificial intelligence will likely use data from gamified tests like Pymetrics to make hiring decisions. This typically does not take into account an applicants strengths or weaknesses in the field, nor their experience. In September 2021, the CDT wrote a letter to multiple senators and representatives urging them to update the CIPA (Children’s Internet Protection Act) to protect the privacy of students using school computers by disallowing invasive monitoring software. This applies to computers on, and off-campus that are taken home by the student. In September 2021, the CDT released their research that children from low-income families are more likely to use school devices on, and off-campus and therefore are more likely to be observed by monitoring software. Afterwards, the CDT wrote a letter to multiple senators and representatives urging them to update the CIPA (Children’s Internet Protection Act) to protect the privacy of students using school computers by disallowing invasive monitoring software. This applies to computers on, and off-campus that are taken home by the student. In April 2019, Michelle Richardson, a director of the privacy and data project CDT she formerly head, commented on an article saying that federal regulation regarding social media, and the internet was inevitable.

A Center for Democracy and Technology gerrymandering expert on November 9, 2021 commented on North Carolina’s legislature&#x27;s multiple redrawings of the congressional map, citing that they were ordered twice, due to unfair gerrymandering. The Center for Democracy and Technology comments on gerrymandering because most drawings of districts are initially drafted by digital software of political parties. On November 29, 2021, a spokesperson for The Center for Democracy and Technology commented on FBI Documents obtained by the Rolling Stone magazine revealing that WhatsApp messages, and iMessages could be seen in real time by FBI agents with a warrant or subpoena. &quot;Judging by this document, &quot;the most popular encrypted messaging apps iMessage and WhatsApp are also the most permissive,&quot; according to Mallory Knodel, the chief technology officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology...&quot;You’re handing someone else the key to hold onto on your behalf,&quot; says Mallory Knodel of the Center for Democracy and Technology. &quot;Apple has encrypted iCloud but they still have the keys, and as long as they have the key, the FBI can ask for it.&quot;

==Project teams==
===Privacy and data===
Formerly directed by Michelle Richardson, CDT&#x27;s Privacy and Data Project was created to examine the evolving role of technology in daily life, considering its influence on individuals, communities, and law. Among the topics covered by CDT&#x27;s Privacy and Data team are AI and Machine Learning, European Privacy law, U.S Privacy Legislation, Disability rights and AI, Health Privacy, the Internet of Things, Broadband Privacy, Drones, Student Privacy, and Digital Decisions. Additionally, CDT heads the State Privacy Resource Center, which serves as a repository of information to help policymakers at the state and local level craft privacy legislation.

==== European privacy law ====
The CDT pushes for privacy to be upheld in Europe through different laws. Due to the many emerging possibilities in the field of data collection the CDT pushes to ensure that the privacy of the individuals in society data is maintained. The CDT focuses on both the technology behind data collection as well as the laws in place in Europe. The legislation that they are focused on includes the General Data Protection Regulation, Right to Be Forgotten, Pseudonymous Data, and the EUU.S. Privacy Shield agreement.

==== Health privacy ====
The CDT pushes for the privacy and security in the data that is collected in the health industry. Their recent featured content in this field includes vaccination data gathering, The CDT and eHI’s Proposed Consumer Privacy Framework for Health Data.

==== Student privacy ====
The CDT advocates for student data privacy due to the massive amounts of data being collected by school districts across the country, while also not having proper security measures in place to protect the data. The CDT helps school districts achieve higher security standards through policy advocacy and guidance. On December 2, 2021, the CDT published a research brief on student privacy titled Unmet Demand for Community Engagement on School Data and Technology Use, where the CDT’s research states that parents and students want to play a role in the decisions around technology and data.

=== Internet of Things ===
The CDT is attempting to push for Government officials and technology creators to work together to protect individuals’ privacy when it comes to these devices. The CDT and EPIC have filed an amicus brief arguing for protections for E-Scooter location information on August 23, 2021.

=== U.S privacy legislation ===

The CDT’s privacy team has worked on possible Legislation in order to garner support on the limitations on the collection and sharing of personal data in order to allow for the ability for individuals to be in control of their own data. The CDT has joined EPIC to urge congress to strengthen FTC’s power to halt data abuse on November 8, 2021.

=== State privacy resources ===
The CDT has created a resource center to help state and local policy makers to push for privacy regulations on the local and state level as the CDT believes that regulations for privacy on the local and state level can lead the way for changes on the federal level.

=== Workers’ rights ===
The CDT focuses on educating the public on the impacts of technologies on the workplace as well as researching possible technologies to assist workers in doing things like gaining fairer compensation. On September 16, 2021, the CDT posted an article to inform people about the threat of bossware titled &quot;Strategies to Tackle Bossware’s Threats to the health &amp; Safety of Workers&quot;.

===Free expression===
CDT&#x27;s Free Expression Project places emphasis on the ability for information being allowed to flow freely online without restrictions. The main focus of this project is to advocate for the protection of online free speech, while simultaneously providing criticism and other insight towards concepts such as online content censorship and gatekeeping.  In particular, CDT observes the application and the boundaries of the First Amendment online in many circumstances, due to the constantly changing nature of the internet and other technologies that allow the spread of mass information at large. CDT&#x27;s Free Expression team currently focuses on subjects such as Digital Copyright, Intermediary Liability, Children&#x27;s Privacy, and Net Neutrality. This project is currently directed by Emma Llansó, a graduate of Yale&#x27;s School of Law and the University of Delaware.

The team meets with different companies, academic institutions, and government officials to enact change and make sure of consumer transparency on possible platform moderation practices that could affect the user’s rights. On November 16, 2021, the CDT filed a brief to urge to 11th circuit to affirm preliminary injunction enjoining enforcement of Florida’s social media law.

===Security and surveillance===
The Security and Surveillance Project of the CDT was created for the purpose of limiting the extent of which governments should be allowed to access and store personal information about their citizens, in addition to limiting the surveillance of foreign citizens. This project calls for the restriction of such practices to be implemented through legislation. The formation of this project was inspired by the rapid evolution of mass data storage technologies, and the increasing accumulation of the big data industry following the integration of the internet. The project also considers issues of ECPA reform, cybersecurity, U.S. government surveillance, drones, and encryption and government hacking.

==== Internet architecture ====
The Internet Architecture team of the CDT focuses on online anonymity and encryption, the standards that govern the technical decisions of internet operation, net neutrality, government surveillance, internet governance policies at across the globe, cybersecurity research, and election security and privacy. The Internet Architecture project focuses on the value provided by individual security, privacy and free expression.

===European Union===
With their presence in Brussels, CDT has made efforts to promote their agenda overseas by advocating for the establishment of an open and inclusive Internet in collaboration with the EU&#x27;s Member States, civil society, public institutions, and technology sector. CDT&#x27;s EU Office focuses on the policy areas of digital copyright, intermediary liability and free expression, surveillance and government access to personal data, net neutrality, internet governance, and data protection and privacy. The GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), EU net neutrality policy, European Commission&#x27;s cybersecurity strategy, and the EU intellectual property enforcement directive are among the issues that CDT&#x27;s Brussels Office has actively engaged with.

=== AI and disability rights ===
The CDTs Privacy and Data team is working to ensure that innovation in the field of AI and machine learning remains.

The CDT’s privacy team advocates for algorithms that make fair decisions when it comes to people with disabilities through analyzing how artificial intelligence is used to make decisions regarding employment. The CDT shares this data with policy makers, researchers, advocates, and disabled community members in order to make a change and make sure these algorithms stay fair. The CDT recently Join AJL, ACLU, Color of Change and other organizations in order to urge the secretary of commerce to fill Artificial Intelligence advisory committees with experienced civil rights advocates.

==Funding==
One-third of CDT&#x27;s funding comes from foundations and associated grants such as the MacArthur Foundation, while another third of the organization&#x27;s annual budget comes from industry sources including various companies such as Amazon, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, TikTok and Apple, among other high-profile tech oriented businesses. The remainder is split among an annual fundraising dinner known in DC circles as the &quot;tech prom&quot;, Cypress awards, and other sources. In 2020, of the $5,689,369 generated through donations from outlets such as foundations and large corporations, the majority of funding ($4,655,316) was used for programs relating to education and research. The remaining $1,034,053 was dedicated to other expenses, with $224,012 going to public events, $280,000 going towards further fundraising for future projects, and $530,041 going to organizational administration.

<doc id="915530" wikidata="Q2543744" url="?curid=915530" title="Zaum">
<text> () are the linguistic experiments in sound symbolism and language creation of Russian Cubo-Futurist poets such as Velimir Khlebnikov and Aleksei Kruchenykh. Zaum is a non-referential phonetic entity with its own ontology. The language consists of neologisms that mean nothing. Zaum is a language organized through phonetic analogy and rhythm. Zaum literature cannot contain any onomatopoeia or psychopathological states.

== Usage ==
Aleksei Kruchenykh created Zaum in order to show that language was indefinite and indeterminate.

Kruchenykh stated that when creating Zaum, he decided to forgo grammar and syntax rules. He wanted to convey the disorder of life by introducing disorder into the language. Kruchenykh considered Zaum to be the manifestation of a spontaneous non-codified language.

Khlebnikov believed that the purpose of Zaum was to find the essential meaning of word roots in consonantal sounds. He believed such knowledge could help create a new universal language based on reason.

Examples of zaum include Kruchenykh&#x27;s poem , Kruchenykh&#x27;s libretto for the Futurist opera &quot;Victory over the Sun&quot; with music by Mikhail Matyushin and stage design by Kazimir Malevich, and Khlebnikov&#x27;s so-called &quot;language of the birds&quot;, &quot;language of the gods&quot; and &quot;language of the stars&quot;. The poetic output is perhaps comparable to that of the contemporary Dadaism but the linguistic theory or metaphysics behind zaum was entirely devoid of the gentle reflexive irony of that movement and in all seriousness intended to recover the sound symbolism of a lost aboriginal tongue. Exhibiting traits of a Slavic national mysticism, Kruchenykh aimed at recovering the primeval Slavic mother-tongue in particular.

Kruchenykh would author many poems and mimeographed pamphlets written in Zaum. These pamphlets combine poetry, illustrations, and theory.

In modern times, since 1962 Serge Segay was creating zaum poetry. Rea Nikonova started creating zaum verses probably a bit later, around 1964. Their zaum poetry can be seen e.g. in issues of the famous &quot;Transponans&quot; samizdat magazine. In 1990, contemporary avant-garde poet Sergei Biriukov has founded an association of poets called the &quot;Academy of Zaum&quot; in Tambov.

The use of Zaum peaked from 1916 to 1920 during World War I. At this time, Zaumism took root as a movement primarily involved in visual arts, literature, poetry, art manifestoes, art theory, theatre, and graphic design, and concentrated its anti war politic through a rejection of the prevailing standards in art through anti-art cultural works. Zaum activities included public gatherings, demonstrations, and publications. The movement influenced later styles, Avant-garde and downtown music movements, and groups including surrealism, nouveau réalisme, Pop Art and Fluxus.

== Etymology and meaning ==
Coined by Kruchenykh in 1913, the word or is made up of the Russian prefix &quot;beyond, behind&quot; and noun &quot;the mind, &quot; and has been translated as &quot;transreason&quot;, &quot;transration&quot; or &quot;beyonsense.&quot; According to scholar Gerald Janecek, can be defined as experimental poetic language characterized by indeterminacy in meaning.

Kruchenykh, in &quot;Declaration of the Word as Such (1913)&quot;, declares &quot;a language which does not have any definite meaning, a transrational language&quot; that &quot;allows for fuller expression&quot; whereas, he maintains, the common language of everyday speech &quot;binds&quot;. He further maintained, in &quot;Declaration of Transrational Language (1921)&quot;, that &quot;can provide a universal poetic language, born organically, and not artificially, like Esperanto.&quot;
