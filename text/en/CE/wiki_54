<text>The River Eden is a river that flows through Cumbria, England. It rises on Black Fell Moss, near the village of Outhgill, and runs in a generally north-westerly direction through the Vale of Eden and Solway Plain before reaching the sea at the Solway Firth. 

==Etymology==
The river was known to the Romans as the &quot;Itouna&quot;, as recorded by the Greek geographer Claudius Ptolemaeus (Ptolemy) in the 2nd century AD. This name derives from the Celtic word &quot;ituna&quot;, meaning &quot;water&quot;, or &quot;rushing&quot;. Thus there is no relation to the biblical Garden of Eden.

==Course of river==
The Eden rises in Black Fell Moss, Mallerstang, on the high ground between High Seat, Yorkshire Dales and Hugh Seat. Here it forms the boundary between the counties of Cumbria and North Yorkshire; the river gave its name to the former Eden district of Cumbria. Two other rivers arise in the same peat bogs here, within a kilometre of each other: the River Swale and River Ure.

It starts life as Red Gill Beck, then becomes Hell Gill Beck, before turning north and joining with Ais Gill Beck to become the River Eden. (Hell Gill Force, just before it meets Ais Gill Beck, is the highest waterfall along its journey to the sea).

The steep-sided dale of Mallerstang later opens out to become the Vale of Eden. The river flows through Kirkby Stephen and Appleby-in-Westmorland, and receives the water of many becks flowing off the Pennines to the east, and longer rivers from the Lake District off to the west, including the River Lyvennet, River Leith and River Eamont, which arrives via Ullswater and Penrith.

Continuing north, it formed the eastern boundary of Inglewood Forest. It passes close to the ancient stone circle known as Long Meg and Her Daughters and through the sparsely populated beef and dairy farming regions of the vale of Cumbria on the Solway Plain. After flowing through Wetheral, where it is crossed by Corby Bridge, a Grade I listed railway viaduct of 1834, it merges with the River Irthing from the east, followed by the River Petteril and River Caldew from the south, as it winds through Carlisle.

Its junction with the River Caldew in north Carlisle marks the point where Hadrian&#x27;s Wall crosses the Eden, only five miles before both reach their end at the tidal flats. It enters the Solway Firth near the mouth of the River Esk after a total distance of approximately .

==Ecology==
The river supports Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;) and Eurasian otter (&quot;Lutra lutra&quot;). The river and its tributaries are designated a Special Area of Conservation under the European Union&#x27;s Habitats Directive. The area protected by the SAC includes Ullswater.

<text>Magnuson Park is a park in the Sand Point neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. At it is the second-largest park in Seattle, after Discovery Park in Magnolia (which covers ). Magnuson Park is located at the site of the former Naval Station Puget Sound, on the Sand Point peninsula with Pontiac and Wolf bays that juts into Lake Washington in northeast Seattle.

==History==

===Early history===
The area has been inhabited since the end of the last glacial period (c. 8,000 BCE—10,000 years ago). Prairie or tall grassland areas (anthropogenic grasslands) were maintained along what is now Sand Point Way NE (map ), among numerous locations in what is now Seattle. The &quot;Xacuabš&quot; (&quot;Xachua&#x27;bsh&quot; or &quot;hah-choo-AHBSH&quot;, &quot;the People of the Large Lake&quot;, now of the Duwamish tribe) had the village of &quot;TLEHLS&quot; (&quot;minnows&quot; or &quot;shiners&quot;) on the shores of what is now called Wolf Bay in Windermere, on Lake Washington south of &quot;SqWsEb&quot;, now called Sand Point-Magnuson Park. &quot;BEbqwa&#x27;bEks&quot; (&quot;small prairie&quot;—anthropogenic grassland) was near what is now Windermere. One or three sizable longhouses have been documented. Villages were diffuse. These people may have been associated with the &quot;hloo-weelh-AHBSH&quot; of Union Bay. Just on the other side of Sand Point, the village of &quot;too-HOO-beed&quot; was of the &quot;too-oh-beh-DAHBSH&quot; extended family, near what is now called Thornton Creek at what is now Matthews Beach, so Sand Point was their shared &quot;side yard&quot;.

===Naval use===
The first park at Sand Point was established in 1900 as &quot;Carkeek Park&quot;, a gift from developers Mr. and Mrs. Morgan J. Carkeek. After World War I, a movement was begun to build Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle at Sand Point, and King County began acquiring surrounding parcels. In 1922 the U.S. Navy began construction on the site, which it was leasing from the county, and in 1926 the Navy was deeded the field outright. The name &quot;Carkeek Park&quot; was subsequently given to a new park on the west side of the city, north of Ballard on Puget Sound. This deed amounted to a public gift of $500,000 from the county to the Navy, in 1926 dollars; this would be $5,283,000 in 2005 dollars, not including significant real estate appreciation. The facility then became known as Naval Air Station Sand Point.

During construction of the naval air station, the Sand Point Airfield was the origin of the first successful aerial circumnavigation of the world, which was completed in 1924.

Naval Air Station Seattle was deactivated in 1970 and the airfield was shut down; the reduced base was renamed &quot;Naval Support Activity Seattle.&quot; Negotiations began as to who would receive the surplus property.

===City park===
In 1975 a large portion of the Navy&#x27;s land was given to the City of Seattle and to the NOAA. The city&#x27;s land was largely developed as a park and named Sand Point Park. In 1977, it was renamed Magnuson Park in honor of longtime U.S. Senator Warren Magnuson, a former naval officer from Seattle. Both names for the park are commonly used. The airfield runways were demolished in the late 1970s and new construction on the north end for the NOAA was completed in 1982.

==Geography==
The Sand Point peninsula on which Magnuson Park is located juts into Lake Washington between Wolf Bay and Pontiac Bay. As well as the park, the peninsula is occupied by parts of View Ridge and Windermere, and gives its name to the Sand Point neighborhood to the west. The easternmost point was formerly Naval Air Station-Sand Point; the old military base is now mostly public parkland. Other portions are occupied by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) western regional center and by city housing.

==Amenities==


Magnuson Park today features several sports fields, a picnic area, a swimming beach, public sailboating, many paths for walking and bicycling, a dog park or off-leash dog area and &quot;Kite Hill&quot;, a large grassy man-made hill constructed in the 1980s from earth and pavement pieces of the old airfield tarmac. Vehicle access includes boat launch ramps and large parking lots for cars, trucks, and boat trailers.

The park also has a history of unofficial clothing-optional use since the mid-1970s.

===Concerts===
&quot;Drop in the Park&quot; was the free open air concert given on 20 September 1992 by Pearl Jam in Magnuson Park. The theme was &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; to encourage visitors to vote for the presidential election that year. All 30,000 tickets were given away within a few hours. A local radio station announced the ticket giveaway location early on a weekend morning. People converged on the site to get 2 free tickets for each person in line. The concert was initially scheduled for 23 May 1992 at Gasworks park, but was eventually cancelled by local authorities over crowd management and other logistics concerns.

===Sports fields===
The Sports Meadow, a natural grass athletic field area, was developed in the early 1980s near the center of the former main runway. Rebuilt in 2004-05 and raised nearly eight feet to improve drainage, it is now divided into four unlit soccer fields. As of 2005, the City of Seattle had a development plan that featured a large sports field complex of approximately ten fields, with seven well lit. The plan had encountered opposition from neighborhood groups, environmental and park advocates.

The plan was amended to five new athletic fields with an engineered wetlands area, with additional pavement areas removed and construction of new walking trails. Opened in April 2009 southeast of the Meadow area, the first three fields (all lit with synthetic turf) are primarily for rugby (field # 5, lit) and soccer (# 6, 7, both lit). Later in the year the baseball field (# 8, unlit) and softball field (# 9) to the south were completed, but were not opened until late 2010 to allow the natural grass outfields to mature. Runoff from the athletic fields feeds the wetlands area and restrictions on lighting were enacted; no late nights or Sundays.

===Wetland restoration===
Sand Point provides habitat for the second richest bird habitat of any park in Seattle, with 170 species reported including pine siskins, Anna&#x27;s hummingbirds, and black-capped chickadees. Wildlife diversity has been improved in part by a wetlands restoration project that radically transformed the park&#x27;s landscape and hydrology.

Sand Point was substantially regraded during construction of the naval air station. Existing marshlands were eliminated with fill or paved over and the point&#x27;s natural slope was flattened. Runoff was channeled into storm drains, and around 20% of the park&#x27;s surface was rendered impervious with concrete and asphalt.

As the storm drains aged, they became less effective at channeling water to the lake, leading to an increase in sheet flow runoff and over-saturation of the park&#x27;s sports fields. The irregular runoff patterns also resulted in substantial volume of untreated water draining into Lake Washington.

The Wetlands Restoration project created a set of mounds, plateaus, valleys, and ponds to channel water more effectively and improve drainage of over-saturated areas. This constructed wetland provides natural filtration of urban drainage water and reduces pollution in Lake Washington.

Part of the wetlands project included the removal of the parking lot at the south end of the Sports Meadow and the demolition of Building 193 at the south end of the park. Built in 1943 as a hangar for transport aircraft, it was later the base&#x27;s commissary and exchange; it was removed in December 2006. of wetlands, including walking paths and observation points, were completed in 2009. The next phase of wetland restoration was completed in late 2011.

===Playground===
Magnuson Park is home to Seattle&#x27;s biggest playground, the Junior League of Seattle Children&#x27;s Playground which was designed, developed and funded through the efforts of the Junior League of Seattle, a women&#x27;s leadership and volunteer organization. Opened in 1999 and spearheaded by prominent Seattle resident, Mary Herche, the Playground celebrated its 10th anniversary on May 16, 2009, where children played in the of colorful climbing walls, sand box, swings, slides and much more.

The Junior League of Seattle donated and dedicated this &quot;Air, Land and Sea&quot; playground to the children of Seattle to commemorate the organization&#x27;s 75 years of community service. The playground was designed partly by children and built entirely by volunteers at the site of the former Naval Air Station Control Tower.

<doc id="921084" wikidata="Q714871" url="?curid=921084" title="Sinuiju Special Administrative Region">
<text>Sinuiju Special Administrative Region () was a planned special administrative region (SAR) of North Korea based in the city of Sinuiju. Proclaimed in 2002, the SAR was envisioned to be directly governed as in the case of &quot;Directly Governed Cities&quot; but has yet to be put into &quot;de facto&quot; operation.

Proposals for a special economic zone in Sinuiju to introduce market economics were first proposed to Chinese-Dutch businessman Yang Bin in 2001, who was proposed to be the zone&#x27;s director. Yang later accepted the proposal on several conditions; most importantly, rather than a SEZ, the proposed area would become a special administrative region, emulating China&#x27;s special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau. Under this proposal, the Sinuiju SAR would have its own &quot;Basic Law&quot; (기본법; Kibonpŏp), passport, flag and seal, and have large autonomy in all areas except foreign policy and defense. Though reluctant, North Korean officials eventually acceded to Yang&#x27;s proposals.

In 2002, the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly promulgated the Basic Law of the Sinuiju SAR and appointed Yang Bin as its governor. However, before Yang assumed office, he was arrested by Chinese authorities and sentenced to 18 years in prison for tax evasion and other economic crimes. Afterwards, North Korea effectively abandoned the project.

== History ==
In 2001, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il visited Shanghai, where Chinese officials attempted to impress him with China&#x27;s economic reforms. Impressed, Kim told Chinese leader Jiang Zemin that &quot;From the time China started to implement the policy of openness and reform, it achieved a tremendous success, especially in Shanghai. This proves that this policy of the Communist Party of China is a correct one.&quot; He was interested by greenhouses, and considered them as a potential solution to North Korea&#x27;s food shortages. He learned the name of their developer, the Chinese-Dutch businessman Yang Bin, and told his subordinates to create contacts with him.

Yang was willing to replicate his business in North Korea, and he and his colleagues travelled to Pyongyang and built a sample greenhouse. Kim Tong Gyu, a member of the Central Committee of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and the official in charge of negotiations with Yang, suggested to him on 21 January 2001 about a cooperation on a bigger project. He told Yang about the failed special economic zone in Rason in the 1980s, and said that North Korea was considering creating a new 27 km² zone in Sinuiju, asking him whether he would want to be the zone&#x27;s director. Yang told Kim he could not make this decision immediately, and Kim replied they were in no rush.

On his next visit to Pyongyang, Yang said he agreed in principle, but with several conditions. He asked for the zone to be enlarged from 27 km² to 82 km², meaning that the bridge that connects China to Sinuiju would be included in the area as well. He additionally said that it should not be a special economic zone, but rather a special administrative region. He explained the difference by saying a SEZ simply has a special economic regime, while a SAR has autonomy in almost every area except defense and foreign policy. He said that China had two SARs, Hong Kong and Macau, which at that time were established just a few years ago, and were the most economically successful cities in China.

North Korean officials were reluctant, but Yang insisted by saying that foreign investors were already familiar with the SAR system. North Korean officials asked &quot;But can we create a SAR but call it SEZ?&quot; Yang, countered by saying the name was an important signal to foreigners. North Korean officials agreed, and Yang also negotiated that the new SAR would have its own Basic Law, published in open sources, its own passport, and its own flag and seal. The Basic Law was heavily modelled after Hong Kong&#x27;s, drafted by prominent lawyers from Hong Kong and Macau, and stipulated that the SAR would last 50 years and would have its own legal system.

In 2002, the Presidium of the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly promulgated the Basic Law of the Sinuiju SAR and appointed Yang Bin as its governor. It announced that 30 September 2002 was the date the law would come into force. Yang called on a press conference to talk about his plans. He announced that around 300,000 to 500,000 people of the city would have to resettle to the southern part of Sinuiju, which was not part of the SAR, while the rest would stay and become residents of the SAR. Planning to demolish much of the city, Yang envisioned building a city similar to Shenzhen, with industrial zones and commercial, tourist and entertainment areas. He announced that the US dollar would become the SARs currency, and all foreigners would be granted visa-free access, including South Koreans. He announced that he was planning to appoint one to two South Koreans to the SARs Legislative Assembly.

However, the SAR or the proposed reforms did not come into effect by 30 September. Yang said that this was because North Korea was displeased with allowing South Koreans into Sinuiju freely, which he said would be rectified by creating a &quot;compatriot document&quot;, similar to the Mainland Travel Permit for Taiwan Residents. He said North Korea had not yet completed the fence which would separate the SAR from the rest of the country, which he told was another reason for the delay. Yang planned to move to the SAR permanently by late October. Before he formally assumed his post, he was arrested by Chinese authorities on 4 October and sentenced to 18 years in prison for tax evasion and other economic crimes. While the North Korean authorities soon announced that the development of the Sinuiju SAR would continue and the SAR was put under the administration of its Commission of Foreign Economic Cooperation Promotion, the plans for the SAR were effectively abandoned.

As of April 2008, the SAR reforms still have not been put into effect, and it is widely believed that North Korea has abandoned the project after Yang&#x27;s arrest. In September 2004, Chinese-American merchant Julie Sa (沙日香) was reported as a possible successor as governor. Between 2013 and 2018, a smaller Sinuiju International Economic Zone was developed, backed by the state-owned Sinuiju Zone Development Corporation. It hopes to develop high value projects such as software development, computer manufacturing and trade-related services.

==Economy==

A few factories and shipyard exist in Sinuiju, some producing consumer products for local use.

<doc id="921088" wikidata="Q224698" url="?curid=921088" title="1988 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1988 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXIV Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Seoul, South Korea, from 17 September to 2 October 1988. A total of 8,397 athletes representing 159 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 237 events in 23 sports across 31 different disciplines. Table tennis was introduced to the Summer Olympic Games program at these games, while tennis was reintroduced following its removal after the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, France.

Overall, athletes representing 52 NOCs received at least one medal, and 31 NOCs won at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union won the most gold medals and the most overall medals, with 55 and 132 respectively. Suriname&#x27;s team won their first Olympic gold medal, which was also their first Olympic medal of any color. The other teams that earned their first Olympic medal were Costa Rica, Djibouti, Indonesia, the Netherlands Antilles, Senegal, and the United States Virgin Islands.

Swimmer Kristin Otto of East Germany won the most gold medals for an individual at the games, with six gold medals. Fellow swimmer Matt Biondi of the United States won the most overall medals, winning seven medals with five golds, one silver, and one bronze, tying Mark Spitz&#x27;s record for most medals won in a single games.

== Medals table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC&#x27;s conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals won by athletes from each nation, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing resulted in a bronze medal being awarded to each of the two competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to fighting in a third place tiebreaker. Events in judo used a repechage system which also results in two bronze medals being awarded.

In the gymnastics events, there were five ties for medals. Three gold medals and no silver or bronze medals were awarded due to a three-way first-place tie in the men&#x27;s pommel horse. Two gold medals and no silver medal were awarded in the men&#x27;s horizontal bar and men&#x27;s rings, with the former also having a tie for bronze. Two bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s floor and women&#x27;s balance beam events. Outside of gymnastics, the men&#x27;s high jump in athletics and the women&#x27;s 50 metre freestyle in swimming both resulted in two bronzes being awarded due to third-place ties.

<doc id="921089" wikidata="Q4805690" url="?curid=921089" title="Ashmore Park">
<text>Ashmore Park is a large housing estate in Wednesfield, England. It has been part of the city of Wolverhampton, West Midlands since 1966, when the majority of Wednesfield was incorporated into Wolverhampton. It forms part of the Wednesfield North ward of the City of Wolverhampton council. The estate consists predominantly of council-built houses, flats and bungalows from the 1950s.

==History==

Ashmore Park was initially one of the wooded estates Lady Wulfruna transferred to St. Peter&#x27;s Fold to allow the park to generate income and food. A moat-surrounded farmhouse was built here sometime during the mid-14th century. Three-quarters of the moat still exists today in the &quot;bottom shops&quot; precinct.

A plaque placed by Wolverhampton Civic Society and Ashmore Park Community Association on The Hub Community Centre states Ashmore Park Colliery operated from 1875 to 1948 and employed a total of over 230 people below and above ground. Ordnance Survey mapping shows the colliery linked by a mineral tramway to a basin on the Wyrley and Essington Canal. The land was owned by the Duke of Cleveland. A reminder of the area&#x27;s mining history arose in 2019 when melting snow revealed a shaft near a children&#x27;s playground. The Coal Authority carried out work to seal the shaft and compact the filling material. 

1,500 homes were initially planned for Ashmore Park by Wednesfield Urban District Council in 1954 as part of Staffordshire County Council&#x27;s overspill housing scheme for Wolverhampton. The first house was opened on 16 June 1955 by the Chairman of Staffordshire County Council, Alderman A G B Owen and it was reported that 6,500 people would be housed in 1,750 homes. A shopping precinct and dwellings were opened by Cannock constituency MP Jennie Lee in September 1958. 

The Dean of Wolverhampton probably used the homestead in his role as Dean (landlord) of Ashmore Park. The original farmhouse was removed when a new one was built in the early 19th century. In 1957 authorities demolished that farmhouse and built a library near its site.

==Demographics==
According to the 2001 United Kingdom census, Ashmore Park had a total population of 6,734. Of these, 27.6% of its residents were between the ages of 25 and 44 years old, while 24.3% reported being between the ages of 60 and 74. The neighbourhood is not ethnically diverse, with 97.4% of its residents classified as Caucasian; the largest ethnic minority group is Black Caribbean, representing just 0.9% of the population.

54.5% of the 2,968 households in the neighbourhood were owner-occupied, while 39.4% of homes were council houses. Ashmore Park had an unemployment rate of 7.1%, ranking above the Wolverhampton average of 5.3%. Of those identified as economically inactive, 24.4% were retired. And of all households in the neighbourhood, only 11.1% were not considered deprived at all, while 7.2% were overcrowded.

Christianity is the area&#x27;s predominant religion, with 81.6% of the population identifying as Christian. 9.4% of residents reported that they did not have a religious affinity.

==Education==
The estate was served by Ashmore Park County Primary School and Danesfield Primary School. The two merged in 1983 to form Danesmore Primary, but this closed in February 1993. Both schools have since been demolished.

Today a secondary school, Coppice Performing Arts School, serves the estate, with three primary schools: Oak Meadow Primary School, Corpus Christi Catholic School, and St. Alban&#x27;s Primary School.

==Places of interest==

At the heart of the estate is a large green park consisting of a children&#x27;s play area and several sports facilities, including a skate park, multi-sports pitch, BMX track, and bowling green. The park is on the site of Ashmore Colliery and the play area had to be made safe in 2019 after a mine shaft was discovered. The park is also home to the Wednesfield Aces and Wednesfield Dragons cycle speedway teams. 

There are two main shopping areas, known locally as the &quot;top&quot; and &quot;bottom&quot; shops due to their geographic location. The &quot;bottom shop&quot; precinct houses a mix of local and independent businesses and underwent an extensive facelift during the early 2000s that included work to preserve the historic moat site.

In 2014 a revamped community centre opened called The Hub at Ashmore Park with many facilities for the local community to use. The library which was located next to the &quot;bottom shops&quot; shopping precinct was closed and merged into the hub, whilst many other libraries were closed or had reduced opening hours in Wolverhampton.

There are two public houses and a social club on the estate: The True Briton, The Ashmore Inn and Corpus Christi Social Club.

In 2014 more than 350 members of the local community signed a petition to save The Ashmore Inn public house from being closed and turned into a retail store. The petition succeeded in having The Ashmore Inn listed as an Asset of Community Value. In 2016 a Coop Food convenience store and Tanning Salon were opened on adjacent land sharing the car park with the public house, whilst the bookmakers previously there moved to the &quot;bottom shops&quot; shopping precinct. 

==Transport==

===Trains===
The nearest train stations to Ashmore Park are Bloxwich North, Bloxwich and Wolverhampton.

===Buses===
Bus routes serving Ashmore Park include the 9, 57, 59 and 69 lines.

The 59 route, operated by National Express West Midlands, provides the most frequent service to the estate from Wolverhampton via Heath Town, New Cross Hospital and Wednesfield roughly every six minutes during the day (Monday-Saturday) and every 12 minutes in the evenings, on Sundays, and bank holidays.

The 69 route, also operated by National Express West Midlands, services the lower part of the estate between Wolverhampton and Walsall via Heath Town, New Cross Hospital, Wood End, Coppice Farm, New Invention, Beechdale, and Reedswood Retail Park. This service operates every 30 minutes during the day (Monday-Saturday) and hourly during the day on Sunday.

The 57 route, operated by Diamond West Midlands, also serves the lower zone of the estate. It runs from Wolverhampton to Bilston via Heath Town, Park Village, Wednesfield, Wood End, Lyndale Park, and Willenhall. An hourly service operates during the daytime, Monday-Saturday.

The 9 route, operated by National Express West Midlands, runs between Walsall and Wolverhampton via Rushall, Pelsall, Bloxwich, New Invention, Wednesfield and Bentley Bridge retail park. This does not enter the estate, rather running along Lichfield Road with stops near Peacock Avenue.

<text>Nutrient management is the science and practice directed to link soil, crop, weather, and hydrologic factors with cultural, irrigation, and soil and water conservation practices to achieve optimal nutrient use efficiency, crop yields, crop quality, and economic returns, while reducing off-site transport of nutrients (fertilizer) that may impact the environment. It involves matching a specific field soil, climate, and crop management conditions to rate, source, timing, and place (commonly known as the 4R nutrient stewardship) of nutrient application.

Important factors that need to be considered when managing nutrients include (a) the application of nutrients considering the achievable optimum yields and, in some cases, crop quality; (b) the management, application, and timing of nutrients using a budget based on all sources and sinks active at the site; and (c) the management of soil, water, and crop to minimize the off-site transport of nutrients from nutrient leaching out of the root zone, surface runoff, and volatilization (or other gas exchanges).

There can be potential interactions because of differences in nutrient pathways and dynamics. For instance, practices that reduce the off-site surface transport of a given nutrient may increase the leaching losses of other nutrients. These complex dynamics present nutrient managers the difficult task of achieve the best balance for maximizing profit while contributing to the conservation of our biosphere.

==Nutrient management plan==

A crop nutrient management plan is a tool that farmers can use to increase the efficiency of all the nutrient sources a crop uses while reducing production and environmental risk, ultimately increasing profit. Increasingly, growers as well as agronomists use digital tools like SST or Agworld to create their nutrient management plan so they can capitalize on information gathered over a number of years. It is generally agreed that there are ten fundamental components of a crop nutrient management plan. Each component is critical to helping analyze each field and improve nutrient efficiency for the crops grown. These components include:
;Field map: The map, including general reference points (such as streams, residences, wellheads etc.), number of acres, and soil types is the base for the rest of the plan.
;Soil test: How much of each nutrient (N-P-K and other critical elements such as pH and organic matter) is in the soil profile? The soil test is a key component needed for developing the nutrient rate recommendation.
;Crop sequence: Did the crop that grew in the field last year (and in many cases two or more years ago) fix nitrogen for use in the following years? Has long-term no-till increased organic matter? Did the end-of-season stalk test show a nutrient deficiency? These factors also need to be factored into the plan.
;Estimated yield: Factors that affect yield are numerous and complex. A field&#x27;s soils, drainage, insect, weed and crop disease pressure, rotation and many other factors differentiate one field from another. This is why using historic yields is important in developing yield estimates for next year. Accurate yield estimates can improve nutrient use efficiency.
;Sources and forms: The sources and forms of available nutrients can vary from farm-to-farm and even field-to-field. For instance, manure fertility analysis, storage practices and other factors will need to be included in a nutrient management plan. Manure nutrient tests/analysis are one way to determine the fertility of it. Nitrogen fixed from a previous year&#x27;s legume crop and residual effects of manure also affects rate recommendations. Many other nutrient sources should also be factored into this plan. 
;Sensitive areas: What&#x27;s out of the ordinary about a field&#x27;s plan? Is it irrigated? Next to a stream or lake? Especially sandy in one area? Steep slope or low area? Manure applied in one area for generations due to proximity of dairy barn? Extremely productive—or unproductive—in a portion of the field? Are there buffers that protect streams, drainage ditches, wellheads, and other water collection points? How far away are the neighbors? What&#x27;s the general wind direction? This is the place to note these and other special conditions that need to be considered.
;Recommended rates: Here&#x27;s the place where science, technology, and art meet. Given everything you&#x27;ve noted, what is the optimum rate of N, P, K, lime and any other nutrients? While science tells us that a crop has changing nutrient requirements during the growing season, a combination of technology and farmer&#x27;s management skills assure nutrient availability at all stages of growth. No-till corn generally requires starter fertilizer to give the seedling a healthy start.
;Recommended timing: When does the soil temperature drop below 50 degrees? Will a N stabilizer be used? What&#x27;s the tillage practice? Strip-till corn and no-till often require different timing approaches than seed planted into a field that&#x27;s been tilled once with a field cultivator. Will a starter fertilizer be used to give the seedling a healthy start? How many acres can be covered with available labor (custom or hired) and equipment? Does manure application in a farm depend on a custom applicator&#x27;s schedule? What agreements have been worked out with neighbors for manure use on their fields? Is a neighbor hosting a special event? All these factors and more will likely figure into the recommended timing.
;Recommended methods: Surface or injected? While injection is clearly preferred, there may be situations where injection is not feasible (i.e. pasture, grassland). Slope, rainfall patterns, soil type, crop rotation and many other factors determine which method is best for optimizing nutrient efficiency (availability and loss) in farms. The combination that&#x27;s right in one field may differ in another field even with the same crop.
;Annual review and update: Even the best managers are forced to deviate from their plans. What rate was actually applied? Where? Using which method? Did an unusually mild winter or wet spring reduce soil nitrate? Did a dry summer, disease, or some other unusual factor increase nutrient carryover? These and other factors should be noted as they occur.

When such a plan is designed for animal feeding operations (AFO), it may be termed a &quot;manure management plan.&quot; In the United States, some regulatory agencies recommend or require that farms implement these plans in order to prevent water pollution. The U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has published guidance documents on preparing a comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP) for AFOs.

The International Plant Nutrition Institute has published a 4R plant nutrition manual for improving the management of plant nutrition. The manual outlines the scientific principles behind each of the four Rs or &quot;rights&quot; (right source of nutrient, right application rate, right time, right place) and discusses the adoption of 4R practices on the farm, approaches to nutrient management planning, and measurement of sustainability performance.

==Nitrogen management==
Of the 16 essential plant nutrients, nitrogen is usually the most difficult to manage in field crop systems. This is because the quantity of plant-available nitrogen can change rapidly in response to changes in soil water status. Nitrogen can be lost from the plant-soil system by one or more of the following processes: leaching; surface runoff; soil erosion; ammonia volatilization; and denitrification.

===Nitrogen management practices that improve nitrogen efficiency===

Nitrogen management aims to maximize the efficiency with which crops use applied N. Improvements in nitrogen use efficiency are associated with decreases in N loss from the soil. Although losses cannot be avoided completely, significant improvements can be realized by applying one or more of the following management practices in the cropping system.

===Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions===
* Climate Smart Agriculture includes the use of 4R Nutrient Stewardship principles to reduce field emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) from the application of nitrogen fertilizer. Nitrogen fertilizer is an important driver of nitrous oxide emissions, but it is also the main driver of yield in modern high production systems. Through careful selection of nitrogen fertilizer source, rate, timing and placement practices, the nitrous oxide emissions per unit of crop produced can be substantially reduced, in some cases by up to half. The practices that reduce nitrous oxide emissions also tend to increase nitrogen use efficiency and the economic return on fertilizer dollars.

====Reduction of N loss in runoff water and eroded soil====
* No-till, conservation tillage and other runoff control measures reduce N loss in surface runoff and eroded soil material.
* The use of daily estimates of soil moisture and crop needs to schedule irrigation reduces the risk of surface runoff and soil erosion.

====Reduction of the volatilization of N as ammonia gas====
* Incorporation and/or injection of urea and ammonium-containing fertilizers decreases ammonia volatilization because good soil contact buffers pH and slows the generation of ammonia gas from ammonium ions.
* Urease inhibitors temporarily block the function of the urease enzyme, maintaining urea-based fertilizers in the non-volatile urea form, reducing volatilization losses when these fertilizers are surface applied; these losses can be meaningful in high-residue, conservation tillage systems.

====Prevention of the build-up of high soil nitrate concentrations====
Nitrate is the form of nitrogen that is most susceptible to loss from the soil, through denitrification and leaching. The amount of N lost via these processes can be limited by restricting soil nitrate concentrations, especially at times of high risk. This can be done in many ways, although these are not always cost-effective.

=====Nitrogen rates=====
Rates of N application should be high enough to maximize profits in the long term and minimize residual (unused) nitrate in the soil after harvest.
* The use of local research to determine recommended nitrogen application rates should result in appropriate N rates.
* Recommended N application rates often rely on an assessment of yield expectations – these should be realistic, and preferably based on accurate yield records.
* Fertilizer N rates should be corrected for N that is likely to be mineralized from soil organic matter and crop residues (especially legume residues).
* Fertilizer N rates should allow for N applied in manure, in irrigation water, and from atmospheric deposition.
* Where feasible, appropriate soil tests can be used to determine residual soil N.

=====Soil testing for N=====
* Preplant soil tests provide information on the soil&#x27;s N-supply power.
* Late spring or pre-side-dress N tests can determine if and how much additional N is needed.
* New soil test and sampling procedures, such as amino sugar tests, grid mapping, and real-time sensors can refine N requirements.
* Post-harvest soil tests determine if N management the previous season was appropriate.

=====Crop testing for N=====
* Plant tissue tests can identify N deficiencies.
* Sensing variations in plant chlorophyll content facilitates variable rate N applications in-season.
* Post-black-layer corn stalk nitrate tests help to determine if N rates were low, optimal, or excessive in the previous crop, so that management changes can be made in following crops.

=====Precision agriculture=====
* Variable rate applicators, combined with intensive soil or crop sampling, allow more precise and responsive application rates.

=====Timing of N applications=====
* Apply N close to the time when crops can utilize it.
* Make side-dress N applications close to the time of most rapid N uptake.
* Split applications, involving more than one application, allow efficient use of applied N and reduce the risk of N loss to the environment.

=====N Forms, including slow or controlled release fertilizers and inhibitors=====
* Slow or controlled release fertilizer delays the availability of nitrogen to the plant until a time that is more appropriate for plant uptake - the risk of N loss through denitrification and leaching is reduced by limiting nitrate concentrations in the soil.
* Nitrification inhibitors maintain applied N in the ammonium form for a longer period of time, thereby reducing leaching and denitrification losses.

=====N capture=====
* Particular crop varieties are able to more efficiently extract N from the soil and improve N use efficiency. Breeding of crops for efficient N uptake is in progress.
* Rotation with deep-rooted crops helps capture nitrates deeper in the soil profile.
* Cover crops capture residual nitrogen after crop harvest and recycle it as plant biomass.
* Elimination of restrictions to subsoil root development; subsoil compaction and subsoil acidity prevent root penetration in many subsoils worldwide, promoting build-up of subsoil nitrate concentrations which are susceptible to denitrification and leaching when conditions are suitable.
* Good agronomic practice, including appropriate plant populations and spacing and good weed and pest management, allows crops to produce large root systems to optimise N capture and crop yield.

====Water management====
=====Conservation tillage=====
* Conservation tillage optimizes soil moisture conditions that improve water use efficiency; in water-stressed conditions, this improves crop yield per unit N applied.

=====N fertilizer application method and placement=====
* In ridged crops, placing N fertilizers in a band in ridges makes N less susceptible to leaching.
* Row fertilizer applicators, such as injectors, which form a compacted soil layer and surface ridge, can reduce N losses by diverting water flow.

=====Good irrigation management can improve N-use efficiency=====
* Scheduled irrigation based on soil moisture estimates and daily crop needs will improve both water-use and N-use efficiency.
* Sprinkler irrigation systems apply water more uniformly and in lower amounts than furrow or basin irrigation systems.
* Furrow irrigation efficiency can be improved by adjusting set time, stream size, furrow length, watering every other row, or the use of surge valves.
* Alternate row irrigation and fertilization minimizes water contact with nutrients.
* Application of N fertilizer through irrigation systems (fertigation) facilitates N supply when crop demand is greatest.
* Polyacrylamide (PAM) treatment during furrow irrigation reduces sediment and N losses.

=====Drainage systems=====
* Some subirrigation systems recycle nitrate leached from the soil profile and reduce nitrate lost in drainage water.
* Excessive drainage can lead to rapid through-flow of water and N leaching, but restricted or insufficient drainage favors anaerobic conditions and denitrification.

====Use of simulation models====
Short-term changes in the plant-available N status make accurate seasonal predictions of crop N requirement difficult in most situations. However, models (such as NLEAP and Adapt-N) that use soil, weather, crop, and field management data can be updated with day-to-day changes and thereby improve predictions of the fate of applied N. They allows farmers to make adaptive management decisions that can improve N-use efficiency and minimize N losses and environmental impact while maximizing profitability.

===Additional measures to minimize environmental impact===

====Conservation buffers====
* Buffers trap sediment containing ammonia and organic N.
* Nitrate in subsurface flow is reduced through denitrification enhanced by carbon energy sources contained in the soil associated with buffer vegetation.
* Buffer vegetation takes up nitrogen, other nutrients, and reduces loss to water.

====Constructed wetlands====
* Constructed wetlands located strategically on the landscape to process drainage effluent reduces sediment and nitrate loads to surface water.

<text>Mufasa is a fictional character in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Lion King&quot; franchise. A wise and benevolent lion, he first appears in the 1994 animated film as the King of the Pride Lands and devoted father to Simba, who he is raising to inherit the kingdom. Mufasa is killed by his younger brother, Scar, who murders him to usurp the throne. His death forces Simba into exile, but Mufasa&#x27;s spirit later appears to an adult Simba, urging him to return home and confront his responsibilities as his rightful heir. Mufasa was voiced by actor James Earl Jones.

Created by screenwriters Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts, and Linda Woolverton, Mufasa underwent several changes during production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Notably, the decision to make Mufasa and Scar brothers was intended to enhance the plot, and Mufasa was reintroduced as a spirit to give Simba a compelling reason to return to Pride Rock. The filmmakers extensively debated whether showing Mufasa&#x27;s death on-screen was suitable for a children&#x27;s film. Some writers suggested it should occur off-screen, but director Rob Minkoff insisted on depicting it explicitly, an unprecedented choice for an animated film. Mufasa&#x27;s animation, supervised by Tony Fucile, drew inspiration from Jones&#x27;s mannerisms and smile.

Jones received widespread acclaim for his performance. While some critics and audiences initially debated whether Mufasa&#x27;s death was too frightening for children—many comparing it to the death of Bambi&#x27;s mother in &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942)—the scene is retrospectively regarded as one of the most memorable deaths in film history, particularly resonating with millennials. Several publications have also celebrated Mufasa as one of the greatest fictional fathers in popular culture.

Mufasa&#x27;s likeness has appeared in various tie-in media and merchandise. Jones reprised his role in the 2019 remake of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, being the only main cast member from the original film to return, which became one of his final performances before he died in 2024. Actor Samuel E. Wright received a Tony Award nomination for originating the role on Broadway in the film&#x27;s 1997 stage adaptation. A prequel to the 2019 remake, &quot;&quot;, was released on December 20, 2024, and explores Mufasa&#x27;s upbringing.

== Role ==
In &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), King Mufasa rules over the Pride Lands alongside his mate, Queen Sarabi. Their young son, Simba, is destined to inherit the throne. Mufasa teaches Simba about the &quot;Circle of Life&quot; and the delicate balance required to maintain harmony in the Pride Lands. He advises Simba to prepare for the day when he will succeed him as king. However, Mufasa&#x27;s envious younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and devises a scheme to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba. Scar lures Simba into a gorge and orchestrates a wildebeest stampede, knowing Mufasa will risk his life to save his son. After rescuing Simba, Mufasa is swept into the stampede and struggles to escape. Reaching for Scar&#x27;s help at the gorge&#x27;s edge, Mufasa is betrayed as Scar claws his paws and pushes him to his death. Scar manipulates Simba into believing he is responsible for Mufasa&#x27;s death, prompting the guilt-ridden cub to flee the Pride Lands. Lost and alone, Simba finds refuge in the jungle, where he is raised by the carefree Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog. Despite his relaxed new lifestyle, Simba remains haunted by guilt over his father&#x27;s death. Years later, Simba encounters Rafiki, a wise mandrill who reveals that Mufasa&#x27;s spirit endures within him. Mufasa appears to Simba as a ghostly vision in the sky, urging him to accept his responsibilities and reclaim his place as king. Inspired, Simba returns to the Pride Lands, defeats Scar, and fulfills his destiny as Mufasa&#x27;s successor. In &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; (1998), Mufasa has a smaller role, appearing in the sky to offer guidance to Simba and communicating with Rafiki through the wind.

&quot;&quot; (2024) explores Mufasa&#x27;s backstory and how he became the King of the Pride Lands. The movie reveals that as a cub, Mufasa is swept away by a flood and separated from his parents Masego and Afia. He is adopted by a royal lion family, much to the leader, King Obasi&#x27;s, discontent. He grows up as a brother to Obasi&#x27;s son Taka. In adolescence, the pride is attacked by a group of white lions; Mufasa defends his adoptive mother Eshe and kills one of the white lions. Mufasa and Taka are told to leave and find a new home once Obasi discovers that the white lions intend on returning and seeking revenge, due to the group&#x27;s leader, Kiros, being the father of the lion slain by Mufasa.

Mufasa and Taka leave and are eventually joined by Sarabi, Zazu and Rafiki. They plan to go to a mythical place known as Milele. During the journey, Mufasa and Sarabi fall in love, much to Taka&#x27;s jealousy. Taka betrays Mufasa by letting Kiros know of their location by leaving tracks behind. Upon reaching Milele, the group are attacked by the white lions; Mufasa calls upon the animals of the land to help him defeat them. In the battle, Kiros pushes Mufasa into a cave where he is almost defeated; however, a remorseful Taka shields him from a blow, gaining his iconic scar across the face. The cave floods and Mufasa swims to safety after trapping and killing Kiros. Following the battle, Mufasa is reunited with Afia, and is told that Masego did not survive the flood. After being declared King of Milele, now known as the Pride Lands, Mufasa confronts Taka over his betrayal; he allows him to reside in the land, however christens Taka as Scar, vowing to never call him by his former name again. In the present day, Mufasa&#x27;s spirit appears before his granddaughter Kiara.

== Development ==

=== Creation ===
&quot;The Lion King&quot; was the first film released during the Disney Renaissance to focus on a father-son relationship, rather than a romantic one. Producer Don Hahn described the film as &quot;essentially a love story between a father and a son ... It&#x27;s about that moment in life when you realise that your father is going to pass on to you his wisdom and knowledge&quot;. In early drafts of the film, Mufasa was not related to Scar, but the producers decided that making these characters brothers would strengthen the story. However, the characters&#x27; physical appearances had already been finalized, leaving little family resemblance between the pair. According to director Rob Minkoff, they had always imagined that Mufasa accidentally gave Scar his eponymous scar when they were cubs. Although Mufasa and Scar refer to each other as &quot;brothers&quot; as members of the same pride, Hahn retrospectively suggested that Mufasa and Scar sharing parents would be unlikely because lion prides typically have only one adult male, with younger rogue lions often killing a pride&#x27;s patriarch and his offspring to assert dominance.

Screenwriter Linda Woolverton described writing Mufasa&#x27;s death as realizing they would need to make him &quot;the greatest father that ever lived&quot; for his death to feel particularly impactful. By the time Minkoff became involved, they had already decided Mufasa would die from a stampede, albeit in a less brutal manner. Death via stampede was chosen because lions lack natural predators. It was one of the few ideas that remained unchanged during production, although there were some early discussions brainstorming exactly how Mufasa should die. While doing research for the film, Woolverton suggested &quot;drowning&quot; Mufasa in a wildebeest stampede after seeing photographs of &quot;how frenetic and unstoppable&quot; wildebeests are when migrating. Minkoff lobbied in favor of exploring Mufasa&#x27;s death in more detail, which was unusual for an animated film at the time. The director also understood the risk of killing a character as important as Mufasa so late into the film, after viewers had already become attached.

Although they drew inspiration from the implied off-screen death of Bambi&#x27;s mother in &quot;Bambi&quot; (1942), Minkoff argued that &quot;The Lion King&quot; should confront Mufasa&#x27;s death more directly by having Simba interact with his dead body on-screen. According to art director Andy Gaskill, the decision to slowly reveal Mufasa&#x27;s corpse as the dust clears from the scene heightens its realism by allowing audiences and Simba to realize what has occurred simultaneously. The creative team was initially divided on whether showing Mufasa&#x27;s death was appropriate for the film&#x27;s target audience, and carefully re-wrote the scene to straddle &quot;&#x27;the sweet spot of emotion,&#x27; pushing just far enough without making the scene too overwhelming for its young audience&quot;. Despite its short length, Mufasa&#x27;s death required approximately 30 filmmakers and over two years to complete; it was the last scene finished, despite being the first storyboarded. Inbetweener Rachel Bibb was one of the crew members who remained shocked that Disney retained the sequence until the end of production.

Mufasa&#x27;s death prompted the filmmakers to conceive ways to lighten the film&#x27;s mood afterward. Minkoff suggested sending Simba into exile immediately, which allowed the emotional impact of Mufasa&#x27;s death to be alleviated by Timon and Pumbaa&#x27;s humor. Originally, they had not planned for Mufasa to reappear after dying, but they wanted Simba to have a valid reason to return to Pride Rock, and decided his father&#x27;s ghost should convince him. Mufasa&#x27;s death and return as a ghost are among several thematic similarities &quot;The Lion King&quot; shares with William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;, from which screenwriters Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts drew inspiration. However, they removed a version of Mufasa&#x27;s death that included the &quot;Hamlet&quot; line &quot;good night, sweet prince&quot; to avoid sounding &quot;too self-conscious&quot;. Animator Chris Sanders and story artist Brenda Chapman were responsible for drafting the scene where Mufasa&#x27;s spirit tells Simba to return home. Since it was one of the first scenes written for the film, Chapman wrote Mufasa&#x27;s dialogue repeating &quot;remember&quot; to call back to an earlier moment when Mufasa scolds Simba for visiting the elephant graveyard. She had intended for the dialogue to merely serve as a placeholder but it was ultimately retained. From the dialogue, Sanders determined that the character would manifest as either &quot;a lifelike ghost, a series of stars, or just a dark presence&quot; in the scene. To elevate his storyboards per the directors&#x27; feedback, Sanders drew inspiration from a musical excerpt from the film &quot;The Mission&quot; (1986), and used pastels &quot;to fully encapsulate a vision of Mufasa emerging from the clouds&quot;.

=== Voice ===
Actor Sean Connery was Disney&#x27;s initial choice to voice Mufasa, and Liam Neeson was also considered. Mufasa was voiced by American actor James Earl Jones, who Woolverton admitted was the stronger candidate despite Connery being her first choice. Disney said it was difficult to envision anyone other than Jones voicing Mufasa once the character was fully realized. Jones gravitated towards the role because he was impressed by drawings he had seen of Mufasa and relished the opportunity to create a character using only his voice, saying the process reminded him of his early work performing on radio. As a prolific thespian, he was also drawn to the film&#x27;s Shakespearean elements. He described voice acting as the &quot;purest form&quot; of acting, likening it to performing in ancient Greek theatre &quot;where the actors would wear masks. In our case, the masks are the animators&#x27; drawings and we just simply supply all the behaviors, emotions, and feelings behind that mask&quot;.Jones admitted to originally making the error of forcing his character to sound regal, which he corrected upon receiving direction to voice Mufasa as himself, who the actor described as more akin to &quot;a dopey dad&quot;. Jones explained that &quot;Fathers are not always grand, certainly not with their sons. When you accommodate being a father, you are often dopey and goofy. You are just Dad&quot;. Inspired by his revised tone of voice, the animators proceeded to incorporate Jones&#x27;s own facial expressions into Mufasa&#x27;s. Minkoff and co-director Roger Allers praised Jones&#x27;s work on the film, recalling that his vocal exercises alone &quot;sometimes sounded like a real lion with a rumbling growl&quot;. Allers said his voice would already echo throughout the studio without the aid of a microphone. Nonetheless, they strategically placed six microphones around his head to create the illusion that his voice was &quot;coming from everywhere&quot;. Jones worked on the film sporadically for over two years until Disney was satisfied. A song originally written for the character was not used in the final film once Disney realized Jones was unable to perform it. Entitled &quot;To Be King&quot;, it was ultimately reworked into &quot;I Just Can&#x27;t Wait To Be King&quot;, performed by Simba. Jones and actress Madge Sinclair, who voiced Sarabi, had previously played a king and queen couple in the romantic comedy film &quot;Coming to America&quot; (1988). The actor voiced the character again in tie-in projects such as &quot;The Lion King II: Simba&#x27;s Pride&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Lion Guard: Return of the Roar&quot; (2015).

In 2011, Jones said he would often prove to younger children that he was the voice of Mufasa by saying, in his character&#x27;s voice, &quot;Simba. You have deliberately disobeyed me&quot;. Jones was the only original cast member to reprise their role in the 2019 remake of &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The remake&#x27;s director, Jon Favreau, was surprised that he agreed to return. Out of respect and admiration for the actor, Favreau refused to give Jones direction regarding his performance, reassuring him that he already embodied the character. While most of the remake&#x27;s cast recorded together in a black box theater in California, Jones worked solo from a New York-based recording studio. Much of the character&#x27;s dialogue from the original film was also retained for the adaptation. The remake was one Jones&#x27;s his final film credits before his death on September 9, 2024.

Actor Aaron Pierre voiced the character in 2024&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, a prequel to the 2019 film, and cited Jones as one of his greatest inspirations. The prequel is dedicated to Jones&#x27;s memory. Although the veteran actor did not record any new material before he died, the film&#x27;s director, Barry Jenkins, insisted on opening the prequel with Jones&#x27;s speech from the original film, in which Mufasa explains to Simba that great kings from the past continue to watch over their descendants from the stars. Jenkins listened to all of Jones&#x27;s dialogue from the original film before making this selection.

=== Personality and design ===
Jones described Mufasa as an authoritative but ultimately gentle father. Jones&#x27;s staunch demeanor during recording sessions inspired supervising animator Tony Fucile. Fucile said Jones contributed both the regality and &quot;fatherly warmth&quot; the animators needed to create the character, explaining, &quot;it was up to us to visually come up to that standard that he set with his voice&quot;. Specifically, the animators incorporated the &quot;dopey smile&quot; Jones would wear during recording sessions into Mufasa&#x27;s face. Fucile found watching Jones&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Matewan&quot; (1987) to be particularly helpful because the actor &quot;used a lot of facial expressions and eye movements to communicate&quot;, mirroring Mufasa&#x27;s tendency to be subtle and convey a lot of emotion with little movement. The animators reused some design elements from Mufasa for adult Simba to make the latter look more heroic. Under Fucile, Phillip Young was another animator who worked on Mufasa, which Young referred to as his &quot;best character assignment&quot;. Prior to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, Young had mostly animated action scenes, some of which he also did for Mufasa, but he considers the character the first time &quot;in which I could exercise some acting chops&quot;. He also animated Mufasa&#x27;s stampede scenes, as well as some of his interactions with Simba.

Animator Chris Wahl specifically requested to work on Mufasa because he admired Fucile and Jones&#x27;s vocal performance. Despite the character&#x27;s lack of footage due to his smaller role and already having an established an animation team, the filmmakers allowed Wahl to help animate the character. Maquettes of Mufasa were created by animation sculptor Kent Melton.

== Reception ==
Critics and audiences initially expressed varying opinions about Mufasa&#x27;s death. According to Jessica Wang of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, no viewer was left &quot;emotionally unaffected&quot; in 1994. Dan Webster of &quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; called the moment &quot;a plot twist unfamiliar to this era of family-values emphasis&quot;. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, news outlets reported that several parents complained that the scene was inappropriate for a film marketed towards younger viewers, voicing concerns about children potentially experiencing nightmares, worrying about their own parents, and regressing. In return, some commentators accused said parents of being overprotective. According to Darryl E. Owens of &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot;, child-development experts warned that his death could be traumatizing should parents fail to prepare their children before viewing. However, child therapist Mercedes Ojeda-Castro encouraged parents to use the opportunity to discuss death, and psychologist Rosalyn Laudati countered that it could help children cope with their own parental losses and divorces. Several critics cited Mufasa&#x27;s death as potentially frightening for younger viewers. In his review for Prodigy, William C. Banks accused Disney of finally overdoing their &quot;increasingly weird predilection for cartoon violence&quot;. Journalist Janet Maslin questioned the film&#x27;s G rating, and the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;″s Jay Stone said the film &quot;could have done without&quot; Simba&#x27;s attempt to awaken his dead father. Ranking it among the most traumatic Disney film moments, Paolo Ragusa of &quot;Consequence&quot; said, &quot;It may be cruel, but with years of reflection, it&#x27;s a profoundly important detail in the scope of &quot;The Lion King&quot; ... and animated with palpable emotion and cinematic elegance&quot;. Several reviewers, such as Roger Ebert, compared Mufasa&#x27;s death to Bambi&#x27;s mother&#x27;s. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s Jeremy Gerard suggested that parents who remember being traumatized by &quot;Bambi&quot; should use the film to gauge &quot;who goes to &quot;The Lion King&quot;—and who stays home with the babysitter&quot;. However, Animation World Network&#x27;s Rick DeMott implied that the public&#x27;s reaction to Mufasa&#x27;s death was muted in comparison.

Rob Humanick of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; called Mufasa a &quot;badass father figure&quot;, but Stone found him one-dimensional. Meanwhile, Jones received critical acclaim for his performance, which Kaushal S. of Soap Central deemed one of the most celebrated voice-acting performances in recent memory. &quot;Digital Spy&quot;″s Simon Reynolds said Jones brought the character to life &quot;brilliantly&quot;. Film critic David Sterritt and Elizabeth Gregory of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; called him a standout among the film&#x27;s cast, while Kate Erbland of Film School Rejects called his casting &quot;both strikingly great and thuddingly obvious&quot;. Turner Classic Movies said the actor&#x27;s &quot;distinct baritone was put to excellent use&quot;. According to Daniel Carter of Beliefnet, Jones&#x27;s efforts resulted in &quot;a beloved character that resonated with audiences worldwide&quot;. Rebecca Kivak of &quot;The Scranton Times-Tribune&quot; said Mufasa&#x27;s delivery earned her immediate respect. João Gabriel de Lima of &quot;Veja&quot; called Jones the film&#x27;s standout performance, writing that Mufasa would have been less majestic without Jones&#x27; contribution. In a rare negative review, &quot;The Independent&quot;″s Anthony Quinn found Jones&#x27;s performance &quot;insufferable&quot; and &quot;portentous&quot;. Lex Pryor of &quot;The Ringer&quot; said Jones outshone his co-stars in the remake, despite his limited screentime and dialogue.

Several publications consider Mufasa to be one of Jones&#x27;s greatest performances of his career. Calling Mufasa one of &quot;pop culture&#x27;s most imposing dads&quot;, Noel Murray of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Few other performers of Jones&#x27;s era could have made characters so vivid while sitting in front of a microphone&quot;, while P. Ragusa of &quot;Consequence&quot; said the actor elevated the film&#x27;s material, with his line delivery remaining &quot;as poignant all these years later as it is necessary for the plot&quot;. &quot;Game Rant&quot; and &quot;Esquire Australia&quot; ranked &quot;The Lion King&quot; his best performance. Mary Kate Carr of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; said the actor &quot;imbued the character with such dignity and distinction&quot;, to the point where he speaks the film&#x27;s most iconic lines. Wilson Chapman of IndieWire said &quot;Few actors have ever been better suited for a voice role than Jones was for Mufasa&quot;, calling the actor equally effective during his quieter moments parenting Simba. According to &quot;Paste&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; is the actor&#x27;s six-best movie. Pinkvilla&#x27;s Suhasini Oswal wrote that his &quot;performance defined the character&#x27;s regal and compassionate nature, cementing his place in the hearts of generations&quot;.

== Cultural impact ==

=== Legacy and commendations ===
Matt Fowler of &quot;IGN&quot; described Mufasa as a household name, which he attributed to the popularity of his film and its derivative works. In 2014, Camille Dautrich of the &quot;Springfield News-Leader&quot; described Mufasa as one &quot;of the world&#x27;s most beloved animated characters&quot;. Reporting for &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, Nicole Pelletiere said his wisdom and legacy endeared him to Disney fans. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; ranked him the 30th &quot;best Disney animated character of all time&quot;, and &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked him 25th. Mufasa has been described by several publications as one of the greatest fathers to have appeared on film, with Zach Seemayer of &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; ranking him among &quot;the 13 greatest fictional fathers in movie history&quot;, and &quot;Business Insider&quot; calling him one of the 19 &quot;the best fictional dads of all time&quot;. PopSugar ranked him the fourth best Disney dad, calling him Disney&#x27;s &quot;dad of all dads&quot;. Jeff Peterson of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; said the character &quot;demonstrates the qualities of a good father, which, incidentally, are the same qualities needed for Simba to become a good ruler later on&quot;. In 2022, Indy100 recognized Mufasa as one of the 100 greatest on-screen fathers, and &quot;Euronews&quot; included him among &quot;The 12 best on-screen dads of all time&quot;. Ranking him the best movie dad, Ryan Christian of MovieWeb described Mufasa as &quot;the standard against which all movie dads are judged&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; named the character the fifth greatest movie father figure. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; ranked him the sixth &quot;coolest movie dad&quot;, and Brian Tallerico of &quot;Vulture&quot; declared Mufasa Disney&#x27;s most iconic father. &quot;America&quot; writer John Dougherty described Mufasa as &quot;graceful and dignified, but also warm and playful—the ideal father&quot;. Sandra Gonzalez of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; selected &quot;The Lion King&quot; as the &quot;one movie I&#x27;m going to watch on Father&#x27;s Day&quot; due to Mufasa&#x27;s love for Simba. Jenkins said that, to himself and others, Mufasa became &quot;synonymous with this idea of a surrogate father&quot;. Meanwhile, Maddie Garfinkle of &quot;People&quot; declared him &quot;one of the greatest kings&quot; in &quot;the history of animated cinema&quot;. Mufasa is &quot;one of the most famous lions of all time&quot;, according to Jenna Mullins of E!.

Mufasa was Jones&#x27;s most famous animated performance, and one of the most popular roles of his career. The character is credited with introducing Jones to a younger generation of filmgoers. According to Emma Saunders of BBC Online, he was &quot;loved by millions for voicing Mufasa&quot;. Carlos Morales of &quot;IGN&quot; called Mufasa &quot;his second most famous role&quot;, after Darth Vader from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. Comparing the two roles, Kofi Outlaw of ComicBook.com said that, with Mufasa, Jones successfully transitioned &quot;from being a nightmare bad dad in &quot;Star Wars&quot;, to being the dad every young cub (human or lion) wishes they had&quot;. Peter Debruge of &quot;Variety&quot; observed that which character Jones&#x27;s voice reminds fans of depends on whether the viewer was born before or after 1990. According to Morales, Jones&#x27;s voiceover work also &quot;brought credibility to a type of acting that still struggles to be respected to this day&quot;. In 2019, The Walt Disney Company inducted Jones as a Disney Legend in the &quot;voice&quot; category, for his &quot;remarkable contributions to the Disney legacy&quot;. Many celebrities shared tributes to Jones following the actor&#x27;s death on September 9, 2024, several of whom referenced &quot;The Lion King&quot;. Crystal Kung Minkoff, a television personality and Minkoff&#x27;s wife, posted a photo of Jones holding a Mufasa maquette with the caption &quot;Rest in Power, Mr Jones. You made a young animator&#x27;s dream come true when you accepted the role of Mufasa&quot;.

=== Death ===
Described by Isaac Williams of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; as &quot;one of the most impactful moments of any Disney film&quot;, Mufasa&#x27;s murder at the hands of Scar is widely regarded as one of the most memorable on-screen deaths in film history. The scenes comprising Mufasa&#x27;s death and Simba&#x27;s gradual realization have been described as inseparable from &quot;The Lion King&quot; franchise. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;″s Laura Bradley said his death &quot;became the benchmark against which all future film tragedies would be measured&quot;, comparing its legacy to that of Bambi&#x27;s mother. Although death and violence had already been depicted in children&#x27;s entertainment, Alex Spencer of &quot;The Escapist&quot; reported that nothing released before 1994 rivaled Mufasa&#x27;s immediate impact. Prior to Mufasa, deceased parents had typically died off-screen in Disney films, and &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; considers &quot;The Lion King&quot; to be the first Disney film from the modern era to depict trauma resulting from death. Josh Spiegel of &quot;/Film&quot; heralded &quot;The Lion King&quot; as the only Disney film that rivaled &quot;Bambi&quot;″s depiction of coming of age through tragedy. Writers for Legacy.com said both murders &quot;affected the children of their generations and the generations to follow&quot;. Jonathan Allford of &quot;The Guardian&quot; theorized that few preceding or subsequent parental deaths in Disney films have been as emotionally devastating as Mufasa&#x27;s, which he attributed to the character&#x27;s benevolence and audience connection. Pediatrician and writer Perri Klass said Mufasa&#x27;s death subverted the absent or dead mother trope in Disney films by embracing the &quot;90&#x27;s-style celebration of the involved dad&quot;. &quot;Collider&quot;&#x27;s Diego Pineda Pacheco observed that any conversation surrounding death in children&#x27;s media is virtually guaranteed to discuss &quot;The Lion King&quot;, and Gem Seddon of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked it film&#x27;s 20th saddest tearjerker.

Nadira Goffe of &quot;Slate&quot; said, as &quot;one of the first and most visceral main-character deaths we would experience&quot;, Mufasa &quot;traumatized an entire age group&quot;. Commentators agree that Mufasa&#x27;s death was particularly impactful on millennials, with Rachel Paige of HelloGiggles saying that, to them, it eclipses all other cinematic moments. Dougherty and Tyler Dane Wingco of &quot;Esquire Australia&quot; compared the phenomenon to the effect Bambi&#x27;s mother had on baby boomers. Rebecca Hawkes of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called &quot;The Lion King&quot; &quot;the defining cinematic shock of [millennial] youth&quot;, and writer Aisha Harris said his &quot;death served as their earliest encounter with the notion of losing a parent&quot;. According to Hollywood.com, Mufasa&#x27;s death was the aforementioned group&#x27;s &quot;first traumatizing cinematic event&quot;, and arguably their first time witnessing death. The website also considers Mufasa&#x27;s death children&#x27;s first confrontation with the reality that &quot;the hero doesn&#x27;t always triumph&quot;, prior to whom cartoon heroes typically escaped death at the last minute. Dougherty, Hollywood.com, Marisa Mirabal of &quot;/Film&quot;, and Elena Merenda of &quot;The Conversation&quot; each credited &quot;The Lion King&quot; with teaching 1990s children how to reconcile complicated emotions stemming from the deaths of loved ones, while &quot;/Film&quot;″s Hoai-Tran Bui said concepts such as death, loss, and grief were foreign to children until Mufasa. For &quot;Consequence&quot;, Dominick Mayer said the scene taught this generation about death, mortality, &quot;and the responsibilities that the living have to the dead they once loved&quot;. Spiegel suggested that modern Disney films should return to Mufasa&#x27;s example to abolish the &quot;Disney Death&quot; trope. Meanwhile, Panama Jackson of &quot;The Root&quot; called Mufasa&#x27;s death &quot;one of the most significant deaths in the black community of all time&quot;.

Scott Campbell of &quot;Far Out&quot; said that while Jones&#x27;s performance &quot;had already elevated Mufasa to iconic status&quot;, the character&#x27;s death cemented him in &quot;the minds of viewers everywhere&quot;, and consequently ranked him the eighth saddest death in film history. Readers of &quot;The Independent&quot; voted Mufasa &quot;the most iconic death scene&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Mufasa&#x27;s death &quot;Disney&#x27;s Most Traumatic Movie Moment&quot;, with author Lucy O&#x27;Brien writing that &quot;a little bit of innocence in every child ... withered away forever&quot;. Despite ranking it the third most powerful animated death, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Jonathan W. Gray called it arguably the most impactful one discussed. &quot;Best Life&quot; ranked it the 16th all-time saddest movie death.

=== In other media ===

To promote the release of &quot;The Lion King&quot; in 1994, Mufasa began appearing in a plethora of merchandise licensed by Disney Consumer Products. Mufasa&#x27;s likeness has been used in several &quot;The&quot; &quot;Lion King&quot; tie-in products and media, including the PC game &quot;Disney&#x27;s Animated Storybook: The Lion King&quot; (1994) and console game &quot;The Lion King: Simba&#x27;s Mighty Adventure&quot; (2000). From 1995 to 2018, Mufasa provided the opening narration for the Epcot documentary &quot;Circle of Life: An Environmental Fable&quot;. In 2019, a Funko Pop! figurine was released to commemorate the remake, which &quot;Screen Rant&quot; ranked among &quot;The 10 Best Disney Funko Pops&quot;. In 1997, actor Samuel E. Wright originated the role of Mufasa on Broadway in the stage adaptation of the film. Prior to &quot;The Lion King&quot;, he had voiced Sebastian in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (1989). Mufasa&#x27;s role in the show was expanded with the addition of the original songs &quot;The Morning Report&quot; and &quot;They Live in You&quot;. Wright was initially reluctant to audition, fearing the role would be too similar to playing the Cowardly Lion from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939) or the Beast from &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1994), but relented once he saw director Julie Taymor&#x27;s plans for the character&#x27;s design and costume. He based his performance on Masai warriors who hunted lions, and learned to growl by researching lions at the Bronx Zoo. He also received physiotherapy regularly due to the physical demands of the role. Wright&#x27;s performance received positive reviews from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot; theater critics. In 1998, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. The character recurs in some episodes of the animated television series &quot;The Lion Guard&quot; (2016–2019), voiced by Gary Anthony Williams.

Outside of &quot;The Lion King&quot; franchise, the character has appeared in the television series &quot;Disney&#x27;s House of Mouse&quot; (2001) and the video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot; (2006). In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &#x27;&quot;Round Springfield&quot; (1995), Mufasa appears in the clouds to Lisa Simpson, alongside Darth Vader and Jones. All three characters are voiced by &quot;Simpsons&quot; cast member Harry Shearer, despite Jones himself having guest starred on three earlier &quot;Simpsons&quot; episodes. In &quot;Round Springfield&quot;, Mufasa mistakenly says the name &quot;Kimba&quot; before correcting himself to &quot;Simba&quot;, which parodies allegations that &quot;The Lion King&quot; was inspired by the anime &quot;Kimba the White Lion&quot;. Chance the Rapper has referenced Mufasa in several of his songs, including &quot;I Am Very Very Lonely&quot; (2014), &quot;Blessings&quot; (2016), and &quot;How Great&quot; (2016). The rapper said he has always likened the character to his own father, and believes Mufasa &quot;was a lot of young black boys&#x27; depiction of growing into manhood&quot;. He found himself identifying with Mufasa once he became a father himself. The character has also been name-dropped in songs by hip hop artists Wu-Tang Clan, Nicki Minaj, Smino, and Waka Flocka Flame.

&quot;&quot;, a prequel to the 2019 remake, was released on December 20, 2024, and focuses on Mufasa&#x27;s childhood, relationships, and major events that ultimately lead to him becoming King of the Pride Lands. In this version, Mufasa is revealed to be an orphan born outside of the royal family, and explores his relationship with Taka, the character who adopts him as a brother and ultimately becomes &quot;Scar&quot;.

<text>The River Irthing is a river in Cumbria, England and a major tributary of the River Eden. The name is recorded as Ard or Arden in early references. For the first 15 miles of its course it defines the border between Northumberland and Cumbria.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Irthing&quot; may be of Brittonic origin, though its precise etymology is uncertain. The last part of the name is from &quot;–ïnn&quot;, an adjectival and, in place-names, toponymic suffix, added to nouns or adjectives. The first part may be &quot;arth&quot;, meaning &quot;a bear&quot; (c.f. Welsh &quot;arth&quot;). Or else, the first part of the name could either one of two elements suffixed with &quot;-ed&quot;, an early Celtic nominal suffix meaning &quot;having the quality of..&quot;. The first of these is, &quot;*ar&quot;, an ancient river-naming element implying either horizontal motion, &quot;flowing&quot;, or else &quot;rising&quot; or &quot;springing up&quot; (compare &quot;Irt&quot;). The second possibility is &quot;*īr&quot;, meaning &quot;fresh, clean, pure&quot;.

== Geography == 
It is thought that before the last glacial maximum the Irthing flowed into the South Tyne valley through the watershed near Greenhead, now known as the Tyne Gap. This section of the valley is now blocked by a filling of glacial till, diverting the river south west, but the old course has been detected by drilling and echo-sounding. The rapidly eroding cliffs threatening the southern edge of Birdoswald Roman Fort and the fact that the Roman bridge abutment at Willowford is now 44 m (144.4 ft) from the river testify to the instability of the local landscape as it continues to recover from glacial alteration.

The river rises on Paddaburn Moor in Kielder Forest and skirts the eastern edge of Butterburn Flow raised bog. Remains of numerous mediaeval shielings have been found along the banks of these upper reaches, some of which have been given ancient monument status.

For two miles above the village of Gilsland the river flows through the Irthing Gorge , flanked by mainly sandstone crags. Within the upper section of this gorge lies the spectacular 7.6 metre (25 feet) Crammel Linn waterfall. Peregrine falcons and ravens nest near the waterfall and derelict military structures, probably pump-houses supplying water for the Blue Streak rocket site at RAF Spadeadam, can be seen just upstream. Further downstream, in the grounds of Gilsland Spa hotel, the crags develop into high cliffs. The cliff face below the hotel gives rise to the famous sulphurous spring after which the hotel is named and also a chalybeate spring and a petrifying seep.

Hadrian&#x27;s Wall crossed the river on a bridge at Willowford, 0.75 kilometres (0.5 miles) east of Birdoswald Roman Fort. From that point the course of the river as it turns west is lined with other Roman sites associated with the Roman Stanegate road and Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. A 914-metre (2,998.7 feet) stretch of Wall, including two turrets and the impressive bridge remains, runs alongside the River Irthing at Willowford, linked by a new footbridge to Birdoswald Roman Fort. This crossing of the River Irthing marked a significant transition in the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, emphasising the greater availability of building stone to the east.

Passing Brampton the Irthing merges with the River Gelt, and soon after meets the River Eden near Warwick Bridge, just north of Wetheral.

<text>Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof (&quot;Leipzig Bavarian station&quot;) is Germany&#x27;s oldest preserved railway station, located in Leipzig, Germany, in the southeastern part of the district Mitte. The station was first opened in 1842 for the Leipzig–Hof railway by the &quot;Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company&quot; (), later taken over by the Royal Saxon State Railways (&quot;Königlich Sächsische Staatseisenbahnen&quot;) and operated as the &quot;Saxon-Bavarian State Railways&quot; (&quot;Sächsisch-Bayerische Staatseisenbahn&quot;).

The station was closed in 2001 for the construction of the Leipzig City Tunnel. It re-opened on 15 December 2013 after the completion of the tunnel. Since then it has been integrated into S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland system. The new station is built directly underneath the site of the former station.

The buildings on the west side of the station were renovated in 1999 and are now used by the &quot;Bayerischer Bahnhof Gose Brewery and Gasthaus.&quot;

==Train services==
Leipzig Bayerischer Bahnhof station is served by seven of the ten S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland lines. Planners hope that the high frequency service and fast journey times will increase passenger capacity on the city&#x27;s public transport and thus relieve road traffic in the city.

The following services currently call at the station:

<doc id="921111" wikidata="Q335593" url="?curid=921111" title="Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell">
<text>Frederick Alexander Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell, ( ; 5 April 18863 July 1957) was a British physicist who was prime scientific adviser to Winston Churchill in World War II.

He was involved in the development of radar and infra-red guidance systems. He was sceptical of the first reports of the enemy&#x27;s V-weapons programme. He pressed the case for the strategic area bombing of cities.

His abiding influence on Churchill stemmed from close personal friendship, as a member of the latter&#x27;s country-house set. In Churchill&#x27;s second government, he was given a seat in the cabinet, and later created Viscount Cherwell of Oxford.

==Early life, family and personality==
Lindemann was the second of three sons of Adolph Friedrich Lindemann, who had emigrated to the United Kingdom circa 1871 and became naturalised. Frederick was born in Baden-Baden in Germany, where his American mother Olga Noble, the widow of a wealthy banker, was taking &quot;the cure&quot;.

After schooling in Scotland and Darmstadt, he attended the University of Berlin, where he studied under Walther Nernst. He carried out research in physics at the Sorbonne that confirmed theories, first put forward by Albert Einstein, on specific heats at very low temperatures. For this and other scientific work, Lindemann was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1920.

In 1911 he was invited to the Solvay Conference on &quot;Radiation and the Quanta&quot;, where he was the youngest attendee.

He was known to friends as &quot;the Prof&quot; in reference to his position at the University of Oxford, and as &quot;Baron Berlin&quot; to his many detractors because of his German accent and haughty aristocratic manner.

Lindemann believed that a small circle of the intelligent and the aristocratic should run the world, resulting in a peaceable and stable society, &quot;led by supermen and served by helots.&quot; Some sources claim that he was Jewish, but Frederick Smith&#x27;s official biography declares that he was not.

Lindemann supported eugenics, held the working class, homosexuals, and black people in contempt, and supported sterilisation of the mentally incompetent. He believed – Mukerjee concludes, referring to Lindemann&#x27;s lecture on Eugenics – that Science could yield a race of humans blessed with &#x27;the mental make-up of the worker bee&#x27; ... At the lower end of the race and class spectrum, one could remove the ability to suffer or to feel ambition ... Instead of subscribing to what he called &#x27;the fetish of equality&#x27;, Lindemann recommended that human differences should be accepted and indeed enhanced by means of science. It was no longer necessary, he wrote, to wait for &#x27;the haphazard process of natural selection to ensure that the slow and heavy mind gravitates to the lowest form of activity.&#x27;

==First World War and the University of Oxford==
At the outbreak of the First World War, Lindemann was playing tennis in Germany and had to leave in haste to avoid internment. In 1915 he joined the staff of the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough. He developed a mathematical theory of aircraft spin recovery and later learned to fly so that he could test his ideas himself. Prior to Lindemann&#x27;s work, a spinning aircraft was almost invariably irrecoverable and the result to the pilot fatal.

In 1919, Lindemann was appointed professor of experimental philosophy (physics) at the University of Oxford and director of the Clarendon Laboratory, largely on the recommendation of Henry Tizard, who had been a colleague in Berlin. Also in 1919, he was one of the first to suggest that an electrically neutral wind of positively charged protons and electrons is emitted from the Sun. He may have been unaware that Kristian Birkeland had speculated three years earlier that the solar wind might be a mixture of positively and negatively charged particles. At the same time he worked on the theory of specific heats and on temperature inversion in the stratosphere, and began to bring the two scientific disciplines together. In the field of chemical kinetics, he proposed the Lindemann mechanism in 1921 for unimolecular chemical reactions, and showed that the first step is one of bimolecular activation.

Around this time, Clementine Churchill – the wife of Winston, at that time a government minister – partnered with Lindemann for a charity tennis match. Although the two men had very different lifestyles, they both excelled at a sport: Churchill&#x27;s was polo. Lindemann&#x27;s ability to explain scientific issues concisely, and his excellent flying skills, probably impressed Churchill, who had given up trying to earn a pilot&#x27;s licence because of Clementine&#x27;s grave concerns. They became close friends and remained so for 35 years, with Lindemann visiting Chartwell more than 100 times from 1925 to 1939. Lindemann opposed the General Strike of 1926, and mobilised the reluctant staff of the Clarendon to produce copies of Churchill&#x27;s anti-strike newspaper, the &quot;British Gazette&quot;. Lindemann was also alarmed and fearful of political developments in Germany.

In the 1930s, Lindemann advised Winston Churchill when the latter was out of Government – the &quot;Wilderness Years&quot; – and leading a campaign for rearmament. He appointed to the Clarendon one of Churchill&#x27;s social set, the young Welshman Derek Jackson. This brilliant young physicist, the son of Sir Charles Jackson, transferred from the Nobel prize-winning labs at Cambridge and worked on Lindemann&#x27;s top-secret nuclear energy projects.

Lindemann moved in rich circles at Biddesden, the Earl of Iveagh&#x27;s home, hosted with painter Augustus John and literary luminaries Lytton Strachey, John Betjeman, Evelyn Waugh, the Carringtons and the Mitfords, the Sitwells and the Huxley families. One frequently intoxicated visitor was a wayward Randolph Churchill.

In 1932, Lindemann joined Winston to complete a road trip throughout Europe and they were dismayed at what they saw. Churchill later said, &quot;A terrible process is astir. Germany is arming.&quot; Lindemann was prevailed upon to release Jackson in 1940 to join the RAF; Jackson flew in the Battle of Britain and won a DFC. Lindemann also assisted the new Prime Minister in the rescue of a number of German Jewish physicists, primarily at the University of Göttingen, who immigrated to Britain; they assisted the vital war work developing at the Clarendon Laboratory, including the Manhattan Project.

Churchill got Lindemann onto the &quot;Committee for the Study of Aerial Defence&quot; which under Sir Henry Tizard was putting its resources behind the development of radar. Lindemann&#x27;s presence was disruptive, insisting instead that his own ideas of aerial mines and infra-red beams be given priority over radar. To resolve the situation, the committee dissolved itself to reform as a new body without him. He stayed in close contact with the Jacksons at Rignell Farm, who enriched a poor wartime diet with dairy products they brought into Oxford themselves.

==Second World War==

When Churchill became Prime Minister, he appointed Lindemann as the British government&#x27;s leading scientific adviser, with David Bensusan-Butt as his private secretary. Lindemann attended meetings of the War Cabinet, accompanied the prime minister on conferences abroad, and sent him an average of one missive a day. He saw Churchill almost daily for the duration of the war, and wielded more influence than any other civilian adviser. He would hold this office again for the first two years of Churchill&#x27;s 1951 peacetime administration.

Lindemann established a special statistical branch, known as &#x27;S-Branch&#x27;, within the government, constituted from subject specialists, and reporting directly to Churchill. This branch scrutinised the performance of the regular ministries and prioritised the logistical machinery of warfare. S-Branch distilled thousands of sources of data into succinct charts and figures, so that the status of the nation&#x27;s food supplies (for example) could be instantly evaluated.

The bar charts now on display in the Cabinet War Rooms which compare Allied shipping tonnage lost to new ships delivered each month, and those comparing bomb tonnage dropped by Germany on Britain with that dropped by the Allies on Germany each month, are testaments to both the intellectual and the psychological power of his statistical presentations. Lindemann&#x27;s statistical branch often caused tensions between government departments, but because it allowed Churchill to make quick decisions based on accurate data which directly affected the war effort, its importance should not be underestimated.

In 1940, Lindemann supported the experimental department MD1. He worked on hollow charge weapons, the sticky bomb and other new weapons. General Ismay, who supervised MD1, recalled:

With power, Lindemann was able to sideline Tizard; especially after Tizard did not acknowledge that the Germans were using radio navigation to bomb Britain.

Lindemann has been described as having &quot;an almost pathological hatred for Nazi Germany, and an almost medieval desire for revenge was a part of his character&quot;. Fearing food shortages in Britain, he convinced Churchill to divert 56 percent of the British merchant ships operating in the Indian Ocean to the Atlantic, a move that added two million tons of wheat as well as raw materials for war fighting to stocks in Britain, The Ministry of War Transport warned that such dramatic cuts to shipping capacity in South East Asia would &quot;portend violent changes and perhaps cataclysms in the seaborne trade of large numbers of countries&quot; but the Ministry was ignored. The &quot;menace of famine suddenly loomed up like a hydra-headed monster with a hundred clamouring mouths&quot; according to C. B. A. Behrens in the official history of Allied merchant shipping. It has been estimated between 1.5 and 4 million people died during the Bengal famine of 1943, despite the fact that food stocks continued to be produced and shipped out of the Indian subcontinent to Europe. Cherwell and Churchill&#x27;s policies contributed heavily to the severity of the famine. Kenya, Tanganyika and Somaliland also suffered famine that year.

===Strategic bombing===

Following the Air Ministry Area bombing directive on 12 February 1942, Lindemann presented in a paper on &quot;Dehousing&quot; to Churchill on 30 March 1942, which calculated the effects of area bombardment by a massive bomber force on German cities to break the spirit of the people. His proposal that &quot;bombing must be directed to working class houses. Middle class houses have too much space round them, so are bound to waste bombs&quot; changed accepted conventions of limiting civilian casualties in wartime&quot;. His dehousing paper was criticised by many other scientific minds in government service, who felt such a force would be a waste of resources.

Lindemann&#x27;s paper was based on the incorrect premise that strategic bombing could cause a breakdown in German morale. Despite this, his arguments were used in support of Bomber Command&#x27;s claim for priority in allocation of resources. Lindemann played an important part in the battle of the beams, championing countermeasures against German radio navigation devices to increase the precision of their bombing campaigns. He almost undermined the vital work of Sir Henry Tizard and his team who developed all the important radar technology.

===V-2 rocket===
Lindemann argued against the rumoured existence of the V-2 rocket, asserting it was &quot;a great hoax to distract our attention from some other weapon.&quot; He mistakenly concluded that &quot;to put a four-thousand horsepower turbine in a twenty-inch space is lunacy: it couldn&#x27;t be done, Mr. Lubbock&quot; and that at the end of the war, the committee would find that the rocket was &quot;a mare&#x27;s nest&quot;.

Lindemann took the view that long-range military rockets were feasible only if they were propelled by solid fuels and would need to be of enormous size. He rejected arguments that relatively compact liquid fuels could be used to propel such weapons. In fairness, &quot;Cherwell [Lindemann] had strong scientific grounds for doubting the forecasts that were being made of a 70–80 ton rocket with a 10 ton warhead&quot;. A pivotal exchange where Churchill rebuffed Lindemann occurred at the Cabinet Defence Committee (Operations) meeting on 29 June 1943, and was dramatised in the film &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot;.

==Political career==
Lindemann&#x27;s political career was a result of his close friendship with Winston Churchill, who protected Lindemann from the many in the British government he had snubbed and insulted. &quot;Love me, love my dog, and if you don&#x27;t love my dog, you damn well can&#x27;t love me,&quot; Churchill reportedly said to a member of Parliament who had questioned his reliance on Lindemann, and later to the same MP Churchill added, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that he is one of my oldest and greatest friends?&quot;.

In July 1941 Lindemann was raised to the peerage as Baron Cherwell, of Oxford in the County of Oxford. The following year he was made Paymaster General by Churchill, an office he retained until 1945. In 1943 he was also sworn of the Privy Council. When Churchill returned as Prime Minister in 1951, Lindemann was again appointed Paymaster-General, this time with a seat in the cabinet. He continued in this post until October 1953. In 1956 he was made Viscount Cherwell of Oxford, in the County of Oxford. Lindemann enthusiastically supported the controversial Morgenthau Plan, which Churchill subsequently endorsed on 15 September 1944. Following his 1945 return to the Clarendon Laboratory, Lindemann created the Atomic Energy Authority.

==Personal life==
Lindemann was a teetotaller, non-smoker and a vegetarian, although Churchill would sometimes induce him to take a glass of brandy. He was an excellent pianist, and sufficiently able as a tennis player to compete at Wimbledon.

Lindemann, or the &quot;Prof&quot;, never married. In his younger years, he had pursued two romantic interests but was rejected on both occasions. When he was 49, Lindemann became entranced with the 27-year-old Lady Elizabeth Lindsay, daughter of David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford. One day in February 1937, he learnt from Lady Elizabeth&#x27;s father that, while travelling in Italy, she had fallen ill with pneumonia and died; upon the news of her death, Lindemann withdrew from his romantic pursuits and chose to spend the rest of his life alone.

Lindemann died in his sleep at Oxford on 3 July 1957, aged 71, one year after becoming Viscount Cherwell, at which point the barony and viscountcy became extinct.

<doc id="921114" wikidata="Q656983" url="?curid=921114" title="1984 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1984 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the &quot;XXIII Olympiad&quot;, were a summer multi-sport event held in Los Angeles, California, United States, from July 28 to August 12. A total of 6,829 athletes from 140 nations participated in 221 events in 21 sports.

Overall, 47 nations received at least one medal, and 25 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from host nation United States won the most medals overall, with 174, and the most gold medals, with 83. The former record was the largest overall medal haul for the nation since the 1904 edition; the latter record was the highest gold medal tally at a single Games in Olympic history and the most for a host nation. It marked the first time the United States led the medal count in both gold and overall medals since 1968. Sports commentators noted that the absence of the Soviet Union and various other Eastern Bloc nations stemming from a boycott contributed to the highly skewed medal results benefitting the United States and other countries. Romania won the second most gold medals (20) and the third most total medals (53), marking its highest medal tally in history. West Germany won the third most gold medals, with 17, and the second most total medals, with 59.

Runner Carl Lewis and gymnast Ecaterina Szabo won the most gold medals at the games with four each. Gymnast Li Ning won the greatest number of medals overall, winning six in total. Morocco and Portugal won their first Olympic gold medals. Algeria, Dominican Republic, Ivory Coast, Syria, and Zambia won their nation&#x27;s first Olympic medals.

==Medal table==


The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. 

In the boxing and judo events, two bronze medals are awarded in each weight class. Two gold medals (and no silver medals) were awarded for first place ties in the women&#x27;s uneven bars, women&#x27;s balance beam, and men&#x27;s rings gymnastics events. Four silver medals (and no bronze) were awarded in the men&#x27;s vault gymnastics competition. Two bronze medals were awarded for third-place ties in both the women&#x27;s 100 metre hurdles and the men&#x27;s pole vault competitions.

<text>The Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc or simply Hôtel du Cap is a resort hotel in Antibes on the French Riviera. Opened in 1870 as a private mansion under the name Villa Soleil, it became a hotel in 1889.

==History==
The founder of France&#x27;s &quot;Le Figaro&quot; newspaper, Hippolyte de Villemessant, built the Villa Soleil in 1869 for writers seeking inspiration. In 1887, Italian hotelier Antoine Sella bought the property, and opened the Grand Hôtel du Cap in 1889. 

In 1914, the Eden Roc pavilion (event space) was built 400 yards away from the main hotel. Gerald and Sara Murphy, a young American couple who had expatriated to France in the 1920s, once rented the hotel for an entire summer, a unique event for the era as the French Riviera was not a summer destination at the time, but a winter escape for the wealthy. With the Murphys came many writers and artists of the Lost Generation, including F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. Fitzgerald immortalized it as the Hôtel des Etrangers in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;. Marc Chagall made sketches in one of the shady beachside cabanas after their construction in the 1960s. 

In 1931, when Antoine (Antonio) Sella died, the running of the hotel passed to his son André (Andrea) who developed the hotel to a new level. The Kennedy family summered here in 1938 when John F. Kennedy was 21 years old. Guests included Marlene Dietrich, Orson Welles, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Winston Churchill and Charles De Gaulle. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton conducted an affair and honeymooned there.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/guest-book&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hotel has traditionally been a particular favourite of film stars, especially during the annual Cannes Film Festival.

In 1964, Rudolf August Oetker, a German industrialist, and his wife Maja von Malaisé first spotted the mansion while sailing on the Côte d&#x27;Azur in 1964; they bought the hotel five years later after the death of André Sella.

In 1985, some scenes in the film, &quot;Under the Cherry Moon&quot;, starring and directed by Prince, were filmed at the hotel. In one of the more notable scenes, Prince and co-star Kristin Scott Thomas danced on the picturesque deck at the Eden Roc restaurant to Prince&#x27;s musical ballad Alexa de Paris, as they bantered wittily toward an impending courtship in the film.

For many years the hotel did not accept credit cards. Only cash was accepted, with most guests wiring money ahead of their stay. In 2006, this policy was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrylife/hotel-du-cap&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, TVs were installed. In 2013, guest&#x27;s hand-drawn selfies included Conan O’Brien, Johnny Depp and Pelé.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/WINTER-LUXURY&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, the Hôtel du Cap-Eden Roc was hosting, on its principal driveway to the sea, the Croisière 2011–2012 Collection of the Chanel couture house. It also was the scene for designer Karl Lagerfeld&#x27;s 2011 short-film &quot;The Tale of a Fairy&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;CHANEL/Fairy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; featuring actors and models including Freja Beha, Bianca Balti, Amanda Harlech, Anna Mouglalis, Kristen McMenamy, Baptiste Giabiconi, , and Mark Vanderloo.&lt;ref name=&quot;ELLE/Fairy-Tale&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BAZAAR/Lagerfeld/Fairy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

For about twenty years, amfAR, a nonprofit devoted to AIDS research, has held a charity auction at the Hôtel du Cap-Eden-Roc as part of its annual Cinema Against AIDS event at the Cannes Film Festival.

==Amenities==
The property is composed of 5 buildings:

<doc id="921121" wikidata="Q60570" url="?curid=921121" title="Leo Frobenius">
<text>Leo Viktor Frobenius (29 June 1873 – 9 August 1938) was a German self-taught ethnologist and archaeologist and a major figure in German ethnography.

==Life==
He was born in Berlin as the son of a Prussian officer and died in Biganzolo, Lago Maggiore, Piedmont, Italy. He undertook his first expedition to Africa in 1904 to the Kasai district in Congo, formulating the African Atlantis theory during his travels.

During World War I, between 1916 and 1917, Leo Frobenius spent almost an entire year in Romania, travelling with the German Army for scientific purposes, as well as undertaking covert missions in Arabia and Ethiopia in 1914-1915. His team performed archaeological and ethnographic studies in the country, as well as documenting the day-to-day life of the ethnically diverse inmates of the Slobozia prisoner camp. Numerous photographic and drawing evidences of this period exist in the image archive of the Frobenius Institute.

Until 1918 he travelled in the western and central Sudan, and in northern and northeastern Africa. In 1920 he founded the &quot;Institute for Cultural Morphology&quot; in Munich.

Frobenius taught at the University of Frankfurt. In 1925, the city acquired his collection of about 4700 prehistorical African stone paintings, kept at the University&#x27;s institute of ethnology, which was named the Frobenius Institute in his honour in 1946.

In 1932 he became honorary professor at the University of Frankfurt, and in 1935 director of the municipal ethnographic museum.

==Theories==
Frobenius was influenced by Richard Andree, and his own teacher Friedrich Ratzel.

In 1897/1898 Frobenius defined several &quot;culture circles&quot; (&quot;Kulturkreise&quot;), cultures showing similar traits that have been spread by diffusion or invasion. Bernhard Ankermann was also influential in this area.

A meeting of the Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology and Prehistory was held on November 19, 1904, which was to become historical. On this occasion Fritz Graebner read a paper on &quot;Cultural cycles and cultural strata in Oceania&quot;, and Bernhard Ankermann lectured on &quot;Cultural cycles and cultural strata in Africa&quot;. Even today these lectures by two assistants of the Museum of Ethnology in Berlin are frequently considered the beginning of research on cultural history, although in fact Frobenius&#x27; book &quot;Der Ursprung der afrikanischen Kulturen&quot; could claim this honour for itself.
With his term &quot;paideuma&quot;, Frobenius wanted to describe a , a manner of creating meaning (&quot;Sinnstiftung&quot;), that was typical of certain economic structures. Thus, the Frankfurt cultural morphologists tried to reconstruct &quot;the&quot; world-view of hunters, early planters, and megalith-builders or sacred kings. This concept of culture as a living organism was continued by his most devoted disciple, Adolf Ellegard Jensen, who applied it to his ethnological studies. It also later influenced the theories of Oswald Spengler.

His writings with Douglas Fox were a channel through which some African traditional storytelling and epic entered European literature. This applies in particular to &quot;Gassire&#x27;s lute&quot;, an epic from West Africa which Frobenius had encountered in Mali. Ezra Pound corresponded with Frobenius from the 1920s, initially on economic topics. The story made its way into Pound&#x27;s &quot;Cantos&quot; through this connection.

In the 1930s, Frobenius claimed that he had found proof of the existence of the lost continent of Atlantis.

==African Atlantis==
&quot;African Atlantis&quot; is the term proposed by Frobenius around 1904 for a civilization evidenced in the archeology of northwestern Atlantic Africa. Named after the mythical Atlantis, this lost civilization was conceived as influencing subsequent African culture in the area. Frobenius hypothesizes, on the basis of suggestive characteristics of the artifacts, that they reflect contact with a seafaring civilization from Europe, whether Atlantic or Mediterranean, and whether through trade, trade enclaves, or colonies. In Frobenius&#x27; view this contact must have occurred in the second millennium B.C., preceding the Phoenician diaspora. Whatever the character of the contact, it would have disappeared many centuries B.C., but leaving traces of its influences in subsequent cultural evolution in the area.

==Legacy== 
Due to his studies in African history, Frobenius remains a figure of renown in many African countries. In particular, he influenced Léopold Sédar Senghor, one of the founders of Négritude, who once claimed that Frobenius had &quot;given Africa back its dignity and identity.&quot; Aimé Césaire quoted Frobenius as praising African people &quot;civilized to the marrow of their bones&quot;(&quot;Discourse on Colonialism&quot;), instead of the degrading vision encouraged by colonial propaganda.

On the other hand, Wole Soyinka, in his 1986 Nobel Lecture, criticized Frobenius for his &quot;schizophrenic&quot; view comparing Yoruba art and artists. Quoting Frobenius&#x27;s statement that &quot;I was moved to silent melancholy at the thought that this assembly of degenerate and feeble-minded posterity should be the legitimate guardians of so much loveliness,&quot; Soyinka called such sentiments &quot;a direct invitation to a free-for-all race for dispossession, justified on the grounds of the keeper&#x27;s unworthiness.&quot;

Otto Rank relied on Frobenius&#x27; reports of the Fanany burial in Madagascar to develop his idea of macrocosm and microcosm in his book &quot;Art and Artist&quot; (&quot;Kunst und Künstler&quot; [1932])

&quot;Certainly the idea of the womb as an animal has been widespread among different races of all ages, and it &#x27;furnishes an explanation of (for instance) the second burial custom discovered by Frobenius along with the Fanany burial in South Africa. This consisted in placing the dead king&#x27;s body in an artificially emptied bull&#x27;s skin in such a manner that the appearance of life was achieved. This bull-rite was undoubtedly connected with the moon-cult (compare mooncalf) and belongs therefore to the maternal culture-stage, at which the rebirth idea also made use of maternal animal symbols, the larger mammals being chosen. Yet the &quot;mother&#x27;s womb symbolism&quot; denotes more than the mere repetition of a person&#x27;s own birth: it stands for the overcoming of human mortality by assimilation to the moon&#x27;s immortality. This sewing-up of the dead in the animal skin has its mythical counterpart in the swallowing of the living by a dangerous animal, out of which he escapes by a miracle. Following an ancient microcosmic symbolism, Anaximander compared the mother&#x27;s womb with the shark. This conception is later found in religious form as the Jonah myth, and also appears in a cosmological adaptation in the whale myths collected in Oceania by Frobenius. Hence, the frequent suggestion that the seat of the soul after death (macrocosmic underworld) is in the belly of an animal (fish, dragon). The fact that in these traditions the animals are always those dangerous to man indicates that the animal womb is regarded not only as the scene of a potential rebirth but also as that of a dreaded mortality, and it is this which led to all the cosmic assimilations to the immortal stars.&quot;

Frobenius also confirmed the role of the moon cult in African cultures, according to Rank:

&quot;Bachofen [Johann Jakob Bachofen (1815-1887)] was the first to point out this connexion in the ancient primitive cultures in his Mutterrecht, but it has since received widespread corroboration from later researchers, in particular Frobenius, who discovered traces of a matriarchal culture in prehistoric Africa (Das unbekannte Afrika, Munich, 1923).&quot;

Frobenius&#x27; work gave Rank insight into the double meaning of the king&#x27;s ritual murder, and the cultural development of soul belief:

&quot;Certain African traditions (Frobenius: Erythraa) lead to the assumption that the emphasizing of one or another of the inherent tendencies of the ritual was influenced by the character of the slain king, who in one case may have been feared and in another wanted back again.&quot;

&quot;The Fanany myth, mentioned below, of the Betsileo in Madagascar shows already a certain progress from the primitive worm to the soul-animal. The Betsileo squeeze the putrefying liquid out of the bodies of the dead at the feet and catch it in a small jar. After two or three months a worm appears in it and is regarded as the spirit of the dead. This jar is then placed in the grave, where the corpse is laid only after the appearance of the Fanany. A bamboo rod connects the jar with the fresh air (corresponding to the &quot; soulholes&quot; of Northern stone graves). After six to eight months (corresponding possibly to the embryonic period) the Fanany (so the Betsileo believe) then appears in daylight in the form of a lizard. The relatives of the dead receive it with great celebrations and then push it back down the rod in the hope that this ancestral ghost will prosper exceedingly down below and become the powerful protector of the family and, for that matter, the whole village.&quot;

&quot;Later totemism- the idea of descent from a definite animal species - seems to emerge only from a secondary interpretation of the soul-worm idea or the soul-animal idea in accordance with a &#x27;law of inversion&#x27; (Frobenius) peculiar to mythical thought; just as the myth of the Creation as the projection backward in time of the myth of the end of the world is in itself only a formal expression of the principle of rebirth.&quot;

<text>In heraldry, a charge is any emblem or device occupying the field of an &quot;escutcheon&quot; (shield). That may be a geometric design (sometimes called an &quot;ordinary&quot;) or a symbolic representation of a person, animal, plant, object, building, or other device. In French blazon, the ordinaries are called &quot;pièces&quot;, and other charges are called &quot;meubles&quot; (&quot;[the] mobile [ones]&quot;).

The term &quot;charge&quot; can also be used as a verb; for example, if an escutcheon depicts three lions, it is said to be &quot;charged with three lions&quot;; similarly, a crest or even a charge itself may be &quot;charged&quot;, such as a pair of eagle wings &quot;charged with trefoils&quot; (as on the coat of arms of Brandenburg). It is important to distinguish between the ordinaries and divisions of the field, as they typically follow similar patterns, such as a shield &quot;divided&quot; &quot;per chevron&quot;, as distinct from being &quot;charged with&quot; a chevron.

While thousands of objects found in religion, nature, mythology, or technology have appeared in armory, there are several charges (such as the cross, the eagle, and the lion) which have contributed to the distinctive flavour of heraldic design. Only these and a few other notable charges (crowns, stars, keys, etc.) are discussed in this article.

In addition to being shown in the regular way, charges may be blazoned as &quot;umbrated&quot; (shadowed), &quot;detailed&quot;, (rather incorrectly) &quot;outlined&quot;, highly unusually &quot;shaded&quot; and rather irregularly &quot;in silhouette&quot; or, more ambiguously, confusingly, and unhelpfully, &quot;futuristic&quot;, &quot;stylized&quot; or &quot;simplified&quot;. There are also several units in the United States Air Force with charges blazoned as &quot;mythical&quot;, or beasts as &quot;chimerical&quot;, but those conceptions are meaningless and irrelevant to the conception of heraldry, and it does not affect the appearance of those charges.

== Ordinary charges – Ordinaries and sub-ordinaries ==

Unlike &quot;mobile charges&quot;, the ordinary charges reach to the edge of the field. Some heraldic writers distinguish, albeit arbitrarily, between (honourable) ordinaries and sub-ordinaries. While some authors hold that only nine charges are &quot;honourable&quot; ordinaries, exactly which ones fit into this category is a subject of constant disagreement. The remainder are often termed &quot;sub-ordinaries&quot;, and narrower or smaller versions of the ordinaries are called &quot;diminutives&quot;. While the term &quot;ordinaries&quot; is generally recognised, so much dispute may be found among sources regarding which are &quot;honourable&quot; and which are relegated to the category of &quot;sub-ordinaries&quot; that indeed one of the leading authors in the field, Arthur Charles Fox-Davies (1871–1928), wrote at length on what he calls the &quot;utter absurdity of the necessity for any [such] classification at all&quot;, stating that the ordinaries and sub-ordinaries are, in his mind, &quot;no more than first charges&quot;. Apparently ceding the point for the moment, Fox-Davies lists the generally agreed-upon &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot; as the bend, fess, pale, pile, chevron, cross, saltire, and chief. Woodcock sheds some light on the matter, stating that earlier writers such as Leigh, Holme and Guillim proposed that &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot; should occupy one-third of the field, while later writers such as Edmondson favoured one-fifth, &quot;on the grounds that a bend, pale, or chevron occupying one-third of the field makes the coat look clumsy and disagreeable&quot;. Woodcock goes so far as to enumerate the ordinaries thus: &quot;The first Honourable Ordinary is the cross&quot;, the second is the chief, the third is the pale, the fourth is the bend, the fifth is the fess, the sixth is the inescutcheon, the seventh is the chevron, the eighth is the saltire, and the ninth is the bar, while stating that &quot;some writers&quot; prefer the bordure as the ninth ordinary. Volborth, having decidedly less to say on the matter, agrees that the classifications are arbitrary and the subject of disagreement, and lists the &quot;definite&quot; ordinaries as the chief, pale, bend, fess, chevron, cross and saltire. Boutell lists the chief, pale, bend, bend sinister, fess, bar, cross, saltire and chevron as the &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot;. Thus, the chief, bend, pale, fess, chevron, cross and saltire appear to be the undisputed ordinaries, while authors disagree over the status of the pile, bar, inescutcheon, bordure and others.

===Honourable ordinaries===
Several different figures are recognised as &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot;, each normally occupying about one-fifth to one-third of the field. As discussed above, much disagreement exists among authors regarding which ordinary charges are &quot;honourable&quot;, so only those generally agreed to be &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot; will be discussed here, while the remainder of ordinary charges will be discussed in the following section.

* The &quot;chief&quot; is the upper portion of the field.
* The &quot;bend&quot; is a stripe running from the upper left to the lower right, as \, as seen by the viewer. The &quot;bend sinister&quot; runs from the upper right to the lower left, as /. (In heraldry &quot;sinister&quot; (Latin: left) refers to the left side of the shield from the perspective of the one wearing it, hence the right side from the viewer&#x27;s perspective.)
* The &quot;pale&quot; is a vertical stripe in the centre of the field.
* The &quot;fess&quot; is a broad horizontal stripe across the centre of the field.
* The &quot;chevron&quot; is a construction shaped like an inverted letter V.
* The &quot;cross&quot; is a geometric construction of two perpendicular lines or bands, vertical and horizontal. It has hundreds of variants, most of which are mobile charges rather than ordinaries; some of these will be discussed below.
* The &quot;saltire&quot; is a diagonal cross, often called &quot;Saint Andrew&#x27;s cross&quot;.

Most of the ordinaries have corresponding &quot;diminutives&quot;, narrower versions, most often mentioned when two or more appear in parallel: &quot;bendlets, pallets, bars&quot; (multiples of the &quot;fess&quot;), and &quot;chevronels&quot;.

===Honourable ordinaries or sub-ordinaries===
In addition to those mentioned in the above section, the following are variously called &quot;honourable ordinaries&quot; by different authors, while others of these are often called &quot;sub-ordinaries&quot;.
* The &quot;bordure&quot; is a border touching the edge of the field.
* The &quot;pile&quot; is a wedge issuing from the top of the field and tapering to a point near the bottom. Its length and width vary widely. Piles may occur in any orientation, e.g. &quot;pile reversed&quot;, &quot;pile bendwise&quot; and so on.
* The &quot;pall&quot; or &quot;pairle&quot; is shaped like the letter Y.

===Sub-ordinaries===
* The &quot;quarter&quot; is a rectangle occupying the top left quarter of the field, as seen by the viewer.
* The &quot;canton&quot; is a square occupying the left third of the chief (sometimes reckoned to be a diminutive of the quarter).
* The &quot;orle&quot; may be considered an inner bordure: a reasonably wide band away from the edge of the shield, it is always shown following the shape of the shield, without touching the edges.
**The &quot;tressure&quot; is a narrower version of the orle, rarely seen except in the &quot;double tressure flory and counter-flory&quot;, an element of the royal coat of arms of Scotland and of many other Scots coats.
* The &quot;base&quot; or &quot;terrace in base&quot; is the lower portion of the field.
* The &quot;fret&quot; originally consisted of three bendlets interlaced with three bendlets sinister; other depictions form the outer bendlets into a mascle through which the two remaining bendlets are woven. This has also been called a Harington knot, as in the arms of Harington.
* &quot;Flaunches&quot;, &quot;flanches&quot; or &quot;flasks&quot; are regions on the sides of the field, bounded by a pair of circular arcs whose centers are beyond the sides of the shield.
* A &quot;label&quot; is a horizontal strap, with a number of pendants (usually called &quot;points&quot;) suspended from it; the default is three, but any number may be specified. The label is nearly always a mark of cadency in British and French heraldry, but is occasionally found as a regular charge in early armory and even in the 20th century. It is sometimes called a &quot;file&quot;, as in the canting arms of Belfile, a label with a bell hanging from each point. There are some examples in which the strap is omitted, the points issuing from the top of the shield.
* The &quot;gyron&quot; is a right triangle occupying the lower half of the first quarter: its edges follow per bend and per fess from the dexter side to the centre of the field. A &quot;gyron sinister&quot;, much rarer, is a similar figure in the sinister chief. Gyrons are sometimes blazoned to be shown in other positions – as in &#x27;the sun in his splendour .. along with in dexter base a sixth gyron voided&#x27; 

== Mobile charges ==
The so-called mobile charges (or sometimes common charges) are not tied to the size and shape of the shield, and so may be placed in any part of the field, although whenever a charge appears alone, it is placed with sufficient position and size to occupy the entire field. Common &quot;mobile charges&quot; include human figures, human parts, animals, animal parts, legendary creatures (or &quot;monsters&quot;), plants and floral designs, inanimate objects, and other devices. The heraldic animals need not exactly resemble the actual creatures.

=== Geometric charges ===
A number of geometric charges are sometimes listed among the subordinaries (see above), but as their form is not related to the shape of the shield – indeed they may appear independent of the shield (&quot;i.e.&quot; in crests and badges) – they are more usefully considered here. These include the escutcheon or inescutcheon, lozenge, fusil, mascle, rustre, billet, roundel, fountain, and annulet.
* The &quot;escutcheon&quot; is a small shield. If borne singly in the centre of the main shield, it is sometimes called an &quot;inescutcheon&quot;, and is usually employed to combine multiple coats. It is customarily the same shape as the shield it is on, though shields of specific shapes are rarely specified in the blazon.
* The &quot;lozenge&quot; is a rhombus generally resembling the diamonds of playing cards.
** The &quot;fusil&quot;: A more acute lozenge.
** The &quot;mascle&quot;: A lozenge voided (&quot;i.e.&quot; with a lozenge-shaped hole).
** The &quot;rustre&quot;: A lozenge pierced (&quot;i.e.&quot; with a round hole).
* The &quot;billet&quot; is a rectangle, usually at least twice as tall as it is wide; it may represent a block of wood or a sheet of paper. Billets appear in the shield of the House of Nassau, which was modified to become that of the kingdom of the Netherlands.
* The &quot;roundel&quot; is a solid circle, frequently of gold (blazoned a &quot;bezant&quot;).
** A &quot;fountain&quot; is depicted as &quot;a roundel barry wavy argent and azure&quot;.
** An &quot;annulet&quot; is a roundel voided (&quot;i.e.&quot; a ring).

Several other simple charges occur with comparable frequency. These include the mullet or star, crescent and cross:
* The &quot;mullet&quot; is a star of (usually five) straight rays, and may have originated as a representation of the &quot;rowel&quot; or &quot;revel&quot; of a &quot;spur&quot; (although &quot;spur revels&quot; do appear under that name). Mullets frequently appear pierced. An unpierced mullet is sometimes called a &quot;star&quot; in Scottish heraldry, and stars also appear in English and continental heraldry under that name (often with six points). The &quot;spur revel&quot; is also found in Scottish heraldry.
** The &quot;estoile&quot;: A star with (usually six) wavy rays is called an &quot;estoile&quot; (the Old French word for &#x27;star&#x27;; modern French &quot;étoile&quot;).
* The &quot;comet&quot; is shown as a mullet with a bendwise wavy tail, rather than naturalistically.
* The &quot;crescent&quot;, a symbol of the Moon, normally appears with its horns upward; if its horns are &quot;to dexter&quot; it represents a waxing moon (&quot;increscent&quot;), and with horns &quot;to sinister&quot; it represents a waning moon (&quot;decrescent&quot;).

* The &quot;cross&quot;: One of the most frequently found charges in heraldry, if not &quot;the&quot; most, is the cross, which has developed into, some say, 400 varieties. When the cross does not reach the edges of the field, it becomes a mobile charge. The plain &quot;Greek cross&quot; (with equal limbs) and &quot;Latin cross&quot; (with the lower limb extended) are sometimes seen, but more often the tip of each limb is developed into some ornamental shape. The most commonly found crosses in heraldry include the &quot;cross botonny&quot;, the &quot;cross flory&quot;, the &quot;cross moline&quot;, the &quot;cross potent&quot;, the &quot;cross patée&quot; or &quot;formée&quot;, the &quot;cross patonce&quot; and the &quot;cross crosslet&quot;.

In English heraldry the crescent, mullet, martlet, annulet, fleur-de-lis and rose may be added to a shield to distinguish cadet branches of a family from the senior line. It does not follow, however, that a shield containing such a charge necessarily belongs to a cadet branch. All of these charges occur frequently in basic (&quot;undifferenced&quot;) coats of arms.

===Human or humanlike figures===
Humans, deities, angels and demons occur more often as crests and supporters than on the shield. (Though in many heraldic traditions the depiction of deities is considered taboo, exceptions to this also occur.) When humans do appear on the shield, they almost always appear &quot;affronté&quot; (facing forward), rather than toward the left like beasts. Such as the arms of the Dalziel family of Scotland, which depicted a naked man his arms expanded on a black background. The largest group of human charges consists of saints, often as the patron of a town. Knights, bishops, monks and nuns, kings and queens also occur frequently. There are rare occurrences of a &quot;child&quot; (without further description, this is usually understood to be a very young boy, and young girls are extremely rare in heraldry), both the head and entire body. A famous example is the child swallowed by a dragon (the biscione) in the arms of Visconti dukes of Milan.

Greco-Roman mythological figures typically appear in an allegorical or canting role. Angels very frequently appear, but angelic beings of higher rank, such as cherubim and seraphim, are extremely rare. An archangel appears in the arms of Arkhangelsk. The Devil or a demon is occasionally seen, being defeated by the archangel Saint Michael. Though the taboo is not invariably respected, British heraldry in particular, and to a greater or lesser extent the heraldry of other countries, frowns on depictions of God or Christ, though an exception may be in the not-uncommon Continental depictions of Madonna and Child, including the Black Madonna in the arms of Marija Bistrica, Croatia.

Moors—or more frequently their heads, often crowned—appear with some frequency in medieval European heraldry. They are also sometimes called &quot;moore&quot;, &quot;blackmoor&quot; or &quot;negro&quot;. Moors appear in European heraldry from at least as early as the 13th century, and some have been attested as early as the 11th century in Italy, where they have persisted in the local heraldry and vexillology well into modern times in Corsica and Sardinia. Armigers bearing moors or moors&#x27; heads may have adopted them for any of several reasons, to include symbolizing military victories in the Crusades, as a pun on the bearer&#x27;s name in the canting arms of Morese, Negri, Saraceni, etc., or in the case of Frederick II, possibly to demonstrate the reach of his empire. Even the arms of Pope Benedict XVI feature a moor&#x27;s head, crowned and collared red. Nevertheless, the use of moors (and particularly their heads) as a heraldic symbol has been deprecated in modern North America, where racial stereotypes have been influenced by a history of Trans-Atlantic slave trade and racial segregation, and applicants to the College of Arms of the Society for Creative Anachronism are urged to use them delicately to avoid creating offensive images.
====Human parts====
Parts of human bodies occur more often than the whole, particularly heads (occasionally of exotic nationality), hearts (always stylized), hands, torso and armored limbs. A famous heraldic hand is the Red Hand of Ulster, alluding to an incident in the legendary Milesian invasion. Hands also appear in the coat of arms of Antwerp. Ribs occur in Iberian armory, canting for the Portuguese family &quot;da Costa&quot;. According to Woodward &amp; Burnett, the Counts Colleoni of Milan bear arms blazoned: &quot;Per pale argent and gules, three hearts reversed counterchanged;&quot; but in less delicate times these were read as canting arms showing three pairs of testicles (&quot;coglioni&quot; = &quot;testicles&quot; in Italian). The community of Cölbe in Hesse has a coat of arms with a similar charge.

===Animals===

Animals, especially lions and eagles, feature prominently as heraldic charges. Some differences may be observed between an animal&#x27;s natural form and the conventional attitudes (positions) into which heraldic animals are contorted; additionally, various parts of an animal (claws, horns, tongue, etc.) may be differently coloured, each with its own terminology. Most animals are broadly classified, according to their natural form, into beasts, birds, sea creatures and others, and the attitudes that apply to them may be grouped accordingly. Beasts, particularly lions, most often appear in the &quot;rampant&quot; position; while birds, particularly the eagle, most often appear &quot;displayed&quot;. While the lion, regarded as the king of beasts, is by far the most frequently occurring beast in heraldry, the eagle, equally regarded as the king of birds, is overwhelmingly the most frequently occurring bird, and the rivalry between these two is often noted to parallel with the political rivalry between the powers they came to represent in medieval Europe. Neubecker notes that &quot;in the heroic poem by Heinrich von Veldeke based on the story of Aeneas, the bearer of the arms of a lion is set against the bearer of the arms of an eagle. If one takes the latter to be the historical and geographical forerunner of the Holy Roman emperor, then the bearer of the lion represents the unruly feudal lords, to whom the emperor had to make more and more concessions, particularly to the powerful duke of Bavaria and Saxony, Henry the Lion of the House of Welf.&quot;

The beast most often portrayed in heraldry is the lion. When posed &quot;passant guardant&quot; (walking and facing the viewer), he is called a &quot;léopard&quot; in French blazon. Other beasts frequently seen include the wolf, bear, boar, horse, bull or ox, and stag or hart. The &quot;tiger&quot; (unless blazoned as a &quot;Bengal tiger&quot;) is a fanciful beast with a wolflike body, a mane and a pointed snout. Dogs of various types, and occasionally of specific breeds, occur more often as crests or supporters than as charges. According to Neubecker, heraldry in the Middle Ages generally distinguished only between pointers, hounds and whippets, when any distinction was made. The unicorn resembles a horse with a single horn, but its hooves are usually cloven like those of a deer. The griffin combines the head (but with ears), chest, wings and forelegs of the eagle with the hindquarters and legs of a lion. The &quot;male griffin&quot; lacks wings and his body is scattered with spikes.

The bird most frequently found in armory is, by far, the eagle. Eagles in heraldry are predominantly presented with one or two heads, though triple-headed eagles are not unknown, and one eagle appearing in the Codex Manesse has its wing bones fashioned into additional heads. Eagles and their wings also feature prominently as crests. Eagles most frequently appear full-bodied, with one head, in numerous positions including &quot;displayed&quot;, &quot;statant&quot;, &quot;passant&quot; and &quot;rising&quot;. The &quot;demi-eagle&quot;, which is shown only from the waist up, occurs less frequently. Double-headed eagles almost always appear &quot;displayed&quot;. As a result of being the dominant charge on the imperial Byzantine, Holy Roman, Austrian and Russian coats of arms, the double eagle gained enduring renown throughout the Western world. Among the present day nations with an eagle charge on their coat of arms are: Albania, Austria, Germany, Montenegro, Poland, Romania, Russia, and Serbia. Additionally, the &quot;Double-Headed Eagle of Lagash&quot; is used as an emblem by the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. There are many meanings attached to this symbol, and it was introduced in France in the early 1760s as the emblem of the Knight Kadosh degree.

The martlet, a stylized swift or swallow without feet (sometimes incorrectly, at least in the Anglophone heraldries these days, said to have no beak), is a mark of cadency in English heraldry, but also appears as a simple charge in undifferenced arms. Its attitude is usually statant (and is never blazoned as such); but it can also be found volant. The pelican is notable as frequently occurring in a peculiar attitude described as &quot;in her piety&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; wings raised, piercing her own breast to feed her chicks in the nest, which is how it is actually often blazoned, &#x27;in its piety&#x27; being a fairly modern conceit). This symbol carries a particular religious meaning (as a symbol of Christ sacrificing Himself), and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. Distinction is however observed, between a pelican &quot;vulning herself&quot; (alone, piercing her breast) and &quot;in her piety&quot; (surrounded by and feeding her chicks). The swan is also often seen, and the peacock in heraldry is described as being &quot;in its pride&quot;. The domestic cock (or rooster) is sometimes called &quot;dunghill cock&quot; to distinguish it from the &quot;game cock&quot; which has a cut comb and exaggerated spurs, and the &quot;moor cock&quot;, which is the farmyard cock with a game bird&#x27;s tail. Other birds occur less frequently.

The category of sea creatures may be seen to include various fish, a highly stylized &quot;dolphin&quot;, and various fanciful creatures, sea monsters, which are shown as half-fish and half-beast, as well as mermaids and the like. The &quot;sea lion&quot; and &quot;sea horse&quot;, for example, do not appear as natural sea lions and seahorses, but rather as half-lion half-fish and half-horse half-fish, respectively. Fish of various species often appear in canting arms, e.g.: pike, also called luce, for Pike or Lucy; dolphin (a conventional kind of fish rather than the natural mammal) for the Dauphin de Viennois. The &quot;escallop&quot; (scallop shell) became popular as a token of pilgrimage to the shrine of Santiago de Compostela. The &quot;sea-lion&quot; and &quot;sea-horse&quot;, like the mermaid, combine the foreparts of a mammal with the tail of a fish, and a dorsal fin in place of the mane. (When the natural seahorse is meant, it is blazoned as a &quot;hippocampus&quot;.) The &quot;sea-dog&quot; and &quot;sea-wolf&quot; are quadrupeds but with scales, webbed feet, and often a flat tail resembling that of the beaver.

Reptiles and invertebrates occurring in heraldry include serpents, lizards, salamanders and others, but the most frequently occurring of these are various forms of dragons. The &quot;dragon&quot;, thus termed, is a large monstrous reptile with, often, a forked or barbed tongue, membraned wings like a bat&#x27;s, and four legs. The &quot;wyvern&quot; and &quot;lindworm&quot; are dragons with only two legs. The salamander is typically shown as a simple lizard surrounded by flames. Also notably occurring (undoubtedly owing much of its fame to Napoleon, though it also appears in much earlier heraldry) is the bee.

====Animal parts====
Animals&#x27; heads are also very frequent charges, as are the paw or leg (&quot;gamb&quot;) of the lion, the wing (often paired) of the eagle, and the antlers (&quot;attire&quot;) of the stag. Sometimes only the top half of a beast is shown; for example, the &quot;demi-lion&quot; is among the most common forms occurring in heraldic crests.

Heads may appear &quot;cabossed&quot; (also &quot;caboshed&quot; or &quot;caboched&quot;): with the head cleanly separated from the neck so that only the face shows; &quot;couped&quot;: with the neck cleanly separated from the body so that the whole head and neck are present; or &quot;erased&quot;: with the neck showing a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. While cabossed heads are shown facing forward (&quot;affronté&quot;), heads that are &quot;couped&quot; or &quot;erased&quot; face dexter unless otherwise specified for differencing. Heads of horned beasts are often shown cabossed to display the horns, but instances can be found in any of these circumstances. A lion&#x27;s head cabossed is called simply a &quot;face&quot;, and a fox&#x27;s head cabossed, a &quot;mask&quot;.


====Attitude of animals====

The &quot;attitude&quot;, or position, of the creature&#x27;s body is usually explicitly stated in English blazon. When such description is omitted, a lion can be assumed to be &quot;rampant&quot;, a leopard or herbivore &quot;passant&quot;.

By default, the charge faces dexter (left as seen by the viewer); this would be forward on a shield worn on the left arm. In German armory, animate charges in the dexter half of a composite display are usually turned to face the center.

* An animal &quot;toward sinister&quot; or &quot;contourny&quot; is turned toward the right of the shield (as seen by the observer, i.e. the shield-bearer&#x27;s left), the sinister.
* An animal &quot;affronté&quot; or &quot;full faced&quot; faces the viewer.
* An animal &quot;guardant&quot; faces dexter with its head turned to face the viewer.
* An animal &quot;regardant&quot; faces dexter with its head turned toward sinister, as if looking over its shoulder.

Certain features of an animal are often of a contrasting tincture. The charge is then said to be &quot;armed&quot; (claws and horns and tusks), &quot;langued&quot; (tongue), &quot;vilené&quot; or &quot;pizzled&quot; (penis), &quot;attired&quot; (antlers or very occasionally horns), &quot;unguled&quot; (hooves), &quot;crined&quot; (horse&#x27;s mane or human hair) of a specified tincture.

Many attitudes have developed from the herald&#x27;s imagination and ever-increasing need for differentiation, but only the principal attitudes found in heraldry need be discussed here. These, in the case of beasts, include the erect positions, the seated positions, and the prone positions. In the case of birds, these include the &quot;displayed&quot; positions, the flying positions, and the resting positions. Additionally, birds are frequently described by the position of their wings. A few other attitudes warrant discussion, including those particular to fish, serpents, griffins and dragons.

The principal attitude of beasts is &quot;rampant&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; standing on one hind leg with forepaws raised as if to climb or mount - sometimes including an erect member). Beasts also frequently appear walking, &quot;passant&quot; or, in the case of stags and the occasional unicorn, &quot;trippant&quot;, and may appear &quot;statant&quot; (standing), &quot;salient&quot; or &quot;springing&quot; (leaping), &quot;sejant&quot; (seated), &quot;couchant&quot; or &quot;lodged&quot; (lying prone with head raised), or occasionally &quot;dormant&quot; (sleeping). The principal attitude of birds, namely the eagle, is &quot;displayed&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; facing the viewer with the head turned toward dexter and wings raised and upturned to show the full underside of both wings). Birds also appear &quot;rising&quot; or &quot;rousant&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; wings raised and head upturned as if about to take flight), &quot;volant&quot; (flying), &quot;statant&quot; (standing, with wings raised), &quot;close&quot; (at rest with wings folded), and waterfowl may appear &quot;naiant&quot; (swimming), while cranes may appear &quot;vigilant&quot; (standing on one leg). Fish often appear &quot;naiant&quot; (swimming horizontally) or &quot;hauriant&quot; (upwards) or &quot;urinant&quot; (downwards), but may also appear &quot;addorsed&quot; (two fish hauriant, back to back). Serpents may appear &quot;glissant&quot; (gliding in a wavy form) or &quot;nowed&quot; (as a figure-eight knot). Griffins and quadrupedal dragons constantly appear &quot;segreant&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; rampant with wings addorsed and elevated) and, together with lions, may appear &quot;combatant&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; two of them turned to face each other in the rampant position).

===Plants===
Plants are extremely common in heraldry and figure among the earliest charges. The turnip, for instance, makes an early appearance, as does wheat. Trees also appear in heraldry; the most frequent tree by far is the oak (drawn with large leaves and acorns), followed by the pine. Apples and bunches of grapes occur very frequently, other fruits less so. When the fruit is mentioned, as to indicate a different tincture, the tree is said to be &quot;fructed&quot; of the tincture. If a tree is &quot;eradicated&quot; it is shown as if it has been ripped up from the ground, the roots being exposed. &quot;Erased&quot; is rarely used for a similar treatment. In Portuguese heraldry, but rarely in other countries, trees are sometimes found decorticated.

The most famous heraldic flower (particularly in French heraldry) is the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;, which is often stated to be a stylised lily, though despite the name there is considerable debate on this. The &quot;natural&quot; lily, somewhat stylised, also occurs, as (together with the fleur-de-lis) in the arms of Eton College. The rose is perhaps even more widely seen in English heraldry than the fleur-de-lis. Its heraldic form is derived from the &quot;wild&quot; type with only five petals, and it is often &quot;barbed&quot; (the hull of the bud, its points showing between the petals) and &quot;seeded&quot; in contrasting tinctures. The thistle frequently appears as a symbol of Scotland.

The trefoil, quatrefoil and cinquefoil are abstract forms resembling flowers or leaves. The trefoil is always shown &quot;slipped&quot; (i.e. with a stem), unless blazoned otherwise. The cinquefoil is sometimes blazoned &quot;fraise&quot; (strawberry flower), most notably when canting for Fraser. The trillium flower occurs occasionally in a Canadian context, and the protea flower constantly appears in South Africa, since it is the national flower symbol.

Wheat constantly occurs in the form of &quot;garbs&quot; or sheaves and in fields (e.g. in the arms of the province of Alberta, Canada), though less often as ears, which are shown unwhiskered (though some varieties of wheat are naturally whiskered). Ears of rye are depicted exactly as wheat, except the ears droop down and are often whiskered, e.g. in the arms of the former Ruislip-Northwood Urban District. Barley, cannabis, maize, and oats also occur. The &quot;garb&quot; in the arms of Gustav Vasa (and in the coat of arms of Sweden) is not a wheatsheaf, although it was pictured in that way from the 16th to 19th century; rather, this &quot;vasa&quot; is a bundle but of unknown sort.

===Inanimate objects===
Very few inanimate objects in heraldry carry a special significance distinct from that of the object itself, but among such objects are the &quot;escarbuncle&quot;, the &quot;fasces&quot;, and the &quot;key&quot;. The escarbuncle developed from the radiating iron bands used to strengthen a round shield, eventually becoming a heraldic charge. The fasces (not to be confused with the French term for a &quot;bar&quot; or &quot;fess&quot;) is emblematic of the Roman magisterial office and has often been granted to mayors. Keys (taking a form similar to a &quot;skeleton key&quot;) are emblematic of Saint Peter and, by extension, the papacy, and thus frequently appear in ecclesiastical heraldry. Because St. Peter is the patron saint of fishermen, keys also notably appear in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers.

The sun is a disc with twelve or more wavy rays, or alternating wavy and straight rays, often represented &quot;in his splendour&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; with a face). The moon &quot;in her plenitude&quot; (full) sometimes appears, distinguished from a &quot;roundel argent&quot; by having a face; but crescents occur much more frequently. &quot;Estoiles&quot; are stars with six wavy rays, while &quot;stars&quot; (when they occur under that name) have straight rays usually numbering five in British and North American heraldry and six in continental European heraldry. Clouds often occur, though more frequently for people or animals to stand on or issue from than as isolated charges. The raindrop as such is unknown, though drops of fluid (&quot;goutte&quot;) is known. These occasionally appear as a charge, but more frequently constitute a field semé (known as &quot;goutté&quot;). The snowflake occurs in modern heraldry, sometimes blazoned as a &quot;snow crystal&quot; or &quot;ice crystal&quot;.

The oldest geological charge is the &quot;mount&quot;, typically a green hilltop rising from the lower edge of the field, providing a place for a beast, building or tree to stand. This feature is exceedingly common in Hungarian arms. Natural mountains and boulders are not unknown, though ranges of mountains are differently shown. An example is the arms of Edinburgh, portraying Edinburgh Castle atop Castle Rock. Volcanos are shown, almost without exception, as erupting, and the eruption is generally quite stylised. In the 18th century, &quot;landscapes&quot; began to appear in armory, often depicting the sites of battles. For example, Admiral Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson received a chief of augmentation containing a landscape alluding to the Battle of the Nile.

By far the most frequent building in heraldry is the &quot;tower&quot;, a tapering cylinder of masonry topped with battlements, usually having a door and a few windows. The canting arms of the Kingdom of Castile are &quot;Gules, a tower triple-turreted Or&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; three small towers standing atop a larger one). A castle is generally shown as two towers joined by a wall, the doorway often shown secured by a portcullis. The portcullis was used as a canting badge by the House of Tudor (&quot;two-doors&quot;), and has since come to represent the British Parliament. The modern chess-rook would be indistinguishable from a tower; the heraldic chess rook, based on the medieval form of the piece, instead of battlements, has two outward-splayed &quot;horns&quot;. Civic and ecclesiastical armory sometimes shows a church or a whole town, and cities, towns and Scots burghs often bear a mural crown (a crown in the form of a wall with battlements or turrets) in place of a crown over the shield. Ships of various types often appear; the most frequent being the ancient galley often called, from the Gaelic, a lymphad. Also frequent are anchors and oars.

The &quot;maunch&quot; is a 12th-century lady&#x27;s sleeve style. Its use in heraldry arose from the custom of the knights who attended tournaments wearing their ladies sleeves, as &quot;gages d&#x27;amour&quot; (tokens of love). This fashion of sleeve would later evolve into Tippet-style stoles. In French blazon this charge is sometimes informally referred to as &quot;manche mal taillée&quot; (a sleeve badly cut).

Spurs also occur, sometimes &quot;winged&quot;, but more frequently occurring is the &quot;spur-rowel&quot; or &quot;spur-revel&quot;, which is said to more often termed a &quot;mullet of five points pierced&quot; by English heralds.

Crowns and coronets of various kinds are constantly seen. The ecclesiastical hat and bishop&#x27;s mitre are nearly ubiquitous in ecclesiastical heraldry. The sword is sometimes a symbol of authority, as in the royal arms of the Netherlands, but may also allude to Saint Paul, as the patron of a town (e.g. London) or dedicatee of a church. Sometimes it is shown with a key, because Saints Peter and Paul are paired together. Other weapons occur more often in modern than in earlier heraldry. The mace also appears as a weapon, the war mace, in addition to its appearance as a symbol of authority, plain mace. The &quot;globus cruciger&quot;, also variously called an &quot;orb&quot;, a &quot;royal orb&quot;, or a &quot;mound&quot; (from French &quot;monde&quot;, Latin &quot;mundus&quot;, the world) is a ball or globe surmounted by a cross, which is part of the regalia of an emperor or king, and is the emblem of sovereign authority and majesty.

Books constantly occur, most frequently in the arms of colleges and universities, though the Gospel and Bible are sometimes distinguished. Books if open may be inscribed with words. Words and phrases are otherwise rare, except in Spanish and Portuguese armory. Letters of the various alphabets are also relatively rare. Arms of merchants in Poland and eastern Germany are often based on house marks, abstract symbols resembling runes, though they are almost never blazoned as runes, but as combinations of other heraldic charges. Musical instruments commonly seen are the harp (as in the coat of arms of Ireland), bell and trumpet. The drum, almost without exception, is of the field drum type. Since musical notation is a comparatively recent invention, it is not found in early heraldry, though it does appear in 20th century heraldry.

Japanese mon are sometimes used as heraldic charges. They are blazoned in traditional heraldic style rather than in the Japanese style.

<text>The Navarrese People&#x27;s Union (; ), abbreviated to UPN, is a regional conservative political party in Navarre, Spain. Until 2008, it was a fraternal party of the People&#x27;s Party (PP), acting as the latter&#x27;s Navarrese branch.

UPN is a strong opponent of Basque nationalism, and supports a Spanish regional identity for Navarre with a marginal Basque component and separate from the Basque Country. The party&#x27;s regionalist tradition dates back to the nineteenth century, in which the Spanish nation is seen to be based on &#x27;regional liberties&#x27;.

During the 1991–2008 period, UPN acted as the Navarrese branch of the PP, which, in return, did not run at Navarrese elections as a part of their agreement. Since 1991, UPN has been the largest party in elections for the regional Parliament of Navarre and was the ruling party of the Autonomous Community from 1996 to 2015.

==History==

The UPN was a Navarrese splinter group of the Union of the Democratic Centre. Its president, Miguel Sanz, had been the head of the Navarrese government from 1996 to 2015.

Juan Cruz Alli was elected president of the Navarrese government for UPN, but later disagreed with the orientation the party was taking and founded another party Democrats&#x27; Convergence of Navarre.

===Pacts with the PP===
As part of an agreement held over the 1991–2008 period, the PP did not run in any elections in the Navarra Congress Electoral District and People&#x27;s Party of Navarre (founded in 1989) was dissolved, while UPN were on the same national ticket as the PP at the Spanish national elections. The national Deputies and Senators elected as part of UPN&#x27;s ticket were part of the PP Parliamentary Group. Also, UPN members were eligible –and indeed chosen– for national leadership positions in the PP.

The pact was terminated in October 2008 as a result of UPN refusal to vote alongside the PP in the Spanish Congress of Deputies to reject the government budget presented by José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero&#x27;s cabinet. One of the two MPs elected under the UPN-PP ticket refused to follow UPN&#x27;s instructions and a number of UPN elected representatives defected to join the PP. The new situation led to the PP setting up its own office in Navarre.

The two parties ran separate lists in the 2011 regional elections in Navarre with the UPN receiving 34.5% against the 7.3% that the PP received. On 8 September 2011, the two parties reached an agreement to renew their alliance for the 2011 Spanish general election. Under the agreement, the UPN would take the first and third places on the list for Congress while the PP would have the second. For the Senate, the UPN would have the top two places on the list, with the PP taking the third place. A major factor in the new agreement was the two parties&#x27; desire to prevent Bildu from winning enough seats to form a parliamentary group.

<text>The 1980 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Moscow, Soviet Union, from 19 July to 3 August. They were the first Olympic Games to be staged in a communist nation. A total of 5,179 athletes representing 80 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included seven teams making their Olympic debut at the Summer Games; Angola, Botswana, Cyprus, Jordan, Laos, Mozambique, and Seychelles. This was the smallest number of participating NOCs since 1956. The games featured 203 events in 21 sports across 27 disciplines.

67 eligible countries participated in a boycott against these games, some of which did so explicitly citing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Sixteen NOCs participated under the Olympic Flag, as opposed to their nation&#x27;s flag, as a partial boycott. This included the Olympic Anthem and flag being used at medal ceremonies when athletes from these NOCs won medals.

Athletes representing 36 NOCs received at least one medal, with 25 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union won the most overall medals, with 195, and the most gold medals, with 80, setting a new record for most golds won in a single games (which was later broken at the 1984 Games). Sports commentators noted that the absence of the United States and various other Western nations stemming from a large-scale boycott contributed to the highly skewed medal results benefitting the Soviet Union. Guyana, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe won their first Olympic medals of any kind, with Zimbabwe also winning their nation&#x27;s first gold medal.

Among individual participants, Soviet gymnast Alexander Dityatin won the most medals overall with eight medals (three gold, four silver, one bronze), becoming the first athlete to win eight medals at a single games. Dityatin, Soviet canoer Vladimir Parfenovich, Soviet swimmer Vladimir Salnikov, and East German swimmers Barbara Krause, Caren Metschuck, and Rica Reinisch tied for the most gold medals, with three each.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing resulted in bronze medals being awarded to each of the competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to them taking part in a third place tiebreaker. Events in judo used a repechage system which also resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.

In women&#x27;s gymnastics floor there were two-way ties for first and third, respectively, resulting in two gold medals and two bronze medals being issued, with no silver medal being awarded. In men&#x27;s pole vault and the women&#x27;s gymnastic artistic individual all-around events there were two-way ties for second, which resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medals being awarded in each event. Lastly, in the women&#x27;s uneven bars, there was a three-way tie for third, which resulted in three bronze medals being awarded.

<doc id="921136" wikidata="Q1904943" url="?curid=921136" title="Derrick de Kerckhove">
<text>Derrick de Kerckhove (born 1944) is the author of &quot;The Skin of Culture&quot; and &quot;Connected Intelligence&quot; and Professor in the Department of French at the University of Toronto, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He was the Director of the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology from 1983 until 2008.

In January 2007, he returned to Italy for the project and Fellowship &quot;Rientro dei cervelli&quot;, in the Faculty of Sociology at the University of Naples Federico II where he teaches &quot;Sociologia della cultura digitale&quot; and &quot;Marketing e nuovi media&quot;. He was invited to return to the Library of Congress for another engagement in the Spring of 2008. He is research supervisor for the PhD Planetary Collegium M-node directed by Francesco Monico.
Since 2008 he oversees global art projects for Solstizio, co-founded by the artist Giuseppe Stampone.

In July 2015 with Fred Forest, Maurice Benayoun, Tom Klinkowstein and other art people, thinkers and philosophers, he participated to Natan Karczmar&#x27;s seminar ArtComTec.

==Background==

De Kerckhove received his Ph.D in French Language and Literature from the University of Toronto in 1975 and a Doctorat du 3e cycle in Sociology of Art from the university of Tours (France) in 1979. He was an associate of the Centre for Culture and Technology from 1972 to 1980, and worked with Marshall McLuhan for over ten years as translator, assistant and co-author.

==Publications==

He edited &quot;Understanding 1984&quot; (UNESCO, 1984) and co-edited with Amilcare Iannucci, &quot;McLuhan e la metamorfosi dell&#x27;uomo&quot; (Bulzoni, 1984) two collections of essays on McLuhan, culture, technology and biology. He also co-edited with Charles Lumsden &quot;The Alphabet and the Brain&quot; (Springer Verlag, 1988), a book which scientifically assesses the impact of the Western alphabet on the physiology and the psychology of human cognition. Another publication, &quot;La civilisation vidéo-chrétienne&quot; appeared in France in December 1990 and in Italy the following year (Feltrinelli, 1991).

&quot;Brainframes: Technology, Mind and Business&quot; (Bosch &amp; Keuning, 1991) addresses the differences between the effects of television, computers and hypermedia on corporate culture, business practices and economic markets. &quot;The Skin of Culture&quot; (Somerville Press, 1995) is a collection of essays on the new electronic reality which stayed on Canadian best-sellers lists for several months. It was translated into a dozen languages including Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Polish and Slovenian.

&quot;Connected Intelligence&quot; (Somerville, 1997) introduced his research on new media and cognition. His latest book, &quot;The Architecture of Intelligence&quot;, was first issued in Dutch in December 2000, and in English (June 2001), Italian and German in September 2001. It was later translated into Spanish, Portuguese and Japanese. He collaborated with Mark Federman on &quot;McLuhan for Managers: New Tools for New Thinking&quot;, published in September 2003. De Kerckhove is also contracted to work on a book about the history of stage performance from early Greek theatre to modern Opera, in collaboration with Francesco Monico.

==Other works==
&quot;The Point of Being&quot; co-edited with Cristina Miranda de Almeida. This book explores the research question: what are the psycho-physiological dimensions of the ways people experience their presence in the world and the world&#x27;s presence in them? 
There is in all chapters an invitation to experience a shift of perception. An embodied sensation of the world and a re-sensorialization of the environment are described to complement the visually-biased perspective with a renewed sense of humans’ relationship to their spatial and material surrounding. As such, this book presents the topological reunion of sensation and cognition, of sense and sensibility and of body, self and world. The perception of the &quot;Point of Being&quot;, to which the various chapters of this book invite the reader, proposes an alternative to the &quot;Point of View&quot; inherited from the Renaissance; it offers a way to situate the sense of self through the physical, digital and electronic domains that shape physical, social, cultural, economic and spiritual conditions at the beginning of the twenty-first century. Nine authors explore different ways in which the paradigm of the Point of Being can bridge the interval, the discontinuity, between subjects and objects that began with the diffusion of the phonetic alphabet. The Point of Being is a signpost on that journey.

<text>Israel competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. It was the nation&#x27;s thirteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics.

The Olympic Committee of Israel sent 36 athletes to the Games, 20 men and 16 women, to compete in 13 sports. The team&#x27;s size was smaller by three from that sent to the previous games in Sydney (which was, by far, the nation&#x27;s largest delegation). Nine athletes had competed in Sydney, including sprint canoer and Olympic bronze medalist Michael Kolganov and European judo champion Ariel Ze&#x27;evi, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Notable Israeli athletes featured tennis men&#x27;s doubles team Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram, Russian imports Larissa Kosorukova in sprint canoeing and Alexander Danilov in men&#x27;s pistol shooting, and synchronized swimming pair Anastasia Gloushkov and Inna Yoffe, the youngest of the team at age 16. Apart from Kosorukova and Danilov (both competed for Russia in 1996), Georgian-born wrestler Gocha Tsitsiashvili and rifle shooter Guy Starik made their third Olympic appearances as the most experienced members of the team.

Israel left Athens with two medals, including its first ever Olympic gold from windsurfer Gal Fridman in men&#x27;s mistral one design. On the other hand, the bronze medal was awarded to judoka Ariel Ze&#x27;evi in men&#x27;s half-heavyweight division.

<text>The 1976 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XXI Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, from July 17 to August 1, 1976. A total of 6,084 athletes from 92 countries represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these Games, competing in 198 events in 23 sports.

Twenty-eight African countries missed these Games. This boycott decision was taken in response to the participation of New Zealand, because its national rugby union team (the All Blacks) continued to play rugby with South Africa, which had been banned from the Olympic movement since 1964 due to its apartheid policies.

Athletes from 42 countries won at least one medal, leaving 51 countries in blank in the medals table. The Soviet Union won the highest number of gold medals (49) and overall medals (125). The Games were dominated by the Soviet Bloc, with the USSR and its satellites occupying seven out of top ten places in the medal standings. Thailand and Bermuda won the first medals in their Olympic history, with Bermuda being the least populous territory to ever win a Summer Olympic medal until Alessandra Perilli won bronze for San Marino in trap shooting in 2020. Bermuda, however, became the smallest nation to win a Summer Olympic gold at the same games, thanks to Flora Duffy, which was also their first medal since 1976. The Montreal Summer Olympics proved disastrous to Canada not only in financial terms; it failed to win a single gold medal despite being the host nation. Overall, it was 27th in the medal table, which remains the worst result a host nation has ever scored in the history of the Summer Games.

Russian Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union won seven medals (four gold, two silver and one bronze medals), becoming the most medaled athlete in these Games.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

A total of 198 events in 23 different sports were contested at the Montreal Games. In boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded for each weight class. In gymnastics, two bronze medals were awarded for third–place ties in the men&#x27;s pommel horse and men&#x27;s horizontal bar events, and a second–place tie in the women&#x27;s vault resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medal awarded for that event.

<text>The 1972 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XX Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Munich, West Germany, from 26 August through 11 September 1972. 7,134 athletes representing 121 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included 11 teams making their Olympic debut at the Summer Games: Albania, Dahomey (now Benin), Gabon, North Korea, Lesotho, Malawi, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Swaziland (now Eswatini), Togo, Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso). The games featured 195 events in 21 sports across 27 disciplines. Kayaking, the canoe slalom, and indoor handball all made their Olympic debuts, while archery returned to the Olympic program after a 52-year hiatus.

Rhodesia had been barred from participating at the 1968 Games due to racial policies and threats by athletes to boycott the event, but in 1971, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) ruled that Rhodesia would be invited to compete at the 1972 Olympic Games. In response, athletes from other African nations protested this invitation and again threatened to boycott the games over those policies. Four days before the opening ceremonies the IOC voted to rescind their invitation and exclude the Rhodesian athletes.

Athletes representing 48 NOCs received at least one medal, with 25 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union won the most gold medals, with 50, and the most overall medals, with 99. North Korea and Uganda won their nations&#x27; first Summer Olympic gold medals, which was the first medal of any kind for North Korea. Colombia and Niger also won their nations&#x27; first Olympic medals of any kind.

Among individual participants, American swimmer Mark Spitz won the most medals at the game with seven, all of which were gold. Spitz also became the record holder for most gold medals at a single Olympic Games, a record that stood for 36 years until swimmer Michael Phelps surpassed that mark with eight gold medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing resulted in bronze medals being awarded to each of the competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to them taking part in a third place tiebreaker. Events in judo used a repechage system which also resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.

In women&#x27;s uneven bars, there was a two-way tie for second, resulting in two silver medals being issued and no bronze medal being awarded. In men&#x27;s football, the third-place match ended in a tie, resulting in both teams receiving bronze medals.

<text>The ring finger, third finger, fourth finger, leech finger, or annulary is the fourth digit of the human hand, located between the middle finger and the little finger.

Sometimes the term ring finger only refers to the fourth digit of a left-hand, so named for its traditional association with wedding rings in many societies, although not all use this digit as the ring finger. Traditionally, a wedding ring was worn only by the bride or wife, but in recent times more men also wear a wedding ring. It is also the custom in some societies to wear an engagement ring on the ring finger.

In anatomy, the ring finger is called &quot;digitus medicinalis&quot;, &quot;the fourth digit&quot;, &quot;digitus annularis&quot;, &quot;digitus quartus&quot;, or &quot;digitus IV&quot;. In Latin, the word &quot;anulus&quot; means &quot;ring&quot;, &quot;digitus&quot; means &quot;digit&quot;, and &quot;quartus&quot; means &quot;fourth&quot;.

==Etymology==
The origin of the selection of the fourth digit as the ring finger is not definitively known. According to László A. Magyar, the names of the ring finger in many languages reflect an ancient belief that it is a magical finger. It is named after magic or rings, or called &quot;nameless&quot; (for example, in ).

In Hungarian, it is called nevetlen ujj; lit. ‘nameless finger’ or nevezetlen ujj; lit. ‘unnamed finger’. It has special role in magical practices like healing, protection against curse or love magic. For example to heal a stingy eye or a pimple or a ringworm one must draw a cross on it with the nameless finger or rub it gently. If a woman wants to make a man to love her, she should sting her unnamed finger and drop her blood to the mans drink (wine). If the man drinks that he will has a strong bond for that woman, he will love her.


In Japanese, it is called (&quot;kusuri yubi&quot;, ), deriving its name from the fact that it was frequently used when taking traditional powdered medicine, as it was rarely used otherwise and hence was considered the cleanest of all.

In other languages such as Sanskrit, Finnish, and Russian, the ring finger is called &quot;Anamika&quot;, &quot;nimetön&quot;, and &quot;Безымянный&quot; (&quot;bezymianny&quot;, &quot;nameless&quot;), respectively.

In Semitic languages such as Arabic and Hebrew, the ring finger is called &quot;bansur&quot; (meaning &quot;victory&quot;) and &quot;kmitsa&quot; (meaning &quot;taking a handful&quot;), respectively.

==History==

Before medical science discovered how the circulatory system functioned, people believed that a vein ran directly from the fourth digit on the left hand to the heart. Because of the hand–heart connection, they chose the descriptive name vena amoris, Latin for the vein of love, for this particular vein.

Based upon this name, their contemporaries, purported experts in the field of matrimonial etiquette, wrote that it would only be fitting that the wedding ring be worn on this digit. By wearing the ring on the fourth digit of the left hand, a married couple symbolically declares their eternal love for each other.

In Britain, only women tended to wear a wedding ring until after the World Wars, when married male soldiers started to wear rings to remind themselves of their wives.

==Contemporary customs==
===Western customs===
In Western cultures, a wedding ring is traditionally worn on the fourth digit, commonly called the &quot;ring finger&quot;. This developed from the Roman &quot;anulus pronubis&quot;, when a man would give a ring to the woman at their betrothal ceremony. Blessing the wedding ring and putting it on the bride&#x27;s finger dates from the 11th century.

In medieval Europe, during the Christian wedding ceremony, the ring was placed in sequence on the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers of the left hand. The ring was then left on the ring finger.

In a few European countries, the ring is worn on the left hand prior to marriage, then transferred to the right during the ceremony. For example, an Eastern Orthodox Church bride wears the ring on the left hand prior to the ceremony, then moves it to the right hand after the wedding. In England, the 1549 Prayer Book declared &quot;the ring shall be placed on the left hand&quot;. By the 17th and 18th centuries, the ring could be found on any digit after the ceremony — even on the thumb.

The wedding ring is generally worn on the ring finger of the left hand in the former British Empire, certain parts of Western Europe, certain parts of Catholic Mexico, Bolivia, Chile, and Central and Eastern Europe. These include: Australia, Botswana, Canada, Egypt, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, the UK, and the US, as well as France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Netherlands [if Catholic], Croatia, Slovenia, Romania, and the Catalan-speaking regions of Spain.

The wedding ring is worn on the ring finger of the right hand in some Orthodox and a small number of Catholic European countries, some Protestant Western European, as well as some Central and South American Catholic countries. In Eastern Europe, these include Belarus, Bulgaria, Georgia, Latvia, Lithuania, North Macedonia, Russia, Serbia, and Ukraine. In Central or Western Europe, these include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Poland, the Netherlands (if not Catholic), Norway, and Spain (except in the Catalan-speaking regions). In Central or South America, these include Colombia, Cuba, Peru, and Venezuela.

In Turkey, Lebanon, Syria, Romania, and Brazil, the ring is worn on the right hand until the actual wedding day, when it is moved to the left hand.

In western guitar music, &quot;I-M-A&quot; is a style of plucking guitar strings, where &quot;I&quot; means index finger, &quot;M&quot; means middle finger, and &quot;A&quot; means ring finger. This is a popular type of &quot;finger style&quot; guitar playing, where the &quot;A&quot; comes from Latin, where the word anulus means ring.

===Middle Eastern, Jewish, and Asian customs===
In Sinhalese and Tamil culture, the groom wears the wedding ring on his right hand, but the bride wears it on her left hand ring finger. This can be seen in countries like Sri Lanka, which has a rich Sinhalese and Tamil cultural influence on the society.

A wedding ring is not a traditional part of the religious Muslim wedding, and wedding rings are not included in most Islamic countries. If a wedding ring is worn in an Islamic country, however, it may be worn on either the left (such is the custom in Iran) and for example (in Jordan the right ring finger for engagement and the left ring finger for marriage). As opposed to the wedding ring, use of a ring to denote &quot;betrothal or engagement&quot; is quite prevalent in Muslim countries, especially those in West and Asia. These rings may be worn on the ring finger of either the right or left hand by both men and women.

In a traditional Jewish wedding ceremony, the wedding ring is placed on the bride&#x27;s right-hand index finger, but other traditions place it on the middle finger or the thumb, most commonly in recent times. Today, the ring usually is moved to the left hand ring finger after the ceremony. Some Jewish grooms have adopted wearing a wedding ring, but in Orthodox Judaism, most men do not wear wedding rings.

Rings are not traditional in an Indian wedding, but in modern society, it is becoming a practice to wear rings for engagements if not for actual marriage. Although the left hand is considered inauspicious for religious activities, a ring (which is not called a wedding ring) is still worn on the left hand. Men generally wear the rings on the right hand and women on the left hands.

<text>Safety in numbers is the hypothesis that, by being part of a large physical group or mass, an individual is less likely to be the victim of a mishap, accident, attack, or other bad event. Some related theories also argue (and can show statistically) that mass behaviour (by becoming more predictable and &quot;known&quot; to other people) can reduce accident risks, such as in traffic safety – in this case, the safety effect creates an actual reduction of danger, rather than just a redistribution over a larger group.

==In biology==
The mathematical biologist W.D. Hamilton proposed his selfish herd theory in 1971 to explain why animals seek central positions in a group. Each individual can reduce its own domain of danger by situating itself with neighbours all around, so it moves towards the centre of the group. The effect was tested in brown fur seal predation by great white sharks. Using decoy seals, the distance between decoys was varied to produce different domains of danger. The seals with a greater domain of danger had as predicted an increased risk of shark attack. Antipredator adaptations include behaviour such as the flocking of birds, herding of sheep and schooling of fish. Similarly, Adelie penguins wait to jump into the water until a large enough group has assembled, reducing each individual&#x27;s risk of seal predation. This behavior is also seen in masting and predator satiation where the predators are overwhelmed with an abundance of prey during a period of time resulting in more of the prey surviving.

==In road traffic safety==

In 1949 R. J. Smeed reported that per capita road fatality rates tended to be lower in countries with higher rates of motor vehicle ownership. This observation led to Smeed&#x27;s Law.

In 2003 Peter L. Jacobsen compared rates of walking and cycling, in a range of countries, with rates of collisions between motorists and cyclists or walkers. He found an inverse relationship that was hypothesised to be explained by a concept described as &#x27;behavioural adaptation&#x27;, whereby drivers who are exposed to greater numbers of cyclists on the road begin to drive more safely around them. Though an attractive concept for cycling advocates, it has not been empirically validated. Other combined modelling and empirical evidence suggests that while changes in driver behaviour might still be one way that collision risk per cyclist declines with greater numbers, the effect can be easily produced through simple spatial processes (traffic design) akin to the biological herding processes described above.

Without considering hypotheses 1 or 3, Jacobsen concluded that &quot;A motorist is less likely to collide with a person walking and bicycling if more people walk or bicycle.&quot; He described this theory as &quot;safety in numbers.&quot;

Safety in numbers is also used to describe the evidence that the number of pedestrians or cyclists correlates inversely with the risk of a motorist colliding with a pedestrian or cyclist. This non-linear relationship was first shown at intersections. It has been confirmed by ecologic data from cities in California and Denmark, and European countries, and time-series data for the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The number of pedestrians or bicyclists injured increases at a slower rate than would be expected based on their numbers. That is, more people walk or cycle where the risk to the individual pedestrian or bicyclist is lower. A 2002 study into whether pedestrian risk decreased with pedestrian flow, using 1983-86 data from signalized intersections in a town in Canada, found that in some circumstances pedestrian flow increased where the risk per pedestrian decreased.

After cycling was promoted in Finland, there was a 75% drop in cyclists deaths and the number of trips increased by 72%.

In England, between 2000 and 2008, serious bicycle injuries declined by 12%. Over the same period, the number of bicycle trips made in London doubled. Motor vehicle traffic decreased by 16%, bicycle use increased by 28% and cyclist injuries had decreased by 20% in the first year of operation of the London Congestion Charge.
In January 2008, the number of cyclists in London being treated in hospitals for serious injuries had increased by 100% in six years. Over the same time, they report, the number of cyclists had increased by 84%. In York, comparing the periods 1991-93 and 1996–98, the number of bicyclists killed and seriously injured fell by 59%. The share of trips made by bicycle rose from 15% to 18%.

In Germany, between 1975 and 2001, the total number of bicycle trips made in Berlin almost quadrupled. Between 1990 and 2007, the share of trips made by bicycle increased from 5% to 10%. Between 1992 and 2006, the number of serious bicycle injuries declined by 38%. In Germany as a whole, between 1975 and 1998, cyclist fatalities fell by 66% and the percent of trips made by bicycle rose from 8% to 12%.

In America, during the period 1999-2007, the absolute number of cyclists killed or seriously injured decreased by 29% and the amount of cycling in New York city increased by 98%.
In Portland, Oregon, between 1990 and 2000, the percentage of workers who commuted to work by bicycle rose from 1.1% to 1.8%. By 2008, the proportion has risen to 6.0%; while the number of workers increased by only 36% between 1990 and 2008, the number of workers commuting by bicycle increased 608%. Between 1992 and 2008, the number of bicyclists crossing four bridges into downtown was measured to have increased 369% between 1992 and 2008. During that same period, the number of reported crashes increased by only 14%.

In Copenhagen, Denmark, between 1995 and 2006, the number of cyclists killed or seriously injured fell by 60%. During the same period, cycling increased by 44% and the percent of people cycling to work increased from 31% to 36%.

In the Netherlands, between 1980 and 2005, and cyclist fatalities decreased by 58% and cycling increased by 45%.

During 7 years of the 1980s, admissions to hospital of cyclists declined by 5% and cycling in Western Australia increased by 82%.

<doc id="921156" wikidata="Q506073" url="?curid=921156" title="1968 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1968 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XIX Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Mexico City, from 12 to 27 October. A total of 5,516 athletes from 112 nations participated in 172 events in 18 sports across 24 different disciplines. These were the first games to be held in Latin America.

Overall, athletes from 44 nations received at least one medal, and 39 nations won at least one gold medal. Athletes from the United States won the most gold medals, with 45, and the most medals overall, with 107. Teams from East Germany and West Germany won their nations&#x27; first Summer Olympic medals of every color at their first Summer Olympic appearance. Teams from Kenya, Tunisia, and Venezuela won their nations&#x27; first Olympic gold medals, while athletes from Cameroon, Mongolia, and Uganda won their nations&#x27; first Olympic medals.

Artistic gymnast Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia was the most successful competitor at the games, winning six medals (four gold and two silver). After her gold medal wins at these games, Čáslavská held the record for the most individual Olympic gold medals by a female athlete with seven, until Katie Ledecky of the United States surpassed it at the 2024 Summer Olympics with eight. Artistic gymnast Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union won the most total medals at the games with seven (two golds, four silvers, and one bronze).

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. Two bronze medals were awarded in each boxing event to the losing semi-finalists, as opposed to them fighting in a third place tiebreaker.

In gymnastics, two gold medals (and no silver medal) were awarded in the men&#x27;s horizontal bar and women&#x27;s floor exercise due to a first-place tie in both events.

<text>Horace Gregory (April 10, 1898 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin – March 11, 1982 in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts) was a prize-winning American poet, translator of classic poetry, literary critic and college professor. He was awarded the Bollingen Prize in 1965.

==Life==
A graduate of the University of Wisconsin in 1923, he was the author of eight books of poems. He translated poems by the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid, and wrote biographies of Whistler and Amy Lowell. In 1925, he married poet and editor Marya Zaturenska (Pulitzer Prize winner for poetry, 1938; 1902–1982). They had two children: Patrick Bolten Gregory and Joanna Elizabeth Zeigler née Gregory.

His collected essays, &quot;Spirit of Time and Place&quot;, were published in 1973. He wrote book reviews that were published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His work appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Contemporary Poetry&quot;, &quot;The Wisconsin Literary Magazine&quot;, and &quot;Poetry Magazine&quot;.

Gregory&#x27;s poetry has been described as &quot;literary&quot; and as &quot;exhibit[ing] an awareness of the lives of working people, sometimes taking the form of the elegiac monologue.&quot; Poet Richard Eberhart said: &quot;The ruthlessness of the city used to be his interest; he used to depict realistic characters and situations within it. Now there is the general serenity, poise and lyrical concern with language.&quot; He added: &quot;Gregory is lyrical and straight-forward in these poems.&quot; Edgar Johnson, biographer of Charles Dickens and Sir Walter Scott among others, said that &quot;Mr. Gregory is not one of those scholar-critics who write only for other scholar-critics. He is a scholar without pedantry, who concentrates not on exhibitionism but illumination.&quot;

Gregory was a professor of English at Sarah Lawrence College for 26 years, from 1934 to 1960, when he became Professor Emeritus. One of his students was future children&#x27;s poet Myra Cohn Livingston.

He and Marya Zaturenska attended a 1948 reception at the Gotham Book Mart for Edith Sitwell. During the end of his life, Gregory and his wife were residents of Palisades, Rockland County, New York.

His papers are at Syracuse University.

<doc id="921159" wikidata="Q1046250" url="?curid=921159" title="PZL TS-11 Iskra">
<text>The PZL TS-11 &quot;Iskra&quot; () is a Polish jet trainer, developed and manufactured by aircraft company PZL-Mielec. It was used by the air forces of Poland and India. It is notable as being the first domestically developed jet aircraft to be produced by Poland, its service for over 50 years as the principal training aircraft of the Polish Air Force, and at the time of its retirement was the oldest jet-propelled aircraft still in service in Poland.

As a part of efforts to preserve Poland&#x27;s ability to independently develop aircraft in an era of political and economic subservience to the neighbouring Soviet Union, during the 1950s, Polish engineers at the Poland&#x27;s Aviation Institute (IL) commenced early work upon the design of what would become the first jet aircraft to be developed in Poland. Following the death of Joseph Stalin, work on the initiative could be performed more openly and government officials became supportive of such a venture. The fledgling design was heavily influenced by the requirements specified by the Polish Air Force, who had formalised a requirement for a jet-propelled aircraft for training purposes. On 5 February 1960, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by an imported British Armstrong Siddeley Viper turbojet engine.

During 1963, deliveries of the first production model of the type, designated as the &quot;TS-11 Iskra bis A&quot;, commenced to the Polish Air Force. During the 1960s, the Iskra competed to be selected as the standard jet trainer throughout the Warsaw Pact. However, it was not selected to fulfil this significant role, the rival Czechoslovakian Aero L-29 Delfín having been chosen instead, which went on to be built in greater numbers for a wide number of export customers. Production of the TS-11 came to an end during 1987, however the type remained in service with the Polish Air Force and the Indian Air Force into the 21st century. From 1969 onwards, a handful of TS-11s have been used by the Polish Air Force&#x27;s &quot;Biało-Czerwone Iskry&quot; aerobatics display team, who performed their last display on 22 August 2021. It has also been used for aerial reconnaissance purposes. During the aircraft&#x27;s later years of service, several examples have been sold onto private owners.

==Development==

Following the end of World War II, Poland was politically dominated by the neighbouring Soviet Union; as a consequence, the Polish aviation industry underwent vast changes at the behest of the Soviets. According to aviation author Jerzy K. Cynk, the immediate post-war decade was a period of frustrated efforts and disappointments, by early 1951, all of the nation&#x27;s design offices had been dissolved and the entirety of indigenous projects were terminated. Instead, Poland&#x27;s aircraft factories were assigned to produce mainly Russian-sourced military-orientated equipment to meet the requirements of the Soviet war machine, such as the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 fighter aircraft. Shortly following the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, military orders were drastically cut, leading to Polish aircraft plants falling idle and some being permanently closing down.

While the nation&#x27;s design offices had been liquidated, some former members had joined Poland&#x27;s Aviation Institute (1L) and performed some limited work on various original projects, even though such efforts were initially officially discouraged. As such, it was at IL that the effort to design would become the first jet aircraft to be developed in Poland originated; however, during the late 1950s, responsibility for the design work on the program was transferred to aircraft manufacturer PZL-Mielec at an early stage in order that IL could resume its primary mission of scientific and technological research. Much of the design work on the program was produced in response to the specified needs of a requirement issued by the Polish Air Force for a capable jet-propelled trainer aircraft, which was seeking a replacement for the piston-engined PZL TS-8 Bies at the time.

Polish government officials came to openly regard the project as being of considerable importance to the nation&#x27;s aviation industry, thus vigorous efforts were made to support the development of the TS-11. The main designer was Polish aeronautical engineer Tadeusz Sołtyk; his initials was the source for part of the type&#x27;s official designation &quot;TS-11&quot;. Early on, it was decided to adopt a foreign-sourced turbojet engine to power the aircraft. Quickly, the British Armstrong Siddeley Viper had emerged as the company&#x27;s favoured option; however, reportedly, negotiations for its acquisition eventually broken down; accordingly, work on the project was delayed until a suitable domestically built powerplant had reached an advanced stage of development.

On 5 February 1960, the first prototype conducted its maiden flight, powered by an imported Viper 8 engine, capable of producing up to 7.80 kN (1,750 lbf) of thrust. On 11 September 1960, the aircraft&#x27;s existence was publicly revealed during an aerial display held over Łódź. The next pair of prototypes, which performed their first flights during March and July 1961 respectively, were instead powered by a Polish copy of the Viper engine, designated as the WSK HO-10. The flight test program that the three prototypes were subjected to had both demonstrated the capabilities of the new aircraft and its suitability for satisfying the Polish Air Force&#x27;s stated requirements for a trainer jet; as such, it was soon accepted by the Polish Air Force.

During 1963, the first production model of the type, designated as the &quot;TS-11 Iskra bis A&quot;, commenced delivery to the service. From about 1966, new-build aircraft were furnished with a newer Polish-designed turbojet engine, designated as the WSK SO-1, which was capable of producing up to 9.80 kN (2,200 lbf) of thrust and reportedly gave the TS-11 a top speed of 497 mph. From 1969 onwards, the improved WSK SO-3 engine became available, offering considerably longer times between overhauls; this engine was later improved into the WSK SO-3W, which was able to generate 10.80 kN (2,425 lbf) of thrust.

==Design==

The PZL TS-11 Iskra is an all-metal jet-propelled trainer aircraft. It is relatively conventional in layout, featuring a trapezoid-shaped mid-wing arrangement. These wings, which only had a gentle angle of sweep along the leading edge, feature air intakes embedded into the wing root. The TS-11&#x27;s single turbojet engine is accommodated within the main fuselage, its exhaust is located beneath the boom-mounted tail fin, which provides the aircraft with a fairly unusual silhouette. Both of the crew, typically being the student in the front and instructor in the back, are provided with ejector seats for emergency egress.

Some models of the TS-11 can be armed; armaments have consisted of a single nose-mounted Nudelman-Rikhter NR-23 cannon with 80 rounds, along with a total of four underwing hardpoints that were compatible with a variety of different weapons, including bombs and rockets. Most models of the aircraft lack a radar set; however, the specialised &quot;TS-11R&quot; reconnaissance variant is provided with such equipment. The TS-11 can also be outfitted with various cameras for the purpose of performing aerial photography missions. Poland is currently developing the new TS-11S Iskra (Spark) as a future jet trainer. It will be equipped with new avionics, strengthened structures and a more powerful engine.

==Operational history==

During 1964, the TS-11 prototype broke four separate world records in its class, including a speed record, having been recorded as having attained a top speed of 839 km/h (524 mph) during one flight. From 1969 onwards, various TS-11s have been used by the Polish Air Force&#x27;s aerobatics display team, which was initially called &quot;Rombik&quot; and is currently named &quot;Biało-Czerwone Iskry&quot; (Translates to English as &quot;White-and-Red Sparks&quot;). Unusually for an Eastern European aircraft of the era, the TS-11 never received a NATO reporting name (for jet trainers, a two-syllable word starting with letter M) for the type.

During the 1960s, the Iskra competed to be selected as the standard jet trainer for the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet Union had given Poland a promise to support its aviation industry and to favour the procurement of suitable aircraft for this purpose from Polish manufacturers. However, the Iskra was not selected for this role, it had lost out to the Czechoslovak Aero L-29 Delfín, another newly designed jet-propelled trainer aircraft; according to aviation author John C. Fredrikson, this outcome had been highly unexpected and surprising to several observers. Largely as a result of this decision, Poland became the only Warsaw Pact member to adopt the Iskra while most others adopting the rival Delfin instead.

During 1975, an initial batch of 50 &quot;Iskra bis D&quot; trainer aircraft were exported to India, the type&#x27;s sole export customer; during the 1990s, a further 26 aircraft were delivered to the Indian Air Force. During its Indian service, a total of seven aircraft were reportedly lost, killing four crew. During December 2004, the Indian Air Force officially withdrew the last of its Iskra trainers. By 1987, a total of 424 aircraft had reportedly been constructed, after which point production of the type was terminated due to a lack of demand.

During 2002, the Polish Air Force reportedly still operated a fleet of 110 TS-11s, including 5 TS-11R reconnaissance aircraft. The Iskra became the first and so far the only Polish jet trainer to reach serial production – the programme intended to produce a successor, the PZL I-22 Iryda (later designated as the &quot;M-93 Iryda&quot;), failed for several reasons and only a few were completed during the 1990s before the program was aborted. In its place, the TS-11 has been considered for upgrades to better enable its continued service; however, during 2010, the Polish Air Force issued a tender for a new advanced jet pilot training system to eventually replace the TS-11.

By 2013, Poland was stated to have a total of 30 (total number of school aircraft: TS-11, PZL-130) operational Iskras still in service. During 2016, Poland took delivery of its first few Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Masters, a modern trainer aircraft which, in conjunction with ground-based training equipment such as flight simulators, shall progressively take on the Polish Air Force&#x27;s training needs. On the 9 December 2020 the last Polish Air Force training sortie of the TS-11 Iskra serial number 2001 took place after which the jet training of the Polish Air Force passed to the Alenia Aermacchi M-346 Master of which Poland has 12 in service as of December 2020. The only Polish Air Force TS-11 left flying in Poland after 9 December 2020 were the display team TS-11 from Team Iskry, who performed their final display on 22 August 2021.

<text>Kyle Keith Shewfelt (born May 6, 1982 in Calgary, Alberta) is a Canadian gymnast. His gold medal in the men&#x27;s floor exercise competition at the 2004 Athens Olympics was the first-ever medal for a Canadian in an artistic gymnastics event and was the first Canadian gold of the 2004 Olympics. He also has a vault named after him.

Shewfelt was considered a medal threat in advance of the Athens games. In the end, Shewfelt finished first on floor and fourth on vault.

==Gymnastics career==
Born in Calgary, he first began practicing gymnastics in 1988 influenced by a neighbour. His father was also an athlete playing for the Brandon Wheat Kings hockey team. While Shewfelt was a skilled hockey player he turned to gymnastics at an early age. He attended Calgary&#x27;s National Sport School in order to complete his high school education, while pursuing his Olympic plans with fellow athletes at the school Kyle trained at Altadore Gymnastic Club under coach Kelly Manjak, from age six up until the 2004 Olympics. Manjak married in 2004 and moved following the Olympics to Ontario. Shewfelt stayed in Calgary, training with coach Tony Smith at the University of Calgary.

In 2000 Kyle was unexpectedly, due to his young age, selected for the Sydney Olympics. He competed in the individual floor and vault event qualifications in ranks of 12 and 26, respectively, and did not qualify to the finals in either.

He caught the attention of judges performing a new vault, a Yurchenko with two and one half twists. The new move was ratified by the judges and subsequently named the Shewfelt vault.

Shewfelt&#x27;s long-held goal of Olympic gold was endangered when he severely bruised the talus bone in his ankle in March 2004, but he made a full recovery in time for Athens. Before the Olympics, Shewfelt speculated on moving to Cirque du Soleil after his athletic career is over.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, there was some controversy when Shewfelt was marginally edged out by Marian Drăgulescu of Romania with an average combined score of 9.612 to the bronze medal in the individual vault final by 0.013 points despite Drăgulescu falling in his second vault and Shewfelt completing two comparatively well-executed vaults with an average combined score of 9.599.

In 2005 Shewfelt played Kelly Manjak in the Hungarian made film White Palms.

In 2006 Shewfelt made a comeback to the international scene, leading the Canadian team to a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, collecting bronze on Floor and gold on Vault for himself.

That same year, Shewfelt helped his team to a second-place finish at the Pacific Alliance competition. In the individual events, Shewfelt placed first on vault and floor.

Next was the world championships in Denmark where Shewfelt led his team to a best ever team ranking (6th) and where he collected another world championship medal (bronze on floor exercise).

In August 2007, Kyle fractured both of his tibias in a fluke landing training for floor exercise just prior to the world championships in Germany. Withdrawing from the event, Kyle hoped to heal and get back into training in sufficient time to make a bid for the 2008 Summer Olympic team.

After 11 months of intense rehab and recovery, Kyle was named to his third Canadian Olympic team. He was selected to represent Canada in Beijing after proving that he was in top form at a test competition capping a week-long training camp in Calgary.

At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Kyle competed in the preliminary artistic gymnastics round. Shewfelt was unable to reach the top eight in either of his specialties (the cut-off for admission to the Olympic finals), finishing ninth in vault and 11th in floor. Shewfelt received the highest execution score (B score) for the two vaults he performed (9.75). After his exit from the Olympics, Kyle became a guest commentator on artistic gymnastics for CBC Television&#x27;s Olympic coverage.

On May 21, 2009, Shewfelt announced on his blog that he was retiring from competition.

&quot;After much thought and consideration, I have come to the decision that it&#x27;s time to hang up the grips, put away the stinky gym shoes, remove the singlet, take my hands out of the chalk bucket and start embarking on new journeys,&quot; Shewfelt wrote. He would take on an ambassador role with Gymnastics Canada to promote this sport.

==Later life==
During the 2012 London Olympics, he served as a gymnastics analyst for the CTV Television Network-led Canadian Olympic Broadcast Media Consortium.

In 2018, he was working as a gymnastics coach.

In 2021, he published an autobiography, &quot;Make it Happen&quot;.

<text>The expansion of the universe is parametrized by a dimensionless scale factor formula_1. Also known as the cosmic scale factor or sometimes the Robertson–Walker scale factor, this is a key parameter of the Friedmann equations.

In the early stages of the Big Bang, most of the energy was in the form of radiation, and that radiation was the dominant influence on the expansion of the universe. Later, with cooling from the expansion the roles of matter and radiation changed and the universe entered a matter-dominated era. Recent results suggest that we have already entered an era dominated by dark energy, but examination of the roles of matter and radiation are most important for understanding the early universe.

Using the dimensionless scale factor to characterize the expansion of the universe, the effective energy densities of radiation and matter scale differently. This leads to a radiation-dominated era in the very early universe but a transition to a matter-dominated era at a later time and, since about 4 billion years ago, a subsequent dark-energy-dominated era.

==Detail==
Some insight into the expansion can be obtained from a Newtonian expansion model which leads to a simplified version of the Friedmann equation. It relates the proper distance (which can change over time, unlike the comoving distance formula_2 which is constant and set to today&#x27;s distance) between a pair of objects, e.g. two galaxy clusters, moving with the Hubble flow in an expanding or contracting FLRW universe at any arbitrary time formula_3 to their distance at some reference time formula_4. The formula for this is:
:formula_5
where formula_6 is the proper distance at epoch formula_3, formula_8 is the distance at the reference time formula_4, usually also referred to as comoving distance, and formula_10 is the scale factor. Thus, by definition, formula_11 and formula_12.

The scale factor is dimensionless, with formula_3 counted from the birth of the universe and formula_4 set to the present age of the universe: formula_15 giving the current value of formula_16 as formula_17 or formula_18.

The evolution of the scale factor is a dynamical question, determined by the equations of general relativity, which are presented in the case of a locally isotropic, locally homogeneous universe by the Friedmann equations.

The Hubble parameter is defined as:

:formula_19

where the dot represents a time derivative. The Hubble parameter varies with time, not with space, with the Hubble constant formula_20 being its current value.

From the previous equation formula_21 one can see that formula_22, and also that formula_23, so combining these gives formula_24, and substituting the above definition of the Hubble parameter gives formula_25 which is just Hubble&#x27;s law.

Current evidence suggests that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which means that the second derivative of the scale factor formula_26 is positive, or equivalently that the first derivative formula_27 is increasing over time. This also implies that any given galaxy recedes from us with increasing speed over time, i.e. for that galaxy formula_28 is increasing with time. In contrast, the Hubble parameter seems to be decreasing with time, meaning that if we were to look at some fixed distance d and watch a series of different galaxies pass that distance, later galaxies would pass that distance at a smaller velocity than earlier ones.

According to the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric which is used to model the expanding universe, if at present time we receive light from a distant object with a redshift of &quot;z&quot;, then the scale factor at the time the object originally emitted that light is formula_29.

==Chronology==
===Radiation-dominated era===
After Inflation, and until about 47,000 years after the Big Bang, the dynamics of the early universe were set by radiation (referring generally to the constituents of the universe which moved relativistically, principally photons and neutrinos).

For a radiation-dominated universe the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric is obtained solving the Friedmann equations:
:formula_30

===Matter-dominated era===
Between about 47,000 years and 9.8 billion years after the Big Bang, the energy density of matter exceeded both the energy density of radiation and the vacuum energy density.

When the early universe was about 47,000 years old (redshift 3600), mass–energy density surpassed the radiation energy, although the universe remained optically thick to radiation until the universe was about 378,000 years old (redshift 1100). This second moment in time (close to the time of recombination), at which the photons which compose the cosmic microwave background radiation were last scattered, is often mistaken as marking the end of the radiation era.

For a matter-dominated universe the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations:
:formula_31

===Dark-energy-dominated era===
In physical cosmology, the dark-energy-dominated era is proposed as the last of the three phases of the known universe, the other two being the radiation-dominated era and the matter-dominated era. The dark-energy-dominated era began after the matter-dominated era, i.e. when the Universe was about 9.8 billion years old. In the era of cosmic inflation, the Hubble parameter is also thought to be constant, so the expansion law of the dark-energy-dominated era also holds for the inflationary prequel of the big bang.

The cosmological constant is given the symbol Λ, and, considered as a source term in the Einstein field equation, can be viewed as equivalent to a &quot;mass&quot; of empty space, or dark energy. Since this increases with the volume of the universe, the expansion pressure is effectively constant, independent of the scale of the universe, while the other terms decrease with time. Thus, as the density of other forms of matter – dust and radiation – drops to very low concentrations, the cosmological constant (or &quot;dark energy&quot;) term will eventually dominate the energy density of the Universe. Recent measurements of the change in Hubble constant with time, based on observations of distant supernovae, show this acceleration in expansion rate, indicating the presence of such dark energy.

For a dark-energy-dominated universe, the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations:
:formula_32
Here, the coefficient formula_20in the exponential, the Hubble constant, is
:formula_34
This exponential dependence on time makes the spacetime geometry identical to the de Sitter universe, and only holds for a positive sign of the cosmological constant, which is the case according to the currently accepted value of the cosmological constant, Λ, that is approximately 
The current density of the observable universe is of the order of and the age of the universe is of the order of 13.8 billion years, or . The Hubble constant, formula_20, is (The Hubble time is 13.79 billion years).

<doc id="921174" wikidata="Q679541" url="?curid=921174" title="1964 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1964 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVIII Olympiad, and commonly known as Tokyo 1964, were an international multi-sport event held in Tokyo, Japan, from 9 to 24 October. A total of 5,151 athletes representing 93 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 163 events across 19 sports and 24 disciplines. Two new sports were introduced to the Summer Olympic Games program in Tokyo: judo and volleyball. The inclusion of volleyball marked the first time that a women&#x27;s team sport had been introduced.

The 1964 Summer Games were the first Olympics held in Asia, and marked the first time South Africa was excluded for using its apartheid system in sports. North Korea and Indonesia withdrew their athletes from the 1964 Summer Olympics just before the games were due to start, as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) were refusing to accept any athletes who had participated in the Games of the New Emerging Forces held in Jakarta, Indonesia, in 1963. China continued their boycott of the games, which began in 1952 and lasted until 1980, over the participation of Taiwan.

Overall, 41 teams received at least one medal, with 26 of them winning at least one gold medal. Athletes from the Soviet Union won the most medals overall, with 96, while the United States won the most gold medals, with 36. The Bahamas won their first gold medal ever, doing so in the star class sailing event, while athletes from Kenya, Nigeria, and Tunisia won their nations&#x27; first Olympic medals of any kind.

Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina won the most medals at the games with six (two gold, two silver, and two bronze). With 18 total Olympic medals, Latynina became the world record holder for most Olympic medals won by an individual, a record that stood for 48 years until swimmer Michael Phelps surpassed that mark at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She also became the record holder for most gold and total Olympic medals by a female athlete.

== Medal table ==

The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

At the 1964 Summer Olympics, athletes were tied in three events, all of which were gymnastics events. In the men&#x27;s artistic individual all-around event there was a three-way tie for second, which resulted in three silver medals and no bronze medal being awarded. In the men&#x27;s floor event, two silver medals and no bronze medal were awarded due to a tie. Lastly, in the women&#x27;s vault event, two silver medals and no bronze medal were awarded due to a tie.

<text>Justin Alexander Gatlin (born February 10, 1982) is a retired American sprinter who competed in the 60 meters, 100 meters, and 200 meters. He is the 2004 Olympic Champion in the 100 meters, the 2005 and 2017 World Champion in the 100 meters, the 2005 World Champion in the 200 meters, and the 2019 World Champion in the 4 x 100 meters relay. In addition, Gatlin is the 2003 and 2012 World Indoor Champion in the 60 meters. He is a 5-time Olympic medalist and a 12-time World Championship medalist. At the World Athletics Relays, Gatlin won two gold medals in the 4 x 100 meters relay in 2015 and 2017. Gatlin is also a record 3-time Diamond League Champion in the 100 meters. He won the Diamond League trophy in 2013, 2014 and 2015.

Justin Gatlin&#x27;s personal best of 9.74 seconds ranks fifth on the all-time list of male 100-meter athletes. He is a two-time 100 meters World Champion (2005 &amp; 2017) and a two-time 60 meters World Indoor Champion (2003 &amp; 2012). Gatlin won both the 100 meters and 200 meters at the 2005 World Championships. He is also a World Champion in the 4 x 100 meters relay, which the United States of America team won at the 2019 World Championships.

In 2001, he incurred a two-year ban from athletics for testing positive for amphetamines, later reduced to one year because of an appeal. In 2006, he incurred a further four-year ban for testing positive for testosterone, with this sanction erasing his then-world-record time of 9.77 seconds in the 100 meters.

Gatlin returned to competition in August 2010. In June 2012 at the US Olympic trials, Gatlin ran a time of 9.80 seconds, which was the fastest-ever time recorded for a man over the age of 30. In May 2015 at the IAAF Doha Diamond League, at the age of 33, Gatlin broke his own 100m record for a man over the age of 30 by running 9.74 seconds, also Gatlin&#x27;s personal best over the distance.

Gatlin won the gold medal in the 100 meters at the 2004 Olympics. At the London 2012 Olympics, he ran a time of 9.79 seconds, earning a bronze medal. He won his third Olympic medal in the 100 meters in the 2016 Olympic 100-meter final, finishing with the silver. At 34, he became the oldest man to win an Olympic medal in a non-relay sprint event. At the age of 35, Gatlin won the gold medal in the 100 meters at the 2017 World Championships, 12 years after his first triumph in the event. At the 2019 World Championships, Gatlin won the silver medal in the 100m in a time of 9.89, making him the most decorated 100m sprinter in World Championship history, with a record of five individual 100m medals. Gatlin&#x27;s tally of eight global championship 100m medals (three Olympic and five World Championship) makes him the most decorated 100m sprinter of all time, a feat he accomplished at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in Doha.

He announced his retirement from the sport in 2022 on his 40th birthday.

===High school and collegiate career===
Gatlin attended Woodham High School in Pensacola, Florida, where he competed as a hurdler. He was eventually noticed by University of Tennessee coaches Vince Anderson and Bill Webb, who awarded him a scholarship and trained him to become a sprinter rather than a hurdler. In 2001, in his freshman year at Tennessee, Gatlin won NCAA outdoor titles in both the 100 and 200 meters.

===Amphetamines ban===
Not long after, Gatlin was banned from international competition for two years by the IAAF after testing positive for amphetamines. Gatlin appealed on the grounds that the positive test had been due to medication that he had been taking since his childhood, when he was diagnosed with attention deficit disorder. The appeal resulted in an early reinstatement by the IAAF. Gatlin was banned from international competition, but was still allowed to compete nationally as an NCAA athlete, and he went on to win 4 more NCAA titles; however, these do not count for records purposes on his international profile.

In an unexpected move, Gatlin decided to turn professional after his sophomore season, foregoing his remaining two years of collegiate eligibility. He moved to Florida to begin training with new coach Trevor Graham.

==Professional career==

===2003: World Indoor Champion===
In his first indoor season as a professional athlete, Gatlin won the national 60 meters title in Boston in 6.45 seconds, a personal best. 2 weeks later, Gatlin stormed to his first world title, clocking 6.46 at the World Indoor Championships in Birmingham.

Not long after, Gatlin suffered a hamstring injury and was forced to miss the 2003 National Championships in Palo Alto, meaning he would miss the World Championships in Paris as well. On August 15, despite a very inconsistent few months, Gatlin finally broke ten seconds in the 100 meters for the first time, with 9.97 at the Weltklasse Zürich. In order to fully recover and prepare for next year&#x27;s Olympic Games in Athens, Gatlin and his coach decided to skip the 2004 indoor season.

===2004: Olympic Champion===
Gatlin&#x27;s plan worked and he qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, after finishing 2nd in both the 100 meters and 200 meters at the Olympic Trials in Sacramento. The following month, Gatlin made history and won the Olympic 100 meter title in 9.85 seconds, a new personal best, only one hundredth slower than the Olympic record. The finish was incredibly tight, with Francis Obikwelu of Portugal one hundredth behind for the silver medal, his teammate and defending champion Maurice Greene another hundredth back for the bronze medal, and his other teammate Shawn Crawford another two hundredths back for 4th place. In the 200 meters, Gatlin won the bronze medal, completing an American sweep of the podium behind Crawford (Gold) and Bernard Williams (Silver) Finally, he won the silver medal as a member of the 4 × 100 meters relay squad.

In the fall of 2004, Gatlin graduated from Tennessee.

===2005: World Champion===
With an Olympic title under his belt, Gatlin was favored for the 100 meter title at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, along with Asafa Powell of Jamaica, who broke the 100m world record. Gatlin won the 100/200 double at the 2005 National Championships in Carson; his first national outdoor titles. Then, Powell pulled out of the world championships due to injury, effectively removing any opposition to Gatlin. He went on to win the 100 in 9.88, a season&#x27;s best; his winning margin of 0.17 seconds was the widest in world championship 100m history. With Crawford not entered, Gatlin won the 200 as well, becoming the second man in history to win both events at a single world championships. His fellow Americans also took the 2nd, 3rd and 4th places, the first time any nation had swept the top 4 positions at a world championship.

===2006: World Record===
On May 12, at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, Gatlin initially broke the 100-meter world record with 9.76 seconds, one hundredth faster than Powell&#x27;s record of 9.77 set the previous year. 4 days later however, the IAAF revealed on that his time had been 9.766 seconds, which was subsequently rounded up to 9.77, in line with regulations. Shortly thereafter, with the track and field community itching for a Gatlin-Powell showdown, the two both appeared at the Prefontaine Classic in Oregon. No agreement could be reached with the meet organizers, however, so the two competed in separate heats. Gatlin won the event with a time of 9.88 seconds over Powell&#x27;s 9.93 seconds.

===2006 doping ban===
On July 29, a month after winning the US title, Gatlin told the media that he had been informed by the USADA that he had given a positive doping test in April the same year. He claimed his innocence in the matter:
 It is believed that the substance that Gatlin tested positive for was &quot;testosterone or its precursor.&quot; The failed test was revealed after a relay race on April 22, 2006, in Lawrence, Kansas. The &quot;B&quot; sample was confirmed as positive in July.

Gatlin&#x27;s coach, Trevor Graham, had eight athletes who had tested positive or received bans for performance-enhancing drugs. After Gatlin&#x27;s failed test, Graham stated in an interview that Gatlin had been sabotaged. He blamed massage therapist Christopher Whetstine for rubbing a cream containing testosterone onto Gatlin&#x27;s buttocks without his knowledge. The therapist denied the claim, saying: &quot;Trevor Graham is not speaking on behalf of Justin Gatlin and the story about me is not true.&quot;

On August 22, Gatlin accepted an eight-year ban from track and field, avoiding a lifetime ban in exchange for his cooperation with the doping authorities, and because of the &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot; surrounding his first positive drug test. Gatlin appealed against the ban; an arbitration panel reduced it to four years at a hearing in December 2007. The USADA&#x27;s chief executive officer explained &quot;Given his cooperation and the circumstances relating to Mr Gatlin&#x27;s first offence, the four-year penalty issued by the arbitration panel is a fair and just outcome&quot;. His 9.77 was subsequently annulled.

On December 19, 2006, ESPN reported that Gatlin would work with Woodham High School&#x27;s track team as a voluntary coach, helping his old high school with &quot;some workouts, sprint work, block work, where he sees something and can give encouragement.&quot;

===Possible NFL career===
It was reported that Gatlin planned to serve his four-year ban from the track on a football field. On November 29, 2006, ESPN reported that Gatlin had worked out with the Houston Texans, although he has little football experience and &quot;has not played football since 10th grade&quot;.

On May 4, 2007, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers announced that Gatlin was one of 28 free agents taken to their 2007 rookie camp on tryout contracts, and was considered to be the most intriguing unsigned athlete in attendance. He tried out for the team as a wide receiver. He was unsuccessful, though he stated that he believed that he had all the necessary skills and that the only reason he did not make the team was because coaches viewed him as a &quot;track guy.&quot;

===Comeback preparation===
During the course of his ban, Gatlin&#x27;s weight ballooned to over 200lbs. He found a new coach in Loren Seagrave, who helped Gatlin shave his weight down to 183lbs, his weight when he won the Olympic title 6 years prior. In his absence, Gatlin&#x27;s teammate Tyson Gay took the 100, 200 and 4x100 meters relay titles at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics in Osaka. Then, Usain Bolt of Jamaica won the 100, 200 and 4x100 meters relay in historic world record times at the 2008 Summer Olympic in Beijing, then did it again the following year at the World Championships in Berlin. Gatlin was preparing to go up against a new generation of talent in both Bolt and his Jamaican teammates.

===2010 and 2011: Comeback===
On August 3, 2010, Gatlin made his return to the athletics circuit with a tour of Estonia and Finland. He won the 100 meters in Rakvere, recording 10.24 seconds. At the Ergo World Challenge meeting in Tallinn he improved further with a win in 10.17 seconds. His coach, Loren Seagrave, acknowledged that the sprinter&#x27;s starts were poor, but that Gatlin&#x27;s finish to the race remained strong. Running at the final meet of the Finnish Elite Games series in Joensuu, Gatlin won in the absence of injured Steve Mullings. In Rovereto, Italy, on August 31, 2010, Gatlin was placed second in the 100 meters with a time of 10.09 seconds, behind Yohan Blake, who won in 10.06 seconds.

After the 2010 season, Gatlin switched coaches to Brooks Johnson. On June 25, 2011, at the 2011 USA Track &amp; Field Championships, Gatlin was second behind Walter Dix with a season&#x27;s best time of 9.95 seconds; his first sub-10 second performance in 5 years. He represented the United States at the IAAF World Championships in Daegu, South Korea, where he was eliminated in the semi-finals of the 100 meters.

===2012: World Indoor Champion and Return to Olympic Games===

Under the coaching of former Olympian Dennis Mitchell, 2012 proved to be Gatlin&#x27;s most successful season yet. He returned to the indoor circuit and finished second in the 60 meters at the national indoor championships in Albuquerque. Then, two weeks later, Gatlin stormed to the World Indoor Championship title in the 60 meters once again, clocking 6.46 seconds; the same time he ran to win the indoor title 9 years prior.

Outdoors, Gatlin returned to the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix, the same meet and venue where he broke the 100 meter world record until it was annulled. He won in 9.87 seconds, defeating Asafa Powell by one hundredth of a second. After taking wins in Daegu, Rabat, and at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Gatlin placed himself as a favorite for a medal at the 2012 London Olympics. On June 24, Gatlin won the 100-meter final at the Olympic Trials in Eugene, Oregon with a personal best time of 9.80 seconds, which was then the fastest time in history for a man over 30.

On August 5, 2012, at the London 2012 Summer Olympics, he recorded a new personal best time of 9.79 seconds in the 100 meters final, when he won bronze behind Usain Bolt and Yohan Blake.

===2013: World Championships Silver Medalist and Diamond League Champion===
On June 6, 2013, Gatlin beat world record holder Usain Bolt by one-hundredth of a second to win the 100 meters at the Golden Gala meet in Rome, Italy. On August 11, 2013, Gatlin won a silver medal behind Usain Bolt in the 100 meters at the IAAF World Championships in a time of 9.85. Bolt won the race in 9.77. Gatlin also took another silver in the 4 × 100-meter relay, crossing the line in 37.66 seconds, behind the Jamaican team that won in 37.36 seconds. With Diamond League victories in Doha, Eugene, Rome and Monaco in 2013, Gatlin became the Diamond League Champion in the 100 meters for the first time in his career.

===2014: Diamond League Champion===
On September 5, 2014, Gatlin won the 100 meters at the IAAF Diamond League final in Brussels with a personal best of 9.77 seconds. He then went on to complete a sprint double at the meet, winning the 200 meters in a time of 19.71 seconds. This was the second fastest time of the season, behind his world lead of 19.68 that he set at the Monaco Diamond League earlier in the year. Gatlin&#x27;s 9.77 time in the 100 meters time and 19.71 time in the 200 meters became the fastest single day 100 and 200 meters performance ever recorded. Gatlin&#x27;s victory in the 100 meters secured him the Diamond League trophy for the second straight year. Gatlin&#x27;s performances earned him a nomination for IAAF Athlete of the Year. Other athletes responded skeptically to Gatlin, questioning whether he is continuing to benefit from the banned substances taken earlier in his career. German discus champion Robert Harting requested to the IAAF that his nomination for Athlete of the Year be rescinded in protest at Gatlin being nominated.

===2015: Diamond League Champion, World Relays Champion and Gatlin&#x27;s fastest season ===
On May 2, 2015, Gatlin won the gold medal in the 4 × 100 meters relay at the World Athletics Relays in Nassau, Bahamas. It was the first defeat for Usain Bolt and Jamaica team in the 4 × 100 meters relay since 2007. The American quartet, consisting of Mike Rodgers, Tyson Gay, Ryan Bailey and Justin Gatlin, ran a time of 37.38 to win the 4 × 100 meters relay at the World Athletics Relays. On May 15, 2015, Gatlin improved his personal best to 9.74 seconds (+0.9 m/s) at the Qatar Athletic Super Grand Prix. His time was the fastest in the world since Yohan Blake ran 9.69 seconds in August 2012. It was the ninth-best performance in history and improved Gatlin&#x27;s standing as the fifth best 100 meters athlete of all time. On May 30, Gatlin equalled his 200m personal best at the Prefontaine Classic, running 19.68, a new world lead. On June 5, 2015, Gatlin beat Usain Bolt&#x27;s 100-meter 2012 Rome Diamond League record of 9.76 seconds, finishing with a time of 9.75 seconds. At the USATF Track and Field Championships, Gatlin set a new personal best in the 200 meters, running 19.57 which was the fifth fastest performance in history. On the 9th of July at the Lausanne Diamond League, Gatlin ran 9.75 once again and beat Tyson Gay and Asafa Powell by a considerable margin. In his final Diamond League before the World Championships, Gatlin ran 9.78 at the on July 17 at the Monaco Diamond League, setting the Meeting Record.

On August 23, 2015, Gatlin ran 9.77 in his semi-final of the 100 meters at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing — the fastest time ever recorded in a preliminary or semi final round in World Championship or Olympic history — and was the heavy favorite to win gold. Gatlin finished second behind Usain Bolt in the final; Bolt&#x27;s winning time was 9.79 seconds, with Gatlin 0.01 seconds behind. On August 27, 2015, Gatlin finished second behind by Bolt in the final of the 200 meters at the same event, with a time of 19.74 seconds, 0.19 seconds behind Bolt&#x27;s 19.55 seconds.

On September 11, Gatlin ended his 2015 season with a victory at the Brussels Diamond League and secured the Diamond League trophy for the third consecutive year, winning the 100 meters in a time of 9.98.

Gatlin&#x27;s 2015 is one of the fastest seasons in sprinting history and he became the only man to ever run below 9.80 on five separate occasions in one season.

===2016: Olympic Games silver medalist===
Before the start of his outdoor season, Gatlin ran the 100 m in 9.45 s which would be a world record but was assisted by a wind turbine. After beginning the season with Diamond League victories in Shanghai in 9.94, and Eugene in 9.88, Gatlin won the 100 meters in 9.80 seconds and 200 meters in 19.75 seconds at the 2016 United States Olympic Trials, becoming the oldest sprinter to make an American Olympic team.

At the 2016 Rio Olympics, Gatlin received a silver medal in the 100 meters final with a time of 9.89 seconds. Usain Bolt, who won gold, had a time of 9.81 seconds. Gatlin also ran in the qualifying heats of the 200 meters. However, with a time of 20.13 seconds in the semi-finals, he failed to qualify for the final. To qualify for the final, he would have needed to have run 20.09.

===2017: World Champion and World Relays Champion===
On April 22, 2017, Gatlin won the gold medal in the 4 × 100 meters relay for the second time in his career at the World Athletics Relays in Nassau, Bahamas. At the 2017 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Justin Gatlin won the 100 meters in 9.95 seconds, beating young favorite Christian Coleman, who clocked 9.98 seconds. In doing so, he broke Kim Collins&#x27; World M35 Masters Record of 9.96 seconds, and was 0.02 of a second away from breaking the World Masters All-Time record of 9.93 also from Collins. He opted out of the 200 meters after his Olympic injury, which was caused by a rolled ankle coming off the turn.

Gatlin was a surprise champion at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics, winning gold in the 100 meters in a time of 9.92 seconds, beating Usain Bolt, the greatest sprinter of all time. Despite the crowd being against him, he won the World title twelve years after his first 100 m World title at the 2005 World Championships. He beat his American teammate Christian Coleman, who won the silver, and Usain Bolt (in his final World Championships) who earned the bronze. Several spectators booed at the result, and IAAF President Lord Coe commented that he should have been banned for life. Usain Bolt, however, condemned the booing as unfair and emphasised that Gatlin worked very hard.

After reports surfaced involving Dennis Mitchell in a doping scandal, Gatlin fired his coach and returned to former coach Brooks Johnson.

===2019: 4x100 meters World Champion===
After an off season in 2018 — with no global outdoor championship — Gatlin ran 9.87 seconds in the 100 meters at the Prefontaine Classic in Stanford, California, finishing second to teammate Christian Coleman, who ran a world-leading 9.81. Gatlin&#x27;s 9.87 improved upon his own world masters record from 9.92, as well as making him the fourth fastest man in the world for that year. In July, it was revealed that Gatlin, along with several of his teammates, were sent to train with Dennis Mitchell again by Nike, despite the recent doping investigations.

Gatlin won the silver medal in the 100m final at the 2019 World Athletics Championships in an attempt to defend his world title. His time of 9.89s was .13 seconds behind his teammate Christian Coleman, who won gold in 9.76 seconds. At 37 years, 230 days, Gatlin became the oldest sprinter to win a medal in the men&#x27;s 100 meters at the World Athletics Championships. At the same World Championships, Gatlin was part of the American team who won gold in the 4 x 100 meters relay, the first time he had won the event in his career at World Championships. The American quartet, consisting of Christian Coleman, Noah Lyles, Michael Rodgers and Gatlin, ran a time of 37.10, the fastest-ever by an American team, breaking the previous American record of 37.38 set at the 2012 London Olympics.

===2021: Bid for the Tokyo Olympics===
In 2021, Gatlin attempted to become the oldest man to win a medal in the 100m by qualifying for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan at the age of 39. In April 2021, he won the Tom Jones Memorial Invitational with a time of 9.98 against a field of potential gold medal contenders. At the 2020 US Olympic Trials, Gatlin finished 2nd in his first heat and third in the semifinals to earn a spot in the final. During the final he came up with a hamstring injury and limped across the finish line in last place, ending his chances of qualifying for the Tokyo Olympics.

<doc id="921189" wikidata="Q461799" url="?curid=921189" title="1960 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1960 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Rome, Italy, from August 25 to September 11, 1960. A total of 5,338 athletes representing 83 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included five teams making their Olympic debut at the Summer Games: the British West Indies, Morocco, San Marino, Sudan, and Tunisia. The games featured 150 events in 17 sports across 23 disciplines.

Athletes representing 44 NOCs received at least one medal, with 23 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union won the most overall medals, with 103, and the most gold medals, with 43. The British West Indies, Republic of China (now competing as Chinese Taipei), Ethiopia, Ghana, Iraq, Morocco, and Singapore won their first Summer Olympic medals of any kind, with Ethiopia and Pakistan winning their first gold medals.

Among individual participants, Soviet gymnast Boris Shakhlin won the most gold medals, with four, and the most total medals, with seven (four gold, two silver, and one bronze). Italian fencer Edoardo Mangiarotti secured two medals at the 1960 games (one gold, one silver) and became the record holder for the most Olympic medals won, with 13 medals in total (six gold, five silver, two bronze). Mangiarotti had won medals at the 1936 (one gold), 1948 (two silver, one bronze), 1952 (two gold, two silver), and 1956 games (two gold, one bronze) prior to 1960.

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

Events in boxing resulted in bronze medals being awarded to each of the competitors who lost their semi-final matches, as opposed to them taking part in a third place tiebreaker.

In women&#x27;s high jump, a two-way tie for second resulted in two silvers and no bronze medals being awarded. In the men&#x27;s pommel horse and men&#x27;s vault, two-way ties for first resulted in two gold and no silver medals being awarded in each event. Lastly, in the men&#x27;s ring event, there was a two-way tie for third which resulted in two bronze medals being awarded.

<text>The River Esk (), also known as the Border Esk, is a river that rises in the Scottish region of Dumfries and Galloway before crossing the border to the English county of Cumbria and flowing into the Solway Firth.

== Course ==
The river rises in the hills to the east of Moffat and its two main tributaries, the Black Esk and the White Esk, merge at the southern end of Castle O&#x27;er Forest. It flows south east through Eskdale past Langholm. Near Langholm the river is crossed by the Duchess Bridge which is said to be the oldest iron bridge in Scotland. The Esk merges with Liddel Water (which defines the border between Scotland and England). Before passing Longtown the river enters England and merges with the River Lyne and enters the Solway Firth near the mouth of the River Eden.

It was formerly one of the boundaries of the Debatable Lands as marked by the Scots&#x27; Dike.

== Tributaries ==
The various tributaries of the Esk are described proceeding downstream.

The White Esk arises as the Glendearg and Tomleuchar burns merge then flow south through Eskdalemuir Forest capturing the waters of the Garwald Water at Garwaldwaterfoot then continuing by the village of Eskdalemuir into Castle O&#x27;er Forest. It is followed by the B709 road for much of its course. The headwaters of the Black Esk feed into the Black Esk Reservoir, from the foot of whose dam, the Black Esk flows south to Sandyford where it is crossed by the B723 road. It then turns sharply east then southeast passing Castle O&#x27;er on its way to meet with the White Esk to form the River Esk.

The Meggat Water (not to be confused with Megget Water) is a left bank tributary of the Esk which rises at the southern margin of Craik Forest and flows south, being joined by the Stennies Water before its confluence with the Esk. The Ewes Water is a significant left bank tributary of the Esk which enters the latter at Langholm. Its headwaters, the Eweslees, Mosspaul and Carewoodrig Burns merge and flow southwards as the Ewes Water for several miles, being joined by numerous further burns, the most significant of which is the Meikledale Burn. The valley of the Ewes Water is followed by the A7 road from Carlisle to Edinburgh and by an electricity transmission line. Wauchope Water is a right bank tributary of the Esk which joins immediately downstream from the Ewes Water confluence. It arises as the Logan Water and Bigholms Burn meet southwest of Langholm. The Tarras Water is a left bank tributary of the Esk which joins it south of Langholm.

The Liddel Water is a major tributary which enters on the left bank between Canonbie and Longtown. It forms the boundary between Scotland and England for a while as does its tributary, the Kershope Burn. The River Lyne enters on the left bank at Lynefoot just above the normal tidal limit of the estuarial section of the Esk. The River Sark and the Kirtle Water enter the tidal estuary of the Esk to the east and west of Gretna respectively. See main articles on each of these and some of their tributaries.

<text>The 1956 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XVI Olympiad, and officially branded as Melbourne 1956, were an international multi-sport event held from 22 November to 8 December in Melbourne, Australia, with the equestrian events being held from 10 to 17 June 1956 in Stockholm, Sweden, due to Australian quarantine regulations that required a six-month pre-shipment quarantine on horses. Medals awarded in these cities bore different designs. A total of 3,314 athletes representing 72 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which was a record for the most NOCs at a single Olympics at the time. This figure included first-time entrants Cambodia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Kenya, Liberia, Malaya, North Borneo, and Uganda. The games featured 151 events in 17 sports across 23 disciplines.

The 1956 Summer Games were the first to be held in the Southern Hemisphere and Oceania, and the first games to hold events in two different countries, continents, and seasons. Multiple boycotts were enacted by nine teams against the games, though five of them competed in the equestrian events. Egypt, Iraq, and Lebanon boycotted the games in response to the Suez Crisis. Cambodia, Liechtenstein, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland boycotted the games in response to the Hungarian Uprising, when the Soviet Union invaded the country. China continued its boycott of the games, which began in 1952 and lasted until 1980, over the participation of Taiwan.

Athletes representing 38 NOCs received at least one medal, and 25 NOCs won at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union won the most gold medals and the most overall medals, with 37 and 98 respectively. Iran and Bulgaria won their first Olympic gold medals. The Bahamas, Iceland, and Pakistan won their first Olympic medals.

Gymnast Ágnes Keleti of Hungary was the most successful competitor of the games, winning four gold medals and two silver medals for a total of six medals. Gymnast Larisa Latynina of the Soviet Union tied with Keleti for the most gold and overall medals for a competitor at the games, winning six medals with four gold medals, one silver medal, and one bronze medal.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won. The number of silver medals is considered next, followed by the number of bronze medals. Two bronze medals were awarded in each boxing event to the losing semi-finalists, instead of the competitors fighting in a third place tiebreaker.

In the gymnastics events, there were eight ties for medals. Two gold medals and no silver medal were awarded in the men&#x27;s vault and women&#x27;s floor exercise due to a first-place tie in both events. No bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s floor exercise and women&#x27;s balance beam due to a second-place tie in both events, with the former being a three-way tie and all second-place athletes awarded a silver medal. Two bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s parallel bars, men&#x27;s rings, women&#x27;s team portable apparatus, and women&#x27;s vault due to third-place ties in these events. In athletics, two silver medals and no bronze medals were awarded in the women&#x27;s high jump due to a second-place tie. Two bronze medals were awarded in the men&#x27;s 400 metres due to a third-place tie.

<text>Ove Wendelboe Sprogøe Petersen (21 December 1919 – 14 September 2004) was a Danish actor.

== Life ==
Born in Odense, his parents were Arthur and Inger Sprogøe Petersen. He married Eva Rasmussen in 1945, with whom he had three children. One of these is actor .

== Career ==
He made his film debut in &quot;Hans Store Aften&quot; (&quot;His Big Night&quot;). His characteristically prominent chin that had been feared to be an obstacle of his career did not prevent him from being one of the most versatile and widely used Danish actors. His strength laid in the almost diabolic, mischievous and brash but he effortlessly played meek and shy types as well as elegantiers. Among his many roles on stage in classic plays might be mentioned Mephisto in &quot;Faust&quot;, the title figure of Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;The Father&quot; and some Molière and Bertolt Brecht characters. An extremely popular actor in Denmark, he played many diverse roles, including several recurring television parts. He appeared in 157 films, making him one of the hardest-working actors in the history of Danish film. In his younger years he was often part of a duo with his friend and colleague Dirch Passer.

He is probably best known for playing one of the lead roles in the &quot;Olsen-banden&quot; movies, along with Morten Grunwald and Poul Bundgaard, playing the gang leader Egon Olsen, known for his short temper, striped suit, and cigar. By this role he earned international fame though mostly in Eastern Europe, in the GDR and Poland he together with his colleagues became almost a cult figure. Among his TV roles must be mentioned his elegant and humorous ex-burglar Larsen in the series &quot;Huset på Christianshavn&quot; (&quot;The House at Christianshavn&quot; – the first Danish sitcom) and his role as the wise and courageous doctor Louis Hansen in the epic, historical drama-series &quot;Matador&quot;, both also shown outside Denmark.

He was an able singer especially in shows or revues and his interpretation of Tim Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Cigarettes, whiskey and wild wild women&quot; (in Danish re-creation: &quot;Fandens Oldemor&quot; – &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Great-Grandmother&quot;) almost became his signature tune.

He was the Danish voice of the Sultan in the dub of Disney&#x27;s Aladdin, having previously voiced Jiminy Cricket, both in the Danish dub of Disney&#x27;s Pinocchio and in the nationally annually broadcast television special From All of Us to All of You.

He was an actor who combined great public sympathy with the ability to remain a private person with a modest lifestyle. After his death it was revealed that he had been a passionate art enthusiast and had amassed a valuable collection of modern paintings.

Shortly after his death in 2004, Nordisk Film (the company that made the Olsen Gang movies) established a scholarship for actors in his name. The state-owned road to The State Prison in Vridsløselille (the prison where his Egon Olsen character was a frequent &quot;guest&quot;), was renamed by the municipality of Albertslund to &quot;Egon Olsens Vej&quot; (Egon Olsen Road). On 24 October 2005, his native city of Odense named a square &quot;Ove Sprogøes Plads&quot; (Ove Sprogøe Square) in his honour.

<text>The 1952 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XV Olympiad and commonly known as Helsinki 1952, were an international multi-sport event held from 19 July to 3 August 1952 in Helsinki, Finland. A total of 4,955 athletes representing 69 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included 12 teams making their Olympic debut at the Summer Games: The Bahamas, Guatemala, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Israel, Netherlands Antilles, Nigeria, People&#x27;s Republic of China, Saar, the Soviet Union, Thailand, and Vietnam. The games featured 149 events across 17 sports in 23 disciplines, including the Olympic debut of women&#x27;s individual gymnastics events and the transition of equestrian sports becoming mixed. In addition, pesäpallo, a Finnish baseball variant, was played as a non-medal demonstration event.

China competed under the name of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) for the first time, although they only arrived in time to participate in one event. From 1924 to 1948, athletes from mainland China competed as the delegation of the Republic of China (ROC). As a result of the Chinese Civil War, a number of government and NOC representatives had fled to Taiwan and claimed to be the proper representative party of China. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted the ROC designation to the group in Taiwan and allowed both the PRC and ROC to compete with the name &quot;China&quot;, although the latter withdrew in protest.

Athletes representing 43 NOCs received at least one medal, with 27 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. The United States won the most gold medals, with 40, and the most overall medals, with 78. Bulgaria, Lebanon, the Soviet Union, and Venezuela won their first medals of any kind. Luxembourg, Romania, and the Soviet Union won their first gold medals. Among individual participants, Soviet gymnast Viktor Chukarin won the most gold medals, with four, while fellow Soviet gymnast Maria Gorokhovskaya won the most overall medals, with seven (two gold and five silver).

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In the men&#x27;s floor, men&#x27;s horizontal bar, and men&#x27;s pommel horse events there were two-way ties for second, which resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medals being awarded in each event. In the men&#x27;s rings and men&#x27;s vault events there were two-way ties for third, which resulted in an additional bronze medal being awarded in each event.

Events in boxing result in a bronze medal being awarded to each of the two competitors who lose their semi-final matches, as opposed to them fighting in a third place tie breaker.

<text>The National Museum (, officially the National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design) is a museum in Oslo, Norway which holds the Norwegian state&#x27;s public collection of art, architecture, and design objects. The collection totals over 400,000 works, amongst them the first copy of Edvard Munch&#x27;s &quot;The Scream&quot; from 1893. The museum is state-owned and managed by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture.

The National Museum was established in 2003 by the merging of the Museum of Architecture, The Museum of Industrial Art, the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design, the Museum of Contemporary Art, and the National Gallery of Norway. In 2022, the museum opened its new building at Vestbanehallen at the centre of Oslo, housing the entirety of the collections from these previous museums.

The current director of the museum is Karen Hindsbo.

==New building==
A new building to house the National Museum was constructed on Vestbanen in Oslo, and opened in June 2022.

The National Gallery was closed temporarily from 13 January 2019 until the new National Museum opened. The gallery served as storage for the collections until its move to the new National Museum.  

The Museum for Contemporary Art was last open on 3 September 2017. A large portion of the collection will be shown at the new National Museum. The contemporary art will for the first time ever be presented in a collection in partnership with design, crafts, and older art. This will be the biggest and most important exhibited collection in Norway.

Exhibits will be evaluated, photographed, and conserved before they are packed away and relocated to storage, and eventually to the new museum. This is extensive work and a large part of the preparations for the new National Museum  

The Art Industry Museum closed on 16 October 2016 due to preparations for the relocation into the new National Museum.

The New National Museum at Vestbanen

In the spring of 2008 the government decided that the new building for the National Museum would be located at Vestbanen in place of the old Oslo West Station train station at Aker Brygge. It was originally planned to open in 2020. In November 2010 the German architecture company Kleihues + Schuwerk won the international architecture competition with the project &quot;Forum Artis&quot;.  

A cohesive new building was one of the preconceptions for the establishment of the National Museum in 2003. Just ten years after Norway&#x27;s first public art museum was completed, the museum&#x27;s administration realized the National Gallery&#x27;s building was too small, other museum buildings were also in need of bigger more satisfactory premises. The same thing goes for all the exhibitions of the National Museum: Art Industry Museum, the Architecture Museum, and the Museum for Contemporary Art.

Architecture competitions for expansion at Tullinløkka were previously held in 1972 and 1995 but didn&#x27;t lead to anything.  

In spring 2012 the pre-project was completed and delivered to the culture department. The government presented the project on 22 March 2013 with a price of approximately 5.3 billion Norwegian kroner. On 6 June 2013 the Stortinget decreed the new building to be within a cost frame of 5,327 billion kroner.  

The new National Museum will have an exhibition area of 13,000 m2 and will be the largest art museum in the Nordic Countries.

The National Museum and Statbygg have together established the information centre Mellomstasjonen. Up until the museum opens you can get to know the building project and the plans for the new museum, as well as participate in breakfast meetings, artist&#x27;s discussions and many other things.

The building has been widely derided by critics, who have said it resembles a prison and described it as the &quot;national prison.&quot;

== Collections of the National Museum ==
===The National Gallery===
The National Gallery was established in 1842 as the Norwegian States Central Museum for Visual Arts. Since 1882 its location has been on Universitetsgata in Oslo, in a building designed by Heinrich Ernst and Adolf Schirmer. The building&#x27;s exterior and interior was listed by Riksantikvaren (Cultural Heritage) in January 2012.

Art historian Jens Thiis was director of The National Gallery between 1908 and 1941. Thiis was internationally oriented and purchased a number of key works for the museum&#x27;s collection. During this period, the museum also received large donations from industrial heirs Olaf Schou (1909), papal chamberlain and count Christopher Paus (1918), and Chr. Langaard (1922).

====Paus Collection====
Count Christopher Paus amassed one of the largest collections from classical antiquity in Northern Europe, known as the Paus collection. He donated his collection to the then-National Gallery from 1918 and was considered &quot;the founder of the National Gallery&#x27;s antiquities collection&quot; by art historian and National Antiquarian Harry Fett. 
Paus was an heir to one of Norway&#x27;s largest timber companies (Tostrup &amp; Mathiesen) as well as a relative of Henrik Ibsen, and the only Ibsen relative who ever visited Ibsen during his decades in exile. From the 1880s Paus lived in Rome, where he became a papal chamberlain and count, as well as an art collector. During that time, Rome was marked by significant expansion and extensive construction work, which unearthed many archaeological finds. At the same time, many artifacts ended up on the market because several Italian noble families who had collected them couldn&#x27;t handle the transition from feudalism to a modern society. It was also much easier to export antiquities from Italy during this period. Both Paus and other foreign art collectors, such as Carl Jacobsen, built large collections during this period and brought them back to their native countries. Paus turned down an offer from Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek to acquire the collection, instead donating it to the Norwegian government and the National Gallery where it was meant to become the foundation of a Norwegian museum or department dedicated to classical antiquity. The collection includes busts of the emperors Trajan, Galba, Lucius Verus, and (presumably) Commodus, the empress Julia Domna, a bust of Cleopatra&#x27;s grandson Ptolemy of Mauretania, and several busts of Roman women.

====National Gallery paintings collection====

The museum has a vast collection of Norwegian Romantic Nationalism movement paintings, as well as Edvard Munch&#x27;s works. The main part of the collection of older art consists of Norwegian paintings and sculptures from the 1800s.  

Edvard Munch&#x27;s Scream and some of his other renowned works are among the highlights of the National Gallery&#x27;s collection. Other significant artists include J.C Dahl, Adolph Tidemand, Hans Gude, Harriet Backer, and Christian Krohg. The collection from the 20th century shows the evolution within Norwegian visual arts with references and key works from Nordic and foreign art within paintings, sculpture, photos, video and other mediums.

In 1990 the museum&#x27;s collection from after 1945 was transferred to the newly established Museum of Contemporary Art.

The launch of a new basic exhibition &quot;Everyone is Talking About the Museum&quot; in 2005 increased visitor numbers but also had some negative reaction.

The most heavily debated decision was to divide the museum&#x27;s ‘Munch Room’ and show Munch&#x27;s works together with other contemporary painters. Another decision was to replace the chronological principle with a thematic one. The permanent exhibition was once again revisited in 2011. ‘The Dance of Life: Collections from the Ancients To 1950’, the Munch Room and the chronological principle has been reinstated. The new permanent exhibition has been praised as ‘a short version of the world’s art history instead of a revisit of the museum’s own collection’.

===Graphics and drawing collection===

The museum&#x27;s extensive graphic and drawing collection includes almost 50,000 Norwegian and foreign works, and spans from the end of the 1400s to current day. Central artists include Durer, Rembrandt, Van Gogh, Goya, Picasso, Manet, Rafael, Rubens, Muncb, Tidemand, Dahl, Werenskiold, and Kittelsen. Newer Norwegian graphics and drawn art is also well represented.

===Museum for Contemporary Art (1990–2017) ===

The Museum for Contemporary Art was established in 1988 and was located at Bankplassen 4 in Oslo. The collection consisted of works from the former National Exhibition and National Gallery, including later purchases. The 1907 museum building, designed by Ingvar Hjorth, formerly housed the Norwegian Bank. The museum opened for the public in 1990 and became a part of the National Museum in 2003.

The museum had alternating exhibitions in the 2000 m large2 facilities. In and outside the museum installations by the artists Per Inge Bjørlo, &quot;Inner Space VS. the Goal (1990)&quot; and the gallery room was dedicated to Louise Bourgeois. The collection consisted of over 5000 Norwegian and foreign works from the period of 1945 to the 21st century. Known Norwegian artists within the collection were Anna-Eva Bergman, Leonard Rickhard, Bjarne Melgaard, and Marianne Heske. Known international artists include Mario Merz, Cindy Sherman, Ilya Kabakov, and Isaac Julien. The collection was continually expanded with yearly purchases of art work.  

The Museum of Contemporary Art closed its doors in September 2017, and the contemporary art collection was moved to the new National Museum which opened in June 2022.

===National Museum – Architecture===

The Architecture Museum was established by the Norwegian Architects National Association in 1975 and became a part of the National Museum 1 July 2003. The building on Kongens Gate 4 was in use up until March 2005. The museum renamed the National Museum – Architecture, opened in 2008 at a new location, Bankplassen 3 in Oslo.

The museum is located in three separate buildings that are built together. The main building – the oldest section – was the Norges Banks Christianiaavdeling which was designed by Christian H. Grosch and was finished in 1830. Diagonally behind is Sverre Fehns addition from 2002 – the Ulltveit-Moe Pavilion. There is also a storage building from 1911, designed by Henry Bucher.

National Museum – Architecture shows alternating exhibits from the collection that consists of models, drawing, and photographs.  The National Museum has Norway&#x27;s most important architecture collection, featuring more than 300,000 items dated from the 1830s to current day. The collection highlights and documents different aspects of architectural culture and is mainly made up of private archives or fragments of archives. These span over a large variation of materials and mediums: architectural drawings, photographs, models, conceptual studies, sketchbooks, correspondences and ephemera. The collection&#x27;s main focus is the 1900s, and names within Norwegian architectural history such as Ove Bang, Blakstad of Munthe, Jan &amp; Jon, Knut Knutsen, Arne Korsmo, Christian Norberg-Schulz, Magnus Poulsson, and Erling Viksjø are well represented. Pritzker Prize winner Sverre Fehns is a highlights of the collection.

The Art Industry Museum is located at St. Olavs gate 1. The building was constructed in 1902 after Kristiania County decided, in 1896, to construct a new building at the then &quot;Brandt løkke&quot;, on the corner of Ullevålsveien and St. Olavs gate. In 1897 they had an architecture competition, and of the 14 proposals the 26-year old architect Adolf Brendo Greve was declared the winner. Due to his young age he asked the more experienced Ingvar Hjorth for assistance.

The museum itself was created by the initiative of professor Lorentz Dietrichson and antiquarian Nicolay Nicolaysen in 1876, and the museum was founded by the country that same year. That makes the museum amongst the first in Norway and one of the earliest art industry museums in Europe. This initiative was most likely based on the newly founded state of Norway&#x27;s need to show themselves as an independent and individual nation.
The collection of designs and handicrafts ranges from ancient Greek vases and East Asian artefacts to European style history. It includes costume, fashion and textiles, furniture, silver, glass, ceramics, design and crafts. The unique Baldishol rug from the 12th century, the royal costume collection, Nøstetangen glass, Norwegian silver and Herrebøe faience are among the highlights.

Due to preparations for moving to the new National Museum, the Museum of Art and Design closed on 16 October 2016. The collection will be part of the new National Museum, which opens in 2020.

===National exhibitions===

This was established in 1953 as a government agency under the culture department, to send travelling exhibitions of Norwegian and Nordic art to other parts of the country. The agency sent out 142 exhibitions in the 34 years it existed. The National Exhibition built up their own collections, as well as borrowed works for their exhibits. The main aim and motto is ‘Art to the People’.

When the Museum for Contemporary Art was established in 1988, the National Gallery became a part of the museum, from 1992 with the name ‘Riksutstillinger’(National Exhibitions).

The National Exhibitions The national exhibitions were a national art communication, whose task was to create interest and understanding of visual arts, crafts, photography, design and architecture. It was a national competence centre for dissemination, exhibition technique and design. National Exhibitions had five departments: administration, programme, dissemination, information, and department for exhibition design.  

From 1992 to 2005 it also had the function of organizing exhibitions outside the usual – such as large exhibitions from other continents (Saana Africa (Art from South-Africa), Fråvær (Absence), Vietnam Express, etc.). From 2005 the National Exhibition was disbanded, its dissemination responsibility transferred to Landsdekkende (Nationwide) Program, a part of the National Museum for Art, Architecture, and Design.

==Selected collection highlights==
== Conflicts ==
From the beginning, the National Museum was marked by conflicts, both on an administrative, artistic and political level. The first director of the National Museum was Swedish Sune Nordgren (until August 2006). Nordgren resigned as director after a long period of professional criticism and staff conflicts at the museum. On 1 August 2007, Allis Helleland took over as the new director. Under her leadership, the conflicts at the museum persisted, and Helleland was subjected to criticism both from employees at the museum and from the professional circles outside. She retired on 11 August 2008. The board appointed Ingar Pettersen as general manager. The museum&#x27;s chairman of the board since the beginning, Christian Bjelland, resigned his position later that autumn, and was replaced by Svein Aaser.
The director from 2009 till 2017 was Audun Eckhoff, who was succeeded by Karin Hindsbo.

== National Museum’s objectives ==
Purchases and gifts

Collection work, purchases and donations to the collection are important aspects of the museum&#x27;s community responsibilities. The museum builds and completes the collections mainly through current national and international organizations. There is a specific focus to gather important works with for a specific artist, period, group, or area of the collection within the collections policy.

Preservation

One of the museum&#x27;s most important tasks is making sure the art works within the collection are kept in as good a state as possible. Conservators treat, document, and research the museum&#x27;s collection of painting, paper, textiles, artwork and design, installations and electronic mediums. An important part of the conservator&#x27;s work is to investigate and document the condition of works in connection with loans, exhibitions or purchases.

Research and development

Research and development are part of the museum&#x27;s core tasks. This activity springs out of and is partly integrated in the museum&#x27;s artistic activities. The research must be of a high level and up to international standards. During 2010 the current research policies were reevaluated and a long-term plan of action was formed.

Published research

An important form of dissemination of research that takes place in the National Museum is publication. In addition to the yearbook Architecture in Norway and the magazine Kunst og Kultur , the National Museum publishes annual catalogs related to the exhibitions and the collections. The museum&#x27;s professionals are also contributors to many other different publications. Supplementary information about the individual publication can be found in databases available via the National Museum&#x27;s library and in the overview of publications published by the National Museum.

&quot;Kunst og kultur&quot; (Arts and Culture)

Norway&#x27;s only scientific journal within art history, &quot;Kunst og kultur&quot;, &quot;Art and Culture&quot; is published by the National Museum in collaboration with Universitetsforlaget (The University Press). The purpose of &quot;Kunst og kultur&quot; is to publish peer-reviewed articles within Norwegian and international art history and current book reviews. Its main subjects are art, crafts, design, and architecture from any period.  

National Museum&#x27;s research library

The museum&#x27;s research library includes approximately 165,000 books, exhibition catalogues, and encyclopedias within older and newer visual arts, crafts, design, architecture, and adjacent areas. The library has c. 200 journal titles, a video/DVD collection, and a collection of c. 28,000 slides. The library&#x27;s collection can be accessed at the library&#x27;s premises at Kristian Augusts gate 23.

Archive collections

The National Museum&#x27;s archive collections consist of extensive documentation and research material. The collections contain archives by public and private actors, as well as a broad documentation of Norwegian artists and the museum&#x27;s own art collections. The archives are available to anyone interested in the library&#x27;s reading room.

Media archive

The National Museum&#x27;s archive collections contain an extensive collection of newspaper clippings. The collection is based on a systematic collection of newspaper clippings mainly from the post-war period until today. Parts of the collection date back to the 19th century. The material can be used in the library&#x27;s reading room.

Digital commitment

The museum performs digitisation work of the collections, through the medium of DigitaltMuseum and Google Art Project, which can be accessed online. In the online collection you can search through 50,000 works and 7,000 artists, architects and designers.

Organisation

The National Museum is run by the foundation Nasjonalmuseet for kunst, arkitektur og design (National Museum of Art, Architecture and Design), which was created by the culture and church department of the government on 28 April 2003. The foundation is managed by a board with seven members, whereof three, including the leader, are chosen by the state. The board hires a daily manager for a fixed term and decides their work requirements and paycheck. The daily manager is in charge of the day-to-day work the foundation does in relation to guidelines given by the board.

<text>The keyed trumpet is a cylindrical-bore brass instrument in the trumpet family that makes use of tone holes operated by keys to alter pitch and provide a full chromatic scale, rather than extending the length of tubing with a slide or valves. It was developed from the natural trumpet in the 18th century and reached its high-point in popularity when two important trumpet concertos were written for it by Austrian composers Joseph Haydn and Johann Nepomuk Hummel, but waned with the invention of valves in the 1820s and the subsequent emergence of the modern valved trumpet. It is rarely seen in modern performances.

== History ==

The idea of applying keys to the natural trumpet, in order to extend its available notes beyond the harmonic series, was first documented by Leonardo da Vinci as a series of annotated diagrams in his notebooks written . Da Vinci describes a mechanism using a wire or thin rod to link finger-operated buttons to remote keys or pads, allowing tone holes to be in their acoustically correct positions without having to be covered directly by the fingertips. Like many of his ideas, it was not realised for centuries.

The invention of the keyed trumpet is often attributed to Viennese court trumpeter Anton Weidinger, its most successful and earliest proponent, who was certainly involved in its early development and built one of the first prototypes. However further research has revealed many conflicting records, accounts, and details of surviving instruments that attest to its simultaneous independent invention in several places within a short period, such that the very &quot;first&quot; inventor may never be known with certainty. The lack of surviving instruments from this early period further obscures its history.

The very first designs of keyed trumpet were intended to correct the intonation of the notes in the harmonic series, rather than to extend its capabilities to a full chromatic scale.
The &quot;harmonic trumpet&quot;, a silver trumpet in E♭ with crooks for D, C, and B♭ and four keys, was made by London instrument maker William Shaw for King George III in 1787. Eric Halfpenny found that each key corresponds to one of the four crooks and raises the pitch by a fifth, providing a fuller range of notes by allowing the player to switch between two harmonic series as required. This instrument not only predates Weidinger&#x27;s instrument, but may have been known to Austrian composer Joseph Haydn, who was making extended visits to London at the time. He composed his trumpet concerto in 1796, the year after his last visit, and early music trumpet specialist Crispian Steele-Perkins postulates that this instrument, via Haydn, may have inspired the further development of keyed trumpets in Vienna by Weidinger and others.

The keyed trumpet&#x27;s popularity peaked in the first decades of the 19th century, sustained by Weidinger and subsequent players throughout Europe. It unlocked the chromatic scale for trumpet players, increasing the versatility of the instrument and allowing its use in the orchestra as a featured, rather than background, instrument. Its popularity was relatively short-lived, remaining in frequent use until only the 1830s and 1840s, by which time the valved &quot;cornet à pistons&quot; was replacing it. This fate was shared by many other historical brass instruments that were replaced by their valved improvements, such as the serpent, early cimbasso, ophicleide, and keyed bugle.

== Construction ==

The keyed trumpet has raised tone holes in the wall of the tubing, similar in construction to the later ophicleide or saxophone. These are closed by keys with pads, operated by the fingers via a rod and lever mechanism, similar to those used on woodwind instruments. The experimental E keyed trumpet was not confined to the natural notes, but was chromatic in all registers of the instrument. Before this, the trumpet was commonly valveless and could only play the notes of the harmonic series by altering the lip tension and embouchure, a group of instruments referred to as natural or Baroque trumpets. These harmonic notes were clustered in the high registers, so previous trumpet concertos could only play melodies at very high pitches.

==Repertoire==

In 1796, Austrian composer Joseph Haydn wrote his Trumpet Concerto for Vienna court musician Anton Weidinger, who performed its première on 22 March 1800 at the Imperial and Royal Court Theatre. The piece begins with the broken triads and fanfare motifs common to trumpet music of the time (to amuse the audience who had come to see this exciting new kind of trumpet), but follows with chromatic runs and diatonic melodies not possible on the natural trumpet. This allows the concerto to be the first trumpet solo written in sonata-allegro form. The highest note in the concerto is high concert D, or high E on a B trumpet, or a high B on E trumpet for which it was written.

Like Haydn, Austrian composer Johann Nepomuk Hummel wrote his Trumpet Concerto for Anton Weidinger. It was written and performed in 1803 to mark his entrance into the Esterházy court orchestra in 1804, following Haydn. There are places, primarily in the second movement, where Weidinger is believed to have changed the music because of the execution of the instrument; it is unknown whether this was in agreement with Hummel.

=== Other works ===
Below is a list of pieces originally written to have keyed trumpet:

* Leopold Kozeluch - Concertante in E flat major for mandolin, keyed trumpet, double bass, pianoforte and orchestra - 1798 
* Joseph Weigl - Concerto in E flat for Corno Inglese, Flauto d’amore, Tromba, Viola d’amore, Cembalo and Violoncello - 1799
* Johann Nepomuk Hummel - Trio for pianoforte, violin and trumpet. (possibly the influence for Rondo from Hummel’s trumpet concerto) - 1802
* Antonio Casimir Cartellieri - Polonaise in A - 1815
* Sigismund Neukomm - Requiem (with keyed trumpet interludes) - 1815

==Performance==
Due to its physical characteristics—cylindrical bore, bell shape, and historical mouthpiece—the keyed trumpet is closer in tone to the natural trumpet than the valved trumpet. Nevertheless, the combination of wide-flared bell and cylindrical bore introduces inherent acoustical problems when using tone holes, especially compared its conical-bore equivalent the keyed bugle. It was once said to have sounded like a &quot;Demented Oboe... despite Haydn&#x27;s efforts, the keyed trumpet had no real success- the explanation may be that the holes detracted from the brilliant tone of the instrument.&quot; The keyed trumpet has a different, weaker tone on open-keyed notes, due to the inability of the bell to support the harmonics produced when shortening the cylindrical air column. This inferior tone quality is ultimately what allowed the keyed trumpet to be surpassed by the valved trumpet.

There are few people that play the keyed trumpet today, and it is generally used only in historically informed performances. Modern experts on the keyed trumpet include Markus Wuersch, Mark Bennett and Barry Bauguess. Given that there are few people who can play this specialized instrument, performances are rare and almost exclusively performances of the Haydn or Hummel concertos. The argument for using keyed trumpets in the modern day is that you get the distinct tone qualities of the instrument. Keyed trumpets have a rich, overtone filled sound due to them being double the length of the modern trumpet. Today, orchestral music is seeing a push to return to period instruments in order to preserve the compositions in the way the composer intended. This push is what has caused instrument makers like Konrad Burri to revisit and produce period instruments like the keyed trumpet in the modern day.

=== Recordings ===
Although performances using the keyed trumpet are rare, there are a few recordings that can be listened to:
* Mark Bennett, Haydn Trumpet Concerto with The English Concert (1990)
* Markus Würsch, Hummel Trumpet Concerto (2016)

<text>The 1948 Summer Olympics (also known as the Games of the XIV Olympiad) was an international multi-sport event held from July 29 through August 14, 1948, in London, United Kingdom. It was the first Olympic Games to take place in twelve years, due to the Second World War (and was known informally as &quot;The Austerity Games&quot; – largely due to countries having to bring their own food due to shortages in Britain), with London being chosen as the host city in May 1946.

London had previously hosted the 1908 Summer Olympics, and was due to have hosted the event in 1944. A record 59 nations were represented by 4,104 athletes, 3,714 men and 385 women, in 19 sport disciplines. Following the Second World War, Germany and Japan remained under military occupation and had not yet formed their National Olympic Committee, and so were not invited. The only major Axis power to take part in the Games was Italy. The Soviet Union was invited to compete, but chose not to send any athletes, sending observers instead to prepare for the 1952 Summer Olympics. Following the threats of a boycott from Arab countries should an Israeli team fly their flag at the opening ceremony, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) excluded Israel from the Games on a technicality.

Several countries participated for the first time, including Burma, Ceylon, Lebanon, Puerto Rico and Syria. The Olympic medals themselves were the standard &quot;Trionfo&quot; design used for the Olympic medals between 1928 and 1968.

It was not until 2010 that Belgian Eugène Van Roosbroeck received his gold medal for his part in the cycling road race as there was no podium for winners following the race and the team returned to Belgium two days after the event having received no medals.

==Medal table==
This is the full table of the medal count of the 1948 Summer Olympics, based on the medal count of the IOC. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a nation. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This information is provided by the IOC. However, the IOC does not recognize or endorse any ranking system.

In the gymnastics events there were three athletes placed first for the men&#x27;s pommel horse, with Paavo Aaltonen, Veikko Huhtanen and Heikki Savolainen all receiving gold medals for Finland in the same event, while no silver or bronze medals were handed out. Meanwhile, in the men&#x27;s vault, three athletes finished in joint third place and so were awarded a bronze medal each, resulting in five medals being handed out for that one event.

Mexico, Peru and won their first gold medal, and India won its first medal as an independent nation.

<text>Brian Kainoa Makoa McKnight Sr. (born Brian Kelly McKnight; June 5, 1969) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, record producer, radio personality, and multi-instrumentalist. An R&amp;B performer, he is recognized for his strong head voice, high belting range, and melisma.

His first hit song, &quot;Love Is&quot; (with Vanessa Williams) was recorded for the &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; soundtrack in 1993, and peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. That same year, his single &quot;One Last Cry&quot; peaked at number 13 on the chart and spawned from his eponymous debut studio album (1992), which was released by Mercury Records the year prior and received platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). His 1997 single, &quot;You Should Be Mine (Don&#x27;t Waste Your Time)&quot; (featuring Mase) peaked within the top 20 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and led his third album, &quot;Anytime&quot; (1997)—his final release with Mercury before he signed with Motown. His 1999 single, &quot;Back at One&quot; peaked at number two on the chart and remains his highest-charting song; it preceded the album of the same name (1999), which was the first of four of his albums—&quot;Superhero&quot; (2001), &quot;U Turn&quot; (2003), and &quot;Gemini&quot; (2005)—to consecutively debut within the top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. His ninth album, &quot;Ten&quot; (2006) marked his final major label release.

His work has earned him 16 Grammy Award nominations, third only to Zubin Mehta and Snoop Dogg for the record of most nominations for the award without a win.

== Early life ==
McKnight was born in Buffalo, New York to Claude McKnight, Jr. and Ruth Elaine Willis. His music experience began in childhood when he became a member of his church choir, which was directed by his grandfather. At the age of ten, McKnight and his family moved to Orlando, Florida, and began his musical ambitions in his early teens. He started composing instrumental material while learning to play several instruments. McKnight formed a band and began performing his original songs at local venues. By the age of 18, he was offered a publishing deal and subsequently moved to Los Angeles.

== Career ==
=== Mercury Records: &quot;Brian McKnight&quot; and &quot;Anytime&quot; (1990–1997) ===
McKnight&#x27;s older brother, Claude V. McKnight III (and his band Take 6), signed a record deal with Warner Brothers subsidiary Reprise Records in 1987, releasing their self-titled debut in the Spring of 1988. This encouraged McKnight to shop his own demo tapes, and by the age of 19 he signed his first recording deal with Mercury Records subsidiary, Wing Records. His self-titled debut album &quot;Brian McKnight&quot; was released in 1992, and peaked at number 58 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. His first release was &quot;The Way Love Goes&quot;, which peaked at number 11 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album also featured the ballad and Top 20 single, &quot;One Last Cry&quot;. It was followed by two more albums for Mercury, &quot;I Remember You&quot; (1995) and &quot;Anytime&quot; (1997). &quot;Anytime&quot;, McKnight&#x27;s final album with Mercury, sold over two million copies and was nominated for a Grammy. The video for &quot;Anytime&quot;, directed by Darren Grant, was nominated for Best Male Video at the 1998 MTV Video Music Awards. In 1997, McKnight recorded &quot;Remember the Magic&quot; for Walt Disney World&#x27;s 25th anniversary. After the release of his self-titled debut album, McKnight was part of the group Black Men United alongside Gerald Levert, his then-labelmate Joe, Christopher Williams, Boyz II Men, and others for the song &quot;U Will Know&quot;, featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Jason&#x27;s Lyric&quot;, released in late 1994, in which he produced it with D&#x27;Angelo.

=== Motown Records: &quot;Bethlehem&quot; and &quot;Back at One&quot; (1998–2004) ===
McKnight signed with Motown in 1998 and released a Christmas album, &quot;Bethlehem&quot;, the first of five albums he released on Motown.

In 1998, McKnight was a guest star on the show &quot;Sister Sister&quot;. He appeared in multiple episodes, as Tia and Tamera&#x27;s college professor.

In 1999, McKnight released &quot;Back at One&quot;, his most successful album to date, which eventually went on to sell over three million copies. Additionally, &quot;Back at One&quot; is one of four of McKnight&#x27;s studio albums to reach the Top 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 albums chart, reaching number 7 on October 9, 1999.

In 2004, McKnight co-wrote the song &quot;Wait&quot; with Australian soul artist Guy Sebastian, which appeared on Sebastian&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful Life&quot; album.

=== Warner Brothers: &quot;Ten&quot; and media/radio gigs (2005–2014) ===
In late 2005, McKnight signed with Warner Bros. Records and released the album &quot;Ten&quot; during December 2006. It was his only studio album with the label. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;Find Myself in You&quot; (which originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 2006 Tyler Perry movie &quot;Madea&#x27;s Family Reunion&quot;), &quot;Used to Be My Girl&quot; and &quot;What&#x27;s My Name&quot;.

In October 2007, McKnight made his Broadway debut in the show Chicago.

Between 2006 and 2010, McKnight hosted &quot;The Brian McKnight Morning Show&quot;, a radio show with Pat Prescott on KTWV The Wave in Los Angeles. The show was briefly simulcast on KHJZ-FM, Smooth Jazz 95.7 The Wave in Houston, Texas. In January 2009, McKnight hosted &quot;The Brian McKnight Show&quot; on 98.7 KISS FM in New York City.

In 2009, McKnight appeared in the eighth season of &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot;. Each celebrity played to raise money for the charity of his or her choice. McKnight elected to play for Youthville USA.

Between September 2009 and May 2010, McKnight served as the media personality and hosted &quot;The Brian McKnight Show&quot;, a late night talk show billed as a combination of talk and variety which aired in syndication.

McKnight sang the National Anthem for MLB Opening Day in Cincinnati, Ohio with his sons Brian, Jr. and Niko on March 31, 2011. He had previously sung the National Anthem for the 1997 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland, Game 6 of the 2002 World Series in Anaheim, California (near his Los Angeles home), and the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game in Detroit. He has also made numerous other &quot;National Anthem&quot; appearances throughout his career. Additionally, McKnight sang &quot;God Bless America&quot; in the 7th inning of Game 7 of the National League Champion Series in San Francisco on October 22, 2012.

On April 23, 2012, McKnight posted to YouTube &quot;If You&#x27;re Ready To Learn&quot;, which has been characterized by &quot;Billboard&quot; as a &quot;filthy jam&quot;. Billboard selected this lyric from the work to quote: &quot;Let me show you how your p—y works / Since you didn&#x27;t bring it to me first.&quot; Other media outlets such as MTV, the &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, and &quot;NewMediaRockstars&quot; have also written about McKnight&#x27;s recent, more adult-oriented efforts. Shortly after the single&#x27;s release, McKnight and Funny or Die revealed that the single was a collaboration between the two. McKnight later explained that he wrote the parody as a commentary on the state of R&amp;B, which he noted was in a period of degradation overall with famous radio station 98.7 Kiss FM shuttering and hit singles being inferior quality music, among other ailments.

=== Brian McKnight Music and Kobalt: &quot;Better&quot; (2015–2016) ===
On August 14, 2015, McKnight released the single &quot;Uh Oh Feeling&quot;, the first track from his album &quot;Better&quot;. It was released on his own label, Brian McKnight Music LLC via Kobalt Label Services. &quot;Better&quot; was released on February 26, 2016. The album received positive reviews.

=== SoNo Recording: &quot;An Evening with...&quot; and &quot;Genesis&quot; (2016–present) ===
On September 23, 2016 (twenty years from the date of his studio album &quot;Anytime&quot;), McKnight released his first live CD, DVD and Blu-ray collection entitled &quot;An Evening with Brian McKnight&quot; (in partnership with independent recording label, SoNo Recording Group, via the Universal Music Group). The concert was recorded in Los Angeles, at the historic Saban Theatre. The release includes fourteen songs performed live with his full band, plus three newly written and recorded songs. The first single, &quot;Everything&quot;, reached the Top 20 on the national Adult Contemporary charts in September 2016. The CD version of the concert debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart at number 13, as a Hot Shot Debut. Also included, is a duet with Gino Vannelli, on the song &quot;Brothers in the End&quot;. The Blu-ray and DVD version of the release premiered on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Music DVD chart at number 9.

McKnight released the album &quot;Genesis&quot; on August 25, 2017. It featured three Top 30 Urban AC and AC hits: &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot; and &quot;I Want U&quot;. &quot;Genesis&quot; premiered on the Nielsen SoundScan Top 10 Current R&amp;B Albums and Top 20 Current Hip Hop/R&amp;B Albums. The album was produced by Tim Kelley, part of the legendary duo Tim &amp; Bob.

In January 2018, McKnight was nominated for two NAACP Image Awards. He was nominated for Outstanding Male Artist and Outstanding Album for &quot;Genesis&quot; (alongside Bruno Mars, Charlie Wilson, Kendrick Lamar, Jay-Z and Mary J Blige).

In May 2018, McKnight announced he was working on his next studio album tentatively titled &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, which would be 60 minutes of music &quot;for the bedroom aka baby-making music&quot;.

In 2014, he began dating Dr. Leilani Malia Mendoza, a pediatric neurophysiologist, and they announced their engagement in May 2017. On December 29, 2017, McKnight and Mendoza were married.

Being the youngest of four boys, McKnight became a member of an a cappella gospel quartet with his brothers. He also attended Oakwood College, a Seventh-day Adventist university in Huntsville, Alabama, from 1987 to 1989.

<text>The 1936 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Berlin, Germany, from 1 August to 16 August. 

Berlin had previously been chosen to host the 1916 Summer Olympics, which were subsequently cancelled due to the First World War. The 1936 Games had 3,963 athletes from 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participating in a total of 129 events in 19 sports. This was the highest number of nations represented at any Games to date. Athletes from 32 NOCs won medals, of which 21 secured at least one gold medal. As a result, 17 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, Germany, received a total of 101 medals (38 of them gold), the most of any nation and a record for a united German team, although East Germany broke that record in 1976, 1980 and 1988.

A boycott by the United States was suggested due to Germany&#x27;s National Socialist regime, but it was not implemented. The other NOCs which threatened to boycott the Games for the same reason were the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and the Netherlands. An alternative People&#x27;s Olympiad was planned to take place in Barcelona, Spain, but was cancelled at the last moment following the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War after the athletes had already begun to arrive. The civil war also meant that Spain&#x27;s NOC did not compete at the 1936 Games. While no NOCs ended up boycotting the Games on anti-Nazi grounds, a multinational Jewish-led boycott of the Games took place, with individual athletes refusing to take part. Also, the IAAFs&#x27; refusal to allow athletes from Northern Ireland to compete for the Irish Olympic Council in athletics events led the Irish Free State to boycott.

Marjorie Gestring became the youngest Olympic champion ever at the age of 13, winning a gold medal in the women&#x27;s 3 meter springboard. As Korea was under Japanese rule, Korean athletes who hoped to compete in the Games were required to qualify for the Japanese team. Sohn Kee-chung, competing as Kitei Son, won gold in the marathon, which made him Japan&#x27;s first gold medalist at these Games and the first Korean ever to win a medal. His fellow countryman Nam Sung-yong won the bronze medal in the same event.

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where &#x27;nation&#x27; is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

A dead heat in the lightweight section of the weightlifting competition resulted in gold medals being awarded to both Austria&#x27;s Robert Fein and Egypt&#x27;s Anwar Mesbah, and resulted in a silver medal not being awarded for that event. A dead heat for third place in the floor competition of the gymnastic events resulted in bronze medals going to both Germany&#x27;s Konrad Frey and Eugen Mack of Switzerland. This resulted in 130 gold and bronze medals being awarded, but only 128 silver medals.

For the 109 sports events a total of 327 medals were awarded: 110 gold medals, 108 silver medals, and 109 bronze medals. These numbers are unequal, because two gold medals and no silver medals were awarded in the lightweight category of weightlifting, after a first-place tie in the event. The athletes of 33 countries won one or more medals. The most medals (56) and the most gold medals (22) were won by athletes from the United States.

The countries are ranked by the number of gold medals won by the athletes of that country. If countries are tied, first the number of silver medals is taken into consideration and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

As they attempt to help the Pharaoh regain his memories, they are put to the test, wagering their lives facing off against others who wield the mysterious Millennium Items and the dark power of the Shadow Games.

Most human characters in the English version of the original manga, published by VIZ Media, use their original Japanese names, while in other English &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; media their names are changed. The Japanese names in Western order (given name before family name) and English manga names are listed first and the English anime names are listed second, when applicable. As well, the 4Kids English dub censors or edits instances of violence and sexual content, with characters being sent to the Shadow Realm rather than dying and some designs being changed.

Jonouchi is touched by Yugi&#x27;s behavior and they become close friends, forming his own &quot;treasure.&quot;

Though skilled at fistfighting and usually able to take on those bigger than himself, such as Bandit Keith, a fight which he loses in the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime, he handicaps himself against opponents such as Bruce Ryu.

He plays a key role in the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime, where, as the creator of Duel Monsters and the discoverer of their ancient Egyptian roots, he possesses knowledge of the game and its origins.

After breaking one of the clan&#x27;s laws, his dark personality emerged and murdered his father. However, his adoptive older brother Rishid sealed his dark side away, leaving him with no memory of his actions and believing the Pharaoh to be responsible for his father&#x27;s death.

Dark Marik enjoys violence and the suffering of others and only cares for his own survival, attempting to kill Marik to have sole possession of their body. While he is connected to the Millennium Rod, he differs from Dark Yugi and Dark Bakura in that he exists independently from Marik.

After seeing that Seto flourished after he abandoned him, he aimed to see him achieve power. Through Zorc&#x27;s influence within the Millennium Eye, which is awoken after Thief King Bakura puts part of his soul in it, he becomes convinced that he must kill the Pharaoh and makes a contract with Zorc to become the .

In the manga, Akhenaden&#x27;s soul merged with Zorc after they were sealed in the Millennium Puzzle along with Atem before being released during the final arc. His mummy is used as a second player on Dark Bakura&#x27;s side of the Shadow RPG, influencing his own playing piece as part of the game&#x27;s recreation of the events before his soul is vanquished after Atem wins the game. In the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime, his mind is corrupted after Dark Bakura puts part of his soul in the Millennium Eye and he is granted power from Zorc after gathering the Millennium Items, transforming into the High Priest of Darkness.

Insistent on disciplining him, Mr. Karita tells him that the school&#x27;s rules state that boys with long hair is against the rules, and orders him that he must shave his hair if he wants to be treated as a student. Dark Bakura later defeats him and puts his soul in a game piece.
: 
: The former Japanese champion of Duel Monsters, who is known for his deck of insect-type monsters and insect-related magic and trap cards. He is not above cheating to ensure his strategies work, as he befriends Yugi only to throw his Exodia cards into the ocean and puts a Paracitic Insect card in Jonouchi&#x27;s deck to ensure that his Insect Barrier would work. He and Ryuzaki later attempt to get the Egyptian God Cards.
: 
: The runner-up of the Japanese Duel Monsters tournament, whose nickname is derived from his fondness for dinosaur-themed cards. He is defeated by Jonouchi in the Duelist Kingdom tournament and has his Red-Eyes Black Dragon, a card that would become a trademark for Jonouchi, taken as a result of a gamble. He reappears during the Battle City arc, where he is defeated by Espa Roba and warns Jonouchi not to duel him. He and Ryuzaki later attempt to get the Egyptian God Cards.
: 
: An ocean-themed duelist who appears in the Duelist Kingdom and Battle City arcs. He is introduced in the Duelist Kingdom arc, where he duels Dark Yugi and is defeated. In the Battle City arc, he duels Jonouchi and it is revealed that his father was a fisherman who died out at sea. In the manga and the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime, he instead duels to honor his father&#x27;s memory, and in the English dub he duels to raise money to fund a trip to search for his father. After Jonouchi defeats Ryota in their duel, he gives him two of his cards &quot;Floating Whale Fortress&quot; and &quot;The Legendary Fisherman&quot;, the latter resembling his deceased father.
: 
: Known as Bandit Keith by his enemies, he is an American &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; champion and a &quot;Card Professor&quot; who seeks big prizes at tournaments. He first appears in the Duelist Kingdom arc. Flashbacks reveal that he was once the champion of &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; in America until he dueled Pegasus at the American Championship tournament and lost. This was done when Pegasus wrote something on a piece of paper and called a boy named Sam from the audience. When Bandit Keith played the monster &quot;Garnecia Elefantis&quot;, Sam followed the information written on the paper and played &quot;Flying Elephant&quot; in attack mode, which took out Bandit Keith&#x27;s remaining lifepoints. This match led Kaiba to learn of Pegasus&#x27; ability to read minds. After he cheats in his duel against Jonouchi in the Duelist Kingdom semi-finals, Pegasus inflicts the &quot;Hand and Gun&quot; Penalty Game on him, turning his hand into a gun and forcing him to play Russian Roulette, effectively killing him. In the anime, Pegasus instead sends him through a trap door into the ocean. He survives and is rescued by Marik, who controls his mind and uses him in an attempt to defeat Yugi and take the Millennium Puzzle, but flees after accidentally starting a fire.
: 
: A contestant in Duelist Kingdom who worked for Bandit Keith, who gave him cards to enhance his zombie deck and duel Jonouchi in Duelist Kingdom&#x27;s caverns, which house the corpses of World War II troops. Thanks to Keith&#x27;s strategy, Kozuka plays &quot;Call of the Haunted&quot;, which brings back &quot;Zanki&quot;, &quot;Crawling Dragon&quot;, and Crass Clown&quot; as zombie monsters &quot;Armored Zombie&quot;, &quot;Dragon Zombie&quot;, and &quot;Clown Zombie&quot;. He also summons &quot;Pumpking the King of Ghosts&quot; to strengthen the zombie monsters with ectoplasm until it is destroyed by &quot;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&quot;. Kozuka loses to Jonouchi after he plays a combination of &quot;Battle Warrior&quot; and &quot;Shield and Sword&quot; to switch the ATK points and DEF points of the monsters on the field, leaving the zombie monsters with no ATK points. After sealing Yugi and his friends in a cave, Bandit Keith steals his Star Chips and he is presumably sent off the island. He returns during the Battle City arc, but is defeated and presumably killed by Dark Bakura in a Shadow Game; in the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime&quot;,&quot; he is presumably sent to Hell by Dark Bakura. However, he is later rescued following his defeat in Battle City, along with everyone else who was sent there.
: 
: A dancer who challenges Anzu to a game of during her &quot;date&quot; with Dark Yugi, with her having to go on a date with him if she loses. In the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime, he insists on going on a date with him after the encounter in the arcade, later facing Dark Yugi in a Duel Monsters duel. After his &quot;Heavy Metal King&quot; is destroyed, he forfeits after learning who Yugi is.
: 
: One of the contestants participating in Battle City, who claims to have ESP. In reality, he uses his younger brothers to spy on and report to him the cards in his opponent&#x27;s hand, allowing him to &#x27;predict&#x27; the opponent&#x27;s strategies before they use them. He did this to give off the impression of being an unbeatable duelist and deflect the abuse they receive, as they were bullied due to previously working at a carnival. Junouchi faces off against him after he defeats Dinosaur Ryuzaki and claimed his &quot;Serpent Night Dragon&quot;, receiving his best card, , after defeating him.
: One of two men hired to help Sugoroku through the Pharaoh&#x27;s tomb, the Shrine of the Shadow Games, in the early 1960s. In the tomb were multiple statues armed with swords on a catwalk. To cross, a person needed to walk across left footed, as if they ran on both legs, the statues would kill them; however, the brothers were right footed. Ahmet managed to make it to it safety, while his brother fell to his death, which he blamed Sugoroku for. Though they reached the Millennium Puzzle, only those of courageous hearts could pass; because he had the heart of a coward, a monster appeared and devoured him as a Penalty Game.
: One of two men hired to help Sugoroku through the Pharaoh&#x27;s tomb, the Shrine of the Shadow Games, in the early 1960s. While trying to make it through one of the tomb&#x27;s traps, Mushara fell to his death, which Ahmet blamed Sugoroku for.
: 
: A character who appears in the 1999 movie as one of the main protagonists. He is a boy who did not play games with his friends because he was afraid of losing, and was regularly bullied by a group of three boys. After opening a card pack containing the rare &quot;Red-Eyes Black Dragon&quot; card, he uses it to intimidate people so they will not duel him.
: 
: A character who appears in the &quot;Duel Monsters&quot; anime&quot;.&quot; He is Rebecca Hawkins&#x27;s grandfather.
: 
: A character created for the KC Grand Champion filler arc of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot;. He is Siegfried von Schroeder&#x27;s younger brother. While Siegfried ran Schroeder Corporation, Leonhart took up playing Duel Monsters and dueled in several tournaments under the alias to get away from his family. His monster cards, magic cards, and trap cards are based on different fairy tales and were created for him after he wrote a letter to Pegasus, including &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, and &quot;Iron Hans&quot;. During the KC Grand Prix, Leon defeats the duelists Dr. Richard Goat, Ethan Shark, and Rebecca Hawkins. However, after he duels Yugi when Ziegfried is disqualified upon losing to Kaiba, his identity is discovered by one of Kaiba&#x27;s workers after Ziegfried has him play an illegal card called &quot;Golden Castle of Stromberg&quot;, which releases a computer virus into Kaiba Corporation. As Leon is unable to remove the card with &quot;Mystic Space Typhoon&quot;, since it will only be removed if Yugi discards ten cards from the deck due to Ziegfried&#x27;s hacking, he has no choice but to continue the duel. When Yugi does not have the required number of cards left, the &quot;Golden Castle of Stromberg&quot; is destroyed and he uses a combination of &quot;Necromancy&quot;, &quot;Diffusion Wave Motion&quot;, and &quot;Dark Magician to defeat Leon while Kaiba disposes of the computer virus.

<doc id="921240" wikidata="Q1396049" url="?curid=921240" title="Snake River Plain">
<text>The Snake River Plain is a geologic feature located primarily within the U.S. state of Idaho. It stretches about westward from northwest of the state of Wyoming to the Idaho-Oregon border. The plain is a wide, flat bow-shaped depression and covers about a quarter of Idaho. Three major volcanic buttes dot the plain east of Arco, the largest being Big Southern Butte.

Most of Idaho&#x27;s major cities are in the Snake River Plain, as is much of its agricultural land.

==Geology==

The Snake River Plain can be divided into three sections: western, central, and eastern. The western Snake River Plain is a large tectonic graben or rift valley filled with several kilometers of lacustrine (lake) sediments; the sediments are underlain by rhyolite and basalt, and overlain by basalt. The western plain began to form around 11–12 Ma (million years ago) with the eruption of rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites. The western plain is not parallel to North American Plate motion and lies at a high angle to the central and eastern Snake River Plains. Its morphology is similar to other volcanic plateaus such as the Chilcotin Group in south-central British Columbia, Canada.

The eastern Snake River Plain traces the path of the North American Plate over the Yellowstone hotspot, now centered in Yellowstone National Park. The eastern plain is a topographic depression that cuts across Basin and Range mountain structures, more or less parallel to North American Plate motion. It is underlain almost entirely by basalt erupted from large shield volcanoes. Beneath the basalts are rhyolite lavas and ignimbrites that erupted as the lithosphere passed over the hotspot.

The central Snake River plain is similar to the eastern plain but differs by having thick sections of interbedded lacustrine (lake) and fluvial (stream) sediments, including the Hagerman fossil beds.

Island Park and Yellowstone Calderas formed as the result of enormous rhyolite ignimbrite eruptions, with single eruptions producing up to of ash. Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera, measuring by , may be the largest symmetrical caldera in the world. The caldera formed when a dome of magma built up and then drained away. The center of the dome collapsed, leaving a caldera. Henry&#x27;s Fork Caldera lies within the older and larger Island Park Caldera, which is by . Younger volcanoes that erupted after passing over the hotspot covered the plain with young basalt lava flows in places, including Craters of the Moon National Monument.

==Effects on climate==

The Snake River Plain has a significant effect on the climate of Yellowstone National Park and the adjacent areas to the south and west of Yellowstone. Over time, the Yellowstone hotspot left a wide channel through the Rocky Mountains. This channel is in line with the gap between the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada. The result is a moisture channel extending from the Pacific Ocean to Yellowstone. Moisture from the Pacific Ocean streams onshore in the form of clouds and humid air. It passes through the gap between the Sierra and Cascades and into the Snake River Plain where it is channeled through most of the Rocky Mountains with no high plateaus or mountain ranges to impede its progress. It finally encounters upslope conditions at the head of the Snake River Valley at Ashton, Idaho; at Island Park, Idaho; at the Teton Range east of Driggs, Idaho; and at the Yellowstone Plateau of Yellowstone National Park where the channeled moisture precipitates out as rain and snow. The result is a localized climate on the eastern side of the Rockies that is akin to a climate on the west slope of the Cascades or the northern Sierra. The head of the Snake River Valley, the Tetons, and the Yellowstone Plateau receive much more precipitation than other areas of the region, and the area is known for being wet, green, having many streams, and having abundant snow in winter.

Although the topography of the Plain has largely gone unchanged for several million years, this region&#x27;s climate has not been so constant. Current climatic conditions began to characterize the region in the early Pleistocene (approximately 2.5 million years ago). However, the arid climate of today was born from the gradual dissipation of a climate defined by greater moisture and narrower ranges of annual temperatures.

<doc id="921242" wikidata="Q1378723" url="?curid=921242" title="Eustache Le Sueur">
<text>Eustache Le Sueur or Lesueur (; 19 November 161730 April 1655) was a French artist and one of the founders of the French Academy of Painting. He is known primarily for his paintings of religious subjects. He was a leading exponent of the neoclassical style of Parisian Atticism.

==Training and career==
He was born in Paris, where he spent his entire life. His father, Cathelin Le Sueur, a turner and sculptor in wood, placed him with Vouet, in whose studio he rapidly distinguished himself.

Admitted at an early age into the guild of master-painters, he left them to take part in establishing the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture in 1648 and was elected as one of the original twelve elders in charge of its administration.
Some paintings, illustrative of the &quot;Hypnerotomachia Poliphili&quot;, which were reproduced in tapestry, brought him notice, and his reputation was further enhanced by a series of decorations (Louvre) in the mansion of Lambert de Thorigny, which he left uncompleted, for their execution was frequently interrupted by other commissions. Amongst these were several pictures for the apartments of the king and queen in the Louvre, which are now missing, although they were entered in Bailly&#x27;s inventory (1710); but several works produced for minor patrons have come down to us.

In the gallery of the Louvre are the &quot;Angel and Hagar&quot;, from the mansion of De Tonnay Charente; &quot;Tobias and Tobit&quot;, from the Fieubet collection; several pictures executed for the church of Saint Gervais; the &quot;Martyrdom of St Lawrence&quot;, from Saint Germain de l&#x27;Auxerrois; two very fine works from the destroyed abbey of Marmoutiers; &quot;St Paul preaching at Ephesus&quot;, one of Le Sueur&#x27;s most complete and thorough performances, painted for the goldsmiths corporation in 1649; and his famous series of the &quot;Life of St Bruno&quot;, executed in the cloister of the Chartreux. These last have more personal character than anything else Le Sueur produced, and much of their original beauty survives in spite of injuries and restorations and removal from the wall to canvas. Le Sueur was a prolific draftsman and many of his chalk drawings are in the Louvre&#x27;s Cabinet des Dessins.

His pupils, who aided him much in his work, were his wife&#x27;s brother, Theodore Goussé, and three brothers of his own, as well as Claude Lefèbvre and Pierre Patel the landscape painter. Most of his works have been engraved, chiefly by Picart, B. Audran, Leclerc, Drevet, Chauveau, Poilly and Desplaces.

==Style==
According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, it was considered that Le Sueur&#x27;s work lent itself readily to the engraver&#x27;s art, as he had a delicate perception of varied shades of grave and elevated sentiment, and possessed the power to render them. His graceful facility in composition was always restrained by a very fine taste, but his works often fail to please completely, because, producing so much, he had too frequent recourse to conventional types, and partly because he rarely saw colour except with the cold and clayey quality proper to the school of Vouet; yet his &quot;St Paul at Ephesus&quot; and one or two other works show that he was not naturally deficient in this sense, and whenever we get direct reference to nature—as in the monks of the St Bruno series—we recognize his admirable power to read and render physiognomy of varied and serious type.

<text>The 1924 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the VIII Olympiad, was an international multi-sport event held in Paris, France, from 4 May to 27 July. A total of 3,089 athletes from 44 nations participated in 126 events in 17 sports across 23 different disciplines.

Overall, athletes from 27 nations received at least one medal, and 19 of them won at least one gold medal. Athletes from the United States won the most medals overall, with 99, and the most gold medals, with 45. Athletes from Finland came second in the medal table with 14 gold medals and 37 overall medals, while athletes from host nation France came third with 13 gold medals and 38 medals overall. Czechoslovakia&#x27;s team won their nation&#x27;s first Olympic gold medal. Teams from Argentina, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia won their nations&#x27; first Olympic gold medal and Olympic medal of any color. Meanwhile, teams from Haiti, Poland, Portugal, and Romania won their nations&#x27; first Olympic medals.

Middle-distance and long-distance runner Paavo Nurmi of Finland won the most gold medals for an individual at the Games and the most gold medals in athletics at a single Games, with five gold medals. Compatriot long-distance runner Ville Ritola won the most overall medals and the most medals in athletics at a single Games, winning six medals with four golds and two silvers.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals.

In gymnastics, two silver medals (and no bronze) were awarded to Jean Gounot and François Gangloff for a second-place tie in the men&#x27;s sidehorse vault event, while two bronze medals were awarded to Ladislav Vácha and August Güttinger for a third-place tie in the men&#x27;s rope climbing event. In rowing, no bronze medal was awarded in the men&#x27;s coxless pair event, as there were only two teams that participated in the final after Gordon Killick and Thomas Southgate of Great Britain got injured and did not start.


===Art competitions===

The 1924 Summer Olympics also included art competitions across five disciplines: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture, for works inspired by sport-related themes, were medal-eligible events at the time. Art competitions were held from the 1912 Summer Olympics until the 1948 Summer Olympics, but were discontinued over the amateurism controversy. Medals in art competitions are no longer recognized by the IOC as part of the total medal count.

In architecture, no gold medal was awarded while the silver was awarded to the pair of Alfréd Hajós and Dezső Lauber of Hungary. Hajós became one of only two Olympians ever to have won medals in both sport (two golds in swimming at the 1896 Summer Olympics) and art Olympic competitions. The bronze was awarded to Julien Médecin of Monaco, who became the first Monégasque competitor to win an Olympic medal.

In literature, one gold, which was awarded to Géo-Charles of France, two silvers to Josef Petersen of Denmark and Margaret Stuart of Great Britain, and two bronzes to Charles Gonnet of France and Oliver Gogarty of Ireland, were awarded. Two compositions, entitled &quot;The Land Where the Rose is Grown&quot; and &quot;O Vigila (now let the games begin)&quot;, that were part of the literature competition, were also part of the music competitions. The compositions were made by George Bamber of Great Britain, though no medals were awarded in the music competition as the jury could not reach a consensus to award medals for any of the competitors.

In painting, Jean Jacoby of Luxembourg won the gold medal, becoming the first Luxembourgish competitor to win an Olympic gold medal, Jack Butler Yeats of Ireland won the silver, becoming the first Irish competitor to win an Olympic medal, and Johan van Hell of the Netherlands won the bronze.

In sculpture, Konstantinos Dimitriadis of Greece won the gold medal, Frantz Heldenstein of Luxembourg won the silver, and two bronze medals were awarded, one to Jean René Gauguin of Denmark and the other to Claude-Léon Mascaux of France.

<text>This is a list of molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium and circumstellar envelopes, grouped by the number of component atoms. The chemical formula is listed for each detected compound, along with any ionized form that has also been observed.

==Background==

The molecules listed below were detected through astronomical spectroscopy. Their spectral features arise because molecules either absorb or emit a photon of light when they transition between two molecular energy levels. The energy (and thus the wavelength) of the photon matches the energy difference between the levels involved. Molecular electronic transitions occur when one of the molecule&#x27;s electrons moves between molecular orbitals, producing a spectral line in the ultraviolet, optical or near-infrared parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. Alternatively, a vibrational transition transfers quanta of energy to (or from) vibrations of molecular bonds, producing signatures in the mid- or far-infrared. Gas-phase molecules also have quantised rotational levels, leading to transitions at microwave or radio wavelengths.

Sometimes a transition can involve more than one of these types of energy level e.g. ro-vibrational spectroscopy changes both the rotational and vibrational energy level. Occasionally all three occur together, as in the Phillips band of C2 (diatomic carbon), in which an electronic transition produces a line in the near-infrared, which is then split into several vibronic bands by a simultaneous change in vibrational level, which in turn are split again into rotational branches.

The spectrum of a particular molecule is governed by the selection rules of quantum chemistry and by its molecular symmetry. Some molecules have simple spectra which are easy to identify, whilst others (even some small molecules) have extremely complex spectra with flux spread among many different lines, making them far harder to detect. Interactions between the atomic nuclei and the electrons sometimes cause further hyperfine structure of the spectral lines. If the molecule exists in multiple isotopologues (versions containing different atomic isotopes), the spectrum is further complicated by isotope shifts.

Detection of a new interstellar or circumstellar molecule requires identifying a suitable astronomical object where it is likely to be present, then observing it with a telescope equipped with a spectrograph working at the required wavelength, spectral resolution and sensitivity. The first molecule detected in the interstellar medium was the methylidyne radical (CH•) in 1937, through its strong electronic transition at 4300 angstroms (in the optical). Advances in astronomical instrumentation have led to increasing numbers of new detections. From the 1950s onwards, radio astronomy began to dominate new detections, with sub-mm astronomy also becoming important from the 1990s.

The inventory of detected molecules is highly biased towards certain types which are easier to detect. For example, radio astronomy is most sensitive to small linear molecules with a high molecular dipole. The most common molecule in the Universe, H2 (molecular hydrogen), is completely invisible to radio telescopes because it has no dipole; its electronic transitions are too energetic for optical telescopes, so detection of H2 required ultraviolet observations with a sounding rocket. Vibrational lines are often not specific to an individual molecule, allowing only the general class to be identified. For example, the vibrational lines of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified in 1984, showing the class of molecules is very common in space, but it took until 2021 to identify any specific PAHs through their rotational lines.
One of the richest sources for detecting interstellar molecules is Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), a giant molecular cloud near the centre of the Milky Way. About half of the molecules listed below were first found in Sgr B2, and many of the others have been subsequently detected there. A rich source of circumstellar molecules is CW Leonis (also known as IRC +10216), a nearby carbon star, where about 50 molecules have been identified. There is no clear boundary between interstellar and circumstellar media, so both are included in the tables below.

The discipline of astrochemistry includes understanding how these molecules form and explaining their abundances. The extremely low density of the interstellar medium is not conducive to the formation of molecules, making conventional gas-phase reactions between neutral species (atoms or molecules) inefficient. Many regions also have very low temperatures (typically 10 kelvin inside a molecular cloud), further reducing the reaction rates, or high ultraviolet radiation fields, which destroy molecules through photochemistry. Explaining the observed abundances of interstellar molecules requires calculating the balance between formation and destruction rates using gas-phase ion chemistry (often driven by cosmic rays), surface chemistry on cosmic dust, radiative transfer including interstellar extinction, and sophisticated reaction networks. The use of molecular lines to determine the physical properties of astronomical objects is known as molecular astrophysics.
==Molecules==
The following tables list molecules that have been detected in the interstellar medium or circumstellar matter, grouped by the number of component atoms. Neutral molecules and their molecular ions are listed in separate columns; if there is no entry in the molecule column, only the ionized form has been detected. Designations (names of molecules) are those used in the scientific literature describing the detection; if none was given that field is left empty. Mass is listed in atomic mass units. Deuterated molecules, which contain at least one deuterium (2H) atom, have slightly different masses and are listed in a separate table. The total number of unique species, including distinct ionization states, is indicated in each section header.

Most of the molecules detected so far are organic. The only detected inorganic molecule with five or more atoms is SiH4. Molecules larger than that all have at least one carbon atom, with no N−N or O−O bonds.

===Diatomic (43)===

===Triatomic (44)===

===Four atoms (30)===

===Five atoms (20)===


===Six atoms (16)===

===Seven atoms (13)===

===Eight atoms (14)===

===Nine atoms (10)===

===Ten or more atoms (23)===

==Deuterated molecules (22)==
These molecules all contain one or more deuterium atoms, a heavier isotope of hydrogen.

==Unconfirmed (15)==
Evidence for the existence of the following molecules has been reported in the scientific literature, but the detections either are described as tentative by the authors, or have been challenged by other researchers. They await independent confirmation.

<text>The 1920 Summer Olympics, now officially known as the Games of the VII Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Antwerp, Belgium, from August 14 to September 12, 1920. A total of 2,622 athletes representing 29 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 162 events in 29 disciplines. Willis Lee won five gold medals and 7 total medals at the 1920 Summer Olympics, the most of any competing athlete.

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<text>The River Eamont is a river in Cumbria, England and one of the major tributaries of the River Eden. The name of the river is from Old English (ēa-gemōt) and is a back formation from Eamont Bridge which means the &quot;junction of streams.&quot;

The river is formed by the outflow from Ullswater in the Lake District, later augmented by Dacre Beck from the west and the River Lowther which carries the water from Haweswater north to the Eamont at Penrith. It reaches the Eden east of Penrith.

The river has flooded on numerous occasions; the most recent was when Storm Desmond hit in December 2015. During the flooding, 300-year old Pooley Bridge was washed away and a temporary bridge had to be installed to reconnect the two halves of the village. The same storm damaged the grade I listed Eamont Bridge, but after masonry work, it re-opened in March 2016. In April 2019 preparatory works began to replace the temporary bridge with a new bridge. The crossing was closed from September 2019 until Easter 2020, while the new bridge was installed.

The river is also a stronghold of the endangered white clawed crayfish (&quot;Austropotamobius pallipes&quot;).

<text>The 1912 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the V Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Stockholm, Sweden, between 5 May and 27 July 1912. A total of 2,407 athletes representing 28 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated, which included seven teams making their Olympic debut at the Summer Games; Chile, Egypt, Iceland, Japan, Luxembourg, Portugal, and Serbia. The games featured 107 events in 19 disciplines. The games included the Olympic debut of equestrian dressage and eventing, as well as the modern pentathlon.

Athletes representing 19 NOCs received at least one medal, with 16 winning at least one gold medal. Sweden won the most medals overall, with 65, while the United States won the most gold medals, with 44. Among individual participants, Swedish shooter Vilhelm Carlberg, Finnish runner Hannes Kolehmainen, and American shooter Alfred Lane tied for the most gold medals, with three each. Carlberg had the most total medals, with five (three gold, two silver).

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

The 1912 Games featured five art competitions which awarded medals, but did not do so for a full top three, instead opting to award only a first or first and second place medal. Only gold and no silver or bronze medals were awarded in architecture, literature, music, and painting. In sculpturing, a gold and silver medal, but no bronze, were awarded.

In the men&#x27;s light heavyweight Greco-Roman, the final round featured three wrestlers, Anders Ahlgren, Ivar Böhling, and Béla Varga, who took turns facing off against one another. Ahlgren and Böhling defeated Varga, but they were unable to defeat each other. The match between Ahlgren and Böhling lasted for over 9 hours without a victor. The Olympic rules at the time specifically stated that the winner must have beaten their opponent, and since neither person could claim to have done so, both Ahlgreen and Böhling were awarded silver medals, with no gold being awarded.

In men&#x27;s single sculls and men&#x27;s coxed four, there were two-way ties for third which resulted in two bronze medals being awarded in each event. In men&#x27;s pole vault, there was a two-way tie for second, which resulted in two silver medals being awarded. Additionally, there was a three-way tie for fourth, which the IOC awarded bronze medals for. 

In the tug of war, three of the five teams withdrew for unknown reasons, resulting in only two teams participating and a bronze medal not being awarded. Three teams made the final round of the men&#x27;s 4 x 100 metres relay, but when Germany was disqualified for a faulty baton pass, it resulted in no bronze medal being awarded for the event.

<doc id="921260" wikidata="Q680060" url="?curid=921260" title="Pilatus PC-21">
<text>The Pilatus PC-21 is a turboprop-powered advanced trainer with a stepped tandem cockpit. It is manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland.

==Development==
In November 1997 Pilatus flew a modified PC-7 Mk.II in order to test improvements for a prospective next generation turboprop trainer. As a result of these tests, Pilatus elected to fund the development of a new training system in November 1998; development of the new trainer, designated as the &quot;PC-21&quot;, formally started in January 1999. The PC-21 would be developed and certified as a completely new training system, aimed at meeting future military customers&#x27; specifications in terms of capability and life-cycle costs for the next three decades.

A key aim for the PC-21 was to allow jet aircraft pilots to perform the majority of their training using the type before converting to jet-powered types, allowing operators to make substantial savings. In order to achieve this aim, the new trainer was required to have an expanded performance envelope in terms of aerodynamics, cockpit equipment, flexibility, and ease of maintenance. In May 2002 Pilatus announced that it aimed for the PC-21 to capture 50% of the global trainer aircraft market between 2005 and 2030.

From the start of the aircraft&#x27;s development, Pilatus aimed for the type to have a predictable cost profile over its full lifespan. To meet this goal, the firm chose to incorporate modern materials, an innovative design concept, and full-scale fatigue analysis. Additionally, accompanying the aircraft itself are integrated training systems to meet the pilot&#x27;s needs; the full package offered by Pilatus includes synthetic training devices, computer-based training, and classroom instruction. As a result of greater training effectiveness, pilots can graduate with fewer total training hours, reaching the frontline faster and at lower cost. In addition to pilots, various prospective aircrew, such as navigators, weapons officers, and electronic warfare operators, can be trained using the type&#x27;s embedded simulation/emulation system.

On 30 April 2002, the rollout of the first PC-21 prototype was performed at Pilatus&#x27; factory in Stans, Switzerland; this aircraft conducted its first flight on 1 July of the same year. In May 2003, Pilatus management formally green-lit the program to proceed to full development. On 7 June 2004, a second PC-21 prototype, the construction of which had been delayed to incorporate improvements learnt from assembling the first, made its maiden flight. In December 2004, Switzerland&#x27;s Federal Office for Civil Aviation granted type certification for the PC-21; civil certification was attained despite it being a military aircraft as this permitted civil maintenance procedures to be used as well as allowing the aircraft to be supplied under private finance arrangements. Individual Swiss military certification for equipment such as ejection seats has been applied as necessary.

On 13 January 2005, the second of the two development aircraft crashed in Buochs, Switzerland, while conducting an aerobatic training flight; the accident resulted in the death of the pilot as well as injuring another person on the ground. In response to the accident, the other PC-21 was grounded for several weeks until Swiss authorities had established that there was no sign of technical malfunction. In August 2006, it was announced that crash investigators had concluded that pilot error had been a primary cause. In late August 2005, the first pre-series production PC-21 performed its maiden flight.

==Design==
The Pilatus PC-21 is an advanced single-engine trainer aircraft; it is often referred to by Pilatus as being the &quot;Twenty-first Century Trainer&quot;. The type can be applied for various training capacities, including basic flying training, advanced flight training, full mission management training, and embedded simulation/emulation. In order to perform these functions, the aircraft possesses a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective integrated training system; providing sufficient ease of use for inexperienced pilots while posing greater challenge to advanced pilots. According to Pilatus, upon product launch, the PC-21 possessed &quot;superior aerodynamic performance when compared with any other turboprop trainer on the market&quot;.

The aircraft features a tandem-seating arrangement (student in front/instructor behind) in a bird strike-resistant glass canopy with allround vision. The cabin, which is pressurized, is equipped with an On-Board Oxygen Generation System (OBOGS), air conditioning, and Martin-Baker CH16C Zero-Zero ejection seats. The flight controls, which are fully balanced and harmonized, are optimized for ease of operation and overall effectiveness. An anti-g system is also present in order to minimize the effects of high g-forces experienced during tactical training and aerobatic maneuvers. Pilots are able to spend a greater amount of time concentrating on the aircraft&#x27;s external situation and upon mission data inputs due to an ergonomic design approach, ease-of-use controls, and clear visual/system data displays. In addition, a full autopilot and civil flight management system are also present.

The PC-21 is powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-68B turboprop engine of 1,600 shaft horse power, which drives a five-bladed graphite scimitar propeller manufactured by Hartzell; it has been claimed by Pilatus that the PC-21 possesses speed and climb rates previously normally performed only by jet-powered aircraft. It is also fitted with a high-speed profile wing, rated for maneuvers up to 8g, complete with hydraulically-assisted ailerons and spoilers which enable the execution of fighter-like rates of roll and other maneuvers. In order to make the aircraft easy to fly at low speeds, crucial to the advanced trainer role, the PC-21 is furnished with a digital power management system and the rudder control system is equipped with an automatic yaw compensator/suppression system to compensate for airspeed and engine power changes.

A key feature of the PC-21 is the embedded simulation and training suite, which provides cross-platform cockpit emulation, weapons simulation, stores management system, simulated radar and electronic warfare, a tactical situation display, and data link functionality. Key to this is the Mission Support System (MSS), which comprises the Mission Planning System (MPS) and Mission Debriefing System (MDS); data can be loaded and unloaded from these, which is compatible with ground-based stations for pre-flight configuration or post-mission analysis. The integrated mission computer is of an open architecture, allowing for third-party modifications and upgrades to take place; software can also be customized to conform to customer preferences. Critical and non-critical software are also deliberately separated.

The cockpit of the PC-21 features a high level of systems integration and conforms to modern avionics standards. The systems of the forward and rear cockpits can be &#x27;de-coupled&#x27; between the student and instructor; the instructor may exercise real-time manipulation of the student&#x27;s displays, sensor performance, and system modes such as to create synthetic air-to-air radar targets, artificial non-safety critical system failures, and controlled data degradation. The aircraft&#x27;s fully digital glass cockpit features three large colour liquid crystal displays (LCD), one performing as the primary flight display (PFD) and two multi-function displays (MFDs) for system/mission management, in addition to CMC Electronics-provided head-up displays (HUD) for both the pilot and instructor. The trim gauge is the only analogue dial in the cockpit. For control simplicity, a Hands on Throttle and Stick (HOTAS) control philosophy has been followed. Both the display and control systems present also resemble their counterparts used upon modern front-line combat aircraft for greater realism during training; and can be further customized in order to be more representative of specific combat aircraft. The multi-sensor navigation system is capable of operating under a military tactical mode as well as a civil navigation mode.

==Operational history==

In the Armament Program 2006, the Swiss Parliament approved an initial purchase of the PC-21 for the Swiss Air Force. By April 2008, four PC-21 have been accepted by the Swiss Air Force following the passing of acceptance trials, and flight operations were set to start in July that year. In December 2010, the Swiss Air Force placed an order for another two aircraft.

In November 2006, the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) awarded a service contract to Lockheed Martin Simulation, Training and Support (LMSTS) to deliver 19 PC-21 aircraft, to support the RSAF&#x27;s Basic Wings training course at RAAF Base Pearce in Australia under a public–private partnership (PPP) arrangement, replacing the SIAI-Marchetti S.211. Singapore was the first export customer for the PC-21. On 21 January 2008, the first RSAF PC-21 completed its flight test prior to being accepted into service. On 13 July 2008, the type began to provide the RSAF with basic flying training, by which point a further six aircraft had been delivered.

During the 2009 Dubai Airshow, the United Arab Emirates announced an order of 25 PC-21 trainers for the United Arab Emirates Air Force (UAEAF) to replace its aging fleet of Pilatus PC-7s. On 22 November 2010, the UAEAF&#x27;s first PC-21 performed its maiden flight. In July 2012, it was announced that the Qatar Air Force had placed an order for a complete pilot training system from Pilatus centering upon the PC-21. The package included ground-based training devices, logistical support and maintenance in addition to 24 PC-21 aircraft. On 1 October 2014, the Qatar Air Force formally received its first batch of PC-21 trainers.

On 23 May 2012, Saudi Arabia signed a £1.6 billion ($2.5 billion) contract for a comprehensive next-generation military pilot training system, comprising 22 BAE Systems Hawk advanced jet trainers in addition to 55 PC-21 trainers. In early June 2014, Pilatus commenced delivery of the first six PC-21s to Saudi Arabia; by the end of 2015, this had risen to 46 PC-21s delivered.

The PC-21 was one of the submissions for the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s project AIR 5428, which sought a replacement of its Pilatus PC-9s; in September 2015, it was announced that the consortium comprising Lockheed Martin, Pilatus and Hawker Pacific (&quot;Team 21&quot;), had won the bid to provide 49 PC-21s to the Australian Defence Force.

In August 2015, Pilatus received a contract to deliver nine PC-9Ms to the Royal Jordanian Air Force, but in April 2016 changed the order to eight PC-21s. Deliveries were due to start in January 2017 under the original deal.

In January 2017, Pilatus received a contract for 17 PC-21s by the French Department of Defense as a new training aircraft. On 31 August 2018, France&#x27;s defence procurement agency Direction générale de l&#x27;armement announced the arrival of the first two PC-21s. The delivery of the remaining aircraft is scheduled to be completed in 2019.

The PC-21 has been evaluated by the Spanish Air Force (along with the Beechcraft T-6 Texan II and the PZL-130 Orlik III), as a possible substitute for its ENAER T-35 Pillan and CASA C-101 Aviojet trainer aircraft. January 2020 saw the Spanish Air Force confirm an order for 24 PC-21 aircraft, which will replace mainly the CASA C-101 Aviojet, but will also take over advanced training which is currently carried out on the T-35 Pillan.

The Belgian Air Force is also considering the PC-21, among other platforms, to potentially replace its fleet of SF260 Marchetti trainers, which are nearing the end of their service lives.

<doc id="921262" wikidata="Q549047" url="?curid=921262" title="C. Auguste Dupin">
<text>&quot;Le Chevalier&quot; C. Auguste Dupin is a fictional character created by Edgar Allan Poe. Dupin made his first appearance in Poe&#x27;s 1841 short story &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, widely considered the first detective fiction story. He reappears in &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot; (1842) and &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot; (1844).

Dupin is not a professional detective and his motivations for solving the mysteries change throughout the three stories. Using what Poe termed &quot;&quot;, Dupin combines his considerable intellect with creative imagination, even putting himself in the mind of the criminal. His talents are strong enough that he appears able to read the mind of his companion, the unnamed narrator of all three stories.

Poe created the Dupin character before the word &quot;detective&quot; had been coined. The character laid the groundwork for fictional detectives to come, including Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot and many others. Dupin also established most of the common elements of the detective fiction genre.

==Character background and analysis==

Dupin is from what was once a wealthy family, but &quot;by a variety of untoward events&quot; has been reduced to more humble circumstances, and contents himself only with the basic necessities of life. He now lives in Paris with his close friend, the anonymous narrator of the stories. The two met by accident while both were searching for &quot;the same rare and very remarkable volume&quot; in an obscure library. This scene, the two characters searching for a hidden text, serves as a metaphor for detection. They promptly move to an old manor located in Faubourg Saint-Germain. For hobbies, Dupin is &quot;fond&quot; of enigmas, conundrums, and hieroglyphics. He bears the title &quot;Chevalier&quot;, meaning that he is a knight in the Légion d&#x27;honneur. Dupin shares some features with the later gentleman detective, a character type that became common in the Golden Age of Detective Fiction. He is acquainted with police prefect &quot;G.&quot;, who appears in all three stories seeking his counsel.

In &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, Dupin investigates the murder of a mother and daughter in Paris. He investigates another murder in &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot;. This story was based on the true story of Mary Rogers, a saleswoman at a cigar store in Manhattan whose body was found floating in the Hudson River in 1841. Dupin&#x27;s final appearance, in &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;, features an investigation of a letter stolen from the French queen. Poe called this story &quot;perhaps, the best of my tales of ratiocination&quot;. Throughout the three stories, Dupin travels through three distinct settings. In &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, he travels through city streets; in &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot;, he is in the wide outdoors; in &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;, he is in an enclosed private space.

Dupin is not actually a professional detective, and his motivations change through his appearances. In &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, he investigates the murders for his personal amusement, and to prove the innocence of a falsely accused man. He refuses a financial reward. However, in &quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;, Dupin purposefully pursues a financial reward.

==Dupin&#x27;s method==
While discussing Dupin&#x27;s method in the light of Charles Sanders Peirce&#x27;s logic of making good guesses or &quot;abductive reasoning,&quot; Nancy Harrowitz first quotes Poe&#x27;s definition of analysis and then shows how &quot;Poe the semiotician is running the gamut of possibilities here—inferences, reasoning backwards, visual, sensual and aural signs, reading faces. Playing cards with the man would have been an interesting experience.&quot;

There is considerable controversy about the philosophical nature of Dupin&#x27;s method. According to biographer Joseph Krutch, Dupin is portrayed as a dehumanized thinking machine, a man whose sole interest is in pure logic. However, Krutch has been accused elsewhere of a &quot;lazy reading&quot; of Poe. According to Krutch, Dupin&#x27;s deductive prowess is first exhibited when he appears to read the narrator&#x27;s mind by rationally tracing his train of thought for the previous fifteen minutes. He employs what he terms &quot;ratiocination&quot;. Dupin&#x27;s method is to identify with the criminal and put himself in his mind. By knowing everything that the criminal knows, he can solve any crime. His attitude towards life seems to portray him as a snob who feels that due to his aptitude normal human interaction and relationships are beneath him. In this method, he combines his scientific logic with artistic imagination. As an observer, he pays special attention to what is unintended, such as hesitation, eagerness or a casual or inadvertent word.

Dupin&#x27;s method also emphasizes the importance of reading and writing: many of his clues come from newspapers or written reports from the Prefect. This device also engages the readers, who follow along by reading the clues themselves.

==Inspiration==
Poe may have derived the name &quot;Dupin&quot; from a character in a series of stories first published &quot;Burton&#x27;s Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1828 called &quot;Unpublished passages in the Life of Vidocq, the French Minister of Police&quot;. The name also implies &quot;&quot; or deception, a skill Dupin shows off in &quot;The Purloined Letter.&quot; Detective fiction, however, had few precedents and the word &quot;detective&quot; had not yet been coined when Poe first introduced Dupin. The closest example in fiction is Voltaire&#x27;s &quot;Zadig&quot; (1748), in which the main character performs similar feats of analysis, themselves borrowed from &quot;The Three Princes of Serendip&quot;, an Italian rendition of a famous poem called Hasht Bihisht written by the Persian poet Amir Khusrau, which itself is based on the &quot;Haft Paykar&quot; by Nizami Ganjavi, written around 1197 AD, which in turn takes its outline from the earlier epic Shahnameh written by the Persian poet Firdausi around 1010 AD.

It is often interpreted that Poe borrowed the name from André Marie Jean Jacques Dupin. The first Dupin story coincided in &quot;Graham&#x27;s Magazine&quot; with Poe&#x27;s review of a translation of Louis de Loménie&#x27;s biographical sketches. Both André Dupin and his brilliant brother Charles are profiled by Loménie. It has also been argued that Poe adapted the autobiographical persona of Thomas De Quincey&#x27;s &quot;The Opium-Eater&quot; into Dupin.

In writing the series of Dupin tales, Poe capitalized on contemporary popular interest. His use of an orangutan in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; was inspired by the popular reaction to an orangutan that had been on display at the Masonic Hall in Philadelphia in July 1839. In &quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot;, he used a true story that had become of national interest.

It is sometimes speculated that Poe conceived the idea of Dupin from his investigation of the authenticity of an automaton called The Turk, which he published in his essay &quot;Mälzel&#x27;s Chess Player&quot;.

==Literary influence and significance==

C. Auguste Dupin is generally acknowledged as the first detective in fiction. The character served as the prototype for many that were created later, including Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle and Hercule Poirot by Agatha Christie. Conan Doyle once wrote, &quot;Each [of Poe&#x27;s detective stories] is a root from which a whole literature has developed... Where was the detective story until Poe breathed the breath of life into it?&quot;

Many tropes that would later become commonplace in detective fiction first appeared in Poe&#x27;s stories: the eccentric but brilliant detective, the bumbling constabulary, the first-person narration by a close personal friend. Dupin also initiates the storytelling device where the detective announces his solution and then explains the reasoning leading up to it. Like Sherlock Holmes, Dupin uses his considerable deductive prowess and observation to solve crimes. Poe also portrays the police in an unsympathetic manner as a sort of foil to the detective.

The character helped establish the genre of detective fiction, distinct from mystery fiction, with an emphasis on the analysis and not trial-and-error. Brander Matthews wrote: &quot;The true detective story as Poe conceived it is not in the mystery itself, but rather in the successive steps whereby the analytic observer is enabled to solve the problem that might be dismissed as beyond human elucidation.&quot; In fact, in the three stories which star Dupin, Poe created three types of detective fiction which established a model for all future stories: the physical type (&quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;), the mental (&quot;The Mystery of Marie Rogêt&quot;), and a balanced version of both (&quot;The Purloined Letter&quot;).

Fyodor Dostoevsky called Poe &quot;an enormously talented writer&quot; and favorably reviewed Poe&#x27;s detective stories. The character Porfiry Petrovich in Dostoevsky&#x27;s novel &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; was influenced by Dupin.

==Other writers==

* In the first Sherlock Holmes story, &quot;A Study in Scarlet&quot; (1887), Doctor Watson compares Holmes to Dupin, to which Holmes replies: &quot;No doubt you think you are complimenting me ... In my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow... He had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appears to imagine&quot;. Alluding to an episode in &quot;The Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot;, where Dupin deduces what his friend is thinking despite their having walked together in silence for a quarter of an hour, Holmes remarks: &quot;That trick of his breaking in on his friend&#x27;s thoughts with an apropos remark... is really very showy and superficial&quot;; nevertheless, Holmes later performs the same &#x27;trick&#x27; on Watson in &quot;The Adventure of the Cardboard Box&quot;.
* Louisa May Alcott parodied Dupin and Poe in her 1865 thriller &quot;V.V., or Plots and Counterplots&quot;, which has been credited by literary critic Catherine Ross Nickerson as the second-oldest work of modern detective fiction after only Poe&#x27;s Dupin stories themselves. A short story published anonymously by Alcott, the story concerns a Scottish aristocrat who tries to prove that a mysterious woman has killed his fiancée and cousin. The detective on the case, Antoine Dupres, is a parody of Auguste Dupin who is less concerned with solving the crime than he is in setting up a way to reveal the solution with a dramatic flourish.
* In &quot;Murder in the Madhouse&quot; (1935), the first of Jonathan Latimer&#x27;s series of screwball crime novels starring detective William Crane, Crane presents himself in the sanitarium as C. Auguste Dupin. The story contains more oblique references in the form of stylistic elements (offstage murders, Crane&#x27;s theories of deduction) that suggest Poe had an influence on Latimer&#x27;s writing.
* Jorge Luis Borges pays homage to Poe&#x27;s Dupin in &quot;Death and the Compass&quot;, by calling his main detective character Erik Lönrott an &quot;Auguste Dupin&quot;-type detective. This is one of the stories published by Borges in his &quot;Ficciones&quot; (1944). Borges also translated Poe&#x27;s works into Spanish.
* Dupin had considerable impact on the Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot, first introduced in &quot;The Mysterious Affair at Styles&quot; (1920). Later in the fictional detective&#x27;s life, he writes a book on Edgar Allan Poe in the novel &quot;Third Girl&quot; (1966).
* Dupin next appears in a series of seven short stories in &quot;Ellery Queen&#x27;s Mystery Magazine&quot; by Michael Harrison in the 1960s. The stories were collected by the Publishers Mycroft &amp; Moran in 1968 as &quot;The Exploits of Chevalier Dupin&quot;. The stories include &quot;The Vanished Treasure&quot; (May 1965) and &quot;The Fires in the Rue St. Honoré&quot; (January 1967). This collection was subsequently published in England by Tom Stacey in 1972 as &quot;Murder in the Rue Royale and Further Exploits of the Chevalier Dupin&quot; and included a further five stories written since the original publication.
* In &quot;The Work of Betrayal&quot; (1975) by Mario Brelich – Dupin investigates the mysterious case of Judas Iscariot.
*In &quot;The New Murders of the Rue Morgue&quot; (1984), a short story in volume two of Clive Barker&#x27;s Books of Blood. Set presumably in 1984, the story features Lewis, a descendant of Dupin, who stumbles upon a nearly identical case.
* &quot;The Man Who Was Poe&quot;, (1991) a juvenile novel by Avi, features Dupin befriending a young boy named Edmund. The two solve mysteries together in Providence, Rhode Island. Dupin is revealed to be Edgar Allan Poe himself.
* Novelist George Egon Hatvary uses Dupin in his novel &quot;The Murder of Edgar Allan Poe&quot; (1997) as detective and narrator. Dupin travels to America to investigate the circumstances of Poe&#x27;s mysterious death in 1849. In the novel, Dupin and Poe became friends when Poe stayed in Paris in 1829, and it was Poe who assisted Dupin in the three cases about which Poe wrote. Hatvary writes that Dupin resembles Poe, so much so that several people confuse the two on first sight.
* Dupin makes a guest appearance in the first two issues of Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I&quot; (1999) graphic novel series, helping to track down and subdue the monstrous, Hulk-like Mr. Hyde (who is living secretly in Paris after faking the death described in &quot;The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde&quot; and is the actual murderer from Dupin&#x27;s first short story). He informs the protagonists (Mina Murray from &quot;Dracula&quot;, Allan Quatermain from &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and Captain Nemo from &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas&quot;) that the murders in the Rue Morgue have started to happen again, one of the first victims being Anna &quot;Nana&quot; Coupeau.
* &quot;The Black Throne&quot; (2002) by Roger Zelazny &amp; Fred Saberhagen – is a novel about Poe which has an appearance by Dupin.
* Dupin is the hero of &quot;Les ogres de Montfaucon&quot; by Gérard Dôle (2004), a collection of thirteen detective stories set in the 19th century, the last of which (« Le drame de Reichenbach ») also provides a link with Sherlock Holmes.
* Dupin teams up with the Count of Monte-Cristo to fight &quot;Les Habits Noirs&quot; in the story &quot;The Kind-Hearted Torturer&quot; by John Peel published in the anthology Tales of the Shadowmen, Volume 1 (2005).
* The search for the &quot;real Dupin&quot; is at the center of Matthew Pearl&#x27;s novel &quot;The Poe Shadow&quot; (2006).
* Dupin makes an appearance, alongside Poe himself, in the novel &quot;Edgar Allan Poe on Mars&quot; (2007) by Jean-Marc Lofficier &amp; Randy Lofficier.
* Dupin is referenced in &quot;The Rook&quot; (2008) by Steven James.
* In &quot;The Paralogs of Phileas Fogg&quot; (2016), author James Downard has Dupin help Fogg and his cohorts resolve some issues during the American leg of their around-the-world adventure.
* C. Auguste Dupin and Edgar Allan Poe are a sleuthing duo in Karen Lee Street&#x27;s gothic mystery trilogy: &quot;Edgar Allan Poe and the London Monster&quot; (2016); &quot;Edgar Allan Poe and the Jewel of Peru&quot; (2018); and &quot;Edgar Allan Poe and the Empire of the Dead&quot; (2019).
* Dupin teams up with the husband of alleged murderer Delphine LaLaurie to tackle supernatural threats in Jason Martin&#x27;s 2023 novel, &quot;Witches in the Morgue: An Auguste Dupin Investigation&quot;. A second book in the series, &quot;Auguste Dupin and the Wolves of God&quot;, was expected for release in 2024.

<text>Wire transfer, bank transfer, or credit transfer, is a method of electronic funds transfer from one person or entity to another. A wire transfer can be made from one bank account to another bank account, or through a transfer of cash at a cash office.

Different wire transfer systems and operators provide a variety of options relative to the immediacy and finality of settlement and the cost, value, and volume of transactions. Central bank wire transfer systems, such as the Federal Reserve″s Fedwire system in the United States, are more likely to be real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems, as they provide the quickest availability of funds. This is because they post the gross (complete) entry against electronic accounts of the wire transfer system operator. Other systems, such as the Clearing House Interbank Payments System (CHIPS), provide net settlement on a periodic basis. More immediate settlement systems tend to process higher monetary value time-critical transactions, have higher transaction costs, and have a smaller volume of payments. A faster settlement process allows less time for currency fluctuations while money is in transit.

== History ==
The first widely used service for wire transfers was launched by Western Union in 1872 on its existing telegraph network. Once a sender had paid money to one telegraph office, the operator could transmit a message and &quot;wire&quot; the money to another office, using passwords, code books to authorize the release of the funds to a recipient at that location. By 1877 the service was used to transfer almost $2.5 million each year. Because the earliest wire transfers were using telegraph networks, it was termed telegraphic transfer and this name is still used in some countries.

== Process ==

A bank wire transfer is effected as follows:

# The entity wishing to do a transfer approaches a bank and gives the bank the order to transfer a certain amount of money. IBAN and BIC codes are typically given as well so the bank knows where the money needs to be sent.
# The sending bank transmits a message, via a secure system (such as SWIFT or Fedwire), to the receiving bank, requesting that it effect payment according to the instructions given.
# The message also includes settlement instructions. The actual transfer is not instantaneous: funds may take several hours or even days to move from the sender&#x27;s account to the receiver&#x27;s account.
# Either the banks involved must hold a reciprocal account with each other, or the payment must be sent to a bank with such an account, a correspondent bank, for further benefit to the ultimate recipient.

Banks collect payment for the service from the sender as well as from the recipient. The sending bank typically collects a fee separate from the funds being transferred, while the receiving bank and intermediary banks through which the transfer travels deduct fees from the money being transferred so that the recipient receives less than what the sender sent.

For international wire transfers, additional information may be required, such as the recipient’s full name, physical address, bank name and address, bank account number and type, bank routing number, and the bank&#x27;s SWIFT or IBAN code. The fees and processing times can vary depending on the service provider and the destination country.

== Regulation and price ==
===In general===
Banks may charge fees for wire transfers. The exact fees vary widely depending on the type of payment and the type of bank accounts involved. In some jurisdictions the fees may be regulated or capped.

=== European Union ===
Since 2009 the European Union Regulation No 924/2009 controls cross-border payments in the European Union. In the new regulation Article 1 (q.v., Ref.4) states that an IBAN/BIC transfer within Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) must not cost more than a national transfer, no matter which currency is used. The receiving bank can charge for exchanging to local currency. As of 2022, most European banks do not charge private customers for SEPA transfers, apart from possible exchange fees. For business accounts, fees may be charged, but usually less than 40 cents.

Prior to this, in 2002 the European Union relegated the regulation of fees a bank may charge for payments in euro between EU member states down to the domestic level, resulting in very low or no fees for electronic transfers within the Eurozone. In 2005, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway joined the EU regulation on electronic transfers. However, this regulation was superseded by the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), consisting of 32 European countries.

=== United States ===
In the United States, domestic wire transfers are governed by Federal Regulation J and by Article 4A of the Uniform Commercial Code.
US wire transfers can be costly. In 2016, among the 15 largest retail banks, the average fee for an outgoing domestic wire was $25. Incoming domestic wire fees were about evenly split between $0 (free) and $15.

=== Australia ===
In Australia, money transfers are primarily regulated by the Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission, there is sometimes further regulation by the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre in industries where money laundering or terrorism financing are a risk; such as money remittance services. Domestic transfers in Australia are generally free to consumers. International transfers can be costly, and banks will often charge a fee between $0 (free) and $30, and an FX margin (the difference between the interbank rate, and the rate that you are charged). Cheaper alternatives to the banks are available from foreign exchange brokers, who usually charge a lower fee and/or margin.

== Security ==
With bank-to-bank wire transfer, each account holder must have a proven identity. Unlike credit card payments, wire transfers can generally not be recalled (though recalls are possible in some cases and jurisdictions). Information contained in wires is transmitted securely through encrypted communications methods.

Wire transfers done through cash offices are essentially anonymous and are designed for transfer between persons who trust each other. It is unsafe to send money by wire to an unknown person to collect at a cash office; the receiver of the money may, after collecting it, not provide whatever goods or services they promised in return for the payment, but instead simply disappear. This scam has been used often, especially in the so-called &quot;419 scams&quot; which often nominate Western Union for collection.

International transfers involving the United States are subject to monitoring by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which monitors information provided in the text of the wire and then decides whether, according to the US Government&#x27;s federal regulations and political positions, money is being transferred to terrorist groups, or countries or entities under by the United States government. If a financial institution suspects that funds are being sent from or to one of these entities, it must block the transfer and freeze the funds.

SWIFT wire transfers are not completely free of vulnerabilities. Every intermediary bank that handles a wire transaction can take a fee directly out of the wire payload (the assets being transferred) without the account holder&#x27;s knowledge or consent. In many places, there is no legislation or technical means to protect customers from this practice. If bank S is the sending bank (or brokerage), and bank R is the receiving bank (or brokerage), and banks I1, I2 and I3 are intermediary banks, the client may have a contract only with bank S and/or R, but banks I1, I2 and I3 can (and often do) take money from the wire without any direct arrangement with the client. Clients are sometimes taken by surprise when less money arrives at bank R. Contrast this with cheques, where the amount transferred is guaranteed in full, and fees (if there are any) can be charged only at endpoint banks.

The European Union offers some partial protection from this practice by prohibiting European intermediary banks from taking a fee out of the amount being transferred, even for transatlantic transfers. However, it is still common practice for a European brokerage firm to state that they charge no transfer fee, and then contact their bank to take an unpublished fee from the amount transferred as a means to compensate their bank with their clients&#x27; assets.

== Methods ==

=== Retail money transfers ===

One of the largest companies that offer wire transfer is Western Union, which allows individuals to transfer or receive money without an account with Western Union or any financial institution. Concern and controversy about Western Union transfers have increased in recent years, because of the increased monitoring of money-laundering transactions, as well as concern about terrorist groups using the service, particularly in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks. Although Western Union keeps information about senders and receivers, some transactions can be done essentially anonymously, for the receiver is not always required to show identification.

Another option for consumers and businesses transferring money internationally is to use specialised brokerage houses for their international money transfer needs. Many of these specialised brokerage houses can transfer money at better exchange rates compared to banks, thus saving up to 4%. These providers can offer a range of currency exchange products like Spot Contracts, Forward Contracts and Limit Orders. However, not all such providers are regulated by appropriate government bodies. For example, in the UK, even though such companies are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, not all of them fall under (FCA) scrutiny. Regulators include the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), the Financial Transactions Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) in Canada, the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department in Hong Kong and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the UK.

=== International ===

Most international transfers are executed through SWIFT, a co-operative society founded in 1974 by seven international banks, which operate a global network to facilitate the transfer of financial messages. Using these messages, banks can exchange data for the transfer of funds between financial institutions. SWIFT&#x27;s headquarters are in La Hulpe, on the outskirts of Brussels, Belgium.

SWIFT also acts as an international standards body for the creation and maintenance of financial-messaging standards. See SWIFT Standards.

Each financial institution is assigned an ISO 9362 code, also called a &quot;Bank Identifier Code&quot; (&quot;BIC&quot;) or &quot;SWIFT Code&quot;.
These codes are generally eight characters long. For example: Deutsche Bank is an international bank with its head office in Frankfurt, Germany, the SWIFT Code for which is &quot;DEUTDEFF&quot;:

* &quot;DEUT&quot; identifies Deutsche Bank.
* &quot;DE&quot; is the country code for Germany.
* &quot;FF&quot; is the code for Frankfurt.

Using an extended code of 11 digits (if the receiving bank has assigned extended codes to branches or to processing areas) allows the payment to be directed to a specific office. For example: DEUTDEFF500 would direct the payment to an office of Deutsche Bank in Bad Homburg. SWIFT deviates slightly from the standard, though, by using position nine for a Logical Terminal ID, making its extended codes 12 digits long.

European banks making transfers within the European Union and within Switzerland also use the International Bank Account Number, or IBAN.

==== International prepaid cards ====
International prepaid cards are an alternative way for transferring funds. Companies can provide a debit card for worldwide employees&#x27; payments. The recipients do not need to have a bank account and can use the card in places that a debit card is accepted at point-of-sale or online and may withdraw funds in local currency at an ATM.

===United States===
Banks in the United States use SWIFT to send messages to notify banks in other countries that a payment has been made. Banks use the Fedwire system or CHIPS to actually effect the payment.

Domestic bank-to-bank wire transfers are conducted through Fedwire or CHIPS. Transmitting and receiving US banks are uniquely identified by their ABA routing transit number.

== Other electronic transfers ==

Other forms of electronic transfers include, for example, electronic funds transfer system (EFTS). This is the system used to transfer money from a bank account to another party. It is also the system used in some payments made via a bank&#x27;s online bill payment service. These transfers are made using a bank routing number and the account number at that institution. EFTS transfers differ from wire transfers in important legal ways. An EFTS payment is essentially an electronic personal check, whereas a wire transfer is more like an electronic cashier&#x27;s check.

EFTS transfers are often called &quot;ACH transfers&quot;, because they take place through Automated Clearing Houses.

One important way ACH transfers differ from wire transfer is that the recipient can initiate it. There are of course restrictions, but this is the way people often set up automatic bill payment with utility companies, for example.

<text>Elsie Janis (born Elsie Bierbower, March 16, 1889 – February 26, 1956) was an American actress of stage and screen, singer, songwriter, screenwriter and radio announcer. Entertaining the troops during World War I immortalized her as &quot;the sweetheart of the AEF&quot; (American Expeditionary Force).

==Early life==
Elsie Bierbower was born in Marion, Ohio, the daughter of Josephine Janis and John Eleazer Bierbower. She had a brother, Percy John.

==Stage==
Bierbower debuted on stage in 1896 in a production of &quot;East Lynne&quot; at Columbus&#x27;s Southern Theatre. By age 11, she was a headliner on the vaudeville circuit, performing under the name Little Elsie. As she matured, using the stage name Elsie Janis, she began perfecting her comedic skills.

Acclaimed by American and British critics, Janis was a headliner on Broadway and London. On Broadway, she starred in a number of successful shows, including &quot;The Vanderbilt Cup&quot; (1906), &quot;The Hoyden&quot; (1907), &quot;The Slim Princess&quot; (1911), and &quot;The Century Girl&quot; (1916).

Elsie performed at the grand opening of the Brown Theatre in Louisville, Kentucky on October 5, 1925.

==Film, screenwriting and music==
Janis also enjoyed a career as a Hollywood actress, screenwriter, production manager and composer. She was co-credited alongside Gene Markey for writing the original story for &quot;Close Harmony&quot; (1929) and as composer and production manager for &quot;Paramount on Parade&quot; (1930). She and director Edmund Goulding wrote the song &quot;Love, Your Magic Spell Is Everywhere&quot; for Gloria Swanson for her talkie debut film &quot;The Trespasser&quot; (1929). Janis&#x27;s song &quot;Oh, Give Me Time for Tenderness&quot; was featured in the Bette Davis movie &quot;Dark Victory&quot; (1939), also directed by Goulding.

==Life with Basil Hallam==
Before he entered service for World War I, English actor-singer Basil Hallam fell in love with Janis, with whom he had starred in &quot;The Passing Show of 1915&quot;. They set up home in the city of Liverpool, England. The couple never married; Hallam was killed in the Battle of the Somme in August 1916 while serving with the Royal Flying Corps.

==World War I==
Janis advocated for British and American soldiers fighting in World War I. She raised funds for Liberty Bonds. Accompanied by her mother, Janis also took her act on the road, entertaining troops stationed near the front lines – one of the first popular American artists to do so in a war fought on foreign soil. Ten days after the armistice, she recorded for HMV several numbers from her revue &quot;Hullo, America&quot;, including &quot;Give Me the Moonlight, Give Me the Girl&quot;. She wrote about her wartime experiences in &quot;The Big Show: My Six Months with the American Expeditionary Forces&quot; (published in 1919), and recreated these in &quot;Behind the Lines&quot;, a 1926 Vitaphone musical short.

A musical about this period of her life called &quot;Elsie Janis and the Boys&quot;, written by Carol J. Crittenden and composer John T. Prestianni, premiered under the direction of Charles A. Wallace as part of the Rotunda Theatre Series in the Wortley-Peabody Theater in Dallas, Texas on August 15, 2014.

==Radio announcer==
In 1934, Janis became the first female announcer on the NBC radio network.

==Children==
Janis wanted to have children of her own. She became a foster mother to a 14-year-old Italian war veteran and orphan, Michael Cardi, in 1919.

==Later life==
Janis maintained her private home “ElJan” on the east side of High Street in Columbus, Ohio. The home was across the street from what was Ohio State University&#x27;s Ohio Field, the precursor to Ohio Stadium. Janis sold the house following her mother&#x27;s death.

In 1932, Janis married Gilbert Wilson, who was 16 years her junior, which caused some scandal. There is some evidence it might have been a bearded relationship. The couple lived in the Phillipse Manor section of Sleepy Hollow, New York, formerly named North Tarrytown, until Janis moved to the Los Angeles area of California where she lived until her death. Her final film was the 1940 &quot;Women in War&quot;.

Elsie Janis died in 1956 at her home in Beverly Hills, California, aged 66, and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

==Legacy==
For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Elsie Janis has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6776 Hollywood Blvd.

<doc id="921266" wikidata="Q506028" url="?curid=921266" title="1908 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1908 Summer Olympics (also known as the Games of the IV Olympiad) was an international multi-sport event held from 27 April to 31 October 1908, in London, United Kingdom, coinciding with the Franco-British Exhibition. 

A total of 2,008 athletes representing 22 nations participated in 110 events in 18 sports. Diving, field hockey, and figure skating were contested for the first time at these Games. Argentina, Switzerland and Turkey were the only nations that did not earn any medals.

The host nation, the United Kingdom, with by far the most competitors, dominated the medal table, collecting the most gold (56), silver (51), and bronze (39) medals. The 146 medals won at these Games—a major increase from the two medals won at the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis—are still the highest number won by a British delegation at any modern Olympics. Particular success was achieved by the British team in the boxing events, where out of a possible fifteen medals across the five weight classes, they won all but the middleweight silver medal, which was taken by Reginald Baker competing for Australasia. The United States finished second in the medal standings, and Sweden third.

Australasia was the name given to the combined team of athletes from Australia (making its fourth Olympic appearance) and New Zealand (competing for the first time). The host team included a number of athletes from Ireland, at the time part of the United Kingdom. In contrast, Finland, which was integrated in the Russian Empire, competed in London as a separate country.

==Medal table==

This is the full table of the medal count of the 1908 Summer Olympics, based on the medal count of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This information is provided by the IOC; however the IOC does not recognize or endorse any ranking system.

==Notes==

 The IOC medal database incorrectly shows the bronze medal for Dorothy Greenhough-Smith in women&#x27;s figure skating for Germany (GER) instead of Great Britain (GBR), and therefore, counts 38 bronze medals for GBR and 6 bronze medals for GER. The corrected totals are shown on this table.&lt;br&gt;
 Anastasios Metaxas (GRE) is generally credited with a bronze medal in men&#x27;s individual trap shooting; no tie-breaker was held. The 1908 official report lists Metaxas as having tied with Alexander Maunder (GBR) and assigns bronze medals to each. However, Metaxas does not appear in the IOC medal database, which lists only Maunder as sole bronze medalist. The corrected totals are shown on this table.

<text>Walter Morten Grunwald (9 December 1934 – 14 November 2018) was a Danish actor, stage director and theatre manager.

==Early life and education==
He was born in Odense, Denmark, attended Odense Theatrical School in 1958, and graduated from the Royal Danish Theatre&#x27;s Theatrical School in 1962. Beginning in 1971, he was the manager of several theatres in Copenhagen.

==Career==
Grunwald made his debut in &quot;En blandt mange&quot; (&quot;One among many&quot;) in 1961.

He played one of the lead roles in the popular series of &quot;Olsen Gang&quot; movies, starring as Benny Frandsen, alongside Ove Sprogøe&#x27;s Egon Olsen and Poul Bundgaard&#x27;s Kjeld Jensen.

Grunwald founded and led Bristol Teatret in Copenhagen from 1971 to 1980. In 1979, Grunwald succeeded Bent Meiding as manager of the Betty Nansen Theatre, a post he held until 1992. From 1977, together with Peder Sadolin, his partner from Bristol Teatret, he was also a driving force behind the establishment of Østre Gasværk Teater in an abandoned gasometer.

Grunwald retired on 11 June 2017, stating his body was too old.

==Death==
On 16 October 2018, the 83-year-old Grunwald informed Danish media that he had developed thyroid cancer, and that he only had months left to live. Shortly before, he had cancelled an appearance at an event celebrating the 50th anniversary of the first Olsen Gang film, citing illness. He died a month later on 14 November 2018 in Hellerup, Denmark, aged 83.

<doc id="921274" wikidata="Q2120101" url="?curid=921274" title="Safe deposit box">
<text>A safe deposit box, sometimes referred to as a safety deposit box, is an individually secured container, usually held within a larger safe or bank vault. Safe deposit boxes are generally located in banks, post offices or other institutions. Safe deposit boxes are used to store valuable possessions, such as gemstones, precious metals, currency, marketable securities, luxury goods, important documents (e.g. wills, property deeds, or birth certificates), or computer data, which need protection from theft, fire, flood, tampering, or other perils. In the United States, neither banks nor the FDIC insure the contents. An individual can purchase separate insurance for the safe deposit box in order to cover e.g. theft, fire, flooding or terrorist attacks.

Some hotels, resorts, and cruise ships offer safe deposit boxes or small safes to their patrons, for temporary use during their stay. These facilities may be located behind the reception desk, or securely anchored within private guest rooms for privacy.

The contents of safe deposit boxes may be seized under the legal theory of abandoned property. They also may be searched and seized by the order of a court through the issuance of search warrant.

In the United States and elsewhere, safe deposit boxes are considered a &quot;legacy service&quot;; many new bank branches do not bother to install any. In the 20th century, bank branches were more prestigious; in the 21st century, space has grown more valuable with higher land values and rents, and many banks see the service as ancillary to their core business. Additionally, despite the public perception of safe deposit boxes as being extremely secure, there is little incentive for banks to actually ensure this is true; there are no federal laws in the US governing the matter or rules that would require compensation to customers if property stored there is stolen or destroyed.

<doc id="921275" wikidata="Q7750327" url="?curid=921275" title="The Marion Star">
<text>The Marion Star (formerly known as The Marion Daily Star) is a newspaper in Marion, Ohio. The paper is owned by the Gannett Newspaper organization. The paper is also notable as having once been owned and published by Warren G. Harding (prior to his election as President of the United States), and his wife Florence Kling Harding.

==History==
Founded as the Daily Pebble, the format of the small daily grew and became &quot;The Marion Daily Star&quot;. Harding acquired the struggling newspaper in 1884, for $300 with Johnny Sickel and Jack Warwick. Not long after the joint purchase, Harding became sole owner, with Sickel exiting out of frustration with the available equipment, and Warwick leaving for work on a bigger city paper. Harding began editing at the newspaper right after he acquired it and continued to until at least 1920. The dubious financial position of &quot;The Marion Daily Star&quot; improved following the marriage of Harding to Florence Kling DeWolfe, who promptly set about to straighten out the accounting, and increase circulation. American Civil Liberties Union founder and Socialist candidate for President Norman Thomas worked for the &quot;Daily Star&quot; while growing up in Marion.

Under Harding the newspaper&#x27;s editorial position leaned toward the Republican Party platform, but remained somewhat neutral because of its position of the daily newspaper and record for Marion County. However, Harding also launched The Marion Weekly Star, a once-a-week summary newspaper designed for mail delivery and rural circulation, which showed less restraint in its Republican stance. The Weekly Star was published from the 1890s into the 1910s when it was discontinued.

The Hardings retained ownership in the paper until mid-1923 when they sold the business to Brush-Moore Newspapers. For a number of years, the paper was part of the Thompson Newspaper chain based in Canada, who acquired Brush-Moore Newspapers in 1967. Under their ownership, the name was briefly changed to The Star in an attempt to broaden the marketability of the paper beyond the Marion County region. Now, again known as &quot;The Marion Star&quot;, the paper is owned and operated by Gannett, who purchased the paper from Thomson in 2000. Under Gannett, editorial, business offices, and retail advertising are maintained in Marion, while printing and classified advertising operations have been moved to a regional press house in Mansfield, Ohio.

The Marion Ohio Public Library and The Ohio Historical Society maintain microfilm libraries of newspaper for public research; the paper is also accessible for a monthly subscription fee through Ancestry.com and NewspaperArchives.com.

Starting April 2024, the newspaper will switch from carrier to postal delivery.

<doc id="921278" wikidata="Q1817463" url="?curid=921278" title="Lender of last resort">
<text>In public finance, a lender of last resort (LOLR) is the institution in a financial system that acts as the provider of liquidity to a financial institution which finds itself unable to obtain sufficient liquidity in the interbank lending market when other facilities or such sources have been exhausted. It is, in effect, a government guarantee to provide liquidity to financial institutions. Since the beginning of the 20th century, most central banks have been providers of lender of last resort facilities, and their functions usually also include ensuring liquidity in the financial market in general. 

The objective is to prevent economic disruption as a result of financial panics and bank runs spreading from one bank to the others due to a lack of liquidity in the first one. 

There are varying definitions of a lender of last resort, but a comprehensive one is that it is &quot;the discretionary provision of liquidity to a financial institution (or the market as a whole) by the central bank in reaction to an adverse shock which causes an abnormal increase in demand for liquidity which cannot be met from an alternative source&quot;.

While the concept itself had been used previously, the term &quot;lender of last resort&quot; was supposedly first used in its current context by Sir Francis Baring, in his &quot;Observations on the Establishment of the Bank of England&quot;, which was published in 1797.

==Classical theory==
Although Alexander Hamilton, in 1792, was the first policymaker to explain and implement a lender of last resort policy, the classical theory of the lender of last resort was mostly developed by two Englishmen in the 19th century: Henry Thornton and Walter Bagehot. Although some of the details remain controversial, their general theory is still widely acknowledged in modern research and provides a suitable benchmark. Thornton and Bagehot were mostly concerned with the reduction of the money supply. That was because they feared that the deflationary tendency caused by a reduction of the money supply could reduce the level of economic activity. If prices did not adjust quickly, it would lead to unemployment and a reduction in output. By keeping the money supply constant, the purchasing power remains stable during shocks. When there is a shock-induced panic, two things happen:

# The depositors fear that they will not be able to convert their deposits into suitably safe liquid assets: in 19th-century Britain, that meant gold or Bank of England notes, the latter being a component of high-powered money. They increase the amount of cash they hold relative to deposits.
# Banks, on the other hand, afraid of becoming illiquid, increase their reserves. Taken together, it reduces the money multiplier which, multiplied by the amount of base money, gives the money supply. This equation shows the relation: formula_1 where M is the money supply, B is the money base, C/D is the ratio of cash to deposits held by the public, and R/D is the ratio of reserves to deposits held by the banks. If the multiplier is reduced from a shock and the amount of base money is constant, the money supply will decrease as a consequence. Thornton and Bagehot, therefore, suggested that the lender of last resort should increase the money base to offset the reduction of the multiplier. That was meant to keep the money supply constant and prevent an economic contraction.

===Thornton&#x27;s foundations===
Thornton first published &quot;An Enquiry into the Nature and Effects of the Paper Credit of Great Britain&quot; in 1802. His starting point was that only a central bank could perform the task of lender of last resort because it holds a monopoly in issuing bank notes. Unlike any other bank, the central bank has a responsibility towards the public to keep the money supply constant, thereby preventing negative externalities of monetary instability,
such as unemployment, price instability, bank runs, and financial panic.

===Bagehot&#x27;s contribution===
Bagehot was the second important contributor to the classical theory.
In his book &quot;Lombard Street&quot; (1873), he mostly agreed with Thornton without ever mentioning him but also develops some new points and emphases. Bagehot advocates: &quot;Very large loans at very high rates are the best remedy for the worst malady of the money market when a foreign drain is added to a domestic drain.&quot; His main points can be summarized by his famous rule: lend &quot;it most freely... to merchants, to minor bankers, to &#x27;this and that man&#x27;, whenever the security is good&quot;.

===Summary of the classical theory===
Thomas M. Humphrey, who has done extensive research on Thornton&#x27;s and Bagehot&#x27;s works, summarizes their main proposals as follows: (1) protect the money supply instead of saving individual institutions; (2) rescue solvent institutions only; (3) let insolvent institutions default; (4) charge penalty rates; (5) require good collateral; and (6) announce the conditions before a crisis so that the market knows exactly what to expect.

Many of the points remain controversial today but it seems to be accepted that the Bank of England strictly followed these rules during the last third of the 19th century.

==Bank runs and contagion==
Most industrialized countries have had a lender of last resort for many years. Models explaining why propose that a bank run or bank panic can arise in any fractional reserve banking system and that the lender of last resort function is a way of preventing panics from happening. The Diamond and Dybvig model of bank runs has two Nash equilibria: one in which welfare is optimal and one where there is a bank run. The bank run equilibrium is an infamously self-fulfilling prophecy: if individuals expect a run to happen, it is rational for them to withdraw their deposits early: before they actually need it. That makes them lose some interest, but that is better than losing everything from a bank run.

In the Diamond–Dybvig model, introducing a lender of last resort can prevent bank runs from happening so that only the optimal equilibrium remains. That is because individuals are no longer afraid of a liquidity shortage and so have no incentive to withdraw early. The lender of last resort will never come into action because the mere promise is enough to provide the confidence necessary to prevent a panic.

Subsequently, the model has been extended to allow for financial contagion: the spreading of a panic from one bank to another, by Allen and Gale, and Freixas et al. respectively.

Allen and Gale introduced an interbank market into the Diamond–Dybvig model to study contagion of bank panics from one region to another. An interbank market is created by banks because it insures them against a lack of liquidity at certain banks as long as the overall amount of liquidity is sufficient. Liquidity is allocated by the interbank market so that banks that have excess liquidity can provide this to banks that lack liquidity. As long as the total demand for liquidity does not exceed the supply, the interbank market will allocate liquidity efficiently and banks will be better off. However, if demand exceeds supply, it can have disastrous consequences. The interregional cross-holdings of deposits cannot increase the total amount of liquidity. Thus, long-term assets have to be liquidated, which causes loss.

The degree of contagion depends on the interconnectedness of the banks in different regions. In an incomplete market (banks do not exchange deposits with all other banks), a high degree of interconnectedness causes contagion. Contagion is not caused if the market is either complete (banks have exchanged deposits with all other banks) or if the banks are little-connected. In Allen and Gale&#x27;s model, the role of the central bank is to complete the markets to prevent contagion.

Freixas et al.&#x27;s model is similar to the one by Allen and Gale, except that in Freixas et al.&#x27;s model, individuals face uncertainty about where they will need their money. There is a fraction of individuals (travelers) who need their money in a region other than home. Without a payment system, an individual has to withdraw his deposit early (when he finds out that he will need the money in a different place in the next period) and simply take the money along. That is inefficient because of the foregone interest payment. Banks therefore establish credit lines to allow individuals to withdraw their deposits in different regions. In the good equilibrium, welfare is increased just as in the Diamond–Dybvig model, but again there is a bank run equilibrium, too. It can arise if some individuals expect too many others to want to withdraw money in the same region in the next period. It is then rational to withdraw money early instead of not receiving any in the next period. It can happen even if all banks are solvent.

==Disputed matters==
There is no universal agreement on whether a nation&#x27;s central bank or any agent of private banking interests should be its lender of last resort. Nor is there on the pros and cons of actions such a lender takes and their consequences.

===Moral hazard===
Moral hazard has been an explicit concern in the context of the lender of last resort since the days of Thornton. It is argued, for example, that the existence of a LOLR facility leads to excessive risk-taking by both bankers and investors, which would be dampened if illiquid banks were allowed to fail. Therefore, the LOLR can alleviate current panics in exchange for increasing the likelihood of future panics by risk-taking induced by moral hazard.

That is exactly what the Report of the International Financial Institution Advisory Commission accuses the IMF of doing when it lends to emerging economies: &quot;By preventing or reducing losses by international lenders, the IMF had implicitly signalled that, if local banks and other institutions incurred large foreign liabilities and government guaranteed private debts, the IMF would provide the foreign exchange needed to honour the guarantees.&quot; Investors are protected against the downside of their investment and, at the same time, receive higher interest rates to compensate them for their risk. That encourages risk-taking and reduces the necessary diversification and led the Commission to conclude, &quot;The importance of the moral hazard problem cannot be overstated.&quot;

However, not having a lender of last resort for fear of moral hazard may have worse consequences than moral hazard itself. Consequently, many countries have a central bank that acts as lender of last resort. These countries then try to prevent moral hazard by other means such as suggested by Stern: &quot;official regulation; encouragement for private sector monitoring and self-regulation; and the imposition of costs on those who make mistakes, including enforcement of bankruptcy procedures when appropriate.&quot; Some authors also suggest that moral hazard should not be a concern of the lender of last resort. The task of preventing it should be given to a supervisor or regulator that limits the amount of risk that can be taken.

===Macro or micro responsibility===
Whether or not the lender of last resort has a responsibility for saving individual banks has been a very controversial topic. Does the lender of last resort provide liquidity to the market as a whole (through open market operations) or should it (also) make loans to individual banks (through discount window lending)?

There are two main views on this question, the money and the banking view: &quot;the money view&quot;, as argued, for example, by Goodfriend and King, and Capie, suggests, that the lender of last resort should provide liquidity to the market by open market operations only because it suffices to limit panics. What they call &quot;banking policy&quot; (discount window lending) may even be harmful because of moral hazard. &quot;The banking view&quot; finds that in reality the market does not allocate liquidity efficiently in times of crisis. Liquidity provided through open market operations is not efficiently distributed among banks in the interbank market, and there is a case for discount window lending. In a well-functioning interbank market only solvent banks can borrow. However, if the market is not functioning, even solvent banks may be unable to borrow, most likely because of asymmetric information.

A model developed by Flannery suggests that the private market for interbank loans can fail if banks face uncertainty about the risk involved in lending to other banks. In times of crisis with less certainty, however, discount window loans are the least costly way of solving the problem of uncertainty.

Rochet and Vives extend the traditional banking view to provide more evidence that interbank markets indeed do not function properly as Goodfriend and King had suggested. &quot;The main contribution of our paper so far has been to show the theoretical possibility of a solvent bank being illiquid, due to a coordination failure on the interbank market.&quot;

Goodhart proposes that only discount window lending should be considered lending of last resort. The reason is that central banks&#x27; open market operations cannot be separated from regular open market operations.

===Distinction between illiquid and insolvent===
According to Bagehot and, following him, many later writers the lender of last resort should not lend to insolvent banks. That is reasonable in particular because it would encourage moral hazard. The distinction seems logical and is helpful in theoretical models, but some authors find that in reality it is difficult to apply. Especially in times of crisis the distinction is difficult to make.

When an illiquid bank approaches the lender of last resort, there should always be a suspicion of insolvency. However, according to Goodhart, it is a myth that the central bank can evaluate that the suspicions are untrue under the usual constraints of time for arriving at a decision. Like Obstfeld he considers insolvency a possibility that arises with a certain amount of probability, not something that is certain.

===Penalty rate and collateral requirement===
Bagehot&#x27;s reasoning behind charging penalty rates (i.e. higher rates than are available in the market) was as follows: (1) it would really make the lender of last resort the very last resort and (2) it would encourage the prompt repayment of the debt.

Some authors suggest that charging a higher rate does not serve the purpose of the lender of last resort because a higher rate could make it too expensive for banks to borrow. Flannery and others mention that the Fed has neither asked for good collateral nor charged rates above the market, in recent years.

===Announcement in advance===
If the central bank announces in advance that it will act as lender of last resort in future crises, it can be understood as a credible promise and prevent bank panics. At the same time, it may increase moral hazard. While Bagehot emphasized that the benefit of the promise outweighs the costs, many central banks have intentionally &quot;not&quot; promised anything.

===Private alternatives===
Before the founding of the US Federal Reserve System as lender of last resort, its role had been assumed by private banks. Both the clearing-house system of New York and the Suffolk Bank of Boston had provided member banks with liquidity during crises. In the absence of a public solution a private alternative had developed. Advocates of the free banking view suggest that such examples show that there is no necessity for government intervention.

The Suffolk Bank acted as lender of last resort during the Panic of 1837–1839. Rolnick, Smith and Weber &quot;argue that the Suffolk Bank&#x27;s provision of note-clearing and lender of last resort services (via the Suffolk Banking System) lessened the effects of the Panic of 1837 in New England relative to the rest of the country, where no bank provided such services.&quot;

During the Panic of 1857, a policy committee of the New York Clearing House Association (NYCHA) allowed the issuance of the so-called clearing-house loan certificates. While their legality was controversial at the time, the idea of providing additional liquidity eventually led to a public provision of this service that was to be performed by the central bank, founded in 1913.

Some authors view the establishment of clearing-houses as proof that the lender of last resort does not have to be provided by the central bank. Bordo agrees that it does not have to be a central bank. However, historical experience (mainly Canada and US) suggested to him that it has to be a public authority and not a private clearing-house association that provides the service.

==Historical experience==
Miron, Bordo, Wood and Goodhart show that the existence of central banks has reduced the frequency of bank runs.

Miron uses data on the crises between 1890 and 1908 and compares it to the period of 1915 to 1933. That allows him to reject the hypothesis that after the new Federal Reserve acted as lender of last resort, the frequency of panics observed did not change. The conclusion of his discussion is that the &quot;effects of monetary policy... that anticipated open market operations by the Fed probably had real effects.&quot;

Bordo analyses historical data by Schwartz and Kindleberger to determine whether a lender of last resort can prevent or reduce the effect of a panic or crisis. Bordo finds that Britain&#x27;s last panic happened in 1866. Afterwards the Bank of England provided the necessary liquidity. According to Bordo, acting as a lender of last resort prevented panics in 1878, 1890, and 1914. Bordo concludes: &quot;Successful lender of last resort actions prevented panics on numerous occasions. On those occasions when panics were not prevented, either the requisite institutions did not exist, or the authorities did not understand the proper actions to take. Most countries developed an effective LLR mechanism by the last one-third of the nineteenth century. The U.S. was the principal exception. Some public authority must provide the lender of last resort function... Such an authority does not have to be a central bank. This is evident from the experience of Canada and other countries.&quot;

Wood compares the reaction of central banks to different crises in England, France, and Italy. When a lender of last resort existed, panics did not turn into crises. When the central bank failed to act, crises such as in France in 1848, however, happened. He concludes &quot;that LOLR action contains a crisis, while absence of such action allows a localized panic to turn into a widespread banking crisis.&quot; More recent examples are the crises in Argentina, Mexico and Southeastern Asia. There, central banks could not provide liquidity because banks had been borrowing in foreign currencies, which the central bank was unable to provide.

===Bank of England===
The Bank of England is often considered the model lender of last resort because it acted according to the classical rules of Thornton and Bagehot. &quot;Banking scholars agree that the Bank of England in the last third of the nineteenth century was the lender of last resort par excellence. More than any central bank before or since, it adhered to the strict classical or Thornton-Bagehot version of the LLR concept.&quot;

===Federal Reserve System===
The Federal Reserve System in the United States acts rather differently, and at least in some ways not in accordance with Bagehot&#x27;s advice. Norbert J. Michel, a financial researcher, goes as far as saying that the Federal Reserve made the Great Depression worse by failing to fulfil its role of lender of last resort, a view shared amongst others by Milton Friedman. Critics like Michel nevertheless applaud the Fed&#x27;s role as LLR in the crisis of 1987, and in that following 9/11, (though concerns about moral hazard resulting were certainly expressed at the time).

However, the Fed&#x27;s role during the financial crisis of 2007–2008 continues to polarise opinion. The classical economist Thomas M. Humphrey has identified several ways in which the modern Fed deviates from the traditional rules: (1) &quot;Emphasis on Credit (Loans) as Opposed to Money&quot;, (2) &quot;Taking Junk Collateral&quot;, (3) &quot;Charging Subsidy Rates&quot;, (4) &quot;Rescuing Insolvent Firms Too Big and Interconnected to Fail&quot;, (5) &quot;Extension of Loan Repayment Deadlines&quot;, (6) &quot;No Pre-announced Commitment&quot;.

Indeed, some say its lender of last resort policies have jeopardized its operational independence, and have put taxpayers at risk.

Mervyn King however has pointed out that 21st century banking (and hence the Fed as well) operate in a very different world from that of Bagehot, creating new problems for the LLR role Bagehot envisaged, highlighting especially the danger that haircuts on collateral, punitive rates, and the stigma of the deposit window can precipitate a bank run, or exacerbate a credit crunch: &quot;In extreme cases, the LOLR is the Judas kiss for banks forced to turn to the central bank for support&quot;. As a result, other strategies were called for, and were indeed pursued by the Fed. The historian Adam Tooze has stressed how the Fed&#x27;s new liquidity facilities mapped onto the various elements of the eviscerated shadow banking system, thereby replacing a systemic failure of credit as LLR, (a role morphing perhaps into that of a dealer of last resort). Tooze concluded that &quot;In its own terms, as a capitalist stabilization effort...the Fed was remarkably successful&quot;.

===ECB===
The European Central Bank arguably set itself up (controversially) as a conditional LOLR with its 2012 policy of Outright Monetary Transactions.

===Prussia/Imperial Germany===

In 1763, the king was the lender of last resort in Prussia; and in the 19th C., various official bodies, from the Prussian lottery to the Hamburg City Government, worked in consortia as LOLR. After unification, the financial crisis of 1873 forced the formation of the German Reichsbank (1876) to fulfil that role.

==International lender of last resort==
===Theory===
The matter of whether there is a need for an international lender of last resort is more controversial than for a domestic lender of last resort. Most authors agree that there is a need for a national lender of last resort and argue only about the specific set-up. There is, however, no agreement on the international level. There are mainly two opposing groups: one (Capie and Schwartz) says that an international lender of last resort (ILOLR) is technically impossible, while the other (Fischer, Obstfeld, Goodhardt and Huang) wants a modified International Monetary Fund (IMF) to assume this role.

Fischer argues that financial crises have become more interconnected, which requires an international lender of last resort because domestic lenders cannot create foreign currency. Fischer says this role can and should be taken by the IMF even if it is not a central bank, since it has the ability to provide credit to the market irrespective of being unable to create new money in any &quot;international currency&quot;. Fischer&#x27;s central argument, that the ability to create money is not a necessary attribute of the lender of last resort, is highly controversial, and both Capie and Schwartz argue the opposite.

Goodhart and Huang developed a model arguing &quot;the international contagious risk is much higher when there is an international interbank market than otherwise. Our analysis has indicated that an ILOLR can play a useful role in providing international liquidity and reducing such international contagion.&quot;

&quot;A lender-of-last-resort is what it is by virtue of the fact that it alone provides the ultimate means of payment. There is no international money and so there can be no international lender-of-last-resort.&quot; 
That is the most prominent argument put against the international lender of last resort. Besides this point (considered &quot;semantic&quot; by opposing authors), Capie and Schwartz provide arguments for why the IMF is not fit to be an international lender of last resort.

Schwartz explains that the lender of last resort is not the optimal solution to the crises of today, and the IMF cannot replace the necessary government agencies. Schwartz considers a domestic lender of last resort suitable to stabilize the international financial system, but the IMF lacks the properties necessary for the role of an international lender of last resort.

===Practice===
Tooze has argued that, during and since the credit crunch, the dollar has extended its reach as a global reserve currency; and suggests further that, at the height of the crisis, through the Central bank liquidity swap lines, the Fed &quot;assured the key players in the global system...there was one actor in the system that would cover marginal imbalances with an unlimited supply of dollar liquidity. That precisely was the role of the global lender of last resort&quot;. Concern as to whether the Fed is in a position to repeat its role as global LOLR is one of the forces behind calls for a formal global currency.

==In government bond markets==
Although the European Central Bank (ECB) has supplied large amounts of liquidity through both open market operations and lending to individual banks in 2008, it was hesitant to supply liquidity during the sovereign crisis of 2010. According to Paul De Grauwe, the ECB should be the lender of last resort in the government bond market and supply liquidity to its member countries just as it does to the financial sector. That is because the reasons that the lender of last resort is necessary in the banking sector can be applied to the government bond market analogously. Just like banks that lend long-term while borrowing short-term, governments have highly illiquid assets like infrastructure and maturing debt. If they do not succeed in rolling over their debt, they become illiquid just as banks that run out of liquidity and are not supported by a lender of last resort. The distrust of investors can then increase the rates the government has to pay on its debt, which, in a self-fulfilling way, leads to a solvency crisis. Because banks hold the greatest proportion of government debt, not saving the government may make it necessary to save the banks, in turn. &quot;The single most important argument for mandating the ECB to be a lender of last resort in the government bond markets is to prevent countries from being pushed into a bad equilibrium.&quot;

Arguments put forth against a lender of last resort in the government bond market are the following: (1) inflation risk from an increase in the money supply; (2) losses to taxpayers because in the end they bear the losses of the ECB; (3) moral hazard: governments have an incentive to take more risk; (4) Bagehot&#x27;s rule of not lending to insolvent institutions; and (5) violation of the statutes of the ECB, which do not allow the ECB to buy government bonds directly.

According to De Grauwe, none of the arguments is valid for the following reason: (1) The money supply does not necessarily increase if the money base is increased. (2) All open market operations generate taxpayer risk, and if the lender of last resort is successful in preventing countries from moving into the bad equilibrium, it will not suffer any losses. (3) The risk of moral hazard is identical to the moral hazard in the financial market and should be overcome by risk-limiting regulation. (4) If the distinction between illiquid and insolvent were possible, the market would not need the support of the lender of last resort, but in practice, the distinction cannot be made. (5) While Article 21 of the treaty prohibits buying debt from national governments directly because it &quot;implies a monetary financing of the government budget deficit&quot;, Article 18 allows the ECB to buy and sell &quot;marketable instruments&quot;, and government bonds are marketable instruments. Finally, De Grauwe asserts that only the central bank itself has the necessary credibility to act as a lender of last resort and so it should replace the European Financial Stability Facility (and its successor, the European Stability Mechanism). The two institutions cannot guarantee that they will always possess enough liquidity or &quot;fire power&quot; to buy debt from sovereign bond holders.

<doc id="921279" wikidata="Q622757" url="?curid=921279" title="1904 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1904 Summer Olympics were held in St. Louis, Missouri, United States from July 1 to November 23, 1904, as part of the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair. 

A total of 651 athletes from 12 nations participated in 95 events in 16 sports at these games.

Nine participating nations earned medals, in addition to four medals won by mixed teams. In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations. Retroactively, the IOC created the designation &quot;mixed team&quot; (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these groups of athletes. Some athletes won medals both individually and as part of a mixed team, so these medals are tabulated under different nations in the official counts.

The United States won 231 medals, setting a record that still stands today. The Soviet Union came closest to beating the record with 195 medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics and currently is in second place. The Soviets, however, won a record 80 gold medals, surpassing 76 golds won by the Americans in 1904. However, the United States subsequently won 83 gold medals in the 1984 Summer Olympics, setting another all-time record. Gold medals were awarded to event winners for the first time at the 1904 games. Prior to that, a silver medal was awarded to first-place finishers and a bronze medal to second-place finishers.

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<text>Pierre Mignard or Pierre Mignard I (; 17 November 1612 – 30 May 1695), called &quot;Mignard le Romain&quot; to distinguish him from his brother Nicolas Mignard, was a French painter known for his religious and mythological scenes and portraits. He was a near-contemporary of the Premier Peintre du Roi Charles Le Brun with whom he engaged in a bitter, life-long rivalry.

==Life==

Pierre Mignard was born at Troyes in 1612 as the son of Pierre and Marie Gallois. He came from a family of artisans. He was the younger brother of Nicolas, who became a painter and etcher who was mainly active in Avignon and was known as Mignard d&#x27;Avignon. Nicolas had two sons, Paul who became a painter and etcher and Pierre who became a painter and architect. To distinguish his nephew Pierre from his uncle, the nephew was called &quot;Pierre II&quot; or &quot;Le Chevalier&quot;.
Pierre Mignard trained in Bourges with the Mannerist painter Jean Boucher. He later spent time making copies of the Mannerist works in the château of Fontainebleau. He then studied for a period in the studio of Simon Vouet. Mignard left for Rome in 1635 where he would stay about 22 years. It is because of his long residence in Rome that he got the nickname &#x27;Mignard le Romaine&#x27;.

In Rome he painted religious commissions. He was particularly known for his many images of the Madonna and Child. They were so popular that they were referred to as &quot;Mignardises.&quot; He also painted altarpieces. Compatriot Nicolas Poussin hired Mignard to make copies of his works. He was also active as a reproductive engraver making copies after Annibale Carracci. Mignard also developed his lifelong interest in portraiture at this time, and he painted portraits of subsequent popes, cardinals, and prominent members of the Italian nobility. He also travelled to Northern Italy where he visited Bologna, Parma, Mantua, Florence and Venice. 
His reputation was such that he was summoned to Paris in 1657, probably by Cardinal Mazarin. He travelled back via Avignon where his brother Nicolas worked. Here he met the dramatist Molière, who became a close friend and of whom he painted several portraits. In Paris he became a popular portrait painter. He found favor with king Louis XIV who sat for many portraits. Mignard became a rival of the leading French painter of that time and first painter to the King, Charles Le Brun. He refused to enter the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture while Le Brun was its director and instead became head of a rival guild. Following Le Brun&#x27;s death in 1690, Mignard succeeded him as both director of the academy and premier peintre du Roi. His brother Nicolas and his nephew Paul, who was his pupil, had chosen the side of Le Brun against Mignard, which led to a break in their relationship. Mignard died five years later in 1695 in Paris as he was about to begin work on the cupola of Les Invalides.
==Work==
Mignard was mainly active as a portrait painter. He also produced mythological and religious scenes.

Soon after his return to Paris, Mignard was able to attract the patronage of important personalities who commissioned portraits of him. His sitters included Turenne, Molière, Bossuet, Maintenon (in the Louvre), La Vallière, Sévigné, Montespan, Descartes (in Castle Howard). He was thus one of the most successful portrait painters of his time although according to some art historians also the most boring one.
Many of compositions were engraved by Gérard Audran, Pieter van Schuppen, Robert Nanteuil, Gérard Edelinck, Antoine Masson, François de Poilly and others.

There is a good selection of works by Pierre, Nicolas, and Pierre II in Avignon at the Musée Calvet. The Courtauld Institute of Art (London), Harvard University Art Museums, the Hermitage Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, Kunst Indeks Danmark, the Louvre, Musée d&#x27;Art et d&#x27;Histoire (Geneva), Musée des Augustins (Toulouse, France), Musée Ingres (Montauban, France), Museo Lombardi (Parma, Italy), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the National Gallery, London, the National Portrait Gallery, London, the North Carolina Museum of Art, the Portland Art Museum and Versailles are among the public collections holding works by Pierre Mignard.

<text>The 1900 Summer Olympics, now officially known as the Games of the II Olympiad, were an international multi-sport event held in Paris, France, from May 14 to October 28, 1900, as part of the 1900 World&#x27;s Fair. A total of 1,226 athletes representing 26 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 95 events in 19 sports. Archery, Basque pelota, cricket, croquet, equestrian jumping, football, golf, polo, rugby union, rowing, sailing, tug of war, and water polo were contested for the first time at these Games. Women competed in the Olympics for the first time during the 1900 games. Athletes representing 19 NOCs received at least one medal. France won the most of every type of medal, while the United States won the second-most of every type of medal. Spain, Cuba, the Netherlands, Italy, and Belgium all won their nation&#x27;s first Olympic gold medals. Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Cuba, Spain, Norway, India, Bohemia, and Sweden all won their nation&#x27;s first Olympic medals of any kind.

In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations. During the 1900 games, athletes participating in mixed teams won medals in football, polo, rowing, tennis, and tug of war.

The 1900 Olympics is unique in being the only Olympic Games to feature rectangular medals, which were designed by . Gilt silver medals were awarded for first place in shooting, lifesaving, motor racing, and gymnastics, while second place silver medals were awarded in shooting, rowing, sailing, tennis, gymnastics, fencing, equestrian, and athletics. Third place bronze medals were awarded in gymnastics, firefighting, and shooting. However, in many sports, medals were not awarded, with most of the listed prizes being cups and other similar trophies. The International Olympic Committee has retrospectively assigned gold, silver, and bronze medals to competitors who earned first, second, and third place finishes in order to bring early Olympics in line with current awards. Alvin Kraenzlein won four gold medals at the 1900 Summer Olympics, the most of any competing athlete.

== Awards ==
Prizes worth a total of 953,448 francs were awarded to the athletes across the competitions. Various cash prizes and art objects were awarded to the athletes. In addition, medals and plaques were distributed, including the sports plaque designed by Frédéric de Vernon, available in gilt silver, silver, or bronze. Produced by Monnaie de Paris, the medal features two sides. On the front, a winged goddess holds laurel branches high above her head, with Paris and the grand monuments of the Universal Exhibition visible in the background. On the reverse, a victorious athlete stands proudly on a podium, raising a laurel branch in his right hand. Behind him, a stadium and the Acropolis of Athens serve as a reminder of the deep connection between ancient and modern Olympic traditions.

==Medal count==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. &lt;onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="921294" wikidata="Q209504" url="?curid=921294" title="1896 Summer Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1896 Summer Olympics, officially known as the Games of the I Olympiad, were a summer multi-sport event held in Athens, the capital of Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896, and were the first Olympic Games of the Modern era.

A total of 241 athletes from 14 nations participated in 43 events in nine sports at these games.

Ten of the fourteen participating nations earned medals, in addition to three medals won by mixed teams, i.e. teams made up of athletes from multiple nations. The United States won the most gold medals (11) with 14 athletes participating, while host nation, Greece with 169 athletes participating, won the most medals overall (47) as well as the most silver (18) and bronze (19) medals, finishing with one less gold medal than the United States, having 155 athletes more than the U.S.

==Background and rules==
In the early Olympic Games, several team events were contested by athletes from multiple nations. Retroactively, the IOC created the designation &quot;Mixed team&quot; (with the country code ZZX) to refer to these group of athletes.
Some athletes won medals both individually and as part of a mixed team, so these medals are tabulated under different nations in the official counts. Dionysios Kasdaglis, an athlete of Greek origins living in Alexandria, Egypt, is listed by the IOC as Greek during both his competition in the singles tennis competition and the doubles tennis competition along with his teammate, the Greek athlete Demetrios Petrokokkinos.

During these inaugural Olympics, winners were given a silver medal and an olive branch, while runners-up received a copper medal and a laurel branch. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in each event to comport with more recent traditions.

Three ties resulted in medals being shared between athletes, increasing the medal count of various nations. These include ties between Francis Lane of the United States and Alajos Szokolyi of Hungary, for the third place in the 100 metres, and between Evangelos Damaskos and Ioannis Theodoropoulos of Greece in the pole vault, and well as bronze medals awarded to both losing semi-finalists, Konstantinos Paspatis of Greece and Momcsilló Tapavicza of Hungary, in singles tennis. In addition, five of the bronze medalists at the Games are unknown – two in swimming and three in gymnastics – and a number of events had no third-place finisher.

==Medal count==
This is the full table of the medal count of the 1896 Summer Olympics, based on the medal count of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). There are sources, besides the International Olympic Committee (IOC), that display variations in the medal totals, but as the governing body of the Olympic Games, the IOC is considered the most authoritative source for the purposes of this article. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This information is provided by the IOC; however, the IOC does not recognise or endorse any ranking system.

<text>Thomas Rolfe (January 30, 1615 – ) was the only child of Pocahontas and her English husband, John Rolfe. His maternal grandfather was Chief Powhatan, the leader of the Powhatan tribe in Virginia.

==Early life==
Thomas Rolfe was born in the English colony of Virginia to John Rolfe and his wife, Pocahontas, in January 1615. It is believed he was born at the Rolfe family plantation, Varina, in what was then the corporation of James Cittie. Rolfe&#x27;s birth was recorded as the first time a child was born to a Native American woman and a European man in the history of Virginia. In 1616 John Rolfe and Pocahontas accompanied Governor Sir Thomas Dale on a trip to England to promote the Colony of Virginia, they sailed aboard the &quot;Treasurer&quot; captained by Samuel Argall, arriving at Plymouth, England on 12 June 1616. Less than two years of age, Thomas Rolfe accompanied his parents on this voyage.

In March 1617, the Rolfe family had boarded ship, preparing to set sail back to Virginia, when Pocahontas was taken seriously ill and died. They disembarked at Gravesend in Kent, where Pocahontas was buried. Thomas was sick as well, and fearing he would not survive the sea journey home, John Rolfe appointed Sir Lewis Stukley as his guardian on 21 March 1617. Grieving for his wife and worried for the life of his son, John Rolfe was persuaded by Admiral Argall and other members of the party to continue the voyage. Father and son would never see each other again. John Rolfe, Tomocomo, the governor and other surviving Native Americans returned to Virginia. Stuckley later transferred custody and care of Thomas Rolfe to his uncle, Henry Rolfe.

After returning to Virginia, John Rolfe married a third time, to Jane Pierce, and gave Thomas a younger half-sister, Elizabeth.

John Rolfe wrote his will on March 10, 1622 and died not long after that. In his will John appointed his father in law, William Peirce, as executor of his estate and guardian of his 2 children, Thomas and Elizabeth.

In October 1622, Henry Rolfe petitioned the Council of Virginia, claiming entitlement to a portion of John Rolfe&#x27;s land for maintenance of Thomas Rolfe. Thomas remained in his uncle&#x27;s care until he reached roughly 21 years of age. Sometime before June 1635 Thomas returned to Virginia, his transportation paid for by his Virginia guardian and grandfather by marriage, William Pierce. This is known with certainty because Pierce patented land on June 22, 1635, claiming headright for the transportation of 40 individuals, including Thomas Rolfe. There is no further mention of his whereabouts or doings until 1641.

Once established in Virginia again, Thomas Rolfe fostered both his reputation as a plantation owner and member of his mother&#x27;s lineage.

==Family==
As Rolfe was a child of a white settler and a Native American woman, some aspects of his life were particularly controversial. He expressed interest in rekindling relations with his Native American relatives, despite societal ridicule and colonial laws that forbade such contact. In 1641, Rolfe petitioned the governor for permission to visit his &quot;aunt, Cleopatra, and his kinsman Opecanaugh&quot;.

Rolfe married Jane Poythress, the daughter of Captain Francis Poythress, a prosperous landowner in Virginia. Their daughter, Jane Rolfe, was born at Varina Plantation, Charles City County, Virginia, on October 10, 1650. There is no record of any other children, and no record of any other marriages for Thomas Rolfe.

==Land==
According to his father&#x27;s will, both Thomas and Elizabeth, his half-sister, received named land. There is no extant proof that some land came from the Native Americans. However Native Americans did not have the same concept of land ownership as the white settlers. There is no mention of former Native American land in John Rolfe&#x27;s will; however, John Rolfe names Thomas as the rightful heir of all his land, profits and any royalties pertaining to such land.
There were rumors in 1618 that when Thomas came of age, he would inherit a sizable portion of Powhatan territory; this information was transmitted through Argall to London, stating, &quot;&#x27;Opechanano and the Natives have given their Country to Rolfe&#x27;s Child and that they will reserve it from all others till he comes of yeares...&quot; (Mossiker). There is no extant documentation that when Thomas arrived in Virginia in 1640, the land was recorded as &quot;Varina,&quot; his patrimonial property sixteen miles below Richmond.

Thomas&#x27;s step-grandfather, named Captain William Peirce, received a grant of 2000 acres of land on June 22, 1635, for the &quot;transportation of 40 persons among whom was Thomas Rolfe&quot;. He then listed Thomas as heir to his father&#x27;s land. Prior to March 1640, Thomas took possession of this land which was located on the lower side of the James River.

Thomas also inherited a tract of some 150 acres on June 10, 1654, in Surry County, across from Jamestown; the land was described in a later deed as &quot;Smith&#x27;s Fort old field and the Devil&#x27;s Woodyard swamp being due unto the said Rolfe by Gift from the Indian King&quot;.

The year after the 1644 Native American attack on the colony, four forts were established to defend the frontier: Fort Henry, Fort Royal, Fort James, and Fort Charles. Fort James was to be under the command of Thomas Rolfe as lieutenant as of October 5, 1646. He was given six men, and was instructed to fight against the Native Americans—his own people;

Then, on October 6, 1646, Thomas was put in charge of building a fort at Moysonec, for which he received of land. This fort was located on the west side of Diascund Creek.

Several years later, Rolfe patented 525 acres on August 8, 1653, &quot;...lying upon the North side of Chickahominy river commonly called and known by the name of James fort...&quot;, apparently including the 400 acres he had received in 1646. This James Fort land was re patented by William Browne on April 23, 1681. The tract was described in the patent as &quot;formerly belonging to Mr Thomas Rolfe, dec&#x27;d&quot;, thus establishing that Rolfe had died before that date.

==Death==
The last recorded mention of Thomas Rolfe exists in a land patent from September 16, 1658. While some sources claim that Thomas died in 1680, others claim that the exact year is unknown. Some evidence purports that Thomas Rolfe died in James City County, Virginia; however the records of the county were destroyed in 1685 during a fire.

==Legacy==

Rolfe&#x27;s daughter, Jane Rolfe, married Robert Bolling of Prince George County, Virginia; the couple&#x27;s son, John Bolling, was born on January 27, 1676. Jane Rolfe is said to have died shortly after giving birth. John Bolling married Mary Kennon, daughter of Richard Kennon and Elizabeth Worsham of Conjurer&#x27;s Neck. John and Mary Bolling had six surviving children, each of whom married and had surviving children.

The Sedgeford Hall Portrait, now in King&#x27;s Lynn Town Hall, once believed to represent Pocahontas and her son Thomas Rolfe, has been re-identified as being Pe-o-ka, wife of the Seminole leader Osceola, and their son.

The birth of Thomas Rolfe, as he was both of European and Native American descent, reinstated peace between the Powhatans and the European settlements. Early in his career as deputy governor, Argall reported in a letter published within the Virginia Company Records that Powhatan &quot;goes from place to place visiting his country taking his pleasure in good friendship with us laments his daughter&#x27;s death but glad her child is living so doth Opachank&quot;.

Thomas Rolfe is the eleventh-great-grandfather of actor, Edward Norton.

<doc id="921301" wikidata="Q178094" url="?curid=921301" title="The Notorious Bettie Page">
<text>The Notorious Bettie Page is a 2005 American biographical drama film directed by Mary Harron. The screenplay by Harron and Guinevere Turner focuses on 1950s pinup and bondage model Bettie Page, portrayed by Gretchen Mol.

==Plot==
Bettie Page is an ambitious, naïve, and devout young Christian woman who longs to leave Nashville, Tennessee, following a childhood of sexual abuse, a failed wartime marriage, and a gang rape. In 1949, she departs for New York City, where she enrolls in an acting class. Amateur photographer Jerry Tibbs discovers her walking on the beach at Coney Island and she agrees to model for him. He suggests she restyle her hair with the bangs that would become her trademark.

Bettie becomes a favorite of nature photographers (including Bunny Yeager, who films her posing with two leopards), and she has no hesitation about removing her clothes for the photographers when asked. Before long images of the shapely brunette reach brother-and-sister entrepreneurs Paula and Irving Klaw, who run a respectable business selling movie stills and memorabilia, but also deal with fetish photos, magazines, and 8- and 16-millimeter films for additional income. Their top model Maxie takes Bettie under her wing, and she soon finds herself wearing leather corsets and thigh-high boots while wielding whips and chains for photographer John Willie, frequently at the request of Little John, a mild-mannered attorney with unusual tastes. Bettie is innocently unaware of the sexual nature of the images that rapidly are making her a star in the underground world of bondage aficionados.

In 1955, Bettie is called to testify before a hearing, headed by Senator Estes Kefauver, investigating the effects of pornography on American youth. Though she waits patiently for 12 hours to answer the committee&#x27;s questions, Kefauver, for reasons unknown, decides to not bring her before the committee and dismisses her without an explanation. When it becomes apparent that casting directors are more interested in her notoriety than in any acting talent she might possess, Bettie heads to Miami Beach. Drifting along with limited career prospects and a virtually nonexistent social life, she stumbles upon a small evangelical church, walks inside and rushes forward to embrace Jesus Christ during the altar call. Although she insists she is not ashamed of anything she has done in her life, she appears happy to leave her past behind and return to her spiritual roots by preaching the word of the Lord on street corners.

In New York, Irving is highly stressed and suffering from poor health. He decides that he and his sister must burn their vast collection of erotic photos and movie footage to avoid potential prosecution. Paula reluctantly complies with her brother&#x27;s request, but secretly saves the negatives of many of Bettie&#x27;s pictures and movies from the bonfire, thereby ensuring that Bettie&#x27;s work will survive for future generations.

==Cast==
==Production==
In &quot;An Inside Look at the Pin-Up Queen of the Universe&quot;, a bonus feature on the DVD release of the film, producer Pamela Koffler and screenwriter/director Mary Harron discuss their decision to film most of the movie in black-and-white, which they felt not only perfectly captured the nostalgic mood of the period but also had a psychological impact on the audience. While writing the script, Harron knew she wanted to film the Miami scenes in color in order to provide a sharp contrast between Bettie&#x27;s professional life and the escape she ultimately made from it. Cinematographer W. Mott Hupfel III used old color stock to approximate the cheerfully vivid hues of Technicolor common in 1950s films.

Actress/screenwriter Guinevere Turner, who co-wrote the film with Mary Harron, was originally slated to star as Bettie Page but the role was given to Gretchen Mol when producers had difficulty raising money. Harron said from Mol&#x27;s first audition, she was her first choice for the role. Harron said, &quot;Emotionally, she was so right. She has a natural sort of decorum. So many people made the mistake of being very vampy. At that point, I said, &#x27;Well, you know, it&#x27;s more important to get the inner Bettie than the outer Bettie.&#x27;&quot;

==Release==
The film premiered at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival and was shown at the Berlin International Film Festival and the South by Southwest Film Festival before going into limited release in the United States on April 14, 2006. Opening on twenty screens, it grossed $143,131 in its opening weekend. It eventually earned $1,415,082 in the United States and $362,924 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $1,778,006.

The film was released on DVD in the United States on September 26, 2006.

===Critical reception===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 58% based on 134 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;This biopic only skims the surface of Bettie Page&#x27;s life, leaving her as a cipher, and additionally fails to place her iconic status in historical context.&quot; Metacritic, with uses a weighted average, gave the film a score of 64/100 based on 38 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews.

Manohla Dargis of &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Until now, Ms. Mol has been best known for her premature designation several years ago as Hollywood&#x27;s newest It girl. The label seemed to plague her, and she all but faded from view despite promising turns in little-seen films. Maybe because she felt protected by her female director and female producers (six out of seven), or emboldened by the material, or maybe because she knows how beautiful her gently padded silhouette looks in the raw, Ms. Mol takes to this tricky role with the carefree expressivity you tend to see only in young children who have learned the joys of nudity, usually when their parents are throwing a dinner party. When she strips, Bettie soars&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; said &quot;The tone of the movie is subdued and reflective. It does not defend pornography, but regards it (in its 1950s incarnation) with subdued nostalgia for a more innocent time. There is a kind of sadness in the movie as we reflect that most of these women and the men they inflamed are now dead; their lust is like an old forgotten song&quot;.

Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated the film &quot;floats on the charm and the labors of its lead actress, Gretchen Mol, who single-handedly makes the picture worth seeing. She takes a character that is next door to a cipher and infuses her with innocence and mischief, wit and feeling, despite limited help from the script. Perhaps through intuition or through some careful study of Page&#x27;s pinups, Mol has discovered a human being to play, and in the process has found her best screen showcase to date&quot;. Of Harron and Turner he said &quot;They tell Page&#x27;s story in a curiously uninflected way, revealing little, if any, point of view, and imposing no meaning or particular importance on this woman&#x27;s life. This approach is far from a recipe for high drama, but it has the integrity of accuracy. The audience is introduced to Bettie because the audience is perhaps interested in Bettie or her career or her era. But there&#x27;s no pretending that her life was all that fascinating, or that her contribution to culture was significant, or that her story contains a lesson worth receiving... There&#x27;s enough here for a good after-movie argument, and that&#x27;s more than can be said for most pictures&quot;.

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated the film three out of four stars and commented &quot;Any old sleaze could turn Bettie&#x27;s life into a kinky S&amp;M wallow, a cinematic stroke book. Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with that. It&#x27;s just that director Mary Harron, who co-wrote the scrappy script with Guinevere Turner, doesn&#x27;t do the expected. She&#x27;s too sly for that, too subversively funny... [She] needed just the right actress to play Bettie. And she lucked out big time. Gretchen Mol is hot stuff in every sense of the term. She delivers the first performance by an actress this year that deserves serious Oscar consideration&quot;.

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a superficial look at the &#x27;50s sex icon [that] feels like it was researched via press clippings rather than attempting a fresh rethinking of its era and provocative subject&quot;. He added &quot;Mary Harron&#x27;s work here seems curiously uninvolved. There&#x27;s no sense of any particular commitment to the leading character... [The] result is a strangely placid, unchallenging picture with no blood in its veins... Gretchen Mol is splendid to behold in every stage of dress or undress, but Harron and co-scenarist Guinevere Turner offer no clues as to what might be going on inside the dark-haired beauty&#x27;s head and heart... Mol&#x27;s Bettie is compliant, almost always open to any request and never disagreeable. But her lack of spine and inner turmoil make her a central figure of limited interest, that rare dramatic heroine with no ambition or goal&quot;.

==Accolades==
Mol was nominated for the Satellite Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Drama, but lost to Helen Mirren in &quot;The Queen.&quot;

<doc id="921302" wikidata="Q434751" url="?curid=921302" title="2002 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 2002 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIX Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Salt Lake City, Utah, United States, from February 8 to 24, 2002. A total of 2,399 athletes from 77 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+5 from 1998 Olympics) participated in these Games, competing in 78 events (+10 from 1998) in 15 sports and disciplines (+1 from 1998).

Athletes from 24 countries won at least one medal. Germany led in overall medals (36) for the second consecutive Winter Games. Immediately following the Games, Germany was also the gold medal leader with twelve. With 36 total medals, Germany set a record for most total medals at a single Winter Olympics edition. Two years later, however, Norway was awarded two extra gold medals for a single event (where two Norwegians tied) after medal re-allocations, raising their total to thirteen and giving them the lead in gold medals (albeit not in the number of won events). In addition, Norway tied the former Soviet Union in 1976 for most gold medals at a single Winter Olympics. This record would later be broken by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics. The hosting United States was third in the medal table on both counts with a total of 34 medals.

Croatia and Estonia won the first medals and first gold medals in their Winter Olympic history, while Australia and China won their first gold medals. Biathlete Ole Einar Bjørndalen of Norway won four gold medals, while Croatian alpine skier Janica Kostelić won three golds and a silver, making them the two athletes with the most medals at the Games.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

===Note===
 Norway won 12 events (like Germany) but collected two gold medals for a tie in a single event (the 10 km + 10 km combined pursuit), resulting in a total of 13 gold medals.

==Changes in medal standings==

Due to various events, two extra gold medals were awarded. In the figure skating pairs competition, Yelena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia were originally awarded the gold over Jamie Salé and David Pelletier of Canada. In the ensuing controversy, it was revealed that French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne had been pressured into voting for the Russians. Salé and Pelletier were later upgraded to gold, while Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze also kept their gold medals. In the cross-country skiing 30 km race, Norwegians Thomas Alsgaard and Frode Estil originally tied for a silver medal behind Spain&#x27;s Johann Muehlegg. Muehlegg had won three gold medals but tested positive for darbepoetin after winning his third. He was originally allowed to keep the other two gold medals, but two years later was stripped of all medals by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.

In women&#x27;s cross-country skiing, Larisa Lazutina of Russia originally won gold in the 30 km race, but tested positive for darbepoetin and was stripped of her medal, so Gabriella Paruzzi of Italy was awarded the gold, Italian Stefania Belmondo received the silver and Norwegian Bente Skari the bronze. Lazutina won two more medals, and was allowed to keep them until 2003 when she was stripped of them by the Court of Arbitration for sport. She also lost a silver medal in the 15 km race. In the 10 km pursuit, she was stripped of a silver, so Beckie Scott of Canada was promoted to the silver and Kateřina Neumannová of the Czech Republic the bronze. The gold medal in that race was won by Olga Danilova of Russia but she also tested positive for darbepoetin and in 2004, Scott was upgraded to gold, Neumannova to silver and Viola Bauer of Germany to bronze.

In the 10 km + 10 km combined pursuit, Frode Estil tied with fellow Norwegian Thomas Alsgaard for second place, with Johann Mühlegg (starting for Spain) winning the race. However, Mühlegg was found guilty of doping and disqualified by the IOC in February 2004, therefore upgrading Estil and Alsgaard to joint gold medalists. Alsgaard and Estil clocked times of 49:48.9, 4 seconds ahead of Per Elofsson. Both Germany and Norway won 12 events, but Norway collected two gold medals for a single event, thus overtaking Germany, which had been considered the 2002 medal tally winner for two years.

<text>William Hall Bush (born October 17, 1971) is an American radio and television host. He is a member of the Bush family, a nephew of former President George H. W. Bush and cousin of former President George W. Bush and former Florida governor Jeb Bush.

After appearing as a correspondent on &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; from 2001 to 2004, Bush became a primary anchor of the program in 2004. Bush also hosted &quot;The Billy Bush Show&quot;, a nationally syndicated talk and music radio show that aired from 2008 to 2014. He departed &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; in 2016 after being named a co-host in the third hour of &quot;Today&quot;. Bush&#x27;s tenure on the Today Show was short-lived, as in October 2016, during the presidential election, he became the subject of controversy when the 2005 &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; recording surfaced of him and presidential candidate Donald Trump having a lewd conversation. Due to this incident, Bush was fired from &quot;Today&quot;. Since 2019, Bush has been the host of the syndicated newsmagazine TV show &quot;Extra&quot;, a year after the series moved from NBC to Fox.
==Early life==
Bush was born in Manhattan, New York, to Jonathan Bush, a banker, and Josephine Colwell Bush (née Bradley). He has one older brother, Jonathan S. Bush. William Bush&#x27;s uncle (his father&#x27;s older brother) was George H. W. Bush, the 41st President of the United States. George W. Bush, the 43rd President, and former Florida governor Jeb Bush are William Bush&#x27;s first cousins.

Bush attended middle school at St. Bernard&#x27;s School in Manhattan and high school at St. George&#x27;s School in Middletown, Rhode Island. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in international studies and government from Colby College in 1993. He was also a four-year letterman and a two-time co-captain as a junior and senior with the Mules&#x27; men&#x27;s lacrosse team. As of 2017, he is 4th (182), 8th (97), and 4th (85) in career points, goals and assists respectively in program history and was a first-team All-NESCAC in 1994.

==Career==
===&quot;FM radio&quot;===
Bush began his career hosting the afternoon drive show on WLKZ-FM in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, later moving to Washington, D.C., where he hosted the midday show on WARW-FM. In March 1997, Bush joined WWZZ-FM (Z104) in D.C. as host of &quot;Billy Bush and the Bush League Morning Show&quot;, which aired until January 2001.

===Early television work===
In January 2003, Bush hosted a short-lived NBC prime-time version of &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;. He was also a correspondent for WNBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Today in New York&quot; morning show.

Bush joined &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, a daily entertainment news magazine, as East Coast correspondent in December 2001. He was promoted to co-anchor in June 2004.

While working at &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, he was present at high-profile red carpet events including the Golden Globes, Grammys, and Academy Awards, and hosted ABC&#x27;s live pre-show for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 Academy Awards and the &quot;2006 Emmy Red Carpet Special&quot;.

Bush was a reporter for NBC at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, and was the host for &quot;Access Hollywood&#x27;s&quot; coverage of the 2006 Winter Olympics in Torino as well as the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. In addition, Bush hosted the reality competition &quot;&quot; on NBC in 2007, and stood in for Meredith Vieira for a week of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; shows on April 21–25, 2008. He and Vieira both had credited cameos as hosts of fictional game shows in the 2004 remake of Ira Levin&#x27;s 1972 satirical thriller &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot;.

He returned to radio with &quot;The Billy Bush Show&quot;, a nightly talk radio and entertainment interview show. It airs from KBIG in Los Angeles and is syndicated by Westwood One. The show is written by Ryan Miller and produced by Corrin Barlow, while Bush and &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; executive producer Rob Silverstein are the show&#x27;s executive producers. The show, which airs evenings Monday through Friday, focuses on the top entertainment stories and personalities in the news, and features celebrity guests and listener calls.

Bush co-hosted the Miss Universe pageant four times: in 2003 and 2004 with Daisy Fuentes; in 2005 with fellow &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; co-anchor Nancy O&#x27;Dell; and in 2009 with Claudia Jordan. He has also co-hosted the Miss USA pageant four times, with almost the same partners: in 2003 with Fuentes; 2004 and 2005 with O&#x27;Dell; and again in 2009, this time with Nadine Velazquez. After the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards of 2008 were cancelled as a result of the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike, Bush co-hosted the 65th Annual Golden Globe Awards Announcement press conference with O&#x27;Dell on January 13, 2008.

Bush was named one of &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;10 Men&quot; in July 2005. &quot;He&#x27;s a furious, inventive interviewer, unafraid of playing the fool in exchange for a true reaction&quot;, opined the writer of the accompanying magazine profile.

From September 13, 2010, to October 2016, Bush co-hosted the syndicated national daily entertainment talk show &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot;, along with co-host Kit Hoover. This show is a sister show of &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, with host chat of popular topics and celebrity live interviews. Bush and Hoover traveled together to the UK to cover Prince William&#x27;s wedding to Catherine Middleton, as part of the NBC team coverage.

Bush played the drill sergeant in the 2010 film &quot;Furry Vengeance&quot; and had a small role as the voice of a newscaster in the 2014 Disney animated film &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;. He has also had several appearances on television shows including &quot;30 Rock&quot; and &quot;Donny!&quot;.

===&quot;Today&quot;===
In May 2016, Bush was selected to be the co-host of the third hour of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;. He served as a replacement for Willie Geist.

====Ryan Lochte controversy====
Bush was the first reporter to interview American Olympic swimmer Ryan Lochte after the athlete claimed he was robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro during the 2016 Summer Olympics. Bush&#x27;s due diligence as an interviewer was scrutinized after critics claimed Bush did not ask questions that would have shown Lochte&#x27;s story was fabricated. When details of Lochte&#x27;s story began to fall apart, Matt Lauer re-interviewed the swimmer in a move that was seen as a snub to Bush. Bush garnered attention once again after he and Al Roker got into an argument during Olympic coverage on &quot;Today&quot; after Lochte was exposed. Bush defended Lochte, saying he lied about &quot;some&quot; details whereas Roker characterized Lochte&#x27;s statement as a lie.

====Trump tape scandal====

On October 7, 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that video footage was released of Donald Trump having a lewd conversation with Bush, with Trump either unaware or unconcerned that his microphone was active. Bush is heard laughing about Trump&#x27;s failed effort to seduce a married woman, and joining in by commenting on actress Arianne Zucker&#x27;s appearance, calling her &quot;hot as shit.&quot; The video was made on the NBC Studios lot in the course of videotaping an &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; episode in mid-September 2005, promoting Trump&#x27;s cameo appearance in an episode of daytime soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; to promote &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

In the video, Trump discussed a failed attempt to seduce Bush&#x27;s then-co-host Nancy O&#x27;Dell: &quot;I moved on her, and I failed. I’ll admit it. I did try and fuck her. She was married.&quot; He also talked about stars groping women: &quot;...you just kiss...when you&#x27;re a star they let you do it. You can do anything [Bush: Anything you want]...grab them by the pussy...&quot;

When the news of the footage first broke, Bush was at New York&#x27;s JFK International Airport waiting to take off for Los Angeles. He spent the six-hour flight reading news reports on the unfolding controversy. By the time he arrived in Los Angeles, a horde of paparazzi had materialized at Los Angeles International Airport and at his home in Los Angeles, where they remained for more than a week. Bush spent the remainder of that weekend trying to save his job at &quot;Today&quot;, which had already garnered controversy, first over Bush&#x27;s lack of hard-news experience and the rude tone he exhibited during red carpet events and then over the Ryan Lochte matter. Initially, NBC News signaled Bush would return that Monday to apologize on-air. Bush later stated, &quot;I would have welcomed addressing the audience.&quot;

However, Bush received criticism online and calls for his resignation from the show, with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stating, &quot;Bush&#x27;s public image was damaged—perhaps beyond repair.&quot; He issued an apology, stating: &quot;Obviously I&#x27;m embarrassed and ashamed. It&#x27;s no excuse, but this happened eleven years ago. I was younger, less mature, and acted foolishly in playing along. I&#x27;m very sorry.&quot; Bush was 33 years old at the time the video was made. On October 9, 2016, NBC announced that Bush was suspended from &quot;Today&quot; for his role in the 2005 video. He was suspended pending an internal review. By October 17, Bush had been fired.

After &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in late November 2017 that Trump had privately told people, including a sitting senator, that the voice on the tape was not his, Bush published an op-ed in the paper on December 3, reaffirming that the voice in the tape was the president&#x27;s and accusing him of engaging in revisionist history.

===&quot;Extra&quot;===
On May 8, 2019, Telepictures announced they would hire Bush to be the host of &quot;Extra&quot;. Bush replaced Mario Lopez at the start of the 26th season on September 9, 2019, in a revamp of the show, which was originally to be renamed &quot;ExtraExtra&quot;. This came after Lopez departed Extra to host Access Hollywood, a show Bush previously hosted from 2001 to 2016.

=== &quot;Hot Mic&#x27;s&quot; ===
In early January 2025, Bush announced he was launching a new podcast, &quot;Hot Mics with Billy Bush&quot;, which will stream twice a week on TuneIn, starting Monday, January 13 and airs live Mondays and Wednesdays at 5 p.m. When discussing why he was starting this new program, Bush said, “A hot mic was the thing that led to my silencing, and now the hot mics are the vehicle by which I find an authentic, real voice.&quot; His first guest will be Megyn Kelly.

=== Other appearances ===
In 2024, Bush competed in season 11 of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as the wild card contestant &quot;Sir Lion&quot;. He was eliminated on &quot;TV Theme Night&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Sydney Davis in April 1998 and the couple have three daughters. On September 19, 2017, the couple announced they were separating. On July 15, 2018, Bush and his wife announced their divorce due to irreconcilable differences.

Through his mother, Bush is a descendant of Louis DuBois, who fled religious persecution in France and settled in what was then the Dutch Colony of New Amsterdam; he helped found the town of New Paltz, New York. He is also a descendant of the Hasbrouck family and the Van Vleck family, making him a second cousin, three times removed of Nobel Physics Prize recipient John Hasbrouck Van Vleck.

<doc id="921305" wikidata="Q731687" url="?curid=921305" title="1998 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1998 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVIII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Nagano, Japan, from 7 to 22 February 1998. Twenty-four nations earned medals at these Games, and fifteen won at least one gold medal; forty-eight countries left the Olympics without winning a medal. Competitors from Germany earned the highest number of gold medals (12) and the most overall medals (29). With 10 gold medals and 25 overall medals, Norway finished second in both categories. Denmark won its first – and as of 2018 only – Winter Olympics medal, while Bulgaria and the Czech Republic won their first Winter Games gold medals. Azerbaijan, Kenya, Macedonia, Uruguay, and Venezuela competed for the first time, but none of them won a medal.

Varying statistics are reported for the number of participants at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The Sports-Reference website states that 2,180 athletes from 72 nations participated in 68 events from 14 sports and disciplines. Olympic historian Bill Mallon, in his &quot;Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement&quot;, agrees with the figure of 2,180 participants. In contrast, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) website reports that 2,176 athletes competed at the Games. The sport of curling returned after a single appearance in the 1924 Olympics, snowboarding was added as a new sport, and women&#x27;s ice hockey made its first appearance in the Olympics. 

The leading medal winner at the Games was Russian skier Larisa Lazutina, who won five medals, including three golds. The only other athlete to win three gold medals was Norwegian skier Bjørn Dæhlie, who won four medals overall, making him the first Winter Olympian to win twelve career medals, eight of which were gold. Nine other athletes won three medals, including three Germans. American figure skater Tara Lipinski became the youngest competitor in Winter Olympics history to earn a gold medal in an individual event.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

In the two-man bobsleigh competition, a tie meant that two gold medals were awarded, so no silver medal was awarded for that event. A tie for second in the men&#x27;s Super G skiing competition meant that a pair of silver medals were given out, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the four-man bobsleigh, a tie for third resulted in the awarding of two bronze medals. Due to these ties, the number of gold medals awarded was one more than the number of silver or bronze medals. In snowboarding, Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s Giant Slalom, but it was briefly stripped by the IOC after he tested positive for marijuana. After the Canadian Olympic Association filed an appeal, however, the IOC&#x27;s decision was overturned.

<text>Francis Obiorah Obikwelu, (born 22 November 1978) is a retired Nigerian-born Portuguese sprinter, who specialized in 100 metres and 200 metres. He was the 2004 Olympic silver medalist in the 100 metres. In the same race, he set the European record in the event at 9.86 seconds, which stood for nearly 17 years. At club level, he was a professional athlete for Sporting CP.

==Biography==
Obikwelu was born in Onitsha, Nigeria. At the age of 14, one of Obikwelu&#x27;s football coaches noticed him and suggested he try out athletics. After two years, he represented Nigeria in the 1994 African Junior Championships and won the silver medal in the 400 metres.

Obikwelu moved to Lisbon, Portugal as a 16-year-old. After being rejected by both Sport Lisboa e Benfica and Sporting Clube de Portugal, he worked as a construction worker in the Algarve. He decided to learn Portuguese, and his teacher put him in contact with sports club Belenenses, where he resumed practising in 1995 before signing for Sporting Clube de Portugal in 1996. While living in Portugal, Obikwelu was adopted by a lady who he now refers to as his &quot;mother&quot;.

In July 2000, Lisbon-based Nigerian sprinter Mercy Nku said Obikwelu had decided to compete for Portugal because of neglect by Nigerian sports officials when he was injured while representing Nigeria in Sydney, Australia. &quot;He had to go to Canada to undergo an operation on his knee spending his own money.&quot; Obikwelu became a Portuguese citizen in October 2001.

Obikwelu&#x27;s athletics achievements, his life story and his personality made him a popular figure in Portugal, where he is nicknamed &quot;Chico&quot;, the short form of the Portuguese version of his first name.

In 2019, Obikwelu was reported to have worked as a speed trainer, on a temporary basis, for fellow Portuguese athlete, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. 

==Athletics career==
Obikwelu finished second in the 100 m at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, the first medal ever in athletics sprinting events for Portugal. In the qualifiers at the 2004 Summer Olympics he ran two times under ten seconds, setting a national record. In the final he recovered from a non-medal position in the second half of the race to win silver, just one-hundredth of a second behind Justin Gatlin and one-hundredth ahead of Maurice Greene, beating the former European record set by Linford Christie in 1993. Obikwelu finished fifth in the 200m.

He won 100 m and 200 m in 2006 at the European Championships in Athletics and became the first male athlete to win both 100 m and 200 m in the European Championship.

Obikwelu was voted &quot;Waterford Crystal European Male Athlete of the Year for 2006&quot; by the European Athletic Association, in an internet poll open to member federations, media and the general public.

Obikwelu announced his retirement from competitive athletics after failing to qualify for the 100 m finals in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but retracted his statement, agreeing to honour the last year of his contract with his track club. Obikwelu won the 100 m gold medal at the 2009 Lusophony Games.

<doc id="921309" wikidata="Q724446" url="?curid=921309" title="1994 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1994 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVII Winter Olympics, were a winter multi-sport event held in Lillehammer, Norway, from 12 to 27 February 1994. 1,737 athletes representing 67 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated. The games featured 61 events in 6 sports and 12 disciplines. Due to scheduling changes made in 1986 with the intent to begin holding the Summer Olympics and Winter Olympics in different years for the first time and moving forward, this edition of the Winter Olympics took place only two years after the previous event.

Athletes representing 22 NOCs received at least one medal, with 14 NOCs winning at least one gold medal. Six NOCs won their first Winter Olympic medals: Australia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Slovenia, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan. Three of these, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan, won their first Winter Olympic gold medals. The three first-time gold medalist NOCs and Belarus were all competing in their first Olympic Games as independent National Olympic Committees following the breakup of the Soviet Union.

Russia, in its first Winter Olympics after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, won the most gold medals, with 11, while host nation Norway had the most medals overall, with 26. Among individual participants, Norwegian speed skater Johann Olav Koss and Russian cross-country skier Lyubov Yegorova tied for the most gold medals, with three each, while Italian cross-country skier Manuela Di Centa had the most medals overall with five (two gold, two silver, and one bronze).

==Medal table==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC conventional sorting in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a NOC. The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<text>Winnipeg South () is a Canadian federal electoral district in Manitoba, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1917 to 1979, and since 1988. It covers the southernmost part of the city of Winnipeg.

==History==
The electoral district was created in 1914 from parts of the ridings of Winnipeg, Provencher, and Macdonald. It first elected a Member of Parliament in 1917.

In 1976, it was abolished when it was redistributed into the ridings of Winnipeg—Assiniboine and Winnipeg—Fort Garry, which took effect at the election of 1979.

In 1987, it was re-created from parts of Winnipeg—Assiniboine and Winnipeg—Fort Garry, which were abolished, and has been contested since 1988.

Some observers expected Winnipeg South to be a close race in 2011, though these predictions were later proven wrong. This race was close in 2006, when Conservative challenger Rod Bruinooge defeated four-term Liberal incumbent Reg Alcock by just 111 votes. In 2008, Bruinooge improved his plurality to nearly 6,000 votes. His Liberal challenger was businessperson, party activist, and former Winnipeg City Council member Terry Duguid.

This riding lost territory to Winnipeg South Centre and Saint Boniface—Saint Vital, and gained territory from the latter, during the 2012 electoral redistribution. Bruinooge chose not to contest the 2015 election, and Duguid won the seat for the Liberal Party.

Following the 2022 Canadian federal electoral redistribution, the riding will lose the neighbourhood of Minnetonka to St. Boniface—St. Vital and the neighbourhoods of Whyte Ridge and Linden Ridge to Winnipeg South Centre. These changes will come into effect upon the calling of the 2025 Canadian federal election. 

In federal politics, the riding has been a bellwether, electing an MP from the party that formed government nationally, since it was re-formed in 1988. In its earlier incarnation, it only elected opposition MPs three times, in 1925, 1953, and 1965.

===Members of Parliament===
This riding has elected the following members of the House of Commons:













===Current member of Parliament===
Terry Duguid has represented Winnipeg South since the 2015 election. He was re-elected in 2019 and 2021.

<doc id="921313" wikidata="Q2029195" url="?curid=921313" title="Pokémon Pinball">
<text>is a pinball-based Pokémon spin-off video game for the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on April 14, 1999, and in North America on June 29, 1999. In it, the ball is a Poké Ball, and most of the objects on the table are Pokémon-related.

Like any pinball game, the main objective is to get points, using the different modes of advances to score them at a higher rate. &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; has a secondary objective hinted at by the tagline &quot;Gotta Catch &#x27;em All,&quot; which is to collect all 151 Pokémon to fill your Pokédex. The Pokédex is saved between individual games, so it can be built up over time.

== Gameplay ==
There are two tables in the game: Red and Blue. Each table has its own details and gameplay elements.

Each table has different playable &quot;locations&quot;, which determine which Pokémon are available for capture. A subset of available locations are displayed slot-machine style in the beginning of a game, and pressing A will select a starting location and launch the first ball into play. After that, each table has its own mechanism for advancing to the next location, including the locations not available at the start of the game.

&quot;Catch Mode,&quot; when activated, starts a 2-minute window of opportunity where the player can attempt to capture a Pokémon. Once you activate &quot;catch mode,&quot; the player must hit the pop bumpers 6 times. Each hit unlocks 1/6 of an image of the Pokémon currently available for capture. Once the image is complete, the Pokémon appears on the table, where it must be hit 4 times with the ball to be captured.

&quot;Evolution Mode,&quot; when activated, starts a 2-minute window of opportunity in which the player selects a captured Pokémon (from the current game in progress only) and attempts to evolve it into another form. This is the only way to add the evolved form to the player&#x27;s Pokédex. Once you select a Pokémon, the player must hit targets on the playfield. There are up to 7 targets on the red board, 6 on the blue board, but only 3 of them have items in them needed to evolve a Pokémon, with the others creating a time-wasting sequence before the player can hit targets again. If the player hits a target with an item, the item appears on the playfield and must be collected with the ball. Once the player has collected 3 items, the hole in the center of the board opens up. Sinking the ball in the hole successfully evolves the Pokémon.

==Release==
&quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; was announced in the March 1999 issue of The 64Dream and was first released in Japan on April 14, 1999.
== Reception ==
&quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; received generally positive reviews, holding an aggregate score of 81.73% at GameRankings. &quot;GameSpot&quot; gave it a score of 8.7, citing its use of the Game Boy Color&#x27;s display and presentation. However, they also criticized the game, lamenting the lack of other pinball-related elements and the game&#x27;s poor physics. They additionally criticized the built-in rumble feature, calling it &quot;a waste [...] of an AAA battery&quot; and a &quot;nice novelty&quot;. &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; praised its rumble, however, noting that it &quot;won them over&quot;. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; editor Aaron Curtiss called it a &quot;great game&quot;. &quot;CNET&quot; called it &quot;more than a shameless cash-in on the &quot;Pokémon&quot; phenomenon&quot;, calling it one of the best pinball games for the Game Boy Color. However, they criticized the &quot;gratuitous Pikachu appearances&quot; and the &quot;incorrect physics&quot; as detracting somewhat from the pinball experience. &quot;The New York Times&quot; editor Joe Hutsko called the rumble mechanic as innovative, stating that it will likely lead to more games that use rumble from other developers. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; as one of the titles they want in the 3DS Virtual Console.

In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the game a 32 out of 40.

&quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; received a &quot;Gold&quot; sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom.

===Sequel===

&quot;Pokémon Pinball: Ruby &amp; Sapphire&quot; is a pinball game based on &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, and is the sequel to &quot;Pokémon Pinball&quot; for the third generation of &quot;Pokémon&quot; games. It was developed by Jupiter and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance handheld game console. It was first revealed at E3 in 2003, and was released in the same year – on August 1, August 25, and November 14 in Japan, North America, and PAL regions respectively. The North American release was done to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the North American release of &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. In some ways, it plays like a traditional pinball game, where the objective is to get a high score by keeping the ball going as long as possible and completing objectives. It features Pokémon collection, where while the players play pinball, they must also capture Pokémon.

<text>The 1992 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XVI Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in Albertville, France, from February 8 to 23. A total of 1,801 athletes representing 64 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+7 from 1988 Olympics) participated in 57 events (+11 from 1988) from 12 different sports and disciplines (+2 from 1988). In a break from tradition, the medals were primarily made of crystal rather than metal: gold, silver, or bronze was used only on the border.

Athletes from 20 NOCs won at least one medal, and athletes from 14 secured at least one gold medal. Making their first Olympic appearance since German reunification in 1990, Germany led in both gold and overall medals, with 10 and 26 respectively. The Unified Team, consisting of athletes from six former Soviet republics, was second in both categories, with 9 gold and 23 overall medals. Four nations won their first Winter Olympic medal in Albertville. South Korea won the country&#x27;s first Winter Olympic medal—a gold—when Kim Ki-hoon came first in the newly introduced Olympic sport of short track speed skating. Silver medal-winning slalom skier Annelise Coberger—in addition to winning New Zealand&#x27;s first Winter Olympic medal—became the first athlete from the Southern Hemisphere to win a medal at the Winter Olympics. Speed skater Ye Qiaobo of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and alpine skier Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg also won their countries first ever Winter Olympic medals in Albertville. Croatia and Slovenia participated at their first Olympic Games as independent nations, though neither won a medal.

Two athletes, both cross-country skiers for the Unified Team, tied for the most medals for an individual athlete with five each. Lyubov Yegorova won three gold and two silver medals, while Yelena Välbe won one gold and four bronze medals. Ski jumper Toni Nieminen of Finland became the youngest male to win a gold medal in the Winter Olympics at the age of 16.
==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. Medals won in team competitions—such as ice hockey—are counted only once, no matter how many athletes won medals as part of the team.

In the women&#x27;s giant slalom alpine skiing event, two silver medals were awarded for a second place tie, so no bronze medal was awarded for that event.

<doc id="921326" wikidata="Q19720" url="?curid=921326" title="River Spey">
<text>The River Spey () is a river in the northeast of Scotland. At it is the ninth longest river in the United Kingdom and the third longest and fastest-flowing river in Scotland. It is an important location for the traditions of salmon fishing and whisky production in Scotland.

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name &quot;Spey&quot; is uncertain. A possible etymological genesis for the name &quot;Spey&quot; is Early Celtic &quot;*skwej-&quot;, meaning &quot;thorn&quot;. The involvement of a Pictish form of Welsh &quot;ysbyddad&quot;, meaning &quot;hawthorn&quot;, has been suggested, but adjudged unlikely. One proposal is a derivation from a Pictish cognate of Old Gaelic &quot;sceïd&quot;, &quot;vomit&quot; (c.f Welsh &quot;chwydu&quot;), which is dubious both on phonological and semantic grounds. Ptolemy named the river on his map of 150 as &quot;Tuesis&quot;. The name &#x27;Spey&#x27; first appears in 1451.

==Course==

The Spey is long. It rises at over at Loch Spey in Corrieyairack Forest in the Scottish Highlands, south of Fort Augustus. Some miles downstream from its source it is impounded by Spey Dam before continuing a descent through Newtonmore and Kingussie, crossing Loch Insh before reaching Aviemore, giving its name to Strathspey. From there it flows the remaining north-east to the Moray Firth, reaching the sea west of Buckie.

On some sections of its course, the Spey changes course frequently, either gradually as a result of deposition and erosion from normal flow, or in a matter of hours as a result of spate. The Spey spates quickly due to its wide mountainous catchment area as a result of rainfall or snow-melt.

Insh Marshes, an area of roughly on either side of the Spey in its middle reaches are designated by Scottish Natural Heritage as a Site of Special Scientific Interest, as are the extensive shingle systems at Spey Bay.

== Tributaries ==
After leaving Loch Spey the river gathers numerous burns in the Corrieyarack, Sherramore and Glenshirra Forests. The first sizeable tributary is the Markie Burn which drops out of Glen Markie to the north to enter the waters of Spey impounded behind the Spey Dam. A further mile downstream the River Mashie enters from Strath Mashie to the south.

The River Truim enters on the right bank a couple of miles above Newtonmore and the Highland Calder enters from Glen Banchor on the left bank at Spey Bridge at Newtonmore. At Kingussie the Spey is joined on its left bank by the River Gynack which runs through the town and downstream it is joined by the River Tromie which enters on the right bank. The sizeable River Feshie joins on the right bank at Kincraig and the River Druie does likewise at Aviemore. Several miles downstream the River Nethy joins from the east near Nethy Bridge and the River Dulnain originating in the Monadhliath contributes a considerable flow from the west near Dulnain Bridge.

Between Grantown-on-Spey and Craigellachie, the Burn of Tulchan and Allt a Gheallaidh join from the west whilst the Spey&#x27;s most important tributary, the River Avon joins from the east. The Allt Arder and Knockando Burn also join from the west near Knockando. The River Fiddich enters from the right at Craigellachie and the Burn of Rothes enters from the left at Rothes. Downstream more burns enter the Spey, the most important of which are the Burn of Mulben, Red Burn and Burn of Fochabers.

==Industry==
The river traditionally supported many local industries, from the salmon fishing industry to shipbuilding. At one stage, Garmouth functioned as the shipbuilding capital of Britain, with timber from the forests around Aviemore and Aberlour being rafted down to create wooden-hulled ships.

The river is known by anglers for the quality of its salmon and trout fishing, including a particular form of fly fishing where the angler uses a double-handed fly rod to throw a &#x27;Spey cast&#x27; whereby the fly and the line do not travel behind the fisher (thereby keeping these away from the bushes and trees lining the banks behind him or her). This type of cast was developed on the Spey.

Speyside distilleries produce more whisky than any other region. Scotland&#x27;s Malt Whisky Trail is a tourism initiative featuring seven working Speyside distilleries, a historic distillery and the Speyside Cooperage. The concept was created in the early 1980s. The region is a natural for whisky distillers because of three benefits: it is close to barley farms, contains the River Spey and is close to the port of Garmouth.

The Speyside Way, a long-distance footpath, follows the river from Newtonmore to the sea, passing through the County of Inverness, County of Banff and County of Moray.

The River Spey is unusual in that its speed increases as it flows closer to the sea, due to a broadly convex long-profile. For most of its course the Spey does not meander, although it rapidly moves its banks. South of Fochabers a high earth barrier reinforces the banks, but the river has broken through on several occasions, removing a large portion of Garmouth Golf Course, sections of wall surrounding Gordon Castle, parts of the Speyside Way and some of the B9104 road.

The Spey viaduct (pedestrianised ) between Spey Bay and Garmouth was originally designed with its main span over the main flow of the river, however before construction was completed the river had changed its course and was running at one end of the bridge.

<text>The 1988 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Calgary, Canada, from 13 to 28 February 1988. A total of 1,423 athletes representing 57 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) (+8 from 1984 Olympics) participated in 46 events (+7 from 1984) from 10 different sports and disciplines (unchanged from 1984). Five new events were contested at these Games—men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Super G in alpine skiing, team events in Nordic combined and ski jumping, and women&#x27;s 5000 metres in speed skating—and two events returned to the program—men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s combined in alpine skiing.

As in the 1984 Winter Olympics, 17 NOCs won at least one medal and 11 of them secured at least one gold medal. The Soviet Union returned to the top of the gold medal count with 11, relegating East Germany—which took first place four years earlier—to second place with nine. The Soviet Union also collected the most overall medals (29), including the most bronzes (9). In a repeat of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and mimicking Yugoslavia at the 1984 Winter Games, Canada, as host nation, did not win any gold medal, totalling two silver and three bronze medals. Canadian hopes for a gold rested on the shoulders of figure skater Brian Orser, the reigning World champion and silver medalist at the Sarajevo Games. A tight contest with Brian Boitano of the United States ended with the American taking the Olympic title. Athletes from Norway failed to win any event in Calgary, making this the first and so far only time that the country ended the Winter Olympics without a single gold medal. Italy&#x27;s two gold medals were won by the same athlete: Alberto Tomba, a first-time Olympian who was crowned Olympic champion in the alpine skiing&#x27;s slalom and giant slalom events. Ski jumper Matti Nykänen of Finland contributed to three of his nation&#x27;s four gold medals by winning both individual events (first time by an Olympic ski jumper) and helping his team to win the collective title. The performance of the Swiss athletes ensured their nation&#x27;s best result at the Winter Games, securing a record number of 15 medals, including a then-record of five gold medals that took 18 years to be improved.

Five NOCs participated for the first time in the Winter Olympics—Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, and Netherlands Antilles—but none of them won a medal. Jamaica&#x27;s lone entry, the Jamaican bobsled team, inspired the making of the 1993 movie &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;.
==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.
