<doc id="930379" wikidata="Q151904" url="?curid=930379" title="Casino Royale (2006 film)">
<text>Casino Royale is a 2006 spy film, the twenty-first in the Eon Productions &quot;James Bond&quot; series, and the third screen adaptation of Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1953 novel of the same name. Directed by Martin Campbell from a screenplay by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, it stars Daniel Craig in his first appearance as Bond, alongside Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, and Jeffrey Wright. In the film, Bond is on a mission to bankrupt terrorism financier Le Chiffre (Mikkelsen) in a high-stakes poker game at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.

Following &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), Eon decided to reboot the franchise, attempting to provide a realistic and darker exploration of a less experienced and more vulnerable Bond. Casting involved a widespread search for a new actor to succeed Pierce Brosnan as Bond; the choice of Craig, announced in October 2005, initially proved controversial. Principal photography took place in the Bahamas, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the Czech Republic, with interior sets built at Pinewood Studios and Barrandov Studios. &quot;Casino Royale&quot; features primarily practical stuntwork as opposed to the computer-generated placements seen in other &quot;Bond&quot; films.

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square on 14 November 2006, and was theatrically released first in the United Kingdom on 16 November, and in the United States a day later. The film received critical acclaim, with praise for Craig&#x27;s reinvention of the character and the departure from the tropes of previous &quot;Bond&quot; films. It grossed over $ worldwide, becoming the fourth highest-grossing film of 2006 and the highest-grossing &quot;James Bond&quot; film until the release of &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012). A sequel, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;, was released in 2008.

==Plot==

MI6 operative James Bond earns his &quot;licence to kill&quot; and promotion to 00 agent status by assassinating the traitorous Dryden and his contact in Prague. In Uganda, Mr. White introduces Steven Obanno, a high-ranking member of the Lord&#x27;s Resistance Army, to Le Chiffre, an Albanian private banker to terrorists. Obanno entrusts Le Chiffre with $100million. Using knowledge of his upcoming terrorist attack on aerospace manufacturer Skyfleet, Le Chiffre shorts the company&#x27;s stock.

In Madagascar, Bond destroys an embassy while capturing and then killing a bomb maker named Mollaka. MI6 chief M criticises Bond for causing an international incident and ignoring her orders to take Mollaka alive. Information on Mollaka&#x27;s phone leads Bond to the Bahamas and corrupt Greek official Alex Dimitrios, who had hired Mollaka to bomb Skyfleet&#x27;s prototype airliner at the request of Le Chiffre. After winning Dimitrios&#x27;s vintage Aston Martin in a poker game and seducing his wife Solange, Bond pursues Dimitrios to Miami. Bond fights off an attack by Dimitrios and kills him. At the airport, Bond chases down the new bomber Dimitrios has hired and prevents the destruction of the Skyfleet airliner. With the Skyfleet stock secure, Le Chiffre loses Obanno&#x27;s money. Realising that somebody talked about the terrorist plot, Le Chiffre tortures Solange to death.

To recoup his client&#x27;s money, Le Chiffre organizes a Texas hold &#x27;em tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro. MI6 enters Bond—the agency&#x27;s best poker player—in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the British government in exchange for information on his clients. Bond is paired with Vesper Lynd, a British Treasury agent overseeing the $10million buy-in. They meet their contact, René Mathis, in Montenegro. Obanno, furious that his money is missing, threatens Le Chiffre, but allows him to continue playing to win back the money. Obanno and his bodyguard attack Bond, who kills them both. Bond loses his $10million stake after Le Chiffre is tipped off about his own tell, and Vesper refuses to authorize an additional $5 million for Bond to continue. Fellow player and CIA agent Felix Leiter stakes Bond the money in exchange for letting the CIA take Le Chiffre into custody. Le Chiffre&#x27;s lover Valenka poisons Bond but Vesper rescues him. Bond returns to the game and wins the tournament. Le Chiffre kidnaps Vesper to trap Bond and takes them to an abandoned ship. He tortures Bond to reveal the password to the bank account holding the winnings, but Bond resists. Mr. White bursts in and kills Le Chiffre, but spares Bond and Vesper.

Bond awakens in hospital and recovers with Vesper. He has Mathis arrested, believing that he had tipped off Le Chiffre. Bond falls in love with Vesper and resigns from MI6, and the couple sail to Venice. When M reveals that his winnings were never transferred to the British treasury, Bond realizes that Vesper has betrayed him. He tracks her to an exchange of the money, where gunmen spot him and take her captive inside a Venetian palace undergoing restoration. Bond destroys the flotation devices, causing it to sink into the Grand Canal as he kills the shooters. Vesper is trapped in the elevator, and Bond dives into the canal to rescue her. Vesper locks herself in to prevent Bond from saving her and drowns. Bond attempts to resuscitate her, but fails, and Mr. White escapes with the money.

M informs Bond, who has returned to service, that the organization behind Le Chiffre threatened to kill Vesper&#x27;s lover unless she became a double agent. When Bond denounces Vesper as a traitress, M reasons that she likely made a deal with White by trading the winnings for Bond&#x27;s life. Realizing Vesper left her phone to help him, Bond checks the contacts and locates Mr. White at an estate in Lake Como. He shoots White in the leg and introduces himself: &quot;The name&#x27;s Bond, James Bond&quot;.

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; includes a cameo by British entrepreneur Richard Branson (seen being TSA-screened at Miami International Airport). The cameo was cut out of the in-flight versions shown on British Airways&#x27; in-flight entertainment systems, and the Virgin Atlantic aircraft Branson supplied had its tail fin (bearing the company logo) obscured. Brazilian model Alessandra Ambrosio makes an unspoken cameo as a tennis player.

==Production==

=== Development ===
&quot;Casino Royale&quot; had been produced as a 1954 television episode starring Barry Nelson as Bond and Peter Lorre as the villain Le Chiffre, as well as a non-canonical 1967 ensemble satirical film starring David Niven, Peter Sellers and Woody Allen. Eon Productions gained the rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot; in 1999 after Sony Pictures Entertainment exchanged them for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)&#x27;s rights to &quot;Spider-Man&quot;. In March 2004, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay for Pierce Brosnan as Bond, aiming to bring back the flavour of Ian Fleming&#x27;s original &quot;Bond&quot; novels. An early draft featured Bond backpacking in Madagascar and playing chess with Lord Lucan. As the drafts became closer to being finalized, the opening scene in which Bond earns his 00 license was originally going to consist of an adaptation of either the short stories &quot;The Hildebrand Rarity&quot; or &quot;007 in New York.&quot; Rather than bombing the Skyfleet jet, there would have been a hijacking of a cruise ship in Cape Town.

Director Quentin Tarantino expressed interest in directing an adaptation of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, but Eon was not interested. He claims to have worked behind the scenes with the Fleming family, and believed this was the reason why filmmakers finally went ahead with &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Tarantino also said he would have set it in the 1960s and would only have made it with Pierce Brosnan as Bond.

In February 2005, Martin Campbell, who previously directed &quot;GoldenEye&quot; (1995), was announced as the film&#x27;s director. Campbell felt Purvis and Wade&#x27;s draft needed a rewrite, and suggested hiring Paul Haggis whose main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. Haggis explained, &quot;the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft, the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don&#x27;t know why but I thought that Vesper had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her.&quot; Haggis also said they wanted &quot;to do for Bond what &quot;Batman Begins&quot; did for Batman.&quot; Broccoli and Wilson thought that &quot;&quot;Die Another Day&quot; had become too fantastical&quot;, feeling the next film should be more realistic. Later that same year, Sony led a consortium that purchased MGM, allowing Sony to gain distribution rights starting with the film. Broccoli also felt that frivolity didn&#x27;t feel appropriate after the 9/11 attacks.

Eon believed that it had relied too heavily on computer-generated imagery effects in the more recent films, particularly &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, and was keen to accomplish the stunts in &quot;Casino Royale&quot; &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;. In keeping with this drive for more realism, screenwriters Purvis, Wade and Haggis wanted the script to follow as closely as possible the original 1953 novel, keeping Fleming&#x27;s darker storyline and characterization of Bond.
Due to copyright issues related to the ownership of &quot;Thunderball&quot;, the organization of which Mr White is a part is not named SPECTRE.

===Casting===
Pierce Brosnan fulfilled his original contract for four Bond films with &quot;Die Another Day&quot; (2002), and was in negotiations to star in &quot;Casino Royale.&quot; (Screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade confirmed that their &quot;Casino Royale&quot; script was written with Brosnan in mind.) Brosnan described how he found out that he had lost the role. He stated that he was working on another film in The Bahamas when his agent informed him that negotiations had broken down with producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson. The producers were not quite sure what they wanted to do, and would contact Brosnan the following week. During their phone conversation, Brosnan asked if he still had the role. Broccoli began to cry and responded, &quot;We’re so sorry&quot;, while Wilson was stoic and said, &quot;You were a great James Bond&quot;. Later reports cited Brosnan&#x27;s salary request as the reason he lost the role.

Producer Michael G. Wilson claimed over 200 names were being considered for Brosnan&#x27;s replacement. Hugh Jackman was offered the role, but turned it down as he wanted to focus on other projects. Croatian actor Goran Višnjić auditioned for the role the same day as Craig, but was reportedly unable to master an English accent. New Zealander Karl Urban was considered, but was unable to make the screen test due to filming commitments. According to Martin Campbell, Henry Cavill was the only other actor in serious contention for the role and had a &quot;tremendous&quot; audition, but at 22 years old, he was considered too young. (Cavill would later say that Campbell turned him down because he thought Cavill was out of shape.) Australian actor Sam Worthington and Scottish actor Dougray Scott were also considered. Scottish actor Sam Heughan and Welsh actor Matthew Rhys also auditioned. Scottish actor David Tennant was reportedly considered, although Tennant himself did not know he was on the shortlist until years later. Campbell and casting directors Janet Hirshenson and Jane Jenkins recalled meeting with Alex O&#x27;Loughlin, Julian McMahon, Ewan McGregor, Rupert Friend, and Antony Starr to discuss the role. Clive Owen was approached for the role multiple times, but turned it down as he didn&#x27;t know what he would have done with the character. The producers also met with Ralph Fiennes for the role, but declined as he didn&#x27;t want to commit to a franchise. Casting director Debbie McWilliams felt that the candidates for Bond in their 20s lacked charisma and maturity.

In May 2005, British actor Daniel Craig stated that MGM, Wilson and Broccoli had assured him he would get the role. Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM had offered him the opportunity to direct the new film, but at that point Eon Productions had not approached either Craig or Vaughn. A year earlier, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming&#x27;s novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisers on the set of &quot;Munich&quot; as inspiring because, &quot;Bond has just come out of the service and he&#x27;s a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he&#x27;s a killer. There&#x27;s a look. These guys walk into a room and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That&#x27;s the sort of thing I wanted.&quot;

On 14 October 2005, Eon Productions, Sony Pictures Entertainment, and MGM announced at a press conference in London that Craig would be the sixth actor to portray James Bond. Taking time off from reshoots for &quot;The Invasion&quot;, a business-suit clad, rather long-haired Craig boarded a Royal Marines Rigid Raider from before travelling to HMS &quot;President&quot;, where he was introduced to the world&#x27;s press. Controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as &quot;danielcraigisnotbond.com&quot; expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, &quot;The Name&#x27;s Bland – James Bland&quot;. Craig was also asked to dye his hair brown for the role but he refused calling it &quot;out of the question&quot;; he instead suggested to cut his hair short for more a &quot;brutal appearance&quot;.

The next important casting was that of the lead Bond girl, Vesper Lynd. Casting director Debbie McWilliams acknowledged Hollywood actresses Angelina Jolie and Charlize Theron were &quot;strongly considered&quot; for the role. Belgian actress Cécile de France had also auditioned, but her English accent &quot;wasn&#x27;t up to scratch.&quot; French actress Audrey Tautou was also considered, but not chosen because of her role in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;, which was another Columbia Pictures film released in May 2006. Rachel McAdams turned down a role in the film to focus on raising her own family. Olivia Wilde and French actress Eva Green were the two finalists for the part. On 16 February 2006, Green was announced to play the part.

Actress Tsai Chin played a cameo role as Madame Wu. She previously portrayed Ling in &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;.

===Filming===

Principal photography for &quot;Casino Royale&quot; commenced on 3 January 2006 and concluded on 20 July 2006. The film was primarily shot at Barrandov Studios in Prague, with additional location shooting in the Bahamas, Italy, and the United Kingdom. The shoot concluded at Pinewood Studios. Michael G. Wilson had stated &quot;Casino Royale&quot; would either be filmed or take place in Prague and South Africa. However, Eon Productions encountered problems in securing film locations in South Africa. After no other locations became available, the producers had to reconsider their options. In September 2005, Martin Campbell and director of photography Phil Méheux were scouting Paradise Island in the Bahamas as a possible location for the film. On 6 October 2005, Martin Campbell confirmed &quot;Casino Royale&quot; would film in the Bahamas and &quot;maybe Italy&quot;. In addition to the extensive location filming, studio work including choreography and stunt co-ordination practice was performed at the Barrandov Studios in Prague, and at Pinewood Studios, where the film used several stages, the paddock tank, and the 007 Stage. Further shooting in the UK was scheduled for Dunsfold Aerodrome in Surrey, the cricket pavilion at Eton College (although that scene was cut from the completed movie), and the Millbrook Vehicle Proving Ground in Bedfordshire.
After Prague, the production moved to the Bahamas. Several locations around New Providence were used for filming during February and March, particularly on Paradise Island. Footage set in Mbale, Uganda, was filmed at Black Park, a country park in Buckinghamshire, on 4 July 2006. Additional scenes took place at Albany House, an estate owned by golfers Ernie Els and Tiger Woods. The crew returned to the Czech Republic in April, and continued there, filming in Prague, Planá, and Loket, before completing in the town of Karlovy Vary in May. Karlovy Vary was used as the exterior of the Casino Royale, with the Grandhotel Pupp serving as &quot;Hotel Splendide&quot;.

The main Italian location was Venice, where the majority of the film&#x27;s ending is set. The scene with Bond on a sailboat was filmed aboard a yacht named &quot;Spirit&quot;. She was constructed by Spirit Yachts in Suffolk, England, and had to be demasted to fit under various Venetian bridges to reach the filming location. For this reason, SV &quot;Spirit&quot; &quot;was the first sailing boat to go up the Grand Canal in Venice for 300 years&quot;.

Other scenes in the latter half of the film were shot in late May and early June at the Villa del Balbianello on the shores of Lake Como. Further exterior shooting for the movie took place at properties such as the Villa La Gaeta, near the lakeside town of Menaggio.

A recreation of the Body Worlds exhibit provided a setting for one scene in the film. Among the Body Worlds plastinates featured in that scene were the &quot;Poker Playing Trio&quot; (which plays a key role in one scene) and &quot;Rearing Horse and Rider&quot;. The exhibition&#x27;s developer and promoter, German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, also has a cameo appearance in the film, although only his trademark hat is actually visible on screen.

===Effects===
In designing the credit sequence for the film, graphic designer Daniel Kleinman was inspired by the cover of the 1953 British first edition of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, which featured Ian Fleming&#x27;s original design of a playing card bordered by eight red hearts dripping with blood. Kleinman said, &quot;The hearts not only represent cards but the tribulations of Bond&#x27;s love story. So I took that as inspiration to use playing card graphics in different ways in the titles,&quot; like a club representing a puff of gun smoke, and slashed arteries spurting thousands of tiny hearts. In creating the shadow images of the sequence, Kleinman digitized the footage of Craig and the film&#x27;s stuntmen on the Inferno visual effects system, at Framestore CFC in London; the actors&#x27; silhouettes were incorporated into more than 20 digitally animated scenes depicting intricate and innovative card patterns. Kleinman decided not to use the female silhouettes commonly seen throughout the Bond title sequences, considering that the women did not fit with both the film&#x27;s spirit and the storyline following Bond falling in love.

For the rest of the film, special effects and miniature effects supervisor Chris Corbould returned to a more realistic style of film making and significantly reduced digital effects. According to Corbould, &quot;CGI is a great tool and can be very useful, but I will fight to the tooth and nail to do something for real. It&#x27;s the best way to go&quot;. Three scenes involving primarily physical effects in the film were the chase at a building site in Madagascar, the Miami Airport chase sequence, and the sinking Venetian house, with sets located on the Grand Canal and in Pinewood Studios.

The first scenes shot were ones involving a Madagascar building site, shot in the Bahamas on the site of a derelict hotel with which Michael G. Wilson had become acquainted in 1977 during the filming of &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. In the scene, Bond drives a digger towards the building, slamming into the concrete plinth on which Mollaka is running. The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.

The sequence at Miami International Airport was partly shot at the Dunsfold Aerodrome, in Surrey, which is known from British car show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, with some footage from the Prague and Miami airports. In filming the scene in which the engine thrust of the moving aircraft blows the police car high into the air, second unit director and cinematographer Alexander Witt, with help from second unit first assistant director Terry Madden and special effects floor supervisor Ian Lowe, used a crane with a strong lead cable attached to the rear bumper of the vehicle to move it up and backwards at the moment of full extension away from the plane.

The Skyfleet S570 aircraft in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ, which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the inboard engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each inboard pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner.

The sinking of the Venetian house at the climax of the film featured the largest rig ever built for a Bond film, with tank consisting of a Venetian piazza and the interior of an abandoned house being constructed. The rig, weighing some 90 tons, incorporated electronics with hydraulic valves that were closely controlled by computer because of the dynamic movement within the system on its two axes. The same computer system also controlled the exterior model, which the effects team had built to one-third scale to film the building eventually collapsing into the Venetian canal. The model lift within the rig could be immersed in of water, and used banks of compressors to strictly regulate movement.

At the time of filming, Aston Martin was still in the final phases of designing the DBS. Aston Martin delivered two working &#x27;hero&#x27; cars to the film. In addition to the two &#x27;hero&#x27; cars, Aston Martin had to prepare, and reinforce to withstand impact, three former development DB9s for use as DBS look-a-like stunt cars for the scene involving the car crash. Also a white prototype DB9 manual was supplied to the film crew so that the stunt drivers had something to practice with. Owing to the low centre of gravity of the vehicle, an 18-inch (450 mm) ramp had to be implemented on the road tarmac at Millbrook Proving Grounds and Adam Kirley, the stunt driver who performed the stunt, had to use an air cannon located behind the driver&#x27;s seat to propel the car into a roll at the precise moment of impact. At a speed exceeding 70 mph (113 km/h), the car rotated seven times while being filmed, and was confirmed by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; on 5 November 2006 as a new world record.

===Music===

The soundtrack of &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, released by Sony Classical Records on 14 November 2006, featured music composed by veteran composer David Arnold, his fourth soundtrack for the &quot;Bond&quot; film series, while Nicholas Dodd orchestrated and conducted the score. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli announced on 26 July 2006 Chris Cornell had composed and would perform the title song, &quot;You Know My Name&quot;. The song&#x27;s main notes are played throughout the film as a substitute for the James Bond Theme, to represent Bond&#x27;s youth and inexperience. The classic theme only plays in full during the end credits to signal the climax of his character arc.

===Promotional marketers===
In a reported £14million deal between the film&#x27;s production and car manufacturer Ford, Ford&#x27;s 2007 model Mondeo appeared in the film, driven by Bond. Both Sony and Sony Ericsson also made deals, making prominent appearances of tech products in the film including a Blu-ray player, Vaio laptop, Cyber-shot camera, Walkman NW-HD5 digital music player, and a Sony Ericsson K800i handset.

==Release==
&quot;Casino Royale&quot; premiered at the Odeon Leicester Square, the Odeon West End and the Empire simultaneously in London on 14 November 2006. It marked the 60th Royal Film Performance and benefited the Cinema &amp; Television Benevolent Fund (CTBF), whose patron, Queen Elizabeth II, was in attendance with the Duke of Edinburgh. Along with the cast and crew, numerous celebrities and 5,000 paying guests were also in attendance with half the proceeds benefiting the CTBF.

Only two days following the premiere, unlicensed copies appeared for sale in London. &quot;The rapid appearance of this film on the streets shows the sophistication and organisation behind film piracy in the UK,&quot; said Kieron Sharp, from the Federation Against Copyright Theft. Infringing copies of the DVD were selling for less than £1.57. Craig himself was offered such a DVD while walking anonymously through the streets of Beijing wearing a hat and glasses to avoid being identified.

In January 2007, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; became the first Bond film ever to be shown in mainland Chinese cinemas. The Chinese version was edited before release, with the reference to the Cold War re-dubbed and new dialogue added during the poker scene explaining the process of Texas hold &#x27;em, as the game is less familiar in China (this addition is reminiscent of dialogue that was added to the 1954 American TV adaptation to explain the rules of baccarat, the game featured in the original book). &quot;Casino Royale&quot; has earned approximately $11.7 million in China since its opening on 30 January on 468 screens, including a record opening weekend collection for a non-Chinese film, with $1.5 million.

After critics dubbed &quot;Die Another Day&quot; &quot;Buy Another Day&quot; because of around 20 product placement deals, Eon limited their promotions for &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Partners included Ford, Heineken (which Eva Green starred in adverts for), Smirnoff, Omega SA, Virgin Atlantic and Sony Ericsson.

===Home media===
&quot;Casino Royale&quot; was simultaneously released on DVD, UMD and Blu-ray by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on 16 March 2007. In the UK, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was released on 16 March 2007 on DVD and Blu-ray Disc. The DVD and Blu-ray Disc releases broke sales records: the Region 1 Blu-ray Disc edition became the highest selling high-definition title to date, selling more than 100,000 copies since its release. The region 2 DVD edition achieved the record of fastest selling title for its first-week release. The UK DVD has continued to sell well, with 1,622,852 copies sold since 19 March. A copy of the Blu-ray Disc edition of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was given out to the first 500,000 PAL PlayStation 3 owners who signed up to the PlayStation Network. The DVD was released in a separate two-disc widescreen and fullscreen editions, both of which includes the official music video for the film, and three documentaries detailing how Daniel Craig was chosen for the role of Bond, the filming, and an expanded version of the &quot;Bond Girls Are Forever&quot; documentary incorporating new interviews with &quot;Casino Royale&quot; cast members.

A three-disc edition of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; on DVD was released in the United Kingdom on 31 October 2008, coinciding with the cinema release of the sequel, &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot; (the following week in the United States). As well as features present from the 2007 release, the collector&#x27;s edition contains an audio commentary, deleted scenes, featurettes and a storyboard-to-film comparison. A two-disc Blu-ray version also followed in late 2008, featuring additional supplementary materials, enhanced interactivity through BD-Live, and the previous version&#x27;s 5.1 PCM soundtrack was replaced with a similar 5.1 Dolby TrueHD soundtrack.

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; was released a third time on Blu-ray in 2012 with DTS audio and deleted scenes, but it had fewer special features than the 2008 edition. It was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray on 25 February 2020.

===Cuts and censorship===
&quot;Casino Royale&quot; was censored for its release in the UK, the US, Germany and China.

In Britain, by omitting some of Le Chiffre&#x27;s sadism and James Bond&#x27;s reactions in the torture scene, the film received the desired BBFC 12A rating. In the United States, two fight scenes were censored to achieve a PG-13 rating: the fight between Bond and the traitorous MI6 agent Fisher&#x27;s contact, and the fight between Bond and Obanno in the stairway at the Casino Royale.

The German edit of the film cuts a sequence where the bomb-planter at the airport breaks a man&#x27;s neck, instead replacing it with an alternative take. The mainland Chinese cut of the film also trims the torture scene and the stairway fight, as well as a shot of Bond cleaning his wound at the hotel, and a boat scene.

The fully uncensored version can be found on the Australian, Dutch, French, Hong Kong, Japanese, and Scandinavian Blu-ray and DVD releases, on UK Blu-ray releases from 2012 onwards (rated 15), and on the 4K UHD Blu-ray release (branded as an unrated &quot;extended&quot; cut).

==Reception==
===Box office===
Upon its release in the United Kingdom, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; broke series records on both opening day—£1.7 million—and opening weekend—£13,370,969. At the end of its box-office run, the film had grossed £55.4 million, making it the most successful film of the year in the UK, and, as of 2011, the tenth-highest-grossing film of all time in the country.

On its US opening day, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was on top with $14.7 million; throughout the weekend, it grossed a total of $40.8 million, ranking narrowly second behind &quot;Happy Feet&quot;. However, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was playing in 370 fewer cinemas and had a better average ($11,890 per cinema, against $10,918 for &quot;Happy Feet&quot;). It earned $167.4 million by the end of its run in North America, becoming the highest-grossing film of the series, before being surpassed by &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;″s $168.4 million.

On 18 November 2006, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; opened at the first position in 27 countries, with a weekend gross of $43.4 million in the non-UK, Irish, US and Canada markets. The film retained the top spot at the worldwide box office for four weeks. The film earned $167.4 million in the United States and Canada and $426.8 million from international territories, for a worldwide total of $594.2 million worldwide. It was the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2006. It was the highest-grossing instalment of the &quot;James Bond&quot; series until &quot;Skyfall&quot; surpassed it in November 2012. After subsequent re-releases, it has earned $616 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 94% based on 263 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Casino Royale&quot; disposes of the silliness and gadgetry that plagued recent James Bond outings, and Daniel Craig delivers what fans and critics have been waiting for: a caustic, haunted, intense reinvention of 007.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 46 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Craig&#x27;s performance and credibility were particularly praised. During production, Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public, as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming&#x27;s original portrait of the character as tall, dark and suave. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; compared the quality of Craig&#x27;s characterization of Bond to Sean Connery&#x27;s and praised the script as smartly written, noting how the film departed from the series&#x27; conventions. &quot;The Times&quot; compared Craig&#x27;s portrayal of the character to that of Timothy Dalton, and praised the action as &quot;edgy&quot;, with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar. Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films, Kim Newman of &quot;Empire&quot;, and Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming&#x27;s James Bond from the original novel: ironic, brutal and cold. Arendt commented, &quot;Craig is the first actor to really nail 007&#x27;s defining characteristic: he&#x27;s an absolute swine&quot;.

The film was similarly well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating. The film was described as taking James Bond &quot;back to his roots&quot;, similar to &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;, where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticized in &quot;Die Another Day&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named the film as the fifth best of the series, and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series. Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig&#x27;s performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination.

Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, and wrote that &quot;Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong,&quot; and that the film &quot;has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series,&quot; specifically &quot;why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions.&quot; &quot;Time Out New York&quot; Joshua Rothkopf called Craig &quot;the best Bond in the franchise&#x27;s history,&quot; citing the actor&#x27;s &quot;crisp, hateful, Mamet-worthy snarl ... This is a screwed-up Bond, a rogue Bond, a bounder, a scrapper and, in the movie&#x27;s astoundingly bleak coda, an openhearted lover.&quot;

Vicky Allan of the &quot;Sunday Herald&quot; noted Bond himself, and not his love interests, was sexually objectified in this film: A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in &quot;Dr. No&quot;; he feels &quot;skewered&quot; by Vesper Lynd&#x27;s criticism of him; &quot;and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation, that is exactly what happens to Bond in [the film].&quot; So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects, &quot;the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market.&quot; This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester&#x27;s James Chapman, author of &quot;Licence to Thrill&quot;, who also notes Craig&#x27;s Bond is &quot;not yet the polished article&quot;; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming&#x27;s because he is &quot;humourless,&quot; but is also different because &quot;Fleming&#x27;s Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig&#x27;s Bond seems almost to relish it.&quot; Andrew Sarris of &quot;The New York Observer&quot; wrote that this particular Bond film is &quot;the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery.&quot;

Roger Moore wrote, &quot;Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, by introducing a more gritty, unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean [Connery] might just have to move over. Craig&#x27;s interpretation was like nothing we&#x27;d seen on screen before; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes. It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M, just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster. The script showed him as a vulnerable, troubled, and flawed character. Quite the opposite to my Bond! Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted.&quot; Moore also quipped that his praise was &quot;not heaped lightly,&quot; because he had to purchase the DVD himself. Raymond Benson, the author of nine &quot;Bond&quot; novels, called &quot;Casino Royale&quot; &quot;a perfect &quot;Bond&quot; film.&quot;

The film met with mixed reactions from other critics. John Beifuss of &quot;The Commercial Appeal&quot; said, &quot;Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego, as if he were Greg Brady in his &#x27;Johnny Bravo&#x27; phase?&quot; Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; criticized the more imperfect and self-aware depiction of the character, saying, &quot;Even James Bond, in other words, wants to be 007.&quot;

American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four, describing it as &quot;intriguing, audacious and very original ... more believable and less cartoonish, than previous 007 extravaganzas&quot;; he commented further that the &quot;sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics.&quot; Critics such as Emanuel Levy concurred, feeling the ending was too long, and that the film&#x27;s terrorist villains lacked depth, although he praised Craig and gave the film a B+ overall. Other reviewers responded negatively, including Tim Adams of &quot;The Observer&quot;, who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier.

In December 2006, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was named the best film of the year by viewers of &quot;Film 2006&quot;. In 2009, UK ice cream company Del Monte Superfruit Smoothies launched an ice pop lolly moulded to resemble the upper torso of Bond, a reference to the scene of him emerging from the sea. In 2008, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named &quot;Casino Royale&quot; the 19th-best film of the past 25 years.

===Accolades===
At the 2006 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; won the Film Award for Best Sound (Chris Munro, Eddy Joseph, Mike Prestwood Smith, Martin Cantwell, Mark Taylor), and the Orange Rising Star Award, which was won by Eva Green. The film was nominated for eight BAFTA awards, including the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film of the Year; Best Screenplay (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, Paul Haggis); the Anthony Asquith Award for Best Film Music (David Arnold); Best Cinematography (Phil Méheux); Best Editing (Stuart Baird); Best Production Design (Peter Lamont, Simon Wakefield); Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects (Steve Begg, Chris Corbould, John Paul Docherty, Ditch Doy); and Best Actor (Daniel Craig). This made Craig the first actor ever to receive a BAFTA nomination for a performance as James Bond. He also received the Evening Standard British Film Award for Best Actor.

&quot;Casino Royale&quot; won the Excellence in Production Design Award from the Art Directors Guild, and singer Chris Cornell&#x27;s &quot;You Know My Name&quot; won the International Press Academy Satellite Award for Best Original Song. The film was nominated for five Saturn Awards—Best Action/Adventure/Thriller Film, Best Actor (Daniel Craig), Best Supporting Actress (Eva Green), Best Writing (Purvis, Wade and Haggis) and Best Music (David Arnold). The 2006 Golden Tomato Awards named &quot;Casino Royale&quot; the Wide Release Film of the Year. &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was also nominated for, and has won, many other international awards for its screenplay, film editing, visual effects, and production design. At the 2007 Saturn Awards, the film was declared to be the Best Action/Adventure/Thriller film of 2006. Several members of the crew were also recipients of 2007 Taurus World Stunt Awards, including Gary Powell for Best Stunt Coordination and Ben Cooke, Kai Martin, Marvin Stewart-Campbell and Adam Kirley for Best High Work.

<text>A Great Wall () is a 1986 comedy-drama film written, directed and starring Peter Wang. It was the first American feature film shot in the People&#x27;s Republic of China and was Kelvin Han Yee&#x27;s first film.

==Plot==
When a Silicon Valley Chinese American executive goes back to his homeland of China for the first time in 30 years, he and his family encounter many culture clashes between the lives that they lead in the United States and the lives of their relatives in China. The finale of the movie includes an exciting table tennis match involving the Chinese-American son played by Kelvin Han Yee.

== Cast ==

* Peter Wang as Leo Fang
* Kelvin Han Yee as Paul Fang
* Li Qinqin as Chao Lili
* Shen Guanglan as Mrs. Chao

* Wang Xiao as Liu Yida
* Sharon Iwai as Grace Fang
* Xiu Jian as Yu

==Reception==
The film was met with critical acclaim. The film has a score of 60% from Rotten Tomatoes based on ten reviews.

Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago-Sun Times&quot; awarded the film three out of four, and wrote, &quot;&quot;A Great Wall&quot; is a human comedy about a Chinese-American family that goes to visit relatives in Peking, and within that simple premise are so many inspirations that the movie is interesting even when it&#x27;s just looking at things&quot;, and went on to say &quot;The chief pleasure of &quot;A Great Wall&quot; is its observation of the different attitudes toward the daily process of living in China and the United States.&quot;

<doc id="930382" wikidata="Q929855" url="?curid=930382" title="Velma Dinkley">
<text>Velma Dinkley is a fictional character in the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; franchise. She is usually seen wearing a baggy orange turtleneck sweater, a short red pleated skirt, knee high socks, Mary Jane shoes, and a pair of black square glasses, which she frequently loses and is unable to see without. She is seen as the &quot;brains&quot; of the group and also serves as Fred Jones&#x27; third-in-command.

==Character description==
Throughout her various incarnations, Velma is usually portrayed as a highly intelligent young woman with an interest in the sciences. She is also often portrayed as being very well-read on obscure fields such as Norse writing (as in the third &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; series, &quot;The Scooby-Doo Show&quot;). Due to her intelligence and problem-solving abilities, Velma is typically the first one to solve the mystery and, like Sherlock Holmes and many other fictional detectives, often keeps her conclusions secret till the end of the story. Velma Dinkley was inspired by the brainy sweater girl Zelda Gilroy, as played by Sheila Kuehl, from the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;.

A running gag in &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot; and &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; is Velma&#x27;s severe myopia and her ability to repeatedly lose her glasses (often the result of them falling off her face while she is being chased by a villain), saying &quot;My glasses! I can&#x27;t see without my glasses!&quot; whenever she accidentally misplaces them. Another running gag occurs when other frightened characters leap into her arms.

Velma is characterized as the most skeptical of the gang and is most likely to discount any paranormal explanations to their mysteries. This is particularly evident in the films &quot;Scooby-Doo! and the Curse of the 13th Ghost&quot; and &quot;Scooby-Doo! Return to Zombie Island&quot;, in which she discounts ghosts and zombies (which are real within the context of the franchise) that could not be unmasked by claiming they are hallucinations.

===Character background===
Like all of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; kids, later ret-conned as Mystery Incorporated members, Velma has a differing personal backstory and origin in different series.

In the original series &quot;Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!&quot;, Velma is shown to attend the same high school as the rest of the gang (as stated in the inaugural episode &quot;What a Night for a Knight&quot;). However, by &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, Velma is said to have graduated from a different high school (as stated in the episode &quot;Spirited Spooked Sports Show&quot;). In the film &quot;Scooby-Doo! Curse of the Lake Monster&quot;, it is revealed that her middle name is Daisy.

According to &quot;Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes&quot;, before she said &quot;Jinkies!&quot; she used to say &quot;Oh, my!&quot; but it wasn&#x27;t as catchy. Her parents are depicted to have pushed her from an early age to excel in her studies, resulting in hundreds of awards for outstanding achievement. Because of this, she is more vocal than her comrades would like. Of course, she also does her share of sweet-talking too.

During the first season of the 2010–2013 series &quot;Scooby-Doo! Mystery Incorporated&quot;, Velma is in a romantic relationship with Shaggy, much to the distaste of Scooby-Doo. Their relationship ends in &quot;Howl of the Fright Hound&quot; (season 1, episode 10). This series&#x27; incarnation of Velma is shown to be secretive and controlling. In the second season of &quot;Mystery Incorporated,&quot; Velma is shown secretly working for the series&#x27; overarching villain, Mr. E, alongside Marcie &quot;Hot Dog Water&quot; Fleach who is Velma&#x27;s former rival in science fairs. The two become friends after Velma returns to the gang and by the time of the series finale, Velma and Marcie are teammates at the Tri-state Olympiad of Science. This version of Velma frequently uses the expressions &quot;Oy&quot; and &quot;Oy gevalt&quot;, and is also shown listening to Klezmer music, hinting at a Jewish identity.

===Love interests===

Velma Dinkley is usually shown in relationships with men such as Shaggy Rogers (with whom she has a son in &quot;Scooby Apocalypse&quot;), Johnny Bravo, Patrick Wisely, Sam Winchester, Ben Ravencroft, and many other male characters, although since the 2010s, she has been depicted as also being romantically interested in other women, such as Coco Diablo.

In 2020, James Gunn, the screenwriter of the 2002 &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; film, stated that Velma was written &quot;eyeballing Daphne&quot; in early drafts of the script in accordance with the film&#x27;s original intent as an R-rated deconstruction of the &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; canon (with Shaggy meant to be depicted as a stoner, and Fred a gangster, the latter also ambiguously portrayed in the final film by Freddie Prinze Jr. as &quot;closeted gay or bisexual because of the ascot&quot;), although the final film would see Velma have a romance with a male waiter, with the film&#x27;s 2004 sequel &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; further depicting Velma in a full romantic relationship with Seth Green&#x27;s character, Patrick Wisely.

While addressing comments on his Instagram page in 2020 about &quot;Mystery Incorporated&quot;″s episode director labelling its version of Velma as being bisexual, producer Tony Cervone confirmed in response that his intention was for this iteration of Velma&#x27;s relationship with Marcie &quot;Hot Dog Water&quot; Fleach to be depicted—as clearly as would be permitted at the time—as a romantic one, following her previous failed relationship with Shaggy, with the characters subtly implied to be in a relationship in the series finale, with Marcie referring to Velma as &quot;my girl&quot;. In the 2022 animated film &quot;Trick or Treat Scooby-Doo!&quot;, Velma is depicted as &quot;crushing big time&quot; on female supporting antagonist Coco Diablo, which was widely reported by online news media as confirmation of the character&#x27;s lesbianism. However, right after the release of &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, it was revealed that Velma would have a &quot;secret crush&quot; on Fred in the HBO Max adult-oriented and metafictional streaming television series &quot;Velma&quot;, pitched as a &quot;love quadrangle&quot;, in which both Shaggy and Daphne would be depicted as having crushes on a South Asian version of Velma. The show received overwhelmingly negative reception. It gathered criticism for its characterization and departures from Scooby-Doo such as removal of Scooby-Doo. On October 8, 2024, the show was cancelled.

==Portrayals==
===Voice actors===
From 1969 to 1973, Nicole Jaffe voiced Velma. From 1976 to 1979, Pat Stevens voiced the character. From 1979 to 1980, Marla Frumkin provided her voice.

Velma was voiced by Ariana Greenblatt as a child and Gina Rodriguez as a teenager in the animated film &quot;Scoob!&quot;, with Greenblatt being set to reprise the role of her younger self in &quot;Scoob! Holiday Haunt&quot; before the film was canceled in August 2022. She makes a silent cameo in her aforementioned form (like the rest of the gang) as a spectator in &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.

On February 10, 2021, it was announced that Velma will have her own streaming television series on HBO Max in January 2023 with Mindy Kaling voicing her while executing producing with Charlie Grandy, Howard Klein and Sam Register. Titled &quot;Velma&quot;, the series follows an adult-oriented and metafictional &quot;love quadrangle&quot; Mystery Inc. with Velma portrayed as being of Indian descent. On July 11, 2022, the trademark for the series was listed as abandoned, only for HBO Chief Content Officer Casey Bloys to confirm the series to still be in production in August, with it previewing at New York Comic Con on October 6, 2022. The first two episodes of the series debuted on HBO Max on January 12, 2023; the other eight were released within the following months.

<text>Going the Distance is a 2004 Canadian teen comedy film directed by Mark Griffiths, and written by Eric Goodman and Kelly Senecal. A road movie set across Canada, its tagline was &quot;They came. They saw. They came.&quot; The film was released in Canada as &quot;Going the Distance&quot;, but for American release the film&#x27;s title was expanded to &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Going the Distance&quot;. The Canadian DVD release retains its original release title. The film stars Christopher Jacot, Joanne Kelly, Shawn Roberts, Mayko Nguyen, Ryan Belleville, Katheryn Winnick, August Schellenberg, and Jason Priestley.

Produced by Brightlight Pictures and the first film underwritten in part by MuchMusic, &quot;Going the Distance&quot; was a brand extension for the music television channel and a foray into theatrical feature films by MuchMusic&#x27;s then-corporate ownership CHUM Limited.

Recent changes to Telefilm Canada funding rewarded the producers of domestic films that were commercial successes in English Canada, and &quot;Going the Distance&quot; was a bid for such success.

==Plot summary==
Nick (Jacot), whose life seemed to be going perfectly, realizes he may lose his girlfriend Trish, to a famous music producer (Priestley). He sets out on a roadtrip from Tofino in west coast to go to the MuchMusic Video Awards in Toronto. He sets out in his RV along with two rowdy buddies (Tyler and Dime), for the road trip of their lives.

<text>A street game or street sport is a sport or game that is played on city streets rather than a prepared field. Street games are usually simply play time activities for children in the most convenient venue. Some street games have risen to the level of organized tournaments, such as stickball.

When street games are based on organized sports, the rules are highly modified to fit the situation, i.e. manhole covers for bases with cars or buildings for foul lines in stickball. When balls are used in street games, Spaldeens are often used.

== Street sports ==
Street sports are sports held in urban environments. Street sports are an expression of the spontaneous, improvisational and creative origins of sport adapted by human ingenuity to the urban environment. In historical terms their origins are traceable to the very earliest evidence of sports in Greek and Roman civilisation. Street sports are a hybrid form of sport and reflect the adaptation of conventional sports to the cityscape. Viewing the city through as a living, bustling, and thriving organism helps to cast light on the nature of that which is urban and to begin to home-in on particular features of urban life. It is only with the advent of this relatively modern perspective on the urban that it has become possible to speak in terms of street sports. 

Parkour artist Sebastien Foucan has defined the sport of Freerunning as a ‘physical art’. In the words of Foucan, street sports are &quot;...a philosophy concerned with the quest of personal and social realisation...&quot; A similar point of view can be found in the notion of the philosophy of urban solo-climbing expounded by Alain Robert. Likewise, the high-wire walker, Philippe Petit, whose performance include walking between the World Trade Center towers in 1974, has described his &#x27;interventions&#x27; on the urban environment as &#x27;art crimes&#x27;, suggesting their essence is creative and constitutes an expression—an interaction with the city. 

==Examples of street games==
This is a list of games that are traditionally played by urban children in playgrounds, parking lots, and back streets. They are all games that may be played on a hard surface, like asphalt. They are part of children&#x27;s street culture, and are notoriously hard to classify rigorously.

* Street sports in the Middle East: &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; and &quot;The Kite Runner&quot; (the film adaptation)
* Highwire Walking: &quot;Man on Wire&quot;, film documenting the background to Petit&#x27;s high-wire walk between the WTC Towers.
* A 2010 PBS documentary, &quot;New York Street Games&quot;, shows the best-known street games played in New York City in the twentieth century, as well as discussing the decline of those games in recent decades.

<text>Fani Chalkia (, , born 2 February 1979), also transliterated as Halkia or Khalkia, is a retired Greek hurdler.

Chalkia was born in Larissa, and represented Olympiacos. She won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s 400m hurdles at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. During the semifinals Chalkia set an Olympic record of 52.77 seconds.

On 16 August 2008, during the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing it was announced that she tested positive for the banned substance methyltrienolone. Chalkia denied she had taken any banned substance, and asked for her &#x27;B&#x27; sample to be tested, which also tested positive the next day. On 26 November 2008, the Greek Athletics Federation announced that she would serve a two year ban from the sport effective from August when Chalkia was expelled from the 2008 Summer Olympics.

In 2015, a Greek court convicted Chalkia of intentional doping and handed her a seven month jail sentence, suspended pending an appeal; this appeal was successful as on 19 February 2016, Chalkia was unanimously acquitted by the Athens Court of Appeal of all charges for the intentional use of banned substances. The court ruled that the former champion had fallen victim to a circuit of adulterated drugs, and also acquitted her trainer Giorgos Panagiotopoulos, who was facing charges of intentionally supplying banned substances.

<doc id="930402" wikidata="Q261442" url="?curid=930402" title="Kate Allen (triathlete)">
<text>Katherine Jessie Jean &quot;Kate&quot; Allen (born 25 April 1970, in Geelong, Australia) is an Australian-Austrian triathlete. She won the gold medal in the women&#x27;s triathlon at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

==Early life==
Kate Allen grew up on a sheep-farming property with her three brothers at Teesdale, Victoria in southeastern Australia.

From an early age her parents encouraged her to run, and she used to frequently jog to primary school some 3 kilometres from home. At the age of four Allen began participating in Little Athletics at Landy Field in Geelong. She competed in junior athletics until the age of 14, winning a number of championships over 1500 m and &#x27;cross-country&#x27; distance. Allen also enjoyed gymnastics in her early years, a sport that would prove important to her coordination skills during her triathlon career.

Allen graduated from Ballarat University as a nurse at age 20. She then travelled overseas. During one of her trips she met Marcel Diechtler in Kitzbühel, whom she married in 1999, who was a triathlon competitor for Austria. Diechtler encouraged Allen to take up triathlon, beginning in 1996.

==Triathlon career==
After some years of successful racing around Europe with her former coach Mario Huys Allen received Austrian citizenship in 2002 and started racing in the World Cup.
She took silver in only her third World Cup in Hamburg, Germany and won silver at the European Championships in Valencia, Spain.

Just eight years after beginning the sport, Allen won the 2004 Olympic triathlon in Athens. At the end of the swim leg Allen was in 44th place in the field of 51. After the bicycle leg she was in 28th. During the run she progressively overtook twenty seven competitors to power past then-leader Australian Loretta Harrop just 150 metres from the finish line, winning the race in emphatic style.

Alongside her Olympic distance triathlon career, Allen showed several strong performances in racing at the Ironman distance. In 2002, she recorded the fastest Ironman debut time ever, completing the course in 8:58:24. She topped her performance in 2003, finishing in 8:54:01 hours, a personal record that still stands.

After the Olympic Games in Athens it was Allen&#x27;s plan to only race at Ironman distances for 2005–2006, with the aim of winning the Ironman World Championships in Hawaii. After finishing 7th in 2002, Allen placed 5th in both 2005 and 2006.

During the ITU New Plymouth BG Triathlon World Cup in New Zealand in April 2008, Allen had a bike crash at and suffered serious injuries.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics, she ranked 14th.

<doc id="930420" wikidata="Q1329436" url="?curid=930420" title="Consumer organization">
<text>Consumer organizations are advocacy groups that seek to protect people from corporate abuse like unsafe products, predatory lending, false advertising, astroturfing and pollution.

Consumer Organizations may operate via protests, litigation, campaigning, or lobbying. They may engage in single-issue advocacy (e.g., the British Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA), which campaigned against keg beer and for cask ale) or they may set themselves up as more general consumer watchdogs, such as the Consumers&#x27; Association in the UK.

One common means of providing consumers useful information is the independent comparative survey or test of products or services, involving different manufacturers or companies (e.g., &quot;Which?&quot;, &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;, etc.).

Another arena where consumer organizations have operated is food safety. The needs for campaigning in this area are less easy to reconcile with their traditional methods, since the scientific, dietary or medical evidence is normally more complex than in other arenas, such as the electric safety of white goods. The current standards on mandatory labelling, in developed countries, have in part been shaped by past lobbying by consumer groups.

The aim of consumer organizations may be to establish and to attempt to enforce consumer rights. Effective work has also been done, however, simply by using the threat of bad publicity to keep companies&#x27; focus on the consumers&#x27; point of view.

Consumer organizations may attempt to serve consumer interests by relatively direct actions such as creating and/or disseminating market information, and prohibiting specific acts or practices, or by promoting competitive forces in the markets which directly or indirectly affect consumers (such as transport, electricity, communications, etc.).

==History==
Two precursor organizations to the modern consumer organization are standards organizations and consumers leagues. Both of these appeared in the United States around 1900.

Trade associations and professional societies began to establish standards organizations to reduce industry waste and increase productivity. Consumer leagues modeled themselves after trade unions in their attempts to improve the market with boycotts in the same way that trade unions sought to improve working conditions with strike action.

* CAMRA - a lobbying group concerned with the tradition and quality of beer.
* The Citizens Advice Bureau, a free service that provides legal advice, practical help and information on consumer rights across the country.
* Consumer Council for Water (formerly known as Watervoice)
* Consumer Direct (abolished per 31 March 2012 with its functions being passed to local trading standards departments and Citizens Advice Bureau)
* Consumer Focus (formerly National Consumer Council). The Government announced as part of the October 2010 spending review that Consumer Focus will be abolished, with the Consumer Direct helpline taken over by Citizens Advice. Some of Consumer Focus&#x27; functions would transfer to Citizens Advice Bureaux, Citizens Advice Scotland and the General Consumer Council for Northern Ireland following the Public Bodies Act 2011 and any necessary secondary legislation. The transfer is expected to begin April 2013 and be complete by April 2014.
* General Consumer Council of Northern Ireland
* Good Garage Scheme, an automobile repair shop motoring scheme
* Postwatch
* Which? - formerly the Consumers Association - a consumer advocacy organisation which has substantial powers (for example to take representative actions under the Competition Act 1998) but which is primarily a lobbying organisation funded entirely by subscriptions to its regular consumer information magazine.

====United States====
* Alliance for Justice
* Better Business Bureau
* Consumer Action
* Consumer Federation of California
* Consumers Union, publishers of &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;
* Consumer Watchdog, formerly the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
* FlyersRights.org
* Public Citizen
* Consumer Federation of America
* Center for Science in the Public Interest (food/nutrition)
* National Consumers League
* U.S. Public Interest Research Group
* CLARIFIED CONSUMER LLC (Consumer Right Advocacy)

==Consumer magazines==
By 1969 most capitalist countries with developed marketplaces hosted consumer organizations that published consumer magazines which reported the results of product testing. Internationally, the idea of consumer organizations spread from Consumers Union in the United States starting in 1956. The growth of interest in product testing journalism might be explained by increased consumption of mass-marketed products in and before that period. That increased international consumption itself was an effect of the aftermath of World War II.

In the 25 years after World War II, there was a correlation between the number of people in a country who were purchasing cars and the popularity of consumer magazines. In some cases, an increase in other consumer purchases seemed to drive popularity of consumer magazines, but the correlation was closest for populations who made decisions about buying cars. The availability of consumer magazines comforted consumers when individuals in society suddenly became overwhelmed with marketplace decisions, and the popularity of magazines seemed to grow as more marketplace decisions became available.

<doc id="930436" wikidata="Q17022469" url="?curid=930436" title="Brain fingerprinting">
<text>Brain fingerprinting (BF) is a lie detection technique which uses brain waves from a electroencephalography (EEG) to determine whether specific information is stored in the subject&#x27;s cognitive memory. It was invented by Larry Farwell, a Harvard-graduated neuroscientist, and published in 1995. The technique involves presenting words, phrases, or pictures containing salient details about a crime on a computer screen, in a series with other, irrelevant stimuli to identify whether the suspect recognizes the crime-related items. Although brain fingerprinting has been used in investigations, the test results themselves can not be admitted as evidence in a legal trial.

The assumption underpinning the application of BF is that the culprit has concealed information about the crime stored in the brain and it can be revealed by analysing fluctuations in the brainwaves that measure a human&#x27;s neurological activity. Brain fingerprinting relies on two major components, specificity and recognition, as it is assumed that the culprit of the crime will recognize certain details of the investigation whilst innocent subjects will not, based on the familiarity of the items presented. For example, only a guilty individual will have concealed information about the specific gun used in a crime.

== P300 response ==
The procedure begins by attaching sensors called electrodes to the subject&#x27;s scalp to form a circuit that quantifies brain activity using a test called an electroencephalogram (EEG). When conducting an EEG to measure electrical activity in the brain, a distinctive surge of electrical activity may appear between 300 and 800 milliseconds – this is referred to as the P300 response, first introduced in the 1960s. This psychophysiological response signals one&#x27;s reaction to seeing a familiar object immediately after being exposed to the stimulus. Based on this information, scientists have argued that they can accurately convict a guilty suspect. Although the origins of this neurological response are unclear, the phenomenon has been extensively studied and peer-reviewed for over 100 years.

Contrary to a traditional polygraph (also known as a lie detector) that relies on changes to sweat glands as nervous responses to determine the subject&#x27;s honesty, brain fingerprinting is entirely concealed in the brain&#x27;s responses to stimuli. This makes the technique harder to resist or beat, making it a more reliable method of detecting lies. The P300 response is supported by at least 80 laboratory experiments that use the Guilty Knowledge Test (GKT). The GKT, also known as the Concealed Information Test (CIT), is an alternative method of interrogation to reveal concealed information a culprit might have about a crime. Similarly, it focuses on measuring the physiological reaction of subjects, although it prioritises electrodermal, respiratory and cardiovascular responses rather than neurological activity.

== History ==
Brain fingerprinting was first used in a criminal case in 1999, when a man named James Grinder confessed to committing a murder that happened 15 years prior. In a short time after his confession, he retracted his statements. The police struggled to incriminate Grinder because the evidence was outdated. The police and FBI reached out to Lawrence Farwell with the aim of using BF to obtain enough evidence to incriminate Grinder. Soon after taking the test, Grinder confessed to the murder of Julie Helton and three other people, securing him life imprisonment. This case was not the last time Farwell worked in collaboration with a US Intelligence Community as the CIA went on to fund Farwell&#x27;s counterterrorism research for the US Navy, which was published by &quot;Frontiers in Neuroscience&quot;.

In 2001, the US Federal Agency outlined how brain fingerprinting was only to be used as an investigative tool; however, several intelligence agencies came forth saying that despite the support and funds they had provided to the development of this technology, they were not to use it at all because of its lack of applicability. Following the US court&#x27;s rejection of BF, Farwell redirected his resources to advertising the technology abroad. He has worked alongside several government agencies, such as in the United Arab Emirates, and justice systems in India and New Zealand. Nevertheless, his technology has not yet achieved a widespread presence in any criminal setting around the world, and results of brainwave analysis are often not admissible as evidence in court.

== Criticism ==
Following extensive and ongoing research on the brain fingerprinting protocol for detecting deception and its decisive contribution to several trials, the accuracy of technology has been the subject of speculation for a decade. J Peter Rosenfeld found methodological problems associated with brain fingerprinting and related methods. Other researchers have argued that Farwell is misleading and misrepresenting the scientific status of brain fingerprinting technology. Additional studies have attempted to determine the success rate of BF, given that Farwell has claimed a 100% success rate for the technology and a lack of both false positives and negatives in his research. When carrying out comparative studies between the common polygraph lie detector and brain fingerprinting, the latter appears to have fewer false positives; however, when questioned about specific details, the P300 technique seems to be less reliable.

The legitimacy of brain fingerprinting is still questioned. The lack of replication of his studies is largely due to legal restrictions regarding the use of his software and apparatus appointed by the patent issued to Farwell in 1994. This controversy is enhanced by discussion surrounding the patent rights and the fraudulent behaviour of the developer Larry Farwell regarding fabricated FBI reports. Brainwave Sciences, the technology company that owns BF, tainted the validity of the technique when some of its board members became the focal spotlights of scandals in the US. As a result, the acceptance of BF is still the subject of controversy and debate among scholars and legal institutions.

== Current research ==
A research team in New Zealand conducted an examination of Farwell&#x27;s technology and found that current forensic brainwave analysis (FBA) methods did not meet standards for foundational validity (validity in lab settings) set in the Report to the President on Forensic Science in Criminal Courts: Ensuring Scientific
Validity of Feature-Comparison Methods. However, they argued that the technique has the potential to serve as a useful tool in civil and criminal justice if its validity can be conclusively established. Two pilot studies exploring FBA have been conducted, and preliminary results suggest the need for further research to determine the accuracy, validity and reliability of FBA.

A recent review by Rosenfeld found that the P300 response has proven resistant and accurate.

Brain fingerprinting has made appearances in the media. In 2018, Larry Farwell&#x27;s technique made a brief appearance in the second season of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Making a Murderer&quot;; however, his findings were not considered during the trial as he was using unauthorized software.

Since 2020, the application of brain fingerprinting has changed. Most recently, the term &quot;brain fingerprinting&quot; referred to the uniqueness of brains from a functional neuroimaging context. This new field of study aims to predict patterns of brain connectivity to hopefully prognosticate mental disorders in the future.

<text>A sungrazing comet is a comet that passes extremely close to the Sun at perihelion – sometimes within a few thousand kilometres of the Sun&#x27;s surface. Although small sungrazers can completely evaporate during such a close approach to the Sun, larger sungrazers can survive many perihelion passages. However, the strong evaporation and tidal forces they experience often lead to their fragmentation.

Up until the 1880s, it was thought that all bright comets near the Sun were the repeated return of a single sungrazing comet. Then, German astronomer Heinrich Kreutz and American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood determined that, instead of the return of the same comet, each appearance was a different comet, but each were related to a group of comets that had separated from each other at an earlier passage near the Sun (at perihelion). Very little was known about the population of sungrazing comets until 1979 when coronagraphic observations allowed the detection of sungrazers. As of October 21, 2017, there are 1495 known comets that come within ~12 solar radii (~0.055 AU). This accounts for nearly one third of all comets. Most of these objects vaporize during their close approach, but a comet with a nucleus radius larger than 2–3 km is likely to survive the perihelion passage with a final radius of ~1 km.

Sungrazer comets were some of the earliest observed comets because they can appear very bright. Some are even considered Great Comets. The close passage of a comet to the Sun will brighten the comet not only because of the reflection off the comet nucleus when it is closer to the Sun, but the Sun also vaporizes a large amount of gas from the comet and the gas reflects more light. This extreme brightening will allow for possible naked eye observations from Earth depending on how volatile the gases are and if the comet is large enough to survive perihelion. These comets provide a useful tool for understanding the composition of comets as we observe the outgassing activity and they also offer a way to probe the effects solar radiation has on other Solar System bodies.

== History of sungrazers ==

=== Pre-19th century ===
One of the first comets to have its orbit computed was the sungrazing comet (and Great Comet) of 1680, now designated C/1680 V1. It was observed by Isaac Newton and he published the orbit results in 1687. Later, in 1699, Jacques Cassini proposed that comets could have relatively short orbital periods and that C/1680 V1 was the same as a comet observed by Tycho Brahe in 1577, but in 1705 Edmond Halley determined that the difference between the perihelion distances of the two comets was too great for them to be the same object. However, this marked the first time that it was hypothesized that Great Comets were related or perhaps the same comet. Later, Johann Franz Encke computed the orbit of C/1680 V1 and found a period of approximately 9000 years, leading him to conclude that Cassini&#x27;s theory of short period sungrazers was flawed. C/1680 V1 had the smallest measured perihelion distance until the observation in 1826 of comet C/1826 U1.

=== 19th century ===
Advances were made in understanding sungrazing comets in the 19th century with the Great Comets of 1843, C/1880 C1, and 1882. C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 had very similar appearances and also resembled the Great Comet of 1106, therefore Daniel Kirkwood proposed that C/1880 C1 and C/1843 D1 were separate fragments of the same object. He also hypothesized that the parent body was a comet seen by Aristotle and Ephorus in 371 BC because there was a supposed claim that Ephorus witnessed the comet splitting after perihelion.

Comet C/1882 R1 appeared only two years after the previously observed sungrazer so this convinced astronomers that these bright comets were not all the same object. Some astronomers theorized that the comet might pass through a resisting medium near the Sun and that would shorten its period. When astronomers observed C/1882 R1, they measured the period before and after perihelion and saw no shortening in the period which disproved the theory. After perihelion this object was also seen to split into several fragments and therefore Kirkwood&#x27;s theory of these comets coming from a parent body seemed like a good explanation.

In an attempt to link the 1843 and 1880 comets to the comet in 1106 and 371 BC, Kreutz measured the fragments of the 1882 comet and determined that it was likely a fragment of the 1106 comet. He then designated that all sungrazing comets with similar orbital characteristics as these few comets would be part of the Kreutz Group.

The 19th century also provided the first spectrum taken of a comet near the Sun which was taken by Finlay &amp; Elkin in 1882. Later the spectrum was analyzed and Fe and Ni spectral lines were confirmed.

=== 20th century ===
The first sungrazing comet observed in the 20th century was in 1945 and then between 1960 and 1970 five sungrazing comets were seen (C/1961 O1, C/1962 C1, C/1963 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1970 K1). The 1965 comet (Comet Ikeya-Seki) allowed for measurements of spectral emission lines and several elements were detected including Iron, marking this the first comet since the Great Comet of 1882 to show this feature. Other emission lines included K, Ca, Ca+, Cr, Co, Mn, Ni, Cu, and V. Comet Ikeya-Seki also led to separating the Kreutz sungrazers into two subgroups by Brian Marsden in 1967. One subgroup appears to have the 1106 comet as the parent body and members are fragments of that comet, while the other group have similar dynamics but no confirmed parent body associated with it.

==== Coronagraphic observations ====
The 20th century greatly impacted sungrazing comet research with the launch of coronagraphic telescopes including Solwind, SMM, and SOHO. Until this point, sungrazing comets were only seen with the naked eye but with the coronagraphic telescopes many sungrazers were observed that were much smaller and very few have survived perihelion passage. The comets observed by Solwind and SMM from 1981 to 1989 had visual magnitudes from about -2.5 to +6 which is much fainter than Comet Ikeya-Seki with a visual magnitude of about -10.

In 1987 and 1988 it was first observed by SMM that there could be pairs of sungrazing comets that can appear within very short time periods ranging from a half of a day up to about two weeks. Calculations were made to determine that the pairs were part of the same parent body but broke apart at tens of AU from the Sun. The breakup velocities were only on the order of a few meters per second which is comparable to the speed of rotation for these comets. This led to the conclusion that these comets break from tidal forces and that comets C/1882 R1, C/1965 S1, and C/1963 R1 probably broke off from the Great Comet of 1106.

Coronagraphs allowed for measuring the properties of the comet as it reached very close to the Sun. It was noted that sungrazing comets tend to peak in brightness at a distance of about 12.3 solar radii or 11.2 solar radii. It is thought that this variation stems from a difference in dust composition. Another small peak in brightness has been found at about 7 solar radii from the sun and it is possibly due to a fragmentation of the comet nucleus. An alternative explanation is that the brightness peak at 12 solar radii comes from the sublimation of amorphous olivines and the peak at 11.2 solar radii is from the sublimation of crystalline olivines. The peak at 7 solar radii could then be the sublimation of pyroxene.

== Sungrazing groups ==

=== Kreutz Sungrazers ===
The most famous sungrazers are the Kreutz Sungrazers, which all originate from one giant comet that broke up into many smaller comets during its first passage through the inner Solar System. An extremely bright comet seen by Aristotle and Ephorus in 371 BC is a possible candidate for this parent comet.

The Great Comets of 1843 and 1882, Comet Ikeya–Seki in 1965 and C/2011 W3 (Lovejoy) in 2011 were all fragments of the original comet. Each of these four was briefly bright enough to be visible in the daytime sky, next to the Sun, 1882&#x27;s comet outshining even the full moon.

In 1979, C/1979 Q1 (Solwind) was the first sungrazer to be spotted by US satellite P78-1, in coronagraphs taken on 30 and 31 Aug 1979.

Apart from Comet Lovejoy, none of the sungrazers seen by SOHO has survived its perihelion passage; some may have plunged into the Sun itself, but most are likely to have simply evaporated away completely.

=== Other sungrazers ===

About 83% of the sungrazers observed with SOHO are members of the Kreutz group. The other 17% contains some sporadic sungrazers, but three other related groups of comets have been identified among them: the Kracht, Marsden and Meyer groups. The Marsden and Kracht groups both appear to be related to Comet 96P/Machholz. These comets have also been linked to several meteor streams, including the Daytime Arietids, the delta Aquariids, and the Quadrantids. Linked comet orbits suggest that both Marsden and Kracht groups have a small period, on the order of five years, but the Meyer group may have intermediate- or long-period orbits. The Meyer group comets are typically small, faint, and never have tails. The Great Comet of 1680 was a sungrazer and while used by Newton to verify Kepler&#x27;s equations on orbital motion, it was not a member of any larger groups. However, comet C/2012 S1 (ISON), which disintegrated shortly before perihelion, had orbital elements similar to the Great Comet of 1680 and could be a second member of the group.

== Origin of sungrazing comets ==

Studies show that for comets with high orbital inclinations and perihelion distances of less than about 2 astronomical units, the cumulative effect of gravitational perturbations over many orbits is adequate to reduce the perihelion distance to very small values. One study has suggested that Comet Hale–Bopp has about a 15% chance of eventually becoming a sungrazer.

== Role in solar astronomy ==

The motion of tails of sungrazers that survive perihelion (such as Comet Lovejoy) can provide solar astronomers with information about the structure of the solar corona, particularly the detailed magnetic structure.

<doc id="930443" wikidata="Q5158542" url="?curid=930443" title="Concertina movement">
<text>Concertina movement is the method by which a snake or other organism anchors itself with sections of itself and pulls or pushes with other sections to move in the direction it wants to go. To spring forward a snake may require a rough surface to thrust back against. It is named after the concertina musical instrument.

== Mechanism ==

Each point on the snake&#x27;s body goes through alternating cycles of static contact and movement, with regions propagating posteriorly (i.e. any point on the snake will change from movement to stasis or vice versa shortly after the change occurs in the point anterior to it). This movement is quite strenuous and slow compared to other methods of locomotion. Energetic studies show that it takes more calories per meter to use concertina locomotion than either sidewinding or lateral undulation.

== Modes ==

In snakes, there are two currently recognized modes of concertina locomotion.

=== Tunnel ===

Tunnel concertina locomotion is often employed in unobstructed tunnels, where the snake lacks both sufficient contact points to perform lateral undulation and sufficient lateral room to perform sidewinding. During tunnel concertina locomotion, the snake anchors itself by flexing its body in a series on alternating bends which press against the walls of the tunnel. The snake extends the anterior portion of its body by straightening these bends, then flexes the anterior portion of the body to form anterior anchor points while pulling the posterior portion forward. This mode of concertina, while still slower than lateral undulation or sidewinding, is still fairly fast, with snakes moving approximately 10% of their length per second. However, because the snake is straightening and re-forming bends, it requires the entire space of the tunnel to move, and any obstruction will disrupt locomotion. In the presence of either of these, snakes will switch from concertina to another mode (as both of the above are faster and more economical), though in the case of extreme lateral constraint (tunnel width less than 3x body width), snakes will ignore the contact points that could be used in lateral undulation and perform concertina.

=== Arboreal ===

Arboreal concertina locomotion is employed on bare branches on trees, when secondary branches are not available (when they are, snakes perform lateral undulation, using these branches as contact points). In this mode of concertina locomotion, snakes likely grip the branch by ventrally flexing the body at the points where the alternation bends cross the perch, with the bends themselves sometimes extending beyond the edge of the branch. The snake extends the anterior portion of its body, but as it does so, the body follows a constant path (like lateral undulation, but unlike tunnel concertina locomotion). It then forms anterior grips and pulls the body forward, again demonstrating the &#x27;path following&#x27; characteristic. Unlike tunnel concertina locomotion, this mode avoids any obstacle which falls between the bends of the snake&#x27;s body. However, it is exceptionally slow, with snakes rarely moving faster than 2% of their length per second.

Some snakes, such as the brown tree snake, use a &quot;lasso-climbing&quot; or &quot;lasso locomotion&quot; technique to climb vertically by wrapping around the vertical object, including poles intended to stop predators.

<text>Lurch (whose first name is unknown) is a fictional character created by American cartoonist Charles Addams as a butler to the Addams Family. In the original television series, Lurch was played by Ted Cassidy.

==Cartoons==
In Charles Addams&#x27;s original cartoons, Lurch is often seen accompanying the rest of the Family, sometimes carrying a feather-duster. In a couple of illustrations, the Family is seen decorating Lurch as they would a Christmas tree.

==Characterization==

Lurch is a 6 ft 9 in (2.05 m) tall, shambling, gloomy butler. In the original &quot;Addams Family&quot; television series, Lurch has a deep and resonant voice. Although fully capable of normal speech, Lurch often communicates via simple inarticulate moans, which, much like the dialogue of Cousin Itt, his employers have no trouble understanding. In the book &quot;The Addams Family: An Evilution&quot;, Charles Addams states:

This towering mute has been shambling around the house forever. He is not a very good butler, but a faithful one. He is often sent on local errands to pick the awful herbs from the garden, for instance, but will often forget the most important ingredient of all, say Eye of Newt. He is shamefaced about his oversight and the object of good-natured ridicule from the family. The children are his favorites and [he] guards them against good influences at all times. One eye is opaque; the scanty hair is damply clinging to his narrow, flat head. He will gladly undertake to dump the boiling oil on the carol singers, but, generally, the family treats him as something of a joke.

Like any butler, Lurch tries to help around the house, but occasionally his great size and strength cause trouble. He clearly takes pride in his work and is willing to do even the most arduous task. (In the dénouement of &quot;Lurch&#x27;s Little Helper&quot;, patting a crowbar meaningfully, he declares that his putative helper, Robby the Robot, has &quot;Retired.&quot;) 

His character often demonstrates signs of frustration towards his employers; however, his continued presence also suggests loyalty. As a result, he appears to be one of the family.

The family summons him with an ever-present bell pull (in the form of a hangman&#x27;s noose). When pulled, it produces a loud gong noise that shakes the house, to which Lurch instantly appears and responds, &quot;You... rang?&quot;, even if wide-angle shots reveal that he was clearly nowhere in the vicinity before; on a few occasions Lurch arrives even &quot;before&quot; the bell pull is tugged.

Lurch largely shares the family&#x27;s macabre standards, although he occasionally looks askance at some of their activities. He has a similar attitude toward visitors – almost a sixth sense. When a plainclothes policeman named Mr. Hollister (portrayed by George N. Neise) visits in &quot;The Addams Family Meets the Undercover Man&quot;, Lurch pats him down and removes his service revolver from inside his suit coat. Although Lurch groans disapprovingly at the idea of someone bringing a weapon into the house, he returns the gun after Hollister shows his badge.

==Backstory==
Much of Lurch&#x27;s history, including his first name and the nature of his relationship to any other Addamses, was originally unspecified. &quot;Lurch&quot; was revealed during the original TV series to be a surname, as there was a &quot;Mother Lurch&quot; who appeared in one episode (portrayed by Ellen Corby). She addressed Lurch as &quot;Sonny&quot;, which could either be a parental nickname or his actual first name. As for his father, he was mentioned twice, once in the second animated series. In an apparent reference to his Frankenstein&#x27;s monster–like appearance, Lurch said, smiling, &quot;He put me together.&quot; Another time in the original series Lurch mentions his father wanted him to be a jockey (typically short and light people) instead of a butler.

It was stated in &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; that Lurch is part Addams. This plays into his being a creation similar to Frankenstein&#x27;s monster. The only definite body part that is from an Addams is his heart. Lurch&#x27;s mother appears to be a physically normal, elderly woman, although she does not see anything unusual about the Addams family or their home, with the exception of Thing.

In &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; episode &quot;Morticia and the Lady&#x27;s League&quot;, a woman comments to Morticia about Lurch by asking &quot;Where did you dig him up?&quot; Morticia responds by stating &quot;Funny, I can&#x27;t remember which cemetery it was.&quot; Lurch is also referenced as having &quot;two left feet&quot; which, in the context of the series, could be taken literally or as a reference to his apparent inability to dance (though he tries in the original series).

In 2019 animated film, Lurch was an escaped mental patient from an abandoned haunted house (now, the Addams Mansion) and met Gomez, Morticia, and Thing whereupon they immediately hired him as their loyal butler.

==Influence==
On October 30, 1965, a song and dance based on Lurch, entitled &quot;The Lurch&quot;, were introduced on the ABC music program &quot;Shindig!&quot;. This mirrored an earlier episode of the television series, entitled &quot;Lurch, the Teenage Idol&quot; (which was remade in 1999 for &quot;The New Addams Family&quot;). In it, Lurch records a song on his harpsichord and becomes a pop sensation. In real life, actor Ted Cassidy released a single of &quot;The Lurch&quot; and performed it on the &quot;Shindig!&quot; episode in character as Lurch (in the same instalment, Cassidy, out of character this time, also performed a ballad).

During the 2018–2019 NBA season, analyst and former player Shaquille O&#x27;Neal began using Lurch&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;You Rang&quot; to refer to Philadelphia 76ers backup center Boban Marjanovic, due to a perceived physical resemblance between Marjanovic and Lurch.

==Adaptations==
===Live-action TV series===
Lurch appears in &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, portrayed by Ted Cassidy. He is physically imposing and plays a harpsichord that was originally in Cousin Crimp&#x27;s family for 400 years.

Cassidy made a cameo appearance as Lurch in the &quot;Batman&quot; episode &quot;The Penguin&#x27;s Nest&quot;. As Batman and Robin are climbing the wall of Penguin&#x27;s restaurant, the Addams Family theme is heard in the background. Lurch pops his head out of the window, sees Batman and Robin, and comments that they gave him quite a start. Batman tells Lurch that he can return to his harpsichord as Robin states that they are on official business.

Lurch appears in &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; portrayed by John DeSantis.

In the 2022 series &quot;Wednesday&quot;, Lurch appears briefly and is performed by Romanian actor George Burcea. Additionally, the line “you rang?” is referenced by Tyler when Wednesday rings a bell to summon him at the coffee shop.

===Animated TV series===
Ted Cassidy, who at the time was a regular voice actor for Hanna-Barbera Productions, reprised his role of Lurch in 1972 for HB&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot; episode &quot;Wednesday is Missing&quot;. He is the one who finds Mystery Inc.&#x27;s Mystery Machine stuck in the mud outside the Addams Family house and takes them inside where Gomez and Morticia hire them to be the housekeepers while they are away at the Okefenokee Swamp. By the end of the episode, Lurch helps the Mystery Machine out of the mud.

Ted Cassidy later reprised his role of Lurch in the 1973 cartoon adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, which was also produced by Hanna-Barbera.

Lurch appears in the 1990s adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; voiced by Jim Cummings. In this version he is shown to have blue skin. The episode &quot;Girlfriendstein&quot; gives Lurch&#x27;s shoe size as 27QQQQ.

===Films===

Lurch appears in the 1991 film adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; portrayed by Carel Struycken. He never speaks audibly but groans recurrently. He is seen assisting Morticia by going through the wardrobe of the late Uncle Knick-Knack. Lurch was present when Abigail Craven brings her son Gordon disguised as the long-lost Uncle Fester to the Addams Family mansion. When Tully Alford persuades Judge George Womack to grant the ownership of the house to Uncle Fester and have a restraining order that causes the rest of the family to be evicted, Lurch joins the rest of the family in moving in to a hotel. Seven months later after Craven and Alford are defeated, Lurch answers the door on Halloween where he unintentionally scares away the trick or treaters. At the end of the film, he joins the Addams Family in playing &quot;Wake the Dead&quot; where they work to awaken the zombies of the dead relatives.

Lurch appears in the sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; portrayed again by Struycken. He was present at the hospital when Morticia gives birth to Pubert Addams. In one of Wednesday and Pugsley&#x27;s plots to dispose of Pubert, they drop him and a bowling ball off the roof where Pubert falls into Gomez&#x27; arms and the bowling ball hits Lurch on the head. When Debbie Jellinsky plans to kill the family, Lurch was among those strapped to the electric chair. At the end of the movie, Lurch plays &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; on the harpsichord for Pubert&#x27;s first birthday party.

Lurch appears in &quot;Addams Family Reunion&quot; portrayed again by Struycken, who was the only cast member from the first two films to return for the third, though he did not continue in the role in &quot;The New Addams Family&quot; TV series that followed.

Lurch appears in the animated film adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (2019), voiced by Conrad Vernon. This version is a patient from the abandoned State Asylum for the Criminally Insane who Gomez, Morticia, and Thing hit with their car after relocating to New Jersey. As Lurch recovers, Gomez and Morticia take him in as their butler. The abandoned asylum becomes the Addams Family&#x27;s home. Lurch sing &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot;, voiced by Fuzz Finnegan.

Lurch appears in &quot;The Addams Family 2&quot; portrayed again by Vernon while his singing voice was provided by Dominic Lewis. He accompanies the Addams Family on a road trip while Grandmama keeps an eye on the house. Lurch later finds out that Wednesday is planning to meet with Cyrus Strange after Cyrus&#x27; lawyer Mr. Mustela claims that Wednesday is Cyrus&#x27; daughter. He and Wednesday were able to get a ride to Cyrus&#x27; house with help from some bikers who were impressed with Lurch&#x27;s performance of Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. During the conflict with Cyrus Strange, it is revealed that Lurch knew Cyrus and Mustela&#x27;s minion Pongo who was also in the same asylum with Lurch. Thanks to some gestures from Lurch, Pongo is persuaded to turn against Cyrus. After Cyrus was defeated, Lurch returns home with the Addams Family as Gomez makes plans for a trip around the world.

===Musical===
Lurch appears in the stage musical adaptation of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; portrayed by Zachary James in the original Broadway production, Tom Corbeil in the US National Tour production, and Laughlin Grace in other tour productions. He is present during a gathering of the Addams Family and their relatives. Lurch later ushers the Beinekes into the Addams Family mansion. By the end of the musical, Lurch surprises everyone by singing out loud for the first time.

<doc id="930476" wikidata="Q1109410" url="?curid=930476" title="Joey Potter">
<text>Josephine &quot;Joey&quot; Lynn Potter (born 1983) is a fictional character in the WB television drama &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, played by Katie Holmes. Joey is the only principal character to appear in all episodes of the series, which ran from 1998 to 2003.

Joey, created by Kevin Williamson based on a childhood friend, is a tomboyish teenager growing up in the fictional town of Capeside in Massachusetts. The series chronicles her journey from adolescence into adulthood, focusing in particular on her complex and evolving relationship with childhood friend Dawson Leery (James Van Der Beek).

==Background==
In an official companion book for the show, Joey Potter is described as &quot;a headstrong, vibrant, wily, sultry, and determined go-getter. And yet, in a gloriously contradictory manner, in spite of her tough-as-nails exterior demeanor, Joey&#x27;s also a frail, sometimes uncertain, emotionally sensitive, in-need-of-love person.&quot;

Joey has been best friends with Dawson Leery since they were in third grade, and considers him &quot;her family.&quot; She spent much of her early childhood at the Leery house, and Dawson was a constant comforting presence during traumatic events in her childhood. Joey&#x27;s mother had died of breast cancer when Joey was thirteen and her father, Mike (Gareth Williams), was in prison for drug trafficking. Joey is raised by her unmarried and pregnant sister Bessie (Nina Repeta), who is about ten years older than Joey and runs the Ice House restaurant where Joey works as a waitress.

Dawson and Joey spend many nights bonding over films and TV shows in his bedroom, which Joey accesses via a ladder into his room. She has also known Pacey Witter her whole life, though they only tolerate each other due to their friendships with Dawson until high school.

== Character arc ==

===Season 1===
In season one, Joey is the &quot;girl next door.&quot; She is confused by her growth into a teenager and her developing feelings for her longtime best friend Dawson, who believes he is her soulmate.

She immediately becomes jealous when Jen Lindley arrives and steals Dawson&#x27;s attention. She is intimidated by Jen, who grew up in New York, and feels competitive with her. She lives with her pregnant sister Bessie and works for her at the Ice House, the Potter family restaurant. She is frustrated with having to deal with work and taking care of her sister along with significant helpings of teenage angst. Nonetheless, Joey manages to be helpful with the birth of Bessie&#x27;s son, Alexander, as does their critical neighbor, Evelyn Ryan (Mary Beth Peil). One day she is convinced to compete in a local beauty pageant so she can win the prize, which is a scholarship for college tuition. She ultimately does not win the pageant, but when she sings the song &quot;On My Own&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot; on stage, Dawson finally sees past his &quot;best friend&quot; image of Joey and recognizes her romantic feelings towards him. At the end of the season, she receives the opportunity to spend her summer in Paris, but rejects it in favor of staying in Capeside with Dawson after she and Dawson kiss.

===Season 2===
At the start of the season, she and Dawson begin dating, but Joey struggles with figuring out her own identity outside of their relationship. During a full moon, her co-worker Jack McPhee kisses her. Dawson finds out during a school dance and punches Jack. Distraught, Joey seeks Dawson out to apologize, but also decides she needs to take a break from him to &quot;find herself&quot;.

Joey immediately throws herself into a relationship with Jack, which becomes confusing when Jack is outed as gay. Joey begins to lean on Dawson for support as Jack struggles and eventually confirms his sexuality to Joey. Joey struggles with readjusting to single life. Joey&#x27;s father is released from prison and comes back into her life. At first, this change is uneasy, but the two heal their rift.

After Dawson supports Joey through this uneasy period, she apologizes to him, thanks him for putting up with her, and kisses him. Their reignited relationship is put at risk, however, when Dawson finds out that Joey&#x27;s father is dealing cocaine. After a fire at the restaurant which was started by rivals of Joey&#x27;s father, Dawson tells his parents who advise him he needs to go to the police. He tells Joey first and convinces her to work with the police, and she eventually agrees and gets a confession from her father by wearing a wire.

Feeling guilt at betraying her father, she lashes out at Dawson. She breaks up with him and tells him she doesn&#x27;t even want to know him and that she will never forgive him.

===Season 3===
After Dawson returns from visiting his mom over the summer, Joey regrets breaking up with him and offers herself to him. However, Dawson rejects her, fearing another blowout will wreck their friendship permanently. Dawson asks Pacey Witter to keep an eye on the dejected Joey.

Joey takes a job at a Logan&#x27;s Marina, where she receives unwanted sexual advances from her supervisor, Rob Logan.

Joey struggles with Dawson keeping his distance from her and attempts to heal the rift in their shaky friendship. Meanwhile, she finds herself progressively spending more time with Pacey. Joey has a brief relationship with a college student, A.J. Moller (Robin Dunne). This relationship makes Pacey jealous, and after she breaks up with A.J., Pacey declares his feelings for Joey and kisses her. Though Joey is initially angry at Pacey for kissing her with no warning, she forgives him after he apologizes for potentially putting their friendship at risk.

Pacey joins Dawson, Joey, and Andie on a spring break trip to the home of Dawson&#x27;s aunt, Gwen (Gail&#x27;s sister). Blossoming tension between Pacey and Joey prompts Pacey to ask Joey whether she reciprocates his feelings. Joey admits she felt a spark after he kissed her, which leads Pacey to kiss her again. They are caught by Aunt Gwen, but she keeps their secret while also warning Joey not to be careless with Dawson&#x27;s heart. Though Joey is fearful of hurting Dawson, she realizes she cannot fight her feelings and embraces Pacey in a kiss. The two begin a secret romantic relationship.

Joey grows more anxious the longer the relationship is kept secret. When Jen accidentally tells Dawson first, he reacts furiously. Dawson confronts her and Pacey, ends his friendship with Pacey, and gives Joey an ultimatum between dating Pacey and saving her friendship with him. Joey tearfully ends things with Pacey in an effort to preserve her lifelong friendship with Dawson, leaving all three of the friends alone and devastated.

Dawson and Joey begin to converse again; however, Joey is dismayed that Dawson considers his friendship with Pacey forever destroyed. Dawson decides to win Joey back by competing in a sailing race with Pacey and throwing an alternative prom with Joey as his date. However, when Dawson witnesses Joey and Pacey share a romantic dance, he leaves devastated.

In the season finale, Joey confesses to Dawson that whilst she considers their friendship her first priority, if she thought he might forgive her then she might have continued to pursue a romantic relationship with Pacey. Dawson eventually urges Joey to follow her heart, and Joey rushes off to tell Pacey that she is in love with him before he departs for a summer at sea on his boat. She joins Pacey aboard his boat, the True Love, and the two then sail off into the sunset.

===Season 4===
Joey returns to Capeside with Pacey from their summer at sea, madly in love but growing more and more preoccupied with thoughts of Dawson. Joey reaches out to Dawson with a symbolic present, and although it appears he is moving on from the coupling up of his two best friends, he appears disinterested in repairing their friendship and unsure if he wants Joey in his life at all, which leaves her devastated and determined to fix their lifelong friendship.

Joey discovers Pacey has returned to academic probation after irresponsibly skipping summer school, while Joey dreams of admittance to the fictional Worthington College in Boston. Joey and Pacey&#x27;s relationship begins to become strained by Joey&#x27;s determination to rebuild her friendship with Dawson and her prioritization of his feelings over their relationship. She struggles with watching Dawson move on romantically with Gretchen, Pacey&#x27;s older sister. She is eventually relieved and delighted when Dawson starts to soften his stance and confiding in her again.

On a ski trip with the senior class, Joey finally gives in and sleeps with Pacey. She later runs into Dawson whilst walking through Capeside, and is delighted when he agrees to spend the night with her walking around Capeside and talking. Dawson eventually asks her if she has slept with Pacey, which Joey denies.

Gretchen discovers Joey&#x27;s lie and confronts her over it, to which Joey reacts defensively and possessively. Gretchen also informs Pacey, which further strains his relationship with Joey.

Joey is admitted to the prestigious Worthington College but discovers she won’t receive enough financial aid. When Dawson offers to front her a payment from Mr. Brooks&#x27; inheritance, she admits to Dawson she lied about having slept with Pacey. Dawson accepts her apology, reaffirming the survival and importance of their bond. She accepts the money from Dawson to attend Worthington.

After Joey returns from a trip to New York with Jen, she discovers from Gretchen that Pacey was arrested for public drunkenness. She also suspects she may be pregnant. Bessie learns about Joey&#x27;s pregnancy scare and argues with her, claiming she is not ready to have a baby if she is pregnant and that she has an immature boyfriend. Joey defends herself by saying that whatever happens in her life will be different compared to Bessie&#x27;s path to early motherhood. Joey learns from a pregnancy test that she is not pregnant, but the situation draws the sisters closer together. When Joey finally reaches Pacey on the phone, she doesn’t tell him about the pregnancy scare, while he does not tell her about his arrest.

Pacey grows increasingly frustrated by the belief that he’s holding Joey back from her ambitions, and grows more insecure over his perceived &quot;worthlessness&quot; in their relationship. After seeing Dawson and Joey dancing happily at prom, Pacey explodes at Joey in front of all their peers, leaving her crying and embarrassed. She and Pacey end their relationship. She seeks solace in her reignited friendship with Dawson, and is disappointed that Pacey leaves for the Caribbean as a crew member on a boat.

During the month after graduation, Joey starts to get over Pacey but becomes increasingly dismayed at Dawson’s impending departure for California, where he will be attending film school. On Dawson’s last night in Capeside, he and Joey both feel underwhelmed at their initial goodbye and seek each other out.

After watching &quot;E.T.&quot; and reminiscing about the highs and lows of the last four years, Joey tearfully confesses her appreciation for Dawson and their friendship; somehow their bond survived everything, including her failed relationship with Pacey. She declares him incredible, compares their friendship to magic, and asks him to stay. He gently reinforces his need to get out of Capeside and start living his life, and they share a goodbye kiss.

===Season 5===
Joey begins her first semester at Worthington University in Boston, where she meets and tolerates her new roommate Audrey Liddell (Busy Philipps). Joey and Dawson remain in touch but struggle with interpreting their complicated friendship after their goodbye kiss. Dawson eventually drops out of USC to move to Boston, which leaves Joey excited about the future. Meanwhile Joey discovers Pacey&#x27;s presence in Boston and greets him, wanting to try to be friends again and reintegrate him into their friendship group.

Throwing everyone for a loop, Mitch is killed in a car accident. Joey attempts to support a struggling Dawson as he makes arrangements and holds things together for his family. Joey’s attempts at comforting Dawson clash with his needs, and he asks to be alone. Upon returning to her dorm room in Boston, a crying Joey is comforted by Audrey.

Joey struggles to support Dawson in the coming months and becomes worried when he begins pulling away and leaning on Jen for support. Whilst Jen and Dawson are away for the weekend, Joey catches Jack in a plan to get one of his fraternity brothers in bed with Audrey during the frat&#x27;s Winter Formal. At a group dinner, she is shocked and secretly devastated when the gang catches Dawson and Jen returning from a blissful weekend away together, whereupon it is concluded they have slept together. Joey confronts Dawson over their failing friendship and is devastated when he confirms he needs space away from her.

Joey later joins the band, Aggressive Mediocrity, as lead singer with Jen&#x27;s cheating ex, Charlie Todd (Chad Michael Murray). They embark on a whirlwind romance before she tells him to leave to pursue his dream of being a touring musician. She has an unforgettable run-in with a mugger who gets hit by a car shortly after robbing her at gunpoint. However, when she is requested to be at his side in the hospital, Joey discovers that the mugger is also a drug addict, and has a young daughter, Sammie, with his wife, Grace. When the mugger dies with Joey at his side, she returns to the waiting room, all of her belongings returned, including the money. Thinking of Sammie, whose situation reminds her of the relationship she has with her own father, Joey leaves all the money hidden in Grace&#x27;s backpack.

In the aftermath of the incident, Joey is delighted when a concerned and terrified Dawson begins spending time with her again, and she eventually confides in him about her complicated relationship with her professor. Their friendship blooms further after his relationship with Jen ends, and she urges him to join her and their friends for spring break in Florida.

After the semester ends, Joey returns to Capeside with Audrey in tow, and is shocked to discover Dawson had traveled to Florida to reignite their romantic relationship over spring break. Her delight is mellowed by news that Dawson is returning to L.A, and when she confronts Dawson over Florida and he confesses to her that his feelings for her have returned, she rejects him out of fear of holding him back from his life.

After reading a goodbye note Dawson left for her, she rushes to the airport to intercept him, declaring her love for him but convincing him to go start his life. She passionately kisses him and sends him off. As she goes to get a refund for her gate ticket, she is again offered the chance to go to Paris, and the audience is left hanging.

===Season 6===
It is revealed that Joey didn&#x27;t end up going to Paris, but went home to Capeside. She had a fling but ended it after he declared he liked her. She hangs out with her friends and is surprised that no one has remembered her birthday. After not talking all summer, she and Dawson meet up and have an incredibly romantic evening. After Dawson surprises her with a birthday present, they kiss and end up sleeping together multiple times over the next day.

After spending the day together, Joey discovers Dawson has had a casual relationship whilst in California. Despite having her own summer fling, Joey freaks out and uses it as an excuse to push him away again, leaving them both devastated. She later caters his film set and nearly gets him fired. They tearfully part ways, hoping with time and space they will be able to salvage their friendship.

She takes a job as a waitress at Hell&#x27;s Kitchen, with the help of aspiring drummer, Emma Jones. Joey eventually falls for the bartender, Eddie Doling (Oliver Hudson). They both have a love for writing and literature, but it turns out that he is not officially a student at Worthington, as his family was too poor to afford the tuition.

At Christmas, Joey brings Eddie to the Leery household, where an intoxicated Audrey calls out her, Dawson, and Pacey&#x27;s complicated history. Dawson and Joey share their first conversation in months, finding solace in each other’s company.

After Christmas, Eddie disappears without telling Joey, going back to Worcester to live with his parents. In trying to find him, Joey gets some help from Harley Hetson—the 15-year-old, alienated, headstrong daughter of her snobbish and somewhat misogynist English professor, Greg Hetson (Roger Howarth), whom Joey clashes with several times during the entire season. Harley lies, telling Eddie that Joey was pregnant with his child in order to lure him back to Boston.

Joey and Pacey share a kiss at his apartment during a party. After being locked overnight in a K-Mart together, they discuss their past and current relationship. How they feel uncomfortable talking about sex with each other or how they never discuss their past and how the fact they never had closure impacts them. In an intimate moment Joey shaves his beard. When they go to sleep she tells him a fantasy she had when she was a teenager. In the fantasy they would be castaways in an idyllic island, living their love away from everyone. They share a bittersweet kiss after her confession. Each admits that they miss the other.

However, when Eddie returns from California, Joey ends things with Pacey and reunites with him. Soon, she realizes things are not working with Eddie and the best thing for her is to spend sometime alone thinking about her life.

Joey returns to Capeside and is delighted to read Dawson’s new screenplay. She visits the Leery house and reignites her friendship with Dawson. After a great day together, she is devastated at Paceys revelation of losing Dawson’s money. She tries to keep them calm, but they explode at each other again, reigniting their years-old feud and leaving all three alone and devastated once again.

Joey takes it upon herself to pick up a devastated and despondent Dawson and manages to gather enough hands and equipment for him to begin production. When Pacey tries to use her as an in-between to give him money, Joey refuses to get in the middle again. She spends her last night in Capeside with Dawson, before finally flying to Paris. Before leaving she secretly schemes to get Pacey and Dawson together, hoping her absence will help them to finally repair their friendship without her in the middle.

====Series finale====

The final two episodes are set approximately five years after the season finale. Joey is a junior editor living in New York with her writer boyfriend, Christopher (Jeremy Sisto). Joey returns to Capeside for Gail Leery&#x27;s wedding to her new husband, which her old high school friends are attending.

The five friends reunite at Pacey&#x27;s restaurant to reminisce about the past. Afterwards, Joey once again finds herself at Dawson&#x27;s house, feeling like she didn’t get enough alone time with her oldest friend. The two talk at length about their lives and relationships, cementing their friendship once again. She sleeps over, like she has so many times before, before leaving to prepare for the wedding.

During Gail&#x27;s wedding reception, Joey and Pacey kiss (reigniting lingering feelings between the two), but the moment is interrupted when Jen collapses. It is later discovered that Jen has a deadly heart condition. The night she finds out, she and Dawson comfort each other.

Joey, Pacey and Dawson each play important roles in Jen&#x27;s last days. Joey comforts a distraught Dawson after he helps Jen film a video for her daughter Amy, whilst Jen insists Joey deal with her feelings and decide what she wants once and for all. Joey ends her relationship with Christopher. She finds herself at Pacey&#x27;s restaurant and the two have an honest conversation. Whilst he is prepared to let her go, she stops him. Joey tells him that she loves Dawson, she acknowledges that he is her soulmate, he is tied to her childhood, a love that is pure, eternally innocent and necessary to her life.

She also confesses her love for Pacey, which confuses him. They are interrupted before she can clarify.

Joey visits Dawson at the Leery house, where he is crying whilst remembering Jen&#x27;s first day in Capeside. The two discuss work, love, and life, and both verbalise the importance of their bond to their lives. Dawson acknowledges that whether or not they end up together - &quot;In some ungodly way... its always gonna be you and me&quot;. Joey declares Dawson her soulmate, and as they watch her nephew and his younger sister play like Joey and Dawson did so many years ago, Joey tearfully tells him she loves him. He reciprocates, and through her tears she declares -

“You and me, always.”

They smile and cry, delighted that their childhood bond has survived the complications of growing up.

—EPILOGUE—

Weeks later, whilst watching the season finale of “The Creek” from Joey&#x27;s New York apartment, it is revealed that Joey and Pacey have reconciled and are apparently living together.

They call Dawson immediately after, having reconciled their friendships. Dawson reveals that tomorrow he is going to meet his hero, Steven Spielberg, and Pacey and Joey converse ecstatically with him as the camera pans to a photograph of Dawson, Joey, Jen and Pacey from Season 4.

==Holmes&#x27; thoughts on Joey Potter==

Actress Katie Holmes has said she related to Joey and that the producers acknowledged the similarities. Holmes said, &quot;I think [the producers] saw that. I come from a small town. I was a tomboy. Joey tries to be articulate and deny that she doesn&#x27;t have a lot of experience in life. Her life parallels mine, which is all about new everything—relationships, personal perceptions—and about being guarded.&quot; Holmes filmed the pilot of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in Wilmington, North Carolina, during spring break of her senior year of high school in 1997. When the show was picked up by The WB, Holmes moved to Wilmington, where the show filmed.

Holmes admitted she struggled with the show&#x27;s trademark hyper-articulate dialogue, saying, &quot;Sometimes before we read a script, I have to get my dictionary and call people to make sure I&#x27;m pronouncing some of the words correctly.&quot; The show brought her stardom abroad and in her hometown of Toledo, Ohio, where she was named grand marshal of the Thanksgiving Day parade in November 1998.

Holmes is the only actor to appear in all 128 episodes of &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. When the series ended, Holmes commented, &quot;It was very difficult for me to leave Wilmington, to have my little glass bubble burst and move on. I hate change. On the other hand it was refreshing to play someone else.&quot; Holmes confirmed that, as often happens on soaps, the character was a caricature of the actor:

==Reception==

In 2002, &quot;GQ&quot; described Joey as &quot;kind of an uptight fussbudget—one who&#x27;s always twisted up over doing the right thing and bungling-up ways to hook up with her crush and across the creek neighbor, Dawson.&quot; Holmes was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in September 1998. In a review of the series pilot, &quot;Variety&quot; said Holmes &quot;is a confident young performer who delivers her lines with slyness and conviction.&quot;

&quot;Life&quot; magazine commented, &quot;As Joey, Holmes has had seismic influences on teen life... Through it all, Joey has managed to hang on to her integrity... The show—and Katie&#x27;s character in particular—has touched a nerve.&quot; Critics have argued, &quot;Joey Potter, the tomboyish underdog who lost her mother to cancer and her father to jail, became the show’s anchor,&quot; a turning point that was marked, according to show writer Jeffrey Stepakoff, by Greg Berlanti&#x27;s suggestion to have Pacey and Joey kiss in season 3. Writers have also noted how Joey&#x27;s character arc begins with a very deferential relationship to Dawson, gradually evolving to the point where she ultimately realizes her own agency and independence.

Joey&#x27;s season 3 arc with Pacey Witter is often praised in pop culture as being one of the top TV romances. &quot;Jezebel&quot; said &quot;their screwball dynamic, coupled with [the] actors&#x27;...untapped chemistry and an intricately plotted courtship subverted everything expected of the show. It unsurprisingly still resonates with so many millennial women who grew up watching the series. There was a time when we had come for the angst, but now we were staying for the romance.&quot; They were also included in &quot;TV Guide&quot;&#x27;s list of &quot;The Best TV Couples of All Time.&quot;

<text>A collegiate university is a university where functions are divided between a central administration and a number of constituent colleges. Historically, the first collegiate university was the University of Paris and its first college was the Collège des Dix-Huit. The two principal forms are residential college universities, where the central university is responsible for teaching and colleges may deliver some teaching but are primarily residential communities, and federal universities where the central university has an administrative (and sometimes examining) role and the colleges may be residential but are primarily teaching institutions. The larger colleges or campuses of federal universities, such as University College London and University of California, Berkeley, are effectively universities in their own right and often have their own student unions.

For universities with residential colleges, the principal difference between these and non-collegiate halls of residence (or dormitories) is that &quot;colleges are societies (Latin &quot;collegia&quot;), not buildings&quot;. This is expressed in different ways in different universities; commonly students are members of a college, not residents of a college, and remain members whether they are living in the college or not, but this is not universal and the distinction may be drawn in other ways (see, e.g., the University of Otago below). Residential colleges also commonly have members drawn from the university&#x27;s academic staff in order to form a whole academic community. Students in residential colleges are often organised into a junior common room, with postgraduate students in a middle common room, and academic staff forming a senior common room.

==History==
The development of the collegiate university in western Europe followed shortly after the development of the medieval university itself. The first college to be established was the Collège des Dix-Huit at the University of Paris, founded in 1180 by John of London shortly after he had returned from Jerusalem. This has led to the suggestion that the college was inspired by madrasas he saw on his travels, although this has been disputed, particularly as, unlike madrasas, the early Paris colleges did not teach. Other colleges appeared in Paris shortly after this, including the College of St Thomas du Louvre (1186) and the College of the Good Children of St Honore (1208–1209) – although these may both have had more of the character of grammar schools than colleges of the university – various monastic colleges starting with the Dominicans in 1217, and the College of Sorbonne for non-monastic theology students in 1257. From Paris, the idea spread to Oxford, where William of Durham, who had been a Regent Master of Theology at Paris, left a legacy to found University College, Oxford in 1249. Although this is taken as the foundation date of University College, it was not until after 1280 that the college actually began operating. At around the same time Balliol College was founded by John de Balliol via a grant of land in 1263 as a penance imposed by the Bishop of Durham, and Merton College was founded with an endowment by Walter de Merton in 1264.

These original Oxford colleges were &quot;merely endowed boardinghouses for impoverished scholars&quot;, and were limited to those who had already received their Bachelor of Arts degree and were reading for higher degrees (usually theology). It was not until 1305 that teaching started in the College of Navarre in Paris, an innovation that reached Oxford in 1379 with the foundation of New College – also the first college there to take undergraduate students. In Bologna and other Italian universities, the colleges, as Rashdall put it, &quot;remained to the last (what all Colleges were originally intended to be) eleemosynary institutions for the help of poor students, boarding-houses and not places of education&quot; and never acquired the same importance as the colleges of Oxford or Paris.

Colleges evolved in different directions in different places, but many European universities lost their colleges in the early 18th century. At the University of Coimbra, for example, many colleges were established in the 16th century, although these were limited to the study of theology with the other faculties remaining non-collegiate. These colleges, joined by others in the 17th and 18th centuries, persisted until 1834, when they (along with the religious orders that ran then) were suppressed following the Portuguese civil war. The colleges of Paris were closed along with the university itself and the rest of the French universities after the French Revolution, as were the colleges of the University of Salamanca.

While the continental universities retained control over their colleges, in England it was the colleges that came to dominate the universities. The Hebdomadal Board was established by William Laud at Oxford in 1631 with the intent of diluting the influence of Congregation (the assembly of regent masters) and Convocation (the assembly of all graduates). This led to criticism in the 19th century, with William Hamilton alleging that the colleges had unlawfully usurped the functions of the universities as the tutors had taken over the teaching from the professors. Royal Commissions in the 1850s led to Acts of Parliament in 1854 (for Oxford) and 1856 (for Cambridge) that, among other measures, limited the power of the colleges.

Prior to these reforms, however, the first two new universities in England for over 600 years were established, both offering new versions of the collegiate university. The University of Durham was founded in 1832, taking Oxford for its model, and University College, Durham was created at the same time. This college, unlike those of Oxford and Cambridge, was not legally distinct from the university and nor was it responsible for teaching, which was carried out by university professors rather than college tutors. This restored the teaching role of the central university that had been lost at Oxford and Cambridge and the original role of the college as a residential rather than educational institution (c.f. Rashdall&#x27;s comments on the Bologna colleges, above). It also pioneered the concept of residential colleges being owned by the university rather than being established as independent corporations, which provided a useful model for modern institutions looking to establish colleges. Unlike the earlier foundation of Trinity College Dublin, which had been established as &quot;the mother of a university&quot; but to which no other colleges had ever been added, the Durham system allowed for the university itself to found further colleges, which it did with the establishment of Hatfield College in 1846.

The University of London, founded in 1836, was very different. It was, in its original form, an examining body for affiliated colleges. The first two of these - University College London (UCL; founded 1826) and King&#x27;s College London (founded 1829) were already in existence and resembled non-collegiate &#x27;unitary&#x27; universities, as found in Scotland and continental Europe, except in their lack of degree-awarding powers. There had been much dispute over UCL&#x27;s attempt to gain recognition as a university, and the University of London was designed as a political solution to put an end to this dispute and to enable the students at both UCL and King&#x27;s to receive degrees. It was modelled to a certain extent on Cambridge, where (at that time) the senate of the university was responsible for examinations and the colleges for the teaching, and also took on some features of the University of France, an institution established under Napoleon in 1808 that had absorbed the formerly independent French universities as &quot;academies&quot; within a single university structure. Unlike Oxford and Cambridge, the affiliated colleges of London (which were spread across the country, not confined to London) were not constituent parts of the university and had no say in its running. Another major difference was that both UCL and King&#x27;s were non-residential, providing teaching but not accommodation. This would provide the model for the civic colleges that were established in the major English cities, which later became the redbrick universities. After 1858 the requirement for colleges to be affiliated was dropped and London degrees were available to anyone who could pass the examinations. It was not until 1900 that London, after a period of sustained pressure from the teaching institutions in London, became a federal university. The London pattern spread the idea of the examining university with affiliated colleges around the British Empire, in particular to Canada where the University of Toronto was refounded as an examining university, its teaching arm becoming University College, Toronto, which federated other colleges in the region, and to India, where the universities of Calcutta, Madras and Bombay were founded in 1857, and New Zealand, where the federal University of New Zealand was established in 1874.

A modification of the University of London plan was used for the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland, established in 1850. This took in three newly established colleges: the Queen&#x27;s Colleges of Belfast, Cork and Galway. This was more federal than London, but proved inflexible and was replaced in 1880 by the Royal University of Ireland, which was an examining university based more directly on London. Also in 1880 another federal university, the Victoria University, was established in the north of England to solve the problem of Owen&#x27;s College, Manchester, seeking university status. This originally just took in Owen&#x27;s College, but grew to take in university colleges in Leeds and Liverpool. However, it unravelled in 1903-4 after Birmingham successfully became England&#x27;s first unitary university, with the three colleges all becoming universities in their own right.

The federal University of Wales was created in 1893 as a national university for Wales, taking in pre-existing colleges in Aberystwyth, Cardiff and Bangor that had been preparing students for London degrees. It lasted as a federal university until 2007, when it became a confederal non-membership degree-awarding body. The University of Durham became a very curious federal institution in 1908 – its Durham division was itself collegiate, while its Newcastle division had two independent colleges (Armstrong College, the civic university college affiliated to Durham since its creation in 1871, and the Medical College, which had been affiliated since the 1850s). The two colleges of the Newcastle division were merged in 1937, and Newcastle finally became an independent university in 1963. Similarly, the university college in Dundee, founded 1881, became a college of the University of St Andrews in 1897 before becoming an independent university in 1967.

The idea of the residential college spread to America in the early 20th century, with Harvard and Yale both establishing colleges (called &quot;houses&quot; at Harvard) in the 1930s. Like the Durham colleges, these were colleges established and owned by the universities with only limited involvement in teaching. The American state university systems also developed federal-style universities with autonomous campuses (although normally not legally independent). As these systems often developed from a single original campus, this often became identified as the &#x27;flagship&#x27; campus of the state system.

==Types of collegiate university==

An early typology of British university institutions by the Principal of the University of Edinburgh in 1870 divided them into three types: collegiate (Oxford, Cambridge and Durham), professorial (the Scottish universities – St Andrews, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Edinburgh – and the new colleges in Manchester and London) and non-teaching examination boards (London). However, even at that time drawing hard lines was difficult: Oxford had, until a few years prior to this, been an examination board for its colleges, and Trinity College Dublin combined elements of the collegiate and professorial styles. More recently, the collegiate and federal traditions have been seen as separate in Britain, although both inspired by different aspects of the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge, e.g. &quot;With the partial exception of Durham (and in the twentieth century York, Kent and Lancaster) there has been no serious attempt to create in Britain a collegial tradition in the mode of Oxbridge, but the federal principle has been widely emulated.&quot; Similarly a conference on &quot;The Collegiate Way&quot; in 2014 concentrated entirely on universities with residential colleges (e.g. Oxford, Cambridge, Durham, etc.), making no mention of federal universities. This was in keeping with the idea that &quot;The collegiate way is the notion that a curriculum, a library, a faculty, and students are not enough to make a college. It is an adherence to the residential scheme of things.&quot;

Yet the federal principle has also been called the &quot;Cambridge principle&quot;, and is sometimes seen as essential to a collegiate university. There is also dispute as to what is meant by a federal university: some writers have argued that the distinct feature of a federal system is the separation of teaching and examination, but others see the distinction as being one of governance and distribution of authority. A distinction is sometimes made between &quot;federal universities&quot;, &quot;collegiate universities&quot; (where the college is the primary academic unit, i.e. Oxford and Cambridge) and universities that have residential colleges but where these do not participate in teaching. One definition of a collegiate university states that &quot;it&#x27;s the sense of community within a big environment that&#x27;s the common feature&quot;.

===Collegiate universities with centralised teaching===
In many collegiate universities, the teaching is centrally organised through departments and faculties on a university-wide basis. The level of participation in teaching of colleges in such universities varies: they may provide no formal teaching (e.g. Durham), may provide some teaching to their own students (the Oxbridge model), may provide some teaching that is available university or faculty-wide (e.g. Toronto), or may be responsible for delivering centrally organised, university-wide teaching (e.g. Roehampton). Whatever their role in teaching, almost all are residential communities and they will often have their own halls for meals, libraries, sports teams and societies; such colleges are thus sometimes termed residential colleges. Monash University in Australia has, however, developed a non-residential college model, and New York University has similar &quot;learning communities&quot; to support non-residential students. The specifics of how the collegiate system is organised – whether college membership is necessary for students, whether colleges are legally independent, the role colleges play in admissions, etc. – vary widely between different universities.

While the ancient universities of Oxford and Cambridge consist of independent colleges that supplement the university&#x27;s teaching with their own tutorials, some universities have built colleges that do not provide teaching but still perform much of the housing and social duties. Such colleges are planned, built and funded entirely by the central administration and are thus dependent on it, however they still retain their own administrative structures and have a degree of independence. This system was pioneered at Durham University in the United Kingdom in the 1830s, and has been described as &quot;a far better model for people at other institutions to look to, than are the independent colleges of Oxford and Cambridge&quot;. This has been widely followed in the US, where the colleges at universities such as Harvard, Yale and Princeton are entirely owned by the central university. Some universities, such as the University of Otago in New Zealand, Durham University in the UK and the University of Pavia in Italy have a mix of independent and university-owned (or, in the case of Pavia, state-owned) colleges.

In many collegiate universities, following the pattern of Oxford and Cambridge, membership of a college is obligatory for students, but in others it is either not necessary or only necessary for students in particular faculties, e.g. at the University of Toronto, where the colleges are all associated with the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.

===Non-centralised teaching collegiate universities===
Sometimes, as noted above, referred to as &quot;federal universities&quot;, these are universities where the teaching function is entirely carried out by constituent colleges, which will often have their own faculties and departments. This is represented by examples such as Oxford and Cambridge up to the mid 19th century, the University of Wales from 1893 to 2007, and the University of London from 1900. The level of legal separation – e.g. whether the colleges are separate corporate bodies – varies between universities. As the colleges are primarily teaching institutions, they may not always be residential communities and many are effectively universities in their own right.

Some colleges are part of loose federations that allow them to exercise nearly complete self-governance, and even (as in the case of colleges of the University of London) award their own degrees. Other colleges are not legally separate from their parent university, e.g. the University of the Arts, London (UAL) in the UK and many state university systems in the US. In some US state systems, a &quot;flagship campus&quot; may be identified – often the original campus of the system – which is considered (either officially or informally) to stand above the other campuses in the system (e.g. University of Wisconsin–Madison, University of Colorado Boulder).

Some universities may have centralised teaching but also have colleges that do not access that centralised teaching. Historically, this was the case at Durham University for the medical school and Armstrong College in the late 19th and early 20th century (prior to the formation of a true federal university in 1908) and for University College Stockton from 1994 to 2001. The two colleges of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, which is for the main part a unitary university, currently operate in this manner. This should not be confused with the situation where courses at an independent college are validated by a university but the college does not become part of that university, e.g. the relationship between the New College of the Humanities and Southampton Solent University from 2015 to 2020.

Over time, the level of federation may evolve, particularly as independent colleges grow and seek to establish themselves as universities in their own right. University College London and King&#x27;s College London were for much of the 20th century dependent colleges of the central university, without separate legal identities, and all London colleges received funds through the University of London rather than directly. The trend since the latter half of the 20th century has been for increased decentralisation; taken to its ultimate, this has led some colleges to formally end their relations with the parent university to become degree-awarding universities. Examples include Cardiff University (formerly the University of Wales, Cardiff) and Imperial College London (formerly a college of the University of London). Similarly Newcastle University was part of the federal University of Durham until 1963 and the University of Dundee was a college of the University of St Andrews until 1967. A number of autonomous universities in South Africa were formerly colleges of the University of South Africa. Many of the US state systems started as single campuses but have evolved to become federal systems, and the University of the Philippines similarly started as one campus but is now a system of &quot;constituent universities&quot;.

==Collegiate universities around the world==
There are around 80 universities around the world with residential college systems.

===Argentina===

In Argentina, the first educational institution to host this administrative format was IUNA Instituto Universitario Nacional de las Artes, since 2014 renamed UNA National University of the Arts, in Spanish: UNA - Universidad Nacional de las Artes, established in 1993 as a Collegiate University, incorporation of various national institutions dedicated to the teaching of fine arts.
The origins of the current UNA University lay in the 1875 founding of the National Society of the Stimulus of the Arts by painters Eduardo Schiaffino, Eduardo Sívori, and others. Their guild was rechartered as the National Academy of Fine Arts in 1905 and, then in 1923, on the initiative of painter and academic Ernesto de la Cárcova, created as a department of arts extension education in the University of Buenos Aires, known as the Superior Art School of the Nation in Spanish &quot;Escuela Nacional Superior de las Artes&quot;.

===Australia===

In Australia, many universities have residential college systems, often combining independent (frequently denominational) and university-owned colleges. Some universities also have non-collegiate residences. Collegiate universities include the University of Queensland, the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia, the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne and the University of New South Wales. Monash University runs an unusual &quot;non-residential college&quot; system for students living off-campus.

===Bangladesh===

In Bangladesh, the National University, Bangladesh is a public collegiate university that was established in 1992 by an Act of Parliament as an affiliating university of the country to impart graduate and post-graduate level education to the students through its affiliated colleges, schools and professional institutions throughout the country. It is the second largest university in the world according to enrollment. The headquarters is in Gazipur, on the outskirts of Dhaka. After its establishment, it affiliated association degree awarding colleges, where many of them were previously affiliated by the University of Dhaka, University of Rajshahi and University of Chittagong.

===Canada===

In Canada the University of Toronto has a collegiate system for students in the faculty of Arts and Sciences on its St George campus that took form from the mid 19th century, originally modelled after that of Oxford. Toronto has a mix of independent and dependent colleges, all of which offer academic programmes that are available faculty-wide rather that just to members of that college. While all students of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences on the St George campus are members of one of the colleges, students in other undergraduate faculties (Applied Science and Engineering, Architecture, Landscape and Design, Kinesiology and Physical Education, and Music) are only members of colleges if they live in a college residence, and the University of Toronto Mississauga and University of Toronto Scarborough are non-collegiate.

Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario also has a collegiate model, with five colleges on the Peterborough campus. All students are affiliated to a college.

===China===
A notable collegiate university in Mainland China is The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, which inherits the tradition from The Chinese University of Hong Kong in Shatin, Hong Kong.

===France===
The number of collegiate universities in France has increased over the past years. These include:

* PSL University (Paris Sciences &amp; Lettres), with its constituent colleges or « Grandes Écoles » including, the École normale supérieure - PSL, Collège de France, Chimie ParisTech - PSL, Mines ParisTech - PSL, Université Paris-Dauphine, Observatoire de Paris and the École pratique des hautes études;
* Paris-Saclay University, with its dependent colleges including, the Paris-Saclay Faculty of Sciences and Paris-Saclay Medical School; and constituent colleges or « Grandes Écoles » including, the École normale supérieure Paris-Saclay, CentraleSupélec, AgroParisTech and the Institut d&#x27;optique Graduate School;
* Polytechnic Institute of Paris, with its constituent colleges or « Grandes Écoles » including, the École polytechnique, ENSTA Paris, ENSAE Paris, Télécom Paris and Télécom SudParis;
*Université catholique de Lille, with 5 dependent colleges and 25 constituent colleges.

=== Hong Kong ===

The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) is the only collegiate university in Hong Kong. It is the city&#x27;s second-oldest university and derives its collegiate system from its founding in 1963 as a federation of three originally separate colleges – Chung Chi College, New Asia College, and United College In the beginning, CUHK followed the federal university model, where the three constituent colleges had their own academic departments and conducted teaching separately, while the university handled administration, financial matters, and examinations. However, based on the advice of the Second Fulton Report, the teaching departments of the three colleges were gradually merged from 1976. Teaching and research were centralised under the university and the colleges became academic communities responsible for providing pastoral support and non-formal learning opportunities. Currently, CUHK has expanded from three to nine constituent colleges. All full-time undergraduates and academic staff at the university are affiliated with a college, regardless of whether they reside at the college or not.

The University of Hong Kong (HKU) has an affiliated Anglican college, St John&#x27;s College, which was founded in 1912 and has its own charter. The university also established Robert Black College in 1967 as a university guesthouse. Over the past decade some of the new residential halls were named colleges, including the Lap-Chee College, the Shun Hing College and the Chi Sun College. Centennial College, a provider of post-secondary education, is affiliated with the university. Those not living in the residential colleges do not belong to a college.

The City University of Hong Kong has a Community College, similar to HKU&#x27;s Centennial College, which been in a partnership arrangement with the University of Wollongong since 2014.

===India===



Most of the public universities in India follow the collegiate system. The University of Mumbai, is a collegiate public state university located in the city of Mumbai, Maharashtra, India. The University of Mumbai is one of the largest universities in the world. As of 2013, the university had 711 affiliated colleges. As of 22 November 2021, the UGC lists 441 state universities. The oldest establishment date listed by the UGC is 1857, shared by the University of Calcutta, the University of Madras and the University of Mumbai. Most State Universities are collegiate universities administering many affiliated colleges (often located in small towns) that typically offer a range of undergraduate courses, but may also offer post-graduate courses. More established colleges may even offer PhD programs in some departments with the approval of the affiliating university.

===Ireland===

The only &#x27;ancient university&#x27; in Ireland, North or South, is the University of Dublin. Created during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, it is modelled on the collegiate universities of Cambridge and Oxford. However, only one constituent college was ever founded, hence the curious position of Trinity College, Dublin (TCD), today. All of the teaching is provided by the college, with degrees being awarded by the university. Within the Republic of Ireland, the four constituent universities of the federal National University of Ireland (NUI) are, for all essential purposes, independent universities. The other truly collegiate university in Ireland is Ulster University, which is located in Northern Ireland (see United Kingdom on this list).

===Italy===

In Italy, independent halls of residence known as &#x27;colleges of merit&#x27; operate in a number of university cities, offering tutoring, supplementary teaching, and additional diplomas. The university in which the collegiate model is most developed is the University of Pavia with four independent colleges (including two established in the 16th century: Collegio Borromeo, founded in 1561, and Collegio Ghislieri, founded in 1567) and 12 public colleges. However, neither in Pavia nor in any other Italian university do students have to be members of colleges.

===Macau===

The University of Macau has moved to a residential college system since 2010, when two pilot colleges were established. Further colleges have been founded since, and the university became collegiate in 2014, with 10 colleges in operation.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand the University of Otago has 15 residential colleges, of which one (Abbey College) is postgraduate-only, nine are undergraduate-only and five take both postgraduate and undergraduate students. Most of the colleges are owned and managed by the university, but there are five independent &quot;affiliated colleges&quot; (City College, Knox College, St Margaret&#x27;s College, Salmond College and Selwyn College). Membership of a college is not obligatory for students, and only students in residence count as college members. The colleges manage admission to the college (but not the university) and provide academic tutorials to students.

===Singapore===

The University of the Arts Singapore (UAS) is a publicly-funded private collegiate university in Singapore. It is a federation of two local arts colleges —Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, and LASALLE College of the Arts. It was announced as a planned-university in 2021, and took its present name in 2022.

UAS will be the seventh local university of Singapore, and also will be the only publicly-funded private university other than the defunct and restructured UniSIM in Singapore. UAS will have its own degree-conferring power in Singapore.

===United Kingdom===
There are a number of British universities with colleges of different types. Some are &quot;listed bodies&quot; under the Education Reform Act 1988 legally recognised as &quot;Institutions of a University&quot;, while others are not; colleges of the University of London are &quot;recognised bodies&quot; under the 1988 act that have the right to award degrees of the University of London and (in many cases) their own degrees. Some colleges are legally independent of their parent university, while others are not.

Collegiate universities with centralised teaching and undergraduate teaching in colleges:
* University of Oxford (mostly independent colleges; listed bodies)
* University of Cambridge (independent colleges; listed bodies)

Collegiate universities with centralised teaching and residential-only colleges:
* Durham University (mostly dependent colleges; listed bodies) (with the exception of in-college teaching for ordinands at Cranmer Hall theological college within St John&#x27;s)
* University of York (dependent colleges; not listed bodies)
* Lancaster University (dependent colleges; not listed bodies)
* University of Kent (dependent colleges; not listed bodies)

Collegiate universities with centralised teaching carried out by the colleges:
* Roehampton University (dependent colleges; not listed bodies)

Collegiate universities where all teaching is carried out in the colleges:
* University of London (independent colleges; recognised bodies)
* University of the Arts London (dependent colleges; not listed bodies)
* University of the Highlands and Islands (independent colleges; listed bodies)

Unitary universities with centralised teaching and associated colleges that carry out their own teaching:
* Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (two independent colleges; listed bodies)
* University of South Wales (two dependent colleges including one further education college delivering some higher education courses; listed bodies)
* University of Wales Trinity Saint David (one dependent further education college delivering some higher education courses; listed body)

===United States===

The US has a wide variety of systems. There are a number of universities with residential colleges, most of which are owned by the central university, which may be referred to as residential colleges or as houses. These do not normally participate in formal teaching, although there are exceptions to this. Most collegiate universities in the US were previously non-collegiate but have established residential colleges in the 20th or 21st century. There were around 30 universities with residential colleges in the US in 2010, examples include:
* Harvard University – Established in the 1930s, Harvard&#x27;s house system has 12 residential houses for &quot;upperclass&quot; (second year and above) students, with a 13th non-residential house for students living off campus and postgraduate students. Students are assigned to colleges at the end of their first year.
* Yale University – Also established in the 1930s, Yale&#x27;s residential college system has 14 colleges which follow the traditional British system of students joining a college when they join the university and remaining a member of that college.
* California Institute of Technology – Established in 1931, the house system at the California Institute of Technology has 8 houses for undergraduates, which students are selected into upon completion of a two-week &quot;rotation&quot; process when they first join the university. Students remain members of this house for the duration of their undergraduate education at Caltech, but may seek additional membership in other houses upon a public vote in the target house.
* Rice University – Established in 1957 with four colleges, Rice&#x27;s residential college system now has 11 colleges. Students join a college when they enter the university and retain their membership throughout their time as an undergraduate, with around 75% living in college.
* University of California, Santa Cruz – Beginning in 1965 with the founding of Cowell College, the UC Santa Cruz residential college system has the most established collegiate system on the West Coast. All undergraduate students, whether they live on campus or not, are affiliated with one of 10 residential colleges. 
* University of Notre Dame – Established in the 1960s, the Notre Dame residential college system features 32 halls in which all students are placed freshman year and remain for a minimum of 6 semesters. Students rarely switch halls, each of has its own spirit, coat of arms and colors, traditions, mascot, sport teams, events, dances and reputation. 
* Princeton University – Established in the 1980s, Princeton&#x27;s residential college system has six colleges, three of which house students from all years and the other three only first and second year students. Most students in the third year and above do not live in college accommodation, but retain their links to a college.
* Dartmouth College – Established in 2016, Dartmouth&#x27;s house system has six houses that undergraduates are members of throughout their time at the university.

Many state university systems consist of campuses that are legally part of a single corporation (e.g., the Regents of the University of California is the corporation that owns and operates the entire University of California system), but are operationally independent. Examples of such institutions include the University of California, the State University of New York, the University of Michigan, the University of Texas System. Like UC Santa Cruz, UC San Diego also has a residential college system inspired by the British model. At both campuses, the academic resources are provided primarily by the university, but each residential college follows its own educational philosophy and sets out its own degree requirements.
The Claremont Colleges in California operate a hybrid federal-constituent system. All 7 colleges are independently governed: Pomona College, Scripps College, Claremont McKenna College, Harvey Mudd College, Pitzer College as undergraduate colleges as well as Claremont Graduate University and Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences as graduate universities. Their founding model was based on that of the University of Oxford and they are linked through the Claremont University Consortium, though, unlike other constituent college systems, degrees are conferred separately by the seven constituent institutions and they exist as universities and liberal arts colleges in their own right. The colleges are spread over a square mile site and share certain departmental, library and research facilities. In addition, the five undergraduate colleges operate two intercollegiate athletic programs, with Claremont, Harvey Mudd, and Scripps forming one program and Pomona and Pitzer the other.

===Former collegiate universities===
Some universities that once featured collegiate systems have lost them to mergers or suppression, due to financial, political or other reasons, or (in the case of federal universities) the individual colleges becoming independent universities. Examples include the following:

====Former residential college systems====
*At the University of St Andrews, the surviving colleges play a purely ceremonial role and are neither teaching nor residential bodies. The three colleges are St Mary&#x27;s College for the Faculty of Divinity and United College for the other faculties, and St Leonard&#x27;s College for postgraduates. University College, Dundee was incorporated into St Andrews in 1898 and was merged with the medical school, the dental school and the Dundee School of Economics in 1954 to form Queen&#x27;s College. This became the independent University of Dundee in 1967.
* At the University of Coimbra, independent colleges much like the Oxbridge ones were created throughout the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. They were abolished with the extinction of religious orders in 1836.
*The colleges of the former University of Paris were suppressed after the French Revolution.
*The University of Salamanca had a large number of colleges (four &quot;colegios mayores&quot;, or large colleges, and many &quot;colegios menores&quot;, or small colleges), which were abolished in 1807 when Napoleon invaded Spain.
*Leipzig University as an example of a medieval German university (currently the second oldest in the country) was structured into colleges in a similar way. Often they were set up by a particular monastic order to serve its members. Colleges served as places of living and collegiate teaching. They had jurisdiction over their members (i.e. municipal courts of the city of Leipzig would refuse to hear actions brought against them). In addition there were private residential halls (Bursen). Parallel to the college system there were four nations (university nations) similar to the model of the universities of Prague (Leipzig&#x27;s &#x27;mother&#x27; institution, see Decree of Kutná Hora) and Paris after which they were modelled. During the age of enlightenment this structure was abandoned. Still today, the names of the former colleges live on as names of buildings used by the university.

====Former federal universities====
* The Victoria University, which split into the Victoria University of Manchester, the University of Liverpool and the University of Leeds.
* The University of Wales was a federal university from its formation in 1893 until 2007, when its colleges became independent and it was transformed into a non-membership accreditation body.
* The University of Durham was a federal university with two divisions in Durham and Newcastle between 1909 and 1963, when the Newcastle division became Newcastle University.
* The Federal University of Surrey was, from 2000 to 2004, a federation of the University of Surrey and the University of Surrey Roehampton (now Roehampton University). It was dissolved when Roehampton became an independent university.
* The University of France was established by Napoleon in 1808 and acted as a central university for the &quot;académies&quot; (the former universities) until 1896, when these were restored to full university status.
* The University of South Africa was formerly a federal university with constituent colleges in the various provinces of South Africa. After the Second World War, most of these colleges became autonomous universities, and the University of South Africa became primarily a distance education institution.

<doc id="930487" wikidata="Q603027" url="?curid=930487" title="River Esk, North Yorkshire">
<text>The River Esk is a river in North Yorkshire, England that empties into the North Sea at Whitby after a course of around through its valley of Eskdale. The river&#x27;s name is derived from the Brythonic word &quot;isca&quot; meaning &quot;water&quot;. The Esk is the only major river in Yorkshire that flows directly into the North Sea; all other watercourses defined as being major rivers by the Environment Agency, either flow to the North Sea via the River Tees or the Humber Estuary.

== Overview ==

Due to its rural nature, the river is clean and healthy, supporting a wealth of wildlife. Salmon spawn right up through Eskdale, and a number of &quot;leaps&quot; are provided to enable them to travel through weirs on the course. There are clearly visible examples at Ruswarp, where the tidal stretch through to Whitby begins and at Sleights. Around Whitby the Esk has a large population of sea trout, and the river is noted for freshwater pearl mussels (the only river in Yorkshire to have them), although these are threatened with extinction due to buildups of silt in the river. In 2021, conservationists removed the mussel colony into a specialist facility to encourage the mussels to release their young, which can be raised in a secure safe environment, before the mussels are then all put back. The Esk is also the only major river in Yorkshire to drain directly into the North Sea.

The river rises at the Esklets on Westerdale Moor in the North York Moors. The Esklets are actually three moorland streams that combine in Westerdale to form the River Esk. The river flows through Westerdale before merging with a large number of becks from the surrounding hills, including Tower, Baysdale, Sleddale, Danby, Great Fryup, Stonegate, Glaisdale and Murk becks. Running east through the valley known as Eskdale it leaves the moors via the villages of Sleights and Ruswarp, between which it forms the boundary of the North York Moors, and reaches the North Sea three miles later by bisecting the resort of Whitby.

Partway down the river at Danby Bridge, there is a ford in which vehicles can get trapped.

Between the junction of Fryup Dale and Lealholm the river passes through a narrow, steep-sided and wooded valley known as Crunkly Ghyll. Here the river drops from the valley above to reach the village. Crunkly Ghyll was formed during the last great ice age as a huge wall of ice moved across the landscape carving out what is now the Esk Valley as far as Lealholm. At its head it formed a massive dam blocking the flow of water from above and creating a lake running back up the valley to Commondale. As the ice melted, the river forced its way out carving the ravine we see today. In Victorian times, the Ghyll was home to a large rockery garden, open to the public, but long since washed away by flooding of the river.

The small villages along the river were at one time of great importance to the north-east, with coal mined in the valleys, and iron ore dug from quarries on the surrounding moors. Today, all that remains are the deserted mine shafts, though potash is mined, near Boulby, with tunnels running six miles beneath the sea, some of the deepest in Europe.

Of the major rivers in Yorkshire (as defined by the Environment Agency), the Esk is the only one to flow into the North Sea directly without flowing into either the River Tees or the Humber Estuary.

==River Esk Tideway Byelaw 1987==

Since 1987 a byelaw has been in place to protect dangerously dwindling populations of salmon and sea trout. The River Esk Tideway Byelaw 1987, prevents fishing for salmon and sea trout along the stretch of the Esk between Ruswarp and Whitby known as the tideway. The Environment Agency enforces the byelaw under s210 and Schedule 25 of the Water Resources Act 1991. The byelaw was renewed in 1997 for 5 years, then again in 2002 for 10 years. After a peak of 924 rod-caught salmon per year in 1965, the number dropped to just 11 in 1989. This was due mainly to illegal poaching of stocks from this stretch under the guise of angling. Since the byelaw was introduced and enforced, the numbers of rod-caught salmon per year, further upstream, has increased each year (to 177 in 2010). The byelaw was due to expire in 2012, but was further extended to the end of December 2018.

==Recreation==
The river is used for boating in the lower reaches, especially in the upper and lower harbour areas of Whitby town. The two harbour areas also function as a port for commercial shipping and for the fishing industry. Sea-fishing tours operate out to sea from the harbours at Whitby, with many marinas being located on the east bank of the river as it approaches the North Sea. Canoeing and kayaking can be enjoyed on almost any stretch of the River Esk (including its tributaries like Eller Beck), but is mostly undertaken between Houlsyke and Egton Bridge, Egton and Sleights and Ruswarp and Whitby. These are all located between two sets of weirs each.

Local rod fishing associations have access on the River Esk to almost of riverside fishing. Most of these stretches are on banks where there is no public access.

==Bridges==
The River Esk has several notable and listed bridges on its stretch. From upstream to downstream they are; Beggars Bridge at Glaisdale (a high-arched packhorse bridge built in the 17th century), the Bowstring road bridge at Ruswarp, Larpool Viaduct between Ruswarp and Whitby, the A171 road bridge and the swing bridge in Whitby town.

Many of the bridges in the valley had to be rebuilt after floods in 1828, 1880 and 1930. The present bowstring bridge in Ruswarp dates from 1933 when Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company opened up a new bridge to replace one swept away in 1930.

==Industry==
The river was not used for shipping save for the area in and around Whitby harbour (which was notable for its whale industry and its shipbuilding). Whilst coal was mined in upper Eskdale, it was not found in sufficient quantities to be used in the alum industry; coal was trans-shipped in from Tyneside and Wearside for this. Hand in hand with the shipbuilding industry, was the ropery works that nestled around the harbour. Whitby&#x27;s last official ropery was on the south side of Spital Beck. This area was also host to shipbuilding and timber processing plants, but most of this industry was defunct by the First World War.

At Boghall and Larpool, the river was diverted in 1833 to accommodate the railway between Whitby and Pickering. This area was also the location of a whale blubber rendering plant, which was said to have afflicted the town with an awful stench.

Further upstream at the tidal limit of Ruswarp, mills were placed on the weir to grind corn. The first one was constructed in 1752, with the last being used as a mill in 1962. In 2012, a hydro-electric plant was constructed on the weir to generate green energy for the local area.

Currently, Whitby is involved in the fishing industry (mostly whitefish) which is landed by its own trawler fleet. There is a commercial side to the port which deals in fertilisers, steel and potash as well as other smaller cargoes.

==Folklore==
Every year on Ascension Eve (38 days after Easter Sunday), a ceremony is held at 9:00 am on the east side of the upper harbour, to celebrate the planting of the Penny Hedge. This stems from an old folklore tale of how in 1159, three noblemen of the area were out hunting boar in the Eskdale woods. One of the boars took refuge in a chapel and the men tried to effect entry, but an old hermit would not allow them in. They murdered him, but before he died, the hermit forgave his murderers, if every Ascensiontide, they would plant a hedge made of hazel wood in the River Esk at Whitby which could survive three tides.

The hedge needed to be cut by a penny-knife and planted as specified otherwise the men&#x27;s lands would be forfeited to Whitby Abbey, and as it was a penance as part of the hermits forgiving them their crime, if they did not carry it out, they could have faced execution charges. The tradition has been carried out every year since (according to available records) apart from 1981, when the tide was already too high to build the hedge.

<text>Meister () means &#x27;master&#x27; in German (as in master craftsman, or as an honorific title such as Meister Eckhart). The word is akin to and maestro. In sports, &quot;Meister&quot; is used for the current national, European or world champion (e.g. &quot;Deutscher Meister&quot;, &quot;Europameister&quot;, &quot;Weltmeister&quot;).

&quot;Meister&quot;, in compositions such as &quot;Polizeimeister&quot; or &quot;Wachtmeister&quot;, has a tradition in the ranks of various German police forces, partially also in Switzerland. During the Second World War, &quot;Meister&quot; was the highest enlisted rank of the German &quot;Ordnungspolizei&quot;. In professional life, &quot;Meister&quot; usually refers to a higher degree in vocational education.

&quot;Meister&quot; has been borrowed into English slang, where it is used in compound nouns. A person referred to as “Meister” is one who has extensive theoretical knowledge and practical skills in his profession, business, or some other kind of work or activity. For example, a “puzzle-meister” would be someone highly skilled at solving puzzles. These neologisms sometimes have a sarcastic intent (for example, “stubble-meister” for someone with a short, neat beard, or “crier-meister” for someone who often cries).

==Professional degree==
In Germany and Austria, the word &quot;Meister&quot; also assigns a title and public degree in the field of vocational education. The German &quot;Meister&quot; title qualifies the holder to study at a University or &quot;Fachhochschule&quot;, whether the &quot;Meister&quot; holds the regular entry qualification (&quot;Abitur&quot; or &quot;Fachhochschulreife&quot;) or not.[1] In 2012, the commissions of the states and the federal government, as well as the associated partners, concluded that the &quot;Meisterbrief&quot; is equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree (&quot;Deutscher Qualifikationsrahmen für lebenslanges Lernen&quot; and &quot;European qualification framework EQF, Level 6, Niveau 6). In the year 2020 plans were finalised to rename the meister title to &quot;professional bachelor&quot;

The Master craftsman is the highest professional qualification in crafts and is a state-approved grade. The education includes theoretical and practical training in the craft and also business and legal training, and includes the qualification to be allowed to train apprentices as well. The status of Master craftsman is regulated in the German &quot;Gesetz zur Ordnung des Handwerks, HwO&quot; (Crafts and Trades Regulation Code).

To become a master craftsman usually requires vocational training in the specific crafts in which the examination should be taken (a successfully completed apprenticeship and examination, called &quot;Gesellenprüfung&quot;). In addition to attaining the journeyman (&quot;Geselle&quot;) degree, until 2004 the Crafts and Trades Regulation Code did furthermore require practical experience of 3 years as a journeyman. In the German field of &quot;Meister&quot; education, specialised training courses for the &quot;Meisterprüfung&quot; (&quot;Meister examination&quot;) can be followed. The duration of the courses can take 1 to 2 years. The examination includes theoretical, practical and oral parts and takes 5 to 7 days (depending on the craft). In some crafts, the creation of a masterpiece is also part of the examination.

==Etymology==
&quot;Meister&quot; is derived from the Greek word &quot;μήστωρ&quot; (adviser, counselor, adept, scientist), the Latin word &quot;magister&quot; (teacher), the German &quot;meister&quot; from Old High German &quot;meistar&quot;.

<doc id="930497" wikidata="Q3487392" url="?curid=930497" title="Social.fm">
<text>Social.FM was a free social networking service for music fans. It was run by Mercora and was shut down in August 2008. Social.FM allowed Internet users to search and listen to a digital radio network of over three million songs, express their musical identity via a customizable profile page, and webcast music to other Social.FM users.

Social.FM&#x27;s mission was to catalogue and organize the world&#x27;s music and make it universally searchable and legally listenable.
Social.FM&#x27;s catalogue contained over three million unique songs by over 200,000 individual artists across all music genres. The songs were available only through streaming media, and were free.

==Company history==
Social.FM (at the time known as Mercora) was co-founded in 2003 by Srivats Sampath. Before founding Social.FM, Sampath was the co-founder and president of McAfee.com, vice-president of server product marketing at Netscape, and president and CEO of Discussions Corporation.

==How Social.FM worked==

To listen to music, a user could search the Social.FM network via a web browser and click a song link. Alternatively, a Social.FM user could download a free software client that webcasts music from his personal music collection to other Social.FM users worldwide.

===Musical self-expression and discovery===
Social.FM allowed music lovers to express their musical identity to others via a customizable profile page. Users could create musical profiles, upload digital pictures, and listen to and webcast their favorite artists.

A Social.FM user could discover new music by viewing recent searches, listening to webcasts, exploring mixes, or browsing the profiles and collections of other Social.FM users. A user could also search for artist biographies, discographies, reviews, images, and podcasts. Social.FM users could also communicate and share their musical tastes via charts, messaging, and chat.

===Social.FM Mobile===
The Social.FM Mobile music service provided users with wireless access to the Social.FM network. Social.FM users could search and listen to a digital radio network of over three million unique songs and 200,000 individual artists. Social.FM Mobile also provided:
* 100,000 channels of digital radio
* Over-the-air access to the music library on the PC
* Access to friends&#x27; music collections
* Streaming podcasts from leading media services
* Stereo Bluetooth support via A2DP profiles

Social.FM Mobile offered support for any Windows Mobile 5.0-based Smartphone or Pocket PC phone with Wi-Fi, GSM or GPRS (3G) connectivity. Windows Mobile 5.0-certified devices include the Motorola Q, Palm Treo 700w and Smartphone and Pocket PC phones by Hewlett-Packard, HTC, i-mate, Siemens, Samsung, and Audiovox.

===IM Artist Program===
The Social.FM IM Artist Program was intended for independent artists and bands that want to increase promotion and publicity for their music. As members of the IM Artist Program, participating artists received:
* Five music channels webcasting to social.fm users worldwide
* A &quot;Now Playing&quot; profile with artist pictures, biography, and discography
* Website links to purchase CDs, merchandise, tickets, and more
* The ability to communicate with fans and listeners via artist forums and chat

The IM Artist program was in beta and free.

===Social.FM Madwords===
Social.FM Madwords was a contextual advertising system that enabled advertisers to target text placements by artist or music genre. The text placements were displayed in the &quot;Sponsored Links&quot; section of a webpage upon a search for artist or genre (such as &quot;Coldplay&quot; or &quot;Alternative&quot;). In some ways, this system was similar to Google AdWords.

Madwords enabled advertisers to sign up directly via a credit card and was priced on a pay per click (PPC) basis. Advertisers could create and upload their text ads, select their targeting criteria, set their budget and PPCs, and view statistics and reports via a password-protected webpage.

===Search boxes===
Social.FM search boxes enabled consumers to search and listen to music from websites and blogs. Website and blog operators could customize the search box to incorporate their desired color scheme, size, logo, and preferred artists. Consumers could search for artists and listen through a separate browser window.

===Music iFrames===
Social.FM Music iFrames enabled consumers to view a subset of songs available from a particular artist and click a song to listen. The list of songs was dynamically generated and updated every 60 seconds. There was also a &#x27;more&#x27; option if the consumer desired to listen to a song that was not currently displayed within the Music iFrame. Clicking the &#x27;more&#x27; button displayed a full list of songs available from a particular artist.

Similar to Social.FM search boxes, website and blog operators could customize the Music iFrame to incorporate their desired color scheme, size, logo, and preferred artists.

==System requirements==
Social.FM required Windows 2000/XP/2003 Server and a broadband Internet connection. To support webcasting, audio files must be in Vorbis, MP3, or WMA formats. In 2006, Social.FM expected to migrate to a browser-based model which would enable support for the Mac and Linux platforms.

<text>KSLZ (107.7 MHz &quot;Z107-7&quot;) is a Commercial radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. It airs a contemporary hit radio format and is owned by iHeartMedia, Inc. Z107-7 carries two syndicated programs on weekdays, &quot;The Jubal Show&quot; from KBKS Seattle is heard in morning drive time while &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; is heard middays. The station&#x27;s studios are on Foundry Way near Interstate 64 in St. Louis.

KSLZ is a Class C0 station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for most stations. Its transmitter is off MacKenzie Road in the Shrewsbury neighborhood of St. Louis, amid the towers for area FM and TV stations. KSLZ uses HD Radio technology, its digital subchannel carries &quot;Pride Radio,&quot; an iHeartRadio service for LGBTQ listeners.

==History==
=== 1968–1979: Early years ===
The station signed on the air on . The original call sign was KACO, and it was owned by the Apollo Broadcasting Company. It aired an adult contemporary (AC) and middle of the road (MOR) format. A fire at the transmitter took the station off the air in January 1970.

Two months later, the station returned to the air, changed its call letters to KGRV, and relaunched as &quot;Music for Groovy Adults,&quot; offering a more upbeat AC format. This lasted until 1972, when it once again changed call letters, this time to KKSS, and rebranded as &quot;Kiss 108&quot;. By 1974, KKSS switched to country music. A year later, KKSS flipped to an R&amp;B format, dubbed &quot;Black in Stereo&quot;. In February 1979, KKSS altered its R&amp;B format and adopted the moniker &quot;Studio 108,&quot; with a hybrid disco music and R&amp;B format, competing with WZEN (now KATZ-FM).

=== 1979–1997: CHUrban/UC===
In June 1979, the call sign was changed to KMJM and rebranded as &quot;The New Majic 108 FM, Where the Music is the Majic!&quot;. KMJM Was catered to both African-American and Caucasian-American listeners as the St. Louis market&#x27;s first &quot;CHUrban&quot; station (a forerunner to the Rhythmic Contemporary format). At the time, the station was owned by Keymarket Communications. KMJM was ranked among the top five stations in the St. Louis Arbitron ratings during the 1980&#x27;s, as it shifted towards a mainstream UC direction.

In May 1988, KMJM was sold to Noble Communications of San Diego for $19 million. KMJM&#x27;s FM signal was one of the best in the St. Louis area, as the station emerged as the top urban station in the market. Jacor bought the station in 1997.

=== 1997–present: Top 40 ===
On October 20, 1997, at midnight, after 18 years on 107.7 FM, KMJM was moved to recently purchased sister station WCBW (104.9 FM), which aired a Christian music format. After a 12-hour stunt with a looped heartbeat and announcements redirecting KMJM listeners to the new frequency and the launch of a new format on 107.7 later that day, KSLZ and its current top 40/CHR format, branded as &quot;Z107-7&quot;, debuted. The flip was to fill a format hole left by WKBQ, who dropped the format for modern AC on January 24 of that year. The final song on &quot;Majic&quot; was &quot;Good Girls&quot; by Joe, while the first song on &quot;Z&quot; was &quot;Get Ready For This&quot; by 2 Unlimited.

===Morning shows===
At first, KSLZ was the St. Louis affiliate for the MJ Morning Show, based at Tampa sister station WFLZ, and the only affiliate for the show outside of the Eastern Time Zone. After the show ended in February 2012, KSLZ became the St. Louis affiliate for The Bobby Bones Show. After Bones relaunched his show to air on country stations in February 2013, KSLZ replaced him with Elvis Duran and the Morning Show. In December 2017, KSLZ dropped Duran for local host Jordan DeSocio. As part of company-wide layoffs, DeSocio exited the station in November 2020, and was replaced by &quot;The Jubal Show&quot;, based at Seattle sister station KBKS.

==HD Radio==
KSLZ made the conversion to HD Radio in 2006. 107.7-HD2 initially carried a New CHR format branded as &quot;Z107-7 Amped.&quot; On June 22, 2016, KSLZ-HD2 switched to &quot;Pride Radio&quot;.

<text>The Venture Bros. is an American adult animated action comedy television series created by Jackson Publick and Doc Hammer for Cartoon Network&#x27;s late night programming block Adult Swim. Following a pilot episode on February 16, 2003, the series premiered on August 7, 2004.

&quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; was one of Adult Swim&#x27;s longest-running original series in terms of years, and had the record for fewest seasons produced of a scripted show per year of continuous production, with seven produced seasons over fifteen years of production.

Throughout its run, the series has received critical acclaim for its writing, characters, humor, animation and world building. It ended its run on October 7, 2018, with a total of 81 episodes over the course of seven seasons as well as four specials. On September 7, 2020, series creator Jackson Publick announced on Twitter that the series had been canceled. A direct-to-video film, &quot;The Venture Bros.: Radiant Is the Blood of the Baboon Heart&quot;, was released on July 21, 2023, on digital and July 25, 2023, on Blu-ray and premiered on Adult Swim and Max 90 days later. The film serves as the series finale.

==Premise==
The series chronicles the lives and adventures of the Venture family: emotionally insecure, unethical and underachieving super-scientist father Dr. Thaddeus &quot;Rusty&quot; Venture; his well-meaning but dimwitted and incompetent teenage fraternal twin sons Hank and Dean Venture; the family&#x27;s bodyguard, secret agent Brock Samson, or his temporary replacement, the reformed villain and pederast Sergeant Hatred; and the family&#x27;s self-proclaimed archnemesis, The Monarch, a butterfly-themed supervillain. Initially conceived as a satire of boy adventurer and Space Age fiction prevalent in the early 1960s, it is considered to be an action/adventure series with both comedic and dramatic elements.

==Characters==

The characters of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; are largely re-imaginings of characters from &quot;Jonny Quest&quot; as well as comic book superheroes and supervillains.

* Dr. Thaddeus &quot;Rusty&quot; Venture (voiced by James Urbaniak), a former boy adventurer and inspiration for the &quot;Rusty Venture&quot; cartoon series, runs what remains of Venture Industries, a once-leading global corporation established by his super-scientist adventurer father Jonas. Since Jonas&#x27;s death, Venture Industries has declined to a shadow of its former glory, now occupying only a portion of the vast and deteriorating Venture compound and external locations including a base on Spider Skull Island, which his father captured, and the space station Gargantua-1, which his father built. Rusty dropped out of college shortly after his father&#x27;s death and his academic credentials have been questioned. It is stated he only holds an honorary degree from a Tijuana community college. He attempts to follow in his father&#x27;s footsteps by becoming a super-scientist himself. His competence frequently falls short of his father&#x27;s and he often demonstrates questionable ethics, leading others to claim that his occasional successes merely capitalize on the work of his late father.
* Hank (voiced by Chris McCulloch) and Dean Venture (voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas) are the titular fraternal twin brothers of the show. Hank is the more adventurous and Dean is the more timid and bookish of the two brothers. The two teenaged brothers often wind up in perilous situations, and (as revealed in the second season) have been killed over a dozen times, only to be replaced with exact clones who have no memory of their own deaths. The title &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; has taken on different meanings throughout the series with the introduction of Rusty&#x27;s fraternal twin brother Jonas Jr., and Hank and Dean&#x27;s illegitimate paternal half-brother, Dermott Fictel. The identity of Hank and Dean&#x27;s mother remains the subject of some debate. At the end of the series finale movie &quot;The Venture Bros.: Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart&quot; it is revealed that Rusty Venture grew the boys in an artificial womb that he attached to his own abdomen, and it is suggested that Deborah Majeure, daughter of supervillain Force Majeure and actress Bobbi St. Simone, is the boys&#x27; genetic mother.
* Brock Samson (voiced by Patrick Warburton) is the longstanding bodyguard to the Venture family. Appointed by the Office of Secret Intelligence (OSI), the muscular and hyper-masculine Brock frequently uses his license to kill to protect the Venture family from any threat with sudden and brutal violence. He is a ruthless (and somewhat sadistic) hand-to-hand combatant, usually preferring to use a combat knife, his hands and feet, or his vintage Dodge Charger rather than firearms; the Monarch refers to him fearfully as Venture&#x27;s &quot;Swedish murder machine&quot; (&quot;Dia de Los Dangerous!&quot;). In the fourth season, Brock Samson is replaced as a bodyguard by Sergeant Hatred (voiced by McCulloch), a former supervillain. Prior to becoming their bodyguard, Hatred was assigned to be the Venture family&#x27;s arch-enemy. Hatred is also a &quot;cured&quot; pedophile; his pedophilia is actually controlled by an experimental drug (&quot;Nomolestol&quot;) given to him by the OSI and its effectiveness has varied wildly between episodes. Season 6 sees Samson return to his position as the Venture&#x27;s official bodyguard while Sgt. Hatred becomes security for the new Venture compound in New York City.
* Dr. Venture&#x27;s deceased father, Dr. Jonas Venture (voiced by Paul Boocock), was the model super-scientist of his day. He was a visionary who changed the world with his inventions and stands as the inspiration for most other protagonists in the series. He formed &quot;Team Venture&quot;, a collection of friends and associates that helped him fight crime and subsequently save his son (Dr. Venture) from his arch-enemies. To help his son cope without a mother figure, he developed a loyal and rather emotional robot named H.E.L.P.eR. (listed in episode credits as voiced by &quot;Soul-Bot&quot;) that accompanies and assists the Ventures. Early in the series, he was portrayed as a model man and father. However, later episodes show him as callous and uncaring about his son&#x27;s well-being, while showcasing questionable ethics, both medically and socially. In the fourth-season episode &quot;Self-Medication&quot;, there is a scene showing the young Rusty Venture receiving psychotherapy from his father. As Rusty says that he longs for a normal childhood, Jonas is shown to have snuck out of his study while Rusty elaborates upon his desire to not follow in his footsteps; after tiptoeing back to his desk, Jonas interrupts him and insists that Rusty blames his father for all of his problems, and is ungrateful for the opportunities given to him. In general, Jonas&#x27; portrayal has shown him to be less and less of a sympathetic character as the series progresses, eventually leading Rusty to proclaim that he was a &quot;far worse&quot; father than he is.

Throughout the series, the Venture family has had various recurring antagonists. Many are current or former members of The Guild of Calamitous Intent, an organization founded to save mankind from self-destruction, but which now serves as an &quot;ad hoc&quot; placement agency matching super villains with appropriate heroic nemeses. The organization is run by the mysterious leader known only as &quot;The Sovereign&quot;, who is revealed to be real-life rock star David Bowie in episode 26, though in episode 5 of the 5th season it is revealed that The Sovereign is actually a shape-shifter who frequently appears as Bowie.

* The Venture Family&#x27;s primary nemesis is the pernicious but ineffective super-villain the Monarch (voiced by McCulloch). Assuming the motif of a monarch butterfly and &quot;arching&quot; Dr. Venture since college, the Monarch will stop at nothing to antagonize Dr. Venture (even though his motive is unknown). Accompanying the Monarch is the masculine-voiced Dr. Girlfriend (voiced by Doc Hammer), referred to by the Monarch as &quot;Dr. Mrs. The Monarch&quot; after their wedding.
* Baron Werner Ünterbheit (voiced by T. Ryder Smith) is a former dictator of Ünterland and bears a grudge against Venture. He blames Venture for the loss of his jaw in college, explaining &quot;One is always supposed to look out for one&#x27;s lab partner!&quot; The season three premiere reveals that the Monarch was responsible for the explosion that destroyed Ünterbheit&#x27;s jaw, in an early attempt to kill Venture.
* Phantom Limb (voiced by James Urbaniak) is another villain, a former lover of Dr. Girlfriend, and a rival to the Monarch. He is very snobby and debonair, and has invisible arms, which can produce energy and electrocute opponents. Phantom Limb was a high-ranking Guild member, until he tried to usurp the Sovereign.
* The Ventures&#x27; friends and acquaintances include expert necromancer Doctor Byron Orpheus (voiced by Steven Rattazzi) and his apathetic, teenage goth daughter Triana (voiced by Lisa Hammer), who rent a portion of the Venture Compound; the albino computer scientist Pete White (voiced by McCulloch), a former college friend of Dr. Venture&#x27;s; hydrocephalic &quot;boy genius&quot; Master Billy Quizboy (voiced by Hammer); and Dr. Jonas Venture, Jr. (voiced by James Urbaniak), Dr. Venture&#x27;s formerly parasitic fraternal twin brother who has succeeded in all of the areas that Rusty does not. Surviving members of the original Team Venture have also appeared as well as Dr. Orpheus&#x27;s teammates in the Order of the Triad.

==Episodes==

Most episodes begin with a cold open and are shot to appear to be in letter-box format. Almost every episode features both a smash cut into the end credits, and a short scene following the credits. The second season of the series premiered on the internet via Adult Swim Fix on June 23, 2006, and on television on June 25, 2006; the season finished on October 15, 2006. The considerable delay between the end of the first season and the start of the second was partially caused by Adult Swim&#x27;s delay in deciding whether to renew the show, primarily because the show is drawn and inked in the traditional animation style (albeit digitally), causing each episode to take considerable time to move through production. Additionally, the producers were dealing with the time constraints of producing a first-season DVD that contained live action interviews and commentary for several episodes.

The third season began on June 1, 2008, and marked the beginning of the show&#x27;s broadcast in high-definition. A 15-minute rough cut of &quot;The Doctor Is Sin&quot; aired on April 1, 2008, as part of Adult Swim&#x27;s April Fool&#x27;s Day theme of airing sneak peeks of new episodes. The fourth season was split into two segments airing a year apart, with the first eight episodes airing in the fall of 2009 and the remaining episodes in fall of 2010. A note contained in the closing credits of the Season 4 finale indicated that the series would continue into the fifth season.

On February 6, 2013, it was announced that Season 5 would premiere on May 19, 2013. This was later shifted to June 2, 2013, at midnight.

On July 8, 2013, Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick stated in an interview with &quot;Slate Magazine&quot; that they had begun writing the sixth season as of Summer 2013 and that it would enter full-production in September 2013. They tentatively stated that Season 6 would premiere in Fall of 2014, or very early 2015 at the latest. This estimated season-debut date turned out to be extremely premature as Season 6 premiered at Midnight, February 1, 2016.

Jackson Publick confirmed on Twitter that Season 7 of &quot;The Venture Brothers&quot; would be aired on Adult Swim in &quot;Summer&quot; 2018. On June 27, it was confirmed via Adult Swim&#x27;s Instagram page that Season 7 would begin August 5, 2018. For this season, Publick stepped back from directing, assuming the role of supervising director. Two-time directing partner and storyboard director for season six, Juno Lee, took over as the series director. Barry J. Kelly also served as Lee&#x27;s co-director.

==Development==

Show creator Jackson Publick was one of the main writers for the Saturday morning animated series &quot;The Tick&quot;. He created &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; storyline sometime prior to 2000. After working for the television program &quot;Sheep in the Big City&quot; and the live-action version of &quot;The Tick&quot;, Publick set to turning &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; into an animated series. &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; was originally conceived as a comic book story for an issue of &quot;Monkeysuit&quot;. Publick realized that his notes were too extensive for a short comics story and proposed that Comedy Central air &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; as an animated series, but the network rejected it. Although the first draft of the pilot script was written in the spring of 2000, the premise was not greenlit until around the summer of 2002 by Adult Swim. Publick had not previously considered Cartoon Network because he &quot;didn&#x27;t want to tone &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; down,&quot; and was unaware of the existence of the network&#x27;s late night adult-oriented programming block, Adult Swim.

With the revised pilot, production began in autumn of that year, and the pilot was first run on February 16, 2003. The first season of the series was completed and premiered in 2004, and it was added to the summer schedule in August.

=== Cancellation ===
After the conclusion of the seventh season in October 2018, the series was announced to be renewed for an eighth and final season. On September 5, 2020, one of the show&#x27;s illustrators, Ken Plume, tweeted that &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; was cancelled. Jackson Publick confirmed two days later that the show was cancelled. The script for Season 8 had been partially written at the time of its cancellation a few months before the public announcement.

==Film==
===&quot;The Venture Bros.: Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart&quot;===
Following the cancellation, Adult Swim stated via Twitter that &quot;We also want more &quot;Venture Bros.&quot; and have been working with Jackson and Doc to find another way to continue the &quot;Venture Bros.&quot; story&quot;. On November 13, 2020, HBO Max general manager Andy Forssell tweeted that HBO Max was &quot;working on&quot; reviving &quot;The Venture Bros&quot;.

On May 12, 2021, it was announced that a direct-to-video film based on &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; was in production from Adult Swim,

On April 18, 2023, it was revealed that the film will be titled &quot;The Venture Bros.: Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart&quot;, which would serve as the finale to the series. It was released digitally on July 21, as well as on Blu-Ray/DVD on July 25, 2023.

==International broadcast==
In Canada, &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; previously aired on Teletoon&#x27;s Teletoon at Night block and later G4&#x27;s Adult Digital Distraction block. The series currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.

==Themes, homages, and references==
===&quot;Jonny Quest&quot;===
The series&#x27; principal reference is to the 1964 animated science fiction adventure television series &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, as it is the basis for many of the main characters. Dr. Venture is modelled after what a child such as Jonny Quest might have grown up to be like after having lived through a childhood filled with bizarre, life-threatening events. Brock is modelled on Race Bannon. The Venture boys are based on the Hardy Boys and take the places of Jonny and Hadji. One newspaper critic remarked, &quot;If filmmakers Woody Allen and Sam Peckinpah had collaborated on &quot;Jonny Quest&quot;, it would have come out a lot like this.&quot; Despite the homage and references, Jonny Quest himself, as well as Hadji, Race Bannon, and their arch-nemesis, Dr. Zin appear as characters on the show. Cartoon Network, who owns the rights to Jonny Quest, restricted the use of their characters, with Jonny Quest appearing as &quot;Action Johnny&quot;, and Dr. Zin as &quot;Dr. Z&quot;.

===Failure as a recurring theme===
Publick and Hammer have stated that one of the primary themes of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; is failure. Hammer in 2006 said, &quot;Yeah, failure, that&#x27;s what &quot;Venture Bros.&quot; is all about. Beautiful sublime failure.&quot;

In the creator commentary for the episode &quot;Home Insecurity&quot;, Hammer and Publick elaborated on the theme. Publick stated:

Hammer responded:

In 2013, Publick and Hammer discussed moving away from the theme and embracing the &quot;successes&quot; of the characters as well. Publick stated:

In a 2023 interview with &quot;Chapo Trap House&quot; producer Chris Wade, Hammer clarifies that:
=== Intergenerational trauma &amp; growth as writers ===
In 2023, shortly before the release of the series finale &quot;Radiant is the Blood of the Baboon Heart&quot;, Hammer and Publick further expanded on the evolution of the series&#x27; themes, and their feelings on what has been the main theme over the course of the series. &quot;We can go in there and armchair diagnose our characters: Doc is a... narcissist. He was made that way by his father.&quot; Publick continued, saying that &quot;This is kinda about escaping your generational, parental kind of bullshit, to some extent.&quot; Given that much of Rusty&#x27;s shortcomings as an adult stem from the emotional abuse he endured from his father and Team Venture, many episodes deal directly with Rusty trying his best to be a good father - if not a better father than his own. &quot;This is - this is everywhere; this is the road to forgiveness. You have to embrace this, and not perpetuate it. &quot;The Venture Brothers&quot; wasn&#x27;t trying to be public service announcement... it was trying to entertain you in a way that &quot;kinda&quot; made you feel uncomfortable, but helped you learn about yourself, as you were watching it.&quot;

In the same interview, Hammer continues on, saying that having a show in production for such a length of time allowed them to process their own growth as creators, and how much the early seasons were a product of the social norms of their time. &quot;We made our mistakes as creators. We&#x27;ve done some things that we look back on and go, &#x27;boy, that was a young kid trying to be funny.&#x27; ... Luckily, we were on the air long enough to go: &#x27;Please forgive us&#x27;, and &#x27;This is I think what we&#x27;re talking about here&#x27;.&quot; Hammer highlights the verbal repartee between Jonas Venture, Jr. and the Monarch in the season 3 episode &quot;The Lepidopterists,&quot; in which the Monarch calls Ned, a character with Down syndrome a &quot;retard,&quot; and is chastised by J.J. accordingly. &quot;We very much our ideas like idiots.&quot;

==Reception==
The show received critical acclaim over its run. &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; ranked at #56 on the IGN &quot;Best 100 Animated Series&quot; list. In 2013, &quot;Slate&quot;″s Chris Wade called &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; &quot;one of the best shows on television&quot; and praised the detailed serial nature of the humor with a favorable comparison to &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. Also in 2013, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;″s Armin Rosen compared the show favourably to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, noting that the two shows held the same &quot;slacker optimism&quot; and great comedy. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Zach Handlen commented in 2012 that the show had evolved over its seasons into a &quot;meta-commentary on a whole sub-section of male nerd culture&quot; and that it had become one of the funniest contemporary shows.

Critical reception to the first season was more mixed than later seasons but was still mostly positive. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Emily VanDerWerff felt that the pop-culture references of the first season fell flat, especially in the beginning of the season, but grew better and funnier as the show&#x27;s emotional core took hold. Mike Drucker, writing for IGN, criticized the predictability of some first-season episodes, but noted that the show was &quot;a refreshing cartoon because it willingly indulges in the sitcom fad of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

In 2013 IGN placed &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; as number 12 on their list of Top 25 animated series for adults. In January 2021, Sean Cubillas of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; (&quot;CBR&quot;) described the series as &quot;one of the most well-written superhero series of all time,&quot; a stand-out in the field of adult animation, and said it had &quot;witty writing, tot [sic] pacing, and large yet complex cast of characters.&quot;

==Home media==
The first season of &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; on DVD was released on May 30, 2006, as officially announced by Warner Home Video. It coincided with the June 25 premiere of the second season. Originally, it was scheduled for March 14, 2006, but was delayed until May 30, 2006. The DVD packaging and interior art was created by comic artist Bill Sienkiewicz. On May 31, 2006, the season one DVD reached #1 on Amazon&#x27;s top selling DVDs list.

On March 27, 2010, series creator Jackson Publick revealed on his Livejournal that a standard definition DVD of the first half of season 4 would likely be released sometime between July and October 2010, with a DVD of the second half of the season and a Blu-ray box set of the entire season to be released after the full season has aired.

On March 28, 2023, it was announced the series will have a complete series DVD set which was released on June 13, 2023, from Warner Bros. Discovery Home Entertainment. It was also released on digital.

The first four seasons are available in the UK (both halves of Season 4 are sold as a set). Madman Entertainment have also released all seven seasons on DVD in Australia. No Blu-ray editions have yet been released in Australia. It&#x27;s also the first Adult Swim series in Australia to be given a restricted MA15+ rating for Season 1 and later the higher R18+ rating for Season 4 Part 2, due to strong dialogue in the finale episode.
===The &quot;lost DVD commentary&quot;===
Jackson Publick revealed that he and Doc Hammer had recorded a commentary track for the season one episode &quot;Home Insecurity&quot;. Warner Home Video chose to omit this track from the Season One DVD due to space limitations and some minor sound quality issues. Publick also stated that the commentary could be downloaded.

===Soundtrack CD===
For the video release of the Season 3, a soundtrack album was also released, titled &quot;The Venture Bros.: The Music of JG Thirlwell&quot;. This is the same audio CD included as a bonus with the Blu-ray version of Season 3. While the CD release was originally made available at Adult Swim&#x27;s website, it was given a wide release on May 12, 2009; the vinyl LP release came out a month earlier. It can also be downloaded from most major digital retailers. The CD features 20 tracks, while the vinyl LP release is 16 tracks and a download link of the complete release including the songs omitted from the LP.

&quot;Music of The Venture Bros: Vol 2&quot; was released digitally on April 10, 2016 and on CD and Vinyl on June 3, 2016. The album was released on Thirlwell&#x27;s own Ectopic Ents label in collaboration with Williams Street Records.

<doc id="930516" wikidata="Q4352160" url="?curid=930516" title="Flake (chocolate bar)">
<text>Flake is a British brand of chocolate bar currently manufactured by British chocolate company Cadbury, owned by Mondelez International, consisting of thinly folded milk chocolate. The bar has a unique crumbly texture, and softens but does not melt when heated (unless put in a velvetiser).

==History==
The original Flake product was first developed in 1920 and was discovered by chance by Ralph Thompson, an employee of Cadbury&#x27;s at the Bournville factory who noticed thin streams of excess chocolate falling from moulds cooled into flaky ripples.

By 1930, Cadbury&#x27;s was selling half-length Flake specifically for garnishing vanilla soft serve ice cream in a cone (&quot;99 Flakes&quot;) which was served by ice cream vendors. First sold in the United Kingdom, they would later be sold in Ireland, Australia, South Africa and other nations. The later product, Cadbury Twirl, has two Flake-style bars covered in milk chocolate.

Flakes are no longer manufactured at Bournville and are now made in Dublin, Ireland, and 10th of Ramadan, Egypt.

In 2021 and again in 2022, Mondelez announced that there were shortages of Flakes in the UK and Ireland. In 2021 this was attributed to high levels of demand due to good weather. In 2022, Mondelez attributed the shortages to &quot;some global supply chain disruptions&quot; alongside demand pressures.

==Manufacturing process==
Cadbury refers to the exact process of making Flakes as a closely guarded secret; however, experimental evidence by Australian food scientist Ann Reardon shows that the result can be recreated by seizing chocolate.

== Variations ==
===Flake bars===
Several varieties of Flake have been produced over the years, including:
*Versions based around dark (plain) chocolate
**Plain Flake - &quot;A blend of plain and milk chocolate&quot;
**Flake Noir - a dark chocolate flake bar.
**Flake Dark - dark chocolate flake covered in dark chocolate. Launched 2006.
*Flake Snow (known as Snowflake until 2003) - a white chocolate flake bar dipped into milk chocolate. Launched 1999 and discontinued in 2000.
*Flake Dipped - milk chocolate flake dipped into milk chocolate (resembles a larger version of Twirl), and also known as Flake Luxury. Launched 2003. 
*Flake Praline - milk chocolate flake with praline. Launched 2004.
*Flake Bar.
*Flake Allure - a milk chocolate flake half enrobed in rich truffle and milk chocolate. Launched 2011 (limited edition).
*Orange Flake - orange-flavoured milk chocolate flake (available in South Africa).
*Flake Mint - flake which has a pale green mint-flavoured centre. In South Africa it is a mint-flavoured milk chocolate flake with no colouring. Flake Mint was introduced in Australia in late 2016 as a Special Edition flavor.
*Flake Caramilk - a Caramilk flavoured Flake composed of caramelised white chocolate introduced in Australia in 2021.

== Advertising ==

The product gained some notoriety for its highly sensual advertising. In the UK, the advertisements showed people – almost always women – enjoying a Flake whilst relaxing.

The Flake Girl became famous as a symbol of indulgence and secret pleasure. Her emphasis – to a jingle (&quot;Only the crumbliest, flakiest chocolate, tastes like chocolate never tasted before&quot;) – was on allowing herself a guilt-free luxury. The advertising of a girl in a field was produced by Barry Myers.

The Flake song was composed by UK jingle writer Ronnie Bond, who also composed &quot;Tasty tasty very very tasty&quot; for Bran Flakes, and &quot;I&#x27;d rather have a bowl of Coco Pops&quot; for Coco Pops.

Former Tyrannosaurus Rex percussionist Steve Peregrin Took wrote a song, Peppermint Flickstick, in 1970 as a satire on the campaign. The song was recorded that year by his band Shagrat and released in 1990.

In 1999, a tribute advertisement to the Flake Girls of decades past was released. The montage began with a clip of the very first Flake Girl advertisement from 1959, followed by a 1965 clip of a girl relaxing in a rowing boat whilst being pestered by a cheeky swan for a peck of her Flake bar. The next clip showed the 1973 advertisement of a doe-eyed artist in a field of poppies painting a watercolour and indulging in a Flake bar, before being caught in a summer shower. This was followed by a clip of the exotic 1987 ad in which a restless woman in silk negligee reposes on a window sill on a sultry night, indulging in a Flake bar whilst a gecko lizard is noted crawling over a ringing telephone. Next was a clip of the classical 1991 Flake advertisement in which a woman sporting a dark, cropped hairstyle reposes in an overflowing bath tub in a great painted hall. Lastly, this tribute montage advertisement ended with the latest Flake Girl advertisement (1999), featuring a Parisienne relaxing in a summery garden overlooking the Eiffel Tower. As she bites into the Flake bar in her ice-cream, the garden sprinklers are set off and she is drenched in refreshing water.

The Flake girl was finally retired after 40 years, in 2004. However, in 2005 she was found to have a 19% recall in the UK population, leading to a revival in 2007. The new advertisement featured Australian model Alyssa Sutherland eating a Flake in a convertible during a shower of rain.

UK singer Joss Stone became the new Flake girl in 2008 – the first non-model to promote the product. In the television advertisement she is seen breaking off a small piece of Flake before popping it into her mouth and brushing the crumbs off her blouse whilst softly singing the Flake theme song.

On 8 June 2010, a new advertisement (first aired on Channel 4) saw a woman float around on a black background. Whilst part of &#x27;The Flake girl&#x27; series, there is no mention of any text or slogan aside from the image of the bar at the end of the advertisement, and the familiar music jingle is replaced by a haunting piano piece.

<text>Steve Canyon is an American action-adventure comic strip by cartoonist Milton Caniff. Launched shortly after Caniff retired from his previous strip, &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; ran from January 13, 1947, until June 4, 1988. It ended shortly after Caniff&#x27;s death. Caniff won the Reuben Award for the strip in 1971.
==History==
By 1946, Caniff had developed a worldwide reputation for his syndicated &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;, but he rights for the strip he had created, written, and drawn (for &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper syndicate editor Captain Joseph Patterson) were entirely owned by the syndicate. Seeking creative control, Caniff negotiated with Field Enterprises for a new strip on which he could retain ownership. &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; was &quot;marketed and distributed by King Features, which was subcontracted as Field&#x27;s selling agent&quot;. Caniff&#x27;s popularity meant that sixty clients agreed to run &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; before publication. The last Caniff episode of &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; appeared in December 1946, and then George Wunder took over the strip. Caniff&#x27;s new strip, &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, debuted in 168 newspapers. In the 1950s, the strip was enormously popular, and Caniff and &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; appeared on the covers of both &quot;Time&quot; (1947) and &quot;Newsweek&quot; (1950).

Many strip creators before and since have employed uncredited assistants or ghost artists, and Caniff was no exception. In 1952, he hired comic book artist Dick Rockwell (nephew of famed illustrator Norman Rockwell) as his assistant. While Caniff scripted and drew the main characters, Rockwell penciled and inked secondary characters and backgrounds. Rockwell continued on &quot;Canyon&quot; until Caniff&#x27;s death on May 3, 1988.
The last syndicated &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; strip was a tribute to Caniff in two panels, one drawn by cartoonist Bill Mauldin, with the other containing the signatures of 78 fellow cartoonists.

On June 23, 1997, an authorized 50th-anniversary &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; strip was published by the &quot;Air Force Times&quot;, a civilian weekly newspaper covering the United States Air Force. &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; and the U.S. Air Force having been created the same year, the shared anniversary was celebrated with &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; appearing as part of a 96-page insert, &quot;The First Fifty Years: U.S. Air Force 1947–1997&quot;. Drawn in the style of a Sunday strip, the story and art for this commemorative were provided by Air Force Master Sergeant Russ Maheras, with coloring by Carl Gafford. On Monday, September 24, 2007, &quot;Air Force Times&quot; published a 60th-anniversary &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; strip by Maheras. The color, Sunday-style strip depicts Brigadier General Steve Canyon in Afghanistan, investigating Taliban activity.

==Characters and story==
Steve Canyon was an easygoing adventurer with a soft heart. Originally a veteran running his own air-transport business, the character returned to the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War and stayed in the military for the remainder of the strip&#x27;s run. In later years, he was involved in Air Force intelligence and operations.

Initially, his buddies were fellow veterans, and romantic interest was provided by Copper Calhoon, a kind of capitalist version of the popular Dragon Lady character Caniff had created for &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;. Eventually, Canyon developed a sometime-sidekick in crotchety millionaire adventurer Happy Easter, along with a permanent love interest in Summer Olson, initially Calhoon&#x27;s private secretary. (Canyon and Olson were pronounced &quot;man and wife&quot; in the first panel of the April 25, 1970, daily strip.) General Philerie was based on legendary World War II hero Phil Cochran, who came from Erie, as noted in the character&#x27;s name (&quot;Phil-Erie&quot;). Cochran had been the model for Flip Corkin from &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot;.

In the mid-1950s Steve Canyon became guardian to Poteet Canyon. Just why she was sent to him was left unanswered for many years, along with how she was related to him. She went to Maumee University, then got a job in journalism, first at a local newspaper. At the nearby airfield, she became friends with Bitsy Beekman, who worked at a high-end magazine like &quot;Vogue&quot;. In the late-1960s to the late 1970s, more stories focused on Summer&#x27;s son by her first marriage, Leighton Olson, Jr., who got involved with drugs, then went to Maumee University, now filled with radical antiwar types. He became steady with Stalky Schweisenberger while at Maumee U.

Caniff was intensely patriotic, and with Canyon&#x27;s return to the military, the story began to revolve around Cold War intrigue and the responsibilities of American citizens. Despite this shift in tone, Caniff was able to maintain the picaresque quality of his globally set stories. During Christmas time, in &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;, as he did in &quot;Terry&quot;, Caniff made a special effort to remind readers of servicemen&#x27;s sacrifices.
==Models== 
Caniff was famous for colorful villains and intriguing female characters, such as Madame Lynx and the lovely exiled ruler, Princess Snowflower. Madame Lynx was based on Madame Egelichi, the &quot;femme fatale &quot;spy played by Ilona Massey in the Marx Brothers movie &quot;Love Happy&quot; (1949). The character stirred Caniff&#x27;s imagination so much that he hired Ilona Massey personally to pose for him. Besides casting Ilona Massey as Lynx, Caniff patterned Pipper the Piper after John F. Kennedy, and Miss Mizzou after either Marilyn Monroe or actress Bek Nelson. The character of Charlie Vanilla (who would frequently appear with an ice cream cone in hand) was based on Caniff&#x27;s longtime friend Charles Russhon, a former photographer and U.S. Air Force lieutenant, who became a technical advisor on five James Bond films.

==Other media==
===Cinema===
In the late 1940s, producer David O. Selznick considered a &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; film series starring Guy Madison, but Madison&#x27;s agent Henry Willson talked Selznick out of it.

===Television===
The strip was adapted into a filmed, half-hour television series of 34 episodes on NBC in 1958–59 (with reruns on ABC in 1960). Dean Fredericks (1924–1999), formerly the Hindu manservant on Johnny Weissmuller&#x27;s 1955–56 &quot;Jungle Jim&quot; series, played Canyon—a troubleshooter for the United States Air Force, spending half the season traveling from base to base before becoming the commanding officer stationed at the strip&#x27;s fictitious Big Thunder Air Force Base in California. With the exception of General &quot;Shanty&quot; Towne (in the pilot episode), none of the other supporting characters from the newspaper strip appeared in the series.

The show is broadcast periodically on the Decades over-the-air television network.

From 2008 to 2009, the first 24 episodes were released on DVD; the remaining episodes were released on July 28, 2015.

===Novels===
A series of novels was published by Grosset &amp; Dunlap in the 1950s. They were all written by Caniff, with illustrations by himself.

==Real-world depictions==
A statue of Steve Canyon was erected in Idaho Springs, Colorado, and a nearby mountain canyon was renamed &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;. A mosaic of Steve Canyon&#x27;s ward, Poteet Canyon, stands in front of the city fire station in the town of Poteet, Texas.

The CIA/US Air Force covert air war in Laos during the Vietnam War was unofficially called the &quot;Steve Canyon Program&quot; 

==Reprints==
Harvey Comics reprinted the strip in a half-dozen 1948 comic books, and Dell Comics published seven issues of original stories (1953–1959) by former Caniff assistant Ray Bailey (who had anticipated &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; with his own &quot;Bruce Gentry&quot; about a charter pilot) in their &quot;Four Color&quot; series (numbers 519, 578, 641, 737, 804, 939, and 1033). &quot;Steve Canyon&quot; was reprinted by &quot;The Menomonee Falls Gazette&quot;, Kitchen Sink Press, and &quot;Comics Revue&quot;, with Hermes Press reprinting the comic book in 2011.

Kitchen Sink Press published &quot;Steve Canyon Magazine&quot; for 21 issues, until replacing it with trade paperback collections using the same numbering:

* &quot;Steve Canyon v.26 War Games&quot; (1992, , reprints Sept 25, 1957, to April 7, 1958)

Kitchen Sink Press also published a one-shot &quot;Steve Canyon 3-D&quot; comic in June 1986 featuring an anaglyph 3D process by Ray Zone.

In 2006, Checker Book Publishing Group began releasing a year-by-year collection of &quot;Steve Canyon&quot;. Nine volumes were released before publication ceased:

<doc id="930548" wikidata="Q21176" url="?curid=930548" title="Viborg, Denmark">
<text>Viborg () is a city in central Jutland, Denmark, the capital of both Viborg municipality and Region Midtjylland. Viborg is also the seat of the Western High Court, the High Court for the Jutland peninsula. Viborg Municipality is the second-largest Danish municipality, covering 3.3% of the country&#x27;s total land area.

==History==
Viborg is one of the oldest cities in Denmark, with Viking settlements dating back to the late 8th century. Its central location gave the city great strategic importance, in political and religious matters, during the Middle Ages. A motte-and-bailey-type castle was once located in the city. Viborg&#x27;s name is a combination of two Old Norse words: &quot;vé&quot;, meaning a holy place, and &quot;borg&quot;, meaning a fort, but the original name of the town was &quot;Vvibiærgh&quot;, where &quot;-biærgh&quot; means hill (modern Danish &quot;-bjerg&quot; (mountain).
==Economy==
Viborg municipality is where the Apple Foulum Data Center is located which opened in September 2020.

==Sights==

Viborg is famous for Viborg Cathedral. The construction of the cathedral started in 1130 and took about 50 years. The building has burned to the ground and been re-built several times. Only the crypt of the original cathedral is still preserved. The cathedral was and is the locus of cult of Saint Kjeld of Viborg who was dean of the cathedral chapter there and had a great shrine there in the Middle Ages. The newest parts of the church are from a restoration between 1864 and 1876. The cathedral is famous for its many paintings by Danish painter Joakim Skovgaard, which depict stories from the Bible. Next to the cathedral is the Skovgaard museum, founded in 1937.

Before the Protestant Reformation Viborg was the home of five monasteries, about 12 parish churches, several chapels and of course the cathedral. The Black Friars&#x27; church dates from the 13th century. Today only the cathedral and a few remains of the Franciscan and the Dominican monasteries are left.

==Sports==

Since the 1990s, Viborg has had a reputation as one of Denmark&#x27;s leading cities for sports. It started with handball, a popular sport in Denmark, when the women&#x27;s handball team became one of best five clubs in Europe, and continued when both the men&#x27;s handball team and the professional football team established themselves in their respective domestic leagues. From 1998 to 2008, Viborg FF was a member of the Danish Superliga, reaching an all-time high by winning the Danish cup in 2000.

Viborg hosts the annual Haervejsmarchen international two-day walking festival, which regularly attracts 8,000 participants, including many from outside Denmark. It includes marked routes of distances of up to 45 kilometres a day. The walk is affiliated to the IML Walking Association.

==Education==

Viborg is home to a number of educational institutions, including Viborg Katedralskole (cathedral school). Denmark&#x27;s oldest educational institution celebrated its 900th birthday in 2000. The school is believed to have been founded about 1060, at the same time as the city became the seat of a bishop. The church needed to educate boys and young men to enter into the church&#x27;s service, and to that purpose it created a school. Its current monumental home was built in 1926 to accommodate a larger number of students and later the school added a dormitory to house the many students from outer regions or islands not close to a gymnasium. Although this role is now basically obsolete, the dorm continues to be a popular solution for many students wanting to get away from home or for a small number of students from Greenland. Viborg Katedralskole is today one of four gymnasiums in Viborg.

Viborg is also home to The Animation Workshop, an art school based in a former army barracks on the outskirts of town. The school, which achieved official recognition from the Danish government in 2003, offers students a Bachelor of Arts in character animation.

For international parents Viborg also has an international school where all teaching is in English based on the Cambridge International examinations.

&quot;Gymnasium&quot; is the Danish equivalent of high school. It is not what English speakers call a gym, or place to work out. It offers a very rigorous education for college-bound students.

<doc id="930550" wikidata="Q1158918" url="?curid=930550" title="History of the Russian language">
<text>Russian is an East Slavic language of the Indo-European family. All Indo-European languages are descendants of a single prehistoric language, reconstructed as Proto-Indo-European, spoken sometime in the Neolithic era. Although no written records remain, much of the culture and religion of the Proto-Indo-European people can also be reconstructed based on their daughter cultures traditionally and continuing to inhabit most of Europe and South Asia, areas to where the Proto-Indo-Europeans migrated from their original homeland.

==Periodization==
No single periodization is universally accepted, but the history of the Russian language is sometimes divided into the following periods:
* Old Russian or Old East Slavic (until ~1400)
* Middle Russian (~1400 until ~1700)
* Modern Russian (~1700 to the present)

The history of the Russian language is also divided into &quot;Old Russian&quot; from the 11th to 17th centuries, followed by &quot;Modern Russian&quot;.

==External history==
=== Kievan Rus&#x27; period (9th–12th century) ===
The common ancestor of the modern East Slavic languages, Old East Slavic, was used throughout Kievan Rus&#x27; as a spoken language. The earliest written record of the language, an amphora found at Gnezdovo, may date from the mid-10th century. In writing, Old Church Slavonic was the standard, although from the 11th century, variations became distinguishable from Serb ones. Also in the 11th century, differences in written sources point to the slow emergence of distinct East Slavic languages.

During the pre-Kievan period, the main sources of borrowings were Germanic languages, particularly Gothic and Old Norse. In the Kievan period, however, loanwords and calques entered the vernacular primarily from Old Church Slavonic and from Byzantine Greek:

=== Feudal and linguistic breakup (13th–14th century) ===

Kievan Rus&#x27; began to decline and fragment in the 12th century. From the 12th and 13th centuries, regional phonetic and grammatical variations within Church Slavonic texts could be detected, indicating the eventual divergence of the language. Around 1200, and especially after the sack of Kiev in 1240, when Mongols and Tatars established the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe, an autonomous spoken Russian language, largely independent from written Church Slavonic, began to develop. Nevertheless, Church Slavonic remained the literary standard in these central and northern regions for several more centuries. 
After the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 13th century, the vernacular language of the conquered peoples remained firmly Slavic. Turko-Mongol borrowings in Russian relate mostly to commerce and the military:

On the other hand, Ruthenian or Chancery Slavonic developed as a separate written form out of Old Church Slavonic, influenced by various local dialects and used in the chancery of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which came to dominate the western and southern lands of Rus&#x27;.

=== The Moscow period (15th–17th centuries) ===
After the Golden Horde gradually disintegrated in the late 15th and early 16th century, both the political centre and the predominant dialect in European Russia came to be based in Moscow. A scientific consensus exists that Russian and Ruthenian had definitely become distinct by this time &quot;at the latest&quot;. The official language in Russia remained a kind of Church Slavonic until the close of the 18th century, but, despite attempts at standardization, as by Meletius Smotrytsky in 1620, its purity was by then strongly compromised by an incipient secular literature. Vocabulary was borrowed from Polish, and, through it, from German and other Western European languages. At the same time, a number of words of native (according to a general consensus among etymologists of Russian) coinage or adaptation appeared, at times replacing or supplementing the inherited Indo-European/Common Slavonic vocabulary.

Much annalistic, hagiographic, and poetic material survives from the early Muscovite period. Nonetheless, a significant amount of philosophic and secular literature is known to have been destroyed after being proclaimed heretical.

The material following the election of the Romanov dynasty in 1613 following the Time of Troubles is rather more complete. Modern Russian literature is considered to have begun in the 17th century, with the autobiography of Avvakum and a corpus of &quot;chronique scandaleuse&quot; short stories from Moscow. Church Slavonic remained the literary language until the Petrine age (1682–1725), when its usage shrank drastically to biblical and liturgical texts. Legal acts and private letters had been, however, already written in pre-Petrine Muscovy in a less formal language, more closely reflecting spoken Russian. The first grammar of the Russian language was written by Vasily Adodurov in the 1740s, and a more influential one by Mikhail Lomonosov in 1755 (&quot;Rossijskaja grammatika&quot;). Lomonosov argued for the development of three separate styles of written Russian, in which the higher and middle styles (intended for &quot;the more respectable literary genres&quot;) were still supposed to heavily draw upon Church Slavonic vocabulary. In the early 19th century, authors such as Karamzin and Pushkin set further literary standards, and by the year 2000, the common form of the Russian language had become a mixture of purely Russian and Church Slavonic elements.

=== Empire (18th–19th centuries) ===
The political reforms of Peter the Great were accompanied by a reform of the alphabet, and achieved their goal of secularization and modernization. Blocks of specialized vocabulary were adopted from the languages of Western Europe. Most of the modern naval vocabulary, for example, is of Dutch origin. Latin, French, and German words entered Russian for the intellectual categories of the Age of Enlightenment. Several Greek words already in the language through Church Slavonic were refashioned to reflect post-Renaissance European rather than Byzantine pronunciation. By 1800, a significant portion of the gentry spoke French, less often German, on an everyday basis.

At the same time, there began explicit attempts to fashion a modern literary language as a compromise between Church Slavonic, the native vernacular, and the style of Western Europe. The writers Lomonosov, Derzhavin, and Karamzin made notable efforts in this respect, but, as per the received notion, the final synthesis belongs to Pushkin and his contemporaries in the first third of the 19th century.

During the 19th century, the standard language assumed its modern form; literature flourished. Spurred perhaps by the so-called Slavophilism, some terms from other languages fashionable during the 18th century now passed out of use (for example, &gt; , &#x27;victory&#x27;), and formerly vernacular or dialectal strata entered the literature as the &quot;speech of the people&quot;. Borrowings of political, scientific and technical terminology continued. By about 1900, commerce and fashion ensured the first wave of mass adoptions from German, French and English.

=== Soviet period and beyond (20th century) ===
The political upheavals of the early 20th century and the wholesale changes of political ideology gave written Russian its modern appearance after the spelling reform of 1918. Reformed spelling, the new political terminology, and the abandonment of the effusive formulae of politeness characteristic of the pre-Revolutionary upper classes prompted dire statements from members of the émigré intelligentsia that Russian was becoming debased. But the authoritarian nature of the regime, the system of schooling it provided from the 1930s, and not least the often unexpressed yearning among the literati for the former days ensured a fairly static maintenance of Russian into the 1980s. Though the language did evolve, it changed very gradually. Indeed, while literacy became nearly universal, dialectal differentiation declined, especially in the vocabulary: schooling and mass communications ensured a common denominator.

The 1964 proposed reform was related to the orthography. In that year the Orthographic commission of the Institute of the Russian language (Academy of Sciences of the USSR), headed by Viktor Vinogradov, apart from the withdrawal of some spelling exceptions, suggested:
* retaining one partitive soft sign
* always writing instead of after 
* writing instead of after , , , , and if stressed or if not
* not writing the soft sign after , , , and 
* canceling the interchange in roots -zar/-zor, -rast/-rost, -gar/-gor, -plav/-plov etc.; canceling the double consonants in loan words
* writing only -yensk(iy) instead of two suffixes -insk(iy) and -yensk(iy), write only -yets instead of -yets or -its
* simplifying the spelling of (н-н) in participles: write double in prefixal participles and ordinary in non-prefixal
* always writing with hyphen the &quot;Пол-&quot; (half-) combinations with subsequent genitive of noun or ordinal number
* writing the nouns beginning with vice-, unter-, ex- together instead of using hyphen
* writing all particles separately
* allowing the optional spelling of noun inflexions

The reform, however, failed to take root.

Political circumstances and the undoubted accomplishments of the superpower in military, scientific, and technological matters (especially cosmonautics), gave Russian a worldwide if occasionally grudging prestige, most strongly felt during the middle third of the 20th century.

The political collapse of 1990–1991 loosened the shackles. In the face of economic uncertainties and difficulties within the educational system, the language changed rapidly. There was a wave of adoptions, mostly from English, and sometimes for words with exact native equivalents.
At the same time, the growing public presence of the Russian Orthodox Church and public debate about the history of the nation gave new impetus to the most archaic Church Slavonic stratum of the language, and introduced or re-introduced words and concepts that replicate the linguistic models of the earliest period.

Russian today is a tongue in great flux. The new words entering the language and the emerging new styles of expression have, naturally, not been received with universal appreciation.

===Examples===
The following excerpts illustrate (very briefly) the development of the literary language.

====Primary Chronicle====
c. 1110, from the Laurentian Codex, 1377

: &#x27;These [are] the tales of the bygone years, whence is come the Russian land, who first began to rule at Kiev, and whence the Russian land has come about.&#x27;

Old East Slavic, the common ancestor of Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian. Fall of the yers in progress or arguably complete (several words end with a consonant; &#x27;to rule&#x27; &lt; , modern ). South-western (incipient Ukrainian) features include &#x27;bygone&#x27;; modern Russian ). Correct use of perfect and aorist: &#x27;is/has come&#x27; (modern Russian ), &#x27;began&#x27; (modern Russian as a development of the old perfect.) Note the style of punctuation.

====The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign====
. c. 1200(?), from the Catherine manuscript, c. 1790.

: &#x27;Would it not be meet, o brothers, for us to begin with the old words the difficult telling of the host of Igor, Igor Sviatoslavich? And to begin in the way of the true tales of this time, and not in the way of Boyan&#x27;s inventions. For the wise Boyan, if he wished to devote to someone [his] song, would wander like a squirrel over a tree, like a grey wolf over land, like a bluish eagle beneath the clouds.&#x27;

Illustrates the sung epics. Yers generally given full voicing, unlike in the first printed edition of 1800, which was copied from the same destroyed prototype as the Catherine manuscript. Typical use of metaphor and simile. The misquote (&#x27;to effuse/pour out one&#x27;s thought upon/over wood&#x27;; a product of an old and habitual misreading of the word , &#x27;squirrel-like&#x27; as , &#x27;thought-like&#x27;, and a change in the meaning of the word ) has become proverbial in the meaning &#x27;to speak ornately, at length, excessively&#x27;.

====Avvakum&#x27;s autobiography====
1672–73. Modernized spelling.

&quot;And then they sent me to Siberia with my wife and children. Whatever hardship there was on the way, there&#x27;s too much to say it all, but maybe a small part to be mentioned. The archpriest&#x27;s wife [= My wife] gave birth to a baby; and we carted her, sick, all the way to Tobolsk; for three thousand versts, around thirteen weeks in all, we dragged [her] by cart, and by water, and in a sleigh half of the way.&quot;

Pure 17th-century central Russian vernacular. Phonetic spelling ( &#x27;it all, all of that&#x27;, modern ). A few archaisms still used (aorist in the perfective aspect &#x27;was&#x27;). Note the way of transport to exile.

====Alexandr Pushkin====
From &quot;Winter Evening&quot; (), 1825. Modern spelling. 

: Буря мглою небо кроет,
: Вихри снежные крутя;
: То, как зверь, она завоет,
: То заплачет, как дитя,
: То по кровле обветшалой
: Вдруг соломой зашумит,
: То, как путник запоздалый,
: К нам в окошко застучит.

: Tempest covers sky in haze[s],
: Twisting gales full of snow;
: Like a beast begins to howl,
: A cry, as if a child, it will let go,
: On the worn-out roof it will clamour
: Suddenly upon the thatch,
: Or as though a traveller tardy
: Starts to knock upon our hatch. (&quot;lit.&quot;, window)

Modern Russian is sometimes said to begin with Pushkin, in the sense that the old &quot;high style&quot; Church Slavonic and vernacular Russian are so closely fused that it is difficult to identify whether any given word or phrase stems from the one or the other.

====Fyodor Dostoevsky====
From &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (), 1866. Modern spelling.

: &quot;In early July, during a spell of extraordinary heat, towards evening, a young man went out from his garret, which he sublet in S—— Lane, [entered] the street, and slowly, as though in [the grip of] indecision, began to make his way to K—— Bridge.&quot;

19th century prose. No archaisms. &quot;European&quot; syntax.

====Fundamental laws of the Russian Empire====
 (&quot;Constitution of the Russian Empire&quot;), 1906. Modern spelling.

: &quot;To the Emperor of all Russia belongs the Supreme Autocratic Power. To obey His power, not merely in fear but also in conscience, God Himself does ordain.&quot;

Illustrates the categorical nature of thought and expression in the official circles of the Russian Empire. Exemplifies the syntactic distribution of emphasis.

====Mikhail Bulgakov====
From &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (), 1930–40

&quot;You have always been a passionate proponent of the theory that upon decapitation human life comes to an end, the human being transforms into ashes, and passes into oblivion. I am pleased to inform you, in the presence of my guests, though they serve as a proof for another theory altogether, that your theory is both well-grounded and ingenious. Mind you, all theories are worth one another. Among them is one, according to which every one shall receive in line with his faith. May that come to be!&quot;

An example of highly educated modern speech (this excerpt is spoken by Woland). See Russian humor for the essential other end of the spectrum.

==Internal history==
The modern phonological system of Russian is inherited from Common Slavonic but underwent considerable innovation in the early historical period before it was largely settled by about 1400.

Like other Slavic languages, Old East Slavic was a language of &quot;open syllables&quot;. All syllables ended in vowels; consonant clusters, with far less variety than today, existed only in the syllable onset. However, by the time of the earliest records, Old Russian already showed characteristic divergences from Common Slavonic.

Despite the various sound changes, Russian is in many respects a relatively conservative language, and is important in reconstructing Proto-Slavic:
* Russian largely preserves the position of the Proto-Slavic accent, including the complex systems of alternating stress in nouns, verbs and short adjectives.
* Russian consistently preserves between vowels, unlike all other modern Slavic languages.
* Russian preserves palatalized consonants better than all other East and West Slavic languages, making it important for the reconstruction of yers.
* The Russian development of CerC, CorC, CĭrC, CŭrC and similar sequences is straightforward and in most cases easily reversible to yield the Proto-Slavic equivalent. Similarly the development of the strong yers is straightforward and preserves the front-back distinction. (But note that Russian shows early development of *CelC &gt; *ColC and *CĭlC &gt; *CŭlC, obscuring the front-back differences in these sequences.)

===Vowels===

====Loss of yers====

As with all other Slavic languages, the ultra-short vowels termed yers were lost or transformed. From the documentary evidence of Old East Slavic, this appears to have happened in the 12th century, about 200 years after its occurrence in Old Church Slavonic. The result was straightforward, with reflexes that preserve the front-back distinction between the yers in nearly all circumstances:
# Strong &gt; , with palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Strong &gt; , without palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Weak is lost, with palatalization of the preceding consonant
# Weak is lost, without palatalization of the preceding consonant
See the article on yers for the hypothesized pronunciation of these sounds and the meaning of the strong vs. weak distinction.

Examples:
* Old East Slavic &gt; Russian &quot;about me&quot;
* Old East Slavic &gt; Russian &quot;sleep (nom. sg.)&quot;, cognate with Lat. somnus
* Old East Slavic &gt; Russian &quot;of sleep (gen. sg.)&quot;

The loss of the yers caused the phonemicization of palatalized consonants and led to geminated consonants and a much greater variety of consonant clusters, with attendant voicing and/or devoicing in the assimilation:
* Old East Slavic &gt; Russian (&#x27;where&#x27;).

Unlike most other Slavic languages, so-called &quot;yer tensing&quot; (the special development of &gt; and &gt; for some yers preceding ) did not happen in Russian, nor was later lost. Yers preceding developed as elsewhere; when dropped, a sequence &quot;Cʲj&quot; developed, which is preserved as such only in Russian. (*Cʲj &gt; &quot;CʲCʲ&quot; in Ukrainian and Belarusian; elsewhere, it generally merged with *Cʲ or *Cj, or the was dropped early on.) The main exception to the lack of yer tensing is in long adjectives, where nominative becomes expected (&quot;ój&quot;, ) only when stressed, but (&quot;yj&quot;, ) otherwise (possibly influenced by Church Slavonic) and nominative (which is never stressed) always becomes yer-tensed (&quot;ij&quot;).

Some yers in weak position developed as if strong to avoid overly awkward consonant clusters:
* Proto-Slavic &quot;stem, stalk&quot; &gt; (&quot;stebló&quot;) (cf. Old Czech &#x27;, Czech &#x27; or (dialectal) &#x27;, Old Polish &#x27; or &#x27;, Polish &#x27;, all meaning &quot;stalk, straw&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;variegated&quot; &gt; (&quot;pjóstryj&quot;) (cf. Polish &#x27;, but Czech &#x27;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;to ring, to clank&quot; &gt; (&quot;zvenétʹ&quot;) (cf. Old Czech &#x27;, Czech &#x27;)

As shown, Czech and especially Polish are more tolerant of consonant clusters than Russian; but Russian is still more tolerant than Serbo-Croatian or Bulgarian: Proto-Slavic &quot;mist, haze&quot; &gt; (&quot;mgla&quot;) (cf. Old Czech &#x27;, Polish &#x27;, but Serbo-Croatian &quot;&quot;, Bulgarian (&quot;măglá&quot;)).

====Loss of nasal vowels====
The nasal vowels (spelled in the Cyrillic alphabet with yuses), which had developed from Common Slavic and before a consonant, were replaced with nonnasalized vowels:
* Proto-Slavic &gt; Russian u
* Proto-Slavic &gt; Russian ja (i.e. with palatalization or softening of the preceding consonant)

Examples:
* PIE &quot;they are&quot; &gt; Proto-Slavic &gt; (&quot;sutʹ&quot;) (literary in modern Russian; cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;sǫtĭ&quot;), Polish &#x27;, Latin &#x27;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;hand&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;ruká&quot;) (cf. Polish &#x27;, Lithuanian &#x27;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;meat&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;mjáso&quot;) (cf. Polish &quot;&quot;, Old Church Slavonic (&quot;męso&quot;), Old Prussian &quot;mensa&quot;, Gothic (&quot;mims&quot;), Sanskrit (&quot;māṃsa&quot;))
* PIE &quot;five&quot; » Proto-Slavic &gt; Russian (&quot;pjátʹ&quot;) (cf. Polish &#x27;, Old Church Slavonic (&quot;pętĭ&quot;), Lithuanian &#x27;, Ancient Greek (&quot;pénte&quot;), Sanskrit (&quot;páñcan&quot;))

In the case of Proto-Slavic &gt; Russian ja, the palatalization of the preceding consonant was due to the general Russian palatalization before all front vowels, which occurred prior to the lowering of to . If the preceding consonant was already soft, no additional palatalization occurred, and the result is written rather than when following the palatal consonants (&quot;š ž č šč c&quot;):
* Proto-Slavic &quot;to begin&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;načatʹ&quot;) (cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;načęti&quot;))
* Proto-Slavic &quot;harvest&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;žátva&quot;) (cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;žętva&quot;))

Nearly all occurrences of Russian (&quot;ja&quot;) following a consonant other than (&quot;l&quot;), (&quot;n&quot;) or (&quot;r&quot;) are due to nasal vowels or are recent borrowings.

Borrowings in the Uralic languages with interpolated after Common Slavonic nasal vowels have been taken to indicate that the nasal vowels existed in East Slavic until some time possibly just before the historical period.

====Loss of prosodic distinctions====
In earlier Common Slavic, vowel length was allophonic, an automatic concomitant to vowel quality, with short and all other vowels (including nasal vowels) long. By the end of the Common Slavic period, however, various sound changes (e.g. pre-tonic vowel shortening followed by Dybo&#x27;s law) produced contrastive vowel length. This vowel length survives (to varying extents) in Czech, Slovak, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian and Old Polish, but was lost entirely early in the history of Russian, with almost no remnants. (A possible remnant is a distinction between two &quot;o&quot;-like vowels, e.g. and , in some Russian dialects, that may partly reflect earlier length distinctions.)

Proto-Slavic accentual distinctions (circumflex vs. acute vs. neoacute) were also lost early in the history of Russian. It has often been hypothesized that the accentual distinctions were first converted into length distinctions, as in West Slavic, followed by the loss of distinctive vowel length. Pretty much the only reflex of the accentual type is found in the stress pattern of pleophonic sequences like &quot;CereC, CoroC, ColoC&quot; (where C = any consonant); see below.

Notably, however, the position (as opposed to the type) of the accent was largely preserved in Russian as a stress-type accent (whereas the Proto-Slavic accent was a pitch accent). The complex stress patterns of Russian nouns, verbs and short adjectives are a direct inheritance from Late Common Slavic, with relatively few changes.

====Pleophony and CVRC sequences====
&quot;Pleophony&quot; or &quot;full-voicing&quot; (polnoglasie, ) is the addition of vowels on either side of and in Proto-Slavic sequences like CorC where C = any consonant. The specific sound changes involved are as follows:

* *CerC &gt; CereC
* *CorC &gt; CoroC
* *CelC, *ColC &gt; ColoC
* *CьrC &gt; CerC
* *CъrC &gt; CorC
* *CьlC, *CъlC &gt; ColC

Examples:
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;bank (of a river), shore&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;béreg&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;brěgŭ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;frost&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;moróz&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;mrazŭ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;chaff&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;polóva&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;plěva&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;ear (of corn), spike&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;kólos&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;klasŭ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;sickle&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;serp&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;srĭpŭ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;turtle dove&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;górlica&quot;); cf. Old Church Slavonic (&quot;grŭlica&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;hill&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;xolm&quot;); Old Church Slavonic (&quot;xlŭmŭ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;wolf&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;volk&quot;); Old Church Slavonic (&quot;vlĭkŭ&quot;)

Note that Church Slavonic influence has made it less common in Russian than in modern Ukrainian and Belarusian:
* Ukrainian: 
* Russian: (&#x27;Vladimir&#x27;) (although a familiar form of the name in Russian is still ).

When a Proto-Slavic sequence like *CerC was accented, the position of the accent in the resulting pleophonic sequence depends on the type of accent (circumflex, acute or neoacute). This is one of the few places in Russian where different types of accents resulted in differing reflexes. In particular, a sequence like CéreC, with the stress on the first syllable, resulted from a Proto-Slavic circumflex accent, while a sequence like CeréC, with the stress on the second syllable, resulted from a Proto-Slavic acute or neoacute accent. Examples:

* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;town&quot; (circumflex) &gt; (&quot;górod&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;doorsill&quot; (acute) &gt; (&quot;poróg&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;&quot; &quot;king&quot; (neoacute) &gt; (&quot;korólʹ&quot;)

====Development of *i and *y====
Proto-Slavic and contrasted only after alveolars and labials. After palatals only occurred, and after velars only occurred. With the development of phonemic palatalized alveolars and labials in Old East Slavic, and no longer contrasted in any environment, and were reinterpreted as allophones of each other, becoming a single phoneme . Note that this reinterpretation entailed no change in the pronunciation and no mergers. Subsequently, (sometime between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries), the allophone of occurring after a velar consonant changed from to with subsequent palatalization of the velar. Hence, for example, Old Russian became modern . Conversely, the soft consonants were hardened, causing the allophone of to change from to .

====The yat vowel====

Proto-Slavic (from Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European long *ē) developed into Old Russian , distinct from (the outcome of Proto-Slavic from Balto-Slavic and Proto-Indo-European short *e). They apparently remained distinct until the 18th century, although the timeline of the merger has been debated. The sound denoted may have been a higher sound than , possibly high-mid vs. low-mid . They still remain distinct in some Russian dialects, as well as in Ukrainian, where Proto-Slavic developed into respectively. The letter remained in use until 1918; its removal caused by far the greatest of all Russian spelling controversies.

====The yo vowel====
Proto-Slavic stressed developed into , spelled , when following a soft consonant and preceding a hard one. The shift happened after , which were still soft consonants at the time. The preceding consonant remained soft.
* OR (&#x27;about which&#x27; loc. sg.) &gt; R 

That has led to a number of alternations:

This development occurred prior to the merger of ѣ (yat) with е, and ѣ did not undergo this change, except by later analogy in a short list of words as of about a century ago. Nowadays, the change has been reverted in two of those exceptional words.
* &#x27;threading needle, bodkin&#x27;
* &#x27;nests&#x27;
* &#x27;glandule&#x27; (however &#x27;piece of iron&#x27;)
* &#x27;[he/it is] depicted; [he/it is] imprinted (in the mind)&#x27;
* &#x27;stars&#x27;
* &#x27;[he] used to yawn&#x27;
* &#x27;jibe&#x27;
* () &#x27;[it is] (never) worn&#x27;
* &#x27;[he] found&#x27;
* &#x27;saddles&#x27;
* &#x27;apprehension&#x27;
* &#x27;[he] flowered, flourished&#x27;
* &#x27;[he] used to put on&#x27; (this word has fallen into disuse in the standard language)
* &#x27;fuel, chips; instigation; firebrand&#x27; (this word has fallen into disuse in the standard language)
* &#x27;way-mark&#x27; (now )
* &#x27;mole cricket&#x27;, &#x27;mole rat&#x27; (now )

In the pronouns and , the stressed letter (ya) came to be pronounced ; as a result, after the 1918 spelling reform, was rewritten as and as .

Loanwords from Church Slavonic reintroduced between a (historically) soft consonant and a hard one, creating a few new minimal pairs:
Russian spelling does not normally distinguish stressed and following a soft consonant (and in some cases also following the unpaired consonants ), writing both as . However, dictionaries notate as when pronounced as .

This sound change also occurred in Belarusian as seen in the word for &quot;flax&quot;: Belarusian and Russian .

====Vowel reduction====
Modern Russian has extensive reduction of unstressed vowels, with the following mergers:

* original unstressed and following a hard consonant are merged as (pronounced or , depending on position)
* original unstressed and following a hard consonant are merged as , or as if is considered a phoneme (pronounced )
* original unstressed , , following a soft consonant are merged as (all are pronounced )

The underlying vowel resurfaces when stressed in related forms or words, cf. (&quot;baldá&quot;) &quot;sledgehammer&quot;, with genitive plural (&quot;bald&quot;) , vs. (&quot;kormá&quot;) , with genitive plural (&quot;korm&quot;) . The spelling consistently reflects the underlying vowel, even in cases where the vowel never surfaces as stressed in any words or forms (e.g. the first syllables of (&quot;xorošó&quot;) &quot;well (adverb)&quot; and (&quot;sapožók&quot;) &quot;boot&quot;) and hence the spelling is purely etymological. See Vowel reduction in Russian for more details.

There are exceptions to the rule given above: for example, &quot;video&quot; is pronounced as rather than .

===Consonants===

====Consonant cluster simplification====
Simplification of Common Slavic and to :
* Common Slavonic &quot;soap&quot; &gt; Russian: (&quot;mylo&quot;) (cf. Polish )

Consonant clusters created by the loss of yers were sometimes simplified, but are still preserved in spelling:
* (&quot;zdravstvujte&quot;) &quot;hello&quot; (first &quot;v&quot; rarely pronounced; such a pronunciation might indicate that the speaker intends to give the word its archaic meaning &quot;be healthy&quot;)
:* (&quot;sérdce&quot;) &quot;heart&quot; (&quot;d&quot; not pronounced), but &quot;d&quot; is pronounced in the genitive plural (&quot;sérdec&quot;) )
:* (&quot;solnce&quot;) &quot;sun&quot; (&quot;l&quot; not pronounced), but &quot;l&quot; is pronounced in adjectival (&quot;sólnečnyj&quot;) &quot;solar&quot; and diminutive (&quot;sólnyško&quot;) &quot;small sun, sweetheart&quot;

====Development of palatalized consonants====
Around the tenth century, Russian may have already had paired coronal fricatives and sonorants so that could have contrasted with , but any possible contrasts were limited to specific environments. Otherwise, palatalized consonants appeared allophonically before front vowels. When the yers were lost, the palatalization initially triggered by high vowels remained, creating minimal pairs like (&#x27;given&#x27;) and (&#x27;tribute&#x27;). At the same time, , which was already a part of the vocalic system, was reanalyzed as an allophone of after hard consonants, prompting leveling that caused vowels to alternate according to the preceding consonant rather than vice versa.

Sometime between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries, the velars became allophonically palatalized before , which caused its pronunciation to change from to . This is reflected in spelling, which writes e.g. (&quot;gíbkij&quot;) rather than (&quot;gybkyj&quot;).

====Depalatalization====
The palatalized unpaired consonants depalatalized at some point, with becoming retroflex and . This did not happen, however, to , which remains to this day as palatalized . Similarly did not depalatalize, becoming (formerly and still occasionally ). The depalatalization of is largely not reflected in spelling, which still writes e.g. (&quot;šitʹ&quot;), rather than (&quot;šytʹ&quot;), despite the pronunciation .

Paired palatalized consonants other than and sometimes and eventually lost their palatalization when followed by another consonant. This is generally reflected in spelling. Examples:
* Proto-Slavic &quot;to stick&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;lʹnutʹ&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;sun&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;sólnce&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;ox-yoke&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;jarmó&quot;); but Proto-Slavic &quot;bitter&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;gorʹkij&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;ancient&quot; &gt; Russian (&quot;drévnij&quot;)
* Proto-Slavic &quot;cowberry&quot; » Russian (&quot;brusníka&quot;)

====Incomplete early palatalizations====
There is a tendency to maintain intermediate ancient , , etc. before frontal vowels, in contrast to other Slavic languages. This is the so-called &quot;incomplete second and third palatalizations&quot;:
* Ukrainian 
* Russian: (&#x27;leg&#x27; dat.)
It is debated whether these palatalizations never occurred in these cases or were due to later analogical developments. A relevant data point in this respect is the Old Novgorod dialect, where the second palatalization is not reflected in spelling and may never have happened.

====Development of palatal consonants====
The Proto-Slavic palatal series of consonants (not to be confused with the later palatalized consonants that developed in Russian) developed as follows:
* The palatal resonants merged with the new palatalized consonants *lʲ *nʲ *rʲ that developed before Proto-Slavic front vowels.
* The palatal plosives merged with . Note, however, that Proto-Slavic appear as (commonly notated &quot;šč žd&quot; and pronounced respectively, although was formerly pronounced , as its transcription suggests) in words borrowed from Old Church Slavonic.
* The palatal clusters developed into sounds denoted respectively and either or (nowadays normatively pronounced , although there is a strong tendency to instead pronounce and as hard ).
* The palatal fricatives hardened into retroflex (although the affricate remained as soft ).

====Degemination====
Many double consonants have become degeminated but are still written with two letters.

(In a 1968 study, long remains long in only half of the words in which it appears written, but long did so only a sixth of the time. The study, however, did not distinguish spelling from actual historical pronunciation, since it included loanwords in which consonants were written doubled but never pronounced long in Russian.)

===Effect of loanwords===
A number of the phonological features of Russian are attributable to the introduction of loanwords (especially from non-Slavic languages), including:
* Sequences of two vowels within a morpheme. Only a handful of such words, like &#x27;spider&#x27; and &#x27;slap in the face&#x27; are native.
** &#x27;poet&#x27;. From French &quot;poète&quot;.
** &#x27;mourning&#x27;. From German &quot;Trauer&quot;.
*Word-initial , except for the root эт-.
** &#x27;era&#x27;. From German &quot;Ära&quot;
*Word-initial . (Proto-Slavic *a- &gt; Russian &quot;ja-&quot;)
** &#x27;avenue. From French &quot;avenue&quot;.
** &#x27;swindle&#x27;. From French &quot;affaire&quot;.
** &#x27;lamb&#x27;. From Church Slavonic
*The phoneme (see Ef (Cyrillic) for more information).
** &#x27;phoneme&#x27;. From Greek φώνημα.
** &#x27;ether&#x27;. From Greek αἰθήρ.
** &#x27;fiasco&#x27;. From Italian &quot;fiasco&quot;. 
*The occurrence of non-palatalized consonants before within roots. (The initial of a suffix or flexion invariably triggers palatalization of an immediately preceding consonant, as in / / .)
*The sequence within a morpheme.
** ) &#x27;gin&#x27; from English.
** &#x27;jazz&#x27; from English.

===Morphology and syntax===
Some of the morphological characteristics of Russian are:
* Loss of the vocative case
* Loss of the aorist and imperfect tenses (still preserved in Old Russian)
* Loss of the short adjective declensions except in the nominative
* Preservation of all Proto-Slavic participles

<text>4Kids Entertainment, Inc. (formerly known as Leisure Concepts, Inc. and later known as 4Licensing Corporation; stylized as 4K!DS ENTERTAINMENT) was an American licensing company. The company was previously also a film and television production company that produced English-dubbed Japanese anime through its subsidiary 4Kids Productions between 1992 and 2012; it specialized in the acquisition, production and licensing of children&#x27;s entertainment around the United States. The first anime that 4Kids Productions dubbed was the first eight seasons of &quot;Pokémon&quot; that originally began airing in first run syndication, and then it later moved to exclusively air on Kids&#x27; WB! in the United States. The company is most well-known for its range of television licenses, which has included the multibillion-dollar &quot;Pokémon&quot; and &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; Japanese anime franchises. They also ran two program blocks: Toonzai (originally The CW4Kids) on The CW, and 4Kids TV (originally FoxBox) on Fox, both aimed at children. The 4KidsTV block ended on December 27, 2008, while its Toonzai block ended on August 18, 2012, which was replaced by Saban&#x27;s Vortexx, which in itself was succeeded by the One Magnificent Morning block by Litton Entertainment (now known as Hearst Media Production Group) in 2014.

4Licensing Corporation had its world headquarters on Third Avenue in New York City, its former subsidiary, 4Kids Productions, had its headquarters in a separate building in Manhattan. The New York Stock Exchange delisted 4Kids (NYSE: KDE) on June 1, 2010. On April 6, 2011, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following a lawsuit concerning the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise. On December 13, 2012, the company announced that it had emerged from bankruptcy. On September 21, 2016, it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection once again and shut down operations one year later. 4Kids&#x27; former CEO, Alfred R. Kahn, founded a successor company called Kidtagious Entertainment in 2019.

== History ==
=== Company origins ===
Leisure Concepts was co-founded on April 28, 1970, by Mike Germakian (later who would be known as one of the creators of ThunderCats) and Stan Weston (the creator of G.I. Joe and Captain Action), as an independent licensing agency in New York City. Mike Germakian was the secretary of LCI, while Stan Weston was initially the President and later the Chairman of Leisure Concepts. Weston was also the Treasurer of the company.

=== 1970–1990: Early beginnings ===

In the beginning, the company pitched toy and cartoon ideas to various companies, as well as formed partnerships with companies such as Rankin/Bass, among others.

LCI began making news in the 1980s through licensing actual people, a variety of products, and even concepts. The company also had a growing number of deals with television producers and toy manufacturers. Among the company&#x27;s licenses at the time were Farrah Fawcett of Charlie&#x27;s Angels fame, Charlie Chan, James Bond 007, a wide array of Nintendo characters and products, the Hulk, Buck Rogers in the 25th Century TV Series and many others.

LCI is credited in its assistance in the initial development of the &quot;ThunderCats&quot; concept and acted on behalf of Lorimar-Telepictures Corp as an exclusive worldwide licensing agent for products based on &quot;Thundercats&quot;, an agreement that was signed between the two parties on June 15, 1984.

During the mid-1980s, Ted Wolf came up with the idea of a race of catlike humanoid superheroes. He shared his vision with his friend Stan Weston, who in turn, through LCI, pitched it to Rankin/Bass Animated Entertainment. Both Arthur Rankin Jr and Jules Bass were impressed with the idea and the potential that it had of becoming an instant success. They approved of it and &quot;ThunderCats&quot; went into production.

During the early development stage, Mike Germakian designed much of the ThunderCats&#x27; characters, vehicles and locations. He was also responsible for creating the now iconic ThunderCats logo, featuring a stylized black panther head on a red circle. Germakian&#x27;s designs were then sent to Pacific Animation Corporation in Japan to be adapted into cartoon format. After completing work on ThunderCats, Germakian went on to design characters for SilverHawks and The Comic Strip, both Rankin/Bass shows.

In July 1987, Alfred Kahn, former Executive Vice President of Marketing at Coleco, who was credited for bringing the Cabbage Patch Kids to the Mainstream, joined the company as vice chairman and a member of the board of directors.

On December 17, 1987, LCI signed a licensing deal with Nintendo of America, Inc. to market the software products that went along with its increasingly popular gaming systems. Nintendo had already introduced &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; for its home video game system, a software product that went on to sell more than one million copies during the year. Some time in 1986, the company also signed a licensing deal to market &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

=== 1990–2000: Expansion and name change ===
In the early 1990s, LCI expanded its operations and began television production in 1992. This would include English-dubbing Japanese anime through its subsidiary 4Kids Productions, which the company would be mostly known for.

In 1987, Bobby Kotick (former President and CEO of Activision Blizzard) tried to acquire Commodore International. When Kotick was unsuccessful, he instead purchased a controlling stake in LCI, thus also becoming LCI&#x27;s CEO and chairman in June 1990. Kotick later traded out of his stake in LCI and bought a 25% stake in Activision in December 1990. In March 1991, Kotick became CEO at Activision.

The company did $6 million in sales in 1989 and employed 14 people by 1990.

On March 12, 1991, LCI appointed Alfred Kahn as its chairman and CEO.

In 1992, two subsidiaries were established by the company: The Summit Media Group, Inc. and 4Kids Productions.

The company changed its name from Leisure Concepts Inc. to 4Kids Entertainment Inc. on November 16, 1995. Although the company changed its name, &quot;Leisure Concepts&quot; still operated as a separate subsidiary of the company, meaning the company may have decided to use the &quot;Leisure Concepts&quot; name for branding purposes.

By 1999, 4Kids Entertainment employed 50 people.

=== 2000–2005: The new millennium ===

The new century found 4Kids Entertainment Inc., switching from the NASDAQ market and joining the New York Stock Exchange on September 20, 2000. The firm&#x27;s new ticker symbol was KDE, and the company was riding high during the continuing success of &quot;Pokemon&quot; when it earned Fortune&#x27;s top slot on its 100 Fastest Growing Companies for 2000. The company was also listed on the Frankfurt Exchange earlier in the year.

On April 5, 2000, 4Kids and Mattel signed a licensing agreement to create Hot Wheels die-cast cars and racing sets featuring the PACE Motor Sports line of monster trucks. The license included rights to the monster truck Grave Digger, and a new line of World Championship Wrestling vehicles designed after their star wrestlers such as Goldberg, Sting and Bret Hart. The PACE Motor Sports and World Championship Wrestling line of Hot Wheels vehicles have been available nationally at mass-market retailers beginning in the summer of that year.

In 2001, 4Kids Entertainment obtained the merchandising and television rights to the series &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters&quot; from Nihon Ad Systems, producing an English-language version which aired in North America on Kids&#x27; WB from September 29, 2001, to June 10, 2006.

In October 2001, 4Kids Entertainment acquired a 3% stake in The Pokémon Company, in a move to benefit indirectly from Pokémon&#x27;s success in Asia, and from worldwide sales of Pokémon electronic cards and video games.

In late January 2002, after engaging in a bidding war with DIC Entertainment, 4Kids Entertainment signed a four-year, US$100 million deal with the Fox Broadcasting Company to program its Saturday morning lineup. 4Kids Entertainment was wholly responsible for the content of the block and collected all advertising revenues from it.

In May 2002, 4Kids Entertainment launched a home video division called 4Kids Entertainment Home Video and appointed FUNimation Productions as the exclusive distributor for their &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, &quot;Cubix&quot;, &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids&quot; and &quot;Tama and Friends&quot; properties.

By 2002, 4Kids got $140 million in Pokémon revenue.

4Kids&#x27; new Saturday-Morning cartoon block on Fox premiered on September 14, 2002, as &quot;FoxBox&quot;. FoxBox rebranded to &quot;4Kids TV&quot; in January 2005.

=== 2005–2010: Further expansion and financial failings ===
On October 10, 2005, 4Kids Entertainment sold its 3% stake in The Pokémon Company for US$960,000, to the three parties owning the rights to Pokémon (Nintendo, Creatures and Game Freak).

On December 23, 2005, the company announced that it will not renew the Pokémon representation agreement set to expire on December 31, 2005. And that beginning in 2006, Pokémon USA, Inc.&#x27;s in-house licensing group will handle all Pokémon licensing outside of Asia. However, the company will continue to receive commissions for the next several years, on payments made under existing Pokémon license agreements whose term expires after December 31, 2005.

On January 17, 2006, 4Kids and Microsoft signed a deal to license children&#x27;s video games exclusively for the Xbox 360 gaming system, in an effort to put more child-oriented games on the system, whose gaming library was at the time dominated by games targeted toward the 12-and-up market. One of the first titles announced was &quot;Viva Piñata&quot; which would be developed by Rare. On June 10, 2006, 4Kids licensed the sequel series to Yu-Gi-Oh, Yu-Gi-Oh GX, for release in North America.

On April 18, 2006, 4Kids launched a new subsidiary entitled 4Sight Licensing Solutions Inc., which licenses and market brands aimed at adults, teenagers and pre-teens. &quot;We have built an impressive roster of captivating and successful children&#x27;s entertainment properties,&quot; said Alfred Kahn. &quot;Given the increased number of brands that we are representing that focus on an older audience, we felt it would be beneficial to organize a new subsidiary primarily devoted to the marketing and licensing of these brands. We believe that we can successfully utilize our marketing and licensing expertise to build brand value for properties targeting an older consumer that are not necessarily media or character driven.&quot;

On December 11, 2006, 4Kids Entertainment announced the formation of two subsidiaries, TC Digital Games, LLC, a trading card company, and TC Websites, LLC, an online multi-platform game company. &quot;The formation of TC Digital Games and TC Websites represent a significant enhancement of our business strategy,&quot; said Alfred R. Kahn, chairman and CEO of 4Kids Entertainment. TC Digital Games LLC and TC Websites LLC were shut down in 2010, due to continued lack of profitability.

On October 2, 2007, Warner Bros. and CBS announced that the Kids&#x27; WB programming block on their co-owned network, The CW, would be ending in 2008, and no longer be marketed and produced in-house, due to factors including cable competition. Rights for the five-hour Saturday morning block were bought by 4Kids, and they began to program the time with their own programming (mixed in with three former Kids&#x27; WB originals) in September 2008. Because of this additional deal, 4Kids provided programming for both The CW and Fox in the 2008–09 season giving 4Kids nine hours of combined children&#x27;s programming on two broadcast networks, as 4KidsTV ran until December 27, 2008. The new block, The CW4Kids, started May 24, 2008. The CW4Kids was renamed to Toonzai starting on August 14, 2010, featuring &quot;Magical Do-Re-Mi!&quot;, &quot;Cubix: Robots for Everyone&quot;, &quot;Dinosaur King&quot;, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;,&quot; Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;. Even though 4Kids TV was discontinued as it was online only, this programming block continued to use the CW4Kids name, to reflect to the network it airs on. 4Kids also indicated that it retained &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; and &quot;Sonic X&quot; in its lineup. In addition to that, Toonzai also aired &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;. The Toonzai block ended on August 18, 2012. A week later, the block was replaced by Vortexx, which ran as a final Saturday morning cartoon block on The CW from August 25, 2012, to September 27, 2014, before being replaced by One Magnificent Morning on October 4, 2014.

On November 10, 2008, 4Kids Entertainment announced that it would exit its contract with Fox and terminate its Fox programming block by the end of 2008. The final broadcast of 4Kids TV on Fox was on December 27, 2008.

On December 17, 2008, 4Kids Entertainment announced that it was laying off about 15% of its workforce due to the worsening economic environment, and financial situation at the company.

=== 2010–2012: Decline and first bankruptcy ===
On May 28, 2010, the company announced that New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) trading in its common stock would be suspended prior to the opening of trading on Tuesday, June 1, 2010, thus effectively delisting the company from the New York Stock Exchange. Beginning June 1, 2010, the company began trading under the new stock symbol &quot;KIDE&quot; on the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) market.

On January 11, 2011, the company announced that Alfred Kahn, the CEO and Chairman of the Company since March 1991, had left the company. Michael Goldstein, a member of the company&#x27;s Board of Directors since March 2003, was appointed interim chairman, while the company was conducting a search for a new CEO.

On March 29, 2011, TV Tokyo and Nihon Ad Systems (NAS) sued 4Kids Entertainment, alleging that the company entered into illegal agreements with other companies, including Funimation Entertainment and Majesco Entertainment, regarding the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; anime franchise. TV Tokyo claimed that those agreements allowed 4Kids to collect royalties without paying a portion of those royalties to TV Tokyo, which violates their original agreement. The companies are seeking almost $5 million in &quot;underpayments, wrongful deductions, and unmet obligations.&quot; As part of the suit, the companies terminated the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; license from 4Kids. Neither Funimation nor Majesco are listed as defendants in the case.

4Kids Entertainment informed the licensors on March 27, 2011, that their termination letter was &quot;wrongful and devoid of any factual and legal basis,&quot; and that they had not given 4Kids 10 days&#x27; notice as required. 4Kids further revealed that they had made a good-faith payment of $1 million and agreed to a March 18 meeting in lieu of a lawsuit, which TV Tokyo and NAS nevertheless decided to go ahead with. The company also stated that even if the termination is found to be valid, the company is prepared to do whatever it takes to stay in business. 4Kids filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection as of April 6, 2011. 4Kids requested that the court suspend co-licensor Asatsu DK&#x27;s attempts to exercise control of the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise in the United States, particularly in terms of selling the rights to the latest anime series, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal&quot;, which was due to be pitched at the Licensing International Expo on June 14. However, on June 2, 2011, bankruptcy judge Shelley Chapman issued a court order on TV Tokyo and NAS for an automatic stay on the U.S. &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; license and said that the trial will proceed in two phases. The first phase is whether the contractual termination was valid, and the second is how much money 4Kids would owe the companies. The first phase of the trial began on August 29, 2011.

On October 27, 2011, 4Kids and the executives of former financial company Lehman Brothers reached a deal, after Lehman had improperly invested most of 4Kids funds in auction rate securities. 4Kids received $500,000 from the deal. Chapman later ruled that the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; license is still in effect due to TV Tokyo, NAS and ADK not terminating the agreement properly. On February 29, 2012, there was an amicable settlement of the lawsuit between 4Kids Entertainment and Asatsu-DK (ADK) and TV Tokyo over the license of the Yu-Gi-Oh! property.

On May 1, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures LLC, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, placed a bid to acquire some of 4Kids&#x27; assets, including the US rights to the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise and The CW4Kids block, for $10 million. On June 5, 2012, 4Kids commenced an auction between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was then adjourned so 4Kids, Kidsco, and 4K Acquisition could consider an alternative transaction. On June 15, 2012, 4Kids filed a notice outlining a proposed deal in which its assets would be divided between Kidsco and 4K Acquisition which was finalized on June 26, 2012. The deal saw 4K Acquisition acquire the US rights to the &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot; franchise and KidsCo acquire 4Kids&#x27; other assets including the agreements for &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Sonic X&quot;, &quot;Cubix&quot; and The CW Network&#x27;s Toonzai Saturday morning programming block.

On August 14, 2012, it was announced through a quarterly report that 4Kids Entertainment had discontinued operations of four operating divisions: 4Kids Ad Sales Inc., 4Kids Productions Inc., 4Kids Entertainment Music Inc., and 4Kids Entertainment Home Video, Inc. due to their continued lack of profitability. On September 13, 2012, it was revealed through a quarterly report that on August 16, 2012, the Board of Directors of 4Kids Entertainment determined to discontinue the operations of its UK subsidiary, 4Kids Entertainment International Ltd., which became effective on September 30, 2012. On December 5, 2012, 4Kids Entertainment announced that it had ended a dispute (over the so-called &quot;Pokémon&quot; agreement) with The Pokémon Company International under which TPCi will get a $1 million general unsecured claim against the debtor.

=== 2012–2016: Rebrand as 4Licensing Corporation ===

A meeting was scheduled on December 13, 2012, to confirm 4Kids&#x27; plan to exit bankruptcy. The same day, the New York bankruptcy judge sent 4Kids Entertainment Inc. on its way out of Chapter 11 protection Thursday, overruling an objection by the American Kennel Club Inc. over a licensing agreement and approving its reorganization plan, which calls for the full payment of claims.

On December 21, 2012, 4Kids Entertainment was renamed 4Licensing Corporation.

=== 2016–2017: Second bankruptcy and closure ===
On September 21, 2016, 4Licensing Corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy; the bankruptcy plan became effective on February 7, 2017, and the company immediately ceased operations thereafter.

== Licenses and productions ==

4Kids Entertainment licensed a wide variety of media products, ranging from video games and television programs to toy lines featuring the Royal Air Force. 4Kids focused on licensing content for the children&#x27;s market. including content for both boys and girls. Many of its licenses came from dubs of Japanese anime, including &quot;Fighting Foodons&quot;, and &quot;Shaman King&quot;, while others are Western animations or properties like &quot;Chaotic&quot; or &quot;Back to the Future: The Animated Series&quot;.

Most programs were either licensed out to local stations, or broadcast on their dedicated programming block 4Kids TV. Typically, 4Kids would retain several properties on hiatus (such as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! GX&quot;), or in production to allow for turnover of their existing products. 4Kids also licensed, and merchandised, a number of non-animation based products, such as calendars like &quot;The Dog&quot;, and toys like &quot;Cabbage Patch Kids&quot;.

== Criticism and controversy ==

During its operation as 4Kids Entertainment, the company faced intense criticism from viewers over the company&#x27;s extensive editing and localization of the anime and other non-American series they licensed. Practices like censorship, story editing, music editing, and their &quot;Americanization&quot; of Japanese culture references, were changed to be more American. One example included characters eating rice balls commenting that they were eating jelly doughnuts in their dub of the original &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime.

At the 2019 Fan Expo Canada, Eric Stuart, who was the voice of Brock and James in the 4Kids dub of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, the voice of Seto Kaiba in the English dub of &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;, and who was also part of the production side, mentioned why 4Kids&#x27; dubs had this censorship. He explained that American culture has a different sensitivity to certain content compared to Japanese culture, and networks on Saturday mornings had standards that would forbid certain inappropriate content like firearms, sexual references, religious references, display or mention of death, alcohol, cigarettes, and other content that is considered offensive to American audiences. As the censorship is dictated by the networks and not the production company itself, 4Kids would submit the scripts and footage of their dubs to the networks their dubs air on, and then the executives of those networks would review them. Then after they reviewed it, they would tell 4Kids to cut out certain scenes and edit inappropriate content to something particular like changing Sanji&#x27;s cigarette to a lollipop in &quot;One Piece&quot;, or changing a stone that looks like a cross to something non-religious for their dubs to pass the network&#x27;s standards. He also pointed out that &quot;Pokémon&quot;, and anime as a whole, wouldn&#x27;t be as wildly popular as it is today if companies like 4Kids didn&#x27;t air it on network television instead of being in the back of a video store.

At the 2016 Metrocon, Eric Stuart also explained the &quot;Americanization&quot; in 4Kids&#x27; dubs. He stated that those edits were international edits. When companies like 4Kids purchase the licensing to Japanese anime, the anime not only was redubbed into English but also redubbed into multiple languages because companies like 4Kids were used to distribute the anime to other countries by using their dubs and licensing them to other countries to have their dubs be used to distribute the anime. The Japanese food products being changed, and Japanese references being removed were requested by those Japanese anime companies because they wanted their anime to be distributed worldwide and wanted international audiences to relate to their products much easier. So, while the Japanese anime companies remove the Japanese text on signs, 4Kids removed the scenes involving Japanese references and changed the names of the Japanese food products like rice balls to something more international like donuts while only occasionally changing the animation to the foods since making animation changes causes a rise in production costs and they already have to make plenty of animation changes in their dubs.

A March 2006 study by the Parents Television Council, a conservative advocacy group, on violence in children&#x27;s television programs claimed that the 4Kids dub of &quot;Shaman King&quot; was still too violent for children.

<doc id="930567" wikidata="Q1647162" url="?curid=930567" title="Treaty of al-Hudaybiya">
<text>The Treaty of al-Hudaybiya () was an event that took place during the lifetime of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. It was a pivotal treaty between Muhammad, representing the state of Medina, and the tribe of the Quraysh in Mecca in March 628 (corresponding to Dhu al-Qi&#x27;dah, AH 6). The treaty helped to decrease tension between the two cities, affirmed peace for a period of 10 years, and authorised Muhammad&#x27;s followers to return the following year in a peaceful pilgrimage, which was later known as the First Pilgrimage.
==Background==
As a result of the rejection of his message and the persecution of his followers, the Islamic prophet Muhammad left his hometown of Mecca in 622 and migrated with his followers to the oasis town of Medina. There, he had more followers and founded a local power base. On three occasions, his forces battled with his Meccan opponents, led by his own tribe, the Quraysh. Mecca was thus a no-go area for the Muslims, with its old sanctuary of the Ka&#x27;ba. Although it had been a pilgrimage center from the pre-Islamic times, it seems that the Muslims were enjoined to perform pilgrimage to the Ka&#x27;ba only in the Medinan period. The Muslims had so far prayed by facing toward Jerusalem, but at some point in Medina, Muhammad reportedly received a divine revelation ordering him to face Mecca instead.

==Traditional account==

In March 628, following a dream that he was circumambulating the Ka&#x27;ba, Muhammad decided to set out for pilgrimage. Anticipating violent Meccan response, he invited his Bedouin and tribal allies in the outskirts of Medina to join him, but the majority declined, probably because they saw no prospect of booty or anticipating hostilities. Muhammad with a group of some 1,500 Muslims of Medina, as well as some tribal allies, marched towards Mecca to perform the Umrah (lesser pilgrimage). There are conflicting accounts as to whether the Muslims carried weapons. They were dressed as pilgrims and had sacrificial animals with them. On getting the news, the Meccans mistook the approach as an attack and sent a 200-strong cavalry force to stop it. Muhammad avoided the force by taking an unconventional route and pitched his tents at the place of Ḥudaybiya, on the border of the sacred territory of the Ka&#x27;ba.

The Quraysh sent their emissaries to negotiate with him to whom he declared that he had come to perform the pilgrimage and had no hostile intentions. The Quraysh nevertheless considered it weakness and a declaration of defeat to let him enter the city unconditionally. They are reported to have said: &quot;Even if he has come not wanting to fight, by God, he shall never enter [the sanctuary] by force against our will, nor shall the bedouin ever [have cause to] say that about us&quot;. At one point, he sent his close aid Uthman to Mecca to carry out negotiations. A rumour spread that he had been slain. Muhammad vowed to avenge his death and took pledge of his followers to fight the Meccans to end. The pledge became known as the Pledge of the Tree (). The rumour turned out to be false, and the Quraysh sent their emissary, Suhayl ibn Amr, to reach a settlement. After negotiations, the parties agreed to resolve the matter peacefully and a treaty was drawn up. The main points stated:

* There will be a truce between both parties for ten years.
* Whoever flees to Muhammad from the Quraysh without the permission of his guardian will be sent back to the Quraysh, but whoever comes to the Quraysh from the Muslims will not be sent back.
* Whoever wishes to enter into a covenant with Muhammad will be allowed to do so, and whoever wishes to enter into a covenant with the Quraysh will be allowed to do so.
* The Muslims will return to Medina without performing the pilgrimage but will be allowed the following year and would stay in Mecca for three days during which time the Quraysh will vacate the city. The Muslims will carry no weapons except sheathed swords.

The document was written by Ali. As he was writing, &quot;This is what Muhammad, the apostle of God, has agreed with Suhayl b. &#x27;Amr&quot;, Suhayl objected that he did not believe in his prophethood, hence he could write only his name, to which Muhammad consented. After the document was written, Suhayl&#x27;s son Abu Jandal converted to Islam and turned up to join the Muslims but was handed over to Suhayl in keeping with the treaty. Umar and some other Muslims were unhappy about the truce with the people whom they regarded as the enemies of God. Muhammad called his followers to shave their heads and sacrifice their animals. They were reluctant to do so but followed after he had set an example. While Muslims then returned to Medina, the Sura 48 of the Qur&#x27;an was revealed.

==Aftermath==
Those converts who later escaped to Medina were returned in accordance with the treaty. Abu Basir, one of the returned, escaped to the sea coast and was later joined by some 70 others, including Abu Jandal. They formed a guerrilla band and started raiding Meccan caravans to Syria. The Meccans eventually asked Muhammad to take them back to Medina. An exception to the treaty was later created unilaterally by the Muslims when some Muslim women from Mecca escaped to Medina, after which Muhammad received Surah Al-Mumtahanah (60:10) which forbade the return of these women to the disbelievers .

==Assessment and legacy==
In the long term, the treaty proved advantageous to the Muslims and is often regarded as an &quot;important step&quot; in Muhammad&#x27;s consolidation of power. By signing the treaty, the Quraysh implicitly acknowledged Muhammad as their equal, and by gaining access to the pilgrimage at the Ka&#x27;ba, Muhammad was able to increase Islam&#x27;s appeal to those tribes who held the Ka&#x27;ba in high regard. The Muhammad biographer Ibn Hisham later wrote: &quot;No previous victory in Islam was greater than this... when there was an armistice and war was abolished and men met in safety and consulted together none talked about Islam intelligently without entering it.&quot; The truce enabled Muhammad to expand his dominion elsewhere in Arabia unhindered. The historian Fred Donner has suggested that the very purpose of the attempted pilgrimage was to secure a truce with the Meccans since Medina was trapped between two hostile cities (the Jewish stronghold of Khaybar to the north and Mecca to the south) and was very vulnerable. However, he could not simply beg the Meccans for a truce; by skillfully crafting the situation, he got it without asking. It was nevertheless a &quot;desperate gamble&quot;, which could have ended in disaster had the Quraysh opted not to make peace. Soon afterwards, he besieged and neutralized Khaybar. Other tribes were then free to align to either side, and Muhammad was able to win over some of those formerly allied with the Quraysh. According to Islamicist Montgomery Watt, the treaty, which meant lifting of the Medinan blockade of the Meccan trade with Syria and the granting to the Quraysh other concessions, was intended by Muhammad to foster better relations with the Quraysh and to attract them towards Islam.

<text>Christian Wirth (born in the 1970s), better known by the pseudonym RaD Man, is an American computer artist and historian. He works in the field of ANSI art, a method of creating art using a limited set of text characters and color escape codes based loosely on the relevant ANSI standard (X3.64: Control Sequences for Video Terminals and Peripherals).

RaD Man was initially involved with the Aces of ANSI Art (AAA), an organization which created ANSI artwork for a number of computer bulletin board systems from 1989 to 1991. With others, he created the &quot;ANSI Creators in Demand&quot; group (also known as ACiD).

Starting in 1990, ACiD released artwork on an &quot;ad hoc&quot; network of BBSes, updating a collection of art known as the &quot;ACiD Acquisition&quot; by sending a compressed file of all the completed work up to that time. By 1992, the increasing file size made this process impractical, and this led to the development of the artpack, where groups of artists (including ACiD) would upload monthly update packages instead. In early 2004, RaD Man directed and produced ACiD Acquisition Update #100, colloquially known as &quot;ACiD-100, the final artpack released by ACiD as a group.

In 1996, RaD Man founded the ACiD Artpacks Archive to collect the artpacks created by the hundreds of groups that followed in ACiD&#x27;s footsteps. This collection eventually was transferred to DVD as &quot;Dark Domain: the artpacks.acid.org collection&quot; in 2004.

Since 2002, RaD Man has worked as a historian and spokesperson for the artscene, collecting information and interviews with the artists involved, and creating reports and presentations on the lineage of computer art. Some of this work includes &quot;The ARTS&quot;, a talk radio show which discusses the many different facets of the creative computer underground scenes and the Pilgrimage 2004 demoparty.

In 2006, RaD Man became a member of cDc&#x27;s Ninja Strike Force.

In 2007, he co-founded Blockparty with Jason Scott, a North American demoparty. The event was produced in cooperation with Notacon and took place annually in Cleveland, Ohio, from 2007 to 2010.

In November 2009, ANSI art group Blocktronics paid tribute to RaD Man and his contributions to the ANSI art scene by releasing an artpack titled &quot;Codename Chris Wirth&quot;.

<doc id="930573" wikidata="Q4637666" url="?curid=930573" title="41st Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 41st Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army National Guard composed primarily of units from the Pacific Northwest. The division saw active service in World War I and World War II, receiving the nickname “Jungleers” during the latter.

Organized in 1917 after the American entry into World War I, the division was selected as a replacement division after being deployed to France as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. Its infantry units were used to provide individual replacements and the division functioned as a replacement depot. The 41st Division was reorganized in the National Guard during the interwar period, consisting of units from Oregon, Washington, Montana, Idaho and Wyoming. Sent to Australia after the Attack on Pearl Harbor, the 41st became one of the first Army units to engage in offensive ground combat operations during World War II when elements of the division were committed to the New Guinea campaign in the last months of 1942. The division suffered its heaviest casualties in the 1944 Battle of Biak at the conclusion of the campaign. In the final months of the war, the division took a major role in the liberation of the Southern Philippines, including the Palawan, Zamboanga, Eastern Mindanao and Sulu Archipelago operations. The division ended its active service in the occupation of Japan.

Postwar, the 41st Infantry Division was re-established in the National Guard, split between Oregon and Washington. The 41st Infantry Brigade was formed from mainly Oregon elements of the division in 1965 and in 1968 the division was eliminated during reductions of the National Guard. Its former units were used to form two separate brigades, the 41st Infantry Brigade in Oregon, and the 81st Infantry Brigade in Washington.

==World War I==
The 41st was ordered to be organized by the War Department on 18 July 1917, about three months after the American entry into World War I, from National Guard units from Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington state, and Wyoming. Additional units from Colorado, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and the District of Columbia were later added to complete the division. It trained at Camp Greene, North Carolina. It consisted of the 81st Infantry Brigade (161st and 162nd Infantry Regiments) and the 82nd Infantry Brigade (163rd and 164th Infantry Regiments). On 26 November 1917 the 41st Division embarked for Europe as part of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF), commanded by General John J. Pershing. Men of the 41st were aboard the &quot;SS Tuscania&quot; when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat and sunk off the coast of Northern Ireland.

In France the 41st Division received a major disappointment when it was designated a replacement division and did not go into combat as a unit. The majority of its infantry personnel went to the 1st, 2nd, 32nd and 42nd Infantry Divisions where they served throughout the war. The 147th Field Artillery Regiment was attached mostly to the 32nd Division and saw action at the Third Battle of the Aisne, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and other areas. The 146th and 148th Regiments of the 66th Field Artillery Brigade were also attached as corps artillery units and participated in the battles of Château-Thierry, Aisne-Marne, Saint-Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensive.

==Interwar period==

The 41st Division headquarters arrived at the port of Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the USS Leviathan on 12 February 1919, and was demobilized on 22 February at Camp Dix, New Jersey. Pursuant to the National Defense Act of 1920, the 41st Division was reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921 and allotted to the states of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming, and assigned to the IX Corps. The division headquarters was organized and federally recognized on 3 January 1930 at Portland, Oregon, with Major General George A. White appointed as commander; he would remain in command until his death in 1941.

The designated mobilization training center for the “Sunset” Division was Camp Murray, Washington. The division staff, composed of personnel from all five states, came together to conduct joint training for several summers before World War II, usually at Fort Lewis or Camp Murray. However, for the 1938 camp, the staff assembled for training at Fort William Henry Harrison, near Helena, Montana. The division staff also participated in the Fourth Army command post exercise at Fort Lewis in 1935 and 1936, and at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1939. From 1922 to 1939, the division’s subordinate units generally held separate summer camps at locations within their respective states: Oregon units at the state military reservation at Camp Clatsop; Washington units at Camp Murray, Montana units at Fort William Henry Harrison, and Idaho units at Boise Barracks. For the 1937 camp, the division participated in the Ninth Corps Area phase of the Fourth Army maneuvers at Centralia-Fort Lewis held in August. The 41st paired with the 3rd Division, and a &quot;Blue Army&quot; drawn from the 41st Division attempted a combat crossing of the Nisqually River, which was defended by a &quot;Red Army&quot; under the command of Brigadier General (later US Army Chief of Staff) George Marshall, then the commander of the 3rd Division&#x27;s 5th Infantry Brigade at Vancouver Barracks. The 41st Division&#x27;s mission was accomplished by a night crossing of the river. In 1940, the “Sunset” Division again participated in the Fourth Army maneuvers at Fort Lewis, this time as part of the provisional IX Corps.

==World War II==
===Preparation===

The 41st Division&#x27;s annual summer camp at Fort Lewis in June and July 1940 was extended from two weeks to three, and on 16 September 1940 with President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s signing of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, the 41st Division was inducted into federal service for one year. By this time, a National Guard recruiting campaign had raised the strength of the division to 14,000 – still well short of its war establishment strength of 18,500. The difference was made up by 7,000 Selective Service men, the first of whom arrived in February 1941.

The division was initially accommodated in a tented camp at Camp Murray until the construction of new permanent barracks at nearby Fort Lewis could be completed. Delayed by strike action at sawmills in Washington and Oregon and by maritime workers, the project fell behind schedule, and the entire division was not accommodated in the new barracks until April 1941.

The 41st Division was grouped with the 3rd Division as part of IX Corps. In May 1941, the two divisions moved to the Hunter Liggett Military Reservation where June war games pitted them against Major General Joseph Stilwell&#x27;s 7th Division and the 40th Division. Large scale maneuvers continued in August on the Olympic Peninsula, with IX Corps defending Tacoma, Washington until the two divisions from California could arrive to assist.

General White died of complications of dysentery on 23 November 1941 and was replaced by Brigadier General Horace H. Fuller, the former commander of the 3rd Division Artillery. Promoted to Major General on 15 December 1941, he would remain commander until June 1944.

Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the 41st Infantry Division was deployed to defend the coastline of Washington and Oregon against a possible Japanese landing. The 218th Field Artillery had earlier been assigned to the defense of the Philippines, and was at sea &quot;en route&quot; when news of the attacks came; it was turned back to San Francisco and eventually rejoined the division.

The 41st Division was officially renamed the 41st Infantry Division on 2 August 1941. In January and February 1942, it was reorganized as a &quot;triangular&quot; division, losing the 161st Infantry, which eventually joined the 25th Infantry Division, and other units.

===Deployed overseas===
In February 1942, the 41st Infantry Division was alerted for overseas movement. It handed over its coastal defence responsibilities to the 3rd Infantry Division and concentrated at Fort Lewis. First to depart was the 162nd Infantry, 641st Tank Destroyer Battalion, and 41st Reconnaissance Troop, which entrained later that month for Fort Dix. This group departed the Brooklyn Navy Yard on 3 March 1942 and sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal, reaching Melbourne on 9 April. They were among the first U.S. military units to be engaged in offensive ground combat operations. (The others were the 32nd who preceded them into combat on New Guinea; the Americal and the 1st Marine on Guadalcanal, Carlson&#x27;s Raiders on Makin Island; and the 9th, 3rd Infantry, 34 and the 2nd Armored Divisions who fought in North Africa.)

A second group consisting of Division Headquarters, the 163rd Infantry, 41st Signal Company, 116th Engineer Battalion, 167th Field Artillery Battalion, 116th Medical Battalion, and 116th Quartermaster Battalion embarked from San Francisco on 19 March in a convoy that included the liner RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. This convoy reached Australia before the first, on 6 April. Because Melbourne could not accommodate the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;, it unloaded at Sydney and the troops and cargo were moved to Melbourne by rail and smaller Dutch ships. That month the remainder of the division, including the 186th Infantry and 146th, 205th and 218th Field Artillery battalions entrained at Fort Lewis for San Francisco, from whence they sailed for Australia, arriving on 13 May. As each contingent arrived it moved to a camp near Seymour, Victoria, where training was conducted at the nearby Australian Army base at Puckapunyal.

In July the division moved by rail to Rockhampton, Queensland. The division had arrived in Australia with a reputation as &quot;the top ranking National Guard division and one of the three top divisions in the whole Army&quot;, a reason for its early deployment.

Major General Robert L. Eichelberger, whose I Corps headquarters arrived in Rockhampton in August, ordered the division to commence training in jungle warfare. Each infantry battalion in turn was sent down to Toorbul, Queensland for training in amphibious warfare by the Australian Army.

===Sanananda===
In December, General Douglas MacArthur decided to commit more American troops to the Battle of Buna-Gona. The 163rd Regimental Combat Team, under the command of Colonel Jens A. Doe, was alerted on 14 December 1942. It arrived at Port Moresby on 27 December. The first elements, which included the 1st Battalion and regimental headquarters, flew over the Owen Stanley Range to Popondetta and Dobodura on 30 December, where they came under the command of Australian Lieutenant General Edmund Herring&#x27;s Advanced New Guinea Force.
The 163rd Regimental Combat Team was attached to Major General George Alan Vasey&#x27;s 7th Australian Division and Doe assumed command of the positions on the Sanananda track from Brigadier Ivan Dougherty on 3 January 1943. The front line consisted of a raised road with Japanese positions on relatively dry ground astride it, surrounded by jungle swamp. Roadblocks had been established behind the Japanese positions but they had not been budged; both sides resupplied their positions through the swamp. Vasey&#x27;s plan was for the Americans to fix the Japanese in position while he attacked with Brigadier George Wootten&#x27;s 18th Australian Infantry Brigade, supported by Australian armor and artillery consisting of M3 Stuart light tanks of the 2/6th Armoured Regiment and 25 pounders of the 2/1st Field Regiment.

Doe, &quot;eager to come to close grips with the Japanese&quot;, requested permission to launch an attack against the enemy Perimeters Q and R between his two roadblocks. Herring and Vasey thought that he was underestimating the enemy, but Vasey gave permission for the attack, provided that it would not jeopardize the main plan. The attack went ahead on the afternoon of 8 January 1943 but both attacking companies of the 1st Battalion, 163rd Infantry encountered heavy fire and were thrown back. First Lieutenant Harold R. Fisk became the first officer of the division to be killed in action. His body could not be immediately recovered. He was posthumously awarded the Silver Star. The roadblock position he had attacked from was named Fisk in his honor.

The first part of Vasey&#x27;s plan involved the blocking of the Killerton Trail to prevent the Japanese from using it as an escape route, and to provide a jumping off point for a later advance by the 18th Infantry Brigade. The 2nd Battalion, 163rd Infantry, under Major Walter R. Rankin, set out early on 9 January 1943. Company G, covering the flank of the advance, was strongly engaged by Japanese heavy machine gun, mortar, and rifle fire. The remainder of the battalion established themselves astride the trail in a new position which was named Rankin after the battalion commander. The attack had cost four dead and six wounded. More casualties would be taken holding the position over the next few days.

On 10 January, a patrol from the 163rd Infantry discovered that the Japanese had unaccountably evacuated Perimeter Q. This was occupied at once by Company A, which sent out tree snipers and patrols to harass the enemy and feel out the contour of the Perimeter R, which was now open to attack from all sides. The Japanese had left behind a considerable quantity of material, including a water-cooled .50 caliber machine gun. The Japanese had evidently been very hungry and there was evidence of cannibalism.

With the roadblock established, the 18th Infantry Brigade launched the main attack against Perimeter P on 12 January. Vasey&#x27;s plan of attack was based on the assumption that the Japanese defenders had no antitank guns. This proved to be incorrect, and three Stuart tanks were hit by fire from a concealed 37mm anti-tank gun. Although the 2/9th and 2/12th Infantry Battalions killed some Japanese and gained some ground, the Japanese position remained intact. The attack cost 18th Infantry Brigade 34 killed, 66 wounded and 51 missing.

Wootten reported that to continue the attack under the existing conditions could only lead to heavy casualties. Vasey directed him to continue aggressive patrolling.
They had completely misread the situation. On 14 January, a patrol from the 163rd Infantry captured a very sick Japanese soldier. Taken to 7th Division headquarters for interrogation, the man revealed that the Japanese commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tsukamoto Hatsuo, had ordered all able bodied men to evacuate Perimeter P, leaving the sick and wounded to hold it to the last. Vasey ordered an immediate attack. Supported by a troop of the 2/1st Field Regiment and their own mortars, Rankin&#x27;s 2nd Battalion reduced the three small enemy perimeters to the south of their position and advanced to meet the Australians on the Killerton Track. By early afternoon the Australians and Americans had also joined hands on the Sanananda Road as well. Some 152 Japanese were killed and six captured.

On 15 January, a platoon of A Company managed to get inside Perimeter R undetected. The rest of the company followed, taking the Japanese defenders by surprise. Company C joined in the attack from the Fisk while Company B attacked from the west. Bunker after bunker fell to small groups attacking with rifles, grenades and submachine guns but the Japanese resistance was desperate and the entire position was not taken until the next day.

The Australians carried out a wide envelopment, reaching the sea on 16 January, but the 163rd Infantry remained confronted by Perimeters S, T, and U, although these were not immediately located. A first attack succeeded in establishing a new position called AD. On 19 January, an attack supported by 250 25-pounder and 750 M1 Mortar rounds faltered after a Japanese mortar round killed Company I&#x27;s commander, Captain Duncan V. Dupree and its First Sergeant, James W. Boland. In his situation report, under &quot;American troops&quot;, Vasey wrote &quot;Heb. 13:8&quot; (&quot;Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today and for ever.&quot;) But the next day, Companies A and K managed to fight their way into Perimeter T. This softened resistance from Perimeter S, and Companies B and C were then able to capture it. Some 525 Japanese dead were counted after the attack. Finally, on 22 January, Companies I and L were able to capture Perimeter U, counting another 69 Japanese dead.

In just three weeks of fighting in January 1943, the 163rd Infantry lost 85 killed, 16 other deaths, 238 wounded and 584 sick, a total of 923 casualties.

===Salamaua===

The 162nd Infantry, commanded by Colonel A. R. MacKechnie, ended its long period of waiting and got its baptism of fire in early 1943. The fight, which resulted in the fall of Salamaua and Lae, lasted for 76 days after the initial landing. The Presidential unit citation awarded the 1st Battalion, 162nd Infantry Regiment, reads &quot;for outstanding performance of duty against the enemy near Salamaua, New Guinea. On 29 and 30 June 1943, this battalion landed at Nassau Bay in one of the first amphibious operations by American forces in the Southwest Pacific Area, on a beach held by the enemy, and during a severe storm which destroyed 90 percent of the landing craft able to reach the beach. Moving inland through deep swamps, crossing swift rivers, cutting its way through dense jungle, over steep ridges, carrying by hand all weapons, ammunition, and food, assisted by only a limited number of natives, this battalion was in contact with the enemy for 76 consecutive days without rest or relief. All operations after the initial landing were far inland. Living conditions were most severe because of constant rain, mud, absence of any shelter, tenacious enemy, and mountainous terrain. The supply of rations, ammunition and equipment was meager. For five weeks all personnel lived on rations dropped by airplane, for days at a time on half rations. Malaria and battle casualties greatly depleted their ranks, but at no time was there a let-up in morale or in determination to destroy the enemy. Each officer and enlisted man was called upon to give his utmost of courage and stamina. The battalion killed 584 Japanese during this period, while suffering casualties of 11 officers and 176 enlisted men. Cutting the Japanese supply line near Mubo, exerting constant pressure on his flank, the valiant and sustained efforts of this battalion were in large part instrumental in breaking enemy resistance and forcing his withdrawal from Salamaua on 12 September 1943. General Orders 91.&quot;

===Hollandia===
The 41st Infantry Division returned to Australia for rest, reinforcements, and re-equipping. By April 1944, an armada of a hundred ships carrying 25,000 men and tons of equipment had been assembled for an attack on the Humboldt Bay area of New Guinea to secure Japanese-held airfields. A massive naval bombardment was followed by air strikes to soften the area for the amphibious landing. The 162nd Infantry moved north to overrun its objective, Hollandia Town, while the 186th Infantry moved west to capture two airfields. On the second day, a low-flying enemy bomber made a direct hit on an American ammunition dump. The subsequent explosions ignited a two-day firestorm that consumed all American ammunition and rations landed in that beach area, and caused 24 deaths and over 100 injuries. Rationing became necessary. Soft sand bogged tanks, and LVTs became mired along swampy roads. The terrain was favorable for the Japanese defense, but most Japanese troops had moved to Wewak, where the next Allied thrust was expected. As a result, casualties were light. High-ranking Army and Navy officers who had witnessed the landing described it as the perfect amphibious assault.&quot;

===Aitape===

While the 162nd Infantry and 186th Infantry were making the landings in Humboldt Bay, the 163rd Regimental Combat Team, backbone of a task force of 22,500 men under the command of General Doe, was making a simultaneous landing at Aitape. The mission of this force was to rapidly seize the airfields in the Aitape-Tadji area and to prepare them quickly to accommodate one fighter group. The naval bombardment was so well executed that the enemy fled inland. The advance was so rapid that engineer units pronounced the captured airstrip ready for use two days after the landing. Some enemy resistance was encountered by patrols, but was pushed back effectively. On 3 May the 163rd was relieved by the 32nd Division.

===Wakde Island===
The occupation of Wakde was to be a shore-to-shore operation, it was too small an island to permit a major landing force. Following a naval bombardment on 17 May, the 163rd Infantry landed four companies (A, B, C and F), seized the beachhead and began the push inland assisted by four M4 Sherman medium tanks. The companies executed a successful flanking maneuver which left the important airfield in the middle of the island in Allied control after only two days of fighting. The campaign was unique for its brevity and conclusiveness, and marked the first time that terrain and conditions permitted the full use of tanks.

===Biak===

The 41st Division&#x27;s bloodiest engagement was on the island of Biak, off New Guinea&#x27;s coast. It marked the first time the division had fought as a whole, and resulted in the defeat of over ten thousand well-entrenched and well-led Japanese forces. The campaign extended from May through August 1944, and the 41st earned a new nickname, &quot;The Jungleers.&quot; The first tank battle of the Pacific Theater occurred on Biak, when Japanese Type 95 &quot;Ha-Go&quot; tanks attempted to attack the beachhead. They were destroyed by US Army M4 Sherman tanks. Casualties on Biak were 435 Americans KIA and 2,360 WIA. The Japanese lost an estimated 6,125 KIA, with 460 POWs, and 360 Formosan POWs. After finally securing the island, American troops developed southern Biak into a large airbase and staging area. Biak contained three aerodromes; Mokmer, Borokoe and Sorido. The capture of Mokmer Drome was particularly challenging due to the proximity of cliffs of coral that provided very strategic cover for Japanese heavy guns. Because the 41st failed to repeat the swift progress made in prior landings, General Fuller was relieved as commander of Hurricane Task Force. Continuous heavy fighting, intense heat and scarcity of water had tired the task force troops to a critical degree. General Eichelberger and General Doe were to prove able successors, but it took until 20 August to officially terminate a campaign that had begun with beach landings on 27 May 1944.

===Palawan===

The 186th Regimental Combat Team stormed ashore on Palawan on 28 February 1945 in the first action in the Philippine Islands. The local airfields were found to be unserviceable due to the pre-landing bombardments, and the town of Puerto Princesa was mostly destroyed. However, in three years of campaigning, this was the first semblance of civilization. American casualties were 12 killed and 56 wounded. Filipino casualties were 55 killed and 120 wounded. Japanese losses were 890 dead and 20 POWs. The operation terminated on 20 June 1945.

===Zamboanga===

Zamboanga, and the Sulu Archipelago.
The massive assault on the Philippine island of Mindanao began with naval and air bombardments along the beach defenses east of Zamboanga City, forcing the enemy to evacuate these excellent defensive positions. The 162nd and 163rd Infantry Regiments made their landings, and the enemy fled into the hills in disorder. A series of counterattacks faced the Jungleers, but they prevailed despite well-established hill positions, which were overrun by 24 March. By the end of March, the 186th Infantry had rejoined the Division and relieved elements of the 163rd, who proceeded to the island of Jolo, followed by more island-hopping to Tawi-Tawi. The conquest of the entire Sulu chain of islands left just mopping up to be done. The Southern Philippines had been freed from Japanese oppression.

===End of the war and occupation of Japan===
After the fall of the Philippines, the division began training for the attack on Japan itself, but surrender came first. The division did move to Japan where it occupied the island of Honshū for a few months. The 41st Infantry Division was inactivated at Kure-Hiro, Japan on 31 December 1945.

==Post war==
At the conclusion of World War II, the National Guard was almost completely demobilized, its Soldiers separated from military service, and sent directly to civilian life leaving virtually no National Guard at all. Despite this immediate purge of manpower, the War Department was already planning its reconstitution. The War Department published a postwar policy statement on October 13, 1945 which called for the rebuilding of the Regular Army, National Guard of the United States, and the Organized Reserve Corps. This ultimately led to the decision to reconstitute 27 divisions within the National Guard, to include the 41st. Of these 27, ten of them would be divided among multiple states.

Preliminary plans for the post-war reorganization of the 41st was to maintain its triangle task organization from the Second World War and proposed it split between Idaho, Oregon, and Washington. However, after Oregon’s desire to reorganize two of its infantry regiments of the Division, modifications to the plan were made between Idaho and Oregon, with concurrence of Chief, National Guard Bureau, so that the final distribution of the 41st Division was split between Oregon and Washington. This division of the 41st between the two states required an agreement between the them as to the assignment of the Division Commander and Division headquarters. Eventually, the Adjutants General of Oregon and Washington agreed to a rotation of certain staff personnel coinciding with the rotation of the Division Commander, with each state maintaining a partial Division headquarters element in Portland and Seattle, respectively. Initially, it was agreed that the first Division Commander would go to Oregon, but only on the condition that the first command be given to Brigadier General Thomas E. Rilea, formerly the Assistant Division Commander, with the new Assistant Division Commander to Washington. Then every four years afterwards, the seats would rotate states. However, if General Rilea was not able to qualify for federal recognition as Division Commander, then the position would at once revert to the Washington and the Assistant Division Commander to Oregon. On August 2, 1946, it was announced that General Rilea had been disqualified for military service for medical reasons and the first Division Commander of the 41st since post-war reorganization would go to Washington.

In the mid-1950s, the Division followed suit with the rest of the Army reorganizing itself into a Pentomic division. This concept was derived as a means to create five somewhat autonomous elements within a division, called battle groups, that could activate and attack quicker than a brigade as a new strategy to prepare for tactical nuclear warfare. Each battle group was commanded by a colonel and comprised five maneuver companies and a support company. The regiment and battalion echelons were removed and the Combat Arms Regimental System (CARS) was adopted to account for the significant shift in unit lineage and heritage.

The Division saw yet another reorganization in March 1963 when it adopted the Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) concept returning the Division back to a triangular task organization, but this transformation was short lived. Assessing a lack of necessity, the Secretary of Defense McNamara reduced the number of National Guard combat divisions from 15 to 8, in 1967, however the total number of separate brigades went up to 18 from 7. As a result of McNamara’s decision, the Division was divided into two infantry brigades, the 41st Infantry Brigade in Oregon, and the 81st Infantry Brigade in Washington, the later reactivating the Division’s original Washington brigade under its World War I task organization. The 41st Infantry Division deactivated in 1968.

The 41st Infantry Division holds annual reunions for its World War II veterans. In 2008 the reunion was held in Washington, D.C. The veterans had the opportunity to visit Arlington National Cemetery and hold a special wreath laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Many of the veterans also visited the World War II memorial for the first time. Several were accompanied by family (including spouses, children, grandchildren, and in a couple of cases, great-grandchildren). &quot;The Jungeleer&quot; is the publication of the 41st Infantry and is available to all former members of this division.

<text>The 38th Infantry Division is an infantry division of the United States Army and part of the Indiana National Guard. It is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, and contains Army National Guard units from across the Midwest.

Formed in 1917, the division&#x27;s special designation &quot;Cyclone&quot; refers to when the division&#x27;s training camp at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, was damaged by a tornado. It is also nicknamed &quot;Avengers of Bataan&quot; due to its efforts during the Pacific War in World War II. 

Deployed to France in the closing days of the Great War, the 38th Division was broken up to fill vacancies in units already in combat. After the war, the 38th Division demobilized. After a brief period of inactivity, it was reconstituted and reorganized in the National Guard on 16 March 1923.

The 38th Division was inducted into federal service on 17 January 1941 as the United States prepared for entry into World War II. The Division returned to Camp Shelby to reorganize as a triangular infantry division and train for combat. The 38th Infantry Division deployed to the Pacific theater in January 1944, initially to New Guinea where the division saw limited combat after final training. In December, the division deployed into Leyte, Philippines to support clearing and security operations. On 29 January 1945, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the combat landing against the Japanese held Southern Zambales Province on the island of Luzon. Afterwards, the 38th Infantry Division took part in the operations to clear Zig Zag Pass and the Bataan peninsula, and to secure Corregidor and Manila Bay. In recognition of their contributions in clearing the Philippines, the 38th Infantry Division received the nickname &quot;The Avengers of Bataan&quot;.

Quickly demobilized after World War II, the 38th Infantry Division was reorganized and federally recognized on 5 March 1947 at Indianapolis, Indiana. During the intervening years, the 38th Infantry Division underwent numerous reorganizations while still retaining the designation as an infantry division. The 38th Infantry Division headquarters mobilized in support of Hurricane Katrina relief operations in 2005, exercising command and control over all National Guard elements deployed in the state of Mississippi. Since 11 September 2001, units of the division have participated in Operation Enduring Freedom (in Kuwait, Afghanistan, the Balkans, Cuba, and the Horn of Africa) and Operation Iraqi Freedom. In 2009, the 38th Infantry Division provided a headquarters element (designated Task Force Cyclone) to command and control counterinsurgency operations in Regional Command East, Afghanistan from August 2009 through June 2010.

The 38th Infantry Division headquarters had responsibility for the domestic all-hazards response team (DART) mission in support of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the event of a major incident in the eastern half of the United States. 

Most recently the 38th Infantry Division headquarters deployed in support of Operation Spartan Shield (OSS) in 2019 and 2020. Operation Spartan Shield includes operations in Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and United Arab Emirates (UAE). 38th Infantry Division Soldiers have also supported COVID-19 relief operations, as well as civil disturbance operations in Indianapolis and Washington, D.C.

==Insignia==
The division&#x27;s shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) is a spade shaped shield, bordered in green, with the right half red, the left half blue. Superimposed on the shield is a white monogram &quot;CY&quot; which alludes to the divisional nickname &quot;the Cyclone Division.&quot; The distinctive unit insignia (DUI) is in the shape of a clover leaf in memory of the original badge for non-color bearing divisional units. The lightning flashes represent the unit&#x27;s participation in three World War II campaigns, with the Luzon assault landing recognized by the arrowhead tip in the center flash. The cloud and lightning flashes are an allusion to the cyclone. The colors blue, white and red refer to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation awarded to the unit for their part in liberating the country.

==History==
===World War I===
The 38th Infantry Division&#x27;s headquarters was activated at Camp Shelby on 25 August 1917, almost five months after the American entry into World War I, composed of units drawn from Indiana, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Major General William H. Sage, a Medal of Honor recipient from the Philippine–American War was its first commander. With new naming conventions issued by the War Department, National Guard regiments were given three-digit numbers from 101 through 300 (for example, the 1st Indiana Infantry Regiment became the 151st Infantry Regiment), and National Guard divisions were numbered from 26 through 75. Troops began to arrive at Camp Shelby, Mississippi for training in September. Once there, the 38th Division was organized into a &quot;square&quot; division, centered around two infantry brigades; the 75th Infantry Brigade and the 76th Infantry Brigade, the 138th, 139th, and 163rd Field Artillery Regiments, the 113th Engineer Regiment, the 113th Sanitary Train, and a separate signal battalion.

After constructing their base camp at Camp Shelby, the 38th Infantry Division began training in October. Equipment for training was chronically short, however, forcing leaders to fabricate dummy artillery pieces from wood and iron scrap, while the soldiers drilled with pieces of wood to simulate rifles and machine guns. In April 1918, a tornado struck Camp Shelby, damaging the division&#x27;s camp and killing one soldier, PVT Vaughn D. Beekman. On his assumption of command of the 38th Division on 30 August 1918, Major General Robert Lee Howze commemorated the tornado by announcing the division would be known in the future as the &quot;Cyclone Division&quot;.

The division arrived in France in October, at the height of the Meuse–Argonne offensive. Upon arrival, the division was largely stripped of officers and men, who served as replacements for other units of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) already in combat. Several of the regiments remained intact and conducted operations behind friendly lines. The 113th Engineer Battalion constructed railroads, telegraph and telephone wires. The 138th and 139th Field Artillery took part in collective training when the Armistice with Germany took effect on 11 November 1918. 

Of the officers and men from the 38th Division detailed to other units, 301 died during the Great War: 105 died in combat; 47 died from wounds; 68 from non-combat accidents or incidents; and 81 from complications arising from influenza or pneumonia.

*Commanders: Maj. Gen. William H. Sage (25 August 1917), Brig. Gen. Edward M. Lewis, ad interim, (19 September 1917), Brig. Gen. H. H. Whitney, ad interim, (8 November 1917), Maj. Gen. William H. Sage (12 December 1917), Brig. Gen. William H. Sage (15 March 1918), Brig. Gen. William V. Judson, ad interim, (15 April 1918), Brig. Gen. Augustine McIntyre Jr., ad interim, (12 July 1918), Brig. Gen. F. M. Caldwell, ad interim, (18 July 1918), Maj. Gen. Robert L. Howze (30 August 1918), Brig. Gen. F. M. Caldwell, ad interim, (18 October 1918), Maj. Gen. Robert L. Howze (27 October 1918).
*Inactivated: June 1919.

==Interwar period (1919-41)==
After the end of the World War, the National Guard divisions briefly remained inactive while the United States rapidly demobilized and returned to a peacetime footing. The experiences of the war convinced the War Department and Congress to retain a reserve structure in the event of a future war. A series of amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916 codified the structure of the Army of the United States to include the National Guard when in federal service. Within the text of the final amendment of August 1921 was the provision to &quot;preserve the names, numbers and other designations, flags and records of the divisions...that served in the World War&quot;.

At the company level, the first units were organized by spring 1921; by November 1921 the Indiana National Guard had approximately 4,000 soldiers in an active drilling status. Higher-level actions took longer, with the 38th Division headquarters not organized and federally recognized until March 1923, with Major General Robert H. Tyndall as the division commander. Tyndall well embodied the citizen-soldier concept. During the World War, Tyndall earned the Distinguished Service Medal and Croix de Guerre for his successful combat leadership of the 150th Field Artillery. In peacetime, he served as a bank vice-president and was deeply engaged in the organization of the American Legion. The majority of the divisional structure was allotted to Indiana, with the divisional headquarters established in Indianapolis. Besides the headquarters, the 76th Infantry Brigade (with the 151st and 152nd Infantry Regiments), 139th and 150th Field Artillery Regiments, and the 113th Engineer Regiment were allotted solely to Indiana. Kentucky organized the 75th Infantry Brigade (149th Infantry Regiment; the 150th Infantry was earmarked for West Virginia) and the 138th Field Artillery Regiment. The medical, quartermaster, and division special troops elements were divided among Indiana and Kentucky.

The designated mobilization training center for the “Cyclone Division” was Camp Knox, Kentucky, where much of the division’s training activities occurred between the wars. The 38th Division was fortunate in that it was one of the few multistate divisions that had the opportunity to train together each summer prior to World War II, and the entire division (except West Virginia’s 150th Infantry) conducted its summer camp most years at Camp Knox from 1923 to 1939. For the 1936 camp, the division participated in the Fifth Corps Area phase of the Second Army maneuvers at Fort Knox. During that maneuver, the 38th Division operated as part of the provisional V Corps against the 10th Infantry Brigade, 5th Division. Additionally, the division staff participated in the Fifth Corps Area command post exercise (CPX) in May 1929 and in the Second Army CPX in September 1938 at Fort Knox. In 1940, the entire “Cyclone” Division again participated in the Second Army maneuvers, this time near Camp McCoy, Wisconsin. In addition to summer training, the entire division, less the West Virginia elements, was called up for flood relief duty in January and February 1937 when the Ohio River overflowed in one of the worst floods in its history. The “Cyclone” Division was inducted into active federal service at home stations on 17 January 1941 and assigned to the V Corps. Instead of Fort Knox, however, it was ordered to move to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, where it arrived on 26 January 1941. After the division’s initial train-up period, it participated in the V Corps Maneuver 16–27 June 1941 near Camp Beauregard, Louisiana, and in the GHQ Maneuvers in August–September 1941 near Cooper, Louisiana.

===Combat chronicle===
The 38th Infantry Division arrived in Hawaii on 17 January 1944. It received further training and the duty of the defense of Oahu. The division embarked from Hawaii to New Guinea, where the combat elements conducted final combat rehearsals (made realistic by the presence of bypassed Japanese troops) from July to November 1944. Once rehearsals were complete, the 38th Infantry Division sailed for Leyte, landing in December 1944. Enemy paratroops attempted to capture the Buri, Bayug, and San Pablo airstrips on 6 December. The 149th Infantry Regiment destroyed organized resistance, 11 December, and defended the strips until relieved, 4 January 1945. The division landed in the San Narciso area in Southern Zambales Province, Luzon, 29 January 1945, without opposition. The San Marcelino airstrip was secured on the same day and the port facilities at Olongapo were captured on the 30th as well as Grande Island in Subic Bay after an amphibious landing. Driving west of Olongapo the 38th destroyed an intricate maze of enemy fortifications in Zig-Zag Pass. While elements landed at Mariveles on the southern tip of the peninsula, 15 February, other units pushed down the east coast road to Pilar and across the neck of land to Bagac along the route of the March of Death. The Bataan Peninsula was secured on 21 February, although mopping-up activities remained. The 38th Infantry Division&#x27;s rapid drive across the peninsula was critical to MacArthur&#x27;s campaign plan by preventing a Japanese withdrawal into Bataan - thereby avoiding a costly siege operation.

2nd Battation of the 151st Infantry, along with elements from the Cannon and anti-tank companies, moved to Corregidor, 24 February, to clear the remaining Japanese defenders from the Rock. The same battalion assaulted and captured Caballo Island, 27 March, and Fort Drum on El Fraile Island, 13 April. 1st Battalion 151st Infantry captured Carabao Island on 16 April. Supporting operations in March included a major push against dug-in Japanese defenders in the mountainous terrain between Fort Stotsenburg and Mount Pinatubo by the 38th Division Advance (consisting of the 149th Regimental Combat Team (RCT), the 169th RCT, and all the 38th Division&#x27;s artillery). Once the enemy was broken, combat elements of the 152nd Infantry pushed north from San Felipe to Palauig Bay and east from Botolan along the Capas Trail cutting the enemy&#x27;s withdrawal route.

The Division moved to the area east of Manila, 1 May, and attacked enemy forces behind the Shimbu Line. By 30 June effective enemy opposition had been broken, although the division remained engaged in active combat operations until 14 August 1945 when President Harry S. Truman announced Japan&#x27;s acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration and unconditional surrender. As of 14 August 1945, the 38th Infantry Division had completed an unbroken stretch of 198 consecutive days in combat, officially killing 26,469 enemy combatants, and taking 1411 Japanese prisoners. Although officially not &quot;engaged in major combat&quot; after 14 August, elements of the division continued to mop up Japanese stragglers in the Luzon area (who usually resisted to the death), until the signing of the VJ Day surrender documents on 2 September 1945. Even after VJ Day, the division&#x27;s combat outposts continued to net prisoners until the division was officially relieved on 5 October 1945. In the final tally, the 38th Infantry Division fought against more than 80,000 Japanese, killing 26,732 and ultimately taking more than 13,000 prisoners. For its swift clearing of the Bataan peninsula in 19 days of bloody combat, division commander Major General William C. Chase, ordered that the division would be known as the &quot;Avengers of Bataan&quot;, a tribute often attributed to General Douglas MacArthur.

==Post World War==
After the end of World War II, the 38th Infantry Division briefly remained in the Philippines pending a decision as to whether or not the division would remain on occupation duty. Instead, the division was alerted on 15 September 1945 that it was to return to the United States and demobilize. Major General Irving and key staffers flew from Manila, while the bulk of the division elements sailed from the Philippines beginning in October. The 38th Infantry Division was directed to Camp Anza, California, for final demobilization and inactivation, which was completed on 9 November 1945.

For a time, the 38th Infantry Division remained inactivated while debate raged within the federal government as to the size, scope and even the necessity for a separate Army National Guard. In October 1945, the War Department issued directives to reconstitute the Army National Guard as an integral part of the Reserve Component which still retained the unique dual nature of the pre-war Guard. First priority under the new plan was the organization and reactivation of eighteen division headquarters, one of which was the 38th Infantry Division.

Within Indiana, organizational actions were already in the works led by Indiana Adjutant General Ben H. Watt. By March 1946, Watt submitted a proposed recruitment quota to the National Guard Bureau (NGB), and designated commanders in anticipation of receiving approval for the reorganizing units. Receiving approval from NGB in October 1946, Indiana began organizing and reconstituting the subordinate elements of the 38th Infantry Division. Unit strength grew quickly, swelled by large numbers of World War II veterans. The influx of tested combat leaders facilitated the activation of the Headquarters and Special Troops unit of the 38th Infantry Division, which officially organized in Indianapolis on 6 October 1946, and received federal recognition on 5 March 1947.

Unlike the pre-war 38th Division, the post-war 38th Infantry Division force structure was allotted entirely to Indiana, and consisted of a triangular structure (three infantry regiments, with three line battalions per regiment) with a total authorization of 16,241 officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and soldiers. Despite an aggressive recruiting campaign, the Division&#x27;s subordinate units were not sufficiently organized to permit Annual Training (AT) at Camp Atterbury until 1948.

In 1959, the 38th Infantry Division underwent the first major reorganization since the War, with the regiments converted into Pentomic battle groups by the inclusion of fire support and logistics elements as organic parts of the combat formation. In 1968, the division was the first reserve organization to reorganize under the Army&#x27;s Reorganization Objective of the Army Division (ROAD) concept, which included three brigade headquarters tailored by the attachment of combat and support battalions. Accompanying the ROAD reorganization was the return to multi-state aspect of the pre-war division, with the division headquarters, divisional artillery, and the 76th Infantry Brigade stationed in Indiana, with the remaining two infantry brigades organized in Ohio and Michigan. In 1994, the division headquarters reorganized as a mechanized infantry division headquarters, a designation which it retained until 2008.

During the Cold War, the 38th Infantry Division formed part of the Strategic Reserve to support the Active Army in the event of a full-scale war with the Soviet Union and her satellites. In 1965, the Division was designated part of the Selected Reserve Force, higher priority Reserve Component units that received better equipment and greater funding in order to maintain higher levels of readiness.
In 1981, elements of the 38th Infantry Division took part in Exercise REFORGER (Return of Forces to Germany) as a way of testing the United States&#x27; ability to strategically deploy reserves into West Germany in response to a Warsaw Pact invasion. Other elements of the 38th Infantry Division, both company sized units as well as individual Soldiers, have participated in Overseas Deployment for Training missions in Germany, the United Kingdom, Republic of Korea, Japan, and in Central America.

With the exception of Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry, elements of the 38th Infantry Division were not activated for federal service in combat operations from 1945 until Operation Desert Storm in 1990. However, elements of the Division were frequently called up for State Active Duty to support civil authorities in mitigating the effects of natural disasters and civil unrest. Two of the largest callups were for the Perfect Circle strike of 1955 and the Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of April 1965.

Company D (Ranger), 151st Infantry was the sole divisional element (and one of a small number of National Guard units) mobilized for service in the Republic of Vietnam and was one of the most highly decorated units to serve in that conflict.

In 1996, over 7,000 soldiers from the 38th Infantry Division (from Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan) supported the Centennial Olympic Games in Atlanta, Georgia.

In 1996-1997, Echo Battery (Target Acquisition) 139th Field Artillery deployed to Bosnia as part of peacekeeping operations in the former Yugoslavia.

Also in 1998 the 76th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was selected to participate in a training deployment in the summer of 2000 to the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) at Fort Polk, LA. The 38th Division Support Command (DISCOM) supported the JRTC rotation by operating the logistics support area (LSA), while many units within the division provided equipment and manpower to support the 76th Brigade. The equipment deployment from Indiana to JRTC was via river barge, among the largest moves of equipment for Indiana units since World War II.

==Post 9/11==
===Mobilizations===
Since 11 September 2001, the 38th Infantry Division has provided headquarters and forces for a variety of operational rotations including Operation Iraqi Freedom (Iraq), Operation Enduring Freedom (Afghanistan and Cuba), Operation Joint Forge (Bosnia), Operation Joint Guardian (Kosovo), Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa (Djibouti), Multinational Force and Observers (Egypt), United States Air Forces Europe (USAFE) Force Protection (England, Germany, Italy, and Belgium), Operation Noble Eagle (Continental United States) Rotations I through IV, Operation Desert Watch and Operation Desert Spring (Kuwait), and Operation Spartan Shield.

===Hurricane Katrina relief efforts===
On 29 August 2005, Hurricane Katrina made final landfall in Mississippi, causing tremendous damage which quickly overwhelmed state agencies. The governor of Mississippi appealed to other states for National Guard units to assist in the response. The rapid influx of Guard units from various states, although sorely needed, overwhelmed the Mississippi National Guard&#x27;s ability to coordinate the military efforts. Accordingly, National Guard Bureau activated the headquarters of the 38th Infantry Division on 30 August to deploy to Mississippi and assist the Mississippi Adjutant General (TAG) with command and control efforts. Commanded by Major General (MG) Gregory Vadnais, the advanced party of the division deployed on 31 August 2005, while the main body departed Indianapolis by convoy on Saturday, 3 September 2005. Organized as Task Force (TF) Cyclone, the Division established command post operations in Gulfport Mississippi, focused on providing local security, road clearance, and delivery of essential humanitarian assistance. By the time TF Cyclone fully assumed mission on 4 September, roughly 7500 Guardsmen were on duty inside Mississippi. Final strength of TF Cyclone peaked at 15,500 on 7 September, with elements of the division engaged in missions until transfer of authority back to Mississippi began on 15 September 2005.

===Operation Enduring Freedom===
In 2009, the 38th Infantry Division headquarters was alerted to deploy a command and control element to Afghanistan to replace an outgoing maneuver enhancement brigade (MEB) 1-star headquarters conducting full-spectrum counterinsurgency operations (COIN) within Bamyan, Parwan, Panjshir and Kapisa provinces. In addition to the decisive COIN mission, the 38th Infantry Division would assume responsibility for operating the mayor cells at Bagram Airbase and five other forward operating bases (FOBs). After a period of pre-mobilization training, the divisional element (organized as Task Force Cyclone under the command of Brigadier General Joseph Lonnie Culver) deployed via Manis Airbase in Kyrgyzstan to Bagram airfield and completed Transfer of Authority (TOA) on 31 August 2009. TF Cyclone assumed control of a diverse task force in Regional Command East of 4100 US military members, including Army signal, civil affairs (CA), psychological operations (PSYOPS), Military Police (MP), Embedded Training Teams (ETT), Agribusiness Development Teams (ADT); Air Force Facility/Base Engineering and Security. The task force contained units from five coalition partners: France, Mongolia, United Arab Emirates (UAE), New Zealand (the Bamiyan PRT), Singapore, and Mongolia. Lastly, TF Cyclone had attached representatives from the US Department of State, Agriculture, and US Agency for International Development (USAID).

While engaged in COIN operations in the Bamyan, Parwan, Panjshir and Kapisa provinces, TF Cyclone worked closely with subordinate Provincial Reconstruction Teams, village elders, district and provincial governors to support reconstruction efforts. By the time TF Cyclone transitioned from the COIN mission, over $5 billion in reconstruction projects had taken place with minimal interference from insurgents.

In January 2010, TF Cyclone was alerted to a change of mission to establish an area support group (ASG) over the Kabul base cluster. On 1 April 2010, TF Cyclone conducted a transfer of authority (TOA) with Task Force Wolverine (86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team) and assumed control over seven bases in the Kabul area.

During the time period in control of the Kabul base cluster, TF Cyclone oversaw the construction of four new base camps, refurbishing of the seven existing camps, and the streamlining of logistics and contracting processes in Kabul. In June 2010, TF Cyclone conducted relief in place operations with the 196th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, and executed Transfer of Authority on 30 June 2010. After transiting Kyrgyzstan, TF Cyclone returned to Indianapolis, Indiana, on 02 July 2010. The unit proceeded to Camp Atterbury, Indiana and finished demobilization on the morning of 4 July 2010. Among some of TF Cyclone&#x27;s major accomplishments: conduct of more than 7000 combat patrols, including 107 enemy contacts and 73 tactical vehicle recoveries, oversight of more than $3 billion in new construction, support to the Afghan National Government in conducting national elections, the saving of more than 300 Afghan civilians following a major avalanche in Parwan province, the capturing or killing of numerous insurgents, and significant improvements in local and provincial governance. The Headquarters of the 38th Infantry Division was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) in recognition Task Force Cyclone&#x27;s accomplishments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.
Two teams from the 38th Infantry Division also mobilized in 2016–2017 in support of operations at Joint Task Force-Guantanamo Bay, Cuba as part of contingency operations of Operation Enduring Freedom.

===Al Anbar Province during Operation Iraqi Freedom===
From October 2006 to September 2007, a company from the 38th Infantry Division saw extensive combat in Ramadi and Fallujah, Iraq. This company and its parent battalion were administratively assigned to the 38th Infantry Division, but operationally assigned to the 76th Infantry Brigade (Separate) just prior to the mobilization and deployment of 2006–07. Originally known as Company A, 2nd Battalion (Mechanized), 152nd Infantry Regiment, the unit became an expeditionary force with members from all companies in the battalion, and was renamed Headquarters, and Headquarters Company (-), and would come to be known as &quot;Team Gator&quot;. Upon arrival in Al Anbar Province, the unit was operationally assigned to the 1st Brigade, 1st Armored Division&#x27;s &quot;Ready First Combat Team&quot; and conducted extensive joint patrols and enemy clearing operations in both the Ramadi and Fallujah AOs during some of the most intense fighting of the 2006–07 campaign. One platoon would be assigned under the tactical control of USMC Regimental Combat Teams in the Fallujah AO, with the rest of the company being assigned to the Ready First Brigade in Ramadi. The company would also have a platoon from the Minnesota National Guard under its operational control.

When the Ready First Brigade departed Ramadi, the company would be assigned to a new brigade, 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division (Raider Brigade), and it would participate in major clearing operations during the Surge of 2007.

The company had many soldiers who committed numerous acts of heroism that have not been truly known to this day. The unit is second only to Company D Rangers for being the most decorated and combat experienced company sized element in the Indiana Army National Guard since World War II.

===Operation Spartan Shield===
The 38th Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion (DHHB) mobilized over 600 Soldiers in May 2019 for rotational assignment in Operation Spartan Shield (OSS), to include a departure ceremony at the Indianapolis 500 race prior to mobilization. The 38th Infantry Division Headquarters replaced 34th Infantry Division Headquarters in July 2019, and was primarily based out of Kuwait, but also had a tactical command post (TAC) in Jordan as well as Eskan Village, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Soldiers of the 38th Infantry Division conducted multiple engagements and exercises with military partners in the Persian Gulf. As well, the Division deterred aggression in the Persian Gulf and in support of Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIR) in both Iraq and Syria. 38th Infantry Division headquarters was awarded a Meritorious Unit Commendation for this deployment. 

===59th Presidential Inauguration===

<text>The 37th Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War I and World War II. It was a National Guard division from Ohio, nicknamed the &quot;Buckeye Division&quot;. Today, its lineage is continued through the 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, with battalions from Ohio, Michigan, and South Carolina.

==World War I==


It was initially activated as the 16th Division, a National Guard formation from Ohio and West Virginia in 1913. It was federally activated in August 1917 as a National Guard Division from Ohio. It was sent overseas in June 1918 and fought at the Meuse-Argonne and at Ypres-Lys offensives

==Interwar period==

The 37th Division was reconstituted in the National Guard in 1921, allotted to the state of Ohio, and assigned to the V Corps. The 145th and 146th Infantry Regiments were consolidated and designated the 145th Infantry, while the 166th Infantry Regiment, which had been assigned to the 42nd Division in World War I, was assigned to the 37th Division. The 37th Division headquarters was federally recognized on 31 May 1923. The division trained most years at Camp Perry, Ohio, except for the 62nd Field Artillery Brigade, which often trained at Camp Knox (later Fort Knox), Kentucky, to utilize the artillery ranges located there. Newly-commissioned Organized Reserve lieutenants assigned to the Regular Army&#x27;s 60th and 61st Infantry Regiments, which were maintained in an inactive status in the Fifth Corps Area, also trained with the division at Camp Perry. The division staff usually trained at Camp Perry, but participated in the Fifth Corps Area command post exercise (CPX) in 1929 and the Second Army CPX in 1938. In 1936, the division participated in the Fifth Corps Area phase of the Second Army maneuvers at Fort Knox. The entire division was called up for flood relief duty during the Ohio River Flood of 1937. In 1940, the division participated in the Second Army maneuvers near Camp McCoy, Wisconsin. The 37th Division was inducted into federal service at home stations on 15 October 1940 and moved to Camp Shelby, Mississippi. After the division’s basic training, it participated in the V Corps maneuver in June 1941, and in the GHQ maneuvers in August–September 1941.

===Order of battle===
After the 37th Division was activated in October 1940, it was originally to be commanded by Major General Glenson D. Light. However, Light failed to pass the new physical tests enacted on the guardsmen. To fill the vacancy, Ohio Governor John W. Bricker selected Robert S. Beightler, who he had known from his time as the chief engineer in Ohio&#x27;s highway department. 

The 112th Engineer Combat Battalion had been sent to Ireland in May 1942 as part of an advance party in anticipation of the 37th Infantry Division&#x27;s deployment to Europe, but the division&#x27;s orders were shortly changed to deployment to the Pacific Theater. The 29th Infantry Division&#x27;s 121st Engineer Combat Battalion, less five officers and 120 men that remained with the division to form the nucleus of a new battalion, was assigned to the 37th Infantry Division as the new 117th Engineer Combat Battalion.

===Combat chronicle===
The 37th Infantry Division arrived in Fiji in June 1942 to fortify the islands against possible invasion. The division continued its training on the islands. With the end of ground fighting on Guadalcanal, the division moved to that island in April 1943, continued training, and staged for the Munda campaign. Two battalions joined the Marine Raiders on New Georgia, 5 July 1943, while the remainder of the division landed, 22 July, and assisted the 43d Infantry Division in taking Munda airfield in heavy fighting. After mopping up on New Georgia, the division returned to Guadalcanal, 9 September 1943, for rest and rehabilitation.

The division&#x27;s next assignment was Bougainville as part of the I Marine Amphibious Corps. Landing between 8 and 19 November 1943, the 37th Division expanded the western beachhead sector, constructed roads and bridges, and engaged in extensive patrol activity. On 15 December 1943, IMAC was relieved by the XIV Corps, to which the 37th Division was then assigned. In March 1944, two Japanese divisions made eight major attacks, but division lines held. In April patrols cleared the Laruma Valley area of major enemy units. The division remained on Bougainville and trained for the Luzon campaign.

Landing with the Sixth Army on the beaches of Lingayen Gulf, 9 January 1945, the 37th raced inland against slight resistance to Clark Field and Fort Stotsenburg where fierce resistance delayed capture of those objectives until 31 January. The division continued to drive to Manila against small delaying forces, and entered the city&#x27;s outskirts, 4 February. Upon crossing the Pasig River, it ran into bitter Japanese opposition. By heavy street fighting, American and Filipino troops cleared the city by 3 March 1945. The Luzon campaign would prove the most costly for the division during the war, which earned them the nickname &quot;Heavyweight&quot;.

After garrison duty in Manila, 5–26 March, the division shifted to the hills of Northwest Luzon, where heavy fighting culminated in the capture of Baguio, 26 April with aided Filipino troops under the 66th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL. Rest and rehabilitation during May were followed by action in June in the Cagayan Valley against deteriorating Japanese resistance. With the end of hostilities, 15 August, the division was concerned with the collection and processing of prisoners of war, leaving November 1945 for the States and demobilization.

Major General Robert Beightler was one of only eleven generals who commanded their divisions for the entire war, and was the only National Guard general to do so.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 5,960
*Killed in action: 1,094
*Wounded in action: 4,861
*Missing in action: 4
*Prisoner of war: 1
*Days of combat: 592

==After 1945==
The division was reorganized in the Ohio Army National Guard in 1946. It served under federal control from 1952 to 1954 at Camp Polk, Louisiana. Although the division was not sent to Korea, nearly every soldier was as an individual replacement. The 37th went through a number of reorganizations from 1959 until it was disbanded on 15 February 1968.

The bulk of the division&#x27;s combat units became the 73rd Infantry Brigade, 38th Infantry Division with the remaining becoming the 16th Engineer Brigade and other combat support units. In 1977, the 73rd Brigade was released from assignment to the 38th ID and was redesignated the 73rd Infantry Brigade, a separate brigade. During the draw down of forces after the Cold War, units of the 73rd and the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment consolidated to form the 37th Brigade, 28th Infantry Division. A year later, the brigade was reunited with the 38th Infantry Division.

On 1 September 2007, 37th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT) was activated under the Army&#x27;s modular plan. The shoulder sleeve insignia of the 37th IBCT is heavily based on that of the 37th Infantry Division and many units that are part of the 37th IBCT, served in the 37th Infantry Division.

<text>The 34th Infantry Division is an infantry division of the United States Army, part of the National Guard, that participated in World War I, World War II and multiple current conflicts. It was the first American division deployed to Europe in World War II, where it fought with great distinction in the Italian Campaign.

The division was deactivated in 1945, and the 47th &quot;Viking&quot; Infantry Division was later created in the division&#x27;s former area. In 1991 the 47th Division was redesignated the 34th. Since 2001, division soldiers have served on homeland security duties in the continental United States, in Afghanistan, and in Iraq. The 34th has also been deployed to support peacekeeping efforts in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.

The division continues to serve today, with most of the division part of the Minnesota and Iowa National Guard. In 2011, it was staffed by roughly 6,500 soldiers from the Minnesota National Guard, 2,900 from the Iowa National Guard, about 300 from the Nebraska National Guard, and about 100 from other states.

==World War I==
The division was established as the 34th Division of the National Guard on 18 July 1917, consisting of units from Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Camp Cody, New Mexico, was selected as its training site on 3 August. On 5 August, the National Guards of Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and the Dakotas were drafted into federal service, and the units to comprise the division began concentrating at Camp Cody on 19 August. On 25 August 1917, the division was placed under the command of Major General Augustus P. Blocksom, who was succeeded by Brigadier General Frank G. Mauldin briefly on 18 September 1917, but was back in command by 10 December 1917.

A controversy arose when Brigadier General Frederick Emil Resche, the commander of the division&#x27;s 68th Infantry Brigade and a native of Germany who had long resided in Duluth, Minnesota, was accused of anti-American sentiments. No evidence was forthcoming, but Resche was still relieved of command in April 1918, supposedly for inefficiency.

Brigadier General Frank G. Mauldin took command. Systematic training began on 29 October 1917, and during October and November, 5,000 draftees arrived from Camp Dodge, Iowa, and Camp Funston, Kansas, while personnel losses up to and including 10 May 1918 aggregated about 4,000 men. In June 1918, nearly all of the division&#x27;s trained personnel were sent overseas to meet the requirements of the AEF automatic replacement system. Replacements arrived in August, the majority drawn from Arizona, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. The 34th Division arrived in France in October 1918, but it was too late for the division to be sent to the front, as the end of hostilities was near. Most personnel were sent through the AEF replacement system to other units to support their final operations. The Armistice with Germany was signed the following month.

Brigadier General John Alexander Johnston took command 26 October 1918. Charles Dudley Rhodes took command in December and led the division until its departure for the United States in January 1919. The 34th was disbanded on 18 February 1919 at Camp Grant, Illinois.

The division takes its name from the shoulder sleeve insignia designed for a 1917 training camp contest by American regionalist artist Marvin Cone, who was then a soldier enlisted in the unit. Cone&#x27;s design evoked the desert training grounds of Camp Cody by superimposing a red steer skull over a black Mexican water jug called an &quot;olla,&quot; while the unit was called the &quot;Sandstorm Division.&quot; German troops in World War II called the 34th Infantry Division&#x27;s soldiers &quot;Red Devils&quot; and &quot;Red Bulls,&quot; and the division later officially adopted the divisional nickname Red Bulls.

== Between the world wars ==

In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to Iowa, Minnesota, South Dakota, and North Dakota, and assigned to the VII Corps in 1921. On 17 January 1921, the Observation Squadron, Minnesota National Guard, was the first National Guard observation squadron to receive federal recognition. Per War Department naming conventions, the squadron was re-designated the 109th Observation Squadron on 25 January 1923. By 1924, a sufficient number of subordinate units had been organized to meet the federal standards for organization of a division headquarters and staff, and the division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 14 July 1924 at Council Bluffs, Iowa, under the command of Major General Mathew A. Tinley; when Major General George E. Leach of Minnesota took command, the headquarters was relocated on 14 July 1940 to Camp Ripley, near Little Falls, Minnesota. The designated mobilization training center for the “Red Bull” Division was Camp Dodge, Iowa, near Des Moines, 1921–30, and Camp Ripley, 1931–40. For most years from 1921 to 1940, the division&#x27;s subordinate units held separate summer camps at locations within their respective states: Camp Dodge for Iowa units; Camp Lake View on Lake Pepin near Lake City, until 1931, and from 1931 on, Camp Ripley for Minnesota units; Camp Gilbert C. Grafton near Devils Lake for North Dakota units; and Camp Rapid near Rapid City for South Dakota units. For at least one year, in 1938, the division&#x27;s subordinate units also trained over eighty company-grade Reserve officers of the 88th Division at their various training camps in the division&#x27;s home area. The division staff, composed of personnel form all four states, came together to conduct joint training for several summers before World War II. The staff generally alternated years between Fort Snelling, Minnesota, and Camp Dodge and participated in several corps area and army-level command post exercises.

On 16 May 1934, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters initiated a strike (Minneapolis Teamsters Strike of 1934), which quickly degenerated into open violence in the streets of Minneapolis. Minnesota governor Floyd B. Olson activated 4,000 National Guardsmen to suppress the chaos. Utilizing roving patrols, curfews, and security details, the 34th quickly restored order, thus enabling a negotiated settlement of the labor dispute. The first opportunity for the entire division to operate together came in August 1937 during that portion of the Fourth Army maneuvers held at Camp Ripley. On 18 June 1939, a tornado hit Anoka, Minnesota, and Governor Harold Stassen called on the Guard again. 300 Guardsmen patrolled the streets and imposed quasi-martial law while the community was stabilized. The next opportunity for the division to operate as a unit came in August 1940 when the division again assembled at Camp Ripley for the Seventh Corps Area concentration of the Fourth Army maneuvers. In that maneuver, the “Red Bull” Division operated as part of the &quot;Red Army&quot; against the 35th Division and the &quot;Blue Army.&quot;

===Commanders===

* Major General Mathew A. Tinley (Iowa) (14 July 1924 – 5 March 1940)
* Major General Lloyd D. Ross (Iowa) (5 March-24 June 1940)
* Major General George E. Leach (Minnesota) (24 June–24 July 1940)
* Major General Ellard A. Walsh (Minnesota) (25 July 1940 – 16 August 1941)

===Order of battle, 1939===
In 1929, the 185th Field Artillery Regiment was reassigned from the VII Corps Artillery to the 34th Division when the Army returned 155 mm howitzer regiments to infantry divisions. The 109th Ammunition Train was never authorized for organization, and was disbanded in an inactive status on 1 July 1940.

The 109th Medical Regiment was originally allotted to Minnesota and North Dakota. In 1927, the regiment was relieved from assignment to the 34th Division, assigned to the VII Corps, and the North Dakota elements were concurrently withdrawn and allotted to Minnesota. No units of the regiment were ever organized before it was withdrawn from allotment to the National Guard in September 1927 and demobilized. Concurrently, the 136th Medical Regiment, allotted to Iowa and South Dakota, was reassigned from the VII Corps to the 34th Division with all South Dakota elements withdrawn and allotted to Iowa. The regiment, less two companies active since 1922 and 1926, respectively, began organization in April 1939.

== Prelude to World War II ==
The expanding war in Europe threatened to draw a reluctant United States into the conflict. As the potential of U.S. involvement in World War II became more evident, initial steps were taken to prepare troops for what lay ahead through &quot;precautionary training.&quot; The division was deemed one of the most service-ready units, and Ellard A. Walsh was promoted to major general in June 1940, and then succeeded to division commander in August. The Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 was signed into law 16 September, and the first conscription in U.S. history during peacetime commenced.

The 34th was subsequently federalized on 10 February 1941, and was transported by rail and truck convoys to the newly constructed Camp Claiborne in Rapides Parish, Louisiana near Alexandria. On 7 April 1941, the soldiers started rigorous training. The climate during the summer was especially harsh. The division then participated in what became known as the Louisiana Maneuvers, and became a well-disciplined, high-spirited, and well-prepared unit. During the early phase of the maneuvers, General Walsh became too ill to continue in command because of chronic stomach ulcers. After an interim tenure by Iowan Brigadier General Gordon C. Hollar of the 67th Infantry Brigade, the senior brigadier general of the division, Walsh was replaced by Regular Army Major General Russell P. Hartle on 5 August 1941.

In common with other U.S. Army divisions during World War II the 34th was reorganized from a square to a triangular division before seeing combat. The division&#x27;s three infantry regiments became the 133rd, 135th, and 168th Infantry Regiments, together with supporting units.

===Combat chronicle===
On 8 January 1942, the 34th Division was transported by train to Fort Dix, New Jersey to quickly prepare for overseas movement. The first contingent embarked at Brooklyn on 14 January 1942 and sailed from New York the next day. The initial group of 4,508 men stepped ashore at 12:15 hrs on 26 January 1942 at Dufferin Quay, Belfast, Northern Ireland. They were met by a delegation including the Governor (Duke of Abercorn), the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland (J. M. Andrews), the Commander of British Troops Northern Ireland (Lieutenant General Sir Harold Franklyn), and the Secretary of State for Air (Sir Archibald Sinclair). Private First Class Milburn H. Henke, Company B, 133rd Infantry Regiment, of Hutchinson, Minnesota, was honorarily selected as the &quot;first&quot; American soldier to set foot in the United Kingdom during the Second World War. The remainder of the division embarked for Northern Ireland in late April 1942, arriving in early May.

While in Northern Ireland, Hartle was tasked with organizing an American version of the British Commandos, a group of small &quot;hit and run&quot; forces, and promoted his aide-de-camp, Captain William Orlando Darby to lead the new unit. Darby assembled volunteers, and of the first 500 U.S. Army Rangers, 281 came from the 34th Infantry Division. On 20 May 1942, Hartle was designated commanding general of V Corps and Major General Charles Ryder, a distinguished veteran of World War I, took command of the 34th Division. In September 1942, the 2nd Battalion, 133rd Infantry, was attached to Allied Force Headquarters for guard and police duties, later traveling to North Africa with the headquarters. The division boarded ships to travel to North Africa for Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, in November 1942.

The 34th, under command of Major General Ryder, saw its first combat in French Algeria on 8 November 1942. As a member of the Eastern Task Force, which included two brigades of the British 78th Infantry Division, and two British Commando units, they landed at Algiers and seized the port and outlying airfields. Elements of the 34th Division took part in numerous subsequent engagements in Tunisia during the Allied build-up, notably at Sened Station, Sidi Bou Zid and Faid Pass, Sbeitla, and Fondouk Gap. In April 1943 the division assaulted Hill 609, capturing it on 1 May 1943, and then drove through Chouigui Pass to Tebourba and Ferryville. The Battle of Tunisia was won, and the Axis forces surrendered.

The division skipped the Allied invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky) due to heavy casualties suffered in North Africa especially at Faid Pass where the 168th Infantry Regiment lost half of its strength with its men killed or captured and was in need of replacements and refitting, and instead trained intensively for the invasion of the Italian mainland, with the main landings being at Salerno (Operation Avalanche) on 9 September 1943, D-Day, to be undertaken by elements of the U.S. Fifth Army, commanded by Lieutenant General Mark Clark. The 151st Field Artillery Battalion went in on D-Day, 9 September, landing at Salerno, while the rest of the division followed on 25 September.

The segregated Japanese-American 100th Infantry Battalion was attached to the 133rd Infantry at the end of the North African campaign to replace the 2nd Battalion, later traveling with them to Italy.

Engaging the enemy at the Calore River, 28 September, the 34th, as part of the VI Corps under Major General John Lucas, relentlessly drove north to take Benevento, crossed the winding Volturno three times in October and November, assaulted Monte Patano, and took one of its four peaks before being relieved on 8 December.

In January 1944, the division was back on the front line battering the Bernhardt Line defenses. Persevering through bitter fighting along the Mignano Gap, the 34th used goat herds to clear the minefields. The 34th took Monte Trocchio without resistance as the German defenders withdrew to the main prepared defenses of the Gustav Line. On 24 January 1944, during the First Battle of Monte Cassino they pushed across the Gari River into the hills behind and attacked Monastery Hill which dominated the town of Monte Cassino. While they nearly captured the objective, in the end their attacks on the monastery and the town failed. The performance of the 34th Infantry Division in the mountains has been called one of the finest feats of arms carried out by any soldiers during the war. The unit sustained severe losses. In the 133rd Infantry, the attached 100th Battalion, had only 7 officers and 78 men remaining in its rifle companies. In the 135th Infantry, there was an average of only 30 men in each rifle company. In the 168th Infantry, the 1st Battalion had only 154 combat effective men, the 2nd Battalion had 393, and the 3rd Battalion had 246. They were relieved from their positions 11–13 February 1944. Eventually, it took the combined force of five Allied infantry divisions to finish what the 34th nearly accomplished on its own.

After rest and rehabilitation, during which the 133rd Infantry&#x27;s 2nd Battalion rejoined its parent regiment, the 34th Division landed at the Anzio beachhead 25 March 1944. The division maintained defensive positions until the offensive of 23 May, when it broke out of the beachhead, took Cisterna, and raced to Civitavecchia and the Italian capital of Rome. After a short rest, the division, now commanded by Major General Charles Bolte, drove across the Cecina River to liberate Livorno, 19 July 1944, and continued on to take Monte Belmonte in October during the fighting on the Gothic Line. Digging in south of Bologna for the winter, the 34th manned the line opposite the German 65th Infantry Division. The Red Bull Division jumped off as part of the Spring 1945 offensive in Italy, 15 April 1945, and captured Bologna on 21 April after hard fighting against the 65th. Pursuit of the routed enemy to the French border was halted on 2 May upon the German surrender in Italy and the end of World War II in Europe.

On 27 June 1944 the 16th SS-Panzer Grenadiers command post in San Vincenzo, Italy was overrun by the 1st Battalion of the 133rd Infantry Regiment. The command post was a town center apartment which had been commandeered, when the owners returned to their apartment they found a signed large leather-bound Stieler&#x27;s Hand Atlas which had been left behind.

The division participated in six major Army campaigns in North Africa and Italy. The division is credited with amassing 517 days of front-line combat, second only to the 654 days of fighting by the 32nd Infantry Division. One or more 34th Division units were engaged in actual combat for 611 days.

The 34th Division was disbanded again in 1963, being replaced in part by the Nebraska-based 67th Separate Infantry Brigade. However, the former division headquarters was retained as a &quot;command headquarters&quot; to supervise training of combat and support units in the former division area. On 1 January 1968, the 34th Command Headquarters (Divisional) was reorganized as the 34th Infantry Brigade, 47th Infantry Division.

===Commanders===
*Major General Ray C. Fountain (19 Nov 1946 – 31 Aug 1954)
*Major General Warren C. Wood (1 Sept 1954 – 30 Nov 1962)
*Major General Frank P. Williams (1 Dec 1962 – 31 Dec 1967) (34th Command Headquarters)

==Second activation==

The 34th Infantry Division was reactivated on 10 February 1991 (the fiftieth anniversary of its federal activation for World War II) as a National Guard division for Minnesota and Iowa by, in effect, redesignating the 47th Infantry Division as the 34th Infantry Division, a process known as &quot;reflagging.&quot; However, for historical purposes, the Department of the Army&#x27;s Center of Military History does not recognize any lineal continuity between the headquarters of the 47th Infantry Division and the second activation of the headquarters of the 34th Infantry Division. Instead, the lineage of the 34th Infantry Division&#x27;s headquarters is perpetuated by the headquarters of the 34th Infantry Brigade. At that point, the division transitioned into a medium division, with a required strength of 18,062 soldiers.

==Twenty-first century==

Shortly after its rebirth in 1991, the division began a process of reorganization and change that has continued to the present. One of the most significant developments was transformation from its old brigade structure into brigade combat teams and the broadening of its base into eight different states. In Minnesota, the 34th ID includes the 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team, 34th Combat Aviation Brigade, 84th Troop Command and the 347th Regional Support Group. The 34th Infantry Division is capable of deploying its Main Command Post, Tactical Command Post, and Division Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion to provide command and control for Army brigades.

In 2000, the Minnesota Legislature renamed all of Interstate 35 in Minnesota the &quot;34th Division (Red Bull) Highway,&quot; in honor of the division and its service in the World Wars.

Outside Minnesota, the 34th Infantry Division provides training and operational guidance to the 1–112th Security &amp; Support Battalion, ND National Guard; 1–183rd Aviation Battalion, Idaho National Guard; 1–189th Aviation Battalion, Mont. National Guard; 115th Fires Brigade, Wyo. National Guard; 116th Heavy Brigade Combat Team, Idaho National Guard; 141st Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, ND National Guard; 157th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, Wis. National Guard; 196th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, SD National Guard; 2nd Brigade Combat Team, Iowa National Guard; and the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team, Wis. National Guard. Combined, the division represents 23,000 Citizen-Soldiers in units stationed across eight different states.

Since October 2001, division personnel served in Operation Joint Forge in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Operation Joint Guardian in Kosovo. Other deployments during the same time period have included Operation Vigilant Hammer in Europe, the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, and Egypt, and Joint Task Force Bravo – Honduras.

The 34th Infantry Division has deployed approximately 11,000 soldiers on operations since October 2001. At home this has included troops deployed for Operation Noble Eagle; abroad, units and individual soldiers have deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.

===Afghanistan===
*2004 In May 2004, the 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry Regiment (augmented by Company D, 2nd Battalion, 135th Infantry Regiment), 2nd Brigade, 34th Infantry Division, and with nearly 100 key positions filled by members of the 1st Battalion (Ironman), 133rd Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade, 34th Infantry Division, commenced combat operations at 13 Provincial Reconstruction Team sites throughout Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom, returning the 34th Infantry Division to combat after 59 years and becoming first unit in the division to wear the Red Bull patch as a right-shoulder combat patch since World War II. The 2011 book &quot;Words in the Dust&quot; by former 34th ID soldier Trent Reedy is a novel based on the experiences of the 34th ID soldiers assigned to the Farah, Afghanistan PRT.
*2010 In August 2010, nearly 3,000 Iowa National Guard soldiers, with 28 hometown send-offs, left for a year-long deployment to Afghanistan, making it the largest deployment of the Iowa National Guard since World War II. Augmented by the 1–134th Cavalry Reconnaissance and Surveillance Squadron of the Nebraska National Guard, the brigade conducted pre-mobilization training in Mississippi and California. The troops partnered with Afghan security forces to provide security and assist in training.

===Iraq===

*2003–2005 In November 2003, 34th ID&#x27;s own D 216 ADA from Monticello, MN was activated for deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. From November 2003 through March 2004, the battery trained under the 81st Enhanced Separate Brigade (Armored) in preparation for the deployment at Ft. Lewis, Yakima Training Center, and Ft. Irwin/National Training Center (NTC). While training at NTC, D 216 ADA was reassigned to the 1st CAV, 2nd BCT, 4/5 ADA. In March 2004, the unit moved to Camp New York in Kuwait, then convoyed northward to Baghdad in early April 2004. From April 2004 through March 2005, the Battery performed a wide range of missions to quell a growing insurgency and secure areas of Baghdad ahead of Iraq&#x27;s first elections. These missions included securing neighborhoods adjacent to Route Irish, maintaining a QRF force for Route Irish, conduct combat operations across a 100 km2 area in the vicinity of Al Radwaniyah Presidential Complex (RPC), and gate/perimeter security across several locations on the perimeter of Victory Base Complex (VBC). In recognition of D 216 ADA&#x27;s exemplary service, the unit was awarded the Valorous Unit Award.

*2004–2006 In November and December 2004, two platoons of the 634th Military Intelligence Battalion of the 34th Infantry Division activated to train and deploy as AAI RQ-7 Shadow Unmanned Aerial Vehicle operators. The two platoons provided near real time video reconnaissance supporting units from various locations in northern Iraq from the Iran to the Syrian borders. The First platoon received an award for being one of the best shadow units in the army for their safe flight record and mission effectiveness. The units were activated for over 20 months spending only 12 in Iraq.
*2005 In January 2005, Company A, 1st Battalion, 194th Armor Regiment (1/194 AR) arrived at Camp Ashraf (about 80 km north of Baghdad) to conduct security and convoy operations in the surrounding area and conducted joint operations with Iraqi Army ahead of the October 2005 Iraqi constitution ratification vote. The 151-man unit was formed from nearly all of the soldiers in the 1/194th and Company A was chosen to honor the unit&#x27;s lineage of the soldiers who fought to defend the Philippines against the Japanese and the Bataan Death March that followed. The unit was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for its exceptional service.
*2006 In March 2006, 1st Brigade, 34th Infantry Division commenced combat operations in central and southern Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom, marking the largest single unit deployment for the 34th since World War II. Returning in July 2007, 1st Brigade served one of the longest consecutive combat operations by a United States National Guard unit (activated for 22 months total with 16 in Iraq). In an effort to recreate the Living Red Bull Patch from Camp Cody, NM, in 1918, the 1st Brigade made its own Living Patch on the parade field at Camp Shelby, MS prior to its deployment to Iraq for OIF 06–08. Twenty soldiers of the Brigade were KIA while on this deployment. 
*2008–2009 More than 700 34th Combat Aviation Brigade soldiers deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan.
*2009–2010 The 34th Red Bull Infantry Division deployed more than 1,200 soldiers to Basra, Iraq where they provided command and control for 16,000 U.S. military members and oversaw operations in nine of Iraq&#x27;s 18 provinces. The highest-ranking suicide in Iraq occurred during this time. It was a Major and an officer of the 34ID. On 16 July 2009, three members of the Fighting Red Bulls were killed in Basra, Iraq.
*2010 The Saint Cloud-based B, 2nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 211th Aviation Regiment, departed in November for a deployment in support of Operation New Dawn. Flying CH-47 Chinook cargo helicopters, the Company B mission is to provide aerial movement of troops, equipment and supplies for support of maneuver, combat and combat service support operations.
*2011 In June 2011, 1st Brigade deployed to Kuwait, supplying troops for Operation New Dawn. The brigade was augmented with 1–180th Cavalry and 1–160th Field Artillery from the Oklahoma National Guard as well as the 112th Military Police Battalion from the Mississippi National Guard.
*2013 Personnel from the 34th Infantry Division participated in the exercise Talisman Saber to collectively train within the U.S. Pacific Command Theater of Operations. Division Headquarters personnel focused on offensive and defensive operations while fostering relationships with I Corps, U.S. Army Pacific and the Australian Defence Forces.

=== United States ===

* 2019 In May, the 34th Combat Aviation Brigade provided CH-47 and UH-60 helicopters and personnel to local government agencies to fight and contain three wildfires in northwest Minnesota. 
* 2019 In June, the 34th DIV participated in a full-spectrum Warfighter Exercise with the 40th Infantry Division at Fort Leavenworth. During this exercise, the brigade staff was able to successfully integrate with different levels of command and adjacent units.

=== Kuwait ===
* 2013 The 34th Combat Aviation Brigade welcomed home the St. Cloud-based Company C, 2nd General Support Aviation Battalion, 211th Aviation Regiment from a deployment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom where they conducted more than 650 medical evacuation missions and flew 1,700 accident-free flight hours. The company also received six new CH-47F Chinook helicopters and trained more than 30 personnel in their operation.

==Popular culture==
in the 1965 film version of James Clavell&#x27;s 1962 novel King Rat, George Segal&#x27;s character, U.S. Army Corporal King, wears the shoulder patch of the 34th Infantry Division. This is inaccurate, due to the Division having seen action in North Africa and Italy, not the Southwest Pacific or China-Burma-India Theater.

<doc id="930601" wikidata="Q5282137" url="?curid=930601" title="Diseases of the foot">
<text>Diseases of the foot generally are not limited, that is they are related to or manifest elsewhere in the body. However, the foot is often the first place some of these diseases or a sign or symptom of others appear. This is because of the foot&#x27;s distance from the central circulation, the heart and its constant exposure to pressures from the ground and the weight of the body.

The foot may is a complex structure with 26 bones, 33 joints, numerous muscles, nerves and different ligament types. Any part of the foot can be affected by diseases, with symptoms ranging from mild aches to more serious pain hindering one&#x27;s ability to walk or bear weight. Most minor cases of foot pain can be responded to by home care treatments. However, when severe pain is present, medical attention is required as it is a disabling condition. If foot pain is not treated in time, it can lead to long-term disability and continuing damage to the foot.

== Causes ==
The most common cause of foot pain is wearing ill fitting shoes. Women often wear tight shoes that are narrow and constrictive, and thus are most prone to foot problems. Tight shoes often cause overcrowding of toes and result in a variety of structural defects. The next most common cause of foot disease is overuse or traumatic injuries.

== Diagnosis ==
Besides a physical examination, an x-ray MRI or an ultrasound study may be obtained to assess the soft tissues and blood vessels. Standardized questionnaires and scoring systems, like the American Orthopaedic Foot &amp; Ankle Society (AOFAS) foot and ankle questionnaires, can help elicit the history and physical exam necessary to make and accurate diagnosis of foot and ankle conditions.

==Skin and nails==

Often there is a distinction made between conditions of the dorsal skin and plantar skin. Common examples include callus thickened skin, fungal infections of the skin (athlete&#x27;s foot) or nails (onychomycosis), viral infection of verrucae, and ingrowing toenails that may cause bacterial nail infections (paronychia).

Corns and calluses are chunky tough layers of skin that develop on the foot to protect underlying skin from pressure and friction. Corns and calluses are very common and do not look pleasant. Corns and calluses generally need treatment only if they cause problems. For most people, the best treatment of corns and calluses is to eliminate the source of friction or pressure.

Ingrown toe nail is a disorder where the nail starts to grow into the soft fleshy area of the toe. It causes intense redness, pain and swelling. Ingrown toe nails often affect the big toe. The best treatment for ingrown toe nails is to get the nail partially or completely removed.

==Arthritic foot conditions==
Arthritic foot conditions often present differently from arthritis other areas of the body. Achilles tendinitis results from stress on calf muscles and Achilles tendon. This strong tendon often gets inflamed while playing sports like basketball. The tendon gets irritated and does cause moderate pain . When treated promptly, the tendinitis is relieved. Sometimes, the Achilles tendon can rupture if it is overstretched. When the Achilles tendon ruptures, one may feel a sudden pop followed by sharp pain. Rupture of the Achilles tendon makes it impossible to walk.

Bunion is an abnormal bony mass that forms on the big toe and points outwards. This deformity is unsightly and painful. When the big toe enlarges at the base, it can force the other toes to crowd against each other. Over time, the big toe pushes outwards and alters the normal outline of the foot. Bunions occur for many reasons but the most common is not wearing proper shoes, arthritis and different inherited structural defects.

Flat feet (Pes planus foot) essentially means that the arch inside the foot is flat. This very common painless disorder may occur at birth or after pregnancy. Flat feet generally do not cause problems but may sometimes cause the foot to rotate inwards (pronation). There are orthotic shoe insoles (foot orthotics) that help correct flat feet. Surgery does not correct flat feet and should be avoided.

Hammer toes are unsightly and reveal a toe that is curled due to a bend in the middle joint of the toe. A hammer toe occur chiefly because the shoe is too tight at the front or the heels are too high. In such situations, the toe is strained against the front of the shoe and results in an abnormal twist. Relieving pain, pressure, changing shoe wear or wearing a type of shoe insert is adequate for most people.

Gout often presents with pain and tenderness at the base of the big toe. Generally women are more prone to gout after menopause. An acute attack of gout is intensely painful and walking on the foot is impossible. Gout is essentially a disorder caused by precipitation of uric acid crystals in the joint.

Plantar fasciitis is a very common cause of heel pain. The thick fibrous bands at the bottom of the heel get inflamed and cause excruciating pain. The pain occurs the moment you step out of bed. After a few hours, the pain does subside but can return after prolonged periods of standing. Plantar fasciitis is most common in runners, obese individuals, women who are pregnant and those who wear shoes with inadequate heel support. The treatment of this agonizing disorder involves pain control, steroid injections, proper foot wear and rest.

==Pain relief==
In some cases, foot diseases and painful conditions can be treated. Synovium hydrates the cartilage in the heel and can bring pain relief quickly. Synovium gel looks as well as strongly smells like urine, straying some consumers away. However this only occurs after expiration. Blood thinners can also work however are deemed as bad relievers by medical practitioners due to the fact that they can contribute to headaches and in some cases increase foot pain afterwards.

==Vascular disorders==
Atherosclerotic restriction to the arterial supply in peripheral artery occlusive disease may result in painful arterial ulcers of the ankle and foot, or give rise of gangrene of the toes and foot. Immobility of a person may result in prolonged pressure applied to the heels causing pressure sores.

Impaired venous drainage from the foot in varicose veins may sequentially result in brown haemosiderin discolouration to the ankle and foot, varicose stasis dermatitis and finally venous ulcers.

Other disorders of the foot include osteoarthritis of the joints, peripheral neuropathy and plantar warts.

<doc id="930608" wikidata="Q659499" url="?curid=930608" title="Court of Arbitration for Sport">
<text>The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS; , TAS) is an international body established in 1984 to settle disputes related to sport through arbitration. Its headquarters are in Lausanne, Switzerland and its courts are located in New York City, Sydney, and Lausanne. Temporary courts are established in current Olympic host cities.

The International Council of Arbitration for Sport (ICAS) was established simultaneously, and a single president presides over both bodies. The ICAS, which has a membership of 20 individuals, is responsible for the financing of and financial reporting by the CAS, and it appoints the Director-General of the CAS.

==Jurisdiction and appeals==
Generally speaking, a dispute may be submitted to the CAS only if an arbitration agreement between the parties specifies recourse to the CAS. However, according to rule 61 of the Olympic Charter, all disputes in connection with the Olympic Games can only be submitted to CAS, and all Olympic international federations (IF) have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for at least some disputes.

Through compliance with the 2009 World Anti-Doping Code, all signatories, including all Olympic international federations and National Olympic Committees, have recognised the jurisdiction of CAS for anti-doping rule violations. Starting in 2016, an anti-doping division of CAS judges, who specialize in doping cases at the Olympic Games, replaced the IOC disciplinary commission. These decisions can be appealed to CAS&#x27;s ad hoc court in the Olympic host city or, if the ad hoc court is no longer available, to the permanent CAS. The inaugural anti-doping division handled eight cases, of which seven were doping cases within its jurisdiction.

As a Swiss arbitration organization, decisions of the CAS can be appealed to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland. Appeals of arbitration decisions are generally not successful, and no evaluation of the merits takes place, with the evaluation mainly based on whether procedural requirements have been met, and whether the award is incompatible with public policy. there have been seven successful appeals. Six of the upheld appeals were procedural in nature. Overruling a CAS decision on the case&#x27;s merits is extremely rare. It occurred in 2012 for the first time in more than 20 years when the Federal Supreme Court overturned the case of Matuzalém, a Brazilian football player accused of breach of contract. In 2020, the Supreme Court overturned the case of Sun Yang, a Chinese swimmer accused of doping. CAS decisions can be the subject of further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR). For example, the ECHR found CAS and the Federal Supreme Court discriminated against and violated the privacy of runner Caster Semenya.

German speed skater Claudia Pechstein, who was unsuccessful in lifting a doping-related suspension in her CAS case, appealed to the Federal Court of Justice of Germany, which however ruled against her, recognising a lack of jurisdiction to revisit her case. The Federal Court ruled that CAS met the requirements of a court of arbitration according to German law and that CAS&#x27;s independence from the parties was secured by the method of selecting arbitrators and the possibility to appeal to the Swiss Federal Tribunal. However, this decision was in turn overturned by the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany, which ordered a re-trial that is still pending.

==History==
With the intermixing of sports and politics, the body was originally conceived by International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch to deal with disputes arising during the Olympics. It was established as part of the IOC in 1984.

In 1992, the case of &quot;Gundel v. La Fédération Equestre Internationale&quot; was decided by the CAS, and then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, challenging CAS impartiality. The Swiss court ruled that the CAS was a true court of arbitration but drew attention to the numerous links between the CAS and the IOC.

In response, the CAS underwent reforms to make itself more independent of the IOC, both organizationally and financially. The most significant change resulting from this reform was the creation of an &quot;International Council of Arbitration for Sport&quot; (ICAS) to look after the running and financing of the CAS, thereby taking the place of the IOC.

As of 2022, 9695 cases had been submitted to CAS since 1986. Ordinary and ad hoc cases were first accepted in 1995, mediation cases in 1999, and anti-doping cases in 2016. As of August 2024, there are 422 CAS Arbitrators around the world, with 216 from Europe, and 52 Mediators.

==Jurisprudence examples of note==
===Doping===

* In March 2011, CAS decided its first case on athlete biological passports (ABP) when it suspended two Italian cyclists, Franco Pellizotti and Pietro Caucchioli, for two years based on evidence from their blood profiles.

:Prior to that, the case of skater Claudia Pechstein had been decided (2009/A/1912 &amp; 1913) on similar grounds. Writing in the 2011/2 &quot;CAS Bulletin&quot; regarding the institution of the ABP program, CAS Counsel Despina Mavromati differentiated between the two types of cases and wrote:

* In 2001, the court decided the case of &quot;Andreea Răducan v. International Olympic Committee&quot;. This was a controversial anti-doping case, where it was fairly clear the athlete received cold and flu tablets from her doctor. This resulted in a positive urine test, with the court concluding:
* The court is reluctant to overturn field of play decisions, though it may do so in cases where there is clear evidence that the officials acted in bad faith or with arbitrariness. In CAS 2010/A/2090, the CAS Panel explained that the reason for this is not a matter of jurisdiction but arbitral self-restraint.
* In October 2011, in a case affecting the 2012 Summer Olympics, the court declared that a part of the Olympic Charter violated the World Anti-Doping Code. The &quot;Osaka rule&quot; therein had prevented athletes suspended for at least six months for anti-doping rule violations from competing at the Olympic Games following the suspension&#x27;s expiration. The court later reaffirmed this decision, when it struck down a long-standing by-law of the British Olympic Association (BOA) preventing the selection of athletes sanctioned for doping. Both the IOC and BOA have responded by campaigning for adding a similar rule to the World Anti-Doping Code.
*In July 2016, CAS confirmed that the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) could not enter track and field athletes for the 2016 Summer Olympics, except for those cleared by the IAAF under the new competition rules regarding &quot;neutral athletes&quot;. As the IOC was not a party to the case, the panel found it lacked jurisdiction to decide on whether the IOC could allow such cleared athletes to represent Russia, allow them to compete independently, or refuse their participation entirely. The claimants disputed the validity and enforceability of IAAF Competition rule 22.1(a), regarding the suspension of the national federation (RusAF, formerly ARAF), and rule 22.1A, regarding the eligibility of athletes from suspended federations. The panel found that neither rule could be construed as sanctions, and for this and other reasons, they were consistent with the World Anti-Doping Code. The panels commented on the futility of the challenge to the new rule 22.1A, noting that as the rule provided athletes from Russia a new route to participation, a successful challenge would lead to the exclusion of athletes eligible under the rule, not the inclusion of other athletes. The panel decided against evaluating whether the principle of estoppel applies to sporting disputes, as it found the claims, in this case, would have failed. At the same time, in a separate decision, the panel rejected the appeals of 67 Russian athletes against the decisions of the IAAF denying their applications to appear as &quot;neutral athletes&quot; at the 2016 Summer Olympics. Darya Klishina was the only Russian athlete cleared by both the IAAF and the IOC. However, the IAAF declared her ineligible on 12 August based on new information. On 15 August, the CAS ad hoc court upheld Klishina&#x27;s appeal.
*The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) decided to ban Russia from the 2016 Summer Paralympics due to the findings of the McLaren report. The appeal of the Russian Paralympic Committee (RPC) against the ban was dismissed by the CAS on 23 August. The court found that the suspension had a basis in the IPC rules and stated that it &quot;was proportionate in the circumstances&quot;. The panel noted that it had not decided the rights of individual athletes. In its reasoned decision the panel elaborated on this point, stating that adverse consequences for the athletes represented by the RPC were not a reason to absolve the organisation from its legal responsibilities. The panel dismissed the claim that the IOC decision should have influenced the IPC decision, noting that the organisations have separate charters and rules. As the IPC also acts as an IF the court referred to the case between the RWF and the IWF where CAS upheld a similar suspension.
*In late 2017, the IOC disqualified a large number of Russian athletes&#x27; results from the 2014 Winter Olympics. The athletes were also given lifetime bans from future editions of the games. CAS registered 42 appeals, of which 39 were decided before the 2018 Winter Olympics. For 28 athletes, the panel found that the evidence presented by the IOC was not sufficient to establish rule violations. The disqualifications were upheld in the 11 remaining cases, but the ban was limited to the 2018 Games. The panel made clear that its mandate was limited to the individual cases. The case did not affect the status of Russian athletes participating in PyeongChang. The IOC expressed its regret with the decision regarding the 28 athletes whose appeals were fully upheld, stating that the level of proof required was inconsistent with earlier CAS decisions. The IOC also stated that the sanctions being lifted were not a sufficient reason for inviting the 28 athletes to compete at the 2018 Games. The IOC said it would consider its options after receiving the reasoned decision. In response to the ruling by CAS, Jim Walden, the attorney representing Dr. Grigory Rodchenkov, stated that the ruling made a &quot;mockery&quot; of the sanctions against Russia.
* In 2018, the World Anti-Doping Agency appealed to the CAS after FIFA reduced a suspension of Peruvian national team captain Paolo Guerrero. Guerrero had tested positive for cocaine after a World Cup qualifier against Argentina after ingesting a tea containing the substance. Guerrero was initially suspended for twelve months, but this was later halved by FIFA&#x27;s appeal committee. WADA, in turn, appealed to CAS, and they imposed the fourteen-month ban in May 2018, which will cause Guerrero to miss the 2018 FIFA World Cup. CAS confirmed the existence of an anti-doping rule violation (ADRV) but also accepted that Guerrero was not trying to enhance his performance by ingesting the substance. The panel had considered that the player did bear some fault or negligence, even if it was not significant, and that he could have taken some measures to prevent him from committing the ADRV.

====2016 Summer Olympics ad hoc court====

The ad hoc court for the 2016 Olympics had registered 18 cases by 3 August, surpassing the record two days before the Opening Ceremony. 11 of the cases were related to the various bans on Russian athletes related to the allegations of state-sponsored doping documented in the McLaren report. By the end of the Games the total number of cases was 28, 16 of which were related to the eligibility of Russian athletes.
*On 3 August, the ad hoc court dismissed the appeal of the Russian Weightlifting Federation against its complete suspension under article 12.4 of the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) anti-doping rules. The panel stated that the findings of the McLaren report constituted &quot;conduct connected with or associated with doping&quot;, and found that the IWF had acted within its discretion when it decided that the RWF had brought the sport of weightlifting into disrepute. The panel noted that the re-analysis of doping tests from the 2008 and 2012 Olympics had found nine cases of Russian athletes testing positive for Turinabol and stated that this indicated a centralized doping programme. Furthermore, the panel commented that the positive tests for Turinabol were consistent with the evidence provided by Dr Grigory Rodchenkov for the report.
*A separate panel of the ad hoc court found that the International Rowing Federation (FISA) had correctly applied the eligibility criteria outlined in the IOC decision of 24 July when it denied the entry of 17 athletes. One of the criteria in the IOC decision was that the ROC could not enter athletes that had previously served a doping ban. The CAS panel deciding the case involving the rowers Anastasia Karabelshikova and Ivan Podshivalov found this criterion unenforceable, and ordered FISA to evaluate the athletes according to the remaining criteria. The panel referred to previous decisions on the &quot;Osaka rule&quot; and the BOA by-law. The panel compared the IOC decision with the IAAF decision on Russian athletes, and noted that the IOC, unlike the IAAF, had left athletes with a previous doping conviction without any path to participation, contravening principles of natural justice. The same conclusion was shortly thereafter reached in the case of swimmer Yulia Efimova, who subsequently competed and medalled at the Games.
*In the cases of canoeists Natalia Podolskaya and Alexander Dyachenko and rower Ivan Balandin the panels dismissed the applications, upholding the part of the IOC decision of 24 July that removed the presumption of innocence from Russian athletes. Balandin challenged the legality of the IOC decision, while Podolskaya and Dyachenko only challenged its application. The panel in Balandin&#x27;s case found no reason to annul the second paragraph of the IOC decision, which, among other criteria, established that nobody implicated in the McLaren report was eligible for participation at the Games. The panel noted that while the decision establishes a presumption of guilt, this presumption is rebuttable by individual athletes. All three athletes were found to have benefitted from the &quot;Disappearing Positive Methodology&quot; described in the McLaren report and thus failed to meet the eligibility criteria of the IOC decision. The panels differed as to which standard of proof they required for the athletes&#x27; rebuttal of this presumption.

===Other cases===

* In July 2015, in a case involving the issue of sex verification in sports, the CAS issued an interim arbitral award suspending the regulations used by the IAAF to determine whether athletes with hyperandrogenism were eligible to compete in professional women&#x27;s athletics. The regulations stated that athletes with testosterone levels above 10 nmol/L were not allowed to compete in the female category. The regulations were challenged by Indian sprinter Dutee Chand. The panel ordered the IAAF to file scientific evidence regarding the connection between athletic performance and elevated testosterone levels within two years of the issuance of the interim award. This deadline was extended by two months by the CAS after an agreement between the parties. In January 2018 the CAS suspended the case for six months, asking the IAAF to clarify whether it intended to replace the disputed regulations with new rules which would not affect Chand&#x27;s events. If the IAAF were to modify its rules the case would terminate. The original regulations remain suspended. In 2019, the CAS upheld the new IAAF regulations regarding intersex athletes, which require athletes with certain specific intersex conditions to reduce their testosterone in order to participate in certain women&#x27;s competitions.
* The court ruled in 2006 that Gibraltar had valid grounds for its application to join UEFA, forcing the organisation to hand it provisional membership. At the next UEFA Congress, however, Gibraltar was overwhelmingly rejected in a vote due to lobbying from Spain, in defiance of the CAS ruling. Gibraltar subsequently became a member of UEFA in 2013. In May 2016, CAS partially upheld Gibraltar&#x27;s appeal against a decision by FIFA denying membership. The court did not grant FIFA membership but ruled that FIFA should grant a full membership as soon as possible. Gibraltar was granted membership at the FIFA Congress held later the same month.
* In 2010, the Irish Football Association (IFA) (the association of Northern Ireland) took its case to CAS after FIFA failed to prevent the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) (the association of the Republic of Ireland) from selecting Northern Irish-born players who had no blood link to the Republic. The CAS ruled in favour of the FAI and FIFA by confirming that they were correctly applying the regulations.
* In February 2020, Manchester City lodged an appeal to CAS against UEFA&#x27;s decision to ban the club from European competitions for two years and to fine it €30,000,000 for alleged breaches of Financial Fair Play and Club Licensing regulations. The ban was rescinded by CAS on 13 July 2020 after the panel decided that the club &#x27;did not disguise equity funding as sponsorship contributions&#x27;. However, the club was fined 10 million Euros for failing to co-operate with UEFA investigatory chamber in the first instance which breached UEFA Club Licensing Regulations.
* In 2015, UEFA banned its former president Michel Platini from football-related activity for six years. CAS lowered the ban to four years. Platini&#x27;s appeals to Swiss courts and the European Court of Human Rights were unsuccessful.

<doc id="930650" wikidata="Q3336837" url="?curid=930650" title="National Association of Manufacturers">
<text>The National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) is an advocacy group headquartered in Washington, D.C., with additional offices across the United States. It is the nation&#x27;s largest manufacturing industrial trade association, representing 14,000 small and large manufacturing companies in every industrial sector and in all 50 states. Jay Timmons has led the organization as President and CEO since 2011.

A 2018 &quot;Business Insider&quot; article described the NAM as &quot;a behemoth in the US capital, receiving unfettered access to the White House and top lawmakers on Capitol Hill.&quot; In 2018, House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady commented that passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would not have happened without leadership from the National Association of Manufacturers.

==Policy issues==
The NAM&#x27;s policy issue work is focused in the areas of labor, employment, health care, energy, corporate finance, tax, bilateral trade, multilateral trade, export controls, technology, regulatory and infrastructure policy. The organization emphasizes four pillars that are supposed to make America great: free enterprise, competitiveness, individual liberty, and equal opportunity.

The NAM releases a Manufacturing Outlook Survey every quarter. As of the second quarter of 2018, according to the NAM, 95.1% of manufacturers registered a positive outlook for their company, &quot;the highest level recorded in the survey’s 20-year history.&quot; The same survey found that manufacturers rated &quot;the inability to attract and retain a quality workforce&quot; as their top concern. President Donald Trump mentioned the NAM’s survey in an event at the White House in April 2018.

The NAM’s Manufacturing Institute is a 501(c)3 dedicated to developing a modern manufacturing workforce to help manufacturers get skilled, qualified and productive workers to remain competitive. The Institute sponsors Manufacturing Day on the first Friday of October, a nationwide event for manufacturers to host students, parents, and policy-leaders and &quot;address common misperceptions about manufacturing.&quot;

In 2017, the NAM launched the Manufacturers’ Accountability Project (MAP), a campaign run through the Manufacturers’ Center for Legal Action (MCLA) to combat frivolous, politically-motivated lawsuits against energy manufacturers. As of August 2018, three of those lawsuits have been dismissed from court.

According to NAM, manufacturing employs nearly 12 million workers, contributes more than $2.25 trillion to the U.S. economy annually, is the largest driver of economic growth in the nation and accounts for the majority of private sector research and development. In 2022, after the brunt of the COVID-19 pandemic led to new competition for a dwindling labor force, NAM predicted that, by 2030, 2.1 million US jobs in manufacturing could go unfilled.

===Legislation===

==== Exemption from federal efficiency standards ====
NAM supported the EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 (H.R. 5057; 113th Congress), a bill that would exempt certain external power supplies from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the United States Department of Energy in February 2014. The United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce describes the bill as a bill that &quot;provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act to exempt certain power supply (EPS) service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards.&quot;

==== Opposition to federal right-to-repair legislation ====
In July 2024, NAM signed a letter to members of both the House Committee on Armed Services and the Senate Committee on Armed Services opposing Section 828 of S. 4628, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, concerning right to repair and entitled &quot;Requirement for Contractors to Provide Reasonable Access to Repair Materials,&quot; which would require contractors doing business with the US military to agree &quot;to provide the Department of Defense fair and reasonable access to all the repair materials, including parts, tools, and information, used by the manufacturer or provider or their authorized partners to diagnose, maintain, or repair the good or service.&quot;

==Board of directors==
The NAM&#x27;s Board of Directors includes Chairman David Farr, former CEO of Emerson Electric Company, President Jay Timmons, CEO of NAM; and Vice Chair of the Board David T. Seaton, Chairman and CEO, Fluor Corporation, among others.

==History==
NAM was founded by Thomas P. Egan, late President of the Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and head of the J.A. Fay and Egan Co., woodworking and machinery company, not long after reading an editorial in the magazine &quot;Dixie&quot;, out of Atlanta, Georgia, during the depression of 1894. This editorial urged the manufacturers of the time to organize and work together to improve business conditions nationally. Under Egan&#x27;s leadership, organization began, and a group was created; they called themselves the &quot;Big 50&quot;; he invited them, and asked them to invite others, to Cincinnati. On Jan 25, 1895, in the Oddfellows Temple, where 583 manufacturers attended, NAM was created. &quot;The U.S. was in the midst of a deep recession and many of the nation&#x27;s manufacturers saw a strong need to export their products in other countries. One of the NAM&#x27;s earliest efforts was to call for the creation of the U.S. Department of Commerce&quot;. The organization&#x27;s first president was Thomas Dolan of Philadelphia (not, as erroneously listed in some sources, Samuel P. Bush).

The early history of NAM was marked by frank verbal attacks on labor. In 1903, President David MacLean Parry delivered a speech at its annual convention which argued that unions&#x27; goals would result in &quot;despotism, tyranny, and slavery.&quot; Parry advocated the establishment of a great national anti-union federation under the control of the NAM, and the NAM responded by initiating such an effort.

In an address at its 1911 convention, NAM President John Kirby Jr. proclaimed, &quot;The American Federation of Labor is engaged in an open warfare against Jesus Christ and his cause.&quot;

The NAM also encouraged the creation and propagation of a network of local anti-union organizations, many of which took the name Citizens&#x27; Alliance. In October 1903 the local Citizens&#x27; Alliance groups were united by a national organization called the Citizens&#x27; Industrial Alliance of America.

The NAM, in the late 1930s, used one of the earliest versions of a modern multi-faceted public relations campaign. The aim of this effort was to convince the American public and academia of the existential merits of an economic system free of governmental regulation and initiatives, and to combat the policies of President Franklin Roosevelt. NAM made efforts to undermine organized labor in the United States before the New Deal.

The NAM lobbied successfully for the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act to restrict the unions&#x27; power.

The advent of commercial television led to the NAM&#x27;s own 15-minute television program, &quot;Industry on Parade&quot;, which aired from 1950–1960.

President Donald Trump addressed the NAM board in 2017. NAM hired several former Trump officials as lobbyists. During the 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol building, NAM equated the events to &quot;sedition&quot; and called for Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment of the United States Constitution &quot;to preserve democracy.&quot;

<text>Lee Hyo-jung (; ; born 13 January 1981) is a South Korean former badminton player.

She won the gold medal in badminton mixed doubles at the 2008 Summer Olympics with her partner, Lee Yong-dae. Lee Hyo-jung and Lee Yong-dae were unseeded, and in the finals they beat the top seeds and 2005 and 2007 world champions Lilyana Natsir and Nova Widianto of Indonesia, 21-11, 21-17.

Lee Hyo-jung also won the silver medal in badminton women&#x27;s doubles at the aforementioned Olympics with Lee Kyung-won; they were seeded fourth and lost to the second-seeded Chinese pair, Du Jing and Yu Yang.

Lee became the first woman in Korean history to win gold medals at both the Olympics and the Asian Games. In the 2010 Asian Games, she partnered with Shin Baek-cheol instead of her usual partner, Lee Yong-dae. After winning the medal, she announced her retirement despite many pleas from her coaches and fans at home to continue playing until the London Olympics in 2012.

==Career==
In 1998, Lee who attended the Haksan Girls&#x27; High School won the girls&#x27; singles, doubles, and mixed doubles events at the German Junior tournament.

In 2000, Lee won the Asian Championships in the women&#x27;s doubles event with her partner Yim Kyung-jin. At the age of 19, Lee competed at the Sydney Olympics in the women&#x27;s doubles with Yim and in the mixed doubles with Lee Dong-soo.

In 2003, she and Hwang also the runner-up at the Thailand and Chinese Taipei Open.

In 2008, Lee won her first All England Open Championship title in women&#x27;s doubles with partner Lee Kyung-won, beating Yang Wei and Zhang Jiewen in the semifinals and Du Jing and Yu Yang in the final. In August, she and Lee Yong-dae won mixed doubles gold medals in Beijing Olympics, beating Lilyana Natsir and Nova Widianto of Indonesia and also with Lee Kyung-won grabbed the silver medal in the women&#x27;s doubles event. In 2009, Lee and Lee Yong-dae became world number one. They won three titles: Korea Open Super Series, Asian Badminton Championship, and China Open Super Series. They also played for Korea in Sudirman Cup in May. In the final, Korea lost to China 0-3. Lee and Lee were defeated by the Chinese pair, Zheng Bo and Yu Yang.

In 2010, Lee competed in the 2010 Uber Cup as a member of the South Korean women&#x27;s national team. There she led her team to its first Uber Cup trophy, winning all 4 doubles matches she competed in through the tourney. In the finals, she and her partner Kim Min-jung won against WR #1 Ma Jin and Wang Xiaoli, beating them 18–21, 21–12, 21–15. Although Lee and Kim were not regular partners and Lee Hyo-Jung stopped playing WD regularly in international games, Lee played exceptionally well, proving why she was the most successful player in the 2008 Olympics, winning both gold and silver medals. In June, Lee continued on playing women&#x27;s doubles with Kim Min-jung, winning the Indonesia Open and the Chinese Taipei Grand Prix Gold, and finishing as a runner-up in the Singapore Open. While waiting for Lee Yong-dae to recover from his injury, she played mixed doubles with Shin Baek-cheol.

In August, Lee partnered again with Lee Yong-dae in the Kumpoo Macau Open Badminton Championships, Chinese Taipei Grand Prix Gold, and World Championship, but their best finish was reaching the quarterfinals in the Chinese Taipei Grand Prix. They were hit with Lee Hyo Jung&#x27;s back injury and Lee Yong-dae getting used to playing again after rehab and possibly not fully recovering from the previous injury. Due to these reasons, the head coach of the Korea Badminton Team was quoted as saying that Lee Hyo-jung and Lee Yong-dae had not had sufficient time to practice together. Lee Yong-dae decided to stop playing mixed doubles altogether, possibly due to the strain on his injured elbow from playing both men&#x27;s and mixed doubles. In November, Lee Hyo-jung entered Asian Games in three games total: women&#x27;s, mixed, and team event. In the women&#x27;s doubles and team event, she won bronze medals. However, in mixed doubles, she partnered with Shin Baek-cheol, with whom she had previously played only two tournaments, but they still managed to win against two Chinese pairs (Zhang Nan and Zhao Yunlei, He Han Bin and Ma Jin) at their home court, becoming the first woman in Korean history to win both Olympic and Asian Game gold medals.

<text>The Pacific Media Expo (PMX) is an annual three day multi-genre convention held during October/November at the Sheraton Los Angeles San Gabriel in San Gabriel, California. PMX was created in 2003 by Mike Tatsugawa, founder of Anime Expo. Pacific Media Association, the parent of Pacific Media Expo is based in Los Angeles, California.

==Programming==
The convention typically offers art exhibitions, artists market, anime music video contest, anime video rooms, autograph sessions, concerts, live performances, exhibit hall, fashion show, gaming tournaments, iron cosplay, masquerade, panel discussions, swap meets, video rooms (animation, Asian cinema, and Korean drama), and workshops.

==History==
PMX was formed by staff members from several conventions and former staff of Anime Expo after several years of planning and research. The convention was created as a for-profit event due to concerns over the restraints of non-profit status. Miyavi cancelled his appearance at Pacific Media Expo in 2004 due to the lack of an engineer and the convention offered a registration refund. Silver Ash was unable to attend due performer visa backlogs.

Several issues affected the success of the 2004 convention, including the concerts being on a separate day (28th) from the convention (29th-31st), and the concerts and convention having separate tickets. The convention utilized the same space as Anime Expo. Potential attendance was overestimated, as PMX prepared for 10,000, but only had 3,000. Concert turnout was considered a success, but only an estimated 25% attended the convention afterwards. Also complicating the event was the Memorial Day weekend with graduations, proms, and FanimeCon. The convention for 2005 moved to Labor Day with adjustments made to the space required.

Pacific Media Expo did not occur in 2017 due to schedule conflicts with NCAA football and the convention&#x27;s traditional November date. Pacific Media Expo 2020 was a virtual convention due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

<text>The Romanian revolution () was a period of violent civil unrest in Romania during December 1989 as a part of the revolutions of 1989 that occurred in several countries around the world, primarily within the Eastern Bloc. The Romanian revolution started in the city of Timișoara and soon spread throughout the country, ultimately culminating in the drumhead trial and execution of longtime Romanian Communist Party (PCR) General Secretary Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena, and the end of 42 years of Communist rule in Romania. It was also the last removal of a Marxist–Leninist government in a Warsaw Pact country during the events of 1989, and the only one that violently overthrew a country&#x27;s leadership and executed its leader; according to estimates, over one thousand people died and thousands more were injured.

Following World War II, Romania found itself inside the Soviet sphere of influence, with Communist rule officially declared in 1947. In April 1964, when Romania published a general policy paper worked out under Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s instructions, the country was well on its way of carefully breaking away from Soviet control. Nicolae Ceaușescu became the country&#x27;s leader the following year. Under his rule, Romania experienced a brief waning of internal repression that led to a positive image both at home and in the West. However, repression again intensified by the 1970s. Amid tensions in the late 1980s, early protests occurred in the city of Timișoara in mid-December on the part of the Hungarian minority in response to an attempt by the government to evict Hungarian Reformed Church pastor László Tőkés. In response, Romanians sought the deposition of Ceaușescu and a change in government in light of similar recent events in neighbouring nations. The country&#x27;s ubiquitous secret police force, the Securitate, which was both one of the largest in the Eastern Bloc and for decades had been the main suppressor of popular dissent, frequently and violently quashing political disagreement, ultimately proved incapable of stopping the looming, and then highly fatal and successful revolt.

Social and economic malaise had been present in the Socialist Republic of Romania for quite some time, especially during the austerity years of the 1980s. The austerity measures were designed in part by Ceaușescu to repay the country&#x27;s foreign debts, but resulted in widespread shortages that fomented unrest. Shortly after a botched public speech by Ceaușescu in the capital Bucharest that was broadcast to millions of Romanians on state television, rank-and-file members of the military switched, almost unanimously, from supporting the dictator to backing the protesters. Riots, street violence and murders in several Romanian cities over the course of roughly a week led the Romanian leader to flee the capital city on 22 December with his wife, Elena. Evading capture by hastily departing via helicopter effectively portrayed the couple as both fugitives and also seemingly guilty of accused crimes. Captured in Târgoviște, they were tried by a drumhead military tribunal on charges of genocide, damage to the national economy, and abuse of power to execute military actions against the Romanian people. They were convicted on all charges, sentenced to death, and immediately executed on Christmas Day 1989. They were the last people to be condemned to death and executed in Romania, as capital punishment was abolished soon after. For several days after Ceaușescu fled, many would be killed in the crossfire between civilians and armed forces personnel which believed the other to be Securitate ‘terrorists’. Although news reports at the time and media today will make reference to the Securitate fighting against the revolution, there has never been any evidence to support the claim of an organised effort against the revolution by the Securitate. Hospitals in Bucharest were treating as many as thousands of civilians. Following an ultimatum, many Securitate members turned themselves in on 29 December with the assurance they would not be tried.

Present-day Romania has unfolded in the shadow of the Ceaușescus along with its Communist past, and its tumultuous departure from it. After Ceaușescu was summarily executed, the National Salvation Front (FSN) quickly took power, promising free and fair elections within five months. Elected in a landslide the following May, the FSN reconstituted as a political party, installed a series of economic and democratic reforms, with further social policy changes being implemented by later governments. From that point on, Romania has become far more integrated with the West. Romania became a member of NATO and the European Union in 2004 and 2007, respectively. While democratic reforms have proven to be moderately successful, though issues with corruption remain. Economic reforms continue, with Romania still possessing, for example, one of the highest child poverty rates in the developed world.

==Background==

In 1981, Ceaușescu began an austerity programme designed to enable Romania to liquidate its entire national debt (US$10,000,000,000). To achieve this, many basic goods—including gas, heating and food—were rationed, which reduced the standard of living and increased malnutrition. The infant mortality rate grew to be the highest in Europe.

The secret police, the Securitate, had become so omnipresent that it made Romania a police state. Free speech was limited and opinions that did not favor the Romanian Communist Party (PCR) were forbidden. The large numbers of Securitate informers made organised dissent nearly impossible. The regime deliberately played on this sense that everyone was being watched to make it easier to bend the people to the Party&#x27;s will. Even by Soviet Bloc standards, the Securitate was exceptionally brutal.

Ceaușescu created a cult of personality, with weekly shows in stadiums or on streets in different cities dedicated to him, his wife and the Communist Party. There were several megalomaniac projects, such as the construction of the grandiose House of the Republic (today the Palace of the Parliament)—the biggest palace in the world—the adjacent Centrul Civic and a never-completed museum dedicated to Communism and Ceaușescu, today the Casa Radio. These and similar projects drained the country&#x27;s finances and aggravated the already dire economic situation. Thousands of Bucharest residents were evicted from their homes, which were subsequently demolished to make room for the huge structures.

Unlike the other Warsaw Pact leaders, Ceaușescu had not been slavishly pro-Soviet but rather had pursued an &quot;independent&quot; foreign policy; Romanian forces did not join their Warsaw Pact allies in putting an end to the Prague Spring—an invasion Ceaușescu openly denounced—while Romanian athletes competed at the Soviet-boycotted 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles (receiving a standing ovation at the opening ceremonies and proceeding to win 53 medals, trailing only the United States and West Germany in the overall count). Conversely, while Soviet Communist Party General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev spoke of reform, Ceaușescu maintained a hard political line and cult of personality.

The austerity programme started in 1981 and the widespread poverty it introduced made the Communist regime very unpopular. The austerity programmes were met with little resistance among Romanians and there were only a few strikes and labour disputes, of which the Jiu Valley miners&#x27; strike of 1977 and the Brașov Rebellion of November 1987 at the truck manufacturer Steagul Roșu were the most notable. In March 1989, several leading activists of the PCR criticised Ceaușescu&#x27;s economic policies in a letter, but shortly thereafter he achieved a significant political victory: Romania paid off its external debt of about US$11,000,000,000 several months before the time that even the Romanian dictator expected. However, in the months following the austerity programme, shortages of goods remained the same as before.

Like the East German state newspaper, official Romanian news organs made no mention of the fall of the Berlin Wall in the first days following 9 November 1989. The most notable news in Romanian newspapers of 11 November 1989, was the &quot;masterly lecture by comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu at the extended plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Romania,&quot; in which the Romanian head of state and party highly praised the &quot;brilliant programme for the work and revolutionary struggle of all our people,&quot; as well as the &quot;exemplary fulfillment of economic tasks.&quot; What had happened northwest of Bucharest, in divided Berlin, during those days is not even mentioned. Socialism is praised as the &quot;way of the free, independent development of the peoples.&quot; The same day, on Bucharest&#x27;s Brezoianu Street and Kogălniceanu Boulevard, a group of students from Cluj-Napoca attempted a demonstration but were quickly apprehended. It initially appeared that Ceaușescu would weather the wave of revolution sweeping across Eastern Europe, as he was formally re-elected for another five-year term as General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party on 24 November at the party&#x27;s XIV Congress. On that same day, Ceaușescu&#x27;s counterpart in Czechoslovakia, Miloš Jakeš, resigned along with the entire Communist leadership, effectively ending Communist rule in Czechoslovakia.

The three students, Mihnea Paraschivescu, Grațian Vulpe, and the economist Dan Căprariu-Schlachter from Cluj, were detained and investigated by the Securitate at the Rahova Penitentiary on suspicion of propaganda against the socialist society. They were released on 22 December 1989 at 14:00. There were other letters and attempts to draw attention to the economic, cultural, and spiritual oppression of Romanians, but they served only to intensify the activity of the police and Securitate.

===Mounting isolation within the Warsaw Pact===
On 20 November 1989 (the day when Ceaușescu was reelected as leader of the Romanian Communist Party) almost all of the Warsaw Pact Communist regimes were institutionally intact. The leading role of the Communist Party was enshrined in their constitutions and the party militia was active. The lone exception was Hungary, where, in October 1989, the leading role of the party was rescinded from the constitution and the party militia was abolished. However, very soon after Ceaușescu&#x27;s reelection, the other communist regimes in the Warsaw Pact began to crumble as well. The party militia was abolished in Poland on 23 November and then in Bulgaria on 25 November. The leading role of the party was rescinded from the constitution of Czechoslovakia on 29 November and from that of East Germany on 1 December. Even the Soviet Union&#x27;s Communist regime had started to unravel while Ceaușescu was still in power: on 7 December 1989, one of its 15 Union Republics, Lithuania, removed the leading role of the Communist Party from its constitution.

==Timișoara uprising==
On 16 December 1989, the Hungarian minority in Timișoara held a public protest in response to an attempt by the government to evict Hungarian Reformed church Pastor László Tőkés. In July of that year, in an interview with Hungarian television, Tőkés had criticised the regime&#x27;s Systematisation policy and complained that Romanians did not even know their human rights. As Tőkés described it later, the interview, which had been seen in the border areas and was then spread all over Romania, had &quot;a shock effect upon the Romanians, the Securitate as well, on the people of Romania. […] [I]t had an unexpected effect upon the public atmosphere in Romania.&quot;

At the behest of the government, his bishop removed him from his post, thereby depriving him of the right to use the apartment to which he was entitled as a pastor, and assigned him to be a pastor in the countryside. For some time his parishioners gathered around his home to protect him from harassment and eviction. Many passersby spontaneously joined in. As it became clear that the crowd would not disperse, the mayor, Petre Moț, made remarks suggesting that he had overturned the decision to evict Tőkés. Meanwhile, the crowd had grown impatient and, when Moț declined to confirm his statement against the planned eviction in writing, the crowd started to chant anti-communist slogans. Subsequently, police and Securitate forces showed up at the scene. By 19:30 the protest had spread and the original cause became largely irrelevant.

Some of the protesters attempted to burn down the building that housed the district committee of the PCR. The Securitate responded with tear gas and water cannons, while police beat up rioters and arrested many of them. Around 21:00 the rioters withdrew. They regrouped eventually around the Timișoara Orthodox Cathedral and started a protest march around the city, but again they were confronted by the security forces.

===Crackdown===
Riots and protests resumed the following day, 17 December. The rioters broke into the district committee building and threw party documents, propaganda brochures, Ceaușescu&#x27;s writings, and other symbols of Communist power out of windows.

The military was sent in to control the riots, because the situation was beyond the capability of the Securitate and conventional police to handle. The presence of the army in the streets was an ominous sign; it meant that they had received their orders from the highest level of the command chain, presumably from Ceaușescu himself. The army failed to establish order, and chaos ensued, including gunfire, fights, casualties, and burned cars. Transportor Amfibiu Blindat (TAB) armoured personnel carriers and tanks were called in.

After 20:00, from Piața Libertății (Liberty Square) to the Opera, there was wild shooting, including the area of Decebal bridge, Calea Lipovei (Lipovei Avenue) and Calea Girocului (Girocului Avenue). Tanks, trucks and TABs blocked the accesses into the city, while helicopters hovered overhead. After midnight, the protests calmed down. Colonel-General Ion Coman, local Party secretary Ilie Matei, and Colonel-General Ștefan Gușă (Chief of the Romanian General Staff) inspected the city. Some areas looked like the aftermath of a war: destruction, rubble and blood.

On the morning of 18 December, the centre was being guarded by soldiers and Securitate agents in plainclothes. Ceaușescu departed for a visit to Iran, leaving the duty of crushing the Timișoara revolt to his subordinates and his wife. Mayor Moț ordered a party gathering to take place at the university, with the purpose of condemning the &quot;vandalism&quot; of the previous days. He also declared martial law, prohibiting people from going about in groups of larger than two.

Defying the curfew, a group of 30 young men headed for the Orthodox cathedral, where they stopped and waved a Romanian flag from which they had removed the Romanian communist coat of arms, leaving a distinctive hole, in a manner similar to the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. Expecting that they would be fired upon, they started to sing &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot; (&quot;Awaken thee, Romanian!&quot;), an earlier patriotic song that had been banned in 1947 (but then partially co-opted by the Ceaușescu regime once he fashioned himself as a nationalist). Ethnic Hungarian protesters also chanted &quot;Români, veniți cu noi!&quot; (&quot;Romanians, come with us&quot;, to convey that the protest was by and for all citizens of Romania, not an ethnic minority matter). They were, indeed, fired upon; some died and others were seriously injured, while the lucky ones were able to escape.

On 19 December, local Party functionary Radu Bălan and Colonel-General Ștefan Gușă visited workers in the city&#x27;s factories, but failed to get them to resume work. On 20 December, massive columns of workers entered the city. About 100,000 protesters occupied Piața Operei (Opera Square – today Piața Victoriei, Victory Square) and chanted anti-government slogans: &quot;Noi suntem poporul!&quot; (&quot;We are the people!&quot;), &quot;Armata e cu noi!&quot; (&quot;The army is on our side!&quot;), &quot;Nu vă fie frică, Ceaușescu pică!&quot; (&quot;Have no fear, Ceaușescu is falling!&quot;)

Meanwhile, Secretary to the Central Committee Emil Bobu and Prime Minister Constantin Dăscălescu were sent by Elena Ceaușescu (Nicolae being at that time in Iran) to resolve the situation. They met with a delegation of the protesters and agreed to free the majority of the arrested protesters. However, they refused to comply with the protesters&#x27; main demand— the resignation of Ceaușescu—and the situation remained essentially unchanged.

The next day, trains loaded with workers from factories in Oltenia arrived in Timișoara. The regime was attempting to use them to repress the mass protests, but after a brief encounter they ended up joining the protests. One worker explained, &quot;Yesterday our factory boss and a party official rounded us up in the yard, handed us wooden clubs and told us that Hungarians and &#x27;hooligans&#x27; were devastating Timișoara and that it is our duty to go there and help crush the riots. But I realised that wasn&#x27;t the truth.&quot;

Upon Ceaușescu&#x27;s return from Iran on the evening of 20 December, the situation became even more tense, and he gave a televised speech from the TV studio inside the Central Committee Building (CC Building) in which he spoke about the events at Timișoara in terms of an &quot;interference of foreign forces in Romania&#x27;s internal affairs&quot; and an &quot;external aggression on Romania&#x27;s sovereignty.&quot;

The country, which had no information about the Timișoara events from the national media, heard about the Timișoara revolt from Western radio stations like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, and by word of mouth. A mass meeting was staged for the next day, 21 December, which, according to the official media, was presented as a &quot;spontaneous movement of support for Ceaușescu,&quot; emulating the 1968 meeting in which Ceaușescu had spoken against the invasion of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw Pact forces.

==Revolution spreads==
===Ceaușescu&#x27;s speech===

On the morning of 21 December, Ceaușescu addressed an assembly of approximately 100,000 people to condemn the uprising in Timișoara. Party officials took great pains to make it appear that Ceaușescu was still immensely popular. Several busloads of workers, under threat of being fired upon, arrived in Bucharest&#x27;s Piața Palatului (Palace Square, now Piața Revoluției – Revolution Square) and were given red flags, banners and large pictures of Ceaușescu. They were augmented by bystanders who were rounded up on Calea Victoriei.

Contrary to many reports, Ceaușescu was not at this point hustled inside the building. Instead, undeterred, he and his wife, Elena, along with other officials, spent almost three minutes trying to understand what was happening and haranguing the confused crowd, some of whom appeared to be trying to leave the area, while others moved towards the Central Committee building. Elena wondered aloud whether there was an earthquake in progress. Ceaușescu repeatedly tapped the microphone, trying to call the attention of the crowd. After the tumult died down to some extent, live TV service resumed as Ceaușescu announced that a decision had been taken that morning to raise several allowances, including the minimum wage, from 2,000 to 2,200 lei per month (an increase of 13 U.S. dollars at the time), and the old age pension from 800 to 900 lei per month. Ceaușescu continued his speech, addressing the events of Timisoara and blaming them on imperialist circles and intelligence services that wished to destroy the integrity and sovereignty of Romania and halt the construction of socialism. He continued in this nationalist and Marxist–Leninist vein, referencing his speech of 21 August 1968, where he had asserted Romania&#x27;s independence within the Warsaw Pact at the time of the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and promising to continue to defend socialist Romania as before. In all, following the interruption, the speech and the associated exhortations continued for over 13 minutes, and ended with Ceaușescu waving to the crowd.



===Street confrontations===
As the hours passed many more people took to the streets. Later, observers claimed that even at this point, had Ceaușescu been willing to talk, he might have been able to salvage something. Instead, he decided on force. Soon the protesters—unarmed and unorganised—were confronted by soldiers, tanks, APCs, USLA troops (&quot;Unitatea Specială pentru Lupta Antiteroristă&quot;, anti-terrorist special squads) and armed plainclothes Securitate officers. The crowd was soon being shot at from various buildings, side streets and tanks.

There were many casualties, including deaths, as victims were shot, clubbed to death, stabbed and crushed by armoured vehicles. One APC drove into the crowd around the InterContinental Hotel, crushing people. Physician Florin Filipoiu, who took part in the protests at the InterContinental, declared in a 2010 interview that &quot;it was only an illusion that the Army was on the revolutionaries&#x27; side. A French journalist, Jean-Louis Calderon, was killed. A street near University Square was later named after him, as well as a high school in Timișoara. Belgian journalist Danny Huwé was shot and killed on 23 or 24 December 1989.

Firefighters hit the demonstrators with powerful water cannons, and the police continued to beat and arrest people. Protesters managed to build a defensible barricade in front of the &quot;Dunărea&quot; (&quot;Danube&quot;) restaurant, which stood until after midnight, but was finally torn apart by government forces. Intense shooting continued until after 03:00, by which time the survivors had fled the streets.

Records of the fighting that day include footage shot from helicopters that were sent to raid the area and record evidence for eventual reprisals, as well as by tourists in the high tower of the centrally located InterContinental Hotel, next to the National Theatre and across the street from the university.

It is likely that in the early hours of 22 December that the Ceaușescus made their second mistake. Instead of fleeing the city under cover of night, they decided to wait until morning to leave. Ceaușescu must have thought that his desperate attempts to crush the protests had succeeded, because he apparently called another meeting for the next morning. However, before 07:00, his wife Elena received the news that large columns of workers from many industrial platforms (large communist-era factories or groups of factories concentrated into industrial zones) were heading towards the city centre of Bucharest to join the protests. The police barricades that were meant to block access to Piața Universității (University Square) and Palace Square proved useless. By 09:30 University Square was jammed with protesters. Security forces (army, police and others) re-entered the area, only to join with the protesters.

By 10:00, as the radio broadcast was announcing the introduction of martial law and a ban on groups larger than five persons, hundreds of thousands of people were gathering for the first time, spontaneously, in central Bucharest (the previous day&#x27;s crowd had come together at Ceaușescu&#x27;s orders). Ceaușescu attempted to address the crowd from the balcony of the Central Committee of the Communist Party building, but his attempt was met with a wave of disapproval and anger. Helicopters spread manifestos (which did not reach the crowd, due to unfavourable winds) instructing people not to fall victim to the latest &quot;diversion attempts,&quot; but to go home instead and enjoy the Christmas feast. This order, which drew unfavourable comparisons to Marie Antoinette&#x27;s haughty (but apocryphal) &quot;Let them eat cake&quot;, further infuriated the people who did read the manifestos; many at that time had trouble procuring basic foodstuffs such as cooking oil.

==Military defection and Ceaușescu&#x27;s fall==
At approximately 09:30 on the morning of 22 December Vasile Milea, Ceaușescu&#x27;s minister of defence, died under suspicious circumstances. A communiqué by Ceaușescu stated that Milea had been sacked for treason, and that he had committed suicide after his treason was revealed. The most widespread opinion at the time was that Milea hesitated to follow Ceaușescu&#x27;s orders to fire on the demonstrators, even though tanks had been dispatched to downtown Bucharest that morning. Milea was already in severe disfavour with Ceaușescu for initially sending soldiers to Timișoara without live ammunition. Rank-and-file soldiers believed that Milea had actually been murdered and went over virtually &quot;en masse&quot; to the revolution. Senior commanders wrote off Ceaușescu as a lost cause and made no effort to keep their men loyal to the regime. This effectively ended any chance of Ceaușescu staying in power.

Accounts differ about how Milea died. His family and several junior officers believed he had been shot in his own office by the Securitate, while another group of officers believed he had committed suicide. In 2005 an investigation concluded that the minister killed himself by shooting at his heart, but the bullet missed the heart, hit a nearby artery and led to his death shortly afterward. Some believe that he only tried to incapacitate himself in order to be relieved from office, but it is unclear then why he would shoot in the direction of the heart and not something non-vital like arms or legs.

Upon learning of Milea&#x27;s death, Ceaușescu appointed Victor Stănculescu minister of defence. He accepted after a brief hesitation. Stănculescu, however, ordered the troops back to their quarters without Ceaușescu&#x27;s knowledge, and also persuaded Ceaușescu to leave by helicopter, thus making the dictator a fugitive. At that same moment angry protesters began storming the Communist Party headquarters; Stănculescu and the soldiers under his command did not oppose them.

By refusing to carry out Ceaușescu&#x27;s orders (he was still technically commander-in-chief of the army), Stănculescu played a central role in the overthrow of the dictatorship. &quot;I had the prospect of two execution squads: Ceaușescu&#x27;s and the revolutionary one!&quot; confessed Stănculescu later. In the afternoon, Stănculescu &quot;chose&quot; Ion Iliescu&#x27;s political group from among others that were striving for power in the aftermath of the recent events.

===Helicopter evacuation===
Following Ceaușescu&#x27;s second failed attempt to address the crowd, he and Elena fled into a lift headed for the roof. A group of protesters managed to force their way into the building, overpower Ceaușescu&#x27;s bodyguards and make their way through his office before heading onto the balcony. They were unaware they were only a few metres from Ceaușescu. The lift&#x27;s electricity failed just before it reached the top floor, and Ceaușescu&#x27;s bodyguards forced it open and ushered the couple onto the roof.

At 11:20 on 22 December 1989, Ceaușescu&#x27;s personal pilot, Lieutenant Colonel Vasile Maluțan, received instructions from Lieutenant General Opruta to proceed to Palace Square to pick up the president. As he flew over Palace Square he saw it was impossible to land there. Maluțan landed his white Dauphin, #203, on the terrace at 11:44. A man brandishing a white net curtain from one of the windows waved him down.

Maluțan said, &quot;Then Stelica, the co-pilot, came to me and said that there were demonstrators coming to the terrace. Then the Ceaușescus came out, both practically carried by their bodyguards ... They looked as if they were fainting. They were white with terror. Manea Mănescu [one of the vice-presidents] and Emil Bobu were running behind them. Mănescu, Bobu, Neagoe and another Securitate officer scrambled to the four seats in the back ... As I pulled Ceaușescu in, I saw the demonstrators running across the terrace ... There wasn&#x27;t enough space, Elena Ceaușescu and I were squeezed in between the chairs and the door ... We were only supposed to carry four passengers ... We had six.&quot;

According to Maluțan, it was 12:08 when they left for Snagov. After they arrived there, Ceaușescu took Maluțan into the presidential suite and ordered him to get two helicopters filled with soldiers for an armed guard, and a further Dauphin to come to Snagov. Maluțan&#x27;s unit commander replied on the phone, &quot;There has been a revolution ... You are on your own ... Good luck!&quot;. Maluțan then said to Ceaușescu that the second motor was now warmed up and they needed to leave soon but he could only take four people, not six. Mănescu and Bobu stayed behind. Ceaușescu ordered Maluțan to head for Titu. Near Titu, Maluțan says that he received the national flights denial and had to land to not get shot down by the army.

He did so in a field next to the old road that led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four passengers that he could do nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A bicycle repairman was then flagged down and drove them in his car to Târgoviște. The repairman, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director there guided the Ceaușescus into a room and then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around, transported to the Târgoviște garrison&#x27;s military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.

===Trial and execution===

On 24 December Ion Iliescu, head of the newly formed Council of the National Salvation Front (FSN), signed a decree establishing the Extraordinary Military Tribunal, a drumhead court-martial to try the Ceaușescus for genocide and other crimes. The trial was held on 25 December, lasted for about two hours and delivered death sentences to the couple. Although nominally the Ceaușescus had a right of appeal, their execution followed immediately, just outside the improvised courtroom, being carried out by three paratroopers with their service rifles.

Footage of the trial and of the executed Ceaușescus was promptly released in Romania and to the rest of the world. The actual moment of execution was not filmed; the cameraman only managed to get into the courtyard just as the shooting ended.

In footage of the trial, Nicolae Ceaușescu is seen answering the ad hoc tribunal judging him and referring to some of its members—among them Army General Victor Atanasie Stănculescu and future Romanian Secret Service head Virgil Măgureanu—as &quot;traitors&quot;. In the same video, Ceaușescu dismisses the &quot;tribunal&quot; as illegitimate and demands his constitutional rights to answer to charges in front of a legitimate tribunal.

==New government==

After Ceaușescu left, the mood of the crowds in Palace Square grew celebratory, perhaps even more than in the other former Eastern Bloc countries because of the recent violence. People cried, shouted and gave each other gifts mainly because it was also close to Christmas Day, a long-suppressed holiday in Romania. The occupation of the Central Committee building continued.

People threw Ceaușescu&#x27;s writings, official portraits and propaganda books out the windows, intending to burn them. They also promptly ripped off the giant letters from the roof making up the word &quot;comunist&quot; (&quot;communist&quot;) in the slogan: &quot;Trăiască Partidul Comunist Român!&quot; (&quot;Long live the Communist Party of Romania!&quot;). A young woman appeared on the rooftop and waved a flag with the coat of arms torn out.

At that time, fierce fights were underway at Bucharest Otopeni International Airport between troops sent against each other with the claim that they were going to confront terrorists. Early in the morning, troops sent to reinforce the airport were fired upon. These troops were from the UM 0865 Câmpina military base, and were summoned there by General Ion Rus, commander of the Romanian Air Force. The confrontation resulted in the deaths of 40 soldiers, as well as eight civilians. The military trucks were allowed entrance into the airport&#x27;s perimeter, passing several checkpoints. However, after passing the last checkpoint, they were fired upon from different directions. A civilian bus was also fired upon during the firefight. After the firefight, the surviving soldiers were taken prisoner by the troops guarding the airport, who seemed to think that they were loyal to Ceaușescu&#x27;s regime.

===Fighting and continued violence===
There has yet to be any academic evidence for the idea that there were significant forces considered loyal to the old regime. Rather, the continued fighting which was seen after the flight of Ceaușescu is believed to have been a result of mistaken exchanges of fire from the general population and armed forces. There has been no academic evidence to suggest that Securitate units fought against the revolution. The origins of this story can be found in the speech given on 22 December by Army Captain Mihail Lupoi. During this speech, he asserts that it was only the Securitate who had shot protesters before the 22nd and that the Securitate needs to come onto the side of the army. This placed the deaths of protesters by the army onto the shoulders of the Securitate. But both the army and Securitate had shot and killed protesters before the 22nd.

The vast majority of deaths came from the period between 22 and 25 December. On the 22nd, a small group of individuals which would later comprise the core of the National Salvation Front (, FSN), called for a mass mobilisation of people for the defence of the television station. This call to arms resulted in the accumulation of army personnel, patriotic guards (both in and out of uniform) and armed civilians guarding the station. Later the same evening, there was an announcement that a convoy of anti-terrorist units were heading for the television centre. This wasn&#x27;t so, but it added to the extremely tense environment which had been building since the flight of Ceaușescu.

When gunfights finally erupted outside and around the television studio, they were almost always the result of miscommunication. One such example is when a group of Patriotic Guardsmen took up a defensive position in a building close to the television centre on the 23rd. It has not been established who took the first shots at around 17:00, but a gunfight soon ensued with those in the television station returning fire onto the position of the Patriotic guards, according to an aid worker who had set up a first aid station at the side of the television station, and who said that, afterwards, the group of Patriotic Guardsmen would later deny that they had fired first. This is only one of many examples of gunfights between pro-revolution forces after the flight of Ceaușescu on the 22nd.

Scenes of major gunfights during this period include the television, radio and telephone buildings, as well as Casa Scânteii (the nation&#x27;s print media center, which serves a similar role today under the name of the &quot;House of the Free Press&quot;, ) and the post office in the district of Drumul Taberei; Palace Square (site of the Central Committee building, but also of the Central University Library, the national art museum in the former Royal Palace, and the Ateneul Român (Romanian Athenaeum), Bucharest&#x27;s leading concert hall); the university and the adjoining University Square (one of the city&#x27;s main intersections); Otopeni and Băneasa airports; hospitals; and the Ministry of Defence.

During the night of 22–23 December, Bucharest residents remained on the streets, especially in areas under attack, fighting (and ultimately winning, at the cost of many lives) a battle with an elusive and dangerous enemy. With the military confused by contradictory orders, actual battles ensued, with many real casualties. At 21:00 on 23 December, tanks and a few paramilitary units arrived to protect the Palace of the Republic.

Meanwhile, messages of support were flooding in from all over the world: France (President François Mitterrand); the Soviet Union (General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev); Hungary (the Hungarian Socialist Party); the new East German government (at that time the two German states were not yet formally reunited); Bulgaria (Petar Mladenov, General Secretary of the Bulgarian Communist Party); Czechoslovakia (Ladislav Adamec, leader of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, and Václav Havel, the dissident writer, revolution leader and future president of the Republic); China (the Minister of Foreign Affairs); the United States (President George H. W. Bush); Canada (Prime Minister Brian Mulroney); West Germany (Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher); NATO (Secretary General Manfred Wörner); the United Kingdom (Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher); Spain; Austria; the Netherlands; Italy; Portugal; Japan (the Japanese Communist Party); SFR Yugoslavia government; and Moldavian SSR.

In the following days, moral support was followed by material support. Large quantities of food, medicine, clothing, medical equipment, and other humanitarian aid were sent to Romania. Around the world, the press dedicated entire pages and sometimes even complete issues to the Romanian revolution and its leaders.

On 24 December, Bucharest was still a city at war. Tanks, APCs and trucks continued to patrol the city and surround trouble spots in order to protect them. At intersections near strategic objectives, roadblocks were built; automatic gunfire continued in and around University Square, the Gara de Nord (the city&#x27;s main railroad station) and Palace Square. Yet amid the chaos, some people were seen clutching makeshift Christmas trees. Doctors at one Bucharest hospital reported not sleeping for days and treating as many as 3,000 civilians due to the fighting. &quot;Terrorist activities&quot; continued until 27 December, when they abruptly stopped. Nobody ever found out who conducted them, or who ordered them stopped. The Central University Library was burned down in uncertain circumstances and over 500,000 books, along with about 3,700 manuscripts, were destroyed.

===Casualties===
The total number of deaths in the Romanian revolution was 1,104, of which 162 were from the protests that led to the overthrow of Ceaușescu (16–22 December 1989) and 942 during the fighting that occurred after the seizure of power by the new FSN. The number of wounded was 3,352, of which 1,107 occurred while Ceaușescu was still in power and 2,245 after the FSN took power. Official figures place the death toll of the revolution at 689 people, many of whom were civilians.

Figures by FSN officials in January 1990 claimed that as many as 7,000 people died during four days of bitter street fighting in December.

==Aftermath==

===Political changes===
The revolution brought Romania vast attention from the outside world. Initially, much of the world&#x27;s sympathy went to the FSN government under Ion Iliescu, a former member of the CPR leadership and a Ceaușescu ally prior to falling into the dictator&#x27;s disfavour in the early 1980s. The FSN, composed mainly of former members of the second echelon of the CPR, immediately assumed control over the state institutions, including the main media outlets such as the national radio and television networks. They used their control of the media to launch attacks against their political opponents, newly created political parties that claimed to be successors to those existing before 1948. Around the same time, all Romanian numbers stations ceased transmitting, including a number station called &quot;Ciocârlia/The Skylark&quot;, also known as &quot;V01&quot; after the revolution.

Much of that sympathy was squandered during the Mineriads. Massive protests erupted in downtown Bucharest as political rallies organised by the opposition parties during the presidential elections, with a small part of the protesters deciding to stand ground even after Iliescu was re-elected with an overwhelming majority of 85%. Attempts by police to evacuate the remaining protesters resulted in attacks on state institutions, prompting Iliescu to appeal to the country&#x27;s workers for help. Infiltrated and instigated by former Securitate agents, in the following days a large mass of workers, mainly miners, entered Bucharest and attacked and fought with anti-government protesters and gathered bystanders.

On the eve of the first free post-communist elections day (20 May 1990), Silviu Brucan—who was part of the FSN—argued that the 1989 revolution was not anti-communist, being only against Ceaușescu. He stated that Ion Iliescu made a &quot;monumental&quot; mistake in &quot;conceding to the crowd&quot; and banning the PCR.

===Economic reforms===
The FSN had to choose between the two economic models that political elites claimed were available to post-Communist Eastern European countries: shock therapy or gradual reforms. The FSN chose the latter, slower reforms, because it would have not been possible to convince the people who were already &quot;exhausted&quot; after Ceaușescu&#x27;s austerity to undergo further sacrifices. Nevertheless, neoliberal reforms were implemented, although not all at once: by the end of 1990, prices were liberalised and a free currency exchange rate was implemented, devaluing the leu by 60%. The land of the state-owned collective farms was distributed to private owners and a list of 708 large state-owned enterprises to be privatised was devised.

In 1991 Romania signed an agreement with the IMF and began the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, with the first privatisation law being passed in 1991. In 1992, the Stolojan government began an austerity plan, limiting wages and further liberalising prices. The economic situation deteriorated and inflation as well as unemployment increased substantially. The austerity measures, which by 1995 included a decrease in social spending, led to an increase in poverty. The neoliberal reforms were accelerated after the Democratic Convention won the 1996 elections, the government using its prerogatives to pass a package of laws, removing subsidies, passing reforms on unemployment benefits and greatly increasing the number of privatised companies.

=== Competing narratives ===
In the years immediately following the revolution, narratives applied both by Romanians and the international audience competed for an interpretation of the events of 1989. Within Romania, myths interpreting it as &quot;false&quot; or &quot;stolen&quot; by the FSN correlated to one&#x27;s level of disagreement with the political organization, while those painting the events as a pure, &quot;spontaneous revolution&quot; largely aligned with support for the FSN. In addition, the FSN itself attempted to construct its own narrative of the revolution, with its leaders placed abruptly at the center by popular will. This interpretation was largely challenged by FSN opponents.

Outside Romania, public audiences in Western Europe initially projected generally idealistic notions of revolution on the country; the legacies of the French Revolution were fresh on people&#x27;s minds in 1989 during its two-hundredth anniversary. However, as violence continued into 1990 and reports reached the West of mass casualties, this projected narrative shifted into a less sympathetic one characterized by disappointment in and suspicion of the revolution&#x27;s direction.

<text>USS &quot;Evarts&quot; (DE-5) was the lead ship of her class of destroyer escorts in the United States Navy.

==Namesake==
Milo Burnell Evarts was born on 3 September 1913 in Ruthton, Minnesota. He enlisted in the Naval Reserve on 31 August 1940, and was commissioned on 12 June 1941 as ensign. On the night of 11–12 October 1942, in the Battle of Cape Esperance, Lieutenant (junior grade) Evarts was killed in action when his ship was damaged. Disregarding the danger of explosion from the fires which broke out in the gun turret of which he was in charge, Evarts stood to his station until killed. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Evarts&quot; was launched on 7 December 1942 at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, as BDE-5, intended for transfer to Britain. Instead, she was retained for use in the U.S. Navy, and commissioned on 15 April 1943.

==Service history==
After anti-submarine warfare training and experiments with radar in Chesapeake Bay, &quot;Evarts&quot; began steady service as a convoy escort, during much of which she flew the flag of Commander, Escort Division 5 (CortDiv 5). After five voyages to Casablanca, she sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, on 22 April 1944 on her first run to Bizerte. Two days before reaching that port, her convoy came under heavy attack by enemy torpedo bombers, and &quot;Evarts&quot; joined in the protective anti-aircraft barrage which shot down many of the attackers.

During the homeward bound passage of this same voyage, on 29 May, &quot;Evarts&quot; was detached from the convoy to aid the escort carrier and destroyer escort , both of whom had been torpedoed by a German submarine. She arrived at the given position to find &quot;Block Island&quot; had sunk, but screened &quot;Barr&quot;, under tow, to safety at Casablanca. A second voyage to Bizerte was uneventful, as were the one to Palermo and the three to Oran which followed.

Completing her convoy escort duties on 11 June 1945, &quot;Evarts&quot; acted as target in exercises with submarines at New London, Connecticut, until arriving at New York on 11 September. There she was decommissioned on 2 October 1945, and was scrapped starting on 12 July 1946.

==Awards==
&quot;Evarts&quot; also received one battle star for her World War II service.

<text>Zhao Tingting (; born 28 November 1982) is a Chinese badminton player from Nantong, Jiangsu.

==Career==
A doubles specialist, Zhao has often been a &quot;utility player&quot; on China&#x27;s national team, winning international tournaments with a variety of compatriots who typically partner someone else. She has won women&#x27;s doubles at the Denmark (2002, 2004) and Thailand (2003) Opens with Wei Yili; the French (2002), China (2008), and Hong Kong (2008) Opens with Zhang Yawen; the Swiss Open (2007) and Asian Championships (2007) with Yang Wei; and at the China Open (2007) with Gao Ling. She has also captured mixed doubles titles at the Thailand (2003) and Denmark (2004) Opens with Chen Qiqiu, and at the Hong Kong Open (2006) with Zheng Bo.

Zhao was a women&#x27;s doubles silver medalist with Wei Yili at the 2003 IBF World Championships in Birmingham, England, dropping the final to compatriots Gao Ling and Huang Sui, and a mixed doubles bronze medalist with Chen Qiqiu at the same tournament. At the 2004 Olympics in Athens she just missed a medal by finishing fourth in women&#x27;s doubles with Wei Yili and losing in the quarterfinals of mixed doubles with Chen Qiqiu. Zhao was not selected to compete in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a victim of China&#x27;s great depth in women&#x27;s badminton and rules that limit the number of Olympic entries from any one country. However, 2009 proved to be her most successful year as Zhao won both the prestigious All-England and BWF World Championships in women&#x27;s doubles with Zhang Yawen. With these achievements, she reportedly retired from the Chinese team at the end of the 2009 season.
