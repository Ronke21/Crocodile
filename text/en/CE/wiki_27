<text>David Josiah Brewer (June 20, 1837 – March 28, 1910) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1890 to 1910. An appointee of President Benjamin Harrison, he supported states&#x27; rights, opposed broad interpretations of Congress&#x27;s power to regulate interstate commerce, and voted to strike down economic regulations that he felt infringed on the freedom of contract. He and Justice Rufus W. Peckham were the &quot;intellectual leaders&quot; of the Fuller Court, according to the legal academic Owen M. Fiss. Brewer has been viewed negatively by most scholars, though a few have argued that his reputation as a reactionary deserves to be reconsidered.

Born in Smyrna (modern-day İzmir, Turkey) to Congregationalist missionaries, Brewer attended Wesleyan University, Yale University, and Albany Law School. He headed west and settled in Leavenworth, Kansas, where he practiced law. Brewer was elected to a county judgeship in 1862; he later served as judge of Kansas&#x27;s First Judicial District and as the county attorney for Leavenworth County. In 1870, he was elected to the Kansas Supreme Court, where he served for fourteen years, participating in decisions on segregation, property rights, women&#x27;s rights, and other issues. President Chester A. Arthur appointed him as a federal circuit judge in 1884. When Justice Stanley Matthews of the Supreme Court of the United States died in 1889, President Benjamin Harrison nominated Brewer to succeed him. Despite some objections from prohibitionists, the U.S. Senate voted 53–11 to confirm Brewer, and he took the oath of office on January 6, 1890.

Brewer opposed governmental interference in the free market and rejected the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; (1877), which had upheld the states&#x27; power to regulate businesses, writing: &quot;The paternal theory of government is to me odious.&quot; He joined the majority in decisions such as &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), in which the Court invoked the doctrine of substantive due process to strike down a New York labor law. Brewer was not uniformly hostile to regulations, however; his majority opinion in &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot; (1908) sustained an Oregon law that set maximum working hours for female laborers. He joined the majority to strike down the federal income tax in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), and, writing for the Court in the case of &quot;In re Debs&quot; (1895), he expanded the judiciary&#x27;s equitable authority by upholding an injunction against the organizers of a strike. He favored a narrow interpretation of the Sherman Antitrust Act in &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot; (1895), but he cast the deciding vote in &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot; (1904) to block a corporate merger on antitrust grounds.

Brewer generally ruled against African-Americans in civil rights cases, although he consistently voted in favor of Chinese immigrants. He opposed imperialism and, in the Insular Cases, rejected the idea that the Constitution did not apply in full to the territories. His majority opinion in &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot; (1892) contained a frequently criticized claim that the United States &quot;is a Christian nation&quot;. Off the bench, he was a prolific public speaker who decried Progressive reforms and criticized President Theodore Roosevelt; he also advocated for peace and served on an arbitral commission that resolved a boundary dispute between Venezuela and the United Kingdom. He remained on the Supreme Court until his death in 1910.

==Early life==

David Josiah Brewer was born on June 20, 1837, in Smyrna (modern-day İzmir, Turkey), which was at the time a part of the Ottoman Empire. He was the fourth child of Josiah Brewer, a Massachusetts-born Congregationalist missionary to the Mediterranean, and his wife Emilia A. Field, a member of the prominent Field family whose brothers included David Dudley Field (a well-known attorney), Stephen J. Field (a justice of the U.S. Supreme Court), Cyrus W. Field (who developed the trans-Atlantic cable), and Henry M. Field (a clergyman). The family returned to the United States in 1838; the elder Brewer pastored several congregations in New England and served as the chaplain of a Connecticut state penitentiary.

When Brewer was fifteen years old, he enrolled at Wesleyan University in Connecticut. At Wesleyan, he joined the Peithologian literary society and a group known as the Mystical Seven. Brewer transferred to Yale two years later; he took classes in political philosophy, the U.S. Constitution, Hebrew, mathematics, theology, and other topics. His classmates included Henry Billings Brown, who later served with him on the Supreme Court, and Chauncey Depew, a future senator. Brewer expressed interest in politics during his college years, and he wrote numerous forceful letters to the editor, including a fiery denunciation of the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Dred Scott&quot; decision. One Yale classmate recalled that the future justice had a reputation for &quot;jumping up on the slightest provocation to make a speech, especially on political lines&quot;. Brewer graduated from Yale in 1856, receiving an A.B. degree with honors.

Upon his graduation, Brewer moved to New York City, where he read law in the office of his uncle David Dudley Field. After a year, he enrolled at Albany Law School, from which he received an LL.B. degree in 1858. Brewer pondered whether to remain in New York with his uncle David or to move to California to work with his uncle Stephen, but he eventually rejected both options, declaring: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to grow up to be my uncle&#x27;s nephew.&quot; He moved to Kansas City, Missouri; after practicing law there for a few months, he joined the Pike&#x27;s Peak gold rush and headed west in search of fortune. Having found no gold, he settled in Leavenworth, Kansas Territory, a city of about ten thousand that was both a center of regional commerce and the home of several notable figures in Kansas&#x27;s legal community.

==Career==
After a short period of work at a law firm in Leavenworth, Brewer began a legal practice of his own with a partner. In 1861, he was appointed commissioner of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Kansas, an administrative position in which he issued warrants and completed paperwork. He continued to practice law, and he served as a second lieutenant in the &quot;Lane Rifles,&quot; a Union Home Guard, during the Civil War. In 1862, after unsuccessfully seeking the Republican nomination for a seat in the state legislature, he hesitantly accepted a nomination to be the party&#x27;s candidate for judge of Leavenworth County&#x27;s criminal and probate courts. Although he was only twenty-five years old, he won the election. As a judge, Brewer punished criminals harshly; despite his inexperience, he quickly gained a reputation as a competent jurist. Having been urged by several local attorneys to run, Brewer sought and won election in 1864 as judge of the First Judicial District of Kansas, which encompassed Leavenworth and Wyandotte counties. In that position, he held a general in contempt of court and ruled that a man who was one-quarter black had the right to vote. Brewer was elected county attorney in 1868, serving until 1870; he also resumed the private practice of law.

=== Kansas Supreme Court (1870–1884) ===
In 1870, the state&#x27;s Republicans unexpectedly nominated Brewer instead of incumbent Justice Jacob Safford for a seat on the Kansas Supreme Court. In the heavily Republican state, Brewer won the general election handily; he was easily reelected in 1876 and 1882. According to Brian J. Moline, his opinions on the state Supreme Court, &quot;while well within the conventions of the time, exhibit an individualistic, even progressive, instinct&quot;. In a landmark women&#x27;s rights decision in &quot;Wright v. Noell&quot;, he ruled in favor of a woman who had been elected to serve as county superintendent of public instruction, reversing a lower court&#x27;s holding that she was ineligible to serve. Brewer rendered rulings that were sympathetic to Native Americans, and he emphasized the best interests of the child in child custody cases.

In &quot;Board of Education v. Tinnon&quot;, Brewer dissented when the court held that the city of Ottawa, Kansas, could not lawfully segregate its schools. Justice Daniel M. Valentine&#x27;s opinion for a 2–1 majority concluded that local school boards had no authority beyond the powers expressly given to them by state law; since state law did not expressly authorize school boards to create separate schools for blacks and whites, he determined that segregation in Ottawa was not permissible. In what the law professor Andrew Kull characterized as an &quot;angry dissent&quot;, Brewer disagreed. He maintained that school boards could act without explicit authorization from the legislature, and he also argued that racial segregation did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, writing that &quot;each State has the power to classify school children by color, sex, or otherwise, as to its legislature shall seem wisest and best&quot;. In his biography of Brewer, the historian Michael J. Brodhead maintained that the justice&#x27;s reasoning was &quot;not overtly racist&quot; and rested instead on his longstanding support for local self-governance; the legal scholar Arnold M. Paul, by contrast, argued that the opinion exhibited &quot;an insensitivity to social problems... combined with a simplistic legal formalism&quot;.

According to Paul, cases in the 1880s involving Kansas&#x27;s prohibition of alcohol &quot;mark the decisive turning points in Brewer&#x27;s shift to hard-line conservatism&quot;. In &quot;State v. Mugler&quot;, a brewer challenged a state law that forbade the manufacture of beer, arguing that it deprived him of his property without due process of law. The court ruled against him on the basis that the law fell within the state&#x27;s police power. Although Brewer did not formally dissent, he expressed his reservations about the majority&#x27;s conclusions, suggesting that the law in effect deprived the brewer of his property without just compensation. (Mugler appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but in &quot;Mugler v. Kansas&quot;, it ruled that the prohibition law was constitutional.) Brewer&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Mugler&quot; presaged the protective attitude toward property rights that he later displayed on the U.S. Supreme Court.

=== Eighth Circuit (1884–1889) ===
When Judge John F. Dillon resigned in 1879, several state officials encouraged President Rutherford B. Hayes to nominate Brewer to the ensuing vacancy on the federal circuit court for the Eighth Circuit. George W. McCrary was appointed instead, but when McCrary resigned in 1884, President Chester A. Arthur nominated Brewer to take his place. Brewer characterized the Eighth Circuit as &quot;an empire in itself&quot;: it encompassed Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, and Nebraska, to which North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming were added several years after his appointment. As a circuit judge, he heard a wide variety of cases, including federal civil disputes, matters arising under the court&#x27;s diversity jurisdiction, and the occasional criminal prosecution. Most cases were under the circuit court&#x27;s original jurisdiction, although Brewer heard a few appeals from federal district courts.

In &quot;Chicago &amp; N.W. Railway Co. v. Dey&quot;, a railroad company argued that the rates set by the Iowa Railroad Commission were unreasonable and should be enjoined. Despite the Supreme Court&#x27;s 1877 decision in &quot;Munn v. Illinois&quot; that legislatures had the authority to determine whether rates were reasonable, Brewer ruled in the railroad&#x27;s favor, issuing a preliminary injunction on the grounds that it was unlawful to impose rates that did not adequately compensate the company. Paul argued that the decision was squarely at odds with &quot;Munn&quot;, although Brodhead maintained that such claims are &quot;at the very least misleading&quot; since Brewer later lauded the commission and upheld the rates. In &quot;State v. Walruff&quot;, Brewer firmly reiterated the position that he had expressed in &quot;Mugler&quot;, appealing to &quot;the guarantees of safety and protection to private property&quot; to rule that the Fourteenth Amendment required Kansas to compensate beer manufacturers affected by prohibition laws. Citing &quot;Walruff&quot; and other cases, Paul commented that the future justice&#x27;s &quot;growing conservatism&quot; was evident during this period.

== Supreme Court nomination ==

Justice Stanley Matthews&#x27;s death in March 1889 created a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court for President Benjamin Harrison to fill. It took Harrison nearly nine months to select a nominee, during which time he considered forty candidates. Politicians from Matthews&#x27;s home state of Ohio, including Governor Joseph Foraker, urged him to appoint the prominent Cincinnati attorney Thomas McDougall; after McDougall declined to be considered, Foraker lent his support to William Howard Taft, who was then a municipal judge in Cincinnati. Other candidates suggested to Harrison included the Detroit attorney Alfred Russell, whom Vice President Levi P. Morton endorsed, and McCrary, who was favored by many Midwestern politicians and jurists. Harrison eventually narrowed the field to two candidates, both of whom were conservative Republicans from the Midwest: Brewer—who had the vigorous support of Senator Preston B. Plumb of Kansas and Chief Justice Albert H. Horton of the Kansas Supreme Court—and Henry Billings Brown, a federal judge from Michigan who was endorsed by several of that state&#x27;s prominent political figures. During the selection process, a letter came to Harrison&#x27;s attention in which Brewer suggested that Brown—his friend and former classmate at Yale—should be appointed instead of him. Harrison was reputedly so impressed by Brewer&#x27;s unselfishness that he decided to nominate him to the Court.

Harrison announced his selection of the surprised Brewer on December 4, 1889, sending the nomination to the Senate. Prohibitionists, maintaining that Brewer&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Walruff&quot; was &quot;conclusive proof of what we already fear—the total surrender to the liquor dealers of the country&quot;, expressed opposition, but the selection was otherwise viewed favorably. The Senate Judiciary Committee, chaired by George F. Edmunds, considered the nomination for a week, longer than usual; despite some criticism, its members endorsed Brewer&#x27;s nomination. The full Senate, in a secret session that &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized as &quot;absurd&quot;, heard prolonged speeches from several members who opposed the nominee on the grounds that he was hostile to prohibition or partial toward the railroad interests. Brewer was confirmed on December 18, 1889, by a vote of 53–11, and he took the oath of office on January 6, 1890.

== Supreme Court (1890–1910) ==

Brewer remained on the Court for twenty years, serving until his death in 1910. In the 4,430 cases in which he participated, he wrote 539 majority or plurality opinions, 65 dissenting opinions, and 14 concurring opinions. Melville Fuller was chief justice throughout Brewer&#x27;s tenure; the Fuller Court has been described as mainly loyal to business interests and laissez-faire economic principles, although late-twentieth-century revisionist scholars have rejected that narrative. Brewer has often been described as an extremely conservative justice. According to Paul, he &quot;held to a strictly conservative, sometimes reactionary, position on the Court, opposing firmly the expansion of government regulatory power, state or federal&quot; and making &quot;little pretense of &#x27;judicial self-restraint&#x27; and few compromises to Court consensus&quot;. Some scholars argued in the 1990s that Brewer&#x27;s jurisprudence was less extreme than generally thought, contending that his reputation as a reactionary was based largely on a small and unrepresentative sample of his comments and opinions. While accepting that &quot;Brewer can fairly be labeled a conservative&quot;, the legal scholar J. Gordon Hylton wrote in 1994 that &quot;to say that he was a self-conscious defender of the interests of corporate America or an enthusiastic disciple of laissez-faire is both unfair and inaccurate&quot;.

Brewer held an activist conception of the judicial role. His constitutional views were shaped by his religious beliefs, and he emphasized natural justice in his written opinions. According to the legal scholar Owen M. Fiss, Brewer and his &quot;constant ally&quot; Rufus W. Peckham were the &quot;intellectual leaders&quot; of the Fuller Court—justices who, while not always in the majority, were &quot;influential within the dominant coalition and the source of the ideas that gave the Court its sweep and direction&quot;. Brewer&#x27;s views were also aligned with those of his uncle—Justice Stephen J. Field—a staunch defender of property rights with whom he served for eight years. Brewer supported states&#x27; rights and felt that the judiciary should limit governmental actions that interfere with the free market, although the legal historian Kermit L. Hall writes that his jurisprudence &quot;was not altogether predictable&quot; because &quot;[h]is Congregational, missionary, and anti-slavery roots&quot; gave him &quot;a sympathetic ear for the disadvantaged&quot;.

=== Substantive due process ===

Brewer and his fellow conservative justices led the Court toward rulings that interpreted the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments broadly to protect property rights from various regulations. Three months after his appointment, he joined the majority in &quot;Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota&quot;, a case in which the Court struck down the railroad rates set by a Minnesota commission. The decision, which endorsed the idea that the Due Process Clause contained a substantive component that limited state regulatory authority, was at odds with the Court&#x27;s holding in &quot;Munn&quot; that rate-setting was a matter for legislators, not judges, to decide. Strenuously dissenting in &quot;Budd v. New York&quot;, Brewer derided &quot;Munn&quot; as &quot;radically unsound&quot; and, using a phrase that according to Brodhead &quot;has ever since linked his name to opposition to reform&quot;, wrote: &quot;The paternal theory of government is to me odious.&quot; His opinion for a unanimous Court in &quot;Reagan v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; built on the &quot;Chicago, Milwaukee&quot; decision, curtailing &quot;Munn&quot; and asserting that the judiciary could review the reasonableness of railroad rates. He joined the majority in &quot;Allgeyer v. Louisiana&quot;, the first case to deploy the liberty of contract doctrine; the decision held that the Due Process Clause protected the right to make contracts.

The era of substantive due process reached its zenith in the 1905 case of &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot;. &quot;Lochner&quot; involved a New York law that capped hours for bakery workers at sixty hours a week. In a decision widely viewed to be among the Supreme Court&#x27;s worst, a five-justice majority held the law to be unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause. Brewer joined the Court&#x27;s opinion, which was written by Peckham; it maintained that due process included a right to enter labor contracts without being subject to unreasonable governmental regulation. Peckham rejected the state&#x27;s argument that the law was intended to protect workers&#x27; health, citing the &quot;common understanding&quot; that baking was not unhealthy. He maintained that bakers could protect their own health, arguing that the law was in fact a labor regulation in disguise. The decision provoked a now-famous dissent from Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., who accused the majority of substituting its own economic preferences for the requirements of the Constitution. Brewer voted to strike down labor laws in other cases, such as &quot;Holden v. Hardy&quot;, which involved a maximum-hour law for miners, and &quot;Adair v. United States&quot;, which voided a federal law against yellow-dog contracts.

According to Hylton, the common view that Brewer uniformly opposed regulations is inaccurate.Maintaining that &quot;Brewer&#x27;s bark proved to be worse than his bite&quot;, he observes that the justice voted to uphold state regulatory action in nearly eighty percent of cases. When an Oregon law that kept female employees of factories and laundries from working more than ten hours a day was challenged in the 1908 case of &quot;Muller v. Oregon&quot;, Brewer wrote the Court&#x27;s unanimous opinion upholding it. He favorably cited an extensive brief filed by Louis Brandeis (the Brandeis brief) that, using statistics and other evidence, argued that the law was appropriate as a matter of public policy. In an opinion that has been condemned as patronizing toward women, Brewer argued that Oregon&#x27;s law was different from the one at issue in &quot;Lochner&quot; because female workers were in special need of protection due to their &quot;physical structure and the performance of maternal functions&quot;, which put them &quot;at a disadvantage in the struggle for subsistence&quot;. In other cases, he voted to uphold labor regulations involving seamen and those performing hazardous work, and he disfavored attempts to invoke the freedom-of-contract doctrine in cases that did not pertain to employment. Addressing the justice&#x27;s reasons for upholding some regulations while invalidating others, Hylton comments that &quot;Brewer &#x27;knew an unconstitutional use of the police power when he saw one&#x27;, but he was never able to define precisely what made it so&quot;.

=== Federal power ===

==== Taxation ====

Brewer joined the majority in the case of &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot;, a decision that, according to Brodhead, &quot;contributed much to [the Fuller Court&#x27;s] reputation for favoritism toward corporate and other forms of wealth&quot;. &quot;Pollock&quot; involved a provision of the Wilson–Gorman Tariff Act of 1894 that levied a two-percent tax on incomes and corporate profits that exceeded $4000 a year. Its challengers took the tax to court, where they argued that it was a direct tax that had not been apportioned evenly among the states, in violation of a provision of the Constitution. The Supreme Court, which had only eight members at the time because Justice Howell Edmunds Jackson was ill, initially split four-to-four on the tax&#x27;s constitutionality. After Jackson returned to Washington, the justices reheard the case and, in an opinion by Fuller, struck down the tax by a 5–4 vote. (Jackson ended up dissenting, meaning that a justice switched his position; scholars have suggested a number of possible explanations, but Brodhead concludes that Brewer was unlikely to have changed his vote.) The &quot;Pollock&quot; decision, which was in effect overruled by the Sixteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, has conventionally been condemned as unfaithful to precedent, at odds with public opinion, and protective of the interests of the rich. In two cases—&quot;Magoun v. Illinois Trust and Savings Bank&quot; and &quot;Knowlton v. Moore&quot;—in which the Court upheld graduated inheritance taxes by votes of 8–1 and 7–1, respectively, Brewer was the sole dissenter.

==== Interstate commerce ====
Brewer was generally hesitant to interpret the federal government&#x27;s power to regulate interstate commerce expansively. He dissented in &quot;Champion v. Ames&quot;, a case in which the Court sustained a federal law that forbade the interstate transportation of lottery tickets. He joined an opinion by Fuller, who argued that the majority was disturbing the balance between states and the federal government by effectively giving the latter a general police power. In &quot;United States v. E. C. Knight Co.&quot;, Brewer joined Fuller&#x27;s opinion for an 8–1 majority holding that the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 did not forbid manufacturing monopolies because manufacturing was not commerce. The decision limited the Sherman Act&#x27;s scope, provoking a dissent from Harlan and complaints that the Court was endeavoring to protect big business from regulation.

Nonetheless, Brewer was not uniformly deferential to the interests of business. In &quot;Northern Securities Co. v. United States&quot;, he cast the deciding vote to block a merger between James J. Hill and J. P. Morgan, two of the era&#x27;s leading corporate barons. In a brief concurrence that according to the legal scholar John E. Semonche &quot;illustrates his integrity, competence, and sophistication&quot; better than any of his other opinions, Brewer expressed support for property rights but concluded that the proposed merger was an unlawful attempt to suppress competition. His opinion endorsed the rule of reason—the idea, later accepted by his colleagues, that the Sherman Act outlawed only unreasonable restraints on commerce. Brewer joined the majority in other decisions that applied the antitrust laws more broadly, including &quot;United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association&quot; and &quot;Addyston Pipe &amp; Steel Co. v. United States&quot;.

==== &quot;In re Debs&quot; ====

In the well-known case of &quot;In re Debs&quot;, Brewer&#x27;s opinion for the Court &quot;open[ed] the door for more extensive use of injunctive power by the government&quot;, according to the legal scholar James W. Ely. After members of the American Railway Union went on strike in 1894 against the Pullman Palace Car Company, the federal government sought an injunction against the union&#x27;s leaders, arguing that the strike interfered with the delivery of mail. A federal court issued the injunction and, when Eugene V. Debs and other union officials ignored it, held them in contempt of court. Having been fined and imprisoned, they sought relief before the Supreme Court on the grounds that the court had no authority to issue the injunction. Brewer, writing for a unanimous Court, disagreed. He wrote that the executive branch had the power &quot;to brush away all obstructions&quot; to interstate commerce by force if necessary and concluded that an injunction could lawfully be issued to suppress a public nuisance. Brewer was, according to the legal historian Edward A. Purcell Jr., an &quot;impassioned advocate of judicial power&quot;, and the ruling in &quot;Debs&quot; expanded the federal judiciary&#x27;s equitable authority. The public generally approved of the decision, although it was deplored by organized labor and, together with the contemporaneous rulings in &quot;Pollock&quot; and &quot;Knight&quot;, provoked charges that the Court was biased toward the wealthy.

=== &quot;A Christian nation&quot;: &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot; ===

One of Brewer&#x27;s best-known opinions came in &quot;Church of the Holy Trinity v. United States&quot;. The case arose when the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church hired E. Walpole Warren, a British clergyman, to be the church&#x27;s rector. The church was fined $1000 for violating the Alien Contract Labor Act of 1885, under which it was &quot;unlawful for any person, company, partnership, or corporation... to prepay the transportation, or in any way assist or encourage the importation or migration of any alien... under contract... to perform labor or service of any kind in the United States&quot;. The statute did not exempt members of the clergy, and according to Semonche &quot;the words were clear and the application logically unassailable&quot;. Yet in an opinion by Brewer, the Court unanimously reversed the conviction. Writing that &quot;if a literal construction of the words of a statute be absurd, the act must be so construed as to avoid the absurdity&quot;, Brewer reasoned that the law was clearly intended to forbid the importation of unskilled laborers rather than ministers. The case&#x27;s emphasis on Congress&#x27;s intent over the statute&#x27;s text marked a turning point in the Court&#x27;s treatment of legislative history, and the approach it represents has drawn substantial criticism from jurists such as Antonin Scalia, who described the decision as a &quot;prototypical&quot; example of how statutes ought not to be interpreted.

Brewer&#x27;s opinion in &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; also contained a statement that, according to the legal scholar William M. Wiecek, &quot;would be unthinkable today&quot; from a Supreme Court justice: that the United States &quot;is a Christian nation&quot;. He cited religious elements of historical documents, court decisions, and &quot;American life as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs and its society&quot; in support of his thesis that Congress could not have intended to bar clergymen from the country. The decision came during an era in which the idea that America was a Protestant country was not particularly controversial, and few objected to Brewer&#x27;s comments at the time. But legal scholars and later justices have heavily criticized the &quot;Christian nation&quot; claim: for instance, Justice William J. Brennan decried the declaration as &quot;arrogant[]&quot; in a 1984 dissent. Wiecek suggests that, while Brewer was a deeply religious man who favored Christian influence on American culture, the &quot;Christian nation&quot; statement was &quot;a descriptive judgment, not a normative one&quot; and was not of great importance as a matter of law.

=== Race ===
Like most of his colleagues, Brewer rarely sided with African-Americans in civil rights cases. Writing for the Court in &quot;Berea College v. Kentucky&quot;, for instance, he upheld a law that forbade schools from racially integrating their classes. Berea College had invoked &quot;Lochner&quot; to maintain that the statute infringed on its right to practice an occupation without unreasonable interference by the government. In an opinion that stood in conspicuous conflict with his ordinary support for property rights, Brewer (over Harlan&#x27;s dissent) rejected that argument, concluding that states had the ability to amend corporate charters. His majority opinion in &quot;Hodges v. United States&quot; held that the federal government had no authority to prosecute a group of Arkansas whites who had driven blacks away from their jobs. He interpreted federal laws against peonage narrowly in &quot;Clyatt v. United States&quot; and struck down a provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1870 in &quot;James v. Bowman.&quot; Of the twenty-nine cases involving African-Americans&#x27; civil rights in which he participated, he ruled in their favor only six times. Although Brewer did not cast a vote in the landmark case of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;—he had returned home to Kansas due to the death of his daughter—Paul states that he undoubtedly would have joined the majority opinion upholding &quot;separate but equal&quot; segregation laws had he been present.

=== Citizenship, immigration, and the territories ===
Brewer &quot;passionately protested the treatment of the Chinese, on both procedural and substantive grounds&quot;, according to Fiss. In &quot;Fong Yue Ting v. United States&quot;, he vigorously dissented when the Court ruled that Chinese non-citizens could be deported without being provided with due process, decrying the majority&#x27;s understanding of the federal government&#x27;s powers as &quot;indefinite and dangerous&quot;. A displeased Brewer dissented in both &quot;United States v. Sing Tuck&quot; and &quot;United States v. Ju Toy&quot;, immigration cases in which the majority declined to review the decisions of administrative officials; in &quot;Sing Tuck&quot;, he wrote: &quot;I cannot believe that the courts of this republic are so burdened with controversies about property that they cannot take time to determine the right of personal liberty by one claiming to be a citizen.&quot; He joined the majority when the Court held in &quot;United States v. Wong Kim Ark&quot; that all persons born on U.S. soil are American citizens, and he dissented when a majority in &quot;Yamataya v. Fisher&quot; rebuffed a Japanese deportee&#x27;s due process claim. Although the Court as a whole sided with Asians in only 6 out of the 23 cases decided during his tenure, Brewer voted in their favor 18 times. Brodhead suggests that the justice, a lifelong advocate of Christian efforts to evangelize the world, may have felt that treating the Chinese compassionately would further the missionary cause.

In the Insular Cases (a group of decisions on whether constitutional protections applied to those living in the territories that the United States acquired after the Spanish–American War), Brewer opposed Justice Edward Douglass White&#x27;s doctrine of incorporation—the idea that the Constitution did not fully apply to Guam, Hawaii, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico because they had not been &quot;incorporated&quot; by Congress. He joined the majority in &quot;DeLima v. Bidwell&quot;, a case in which the Court held by a 5–4 vote that Puerto Rico was not a foreign country under federal tariff law. In another Insular Case, &quot;Downes v. Bidwell&quot;, Brewer joined Fuller&#x27;s dissent when the Court upheld a provision of the Foraker Act that imposed an otherwise-unconstitutional tariff on Puerto Rico. In that dissent, the Chief Justice accepted that the federal government had the ability to obtain new territories but contended that the Constitution limited its sovereignty over them. Although Brewer did not write an opinion in any of the Insular Cases, he held strong views on the matters they presented: he opposed imperialism in public remarks and wrote a letter to Fuller urging him to &quot;stay on the court till we overthrow this unconstitutional idea of colonial supreme control&quot;.

=== Extrajudicial activities ===

According to the historian Linda Przybyszewski, Brewer was &quot;probably the most widely read jurist in the United States at the turn of the twentieth century&quot; due to what Justice Holmes characterized as his &quot;itch for public speaking&quot;. He spoke prolifically on various issues, often drawing criticism from his colleagues for his frankness. The topic about which he spoke most fervently was peace: in his public addresses he decried imperialism, arms buildups, and the horrors of war. He supported the peaceable resolution of international disputes via arbitration, and he served with Fuller on the arbitral tribunal that resolved a boundary dispute between Venezuela and the United Kingdom. Brewer was not an unqualified pacifist, but Brodhead writes that he &quot;was a tireless, dedicated, and eloquent advocate of peace and among the most visible and vocal critics of militarism in his time&quot;. He also expressed support for education, charities, and the rights of women and ethnic minorities. Many of Brewer&#x27;s speeches were later published in print; he also edited ten-volume collections of &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Essays&quot; and &quot;The World&#x27;s Best Orations&quot; and co-authored with Charles Henry Butler a brief treatise on international law. In his later years, he spoke increasingly on political topics: he decried Progressive reforms and inveighed against President Theodore Roosevelt, who in turn loathed Brewer and stated in private that he had &quot;a sweetbread for a brain&quot; and was a &quot;menace to the welfare of the Nation&quot;.

== Personal life and death ==
Brewer adhered to a liberal form of Congregationalism, focusing on Jesus&#x27;s ethical teachings and God&#x27;s love for humankind instead of sin, hell, and theological principles more generally. He attended church all his life and taught Sunday school in Kansas and Washington, D.C. A firm supporter of missionary efforts, he was a member of the American Bible Society and the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. Brewer married Louise R. Landon, a native of Vermont, in 1861; they had four children. Louise died in 1898, and Brewer wed Emma Miner Mott three years afterward. Brewer&#x27;s hobbies included going to the theater, hunting, playing cards, reading detective stories, and vacationing at a cottage in Vermont on Lake Champlain. He was known as a friendly and patient man.

Brewer had planned to retire from the Court when he turned seventy in 1907, but he changed his mind, saying he was &quot;too young in spirit&quot; to retire. In 1909, President William Howard Taft characterized the Court&#x27;s state as &quot;pitiable&quot;, writing that Fuller was &quot;almost senile&quot;, that Harlan was doing &quot;no work&quot;, that Brewer was &quot;so deaf that he cannot hear&quot; and had &quot;got beyond the point of commonest accuracy in writing his opinions&quot;, and that Brewer and Harlan were sleeping during arguments. On March 28, 1910, Brewer, who had until then been in good health, experienced a massive stroke in his Washington, D.C., home and, before doctors could arrive, died. He was seventy-three years old. The U.S. Senate adjourned on March 29 out of respect for the justice, and Taft stated that he was an &quot;able judge&quot;. Brewer&#x27;s body was returned to Leavenworth, and a funeral was held at that city&#x27;s First Congregational Church; he was buried at the Mount Muncie Cemetery in nearby Lansing. Taft nominated Charles Evans Hughes to take his place.

== Legacy ==
&quot;History has not been kind to David Brewer&quot;, comments Fiss. He has faded into obscurity, in part because some of his colleagues—Field, Harlan, and Holmes—were figures of great prominence. Moreover, although public sentiment regarding the justice was mixed in the years following his death, he was almost never discussed favorably after the 1930s, being generally described as an ultra-conservative who adhered closely to laissez-faire principles and made the courts subservient to corporations. Although late-twentieth century revisionist scholarship took a less negative view of the Fuller Court as a whole, Brewer&#x27;s reputation did not rise: Hylton comments that &quot;[b]y advancing a more moderate interpretation of the Fuller Court as a body, some revisionist historians actually made Brewer seem even more of a reactionary figure than before&quot;. Nonetheless, a few scholarly voices, including Semonche, Brodhead, Hylton, and Purcell, have favored reevaluating the justice&#x27;s reputation. Brodhead concluded his 1994 biography of Brewer by writing that he &quot;deserves to be remembered as an important figure of a much misunderstood period in the judicial history of the United States&quot;.

<text>Antoine Varillas (1624 – 9 June 1696) was a French historian, best known for his history of heresy.

==Life==
He was born in Guéret and made a troubled way as a man of letters in Paris. He worked as a historian for Gaston, Duke of Orléans. Through an introduction from Pierre Dupuy, he was able to have library access, leading to work on manuscripts for Jean-Baptiste Colbert. Colbert, however, was dissatisfied with his work and replaced him. Varillas enjoyed support from Pierre Huet but became a marginal figure.

==Works==
His writings attracted a great deal of interest amongst his contemporaries; serious if partisan criticisms of the historical method of his earlier work led to his losing his reputation as a scholar. His works included:

*&quot;Histoire de l&#x27;heresie de Viclef, Iean Hus, et Jerome de Prague: avec celle des guerres de Bohéme qui en ont esté les suites&quot;;

<doc id="912171" wikidata="Q4228979" url="?curid=912171" title="Optical ring resonators">
<text>An optical ring resonator is a set of waveguides in which at least one is a closed loop coupled to some sort of light input and output. (These can be, but are not limited to being, waveguides.) The concepts behind optical ring resonators are the same as those behind whispering galleries except that they use light and obey the properties behind constructive interference and total internal reflection. When light of the resonant wavelength is passed through the loop from the input waveguide, the light builds up in intensity over multiple round-trips owing to constructive interference and is output to the output bus waveguide which serves as a detector waveguide. Because only a select few wavelengths will be at resonance within the loop, the optical ring resonator functions as a filter. Additionally, as implied earlier, two or more ring waveguides can be coupled to each other to form an add/drop optical filter.

== Background ==
Optical ring resonators work on the principles behind total internal reflection, constructive interference, and optical coupling.

=== Total internal reflection ===

The light travelling through the waveguides in an optical ring resonator remains within the waveguides due to the ray optics phenomenon known as total internal reflection (TIR). TIR is an optical phenomenon that occurs when a ray of light strikes the boundary of a medium and fails to refract through the boundary. Given that the angle of incidence is larger than the critical angle (with respect to the normal of the surface) and the refractive index is lower on the other side of the boundary relative to the incident ray, TIR will occur and no light will be able to pass through. For an optical ring resonator to work well, total internal reflection conditions must be met and the light travelling through the waveguides must not be allowed to escape by any means.

=== Interference ===

Interference is the process by which two waves superimpose to form a resultant wave of greater or less amplitude. Interference usually refers to the interaction of two distinct waves and it is a result of the linearity of Maxwell Equation. Interference could be constructive or destructive depending on the relative phase of the two waves. In constructive interference, the two waves have the same phase and, as a result, interfere in a way that the resulting wave amplitude will be equal to the sum of the two individual amplitudes. As the light in an optical ring resonator completes multiple circuits around the ring component, it will interfere with the other light still in the loop. As such, assuming there are no losses in the system such as those due to absorption, evanescence, or imperfect coupling and the resonance condition is met, the intensity of the light emitted from a ring resonator will be equal to the intensity of the light fed into the system.

=== Optical coupling ===
Important for understanding how an optical ring resonator works, is the concept of how the linear waveguides are coupled to the ring waveguide. When a beam of light passes through a wave guide as shown in the graph on the right, part of light will be coupled into the optical ring resonator. The reason for this is the phenomenon of the evanescent field, which extends outside of the waveguide mode in an exponentially decreasing radial profile. In other words, if the ring and the waveguide are brought closely together, some light from the waveguide can couple into the ring. There are three aspects that affect the optical coupling: the distance, the coupling length and the refractive indices between the waveguide and the optical ring resonator. In order to optimize the coupling, it is usually the case to narrow the distance between the ring resonator and the waveguide. The closer the distance, the easier the optical coupling happens. In addition, the coupling length affects the coupling as well. The coupling length represents the effective curve length of the ring resonator for the coupling phenomenon to happen with the waveguide. It has been studied that as the optical coupling length increases, the difficulty for the coupling to happen decreases. Furthermore, the refractive index of the waveguide material, the ring resonator material and the medium material in between the waveguide and the ring resonator also affect the optical coupling. The medium material is usually the most important feature under study since it has a great effect on the transmission of the light wave. The refractive index of the medium can be either large or small according to various applications and purposes.

One more feature about optical coupling is the critical coupling. The critical coupling shows that no light is passing through the waveguide after the light beam is coupled into the optical ring resonator. The light will be stored and lost inside the resonator thereafter. 
 Lossless coupling is when no light is transmitted all the way through the input waveguide to its own output; instead, all of the light is coupled into the ring waveguide (such as what is depicted in the image at the top of this page). For lossless coupling to occur, the following equation must be satisfied:

: formula_1

where t is the transmission coefficient through the coupler and formula_2 is the taper-sphere mode coupling amplitude, also referred to as the coupling coefficient.

== Theory ==
To understand how optical ring resonators work, we must first understand the optical path length difference (OPD) of a ring resonator. This is given as follows for a single-ring ring resonator:

: formula_3

where &quot;r&quot; is the radius of the ring resonator and &quot;formula_4&quot; is the effective index of refraction of the waveguide material. Due to the total internal reflection requirement, formula_4 must be greater than the index of refraction of the surrounding fluid in which the resonator is placed (e.g. air). For resonance to take place, the following resonant condition must be satisfied:

: formula_6

where &quot;formula_7&quot; is the resonant wavelength and &quot;m&quot; is the mode number of the ring resonator. This equation means that in order for light to interfere constructively inside the ring resonator, the circumference of the ring must be an integer multiple of the wavelength of the light. As such, the mode number must be a positive integer for resonance to take place. As a result, when the incident light contains multiple wavelengths (such as white light), only the resonant wavelengths will be able to pass through the ring resonator fully.

The quality factor and the finesse of an optical ring resonator can be quantitatively described using the following formulas (see: eq: 2.37 in, or eq:19+20 in, or eq:12+19 in ):

: formula_8
:formula_9

where &quot;formula_10&quot; is the finesse of the ring resonator, formula_11 is the operation frequency, formula_12 is the free spectral range and formula_13 is the full-width half-max of the transmission spectra. The quality factor is useful in determining the spectral range of the resonance condition for any given ring resonator. The quality factor is also useful for quantifying the amount of losses in the resonator as a low formula_14 factor is usually due to large losses.

== Double ring resonators ==
 In a double ring resonator, two ring waveguides are used instead of one. They may be arranged in series (as shown on the right) or in parallel. When using two ring waveguides in series, the output of the double ring resonator will be in the same direction as the input (albeit with a lateral shift). When the input light meets the resonance condition of the first ring, it will couple into the ring and travel around inside of it. As subsequent loops around the first ring bring the light to the resonance condition of the second ring, the two rings will be coupled together and the light will be passed into the second ring. By the same method, the light will then eventually be transferred into the bus output waveguide. Therefore, in order to transmit light through a double ring resonator system, we will need to satisfy the resonant condition for both rings as follows:

: formula_15

: formula_16

where formula_17 and formula_18 are the mode numbers of the first and second ring respectively and they must remain as positive integer numbers. For the light to exit the ring resonator to the output bus waveguide, the wavelength of the light in each ring must be same. That is, formula_19 for resonance to occur. As such, we get the following equation governing resonance:

: formula_20
Note that both formula_17 and formula_18 need to remain integers.

A system of two ring resonators coupled to a single waveguide has also been shown to work as a tunable reflective filter (or an optical mirror). Forward propagating waves in the waveguide excite anti-clockwise rotating waves in both rings. Due to the inter-resonator coupling, these waves generate clockwise rotating waves in both rings which are in turn coupled to backward propagating (reflected) waves in the waveguide. 
In this context, the utilization of nested ring resonator cavities has been demonstrated in recent studies. These nested ring resonators are designed to enhance the quality factor (Q-factor) and extend the effective light-matter interaction length. These nested cavity configurations enable light to traverse the nested cavity multiple times, a number equal to the round trips of the main cavity multiplied by the round trips of the nested cavity, as depicted in Figure below.

== Applications ==
Due to the nature of the optical ring resonator and how it &quot;filters&quot; certain wavelengths of light passing through, it is possible to create high-order optical filters by cascading many optical ring resonators in series. This would allow for &quot;small size, low losses, and integrability into [existing] optical networks.&quot; Additionally, since the resonance wavelengths can be changed by simply increasing or decreasing the radius of each ring, the filters can be considered tunable. This basic property can be used to create a sort of mechanical sensor. If an optical fiber experiences mechanical strain, the dimensions of the fiber will be altered, thus resulting in a change in the resonant wavelength of light emitted. This can be used to monitor fibers or waveguides for changes in their dimensions.
The tuning process can be affected also by a change of refractive index using various means including thermo-optic, electro-optic or all-optical effects. Electro-optic and all-optical tuning is faster than thermal and mechanical means, and hence find various applications including in optical communication. Optical modulators with a high-Q microring are reported to yield outstandingly small power of modulation at a speed of &gt; 50 Gbit/s at cost of a tuning power to match wavelength of the light source. A ring modulator placed in a Fabry-Perot laser cavity was reported to eliminate the tuning power by automatic matching of the laser wavelength with that of the ring modulator while maintaining high-speed ultralow-power modulation of a Si microring modulator.

Optical ring, cylindrical, and spherical resonators have also been proven useful in the field of biosensing., and a crucial research focus is the enhancement of biosensing performance One of the main benefits of using ring resonators in biosensing is the small volume of sample specimen required to obtain a given spectroscopy results in greatly reduced background Raman and fluorescence signals from the solvent and other impurities. Resonators have also been used to characterize a variety of absorption spectra for the purposes of chemical identification, particularly in the gaseous phase.

Another potential application for optical ring resonators are in the form of whispering gallery mode switches. &quot;[Whispering Gallery Resonator] microdisk lasers are stable and switch reliably and hence, are suitable as switching elements in all-optical networks.&quot; An all-optical switch based on a high Quality factor cylindrical resonator has been proposed that allows for fast binary switching at low power.

Many researchers are interested in creating three-dimensional ring resonators with very high quality factors. These dielectric spheres, also called microsphere resonators, &quot;were proposed as low-loss optical resonators with which to study cavity quantum electrodynamics with laser-cooled atoms or as ultrasensitive detectors for the detection of single trapped atoms.”

Ring resonators have also proved useful as single photon sources for quantum information experiments. Many materials used to fabricate ring resonator circuits have non-linear responses to light at high enough intensities. This non-linearity allows for frequency modulation processes such as four-wave mixing and Spontaneous parametric down-conversion which generate photon pairs. Ring resonators amplify the efficiency of these processes as they allow the light to circulate around the ring.

<doc id="912173" wikidata="Q4824565" url="?curid=912173" title="Australian Plague Locust Commission">
<text>The Australian Plague Locust Commission (APLC) is a joint venture of the Australian Government and the member states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland, created in 1974 to manage outbreaks of the Australian plague locust, spur-throated locust and migratory locust in eastern Australia. With 19 staff members at its headquarters in Canberra and field offices in Narromine, Broken Hill and Longreach, it is jointly funded by the Commonwealth government and by the Australian states of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland.

==Activities==
The APLC conducts regular surveys of locust populations and migrations and carries out control of locust outbreaks by means of aerial application of pesticides; traditionally these were chemicals, but more recently APLC has been a major contributor to the development of a biological pesticide in collaboration with CSIRO and LUBILOSA scientists. It also conducts educational outreach and training courses for landowners, businesses, and local governments, including international consulting work in Asia, Africa and South America.

Responsibility to control limited outbreaks of the pest species resides with the states. The APLC undertakes and coordinates activities when species migrate or have the potential to migrate across state borders and subsequently cause damage to agriculture in more than one of the member states. The establishment of the APLC allowed for the first use of remotely sensed data to forecast locust populations in Australia.

In 2010, the APLC together with the states identified the potential for a significant infestation of the Australian plague locust. A coordinated effort to minimise damage was undertaken. It was estimated the activities resulted in a saving of $963 million from the expenditure of $50 million.

<doc id="912174" wikidata="Q735119" url="?curid=912174" title="Tony Meola">
<text>Antonio Michael Meola (; ; born February 21, 1969) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper. He represented the United States national team at the 1990, 1994, and 2002 World Cups. From 1996 to 2006, he played in Major League Soccer, the U.S. top soccer division, where he obtained multiple honors. Meola is currently a radio host on SiriusXM FC.

==Early life==

Meola was born in Belleville, New Jersey. He grew up in Kearny. He played boys&#x27; soccer for Kearny High School. He learned his love for the game from his father, Vincenzo, who played for Italian second division club Avellino before immigrating to the U.S. Meola was All-State both as a goalkeeper (1985) and a forward (1986). He had a part in 41 clean sheets and scored 42 goals during his high school career.

In 1999, Meola was named by &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; as one of the top ten New Jersey high school soccer players of the 1980s. Meola not only excelled at soccer, he was a three-sport varsity letterman. He was the captain of the school&#x27;s basketball team and was named an All-State baseball player in 1987. The New York Yankees drafted him out of high school, though Meola did not sign a contract with them.

==College==

Meola attended the University of Virginia on a soccer/baseball athletic scholarship. While at Virginia, he played under coach Bruce Arena. By the time he was playing for the Cavaliers, he had already begun to make a name for himself on the international scene. In October 1987, he backstopped the U.S. U-20 national team at the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship. He earned first team All American honors both his freshman and sophomore years. He also won the Hermann Trophy as a freshman in 1988 and the MAC Award as a sophomore in 1989. On December 15, 1989, he announced that he was leaving U.Va. to pursue a career with the U.S. national team.

Meola also lettered for the U.Va. Cavaliers baseball team his freshman year of 1988 as a third baseman.

==Professional career==

===Early soccer career===

Meola had signed with the U.S. Soccer Federation before the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Following the cup, Meola signed on loan with English second division club Brighton &amp; Hove Albion where he played eleven games; only two were league games. He gained his first start when he replaced the injured Perry Digweed and promptly won man of the match honors. On September 14, 1990, Meola was transferred to second division club Watford before moving back to the U.S., which he did when he was unable to renew his work permit due to his inability to gain first team time with Watford.

In 1991, Meola played for the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the American Professional Soccer League. He shared the goal with Arnie Mausser.

===American football and acting===

Meola attempted to become a placekicker with NFL&#x27;s New York Jets in July 1994 but didn&#x27;t pass the try-outs and was cut.

Although Meola signed with the Buffalo Blizzard of the NPSL on December 14, 1994, for the 1994–95 indoor season and became the team&#x27;s starting keeper, he left in mid-February 1995, as he had taken a lead role in the off-Broadway play &quot;Tony and Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot; and needed to join the cast.

===United Soccer Leagues===

In February 1995, Meola joined the Long Island Rough Riders for its upcoming 1995 USISL season. That year the Rough Riders claimed the USISL championship.

===MetroStars===

Meola spent three weeks in February 1996 training with Italian club Parma. Upon the creation of Major League Soccer, he was allocated to the NY/NJ MetroStars, for whom he played between 1996 and 1998, starting almost every game. During his time with the MetroStars, he set a league record with nine shutouts in 1996. He did not win the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award, however; the honor went to Mark Dodd.

===Kansas City Wizards===

Meola was traded to the Kansas City Wizards (with Alexi Lalas for Mark Chung and Mike Ammann) in 1999, but missed most of his first year in the midwest due to injury. Chris Snitko and David Winner backstopped during Meola&#x27;s absence. The team struggled for results and wins with both Winner and Snitko.

In 2000, Meola was named League MVP, Goalkeeper of the Year, and MLS Cup MVP as he led Kansas City to the championship. He set a new league record by recording 16 shutouts. Meola was voted into the 2000 MLS All Star Game playing the first half in goal, and made a cameo in the 2nd half up top as a forward.

Meola played for the Wizards through the 2004 MLS season. That year, an injury forced him out of contention. Bo Oshoniyi took over the goalkeeping position, although Meola recorded a shutout in the Wizards&#x27; U.S. Open Cup final win over the Chicago Fire, and Meola was not asked back for next season, instead stuck with Oshoniyi as the starting goalkeeper.

===MetroStars/Red Bulls return===

Meola was re-acquired by the MetroStars in June 2005. He was named to the MLS All-Time Best XI after the season. Following the 2006 season, Meola was waived by the team, now known as the New York Red Bulls.

===New Jersey Ironmen===
Meola signed a contract in summer 2007 with the New Jersey Ironmen, an indoor soccer expansion team based in Newark, NJ that played in the Major Indoor Soccer League. As starting goalie, Meola led the team to the playoffs in its first year.

==International career==
Meola made his U.S. national team debut on June 10, 1988, against Ecuador. Meola&#x27;s second cap came in a June 4, 1989 victory over Peru in the Marlboro Cup which won the U.S. the cup. The team took the trophy to the Scots-American Club in Kearny, New Jersey. After the party, Meola drove back to the team&#x27;s hotel, dropped the trophy at the front desk and drove home. As he remembers it, &quot;A week later Doug Newman called me up and asked where the cup was. I told him I&#x27;d left it at for him at the hotel. . . . I&#x27;m sure they got it back. Back then there weren&#x27;t too many cups in U.S. Soccer.&quot;

Later in the summer, the national team went on a tour of Italy, playing several Serie A teams. At the time, David Vanole was the main goalkeeper of the U.S., but over the previous month, he had fought with the U.S. Soccer Federation over a contract dispute and traded his place on the field with Meola to get his burgeoning weight under control. U.S. coach Bob Gansler wanted to start Meola against A.S. Roma, but Meola was injured in a freak accident when a ball struck his head during practice. Vanole started in his place, but let in three goals in a 4-3 U.S. victory. This bad performance led Gansler to drop Vanole, who never again played for the U.S., thus making Meola an undisputed starter between the sticks. He played the remaining qualifying games for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, including the famous 1–0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago that sealed a spot for the U.S. in the final tournament, where he also played every minute in goal.

Meola remained the keeper of choice for the U.S. national team from 1990 through the 1994 FIFA World Cup. At that tournament, his play and ponytail made him a recognizable face around the country. After the U.S. loss to Brazil in the second round of the World Cup, Meola informed the U.S. coach Bora Milutinović that he intended to pursue a professional American football career as a placekicker. Milutinović never called Meola back to the U.S. team. In a 2024 interview with CBS, Meola claimed that this lack of callback was actually related to leave he took for family reasons and that an unnamed USSF official effectively told him he was being blackballed as a result.

It was not until January 1999 that Meola again played for the U.S. By that time, Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel were competing for the starting goalkeeper spot on the team and Meola never regained the first team place he had enjoyed in the early 1990s. However, he continued to play for the U.S. and earned his 100th cap in 2006. He was the third-choice goalkeeper at the 2002 FIFA World Cup behind Friedel and Keller.

==Coach==

===Jacksonville Armada===
On November 24, 2015, Meola was hired for his first coaching position in the NASL with Jacksonville Armada FC. Meola recorded his first managerial victory in the club&#x27;s home opener against Miami FC on April 15, 2016. Meola was fired on August 7, 2016, after posting an overall record of 2W-6D-10L, including a 1-2-5 record in the Fall Season and 1-4-5 showing in the Spring Season.

===Coaching record===


==Personal life==
Meola&#x27;s non-soccer ventures include appearing Off-Broadway in &quot;Tony and Tina&#x27;s Wedding&quot; in 1995, and running his own mortgage firm.

Meola was the original drummer for New Jersey&#x27;s cover band Mushmouth and still plays with the band on occasions. 
A soccer video game for the SNES with Meola&#x27;s name, &quot;Tony Meola&#x27;s Sidekicks Soccer&quot; (also known as &quot;Super Copa&quot; in Latin America and &quot;Ruy Ramos&#x27; World Wide Soccer&quot; in Japan), was released in 1993.

In 2012, Meola was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame.

Meola now lives in Toms River, New Jersey and has three children, Jon, Kylie, and Aidan. Jon Meola was a member of the University of Virginia baseball team during the 2016 season, before transferring to Stetson University. His son Aidan is a member of the Oklahoma State Cowboys baseball team.

==Broadcasting==
Meola worked on beIN Sports coverage of Copa America. He also commentates MLS games for FOX when their lead commentators weren&#x27;t available. 
In 2018, he was a featured commentator on FOX and FS1 for their United States broadcasts of the FIFA World Cup.
In 2020, he was announced to be the color commentator for the Chicago Fire FC.

<doc id="912178" wikidata="Q4871149" url="?curid=912178" title="Battle of Guadalcanal order of battle">
<text>This is the order of battle for the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]], called Operation &quot;Watchtower&quot;, the first major Allied offensive in the Pacific Theater of Operations in World War II. The campaign lasted from the initial American landings on 7 August 1942 until the final Japanese evacuation on 9 February 1943, a period of six months, far longer than was expected by Allied planners. 

The 7 August landings on Guadalcanal itself and Tulagi across Savo Sound (the site of a Japanese seaplane base) were carried out by [[United States Marine Corps#World War II|US Marines]] under the command of Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift. These were followed by units of the Naval Construction Battalions, known as CB&#x27;s or Seabees.

Forces of the [[List_of_United_States_Army_campaigns_during_World_War_II#Asiatic-Pacific Theater|US Army]] began arriving to relieve the exhausted Marines on 13 October. On 8 December Vandegrift was replaced by Major General Alexander M. Patch, US Army, who was named commander of the XIV Army Corps on 2 January 1943. Patch declared the island secure on 9 February.

The high command of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] did not take initially the Allied effort on Guadalcanal seriously and committed units piecemeal throughout the fall of 1942. Over the course of the campaign, the Japanese subjected two entire infantry divisions to massive attrition on the island. 

 The [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]]&#x27;s struggle to take Guadalcanal achieved legendary status: the heat and mud, the malaria and dysentery, the giant tropical insects and the fanatical, often suicidal, resistance of the Japanese combined to create an immense amount of sheer suffering. Today, the unit&#x27;s insignia features the word &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; superimposed on a large red numeral 1. Three future commandants of the Marine Corps fought on &quot;The Canal&quot;: Alexander A. Vandegrift, Clifton B. Cates and Lemuel C. Shepherd. Vandegrift was awarded the Medal of Honor the following year in recognition of his courage and extraordinary leadership during the Corps&#x27;s four-month struggle. 


In addition to the action on the ground, the [[United States Navy]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] fought several vicious and costly surface engagements at night in the waters of Savo Sound. Two nights after the initial landings, the US Navy experienced the worst open-water defeat in its history at the Battle of Savo Island. By the time the Japanese had given up on Guadalcanal, they had lost 2 battleships, 2 heavy cruisers and 7 destroyers; Allied losses included 5 heavy cruisers (one of which was Australian), 2 light cruisers and a destroyer. Each side had an admiral killed in combat. After the war, the area was renamed [[Ironbottom Sound]] in reference to the number of ships sunk there.

=== Theater command ===

The roles of Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas (CINCPOA) and Commander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Fleet (CINCPAC), were both exercised by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz from his headquarters at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii.

Since the Solomons lie in the Southern Pacific, the landings of 7 August 1942 on Guadalcanal were the responsibility of the South Pacific Fleet, led by Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley from his headquarters at Nouméa, New Caledonia. Adm. Ghormley&#x27;s pessimism, inadequate staff work and unwillingness to visit the front led Adm. Nimitz to replace him with the much more aggressive and hands-on Vice Admiral William F. Halsey on 18 October 1942.

=== Operational command ===

Operational command of the invasion was assigned to Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher. He also had direct command of the covering force, designated Task Force 61, where he flew his flag aboard fleet carrier &quot;Saratoga&quot;. The amphibious forces, Task Force 62, were led by Rear Admiral Richmond Kelly Turner aboard attack transport &quot;McCawley&quot;.

Bitter disputes between Vice Adm. Fletcher and Rear Adm. Turner arose during both the planning and execution of the invasion. At issue was how long Fletcher&#x27;s aircraft carriers would stay in the vicinity of Guadalcanal to provide air cover for Turner&#x27;s support vessels in Savo Sound. The matter came to a head on D+1 (8 August), after two days of assaults by bombers from the Japanese base at Rabaul. These attacks convinced Fletcher that his crucial aircraft carriers could not be risked in the waters of the Solomons any longer and his task force departed the area that evening. Unsettled by the removal of air cover and rattled on the morning of D+2 by the discovery that his cruiser screen had been decimated at the Battle of Savo Island, Turner ordered his vulnerable, and still half-full, cargo ships back to Nouméa around sundown 9 August. The Marine Corps forces ashore were thus left without air cover or the planned level of food and ammunition. This suboptimal outcome was at least partially attributable to the decision to vest both overall mission command and carrier task force command in the same individual (Vice Adm. Fletcher).

The D-Day (7 August) landings on Guadalcanal were carried out by the 1st and 3rd Battalions/5th Marines at 0910 hours, followed by the 1st Marines at 0930. Landings on the Florida Islands across Savo Sound were carried out earlier that morning by the 2nd Battalion/5th Marines, the 1st Parachute Battalion, and the 1st Marine Raider Battalion. The 7th Marines and 1st Battalion/11th Marines arrived 18 September. The division began withdrawal from the island 12 December.

<text>Batenburg is a city in the municipality of Wijchen, in the Dutch province of Gelderland. It is located on the Meuse, about 15 km west of Nijmegen. It is well known for the remains of a medieval fort in the center of the town. Batenburg received city rights in 1349. Until 1984, Batenburg was a separate municipality.

It was first mentioned in 1166 as Battenburg. The etymology in unclear. Batenburg developed around Batenburg Castle. In 1347, it received city rights., and by 1400, had walls and two city gates. The castle dated from the mid-12th century. It was destroyed and rebuilt many times until 1795 and was later used as a stone quarry. The medieval Dutch Reformed Church was heavily damaged around 1600 and rebuilt between 1608 and 1634 without a choir. The tower dates from the early 15th century. The city did not develop, and was home to 441 people in 1840.

<text>Mandu or Mandavgad is an ancient city in the present-day Mandav area of the Dhar district. It is located in the Malwa and Nimar region of western Madhya Pradesh, India, at 35 km from Dhar city. In the 11th century, Mandu was the sub division of the Tarangagadh or Taranga kingdom. This fortress town on a rocky outcrop about from Indore is celebrated for its architecture.

==History==



An inscription discovered from Talanpur (around 100 km from Mandu) states that a merchant named Chandra Simha installed a statue in a temple of Parshvanatha located in the Mandapa Durg. While &quot;Durg&quot; means &quot;Fort&quot;, the word &quot;Mandu&quot; is a Prakrit corruption of &quot;mandapa&quot;, meaning &quot;hall, temple&quot;. The inscription is dated 612 VS (555 CE), which indicates that Mandu was a flourishing town in 6th century.

Mandu gained prominence in 10th and 11th century under the Paramaras. The town of Mandu, situated at an elevation of 633 metres (2,079 feet), is perched on the Vindhya Range extending for while overlooking the plateau of Malwa to the north and the valley of the Narmada River to the south which acted as natural defences for the fort-capital the Paramaras. As &quot;Mandapa-Durga&quot;, Mandu is mentioned as the royal residence in the inscriptions of the Paramara kings starting from Jayavarman II. It is possible that Jayavarman or his predecessor Jaitugi moved from the traditional Paramara capital Dhara to Mandu, because of attacks from the neighbouring kingdoms. Balban, the general of the Delhi&#x27;s Sultan Nasir-ud-din, had reached the northern frontier of the Paramara territory by this time. Around the same time, the Paramaras also faced attacks from the Yadava emperor Krishna of Devgiri and the Vaghela king Visaladeva of Gujarat. Compared to Dhara, which is located in the plains, the hilly area of Mandu would have offered a better defensive position.

In 1305, the Muslim Sultan of Delhi Alauddin Khalji captured Malwa, the Paramara territory. Ayn al-Mulk Multani, the newly appointed Governor of Malwa, was sent to expel the Paramara king Mahalakadeva from Mandu and cleanse that place from &quot;the odour of infidelity&quot;. With the help of a spy, Multani&#x27;s forces found a way to enter the fort secretly. Mahalakadeva was killed while attempting to flee, on 24 November 1305.

When Timur captured Delhi in 1401, the Afghan Dilawar Khan, governor of Malwa, set up his own little kingdom and the Ghuri dynasty was established. His son, Hoshang Shah, shifted the capital from Dhar to Mandu and raised it to its greatest splendour. His son and third and last ruler of Ghuri dynasty, Mohammed, ruled for just one year till his poisoning by the militaristic Mohammed Khalji.

Mohammed Khalji established the Khalji dynasty of Malwa (1436-1531) and went on to rule for the next 33 years. However, it was under his reign that the Malwa Sultanate reached its greatest height. He was succeeded by his son, Ghiyas-ud-din, in 1469 and ruled for the next 31 years. He had a large harem and built the Jahaz Mahal for housing the women, numbering thousands. Ghiyas-ud-din was poisoned at age 80, by Nasir-ud-din, his son.
In 1526, Mahmud II the sixth Khalji ruler made no resistance against the invading Bahadur Shah of Gujarat who conquered Mandu 28 March 1531. In 1530 Humayun, the second Mughal Emperor, succeeded Babur. Babur had established the Mughal dynasty. Humayun had two major rivals: Bahadur Shah of Gujarat and Sher Shah Suri. Humayun was engaged in a war with Sher Shah Suri when he learned of an imminent attack by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat who was being aided by the Portuguese. With an unusual swiftness Humayun attacked and defeated Bahadur Shah. Thus in 1534 Mandu came under Humayun&#x27;s rule and he ordered large scale massacre of prisoners there. Humayun fancied Mandu so he relaxed here for a brief, peaceful interlude. Humayun lost the kingdom to Mallu Khan, an officer of the Khalji dynasty. Ten more years of feuds and invasions followed and in the end Baz Bahadur emerged on top.

By this time Humayun had been defeated by Sher Shah Suri and had fled India. Sher Shah Suri died in 1545 and his son Islam Shah died in 1553. Islam Shah&#x27;s 12-year-old son Feroz Khan became the king but was killed by Adil Shah Suri within 3 days. Adil Shah appointed Hemu, also known as &#x27;Hemof Army and Prime Minister. Hemu had a rapid rise during Sur regime. A grain supplier to Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s army and then Chief of Intelligence or Daroga-i-Chowki (Superintendent of Post) under Islam Shah, he became the Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Afghan Army (Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s army) under the reign of Adil Shah Suri. Adil Shah Suri was an incompetent ruler and many rebellions occurred against his rule. Hemu was sent to quell these rebellions. During this period Hemu attacked Mandu also and Baz Bahadur ran away from Mandu. Hemu appointed his own Governor here. During this period Humayun had returned to India and in 1555 was again the emperor. In 1556 Humayun died after falling while descending a staircase.

Hemu was in Bengal at the time and sensing an opportunity attacked Mughals. Soon Agra, Bihar, Eastern UP, Madhya Pradesh were all won and on 6 October 1556, he won Delhi, defeating Akbar&#x27;s forces, and had his coronation at Purana Quila, the next day. Akbar defeated and killed Hemu in the second Battle of Panipat on 7 November 1556. In 1561, Akbar&#x27;s army led by Adham Khan and Pir Muhammad Khan attacked Malwa and defeated Baz Bahadur in the battle of Sarangpur on 29 March 1561. One of the reasons for Adham Khan&#x27;s attack seems to be his love for Rani Roopmati. Rani Roopmati poisoned herself to death on hearing the news of fall of Mandu. Baz Bahadur fled to Khandesh. Akbar, soon recalled Adham Khan and made over command to Pir Muhammad. Pir Muhammad attacked Khandesh and proceeded up to Burhanpur but he was defeated by a coalition of three powers: Miran Mubarak Shah II of Khandesh, Tufal Khan of Berar and Baz Bahadur. Pir Muhammad died while retreating. The confederate army pursued the Mughals and drove them out of Malwa. Baz Bahadur regained his kingdom for a short period. In 1562, Akbar sent another army led by Abdullah Khan, an Uzbeg which finally defeated Baz Bahadur. He fled to Chittor. Baz Bahadur remained a fugitive at a number of courts till he surrendered in November, 1570 to Akbar at Nagaur. He joined Akbar&#x27;s service.

After Akbar added Mandu to the Mughal empire, it kept a considerable degree of independence, until taken by the Marathas in 1732 by Peshwa Baji Rao I. The capital of Malwa was then shifted back to Dhar by Marathas under Maharaja Pawar, re-establishing Hindu rule.

==Places of interest==

Mandu, due to its strategic position and natural defences, was an important place with a rich and varied history. It was an important military outpost and its military past can be gauged by the circuit of the battlemented wall, which is nearly and is punctuated by 12 gateways. The wall encloses a large number of palaces, mosques, Jain temples of 14th century and other buildings. The oldest mosque dates from 1405; the finest is the Jama Masjid or great mosque, a notable example of Pashtun architecture. The marble-domed tomb of this ruler is also magnificent

Some of the notable places, listed in South to North direction are:

Roopmati&#x27;s Pavilion
A large sandstone structure originally built as an army observation post it is known today as Roopmati&#x27;s Pavilion. Rani Roopmati - the love interest of Baaz Bahadur lived here and is said to have gazed at the Baz Bahadur&#x27;s Palace - situated below and also at Narmada river, flowing through the Nimar plains far below, a river which the queen revered.

Baz Bahadur&#x27;s Palace
Built by Baz Bahadur, this 16th-century structure is famous for its large courtyards encompassed by large halls and high terraces.
It is situated below Roopmati&#x27;s Pavilion and can be seen from the pavilion.

Rewa Kund
A reservoir constructed by Baz Bahadur for the purpose of supplying water to Rani Roopmati&#x27;s Pavilion.
The reservoir is situated below the pavilion and hence is considered an architectural marvel.

Darya Khan&#x27;s Tomb complex

Darya Khan was a minister in the court of Mahmud Khalji II, and his tomb lies in a walled complex along with another tomb, a mosque, a pond, and an inn. At the centre of the complex is the massive sandstone tomb of Darya Khan. Hathi Paga Mahal or Elephant Leg Palace is located on the south-eastern side of the Darya Khan Complex, and is crowned with a massive dome.

Shri Mandavagadh Teerth

Shri Mandavagadh Teerth is dedicated to Lord Suparshvanatha. It belongs to Shwetambar sect of Jainism. The temple has been attractively constructed and looks exquisite. It underwent expansion in 14th century. The idol of Lord Suparshvanath is believed to be much older. The idol is white in complexion and is 91.54 cm (3 feet) in height. It is seated in a &quot;padmansana&quot; posture. Apart from this in this same fort there is a fine temple of smaller size of Lord Shantinath. Ruins of many temples and idols can be seen here. As per a reference once there were almost 700 Jain temples here.

Jami Masjid
Inspired by the great mosque of Damascus, this enormous structure is striking in both its simplicity and architectural style-with large courtyards and grand entrances. At the front of Jaami Mosque, there are ruins of Asharfi Palace. There is a seven-story winning memorial at the north-east of the palace, and also a fascinating Ram Temple nearby, which was built by Maharani Sakarwar Bai Pawar in 1769 CE.

Hoshang Shah&#x27;s Tomb
India&#x27;s first marble structure, it is one of the most refined examples of Afghan architecture.
Its unique features include the beautifully proportioned dome, intricate marble lattice work and porticoed courts and towers. It served as a template for the construction of Taj Mahal.

Jahaz Mahal/Ship Palace
Situated between two artificial lakes, this two-storied architectural marvel is so named as it appears as a ship floating in water. Built by Sultan Ghiyas-ud-din-Khalji, it served as a harem for the sultan. This is The Water Palace shown in Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1832, from a painting by Copley Fielding together with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.
Apart from the enthralling architecture, Jahaz Mahal is also a significant venue for the vibrant colours of the Mandu festival. With a series of adventure activities, music shows, lights, and balloon festivals that happen every year in the winter season. Along with a colourful celebration, the sound and light show at the Jahaz Mahal is another interesting event that holds the eyes of every tourist. 

Hindola Mahal
Hindola Mahal - meaning Swing palace is so named due to its sloping side walls.
The Hindola Mahal might have been constructed during the reign of Hushang Shah about 1425 C.E. but may date to the end of the 15th century during the reign of Ghiyas al-Din. It is one of a set buildings making up the royal palace complex at Mandu, which consists of the Jahaz Mahal, the Hindola Mahal, the Taveli Mahal, and the Nahar Jharokha. The Hindola Mahal may have been used as an audience chamber.

The Darwazas (Gates)

The wall encompassing Mandu has 12 major &quot;darwazas&quot; or gates. The present road, through which Mandu is reached passes through many of these. Also encountered are smaller gateways built to provide protection to the above-mentioned 12 gates.

Songarh/ Sonergarh Fort: The fort was once an impregnable citadel and part of the historic hillfort of Mandu, now in ruins, which stands in a spectacular, naturally-defended position on a plateau of the Vindhya hills surrounded by a ravine. The citadel is separated from the main hill by a narrow neck of land.

<text>George Shiras Jr. (January 26, 1832 – August 2, 1924) was an American lawyer who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1892 to 1903. At that time of his appointment, he had 37 years of private legal practice but had never judged a case. He is noted for his conservative voting with the majority in &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; and in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;.

==Life and career==
Shiras was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, January 26, 1832. He attended Ohio University and then graduated from Yale College, Phi Beta Kappa, in 1853. He began law school at Yale Law School, but left before earning a law degree. He finished his training by reading law at a law office, then practiced law in Dubuque, Iowa, from 1855 to 1858, and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from 1858 to 1892. In Pittsburgh, he became a prominent corporate attorney, and he was noted for his honesty and pragmatism while representing some of the nation&#x27;s industrial giants.

On July 19, 1892, Shiras was nominated by President Benjamin Harrison as an associate justice, to succeed Joseph P. Bradley. He was recommended for the post by his third cousin, Secretary of State James G. Blaine. Shiras was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 26, 1892, and took the judicial oath of office on October 10, 1892.

Although Shiras sat on the Court for more than 10 years authoring 253 majority decisions and 14 dissents, he is noted for his votes on just two landmark cases, &quot;Pollock v. Farmers&#x27; Loan &amp; Trust Co.&quot; (1895), and &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896). He sided with the majority in the 5–4 decision in &quot;Pollock&quot; to strike down the Income Tax Act of 1894 as unconstitutional. Some historians believe Shiras was the pivotal Justice who switched his vote, while other historians suspect that it was either Justice Horace Gray or Justice David Brewer. Regardless, the ruling in &quot;Pollock&quot; led to the need for a constitutional amendment to impose a federal income tax, and in 1913, the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified. Shiras also voted with the 7–1 majority in &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot;, which upheld the constitutionality of racial segregation under the doctrine of separate but equal, and which was effectively overruled in 1954.

Shiras retired from the Supreme Court on February 23, 1903. He died on August 2, 1924, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania a result of a fall followed by pneumonia. He is buried in Allegheny Cemetery in Pittsburgh.

His son, George Shiras III, served as a member of the United States House of Representatives for Pennsylvania.

<text>Monnickendam () is a city in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Waterland, and lies on the coast of the Markermeer, about southeast of Purmerend. It received city rights in 1355 and was damaged by the fires of 1500 and 1513.

==History==

Monnikendam was also the name of a number of warships built at the port of the same name during the Anglo-Dutch Wars.

The town was founded by monks, the name Monnickendam translates as &#x27;Monk&#x27;s dam&#x27;.

Monnickendam was a separate municipality until 1991, when it was merged into Waterland. Although it is a small fishing village today, it was an important port in earlier centuries. It possesses a seventeenth-century weigh house, once used by merchants and port officials, and a bell tower that dates from 1591. The fourteenth century church of St. Nicholas, renovated in 1602, is particularly notable. The synagogue was built in 1894. Jewish families named Monnikendam trace their roots to this town.

The town was the site of an artist&#x27;s colony in the early twentieth century.

== Economy ==
Monnickendam hosts a number of industries, many related to its history and proximity to the Markermeer. Notably, the city is home to the Royal Hakvoort Shipyards that has operated for over a century, first catering to the local fishing industry by building vessels for their purpose, and later moving into luxury and pleasure crafts.

Other notable organisations include Leguit + Roos, specialising in the renovation and restoration of historical buildings that are plenty in the Waterland area.

In recent developments, the derelict business quarter of Galgeriet was demolished in order to make space for the development of new residential buildings. The Dutch government has subsidised this development with €6,420,240, with the hope of creating 700 homes as well as additional commercial spaces to both alleviate the ailing demography and provide an impetus for further economic growth.

==Demographics==
In 2001, the town of Monnickendam had 9,546 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was , and contained 3,766 residences. The wider statistical area of Monnickendam has a population of around 9,680.

==Notable people==
* Wendelmoet Claesdochter, first female Lutheran martyr during the Reformation, executed in 1527 at The Hague
* Cornelis Dirkszoon, mayor of Monnickendam during the Eighty Years&#x27; War
* Hermann Jung (1608–1678), prominent Lutheran theologian and preacher
* Simon Lambrechtszoon Mau, captain of the &quot;Duyfken&quot; who led the first expedition to the Dutch East Indies using a route around Africa

<doc id="912193" wikidata="Q8016685" url="?curid=912193" title="William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester">
<text>William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester (c. 1483/1485 – 10 March 1572), styled Lord St John between 1539 and 1550 and Earl of Wiltshire between 1550 and 1551, was an English Lord High Treasurer, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, and statesman.

==Family origins and early career in Hampshire==
Paulet was the eldest son of Sir John Paulet (1460 – 5 January 1525) of Basing Castle in the parish of Old Basing, near Basingstoke in Hampshire, and of Nunney Castle in Somerset (inherited from the Delamere family in 1415), a cadet branch of Paulet of Hinton St George in Somerset. His mother Alice Paulet was his father&#x27;s second cousin-once-removed the daughter of Sir William Paulet by his wife Elizabeth Denebaud. William had six siblings, including Sir George Paulet of Crondall Manor in Hampshire and Eleanor Paulet (born 1479), wife of William Giffard of Itchell Manor at Ewshot, also in Hampshire.

The family originated at the manor of Paulet (now Pawlett), near Bridgwater in Somerset. The senior branch of the Paulet/Powlet/Poulett family was seated at Hinton St George in Somerset, and had lived in that county since the early thirteenth century; the first Member of Parliament from that line represented Devon in 1385.

There is some disagreement over his date of birth, with different authorities quoting 1483 or 1485. A claim that he was ninety-seven at his death would place his birth in 1474 or 1475. There is also uncertainty about where he was born, but it may have been at Fisherton Delamere in Wiltshire, one of his father&#x27;s manors.

His father, who had held a command against the Cornish rebels in 1497, was the head of the branch seated at Paulet and Road, close to Bridgwater, being the son of John Paulet and Elizabeth Roos. William&#x27;s great-grandfather John Paulet acquired the Hampshire estates by his marriage with Constance Poynings, granddaughter and coheiress of Thomas Poynings, 5th Baron St John of Basing; his barony became abeyant upon his death in 1428/1429.

William Paulet was High Sheriff of Hampshire in 1512, 1519, 1523, and again in 1527. Knighted before the end of 1525, he was appointed Master of the King&#x27;s Wards in November 1526 and appeared in the Privy Council in the same year.

==Marriage and issue==
He married Elizabeth (d. 25 December 1558), daughter of Sir William Capel, Lord Mayor of London and Margaret Arundell in 1503, and by her had four sons and four daughters: 
* John Paulet, 2nd Marquess of Winchester 
* Thomas 
* Chidiock Paulet (also spelled Chidiok, Chediok, Chidieok, or Chidiock), governor of Southampton under Mary and Elizabeth
* Giles 
* Alice, married Richard Stawell, of Cotherston, Somerset
* Margaret, married Sir William Berkeley 
* Margery, married Sir Richard Waller, of Oldstoke, Hampshire
* Eleanor (died 26 September 1558), married Sir Richard Pecksall (died 1571) of Beaurepaire, Hampshire, hereditary Master of the Buckhounds.

==Career as a national statesman==
During his long career Paulet held numerous offices, which included:
* High Sheriff of Hampshire 1511–12, 1518–19 and 1522–23
* Joint Master of the King&#x27;s Wards 1526–34 and sole Master of the King&#x27;s Wards 1534–40
* Member of Parliament for Hampshire 1529–36
* Comptroller of the Household 1532–37
* Keeper of Pamber Forest 1535/6
* Treasurer of the Household 1537–38/9
* Master of the King&#x27;s Woods 1541
* Master of the Court of Wards 1540–42

Paulet&#x27;s political career began in 1529, when he was elected knight of the shire for Hampshire. In 1532, he accompanied King Henry VIII to Calais, France, and the following spring, he accompanied the Duke of Norfolk to join King Francis I of France in a proposed audience with the Pope, to discuss Henry&#x27;s divorce from Catherine of Aragon. In 1536, he was granted the keepership of Pamber Forest, and on 9 March 1539 was created Baron St John. He became steward of the bishopric of Winchester, and became a close associate of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey and a friend of Thomas Cromwell. He was also Comptroller of the Royal Household, and held many other high positions.
In 1535 and 1536, he served as one of the judges for the trials of John Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and the alleged accomplices of Anne Boleyn; in 1535, he became Lord Chamberlain. He partially led the royal forces against the Pilgrimage of Grace, a rebellion that broke out in the autumn of 1536, and in 1538, he became Treasurer of the Household. In 1540, he became the master of Henry&#x27;s Court of Wards and Liveries, a Knight of the Garter in 1543. In June 1543, he was one of the six commissioners of the Treaty of Greenwich, an agreement for the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, and Prince Edward. He was Governor of Portsmouth and Lord Steward of the Household in 1545. In 1546, he became Lord President of the Council, and in 1547, he was an executor of the will of King Henry VIII.

He continued his political manoeuvres in 1549 by supporting the Earl of Warwick against the Duke of Somerset—in reward, on 19 January 1550 he was given the Earldom of Wiltshire and Somerset&#x27;s position of Lord Treasurer. In the following month Warwick took over the post of Lord President of the Council. When Warwick was created Duke of Northumberland on 11 October 1551, Paulet received the Marquessate of Winchester. Six weeks later, he served as Lord High Steward in the Duke of Somerset&#x27;s trial.

It was said that Northumberland and Winchester &quot;ruled the court&quot; of the minor King Edward VI. Mary I affirmed him in all of his positions. After her death, he remained Lord Treasurer and retained many of his other positions, and even at an advanced age (in 1559, he was over seventy years old), he showed no signs of declining—he was Speaker of the House of Lords in 1559 and 1566. He remained in good standing with the English monarchs—Queen Elizabeth once joked, &quot;for, by my troth, if my lord treasurer were but a young man, I could find it in my heart to have him for a husband before any man in England.&quot; Late in life, he opposed any military support of Continental Protestantism, as he feared it would cause a breach with strongly Catholic Spain.

Paulet enjoyed a remarkably long career during the Reformation. Starting out as a Catholic, he was quickly persuaded to see things Henry&#x27;s way once the breach with Rome had been decided on. He was rewarded with former Church properties following the dissolution of the monasteries. Under Edward VI he became an evangelical Protestant and persecuted Roman Catholics and Henrician Conservatives alike. On the accession of the Catholic Mary he announced his reconversion and commenced persecuting his former Protestant co-religionists, even denouncing Bishop Bonner for &quot;laxity in prosecuting the heretics.&quot; His wife also found favour with Mary. On Tuesday 21 August 1554, when Mary went into Westminster Abbey her train was carried by Elizabeth, Marchioness of Winchester and Anne of Cleves.

On Elizabeth&#x27;s succession, he once again shifted his sails and became an advocate of middle-road Anglicanism. All in all, he professed five changes in religious course. Once, when asked how he managed to survive so many storms, not only unhurt, but rising all the while, Paulet answered: &quot;By being a willow, not an oak&quot;.

==Death==
Paulet was still in office when he died on 10 March 1572, a very old man, at Basing House, which he held to rebuild and fortify. His tomb is on the south side of the chancel of Basing church.

<text>The 97th Infantry Division was a unit of the United States Army in World War I and World War II. Nicknamed the &quot;Trident division&quot; because of its shoulder patch, a vertical trident in white on a blue background, it was originally trained in amphibious assaults as preparation for deployment in the Pacific Theater. It was deployed to Europe in 1944 when casualties from the Battle of the Bulge needed to be replaced.

==World War I==

The 97th Division was one of the divisions planned to be activated in late 1918 and deployed to France in 1919 to reinforce the American Expeditionary Force. The division was organized at Camp Cody, Deming, New Mexico and activated on 5 September 1918. It included the 193rd and 194th Infantry Brigades, and the 172nd Field Artillery Brigade. The 194th was to be organized and trained at Camp Cody, the 172nd at Camp Jackson, South Carolina, and the 193rd was to be organized in France with the AEF. The division&#x27;s cadre consisted of over 1,000 trained officers and enlisted men, and Colonel Carl A. Martin became its first commander on 26 September.

The division was intended to be composed of National Army draftees mainly from Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, but in October, over 5,000 draftees, mainly from Oklahoma and Minnesota, were sent to the division at Camp Cody. Initial instruction at Camp Cody went relatively well, but the 172nd Brigade&#x27;s training at Camp Jackson was delayed by a lack of personnel. Its regiments were at less than half-strength as late as the beginning of November. In late October, the 97th was struck by the 1918 flu pandemic, which sickened over 500 soldiers and killed more than 100. On 25 October, Brigadier General James R. Lindsay became division commander as Martin became its chief of staff. The war ended with the Armistice of 11 November, and the 97th was ordered to be demobilized on 20 November. At the time, it was only partially organized and consisted of 402 officers and 7,889 men. The demobilization was completed on 22 December.

Neptune&#x27;s trident was originally adopted as the division&#x27;s symbol, to represent the coastal states of Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, from which the first recruits were drawn in 1918. The three prongs of the trident represent the three states, the blue symbolizes the states&#x27; numerous fresh water lakes, and the white of the border and trident represents the snow that covers these states&#x27; mountains.

==Interwar period==

The 97th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the First Corps Area, and assigned to the XI Corps. The division was further allotted to the states of New Hampshire, Maine, and Vermont as its home area. The headquarters was organized in December 1921 initially at Augusta, Maine, then relocated in September 1922 to the Bell Building at 922 Elm Street in Manchester, New Hampshire. The headquarters was again relocated in August 1923 to the Federal Building in Manchester. In late 1937, the headquarters was transferred to the new Post Office Building in Portland, and remained there until activated for World War II. The 373rd-375th Infantry Regiments, part of the provisional 94th Division in World War I which was intended to be composed of Puerto Rican soldiers, were allotted to Puerto Rico&#x27;s 211th Infantry Brigade as part of a hypothetical division which was never organized, and the unorganized 376th Infantry was assigned to the 94th Division, which was allotted to Massachusetts. To flesh out the rest of the 94th Division&#x27;s infantry, the 301st and 302nd Infantry Regiments (part of the 76th Division in World War I) were assigned, along with the newly-constituted 419th Infantry. The 76th Division retained only its World War I-era 304th Infantry, taking the 385th Infantry from the 97th Division and adding the newly-constituted 417th and 418th Infantry Regiments, while the 97th Division took the 76th Division&#x27;s 303rd Infantry and retained the 386th-388th Infantry Regiments.

After its organization, the 97th Division rapidly built its strength. Although the division area had virtually no major population centers and possessed a poor highway network, the division was above 90 percent complete by November 1923. Due to the poor road network and because the division’s officers tended to be concentrated in the larger towns, the division’s personnel, less those in the infantry regiments, tended to hold their inactive training meetings as “group” meetings (i.e., without respect to unit assignment) rather than unit meetings. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter titled the “97th Division Bulletin.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The mobilization and training station for the division was Camp Devens, Massachusetts, the location where much of the 97th’s training activities occurred over the next 20 years. For the few summers when the division headquarters was called to duty for training as a unit, the 97th Division trained with the staff of the 9th Division&#x27;s 18th Infantry Brigade at Camp Devens, and occasionally with the staff of the 5th Infantry Regiment at Fort Williams, Maine. The summer training for the personnel assigned to the division headquarters was varied and included staff training, branch-specific training, and division-level command post exercises (CPXs). For several summers, however, the division conducted a “Special Officers Camp” at Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, which consisted of training for unassigned officers, officers who could not attend training with their assigned units, and basic officer training for recent ROTC and CMTC commissionees. The division also held periodic contact camps during the inactive training period, usually at Poland Spring, Maine. 

The division’s subordinate units trained all over the First Corps Area. Divisional infantry regiments, for example, held their summer training primarily with the units of the 18th Infantry Brigade at Camp Devens; Fort Ethan Allen; Fort Adams, Rhode Island; and Forts McKinley and Williams, Maine. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the First, Second, and Third Corps Areas with Regular Army units of the same branch. For example, the 322nd Engineer Regiment usually trained with elements of the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 322nd Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 322nd Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC held at Camp Devens, Fort McKinley, and Fort Ethan Allen each year. 

On a number of occasions, the division participated in First Corps Area and First Army CPXs in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 97th Division did not participate in the various First Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to full peace strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==
The 97th Infantry Division was ordered into active military service during World War II on 25 February 1943 at Camp Swift, Texas, the last of the Organized Reserve infantry divisions to enter active duty. Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

Because the activation rate of Army units in late 1942 was proceeding faster than the expected induction rate of new soldiers and there was an urgent need for personnel to participate in the Operation Torch landings in North Africa planned for November 1942, the reorganization of the 97th was deferred until early 1943 and three partially-trained divisions were stripped to less than 50 percent strength. Most of the cadre for the 97th came from the 95th Infantry Division stationed at Fort Sam Houston, Texas. In February 1944 the division was moved to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for additional training. During 1944, approximately 5,000 soldiers were stripped from the division and sent as replacements to other units in Europe. Division strength was eventually restored when the Army Specialized Training Program and aviation cadet training program were sharply reduced or terminated and many of their personnel were reassigned to Army Ground Forces for retraining as infantry.

In July 1944 the division relocated to Camp San Luis Obispo, California. Under the supervision of the Navy and Marine Corps, the division began amphibious training and exercises at Camp Callan, Coronado Strand, San Clemente Island, San Nicolas Island and Camp Pendleton. In September 1944 the 97th was transferred to Camp Cooke, California, for further amphibious training.

In early January 1945, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of Allied forces on the Western Front, was alarmed over the swift progress the Germans had made during the waning Battle of the Bulge and was concerned that the Germans could move additional reinforcements to the west from the Eastern Front. He requested additional divisions over and above those already earmarked for the European theater. The 86th and 97th Infantry Divisions, allocated for service in the Pacific, were ordered to the European Theater of Operations (ETO) instead for the final assault on Germany. The strength of the division upon deployment in Europe was 600 officers and 14,000 men.

===Combat chronicle===
After assembly and training at Camp Cooke in California, the 97th Infantry Division was transported by train to Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. The division embarked on troopships in New York and landed at Le Havre, France on 2 March 1945, then moved to Camp Lucky Strike. After crossing France by troop train, the division passed through Maastricht and crossed the German border west of Aachen on 28 March, taking up a defensive position along the west bank of the Rhine River opposite Düsseldorf. As all bridges over the Rhine had been destroyed and the city was well-defended, the 97th was ordered to move south along the west bank of the Rhine, crossing over it near Bonn on 3 April and taking up a position on the southern bank of the Sieg River at Hennef.

====Ruhr pocket====
The division then entered the battle of the Ruhr pocket, crossing the Sieg River on 7 April, battling German Wehrmacht troops defending Schloss Allner. According to the after action report:
:&quot;Machine-gun fire was strafing the crossing area from castle near ALLNER where it had a clear field of fire and from a wooded spur at a bend in the river W of the crossing, firing upriver toward the boats. Artillery fire, TD&#x27;s, heavy MG fire and mortars were all brought to bear on this castle but although it crumbled, the MG fire continued. Fire was also coming from the high ground N of the river.&quot;

In two days the 922nd Field Artillery Battalion fired over three thousand rounds at the area around the castle. Pfc John Hedrick seized an abandoned assault boat while under heavy enemy fire and used the craft to help ferry troops across the river. He was awarded the Silver Star. After crossing the river, elements of the 387th Infantry Regiment assaulted the castle:

:&quot;The 2d Battalion hit very stiff resistance at the ALLNER Castle and on the ridge in the loop of the river. Anti-tank company and the TD&#x27;s blasted the castle from the S bank of the SIEG River and G Company was able to clear it out.&quot;

Entering Siegburg on 10 April, troops again encountered heavy resistance at the Glockner works.

On 12 April Pfc Joe R. Hastings of Company C, 386th Infantry Regiment, distinguished himself in action at Drabenderhöhe, Germany while attacking an enemy position. According to his citation:
:&quot;[Hastings] rushed forward over 350 yards of open, rolling fields to reach a position from which he could fire on the enemy troops. From this vantage point he killed the crews of a 20mm gun and a machine gun, drove several enemy riflemen from their positions, and so successfully shielded the 1st Platoon that it had time to reorganize and remove its wounded to safety. Observing that the 3d Platoon to his right was being met by very heavy 40mm and machine gun fire, he ran 150 yards with his gun to the leading elements of that unit, where he killed the crew of the 40mm gun...[He then] advanced, firing his gun held at hip height, disregarding the bullets that whipped past him, until the assault had carried 175 yards to the objective...He was killed 4 days later while again supporting the 3d Platoon.&quot;

He received the Medal of Honor posthumously for his actions.

On 14 April, intelligence officers from the 97th Division liberated approximately 800 prisoners of war, including 177 Americans, being held at a POW camp in Hoffnungstal, near Much, Germany.

Pushing on toward Düsseldorf through difficult terrain and heavy resistance in densely wooded areas, the division captured Solingen on 17 April. Düsseldorf fell without much fighting the next day, after the German Resistance launched Aktion Rheinland, and the Ruhr pocket was eliminated by 21 April.

====Flossenbürg concentration camp====
On 23 April elements of the 97th, together with members of the 90th Infantry Division, liberated Flossenbürg concentration camp near Floß in Bavaria. A military police patrol from the 303rd Infantry Regiment may have been the first U.S. Army unit to reach the camp, although the 2nd Cavalry Group, Mechanized and a colonel from the 90th Infantry Division later took credit for liberating the camp. Members of the 97th Division treated sick and dying prisoners and buried the several hundred corpses discovered in the camp. Brigadier General Milton B. Halsey inspected the camp as did General Sherman V. Hasbrouck, the commanding officer of the division artillery. Members of the Counter Intelligence Corps, which included Robie Macauley, Ib Melchior and Anthony Hecht, interviewed former prisoners and gathered evidence for trials of former camp officers and guards. The 97th also liberated Helmbrechts concentration camp, a sub-camp of Flossenbürg for female prisoners.

The following day a unit of the 97th CIC Detachment led by Captain Oscar M. Grimes captured about two hundred Gestapo officers and men in hiding near Hof, Bavaria. They were in possession of American uniforms and equipment, but had evidently made the decision to surrender.

====Czechoslovakia====
On 25 April the division entered Czechoslovakia, moving to protect the left flank of the Third Army on its southern drive. The 97th took Cheb, Czechoslovakia, on 25 April 1945 and attacked the Czechoslovak pocket near Weiden, Germany on 29 April. It had advanced to Konstantinovy Lázně, Czechoslovakia, when it received the ceasefire order on 7 May. Part of the division was in Teplá where the German 2nd Panzer Division had surrendered. The troops used the monastery there as a POW camp for the Germans.

The 97th Infantry Division was credited with firing the last official shot in the European Theatre of Operations during World War II. This shot was fired by Pfc. Domenic Mozzetta (1925-2001) of Company B, 387th Infantry Regiment, 97th Infantry Division, at a German sniper near Klenovice, Czechoslovakia shortly before midnight, 7 May 1945.

After a 30-day leave, the division reassembled at Fort Bragg, crossed the US by troop train and on 1 September embarked aboard the for redeployment to the Pacific, arriving at Cebu, Philippine Islands on 16 September and then sailing to Japan for occupation duty, the first unit previously stationed in Europe to arrive in Japan after the end of the war. Arriving at Yokohama on 25 September 1945, the division relieved the 43rd Infantry Division and established its headquarters at Mitsugahara Airfield in Kumagaya. By December the 97th had reached its maximum deployment through six prefectures: Saitama, Gunma, Nagano, Niigata, Fukushima, and Tochigi.

Confiscating and disposing of Japanese military property proved to be the Division&#x27;s prime task. The 97th returned 198,142,046 pounds of foodstuffs, 670,226 gallons of gasoline, 8,568,857 yards of cloth and 480,343 pairs of boots and shoes to the Japanese government for distribution to civilians.

On 26 October counter-intelligence officers from the 97th Division located $2.5 million worth of stolen radium in the German consulate in Osaka, and another $3 million in silver bullion in a warehouse in Iida, Nagano. On 31 October, Special Agent Robie Macauley of the division&#x27;s counter-intelligence unit arrested 26 prominent Nazis who were in hiding in Karuizawa.

The division was inactivated on 31 March 1946 in Yokohama.

===Command posts in Japan===
*25 Sep 45 - Mitsugahara Airfield in Kumagaya, Saitama, Japan
*7 Oct 45 - Ueda, Nagano, Japan

==Cold War to present==

On 15 July 1962, the division&#x27;s 97th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop was converted and redesignated, less the 3rd Platoon, as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 193rd Infantry Brigade, and relieved from assignment to the 97th Infantry Division. Concurrently, it was withdrawn from the Army Reserve and allotted to the Regular Army.

The 3rd Platoon, 97th Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop was concurrently converted and redesignated as the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 194th Infantry Brigade - hereafter separate lineage). The unit was reactivated shortly thereafter on 8 August 1962 in the Panama Canal Zone.

On 22 December 1967, the 97th Army Reserve Command was activated at Fort Meade, Maryland. While the 97th ARCOM was allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 97th Infantry Division and use its number, Department of the Army policy does not allow for the lineage of Table of Organization and Equipment (TOE) units, such as infantry divisions, to be perpetuated by Table of Distribution (TDA) units, such as ARCOMs.

Three medical units of the 97th were mobilized and deployed to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

In U.S. military Operations in Panama to oust dictator Manuel Noriega in 1989, the 97th deployed troops to neutralize key Panamanian Defense Forces positions on the Pacific side of the Canal Zone; civil affairs soldiers from the 97th later assisted in rebuilding the new Government of Panama.

During operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, more than 3,000 division troops deployed to missions in the Persian Gulf.

In 1996, as part of the overall force reduction following the end of the Cold War, the 97th Army Reserve Command was inactivated and its units were absorbed into the 99th Regional Readiness Command.

Years later the lineage of the 97th Infantry Division was reactivated as the 97th Training Brigade, a subordinate unit of the 100th Training Division.

<text>Vollenhove is a city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Steenwijkerland, southwest of Steenwijk. Until the Noordoostpolder was drained, it was located on the coast of the Zuiderzee.

Vollenhove received city rights in 1354.
Later it was the main city in this region, that was formerly called Land van Vollenhove. Vollenhove was the summer residence of the bishop of Utrecht, the ruler of these parts. He lived in the castle Toutenburg, of which only some small ruins are left now. To be near their lord, quite some nobility moved to Vollenhove. They built their estates (Dutch: havezates) in the town, which was unique. Therefore, Vollenhove was called the city of palaces. Like Blokzijl, peat transport to Holland by ship caused the small city to flourish during the 17th century.

Vollenhove was a separate municipality until 1973, when it became a part of Brederwiede. Between 1818 and 1942, the municipality was divided into two parts, Stad Vollenhove (the city) and Ambt Vollenhove (the countryside).

== History ==
Vollenhove is already listed (as Fulnaho) in 944. The area was once a forest owned by Otto the Great. He gave Bishop of Utrecht Balderik permission to hunt there. In 1010 Emperor Henry II gave the area &quot;Sillva Fulnaho&quot; (Forest Vollenhove) to the bishop of Utrecht. In the 12th century, Bishop Godfried van Rhenen built a castle in the Almere, the Olde Huys, with a keep and a chapel. In the 14th century, the castle was repeatedly attacked by the Frisians from Stellingwerven. The village &quot;Op ten Camph&quot; was built around the castle. On 12 July 1354 it was given a city charter. After 1380 the city was designated as Vollenho.

The heyday of the city Vollenhove was in the first half of the 15th century. Vollenhove was important because of the sturgeon fishing and was a &quot;bijstad&quot; of the League. Earthen walls and gates were also constructed to defend the city. In the first half of the 16th century the city flourished. Joris Schenck van Toutenburg became sheriff and later became governor of Overijssel for Karel the Fifth. Just outside the city Schenck built a castle called Toutenburg. This residence was the administrative center for the three northern provinces of Groningen, Friesland and Overijssel. Drenthe did not count because it was considered to poor. At the outbreak of the Eighty Years&#x27; War Vollenhove lost the role of administrative center, and in the following centuries, the town withered away.

In 1818 was divided into Vollenhove City and Vollenhove office, the country that Vollenhove heard. In the second half of the 19th century Vollenhove flourished again briefly. The moat of the Olde Huys was fishing port and the castle was demolished. When in 1859 the island was evacuated Schokland, drew the most Schokkers in the midst of the remains of the castle. At the end of the 19th century, a new port was built and a specific fishing boat, the Vollenhovense sphere. The construction of the Dam (1932) came to an end the Zuiderzee fishing. Vollenhove was the beginning of World War II as a major port for the reclamation work of the northeast.

== Pictures ==
== Events ==

The most well-known event of the city is the annual flower parade. &quot;Corso Vollenhove&quot; takes place on the last Saturday of August. The parade has always thousands of visitors.

There are about 12 floats with different subjects and roughly 100,000–200,000 flowers per float. Several quality marching bands from in and outside the Netherlands are contracted to play in the parade.

== Trivia ==
The celebration of the 650-year anniversary as a city on 12 July 2004 was attended by Mr. Pieter van Vollenhoven, he is the husband of Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands.
He was named an honorary citizen of the town. Incidentally, his surname has nothing to do with the town Vollenhove.

<doc id="912198" wikidata="Q3644819" url="?curid=912198" title="Cello rock">
<text>Cello rock is a subgenre of rock music characterized by the use of cellos (as well as other bowed string instruments such as the violin and viola) as primary instruments, alongside or in place of more traditional rock instruments such as electric guitars, electric bass guitars, and drum sets.

Cellos, often in groups of three or more, are used to create a sound, rhythm, and texture similar to that of familiar rock music, but distinctly reshaped by the unique timbres and more traditional genres of the cello (in particular) and other string instruments used. Cellos and other stringed instruments are often amplified and/or modified electronically, and they are often played in a manner imitative of the sound of electric guitars. They are often combined with other elements typical of rock music such as rock-style vocals and drumming.

Cello rock can trace its beginnings to the 1971 self-titled debut, known in the US as &quot;No Answer&quot;, by the Electric Light Orchestra, which featured rock songs arranged for cellos, and the subsequent tour consisted of a standard rock band augmented by four cellos. Jeff Lynne made a return with this format using three cellos for their 2001 comeback album &quot;Zoom&quot; and its subsequent but cancelled tour. Apocalyptica, which released their first album, &quot;Plays Metallica by Four Cellos&quot;, in 1996, originally used only cellos but has since added drums and bass and sometimes vocals. Starting in 2011, the duo 2Cellos began releasing covers of many rock standards, such as AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;Thunderstruck&quot;, and undertaking tours.

<text>The 98th Infantry Division (&quot;Iroquois&quot;) was a unit of the United States Army in the closing months of World War I and during World War II. The unit is now one of the U.S. Army Reserve&#x27;s training divisions, officially known as the 98th Training Division (Initial Entry Training). Its primary mission is to conduct Initial Entry Training (IET) for new soldiers. It is one of three training divisions subordinate to the 108th Training Command (IET) and handles command and control of units throughout the eastern United States and in Puerto Rico.

Since its creation in 1918, the division has experienced multiple cycles of activation, training, deployment and deactivation as well as substantial reorganizations and changes of mission. Since 1959, the 98th has been a unit of the U.S. Army Reserve with the primary mission of training soldiers. Long headquartered in Rochester, New York, with historical ties to New York and New England, the division was moved in 2012 to Fort Benning (today Fort Moore), Georgia. 

==World War I==

On 23 July 1918, the War Department directed the organization of the 98th Division at Camp McClellan, Alabama. Plans called for the division to include a headquarters, headquarters troop, the 195th Infantry Brigade (389th and 390th Infantry Regiments and 368th Machine Gun Battalion), 196th Infantry Brigade (391st and 392nd Infantry Regiments and 369th Machine Gun Battalion), 367th Machine Gun Battalion, 173rd Field Artillery Brigade (367th-369th Field Artillery Regiments and 26th Trench Mortar Battery), 323rd Engineers, 623rd Field Signal Battalion, and 323rd Train Headquarters and Military Police (Ammunition, Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains). It was intended that the 195th Infantry Brigade would be organized in France from the 52nd and 53rd Pioneer Infantry Regiments. 

The 26th Trench Mortar Battery was formed at Del Rio, Texas, in August 1918 and was assigned to the 173rd Field Artillery Brigade, but never ended up joining. The organization of the division began in October with the appointment of Colonel Jennings B. Wilson as division chief of staff, but organization never progressed beyond the assignment of the division staff and preliminary preparations for the receipt of Selective Service men. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the 98th Division was ordered demobilized on 30 November 1918.

==Interwar period==

The 98th Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the XII Corps. The division was further allotted to the upstate area of New York as its home area. The division headquarters was organized on 18 August 1921 at the Federal Building in Syracuse, New York, and remained there until activated for World War II. The designated mobilization and training station for the division was the Syracuse Concentration Area for all elements except the division artillery units, which would mobilize at Pine Camp, New York. From 1928 to 1940, the commander of the Second Corps Area designated the commander of the 1st Division&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade to perform additional duties as the commanding general of the 98th Division.

The 98th Division headquarters was called to duty for training as a unit on a number of occasions, usually for command post exercises (CPXs). The headquarters usually trained with the staff of the 2nd Infantry Brigade at Madison Barracks, New York, 1924–30 (with the exception of the 1927 annual training at Fort Niagara), and at Fort Ontario, New York, 1931–39, after the 2nd Infantry Brigade headquarters was moved to that post. In December 1932, the division conducted a CPX at Plattsburg Barracks, New York, with the staffs of the 2nd Infantry Brigade and the 26th Infantry Regiment. 

The subordinate infantry regiments of the division generally held their summer training with the units of the 2nd Infantry Brigade at Plattsburg Barracks, Fort Niagara, or Fort Ontario. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Second and Third Corps Areas, usually with other units of the 1st Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained with the 7th Field Artillery at Pine Camp; the 323rd Engineer Regiment usually trained with the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 323rd Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 323rd Observation Squadron trained with the 5th Observation Squadron at Mitchel Field, New York. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Plattsburg Barracks and Fort Niagara each year. On a number of occasions, the division participated in Second Corps Area and First Army CPXs in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. The first of these CPXs was held by the Second Corps Area at Camp Dix, New Jersey, 7–21 July 1929, followed by several First Army CPXs in the years leading up to World War II.

Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the First Corps Area, the 98th Division did not participate in the various Second Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935, 1939, and 1940 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to full peace strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split. The 98th was ordered into active military service on 15 September 1942 at Camp Breckinridge, Kentucky, filling its ranks primarily with soldiers from New York and New England. The 98th spent the next 18 months training at Camp Breckinridge, Camp Forrest, Tennessee, and Camp Rucker, Alabama, for combat in the Pacific theater.

The roughly 19,590 soldiers of the 98th arrived in Oahu, Hawaii, on 19 April 1944, and relieved the 33rd Infantry Division of responsibility for the defense of the Hawaiian Islands. On 15 May 1945, the 98th was relieved of garrison duties by the 372nd Infantry Regiment, freeing them up to train for Operation Olympic, scheduled for 1 November 1945 as one of two planned invasions of Japan. Instead, the Japanese surrendered, and the 98th Infantry Division arrived in Japan on 27 September 1945. It served in Osaka as part of the occupying force until 16 February 1946 when the unit was inactivated.

Awards earned by 98th Infantry Division soldiers during this period include: Legion of Merit: 1; Soldier&#x27;s Medal: 8; Bronze Star: 146.

Commanding generals during World War II:

*Major General Paul L. Ransom (September 1942 – November 1943)
*Major General George W. Griner Jr. (November 1943 - 26 June 1944)
*Major General Ralph C. Smith (15 July 1944 – 30 August 1944)
*Major General Arthur M. Harper (22 October 1944 - 16 February 1946)

==Post-World War II==
On 18 April 1947, the Iroquois Division was reactivated in Rochester, New York, on reserve status and began training for combat in the new Cold War environment. It had been previously planned to be an airborne division. A note on the troop list nevertheless indicated that the unit was to be reorganized and redesignated as an airborne unit upon mobilization and was to train as such.

The reorganization of 1 May 1959 redesignated the 98th Infantry Division as the 98th Division (Training) and set the unit on a course lasting to the present - training Soldiers. The regimental heritage was retained with the 389th, 390th and 391st Infantry Regiments organized as Basic Combat Training (BCT) regiments and the 392nd Infantry Regiment organized as an Advanced Individual Training (AIT) regiment.

Additional changes occurred in 1968 with the movement toward a brigade-based structure: the 389th Infantry Regiment became the 1st Brigade (BCT), the 390th Infantry Regiment became the 2d Brigade (BCT) and the 392nd Infantry Regiment became the 3rd Brigade (AIT-Engineer), the only Engineer Pioneer training unit in the Army Reserve at the time. The 3rd Battalion/392nd Infantry Regiment/3rd Brigade was based in Hillcrest, New York and performed Engineer AIT training of Soldiers at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri during their annual two-week training periods throughout the Vietnam War. The changes of 1968 also ushered in the designation and training of Army Reserve Drill Sergeants, a significant and enduring innovation. Additional reorganization in 1994 redesignated the unit as the 98th Division (Institutional Training), a change in which the 98th retained its previous IET mission but also acquired the missions and force structure formerly associated with to the U.S. Army Reserve Forces schools. The 98th would maintain this basic organization and mission for the next 14 years.

==Post 9/11==
On 3 September 2004, the 98th Division received mobilization orders for Operation Iraqi Freedom. This mobilization was to be the first overseas deployment for the unit since World War II. The mission, known as the Foreign Army Training Assistance Command (FA-TRAC), consisted primarily of training the new Iraqi Army and Iraqi security forces. An expeditionary force of more than 700 Iroquois warriors were trained and equipped at four sites: Camp Atterbury, Fort Bliss, Fort Hood and Fort Benning.

The demands of Operation Iraqi Freedom required an accelerated training schedule which crammed as many warfighting skills as possible into a forty-one-day period. This was the 98th&#x27;s first substantial exposure to the asymmetric battlefield, requiring training in counterinsurgency techniques and preparing to face an opponent who did not fight along traditional fronts. The 98th made full use of the 33,000 acres at Camp Atterbury and marched everywhere. It was at Camp Atterbury that the advisory support teams (later renamed military training teams), the heart of the FA-TRAC mission, transformed to cohesive units in long days.

In fall 2004, the 98th Division arrived in Baghdad and filled the ranks of the Multinational Security Transition Command-Iraq (MNSTC-I), the unit charged with assisting the Iraqi government in developing, training and equipping the new Iraqi security forces. The unit used its pool of drill sergeant and instructor expertise to train Iraqi soldiers and officers to prescribed standards under the constant threat of insurgent attack and under austere conditions.

Instruction and support teams spread out across all points in Iraq from Al Kasik in the north to as far south as Umm Qasr. They established contact with Iraqi security units with the help of interpreters and helped build the six divisions of the new Iraqi Army. They also established officer and noncommissioned officer education schools at the Kirkush Military Training Base. They trained Iraqi police, the Highway Patrol, the special Police Commandos and the Iraqi Border Police.

The division also fielded soldiers to such other locations as Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, the Horn of Africa, Kuwait, Jordan and Afghanistan.

Five 98th Training Division soldiers were killed in action during the division&#x27;s deployment to Iraq in 2004–05.

==General==
Nickname: Iroquois.

Shoulder patch: The 98th Division Patch consists of a shield in the shape of the Great seal of the State of New York, with the head of an Iroquois Indian Chief. The five feathers represent the five original Iroquois nations: the Seneca, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga and Mohawk. The blue and orange-gold colors are those of the Dutch House of Nassau, the earliest settlers of New York State.
On 8 September 2012, the Armed Forces Reserve Center at Fort Benning, Georgia, where the unit is located, was memorialized in honor of Chaplain (Lieutenant Colonel) Elmer W. Heindl who had served in the 98th.

<text>Liam O&#x27;Flynn, Óg Flynn (, 15 September 1945 – 14 March 2018) was an Irish uilleann piper and Irish traditional musician. In addition to a solo career and as a member of Planxty, O&#x27;Flynn recorded with: Christy Moore, Dónal Lunny, Andy Irvine, Kate Bush, Mark Knopfler, The Everly Brothers, Emmylou Harris, Mike Oldfield, Mary Black, Enya and Sinéad O&#x27;Connor.

O&#x27;Flynn was acknowledged as Ireland&#x27;s foremost exponent of the uilleann pipes and brought the music of the instrument to a worldwide audience. In 2007, O&#x27;Flynn was named Musician of the Year at the TG4 Gradam Ceoil Awards, considered to be the foremost recognition given to traditional Irish musicians.

==Early life==
He was born 15 September 1945 in Kill, County Kildare, Ireland, to musical parents. His father, Liam, was a teacher and fiddle player. His mother, Maisie (née Scanlan), who came from a family of musicians from Clare, played and taught piano. From an early age, O&#x27;Flynn showed musical talent, and was encouraged to pursue his interest in the uilleann pipes by the piper Tom Armstrong. At the age of 11, he began taking classes with Leo Rowsome. He was also influenced by Willie Clancy and Séamus Ennis. In the 1960s, he began to receive recognition of his talent, winning prizes at the Oireachtas Festival and the Fleadh Cheoil. During his early years, he was sometimes billed as Liam Óg Ó Flynn.

==Music career==
In 1972, O&#x27;Flynn co-founded the Irish traditional music group Planxty, alongside Christy Moore, Andy Irvine and Dónal Lunny and remained a member throughout the band&#x27;s various incarnations. While Seán Ó Riada and The Chieftains had reinvigorated Irish traditional instrumental music in an ensemble format during the 1960s, Planxty built on that foundation and took it one step further. They brought a punch and vitality to acoustic music that drew heavily on O&#x27;Flynn&#x27;s piping virtuosity.

As O&#x27;Flynn grew in his skill as a musician and as he began to meet pipers like Willie Clancy and Séamus Ennis, he became acutely aware of his position in the tradition of piping. His subsequent close friendship with Ennis, which started as a master/pupil relationship, taught him that there was much more to being a piper than playing tunes. Liam noted: &quot;Seamus Ennis gave me much more than a bag of notes.&quot;

Following the break-up of Planxty in 1983, O&#x27;Flynn found work as a session musician with such prominent artists as The Everly Brothers, Enya, Kate Bush, Nigel Kennedy, Rita Connolly, and Mark Knopfler. He also worked on film scores, including &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1979) and &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; (1992). He was adventurous enough to work with avant-garde composer John Cage, but his most natural alliance was with neo-romantic composer Shaun Davey.

The Bothy Band were natural successors to the original Planxty, and one of its members, Matt Molloy, who subsequently joined The Chieftains, played with The Chieftains&#x27; fiddler Seán Keane on O&#x27;Flynn&#x27;s album, &quot;The Piper&#x27;s Call&quot;, which was performed in the 1999 Proms season at the Royal Albert Hall. He also worked on projects with Seamus Heaney, mixing poetry with music.

His name is mentioned in Christy Moore&#x27;s song &quot;Lisdoonvarna&quot;.

==Death==
O&#x27;Flynn died in Dublin on 14 March 2018 after a long illness.

==Legacy==
The Liam O&#x27;Flynn Award is awarded each year by the Arts Council and the National Concert Hall to recognise individual creativity in Traditional Irish music. Awardees include Úna Monaghan, Barry Kerr, Jack Talty, Louise Mulcahy and Strange Boy (aka Jordan Kelly).

<doc id="912205" wikidata="Q643635" url="?curid=912205" title="Nissan Skyline">
<text>The is a brand of automobile originally produced by the Prince Motor Company starting in 1957, and then by Nissan after the two companies merged in 1967. After the merger, the Skyline and its larger counterpart, the Nissan Gloria, were sold in Japan at dealership sales channels called &quot;Nissan Prince Shop&quot;.

The Skyline was largely designed and engineered by Shinichiro Sakurai from inception, and he remained a chief influence of the car until his death in 2011.

Skylines are available in either coupé, or sedan body styles, plus station wagon, crossover, convertible and pickup/sedan delivery body styles. The later models are most commonly known by their trademark round brake and tail lights. The majority of Skyline models are rear-wheel drive, with all-wheel drive being available since the debut of the eighth-generation Skyline (R32).

While not distributed in the United States until its importation as the Infiniti G-series in the early 2000s (the first generation Prince Skyline was imported, but sold poorly), the Skyline&#x27;s prominence (particularly for the GT-R variant) in video games, movies and magazines resulted in many such cars being brought in as grey import vehicles there, and makes up a large amount of second-hand Japanese car imports to Europe and North America.

Starting with the third-generation Skyline (C10) and up to the tenth-generation Skyline (R34), the chassis, suspension and some of the engines were shared with the luxury-oriented longer wheelbase Nissan Laurel. When the former Prince factory at Musashimurayama closed in 2002 (coinciding with the discontinuation of the Laurel that same year), the Skyline used the then-new FM platform that was shared with the 350Z starting with the eleventh-generation Skyline (V35).

The eleventh-generation Skyline (V35) was another major turning point for the nameplate, as it dropped some of the previous generation Skyline&#x27;s trademark characteristics such as the straight-six engine (replaced with a V6) and turbocharging (reintroduced in the thirteenth-generation/V37 model), and eventually separated the GT-R into its own line. Nissan decided to retain the Skyline for the luxury-sport market segment formerly held by the Laurel, while its platform-mate, the 350Z, revived the Z line of pure sports cars. The V35 was the first Skyline made for export to North America, being sold under Nissan&#x27;s luxury marque Infiniti as the G35 in 2002. The Skyline (V36/J50) is sold in Europe, North America, South Korea, Taiwan, and the Middle East as the Infiniti G37 and EX respectively.

, the Skyline is the only remaining sedan in Nissan&#x27;s Japanese lineup following the discontinuation of both the Fuga and Cima in 2022.



== First generation (Prince Skyline, 1957) ==
===ALSI-1 series===
The first Skyline was introduced on 24 April 1957, at the Takarazuka Theater, in Hibiya, Tokyo, for Fuji Precision Industries, marketed as a luxury car. It featured a 1.5 L (1,482 cc) &quot;GA-30&quot; engine (also known as FG4A-30) producing 44 kW (60 hp) at 4,400 rpm, which was previously used in the prototype Subaru 1500, Subaru&#x27;s first car. It used a de Dion tube rear suspension and was capable of . The car weighed around . Skylines were produced as four-door sedans and five-door station wagons. Two models were available: the ALSIS-1 standard and the ALSID-1 Deluxe. The ALSI-1&#x27;s appearance seems to be influenced by 1950s American cars (the front end was similar to the 1957 Chevrolet); the car featured rear tail fins, chrome molding and two-tone paint.

The ALSI-1 generation was sold in the United States, but did not sell well, and remain extremely rare. In 2020, a 1960 left-hand-drive model reappeared in an Idaho junkyard.

====ALSIS-1====
The ALSIS-1 standard model featured a grille with a large center bar with 6 vertical slats above it. The side strips ran straight from the rear of the car to the front doors, where it dipped into a V-shape, widening and kicked upwards until it hit the front of the car. The side badge said &quot;Skyline&quot;.

====ALSID-1 Deluxe====
The ALSID-1 Deluxe featured a different grille compared to the standard model. The large center bar was absent and instead a pair of fog lights are mounted just inside of the front turn signals. Between the fog lights &quot;PRINCE&quot; is spelled out in individual gold letters. A painted side strip, surrounded by a chrome strip ran horizontally the length of the car, widening from front to back. On this side strip was the side badge, which said &quot;Skyline Deluxe&quot;.

The Skyline also spawned the ALPE double cab pickup truck and the ALVE delivery van, both marketed as the Skyway.

===ALSI-2 series===
The ALSI-2 series was released in October 1959 and was nearly identical to the ALSI-1 series except for the engine. Higher quality fuel allowed for an increase in compression and a power increase to . This new engine was designated the FG4A-40 (this engine was also known as the GA-4).

The ALSI-2-1 series was released in February 1960. The Deluxe, along with the commercial variants, were updated with quad headlights (the standard model retained the twin headlights). The side strip design was changed on standard models; the V-shape in the side strip was moved from the front doors to the rear doors. On Deluxe models the side strip design remained the same. The standard model gained quad headlights in September 1960 with the release of the ALSI-2-2 series.

===BLSI-3 series===
The BLSI-3 series was released in May 1961. The 1500 engine used in the ALSID Deluxe was dropped and instead used the 1.9L GB-4 (also known as FG4B-40) OHV four-cylinder engine from the Gloria. The BLSI series was otherwise identical to the ALSI series, except for a &quot;1900&quot; badge on the side. The standard model received the new engine in October 1961.

Commercial variants remained available, also equipped with the new engine.

===S21 series===
The S21 series was released in September 1962. It was in production until November 1963. The front end was redesigned in an attempt to update the look of the car. The result was rather unsuccessful as the car now looked like a 1950s body with a 1960s front end. The S21 continued to use the 1.9L GB-4 engine.

The 3-door van was dropped and replaced with a 5-door station wagon; a double cab pickup truck remained available.

====BLRA-3 Skyline Sport====
The S21 Deluxe-based Skyline Sport featured hand-built Michelotti bodies in stylish coupe and convertible versions. These cars used the 1.9 L &quot;GB-4&quot; engine from the S21D. While only a few hundred were built, Prince Motors had a very aggressive product placement group and they can be seen (along the company&#x27;s mainstream models) in many Toho films of the early 1960s. The canted headlights reflected a similar appearance on the late 1950s through early 1960s Lincoln Continental, Buick, and Chrysler 300. The appearance is similar to the 1960s Lancia Flavia and Triumph Vitesse as Michelotti did contribute to Lancia vehicles during this time; Giugiaro&#x27;s design of the short-lived Gordon Keeble GT was similarly influenced. Being the first sports-focused model, the Skyline Sport foreshadowed the Skyline GT-R sub-range; its luxurious appearance would later be implemented in its future platform-mate twin, the Laurel.

== Second generation (Prince Skyline, 1963) ==
===S50===

In 1961 Fuji Precision Industries changed its name to Prince Motor Company (for the second time). Two years later, in September 1963, the S50 Skyline Deluxe (S50D-1) was launched, followed by the Skyline Standard (S50S-1) in April 1964. This was the second generation car, and became one of the more desirable cars in Japan. It was powered by the &quot;G-1&quot; engine, a 68 hp or version of the old GA-4. The S50 series were available with a three-speed column shift transmission, or a four-speed floor shift transmission from February 1965 (Deluxe only). A two-speed automatic option was added to the Deluxe in June 1966. The lower priced and equipped Standard model was added in April 1964; aiming at taxi operators and others it also lacked bumper overriders, making it 11 cm shorter. Three main models of the S50 were built: the S50-1 (1964–1966), the lightly facelifted S50-2 (1966–1967) and the S50-3 (1967–1968). These all used the same engine, with the later S57 receiving a more modern unit.

Externally, the S50-1 was installed with rounded brake lights and integrated tail lights, with a centrally installed turn signal, similar in appearance to the Ford Galaxie of 1961. The significant appearance change from the previous generation seems to reflect a similar approach done by German company BMW in 1962 with the New Class series, in deciding to build a small, affordable, performance coupe and sedan.

The S50 was sold in some markets with an &quot;A150&quot; designation. In European markets (and other export markets), it was also marketed as the PMC-Mikado A150. The S50 also saw exports to Hawaii. The S50-2 was also sold as the S56SE A190D for export markets in Europe and Asia (such as in British Hong Kong), which was equipped with the 1.9 liter D-6 OHV diesel engine. This model had trim and equipment levels similar to the S50S-2. In Europe, period testers commented on the car&#x27;s compact size (more like a 1.0 than a 1.5) and its sprightly performance, in large part due to the extremely low gearing. The car&#x27;s ample lighting was also noted, offering twin headlights, a bevy of warning lamps, numerous engine room light fittings, etcetera. Also lauded were the cars road manners, as evident by the six-cylinder Skyline&#x27;s competition successes.

In August 1966, Nissan and Prince merged and the S50 also appeared with Nissan Prince Skyline badging. In October 1966, the S50-2 was introduced. This light facelift included a new grille and rectangular taillights, as well as changes to the interior, and with the addition of an extraction vent on the C-pillar. It was sold as Prince Skyline, Prince A150, or PMC A150, depending on the market. All &quot;Prince&quot; dealership locations were added to the existing Nissan/Datsun Japanese dealerships, while retaining the Prince name to become the &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot;.

In August 1967 the S50-3 was introduced. The tail lights and front side indicators were changed to a wider rectangular shape, but otherwise the car remained identical to the S50-2 series. The S50-3 was the last Prince model to use the G-1 engine. The Deluxe trim was rebranded as the S57 series.

===S54===
Prince launched the racing version of the Skyline, the Skyline GT in May 1964. It was based on the S50D-1 and used the &quot;G-7&quot; engine from the Gloria S41, though the car needed a extension to the wheelbase (all forward of the cowl) to provide space in the engine bay for the inline six. It entered the second Japanese Grand Touring II (GT-II) on 3 May 1964 and they hoped to win the race. Competing against the Porsche 904, the Skyline GTs managed second through to sixth places. Only 100 units S54A-1 were made for homologation purpose (92 road cars and 8 racing cars) and sold out instantly due to the success of the race vehicle. The S54A-1 was available with the standard single carburetor (G7-A) 2.0-liter inline-six engine (producing and ), 4-speed manual transmission and tachometer as standard. The triple Webber carburetors, a LSD, 5-speed manual transmission, sport steering wheel and oil cooler were available as additional options.

In February 1965, the Prince Skyline 2000GT road car (S54B-2) was released to the Japanese market, followed by the less powerful 2000GT-A (S54A-2) in September on the same year and S54B-2 model was renamed to 2000GT-B.

The GT-B model featured three Weber 40DCOE-18 carburetors (G7-B; producing at 5,600 rpm and at 4,400 rpm), rear torsion bar suspension, Nardi steering wheel, power brakes and front disc brakes as standard. The cheaper GT-A did not receive Nardi steering wheel, booster brakes, front disc brakes and rear wheel torque rod. Both models could get additional options such as safety belts, radio, heather, bigger fuel tank, a LSD, 5-speed close ratio manual transmission and racing suspension kits.

In October 1966, the GT received mild facelift similar to S50D-2, but retained its original round taillights. This model was known as S54-3. Still with similar equipment as S54-2, except for seat belts and 5-speed manual transmission (GT-B only) that became standard.

The South Australian versions both used the S54B engine, the difference was in the gearbox, the GT-A had a 4-speed gearbox, and the GT-B had the European ZF 5-speed gearbox.

===S57===
In August 1967 Prince released the successor of the S50D-2 called the S57. It used a new engine of Prince&#x27;s (designed before the merger with Nissan), the OHC 1.5 L (1,483 cc) G15. At , it was the most-powerful engine in the Japanese 1,500 cc class. The S57D was almost identical to the S50S-3 except for using different grille with a red &quot;88&quot; badge (for 88 PS) and an &quot;OHC&quot; badge above the right side reversing light. The trunk badge said &quot;Prince&quot; and the side badges said &quot;Skyline 1500&quot; or &quot;Skyline 1500 Deluxe&quot;. There was a &quot;NISSAN&quot; badge of the left side of the grille as well as well as below the left side backup light. After the Prince name was dropped, the &quot;NISSAN&quot; badge under the backup light disappeared (the badge on the grille remained), and the &quot;Prince&quot; badges were replaced by &quot;NISSAN&quot;, but the stylized &quot;P&quot; emblem on the hood remained.

== Third generation (C10; 1968) ==
The C10 series of August 1968, which began its development under Prince at the company&#x27;s Ogikubo R&amp;D centre in the suburbs of Tokyo, was marketed with a Nissan badge. By the time the C10 went on sale, the Prince nameplate had been completely phased out on cars and trucks. The dealer network selling the cars became the Prince channel of Nissan, and the marketing group stayed at the Prince headquarters in Mita instead of moving to Nissan&#x27;s headquarters in Ginza.

The C10 Skyline was launched with Prince&#x27;s 1.5 L OHC &quot;G15&quot; I4 like the S57. A 1.8 L &quot;G18&quot; version was also available. A station wagon variant, known previously as the Prince Skyway, was offered with this generation. A hardtop coupé was introduced in October 1970. The Skyline chassis and suspension was now shared with the all-new, luxury-oriented, and longer wheelbase Laurel and was unique to the &quot;Nissan Store&quot; as a junior companion to the executive limousine Nissan President. The suspension used MacPherson struts for the front wheels and Semi-trailing arm independent suspension for the rear wheels.

The brake- and tail-lights were modified to square units, but now included dual units for both the left and right side of the vehicle. As the Skyline was now a Nissan product, it was repositioned above the Bluebird as a more sport-oriented sedan and coupe, while the Bluebird was unique to &quot;Nissan Store&quot; locations. Its appearance shows some resemblance to the earlier 1961 Fiat 2300, designed by Pininfarina.

===2000GT===

In October 1968 the GC10 2000GT&#x27;s engine power was decreased to , Nissan introduced an automatic variant in June 1970, as well as a 2-door coupe in October 1970.

===2000GT-X===
In September 1971, the KGC10 2000 GT-X received a 2.0 L (1,998 cc) L20SU straight-six engine instead of the Prince G-7 engine. The chassis was already designed to fit a straight six, to avoid the S54 extension problem. was available from this new engine. In March 1972 the lineup was expanded to include a four-door GT-X sedan.

===GT-R===

The first GT-R Skyline appeared in February 1969. Called the PGC-10 (KPGC-10 for later coupé version) internally and &quot;Hakosuka&quot; (ハコスカ) by fans. &quot;Hako&quot; (ハコ) means &quot;box&quot; in Japanese, and &quot;suka&quot; (スカ) is short for &quot;Skyline&quot; (スカイライン; &quot;Sukairain&quot;). It used the 2.0 L (1998 cc) &quot;S20&quot; I6. This new DOHC engine (which was designed by the former Prince engineers) produced and of torque, and was similar to the &quot;GR8&quot; engine used in the Prince R380 racing car.

The GT-R began as a sedan, but a 2-door coupé version was debuted in October 1970 and introduced in March 1971. The cars were stripped of unnecessary equipment to be as light as possible for racing, and performed well at the track. The sedan racked up 33 victories in less than two years, and the coupé stretched this to 50 through 1972.

The C10 raced against many cars including the Toyota 1600GT, Isuzu Bellett GTR, Mazda Familia (R100) &amp; Capella (RX-2) – even Porsche. In late 1971 the new Mazda RX-3 became the GT-R&#x27;s main rival. The GT-R managed a few more victories before the RX-3 ended the GT-R&#x27;s winning streak.

== Fourth generation (C110; 1972) ==


The C110 generation was produced from September 1972 through August 1977. For export in the 1970s, the C110 and GC110 Skyline was sold as the Datsun K-series, with models such as the Datsun 160K, 180K and Datsun 240K.

The body styles were, once again, four-door sedan, two-door hardtop coupé, and five-door station wagon. The C110 was more fussy in its styling than its predecessor, particularly so in wagon form, where unusually for a wagon design, no windows were fitted between the C and D pillars. The C110 was the first version to return to the round rear tail and brake lights introduced in 1963 albeit with dual units from the previous generation, and the appearance has become a traditional Skyline feature. The styling also influenced a smaller, more affordable two-door coupe, called the Silvia, introduced in 1975. Nissan introduced its emission control technology, primarily consisting of fuel injection on trim packages ending with an &quot;E&quot;, using the moniker Nissan NAPS also in 1975. In February 1976, the model was facelifted and became C111 model.

The C110 Skyline was better known as the &quot;Ken &amp; Mary&quot; or &quot;Kenmeri&quot; (ケンメリ) Skyline, stemming from the advertisement campaign in Japan at the time which featured a young couple (Ken and Mary) who relaxed and enjoyed the countryside in &quot;Ken and Mary&#x27;s Skyline&quot; (ケンとメリーのスカイライン). The ads were highly successful and perhaps as a result the C110 was sold in very large numbers in Japan. Kenmeri was also a play on the term &quot;Meriken&quot; (メリケン) an old Japanese slang term for &quot;American&quot; due to the new Skyline&#x27;s resemblance of American muscle cars of the time.

It sold just as well in Australia (in a 2.4L 6-cylinder form, badged as &quot;Datsun 240K&quot;). There, the 240K was about the same price as a Ford Falcon GT or BMW 5 Series, around AUD$5000.

===GT-R===

The Skyline GT-R hardtop arrived in September 1972 but only lasted until March 1973, when Nissan ceased its production. The 1973 oil crisis saw many people preferring economy cars and high-performance sports cars were looked down upon. Nissan pulled out of Motor Racing shortly afterwards, and so there was no purpose for the GT-R. It was not officially exported anywhere, although Nissan contemplated exporting to Australia. Only 197 KPGC110 GT-Rs were ever sold in Japan through specialist Nissan Performance shops (before it was called NISMO). This was the last GT-R for 16 years until the BNR32 in 1989.

== Fifth generation (C210; 1977) ==
The succeeding C210 series of August 1977 continued to split the Skyline range into basic four-cylinder and six-cylinder models, the latter with a longer wheelbase and front end. This line continued through August 1981. A rare variant would be the wagon version, which had a unique styling treatment behind the rear doors, of a much smaller window than usual between the C and D pillars. The Skyline received an internal and external facelift in late 1978, which led to a change of the model code from 210 to 211. This was also when the Skyline first appeared in several European export markets, such as Germany.

The GT-EX replaced the discontinued GT-R with a turbocharged engine, the L20ET. As installed in the recently renewed Nissan Cedric/Gloria, this had been the first turbo engine to power a Japanese production vehicle. One notable aspect of the turbo versions was that they were not intercooled and there was no form of blowoff valve, only an emergency pressure release valve. As usual with Japanese cars of this period, there were four- or five-speed manuals and a three-speed automatic, with a column-shifted three-speed manual available on lower end cars and vans. The lowest powered option was the 2-liter LD20 diesel fitted to the Skyline Van 200D (VSC211D); it produces at 4600 rpm.

The L-series engines were all switched to the cross-flow Z-series in late 1978, although the L16 soldiered on a little longer in the commercial versions. The larger 2.4-liter inline-six was never offered in the domestic Japanese market; having been reserved for export. Export engines were rated in DIN horsepower, so while a Japanese-spec L24 promised , European market cars with the same engine only claimed . On the other hand, European buyers could also get the fuel injected L24E with DIN, about on par with what the turbocharged GT-EX offered. Originally marketed as the Datsun 240K-GT in Europe, the fuel injected version was sold as the Datsun Skyline in most markets where it was available. It has a claimed top speed of . In June 1980, the two-liter, fuel injected inline-four Z20E engine was added to the lineup, as was the 2.8 liter straight-six GT-Diesel with .

The &quot;T&quot; designation on the L16T and L18T designates twin carburetors. On the L20ET and later engines, &quot;T&quot; designates a turbo engine instead.

Models:
* 1600TI – 1.6 L &quot;L16&quot; I4, , 
* 1600TI – 1.6 L &quot;Z16&quot; I4, , 
* 1800TI – 1.8 L &quot;Z18&quot; I4, , - the similar L18 received a claimed DIN in European export markets.

* Datsun 240K-GT – 2.4 L &quot;L24&quot; I6, DIN, , , 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 13.5 s.

== Sixth generation (R30; 1981) ==

The names were brought into line with the home Japanese and worldwide markets with the launch of the R30 series in August 1981, which was built on a C31 Laurel platform. Unlike preceding generations, four- and six-cylinder versions now shared a front end of the same length. The R30 was available as a two-door hardtop coupé, a four-door sedan, a five-door Liftback (available only in the R30 generation), or a four-door station wagon. In all, there were 26 variations of the R30 Skyline available.

All versions with the exception of the wagon were usually fitted with the four round tail lights that had become a regular feature to the Skyline&#x27;s design. The wagon had different tail lights, headlights, and no turbo or six-cylinder versions available. It more closely resembled a Nissan Sunny than a Skyline. The two-door coupé had a hardtop, pillarless design, and featured roll-down quarter windows for the rear seat passengers (a styling feature of the previous C10, C110, and C211 coupés), while four-door versions had a traditional sedan body style with framed windows. The crease that appeared over the rear wheels beginning with the second generation, referred to as the &quot;surf line&quot;, no longer appeared starting with this generation.

Various engine configurations were available, initially ranging from the top-of-the-line 103 kW SOHC 6-cylinder turbo &quot;L20ET&quot; to the 4-cylinder Z18S and 6-cylinder LD28 diesel versions at the other end of the scale. The all-new 16-valve DOHC &quot;FJ20&quot; engine debuted in late 1981, and was the first four-cylinder engine from any Japanese manufacturer to employ more than two valves per cylinder (see below). Some of the top spec models featured adjustable suspension dampers that could be adjusted while driving, this was another first for mass-produced JDM vehicles. Nissan Glorias and Laurels also used the L series engines, as well as some diesel (Laurel only) variants.

The R30 range was facelifted in August 1983 with various changes across the board; for example four-wheel disc brakes were now standard issue, instead of being optional for lower-spec models. Trim specifications were revised and the 4-cylinder Z18S engine was replaced with the newer CA18E. Features included upgraded interior trim, new front and rear bumpers, door-mounted wing mirrors (replacing the old &#x27;hockey stick&#x27; fender mirrors), and smoked tail lights.

During 1983 the &quot;Paul Newman Version&quot; R30 was released to commemorate the association between Nissan and the actor Paul Newman, who used to appear in promotional material, as well as race for the company during the late-1970s and early-1980s. The Newman Skyline was simply a top spec GT-ES turbo with signature embroidery and decals.

Export markets also received some larger (albeit less powerful) engines, in the form of 2.4 and 2.8 liter inline-sixes with Hitachi double carburetors, producing or . The 2.8 was added in September 1982.

===Australia===
Nissan Australia launched the R30 sedan in November 1981, with standard air conditioning, AM/FM radio cassette stereo, digital clock, intermittent wipers, five-speed manual or optional three-speed automatic. This was fully imported from Japan. The Liftbacks were released to the market in August 1982. The facelift model launched in Australia during November 1983. Notably, configurations of the R30 sold in Australia and New Zealand were missing the traditional hotplate tail lights, instead opting for more conventional styling.

===South Africa===
When entering the South African market in late 1982, Skylines were still sold as Datsuns. About a year after being introduced, the Nissan changeover took place. In addition to 2-liter models (sedans and liftbacks), the R30 Datsun Skyline was also available with the 2.8-liter &quot;six&quot; in the GTX Hardtop (the only coupé on offer). Along with the Nissan nameplate the four-door 2.8 GLX was added, using a two-barrel Hitachi carburetor. There was also a GL version, and in May 1984 the four-door GT version arrived. This was sportier than the GLX, benefitting from the GTX suspension and a Weber carburetor, but cost less than the GTX due to less equipment and having drums at the rear. The South African range was lightly facelifted for the 1986 model year, with a luxurious 2.8 SGL replacing the GLX and with the GT discontinued. Automatic transmission became available in the GTX Hardtop and also in the top-of-the-line SGLi sedan (which was not offered with a manual). The R30 was replaced by the R31 Skyline in mid-1987.

2-liter cars have the four-cylinder L20B engine; equipment levels include GL, and GLE-X, and there was also the Skyline 1800 L at the bottom of the ladder.

===RS===

Although making about the same power as the L20ET-powered &quot;GT-ES&quot; models, the version of the Skyline initially known as the &quot;2000RS&quot; was released on 2 October 1981 as more of a stripped-down lightweight racer, without as many luxury extras included (quoted curb weight was only ). These were equipped with the naturally aspirated 4-valve-per-cylinder DOHC FJ20E engine generating of power at 6,000 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm. The official Nissan chassis designation for all FJ20-powered models was &quot;DR30&quot;.

In February 1983 the DR30 range received a significant boost in performance with the introduction of the turbocharged FJ20ET engine in the &quot;2000RS-Turbo&quot;. Front brakes were also significantly upgraded to cope with the power increase. Now with of power at 6,400 rpm (measured on a gross basis) and of torque at 4,800 rpm on tap, the FJ20ET enjoyed new-found prestige as the most powerful Japanese production engine of its era.

Nissan sought to elevate the status of the DR30 Skyline as their new flagship model in light of this success, and it received a generous amount of changes to distinguish it from lesser Skyline models in August 1983. Interior equipment was significantly upgraded to now include electric windows, air conditioning and power steering as standard in the new &quot;RS-X&quot; model (for Extra) with an increased curb weight of around it also included a driver&#x27;s seat with multi-way power lumbar adjustment, anti-skid control, fog lamps, rear deck spoiler and other features such as dimmable instrument cluster lighting; gone were the days of the spartan, stripped-out race interior, although this could still be specified at time of purchase. But by far the most striking change to the RS was the new unique front end treatment, nicknamed &quot;Tekkamen&quot; () or &quot;Iron Mask&quot; by fans for its distinctive look. The headlights were considerably slimmer, and instead of a conventional grille the hood now sloped down to two narrow slits above a facelifted front bumper and airdam.

Further enhancements were made for 1984, most notably the addition of an air-to-air intercooler allowing the compression ratio to be increased from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1 with revised turbocharger exhaust housing to the FJ20ET powered model increasing output to of power at 6,400 rpm (gross) and of torque at 4,400 rpm. The intercooled model was nicknamed the &quot;Turbo C&quot;. The &quot;Turbo C&quot; formed the basis for the Super Silhouette race car built by GT-R Works and sponsored by Tomica and run in the All Japan Sports Prototype Championship under FIA Group C regulations.

An automatic transmission option was also added 1984. Changes to the &quot;Plasma Spark&quot; ignition system followed in early 1985 towards the end of R30 production.

To this day the FJ20-powered R30 Skyline remains a cult car both at home and overseas (there are still dedicated &quot;one make&quot; drag racing events for this model in Japan), and is credited with rejuvenating the Skyline brand in the early 1980s. It also paved the way for the eventual re-introduction of the legendary GT-R badge, markedly absent since the end of C110 Skyline production in 1973.

The DR30 achieved success in Australian touring car racing during the mid-1980s. The factory backed Peter Jackson Nissan Team made its Group A debut in the opening round of the 1986 Australian Touring Car Championship, and over the 10 round series, lead driver George Fury would win four of the rounds and it was only unreliability in the first two rounds that cost Fury the title, finishing only 5 points behind the Volvo 240T of Robbie Francevic. Fury then went on to finish second to the BMW of Jim Richards in the 1986 Australian Endurance Championship, winning four of the six rounds, though failures to finish in the opening round at Amaroo Park in Sydney, as well as a DNF at the James Hardie 1000 at Bathurst cost him the title. Team driver Garry Scott put the DR30 on pole for the James Hardie 1000 before going on to finish third with young charger Glenn Seton. Despite missing out on the drivers&#x27; title, Nissan won the 1986 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship from BMW. Fury finished off 1986 by finishing second to the V8 Holden Commodore of Allan Grice in the Group A support race for the Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide.

Fury was joined in 1987 Australian Touring Car Championship by Glenn Seton. While Fury had a frustrating first half of the championship, Seton battled it out with the BMW M3 of Richards for the title. The series came down to the last race at Sydney&#x27;s Oran Park Raceway where Richards used the nimble M3 to defeat Seton and win his second ATCC in three years. With Fury finishing third in the championship, this saw Nissan sharing victory with BMW in the 1987 Australian Manufacturers&#x27; Championship. The final competitive race for the Peter Jackson Nissan DR30s came in the Group A support race for the 1987 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where Fury again finished second behind the Ford Sierra RS500 of Dick Johnson.

The DR30 continued to be used by privateer racers in Australian touring car racing until 1989.

== Seventh generation (R31; 1985) ==



The R31 Skyline of 1985 was a natural evolution on the R30 shape, and also this one was loosely based on the Laurel platform (C32). The design was slightly larger and squarer than previous Skylines. It was available as a Sedan, Hardtop sedan, Coupé and station wagon. Affectionately known as the &quot;Seventhsu&quot; or simply &quot;7th Sukairain&quot; by owners, due to it being the 7th-generation Skyline.

The R31 Skyline introduced many new technologies and features. The HR31 was the first Skyline to be equipped with the new RB-series of engines. The HR31 RB engines are often referred to as &quot;Red Top&quot; engines because of the red cam covers. There were three variants. The earliest series of DOHC, 24-valve, RB engines used the NICS (Nissan Induction Control System) injection system with 12 very small intake runners, and a butterfly system to divide the intake ports in half for better low RPM performance. Later versions used ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) engine management, discarded the twelve tiny runners for six much larger ones (though the cylinder heads still retained twelve individual intake ports separated by casting), and received a slightly larger turbocharger. Nissan&#x27;s &quot;RD28&quot;, a 2.8 straight-six engine, featured for a diesel option. Another technological first for the R31 was the introduction of Nissan&#x27;s proprietary four-wheel steering system, dubbed HICAS (High Capacity Active Steering). The R31 series were also the only models in the Skyline family to feature a four-door hardtop variation. These models were generally badged as the &quot;Passage GT&quot;; a luxury approach of this variation was also used by its platform twin Laurel on a shorter wheelbase.

The R31 Skyline was also produced in Australia, with a 3.0 L motor (RB30E) available in sedan or wagon form, as well as a four-cylinder version called the Nissan Pintara. The wagon had the same front style as the coupe and sedan—the only difference being that it lacked the four round brake lights that had been a consistent element of Skyline design (except for the R31 series one/two which had rectangular taillights with a solid bar through the centre which was also shared by the Pintara). These cars were manufactured in Australia due to the heavy import laws which made it expensive to bring cars into Australia.

29,305 R31 Skylines were also manufactured and sold in South Africa in four-door sedan form between 1987 and 1992. These were the last Skylines seen in South Africa. Power came from either the RB30E 3.0 straight-six engine, RB20E 2.0 straight-six, or the CA20S four-cylinder powerplant.

The R31 Skyline were also sold in some Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait and Oman. Sold in sedan or coupe form, it was available with either a carburetted or fuel injected versions of the RB30 3.0-liter straight 6. This was the final generation of the Skyline to be sold officially in the region until it was reintroduced later with the 11th generation under the Infiniti brand.

===GTS-R===
The ultimate version of the R31 was the RB20DET-R powered HR31 GTS-R Coupe of which 823 units were built to allow an homologation &quot;evolution&quot; mode for Group A Touring Car racing. Introduced in late 1987, it had a reworked version of the normal RB20DET with a much larger turbocharger on a tubular steel exhaust manifold, as well as a much larger front-mounted intercooler. It had a factory-claimed maximum output of , with racing versions making over in Group A trim, though this was still at least less than the leading Group A car of the time, the Ford Sierra RS500 (which had approximately the same weight as the Nissan), and around less than the heavier (by around ) V8 Holden Commodore.

Jim Richards and Mark Skaife drove a Gibson Motor Sport prepared Skyline GTS-R to win the 1989 Sandown 500 in Australia. Richards also used the GTS-R in 6 of the 8 races to win the 1990 Australian Touring Car Championship (he used the R32 GT-R in the final two rounds of the series). It was the first Australian Touring Car Championship victory for a Nissan driver after George Fury placed second in 1983 and 1986 and Glenn Seton gained second position in 1987.

== Eighth generation (R32; 1989) ==


The R32 Skyline debuted in 1989. It was available as either a 2-door coupe or 4-door hardtop sedan, all other bodystyles were dropped. The R32 featured several versions of the RB-series straight-6 engines, which had improved heads (the twelve port inlet was gone) and used the ECCS (Electronically Concentrated Control System) injection system. Also available was an 1,800 cc 4-cylinder &quot;GXi&quot; model. Most models had HICAS four-wheel steering, with the rear wheels being hydraulically linked to the front steering. The 2.5-liter GTS-25 became one of the first Japanese production cars to feature a 5-speed automatic transmission. The GTS-t came in standard and Type M configurations, with the Type M having larger five-stud 16-inch wheels, four piston front calipers and twin piston rears plus other minor differences. ABS was optional (except for the GT-R and GTS-4), mechanical LSD was standard on the GT-R and viscous LSD was standard on all turbo models and optional on all but the GXi. Nissan also produced 100 Australian models of the R32. In addition, there was a 4WD version of the GTS-t Type M, called the GTS-4.

This generation was considered a &quot;compact&quot; under Japanese legislation that determined the amount of tax liability based on exterior dimensions. The smaller engines were offered so as to provide Japanese buyers the ability to choose which annual road tax obligation they were willing to pay. The station wagon body style was discontinued, and would not see a replacement (the Stagea) until 1996, by which point the R33 had arrived.

===GT-R===


The R32 GT-R was first produced in 1988 including prototype cars. The first six Nismos were built in 1989. The other 554 NISMO GT-Rs were all built in 1990 and were all Gunmetal Grey in color.
The RB26DETT engine actually produced ≈320 PS (316 hp), but it was understated due to the Japanese car makers&#x27; &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s agreement&quot; not to exceed 280 PS (276 hp). The engine was designed for ≈500 hp in racing trim, and then muzzled by the exhaust, boost restriction, and ECU.
After this increase the car would put out ≈310 hp (≈230 kW) and could do 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 12.8 seconds.

The GT-R had a significantly larger intercooler, larger brakes, and aluminum front guards and hood. Other distinguishing features include flared front and rear wheel arches. More supportive seats were fitted, and the turbo boost gauge and digital clock were removed from inside the instrument cluster. The clock was replaced with a torque meter that indicated how much torque was being delivered to the front wheels (0%–50%). Oil temp, voltage, and turbo boost gauges were fitted just above the climate control.

The Porsche 959 was Nissan&#x27;s target when designing the GT-R. The chief engineer, Naganori Ito, intended to use the car for Group A racing, so the design specification was drawn up in conjunction with a copy of the Group A rules. The Nordschleife production car record at the time of development was 8&#x27;45&quot; – set by a Porsche 944. Nissan test driver Hiroyoshi Katoh reset the record with a time of 8&#x27;20&quot;. Best Motoring managed 8&#x27;22&quot;38.

The R32 GT-R dominated Japanese Touring Car Championship (JTCC), winning 29 races from 29 starts, taking the series title every year from 1989 to 1993. It took 50 races from 50 starts from 1991 to 1997 (latterly R33) in the N1 Super Taikyu.

The R32 GT-R was introduced into the Australian Touring Car Championship in 1990 and promptly ended the reign of the previously all-conquering Ford Sierra Cosworth, winning Bathurst 1000 classic in 1991 and 1992. This success led to the Australian motoring press nicknaming the car Godzilla due to it being a &quot;monster from Japan&quot;. As Australia was the first export market for the car the name quickly spread. Such was the GT-R&#x27;s dominance that it was a significant factor in the demise of Group A Touring Car racing, the formula being scrapped soon after. JTCC was similarly blighted by the R32 GT-R, and splintered soon after, leading to the switch to the Supertouring category and also indirectly to the GT500 category of today.

When originally designed, the homologation rulebook mandated 16-inch wheels, so that&#x27;s what the GT-R got. This limited the size of the brakes, and the four-piston calipers used by Nissan were not competitive. After the rules changed to allow 17-inch wheels, the GT-R V-spec (for Victory) emerged in February 1993 wearing 17&quot; BBS mesh wheels (225/50/17) covering larger Brembo calipers. The clutch actuation changed from a push to a pull system and the car had a standard mechanical rear differential (the electronic rear differential did not show up until the R33 V-Spec). A year later, the V-Spec II appeared with a new sticker and wider tires (245/45 17).

The Nismo Skyline GT-R is a limited (500 street, 60 racing) version of Nissan Skyline with Nissan RB engine with twin steel turbochargers rated at 6,800 rpm and at 4,400 rpm, HICAS all-wheel steering, electronically controlled ATTESA all-wheel drive.

In August 2014, the first R32 Skyline GT-Rs became eligible for US import under the NHTSA &quot;25 year&quot; rule, which allows vehicles that are at least 25 years old (to the month of manufacture) to be imported. These vehicles, due to their age do not have to comply with federal emissions or with federal motor vehicle safety standards.

== Ninth generation (R33; 1993) ==
The R33 Skyline was introduced in August 1993. Slightly heavier than the R32, it was again available in coupé and sedan body configurations. The R33 was the safest of the models with a rating of 3.8 out of 5.5 accordingly; the airbag system and internal crash bars made this vehicle significantly safer than previous models. All models now used a six-cylinder engine. Nissan took the unusual step of down-grading the GTS model to have only the &quot;RB20E&quot;, this was mated to either a 5 speed manual or an optional 5 speed automatic. The twin-cam unit of the R32 GTS was discontinued and so was the 2.0 L turbo &quot;RB20DET&quot; from the GTS-t, this was replaced with the GTS-25t which was equipped with the larger RB25DET and mated to either a 5 speed manual or an optional 4 speed automatic, the 5 speed auto was not used as it wasn&#x27;t strong enough for the extra power. HICAS was standard in all GTS-25t sub-models except the Type G.

Some models came equipped with a new version of the HICAS four-wheel steering system called Super HICAS. This computer controlled system was first used on the R32 GT-R. Super HICAS used electric actuators to steer the rear, as opposed to the hydraulic HICAS. This generation was no longer considered a &quot;compact&quot; under Japanese legislation that determined the amount of tax liability based on exterior dimensions.

As an option, an active limited slip differential was available instead of the standard viscous LSD. This new unit locked the rear differential if it detected that traction was lost by one of the wheels. A light on the dash also lit up if the LSD engaged. Active LSD came standard on all V-Spec R33 GT-R Skylines and was also available on some ECR33 GTS-25t models; these can be identified by the A-LSD and SLIP lights on the tachometer.

The &quot;RB25DE&quot; and &quot;RB25DET&quot; engines also became equipped with NVCS (variable inlet cam phasing). NVCS equipped RB series engine have a bulge on the front of the cam cover. To celebrate their 40th anniversary, Nissan introduced a very rare four-door GT-R. Two versions of the GT-R sedan were available from Nissan&#x27;s subsidiaries: the first was produced by Autech, and the second was a joint Autech/Nismo project.

A Nissan Laurel C34-based wagon was released in September 1996, called the Stagea. It is widely regarded as a compatriot of the Skyline, rather than the Laurel it was based on, owing to drivetrain configurations — commonly AWD, using ATTESA ET-S. A common modification on the Stagea is to fit it with an R34 skyline front, in effect making an R34-lookalike wagon. A manual transmission was only available on the RS-Four S and 260RS models. There was also an Autech tuned Stagea, the 260RS; released with full GT-R running gear including the RB26DETT engine and manual transmission, a unique body kit, 17&quot; BBS style alloys, and GT-R instrumentation.

=== 1996 facelift===
The R33 Skyline (Spec 2) continued the concepts introduced in the R32. Driver and Passenger airbags became standard in 1996. As a result, pre-1996 models are barred from being imported into various countries for consumer road use as they do not meet the frontal impact standards. For the RB25DET engine the ignition system was also changed, with the ignition module no longer located on the cam covers and was instead replaced by smart ignition coils (Ignitor built into coil) and ECU. The RB25DET&#x27;s turbo was also given a nylon compressor wheel to improve response. Throughout the time the R33 was produced there were quite a number of different styled lights and bodykits fitted, the actual body/chassis underwent no changes. Among the cosmetic changes in the spec 2 were, the headlights which tapered down more towards the grill and were fitted with improved reflectors, the grill (which was longer on the Spec 1), the hood which had a re-shaped leading edge to fit the new lights and front bumper changing shape in the smallest amount to match the lower edge of the new headlights. Later models of the Spec 2 also had the option of having an Active-LSD fitted.

The R33 ceased production in February 1998, the production run ending with the 40th Anniversary R33.

===GT-R===

The previous R32 model was a well proven build, but the R32 wasn&#x27;t without faults and suffered with uplift and balance issues. Along with that, Nissan was, as other Japanese companies were, under strict restrictions on power gains. So, to combat all those areas, Nissan created the sophisticated strength Programme. Nissan increased the width by about one inch on the R33 to the R32 and made it about 4 inches longer. This gave the R33 a longer wheelbase overall and lower stance mixed with new technology now from the computer aerodynamic age. Each line on the R33 was intended to give the car ultimate aerodynamics with wider gaps in the bumper and angles of air movement which allowed better cooling, in addition to the fuel tank lifted; the battery moved to the trunk. Rigidity points were added mixed with improvements on the Attessa and Hicas all now offered the R33 with the best aerodynamics, balance, and handling. Nissan engineers also found other ways to reduce weight, even by a few grams.

This includes:
Hollowing out the side door beams.
Using high tensile steel on body panels.
Reduction in sound deadening materials.
Super HICAS becoming electric.
Hollowing out of rear stabilizer bar.
Use of high tensile springs front and rear.
Shrinking the ABS actuator.
Light aluminum wheels with higher rigidity
The front and rear axles were made of aluminum (as in the BNR32), but so were engine mount insulators and brackets. 
New plastics were used for: fuel tank, head lamps, super high strength &quot;PP&quot; bumpers, air cleaner, changing the headlining material, changing material of rear spoiler.
All this put together meant we saw an improved time against the R32 of 21 seconds faster around the Nürburgring and 23 seconds faster in V spec trim, still making the R33 the fastest Skyline around the Nürburgring.
The BCNR33 GT-R version also had the same &quot;RB26DETT&quot; engine that the BNR32 was equipped with, although torque had been improved, due to changes in the turbo compressor aerodynamics, turbo dump pipe, and intercooler. The turbo core changed from a sleeve bearing to a ball bearing, but the turbine itself remained ceramic, except on N1 turbos (steel turbine, sleeve bearing). From the R33 onward, all GT-Rs received Brembo brakes. In 1995 the GT-R received an improved version of the RB26DETT, the ATTESA-ETS four-wheel-drive system, and Super HICAS 4-wheel steering.

A limited edition model was created in 1996, called the NISMO 400R, that produced from a road-tuned version of Nissan&#x27;s Le Mans engine. A stronger six-speed Getrag gearbox was used.

An R33 GT-R driven by Dirk Schoysman lapped the Nordschleife in less than 8 minutes. The Skyline GT-R R33 is reported to be the first production car to break 8 minutes, at 7 minutes and 59 seconds. Other manufacturers had caught up since the R32 was released, and the R33 never dominated motorsport to the extent of the R32. The R33 saw victory in the JGTC GT500 dominating the class and taking victory each year until its final racing year in which it was finally beaten by the McLaren F1 GTR.

The R33 saw huge favour in the tuning world with it being a popular model on the Wangan and top tuning companies building heavily tuned version from Top Secret ran by Smokey Nagata to Jun etc. and later by companies like Sumo. HKS GT-R would hold a drag series record for several years in their drag series, making a record win of 7.671-second pass at Sendai Hi-Land Raceway with Tetsuya Kawasaki behind the wheel and taking it to be the world&#x27;s fastest AWD car.

== Tenth generation (R34; 1998) ==
The R34 Skyline was introduced in May 1998. The HR34, ER34, and ENR34 marked the introduction of the more fuel-efficient RB25DET NEO engine. The RB20E engine was discontinued in the R34 base model (GT), and the RB20DE, after last being used in the R32 Skyline, was reintroduced in the updated NEO guise. The R34 GT, powered by the RB20DE NEO and coupled with a five-speed gearbox, became the most fuel-efficient straight-six Skyline to date (of any shape).

The 4-speed automatic transmission available on some models was retained, and was upgraded with tiptronic-style manual controls. An export-market 25GT Turbo coupe variant (often abbreviated as GT-T) was sold in Singapore and Hong Kong from 1998 to 2000, while the facelift 25GT Turbo was sold in New Zealand between 2001 and 2002 alongside the GT-R V-Spec. These were the only three countries outside of Japan that sold the R34 25GT Turbo model Skylines new. All Japanese &quot;Nissan Prince Store&quot; locations that sold the Skyline were renamed &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot;.

Nissan introduced two new models for the base vehicle, the 25GT-X and the 25GT-V. The 25GT-X was only available as a sedan and included optional extras over the base-model 25GT and 25GT Turbo such as tinted rear windows and pop-up LCD display that replaced the triple cluster on the turbo models. Another version, the 25GT-V, was a naturally-aspirated variation powered by the RB25DE, came standard with the upgraded 4-piston front and 2-piston rear Sumitomo calipers, limited-slip differential and 17&quot; alloy wheels only found on the turbo models.

In August 2000, the R34 received a facelift which changed the front bumper to a new, sleek design and Xenon headlights were standard across the entire range along with side-airbags built into the driver and passenger outer seat bolsters. For the interior, pedals were changed from rubber to aluminum while the gear shift knob and steering wheel were now made of genuine leather in a 2-tone design, the latter branded with the Skyline &quot;S&quot; badge as opposed to the Nissan logo. The centre console and dials now had an iridium-silver appearance; previously they were a gunmetal-grey look.
Optional exterior extras for the R34 included exterior aero which consists of redesigned front and rear bumpers, side skirts and a wrap-around spoiler on the rear which was only available for the coupe. Optional tuning Nismo parts for the R34 included shock absorbers, a variable sports exhaust system, aluminum intercooler, sway bars, oil cooler, and limited slip differential.

The R34 Skyline was the last in the series to have its platform shared with the luxury-oriented, longer wheelbase Laurel following the closure of the Musashimurayama factory in 2002, with the Laurel being discontinued that same year.

===GT-R (BNR34)===

The GT-R reappeared in January 1999, with a revised chassis and other updates. The R34 turbos received a ball bearing core. The R34 N1 turbos had a metal exhaust wheel, and ball bearing center section. The turbo outlet pipes were changed from cast to formed metal outlets. The intercooler outlet side and rear turbo dump pipe had temperature probes fitted in the V-spec models.

===Marketing===
As part of the Type R34 GT-R final campaign, all Skyline GT-R customers received an official GT-R photo album before 24 January 2002.

===United States===
A small number of R34 GT-Rs are legal in the United States despite not being compliant with the NHTSA 25-year rule prior to 2024. An importer called Motorex crash-tested an R33, submitted emissions paperwork and certification to the Environmental Protection Agency, and modified others to meet US approval. The company ran into legal trouble after importing R32 and R34 models, but telling the government they were R33s. Motorex also stopped making the required modifications (safety, US-spec gauges and reflectors, etc.) needed in order for the cars to be sold in the US. After a 2005 raid on the company, Motorex was shut down. The government then sent letters to the owners of the disputed cars and made them US legal, since the cars were imported under false pretenses. An estimated twelve R34 GT-Rs are US-legal as a result of this.

In 2018, the first R34 GT-R was legally imported under the FMVSS&#x27;s &quot;Show &amp; Display&quot; exemption. Currently, only the first 282 V-Spec GT-Rs produced for 1999, finished in LV4 Midnight Purple II paint, and the 285 M-Spec Nür models, as well as the 38 V-Spec N1 models and the 18 V-Spec II N1 models finished in QM1 White are eligible under this exemption. However, only a minimum of 199 of the 11,578 models of the R34 GT-R produced from 1999 to 2004 had been painted in LV4 Midnight Purple II according to GT-R Registry claims.

The R34 GT-R would become legally importable in 2024 under the 25-year rule, which eventually came to pass in January 2024 with the first R34 GT-R models manufactured in January 1999 (which had turned 25 years old by then). These vehicles do not have to comply with any federal safety and emissions regulations due to their age, and are eligible for legal import into the United States. Other R34 GT-Rs manufactured from 2000 to 2004 will also become legal for US import starting in 2025 up to 2029.

== Eleventh generation (V35; 2001) ==
The 11th-generation (V35) Nissan Skyline was introduced in June 2001. This was the first Skyline to not be based on the platform of its former luxury twin, the Nissan Laurel (which was due to be discontinued in 2002), and was instead based on Nissan&#x27;s FM platform that was also shared with the Nissan 350Z. The Nissan Skyline used a front-midship engine (VQ35DE and others as below), rear-wheel-drive layout (four-wheel drive was available for the sedan) to achieve a 52%/48% weight distribution.

The all-new Skyline was introduced at reorganized Nissan Japanese dealerships called &quot;Nissan Red Stage&quot; in conjunction with the reintroduced Nissan Fairlady Z, sold exclusively at &quot;Nissan Blue Stage&quot; Japanese dealerships. The vehicle went on sale on 18 June 2001. Early models included the 250GT, 250GTe, and 300GT. Early Skyline Driving Helper model includes 250GT. The Skyline 250GT FOUR sedan includes ATTESA E-TS all wheel drive with 50:50 synchro mode, VQ25DD (NEO Di) engine, and a five-speed automatic transmission. It went on sale on 26 September 2001. The Skyline 250GTm sedan went on sale on 13 January 2002, while the Skyline 350GT-8 sedan went on sale on 19 February 2002.

Beginning in 2002, the Skyline sedan was sold in North America and Europe, where it was marketed as the Infiniti G35. The V35 was also the first Skyline made for export to the United States, being sold under the aforementioned brand name.

The V35 broke with previous Skyline tradition - it offered no straight-six engine, no turbocharger since the R30, and no GT-R version, a decision which extended to all later Skylines. The intention had been for the model to use a different name, a decision reversed by Renault/Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn, who choose to gear the V35 towards the luxury-sport market. Billing the 350Z as a pure sports car, Nissan put a slightly more powerful VQ35DE in the 350Z, and while the Skyline and the 350Z shared the same platform, the 350Z had additional bracing, under-body aero parts, and weighed less. Some fans refer to V35 as the &quot;New Generation Skyline&quot; due to drastic changes between the V35 series and its R34 predecessor. Nonetheless, as of 1 July 2001 (two weeks after launch), total domestic Japanese Skyline orders had reached 4200 units.

Japanese tuners mostly ignored the V35 Skyline, the 2006 Tsukuba Super Lap Battle had not a single V35 entrant. Tuners such as Mines, Amuse, Hosaka, Garage Defend, M Speed, Nagisa, MCR, HKS, &amp; Top Secret continued developing R32-R34 GT-Rs as time attack cars. Top Secret did tune a V35 but replaced the VQ35DE with a Twin Turbo VK45DE V8. Signal USA entered a V35 in Formula D, replacing the VQ35DE with an SR20DET.

While this generation did not have any turbocharged engines, they later returned with the V37 series, when the 2.0 L Mercedes-Benz M274 turbo I4 engine was introduced; twin-turbo engines returned with the 2019 update of the same generation with the introduction of a 3.0 L &quot;VR30DDTT&quot; twin-turbo V6 engine replacing the previous M274 engine.

Models:
* 250GT (V35) – 2.5 L &quot;VQ25DD&quot; V6, , 
* 250GT Four (NV35) – 2.5 L &quot;VQ25DD&quot; V6, , 4WD
* 300GT (HV35) – 3.0 L &quot;VQ30DD&quot; V6, , 
* 350GT-8 (PV35) – 3.5 L &quot;VQ35DE&quot; V6, , 
* 350GT Coupe (CPV35) – 3.5 L &quot;VQ35DE&quot; V6, , 

===XVL concept (1999)===
The XVL concept is a concept car demonstrating the FR L-class platform. It includes a 3.0L V6 direct-injection gasoline engine and sedan body. The vehicle was unveiled at the 1999 Tokyo Auto Show.

===Changes===
For 2003 the design of the radiator grille, headlamp inner panels, and sills were altered. The interior and mirrors were altered, while the suspension and braking systems were also refined. The Skyline Coupe was introduced as a version of Nissan Skyline Sport Coupe for Japanese market. Also, the Skyline 350GT went on sale. It is a version of the Skyline V35 sport sedan with a six-speed manual transmission for the Japanese market, only available with the 3.5-liter engine. The Skyline 350GT and Skyline 350GT Premium sedan went on sale on 3 June 2003.

For 2004 both coupe and sedans were altered, with updated interiors and improved transmissions. The five-speed automatic transmission on the 350GT Premium now included synchro rev control, while the 6-speed manual transmission was made to vibrate less. For the sedan, the front grill/bumper, foot panel, head lamp, rear bumper, and rear combination lamps were changed. The front seats received active headrest, while the rear middle seat now have a three-point seat belt as standard. There were also some new wheels and a 19-inch option for the coupé. The Skyline&#x27;s 2005 update again included changes to the head and rear lamps, front bumper, and side sill protectors. Also, 19-inch aluminum alloy wheel became standard for automatic transmission cars. A &quot;plasma cluster ion&quot; full air conditioner with left/right independent temperature settings, heated door mirrors, headlamp auto levelizer (compliant with new legislation) was made standard equipment.

<text>Joseph Philo Bradley (March 14, 1813 – January 22, 1892) was an American jurist who served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from 1870 to 1892. He was also a member of the Electoral Commission that decided the disputed 1876 United States presidential election.

==Early life==
The son of Philo Bradley and Mercy Gardner Bradley, Bradley was born to humble beginnings in Berne, New York. He was the oldest of 12 children. He attended local schools and began teaching at the age of 16. In 1833, the Dutch Reformed Church of Berne advanced Joseph Bradley $250 to study for the ministry at Rutgers University. He graduated in 1836. After graduation, he was made Principal of the Millstone Academy, and decided to study law.

He was persuaded by his Rutgers classmate Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen to join him in Newark and pursue legal studies at the Office of the Collector of the Port of Newark. He was admitted to the bar in 1839.

Bradley began in private practice in New Jersey, specializing in patent and railroad law, and he became very prominent in these fields and quite wealthy. Bradley remained dedicated to self-study throughout his life and collected an extensive library. He married Mary Hornblower in Newark in 1844. In 1851, Bradley, once employed as an actuary for the Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Company, submitted an article to the &quot;Journal of the Institute of Actuaries&quot; detailing an historical account of a Severan dynasty-era Roman life table compiled by the Roman jurist Ulpian in approximately 220 AD during the reign of Elagabalus (218–222) that was included in the &quot;Digesta seu Pandectae&quot; (533) codification ordered by Justinian I (527–565) of the Eastern Roman Empire.

==Supreme Court==
===Appointment===
On February 7, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant nominated Bradley as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, to the seat created by the Judiciary Act of 1869. Several weeks later, on March 21, he was confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a 46–9 vote. Bradley took the judicial oath of office on March 23, 1870, and remained on the Court until January 22, 1892. Bradley was the president&#x27;s second nominee for the position. The first, Ebenezer R. Hoar was rejected by the Senate.

===Court jurisprudence===
Bradley took a broad view of the national government&#x27;s powers under the Commerce Clause but interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment somewhat narrowly, as did much of the rest of the court at the time. He authored the majority opinion in the Civil Rights Cases of 1883 but was among the four dissenters in the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot; in 1873. His interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment in both cases remained the basis for subsequent rulings through the modern era.
Bradley concurred with the court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Bradwell v. Illinois&quot;, which held that the right to practice law was not constitutionally protected under the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bradley disagreed with the majority opinion, apparently because it rested on the decision in the &quot;Slaughter-House Cases&quot;, but concurred in the judgment on grounds that the clause did not protect women in their choice of vocation. The concurrence is noted for Bradley&#x27;s description of womanhood: &quot;The harmony, not to say identity, of interest and views which belong, or should belong, to the family institution is repugnant to the idea of a woman adopting a distinct and independent career from that of her husband (...) The paramount destiny and mission of women are to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife and mother. This is the law of the Creator.&quot;

It was due to Bradley&#x27;s intervention that prisoners charged in the Colfax Massacre of 1873 were freed, after he happened to attend their trial and ruled that the federal law they were charged under was unconstitutional. This resulted in the federal government&#x27;s bringing the case on appeal to the Supreme Court as &quot;United States v. Cruikshank&quot; (1875). The court&#x27;s ruling on this case meant that the federal government would not intervene on paramilitary and group attacks on individuals. It essentially opened the door to heightened paramilitary activity in the South that forced Republicans from office, suppressed black voting, and opened the way for white Democratic takeover of state legislatures, and resulting Jim Crow laws and passage of disfranchising constitutions.

Bradley dissented in &quot;Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway Co. v. Minnesota&quot;, which, though not racially motivated, was another due process case arising from the Fourteenth Amendment. In his dissent, Bradley argued that the majority had in siding with the railroad created a situation where the reasonableness of an act of a state legislature was a judicial question, subjugating the legislature to the will of the judiciary. Bradley&#x27;s opinion in this case is echoed in modern arguments regarding judicial activism.

Bradley also wrote the opinion in &quot;Hans v. Louisiana&quot;, holding that a state could not be sued in a federal court by one of its own citizens. This is perhaps ironic in light of his dissent in the railroad case, since the &quot;Hans&quot; doctrine is entirely based on judicial activism and, as Bradley admitted in his opinion, not supported by the text of the Constitution.

As an individual Supreme Court Justice, Bradley decided &quot;In re Guiteau&quot;, a petition for habeas corpus filed on behalf of Charles Guiteau, the assassin of President James A. Garfield. Guiteau&#x27;s lawyers argued that he had been improperly tried in the District of Columbia because, although Guiteau shot Garfield in Washington, D.C., Garfield died at his home in New Jersey. Bradley denied the petition in a lengthy opinion and Guiteau was executed.

==1877 Electoral Commission==
Bradley was the 15th and final member of the Electoral Commission that decided the disputed 1876 presidential election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel J. Tilden.

The U.S. House and Senate named five members each to serve on the commission, and the Supreme Court named five associate justices to serve. The key vote would fall to one of the named justices, David Davis, an independent. However, when Davis was elected to the Senate, he excused himself from the Commission and resigned from the Supreme Court to take his seat in the Senate. Bradley, a long time Republican, replaced him on the commission, shifting its political balance.

Bradley wrote a number of opinions while on the electoral commission, and like the other members sided with his own party. The final 8-7 vote, which split along partisan lines, effectively made Hayes president, and Bradley was characterized in the press as the &quot;casting vote&quot;, or tiebreaker. Democrats, who had hoped that Bradley might side with their candidate, focused their anger on him rather than on his fellow Republicans on the panel. Press reports that criticized the decision singled out Bradley for vilification, and he received a number of death threats.

There have been detailed but unproven claims over the years that Bradley originally planned to come down on the side of Tilden, but was lobbied into changing his mind on the night before the final decision. These claims have been discussed at length in various studies of the electoral dispute. Bradley always denied that he had been improperly influenced by anyone.

==Death==
Bradley died in Washington, D.C., on January 22, 1892, and was interred at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Newark, New Jersey.

Bradley&#x27;s personal, legal, and court papers are archived at the New Jersey Historical Society in Newark and open for research.

==Historical reappraisal==
In 2021, Rutgers University, Bradley&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;, deleted his name from a building the university acquired in 1971; a University committee &quot;recommended Bradley&#x27;s name be removed after a study of his judicial record. The study showed Bradley chose to use his position as a Supreme Court Justice to undo reconstruction, regressing on civil rights and opening a new era of oppression&quot;.

<doc id="912211" wikidata="Q277245" url="?curid=912211" title="99th Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 99th Infantry Division briefly existed, but never deployed, in the closing days of World War I, was reconstituted as a reserve unit in 1921, was ordered into active military service in 1942, and deployed overseas in 1944. The 99th landed at the French port of Le Havre and proceeded northeast to Belgium. During the heavy fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, the unit suffered many casualties, yet tenaciously held its defensive position. In March 1945, the 99th advanced into the Rhineland, crossing the Rhine River at Remagen on March 11. After fighting in the Ruhr area, the unit moved southward into Bavaria, where it was located at the end of the war.

The 99th Infantry Division gained the nickname the &quot;Checkerboard&quot; division, from its unit insignia that was devised in 1923 while it was headquartered in the city of Pittsburgh. The blue and white checkerboard in the insignia is taken from the coat of arms of William Pitt, for whom Pittsburgh is named. The division was also known as the &quot;Battle Babies&quot; during 1945, a sobriquet coined by a United Press correspondent when the division was first mentioned in press reports during the Battle of the Bulge.

On May 3–4, 1945, as the 99th moved deeper into Bavaria, it liberated one of a number of Dachau subcamps near the town of Mühldorf. The unit reported on May 4 that it had &quot;liberated 3 labor camps and 1 concentration camp.&quot; The concentration camp was one of the &quot;forest camps&quot; (Waldlager) tied to the Mühldorf camp complex. The 99th Infantry&#x27;s report stated that 1,500 Jews were &quot;living under terrible conditions and approximately 600 required hospitalization due to starvation and disease.&quot;

The 99th Infantry Division was recognized as a liberating unit by the US Army&#x27;s Center of Military History and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in 1992.

The insignia, though not the US Army recognized lineage, is maintained by the 99th Readiness Division, a United States Army Reserve (USAR) unit constituted in 1967, serving as of 2023 as a geographic command, headquartered at Joint Base McGuire–Dix–Lakehurst in New Jersey.

==World War I==

On 23 July 1918, the War Department directed the organization of the 99th Division at Camp Wheeler, Georgia. Plans called for the division to include a headquarters, headquarters troop, the 197th Infantry Brigade (393rd and 394th Infantry Regiments and 371st Machine Gun Battalion), 198th Infantry Brigade (395th and 396th Infantry Regiments and 372nd Machine Gun Battalion), 370th Machine Gun Battalion, 174th Field Artillery Brigade (370th-372nd Field Artillery Regiments and 28th Trench Mortar Battery), 324th Engineers, 624th Field Signal Battalion, and 324th Train Headquarters and Military Police (Ammunition, Engineer, Sanitary, and Supply Trains). It was intended that the 197th Infantry Brigade would be organized in France from the 54th and 55th Pioneer Infantry Regiments. 

The 28th Trench Mortar Battery was formed at Fort Sheridan, Illinois, in August 1918 and was assigned to the 174th Field Artillery Brigade, but never ended up joining. The organization of the division began in October with the appointment of Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Beck as division chief of staff, but organization never progressed beyond the assignment of the division staff and preliminary preparations for the receipt of Selective Service men. After the Armistice of 11 November 1918, the 99th Division was ordered demobilized on 30 November 1918.

==Interwar period==

The 99th Division was demobilized on 7 January 1919 at Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina. It was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Third Corps Area, and assigned to the XIII Corps. The division was further allotted to the western half of the state of Pennsylvania as its home area. The division headquarters was organized in November 1921 at 3939 Butler Street, in Pittsburgh. The headquarters was relocated in December 1922 to Room 604 in the Chamber of Commerce Building. It was relocated again in October 1923 to Room 310 in the Westinghouse Building and remained there until activated for World War II. After its reorganization, the division slowly built its strength, and by July 1924, the division was at 100 percent strength in authorized officers, but dropped back to 91 percent by March 1926. Typically, many of the division&#x27;s units in Pittsburgh conducted their inactive training period meetings at the National Guard armory in that city. The division was chiefly manned with graduates of the ROTC programs of the Carnegie Institute of Technology, Duquesne University. Pennsylvania State College, and the Pennsylvania Military College as the number of ROTC officers in the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps overtook the number of World War I-veteran officers beginning in 1929. During the interwar period, all units of the division except the 394th Infantry Regiment and 198th Infantry Brigade were headquartered in Pittsburgh. The command of all three Organized Reserve divisions in a given corps area nominally fell to the corps area commander, with the divisions&#x27; chiefs of staff responsible for day-to-day operations, but some corps area commanders designated a junior general officer in their corps area to serve as division commander; from 13 June 1929 to 23 August 1932, Brigadier General James B. Gowen, concurrently the commander of the 1st Division&#x27;s 1st Field Artillery Brigade, commanded the 99th Division.

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Camp George G. Meade (later redesignated Fort George G. Meade in 1929), Maryland, the location where much of the 99th&#x27;s training activities occurred over the next 20 years. For the few summers when the division headquarters was called to duty for training as a unit, it usually trained with the staff of the 16th Infantry Brigade, 8th Division, at Camp Meade. The infantry regiments of the division held their summer training primarily with the units of the 16th Infantry Brigade at Fort Meade or Fort Eustis, Virginia. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Third Corps Area with Regular Army units of the same branch. For example, the 304th Engineer Regiment usually trained with elements of the 1st Engineer Regiment at Fort DuPont, Delaware; the 304th Medical Regiment trained with the 1st Medical Regiment at Carlisle Barracks, Pennsylvania; and the 304th Observation Squadron trained with the 21st and 50th Observation Squadrons at Langley Field, Virginia. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments rotated responsibility to conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps held at Camp Meade, Fort Eustis, and Fort Washington, Maryland, each year. 

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Third Corps Area and First Army command post exercises (CPX) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. Two of the more notable CPXs were the Third Corps Area CPX at Fort George G. Meade conducted 6–19 July 1930 and a division CPX conducted 23 August–5 September 1936 at Indiantown Gap Military Reservation, Pennsylvania. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Third Corps Area, the 99th Division did not participate in the various Third Corps Area maneuvers and the First Army maneuvers of 1935 and 1939 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to full peace strength for the exercises.

===Order of battle===

Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

Many members of the 99th Infantry Division had participated in the Army Specialized Training Program or ASTP, derisively nicknamed &quot;all safe &#x27;till peace;&quot; in February 1944, the program was drawn down, and the majority of its members were assigned to later-deploying divisions such as the 99th.

===Combat chronicle===

; Arrival in Europe

The 99th Infantry Division, comprising the 393rd, 394th, and the 395th Infantry Regiments, arrived in England on 10 October 1944. Put under the operational control of V Corps, First Army, it moved to Le Havre, France on 3 November and proceeded to Aubel, Belgium, to prepare to enter the front lines.

; Battle of the Bulge
The division first saw action on 9 November, taking over the defense of the sector north of the Roer River between Schmidt and Monschau, a distance of nearly 19 miles. After defensive patrolling, the 99th probed the Siegfried Line against heavy resistance on 13 December. Formerly nicknamed the &quot;Checkerboard Division,&quot; which referred to its shoulder patch, in late 1944 having not yet seen battle, the division was nicknamed the &quot;Battle Babies.&quot;

The inexperienced troops of the division were lodged on the northern shoulder of the Ardennes Offensive on 16 December, unexpectedly facing the advancing German 6th Panzer Army. 

The 99th Infantry Division, outnumbered five to one, inflicted estimated casualties on the Germans in the ratio of eighteen to one. The division lost about 20% of its effective strength, including 465 killed and 2,524 evacuated due to wounds, injuries, fatigue, or trench foot; German losses were much higher. In the northern sector opposite the 99th, this included more than 4,000 deaths and the destruction of 60 tanks and big guns. Historian John S.D. Eisenhower wrote, &quot;... the action of the 2nd and 99th Divisions on the northern shoulder could be considered the most decisive of the Ardennes campaign.&quot;

The stiff American defense prevented the Germans from reaching the vast array of supplies near the Belgian cities of Liège and Spa and the road network west of the Elsenborn Ridge leading to the Meuse River. After more than ten days of intense battle, they pushed the Americans out of the villages, but were unable to dislodge them from the ridge, where elements of the V Corps of the First U.S. Army prevented the German forces from reaching the road network to their west.

Although cut up and surrounded in part, the 99th was one of the only divisions that did not yield to the German attack, and held their positions until reinforcements arrived. The lines were then moved back to form defensive positions east of Elsenborn Ridge on the 19th. Here it held firmly against violent enemy attacks. From 21 December 1944 to 30 January 1945, the unit was engaged in aggressive patrolling and reequipping. It attacked toward the Monschau Forest, on 1 February, mopping up and patrolling until it was relieved for training and rehabilitation, on 13 February.

; Stand at Lanzerath

The Intelligence and Reconnaissance Platoon, 394th Infantry Regiment, 99th Division was the most decorated platoon for a single action of World War II. During the first morning of the Battle of the Bulge, they defended a key road junction in the vicinity of the Losheim Gap. Led by 20-year-old Lieutenant Lyle Bouck Jr., they delayed the advance of the 1st SS Panzer Division, the spearhead of the entire German 6th Panzer Army, for nearly 20 hours. In a long fight with about 500 men of the 1st Battalion, 9th Fallschirmjaeger Regiment, 3rd Fallschirmjaeger Division, the 18 men of the platoon along with four artillery observers inflicted between 60 and more than 100 casualties on the Germans. The platoon seriously disrupted the entire German Sixth Panzer Army&#x27;s schedule of attack along the northern edge of the offensive. At dusk on 16 December, after virtually no sleep during the preceding night and a full day of almost non-stop combat, with only a few rounds of ammunition remaining, about 50 German paratroopers finally flanked and captured the remaining 19 soldiers. Two men who had been sent on foot to regimental headquarters to seek reinforcements were later captured. Fourteen of the 18 platoon members were wounded, while only one soldier, a member of the artillery observation team, was killed.

Because the unit&#x27;s radios had been destroyed, the soldiers captured, and the rapid subsequent German advance, U.S. Army commanders did not know about the unit&#x27;s success at slowing the German advance, or even if they had been captured or killed. The platoon members were not recognized for their courageous deeds for thirty-seven years. On 25 October 1981, the entire platoon was recognized with a Presidential Unit Citation. Every member of the platoon was decorated, which included four Distinguished Service Crosses, five Silver Stars and ten Bronze Stars with &quot;V&quot; devices signifying awards for valor in combat.

; Advance into Germany
On 2 March 1945, the division took the offensive, moving toward Cologne and crossing the Erft Canal near Glesch. After clearing towns west of the Rhine, it crossed the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen on the 11th. The 99th Infantry Division was the first complete division to cross the Rhine. They continued to Linz am Rhein and to the Wied River. Crossing on the 23d, it pushed east on the Koln-Frankfurt highway to Giessen. Against light resistance, it crossed the Dill River and pushed on to Krofdorf-Gleiberg, taking Giessen 29 March. The 99th then moved to Schwarzenau, on 3 April, and attacked the southeast sector of the Ruhr Pocket on the 5th. Although the enemy resisted fiercely, the Ruhr pocket collapsed with the fall of Iserlohn, on 16 April.

The last drive began on 23 April. The 99th crossed the Ludwig Canal against stiff resistance and established a bridgehead over the Altmuhl River, 25 April. The division crossed the Danube near Eining on the 27th and after a stubborn fight the Isar at Landshut on 1 May. On 3–4 May, the division liberated two labor camps and a &quot;forest camp&quot; (Waldlager) related to the Mühldorf concentration camp, a sub-camp of Dachau. The 99th Infantry&#x27;s after action report stated they found 1,500 Jews &quot;living under terrible conditions and approximately 600 required hospitalization due to starvation and disease.&quot; The division continued to attack without opposition to the Inn River and Giesenhausen until VE-day.

===Commanding officers===
*Maj. Gen. Thompson Lawrence (November 1942 – July 1943)
*Maj. Gen. Walter E. Lauer (July 1943 – 18 August 1945)
*Brig. Gen. Frederick H. Black (August 1945 to inactivation)

==Unit insignia==
The unit&#x27;s distinctive shoulder patch consisted of a five-sided shield of black on which is superimposed a horizontal band of white and blue squares. The black represents the iron from the mills of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where many of the troops were from. The blue and white are taken from the coat of arms for William Pitt for whom Pittsburgh was named. There are nine white squares and nine blue ones, signifying the number 99.

==Reactivation==

On 22 December 1967, the 99th Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was activated. While the 99th ARCOM was allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 99th Infantry Division and use its number, Department of the Army policy does not allow for the lineage of MTOE units, such as infantry divisions, to be perpetuated by TDA units, such as ARCOMs. In 1975, the 99th ARCOM moved its headquarters to Oakdale, Pennsylvania.
After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, 22 99th units deployed to Saudi Arabia, Europe, and other locations. After the Gulf War, the 99th ARCOM became the 99th Regional Support Command (RSC). The 99th RSC&#x27;s mission was to provide command and control and full-service support for assigned units and facility management.

On 23 Dec. 1996, the 99th RSC mobilized the first of six units for deployment to Operation Joint Endeavor in support of peacekeeping missions in Bosnia. The 99th RSC continued to support operations in the Balkan Republics while providing refuge to those fleeing Kosovo as they sought temporary recovery in the United States.

Following the 11 September 2001, terrorist attacks, the 99th mobilized large numbers of Army Reserve Soldiers. While the 99th was fully involved in this large mobilization, the headquarters moved to Coraopolis, Pennsylvania. In January 2003, the 99th RSC started mobilizing units for projected operations in Iraq.
On 16 July 2003, the command was redesignated as the 99th Regional Readiness Command, placing additional emphasis on training, readiness, and mobilization. The 99th RRC continued to provide command and control for assigned units and support for the ongoing deployments.
In 2005, the Army Reserve began its latest transformation under the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) directive and lessons learned from eight years of deployments in support of the Global War on Terrorism. The 10 geographically based RRCs, including the 99th, were inactivated and replaced with four regional base operations commands. The 99th was selected as one of these new regional support commands.
In September 2007, in preparation for the transition to Fort Dix and establishment of the new 99th RSC, the 99th RRC assumed administrative responsibility for the former regions of the 77th and 94th RRCs, which had inactivated. On 17 September 2008, the 99th Regional Support Command was activated at Fort Dix, N.J. The 99th RSC&#x27;s mission was to provide base operations functions for the assigned 13-state Northeast Region.

===Lineage===

The U.S. Army Center of Military History states that the 99th RSC does not perpetuate the lineage and honors of the 99th Infantry Division. Army policy does not allow for the lineage and honors of a TO&amp;E organization, such as an infantry division, to be perpetuated by a TDA organization, such as an RSC. While an RSC is allowed to wear the insignia and use the same number as a previous infantry division, it is not entitled to its lineage and honors.

=== Hurricane Sandy===

The 99th RSC was awarded the Army Superior Unit Award on 9 May 2016 by the US Army Human Resources Command for its role in the relief support after Hurricane Sandy, from 29 October 2012 thru 31 March 2013. Soldiers who were in direct support of the relief efforts were also awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal as a personal award.

<text>The Australian &quot;hornet&quot; (Abispa ephippium), a type of potter wasp or &quot;mason wasp&quot;, is a vespid native to the Australian states and territories of the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Northern Territory, Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia. Despite its namesake, it is not a true hornet.

The Australian hornet is a solitary insect, forming small nests against buildings and other structures. The adult wasp feeds on flower nectar, while the larvae are fed caterpillars captured by the female.

==Description==
&quot;A. ephippium&quot; is in length. The insect is mostly orange, with a large central black patch on the top of the thorax, and a wide black band marking the abdomen. The insect&#x27;s wings are largely translucent, but tinted orange with black areas at the wing&#x27;s end.

==Life cycle==
Being a member of the potter wasp subfamily (Eumeninae), &quot;A. ephippium&quot; females build large nests in sheltered positions using mud. The females search for prey (including spiders and caterpillars) around trees and shrubs, before sealing the captured insects inside the nest&#x27;s cells. The larvae then feed upon these insects, before emerging.

<text>The 106th Infantry Division was a division of the United States Army formed for service during World War II. Two of its three regiments were overrun and surrounded in the initial days of the Battle of the Bulge, and they were forced to surrender to German forces on 19 December 1944. The division was never officially added to the troop list following the war, despite having been almost completely organized in Puerto Rico by 1948; subsequently, the War Department determined the division was not needed and inactivated the division headquarters in 1950.

== World War II ==
The 106th Infantry Division&#x27;s Headquarters and Headquarters Company was constituted in the Army of the United States on 5 May 1942, five months after the United States entered World War II. The division&#x27;s numbering followed in sequence with the 105th Infantry Division, a planned African American infantry division that would be constituted on the Army&#x27;s troop list, but never ended up being activated. The 106th Infantry Division was activated on 15 March 1943 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, with a cadre from the 80th Infantry Division. Following basic and advanced infantry training, the Division moved on 28 March 1944 to Tennessee to participate in the Second Army No. 5 Maneuvers. The 106th Infantry Division was one of twenty-two lower-priority divisions that saw extensive withdrawals of personnel during 1944 to comply with War Department rulings that all units not scheduled for early shipment could be used as sources of replacements (with the greatest possible proportion of men taken having six months or more of training), and that no eighteen-year-olds or men with children conceived prior to the Attack on Pearl Harbor who had less than six months of training be taken as replacements unless men were available from other sources. From April to September 1944, 5,050 infantry, field artillery, and cavalry privates and noncommissioned officers were withdrawn from the division. They were replaced chiefly by former Army Specialized Training Program students, aviation cadets-in-waiting transferred to the ground forces, men from disbanded antiaircraft and tank destroyer units, and men who had volunteered for transfer to the infantry from other branches of the Army.

The 106th Infantry Division relieved the 2nd Infantry Division in the Schnee Eifel on 11 December 1944, with its 424th Infantry Regiment being sent to Winterspelt. Prior to the battle, according to the U.S. Army Service Manual, one division should be responsible for no more than of front.
On the eve of the battle, the 106th, along with the attached 14th Cavalry Group, was covering a front of at least .

In the Ardennes-Alsace Campaign, the Germans attacked the 106th on 16 December 1944. The division&#x27;s 422nd and 423rd Infantry Regiments were encircled and cut off by a junction of enemy forces in the vicinity of Schönberg. They regrouped for a counterattack, but were blocked by the enemy. The two regiments surrendered on 19 December. The Germans gained 6,000 prisoners in one of the largest mass surrenders in American military history.

The remainder of the division that evaded the German pincer movement was reinforced by the 112th Infantry Regiment of the 28th Infantry Division and withdrew over the Our River and joined other units at Saint Vith. Along with the city of Bastogne to the south, St. Vith was a road and rail junction city considered vital to the German goal of breaking through Allied lines to split American and British forces and reach the Belgian port city of Antwerp. A scratch force of 106th Division personnel, in particular the division&#x27;s 81st Engineer Combat Battalion, was organized and led by the 81st&#x27;s 28-year-old commanding officer, Lt. Col. Thomas Riggs, in a five-day holding action (17–21 December) on a thin ridge line a mile outside St. Vith, against German forces vastly superior in numbers and armament (only a few hundred green Americans versus many thousands of veteran Germans). For this action, the 81st Engineer Combat Battalion was later awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for gallantry. The defense of St. Vith by the 106th has been credited with ruining the German timetable for reaching Antwerp, hampering the Bulge offensive for the Germans.

The 81st and other units, including the 168th Engineer Combat Battalion, pulled back from St. Vith on 21 December, under constant enemy fire, and withdrew over the Salm River at Vielsalm on 23 December. The following day, the 424th Regiment, attached to the 7th Armored Division, fought a delaying action at Manhay until ordered to an assembly area. From 25 December to 9 January 1945, the division received reinforcements and supplies at Anthisnes, Belgium, and returned to the struggle, securing objectives along the - line on 15 January after heavy fighting. After being pinched out by advancing divisions, the 106th assembled at Stavelot on 18 January for rehabilitation and training. It moved to the vicinity of Hunningen on 7 February for defensive patrols and training.

In March, the 424th advanced along the high ground between Berk and the and was relieved on 7 March. A period of training and security patrols along the Rhine River followed, until 15 March, when the division moved to St. Quentin for rehabilitation and the reconstruction of lost units.

The division was reconstituted on 16 March when the 3rd Infantry Regiment (the Old Guard) and the 159th Infantry Regiment were attached to replace the two lost regiments. The division then moved back to Germany on 25 April, where, for the remainder of its stay in Europe, the 106th handled POW enclosures and engaged in occupational duties.

In the meantime, the 422nd Infantry Regiment and the 423rd Infantry Regiment were reconstituted from replacements in France on 15 April, were attached to the 66th Infantry Division in training status, and were still in this status when the Germans surrendered on 8 May 1945.

== Notable members ==
Kurt Vonnegut served in this division and used his experiences during the Battle of the Bulge (and captivity as a prisoner of war) in his novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five.&quot;

Master Sergeant Roddie Edmonds (died 1985), who was captured on 19 December 1944 as a member of the 422nd Infantry Regiment, was recognized in 2015 by Israel&#x27;s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and museum as the first American serviceman from World War II to be honored with the title Righteous Among The Nations for risking his life to save Jewish-American POWs under his command from being taken from the POW camp in Germany to concentration camps, where they likely would have been murdered or worked to death.

Donald Prell, futurologist and founder of Datamation, the first computer magazine, served as the leader of the second anti-tank platoon in the 422nd Infantry Regiment, and several years following the war researched the biological basis of personality with the British psychologist Hans Eysenck. Prell had been captured in the Battle of the Bulge, survived Allied aerial bombardment while locked in a boxcar with 59 other POWs, and then suffered freezing and starvation while in a German POW camp.

Richard B. Parker, a Foreign Service Officer, served as the leader of the first platoon of the Anti-Tank Company of the 422nd Infantry Regiment and was captured and served as a POW. Parker was an expert in Middle Eastern affairs and served as a U.S. Ambassador to Algeria, Lebanon and Morocco during the 1970s.

<doc id="912226" wikidata="Q429927" url="?curid=912226" title="Judith of Flanders">
<text>Judith of Flanders (c. 843 – 870 or later) was a Carolingian princess who became Queen of Wessex by two successive marriages and later Countess of Flanders. Judith was the eldest child of the Carolingian emperor Charles the Bald and his first wife, Ermentrude of Orléans. In 856, she married Æthelwulf, King of Wessex. After her husband&#x27;s death in 858, Judith married his son and successor, Æthelbald. King Ætheldbald died in 860. Both of Judith&#x27;s first two marriages were childless. Her third marriage was to Baldwin I, Margrave of Flanders, with whom she had several children. 

== Ancestry and early life ==
Judith was born around 843 or in early 844 as the eldest child of Charles the Bald, king of West Francia, and his first wife Ermentrude of Orléans (823–869) and was named after her paternal grandmother, Judith of Bavaria. She was a great-granddaughter of Charlemagne.

==Queen of Wessex==
===First marriage and coronation===
In 855, the widower Æthelwulf, King of Wessex (died 858) made a pilgrimage to Rome with his youngest son Alfred (848/849–899). On the way there, he visited the court of Charles the Bald and negotiated for a marriage with 12-year-old Judith, despite probably being in his mid-fifties and having six children, three or five of them older than Judith. He may have been looking for an ally against the Vikings, as both he and Charles had suffered from their attacks, though it has also been suggested he was seeking a strategic coalition against his own sons. Marrying into the prestigious Carolingian dynasty was an additional advantage for Æthelwulf. 

On the way back, in 856, he stayed at Charles&#x27; court again, and married Judith on 1 October 856 at the royal palace of Verberie-sur-Oise. This was an extraordinary event as Carolingian princesses rarely married and were usually sent to convents. It was practically unprecedented for them to marry foreigners. During the ceremony, which was celebrated by Hincmar, archbishop of Rheims, the bride put on a wedding ring and was presented with magnificent gifts. As a part of the ritual, Judith was crowned and anointed with myrrh. Æthelwulf honoured his bride by calling her queen after the ceremony. According to the customs of Wessex, the wife of a king could not be called queen or sit on the throne with her husband. However, all chroniclers pay attention to the fact that Charles the Bald insisted on the coronation of his daughter, probably wishing to secure her position in her new home:

After the celebrations, Æthelwulf, his new wife and his son returned to Wessex. Judith, a well-educated lady like most Frankish princesses of the time, probably brought the &quot;aura of the Carolingian monarchy&quot; to the court of Wessex. Back in his kingdom, Æthelwulf faced difficulties: his eldest surviving son, Æthelbald, supported by Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne and Eanwulf, Ealdorman of Somerset, were conspiring to dethrone him. The marriage with Judith may have played a role in this as Æthelbald probably feared that his father&#x27;s young wife, the great-granddaughter of Charlemagne, would give birth to a higher-born heir than himself. In addition, some of the nobles were outraged that Judith was crowned and called queen, contrary to local custom.

According to other explanations, Æthelbald had already been rebelling before his father&#x27;s new marriage, and this was why Æthelwulf stayed at the court of Charles the Bald and married his daughter, demonstrating to his subjects that he had strong supporters abroad. In the end, father and son negotiated a compromise under which Æthelwulf kept the eastern districts of the kingdom and Æthelbald received the western. It is not known whether this meant that Æthelwulf took Kent and Æthelbald Wessex, or Wessex itself was divided.

Judith had no children from Æthelwulf, who died on 13 January 858.

===Controversial second marriage===
Upon the death of Æthelwulf, Æthelbald succeeded him on the throne of Wessex and married his stepmother. By agreeing to this marriage, Judith may have tried to avoid the usual fate of widows, being sent to a convent. To Æthelbald, this marriage was advantageous both because Judith belonged to the Carolingian dynasty and because she had already been consecrated as a queen, the marriage thus enhancing his status and placing him above his brothers. Judith&#x27;s name appears in several charters during the reign of Æthelbald, including in S1274 as &quot;regina&quot;, which confirms her continued exceptional status. Asser, Bishop of Sherborne condemned the marriage in his &quot;Life of Alfred the Great&quot;: 
Asser&#x27;s additional comment on the &quot;great disgrace&quot; was not reflected in contemporary Frankish records. His assertion that marriage is contrary to even pagan practice is refuted by the marriage of Eadbald, King of Kent (died 640) to his father&#x27;s widow Emma of Austrasia in 616. Judith was still childless when Æthelbald died on 20 December 860, after a reign and marriage of two and a half years.

==Third marriage==
===Kidnapping or elopement===

Æthelbald&#x27;s death left Judith with no future in Wessex. She was still no more than seventeen years old and childless. According to the &quot;Annales Bertiniani&quot; and Flodoard, she 

According to the most likely account, a certain Baldwin (born probably in the 830s – 879), traditionally regarded as the son of a forester called Odoacre visited the monastery in 861, and according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, he fell in love with Judith. There are claims that he had already been interested in her before her first marriage. Around the Christmas of 861, or in early 862, Judith either fled with Baldwin or was kidnapped by him. According to one contemporary source, Judith was not abducted but eloped with the consent of her brother Louis:

Flodoard&#x27;s description is similar:

The couple probably married in the monastery of Senlis before eloping.

===Excommunication===
Judith&#x27;s father was furious because of the kidnapping/elopement. He immediately organised search parties to bring her home and capture Baldwin. Flodoard mentioned a letter from Archbishop Hincmar of Reims to Bishop Hunger of Utrecht in which he informed Hunger of Baldwin&#x27;s excommunication for kidnapping Judith and marrying her without royal consent. Contemporary chronicles state that in 862 Charles the Bald held a council with the bishops and nobles of his kingdom. According to Hincmar, the king ordered (or, by Flodoard&#x27;s account, asked) the bishops to pass a canonical verdict on Baldwin and Judith, as commanded by the decrees of Pope Gregory II: “if anyone marries, having kidnapped a widow, let him be anathematized himself, as well as those who contributed to this”. Judith&#x27;s brother Louis was also punished by imprisonment in the Abbey of Saint Martin.

Meanwhile, Judith and Baldwin sought refuge with the Viking Rorik of Dorestad, King of Friesland (circa 810 – circa 880) and later fled to the court of Judith&#x27;s paternal cousin Lothair II, King of Lotharingia. Eventually, they travelled to Rome in order to plead their case to Pope Nicholas I.

===Reconciliation with her father===
In Rome, Judith and Baldwin negotiated with the pope. He listened to their arguments and sent his legates Radoald, Bishop of Porto and John, Bishop of Cervia to her father. They asked Charles to recognize the marriage as legally binding and welcome the young couple, but Charles and Archbishop Hincmar were not easy to convince. In a letter dated to 23 November 862, the Pope expressed his fear that Baldwin might have already joined forces with the &quot;Jute prince Rorik&quot;. Rorik had already fought against King Charles on the side of his brother Lothair I, then-Emperor of the Romans (795–855). According to Flodoard, in 863

According to the later chronicler Albert of Stade, Bishop Hunger turned to Rorik urging him not to provide any support to Baldwin.
Eventually, King Charles the Bald reluctantly forgave the couple and allowed them to marry. They returned to West Francia and were officially married at Auxerre on 13 December 862 or in 863. The king was not present, but gave Baldwin the March of Flanders, making him a peer of the kingdom. Not much later, he also gave him Ternois, Waas and the lay abbacy of Saint Peter in Ghent.

=== Margravine of Flanders ===
Some scholars have suggested that the king hoped for Baldwin&#x27;s early death by giving him land just south of the Scheldt river, a region frequently attacked by the Vikings. Baldwin, however, managed the situation well, successfully quelling the Viking threat, earning the nickname of &quot;Iron&quot; from his contemporaries, which later generations replaced with the nickname &quot;Iron Hand&quot;. He expanded both his army and his territory quickly and became a faithful supporter of his father-in-law. His possessions would become known as the County of Flanders, one of the most powerful domains in France.

Baldwin chose a small island in Flanders as his residence, formed at the confluence of the Boterbeke and Roya rivers. There stood a fortress, possibly built by Vikings, surrounded by a small number of huts, named Bruggia. As it was in ruins, Baldwin built a new fortress with a personal residence, a chapel, houses for the servants and a cathedral where the relics of Saint Donatian of Reims were placed. The home of Judith and Baldwin stood where now the Palace of Justice and the Town Hall are, and the cathedral was located on the north side of the current Palace of Justice. It included a mint and was surrounded by a high wall with four gates, fortified with rising lattices and drawbridges. Ruins of buildings still remain, including what probably used to be the baptismal chapel behind the crypt of Saint Basil. 
Judith had children from her third marriage, at least three sons and maybe two daughters. The exact date of her death is unknown, but it is believed to have happened no earlier than 870. Between 893 and 899, her eldest surviving son Baldwin II married Ælfthryth, daughter of Alfred the Great, King of the Anglo-Saxons (previously King of Wessex), son of Judith&#x27;s first husband and brother of the second. If Judith was alive at this time, she probably played an instrumental role in the marriage negotiations due to her knowledge of the Wessex court. Judith&#x27;s husband Baldwin died in 879 in Arras and was buried in the Abbey of Saint-Bertin near Saint-Omer.

==Legacy==
In the middle of the 10th century, Judith was described by the compilers of the genealogy of the counts of Flanders as &quot;the wisest and most beautiful&quot;, the woman who brought Carolingian blood to the comital dynasty. The anointing and coronation of Judith as Queen of Wessex allowed the restoration of the status of wives of kings and improved their position.

==Issue==
From her marriage with Baldwin I of Flanders, Judith had at least three sons:
* Charles (c. 864/865 – died young), named after his maternal grandfather. He was recorded as &quot;Karolus brevis vite&quot; in the list of counts of Flanders in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin. It is usually assumed that Charles died young, as no other reference to him has been found.
* Baldwin (c. 865/867 – c. 10 September 918), named after his father and succeeded him in 879 as Baldwin II, Margrave of Flanders. He married Ælfthryth of Wessex between 893 and 899.
* Ralph (c. 867/870 – murdered 17 June 896), recorded as &quot;&quot;Rodolphus Cameracensis comes&quot; in the Cartulaire de Saint-Bertin. He was installed as Count of Cambrai around 888 and killed by Herbert I of Vermandois.

In addition, two daughters are sometimes attributed to Judith and Baldwin, although both of these accounts should be treated with caution as they are based on unreliable sources:

* The mother of Walter. The &quot;History of Waulsort Monastery&quot; speaks of a &quot;Walterus...Rodulfi sororis filius&quot;&quot; (Walter, son of Ralph&#x27;s sister), recording that he attempted to avenge the death of his maternal uncle, Ralph of Cambrai. No other reference to this person has been found.
* Guinidilde or Gunhild (died before 19 February 904), who married Wilfred the Hairy, Count of Barcelona before 27 June 875. According to Allison Weir, this parentage is confirmed in the &quot;Gestis Comitum Barcinonensium&quot;, which records that Charles the Bald gave an unnamed daughter of the count of Flanders in marriage to a certain Pilosi at the same time as granting him the County of Barcelona.

<doc id="912227" wikidata="Q5986465" url="?curid=912227" title="Icicle hitch">
<text>An icicle hitch is a knot that is used for connecting to a post when weight is applied to an end running parallel to the post in a specific direction. This type of hitch will hold its place even when holding a substantial load on a smooth surface. One can even suspend from a tapered post (such as a marlinspike) with this knot (hence the name &quot;icicle hitch&quot;). 

To tie an icicle hitch, bring the working end over the post, front to back, four or five times, working away from the end of the post (and the direction of expected pull). Bring the working end, back to front, alongside the standing end, leaving a substantial bight hanging behind the post. Bring this bight over both ends and over the end of the post. Tighten by pulling both ends perpendicular to the post. The pull on the standing end (running the direction of the post) will tighten the knot as more pull is given.

This knot is in the class of knots as the Prusik, klemheist, &amp; Hedden knots --the &quot;slip-and-grip&quot; friction type, which pull tight when the load is applied (in the correct direction) and slide easily for re-placement with no load. The Prusik knot can withstand load in both directions, making it ideal for climbing situations. The icicle, like the klemheist, attaches to the hitched object and coils away from its pulling end, and relies on a constriction like the Chinese finger trap --under pull, the coil is drawn longer and thus tighter; whereas in the Hedden (&amp; rolling hitch) the loading tightens the coil at its far end.

The icicle hitch was developed by John Smith of the International Guild of Knot Tyers, and demonstrated by him at the Guild’s eighth annual general meeting in 1990. It was published in the IGKT&#x27;s quarterly newsletter, Knotting Matters, in issue #32 (Summer 1990), pp.6,7.

<text>Megen or Meghem is a small city in the southern part of the Netherlands, in the province North Brabant, close to the river Maas. It is part of the Oss municipality. The number of inhabitants is approximately 1700.

== History ==
Megen used to be the capital of the feudal County of Megen (including Haren, Macharen and Teeffelen) that was founded around 1145. City rights were obtained in 1357. Of the two castles Megen used to have, only one tower is remaining.

In 1810, the County of Megen became a municipality, to which Haren and Macharen were added in 1821. The municipality of Megen, Haren en Macharen became a part of the municipality Oss in 1994.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
In 1803 became one of the eponymous components of the Apostolic Vicariate of Ravenstein-Megen, a Roman Catholic pre-diocesan jurisdiction which was suppressed in 1853, its territory merged into the Diocese of ’s-Hertogenbosch.

Currently, there are two monasteries in Megen. One is inhabited by the Clarissas (also called the Poor Clares), followers of St. Clare of Assisi. The other is occupied by the Franciscans, followers of St. Francis of Assisi.

<doc id="912232" wikidata="Q5124055" url="?curid=912232" title="Citybus (Hong Kong)">
<text>Citybus Limited () is a bus company which provides both franchised and non-franchised service in Hong Kong. The franchised route network serves Hong Kong Island, cross-harbour routes (between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon/New Territories), North Lantau (Tung Chung and Hong Kong Disneyland), Hong Kong International Airport, Kowloon, New Territories, Shenzhen Bay Port and Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Hong Kong Port. The non-franchised routes serve mainly City One Sha Tin. It also provides bus rental services and staff bus services for some large companies, such as TVB and China Light and Power.

From 1984 to 2001, the company offered a cross-border service between Hong Kong and mainland China using mainly double-decker Leyland Olympians, but this was discontinued due to stiff competition. However, in 2007, Citybus began operating route B3, which goes to Shenzhen Bay Port.

Since August 2020, the company has been wholly owned by Bravo Transport, which also owned the then-third largest operator, New World First Bus (NWFB). Prior to this, both NWFB and Citybus were owned by NWS Holdings and its predecessors. On 1 July 2023, the NWFB operations merged into Citybus.

==History==
Citybus was founded on 5 August 1979, by former China Motor Bus traffic manager Lyndon Rees with one Volvo B55 double-deck bus, providing a shuttle service for the Hong Kong United Dockyard in Hung Hom. In 1981, it commenced operating a residential bus route between City One Shatin and Kowloon Tong MTR station, which provided an innovative &quot;breakfast bus&quot; service. In 1982, the United Transport Group purchased a 49% shareholding.

In 1984, Citybus began a cross-boundary coach service between Hong Kong and Shenzhen with ex National Travel West and West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive Eastern Coach Works bodied Leyland Olympians. In 1985, the company introduced five air-conditioned Olympian coaches. Since then it has continued to expand its fleet of air-conditioned buses.

In the late 1980s, Citybus was purchased by Tsui Tsin-tong&#x27;s CNT Group. It commenced operating residential bus services with 100 new Olympians linking housing estates to MTR stations.

In December 1990, Citybus launched Capital Citybus in London with an all-yellow livery for the routes in North and East London and a red and yellow livery for central London.
This was sold to FirstGroup in July 1998 and renamed First Capital.

In 1991, the Hong Kong Government awarded Citybus its first franchised route, 12A (Admiralty Tamar Street to Macdonnell Road) on Hong Kong Island, which was originally operated by China Motor Bus and then withdrawn in the 1980s.

In September 1993, Citybus took over 26 franchised routes from China Motor Bus after winning a competitive tender. These were branded as Network 26. To operate these, a fleet of 101 Leyland Atlanteans was purchased from Singapore Bus Service. A further 14 franchised routes were awarded to the company in 1995 without tendering, with the fleet now expanded to more than 500 buses. During these years Citybus expanded its penetration of the Hong Kong Island market pushing nearly all China Motor Bus routes into low profitability.

In 1996, with the Tsing Ma Bridge coming into operation and the commencement of settlement in the Tung Chung new town, Citybus won another tender to operate 13 new franchised routes serving Tung Chung and the new Hong Kong International Airport. In 1998, the airport Cityflyer service commenced, which is part of Citybus and is solely used for Airport express routes to the city. The Cityflyer service consisted of a series of four routes: A11, A12, A21 and A22, with A10 being added in 2006. Citybus also operates various Overnight Airport routes and Airport Shuttle Routes.

In 1998, following the expiration of the franchise of China Motor Bus, a further 12 routes were transferred to Citybus. Citybus&#x27;s fleet was up to 1,100 buses. The remaining routes of China Motor Bus were transferred to a new operator, New World First Bus.

Its business was expanded into mainland China with a joint venture operation in Beijing through Citybus (China) Limited. It was not only Beijing&#x27;s first joint venture bus operation, but it also marked the introduction of air-conditioned buses for the first time in the capital city. Following the success of this route, a second urban express coach route was introduced in Beijing. However, the services in Beijing were terminated shortly after the disposal of shares of Citybus (China) Limited from Citybus to Kingsman Global Limited, another Hong Kong company, in June 2004. Citybus had also once operated a route (route 658) in Tianjin. The service is now operated by another company after Citybus disposed all its interest in Citybus (China) Limited.

In July 1999, Citybus was purchased by Stagecoach Group of Scotland. In 2001, the cross-boundary coach service between China and Hong Kong was discontinued.

In June 2003, Stagecoach Group sold Citybus to Chow Tai Fook Enterprises, the parent company of the major rival operator New World First Bus. After a series of restructurings, Citybus became a subsidiary of NWS Holdings, which was also the parent company of New World First Bus and New World First Ferry.

In August 2020, along with New World First Bus, Citybus was sold to the Bravo Transport consortium, made up of private equity firm Templewater Bravo, Hong Kong-listed investment holding company Hans Energy and British bus operator Ascendal Group. The founder of Ascendal Group, Adam Leishman, also became the CEO of Bravo Transport.

In July 2022, Bravo Transport announced that it would be discontinuing the New World First Bus brand, and the NWFB operations merged into Citybus on 1 July 2023, when the bus franchises were renewed.

<text>″s-Heerenberg is a city on the Dutch-German border, in the Province of Gelderland, Netherlands. It is located about 5 km north of the German Emmerich, and about south of Doetinchem. It received city rights in 1379.

&#x27;s-Heerenberg is the location of one of the most important castles of the Netherlands: Huis Bergh. The Huis Bergh contains a panel of the Archangel Gabriel from the famous altar piece Maestà by Duccio. The castle is surrounded to the west by a forest, part of the larger nature reserve Bergherbos.

Mechteld ten Ham was accused of sorcery. She demanded a trial, and failed the water test, because she remained floating on the water. During torture, she confessed to being a witch, and was burnt at the stake on 25 July 1605. In 2004, a statue was revealed in her honour. In 2015, her statue was set on fire.

Until 1821 &#x27;s-Heerenberg was a separate municipality; it then became the administrative center of Bergh. Since 2005 it is part of the municipality of Montferland. The border canal &#x27;Grenskanaal&#x27; constitutes the border to Germany. Industrial parks &#x27;t Goor and the Immenhorst are situated near this border.

The annual Montferland Run road running competition is held in &#x27;s-Heerenberg every December. The race has been previously won by world-class runners like Haile Gebrselassie, Kenenisa Bekele, Lornah Kiplagat and Paula Radcliffe.

<doc id="912242" wikidata="Q2300416" url="?curid=912242" title="Toyota Soarer">
<text>The is a personal luxury GT coupé produced from 1981 to 2005 by Toyota and sold in Japan. It was available at both Japanese Toyota dealerships called &quot;Toyota Store&quot; and &quot;Toyopet Store&quot;, and it debuted with the Z10 series, replacing the &quot;Toyopet Store&quot; exclusive Mark II coupé, the &quot;Toyota Auto Store&quot; exclusive Chaser coupé, and both the &quot;Toyota Store&quot; exclusive Crown coupé and Carina coupé.

In 1986, the Z20 series Soarer was launched, based on the then-new A70 series Supra platform, which was exclusive to &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations. In 1991, the Z30 series Soarer premiered in Japan, while its Lexus equivalent, the SC 300/400, debuted in the US market.

While externally identical to the SC, the Z30 series Soarer lineup offered different powertrain specifications and multiple unique vehicle configurations. In 2001, Toyota introduced a convertible-only successor in Japan as the Z40 series Soarer and elsewhere as the SC 430. In contrast to the previous series, the Z40 series Soarer and SC were based on a single model and were largely equivalent. In 2005, following the introduction of Lexus in Japan, the Soarer name and emblem were discontinued, and the Z40 model became the SC 430 in common with worldwide markets.

When introduced in Japan, the Soarer competed with the Nissan Skyline, Nissan Leopard, and Mazda Cosmo coupes and served as Toyota&#x27;s &quot;halo car,&quot; introducing new technologies before they were installed on other Toyota products. All versions of the Soarer featured a unique winged lion emblem (often mistakenly called a Griffin) as the logo throughout the vehicle.


== First generation (1981–1985)==

The Soarer, introduced as the EX-8, first appeared at the 1980 Osaka International Motor Show. At its introduction in 1981, it won the Car of the Year Japan Award. Toyota sought to introduce a grand touring coupe, offering a powerful straight-six engine, luxurious accommodations, and a modern, aerodynamic appearance. Internationally, personal luxury cars were popular in the West, and Toyota saw an opportunity to offer the same type of car to Japanese buyers. The Soarer complied with Japanese external dimension regulations, and the first-generation models were classified as &quot;compacts,&quot; which gave Japanese buyers tax-saving advantages. The engine displacements were also limited to above 2 liters but below 3 liters, so Japanese buyers could determine how much annual road tax they were willing to pay.

It debuted with a rear-wheel-drive configuration based on the A60 Supra, which utilized MacPherson struts for the front, with a semi-trailing arm rear suspension with coil springs. Cruise control, audible warning messages, 7-way adjustable driver&#x27;s seat, digital Automatic climate control, and digital speed and tachometer display using LEDs were included on top and mid-model trim packages. At the same time, ventilated disc brakes for all wheels and self-diagnosis maintenance reminders, among other electronic features, were standard equipment.

The AM/FM stereo cassette had the ability to record on higher-quality metal tapes. On the face of the stereo was a microphone jack that would accommodate a microphone. If it was installed with a digital instrument cluster a trip computer was included. The digital cluster featured a digital tachometer, digital speedometer, electronic fuel, and coolant level gauges. The trip computer could calculate and display various things such as fuel economy in kilometers-per-liter, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and distance remaining to the destination. It was offered in four exterior colors with contrasting dark gray or dark brown interiors, while the six trim packages offered optional equipment as standard on the three top-level packages. The trim package names were the 2800GT-Extra, 2800GT, 2000VX, 2000VR, 2000V II with the entry-level 2000V I.

When the mid-model refresh was introduced, several technological improvements were added. The digital speedometer was augmented with Electro MultiVision display, on the 3.0 GT-Limited with the automatic transmission installed. It consisted of a six-inch CRT TV display installed in the instrument cluster showing engine revolutions, shift position, fuel consumption trends, and TEMS suspension settings. It would also notify if any maintenance warnings on linked systems should be done. Different functions would be displayed by touching a button; however, the screen was not touch-sensitive. If the car was stationary with the transmission in park and the parking brake applied, broadcast TV could be watched.

The Soarer was the first Toyota automobile with Toyota Electronic Modulated Suspension (TEMS) and an all-new double wishbone suspension was installed for the front and rear wheels, labeled as PEGASUS (Precision Engineered Geometrically Advanced SUSpension) to accommodate the adjustable shock absorbers and anti-lock brakes were included. All mid-model refresh cars can be distinguished by where the side view mirrors are installed, whereby after 1983, the mirrors were relocated to the doors. The trim package names were updated to the 2.8 GT-Limited, 2.8 GT, 2.0 GT, 2.0 Turbo, 2.0VX, and 2.0VR with the entry-level 2.0V II, and for 1984 the 2.8 engine was upgraded to the 3.0-liter engine.

The Z10 series Toyota Soarer was produced from February 1981 to December 1985 in 2.0L, 2.8L, or 3.0L DOHC I-6 variants, and all engines came standard with electronic fuel injection. Early M-TEU-powered MZ11 models were different from later MZ11s in some regards. Later improvements to the MZ11 engine included a water-to-air intercooler, and further enhancements were made to an oil-and-water-cooled turbo, as opposed to the oil-cooled-only turbo in the early MZ11s.

== Second generation (1986-1991) ==
The Z20 series Toyota Soarer was produced from January 1986 to April 1991 and was available in several variants.
The styling of the second-generation Soarer is similar of that of the X80 series Cressida, Mark II, Chaser and Cresta. The Soarer shared its platform with the newly introduced A70 series Supra.

The Z20 Soarer revised the previous generation Electro MultiVision CRT display installation from the instrument cluster to a location below the automatic climate control, which could be upgraded to a touch-sensitive interface. A new feature offered navigation information uploaded by the use of cassette tapes then upgraded to CD-ROM. The digital speedometer display was upgraded and provided more information at a glance. The cloth upholstery was unique to each trim package, and the sport bucket seats used in the Toyota Supra (A70) were offered only on GT trim packages upholstered in cloth or leather.

In 1986, the electronically controlled (TEMS) carried over from the previous generation, and the double wishbone suspension was now shared with the A70 Supra. An electronically controlled airbag suspension was also available on the GT Limited model.

In 1988, TOM&#x27;S released a limited-model package for the 7M-GTE equipped vehicles named the C5. The TOM&#x27;S C5 Soarer could be optioned with a remapped ECU, larger turbocharger compressor, a woven fibre intake pipe, KYB shock absorbers with lowered springs, bespoke 16x8&quot; ±50 TOM&#x27;S C5 wheels that were manufactured by Ray&#x27;s Engineering and TOM&#x27;S C5 badges for the rear of the vehicle.

In April 1989, a limited 500-unit variant called the Aerocabin was introduced. This variant had only 2 seats and an electric folding roof. The Aerocabin had the same specs as the GT-Limited but was only available with the 7M-GTE engine, 4-speed automatic transmission, tan leather interior, and pearlescent paint.

In 1988, the Soarer Z20 was given a facelift. The grille and rear taillights were redesigned and minor interior changes were made (climate control, dash). Other than that engines were improved:
* 1G-GTEU 
* 7M-GTEU 

Unlike the A70 Supra, the 2.5 L twin turbo 1JZ-GTE was not made available for the Z20 Soarer. However, all models built from May 1989 including the Aerocabin did have a revised crossmember.


== Third generation (1991-2000) ==


In 1987, following the design freeze of Lexus division&#x27;s flagship UCF10 LS 400 (Celsior) sedan due in 1989, Toyota commissioned its California design studio Calty to develop a new luxury coupe. In mid 1991, the vehicle designed by the studio debuted in the U.S. as the Lexus SC 300/400. 

That same year, Toyota debuted the third-generation Z30 series Soarer in Japan, replacing the Z20 series. The Z30 series Soarer shared the body and key components with the Lexus SC, with different interior features, powertrain configurations, and enhanced performance. The trim packages were the 4.0 GT-Limited, 4.0 GT, 2.5 GT-TwinTurbo-L and the 2.5 GT-TwinTurbo.

The new Soarer continued some of the features of earlier models, such as digital dashboard instrumentation and integrated car systems control via the in-dash &quot;EMV&quot; touchscreen. It was also one of the first cars in the world to feature a factory GPS automotive navigation system via CD-ROM overlaid with VICS traffic information for Japanese driving conditions. This generation of the Soarer was considered an expensive and extravagant luxury car in Japan. It was longer and wider than a Crown, while comfortably accommodating two passengers, with only modest space available for rear seat passengers. It did not comply with Japanese Government dimension regulations which made buyers liable for yearly taxes due to its size. The larger engines also obliged Japanese buyers to pay more annual road tax.

One of the distinctive features was the articulating door hinges. When the doors opened, the hinges moved out and forward, allowing entry and exit in confined spaces.

From launch in 1991 until 2000 all models were available with a 4-speed automatic transmission. In addition, the sportier JZZ30 Soarer could be had with a 5-speed manual transmission. All models were available with a Torsen torque-sensing differential. Unlike their US Lexus equivalents, the Z30-series Soarer lineup never received a 5-speed automatic, and only the six-cylinder versions received variable valve timing (VVTi) engines, in 1996. 

Styling-wise, the Soarer received only minor changes during its 9-year production run, mostly external. External changes were shared with the U.S Lexus models. Changes were:
* Series 1, May 1991 - December 1993: original body and style.
From May 1992 Series 1 received an update with heated seats and exterior temperature display.
* Series 2, January 1994 - August 1996: new front bumper with one-piece lower grille, fog lights replace cornering lights, new tail lights.
* Series 3, August 1996 - December 2000: new front bumper with upper grille, oval fog lights, new tail lights, longer rear bumper, standard side skirts, elevated rear spoiler, body stripe.

Starting in 1997, the Soarer was used as a high speed patrol car in multiple Japanese prefectures, using the 2.5GT trim with a 5-speed manual transmission.

===Z30 series Soarer models===
===JZZ30 Soarer===
The JZZ30 was the only model sold continuously from the introduction of the 30 series in 1991 until production ceased in 2000. As the sportiest model in the range it was also the only one available with a R154 manual transmission. Like other models in the range there were two different equipment grades available, the base GT-T and the better-equipped GT-TL which added electric seats, wood trim, cruise control and Toyota&#x27;s &quot;TEMS&quot; electronic damper adjustment to the list of standard features.

The JZZ30 was powered by the 2.5-litre &quot;1JZ-GTE&quot; turbocharged engine. Initially featuring two identical small turbos running together (unlike the sequential twin turbo systems of the Supra and Mazda RX-7, for example), it was officially rated at and of torque at 4,800 rpm. This was in keeping with the Japanese Manufacturers&#x27; advertised power limit agreement, however real-world power outputs were somewhat higher. In August 1996, the engine received Toyota&#x27;s variable valve timing system (VVTi) and in conjunction with a single, more efficient turbocharger, produced much better high and mid-range torque and better fuel economy. Official power output remained limited to 280 PS, although torque was now at 2,400 rpm.

===JZZ31 Soarer===
While the Lexus SC300 was available from the start of the new series&#x27; US introduction in 1991, the equivalent Japan-market Soarer model — the JZZ31 — was not introduced until 1994, where it was marketed as the &quot;new base model&quot; Soarer. 1994 also saw the introduction of the new black interior colour scheme which replaced the grey colour scheme used in blue, red, and black external colour cars until the end of 1993. The JZZ31 was the only one of the two JZZ models to feature manually adjustable black leather seats. The black interior scheme became the prominent interior scheme for all Japanese Soarers by the end of production.

The JZZ31 was powered by the 3-litre 2JZ-GE engine, which initially was rated at at 5,800 rpm and of torque at 4,800 rpm. Like the JZZ30 the engine also received Toyota&#x27;s VVTi system in 1997 which increased output to at 6,000 rpm and at 4,000 rpm while simultaneously improving fuel economy. 

While the increasing cost and slowing sales of the V8 models in the mid-to-late 1990s led to their discontinuation, the six-cylinder JZZ31 and JZZ30 were to remain in production until the Z30 series was replaced by the Z40 series in 2001.

===UZZ30 Soarer===
The UZZ30 was introduced in Japan as the &#x27;base&#x27; model of the V8 powered 30 series lineup. Fitted with the same 4.0-litre quad-cam V8 as the UZZ31/32, it benefited in the performance stakes due to its considerably lighter weight. The UZZ30 used a standard Tokico coilover suspension setup, basic stereo system, manual steering column, and very few electronic aids. While the UZZ31 and UZZ32 models had electrically adjusted heated leather seats with memory, those in the UZZ30 were upholstered in velour and had no heating or memory. The UZZ30 also came without sunroof or rear wiper. As the car was substantially lighter due to the exclusion of all the luxury amenities, it was a considered a driver&#x27;s car, with good power, handling and braking.

The UZZ30 series Soarer was used as the base vehicle for the Lexus SC400 (model code UZZ30) exported to the United States, although to satisfy U.S. requirements, a comprehensive range of luxury options was offered, including some features of the UZZ31, such as seat memory position, traction control, sunroof, sun visors with courtesy light and electronic steering position adjustment. Local Japanese Soarers had an electronic dashboard which used an integral mirror to display the instruments holographically. This design was never offered on a USA spec model. Those cars came with a standard dash layout of round dials and lit needles similar to the LS400 Lexus sedan. Whereas the left hand drive version of UZZ30 was made throughout the entire 9-year production run, the right hand drive version was made from 1991 until 1993.

===UZZ31 Soarer &quot;Limited&quot;===
The UZZ31 and UZZ32 Soarers were the luxury GT versions of the range, with more features and equipment than the UZZ30 and the 6-cylinder models, and even the U.S market Lexus SC300/400. The &quot;EMV&quot; (Electro Multi Vision) touchscreen system which was pioneered in the Z10 and Z20 Soarers was again available and provided a screen with television, GPS navigation, diagnostics, car computer, reversing camera and touch control of all functions of the climate control and audio system. The latter was highly sophisticated, with balanced-signal digital signal processing, 12-disc CD stacker and 7 speakers with subwoofer.

All three V8 models were powered by Toyota&#x27;s acclaimed 1UZ-FE quad-cam all-alloy 4-litre V8. While rated at marginally less power and torque than the turbocharged JZZ30 counterpart ( at 5,400 rpm, at 4,600 rpm) the V8, called the 4.0GT-L was renowned for its smoothness and refinement. Although receiving a minor update in 1995 which improved responsiveness and bumped outputs to , production of the V8-equipped Soarers ended before the powerplant received VVTi which substantially increased outputs in the Lexus SC400 and other models. 

The UZZ31 featured a driver-adjustable air suspension system that had two settings for both ride height and damper stiffness. The high-pressure air was provided by an electric pump mounted at the front of the car. Also featured on the UZZ31 series were a host of electronic features including automatic headlights (shared also with the UZZ30), speed-sensitive wipers, electric-controlled 2-position memory seats with heated feature as an additional factory option, electronically adjustable steering column with memory, optional reversing camera, cabin air purifying system (also shared with the JZZ31 from 1994), touch screen TV with 12-stack CD player, touch screen SatNav, and a full onboard computer diagnostic system which would output to the TV display unit. Like the JZZ30, the UZZ31 came with optional sunroof and rear wiper.

Additionally, the UZZ31 could be &quot;special ordered&quot; from Toyota Japan without the EMV, instead being fitted with the radio/CD unit of the UZZ30 with separate climate control. Additionally, electric velour seats from the UZZ30 and JZZ30 models could be special ordered in place of the standard UZZ31 / UZZ32 leather electric seats. These special-order cars would take only a week to produce from the time of the order to completed product. It is not known how many non-EMV UZZ31s were made, although they were offered from the very start of production in 1991. These non-EMV UZZ31 Soarers are uncommon, with only the UZZ32 more rare.

===UZZ32 Soarer &quot;Limited&quot;===
The UZZ32 was the top-of-the-line 30 series, featuring all of the options available on the UZZ31 with the addition of the computer-controlled Toyota Active Control Suspension with four-wheel steering. The UZZ32 had no conventional suspension springs or anti-roll (stabiliser) bars, instead utilising self-levelling, fully hydropneumatic struts controlled by an array of sensors (such as axis accelerometers, suspension height, wheel speed and steering angle) that detected cornering, acceleration and braking forces.

The system worked well and gave an unusually controlled yet smooth ride with no body roll. However, the additional weight of hydraulic componentry and power requirements of the system affected performance and reduced fuel economy compared to the standard UZZ30 and UZZ31 models.

The car was also costly to produce and at over in 1995, expensive to buy. As a result, only 873 UZZ32s were made and are typically the most sought-after model in right-hand drive markets such as the Japan, UK, Australia and New Zealand.

===Colours===
Japanese Soarers were available in many colours. Some were offered continuously throughout the run and some as limited runs or one-offs. These colour runs did not always match the equivalent U.S. market offerings on the Lexus SC.

From 1991 until 1993, Soarers with external paint codes 8J5 and 202 came with a grey interior colour scheme. Those in 6M2 were available with both grey and &quot;spruce&quot; (blue-grey) interior schemes. Models in 3k3 could have grey or tan interiors. Models with paint codes 4k9, 051 (1991-1998) and 057 (1998-2000) came with tan interiors exclusively. Similarly, those with paint code 176 and 6M3 came with spruce interior colour exclusively.

From 1994, a black interior scheme replaced grey (becoming the predominant interior colour from 1998-2000) and from 1994-2000, cars with external paint code 202 came exclusively with the black interior. Models in 3L2 were available with either black or tan interiors.

In 1995, a limited edition was offered with Baltic Blue Metallic (752) paint that was shared with the 1993-1996 Toyota Supra and the 1994-1999 Toyota Celica. Roughly 199 SC300s were imported into the USA with this exterior paint code and tan only interior, as well as 256 SC400s. 

In 1996, exterior colour 6P2 replaced exterior colour 6M2 and 8L5 replaced 8J5. The spruce interior was discontinued in 1998. Thereafter, models in 1A0 and 1C0 which had come with spruce interiors were changed to black interiors and 6P2 cars became available with black or tan interior schemes.

== Fourth generation (2001-2005) ==

The 40 series Soarer model was largely identical to its Lexus equivalent, sold outside Japan as the Lexus SC 430 since 2001. The Z40 series Soarer 430SCV featured a hardtop which could fold into the boot of the car, in the fashion of the contemporary Mercedes-Benz SL. The coupe was equipped with the 3UZ-FE VVTi (variable valve timing) 4.3-litre V8 engine, as was available in the Lexus LS 430 luxury sedan. It was rated at and of torque. This enabled the coupe to accelerate from a standstill to in 6 seconds. The shared body style of the Z40 series Soarer/SC 430 was developed by Toyota designers at design studios in France and Japan. Compared with the Z30 series, some observers generally considered the fourth generation a retreat in visual style due to its more compact and top heavy appearance. 

With the Z40 series Soarer, design and production synergies culminated in the development of a single shared design configuration for both the Soarer and Lexus models, unlike the previous generations. The rise of Lexus as Toyota&#x27;s premium worldwide marque also contributed to the design focus on the Lexus model configuration rather than a separate Toyota-branded series of Soarer coupes. On July 26, 2005, Lexus was introduced in Japan with the 2006 SC 430 TSOOH in its lineup. The debut of Lexus and the SC 430 coincided with the conclusion of Toyota Soarer sales.

<text>Hagestein is a village and former city in the municipality of Vijfheerenlanden, Utrecht, Netherlands, on the Lek River, about 2 km east of Vianen. It received city rights in 1382. Hagestein was destroyed in 1405 by the Count of Holland and the Prince-Bishop of Utrecht.

Hagestein was a separate municipality between 1818 and 1986, when it merged with Vianen. Until 2002, it was a part of the province of South Holland.

== History ==
It was first mentioned in 1228 as Gaspewerde which meant land on the river Gaasp. In 1274 it was known as Hagesteine meaning &quot;fenced off terrain around a stone building&quot;. Hagestein developed along the Lek River. Around 1250, was built. In 1382, it received city rights from Otto van Arkel. Neighbouring Vianen felt threatened by the new city, and in 1405, Hagestein was taken by the Count of Holland and the Prince-Bishop of Utrecht who destroyed the entire settlement. Holland was grateful for the help of Utrecht, and awarded Hagestein to the Prince-Bishop.

Hagestein re-emerged as a small village without fortifications. The Dutch Reformed Church has 13th century elements. It burnt down around 1600 and was redesigned between 1829 and 1830. In 1546, a new small castle was built in Hagestein, but was demolished in 1855. In 1821, the village was moved to South Holland. In 1840, Hagestein was home to 655 people. In 2002, it was returned to Utrecht.

<doc id="912262" wikidata="Q1139119" url="?curid=912262" title="Nicholas Gonzalez">
<text>Nicholas Edward Gonzalez is an American actor. He is best known for portraying the roles of Alex Santiago on the Showtime television series &quot;Resurrection Blvd&quot;, Dr. Ben Douglas in (2004) and Dr. Neil Melendez on the ABC television series &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;.

==Early life==
Gonzalez was born in San Antonio, Texas. He is of Mexican descent. He is the son of a dermatologist surgeon, Dr. John Gonzalez, and his mother is Sylvia Mosier. He has an older brother named John Joseph Gonzalez and a younger sister named Madeline Mosier. Gonzalez is conversant in Spanish, having lived in a bilingual household. He attended Central Catholic High School in San Antonio, where he was an accomplished cross-country and track runner, winning the Texas State Championship in the mile and two-mile. After graduating in 1994 and turning down a presidential appointment to West Point, Gonzalez pursued an English degree at Stanford University in California. He spent two terms at Oxford University in England. The following summer, he returned to Europe on a research grant where he studied at Oxford and Trinity College, Dublin to complete his thesis on James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. While at Stanford he had chanced on acting after taking an improvisational theatre elective and began taking part in student theater. He was approached to do a one-man theater piece called &quot;Gas&quot; by María Irene Fornés. Alma Martinez, an actress and Stanford professor, encouraged him to become a professional actor.

Upon graduating from Stanford in 1998 Gonzalez decided to pursue acting and, with Martinez&#x27;s help, connected with the theatrical movement in San Francisco. He was once encouraged to use his middle name Edward to conceal his ethnicity and go by &quot;Nicholas Edward&quot; but declined to do so.

==Career==
In 1998, Gonzalez moved to Los Angeles, where he landed small parts in television series such as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Dharma and Greg&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;One World&quot;.

Gonzalez then appeared as Fidel Castro&#x27;s son in the Lifetime television movie &quot;My Little Assassin&quot;, starring Joe Mantegna and Gabrielle Anwar. His role as Andy, the gay yuppie on MTV&#x27;s &quot;Undressed&quot; in which he appeared for six episodes, gained his first widespread attention.

Gonzalez wrapped production of two films in 2000. The first, &quot;Scenes of the Crime&quot;, premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, and starred Jeff Bridges, Jon Abrahams, and Noah Wyle. It was directed by Dominique Forma. The second film was an independent project titled &quot;Spun&quot;, starring Mena Suvari, Mickey Rourke, Brittany Murphy, and John Leguizamo. It played at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival. Gonzalez&#x27;s also landed the lead in Showtime&#x27;s original series &quot;Resurrection Blvd.&quot;, which premiered June 26, 2000. Gonzalez played Alex Santiago, a pre-med student who dropped out of school to become a professional boxer. The movie was successful and immediately expanded to become a regular weekly series on the network.

While continuing his work on &quot;Resurrection Blvd.&quot;, Gonzalez appeared in episodes of &quot;Walker, Texas Ranger&quot; and &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;. He also appeared in the film &quot;The Princess and the Barrio Boy&quot; (released as &quot;She&#x27;s in Love&quot; in Europe) with his &quot;Resurrection Blvd.&quot; co-star, Marisol Nichols.

Gonzalez continued his career in films with two more titles. The first, &quot;Sea of Dreams&quot;, was filmed in Veracruz, Mexico, in May, 2003. Nick then went to Fiji for the summer, where he completed production of &quot;&quot;, which opened in theaters August 27, 2004. Gonzalez also appeared in &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (2009). In 2011, he played Mateo on the ABC show &quot;Off The Map&quot;.

Gonzalez costarred in the Lifetime series &quot;Witches of East End&quot;. Gonzalez also appeared in recurring roles as Detective Marco Furey in Freeform&#x27;s series &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot;, antagonist Dominick Flores on &quot;How to Get Away with Murder&quot; and the boyfriend of Lisa Vidal&#x27;s character on &quot;Being Mary Jane&quot;. He also guest-starred on &quot;Narcos&quot; as an undercover DEA special agent based in Colombia investigating the Cali Cartel, a role which required him to speak Spanish.

Gonzalez also provided the physical Performance (motion capture) of Nick Mendoza in the video game &quot;&quot;.

In 2017 Gonzalez was cast as a series regular in the role of surgeon Dr. Neil Melendez in the medical drama &quot;The Good Doctor&quot;, his most high-profile role to date. His portrayal of the character was partly based on his father and older brother, both of whom are doctors.

<text>Bennett Lake is a lake in the Province of British Columbia and Yukon Territory in northwestern Canada, at an elevation of . It is just north of the border with the United States state of Alaska, near the Alaskan port of Skagway. The lake has an estimated area of about (sources differ). The average depth is and the maximum depth is .

The narrow-gauge White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad connects the community of Bennett at the south end of the lake with Skagway further south and Whitehorse, Yukon on the north. It runs between Skagway and Fraser, British Columbia during the summer months.

The abandoned town of Bennett, British Columbia, historically usually referred to as Lake Bennett or Bennett Lake and the town of Carcross, Yukon are on the shores of Bennett Lake.

==History==
During the Klondike Gold Rush, Bennett Lake was where the gold-seekers who had crossed the Coast Mountains from Skagway or Dyea, carrying their goods over the Chilkoot Trail or the White Pass, purchased or built rafts to float down the Yukon River to the gold fields at Dawson City, Yukon, Canada. A large tent city sprang up on its shores, numbering in the thousands and offering all the services of a major city.

In late May 1898, the North-West Mounted Police counted 778 boats under construction at Lindeman Lake (located a difficult portage above Bennett Lake), 850 in Bennett and the surrounding area, and another 198 at Caribou Crossing (now Carcross) and Tagish Lake to help transport thousands of goldfield-bound travellers. It was further estimated that another 1,200 boats were built in these areas over the next few weeks.

==Name origin==
Named in 1883 by Frederick Schwatka, US Army officer and explorer, after James Gordon Bennett Jr (1841–1918), editor of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, who was sponsor of Schwatchka&#x27;s search for the remains of the Franklin Expedition, 1878-81.

==Hydrology==
The main outflow of the lake is the Nares River, which flows to Nares Lake. Nares Lake empties into Tagish Lake; then via the Tagish River to Marsh Lake, the source of the Yukon River, which flows to the Bering Sea.

<doc id="912266" wikidata="Q2995379" url="?curid=912266" title="U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission">
<text>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (USCPSC, CPSC, or commission) is an independent agency of the United States government. The CPSC seeks to promote the safety of consumer products by addressing &quot;unreasonable risks&quot; of injury (through coordinating recalls, evaluating products that are the subject of consumer complaints or industry reports, etc.); developing uniform safety standards (some mandatory, some through a voluntary standards process); and conducting research into product-related illness and injury. In part due to its small size, the CPSC attempts to coordinate with outside parties—including companies and consumer advocates—to leverage resources and expertise to achieve outcomes that advance consumer safety. The agency was created by section 4 of the Consumer Product Safety Act in 1972. The agency reports to Congress and the President; it is not part of any other department or agency in the federal government. The CPSC has five commissioners, who are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for staggered seven-year terms. Historically, the commission was often run by three commissioners or fewer. Since 2009, however, the agency has generally been led by five commissioners, one of whom serves as chairman. The commissioners set policy for the CPSC. The CPSC is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Leadership==
The commissioners of the CPSC are appointed by the U.S. president and with the consent of the U.S. Senate. As with some other U.S. federal independent agencies, commissioners are selected as members of political parties. Although the president is entitled by statute to select the chairman (with the consent of the Senate), no more than three commissioners may belong to the same party. Thus, the president is generally expected to consult with members of the opposite party in the Senate to select members of the commission from the opposite party. The commissioners (including the chairman) vote on selecting the vice chairman, who becomes acting chairman if the chairman’s term ends upon resignation or expiration.

=== Chairmen ===

The commission is led by acting Chairman Peter Feldman, a Republican, who assumed office after former chair Alexander Hoehn-Saric resigned in January 2025. Prior to Hoehn-Saric&#x27;s 2021 confirmation, the commission had not had a Senate-confirmed chairman since 2017, when Elliot F. Kaye stepped down as chair following a White House request after Donald Trump’s inauguration. In March 2020, President Trump nominated Nancy Beck, an official at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency who previously worked for an association representing the U.S. chemical industry, to chair the commission, but it was not acted on by the Senate.

===Current commissioners===
The current CPSC members :

==Scope==

The CPSC regulates the manufacture and sale of more than 15,000 different consumer products, from cribs to all-terrain vehicles. Products excluded from the CPSC’s jurisdiction include those specifically named by law as under the jurisdiction of other federal agencies. For example, on-road automobiles are regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, guns are regulated by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, and drugs are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

==Activities==
The CPSC fulfills its mission by banning dangerous consumer products, establishing safety requirements for other consumer products, issuing recalls of products already on the market, and researching potential hazards associated with consumer products.

=== Recalls ===
The aspect of CPSC’s work that most U.S. citizens might recognize is the “recall,” formally a “corrective action” in which a company develops a “a comprehensive plan that reaches throughout the entire distribution chain to consumers who have the product” and addresses a potential or alleged failure of a product. Recalls are nearly always voluntary. While many recalls involve consumers returning consumer products to the manufacturer for a replacement or, more rarely, a refund, recalls have also involved tasks such as instructing users on how to clean an item or publishing a software patch. Most recalls recover very few consumer products, for a variety of hypothesized reasons. Industry and consumer advocates are often at odds over whether recalls need to be more effective, as many consumers may simply discard products that are the subject of recalls. Whether a consumer learns of a recall in the first place is a different question. One commissioner has called for companies to spend as much on recall advertising as the companies do on their advertising of the products before recalls.

=== Rulemaking ===
The CPSC makes rules about consumer products when it identifies a consumer product hazard that is not already addressed by an industry voluntary consensus standard, or when Congress directs it to do so. Its rules can specify basic design requirements, or they can amount to product bans, as in the case of small high-powered magnets, which the CPSC attempted to ban. For certain infant products, the CPSC regulates even when voluntary standards exist. The CPSC is required to follow a rigorous, scientific process to develop mandatory rules. Failing to do so can justify the revocation of a rule, as was the case in a Tenth Circuit decision vacating the CPSC’s ban on small high-powered magnets.

===Information gathering &amp; information sharing===
The CPSC learns about unsafe products in several ways. The agency maintains a consumer hotline through which consumers may report concerns about unsafe products or injuries associated with products. Product safety concerns may also be submitted through SaferProducts.gov. The agency also operates the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), a probability sample of about 100 hospitals with 24-hour emergency rooms. NEISS collects data on consumer product related injuries treated in ERs and can be used to generate national estimates.

The agency also works with and shares information with other governments, both in the U.S. (with states and public health agencies) and with international counterparts.

====Publicity &amp; communication====
The CPSC works on a variety of publicity campaigns to raise awareness of safety.

===== Fireworks =====
Annually, the CPSC blows up mannequins to demonstrate the dangers of improper use of fireworks.

===== Drowning prevention =====
&quot;See also Virginia Graeme Baker Pool and Spa Safety Act&quot;

In connection with the U.S. swimming season (the northern hemisphere’s summer, roughly May to September), the CPSC conducts the “Pool Safely” campaign to prevent drowning through methods such as building fences and supporting education programs. Other efforts include attempts to prevent suction entrapment, which can kill by trapping a swimmer underwater, by eviscerating a swimmer’s internal organs (when a suction tube lacks a cover), or otherwise.

===== Online PSAs =====
On Twitter and Bluesky, the CPSC has made extensive use of PSA images done in a crude surrealist style, usually consisting of various stock images put together. on September 20, 2023, the CPSC released an album containing PSA songs in various styles.

===Enforcement===
Since February 2015, the average civil penalty has been $2.9 million. In April 2018, Polaris Industries agreed to pay a record $27.25 million civil penalty for failing to report defective off-road vehicles.

==Funding and staff==
In 1972 when the agency was created, it had a budget of $34.7 million and 786 staff members. By 2008 it had 401 employees on a budget of $43 million. After the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act was passed in the same year that increased significantly, with at least 500 full-time employees with a budget of $136.4 million in ~2014. Funding dropped to $127 million as of the commission’s fiscal year 2019 appropriation, and it continues to have slightly more than 500 employees.

== Mid-2000s reform following the “Year of the Recall” ==

The year 2007 was called the “Year of the Recall” by some CPSC-watchers in the United States. The CPSC worked with manufacturers and importers on a record 473 voluntary recalls that year, and other U.S. federal agencies promoted other widely noted recalls. CPSC recalls included many incidents with lead in toys and other children’s products.

=== Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 ===
These issues led to the legislative interest in the reform of the agency, and the final result of these efforts was the passage of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act in 2008. The bill increased funding and staffing for the CPSC, placed stricter limits on lead levels in children’s products (redefined from products intended for children age seven and under to children age twelve and under), restricted certain phthalates in children’s toys and child care articles, and required mandatory testing and certification of applicable products. The Danny Keysar Child Product Notification Act required the CPSC to create a public database of recalled products and to provide consumers with a postage-paid postcard for each durable infant or toddler product. This act was named after Danny Keysar, who died in a recalled crib. Danny’s parents, Linda E. Ginzel and Boaz Keysar, founded Kids In Danger and were instrumental in working with the CPSC to strengthen product safety standards.

=== Creation of public database ===
The public database (saferproducts.gov), constructed at a cost of around US$3 million and launched in March 2011, “publicizes complaints from virtually anyone who can provide details about a safety problem connected with any of the 15,000 kinds of consumer goods regulated by the CPSC.” While lauded by consumer advocates for making previously hidden information available, manufacturers have expressed their concern “that most of the complaints are not first vetted by the CPSC before they are made public,” meaning it could be abused and potentially used to target specific brands. As of mid-April 2011, the database was accruing about 30 safety complaints per day. By June 2018, the database had 36,544 reports, with an average of approximately 13.74 reports filed each day.

==Controversies==

=== Recall of inclined infant sleepers in 2019===
In 2019, the CPSC recalled inclined sleepers sold by multiple companies (including Mattel Fisher-Price’s Rock ’n Play as well as Kids II’s and Dorel’s rocking sleepers sold under a variety of brand names). The recalled products were associated with more than 30 infant deaths according to contemporary news reports. The controversy was among those that were tied to Acting Chairman Ann Marie Burekle’s announcement of her intention to step down after waiting for years for the U.S. Senate to act on her nomination to serve an additional term and be formally elevated to full chairmanship.

=== Recall of jogging strollers in 2019 after settlement in 2018 ===
The CPSC sued the maker of Britax jogging strollers, then settled with the company, in 2018. Reports attributed the change to the change in personnel after Republicans gained a majority on the commission, although some commentators noted the unusual circumstances of the commission suing over a product that met existing standards. The 2018 settlement included the company’s agreement to provide a replacement part to consumers. The replacement part—a bolt—itself was later recalled because it broke easily.

=== Attempt to ban small, high-powered magnets in 2012===
In 2012, following reports of consumers (mostly children) ingesting small, high-powered magnets made of rare earth materials such as neodymium, the commission voted to block sales of Maxfield &amp; Oberton’s Buckyballs-branded toys, and later voted to issue a rule that would amount to a ban on all similar toys. Later, however, a federal appellate court overturned the ban, finding that the Commission had moved forward without adequate data. The decision vacating the ban was written by later-Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.

=== Industry-sponsored travel from 2002 to 2007 ===
On November 2, 2007, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that between 2002 and the date of their report, former chairman Hal Stratton and current commissioner and former acting chairman Nancy Nord had taken more than 30 trips paid for by manufacturing groups or lobbyists representing industries that are under the supervision of the agency. According to the &quot;Post&quot;, the groups paid for over $60,000 travel and related expenses during this time.

=== Surviving challenges to the commission’s continued existence in 1981 ===
The CPSC’s creation was not without controversy, and the agency survived attempts to close it in its first decades. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan’s head of the Office of Management &amp; Budget, David Stockman, sought to end the authorization for the agency to move it inside the Department of Commerce. The agency was given a new lease on life following agreement among U.S. senators.

<text>Lake Bennett is a small artificial freshwater lake located 80 km south of Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia within the Coomalie Shire. The lake is set in 4.45 square kilometres of tropical wilderness. It was created in 1980 following the construction of a dam by George and Ken Bennett on a property they had purchased the previous year.

It has been stocked with barramundi since 2004. In recent times some sub-division of the lands around the lake foreshores has occurred with cabins and houses being built around the northern edge, although the permanent population is very small. These dwellings are largely used as &quot;weekenders&quot; or retreats.

==Resort==
Lake Bennett Wilderness resort was developed in the 1990s. The resort offers a variety of accommodation options as well as canoe hire, restaurant and bar. The resort was awarded a Northern Territory Tourism Brolga Award in 2002 in the category &quot;unique accommodation&quot;. In 2011, a development application was approved for a large expansion of the resort, including both tourist and residential accommodation, however these plans did not eventuate. After closing in 2018, the resort was sold to new owners, renovated and rebranded. It reopened in 2021 as the De Lago Resort at Lake Bennett.

<text>Morgan Carl Hamm (born September 24, 1982 in Washburn, Wisconsin) is an American retired artistic gymnast and former member of the United States men&#x27;s national artistic gymnastics team. He is an Olympic silver medalist in the team competition at the 2004 Olympics and a two-time Olympian (2000, 2004). He was a member of the silver-medal winning team at the 2003 World Championships. Hamm was named to the 2008 Olympic team but withdrew from it due to injury.

==Early life==
Hamm was born September 24, 1982, in Washburn, Wisconsin, to Sandy and Cecily Hamm. His twin brother, Paul Hamm, is the 2004 Olympic All-Around Champion. His older sister, Elizabeth (Betsy), is a former member of the USA Gymnastics Senior National Team. He was raised in Waukesha, Wisconsin and attended Waukesha South High School.

==Gymnastics career==
Hamm competed at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney at age 17, and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, alongside his twin brother Paul. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the silver medal with the U.S. team in the team competition. Morgan&#x27;s contribution to this medal-winning performance was vital as he performed on four of the six apparatus and was the highest scorer for the team on the vault and horizontal bar. He also competed in the floor and horizontal bar finals and only a tie-breaker kept him from winning the bronze medal in the latter event. Morgan was also a member of the U.S. team at the 2003 World Championships that won a silver medal in the team competition.

In February 2007, Hamm announced that he would return to competitive gymnastics. He competed at the 2007 Visa National Championships, on floor and pommel horse. He competed at the 2008 National Championships and the 2008 Olympic Trials. He was warned by the United States Anti-Doping Agency in July for testing positive for glucocorticosteroid, which is not performance-enhancing or banned but only allowed if proper paperwork is filed to document that the drug is used for therapeutic reasons. Hamm received the substance through an anti-inflammatory shot to his injured ankle but failed to file the paperwork and his results at the May 24 National Championships were thrown out. Hamm claimed that he had a legitimate medical need for the drug. He was ultimately selected for the 2008 Olympic team. However, Hamm withdrew from the Olympics on August 7, 2008, due to an ankle injury. Alexander Artemev replaced him on the team.

===Airflare===
Morgan Hamm was the first person to officially introduce the B-Boy maneuver Airflare to gymnastics.

==Personal life==
Morgan Hamm also competed alongside his brother, Paul Hamm, in the two 2005 &quot;Sasuke&quot; competitions (#14, #15,). In the 14th competition, he timed out before he attempted the &quot;Rope Climb&quot; in the First Stage. In the 15th competition, he made it to the third stage and ultimately failed on the &quot;Curtain Cling&quot; obstacle. Unlike his brother, he did not compete in the 16th competition.

In 2010, Hamm enrolled at Concordia University Wisconsin to study pharmacology. In 2014, he completed his studies and earned his Doctor of Pharmacy degree. He worked as a pharmacist in Milwaukee.

<text>Schellinkhout (West Frisian: &quot;Skellinkhout&quot;) is a village located in the municipality of Drechterland, North Holland at the border of the IJsselmeer, about 3 km southeast of Hoorn in West-Frisia. It received city rights in 1402, among other (groupings of) villages in the West Frisian countryside, and thus never developed into a real city.

== History ==
The city was first mentioned around 1312 as Scellinchout, and is a combination of &quot;delicious forest&quot; and &quot;border&quot;. Schellinkhout developed in the 12th century as a peat excavation settlement. In 1282, a battle took place between Holland commanded by Floris V, Count of Holland and the army of West Friesland. The former Zuiderzee (nowadays: IJsselmeer) kept taking land and the village moved to the east leaving the church close to the sea. In 1402, it was awarded city rights by Albert I, Count of Holland. This mainly meant that Schellinkhout had its own judicial district. In 1811 the old system was replaced by a new (French-styled) judicial system and Schellinkhout became its own municipality, except for the years 1812 to 1816 when Wijdenes and Oosterleek were merged with Schellinkhout. 

The Dutch Reformed church has 14th century elements. The tower was built in the early 16th century. The &quot;polder&quot; mill De Grote Molen was built between 1603 and 1638. In 1900, a motor was added, and by 1914, the pumping station had made the wind mill obsolete. Between 1979 and 1980, it was restored and is occasionally in service. Unlike most polder mills, it does not pump the water over the dike, but uses a pipe underneath the dike.

Schellinkhout was home to 497 people in 1840. It was a separate municipality until 1970, when it was merged with Venhuizen. In 2006, it became part of the municipality of Drechterland.

The meandering main road (Dorpsweg) counts 33 corners

<doc id="912284" wikidata="Q2687368" url="?curid=912284" title="Battle of Missionary Ridge">
<text>The Battle of Missionary Ridge, also known as the Battle of Chattanooga, was fought on November 25, 1863, as part of the Chattanooga campaign of the American Civil War. Following the Union victory in the Battle of Lookout Mountain on November 24, Union forces in the Military Division of the Mississippi under Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assaulted Missionary Ridge and defeated the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by Gen. Braxton Bragg, forcing it to retreat to Georgia.

In the morning, Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, commanding the Union Army of the Tennessee, made piecemeal attacks to capture the northern end of Missionary Ridge, Tunnel Hill, but were stopped by fierce resistance from the Confederate divisions of Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne, William H.T. Walker, and Carter L. Stevenson. In the afternoon, Grant was concerned that Bragg was reinforcing his right flank at Sherman&#x27;s expense. He ordered the Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas, to move forward and seize the Confederate line of rifle pits on the valley floor and stop there, as a demonstration to assist Sherman&#x27;s efforts. The Union soldiers moved forward and quickly pushed the Confederates from the first line of rifle pits, but were then subjected to a punishing fire from the Confederate lines up the ridge.

After a short pause to regain their breath, the Union soldiers continued the attack against the remaining lines further up the ridge, found that the defenders&#x27; remaining rifle pits were untenable and pursued the fleeing Confederates. This second advance was taken up by the commanders on the spot and also by some of the soldiers. Seeing what was happening, Thomas and his subordinates sent orders confirming orders for the ascent. The Union advance was somewhat disorganized but effective, finally overwhelming and scattering what ought to have been, as General Grant himself believed, an impregnable Confederate line. The top line of Confederate rifle pits was sited on the actual crest rather than the military crest of the ridge, leaving blind spots for infantry and artillery. In combination with an advance from the southern end of the ridge by divisions under Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, the Union Army routed Bragg&#x27;s army, which retreated to Dalton, Georgia, ending the siege of Union forces in Chattanooga, Tennessee.

==Background==
=== Military situation ===
After their disastrous defeat at the Battle of Chickamauga, the 40,000 men of the Union Army of the Cumberland under Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans retreated to Chattanooga. Confederate General Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee besieged the city, threatening to starve the Union forces into surrender. Bragg&#x27;s troops established themselves on Missionary Ridge and Lookout Mountain, both of which had excellent views of the city, the Tennessee River flowing north of the city, and the Union supply lines.

Heavy rains began to fall in late September, washing away long stretches of the mountain roads. On October 1, Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler&#x27;s Confederate cavalry intercepted and severely damaged a train of 800 wagons—burning hundreds of the wagons, and shooting or sabering hundreds of mules—at the start of his October 1863 raid through Tennessee to sever Rosecrans&#x27;s supply line. Toward the end of October, typical Federal soldiers&#x27; rations were &quot;four cakes of hard bread and a quarter pound of pork&quot; every three days.

The Union Army sent reinforcements: Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker with 15,000 men in two corps from the Army of the Potomac in Virginia and Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman with 20,000 men from Vicksburg, Mississippi. On October 17, Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant received command of three Western armies, designated the Military Division of the Mississippi; he moved to reinforce Chattanooga and replaced Rosecrans with Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas.

Thomas launched a surprise amphibious landing at Brown&#x27;s Ferry on October 27 that opened the Tennessee River by linking up his Army of the Cumberland with Hooker&#x27;s relief column southwest of the city, thus allowing supplies and reinforcements to flow into Chattanooga over what was called the &quot;Cracker Line&quot;. In response, Bragg ordered Lt. Gen. James Longstreet to force the Federals out of Lookout Valley. The ensuing Battle of Wauhatchie (October 28–29) was one of the war&#x27;s few battles fought exclusively at night.

Sherman arrived with his 20,000 men of the Army of the Tennessee in mid-November. Grant, Sherman, and Thomas planned a flanking attack on Bragg&#x27;s force, with an assault by Sherman against the northern end of Missionary Ridge, supplemented by two of Thomas&#x27; divisions from the center. Hooker, instead of attempting to capture Lookout Mountain and then move across the Chattanooga Valley to the break in the ridge at Rossville, Georgia, was to do nothing besides forwarding troops toward the center.

Running behind schedule, Sherman&#x27;s force was ready to cross the Tennessee River early on November 24. The day before, Grant ordered Thomas to advance halfway to Missionary Ridge on a reconnaissance in force to determine the strength of the Confederate line, hoping to ensure that Bragg would not withdraw his forces and move in the direction of Knoxville, Tennessee, where Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside was being threatened by a Confederate force under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. Thomas sent over 14,000 men toward a minor hill named Orchard Knob, and overran the Confederate defenders. Grant changed his orders and instructed Thomas&#x27;s men to dig in and hold the position.

Surprised by Thomas&#x27;s move and realizing that his center and right might be more vulnerable than he had thought, Bragg quickly readjusted his strategy. Bragg assigned Col. Warren Grigsby&#x27;s brigade of Kentucky cavalry to picket the Tennessee River northeast of Chattanooga and ordered Brig. Gen. Marcus Joseph Wright to bring his brigade of Tennessee infantry from Cleveland, Tennessee, by train to Chickamauga Station. He recalled all units he had recently ordered to Knoxville if they were within a day&#x27;s march. Maj. Gen. Patrick Cleburne&#x27;s division returned after dark from Chickamauga Station, interrupting the process of boarding the trains. Bragg began to reduce the strength on his left by withdrawing Maj. Gen. William H. T. Walker&#x27;s division from the base of Lookout Mountain and placing them on the far right of Missionary Ridge, just south of Tunnel Hill. He assigned Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee to command his now critical right flank, turning over the left flank to Maj. Gen. Carter L. Stevenson. Bragg&#x27;s concern for his right proved justified and his decisions were fortuitous. In the center, Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge ordered his men to begin fortifying the crest of Missionary Ridge, a task that Bragg had somehow neglected for weeks. Unable to decide whether to defend the base or the crest of the ridge, the divisions of Brig. Gens. William B. Bate and J. Patton Anderson were ordered to move half of their divisions to the crest, leaving the remainder in the rifle pits along the base. James L. McDonough wrote of the upper entrenchments, &quot;Placed along the physical crest rather than what is termed the military crest ... these works severely handicapped the defenders.&quot;
November 24 was dark, with low clouds, fog, and drizzling rain. Sherman&#x27;s force crossed the Tennessee River successfully in the morning, then took the set of hills at the north end of Missionary Ridge, although he was surprised to find that a valley separated him from the main part of the ridge. Alerted by Grigsby&#x27;s cavalry that the enemy had crossed the river in force, Bragg sent Cleburne&#x27;s division and Wright&#x27;s brigade to challenge Sherman. After skirmishing with the Confederates, Sherman ordered his men to dig in on the hills he had seized. Cleburne, likewise, dug in around Tunnel Hill.

At the same time, Hooker&#x27;s command succeeded in the Battle of Lookout Mountain and prepared to move east toward Bragg&#x27;s left flank on Missionary Ridge. The divisions of Stevenson and Cheatham retreated behind Chattanooga Creek, burning the bridges behind them.

On the night of November 24, Bragg asked his two corps commanders whether to retreat or to stand and fight. Cleburne, concerned about what Sherman had accomplished, expected Bragg to retreat. Hardee also counseled retreat, but Breckinridge convinced Bragg to fight it out on the strong position of Missionary Ridge. Accordingly, the troops withdrawn from Lookout Mountain were ordered to the right wing to assist in repelling Sherman.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===


Grant&#x27;s Military Division of the Mississippi assembled the following forces at Chattanooga:
* The Army of the Tennessee, commanded by Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman, consisting of the XV Corps under Maj. Gen. Francis Preston Blair Jr., and the 2nd Division of the XVII Corps under Brig. Gen. John E. Smith.
* The Army of the Cumberland, commanded by Maj. Gen. George Henry Thomas, consisting of the IV Corps under Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger, and the XIV Corps under Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer.
* The command of Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker, which had become part of the Army of the Cumberland by this point, consisting of the XI Corps under Maj. Gen. Oliver Otis Howard and the 2nd Division of the XII Corps under Brig. Gen. John W. Geary. (Starting with the Battle of Lookout Mountain, Hooker effectually commanded Geary&#x27;s division of the XII Corps and a division each detached from the IV and XV Corps.)

===Confederate===


Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee had the following forces available in Chattanooga:
* Hardee&#x27;s Corps, under Lt. Gen. William J. Hardee, consisting of the divisions under Brig. Gen. John K. Jackson (Cheatham&#x27;s Division), Brig. Gen. James Patton Anderson (Hindman&#x27;s Division), Brig. Gen. States Rights Gist (Walker&#x27;s Division), and Maj. Gen. Simon Bolivar Buckner (detached November 22 to Knoxville).
* Breckinridge&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge, consisting of the divisions of Maj. Gens. Patrick Cleburne, Alexander P. Stewart, Carter L. Stevenson, and Brig. Gen. William B. Bate (Breckinridge&#x27;s Division). During the battle, Cleburne&#x27;s division operated under Hardee&#x27;s control.

On November 5, Bragg had seriously weakened his forces by sending Longstreet&#x27;s Corps, commanded by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, with the divisions of Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws and Brig. Gen. Micah Jenkins (Hood&#x27;s Division), against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside near Knoxville. On November 22, Bragg had further weakened his forces by ordering Buckner&#x27;s division to reinforce Longstreet at Knoxville.

==Battle==

On November 25, Grant&#x27;s plan concentrated on the attack by Sherman against Bragg&#x27;s right flank at Tunnel Hill. He gave a supporting role to Thomas:

Grant had no particular expectation for Hooker other than to divert Bragg&#x27;s attention by continued demonstrations on Lookout Mountain, which had been evacuated by the Confederates. However, Thomas wanted support on his flank and called Hooker to cross the valley and demonstrate against Bragg&#x27;s left flank directly at the Rossville Gap.

===Sherman at Tunnel Hill===
In a letter to his brother, Sherman wrote:

Sherman had about 16,600 men in the three divisions of Brig. Gens. Morgan Lewis Smith, John E. Smith, and his foster brother and brother-in-law Hugh Boyle Ewing, and three regiments of Col. Adolphus Buschbeck&#x27;s brigade from the XI Corps. Sherman also had Jefferson C. Davis&#x27;s division guarding his rear. Around ten o&#x27;clock that morning, Grant dispatched the rest of Howard&#x27;s XI corps from Thomas to Sherman. Hardee had about 9,000 Confederates in the divisions of Cleburne and Walker with another 4,000 soon to arrive in Stevenson&#x27;s division. On Hardee&#x27;s left, Benjamin F. Cheatham&#x27;s decimated division occupied the ridge between Thomas&#x27; and Sherman&#x27;s fronts. However, at dawn, when Sherman was supposed to attack, he was opposed by just three small brigades under Cleburne—about 4,000 men—and only the Texas brigade of Brig. Gen. James A. Smith was actually positioned on Tunnel Hill. But seemingly unnerved by his incorrect positioning, Sherman delayed until about 9:00 o&#x27;clock. He selected just two brigades from Ewing&#x27;s division to attack. Brig. Gen. John M. Corse would approach from the north, Col. John M. Loomis from the northwest, across the open fields between the railroads.

Sherman ordered Corse&#x27;s brigade, with a detachment from Joseph A.J. Lightburn&#x27;s brigade, to attack along the narrow length of Tunnel Hill. Col. John M. Loomis&#x27;s brigade, supported by Buschbeck, would move across the open fields on the west of the ridge while Brig. Gen. Giles Alexander Smith&#x27;s brigade would move through the valley on the east side of the ridge. The brigades of Brig. Gen. Charles L. Matthies and Col. Green Berry Raum were held in reserve to follow up any successful attack; the brigades of Cols. Joseph R. Cockerill and Jesse I. Alexander would hold the heights seized the day before.

Corse drove off the Confederate skirmish line and seized some half-built defensive works at the north end of Tunnel Hill. Continuing over the crest of the hill, Corse charged Cleburne&#x27;s main position but was repulsed. After several attempts, Sherman gave up on attacking from Corse&#x27;s position and the fighting shifted to the west side of the ridge. Loomis had advanced to the railroad in front of the ridge where he skirmished with Walker&#x27;s division. Buschbeck, followed by Matthies and then Raum were sent up the west slope of Tunnel Hill between Loomis and Corse. Cleburne&#x27;s salient began to feel the pressure and it came close to breaking. Hardee fed in reinforcements from Stevenson&#x27;s division, and Cleburne ordered a general counterattack. Charging down the hill at 4 p.m., the Confederates routed Sherman&#x27;s men, who were too tired and low on ammunition to resist, and captured numerous Federal prisoners.

Sherman&#x27;s attack came to a halt, a tactical failure in which he lost almost 2,000 casualties but committed only a fraction of his available force in a direct assault on a strong position, rather than attempting to outflank Bragg. Military historian David Eicher called this Sherman&#x27;s &quot;worst experience as a commander, first miscalculating the terrain and then stumbling through a prolonged, unsuccessful, and needless attack.&quot; On the other hand, Steven E. Woodworth judged that &quot;Cleburne was in fine form today, deftly shifting troops around his hilltop position and skillfully judging when and where to launch limited counterattacks—often leading them himself.&quot;

An alternative view has been expressed by B. H. Liddell Hart, who contends that Sherman did not commit his entire force because he was expecting Bragg to attack him to dislodge the Union force from a threatening position. He &quot;gave the Confederates several hours in which to attack them and when he saw that they showed no signs of accepting the invitation, he made it more pressing by launching three brigades against their position. But his real desire is unmistakably established by the fact that he kept three brigades to hold his own ridge, with five more in reserve behind.&quot;

===Thomas&#x27;s assault on the Confederate center===

At around 2:30 pm, Grant spoke with Brig. Gen. Thomas J. Wood, his classmate from West Point. &quot;General Sherman seems to be having a hard time,&quot; Grant observed. &quot;It seems as if we ought to go help him.&quot; He decided to send Wood&#x27;s and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s divisions against the Confederate rifle pits at the base of the ridge, hoping to concern Bragg and relieve the pressure on Sherman. Grant suggested his idea to Thomas, but personal relations between the two generals were chilly during the campaign and Thomas rebuffed Grant&#x27;s idea—he had no intention of attacking until he was assured that Hooker was successfully attacking the enemy&#x27;s flank. Meanwhile, IV Corps commander Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger was nearby, completely absorbed in the activities of a battery of artillery.

Irritated, Grant asked Thomas to order Granger to &quot;take command of his own corps. And now order your troops to advance and take the enemy&#x27;s first line of rifle pits.&quot; At 3:00 pm, Thomas passed the order to Granger, but incredibly, Granger ignored the order and resumed commanding the battery of artillery. After a further scolding from Grant, Granger finally issued orders to Wood and Sheridan. Messengers also went to Brig. Gens. Absalom Baird and Richard W. Johnson of Maj. Gen. John M. Palmer&#x27;s XIV Corps, ordering them to move upon hearing the rapid, successive discharge of six artillery pieces.

Thomas deployed 23,000 men in four divisions with brigades in line—from left to right (north to south), the divisions of Baird (brigades of Col. Edward H. Phelps, Col. Ferdinand Van Derveer, and Brig. Gen. John B. Turchin), Wood (brigades of Brig. Gens. Samuel Beatty, August Willich, and William Babcock Hazen), Sheridan (brigades of Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner, Col. Charles Garrison Harker, and Col. Francis Trowbridge Sherman), and Johnson (brigades of Col. William L. Stoughton and Brig. Gen. William Carlin). Each brigade consisted of two lines, one behind the other, with skirmishers leading the way.
About 20,000 Confederates were defending the center of the ridge against which Thomas&#x27;s men marched, overlapping the Union approach on both ends. From right to left (north to south) were Cheatham&#x27;s division (brigades of Brig. Gens. Edward C. Walthall, John C. Moore, and John K. Jackson), Hindman&#x27;s division (commanded by Brig. Gen. J. Patton Anderson, brigades of Brig. Gens. Alfred J. Vaughan, Zachariah C. Deas, and Arthur M. Manigault), Breckinridge&#x27;s division (commanded by Brig. Gen. William B. Bate, brigades of Brig. Gen. Joseph H. Lewis, Col. R. C. Tyler, and Brig. Gen. Jesse J. Finley), and Stewart&#x27;s division (brigades of Col. Randall L. Gibson, Brig. Gen. Otho F. Strahl, Brig. Gen. Marcellus Augustus Stovall, and Col. James T. Holtzclaw).

Around 3:40 pm, the signal guns fired before Baird could brief Turchin. Some regimental officers claimed to get conflicting orders from the same brigadier. When asked where he was to stop, Willich told one officer, &quot;I don&#x27;t know. At Hell, I expect.&quot; Sheridan sent an orderly back to Granger inquiring whether the objective was the base or the top of the ridge, but the signal guns fired before he got an answer. Wagner, Turchin, and Carlin thought they were supposed to carry the ridge top. Most officers were guided only by what the units on either side of them did.
The 9,000 Confederates holding the rifle pits at the base of the ridge were also plagued by conflicting orders. Some were ordered to fire a volley then retreat, others to hold their ground. Those who stayed to fight were swamped by the superior Union numbers. The Union tide was irresistible, with charging men shouting, &quot;Chickamauga! Chickamauga!&quot; Many of the Confederates were captured, while the rest started the 300– to 400-ft climb to the ridge top in fear of being shot in the back. Those who escaped were completely winded by the effort and in no shape to defend themselves for several minutes.

The 100 Confederate cannons lining the top of the ridge initially hit few of their enemies during the Union rush, but once the Union soldiers stopped at the rifle pits, they began to zero in on them. The Confederate riflemen also poured in their fire causing several Union casualties. After several minutes, some Union unit commanders moved their men forward to get out of the worst fire. Willich&#x27;s skirmishers started advancing up the ridge without orders. Deciding that following them was preferable to being massacred in the rifle pits, Willich gave orders to advance, although several of his units were already doing so. Seeing this, Hazen and Beatty also ordered their first lines up. When Wood reached the rifle pits, the men in the second line begged him to order them up, as well. Wood sent them forward.

Grant was shocked when he saw the Union troops climbing the ridge. He asked first Thomas then Granger who had given the orders. Neither general claimed responsibility, but Granger replied, &quot;When those fellows get started, all hell can&#x27;t stop them.&quot; Granger then sent a courier to Wood allowing him permission to take the ridge top, if he thought it possible. Several messengers went out at about this time with differing orders, leading to more confusion.

On the far left, Phelps and Van Derveer captured the rifle pits and held their position. Having negotiated some rough ground, Turchin&#x27;s brigade lagged behind, but as soon as his men overran the rifle pits, the &quot;Mad Russian&quot; immediately urged his men up the ridge. Before Baird could send his other two brigades, he received an order to halt.

Wagner and Harker&#x27;s men started climbing soon after Wood&#x27;s brigades. Wagner got halfway up before he received an order that he was to stop at the base of the ridge. He ordered his men to pull back. As they did, they suffered heavy losses from the elated Confederate defenders. Wagner&#x27;s brigade suffered more casualties, around 22%, than any other brigade in the assault. When Wagner and some of Harker&#x27;s men returned to the rifle pits, they saw that Wood&#x27;s division on their left and units of their own division on the right were still moving uphill. Disgusted that a rival division was getting ahead, Wagner sent his second line up the ridge. Sheridan soon ordered Harker back up, also. To their right, Francis Sherman&#x27;s brigade faced an entrenched line about half of the way up the ridge, and had hard going. On the far right, Johnson&#x27;s two brigades faced determined resistance at the rifle pits, and were slow in starting up the ridge.

The Confederate line first cracked at Bird&#x27;s Mill Road, at about 5 pm. One of Willich&#x27;s regiments, joined by two of Hazen&#x27;s, worked its way within 50 yards of the Confederate breastworks. Protected by a roll of ground, they crept closer, then with a rush they leapt over the works belonging to Col. William F. Tucker&#x27;s brigade. Surprised, the nearest defenders surrendered or fled for their lives. Alertly, the Union field officers swung their regiments to the right and left and began rolling up the Confederate line. Tucker bravely rallied his men, but by this time, Willich and Hazen&#x27;s men were flooding over the breastworks.

Since Bragg had not provided for a tactical reserve and the narrow ridgetop left no place for one, his defenses were only a thin crust. To seal off the breach, the Southern generals were placed on the horns of a dilemma. When they found Union troops on their flank, they had to pull regiments out of their defense line for a counterattack. This weakened the main line of resistance just as the Union brigades to their front were swarming up to the crest.

Once atop the ridge, Hazen swung his brigade south. The Confederate lines in this direction were held by Brig. Gen. Alexander W. Reynolds&#x27;s brigade, whose men had to endure a hard climb from the base of the ridge. Hit in front and flank, most of Reynolds&#x27;s tired men melted away. Continuing south, Hazen flanked Col. R. C. Tyler&#x27;s brigade of Bate&#x27;s division out of position, allowing Wagner&#x27;s brigade to reach the crest. Bate&#x27;s Florida Brigade was soon driven away, allowing Harker&#x27;s men to reach the top. According to the diary from a man in the 7th Florida Infantry Regiment, Company K, the Union troops were able to move artillery pieces into place by disguising the guns as ambulances. The Rebels held their fire, falling for the ruse, until the guns were uncovered and opened fire. Col. Randall L. Gibson&#x27;s brigade was defeated by Francis Sherman&#x27;s men. Dogged by tough resistance and very steep slopes, Johnson&#x27;s two brigades took the longest to climb the ridge, Carlin&#x27;s men finally reaching the top around 5:30 pm. Seeing that his position was hopeless, Stewart pulled the brigades of Brig. Gens. Otho F. Strahl and Marcellus A. Stovall off the ridge.

Meanwhile, Willich wheeled to the north and began crushing the flank of Anderson&#x27;s division. Willich&#x27;s success assisted Beatty&#x27;s brigade to get to the top. The two brigades first drove off Brig. Gen. Arthur M. Manigault&#x27;s men and continued rolling north. As they came up the ridge, the Union brigades of Turchin, Van Derveer, and Phelps (who was killed near the crest) added their weight to the assault against the Confederate brigades of Brig. Gens. Zachariah C. Deas, Alfred J. Vaughan, and John K. Jackson. Some Confederate soldiers resisted stubbornly, but many panicked and ran when they realized that Union troops were bearing down on them from the flank. Often, the Southern infantry fled before the supporting artillerists could escape with their cannons. In this manner, Anderson&#x27;s entire division and Cheatham&#x27;s left flank brigades of Brig. Gens. Jackson and Moore were routed. The northward Federal advance was only stopped by the stout fighting of Walthall&#x27;s brigade and nightfall. Cheatham, Gist, Stevenson, and Cleburne were able to get their divisions away more or less intact, although the Confederate soldiers were demoralized and chagrined by their defeat.

The Army of the Cumberland&#x27;s ascent of Missionary Ridge was one of the war&#x27;s most dramatic events. Military historians Herman Hattaway and Archer Jones contend that the Battle of Missionary Ridge was &quot;the war&#x27;s most notable example of a frontal assault succeeding against entrenched defenders holding high ground.&quot; A Union officer remembered that

The final flag bearer referenced in the passage above was actually Arthur MacArthur Jr, father of Douglas Macarthur, his actions to pick up the flag and advance earned him a Medal of Honor. By 6:00 pm, the center of Bragg&#x27;s line had broken completely and fled in panic, requiring the abandonment of Missionary Ridge and a headlong retreat eastward to South Chickamauga Creek. The sole exception to the panicked flight was Cleburne&#x27;s command, his division augmented by two brigades from another division. As the only command not in complete disarray, it was the last unit to withdraw and formed the rear guard of Bragg&#x27;s army as it retreated eastward. Only Sheridan tried to pursue beyond Missionary Ridge, but he finally gave up late that night when he clearly was being supported by neither Granger nor Thomas.

===Hooker at Rossville Gap===
After Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker&#x27;s command left Lookout Mountain around 10:00 am and moved east, they encountered a significant obstacle. The bridges across Chattanooga Creek, about a mile from Rossville Gap, had been burned by the Confederates as they withdrew the night before, and the creek was running high. Brig. Gen. Peter Joseph Osterhaus assigned a 70-man pioneer unit to start rebuilding one bridge, while men of the 27th Missouri created a rickety footbridge and began crossing one by one. Hooker decided to leave his guns and wagons behind so that all of his infantry could cross first, but his advance was delayed about three hours and the bulk of his force did not reach Rossville Gap until 3:30 pm.

Breckinridge was absent while the Union attack wrecked his corps. Worried about his left flank, he rode to the end of his line in the early afternoon. At 3:30 pm, about the time Thomas launched his four-division attack on Missionary Ridge, Breckinridge visited Stewart&#x27;s left flank brigade of Col. James T. Holtzclaw, whose commander pointed to the southwest, where Hooker&#x27;s men were busily bridging Chattanooga Creek. Concerned about Rossville Gap, which lay undefended beyond his left flank, Breckinridge ordered Holtzclaw to send a couple of regiments to hold the position. It was too late; by the time the Southerners reached the gap, Osterhaus&#x27;s division had already marched through. Lt. J. Cabell Breckinridge, the general&#x27;s son and &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, rode into a group from the 9th Iowa and was captured.

Hooker quickly faced his troops to the north and organized a three-pronged attack. He sent Osterhaus along a trail east of Missionary Ridge, Cruft onto the ridge itself, and Geary along the western face of the ridge. Holtzclaw faced his men south and put up a fight, but Cruft and Osterhaus soon began herding the outnumbered Confederates north along Missionary Ridge. Hearing a tremendous racket to the north, Breckinridge finally rode off to find out what was wrong. As Holtzclaw retreated before Hooker&#x27;s command, he eventually bumped into Col. Anson G. McCook&#x27;s 2nd Ohio of Carlin&#x27;s brigade, now astride the ridge. Surrounded by superior forces on four sides, about 700 of Holtzclaw&#x27;s men surrendered, along with soldiers from the other brigades of Stewart&#x27;s division.

==Aftermath==
During the night, Bragg ordered his army to withdraw toward Chickamauga Station on the Western and Atlantic Railroad (currently the site of Lovell Air Field) and the following day began retreating from there toward Dalton, Georgia, in two columns over two routes. The pursuit ordered by Grant was effectively thwarted by Cleburne&#x27;s rearguard defense at the Battle of Ringgold Gap.

Casualties for the Union Army during the Battles for Chattanooga (Orchard Knob, Lookout Mountain, and Missionary Ridge) amounted to 5,824 (753 killed, 4,722 wounded, and 349 missing) of about 56,000 engaged; Confederate casualties were 6,667 (361 killed, 2,160 wounded, and 4,146 missing, mostly prisoners) of about 44,000. Southern losses may have been higher; Grant claimed 6,142 prisoners. In addition, the Union Army seized 40 cannons and 69 limbers and caissons. When a chaplain asked General Thomas whether the dead should be sorted and buried by state, in the new military cemetery, Thomas replied &quot;Mix &#x27;em up. I&#x27;m tired of states&#x27; rights.&quot;

The Confederate enthusiasm that had risen so high after Chickamauga had been dashed at Chattanooga. One of the Confederacy&#x27;s two major armies was routed. The Union now held undisputed control of the state of Tennessee, including Chattanooga, the &quot;Gateway to the Lower South.&quot; The city became the supply and logistics base for Sherman&#x27;s 1864 Atlanta Campaign, as well as for the Army of the Cumberland, and Grant had won his final battle in the West prior to receiving command of all Union armies in March 1864.

<doc id="912291" wikidata="Q1420449" url="?curid=912291" title="Honda Valkyrie">
<text>The Honda Valkyrie is a motorcycle that was manufactured by Honda from 1997 to 2003. It was designated GL1500C in the US market and F6C (&quot;Flat Six Custom&quot;) in other markets.

Back in the 90&#x27;s there was a resurgence of interest in cruiser motorcycles, that generally feature a V-twin engine. The idea of an American cruiser styled motorcycle featuring a flat six engine came from Josef Boyd.

The Valkyrie engine is a liquid-cooled, horizontally opposed flat-six engine shared with Honda&#x27;s Gold Wing 4th generation model, unlike the V-twin engine commonly found on &quot;cruiser&quot; style motorcycles. In its transplant from the Goldwing, the most notable engine changes were the camshaft and the change to six individual 28 mm carburetors, one for each cylinder, changes which increased power and torque.

The Valkyrie was offered with a reverse gear in Japan. The Valkyrie was made in the United States at the Honda motorcycle plant in Marysville, Ohio.

==Other models==
===Standard, Tourer and Interstate===



On introduction in 1997, a naked Standard and later, a Tourer model were offered. The Tourer included a windshield and lockable hard saddlebags. It was designated as a GL1500CT

In 1999, the Interstate model was added to the lineup, which included a fork-mounted fairing along with a larger capacity fuel tank with 26 Liters (6.9 US gallons) and a trunk at the rear of the motorcycle.

It also featured a stiffer frame, better shocks, AM/FM radio, radiator pods for better wind management and wired intercom. Honda offered optional CB radio and fog lights mounted inside of the radiator pods. It was designated as a GL1500CF.

As sales eventually dwindled, the Interstate and Tourer models were dropped after 2001, leaving only the Standard model remaining. 2003 saw the Standard offered only in black and was the last year of the original Valkyrie.

===Rune===


Honda introduced a limited edition model in 2003 named the Valkyrie Rune with a engine, sourced from the Honda Goldwing 5th Generation. It was a major departure from the original Valkyrie in styling and purpose.

The objective of the Rune was to be a tour de force, showing what Honda as a manufacturer could develop. To quote the project leader, Masanari Aoki, &quot;No performance goals, no distinct function, purchase price not a consideration.&quot;.

Its debut price in 2004 was US$27,000, but they actually cost over US$100,000 each to be manufactured. That is mostly because besides the engine, all remaining parts were custom made by Honda exclusively for the Rune.

The production numbers are not confirmed, allegedly Honda made around 3,000 units and assigned one to each licensed dealership in the North America. To quote a Canadian Honda representative in 2004: &quot;There will definitely be less than one per dealer.&quot;.

Apparently the original idea was to collect consumer&#x27;s feedback on the limited production Rune in preparation for an upcoming commercially viable model to be released in the coming year.

This model was produced at the Honda motorcycle plant in Marysville, Ohio.

===EVO6 concept===

Honda presented the EVO6 concept motorcycle at the Tokyo Motor Show 2007. Based on the flat-six engine from the Goldwing, the EVO6 produces more power than its touring ancestor. The EVO6 features Honda&#x27;s Human Friendly Transmission (HFT) that can be operated in a fully automatic mode or a six-speed manual mode.

===Reintroduction===
The Valkyrie was reintroduced in November 2013 (as a 2014 model) as a redesign of the GL1800 Gold Wing.

The reintroduced Valkyrie (NRX1800) shared the same liquid cooled 1832cc flat six engine (117 bhp at 5,500 rpm/123 lb.-ft. torque at 4,000 rpm) as well as underlying frame and 5-speed transmission as the Honda Goldwing. However the Valkyrie loses the fairing, windshield and bags (windshield and bags are available Honda optional accessories). ABS is also available (not standard). The Valkyrie has an all digital multi-instrument dash screen.

At the Tokyo Motor Show, Honda revealed their new &#x27;naked&#x27; version of the GL1800, as the 2014 Valkyrie, using the same 1832cc six-cylinder engine as the Gold Wing but weighing less. The new Valkyrie has increased rake and trail, front and rear suspension revised for the reduced weight, 50/50 weight distribution and large tires after the fashion of sport-bikes. The Valkyrie&#x27;s horsepower-to-weight ratio puts it in the muscle bike class according to some reviewers. It was expected to be on sale in early 2014, priced at about $17,000 for the base model (the model with an anti-lock braking system will cost more). The reintroduced Valkyrie was only available for two model years (2014 and 2015) before Honda dropped the bike in the US market.

<text>PMR446 (Private Mobile Radio, 446 MHz) is a licence-exempt service or UHF CB in the UHF radio frequency band, as personal radio service or citizens band radio, and is available for business and personal use in most countries throughout the European Union, Malaysia, Singapore, Norway, and the United Arab Emirates.

PMR446 is typically used for small-site, same-building and line of sight outdoor activities. Equipment used ranges from consumer-grade to professional quality walkie-talkies (similar to those used for FRS/GMRS in the United States and Canada). Depending on surrounding terrain range can vary from a few hundred metres (in a city) to a few kilometres (flat countryside) to many kilometres from high ground.

Historically, analogue FM is used but a digital voice mode has been available in radios conforming to digital private mobile radio (dPMR446) and digital mobile radio (DMR Tier 1) standards designed by ETSI.

Originally 8 channels were available in analogue mode but this has now been increased to 16 channels.
Typically PMR446 is used for both recreational and business use, additionally it has been utilized by amateur-radio operators and radio enthusiasts as a license-free experimental band.

==History==
The first steps towards creating licence-free short range radio communications were taken in April 1997 when the European Radio Communications Committee decided on a 446 MHz frequency band to be used for the new radios. In November 1998, ERC Decision (98)25 allocated frequency band 446.0–446.1 MHz for analogue PMR446; another two decisions established licence exemption for PMR446 equipment and free circulation of the PMR446 equipment. The first country which introduced these frequencies for licence-free use was Ireland on 1 April 1998. The United Kingdom introduced PMR446 service in April 1999; since 2003, it has replaced the former short-range business radio (SRBR) service.

In October 2005, ECC Decision (05)02 added unlicensed band 446.1–446.2 MHz for use by digital DMR/dPMR equipment.

In July 2015, ECC Decision (15)05 doubled the number of analog channels to 16 by extending analog operation onto the 446.1–446.2 MHz band previously used by digital DMR/dPMR equipment, effective January 2016; from January 2018, the number of digital channels was doubled by extending onto the 446.0–446.1 MHz band used by analog FM.

==Range==
Until recently, PMR446 radios were handheld transceivers with fixed antennas (see Technical information). In November 2015, Midland Radio announced the release of the GB1 mobile PMR446 radio for vehicular use.

The range of PMR446, just like any VHF or UHF radio, is dependent on many factors like environment (in-city range is far less than in an open field), height above surrounding obstructions, and, to a lesser extent, weather conditions. The antenna type and location, transmit power and receive sensitivity also affect range. However, with PMR446 most of these variables are fixed at manufacturing to comply with the PMR446 specifications. Most of the time the maximum range that a user in a city can expect is a few hundred metres or less.

Range may be many kilometres, for example between hilltops, or only a few hundred metres, if for example a hill or large metal object is in the transmission path between radios. The best known long-distance record is 333 mi (536 km) from Blyth in the United Kingdom to Almere, Netherlands. This was the result of enhanced propagation conditions, not a line-of-sight signal.

==Use worldwide==
PMR446-compliant equipment may be used anywhere throughout Europe, Malaysia, and Singapore.

Type approved PMR446 radios with power up to 500 mW can be used without any licence in India and Vietnam. The devices may not be base stations or repeaters, and must use integrated antennas only.

PMR446 radios use frequencies that in Australia, the U.S., and Canada are allocated to amateur radio operators, and military radar systems.

Instead, the U.S., Canada and Mexico use the Family Radio Service (FRS) system, which provides a similar service on different frequencies, around 462 and 467 MHz. These frequencies are allocated to the emergency services in Europe, notably the fire brigade in the UK, police in Russia and commercial users in Australia. Interference with licensed radio services may result in prosecution.

Australia, New Zealand, Vanuatu use the UHF Citizen&#x27;s Band system in the 476–477 MHz range and a maximum power output of 5 W giving improved range over the lower power PMR system.

==Technical information==
PMR446 covers band 446.0–446.2 MHz. The general ECC decision however still requires integral antennas and the actual implementation varies between different countries.

=== Analogue FM and digital TDMA===
Analogue PMR446 uses 16 FM channels separated by 12.5 kHz from each other. Maximum power is 500 mW ERP and equipment must be used on a mobile basis. CTCSS is usually used, with more upmarket models also featuring DCS and/or fixed-carrier voice inversion. Before January 2016, only the lower 8 channels were allowed for analog FM operation.

For those older PMR446 radios with 38 codes, the codes 0 to 38 are CTCSS Tones:

For those newer PMR446 radios with 121 codes, codes 0 to 38 are as above while codes 39 to 121 are DCS codes:
Digital PMR446 DMR Tier I (TDMA) uses 16 digital voice channels separated by 12.5 kHz from each other with 4-level FSK modulation at 3.6 kbit/s. Before January 2018, only the higher 8 channels were allowed for digital TDMA operation.

Some Digital PMR446 radios (Hytera BD305LF, Retevis RT40, ...) support Dual Capacity Direct Mode (DCDM), which allows for the use of two timeslots during simplex (radio-to-radio) communication. This effectively doubles the channel capacity by allowing two simultaneous transmissions on one channel.

Color Code (0 to 16) is the equivalent of CTCSS for digital. It&#x27;s used to isolate a population of users (a company, an association, a family, ...).

By convention CC1 is used for public contact.

TalkGroups are used to separate groups of users (ex: TG1 for direction and TG2 for room service in a hotel using channel 12 CC7).

By contacting a specific TG, each user subscribing to this TG will hear you (Group Call).

A user can subscribe to many TGs (RX Group List).

It is also possible to contact all users in your color code (All Call).

Radio ID One for each user, to be contacted directly (Private Call).

===Digital FDMA===
Digital PMR446 dPMR (FDMA) uses 32 digital voice channels separated by 6.25 kHz from each other with 4-level FSK modulation at 3.6 kbit/s. Before January 2018, only the upper 16 channels were allowed for digital FDMA operation.


==PMR446 gateways==
Recently some users have implemented the simplex repeater system, a cheap and easy way to extend the radio range by using extra radios connected to a small repeater controller. This is also known as &quot;Parrot&quot;, &quot;ATX-2000&quot; or just &quot;Echo Repeater&quot; after how it sounds repeating every transmission it receives.

PMR446 gateways extend the range of PMR446. These gateways are connected through internet using a client/server VoIP system such as eQSO or the Free Radio Network (FRN).

<text>Ammersee (; English: Lake Ammer) is a &quot;Zungenbecken&quot; lake in Upper Bavaria, Germany, southwest of Munich between the towns of Herrsching and Dießen am Ammersee. With a surface area of approximately , it is the sixth largest lake in Germany. The lake is at an elevation of , and has a maximum depth of . Like other Bavarian lakes, Ammersee developed as a result of the ice age glaciers melting. Ammersee is fed by the River Ammer, which flows as the Amper out of the lake. Like neighbouring Lake Starnberg - deeper, bigger in surface area, similar in shape - it is a popular location for watersports.

Ammersee and the Amper are part of the ancient Celtic amber trading route leading to the Brenner Pass. The word &quot;Ammer&quot; is a 13th-century form of &quot;Amper&quot;, the Celtic &quot;*ambra&quot;, deriving from the Indo-European , &quot;wet, Water&quot;.

Passenger services have operated on the lake since 1879. Today they are operated by the Bayerische Seenschifffahrt company, using a mixture of historic paddle steamers and motor ships.

==Ecology, biology and conservation==
The water quality, which was endangered in the 1960s, was significantly improved by comprehensive wastewater remediation measures such as the construction of a ring main, the commissioning of the sewage treatment plant in Eching in 1971 and the rehabilitation of the sewage treatment plants in the Ammer catchment area. Further information on the history and development of the Eching wastewater treatment plant is provided by AWA-Ammersee, which manages drinking water and wastewater in the region. Since the mid-1980s, the nutrient load of the water has shifted from the eutrophic to the mesotrophic range, which means that the nutrient load is low to moderate, the production of algae is moderate, and the average visual depth is over 2 m. The use of the Ammersee as a bathing water is thus secured in the long term.

Among the fish living in the lake, an endemic whitefish (&quot;Coregonus bavaricus&quot;) is known, a whitefish species mainly found in the pre-Alpine lakes, whose occurrence has led to a long tradition of quite intensive fishing exploitation of the lake. The lake is also home of the vulnerable species of deepwater char &quot;Salvelinus evasus&quot;. Deepwater char are highly sensitive to changes in the quality of the water and some species such as &quot;Salvelinus neocomensis&quot; and &quot;Salvelinus profundus&quot; were driven recently to extinction in other European lakes. In 2010, even a new species of fish, the Ammersee Kaulbarsch (&quot;Gymnocephalus ambriaelacus&quot;), which is also found only in the Ammersee, was described.

With the nature reserves &quot;Vogelfreistätte Ammersee-Südufer&quot; (in which the &quot;Schwedeninsel&quot; is also located), &quot;Seeholz&quot; and &quot;Seewiese&quot; as well as &quot;Ampermoos&quot;, the Ammersee is one of the seven internationally important wetlands in Bavaria according to the so-called Ramsar Convention. On the western shore, access to the shore is closed to the general public except for short stretches, but almost the entire eastern shore is open to the public. Large areas of the shore are still in a near-natural state, but the formerly dense reed beds have decreased significantly since the end of the 1960s. In contrast, microplastic pollution has increased.

<text>The Grammy Award for Video of the Year was an honor presented to recording artists at the 24th Grammy Awards in 1982 and the 25th Grammy Awards in 1983 for music videos. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

First presented in 1982 to Michael Nesmith for &quot;Elephant Parts&quot;, the award was reserved for quality &quot;video cassettes or discs in any format created specifically for the home video market&quot;. In 1983, Olivia Newton-John was presented the award for &quot;Olivia Physical&quot;. Beginning with the 1984 Grammy Awards, the Video of the Year award category was replaced with the categories Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album (now known as Best Music Video and Best Music Film, respectively).

==Recipients==

Nominees for the 24th Grammy Awards (1982), Video of the Year included: Eubie Blake for &quot;One Night Stand: A Keyboard Event&quot;, the band Blondie for &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot;, Bruce Seth Green for the participative video collection of puzzles and games known as &quot;The First National Kidisc&quot;, and Michael Nesmith, former member of The Monkees, for the hour-long video &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; (also known as &quot;Michael Nesmith in Elephant Parts&quot;). &quot;One Night Stand&quot; was a recording of a jazz program billed as &quot;an evening of all-stars&quot; at Carnegie Hall, with appearances by Kenny Barron, Arthur Blythe, George Duke, Herbie Hancock, Roland Hanna, Bobby Hutcherson and ten other musicians. Blondie&#x27;s video cassette &quot;Eat to the Beat&quot; accompanied their 1979 album of the same title. &quot;The First National Kidisc&quot;, one of the first interactive and educational videodiscs, contained activities designed for children. Without &quot;fancy digital effects&quot;, Green&#x27;s &quot;Kidisc&quot; provided five to ten hours of interactive capability within a 30-minute video through the use of dual audio tracks, freeze framing, slow motion, and other techniques. Features included plane flying, jokes, paper plane construction, music performance, and other games.

The award went to Nesmith, who is known for creating one of the first companies to distribute television programs and films on home video, and for establishing the television music video format that eventually became MTV. In 1976, Nesmith produced a video for his song &quot;Rio&quot;, and later incorporated it into the &quot;montage of music and gags&quot; called &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; after starting the company Pacific Arts Video Records. In 1985, &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; was adapted into a seven-episode summer series on NBC titled &quot;Michael Nesmith in Television Parts&quot;.

Nominees for the 25th Grammy Awards included: Elton John for &quot;Visions: Elton John&quot;, Olivia Newton-John for &quot;Olivia Physical&quot;, the rock band The Tubes for &quot;The Tubes Video&quot;, a recording of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; by the Royal Opera conducted by Georges Prêtre with Plácido Domingo, and the interactive disc for children &quot;Fun and Games&quot; by various artists (produced by Margaret Murphy). Both &quot;Visions&quot; and &quot;The Tubes Video&quot; were directed by Russell Mulcahy. &quot;Visions&quot; consisted of &quot;artistic&quot; videos for all of the songs on John&#x27;s 1981 album &quot;The Fox&quot;. According to The Tubes&#x27; official site, the now out of print video collection contained music videos primarily for tracks that appeared on their 1981 album &quot;The Completion Backward Principle&quot;. The award was presented to Newton-John (then her fourth Grammy Award) in February 1983 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Released a few years following her role in the 1978 film &quot;Grease&quot;, the aerobics video contained songs from her 1981 album &quot;Physical&quot; as well as enough sexual innuendo and provocation to generate controversy.

==Category retirement==
The Video of the Year category was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, whose top award is also presented for Video of the Year. The Academy replaced the category with awards for Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album beginning with the 26th Grammy Awards. For the awards held in 1988 and 1989, the criteria changed and honors were presented for the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the two categories were renamed Best Long Form Music Video (changed to Best Music Film in 2014) and Best Short Form Music Video (shortened to Best Music Video in 2014) respectively.

<text>Shirley Ann Robertson, OBE DL (born 15 July 1968) is a British sailor and Olympic gold medallist. She is the first British woman to win an Olympic gold medal at consecutive games, Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004.

== Early life ==
Robertson was born in Dundee, Scotland, but spent her early life in Menstrie in central Scotland. Robertson began sailing at the age of seven on Loch Ard in Scotland. Her early passion for the sport was nurtured by her family, leading her to compete in local and national events.

== Career ==
Robertson&#x27;s first major international breakthrough came in the 1998 World Championships, where she won a silver medal in the Europe class. This set the stage for her Olympic debut at the 1996 Atlanta Games, where she competed in the Europe class, finishing in fourth place.

Robertson made a significant breakthrough during the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, where she won her first gold medal in the Europe class. This victory marked a significant moment in British sailing history, as it was the first time a British woman had won an Olympic gold in sailing.

Four years later, at the Athens 2004 Olympics, Robertson secured her second gold medal, this time in the Yngling class, alongside crew-mates Sarah Webb and Sarah Ayton. This achievement made her the first British woman to win gold medals at two consecutive Olympic Games.

=== Post-Olympic career ===
In January 2006 she became the regular presenter of &quot;Mainsail&quot;, a CNN monthly program devoted to the sailing world. She was also a commentator for the BBC&#x27;s sailing coverage at the 2008 Summer Olympics. 

Robertson nominated Callum Airlie as one of the seven teenagers to light the Olympic cauldron at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. During the games, she became a commentator for the BBC, commentating on the sailing from Weymouth.

In 2019, Robertson launched her own podcast series: &quot;Shirley Robertson&#x27;s Sailing Podcast&quot; which sees Robertson sit down for in depth and personal interviews with some of the leading figures from the sport of sailing.

In 2023, she became the godmother of MS &quot;Ambition&quot;, a cruise ship operated by Ambassador Cruise Line. The first stop on the ship&#x27;s maiden voyage was from Newcastle to Dundee, Robertson&#x27;s birth place.

== Competition record ==
== Honours and recognition ==
In recognition of her services to sailing, Robertson was named female World Sailor of the Year by the International Sailing Federation in 2000, and was appointed an MBE in 2000 and an OBE in 2005.

==Personal life==
Shirley married Jamie Boag in June 2006 with whom she has two children. They live in Cowes, on the Isle of Wight.

<doc id="912341" wikidata="Q1937463" url="?curid=912341" title="Minnie the Moocher">
<text>&quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; is a jazz song co-written by American musician Cab Calloway and first recorded in 1931 by Calloway and his big band orchestra, selling over a million copies. &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; is famous for its nonsensical ad libbed lyrics, also known as scat singing (for example, its refrain of &quot;Hi de hi de hi de ho&quot;). In performances, Calloway would have the audience and the band members participate by repeating each scat phrase in a form of a call and response, eventually making it too fast and complicated for the audience to replicate.

First released by Brunswick Records, the song was the biggest chart-topper of 1931. Calloway publicized and then celebrated a &quot;12th birthday&quot; for the song on June 17, 1943, while performing at New York&#x27;s Strand Theatre. He reported that he was then singing the song at both beginning and end of four performances daily, and then estimated his total performances to date: &quot;she&#x27;s kicked the gong around for me more than 40,000 times.&quot;

In 1978, Calloway recorded a disco version of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; on RCA Records which reached No. 91 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart.

&quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999, and in 2019 was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry as &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress. It has been argued that the record was the first jazz record to sell a million copies.

== Basis ==
The song is based lyrically on Frankie &quot;Half-Pint&quot; Jaxon&#x27;s 1927 version of the early 1900s vaudeville song &quot;Willie the Weeper&quot; (Bette Davis sings this version in &quot;The Cabin in the Cotton&quot;).

The lyrics describe the story of a woman known as &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, a &quot;moocher&quot; being American slang for a person who constantly asks others for money or who takes unfair advantage of generosity. She is described as a performer of the sexually-suggestive Hoochie Coochie dance. The lyrics are heavily laden with drug references, and describe Minnie&#x27;s vivid dreams after drug use. The character &quot;Smokey&quot; is described as &quot;cokey&quot;, meaning a user of cocaine; the phrase &quot;kick the gong around&quot; was a slang reference to smoking opium. The song ends with Calloway wailing &quot;Poor Min!&quot; insinuating an untimely end for the protagonist. The &quot;hi-de-ho&quot; scat lyrics came about when Calloway forgot the lyrics to the song one night during a live radio concert.

The November 22, 1951 issue of &quot;Jet&quot; magazine claimed the song was partly inspired by a woman named Minnie Gayton who had recently died at the age of 85, and was known in the Indianapolis area due to her begging for food. However, Calloway&#x27;s 1976 autobiography made no mention of Gayton.

==Notable performances and cover versions==
&quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; has been covered or simply referenced by many other performers. Its refrain, particularly the call and response, is part of the language of American jazz. At the Cab Calloway School of the Arts, which is named for the singer, students perform &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; as a traditional part of talent showcases.

In 1967, the song was covered again by an Australian band, The Cherokees. A version by the Reggae Philharmonic Orchestra made number 35 in the UK Singles Chart late in 1988. Tupac Shakur and Chopmaster J made a hip hop version of the song in 1989. The song can be found on &quot;&quot; from 2007. A contemporary swing band, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, recorded a cover on their 1998 album, &quot;Americana Deluxe&quot;. L.A.-based new wave/rock band Oingo Boingo has covered this song, as well as other Cab Calloway songs, during live performances throughout their career, dating back to their years as Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo.

On January 19, 2001, Wyclef Jean opened his &quot;All Star Jam @ Carnegie Hall&quot; concert with this number, walking to the stage from the back of the audience, dressed all in white like Calloway&#x27;s preferred white suit for performing. The song &quot;The Mighty O&quot; by Outkast is also heavily inspired by the &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;.

The English singer-songwriter Robbie Williams is famed (and often lightheartedly ridiculed) for his frequent tendency to engage in call and response with his audience. As a tongue in cheek retort to the criticism, he performed &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; on the Take the Crown Stadium Tour, albeit changing the lyrics to be about himself. He then released a studio recording of the song on his 10th studio album, &quot;Robbie Williams Swings Both Ways&quot;.

In 1992, rapper Positive K made a song called &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; for his 1992 album, &quot;The Skills Dat Pay da Bills&quot;.

During a performance on the first season of &quot;American Idol&quot;, Tamyra Gray performed this song on &quot;Big Band&quot; night.

Hugh Laurie, in a 2006 interview on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, stated that his charity cover band, Band from TV, has the most popular recording of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; available on the iTunes Store. Laurie also performs a part of the song in the first episode of the British comedy television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, playing the role of Bertie Wooster, duetting with Reginald Jeeves, played by Stephen Fry. The episode first aired in 1990. A recording was later released on the &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; soundtrack.

In 2009, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy covered the song again on their Calloway tribute album, &quot;How Big Can You Get?: The Music of Cab Calloway&quot;.

Calloway performs the song in the 1980 comedy film &quot;The Blues Brothers,&quot; in which he also plays a supporting role.

== In popular culture ==
===Film and television===
* &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; features in the television show &quot;Carnivàle&quot;.
* Ann&#x27;s father sings a shortened version of the song on an episode of &quot;That Girl&quot;.
* On an episode of &quot;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&quot; (Three&#x27;s a Crowd), Will Smith performs the &quot;hi-de-ho&quot; chorus and references Heidi Fleiss in the process.
* Opera singer Grace Moore performed the song in the 1937 film &quot;When You&#x27;re in Love&quot;, in a departure from her usual style.
* Bertie Wooster sings this song whilst playing the piano in &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot;, at first musing over the lyrics before insisting that an unenthusiastic Jeeves join in.
* Although it is not heard, the song is mentioned by name in the 1991 Sylvester Stallone movie, &quot;Oscar&quot;.
* The song is performed on screen with a video of Calloway at every New York Jets home game.
* In 1932, Calloway sang the first lines of the song in the title sequence of comedy film &quot;The Big Broadcast&quot;. He performs the full song later in the film, miming snorting cocaine in between verses.
* Calloway performed the entire song in the movie &quot;Rhythm and Blues Revue&quot; (1955), filmed at the Apollo Theater. Much later, in 1980 at age 73, Calloway performed the song in the movie &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;. Calloway&#x27;s character Curtis, a church janitor and the Blues Brothers&#x27; mentor, magically transforms the band into a 1930s swing band and sings &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; when the crowd becomes impatient at the beginning of the movie&#x27;s climactic production number. According to director John Landis in the 1998 documentary &quot;The Stories Behind the Making of &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;&quot;, Calloway initially wanted to do a disco variation on his signature tune, having done the song in several styles in the past, but Landis insisted that the song be rendered faithfully to the original big band version. Halfway through the song though, Calloway and the band would do a partial section of the song at a much faster pace, similar to Calloway&#x27;s later performances.
* In the 1935 Marx Brothers&#x27; film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Groucho Marx famously quipped, &quot;You&#x27;re willing to pay him a thousand dollars a night just for singing? Why, you can get a phonograph record of &#x27;Minnie the Moocher&#x27; for 75 cents. And for a buck and a quarter, you can get Minnie.&quot;
* In the 1979 film &quot;Escape to Athena&quot;, Stefanie Powers sings &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; for an audience of German officers in a POW camp.
* The band The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo performed the song in the Richard Elfman film &quot;Forbidden Zone&quot;, with altered lyrics and titled &quot;Squeezit the Moocher&quot;, after one of the movie&#x27;s characters, Squeezit Henderson. Danny Elfman, playing a rather vaudevillian Satan, sings the song as his band (other members of Oingo Boingo at the time) respond to his calls. Oogie Boogie&#x27;s song from &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, which Elfman composed the music for, is also similar to &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;.
* The popular refrain is performed by a funeral band in the 1999 film &quot;Double Jeopardy.&quot;
* The song is played multiple times in the early stages of the 2013 film &quot;Magic Magic&quot; starring Juno Temple.

===Animation===
* In 1932, Calloway recorded the song for a Fleischer Studios &quot;Talkartoon&quot; short cartoon, also called &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, starring Betty Boop and Bimbo, and released on March 11, 1932. Calloway and his band provide most of the short&#x27;s score and themselves appear in a live-action introduction, playing &quot;Prohibition Blues&quot;. The thirty-second live-action segment is the earliest-known film footage of Calloway. In the cartoon, Betty decides to run away from her parents after they insist in old-country broken English that she eat Hasenpfeffer despite her not wanting to (to the Harry Von Tilzer tune &quot;They Always Pick on Me&quot;), and Bimbo comes with her. While walking away from home, Betty and Bimbo wind up in a spooky area and hide in a hollow tree. A spectral walrus—whose gyrations were rotoscoped from footage of Calloway dancing—appears to them, and begins to sing &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, with many fellow ghosts following along, during which they do scary things like place ghosts on electric chairs who still survive after the shock, and a cat feeding her kittens so much milk that they grow big immediately while the mother grows thin and dies. After singing the whole number, the ghosts chase Betty and Bimbo all the way back to Betty&#x27;s home. While Betty is hiding under the covers of her bedsheets, her runaway note is torn up and the remaining letters read &quot;Home Sweet Home&quot;. In 1933 another Betty Boop/Cab Calloway cartoon with &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; was &quot;The Old Man of the Mountain&quot;.
* The 1933 Pooch the Pup cartoon &quot;She Done Him Right&quot; also features the song &quot;Minnie the Moocher&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot;. It was sung by the nightclub singer whom Pooch is in love with.
* In &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, the kickoff episode of the sixth season of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; is played while Han Solo (Peter Griffin) and Luke Skywalker (Chris Griffin) disguise themselves as stormtroopers to lead Obi-Wan Kenobi (Herbert), Chewbacca (Brian Griffin), C-3PO (Glenn Quagmire) and R2-D2 (Cleveland Brown) away from the Millennium Falcon to infiltrate the Death Star, coolly walking so as not to be noticed by the stormtrooper guards. This is a direct reference to the film &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, as Jake and Elwood Blues try to sneak past the police officers at their concert. When Stewie Griffin is writing a song to a love interest in the season 7 episode &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Three and a Half&quot;, Brian Griffin ridicules him for choosing an unoriginal formula for songwriting. When Stewie objects and asks for examples, Brian lists the song among many others as examples. Peter also sings the song in his car in the season 12 episode &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;.

===Music===
* Minnie herself is mentioned in a number of other Cab Calloway songs, including &quot;Minnie the Moocher&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot;, &quot;Ghost of Smokey Joe&quot;, &quot;Kickin&#x27; the Gong Around&quot;, &quot;Minnie&#x27;s a Hepcat Now&quot;, &quot;Mr. Paganini – Swing for Minnie&quot;, &quot;We Go Well Together&quot;, and &quot;Zah Zuh Zaz&quot;. Some of these songs indicate that Minnie&#x27;s boyfriend Smokey was named Smokey Joe as well.
* A number of Cab Calloway albums are called &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;. In 1932, the Boswell Sisters did their own jazz version of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; as did Fletcher Henderson and The Mills Brothers, followed in 1937 by Benny Goodman with an instrumental version.
* In the 1935 Marx Brothers&#x27; film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Groucho Marx famously quipped, &quot;You&#x27;re willing to pay him a thousand dollars a night just for singing? Why, you can get a phonograph record of &#x27;Minnie the Moocher&#x27; for 75 cents. And for a buck and a quarter, you can get Minnie.&quot;
* Jeffrey Lewis referenced &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot; in his song &quot;Mini-Theme: Moocher from the Future&quot; from his 2009 album &quot;&#x27;Em Are I&quot;.
* In 1931, the same year that Calloway recorded the first version of &quot;Minnie the Moocher&quot;, his sister Blanche (who performed as Blanche Calloway with her &quot;Joy Boys&quot;) recorded &quot;Growlin&#x27; Dan&quot;, in which Minnie is evoked, along with a variation on Calloway&#x27;s &quot;hi-de-ho&quot;.
* In 1940, The Dandridge Sisters performed the Jimmie Lunceford song &quot;Minnie the Moocher Is Dead&quot;.
* Minnie is referenced in Clarence Williams and His Orchestra&#x27;s 1934 song &quot;Jerry the Junker&quot;: &quot;Well, you&#x27;ve heard about Minnie the Moocher/ And about Smokey Joe / Gather &#x27;round friends and I&#x27;ll tell you a tale / Of a cat you oughta know&quot;.
* Referenced in Beastie Boys song &quot;Finger Lickin&#x27; Good&quot;: &quot;&#x27;Cause I&#x27;m Pete the Puma, Minnie the Moocher/Got every type of flavor that will suit &#x27;ya.&quot; The song was featured on the band&#x27;s multi-platinum album &quot;Check Your Head&quot; (1992).

<doc id="912344" wikidata="Q215223" url="?curid=912344" title="Hot Fuss">
<text>Hot Fuss is the debut studio album by American rock band the Killers, released on June 7, 2004, in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004, in the United States by Island Records. The album&#x27;s music is mostly influenced by new wave and post-punk. &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; spawned four critically and commercially successful singles: &quot;Mr. Brightside&quot;, &quot;Somebody Told Me&quot;, &quot;All These Things That I&#x27;ve Done&quot; and &quot;Smile Like You Mean It&quot;.

The album reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the UK Albums Chart. , &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; had sold more than seven million copies worldwide, including more than three million in the United States and more than two million in the United Kingdom. It has also been certified platinum or multi-platinum in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. The album and its first three singles went on to garner five Grammy Award nominations at the 47th Annual Grammy Awards in 2005.

==Background==
The album was recorded at various points throughout 2003 with Jeff Saltzman in Berkeley, California, with the exception of &quot;Everything Will Be Alright&quot;, which was recorded by Corlene Byrd in guitarist Dave Keuning&#x27;s apartment. Many of the tracks were originally recorded as demos, which the band decided to keep for their spontaneity. The album was mixed by Mark Needham at Cornerstone Studios in Los Angeles and Alan Moulder at Eden Studios in London. In 2012, Brandon Flowers told &quot;NME&quot; that he felt &quot;depressed&quot; after hearing the Strokes&#x27; album &quot;Is This It&quot;. &quot;That record just sounded so perfect&quot;, he said. &quot;We threw away everything [we were working on] and the only song that made the cut and remained was &#x27;Mr. Brightside.&#x27;&quot;

The songs &quot;Midnight Show&quot; and &quot;Jenny Was a Friend of Mine&quot; are two parts of the so-called &quot;Murder Trilogy&quot;, detailing the fictional story of a woman who is murdered by her jealous boyfriend. The first part, &quot;Leave the Bourbon on the Shelf&quot;, appears on the band&#x27;s B-sides and rarities compilation, &quot;Sawdust&quot;.

==Production==
The album heavily features a vocal effect called Echo Farm on Flowers&#x27; voice. In 2014, Needham recounted, &quot;There were three of us involved in the production company on that record: Braden Merrick, Jeff Saltzman and myself. Jeff and I had been partners for a few years. He was an entertainment attorney and was shopping stuff, but he actually really wanted to be a producer as well. We set Jeff up with a studio, got him started in recording and since he’s a smart guy, he picked it up really quick. At that time, Echo Farm had just come out, and that was really the only vocal effect he had. If you open up Echo Farm, the first setting that comes up is the default setting, which overdrives the vocal a bit and sets an 84 ms delay. That was basically what he put on everything and it sort of became the default vocal tone on the whole record, plus it worked really great, so we kept it. It changes a little bit on certain things, but it was a fairly consistent effect through the whole record.&quot;

==Artwork==
The album cover was photographed by Matthias Clamer in 2000, in the southern region of the suburbs of Beijing, China. The characters on top of each building (&quot;建&quot;, &quot;材&quot;, &quot;开&quot;, and &quot;发&quot;) translate to &quot;construction material development&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Hot Fuss&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the album has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100 based on 20 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

&quot;Hot Fuss&quot; was released on June 7, 2004, in the United Kingdom and on June 15, 2004, in the United States. In 2005, it was reissued as a box of eleven seven-inch vinyl discs, with an album track on each A-side and non-album tracks on the B-sides. The album reached number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on December 1, 2005, and as of January 2017, it had sold 3.75 million copies in the United States.

&quot;Hot Fuss&quot; topped the UK Albums Chart for two consecutive weeks in January 2005. It was the 26th bestselling album of the 2000s decade in the United Kingdom, and is listed among the top 40 longest-charting albums in the history of the UK Albums Chart, with 254 weeks. On July 22, 2013, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) certified the album seven-times platinum; by August 2020, it had sold 2,335,495 copies in the UK. In 2022 the album was named as the 20th most successful debut album in UK chart history. The album has also been certified platinum or multi-platinum in Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand. &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; had sold over than seven million copies worldwide as of December 2012.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; 43rd on its list of the &quot;100 Best Albums of the Decade&quot;, and it was, at one point, listed among the &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. Gigwise readers voted it the number-one &quot;Best Debut Album of All Time&quot; in 2013. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;Hot Fuss&quot; the 33rd of its list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Debut Albums of All Time&quot;.

<text>Nunivak Island (Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik: ; Nunivak Cup&#x27;ig: &quot;Nuniwar&quot;; ) is a permafrost-covered volcanic island lying about offshore from the delta of the Yukon and Kuskokwim rivers in the US state of Alaska, at a latitude of about 60°N. The island is in area, making it the second-largest island in the Bering Sea and eighth-largest island in the United States. It is long and wide. It has a population of 191 persons as of the 2010 census, down from 210 in 2000. The island&#x27;s entire population lives in the north coast city of Mekoryuk.

==People==

Nunivak has only one permanent settlement, Mekoryuk, on the north shore, with about 200 residents. In the 1880 United States Census, Ivan Petrof recorded 702 residents in nine villages on the island. An epidemic in 1900 decimated the population of the island. Emigration keeps the population small. Noted persons who have visited Nunivak include journalist Jon Lee Anderson, photographer Edward S. Curtis, Anne Makepeace, anthropologist Margaret Lantis, and the artist Muriel Hannah. Noted conservationist and outdoorsman Steven Rinella aired an episode of his television show &quot;Meat Eater&quot; in 2015 where he experienced a muskox hunt and explored the history and culture of the island and its people. 

Nearly all the permanent residents of Nunivak are Cup&#x27;it Eskimo, whose traditional language is a dialect of Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik known as Cup&#x27;ig or Nunivak Cup&#x27;ig. Cup&#x27;ig is the first language for many older islanders and is enjoying a dedicated revival among younger islanders as well, although nearly all &quot;Nuniwarmiut&quot; (Nunivak people) speak English. The people of Nunivak Island still depend to a large degree on subsistence hunting, and also commercial fishing and industrial work on the mainland.

==Geology and natural history==

Nunivak Island is volcanic in origin; most of the island is dominated by volcanic plateau 500 ft (160 m) or more above sea level. The island is dotted with about 60 cinder cones and four maars. Much of its surface consists of widespread, thin flows of pahoehoe lava from small shield volcanoes, which spread over sedimentary rock of the Cretaceous period. Volcanic eruptions took place during 5 periods of activity beginning 6.1 million years ago. Most of the volcanic field was formed during the two most recent eruptive periods during the Pleistocene ending about 300,000 years ago. Because of the history of volcanic activity, it is considered part of the Bering Sea Volcanic Province. The Ibkilwit Lava Bed is located on Nunivak Island.

Tundra is the main landscape feature; the largest trees on Nunivak are dwarf willow trees, most less than 4 ft (1.2 m) tall. More than 40 rivers drain the tundra upland. Brackish lagoons ring the eastern and southern shores, and steep, volcanic cliffs dominate the northwest shores.

At least 89 migratory seabird and waterfowl species have seasonal homes on Nunivak Island, including several endangered and threatened species. Dense summer-breeding rookeries are found on all shores of the island, and in inland tundra lakes.

Prehistorically, Nunivak was home to a modest herd of caribou, but these were exterminated after the introduction of firearms in the late 19th and early 20th century. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service introduced reindeer (the smaller Eurasian caribou) and musk oxen onto the island in the 1930s and 1940s. Large herds of these animals are maintained by the local Native Corporation of Mekoryuk. The muskoxen are most valued for their wool, or qiviut, which is collected after the animals shed in springtime for spinning into yarn, with one skein sometimes selling for $100.

Most of the island is part of the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The southern half of the island (600,000 acres) is protected as the Nunivak Wilderness.

==Culture==
The art of Nunivak Island has its roots in the ancient past. The oldest known sculpture is thousands of years old.

In the ancient times masks were made to sell or trade for goods needed to survive. Later masks were intended for festivities, dances, and traditional healing.This type of mask (there are many types of masks carved today) represents the life surrounding Nunivak Island. The walrus is what the loon depends on for survival. And, in turn, man depends on the loon and the walrus for survival. These are two of the traditional animals that were hunted by the men of the village in order to provide for their families.

The walrus is what the Nunivak peoples depended on to survive. It held much of the necessities of living in the Bering Sea. The skin of the walrus was used for waterproofing kayaks, the soles of mukluks (Cup&#x27;ig boots), and the intestine was used as waterproof rain gear that were of great necessity in earlier times. The bones were used as tools, the ivory for spear heads, and harpoon heads and carvings were made for trade. Also the loon pelts were transformed into beautiful winter coats that were also waterproof.

==Demographics==

Nunivak Island first reported on the 1880 U.S. Census as an unincorporated island, with 400 Yupik residents. In 1890, the villages on the island reported separately. It next reported in 1910 for the entire island through to 1940. Since 1950, any settlements on the island have reported separately again, though all residents now reside in Mekoryuk as of 2000 and 2010.
== Population ==
In 2004, 179 people lived on the island; According to the 2000 census, the population was 210. They all live in a single village on the island of Mekoryuk, located on the north coast of Nunivak. During the 1880 US Census, 702 islanders in nine settlements were recorded. An epidemic in 1900 devastated the population of the island. The constant exodus of people prevents population growth. Although almost all local people in Nunivak speak English; they speak the Nunivak Chupik dialect of the central Yupik language. Preservation of the Chupik language, which is taught in schools, is underway. Islanders still rely on hunting, as well as commercial fishing and seasonal work on the mainland.

<doc id="912351" wikidata="Q333359" url="?curid=912351" title="Richard I of Normandy">
<text>Richard I (28 August 932 – 20 November 996), also known as Richard the Fearless (French: &quot;Richard Sans-Peur&quot;; Old Norse: &quot;Jarl Rikard&quot;), was the count of Rouen from 942 to 996. Dudo of Saint-Quentin, whom Richard commissioned to write the &quot;&quot;De moribus et actis primorum Normanniae ducum&quot; (Latin, &quot;On the Customs and Deeds of the First Dukes of Normandy&quot;&quot;), called him a &quot;dux&quot;. However, this use of the word may have been in the context of Richard&#x27;s renowned leadership in war, and not as a reference to a title of nobility. Richard either introduced feudalism into Normandy or he greatly expanded it. By the end of his reign, the most important Norman landholders held their lands in feudal tenure.

==Birth==
Richard was born to William Longsword, &quot;princeps&quot; (chieftain or ruler) of Normandy, and Sprota, a Breton concubine bound to William by a more danico marriage. He was also the grandson of the famous Rollo. William was told of the birth of a son after the battle with Riouf and other Viking rebels, but his existence was kept secret until a few years later when William Longsword first met his son Richard. After kissing the boy and declaring him his heir, William sent Richard to be raised in Bayeux. Richard was about ten years old when his father was killed on 17 December 942. After William was killed, Sprota became the wife of Esperleng, a wealthy miller. Rodulf of Ivry was their son and Richard&#x27;s half-brother.

==Life==

With the death of Richard&#x27;s father in 942, King of West Francia Louis IV installed the boy, Richard, in his father&#x27;s office. Under the influence of Arnulf I, Count of Flanders, the king took him into Frankish territory to place him in the custody of the count of Ponthieu. However, the king reneged and seized the lands of the Duchy of Normandy. He then split up the duchy, giving its lands in lower Normandy to Hugh the Great. Louis IV thereafter kept Richard in close confinement at Lâon. Upon hearing that Richard was being held in captivity, the boy&#x27;s foster Osmond de Centville and Bernard the Dane formed a mob of knights and peasants across town and marched to the King&#x27;s palace. They threatened the king to force him to return Richard. Louis protested that he had kept Richard in his domain to train him in courtliness. He subsequently appeased the mob by holding Richard up in his arms for the crowd to see and returning him. Bernard de Senlis and Ivo de Bellèsme also assisted in Richard&#x27;s release, along with pagan Norse forces led by Harald of Bayeux.

In 946, at the age of 14, Richard allied himself with the Norman and Viking leaders in France and with men sent by Harold of Denmark. A battle was fought after which Louis IV was captured. Hostages were taken and held until King Louis recognised Richard as Duke, returning Normandy to him. Richard agreed to &quot;commend&quot; himself to Hugh, the Count of Paris, Hugh resolved to form a permanent alliance with Richard and promised his daughter Emma, who was little more than a girl, as a bride; the marriage would take place in 960.

Louis, working with Arnulf, persuaded Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor to attack Richard and Hugh. The combined armies of Otto, Arnulf, and Louis were driven from the gates of Rouen, fleeing to Amiens and being decisively defeated in 947. A period of peace ensued, Louis dying in 954, 13 year old Lothair becoming king. The middle-aged Hugh appointed Richard as guardian of his 15-year-old son, Hugh Capet in 955.

In 962, Theobald I, Count of Blois, attempted a renewed invasion of Rouen, Richard&#x27;s stronghold, but his troops were summarily routed by Normans under Richard&#x27;s command, and forced to retreat before ever having crossed the Seine river. Lothair, the king of the West Franks, was fearful that Richard&#x27;s retaliation could destabilize a large part of West Francia so he stepped in to prevent any further war between the two. In 987, Hugh Capet became King of the Franks.

For the last 30 years of his reign, Richard concentrated on Normandy itself, and participated less in Frankish politics and its petty wars. In lieu of building up the Norman Empire by expansion, he stabilized the realm and reunited the Normans, forging the reclaimed Duchy of his father and grandfather into West Francia&#x27;s most cohesive and formidable principality.

Richard died of natural causes in Fécamp on 20 November 996. He was buried at Fécamp Abbey, which he had founded. However, in 2016, what was believed to be his tomb was opened by Norwegian researchers who discovered that the interred remains could not have been those of Richard, as testing revealed that they were much older. Although it is not in doubt that Richard was buried in the Abbey in 996, it is known that his remains were moved within the Abbey several times after his burial.

===Relationships with France, England and the Church===
Richard used marriage to build strong alliances. His marriage to Emma of Paris connected him directly to the House of Capet. His second wife, Gunnor, from a rival Viking group in the Cotentin, formed an alliance to that group, while her sisters formed the core group that were to provide loyal followers to him and his successors.

His daughters forged valuable marriage alliances with powerful neighboring counts as well as to the king of England. Emma married firstly Æthelred the Unready and after his death in 1016, the invader, Cnut the Great. Her children included Edward the Confessor, Alfred Aetheling and with Cnut, Harthacnut, so completing a major link between the Duke of Normandy and the Crown of England that would add validity to the claim by William the Conqueror to the throne of England.

Richard also built on his relationship with the church, undertaking acts of piety, restoring their lands and ensuring the great monasteries flourished in Normandy. His further reign was marked by an extended period of peace and tranquility.

==Marriages and issue==

Richard&#x27;s first marriage in 960 was to Emma, daughter of Hugh the Great and Hedwige of Saxony. Richard and Emma were betrothed when both were very young. She died after 19 March 968, with no issue.

According to Robert of Torigni, not long after Emma&#x27;s death, Duke Richard went out hunting and stopped at the house of a local forester. He became enamored with the forester&#x27;s wife, Seinfreda, but she was a virtuous woman and suggested he court her unmarried sister, Gunnor, instead. Gunnor became his mistress and her family rose to prominence. Her brother, Herfast de Crepon, may have been involved in a controversial heresy trial. Gunnor was, like Richard, of Viking descent, being part Danish by blood. Richard finally married her to legitimize their children:

* Richard II &quot;the Good&quot;, Duke of Normandy
* Robert, Archbishop of Rouen, Count of Evreux
* Mauger, Count of Corbeil
* another son
* Emma of Normandy, wife of two kings of England, mother of two kings of England, and step-mother of another two kings of England
* Maud of Normandy, wife of Odo II of Blois, Count of Blois, Champagne and Chartres
* Hawise of Normandy m. Geoffrey I, Duke of Brittany

===Children outside marriage===
Richard was known to have had several other mistresses and had children with many of them. Known children are:

* Geoffrey, Count of Eu
* William, Count of Eu ( – 26 January 1057 or 58), m. Lasceline de Turqueville (d. 26 January 1057 or 1058).
* Beatrice of Normandy, Abbess of Montivilliers d.1034 m. Ebles of Turenne (d.1030 (divorced)

===Possible children===
* Guimara (Wimarc(a)) (b. ca. 986), died Montivilliers Abbey, Seine-Inferieure, Normandy, wife of Ansfred (Ansfroi) II &quot;le Dane&quot; le Goz, vicomte of Exmes and Falaise, mother of Robert FitzWimarc

<text>The Streltsy uprising of 1698 () was an uprising of the Moscow Streltsy regiments.
==Background==

Some Russian historians believe that the Streltsy uprising represented a reactionary rebellion against the progressive innovations of Peter the Great, who had left the country on a tour of cities in northern and western Europe at the time. Others see it as a riot against the yoke of serfdom oppression, military-service hardships and harassment.

The Moscow Streltsy, who had participated in Peter the Great&#x27;s Azov campaigns in 1695–1696, remained in Azov as a garrison. In 1697, however, the four regiments of Streltsy were unexpectedly sent to Velikiye Luki instead of Moscow. On their way there they were starving and carrying their ordnance by themselves, due to lack of horses. In March 1698, 175 Streltsy left their regiments and fled to Moscow to file a complaint. They secretly established contact with Sophia Alekseyevna, who had been incarcerated at the Novodevichy Monastery, and hoped for her mediation. The runaway Streltsy, despite their resistance, were sent back to their regiments, giving rise to discontent among the rest of them.

==Uprising==
On 6 June, the Streltsy removed their commanding officers, chose four electives from each regiment, and made their way to Moscow, getting ready to punish the boyars and foreign advisers and blaming them for all adversities. The rebels (approx. 2,300 men) intended to install Sophia or, in case of her refusal, her alleged lover Vasili Golitsyn, who had been in exile. Peter I ordered four regiments (4,000 men) and a cavalry unit under the command of Aleksey Shein and Patrick Gordon to attack the Streltsy. On 18 June, the Streltsy were defeated not far from the New Jerusalem Monastery (Voskresensky Monastery) 40 km west of Moscow.

==Aftermath==
Peter employed savage tortures while investigating the incident. Many suspects were whipped to death with the knout, an extremely stout leather whip composed of numerous twisted strands. Many were stretched until their limbs broke; sophisticated iron thumbscrews were applied to the fingers and toes of some prisoners; while others had their backs slowly roasted or had their flanks and bare feet slowly torn apart with red-hot iron pincers. Peter thus induced suspect after suspect to name accomplices in a virtually unending cavalcade of forced, and likely often false, confessions. 

Between 22 June and 28 June 1698, fifty-seven of the Streltsy uprising leaders were executed by hanging and the rest were sent into exile.
Upon his hurried return from London on 25 August 1698, Peter I ordered another investigation. Between September 1698 and February 1699, 1,182 Streltsy were executed and 601 were whipped, branded with iron, or (mostly the young ones) sent into exile. The investigation and executions continued up until 1707. The Moscow regiments, which had not participated in the uprising, were later disbanded. Streltsy and their family members were removed from Moscow.

<doc id="912357" wikidata="Q2672202" url="?curid=912357" title="Battle of Fort Sanders">
<text>The Battle of Fort Sanders was the crucial engagement of the Knoxville Campaign of the American Civil War, fought in Knoxville, Tennessee, on November 29, 1863. Assaults by Confederate Lt. Gen. James Longstreet failed to break through the defensive lines of Union Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside, resulting in lopsided casualties, and the Siege of Knoxville entered its final days.

==Background==
The Confederacy had fairly effective control of large areas of East Tennessee, though Slavery wasn&#x27;t practiced as widely in East Tennessee as in the other portions of the state. This led to, unlike the rest of the state, pro-Union sentiment before and after the Battle of Fort Sumter. Because the few slaves there were in East Tennessee were household slaves for luxurious purposes, East Tennesseans felt disconnected from the economic practice of plantation slavery. Many East Tennesseans were classified as Yeoman farmers, and held a high spirit for the Union. In fact, Tennessee would furnish more fleeing volunteers for the Union than all other Confederate states combined, as the majority of these fleeing volunteers were from East Tennessee. Although Union forces had fairly little trouble from the local populace when Burnside occupied Knoxville in September 1863, the Army had considerably more difficulty reaching Knoxville over the rugged mountainous roads of the region that were also fiercely defended by Confederates.

Union engineers commanded by Captain Orlando M. Poe built several fortifications in the form of bastioned earthworks near Knoxville. One was Fort Sanders, just west of downtown Knoxville across a creek valley.(Fort Sanders, originally &quot;Fort Loudon&quot; was an earthen fort that spanned Seventeenth between Laurel and Clinch, and continued along Laurel and Clinch eastward to Sixteenth Street).
It was named for Brig. Gen. William P. Sanders, mortally wounded in a skirmish outside Knoxville on November 18, 1863. The fort, a salient in the line of earthworks that surrounded three sides of the city, rose above the surrounding plateau and was protected by a ditch wide and deep. An almost vertical wall rose above the ditch. Inside the fort were 12 cannons and 440 men of the 79th New York Infantry.


As a Confederate army under General Braxton Bragg besieged Union forces at Chattanooga, Tennessee, a detachment under the command of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet, a trusted subordinate of Robert E. Lee, was sent to Knoxville to prevent Burnside&#x27;s Army of the Ohio from moving in support of Chattanooga. After Burnside escaped a trap at the Battle of Campbell&#x27;s Station, his men took up defensive positions around Knoxville and the Siege of Knoxville began on November 17, 1863. Longstreet determined that Fort Sanders was the most appropriate place to attempt a breakthrough of the Union defenses. He initially planned an assault on November 20, but chose to delay while he received reinforcements. His eventual assault was conducted by three infantry brigades, under Brig. Gen. Benjamin G. Humphreys, Brig. Gen. Goode Bryan, and Col. Solon Z. Ruff (commanding Wofford&#x27;s Brigade).

On November 23, 1863, Longstreet&#x27;s forces seized Cherokee Heights, a tall bluff south of the Holston River (now called the Tennessee River) from Knoxville, but only about from Fort Sanders. Longstreet&#x27;s original intent was to use artillery to &quot;soften up&quot; Fort Sanders in preparation for a frontal assault; however, at virtually the last minute, he changed the plan to a surprise infantry assault at dawn, hoping that the benefits of surprise would outweigh those of a cannonade. Inexplicably, he squandered the element of surprise by deploying skirmishers forward hours before the assault. Although this movement placed them in good positions for sharpshooting, it clearly revealed his plans to the Union troops.

==Battle==

The assault, conducted on November 29, 1863, was poorly planned and executed. Longstreet discounted the difficulties of the physical obstacles his infantrymen would face. He had witnessed, through field glasses, a Union soldier walking across the ditch and, not realizing that the man had crossed on a plank, believed that the ditch was very shallow. He also believed that the steep walls could be negotiated by digging footholds, rather than requiring scaling ladders.

The Confederates moved to within 120-150 yards of the salient during the night of freezing rain and snow and waited for the order to attack. Their attack at dawn has been described as &quot;cruel and gruesome by 19th century standards.&quot; They were initially confronted by telegraph wire that had been strung between tree stumps at knee height, possibly the first use of such wire entanglements in the Civil War, and many men were shot as they tried to disentangle themselves. When they reached the ditch, they found the vertical wall to be almost insurmountable, frozen and slippery. Union soldiers rained fire into the assault, including musketry, canister, and artillery shells thrown as hand grenades. Unable to dig footholds, men climbed upon each other&#x27;s shoulders to attempt to reach the top. A succession of color bearers was shot down as they planted their flags on the fort. For a brief time, three flags reached the top, those of the 16th Georgia, 13th Mississippi, and 17th Mississippi.

==Aftermath==

Longstreet undertook his Knoxville expedition, which he came to realize was far too soon, to divert Union troops from Chattanooga and to get away from General Braxton Bragg, with whom he was engaged in a bitter feud. Longstreet reevaluated what was supposed to be a surprise attack and saw how it was poorly planned and executed. Based on comparative casualties, it was one of the most lopsided Union victories of the war. From the beginning of the artillery bombardment until the Confederates broke and retreated, the attack on Fort Sanders lasted about forty minutes. About twenty minutes, or half of that time, were spent in the struggle for control of the parapet. In the brief period of 20 minutes of attacking, General Burnside&#x27;s chief engineer, Orlando M. Poe, wrote that he was unaware in the annals of military history where a storming party was so nearly annihilated. The Confederate troops sustained 813 casualties – 129 killed, 458 wounded, and 226 missing. Federal losses inside Fort Sanders amounted to only about 20 men, while another 30 were killed and injured outside the fort by Confederate artillery. Lieutenant Benjamin reported the Union losses in the fort as five killed and eight wounded, significantly less than their defeated opponent. About 250 prisoners and three flags fell into Union hands.

While Longstreet arranged to withdraw, Burnside sent a flag of truce to allow him to recover his dead and wounded from the field. It was a humanitarian gesture much appreciated by the Confederates. The Union details pulled the dead out on blankets and carried them to a point halfway across no-man&#x27;s-land for delivery to the Confederates. Many of the bodies had stiffened by this time, and the Federals temporarily leaned them up against the side of the blood-stained ditch. They recovered ninety-six bodies, mostly from inside the ditch, but also from the ground within several yards of the bastion. The Federals delivered slightly more than that number of wounded to the Confederates, for a total of 197. The Confederates identified the bodies of several high-ranking officers such as Solon Z. Ruff and Kennon McElroy.

On the afternoon of November 29, Longstreet changed his mind about disengaging from the Federals at Knoxville when dispatches arrived from Joseph Wheeler. The cavalry general had reached Ringgold, Georgia, on November 25 while making his way back to the Army of Tennessee, only to find that Bragg had been severely beaten at Chattanooga. Bragg asked him to inform Longstreet of the defeat and let him know to rejoin the Army of Tennessee at Dalton or to go back to Virginia if that was not possible. On Dec. 4 Longstreet withdrew from Knoxville and headed toward Rogersville, 65 miles to the northeast. Longstreet&#x27;s failure to take Knoxville scuttled his purpose and the Knoxville Campaign was essentially over, with the city remaining in Federal hands for the remainder of the war. This Confederate defeat, plus the loss of the Battle of Chattanooga on November 25, put much of East Tennessee in the Union camp.

==Battlefield today==
The Fort Sanders area became the site of many Victorian homes that were built approximately three decades later. Several, especially those located on the uphill sides of streets, are most impressive; some have been restored in recent decades. A few were incorporated into the grounds of the 1982 World&#x27;s Fair. Many more have been divided into apartments and are rented out to University of Tennessee students. In 1919, construction of Fort Sanders Regional Medical Center began on a section of the battlefield, uncovering various artifacts from the battle during its construction. The author James Agee was from this area; the exteriors for the motion picture version of &quot;All the Way Home&quot; were shot outside one of the more palatial homes, which has since burned. Agee&#x27;s novel, &quot;A Death in the Family&quot;, ends with Agee (&quot;Rufus&quot; in the novel) and his uncle conversing while looking out over the ruins of Fort Sanders. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

<text>Henry Baldwin (January 14, 1780 – April 21, 1844) was an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States from January 6, 1830, to April 21, 1844.

==Early life and education==
Baldwin descended from an aristocratic British family dating back to the 17th century. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the son of Michael Baldwin and Theodora Walcott. He was the half-brother of Abraham Baldwin. He attended Hopkins School, and received a B.A. at age 17 from Yale College in 1797, where he was also a member of Brothers in Unity. He also attended Litchfield Law School and read law in 1798. Baldwin then moved to Pittsburgh and established a successful law practice. He invested in iron furnaces north of the city, which prompted a move to Crawford County, Pennsylvania, of which he was elected the newly formed jurisdiction&#x27;s first district attorney and served from 1799 to 1801. He was also the publisher of &quot;The Tree of Liberty&quot;, a Democratic-Republican newspaper.

After the death of his first wife, Marana Norton, Baldwin married Sally Ellicott. He was elected to the United States Congress as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party in 1816, representing Pennsylvania&#x27;s 14th congressional district; he was reelected twice, but resigned in May 1822 due to poor health. Before resigning from Congress in 1822, he planted the seeds of a future political alliance with General Jackson by advising that Congress drop an investigation of unsanctioned military aggression in Florida. In 1828, Jackson rewarded his political services in Pennsylvania and advisory role in the presidential campaigns of 1824 and 1828 by nominating him to the cabinet post of Secretary of the Treasury. Jackson&#x27;s first attempt at nomination was blocked in the Senate by then Vice President John Calhoun, largely because of Baldwin&#x27;s strong position in favor of high-tariff policy. Baldwin served in this role until late 1829. His political popularity can be traced to his private investment in the economic growth of Pittsburgh. In the House, he was a prominent advocate of protective tariffs. He received support from Independent Republicans and Federalists for his support of the protective tariff as a national measure. He strongly supported the election of Andrew Jackson in the election of 1824 and 1828. When Bushrod Washington died after thirty-two years of service on the Supreme Court, the president appointed Baldwin to replace him. On January 6, 1830, the Senate approved Baldwin&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court 41 to 2 despite the Calhoun&#x27;s efforts. The only dissenters were the two senators from Calhoun&#x27;s home state of South Carolina. On January 18, 1830, Baldwin took the judicial oath to become an associate justice.

Baldwin considered resigning from the court in 1831. In a letter to President Jackson, he complained about the Court&#x27;s extension of its powers. Some historians believe that Baldwin suffered from mental illness during this period. However, he continued to serve on the court until his death in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1838, Baldwin was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

== Views ==
Baldwin was personally involved in cases on the issue of slavery. In the case of &quot;Johnson v. Tompkins&quot;, 13 F. Cas. 840 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1833), he instructed the jury that although slavery&#x27;s existence &quot;is abhorrent to all our ideas of natural right and justice,&quot; the jury must respect the legal status of slavery. He was the sole dissenter in the case &quot;United States v. The Amistad&quot;, in which Associate Justice Joseph Story delivered the Court&#x27;s decision to free the 36 kidnapped African adults and children who were on board the schooner, &quot;La Amistad&quot;. In &quot;Groves v. Slaughter,&quot; 40 U.S. (15 Pet.) 449 (1841), Justice Baldwin emphatically expressed his opinion that, as a matter of constitutional law, slaves are property, not persons.

In another federal case, Baldwin interpreted the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Constitution. That case was &quot;Magill v. Brown&quot;, 16 Fed. Cas. 408 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1833), in which Baldwin stated: &quot;We must take it therefore as a grant by the people of the state in convention, to the citizens of all the other states of the Union, of the privileges and immunities of the citizens of this state.&quot; This eventually became the view accepted by the Supreme Court, and remains so. He also interpreted the Clause that way, in &quot;dictum&quot;, when speaking for the Court in &quot;Rhode Island v. Massachusetts&quot;, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 657, 751 (1838) (each State &quot;by the Constitution has agreed that those of any other state shall enjoy rights, privileges, and immunities in each, as its own do&quot;).

Even though Baldwin&#x27;s opinions on the Court and his treatise were politically, jurisprudentially contrary to Marshall&#x27;s overarching influence on the Court, he was a friend and admirer of Chief John Marshall. He wrote of Marshall that &quot;no commentator ever followed the text more faithfully, or ever made a commentary more accordant with its strict intention and language.&quot; Baldwin was at Marshall&#x27;s bedside when the old Chief Justice died in 1835.

In 1837, Baldwin authored a treatise titled &quot;A General View of the Origin and Nature of the Constitution and Government of the United States: Deduced from the Political History and Condition of the Colonies and States&quot;. Baldwin opposed the two prevailing schools of Constitutional interpretation: the strict constructionists and the school of liberal interpretation. Likewise, his views followed a middle course between the extremes of states&#x27; rights on the one hand, and nationalism on the other hand.

== Critical cases ==
=== &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1832) ===
A case that demonstrates Baldwin&#x27;s admittedly inconsistent record of writing opinions and political boldness, as well as his unique style of jurisprudence is &quot;Worcester v. Georgia&quot; (1831). The statute in question was one of the &quot;Indian laws&quot; passed by the state legislature of Georgia forbidding white men from residing in Cherokee territory without a license from the state. Samuel Worcester and Elizur Butler, two missionaries who had been living with the Cherokees, were arrested in March 1831 for violating that statute. The Superior Court of Gwinnett County, Georgia, a trial court, which claimed that they were federal employees exempt from the law, subsequently released Worcester and Butler. Worcester and Butler were arrested again, convicted of violating the statute, and sentenced to four years in prison. They were offered a pardon, but refused, and appealed their case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court received this case because the clerk of the county court responded to this Writ of Error, although the judge never signed it. The state of Georgia never appeared in court, and publicly announced that it would disregard any decree of the court overturning the conviction.

The case was decided with five concurring in the majority (including Marshall), McLean in concurrence, and Baldwin in
dissent. Johnson was absent because of ill health. Story and Thompson&#x27;s support for the Cherokees was on record, and Marshall&#x27;s sympathetic posture paralleled his prior &quot;Cherokee Nation&quot; opinion. The court issued its decision on March 3, 1832, that the Georgia statutes were unconstitutional as applied to the Cherokee tribes. Marshall wrote for Duvall, Story, and Thompson. Baldwin based his dissent on his conclusion that the court lacked jurisdiction, as the record had been returned by the Georgia court clerk, and not by the court itself. He agreed with Justice Marshall&#x27;s opinion exclusively on his holding that the Cherokees were a sovereign nation &quot;which this court is bound to judicially know as such to have and possess a jurisdiction over the lands they occupy.&quot; Continuing his dissent, Baldwin ruled that the &quot;national existence of the Indian tribes,&quot; according to the Constitution, was subject to the power of Georgia &quot;by her own right and the Compact of 1802.&quot; Yet Baldwin never delivered his opinion to Reporter Peters. On March 3, 1832, many newspapers undertook the publishing of the opinions of the Court. As part of its anti-Worcester campaign, the principal press organ of the Jackson administration published Johnson&#x27;s anti-Cherokee concurrence in &quot;Cherokee Nation v. Georgia&quot; and promised to follow with Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Worcester&quot; dissent. Marshall&#x27;s &quot;Worcester&quot; opinion appeared on March 22. Baldwin&#x27;s lone dissent, delivered by a Jackson appointee, in a significant challenge by the collective Court to the Jackson administration had not yet appeared in print. Referring to the Court Report and an article published by the &quot;Washington Globe&quot; on March 3, 1832, one scholar concludes that the non-disclosure of his dissent is indicative of Baldwin&#x27;s awareness of the tense political climate over states&#x27; rights at the time. Another case in which Baldwin dissented was &quot;United States v. Amistad&quot; (1841), but as was common throughout Baldwin&#x27;s career, the opinion was not released.

=== &quot;Groves v. Slaughter&quot; (1841) ===
Baldwin issued a concurring opinion concerning the police power and interstate commerce in &quot;Groves v. Slaughter&quot; (1841). The facts of the case include that John W. Brown, in Mississippi, purchased slaves from Slaughter of Louisiana. Groves and Graham had signed as guarantors a note of purchase for seven thousand dollars for the benefit of Brown, but when the note was due Brown refused to pay it. Groves contended that the Mississippi Constitution of 1832, which prohibited the importation of slaves merchandise after May 1, 1833, voided the note. Slaughter brought the suit to federal court, and the differing citizenships as well as the amount of legal tender involved met the requirement necessary for an appeal to the United States Supreme Court. When Groves lost his case in the federal circuit, he appealed to the Supreme Court. Justice Smith Thompson held the majority of the court, and concluded that a statute was necessary before Mississippi&#x27;s constitutional provision would take effect, affirming the lower court ruling. Thompson avoided the question of whether the Mississippi Constitution violated the United States Constitution by infringing on the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce. After McLean and Taney gave their opinions on the subject, Baldwin came forth with his own opinion &quot;lest it be inferred&quot; that his opinions coincided with that of the other justices.

In a concurring opinion, Baldwin opposed Taney and McLean&#x27;s concurrences on questions about the commerce clause that were not needed to resolve the case. Chief Justice Taney had written separately to state that the importation of slaves &quot;cannot be controlled by Congress&quot;. Baldwin argues for five pages his position that slaves are property &quot;wherever slavery exists&quot;. Mary Sarah Bilder says Baldwin&#x27;s purpose in making these arguments was &quot;oblique&quot;.

Paul Finkelman says that by seeking to protect &quot;the rights of masters who might travel to free states&quot; Baldwin&#x27;s argument that slaves are property (not people) under the federal constitution was more &quot;shrewd and realistic&quot; than Taney&#x27;s argument rejecting Congressional authority.

Responding to Justice McLean&#x27;s pro-abolition defense that laws abolishing slavery were &quot;local in character&quot; and within the rights of state sovereignty Baldwin agreed that any state could abolish slavery but transit of property including slaves, &quot;is lawful commerce among the several states, which none can prohibit or regulate, which the constitution protects, and Congress may, and ought to preserve from violation.&quot;

Finkelman compares McLean&#x27;s abolitionist stand with Baldwin&#x27;s arguments rejecting the proposition that slaves were &quot;persons&quot; under the Constitution:

McLean looked to the Constitution to prove that slaves were &quot;persons,&quot; Baldwin looked to &quot;the law of the states before the adoption of the Constitution, and from the first settlement of the colonies&quot; to show that they were property. He also found support for this principle &quot;in our diplomatic relations...and in the most solemn international acts, from 1782 to 1815.&quot; That he might &quot;stand alone&quot; on the court did &quot;not deter&quot; him from declaring that slaves should be considered property and thus be protected while in transit.

Baldwin argues that a state can not restrict importation of slaves for sale if slavery was otherwise permitted. The state constitution could restrict importation of slaves under its police power for welfare and safety reasons but it could not restrict importation of slaves for sale when slavery was permitted in general. He concludes that the right to collect on the defaulted note would be protected under the Federal Constitution even if it was not protected by the state constitution of Mississippi.

== &quot;A General View of the Origin and Nature of the Constitution and Government of the United States&quot; (1837) ==
Baldwin was aware that his style of jurisprudence was inconsistent, often extreme, and politically inconsistent with his appointment. He acknowledged this in his 1837 work on the origin and nature of the United States Constitution and Government that &quot;I am well aware of departing from the modern mode of construing our ancient charters.&quot; Baldwin speaks on issues such as territory rights, the Articles of Confederation, State Sovereignty, Contract Cases, Definitions of A Corporation, etc. He holistically delineates his view on Constitutional issues beginning with the Founding of the nation. Further, despite his expressed affection for Marshall, Baldwin&#x27;s work counters Marshall&#x27;s expansive use of the Constitution to expand the prestige of the Court. Referring to McCulloch v. Maryland, Baldwin explains that &quot;he has given no &quot;construction&quot; to the constitution; he has only declared what it says, by carrying out the general terms it uses, and making a practical application thereof, to the various cases, in which he has delivered the opinion of the Court.&quot; Baldwin&#x27;s work is based on the Constitution and the Federal Government as instruments of the people, his interpretation of the original intent of the Founders, the influence of English Common Law as a &quot;standard rule by which to measure the different parts of the Supreme Law,&quot; and, lastly, the federal government holding a &#x27;grant&#x27; of power that can be defined explicitly by the supreme law of the Constitution. Justice Story saw this work as imposing &quot;severe strictures&quot; on his work, &quot;Commentaries on the Constitution&quot;, and on the Constitution itself.

== Death and legacy ==
Baldwin&#x27;s time on the court was punctuated by physical and mental health problems as well as a tendency to shed the legal, social, and political norms of the court. One scholar, G. Edward White, has suggested that Baldwin&#x27;s lack of &quot;any historical reputation&quot; results not from any lack of intrinsic interestingness but from his &quot;incoherence as a jurist.&quot; Though White is particularly unforgiving, this is the general consensus of modern scholarship for Baldwin&#x27;s 15-year term on the court. The most complimentary of scholarly opinion on Baldwin praises his role as an &quot;unyielding champion of the Constitution and the federal system,&quot; but at the same time labels him a &quot;political maverick.&quot;

Baldwin suffered from paralysis in later years and died a pauper, aged 64. Historian William J. Novak of the University of Chicago has written that &quot;Baldwin&#x27;s jurisprudence has been treated rather shabbily by historians.&quot;

Baldwin&#x27;s remains were initially interred at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C. His remains were later disinterred and moved to Greendale Cemetery, Meadville, Pennsylvania. He is the namesake of Baldwin, Pennsylvania.

He was the half-brother of United States Constitution signatory Abraham Baldwin.

His home is now a museum and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="912367" wikidata="Q6002073" url="?curid=912367" title="Image-stabilized binoculars">
<text>Image-stabilized binoculars are binoculars that have a mechanism for decreasing the apparent motion of the view due to binocular movement.
Such binoculars are designed to minimize image shaking in hand-held applications. Higher-power binoculars magnify the image more, but the image shift is also increased. This means that even minor hand movements can cause huge image shifts. Image stabilization technology in binoculars ensures instant adjustment of the image to compensate for the motion. Major brands making image stabilized binoculars include Canon, Fujinon, Nikon, Carl Zeiss, and Bushnell.

Several different mechanisms have been used for image stabilization.

==Active systems==
In these systems the change in attitude of the binoculars is sensed electronically, and some part of the system is changed to correct this offset. A lens group may be shifted, or the angle of a fluid filled prism may be changed.

==Passive systems==
In these systems there is no feedback from a sensor to the corrective element. The whole binocular may be stabilized by use of a gyroscope, or the binocular prisms may be disengaged from the housings, allowing them to be unaffected by binocular movement.

==Use==
Image-stabilized binoculars are frequently used when viewing from a moving object such as a boat or plane. They are also very helpful with high powered binoculars. Image stabilized binoculars have become popular with amateur astronomers.

==Other image-stabilized optics==
Image stabilization is also used in video and camera lenses.

<doc id="912372" wikidata="Q817839" url="?curid=912372" title="Bennett, British Columbia">
<text>Bennett, British Columbia, Canada, is an abandoned town next to Bennett Lake and along Lindeman Creek (formerly known as the One Mile River). The townsite is now part of the Chilkoot Trail National Historic Site of Canada and is managed by Parks Canada. Bennett is also a stop on the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad during the summer months.

==History==

Bennett was built during the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897–1899 at the end of the White Pass and Chilkoot Trails from the nearby ports of Skagway and Dyea in Alaska. Gold prospectors would pack their supplies over the Coast Mountains from the ports and then build or purchase rafts to take them down the Yukon River to the gold fields around Dawson City, Yukon. When the White Pass and Yukon Route Railroad was completed in 1900 it went right to Whitehorse, passing the town. This led the entire economy of Bennett, based on stampeders and river travelers, to collapse.

One of the establishments in Bennett was the Arctic Hotel, a combination saloon, restaurant, and hotel set up by Friedrich &quot;Fred&quot; Trump (grandfather of Donald Trump) and Ernest Levin. The establishment included a brothel, a portrayal that Donald Trump said was &quot;totally false&quot;.

<text>Daniel Corbett is an English broadcast meteorologist, who worked for the Met Office and the BBC for many years until May 2011. He joined the Met Office and BBC Weather Centre in 1997, after beginning his career in the United States. In May 2011, Corbett made his final BBC weather report prior to taking up a new post in New Zealand with the MetService. He currently works for TVNZ.

==Early life==
Corbett was born in Dagenham and grew up in Billericay.

==The BBC (1997–2011)==
In 1997 Corbett was invited to join the Met Office and the BBC to help launch the new BBC News 24. He was a key member of the weather team and presented the first ever weather forecast on the channel. He also appeared on a range of other BBC output, including forecasts for BBC Breakfast News in 1998, appearances on BBC One and BBC Two and broadcasts across the BBC&#x27;s network of radio stations. In 2000 Corbett returned to the US, where he freelanced as a meteorologist for a number of TV stations across the southern states, including KRIV in Houston, Texas. In 2001 he moved to Tucson, Arizona, where he worked at KGUN-TV as a weather forecaster and feature reporter. Corbett spent three months back at the BBC Weather Centre in summer 2003 presenting forecasts on BBC World, before returning to the US. He returned to the UK, BBC and Met Office in 2004. Since 2005, Corbett has presented forecasts for the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships live from the courtside for two weeks each summer. In July 2007 Corbett appeared regularly on BBC News covering severe flooding in southern Britain. He also presented several forecasts BBC One live from the floodwaters in Gloucestershire. His experience of working in the US means Corbett was often called upon to comment on severe weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes on various BBC News programmes and the BBC News channel. On 17 May 2011 he announced on BBC Radio 5 Live that he was leaving the BBC to work in New Zealand for the Met Service. He made his final 5 Live forecast on 18 May 2011.

==Met Service and 1 News (2011–present)==
After three years in New Zealand, he made his final Met Service forecast on 9 May 2014.
In September 2014, it was announced that he would be joining the 1 News weather team at TVNZ. He made his first weather presentation on TVNZ, where he currently works, in September 2014.

<doc id="912378" wikidata="Q544716" url="?curid=912378" title="Cineas">
<text>Cineas () was a man from Thessaly and an important adviser of King Pyrrhus. He had a reputation for great wisdom and was a pupil of Demosthenes the orator and was the only man who could be compared in skill with Demosthenes. Pyrrhus held him in high regard. Cineas was an Epicurean according to Cicero and Plutarch. Plutarch wrote that Pyrrhus sent Cineas to many cities in Greece as an ambassador and &quot;used to say that more cities had been won for him by the eloquence of Cineas than by his own arms; and he continued to hold Cineas in especial honour and to demand his services.&quot;

Plutarch wrote that prior to Pyrrhus undertaking the Pyrrhic War, Cineas tried to dissuade him from waging war against Rome in Italy and urged him to be satisfied with the possessions he already had. He asked Pyrrhus a series of questions: how he would use a victory against the Romans, what he would do after taking Italy, whether his expedition would stop with the taking of Sicily (according to Plutarch, Pyrrhus wanted to take Sicily as well as Italy) and, since Pyrrhus said that he would go on to take Libya and Carthage so that no enemies who threatened him would offer further resistance, he asked what he would do &quot;when we have got everything subject to us&quot;. The reply of Pyrrhus to the last question was: &quot;We shall be much at ease, and we&#x27;ll drink bumpers, my good man, every day, and we&#x27;ll gladden one another&#x27;s hearts with confidential talks.&quot; Cineas got Pyrrhus where he wanted in order to make his point and said: &quot;Surely this privilege is ours already, and we have at hand, without taking any trouble, those things to which we hope to attain by bloodshed and great toils and perils, after doing much harm to others and suffering much ourselves.&quot; Cassius Dio wrote that Cineas saw the folly of Pyrrhus&#x27; expedition and tried to dissuade him. He wrote: [Pyrrhus] intended by his prowess to rule the whole earth, whereas Cineas urged him to be satisfied with his own possessions, which were sufficient for enjoyment. But the king&#x27;s fondness for war and fondness for leadership prevailed against the advice of Cineas and caused him to depart in disgrace from both Sicily and Italy, after losing in all of the battles countless thousands of his own forces.&quot;

Pyrrhus did not listen to Cineas. Ostensibly, he waged war against Rome to support the Greek city of Tarentum, in southern Italy, in a dispute with the Romans. Before sailing to Tarentum, Pyrrhus sent Cineas to that city in advance with some troops. This helped to sway the people of Tarentum from attempting a reconciliation with Rome.

After his victory in the Battle of Heraclea, Pyrrhus sent his ambassador Cineas to negotiate with the Romans. Cineas offered to free the Roman prisoners, also promised to help the Romans with the subjugation of Italy and asked only friendship and immunity for Tarentum in return. Many senators were inclined towards peace (in Plutarch&#x27;s account) or a truce (in Cassius Dio&#x27;s account) because the Romans would have to face a larger army as the Italic peoples who were allies of Pyrrhus had now joined him. However, Appius Claudius Caecus, who was old and blind and had been confined to his house, had himself carried to the senate house in a litter. He said that Pyrrhus was not to be trusted and that a truce (or peace) was not advantageous to the state. He called for Cineas to be dismissed from the city immediately and for Pyrrhus to be told to withdraw to his country and to make his propositions from there. The senate voted unanimously to send away Cineas that very day and to continue the war for so long as Pyrrhus was in Italy. Plutarch wrote that Cineas assessed that the Romans now had twice as many soldiers as those who fought at the Battle of Heraclea and that &quot;there were many times as many Romans still who were capable of bearing arms.&quot;

<text>White Pass, also known as the Dead Horse Trail (elevation ), is a mountain pass through the Boundary Ranges of the Coast Mountains on the border of the U.S. state of Alaska and the province of British Columbia, Canada. It leads from Skagway, Alaska, to the chain of lakes at the headwaters of the Yukon River (Crater Lake, Lake Lindeman, and Bennett Lake).

==History==
The White Pass was closely controlled by the Chilkoot Indians and was unknown to non-natives until 1887. While in Juneau, William Ogilvie had heard reports of a low pass near the Deyes Inlet to the headwaters of the Lewes River (Yukon River). The Ogilvie expedition was on its way to the Yukon territory in order to survey and mark the international boundary on the Yukon River. In June 1887, Ogilvie&#x27;s expedition was at the head of Taiya Inlet doing a survey from Pyramid Island up through the Chilkoot Pass. William Moore, who had travelled up from Juneau on the steamer, had experience building roads in mountainous areas and wanted to try this route since the Chilkoot Pass was reported to be too steep for a wagon road. They had heard rumors about another lower pass that the Chilkoot Indians controlled. Ogilvie made inquiries and learned there was such a pass. An Indian named Jim, after much talk and encouragement, was persuaded to reveal it. Moore and his guide went over this low altitude pass. Ogilvie and his surveying party ascended the Chilkoot Pass. Among the many Chilkoot Indians hired to carry their supplies up the pass was Skookum Jim Mason, who, with his family, discovered the rich gold deposits in the Klondike. Moore did a rough survey of the new pass and returned with the satisfaction that he had found the route for his wagon road. The White Pass was named for the Canadian Minister of the Interior Thomas White by William Ogilvie.

William Moore and his son returned to stake a homesteader&#x27;s claim in Skagua, as it was then known. They built a cabin and a wharf and surveyed a town site they called Mooresville. In 1894, the North-West Mounted Police arrived at Dyea and Mooresville on their way to Canada&#x27;s Yukon Territory. The first group of prospectors hiked up Moore&#x27;s crude trail over the White Pass. Once the gold rush began, the Moores were overrun. Mooresville was resurveyed by Frank Reid as Skaguay. The crude trail was made into a toll road by George A. Brackett, and the North-West Mounted Police guarded the passes and briefly maintained a post in Skaguay, which Canada claimed.

===Gold rush years===

The White Pass trail was one of the two main passes used by prospectors during the Klondike Gold Rush. The White Pass was an easier route to Lake Bennett than the Chilkoot Trail a few kilometers to the west, but it harbored a criminal element that preyed on the &quot;cheechakos&quot; (newcomers to the Klondike). These con artists were believed to be members of the infamous Soapy Smith gang from Skagway, Alaska. In 1898, Smith was killed at the famed Shootout on Juneau Wharf and his gang were run out of Skagway and the White Pass. So many horses died during the gold rush, the trail became known as the &quot;Dead Horse Trail&quot;. The trail ended at Lake Bennett, where the prospectors built or purchased rafts or boats to float down the Yukon River to the Klondike gold fields near Dawson City.
The White Pass and Yukon Route (W.P. &amp; Y.R.) narrow-gauge railroad was built between 1898 and 1900 through White Pass. The southern end of the Klondike Highway also uses the White Pass and parallels the railway.

The Skagway Historic District and White Pass is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

Due to the harsh climate, grueling conditions, and length of journey, travelers on both the Chilkoot Trail and White Pass suffered from widespread starvation. Many of the starving people on the White Pass made meals of dead horses they found along the road.

==Climate==
There is a weather station for the Captain William Moore Bridge on the Alaskan side of White Pass, located near the summit at an elevation of 2250 ft (686 m).

<text>Teachers College, Columbia University (TC) is the graduate school of education under Columbia University, a private research university in New York City. Founded in 1887, Teachers College has been a part of Columbia University since 1898. 
==History==

=== Founding and early history ===

Teachers College was the first graduate school in the United States whose curriculum focused specifically on teacher education. 

In 1880, the Kitchen Education Association (KEA), also known as the Kitchen Garden Association, was founded by philanthropist Grace Hoadley Dodge, the daughter of wealthy businessman William Dodge. The association&#x27;s focus was to replace miniature kitchen utensils for other toys that were age-appropriate for kindergarten-aged girls. In 1884, the KEA was rebranded to the Industrial Education Association (IEA), in the spirit of widening its mission to boys and parents. Three years later, it moved to the former Union Theological Seminary building on University Place, as well as founded a coeducational private school called the Horace Mann School.

In 1887, William Vanderbilt Jr. offered a substantial financial sum to the IEA. With the support of Dodge, Vanderbilt appointed Nicholas Murray Butler, the future longest-serving president of Columbia University and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, as new president of the IEA. The IEA decided to provide schooling for the teachers of the poor children of New York City. Thus, in 1887–1888, it employed six instructors and enrolled 36 juniors in its inaugural class as well as 86 special students. To reflect the broadening mission of education beyond the original philanthropic intent set forth by Dodge, the IEA changed its name to the New York School for the Training of Teachers, and received its temporary charter from the New York State Board of Regents.
By October 1890, the school&#x27;s trustees were looking for a new campus, as the University Place campus was considered too small. After discussion with Columbia University president Seth Low, the trustees settled on a site in Morningside Heights, near where Columbia&#x27;s campus was being built. In 1892, the name of the New York School for the Training of Teachers was again changed to Teachers College. The next year, Teachers College and Columbia University were affiliated with each other, and the trustees acquired land for the new college campus in Morningside Heights. The buildings for the campus of the college were designed by William Appleton Potter. The first structure in the original complex, Main Hall, was completed in late 1894; the last, Milbank Memorial Hall, was finished three years later.

The curriculum combined a humanitarian concern to help others with a scientific approach to human development. The college was affiliated with Columbia University in 1898 as the university&#x27;s Graduate School of Education. A new building for Horace Mann was erected in 1899, followed by the Frederick Ferris Thompson Memorial Hall in 1902–1904. Additionally, a four-wing dormitory building, called Whittier Hall, was built in 1900–1901. Enrollment increased quickly: the graduating class of 1911 contained 686 students, as opposed to the 26 students in the first graduating class.

=== Expansion of scope ===

The founders early recognized that professional teachers need reliable knowledge about the conditions under which children learn most effectively. As a result, the college&#x27;s program from the start included such fundamental subjects as educational psychology and educational sociology. The founders also insisted that education must be combined with clear ideas about ethics and the nature of a good society; consequently, programs were developed in the history of education and in comparative education.

As the number of school children increased during the twentieth century, the problems of managing the schools became ever more complex. The college took on the challenge and instituted programs of study in areas of administration, economics, and politics. Other programs developed in such emerging fields as clinical and counseling psychology, organizational psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, curriculum development, instructional technology, media studies, and school health care.

Teachers College, Columbia University, was also associated with philosopher and public intellectual John Dewey, who served as president of the American Psychological Association and the American Philosophical Association, and was a professor at Teachers College from 1904 until his retirement in 1930.

===Presidents===


==Academic programs==

The school offers Master of Arts (M.A.), Master of Education (Ed.M.), Master of Science (M.S.), Doctor of Education (Ed.D.), and Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degrees in over sixty programs of study. Despite the college&#x27;s name, less than one-third of students are preparing to become teachers. Graduates pursue careers, for example, in the social sciences, health and health promotion, educational policy, technology, international and comparative education, as well as educational leadership.

According to former Teachers College president Susan Fuhrman, the school provides solutions to the difficult problems of urban education, reaffirming its original mission in providing a new kind of education for those left most in need by society or circumstance. The college continues its collaborative research with urban and suburban school systems that strengthen teaching in such fundamental areas as reading, writing, science, mathematics, and the arts; prepares leaders to develop and administer psychological and health care programs in schools, businesses, hospitals and community agencies; and advances technology for the classroom, developing new teaching software and keeping teachers abreast of new developments.
Teachers College also houses a wide range of applied psychology degrees, including one of the nation&#x27;s leading programs in organizational psychology. Every year captains from the United States Military Academy at West Point are selected for the Eisenhower Leader Development Program (ELDP) and complete the Organizational Psychology M.A. program to become tactical officers (TAC) at West Point.

The college also houses programs in anthropology. It was foundational in the development of the field of anthropology and education. By the 1930s, Teachers College had begun to offer courses in anthropology as part of the foundations of education. By 1948 Margaret Mead started what would be a long association with Teachers College where she taught until the early 1970s. In 1953 Solon Kimball joined the faculty. In 1954 nine professors (including Mead and Solon Kimball) came together to discuss the topic. In the 1960s, these people formed the Council on Anthropology and Education within the American Anthropological Association, and it is still considered as the leading organization in the field.
The student experience at Teachers College is governed by a student senate, headed by the Senate president, followed by the vice-president, parliamentarian, communications officer, and treasurer. Two senators, a master&#x27;s candidate, and a PhD candidate are elected each year to represent each academic department at Teachers College to advocate on behalf of current students and alumni. The TC Senate meets bi-weekly to determine what issues need to be investigated.

===Rankings===
For 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Teachers College, Columbia University #1 among all graduate schools of education in the United States. In 2008, 2002, 1998, 1997, and 1996 Teachers College, Columbia University was also ranked #1 in the category of graduate schools of education in the United States by U.S. News.

==Relationship with Columbia University==
Teachers College serves as Columbia University&#x27;s graduate school of education and psychology, and while Teachers College holds its own corporate status, an independent administrative structure, board of trustees and endowment, 
Teachers College graduates are awarded Columbia University degrees according to the statutes of Columbia University, 

Although the college houses PhD programs, these degrees are conferred by Columbia University&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences in a manner analogous to the PhD programs of the university&#x27;s other professional schools.

Teachers College&#x27;s graduating class participates in the Columbia University Commencement ceremony. TC graduates are Columbia University alumni, may attend Columbia Alumni Association events, retain their @columbia.edu email for life, and are eligible for nomination of the alumni medal and membership to the Columbia University Club of New York.

While Teachers College faculty appointments are approved by Teachers College&#x27;s board of trustees at the discretion of the president of Columbia University, &quot;Columbia University [has] no responsibility for salaries, tenure, or retirement allowances&quot; of officers of Teachers College.
Teachers College shares academic and institutional resources with greater Columbia University including courses of instruction (Teachers College students may take courses at any other Columbia University graduate school and vice versa.), libraries, health service systems, research centers, classrooms, special event facilities and the Dodge Fitness Center. 

During COVID-19, the Ivy League allowed Columbia fourth-year senior student-athletes, who lost playing time due to pandemic-related cancellations in their final year of eligibility, to continue playing their varsity sport for the 2021–22 season if they were accepted to and enrolled at Teachers College.

The Columbia University Senate includes faculty and student representatives from Teachers College who serve two-year terms; all senators are accorded full voting privileges regarding matters impacting the entire University. The president of Teachers College is a dean in the university&#x27;s governance structure.

==Housing==

The college has three residence halls for single students. They are 517 West 121st, Grant Hall, and Whittier Hall. The college has three residence halls for family housing. They are Bancroft Hall, Grant Hall, and Sarasota Hall. One bedroom apartments are available for childless students and students who have one child. Two and three-bedroom apartments are available for students who have more than one child. Lowell Hall and Seth Low Hall have faculty housing units.

== Publications ==
The &quot;Teachers College Record&quot; has been published by the college continuously since 1900. In 1997 a group of doctoral students from Teachers College established the journal &quot;Current Issues in Comparative Education&quot; (CICE), a leading open-access online academic journal.

Teachers College Press, founded in 1904, is the national and international book publishing arm of Teachers College and is dedicated to deepening the understanding and improving the practice of education. Teachers College also publishes &quot;The Hechinger Report,&quot; a non-profit, non-partisan education news outlet focused on inequality and innovation in education that launched in May 2010.

The &quot;Journal of Mathematics Education at Teachers College&quot; (JMETC with ) is affiliated with the Teachers College Program in Mathematics Education. It is a successor to an earlier publication by the Program in Mathematics and Education at Teachers College.

<doc id="912397" wikidata="Q5064156" url="?curid=912397" title="Ceremonial drum">
<text>Ceremonial drums are membranophones and idiophonic slit drums, which are played in a ritual context cult, religious or ceremonial social occasions by indigenous peoples around the world, often accompanied by singing or chanting.

Some ceremonial drums were specially made for their purpose and are accordingly elaborately designed. This includes drums, which are considered sacred objects and may only be used by a certain group of people. The drums can be played solo or in a small ensemble to accompany singing in ritual rituals, or can belong to a larger orchestra for courtly ceremonies and plays. Ceremonial drums can include tubular drums standing upright on the floor, large kettle drums, hand-held frame drums, and wooden slit drums.

==Distribution==
===Africa===
In Sub-Saharan Africa, certain drums are only used in secret-society ceremonies or initiations. The Ewe in the south of Ghana use a ceremonial drum orchestra that performs at funerals or to worship deities of traditional religion. The gankogui double-stemmed bell sets the pace. Almost each of the orishas revered in the Yoruba religion has its own drum orchestra, which is of central importance for the cult of the respective deity. Drum music also represents the medium through which the ritual participant in ecstasy get in touch with the gods. The drums played at religious ceremonies of the Yoruba are tubular drums that are open at the bottom and are covered with fur on one side. In the case of the Yoruba&#x27;s &quot;ìgbìn&quot; drum, its wooden body stands on carved feet. According to tradition, these drums were once human beings before the Orishas brought them to earth.

The palace music played by traditional African rulers at court ceremonies includes drums and wind instruments; in northern Nigeria, for example, the cylinder drum &quot;gangan&quot;, the long trumpet &quot;kakaki&quot; and the cone oboe &quot;algaita&quot;. Kettle drums used in ceremonial court music in northern Africa can be traced back in individual cases to Arab influence and the naqqara kettle-drum pair, played in Islamic military bands and palace orchestras. This influence also applies to the long African metal trumpets, which are derived from the Arabic nafīr or the karnay. Ceremonial drums are often an indispensable part of the insignia of the ruler, without whose possession and ritual use he cannot be introduced into his office. According to a 1930 era description about the inauguration of the local &quot;May&quot; (ruler) of &quot;Fika, Nigeria&quot;, the superordinate Hausa &quot;Madaiki&quot; (leader) takes the small &quot;successor drum&quot; into the palace and carries it hidden under his cloak into his house. On the evening after the funeral, the Madaiki brings the snare drum and a large ceremonial drum into the palace, appoints the successor and installs him immediately in his office. When May beats the metal kettle drum three times and the Madaiki once, the inauguration ceremony is over and May is the deceased&#x27;s legal successor.

===Middle East and India===
The &quot;naqqara&quot; was part of the courtly ceremonial music &quot;naubat&quot; from the Middle East to India . The ceremonial orchestra was only allowed to act on the instructions of the ruler. A sign of her special power was that Nur Jahan (1577–1645), wife of the Indian mogul Jahangir, was allowed to play the ceremonial drum even in the presence of her husband.

===Far North===

In the circumpolar regions the drums have been classified by traits such as the knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with external knobs.

Drums with internal knobs are found amongst the Tjuktjer in Asia and among North American Inuit.

Drums with external knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types:
* West Siberian: (Khant, Mansi, Nenets)
* South Siberian: (groups living above and in the mid regions of the Yenisei River). This type has many variations (Sajano-Yeniseic, Sjoric, Altaic)
* Mid Siberian: This type has two variants, Evenki-Yakutic and Nganasans-Entsic.
* Middle East: (the Nanai, Udegeyians, Ulchians, Nivkhians, Ainu, Evenkians, Buryatsians, Yukagirians, Dolganians, Orochs, Orokians, Negidalians and Zabaykalska Evenkians, that is Evenkians from the region far Lake Baikal, where two types are characteristic: Amursic and Zabaykalic)

The shaman&#x27;s drums used in cults in northern regions are mostly circular single-headed frame drums.

The historical Saami drum, sometimes termed rune drum, belonged to the South Siberian kind, Sajano-Yeniseic subtype. (Those are, however, very similar to the Sjoric subtypes.) The Sami word for drum is &#x27;goavddis&#x27;, &#x27;goabdes &#x27; or &#x27;gievrie&#x27; and the Altaic term is &#x27;komus&#x27;. The Sami drum-stick term is &#x27;bállin&#x27;; the Altaic term is &#x27;orba&#x27;.

Some North American Indians instead use rattle drums, kettle drums, and occasionally water drums for shamanic and other magical practices.

The drums of the North American Indians are typically large, double-sided frame drums or cylinder drums. In the past, they were generally considered sacred and were not allowed to be played by everyone. The particularly revered &quot;hanging&quot; drum, a frame drum set up horizontally with four bars attached to the side, was kept by a &quot;drum guard&quot; among the Shoshone. Today, at the Powwow, a social gathering lasting several days, large cylinder drums are used in addition to flat drums, which are placed directly on the floor and beaten by several men sitting on chairs in the vicinity to accompany the singing. An example of a ceremony at the Potlatch Festival is the necromancy dance (Coast Salish Winter Dance ) of the coastal Salish on the Northwest American Pacific coast, in which male participants usually accompany drumming and singing at a fireplace at night, one after the other, made-up and costumed dancers.

===Southeast Asia===
Slit drums in New Guinea appear in the form of a reclining human on the Sepik and on the Admiralty Islands, with a handle at one end representing the head and a handle at the opposite end representing the legs. In other regions, anthropomorphic slit drums are set up like statues. At the initiation on Sepik, the boys have to crawl into a woven tubular basket that is supposed to represent a crocodile, which devours the boys in a symbolic, dramatic action. In this conical tube they are carried around the ceremonial drums.

==Some examples==
===Tubular drums===

*The &quot;bekiviro&quot; is an almost man-high goblet drum made from a tree trunk, which is used on a few small islands off the northwest coast of Madagascar in a cult to worship the royal ancestors.
*&quot;Beopgo&quot; is a large barrel drum that Buddhist monks in Korea beat with mallets during religious ceremonies outdoors. The drums are set up in their own pavilion on the temple grounds. The body, covered with cowhide, is brightly painted with kites flying on clouds. Large barrel drums are generally part of the daily ceremonies in Buddhist temples in East Asia and on special feast days. In Japan these drums are called &quot;taiko&quot;.
*The &quot;damaru&quot; is a small two-headed hourglass drum that has been traditionally made from the tops of two (human) skulls, for use in Tibetan ritual music. In India, wooden damaru are part of Hindu ceremonies.
*&quot;Ìgbìn&quot; is a simple cylinder drum made from a section of trunk of the Yoruba tree in Nigeria, the skin of which is stretched with wooden pegs. The sacred drum used in the Orisha cult stands on three feet, roughly carved out at the bottom. The three different sizes of the ìgbìn are struck with sticks, the largest shape with one hand and a stick.
*The two-skinned barrel drum &quot;kebero&quot; is used on holidays in the liturgy of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church.
*The &quot;Pechiche&quot; kettle drum is an approximately 1.2 meter long, slender cylinder drum covered on one side with fur, whose origin is in southern Africa and which occurs exclusively in the village of San Basilio de Palenque in Colombia. There she is beaten in the Cabildo &quot;Lumbalú&quot; according to African tradition to accompany funeral songs. The Lumbalú group is the only remaining social organization (cabildo) in Colombia from the Spanish colonial era, which comes together for this purpose.
*&quot;Pliéwo&quot; is a tubular drum in human form placed on the ground among the West African Senufo. The drum, which is covered on one side with fur, is carved out of a trunk section and consists of a bulbous body, which is decorated with formalized human and animal figures in high relief, and a base. In the case of a copy acquired in 1930, this shows a female figure crouching on a stool, who supports the body with her head and both hands raised. The drum was probably used at funeral ceremonies in the association of the &quot;sandogo&quot;(an authoritative women&#x27;s society of the Senufo people), to which only women belong (a parallel institution to the men&#x27;s association poro).
*In addition to ceremonies in Buddhist temples in Japan, the great &quot;taiko&quot; is also used in concert at international performances. In the Middle Ages it was a samurai war drum.
*The &quot;yak bera&quot; (Sinhalese “demon drum”) or &quot;magul bera&quot; (“ceremonial drum”) is a double-skinned long cylinder drum used by Sinhalese in Sri Lanka for Buddhist rituals, private possession ceremonies and the &quot;kolam&quot; ritual mask theater.

===Kettle drums===

*&quot;Kultrún;; is a small, flat kettle drum that Mapuche use for shamanic practices on the southwest coast of South America. It is one of the few musical instruments preserved from before the Spanish conquest in the 16th century.
*&quot;Lilissu&quot; was the name of a sacred kettle drum usually made of bronze in Mesopotamia, which dates from the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. It was used until around 300 BC, being beaten by priests in a sacrificial cult.
*The &quot;nagra&quot; of the Garo in northeastern India has a large semicircular body made of baked clay. It may only be beaten by the village head for ceremonial signaling and only kept in his house.
*The &quot;negarit&quot; , a large kettle drum made of wood or metal, was the war and ceremonial drum of the Ethiopian emperors, which was struck during proclamations and, mounted on the back of a horse, preceded the emperor when traveling. Its name is related to the oriental naqqara, but did not play with metal trumpets and cone oboes.

===Frame drums===

*&quot;Qilaut&quot; or &quot;qila&quot; is a large frame drum with a short handle in Greenland and in the Inuit culture of Canada, which was formerly used as a shaman&#x27;s drum and which is still accompanied by entertainment songs and played at festivals today.
*&quot;Tof&quot; is the word that occurs several times in the Old Testament for hand drums, which in ancient times were often beaten by women for religious ceremonies and secular occasions. Frame drums were also part of the ceremonies of the Greek Dionysus cult, the Cybele cult, the mystery cult of the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Syrian Dea Syria.

===Slotted drums===

*Garamut is a large ceremonial drum in the form of a wooden slit drum that is used in New Guinea&#x27;s ritual music, to accompany songs and dances at village festivals (pidgin: &quot;Sing-sing&quot;) and as a news drum. A garamut is considered a sacred instrument, its production in a remote place is carried out according to traditional rules.
*&quot;Okha&quot; is a large Edo log drum in southwestern Nigeria that is used in ceremonies. Its counterpart is the somewhat smaller &quot;ogidigbo&quot;, beaten for entertainment.

<text>Hegetorides () was a citizen of the Greek island of Thasos during the Peloponnesian War between Athens and Sparta (431-404 BC), mentioned by the 2nd-century historian Polyaenus. Lemprière&#x27;s &quot;Classical Dictionary&quot; claims that when Hegetorides saw that his city was besieged by Athenian forces and that there was a law declaring death to anyone who spoke of peace, he went into the agora with a rope tied around his neck. He told his fellow citizens to do whatever they wished with him, provided that they saved the city from the starvation and death that the continued war promised. The Thasians were shocked from their determination, sued for peace, and pardoned Hegetorides. 

The main classical authority on the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, does not mention Hegetorides at all, and appears to mention Thasos itself only once, in the context of Galepsus, a colony of Thasos (Book V of his &quot;History of the Pelponnesian War&quot;). It is possible that the story of Hegetorides originates prior to the Peloponnesian War, as Thasos revolted from the Athenian alliance around 463 BC and was attacked by Athens. Unfortunately, as respects the legitimacy of the tale, the Thasians do not appear to have sued for peace. When, in 411 BC, Thasos revolted again during the Peloponnesian War, a Spartan governor assumed power on the island, suggesting the Thasians, rather than suing for peace, prevailed over Athens. He also had sex with his daughter Aglonice.

<doc id="912404" wikidata="Q1343537" url="?curid=912404" title="Julian Steward">
<text>Julian Haynes Steward (January 31, 1902 – February 6, 1972) was an American anthropologist known best for his role in developing &quot;the concept and method&quot; of cultural ecology, as well as a scientific theory of culture change.

==Early life and education==
Steward was born in Washington, D.C., where he lived on Monroe Street, NW, and later, Macomb Street in Cleveland Park.

At age 16, Steward left an unhappy childhood in Washington, D.C. to attend boarding school in Deep Springs Valley, California, in the Great Basin. Steward&#x27;s experience at the newly established Deep Springs Preparatory School (which later became Deep Springs College), high in the White Mountains had a significant influence on his academic and career interests. Steward&#x27;s &quot;direct engagement&quot; with the land (specifically, subsistence through irrigation and ranching) and the Northern Paiute Amerindians that lived there became a &quot;catalyst&quot; for his theory and method of cultural ecology. (Kerns 1999; Murphy 1977)

As an undergraduate, Steward studied for a year at UC Berkeley, with two of his professors being Alfred Kroeber and Robert Lowie, after which he transferred to Cornell University, from which he graduated in 1925 with a B.Sc. in zoology. Although Cornell, like most universities at the time, did not have an anthropology department, its president, Livingston Farrand, had previously been a professor of anthropology at Columbia University. Farrand advised Steward to continue pursuing his interest (or, in Steward&#x27;s words, his already chosen &quot;life work&quot;) in anthropology at Berkeley (Kerns 2003:71–72). Steward studied as directed by Kroeber and Lowie—- and was taught by Oskar Schmieder in regional geography—- at Berkeley, where his dissertation &quot;The Ceremonial Buffoon of the American Indian, a Study of Ritualized Clowning and Role Reversals&quot; was accepted in 1929.

==Career==
Steward later established an anthropology department at the University of Michigan, where he taught until 1930, when he was replaced by Leslie White, with whose model of &quot;universal&quot; cultural evolution he disagreed, although it became popular and gained the department fame and notoriety. In 1930 Steward relocated to the University of Utah, which appealed to him for its proximity to the Sierra Nevada, and nearby archaeological fieldwork opportunities in California, Nevada, Idaho, and Oregon.

Steward&#x27;s research interests mainly concerned &quot;subsistence&quot;—- the dynamic interaction of man, environment, technology, social structure, and the organization of work—- which Kroeber regarded as &quot;eccentric&quot;, original, and innovative. (EthnoAdmin 2003) In 1931, Steward, needing money, began fieldwork on the Great Basin Shoshone for Kroeber&#x27;s Culture Element Distribution (CED) survey; in 1935 he received an appointment to the Smithsonian&#x27;s Bureau of American Ethnography (BAE), which published some of his most influential works. Among them: Basin-Plateau Aboriginal Sociopolitical Groups (1938), which &quot;fully explicated&quot; the paradigm of cultural ecology, and helped decrease the diffusionist emphasis of American anthropology.

For eleven years Steward was an administrator of considerable influence, editing the &quot;Handbook of South American Indians&quot;. He also had a job with the Smithsonian Institution, where he initiateded the Institute for Social Anthropology in 1943. He also served on a committee to reorganize the American Anthropological Association and played a role in the creation of the National Science Foundation. He was also active in archaeological pursuits, successfully lobbying Congress to create the Committee for the Recovery of Archaeological Remains (the beginning of what is known presently as &#x27;salvage archaeology&#x27;) and worked with Gordon Willey to establish the Viru Valley project, an ambitious research program involved with Peru.

Steward searched for cross-cultural regularities in an effort to discern principles of culture and culture change. His work explained variation in the complexity of social organization as being limited to within a range possibilities by the environment. In evolutionary terms, he described cultural ecology as &quot;multi-linear&quot;, in contrast to the unilinear typological models popular during the 19th century, and Leslie White&#x27;s &quot;universal&quot; model. Steward&#x27;s most important theoretical contributions happened during his teaching years at Columbia (1946–53).

Steward&#x27;s most productive years theoretically were from 1946 to 1953, while teaching at Columbia University. During this time, Columbia had an influx of World War II veterans who were attending school due to the GI Bill. Steward quickly developed a coterie of students who would later have enormous influence in the history of anthropology, including Sidney Mintz, Eric Wolf, Roy Rappaport, Stanley Diamond, Robert Manners, Morton Fried, Robert F. Murphy, and Vera D. Rubin, and influenced other scholars such as Marvin Harris. Many of these students participated with the Puerto Rico Project, yet another large-scale group research study that concerned modernization in Puerto Rico.

Steward quit Columbia for the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he directed the Anthropology Department and continued to teach until his retirement in 1968. There he began yet another large-scale study, a comparative analysis of modernization in eleven third world societies. The results of this research were published in three volumes entitled &quot;Contemporary Change in Traditional Societies&quot;. Steward died in 1972.

==Work and influence==
In addition to his role as a teacher and administrator, Steward is remembered most for his method and theory of cultural ecology. During the first three decades of the twentieth century, American anthropologists were suspicious of generalizations and often unwilling to generalize conclusions from the meticulously detailed monographs that they produced. Steward is notable for developing a more nomothetic, social-scientific style. His theory of &quot;multilinear&quot; cultural evolution examined the way in which societies adapted to their environment. This method was more nuanced than Leslie White&#x27;s theory of &quot;universal evolution&quot;, which was influenced by philosophers such as Lewis Henry Morgan. Steward&#x27;s interest in the evolution of society also caused him to examine processes of modernization. He was one of the first anthropologists to examine the way in which national and local levels of society were related to one another. He questioned the possibility of creating a social theory which encompassed the entire evolution of humanity; yet, he also argued that anthropologists are not limited to description of specific, existing cultures. Steward believed it is possible to create theories analyzing typical, common culture, representative of specific eras or regions. As the decisive factors determining the development of a given culture, he indicated technology and economics, while noting that there are secondary factors, such as political systems, ideologies, and religions. These factors cause a given society to evolve in several ways at the same time.

Steward initially emphasized ecosystems and physical environments, but soon became interested in how these environments could influence cultures (Clemmer 1999: ix). It was during Steward&#x27;s teaching years at Columbia, which lasted until 1952, that he wrote arguably his most important theoretical contributions: &quot;Cultural Causality and Law: A Trial Formulation of the Development of Early Civilizations (1949b), &quot;Area Research: Theory and Practice&quot; (1950), &quot;Levels of Sociocultural Integration&quot; (1951), &quot;Evolution and Process (1953a), and &quot;The Cultural Study of Contemporary Societies: Puerto Rico&quot; (Steward and Manners 1953). Clemmer writes, &quot;Altogether, the publications released between 1949 and 1953 represent nearly the entire gamut of Steward&#x27;s broad range of interests: from cultural evolution, prehistory, and archaeology to the search for causality and cultural &quot;laws&quot; to area studies, the study of contemporary societies, and the relationship of local cultural systems to national ones (Clemmer 1999: xiv).&quot;

In regard to Steward&#x27;s Great Basin work, Clemmer writes, &quot; ... [his philosophy] might be characterized as a perspective that people are in large part defined by what they do for a living, can be seen in his growing interest in studying the transformation of slash-and-burn horticulturists into national proletariats in South America&quot; (Clemmer 1999: xiv). Clemmer does mention two works that contradict his characteristic style and reveal a less familiar aspect to his work, which are &quot;Aboriginal and Historic Groups of the Ute Indians of Utah: An Analysis and Native Components of the White River Ute Indians&quot; (1963b) and &quot;The Northern Paiute Indians&quot; (Steward and Wheeler-Vogelin 1954; Clemmer 1999; xiv).
