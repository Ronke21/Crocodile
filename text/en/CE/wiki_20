<text>Douglas Corrigan (born Clyde Groce Corrigan; January 22, 1907 – December 9, 1995) was an American aviator, nicknamed &quot;Wrong Way&quot; in 1938. After a transcontinental flight in July from Long Beach, California, to New York City, he then flew from Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn to Ireland, although his flight plan was filed to return to Long Beach.

Corrigan claimed his unauthorized transatlantic flight was due to a navigational error, caused by heavy cloud cover that obscured landmarks and low-light conditions, causing him to misread his compass. However, he was a skilled aircraft mechanic (he helped construct Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;) and had made several modifications to his own plane, preparing it for his transatlantic flight. He had been denied permission to make a nonstop flight from New York to Ireland, and his &quot;navigational error&quot; was seen as deliberate. Nevertheless, he never publicly admitted to having flown to Ireland intentionally.

==Early life==
Clyde Groce Corrigan was named for his father, a construction engineer; his mother was a teacher. As an adult, he changed his name to Douglas. Born in Galveston, Texas, Corrigan was of Irish descent. The family moved often and his parents finally divorced, sharing custody of their children. Corrigan eventually settled with his mother, brother Harry, and sister Evelyn in Los Angeles. Quitting high school before graduation, he went to work in construction.

In October 1925, eighteen-year-old Corrigan saw people paying to be taken for short rides in a Curtiss JN-4 &quot;Jenny&quot; biplane near his home. He paid $2.50 () for his own ride. A week later, he began flying lessons, spending non-flying time watching and learning from local aircraft mechanics. After twenty lessons, he made his first solo flight on March 25, 1926.

==Aircraft mechanic==
Ryan Aeronautical Company operated from the airfield where Corrigan learned to fly, and hired him for their San Diego factory in 1926. Corrigan was responsible for assembling the wing and installing the fuel tanks and instrument panel of Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;. Corrigan and his colleague Dan Burnett increased the lift of the aircraft by extending the wing longer than any previous Ryan design. Corrigan pulled the chocks from the &quot;Spirit of St Louis&quot; when Lindbergh took off from San Diego to New York to prepare for his historic flight.

After Lindbergh&#x27;s success in May 1927, Corrigan decided to duplicate it and selected Ireland as his objective. He discussed the idea with friends and mentioned flying without permission. When Ryan Aeronautical moved to St. Louis in October 1928, Corrigan stayed in San Diego as a mechanic for the newly formed Airtech School. With more than fifty students flying each day, Corrigan could get flight time only during his lunch break.

During his short flights, Corrigan performed aerobatic stunts. His favorite maneuver was the chandelle, in strings of up to a dozen, spiralling from close to the ground. The company disapproved and prohibited him from performing stunts in the company aircraft. Corrigan simply flew to a field farther south where his stunts could not be seen by his employers.

Corrigan moved from job to job as an aircraft mechanic, using his employers&#x27; planes to develop his flying skills. He gained his transport pilot certificate in October 1929, and started a passenger service in 1930 with his friend Steve Reich, flying between small East Coast towns. The most lucrative part of the business turned out to be barnstorming displays promoting short recreational plane rides. Despite business success, Corrigan decided to return to California after a few years. In 1933, he spent $310 () on a used 1929 Curtiss Robin OX-5 monoplane and flew it home, where he again worked as an aircraft mechanic, and began to modify the Robin for a transatlantic flight.

==Transatlantic flier==

Having installed an engine built from two old Wright Whirlwind J6-5 engines (affording instead of the of the original) and extra fuel tanks, Corrigan applied to the Bureau of Air Commerce in 1935, seeking permission to make a nonstop flight from New York to Ireland. The application was rejected; his plane was deemed unsound for a nonstop transatlantic trip, although it was certified to the lower standard for cross-country journeys.

Over the next two years, Corrigan made repeated modifications and reapplications for full certification, but none succeeded. Indeed, by 1937, after extensive modifications in the face of increasing regulation, his aircraft was refused renewal of its license because it was deemed to be too unstable for safe flight. His autobiography expresses his exasperation with official resistance and he is widely thought to have responded by deciding that year to make an unofficial crossing.

Although he never admitted it, he apparently planned a late arrival at New York so that he could refill his tanks and leave for Ireland after airport officials had gone home from work. Mechanical problems extended his unapproved flight to nine days, which delayed him beyond the Atlantic &quot;safe weather window&quot;, and he returned to California. As a result of this trip, he named his plane &quot;Sunshine&quot;. However, federal officials notified Californian airfield officials that &quot;Sunshine&quot; was not airworthy and it was grounded for six months.

On July 9, 1938, Corrigan again left California for Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn, New York. He had repaired the engine, taking his total spent on the aircraft to about $900 (), gained an experimental license, and obtained permission for a transcontinental flight with conditional consent for a return trip. With the Robin cruising at for maximum fuel efficiency, the eastbound journey took him 27 hours. Fuel efficiency became critical toward the end of the flight, and a gasoline leak developed, filling the cockpit with fumes.

Upon his unannounced arrival at Floyd Bennett Field, in the midst of Howard Hughes&#x27; preparations for departure on a world tour, Corrigan decided repairing the leak would take too long if he was to meet his schedule. His logged flight plan had him returning to California on July 17. Before takeoff, Corrigan asked the manager of Floyd Bennett Field, Kenneth P. Behr, which runway to use, and Behr told him to use any runway as long as he didn&#x27;t take off to the west, in the direction of the administration building where Behr had his office. As recorded in Corrigan&#x27;s autobiography, Behr wished him &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; prior to takeoff, perhaps in a nod to Corrigan&#x27;s intentions to fly the Atlantic. Upon takeoff at 0515 with of gasoline and of oil, Corrigan made a straight-out departure from the runway 06, and kept going east. (Behr later swore publicly he had no foreknowledge of Corrigan&#x27;s intentions.)

Corrigan claimed to have noticed his &quot;error&quot; after flying for about 26 hours. This is not entirely consistent with his claim that after 10 hours, he felt his feet go cold; the cockpit floor was awash with gasoline leaking from the unrepaired tank. He used a screwdriver to punch a hole through the cockpit floor so that the fuel would drain away on the side opposite the hot exhaust pipe, reducing the risk of a midair explosion. Had he been truly unaware he was over ocean, it seems likely he would have descended at this point; instead, he claimed to have increased the engine speed by almost 20% in the hope of decreasing his flight time.

He landed at Baldonnel Aerodrome, County Dublin, on July 18, after flying 28:13 hrs. His provisions had been two chocolate bars, two boxes of fig bars, and a quart of water.

Corrigan&#x27;s plane had fuel tanks mounted ahead of his position, allowing him to see only out of the sides. He had no radio and his compass was 20 years old. The journalist H. R. Knickerbocker, who met Corrigan in Ireland after his arrival, wrote in 1941:


Aviation officials sent a 600-word telegram to list the regulations broken by his flight (in a medium that encourages brevity by charging at a rate per word). Despite the extent of Corrigan&#x27;s illegality, he received only a mild punishment; his pilot&#x27;s certificate was suspended for 14 days. He and his plane returned to New York on the steamship &quot;Manhattan&quot; and arrived on August 4, the last day of his suspension. His return was marked with great celebration. More people attended his Broadway ticker-tape parade than had honored Lindbergh after his triumph. He was also given a ticker tape parade in Chicago. Later he met with United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House.

He appeared as a contestant on the July 16, 1957 episode of the United States television panel show &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.

==Later life==

Corrigan wrote his autobiography, &quot;That&#x27;s My Story&quot;, within months of the flight; it was published for the Christmas market on 15 December 1938. He also endorsed &#x27;wrong-way&#x27; products including a wristwatch that ran counter-clockwise. The following year (1939), he portrayed himself in RKO Radio Pictures&#x27; movie biography &quot;The Flying Irishman&quot;. The $75,000 (equal to $ today) he earned from that movie role was the equivalent of 30 years&#x27; income at his airfield jobs. Although he did not immediately acknowledge the accomplishment, Charles Lindbergh wrote a friendly four-page handwritten letter to Corrigan in 1939 after Corrigan sent him a copy of the autobiography.

According to a letter written to a fan in 1940, Corrigan said he had &quot;no hobbies except working on airplanes or machinery&quot;. When the United States entered World War II, he tested bombers and flew in the Ferry Command, a division of the Air Transport Command. In 1946, he gained less than 2% of the vote running for the U.S. Senate in California as a member of the Prohibition Party, running against Republican William F. Knowland. He then worked as a commercial pilot for a small California airline.

Corrigan retired from aviation in 1950 and bought an orange grove in Santa Ana, California. He lived there with his wife and three sons for the remainder of his life. He knew nothing about raising oranges, and said he learned by copying his neighbors. His wife died in 1966, and Corrigan sold most of his grove for development, keeping only the ranch-style house. One of the streets in the 93-house estate is named after him. He became reclusive after one of his sons died in a private plane crash on Santa Catalina Island in 1972. In 1988, however, he joined in the golden anniversary celebration of his famous &quot;wrong way&quot; flight, allowing enthusiasts to retrieve the Robin from its hangar. The plane was reassembled and the engine was run successfully. Corrigan was so excited that the organizers placed guards at the plane&#x27;s wings while he was at the show and considered tethering the tail to a police car to prevent him from taking off in it. Later, Corrigan became elusive about the plane&#x27;s location. It was rumored he had dismantled and stored it in several locations to prevent its theft.

An anthology of aircraft-related mysteries published in 1995 claimed that Corrigan was elected an Honorary Member of the &#x27;Liars Club of America&#x27; at the age of 84, and that the &#x27;honor,&#x27; (as had so many other suggestions over the years since his transatlantic flight) had been politely but firmly refused. Up to his death on December 9, 1995, Corrigan still maintained that he had made his transatlantic flight by accident.

In October 2019, Corrigan&#x27;s Curtiss Robin was delivered to the Planes of Fame Air Museum in Chino, California, where it remains on display (although in a disassembled state).

==In popular culture==
Corrigan&#x27;s &quot;error&quot; caught the imagination of the depressed American public and inspired many jokes. The nickname &quot;&#x27;Wrong Way&#x27; Corrigan&quot; passed into common use (sometimes confused with the memory of 1929&#x27;s &quot;Wrong Way&quot; Riegels football incident) and was mentioned (or used as satire) when someone had the reputation for taking the wrong direction.

==Legacy==
Among aviation historians, Corrigan is remembered as one of the brave few who made early transoceanic flights.

<text>S&amp;M Airlines is the second studio album by the American punk rock band NOFX. It was released on September 5, 1989, through Epitaph Records. It was also the group&#x27;s first release on Epitaph. A music video was made for the title track. The album was recorded and mixed in only six days at Westbeach Recorders. Bad Religion&#x27;s Greg Graffin and Brett Gurewitz (who also produced the album and is the founder of Epitaph) appear on the final track, a cover of the Fleetwood Mac song &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;. They also did harmonies on a few other songs. Bassist/singer, Fat Mike considers it to be the first real NOFX album. It was heavily inspired by Bad Religion and Rich Kids on LSD, and showed the band moving more towards a melodic and metallic sound. The album sold 3,500 copies upon its release.

<text>Enwave Energy Corporation is a Canadian multinational energy company based in Toronto that focuses on sustainable district energy including heating, cooling, hot water, combined heat and power, and geothermal energy systems. It is one of the largest district energy systems in North America and has been referred as the leading energy district system with 17 heating plants, 21 chilled water plants and ice on coil storage tanks. It serves over 700 customers including commercial properties, developers, municipalities, health care, educational centres and residential units.

==History==
The company was originally established as the Toronto Hospitals Steam Corporation in 1969 to provide heating services for the Toronto General Hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, New Mount Sinai Hospital and Women&#x27;s College Hospital, and later provided these services to other medical institutions, the University of Toronto and the provincial government. It was renamed as the Toronto District Heating Corporation in 1980, at which time it acquired the steam utility that was also being operated by Toronto Hydro.

The corporation was privatized in 1998, with shares going to the province, the municipal government of Toronto, the University of Toronto and the four founding hospitals. The corporation was renamed as Enwave in 1999. Over time, only two shareholders remained: the city with 43%, and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System with 57%.

On October 2, 2012, Toronto City Council voted to sell its 43% stake in Enwave. This followed an announcement that Brookfield Asset Management would acquire the entire company through a partnership.

== Notable projects ==

===Deep Lake Water Cooling System===

Enwave&#x27;s Deep Lake Water Cooling (DLWC) is a system that harnesses the cold temperature at the bottom of Lake Ontario to cool hospitals, data centers, educational campuses, government buildings, commercial and residential buildings. Some customers include Toronto-Dominion Centre, Royal Bank Plaza, RBC Centre, Metro Toronto Convention Centre and Scotiabank Arena.

It utilizes three large pipes have been run into Lake Ontario, to a depth of 83 metres. The water at that depth is a constant 4 °C, its temperature protected by a layer of water above it, called a thermocline. The water is piped to a filtration plant and then to a heat-transfer station on the lakeside. Here the chill is “transferred” to another closed loop, consisting of smaller pipes that supply the towers of the city&#x27;s financial district. Built at a cost of C$230m ($200m) over four years, the system is run by the Enwave Energy Corporation.

The cooling system is a clean, renewable, and reliable energy source. Compared to traditional air-conditioning, Deep Lake Water Cooling reduces electricity use by 75%, and will eliminate 40,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of taking 8,000 cars off the streets.

Enwave draws cold water () from a depth of below the surface of Lake Ontario. Cold lake water is pumped through the source side of heat exchangers situated at Toronto&#x27;s John Street Pumping Station while a glycol and water mixture is circulated through the load circuit of the heat exchanger, allowing for a net energy transfer from the water/glycol mixture to the lake water. The chiller glycol mixture is then circulated using pumps throughout fan-coil units installed in high-rise properties throughout the region served by Enwave in Downtown Toronto where is absorbs energy and repeats the cycle to provide cooling and dehumidification. This system is advantageous since it reduces, or even completely eradicates chiller usage during summer months and shoulder seasons, reducing energy usage, as well as minimizing the number of evaporative cooling towers from operating, which are susceptible to becoming breeding grounds for Legionella pneumophila.

This system was officially launched on August 17, 2004, at Steam Whistle Brewing, one of Enwave&#x27;s customers. In support of Deep Lake Water Cooling (DLWC), the launch was attended by actor and renewable energy activist Alec Baldwin, Ontario Minister of Energy Dwight Duncan, Canadian Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development Joe Volpe, and Toronto Deputy Mayor Sandra Bussin, among other business leaders and government officials. The launch coincided with the anniversary of the 2003 blackout.

=== DLWC Expansion ===
In 2019, Enwave announced a C$100 million system expansion with C$10 million in federal funding from the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change&#x27;s Low Carbon Economy Challenge.

The expansion of the DLWC supply could reduce demand on the electricity grid during peak times by up to 0.5 kW per ton of cooling load delivered, resulting in up to 70% peak demand savings in electricity compared to a mechanical chiller plant. The expansion will increase the capacity of the District Heat Recovery System, which produces up to 93% less carbon emissions compared to traditional heating technology.

=== London CHP II ===
Enwave&#x27;s London Energy Plant has of steam pipes, of chilled water pipes and has recently invested 50 million dollars to supply power to the provincial electricity grid through London&#x27;s local grid.

In 2019, the Province of Ontario funded the system to expand and include an additional combined heat and power (CHP) system, 17 MW gas turbine, 4 MW condensing steam turbine, 1,451 metric tons of electric chillers. London Energy Plant now serves 60 customers, including St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Care London.

=== The Well ===
The Well is a visionary mixed-use development featuring more than 3 million square feet of retail, office and residential space. Enwave designed and installed a new state-of-the-art thermal storage facility underneath The Well, consisting of a large temperature-controlled tank. The tank is fed by the DLWC system and has the capacity to hold 2 million gallons (7.6 million liters) of water. As a thermal “battery,” the ingenious system can store energy at night during off-peak times, easing strain on the electricity grid and reducing costs. The system is efficient, resilient, and, with greater capacity, can now supply low-carbon heating and cooling to an additional 17 million square feet of space.

=== Prince Edward Island ===
With Federal support, Enwave is pursuing a project on Prince Edward Island which will divert an additional 23,000 tonnes of waste from landfill to generate energy, thus reducing harmful methane emissions. The federal government is contributing $3.5 million to upgrade and expand a 35-year-old waste-to-energy system in Charlottetown. The upgrade will include a larger furnace, the addition of a heat recovery boiler and air pollution controls.

Through the life of the project it could, on average, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 75,000 tonnes a year.

=== New Orleans ===
In 2005, hurricanes Katrina and Rita devastated homes, businesses, and critical infrastructure in New Orleans. Electrical substations were flooded and the city lost power for several weeks. Throughout the disaster, Enwave&#x27;s district energy plant, maintained service to Louisiana&#x27;s largest health care and medical research center. As the only functioning facility with power and cooling, it also served as a hub for FEMA workers. Louisiana State University subsequently commissioned Enwave to design, build and operate a future-proof system with the same level of reliability and redundancy to provide critical medical services through a disaster. The plant is designed to be failproof: built to withstand hurricane-force winds and a 20-foot storm surge, with all critical equipment located 20 feet above grade. It also features emergency backup generation and an innovative 55,000 ton-hour “ice battery” to store energy, allowing the plant to operate for seven full days off-grid in the event of a disaster. After hurricane Katrina, Enwave expanded its service in New Orleans beyond the medical district. Enwave constructed a new steam plant in 2014 to serve an additional 22 buildings in the business core. Its three 70,000-lb/hr natural gasfired boilers produce steam for distribution to 22 buildings totaling 4.1 million sq ft for space heating, domestic hot water, laundry and sterilization use. Construction of the $28 million steam plant was completed on budget and two months ahead of schedule. The plant won the DBIA National Award of Merit and the ENR Best Projects for Texas and Louisiana Award of Merit.

== Sustainability ==
Enwave also helped solidify LEED certification applications for its customers. Enwave customers One York Street in Toronto achieved LEED Platinum certification, and in Chicago Aon Center holds a LEED Silver certification.

The United Nations initiative called “United 4 Sustainable Smart Cities” published a study titled “Deep Lake Water Cooling: its origins and the next evolution” about Enwave&#x27;s DLWC system. The study speaks of the origins of Deep Lake Water Cooling, Enwave&#x27;s current impact, plans for a 4th intake, integration of thermal storage at The Well, and how Enwave is integrating heat pumps to create a community energy sharing network at scale to provide resilient, low carbon heating and cooling.

<doc id="909869" wikidata="Q427958" url="?curid=909869" title="Battle of Sinop">
<text>The Battle of Sinop, or the Battle of Sinope, was a naval battle that took place on 30 November 1853 between Imperial Russia and the Ottoman Empire during the opening phase of the Crimean War (1853–1856). It took place at Sinop, a sea port on the southern shore of the Black Sea (the northern shore of Anatolian Turkey). A Russian squadron attacked and decisively defeated an Ottoman squadron anchored in Sinop&#x27;s harbor. The Russian force consisted of six ships of the line, two frigates and three armed steamers, led by Admiral Pavel Nakhimov; the Ottoman defenders were seven frigates, three corvettes and two armed steamers, commanded by Vice Admiral Osman Pasha.

The Russian navy had recently adopted naval artillery that fired explosive shells, which gave them a decisive advantage in the battle. All the Ottoman frigates and corvettes were either sunk or forced to run aground to avoid destruction; only one steamer escaped. The Russians lost no ships. Nearly 3,000 Turks were killed when Nakhimov&#x27;s forces fired on the town after the battle. The victory is commemorated in Russia as one of the Days of Military Honour.

The one-sided battle contributed to the decision of France and Britain to enter the war, on the side of the Ottomans. The battle demonstrated the effectiveness of explosive shells against wooden hulls, and the superiority of shells over cannonballs. It led to widespread adoption of explosive naval artillery and indirectly to the development of ironclad warships.

==Prelude==
On 4 October 1853, around 2 months before the battle, in response to the Russian occupation of Moldavia and Wallachia (then part of the Ottoman Danube), the Ottoman Empire declared war on Russia. By the early 1850s the Ottoman Empire was deeply in debt and relied exclusively on British and French loans as a means of support. As a result, Ottoman leaders had no choice but to agree to drastic reductions in both army and navy force levels. Tsar Nicholas I saw the reductions as an opportunity to press Russian claims in the Trans-Caucasus and along the Danube River. In July 1853 Russian forces occupied several Ottoman principalities and forts along the Danube. Mediation of the disputes broke down, and Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid I responded with a declaration of war. Fearing Russian expansion, the United Kingdom and France issued a concurrent ultimatum: Russia was to fight only defensively. As long as Russia stayed on the defensive the Anglo-French would remain neutral, but if Russia acted &quot;aggressively&quot; the western powers reserved the right to get involved.

Hostilities began officially on 4 October, with a principal theater in Europe and another in the Caucasus. Sultan Abdulmecid ordered an immediate offensive to drive back the Russians and demonstrate Ottoman might before Ottoman finances totally collapsed. The offensive along the Danube met with mixed success, but the Ottoman land attack into the Russian Caucasus was relatively successful. By the end of October, the Russian Caucasus Corps was in danger of being surrounded. Turkish ships trafficking gunpowder to the Circassians were in contravention of the Straits Convention, which international law was sworn to uphold. The Russians told the Austrian Consul that they were legitimately entitled to seek redress for this act of piracy. Furthermore Russia claimed that two Customs House men had been murdered at Tiflis. The tsar needed no further incentive to react.

Despite the Ottoman declaration of war, the naval aspect was mostly uneventful until November, when the Vice Admiral Osman Pasha was forced to dock at Sinop during a storm on the Black Sea. To support the attack and properly supply his forces before significant snowfall, Sultan Abdulmecid ordered a squadron of frigates, steamers and transports to establish a supply corridor to the Ottoman army in Georgia. Osman Pasha, himself aboard the 60-gun &quot;Avni Illah&quot;, had been sailing with seven frigates, two corvettes and several transports to resupply the Turkish land forces.

Unable to interdict the convoy, Russian naval elements remained in Sevastopol. Abdulmecid ordered a second convoy commanded by Osman Pasha, but by this time it was late November and the fleet was forced to seek winter quarters. It ended up at Sinop, joining the frigate &quot;Kaid Zafer&quot; which had been part of an earlier patrol, and was joined by the steam frigate &quot;Taif&quot; from a smaller squadron. The Ottomans had wanted to send ships of the line to Sinop, but the British ambassador in Constantinople, Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe, had objected to this plan, and only frigates were sent.

Initial Ottoman activity in the Black Sea had been allowed to proceed unhindered, but as the situation of the Russian Caucasus Corps deteriorated, St. Petersburg was forced to act. Adm. Pavel Nakhimov was ordered to muster the Russian navy and interdict the Ottomans. From 1–23 November Russian squadrons were dispatched into the Black Sea to establish control. Two Ottoman steamers, the &quot;Medzhir Tadzhiret&quot; and the &quot;Pervaz Bahri&quot;, were captured by the Russians in short engagements. Russia was able to establish operational control of the sea lanes but storms forced Nakhimov to send back most of his force for repair. Left with only a frigate, a steamer and three ships of the line, Nakhimov continued the search for Osman and the convoy. On 23 November, Osman&#x27;s flag was sighted returning and then entering the harbor at Sinop. Nakhimov immediately deployed his ships to blockade the harbor and sent his only frigate to retrieve as many reinforcements as could be found.

On 30 November, Vice Admiral Fyodor Novosilski rallied six more ships to Nakhimov, completing the blockade force in a loose semi-circle. Additional steamers were expected, but Nakhimov decided to act before the Ottomans could be reinforced by additional ships. For his part, Osman had been well aware of the Russian presence since 23 November, but felt his ships were safe in harbor. Sinop had substantial harbor defenses and forts with interlocking fields of fire and ample cannon. Osman did little to break the weak Russian blockade, even allowing many of his crews to disembark.

==Battle==

Three Russian second-rate ships of the line (84 cannons each) led by Admiral Nakhimov arrived at Sinop on 23 November to discover the Turkish fleet in the harbor under the defence of the on-shore fortifications strengthened by cannons. Six Russian warships from Sevastopol under command of Vice Admiral Fyodor Novosilsky (including three 120-cannon first-rate ships of the line) joined Nakhimov on 28 November.

Admiral Nakhimov, was under orders from Alexander Sergeyevich Menshikov to destroy any Turkish ships carrying supplies to the Caucasus. His squadron included six modern battleships, two frigates, and three streamers, with the heavier guns armed with explosive shells, their first use in a sea battle. 

The Ottoman forces included seven frigates, three corvettes and two armed steamers. The Russians planned to deploy their ships in two columns that would advance to within close range of the enemy vessels before dropping anchor and opening fire. Under Nakhimov&#x27;s command, the 84-gun ship was the first to engage when she fired on the 44-gun Ottoman flagship &quot;Auni Allah&quot;.

On 30 November the Russian squadron entered the harbor from the northwest in a triangular formation. Nakhimov maneuvered his fleet so that the Ottoman vessels were between the Russian ships and Sinop&#x27;s harbor defenses, shielding his own force and exposing the Ottomans to potential friendly fire. Nakhimov spaced his battleships evenly in two lines, covering the entire harbor with interlocking fields of fire. Russian gunners began to score hits on all the Ottoman targets. The projectile shells fired for the first time from Russian guns immediately set the wooden Ottoman ships on fire. Panic-stricken sailors found firefighting efforts difficult amidst continued fire and almost constant shrapnel. After about 30 minutes of combat the Ottoman flag frigate &quot;Auni Allah&quot; was shot full of holes and ran aground when her anchor cable was cut. &quot;Imperatritsa Maria&quot; then attacked and disabled the 44-gun frigate &quot;Fazli Allah&quot;, which caught fire. Meanwhile, the other Russian ships damaged the &quot;Nizamie&quot; and &quot;Damiad&quot;. The Ottoman corvette &quot;Guli Sephid&quot; and frigate &quot;Navek Bakhri&quot; exploded.

Only one Ottoman vessel, the 12-gun paddle frigate , managed to escape the battle while all the others were either sunk or purposely run ashore to prevent sinking. She fled to Istanbul and arrived on 2 December, informing the Ottoman government and Admiral Stratford of the Royal Navy of the defeat at Sinop. Once the enemy fleet was destroyed the Russians engaged Ottoman shore batteries and destroyed them. During the fighting 37 Russians were killed and 229 were wounded, at least three of the ships of the line were damaged. 

Ottoman casualties included 2700 sailors killed of the 4200 present, while Sinope endured six days of bombardment.

==Aftermath==
When telegraph reports of the battle reached Russian authorities in St. Petersburg, the reaction was jubilant. The untested and widely hated Russian navy had proven victorious and the recent expenditure in its development seemed warranted. Several balls were held to celebrate the victory and a state-funded parade was held. The affair was rather grand, and included dancers, bands, parading troops who had not taken part in the battle and criminals dressed up in Ottoman uniforms. Military advisors saw the battle as a turning point and pushed for shell-firing guns to be installed on all Russian ships.

The reaction in the Ottoman capital of Constantinople ranged from concern to total panic. Russia had annihilated a vital convoy and now had operational control over the Black Sea. The destruction of the harbor defenses opened the door to Russian invasion and suddenly the entire Samsun and Trabzon Coast was now at risk. Moreover, the Russian violation of the British/French mandate for the war meant that the actions of Russia could no longer be predicted and Russia might not be fighting with one hand tied behind its back. 

According to Orlando Figes, the defeat led to diplomatic efforts by the Sublime Porte, with Mustafa Reşid Pasha making, &quot;one last effort to involve the Western powers in a settlement was needed if they were to be won over to the Turkish side in the event of a general war.&quot; On 22 December, the French and British agreed a combined Black Sea fleet would ensure protection of Turkish shipping.

&quot;She [Turkey] hears from all sides that the occupation of the Principalities by Russia constitutes a cause of war; and she has not only put herself into a state of respectable defence, but she has appealed with perfect success to the zeal of her Mussulmen and to the loyalty of her Christian subjects.&quot;

The attack was treated by external powers as unjustified and caused a wave of anti-Russian sentiment in western Europe. Much of the British press presented the attack as the &quot;Massacre of Sinope&quot;. The attack strengthened the pro-war factions in Britain and France, and provided them with the justification for a war to curb Russian bellicosity. Lord Palmerston temporarily resigned over the affair. By March 1854, however, war hawks in the National Government won out and Sinop was seen as a just cause for war, although ultimately the real motivation was to curb Russian expansion in accordance with a balance of power strategy. 
&quot;Turkey must be defended from aggression... It may be regarded as an intentional insult to the maritime powers...these ships were charged with provisions for Batoum and they have been destroyed in a Turkish harbour - which is Turkish territory - which England is bound to protect.&quot;

==Importance to naval warfare==
Sinop was presented by the media as not so much a battle but an ambush, but its results were nonetheless important to the practice of 19th-century warfare and the evolution of naval doctrine. Prior to Sinop the standard naval armament was the smooth-bore that fired cannonballs, shot, shrapnel, and other projectiles. Paixhans guns or regional equivalents were slowly being integrated into navies, but only the French, Russian and American navies had made a comprehensive effort. These batteries represented a clear evolution in naval technology that broke through the final ceiling of the Age of Sail. Unlike previous smooth-bore ordnance, Paixhans guns fired explosive shells and not mere metal projectiles. The shells themselves did both kinetic and explosive damage, causing fires. In addition, the new guns were heavier, could engage at a greater range, and possessed far greater penetrating power.

However, until 1853 no navy had made comprehensive use of shell-firing guns in a live combat environment. Indeed, many experts disparaged the new weapons and the larger ships required to carry them as too heavy for naval warfare. The results of Sinop were clear and showed that the new weapons were effective. As a result, an arms race ensued with participant nations desperately looking for ways to up-gun existing ships and incorporate the shell-firing guns into new ironclad vessels.

<doc id="909872" wikidata="Q4978170" url="?curid=909872" title="Bruce R. McConkie">
<text>Bruce Redd McConkie (July 29, 1915 – April 19, 1985) was a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) from 1972 until his death. McConkie was a member of the First Council of the Seventy of the LDS Church from 1946 until his calling to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.

During his time as a general authority, McConkie published several doctrinal books and articles and wrote the chapter headings of the LDS Church&#x27;s 1979–81 editions of the standard works.

McConkie received a Bachelor of Arts and Juris Doctor from the University of Utah. He spent his childhood between Monticello, Utah; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1937, he married Amelia Smith (1916–2005), a daughter of Joseph Fielding Smith, who would later become LDS Church president.

==Early years==
McConkie was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, to Oscar Walter McConkie and Margaret Vivian Redd. Before he was a year old, his family moved to Monticello, Utah. In 1925, his family moved back to Ann Arbor, where his father continued studying law and in 1926 they moved to Salt Lake City, Utah. McConkie attended Bryant Junior High School and LDS High School, where he graduated at 15. He attended three years of college at the University of Utah before he served a church mission.

McConkie followed his father&#x27;s preaching style and doctrinal views but differed from his father politically, as McConkie was a Republican, and his father was a Democrat.

==Eastern States Mission==
On September 6, 1934, McConkie received a call to serve in the Eastern States Mission, with Don B. Colton as his mission president. His first assignment was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. From May 1 to July 24, 1935, he served in the Cumorah District in Palmyra, New York, as part of an intensive missionary campaign tied to the dedication of a monument to Moroni on the Hill Cumorah. McConkie then served in the Seneca District and later presided over it.

In 1936, McConkie participated in the first Hill Cumorah Pageant, which was attended by his future father-in-law, Joseph Fielding Smith. At the end of his second year of missionary service, McConkie &quot;extended his mission for six weeks to travel, without a companion, from town to town throughout the mission, teaching investigators and missionaries,&quot; at the request of his mission president.

==Education, marriage, and family==

McConkie met Amelia Smith, daughter of Joseph Fielding Smith, before his mission while he was attending the University of Utah. He and Amelia graduated there in June 1937, he with a Bachelor of Arts degree and she with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in bacteriology and pathology. They were married in the Salt Lake Temple by Amelia&#x27;s father on October 13, 1937. Together, they had nine children: Bruce (1938-1938), Vivian (1940–2024), Joseph (1941–2013), Stanford (1944), Mary (1946–2021), Mark (1948–2018), Rebecca (1950), Stephen (1951), and Sara (1957). Their oldest child, Bruce, lived less than two months.

McConkie graduated with a bachelor of laws degree in 1939 and was third out of seventy-five on the Utah bar exam. His degree was automatically changed to juris doctor in June 1967. Following his graduation, McConkie worked as assistant city attorney in Salt Lake City.

==Military service==
McConkie enrolled in Army ROTC while at the University of Utah. With the advent of World War II, he was called to active duty service on March 5, 1942. He served in military intelligence at Fort Douglas for the duration of the war and received the American Campaign Medal and the World War II Victory Medal. He held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel at his discharge on February 26, 1946. He had been one of the youngest in Army Intelligence to hold that rank.

==Call to the Seventy==

McConkie worked for a time as a reporter for the &quot;Deseret News&quot;. While covering the proceedings of LDS general conference on October 6, 1946, McConkie was interviewed by apostle David O. McKay to fill a vacancy in the First Council of the Seventy created by the death of John H. Taylor. McConkie&#x27;s name was presented for a sustaining vote by the membership of the church that same day, and on October 10, he was ordained and set apart by George Albert Smith. He served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy for 26 years.

On June 11, 1961, McConkie was ordained a high priest by Henry D. Moyle of the church&#x27;s First Presidency. This was necessary because of a new policy requiring the First Seven Presidents of Seventy to assist the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in setting apart stake presidents, stake high councilors, and bishops.

==&quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot;==

In 1958, McConkie published a book, &quot;Mormon Doctrine: A Compendium of the Gospel&quot;, which he described as &quot;the first major attempt to digest, explain, and analyze all of the important doctrines of the kingdom&quot; and &quot;the first extensive compendium of the whole gospel—the first attempt to publish an encyclopedic commentary covering the whole field of revealed religion.&quot; He included a disclaimer that he alone was responsible for the doctrinal and scriptural interpretations, a practice then unusual.

In writing the book, McConkie relied heavily upon the church&#x27;s standard works and recognized doctrinal authorities. Church leaders were surprised by its publication since he had not asked permission and was not asked to develop such a work, and they responded that while they applauded the attempt of the book to fill a need, it used a harsh tone. Apostle Mark E. Petersen called it &quot;full of errors and misstatements, and it is most unfortunate that it has received such wide circulation.&quot; Church president David O. McKay asked McConkie not to reprint it, but later, McConkie was asked to revise it with the editorial help of Spencer W. Kimball. The 1966 second edition incorporated many changes, such as a softening of the tone.

While almost all of the &quot;Bible Dictionary&quot; included with the LDS Church&#x27;s publication of the Bible in 1979 borrows from the Cambridge University Press bible dictionary, modifications were made to some entries to reflect Mormon beliefs better, and &quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot; heavily influenced those changes.
&quot;Mormon Doctrine&quot; remained in print until 2010, when Deseret Book ceased publication, citing poor sales.

==Mission to Australia==
On February 9, 1961, McConkie was called to serve as president of the Southern Australian Mission, which encompassed all of western and southern Australia. Their daughter, Vivian, was married and son, Joseph, was serving a mission in Scotland, so six of their children accompanied them to Australia.

In October 1962, McConkie reported &quot;an all-time high mark in mission converts and willingness of members to build new chapels... There has been no difficulty getting six building missionaries to work on each chapel under the supervision of supervisors called from the states.&quot;

Under McConkie, the mission decided upon a motto of &quot;Seek the Spirit&quot;, and McConkie focused on teaching the missionaries humility and listening for the whisperings of the Holy Ghost.

McConkie resumed his duties as a President of the Seventy after returning to Utah in 1964.

==Memorial Estates Security Corporation==
In August 1960 McConkie, along with several other businessmen (including J. Thomas Fyans), formed the Memorial Estates Security Corporation (MESC), with a stated purpose of constructing memorial parks for deceased &quot;loved ones&quot;. McConkie became its vice president. By September 1964, the company was failing, and in November, MESC filed for bankruptcy. McConkie, along with fourteen other MESC officials were sued by 270 stockholders and bondholders of the company, accusing the company of prominently displaying LDS Church affiliation to imply endorsement in initial sales pitches. The suit also accused the company of failing to register as an investment company with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as required by law.

In a questionnaire sent to all investors, it was found that two thirds of all investors were elderly (ages 60–75), who had invested fifteen times as much as persons thirty years and under and four times as much as those in middle age. When asked why they contributed to the company, close to half mentioned trust in McConkie or other LDS Church leaders specifically. Further investigation showed that the company had failed to pay dividends long before its collapse, and failed to inform investors of its insolvency. The case was settled out of court on April 25, 1969, three days before going before a jury trial.

==Call to the Twelve==
Joseph Fielding Smith, McConkie&#x27;s father-in-law, who had been serving as church president, died on July 2, 1972. The First Presidency was subsequently reorganized with Harold B. Lee as president, leaving a vacancy in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. In October 1972, McConkie was invited to Lee&#x27;s office &quot;where President Lee put his arms around him by way of greeting and said, &#x27;The Lord and the Brethren have just called you to fill the vacancy in the Council of the Twelve.&#x27; Bruce responded, &#x27;I know. This is no surprise to me. I have known it for some time.&#x27;&quot;

McConkie served in the capacity of an apostle until he died of cancer at 69.

==Poetry==
McConkie wrote several poems, a few of which he read in various general conference addresses. He wrote the poem &quot;I Believe in Christ,&quot; which he delivered in a 1972 general conference address, &quot;The Testimony of Jesus.&quot; It was later set to music and was published in the LDS Hymnal as hymn number 134.

McConkie also wrote the fourth verse to &quot;Come, Listen to a Prophet&#x27;s Voice&quot; which is hymn #21 in the church&#x27;s 1985 hymnal.

==Final testimony==
McConkie gave many general conference addresses. His last conference address was in April 1985: &quot;The Purifying Power of Gethsemane.&quot; McConkie died in Salt Lake City less than two weeks later. He was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery.

==Critique==
McConkie&#x27;s works in general are characterized by their authoritative tone. McConkie once wrote to a Mormon scholar in 1980, &quot;It is my province to teach to the Church what the doctrine is. It is your province to echo what I say or to remain silent.&quot; In his bestselling &quot;Doctrinal New Testament Commentaries&quot; and &quot;Messiah&quot; series, the sources most frequently cited as authority are other works authored by himself. He explained, &quot;I would never quote another man unless I could first square what he said with the scriptures and unless he said what was involved better than I could.&quot;

McConkie comments about Jews in his book &quot;The Millennial Messiah&quot;: &quot;Let this fact be engraved in the eternal records with a pen of steel: the Jews were cursed, and smitten, and cursed anew, because they rejected the gospel, cast out their Messiah, and crucified their King.&quot;

McConkie states that the Jews&#x27; rejection of Jesus is the cause of historical persecution of the Jews: &quot;Let the spiritually illiterate suppose what they may, it was the Jewish denial and rejection of the Holy One of Israel, whom their fathers worshiped in the beauty of holiness, that has made them a hiss and a byword in all nations and that has taken millions of their fair sons and daughters to untimely graves.&quot;

One of the most controversial topics that McConkie defended in his writings was the church&#x27;s policy of denying the priesthood to men of African descent until 1978. His basis for this defense was that in his view, those of black African descent had been less valiant in the premortal life, which the LDS Church teaches was a precursor to life on earth. In 1958, McConkie wrote:

In the pre-existent eternity various degrees of valiance and devotion to the truth were exhibited by different groups of our Father&#x27;s spirit offspring. One-third of the spirit hosts of heaven came out in open rebellion and were cast out without bodies, becoming the devil and his angels. The other two-thirds stood affirmatively for Christ: there were no neutrals. To stand neutral in the midst of war is a philosophical impossibility.
Of the two-thirds who followed Christ, however, some were more valiant than others. Those who were less valiant in pre-existence and who thereby had certain spiritual restrictions imposed upon them during mortality are known to us as the negroes.
Negroes in this life are denied the priesthood; under no circumstances can they hold this delegation of authority from the Almighty.
The present status of the negro rests purely and simply on the foundation of pre-existence. Along with all races and peoples he is receiving here what he merits as a result of the long pre-mortal probation in the presence of the Lord. The principle is the same as will apply when all men are judged according to their mortal works and are awarded varying statuses in the life hereafter.

McConkie extended the analysis to conclude that God had established a caste system that proscribed intermarriage of other races with the &quot;negro race,&quot; which McConkie believed to be descended from Cain, the murderer of Abel: &quot;In a broad general sense, caste systems have their root and origin in the gospel itself, and when they operate according to the divine decree, the resultant restrictions and segregation are right and proper and have the approval of the Lord. To illustrate: Cain, Ham, and the whole negro race have been cursed with a black skin, the mark of Cain, so they can be identified as a caste apart, a people with whom the other descendants of Adam should not intermarry.”

On June 1, 1978, McConkie was present in the Salt Lake Temple when a revelation was received by the First Presidency and the Twelve &quot;that the time had now come to extend the gospel and all its blessings and all its obligations, including the priesthood and the blessings of the house of the Lord, to those of every nation, culture and race, including the black race.&quot; This revelation was announced on June 8, 1978.

McConkie&#x27;s earlier statements on the topic, like those of other church leaders, implied or stated that the priesthood restriction would never be lifted. McConkie addressed that by stating that his earlier statements should not be relied upon and that those who asked about them needed to &quot;forget&quot; what he had said:

There are statements in our literature by the early Brethren that we have interpreted to mean that the Negroes would not receive the priesthood in mortality. I have said the same things, and people write me letters and say, &quot;You said such and such, and how is it now that we do such and such?&quot; All I can say is that it is time disbelieving people repented and got in line and believed in a living, modern prophet. Forget everything that I have said, or what President Brigham Young or George Q. Cannon or whoever has said in days past that is contrary to the present revelation. We spoke with a limited understanding and without the light and knowledge that now has come into the world.

It doesn&#x27;t make a particle of difference what anybody ever said about the Negro matter before the first day of June 1978. It is a new day and a new arrangement, and the Lord has now given the revelation that sheds light out into the world on this subject. As to any slivers of light or any particles of darkness of the past, we forget about them. We now do what meridian Israel did when the Lord said the gospel should go to the Gentiles. We forget all the statements that limited the gospel to the house of Israel, and we start going to the Gentiles.

<doc id="909883" wikidata="Q5184866" url="?curid=909883" title="Cri-Cri (character)">
<text>Cri-Cri is a Mexican fictional character, an anthropomorphic cricket, created by Francisco Gabilondo Soler in 1934 while broadcasting his own musical radio show on Mexico&#x27;s station XEW.

== History ==

Cri-Cri is known as the “grillito cantor” or “the singing cricket.” He was created by Gabilondo Soler in his childhood and may even be considered “his inner personality.”

The character became so famous and gave its author such renown that it became a second name for Gabilondo. In the mid part of the 20th century, he became one of the most prominent children&#x27;s singers in Spanish.

== Legacy ==
Disney offered to animate one of Cri-Cri&#x27;s most popular songs &quot;Cochinitos Dormilones&quot; (Sleepy Piggies), and incorporated aspects of his own &quot;Three Little Pigs&quot; short into it. Walt Disney&#x27;s character of Jiminy Cricket may have been inspired by the famous Mexican character.

The character is the brand ambassador for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria.

<doc id="909888" wikidata="Q963731" url="?curid=909888" title="Semantics of logic">
<text>In logic, the semantics of logic or formal semantics is the study of the semantics, or interpretations, of formal languages and (idealizations of) natural languages usually trying to capture the pre-theoretic notion of logical consequence.

==Overview==
The truth conditions of various sentences we may encounter in arguments will depend upon their meaning, and so logicians cannot completely avoid the need to provide some treatment of the meaning of these sentences. The semantics of logic refers to the approaches that logicians have introduced to understand and determine that part of meaning in which they are interested; the logician traditionally is not interested in the sentence as uttered but in the proposition, an idealised sentence suitable for logical manipulation.

Until the advent of modern logic, Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Organon&quot;, especially &quot;De Interpretatione&quot;, provided the basis for understanding the significance of logic. The introduction of quantification, needed to solve the problem of multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject–predicate analysis that governed Aristotle&#x27;s account, although there is a renewed interest in term logic, attempting to find calculi in the spirit of Aristotle&#x27;s syllogisms, but with the generality of modern logics based on the quantifier.

The main modern approaches to semantics for formal languages are the following:
* The archetype of &quot;model-theoretic semantics&quot; is Alfred Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory of truth, based on his T-schema, and is one of the founding concepts of model theory. This is the most widespread approach, and is based on the idea that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined mathematical domains: an interpretation of first-order predicate logic is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of individuals, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. Model-theoretic semantics provides the foundations for an approach to the theory of meaning known as truth-conditional semantics, which was pioneered by Donald Davidson. Kripke semantics introduces innovations, but is broadly in the Tarskian mold.
* &quot;Proof-theoretic semantics&quot; associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences. Gerhard Gentzen, Dag Prawitz and Michael Dummett are generally seen as the founders of this approach; it is heavily influenced by Ludwig Wittgenstein&#x27;s later philosophy, especially his aphorism &quot;meaning is use&quot;.
* &quot;Truth-value semantics&quot; (also commonly referred to as &quot;substitutional quantification&quot;) was advocated by Ruth Barcan Marcus for modal logics in the early 1960s and later championed by J. Michael Dunn, Nuel Belnap, and Hugues Leblanc for standard first-order logic. James Garson has given some results in the areas of adequacy for intensional logics outfitted with such a semantics. The truth conditions for quantified formulas are given purely in terms of truth with no appeal to domains whatsoever (and hence its name &quot;truth-value semantics&quot;).
* &quot;Game semantics&quot; or &quot;game-theoretical semantics&quot; made a resurgence mainly due to Jaakko Hintikka for logics of (finite) partially ordered quantification, which were originally investigated by Leon Henkin, who studied Henkin quantifiers.
* &quot;Probabilistic semantics&quot; originated from Hartry Field and has been shown equivalent to and a natural generalization of truth-value semantics. Like truth-value semantics, it is also non-referential in nature.

<doc id="909893" wikidata="Q2007814" url="?curid=909893" title="Shubunkin">
<text>are a hardy, single-tailed goldfish with nacreous scales and a pattern known as . They are of Japanese origin.

The &quot;Shubunkin&quot; was created by Akiyama Yoshigoro (:ja:秋山吉五郎) by crossing Calico telescope eye with a Comet goldfish and a Common goldfish.

==Description==
&quot;Shubunkin&quot; are similar to the common goldfish and comet goldfish in appearance. They were first bred in Japan, from crossbreeding the calico telescope eye goldfish (Demekins), comet goldfish, and the common goldfish &quot;c.&quot; 1900. They have streamlined bodies with well-developed and even fins. However, the Shubunkins are calico goldfish; they possess nacreous scales (an intermediate between metallic and transparent scales that are pearly in appearance). The overlapping patches of red, white, blue, grey and black (along with dark speckles) normally extend to the finnage of Shubunkins. Blue is the most prized colour in Shubunkins. Calico originally denoted three coloured varieties of goldfish that did not include blue. The best blues are produced from line breeding of good blue specimens of Shubunkins. Sometimes good blues may be obtained by breeding bronze (metallic) with &quot;pink&quot; (matte-scaled) goldfish, but a grey slate colour may result instead.

It may take several months for the nacreous coloration to develop on a young fry (baby fish). Shubunkins are excellent pond fish because they reach a length of at adulthood. A Shubunkin goldfish is considered an adult at 1 to 2 years of age, even though they live much longer. With proper diet and water conditions, the average lifespan of a Shubunkin goldfish is around 10–15 years.

==Genetics==
Blue colouring in goldfish comes from black pigment within the body wall. It will not show as blue in fish with metallic type scales, but will look blue if the fish has matte or nacreous scales. The nacreous (formerly called calico) scale type is produced in a fish that carries the gene for metallic scales, as well as the gene for matte scales (the fish is heterozygous). Only nacreous scales are accepted by the Shubunkin breed standards.
*When two fish with nacreous scales breed together, the offspring will on average include 1/4 with metallic scales, 1/4 with matte scales, and 1/2 with nacreous scales.
*If a fish with nacreous scales breeds with a fish with metallic scales, the offspring will on average include 1/2 metallic and 1/2 nacreous. 
*If a fish with nacreous scales breeds with a fish with matte scales, the offspring will on average include 1/2 matte and 1/2 nacreous.
*If a fish with metallic scales breeds with a fish with matte scales, the offspring will all be nacreous.

==Variants==
*London Shubunkins have stout bodies and short, rounded finnage that is similar to the common goldfish.
*American Shubunkins &quot;(pictured in infobox)&quot;, also called &quot;Japanese Shubunkins&quot;, have a slimmer body shape than the London Shubunkin, with deeply forked, pointed tail fins, and longer finnage all around. They are the most frequently seen type of shubunkins and the most common kind of shubunkins in many fish stores and markets.
*Bristol Shubunkins are a long broad-bodied goldfish with well-developed finnage, possessing a tail that is exaggeratingly large, moderately forked, and rounded at the end, making a shape similar to that of a heart or the capitalization of the letter &quot;B&quot;. They are the rarest shubunkins, hardly in stores, and few are in the US. The name Bristol shubunkin comes from the city in Britain where they were originally bred.

<text>Ben Cunningham (born 1947 in Sheffield, Alabama) is a Gallatin, Tennessee real estate investor and founder and spokesman of the grassroots political group Tennessee Tax Revolt, Inc.

Cunningham is a Republican, but his group includes many Libertarians and conservative Democrats. The group is a result of the attempt to implement a state income tax during the administration of former governor of Tennessee Don Sundquist.

Cunningham was an early developer of infrastructure for what became the Internet and established a computer bulletin board service called Nashville Exchange. Cunningham sold the bulletin board service for a sum which enabled him to become a major real estate investor in the Nashville market. He has stated that his opposition to the state income tax is primarily a philosophical one and that he desires to limit the growth of government.

Cunnigham and his group advocate a &quot;Taxpayer Bill of Rights&quot; which would amend the Tennessee Constitution in a manner similar to that done in Colorado in the 1990s. Their plan would require that any tax increase resulting in an increase of revenues to state government growing at a rate faster than the combined rate of population increase and the cost of living index be subjected to a referendum.

While considered highly unlikely to be enacted by the Tennessee state legislature in the near future, the concept has already been accepted by the city of Spring Hill, Tennessee, home of Saturn Corporation. Cunningham and his supporters trumpet the high rate of growth of this jurisdiction, which has resulted in tax reductions in each of the last five years. The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; concept is being pushed for by advocates in several other jurisdictions in Tennessee as well.

<doc id="909903" wikidata="Q4812400" url="?curid=909903" title="At Seventeen">
<text>&quot;At Seventeen&quot; is a song by American singer-songwriter Janis Ian from her seventh studio album &quot;Between the Lines&quot;. Columbia released it in July 1975 as the album&#x27;s second single. Ian wrote the lyrics on the basis of a &quot;New York Times&quot; article and used a samba instrumental, and Brooks Arthur produced the final version. A pop and soft rock ballad, the song is about a social outcast in high school. Critics have regarded &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as a type of anthem. Despite her initial reluctance to perform the single live, Ian promoted it at various appearances and it has been included on compilation and live albums.

Critics praised &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, which earned Ian the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and Grammy nominations for Record and Song of the Year. The single reached number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and had sold over a million copies as of August 2004. Internationally, &quot;At Seventeen&quot; charted in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. It is one of Ian&#x27;s most commercially successful songs, considered by critics her signature song. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; has been used frequently in television and films, like &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Mean Girls&quot;; it has also been referenced in literature. Various recording artists and musicians, including Anita Kerr, Jann Arden, and Celine Dion, have covered &quot;At Seventeen&quot;. The Hong Kong all-female band at17 named themselves after it in 2002.

==Background and recording==
&quot;At Seventeen&quot; was written by Janis Ian at the age of 23 and produced by Brooks Arthur. She was inspired to write the single after reading a &quot;New York Times&quot; article about a young woman who thought her life would improve after a debutante ball and her subsequent disappointment when it did not. In the article the girl was 18, but Ian changed it to 17 to fit with her samba guitar instrumental. She recalled feeling uncomfortable while writing &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as it predated the confessional song trend of the 1970s. She was also uncertain about writing about high school when she had never experienced a homecoming or a prom. She said she purposely took her time with the song to ensure it did not lose its &quot;intensity&quot;; she repeatedly stopped and started work on it over the course of three months. At the time, she was living with her mother.

During the recording process, which Ian described as &quot;very tense&quot;, she worried she had accidentally stolen the melody from a different song and consulted three friends about it. Arthur described the song as &quot;just honest and straight from her heart&quot;, and felt it was different from folk or pop music. He said Ian was easy to work with as she had prepared by bringing lyric sheets and arrangements to the studio sessions. Arthur and Ian had worked together on her 1966 single &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;, during which they formed a close friendship. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; was completed in roughly two or three days at 914 Sound Studios; it was recorded on September 17, 1974. The final version contains two combined takes, as the initial ending was deemed too weak compared to its start. Allen Klein listened in during a session and responded positively to the song. Brooks Arthur, Larry Alexander, and Russ Payne were the audio engineers for &quot;At Seventeen&quot;.

==Composition and lyrics==

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; is composed in the key of C major using common time and a moderate tempo of 126 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by a piano and a guitar. During the track, Ian&#x27;s vocal range spans from the low note of G3 to the high note of A4. Some commentators connected the song to bossa nova. &quot;Mix&quot; magazine&#x27;s Gary Eskow cited Ian&#x27;s style as the opposite of Antônio Carlos Jobim&#x27;s because she &quot;explore[d] the belly of the bossa, the flip side of Ipanema&quot;. John Lissner of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to the instrumental as having a &quot;laid-back bossa nova beat&quot; and ostinato. On the other hand, AllMusic″s Lindsay Planer referred to &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as a mixture of pop rock, jazz, and blues, and music scholar James E. Perone associated it more with jazz and a &quot;coffeehouse folksinger&quot; approach. Perone described the song&#x27;s style as more restrained compared to Ian&#x27;s contemporaries. A writer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine associated &quot;At Seventeen&quot; with &quot;sulk-pop&quot;.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; is a pop and soft rock ballad about being a social outcast in high school, particularly with respect to adolescent cruelty and rejection. The lyrics focus on the conflict between cliques as represented by the contrast of &quot;ravaged faces&quot; and &quot;clear-skinned smiles&quot;. The song opens with the line &quot;I learned the truth at seventeen, that love was meant for beauty queens&quot;. The narrator reveals in the third verse that she finds herself unattractive (&quot;Those of us with ravaged faces&quot;), but later provides a more hopeful outlook through an &quot;Ugly Duckling&quot; allusion (&quot;Ugly duckling girls like me&quot;). Ian said &quot;The Ugly Duckling&quot; lyric was partially inspired by Billie Holiday, who described her music as always containing a sense of hope. Ian wrote the last verse (&quot;To those of us who knew the pain / of valentines that never came&quot;) to connect directly with the listener. Other lyrics include social outcasts&#x27; pastimes like &quot;cheat[ing] at solitaire /….remain[ing] at home /inventing lovers on the phone/ repenting of lives unknown&quot;, and remembering &quot;The valentines I never knew/the Friday night charades of youth.&quot;

Some commentators viewed &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as a type of anthem. Melissa Etheridge and &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Patrick Crowley interpreted the song as a gay anthem. Crowley equated the awkwardness described in the lyrics to the confusion over one&#x27;s sexual orientation. Etheridge interpreted the line (&quot;I learned the truth at seventeen&quot;) as discovering one&#x27;s homosexuality. Ian has said she was initially surprised at the LGBT support given to the song. NPR included &quot;At Seventeen&quot; in its 2018 series on American anthems.

==Release and promotion==

===Release===
Ian&#x27;s manager and CBS felt the song was too long, and CBS was uncertain how to market a song with so many lyrics. Producer Herb Gart had suggested that &quot;When the Party&#x27;s Over&quot; be released as the lead single from Ian&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Between the Lines&quot; rather than &quot;At Seventeen&quot;. He reasoned that radio personalities would choose &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as the better single and feel smarter than the record label. Alternatively, Arthur thought &quot;When the Party&#x27;s Over&quot; was a more appropriate choice. Gart asked radio stations to play only the first sixty seconds of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; followed by an advertisement for the song to encourage people to call in and request the rest. Ian said that Gart&#x27;s promotional strategies were successful.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; was first released in July 1975. It was made available as a 7 inch single on November 20, 1976, through Columbia; &quot;Stars&quot; and &quot;Applause&quot; were used as B-sides on two separate single releases. The album version was four minutes and forty-three seconds long, and the single version was cut down to three minutes and fifty-six seconds. On February 14, 1977, (Valentine&#x27;s Day), Ian was sent 461 Valentine&#x27;s Day cards in reference to the lyric (&quot;Of valentines that never came&quot;). She has subsequently included &quot;At Seventeen&quot; on compilation albums. A remastered version of &quot;Between the Lines&quot;, including &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, has also been made available; on August 4, 2014, Ian released an acoustic version of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; through her label Rude Girl Records.

===Live performances===
Ian was initially hesitant to perform the single live, describing it as deeply personal and fearing public ridicule. She closed her eyes while singing it for the first six months because she was afraid the audience would laugh at her. She later said that the frank lyrics encouraged pathos from the listeners. Ian went on a promotional tour for the single and performed at small shows for almost half a year. These appearances included a British morning show where Queen was promoting their 1975 single &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;. In the beginning, Ian toured with a drummer, bass player, and her tour manager. Ian said she knew the song was successful when the size of the audience grew from 100 to 800. Ian sang &quot;At Seventeen&quot; on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;″s first episode on October 11, 1975, and the following year, she performed it on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; at the Shepherd&#x27;s Bush BBC Television Theatre. She also sang it on an episode of &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, with guest host Steve Lawrence.

Ian and Howard Stern performed a parody of the single to spoof then 38-year-old Jerry Seinfeld&#x27;s relationship with high school senior Shoshana Lonstein at the &quot;Miss Howard Stern New Year’s Eve Pageant&quot; on December 31, 1993. Revised lyrics included &quot;can&#x27;t he get an older girl&quot;. She performed the song as part of the Women in Music: 1960-1999 concert, aired by MTV in 1999. Ian performed a science fiction version of the song, entitled &quot;Welcome Home (The Nebulous Song),&quot; at a banquet for the 2008 Nebula Awards. The version included references to science fiction authors and publications. Ian sang &quot;At Seventeen&quot; for the 2016 Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts&#x27; American Songbook series and the 2018 Cambridge Folk Festival. The same year, she recorded an acoustic version to include on the app for Wally Lamb&#x27;s novel &quot;I&#x27;ll Take You There&quot;; it included a soundtrack containing eight songs, including &quot;At Seventeen&quot;. Some of Ian&#x27;s performances have been released on live albums.

==Critical reception and accolades==
&quot;At Seventeen&quot; received a positive response from critics. A contributor for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; praised it as &quot;a moving and memorable appraisal of teenage loneliness&quot;. Twiggy commended the song for perfectly representing the awkwardness of being a teenager, and compared it to her own experiences growing up. &quot;The Advocate&quot;&#x27;s Gina Vivinetto summed up &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as &quot;the best song about growing up female ever written&quot;. Brittany Spanos, writing for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, attributed the song&#x27;s success to Ian&#x27;s intimate delivery of its subject, likening it to Joni Mitchell&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Blue&quot; (1971). Jeff and Don Breithaupt wrote that the song was &quot;lifted above the level of generic moping by a sharply detailed lyric&quot;. John Lissner described &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as &quot;mellow [and] improve[d] with each hearing&quot;, along with the songs &quot;When the Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, &quot;From Me to You&quot;, and &quot;Bright Lights and Promises&quot;. Alternatively, Idolator&#x27;s Mike Wass criticized &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as a &quot;self-pitying and usually annoying single girl anthem&quot;.

Ian received the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for &quot;At Seventeen&quot; at the 18th Annual Grammy Awards, and the song was nominated for record and song of the year. She performed the song as part of the ceremony. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2008, and is considered Ian&#x27;s signature song. According to Mike McPadden of VH1, the single had made Ian a &quot;major mainstream folk-rock performer&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;At Seventeen&quot; peaked at number three on the September 13, 1975 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, and remained on it for twenty weeks. It reached number one on the Adult Contemporary &quot;Billboard&quot; chart for two weeks in August 1975, and stayed on the chart for fifteen weeks. It also peaked at number one on the &quot;Cashbox&quot; top 100 chart, and number six on its year-end pop singles chart. On the &quot;Billboard&quot; Year-End chart, &quot;At Seventeen&quot; ranked number nineteen. It also reached number twenty for pop and number two for easy listening. According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the song enjoyed a resurgence in sales after the Grammy Awards in 1976.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; also appeared on international charts. In Canada, the single peaked at number one on the &quot;RPM&quot; pop music playlist and number six on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top Singles chart. On &quot;RPM&quot;&#x27;s top two-hundred songs of 1975, it ranked number seventy-one. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; reached number thirty-seven on the New Zealand Singles Chart for the week of October 10, 1975. In Australia, it peaked at number eighteen on the Kent Music Report, and was included at number eighty on the year-end chart.

Ian cited the song&#x27;s commercial success as making her an example of the American dream. It was her first successful single since &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;, and her biggest success overall. &quot;The Register-Guard&quot;″s Lewis Taylor referred to a 1970s release of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; when Ian was broke, and music critics deemed her music not commercially viable, as the first of many comebacks. As of August 2004, the song has sold over a million copies.

==Usage in media==
&quot;At Seventeen&quot; has been a popular choice for film and television soundtracks. It was played in the 2001 film &quot;Scotland, PA&quot;, an adaptation of the Shakespeare play &quot;Macbeth&quot;. The character Donald Duncan, portrayed by Geoff Dunsworth, is shown listening to the single in a scene Professor Jennifer Drouin interpreted as indicative of his queer identity. The song can be heard in the background of a scene in the 2004 film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. Some critics felt it represented the character named Janis Ian. Liz Lemon (portrayed by Tina Fey) performed a karaoke version of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; in a season one episode of &quot;30 Rock&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;&#x27;s Erik Adams described the scene as a callback to Fey&#x27;s work on &quot;Mean Girls&quot;. &quot;At Seventeen&quot; was included in the 2013 film &quot;Blood Ties&quot;. Stephen Holden, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, criticized the song&#x27;s placement in the film, and believed it belonged in &quot;a softer and gentler movie&quot; instead. It is also featured in the first season of &quot;The End of the F***ing World&quot;, the fifth season of &quot;The Blacklist&quot;, and in anti-bullying advertisements.

The single was featured in three episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;: &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, &quot;El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer&quot;, and &quot;Chief of Hearts&quot;. In &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, the lyrics are changed to describe the contestants of a beauty pageant. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;″s Nathan Rabin cited the scene as representative of the episode&#x27;s satire on &quot;loneliness and despair [transformed] into crowd-pleasing entertainment through wildly inappropriate showmanship&quot;. In &quot;El Viaje Misterioso de Nuestro Jomer&quot;, the song is used during Homer Simpson&#x27;s search for a soulmate. Sarah Oliver of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; felt it reflected the character&#x27;s melancholy.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; has also been referenced in literature. It was named in Jeffrey Eugenides&#x27; 1993 novel &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot;, where four girls imprisoned in their own homes use it and other songs to communicate with the narrator and his friends. Orson Scott Card titled his short story &quot;Inventing Lovers on the Phone&quot; from a line of &quot;At Seventeen&quot;. Ian said that Card&#x27;s work had inspired her own music, specifically the track &quot;This House&quot; from her 1993 studio album &quot;Breaking Silence&quot;.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; has been covered by various recording artists and musicians. Anita Kerr covered it for her 1975 album &quot;The Anita Kerr Singers&quot;, which anthropologist Mary A. Bufwack and music reporter Robert K. Oermann attributed to popularizing the song. Claude Francois recorded a French version of the song, titled &quot;17 ans&quot;, in 1975, Mireille Mathieu too in 1977 with French lyrics by Eddy Marnay (LP &quot;Sentimentalement vôtre&quot; disque d&#x27;or)
 In 1988, cabaret singer Judith Cohen performed a cover of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; in her shows. Stephen Holden said that her performances of the song Bruce Roberts&#x27; &quot;I Don&#x27;t Break Easily&quot; were &quot;built to strong dramatic climaxes in which a key line abruptly changed the narrative perspective&quot;. Tara MacLean recorded the song for the 1999 movie &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot;, and Paul Clinton believed the film&#x27;s soundtrack added &quot;energy and pacing to the story&quot;. Chocolat covered a Yoshinori Sunahara-produced &quot;At Seventeen&quot; for her 1999 second studio album &quot;Hamster&quot;, which &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Steve McClure described as having a &quot;dark, ambient feel&quot;. Ringo Sheena recorded the track &quot;Seventeen&quot; as a tribute to the Janis Ian song; Sheena cited Ian as one of her major influences, particularly for her voice.

The all-female band at17 chose their name partially based on the Janis Ian song. They did a Cantonese version for their 2002 studio album &quot;Meow Meow Meow&quot;. New Zealand singer Amber Claire released her version of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as the second single from her 2004 debut album &quot;Love and Such&quot;. It debuted and peaked at number twenty-eight on the Official New Zealand Music Chart. The same year, Gwyneth Herbert included her rendition on her second studio album &quot;Bittersweet and Blue&quot;; a reviewer from &quot;The Times&quot; described the version as &quot;pop angst&quot;. DHT covered the song with Edmée Daenen for their debut studio album &quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot; (2005). AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries enjoyed their cover, and described it as lacking the camp style previously used by the band. Sitti did a cover for her debut studio album &quot;Café Bossa&quot; (2006), and her live album &quot;My Bossa Nova Live!&quot; (2008).

Producer Kenneth Ehrlich requested Celine Dion perform the song as part of a 2008 Grammy Nominations TV special. For her rendition, Dion sang it with only her band on stage. She included it on her Las Vegas residency show &quot;Céline&quot;, and recorded a Babyface-produced cover for her eleventh English-language studio album &quot;Loved Me Back to Life&quot; (2013). According to Steve Morse of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, the album version contains &quot;a light Brazilian feel&quot;. Some critics praised Dion&#x27;s performance, with &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Eric Henderson writing it perfectly represents the singer as a &quot;manic, Hallmark card-brandishing guru of schmaltz&quot;. On the other hand, Stephen Erlewine of AllMusic called the cover &quot;thoroughly colorless adult contemporary.&quot; Dion also performed &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as part of a medley with her singles &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot; (2002) and &quot;Unison&quot; (1990) for her tour Celine Dion Live 2018.

Carly Rae Jepsen sang &quot;At Seventeen&quot; during the top three of the fifth season of &quot;Canadian Idol&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s Grady Smith praised her rendition for showcasing her breathy vocals, while Evan Sawdey of &quot;PopMatters&quot; found it to be unoriginal and tone-deaf. Jann Arden released her cover of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; as a single from her seventh studio album &quot;Uncover Me&quot;. Arden said that it was the first song she learned to play on the guitar, and identified it as a &quot;perfect coming of age song&quot;. AllMusic&#x27;s Stewart Mason described Arden&#x27;s take as &quot;downright spooky&quot;. The cover peaked at eighty-four on the Canadian Hot 100 &quot;Billboard&quot; chart on May 5, 2007, and remained on the chart for six weeks. Arden performed &quot;At Seventeen&quot; on her Uncover Me Tour in 2007. She included the live version on her iTunes exclusive extended play (EP) &quot;Live Session&quot;, released in 2007. In 2008, Regine Velasquez recorded a cover of the song on her fifth cover album &quot;Low Key&quot;. For the album, she included songs that she wanted to sing since childhood. The same year, Rhonda Burchmore included her rendition of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; on her studio album &quot;Pure Imagination&quot;. Burchmore chose the song based on what the &quot;Herald Sun&quot;&#x27;s Jill Fraser referred to as &quot;a deliberate move to more popstyle songs&quot;.

&quot;At Seventeen&quot; is performed as part of the musical &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot;. It was one of several pop covers used to tell the life of Susan Boyle, which Emma Clayton of &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; praised as a smart idea. Maureen McGovern performed the song at the Feinstein&#x27;s/54 Below as part of a 2015 event celebrating female singer-songwriters. The same year, Alessia Cara included a song entitled &quot;Seventeen&quot; on her EP &quot;Four Pink Walls&quot;, which the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s Brittany Spanos called a &quot;savvy update&quot; of the Ian original. Saffron Monsoon (portrayed by Julia Sawalha) did a karaoke version of &quot;At Seventeen&quot; in the 2016 film &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; in a bar with drag queens. The version was included on the film&#x27;s official soundtrack. Rachael Yamagata recorded &quot;At Seventeen&quot;, along with other covers, to finance her fourth studio album &quot;Tightrope Walker&quot; (2016). In 2018, American singer Sarah Partridge covered &quot;At Seventeen&quot; for her album &quot;Bright Lights and Promises: Redefining Janis Ian.&quot; Partridge recorded her version with a septuple meter.

<text>The cümbüş (; ) is a Turkish stringed instrument of relatively modern origin. It was developed in 1930 by Zeynel Abidin Cümbüş as an oud-like instrument that could be heard as part of a larger ensemble.

The cümbüş is shaped like an American banjo, with a spun-aluminum resonator bowl and skin soundboard. Although originally configured as an oud, the instrument has been converted to other instruments by attaching a different set of neck and strings. The standard cümbüş is fretless, but guitar, mandolin and ukulele versions have fretboards. The neck is adjustable, allowing the musician to change the angle of the neck to its strings by turning a screw. One model is made with a wooden resonator bowl, with the effect of a less tinny, softer sound.

==Origin of the maker and the name==
The word &quot;cümbüş&quot; is derived from the Turkish for &quot;revelry&quot; or &quot;fun&quot;, as the instrument was marketed as a popular alternative to the more costly classical oud. Unlike inventors who name their inventions after themselves, Zeynel Abidin Cümbüş took his last name from his instrument. He was born Zeynel Abidin in Skopje, Macedonia and immigrated to Beyazit, Istanbul, Turkey. His name is often written &quot;Zeynel Abidin Bey&quot; online in Turkey, where &quot;Bey&quot; is an honorific, such as &quot;mister&quot;. Early instruments show his name as he wrote it &quot;Zeynelabidin&quot; (a single name, not two). When Mustafa Kemal Atatürk decreed that families take surnames in 1934, Zeynel Abidin adopted the name of his famous instrument.

==Rising and falling with social tides==
After the Turkish War of Independence Zeynel Abidin Cümbüş wanted to create a new instrument to embody the ideals of peace, an instrument for the masses. He switched his company from dealing with arms to manufacturing musical instruments for &quot;the support of peace through music.&quot; In a meeting with Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the founder of the Republic of Turkey, he showed one of his new inventions. It was &quot;an inexpensive instrument easy to transport and hard to break, capable of playing both Eastern alaturka music and, with a quick change of removable necks, Western alafranga music as well.&quot; It was a modern instrument for a modern country.

The cümbüş was inexpensive and was bought by people who couldn&#x27;t afford a more expensive instrument; as a result, his dream of the masses accepting it was marginalized. The instrument became a folk instrument of the poor and of ethnic minorities in Turkey, including Rûm, Armenians, Jews, Kurds, and Romani, &quot;playing indigenous folk music or repertoires shared with ethnic Turks.&quot; It was excluded specifically by classical musicians of the era, being seen as lower-class or ethnic. A perception grew of it being &quot;other&quot; or ethnic or different or lower-class, and Turkish society did not adopt the instrument widely. By the 1960s, use of the cümbüş declined among these minorities, except for Román professional musicians. They adopted the instrument because of its ability to be heard alongside the other instruments they played at weddings and parties.

===Turnaround===
Beginning in the mid-1990s, more people started to take up the instrument again at Armenian and Jewish folk music revivals and in Kurdish and Romani folk music recordings. It has been since taken up by modern Turkish-rock and techno musicians, some making statements with the way the music sounds, and others apolitical or humanistic or spiritual.

==Present-day==
Cümbüş Music is still an active company in Istanbul and manufactures a wide range of traditional Turkish instruments. The instruments are hand made in the family&#x27;s workshop in Istanbul, by three members of the Cümbüş family, Naci Abidin Cümbüş and his two sons Fethi and Alizeynel. They still make approximately 3000 cümbüşes a year (as of 2002). They also manufacture about 5000 darbukas per year (middle-eastern drums), and sell guitars as well. They export approximately half the cümbüşes to the United States, France and Greece.

<text>MARRS (stylised M|A|R|R|S) were a 1987 recording collective formed by the groups A.R. Kane and Colourbox, which only released one commercial disc. It became &quot;a one-hit wonder of rare influence&quot; because of their international hit &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, which was their only single.

==History==
MARRS started in 1987 as an intended collaboration between the groups A.R. Kane and Colourbox, with additional input from DJs Chris &quot;C.J.&quot; Mackintosh and Dave Dorrell. However, instead of working together, the two groups ended up recording a track each, then turning it over to the other for additional input. Of the two pieces completed, one, &quot;Anitina&quot;, was an A.R. Kane track with drum programming by Colourbox&#x27;s Steve Young. The other, &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, was a propulsive Martyn Young track constructed largely of samples, including one of A.R. Kane&#x27;s guitars.

The record was released under the alias MARRS, an acronym derived from the forenames of the five 4AD artists involved in the project: Martyn Young (from Colourbox), Alex Ayuli and Rudy Tambala (from A.R. Kane), Russell Smith (an associate A.R. Kane member and founder of Terminal Cheesecake), and Steven Young (from Colourbox).

The ostensibly double A-sided single &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; / &quot;Anitina&quot;, released on 4AD in the UK, was to be the sole MARRS release. Only &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; gained significant attention and airplay and went on to be a No. 1 hit in the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, as well as a top-ten hit in several other countries. (&quot;Anitina&quot; was listed on the UK chart after several weeks, but a note on the actual chart explained that &quot;Anitina&quot; was listed at the record company&#x27;s request, &quot;without significant evidence of consumer interest&quot; in the track).

&quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot; was released on 4th &amp; B&#x27;way/Island Records in the US. Because of legal issues, some of the samples used in the original UK release of the song were removed and replaced in the US release.

It was nominated for the 1989 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, but lost out to &quot;Close-Up&quot; by David Sanborn. In September 1987, MARRS announced that it would not issue a follow-up release. Colourbox would never reform, while A.R. Kane would continue with a hiatus period from 1994 to 2015.

Group member Steven Young died on 13 July 2016.

<doc id="909933" wikidata="Q210349" url="?curid=909933" title="French cruiser Jeanne d'Arc (R97)">
<text>Jeanne d&#x27;Arc was a helicopter cruiser of the French Navy. She was the sixth vessel of the French Navy named after Joan of Arc (&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; in French), a national heroine of France and saint of the Catholic Church who distinguished herself in the Hundred Years&#x27; War by helping France turn the tide of the Lancastrian phase.

In peacetime, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was used for teaching and training purposes; however, in case of emergency or crisis, she was to have become a fully capable helicopter cruiser. Toward the end of her service life, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; became unsuitable for the role due to the increasing size and weight of helicopters.

&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was built as &quot;La Résolue&quot;, as her predecessor, the of 1930, was still in service. She was renamed &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; in 1964. The ship was retired in May 2010 and decommissioned in September 2010.

== Career ==
===Missions===

In peacetime, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was a teaching and training vessel for the naval officers&#x27; application academy, and at the same time possessed an aerial group of 2 Aérospatiale Puma and 2 Aérospatiale Gazelle French Army light aviation helicopters, as well as two Alouette III naval aviation helicopters.

&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was capable of combat deployment, either in an anti-submarine warfare role with 8 WG 13 Lynx helicopters, or for external missions by carrying Puma or Gazelle light aviation French Army helicopters. Initially, she was also able to carry landing troops and Sikorsky or Super Frelon helicopters.

&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; could carry roughly 10 light or heavy helicopters and simultaneously handle the takeoff and landing of 3 helicopters.

Following the development of the Exocet anti-ship missile, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was fitted with the system in 1974.

In 2008, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was deployed in an anti-piracy role in the Gulf of Aden. The ship was used as part of the rescue effort of &quot;Le Ponant&quot; during the April 2008 hostage-taking incident. A Gazelle helicopter from &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; carrying snipers chased and captured pirates who had escaped on 4x4 vehicles after the hostages had been freed.

&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; commenced her final cruise in December 2009. The last trip included visits to Africa, South America including Rio and Buenos Aires, Lima, the French Antilles, the United States including New York City, and Canada. The deployment was completed in May 2010 with a return to the port of Brest, France on 27 May 2010. On its final mission, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; continued to perform its role as a training vessel for French navy midshipmen. On her final voyage, she was accompanied by the frigate (F712), and carried a French training squadron with 103 cadets, including twelve from nine foreign countries.

===End of service formalities===
The &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; helicopter cruiser was formally removed from active service in the French Marine Nationale on 7 June 2010. The necessary disarmament operations were formalised by decree of the Ministry of Defence on 4 June 2010 and announced in the Official Bulletin of the Marine Nationale, Edition No. 26, on 25 June 2010. The announcement stated that these disarmament procedures where to be conducted under the authority of the Admiral commanding the Naval Action Force (ALFAN), the Minister of Defence and the Deputy Chief of Staff, Support and Finance&quot;, Hubert Sciorella.
On 1 September 2010, at 11:30, &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&#x27;s&quot; colours and name were withdrawn, formally ending her life as a ship in the Marine Nationale. This final colour ceremony on &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; was held in the ship&#x27;s home port of Brest. Following disarmament in the Arsenal basin there, the ship continued to be moored at the Brest naval base. On 9 September 2010, the former &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; has its naval number R 97 removed and was moved to Piriouas as Hull Q 860 to undergo the work of securing the hulk and extracting the remaining recoverable hardware. The task of establishing an inventory of hazardous materials present on the vessel took place in the naval yards prior to dismantling the hull and was expected to take up to two years. A tender was then sent for its dismantling. At the time, the French Navy had 76 hulks ready to be dismantled. The issue was a sensitive one, following problems arising from the disposal and dismantling of the former . In 2014, it was decided that &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; would be dismantled at Bordeaux by the Bartin Recycling Group and Pétrofer, subsidiaries of Veolia Group. The contract was worth approximately 11.5 million Euros.

<doc id="909940" wikidata="Q3647078" url="?curid=909940" title="Happy Birthday, Wanda June">
<text>Happy Birthday, Wanda June is a 1971 American comedy-drama film directed by Mark Robson, based on a 1970 play by Kurt Vonnegut.

==Plot==
The opening of this play is &quot;This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing, and those who don&#x27;t.&quot;

Big-game hunter and war hero Harold Ryan returns home to America, after having been presumed dead for several years. During the war, he killed over 200 men and women, and countless more animals — for sport. He was in the Amazon Rainforest hunting for diamonds with Colonel Looseleaf Harper, a slow-witted aviation hero, who had the unhappy task of dropping the atomic bomb on Nagasaki. Harold finds that his wife Penelope has developed relationships with men very much unlike himself, including a vacuum cleaner salesman called Shuttle and a hippie doctor called Dr. Woodly, who later becomes Ryan&#x27;s foe. He also finds that his son, Paul, has been pampered and grown unmanly. Set in 1960s America, Ryan feels the country has become weak, all the heroes have been replaced by intolerable pacifists, and that in postwar America, no proper enemy is available for him to vanquish.

Wanda June is a young girl who died before she could celebrate her birthday, having been run over by an ice cream truck. She is very pleased with her situation in Heaven, and feels that dying is a good thing: in Heaven, everyone loves the person who sent them there. Her birthday cake was subsequently purchased by one of Penelope&#x27;s lovers, for a celebration of Ryan&#x27;s birthday in his absence. Wanda June and several other deceased connections to Ryan (including his ex-wife Mildred who drank herself to death because she could not stand Harold&#x27;s premature ejaculation, and Major Siegfried von Konigswald, the Beast of Yugoslavia, Ryan&#x27;s most infamous victim) speak to the audience from Heaven, where Jesus, Judas Iscariot, Adolf Hitler, and Albert Einstein are happily playing shuffleboard.

==Cast==

* Rod Steiger as Harold Ryan

==Productions and adaptations==
&quot;Happy Birthday, Wanda June&quot; originated as a play titled &quot;Penelope&quot;, first performed at the Orleans Arena Theater in Orleans, Massachusetts.

<doc id="909946" wikidata="Q525981" url="?curid=909946" title="Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum">
<text>The Harry S Truman Presidential Library and Museum is the presidential library and resting place of Harry S Truman, the 33rd president of the United States (1945–1953), his wife Bess and daughter Margaret, and is located on U.S. Highway 24 in Independence, Missouri. It was the first presidential library created under the provisions of the 1955 Presidential Libraries Act and is one of thirteen presidential libraries administered by the National Archives and Records Administration.

==History==

The library was built with private funds raised by the Harry S. Truman Library Inc., with Truman himself contributing greatly to the fundraising effort by &quot;attending dinners, making speeches around the country, and writing thousands of letters&quot;.

Built on a hill overlooking the Kansas City skyline, on land donated by the City of Independence, it was dedicated July 6, 1957. The ceremony included the Masonic Rites of Dedication and attendance by former President Herbert Hoover (then the only living former president other than President Truman), Chief Justice Earl Warren, and former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt.

Here, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Medicare Act on July 30, 1965.

The museum has been victimized by significant burglaries twice.

John Wesley Snyder, Truman&#x27;s Treasury Secretary and close friend, donated his personal collection of 450 rare coins to the museum in March 1962. That November, burglars stole the entire collection. None of the stolen coins have been recovered. Snyder helped coordinate an effort among 147 coin collectors to reconstruct the collection, which went back on display in 1967, at a ceremony attended by Truman.

While serving as president, Truman had received gifts of jewel encrusted swords and daggers from Saud of Saudi Arabia, then the crown prince, and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. He turned these items over to the National Archives and Records Administration as required by law, and they were displayed at the museum. According to the museum curator, they &quot;had embedded diamonds and rubies and sapphires, a number of precious stones in their hilts and in their scabbards&quot;. In March 1978, burglars broached the front door of the museum, smashed showcases, and stole the three swords and two daggers, which were valued at US$1 million at that time. None of the stolen items have been recovered. In 2021, the FBI offered a reward of up to $1 million for return of the items.

On December 11, 2006, Kofi Annan gave his final speech as Secretary-General of the United Nations at the library, where he encouraged the United States to return to the multilateralist policies of Truman.

===Design===
The lead architect of the project was Edward F. Neild of Shreveport, Louisiana. Truman had picked Neild in the 1930s, during his time as presiding judge of Jackson County, to design the renovation of the old county courthouse in Independence and to oversee the construction of the new courthouse in Kansas City, after being favorably impressed by Neild&#x27;s work on the courthouse in his native Caddo Parish. Neild was also one of the architects involved in the reconstruction of the White House during Truman&#x27;s presidency.

Neild died July 6, 1955, at the Kansas City Club while working on the design. The work was completed by Alonzo H. Gentry of Gentry and Voskamp, the firm that designed Kansas City&#x27;s Municipal Auditorium.

Truman had initially wanted the building to resemble his maternal grandfather Solomon Young&#x27;s house in Grandview, Missouri.

In response to a &quot;New York Times&quot; review that recalled Frank Lloyd Wright influences in the library&#x27;s horizontal design, Truman was reported to have said, &quot;It&#x27;s got too much of that fellow in it to suit me.&quot;

Architects Gould Evans designed a $23 million renovation of the entire facility, unveiled in 2001. The changes included the extensive use of glass in the relatively windowless structure and a significant change to the space between Truman&#x27;s grave and the museum.

==Truman&#x27;s activities on the premises==
Truman actively participated in the day-to-day operation of the Library, personally training museum docents and conducting impromptu &quot;press conferences&quot; for visiting school students. He frequently arrived before the staff and would often answer the phone to give directions and answer questions, telling surprised callers that he was the &quot;man himself.&quot;

His visitors included incumbent Presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon, former President Hoover, Jack Benny, Ginger Rogers, Robert F. Kennedy, Thomas Hart Benton, and Dean Acheson.

== Truman&#x27;s office ==
When Truman left the White House in 1953, he established an office in Room 1107 of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City at 925 Grand Avenue. When the library opened in 1957, he transferred his office to the facility and often worked there five or six days a week. In the office, he wrote articles, letters, and his book &quot;Mr. Citizen&quot;.

In 2007, the Truman Library Institute announced a $1.6 million preservation and restoration of his working office to preserve the artifacts it contains and allow for easier public viewing. The three-stage project completed in 2009 and features an enclosed limestone pavilion for better access and viewing and an updated climate control system. The office appears today just as it did when Harry Truman died on December 26, 1972.

Long a favorite of museum visitors, the office was viewed through a window from the library&#x27;s courtyard. The pavilion will also allow for an interpretive exhibit describing the office.

==Truman&#x27;s funeral services==
Funeral services for Truman were held in the Library auditorium and burial was in the courtyard. His wife, Bess Truman, was buried at his side in 1982. Their daughter, Margaret Truman Daniel, was a longtime member of the Truman Library Institute&#x27;s board of directors. After her death in January 2008, Margaret&#x27;s cremated remains and those of her late husband, Clifton Daniel (who died in 2000), were also interred in the Library&#x27;s courtyard. The president&#x27;s grandson, Clifton Truman Daniel, is currently honorary co-chair of the institute&#x27;s board of directors.

==Exhibits and program==
Two floors of exhibits show his life and presidency through photographs, documents, artifacts, memorabilia, film clips and a film about Truman&#x27;s life.

The library&#x27;s replica of the Oval Office is a feature that has been copied by the Johnson, Ford, Carter, Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush libraries.

In an educational program called &quot;The White House Decision Center&quot;, school students take on the roles of President Truman and his advisors facing real-life historical decisions in a recreation of the West Wing of the White House.

==Theft of artifacts==

In February 1978, there was an attempted break-in at the library, but a security guard was able to scare off the assailants. Several weeks later, on March 24, 1978, burglars (it is unknown whether the two break-ins were related) successfully entered the lobby of the library and stole three ceremonial swords and two daggers, which had been given as gifts to Truman from the leaders of Iran and Saudi Arabia, from a display case. The FBI has an active reward for their recovery, but to date, they have still not been found.

==Art==
The mural &quot;Independence and the Opening of the West&quot; by Thomas Hart Benton adorns the walls of the lobby entrance. The mural, completed in 1961, was painted on site by Benton over a three-year span.

==Visitors==
Visitors after 1972 include incumbent Presidents Ford, Carter, and Clinton and Presidential Nominees John Kerry and John McCain.

<text>The Manhattan Life Insurance Building was a tower on Broadway in the Financial District of Manhattan, New York City. 

== History ==
The original structure at 64–66 Broadway was completed in 1894 to the designs of the architects of Kimball &amp; Thompson, and was slightly extended north in 1904 to 68–70 Broadway. It was the first skyscraper to pass in Manhattan.

The building was sold at least twice. In 1926, the Manhattan Life Insurance Company sold the building to Frederick Brown, who then re-sold it to the Manufacturer&#x27;s Trust Company a few weeks later. Then, in 1928, Central Union Trust Company, whose headquarters were in adjacent structures to the north, bought 70 Broadway for an undisclosed sum, although the building was assessed at that time at $4 million. Following the Central Union Trust Company&#x27;s sale of the buildings to the north to the Irving Trust Company, which then built a new skyscraper at 1 Wall Street, Central Union Trust moved to the Manhattan Life Building and modified the structures at 60, 62, and 70 Broadway.

The building was demolished to make way for an annex to 1 Wall Street, completed in 1965. Sources vary about whether the year of demolition was 1963 or 1964.

<text>Ehud &quot;Udi&quot; Vaks (; born 27 June 1979) is an Israeli judoka.

Vaks won a bronze medal at the 1998 World Juniors Championships in the under 60 kg weight class.

==2004 Olympics==
In the 2004 Summer Olympics, competing in the half lightweight (66 kg) weight class, Vaks was scheduled to fight Iranian competitor Arash Miresmaeili in the first round. Miresmaeili was disqualified from the competition because he was above the allowable weight limit for his class.

It is widely believed that Miresmaili deliberately set out to be disqualified for political reasons, which is supported by his own comments: &quot;“Although I have trained for months and was in good shape I refused to fight my Israeli opponent to sympathise with the suffering of the people of Palestine and I do not feel upset at all.&quot;&quot;

Comments from Iranian officials also supported this view. The Iranian state news agency quoted Iranian President Mohammad Khatami as saying that Miresmaeili&#x27;s actions would be &quot;recorded in the history of Iranian glories,&quot; and that the nation considered him to be &quot;the champion of the 2004 Olympic Games.&quot;

Iranian Olympic team chairman Nassrollah Sajadi told the &quot;Sharq&quot; newspaper that the government should give the athlete a $115,000 bonus for his actions, the same amount it gave to gold medalists.

Miresmaeili&#x27;s disqualification resulted in Vaks being awarded a bye into the 2nd round, where he was defeated by Algerian judoka Amar Meridja.

<doc id="909964" wikidata="Q7689692" url="?curid=909964" title="Taxpayer Bill of Rights">
<text>The Taxpayer Bill of Rights (abbreviated TABOR) is a concept advocated by conservative and free market libertarian groups, primarily in the United States, as a way of limiting the growth of government. It is not a charter of rights but a provision requiring that increases in overall tax revenue be tied to inflation and population increases unless larger increases are approved by referendum.

==1992 Colorado amendment==
In 1992, the voters of the state approved a measure which amended Article X of the Colorado Constitution that restricts revenues for all levels of government (state, local, and schools). Under TABOR, state and local governments cannot raise tax rates without voter approval and cannot spend revenues collected under existing tax rates without voter approval if revenues grow faster than the rate of inflation and population growth. Revenue in excess of the TABOR limit, commonly referred to as the &quot;TABOR surplus&quot;, must be refunded to taxpayers, unless voters approve a revenue change as an offset in a referendum. Under TABOR, the state has returned more than $2 billion to taxpayers.

The allowance for spending to grow at the rate of inflation plus population growth means that inflation-adjusted per capita spending generally did not decrease. However, spending growth could be interrupted due to an economic recession, in which case inflation-adjusted per capita spending decreased—and TABOR did not permit inflation-adjusted per capita spending to return to its pre-recession level. This was known as the &quot;ratchet-down effect&quot;, and it occurred in FY2001–02 and FY2002–03. The ratchet-down effect was desirable to those who believed government was consuming too large a fraction of Colorado&#x27;s gross state product (GSP).

In November 2005, Coloradans approved Referendum C, a ballot measure that loosened many of TABOR&#x27;s restrictions. This measure allowed the state to retain and spend money from existing revenue sources above the TABOR limit each year beginning in FY 2005–06 for five years through FY 2009–10. Beginning in FY 2010–11, the state was allowed to spend revenue above the TABOR limit up to a capped amount known as the &quot;Referendum C cap. The Referendum C cap grows from the prior year&#x27;s cap instead of the prior year&#x27;s spending by inflation plus population growth. In effect, Referendum C eliminated the ratchet-down effect.

Any retained Referendum C revenue (revenue above the allowable TABOR limit but below the Referendum C cap) is statutorily required to be spent on health care, education, firefighter and police retirement plans, and strategic transportation projects. Colorado Legislative Council staff reported in 2009 that the state would have faced a significant budget shortfall had Referendum C not passed. Therefore, in many instances the Referendum C money that has been spent is not new money to programs, rather it maintained the programs and prevented them from undergoing cuts. It is money the programs may not have received without Referendum C, but it is not additional money when compared with prior years. However, the report also admits that it is impossible to enumerate this impact because it would require knowledge of what budgetary actions the state would have taken had Referendum C failed. Referendum C and other attempts to mitigate the effects of TABOR are referred to as &quot;de-Brucing&quot; after Douglas Bruce, the author of the amendment. The effects of TABOR on government spending and economic growth has been a popular discussion topic in recent years. Proponents accredit much of Colorado&#x27;s economic prosperity in the period immediately following adoption of the law to the limit and its effect on government spending and taxes. 

When Colorado voters passed the law that legalized marijuana, the voters approved using tax money generated from marijuana sales for schools, police, and drug education. As of April 2015, projections for marijuana tax revenue for Colorado were at $58 million, but it was unclear at that time whether the additional revenue would have to be returned to taxpayers due to the provisions in the state&#x27;s Taxpayer Bill of Rights.

===Advocates===
Douglas Bruce is a conservative activist, former legislator, and convicted felon in the U.S. state of Colorado, most widely known for being the author of Colorado&#x27;s Taxpayer Bill of Rights (TABOR). A strict advocate for limited government, Bruce wrote and promoted TABOR.

Advocates like Bruce see the experience of Colorado as an example of the positive effects of tax decreases. They cite the fact that Colorado&#x27;s rate of economic growth in the dozen or so years after this system was implemented was well in excess of that of the U.S. as a whole. They also say that deciding tax increases in referendums is more democratic, as legislators may be beholden to lobby groups, special interests, and lobbyists.

One prominent advocacy group in favor of TABOR is Americans for Prosperity. Many of their 20 state chapters are currently working on plans to implement TABOR in their respective states. In Florida, AFP lobbied the Taxation and Budget Reform Committee to place a TABOR on the November 2008 ballot. And in Texas, AFP spearheaded the Taxpayer Protection Act concept of giving taxpayers greater control over how much government taxpayers want and are willing to pay for. It was also on the 2008 Republican Primary Ballot as a nonbinding initiative.

Many advocates of a more libertarian view, such as Americans for Limited Government, say that reduced taxation is a noble goal for its own sake, leading to increases in financial freedom and economic prosperity. Others note that Colorado has continued growth as well as larger tax revenues concurrent with the TABOR act.

The TABOR Foundation has partnered with Mountain States Legal Foundation to sue to enforce TABOR in Colorado, challenging that vehicle registration fees and other fees enacted without a vote of the people are actually taxes. MSLF has also sued on behalf of the Colorado Union of Taxpayers Foundation&#x27;s members, challenging the City of Aspen&#x27;s grocery bag tax.

===Opponents===

Opponents argue that the lack of tax revenue has hurt Colorado in many ways. For instance, Colorado ranks 48th in the nation for higher education funding (per personal income level), which is the lowest in 40 years, representing a drop from 34th in 1992. 

Opponents also argue that Colorado&#x27;s economic growth has largely been despite – not because of – this system, and is a result of changing societal desires for open spaces, outdoor sports opportunities, and other &quot;quality of life&quot; issues that are now imperiled by Colorado&#x27;s inability to provide expanding governmental services. They point out that almost 90% of state tax revenues are now already earmarked for various purposes, handicapping the state legislature and giving it very little flexibility.

They also add that the process has not been as &quot;democratic&quot; as its advocates purport, citing the off-year voting and complex wording that may skew results. Some opponents claim that complicated tax decisions are best decided by deliberation based on well-informed argument and informed consent, such as presumably occurs in legislatures, rather than the simplistic and emotionally charged appeals that tend to dominate referendums.

Many others argue against the &quot;Population Plus Inflation&quot; formula, because
# Population: public service are focused on populations (e.g. senior citizens, children, ... ) whose number do not run parallel with the population of the state as a whole. For example, the population in Florida is expected to increase by 27% over the next 20 years, but the senior citizen population is expected to increase by 87%.
# Inflation: public services are services, and services as a whole have a higher rate of increase than consumer inflation.

=== Repeal efforts ===
Over the years, TABOR opponents have tried to challenge it in various ways. A federal lawsuit was filed in May 2011, which dragged through the courts for years. In May 2017, the U.S. District Court ruled the plaintiffs didn&#x27;t have standing to sue, but in July 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed that decision, allowing the lawsuit to proceed. In early 2015, former Governor Roy Romer, offering then-Governor John Hickenlooper advice for his new term, said he should lead the charge to repeal TABOR. Gov. Hickenlooper smiled and applauded but did not respond at the event; however, a few weeks later, he said such a move would be doomed. The Denver Post editorial board, which opposed TABOR in 1992, ran an editorial in February 2017 titled &quot;Make Colorado greater: Fix TABOR&quot;, in which they offered three reasons why an outright repeal wasn&#x27;t realistic, but suggested three possible workarounds.

==TABOR in other states==

Reforms similar to Colorado&#x27;s have been put forward in several states. In 2006, two Libertarian groups financially backed by New York real estate developer Howie Rich campaigned for laws similar to TABOR in eight states.

Measures similar to the &quot;Taxpayer Bill of Rights&quot; are more likely to be adopted on the county and municipal level than on a statewide basis beyond Colorado; one municipality adopting the plan in recent years has been Spring Hill, Tennessee. After the November 2005 setback for proponents in Colorado, advocates in many regions are now downplaying the name &quot;Taxpayer Bill of Rights&quot; in favor of other terms such as &quot;Spending Limitation Movement&quot;. Organizations dedicated to shrinking government are pushing for the adoption of TABORs in other states. Currently, Colorado is the only state with TABOR. In 2005, TABOR proposals were introduced in about half of the states. A TABOR referendum on the ballot in Maine as an initiative effort led by Mary Adams was defeated in November 2006. Similar referendums were also defeated in Nebraska and Oregon that year. Similar initiatives in Maine and Washington were defeated in 2009.

In North Carolina, some Republicans want a constitutional amendment to limit growth in spending to population growth and the rate of inflation.

==National legislation==
The concept is connected to several laws that have been passed. Examples include the &quot;Omnibus Taxpayer Bill of Rights&quot; (Subtitle J of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988), the Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 passed in 1996, and the Taxpayer Bill of Rights III passed in 1998.

Nationally, Members of Congress have made attempts to give taxpayers more rights in terms of tax debts and interactions with the IRS. Congressman Pete Roskam (R-IL) introduced a bill in the House of Representatives called the Taxpayer Bill of Rights (H.R. 1058). 11 Republicans cosponsored the bill. The bill would require that the IRS provide people with quality service; people would only have to pay the correct amount of their taxes owed; the IRS would be required to implement better customer service; and people would have a &quot;voice&quot; in the process when challenging an IRS ruling.

==IRS Taxpayer Bill of Rights==
The IRS has offered its own version of a taxpayer bill of rights since the year 2014. Describing the rights, the IRS has written, &quot;Each and every taxpayer has a set of fundamental rights they should be aware of when dealing with the IRS. Explore your rights and our obligations to protect them.&quot; The rights are available to the public online in a document called &quot;Publication 1: Your Rights as a Taxpayer&quot;. To help people understand their rights when dealing with the IRS, the IRS has an independent agency within the IRS called the Taxpayer Advocate Service.

==1989 Illinois law==

The &quot;Taxpayers&#x27; Bill of Rights Act&quot; (20 ILCS 2520), is a provision of Illinois state law. It is broken up into seven sections throughout the act. Section 1 is stating the name of the act. Section 2 is Legislative Declaration and states &quot;The General Assembly further finds that the Illinois tax system is based largely on self-assessment.&quot; Section 2 also states &quot;The General Assembly finds and declares that taxes are the most sensitive point of contact between citizens and their government.&quot; Section 4 explains &quot;the Department of Revenue shall have the following powers and duties to protect the rights of taxpayers,&quot; and list 10 different responsibilities the government has. Section 5 is the taxpayer&#x27;s suits. It says &quot;Taxpayers have the right to sue the Department of Revenue if such Department intentionally or recklessly disregards tax laws or regulations in collecting taxes&quot; Section 6 is the review of liens, and section 7 is dedicated to the cost.

<text>Southworth is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) on Puget Sound in Kitsap County, Washington, United States. It is best known for being the west end of the Fauntleroy-Vashon Island-Southworth Washington State Ferries run. Landmarks include Southworth Grocery, a US Post Office, ferry terminal, clay cliffs and a private beach on the point. Next to the ferry is a popular place to launch kayaks for trips to nearby Blake Island. The population of the Southworth CDP was 2,185 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==

<text>Yazid Sufaat (born 20 January 1964), also known as Yazud bin Sufaat or Yazid Shufaat, is a Malaysian member of the extremist Islamist terrorist organisation Jemaah Islamiyah from shortly after its foundation in 1993 until his arrest by Malaysian authorities in December 2001. His speciality had been to develop anthrax as a weapon of bio-terrorism on behalf of the terror group al-Qaeda. Released in 2008, he was again detained on terrorist charges in Malaysia in 2013.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Sufaat was born in Johor Lama, Malaysia on 20 January 1964. In 1987, he graduated from California State University, Sacramento with a degree in biochemistry. He then served in the Malaysian army as a medical technician, rising to the rank of captain.

===Terrorist career===
Sufaat is now believed to be one of al-Qaeda&#x27;s main anthrax researchers. In 1993 Sufaat set up a pathology laboratory called Green Laboratory Medicine, at which he subsequently tried to weaponise anthrax on behalf of al-Qaeda. From 5 to 8 January 2000, a major meeting of al-Qaeda and JI personnel was held in Kuala Lumpur; four of those who attended stayed with Sufaat at his home. He is also suspected of providing employment documents to Zacarias Moussaoui, and providing lodging for two of the 11 September hijackers, namely Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi.

From the 9/11 Commission report:

The al-Qaeda-JI partnership yielded a number of proposals that would marry al-Qaeda&#x27;s financial and technical strengths with JI&#x27;s access to materials and local operatives. Here, Hambali played the critical role of coordinator, as he distributed al-Qaeda funds earmarked for joint operations. In one especially notable example, Atef turned to Hambali when al-Qaeda needed a scientist to take over its biological weapons program. Hambali obliged by introducing a U.S.-educated JI member, Yazid Sufaat, to Ayman al-Zawahiri in Kandahar. In 2001, Sufaat would spend several months attempting to cultivate anthrax for al-Qaeda in a laboratory he helped set up near the Kandahar airport.

Sufaat, through his company Green Laboratory Medicine, acquired four tonnes of ammonium nitrate for JI/MILF bomb-maker Fathur Rahman al-Ghozi. The intended bombing spree in Singapore (see Singapore embassies attack plot) was averted by the arrests in Singapore on 9 December 2001 and the capture of al-Ghozi in the Philippines the following month.

At the time of the 9/11 attacks, Sufaat was still in Afghanistan whence he fled via Pakistan to Malaysia where he was soon apprehended. He is still wanted by the United States in connection with 9/11.

His assets, under the name of Yazud bin Sufaat, were frozen on 5 September 2003 by the US Treasury&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Four days later, under the name Yazid Sufaat, he was embargoed by the United Nations Security Council Committee 1267 as an affiliate of al-Qaeda and the Taliban. His expired Malaysian passport carries number A10472263. As of April 2007 he was being held in the Kamuting prison under Malaysia&#x27;s Internal Security Act (ISA), but he was released with no advanced notification by the Malaysian Government on 10 December 2008 with the Home Minister claiming that he was &quot;sufficiently reformed&quot;. In early 2013, Sufaat was detained for a second time in Malaysia under the Security Offences (Special Measures) Act, the successor legislation for the ISA, for the recruitment of new members for the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. He was then sentenced for 4 years in prison where he was imprisoned at Tapah Prison. 

In December 2017, he was re-arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2015 (POTA) after the Malaysian authorities found that he had been recruiting fellow inmates for al-Qaeda while he was in prison. As the allowed for the detention of a suspect without trial for two years, he was then released from the Simpang Renggam detention Centre on 19 November 2019. His release was decided by the Prevention of Terrorism Board and he was required to wear an electronic monitoring device and placed under house arrest.

Yazid was also required to be within the Bandar Ampang area in Hulu Langat and he was required to report at the Ampang police station twice a week, and he could only leave the designated area with a written permission from the Selangor police chief.

<text>Jason Rosanoff Cropper (born June 27, 1971) is an American musician. He was a founding member and the former guitarist of the American alternative rock band Weezer, prior to his firing before the release of their self-titled debut album.
==Biography==
===Weezer===
Cropper was the original rhythm guitarist for Weezer, and as such was present at the band&#x27;s first official band practice on February 14, 1992. He recorded on the band&#x27;s first three official demo tapes prior to their signing to Geffen Records.

During the recording of their debut album, &quot;Weezer&quot; (aka &quot;The Blue Album&quot;) in 1993, Cropper learned that Amy Wellner, his girlfriend in Los Angeles, was pregnant. The ramifications of this news started affecting Cropper&#x27;s personality and disrupting the band&#x27;s working environment. When Wellner showed up unannounced in New York with no place to stay, Rivers Cuomo considered it the final straw and informed Cropper that he had to leave the band. Weezer collaborator Karl Koch said: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t handling it well ... he always said he was fine, and then 20 minutes later he&#x27;d be up on the roof of Electric Lady screaming or something.&quot; According to Cropper, lead singer Rivers Cuomo told him he could not allow him to jeopardize the band&#x27;s work and asked him to leave. He was replaced by guitarist Brian Bell.

In 2014, Cropper said Cuomo had made the right decision, later remarking that he felt &quot;weird to be this generation&#x27;s Syd Barrett or Pete Best. But it&#x27;s pretty cool too.&quot; In 2019, he said he believed Cuomo fired him mainly because of his relationship with his girlfriend, who visited the band while they recorded in New York, defying Cuomo&#x27;s &quot;no-girlfriends-while-we’re-recording&quot; rule. Bassist Matt Sharp said the decision was not triggered by a single event, but instead a series of &quot;tiny infractions&quot; that threatened the band&#x27;s chemistry. Cuomo felt that if they were going to change the band, they had to do it before they released their first album and shot the album cover. Cropper received a credit on &quot;My Name Is Jonas&quot; for writing the intro.

The song &quot;Jamie&quot;, featured on the 1994 &quot;DGC Rarities, Vol. 1&quot; compilation, was recorded in 1993 and features Cropper on guitar and backing vocals. Prior to the expanded deluxe edition of &quot;The Blue Album&quot; in 2004, this was the only Weezer track released to feature Cropper on guitar and backing vocals.

Despite being fired from the band, Cropper has remained friends with the other members of Weezer and attended Rivers Cuomo&#x27;s wedding in 2006.

===Post-Weezer===

After Cropper left Weezer, he and his then wife, Amy Wellner Cropper, formed the band Chopper One. The pair (along with drummer Tyrone Rio) released the single &quot;Free Lunch&quot; in 1995, followed by the album &quot;Now Playing&quot; in 1997.

In January 1994, their first child daughter Kiefer Rain Cropper, was born. Their son Jake Hudson Cropper, was born in 1999, and another daughter Devon Jade Cropper, was born in 2001. The couple divorced in 2004–2005.

In 1996, Cropper played guitar on &quot;Uncle Bob&quot;, an alt-rock album from 22 Jacks, which featured members of Wax, The Ramones, Adolescents and Agent Orange.

===2000s===

After Chopper One ended, Cropper started the pop punk supergroup Fliptop self-releasing a 5-track EP. The band consisted of Cropper on vocals, guitars and piano, Dallan Baumgarten on guitars &amp; vocals, Scott Shiflett on bass and Josh Freese on drums. The band played live shows around LA, and some local Warped Tour Shows.

Cropper sang the theme song for the 2002–2003 American sitcom &quot;Andy Richter Controls the Universe&quot; and in early 2006 began showing signs of returning to the music business. In addition to posting songs on his MySpace page, he started recording and producing bands, including the Atlanta-based rock band Buffalo Alice, producing their second album &quot;Mitchell&quot; (2007) and credited for writing at least one song and playing guitar and singing on several songs. He continued to contribute to Buffalo Alice, co-writing and producing their third album &quot;Alexander Rosenhoff Testament: A Work Of Fiction&quot; (2008), and was listed for a time as bass player on the band&#x27;s website.

===2010s–2020s===
In 2018, Cropper performed with Cuomo at two separate shows in San Francisco, in their first collaboration since Cropper&#x27;s departure from Weezer.

In April 2020, Cropper appeared on Cuomo&#x27;s &quot;Island in the Zoom&quot; shows. Also in April 2020, Cropper appeared on two episodes of the &quot;We&#x27;z Talkin&#x27; Weez&#x27; 2 Thee&quot; podcast; one playing and discussing new music and the other breaking down Weezer&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Album&quot; track by track. Throughout 2020, Cropper performed livestreams on Facebook called &quot;The Golden Hour.&quot; In July 2020, Cropper released his solo debut single &quot;Goodness Knows&quot;.

In 2021, Weezer released their fifteenth album, &quot;Van Weezer&quot;, and the vinyl edition included the bonus track &quot;I&#x27;ve Thrown It All Away&quot; which was a re-recorded version of a song the band had demoed when Cropper was still in the band. He also has a writing credit on the track.

<text>All Is True is a 2018 British historical film directed by Kenneth Branagh and written by Ben Elton. It stars Branagh as playwright William Shakespeare. The film takes its title from an alternative name for Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;.

==Plot==
After the Globe Theatre burns down in 1613 during a performance of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, William Shakespeare, aged 49, returns home from London to Stratford-upon-Avon to rejoin his wife, Anne Hathaway. Shakespeare and Anne have a distant relationship, as he has spent most of their marriage working in London, and she is a down-to-earth country woman who cannot read or write. Their marriage has never recovered from the death of their son Hamnet, aged 11, of plague in Stratford, while his father was in London. While they also have two daughters, Hamnet was Shakespeare’s favourite child, especially because of the poems which he believes the child wrote. Shakespeare now devotes his time to tending to the family garden. In spite of his hard work he is not very successful.

The Shakespeares&#x27; elder daughter Susanna is married to a doctor named John Hall, who is a prominent Puritan in town. Susanna has to stifle her independence and her own personality to live by her husband&#x27;s moral codes. She is accused of committing adultery and faces a public trial. Shakespeare terrifies her accuser by claiming that he knows an African actor who was once in love with Susanna and who would kill anyone who ruined her good name. The accuser fails to attend the hearing, as a consequence of which Susanna is acquitted. Anne is impressed by her husband&#x27;s actions, especially as she knows that he was lying; the African actor was a gentle person who would never harm anyone.

Shakespeare&#x27;s younger daughter, Judith (Hamnet&#x27;s twin), is outspoken in her doubts about the role of women in Jacobean England. She has not been allowed to have an education or opportunities in life, because it is expected she will marry and provide children. She has refused to marry and is bitter at her father for not loving her as much as her dead brother. One night during an argument, Judith confesses to Shakespeare that it was she who wrote the poems, rather than her brother. They were in Hamnet&#x27;s handwriting because Judith cannot read or write and dictated them to him. Anne agrees that Hamnet was not especially intelligent; they have hidden this from Shakespeare so he would be able to keep his fond memories.

The Shakespeares receive a visit from the Earl of Southampton, Shakespeare&#x27;s former literary patron, to whom he wrote his 154 sonnets. This upsets Anne; she is aware of rumours that William and Southampton were lovers. While drinking with Southampton, Shakespeare recites his Sonnet 29, expressing his feelings for Southampton and hoping that Southampton felt the same way about him. Southampton cuts off the conversation and seems uncomfortable but as he leaves he also recites Sonnet 29, indicating to Shakespeare that he did have feelings for him.

After some time at home, Shakespeare and Anne grow closer and develop a mature relationship. Anne ultimately allows her husband to sleep with her in the family&#x27;s second-best bed (the best bed is reserved for guests). Having fallen back in love with Anne, Shakespeare amends his will to make sure that she will receive this bed. Now that the truth has been told about the poems, Judith also develops a warmer relationship with her father. She agrees to marry a local man, Thomas Quiney, who has been her suitor for some time. Quiney&#x27;s reputation is damaged when his former sweetheart gives birth to his illegitimate child and the baby and mother die during labour. Judith becomes pregnant by Quiney, much to Shakespeare&#x27;s delight.

While researching, Shakespeare discovers that there was no notable plague outbreak in 1596, the year that Hamnet died. He becomes suspicious and questions his family. Anne tries to convince him that Hamnet died of plague but Judith confesses the truth. One day as a child, Judith told her brother that she was going to reveal the truth to their father, that Hamnet did not write the poems. That night, Hamnet went missing. He was found in a nearby pond, having drowned, with the copies of the poems in the water with him. Hamnet would never normally enter the pond and so Anne and Judith suspect he committed suicide. The women covered it up, and told everyone that the boy had died of plague. Although it is an emotional revelation, the truth allows Shakespeare to finally come to terms with his son&#x27;s death and to accept a more honest memory of the boy.

In April 1616 Shakespeare&#x27;s fellow playwright Ben Jonson visits him and they reminisce about their lives. On the 23rd of April, Shakespeare&#x27;s fifty-second birthday, he is feeling unwell. His wife and daughters gather to present him with a surprise. Susanna has been teaching Anne and Judith how to read and write. Susanna has found the Shakespeares&#x27; marriage certificate and Anne finally signs her name, where previously she had only been able to sign with an &quot;X&quot;. Shakespeare dies that day. At his funeral, the three women recite the song &quot;Fear No More&quot; from Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. They are now all able to read.

<doc id="909991" wikidata="Q96075490" url="?curid=909991" title="Evidence and documentation for the Holocaust">
<text>The Holocaust—the murder of about six million Jews by Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1945—is the most-documented genocide in history. Although there is no single document which lists the names of all Jewish victims of Nazi persecution, there is conclusive evidence that about six million Jews were murdered. There is also conclusive evidence that Jews were gassed at Auschwitz-Birkenau, the Operation Reinhard extermination camps, and in gas vans, and that there was a systematic plan by the Nazi leadership to murder them.

Evidence for the Holocaust comes in four main varieties:

*Contemporary documents, including a wide variety of &quot;letters, memos, blueprints, orders, bills, speeches&quot;; Holocaust train schedules and statistical summaries generated by the SS; and photographs, including official photographs, clandestine photographs by survivors, aerial photographs, and film footage of the liberation of the camps. More than 3,000 tons of records were collected for the Nuremberg trials.
*Later testimony from tens of thousands of eyewitnesses, including survivors such as &quot;Sonderkommandos,&quot; who directly witnessed the extermination process; perpetrators such as Nazi leaders, SS guards, and Nazi concentration camp commandants; and local townspeople. Moreover, virtually none of the perpetrators put on trial denied the reality of the systematic murder, with the most common excuse (where one was given) being that they were just following orders.
*Material evidence in the form of concentration and extermination camps, which still exist with various amounts of the original structure preserved, and thousands of mass graves containing the corpses of Holocaust victims.
*Circumstantial evidence: during World War II, the population of Jews in German-occupied Europe was reduced by about six million. About 2.7 million Jews were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau, Kulmhof extermination camp, and the Operation Reinhard camps never to be seen or heard from again.

The perpetrators attempted to avoid creating explicit evidence and they also tried to destroy the documentary and material evidence of their crimes before the German defeat. Nevertheless, much of the evidence was preserved and collected by Allied investigators during and after the war, and the overwhelming evidence of the crimes ultimately made such erasure attempts futile. Collectively, the evidence refutes the arguments of Holocaust deniers that the Holocaust did not occur as described in historical scholarship.

==Hitler&#x27;s involvement==
=== Policy ===

Historians, including Ian Kershaw, Raul Hilberg, and Martin Broszat, indicate that no document exists showing that Hitler ordered the Holocaust. However, other evidence makes clear that Hitler knew about and ordered the genocide. Statements from top-ranking Nazis such as Adolf Eichmann, Joseph Goebbels, and Heinrich Himmler also indicate that Hitler orchestrated the Holocaust and statements from Hitler himself reveal his genocidal intentions toward Jewry.

===Order and responsibility===

In a draft of an internal memorandum, dated 18 September 1942, Reichsfuhrer SS Heinrich Himmler wrote that &quot;in principle the Fuehrer&#x27;s time is no longer to be burdened with these matters&quot;; the memorandum goes on to outline Himmler&#x27;s vision, including &quot;The delivery of anti-social elements from the execution of their sentences to the Reich Fuehrer of SS to be worked to death. Persons under protective arrest, Jews, Gypsies, Russians and Ukrainians, Poles with more than 3-year sentences, Czechs and Germans with more than 8-year sentences according to the judgement of the Minister of Justice Thierack]. First of all, the worst anti-social elements amongst those just mentioned are to be handed over; I shall inform the Fuhrer of this through Reichsleiter Bormann.&quot;

Nevertheless, and in contrast to the T4 euthanasia program, no document written or signed by Hitler ordering the Holocaust has ever been found. Deniers have claimed that this lack of order shows genocide was not Nazi policy.

During David Irving&#x27;s unsuccessful libel action against Deborah Lipstadt, he indicated that he considered a document signed by Hitler ordering the &#x27;Final Solution&#x27; would be the only convincing proof of Hitler&#x27;s responsibility. He was, however, described as content to accuse Winston Churchill of responsibility for ordering the assassination of General Sikorski, despite having no documentary evidence to support his claim. Mr Justice Gray concluded that this was a double standard.

Historians have documented evidence that as Germany&#x27;s defeat became imminent and the Nazi leaders realized that they would most likely be captured and brought to trial, a great effort to destroy all of the evidence of mass extermination was made. In the spring of 1942, Himmler ordered all of the traces of murdered Russian Jews and all of the traces of murdered prisoners of war to be removed from the occupied territories of the Soviet Union. As one of many examples, the bodies of the 25,000 mostly Latvian Jews whom Friedrich Jeckeln and the soldiers under his command had shot at Rumbula (near Riga) in late 1941 were dug up and burned in 1943.

In mid-1942, Reinhard Heydrich, through Heinrich Mueller, Chief of the Gestapo, ordered Paul Blobel in &quot;Sonderaktion&quot; 1005 to remove all traces of the mass executions in the East carried out by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. After Blobel and his staff developed a special incineration process, destruction of evidence at Belzec and Sobibor followed in late 1942. In February 1943, Himmler personally visited Treblinka and ordered the commandants to destroy records, crematoria, and other signs of mass extermination.

In the Posen speeches of October 1943, Himmler explicitly referred to the extermination of the Jews of Europe and further stated that the genocide must be permanently kept secret. On 4 October, he said:
Historian Peter Longerich states that Hitler &quot;avoided giving a clear written order to exterminate Jewish civilians&quot;. Wide protest was evoked when Hitler&#x27;s authorisation of the T4 program became public knowledge in Germany, and he was forced to put a halt to it as a result (nonetheless it continued discreetly). This made Hitler realise that such undertakings must be done secretly in order to avoid criticism. Critics also point out that if Hitler did sign such an order in the first place, it would have been one of the first documents to be destroyed. 

Evidence of a verbal order from Hitler includes a handwritten note by Himmler on a meeting with Hitler at the Wolfsschanze on 18 December 1941, which read: &quot;Jewish Question; to be exterminated as partisans&quot;. Historians have argued that this indicates Hitler gave a verbal order to Himmler at this meeting for the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; to target Jews under the guise of anti-partisan warfare.

According to Felix Kersten&#x27;s memoirs, Himmler told him that the extermination of the Jews was expressly ordered by Hitler and had been delegated to Himmler.

====According to Nazis====
Many statements from the Nazis from 1941 onwards addressed the imminent extermination of the Jews.

In a draft of an internal memorandum, dated 25 October 1941, Heinrich Himmler wrote:

Joseph Goebbels had frequent discussions with Hitler about the fate of the Jews, a subject which they discussed almost every time they met, and frequently wrote about it in his personal diary. In his personal diary he wrote:

*14 February 1942: &quot;The Führer once again expressed his determination to clean up the Jews in Europe pitilessly. There must be no squeamish sentimentalism about it. The Jews have deserved the catastrophe that has now overtaken them. Their destruction will go hand in hand with the destruction of our enemies. We must hasten this process with cold ruthlessness.&quot;
*27 March 1942: &quot;A judgment is being visited upon the Jews that, while barbaric, is fully deserved by them. The prophecy which the Führer made about them for having brought on a new world war is beginning to come true in a most terrible manner. One must not be sentimental in these matters. If we did not fight the Jews, they would destroy us. It&#x27;s a life-and-death struggle between the Aryan race and the Jewish bacillus.&quot;

In November 1941, Goebbels published an article &quot;The Jews are to blame&quot; which returned to Hitler&#x27;s prophecy of 1939 and stated that world Jewry was suffering a &quot;gradual process of extermination&quot;.

On 13 March 1945, Goebbels wrote in his diary that the &quot;rest of the world&quot; should follow Germany&#x27;s example in &quot;destroying the Jews&quot;, he wrote also about how the Jews in Germany at that point had been almost totally destroyed. This diary contains numerous other references to the mass extermination of Jews, including how &quot;tens of thousands of them are liquidated&quot; in eastern occupied territory, and that &quot;the greater the number of Jews liquidated, the more consolidated will the situation in Europe be after this war.&quot; When speaking about this document under oath, David Irving is quoted as saying &quot;There is no explicit reference...to the liquidation of Jews&quot; and critics of Holocaust denial consequently state that it is dishonest to say such a thing when it is entirely contradicted by the diary of one of Hitler&#x27;s closest associates.

When questioned by interrogators if orders for the extermination of Jews were delegated in writing by Himmler, Adolf Eichmann states:
Critics state that Eichmann gives a virtually identical account of this in his memoirs, and state that it is also asserted that Eichmann never even asked for a written order, on the basis that &quot;Hitler&#x27;s wish as expressed through Himmler and Heydrich was good enough for him&quot;. Eichmann&#x27;s memoirs were recorded by Willem Sassen before he was captured, and Eichmann&#x27;s lawyer tried to prevent them from being presented as evidence to avoid any detriment against his case.

In a speech, David Irving states that Heydrich told Eichmann, &quot;The Führer has given the order for the physical destruction of the Jews&quot;. Irving admits that this contradicts his view that &quot;Hitler wasn&#x27;t involved&quot;, but explains it by suggesting that a completely different meaning can be construed, i.e. &quot;the extirpation of Judaism&quot; as opposed to the physical destruction of Jews if one changes &quot;just one or two words&quot;. Critics of this view state that historians should not change words if their documents contradict their claims, and consequently point out five instances where Eichmann unambiguously states &quot;physical extermination&quot; during his interrogation.

At a conference in 1941 discussing the Jewish Question, Alfred Rosenberg said:
At the Einsatzgruppen Trial in 1947, SS-&quot;Obersturmbannfuhrer&quot; Martin Sandberger recalled that his superior, SS-&quot;Gruppenfuhrer&quot; Bruno Streckenbach, had informed him and other &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; commanders of an order from Hitler to eliminate all Jews in the Eastern Territories at a meeting at the Palais Prinz Albrecht in 1941.

Rudolf Höss, commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp, wrote a series of memoirs about his role in the Holocaust while awaiting execution after the war. In these memoirs Höss stated that Himmler had briefed him about the Final Solution and his role in it in summer 1941; during the meeting, Himmler told him that the order for the Final Solution came directly from Hitler.

===Awareness===

Congruent with the evidence that shows Hitler was responsible for the order to murder Jews, there is also evidence that shows he was made aware of the process. Gestapo Chief Heinrich Müller sent a telegram on 2 August 1941, ordering that &quot;especially interesting illustrative&quot; material should be sent to Berlin because, &quot;the Führer should be presented with continuous reports on the work of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in the East from here&quot;. At the end of December 1942 Hitler received a document from Himmler entitled, &quot;Report to the Führer on Combating Partisans&quot;, stating that 363,211 Jews had been murdered by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in August–November 1942. This document was specifically printed in large font that Hitler could read without glasses and was marked &quot;Shown to the Führer&quot;.

==Himmler&#x27;s speeches and &quot;Ausrottung&quot;==
Critics of Holocaust denial state that the claim by deniers of no Nazi plan to exterminate the Jews is completely discredited by Himmler in a speech made on 4 October 1943 to a gathering of SS officers in Poznań, where he said:


==Use of gas chambers==


Despite the difficulty of finding traces of this material, in February 1990, Professor Jan Markiewicz, Director of the Institute of Forensic Research in Kraków, redid the analysis. Markiewicz and his team used microdiffusion techniques to test for cyanide in samples from the suspected gas chambers, from delousing chambers, and from control areas elsewhere within Auschwitz. The control samples tested negative, while cyanide residue was found in high concentrations in the delousing chambers, and lower concentrations in the homicidal gas chambers. This is consistent with the amounts required to kill lice and humans.

The search for cyanide in the bricks of buildings said to have been gas chambers was important, because the pesticide Zyklon B would generate such a residue. This was the gas most often cited as the murder instrument for prisoners in the gas chambers, supported by both testimony and evidence collected of Nazi policy.

Another claim made by Holocaust deniers is that there were no specially-constructed vents in the gas chambers through which Zyklon B could be released. The BBC offers a response showing that this requires disregard of much documentation:

Deniers have said for years that physical evidence is lacking because they have seen no holes in the roof of the Birkenau gas chamber where the Zyklon was poured in. (In some of the gas chambers the Zyklon B was poured in through the roof, while in others it was thrown in through the windows.) The roof was dynamited at war&#x27;s end, and today lies broken in pieces, but three of the four original holes were positively identified in a recent paper. Their location in the concrete matches with eyewitness testimony, aerial photos from 1944, and a ground photo from 1943. The physical evidence shows unmistakably that the Zyklon holes were cast into the concrete when the building was constructed.

Cremation in the open at the Reinhard extermination camps (Treblinka, Sobibor and Belzec) was discussed at Nuremberg on 7 April 1946 by Georg Konrad Morgen, SS judge and lawyer who investigated crimes committed in Nazi concentration camps. He stated: &quot;The whole thing was like an assembly line. At the last stop they reached a big room, and were told that this was the bath. When the last one was in, the doors were shut and the gas was let into the room. As soon as death taken place in (&quot;sic&quot;), the ventilators were started. When the air was breathable, the doors were opened, and the Jewish workers removed the bodies. By means of a special process which Wirth had invented, they were burned in the open air without the use of fuel.&quot;

There is well-documented evidence that other ash was used as fertilizer in nearby fields. Photographs of Treblinka taken by the camp commandant show what looks to be ash piles being distributed by steam shovels.

The Nizkor Project and other sources have stated that the minimal concentration of Zyklon B to be explosive is 56,000 parts per million, while 300 parts per million is fatal to humans, as is evidenced in &quot;The Merck Index&quot; and the &quot;CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics&quot;. In fact, the Nazis&#x27; own documentation stated &quot;Danger of explosion: 75 grams of HCN in 1 cubic meter of air. Normal application approx. 8–10 grams per cubic meter, therefore not explosive.&quot;

The Institute for Historical Review publicly offered a reward of $50,000 for verifiable &quot;proof that gas chambers for the purpose of killing human beings existed at or in Auschwitz.&quot; Mel Mermelstein, a survivor of Auschwitz, submitted his own testimony as proof but it was ignored. He then sued IHR in the United States and the case was subsequently settled for $50,000, plus $40,000 in damages for personal suffering. The court declared the statement that &quot;Jews were gassed to death at the Auschwitz Concentration Camp in Poland during the summer of 1944&quot; was a fact.

==Victims==

===Six million===

The vast majority of scholars, institutions, and one Nazi official estimate between five and six million Jews perished during the Holocaust. With approximately 4.5 million Jewish victims&#x27; names collected by Yad Vashem, numerous documents and archives discovered after the war gave meticulous accounts of the exterminations that took place at the death camps (such as Auschwitz and Treblinka).

===Jewish population===
The 1932 &quot;American Jewish Yearbook&quot; estimates the total number of Jews in the world at 15,192,218, of whom 9,418,248 resided in Europe. However, the 1947 yearbook states: &quot;Estimates of the world Jewish population have been assembled by the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (except for the United States and Canada) and are probably the most authentic available at the present time. The figures reveal that the total Jewish population of the world has decreased by one-third from about 16,600,000 in 1939 to about 11,000,000 in 1946 as the result of the annihilation by the Nazis of more than five and a half million European Jews. In Europe only an estimated 3,642,000 remain of the total Jewish pre-war population of approximately 9,740,000.&quot; These numbers are also consistent with the findings of the Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry, Appendix III, in 1946.

===Nazi documentation===

The Nazis used figures of between 9 and 11 million for the Jewish population of Europe, as evidenced in the notes of the Wannsee Conference. In fact, the Nazis methodically recorded the ongoing reduction of the Jewish population, as in the Korherr Report, which gave the status of the Final Solution through December 1942. The Höfle Telegram was sent by Hermann Höfle on 11 January 1943 to Adolf Eichmann in Berlin and detailed the number of Jews murdered in the concentration camps. In the year 1942 alone, the telegram lists 1,274,166 Jews were exterminated in the four camps of Aktion Reinhard.

The Korherr Report, compiled by an SS statistician, gave a conservative total of 2,454,000 Jews deported to extermination camps or murdered by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. The complete status reports of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; death squads were found in the archives of the Gestapo when it was searched by the U.S. Army, and the accuracy attested to by the former &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; members who testified during war crime trials and at other times. These reports alone list an additional 1,500,000 or so murders during mass shootings, the vast majority of these victims were Jews. Further, surviving Nazi documentation spells out their plans to murder the Jews of Europe (see the Wannsee Conference), recorded the trains arriving at various death camps, and included photographs and films of many atrocities.

===Testimonies===
There are voluminous amounts of testimony from tens of thousands of survivors of the Holocaust, as well as the testimony of captured Nazi officers at the Nuremberg Trials and other times. Höss&#x27;s testimony did not consist of merely a signed confession; while in jail he also wrote two volumes of memoirs and gave extensive testimony outside of the Nuremberg proceedings. Further, his testimony agrees with that of other contemporary written accounts by Auschwitz officials, such as Pery Broad, an SS man stationed at Auschwitz while Höss was the commandant, and the diary kept by SS physician at Auschwitz Johann Kremer, as well as the testimony of hundreds of camp guards and victims. Auschwitz guard Reinhold Hanning even testified that it was common knowledge among camp personnel that &quot;the majority of people who arrived in the trains were killed&quot;. In addition, former SS personnel have criticised Holocaust denial. SS-&quot;Oberscharführer&quot; Josef Klehr said that anyone who maintains that nobody was gassed at Auschwitz must be &quot;crazy or on the wrong&quot;. &quot;SS-Unterscharführer&quot; Oswald Kaduk stated that he did not consider those who maintain such a thing as normal people. Karl Frenzel, a senior officer at the Sobibor extermination camp, stated in a 1983 interview that &quot;It is wrong to say that it never happened&quot; in reference to Jews being gassed at the camp. Hearing about Holocaust denial compelled former SS-&quot;Rottenführer&quot; Oskar Gröning to publicly speak about what he witnessed at Auschwitz, and denounce Holocaust deniers, stating:

Hans Münch, a former SS physician, signed a document certifying what he witnessed at Auschwitz: &quot;thousands of people gassed&quot;, and the usage of Zyklon B in gas chambers. According to Münch&#x27;s estimation, prisoners died within three to five minutes of exposure to Zyklon B. In an interview on Swedish television in 1981 Münch described the extermination process in detail and confirmed that &quot;special treatment&quot; in the context of Auschwitz referred to physical extermination.

During &quot;Fedorenko v. United States&quot;, a deportation case involving former Treblinka guard Feodor Fedorenko, he testified that he had been stationed in a guard tower overlooking the camp and admitted that the gas chambers were visible from this vantage point and that he had witnessed dead bodies being removed from the gas chambers on multiple occasions.

In the 1983 Holocaust documentary &quot;Shoah&quot;, &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Franz Suchomel, tricked into an interview with false promises of anonymity, described his time at the Treblinka extermination camp. Suchomel related to the interviewer, Claude Lanzmann, how he saw dead bodies being removed from the gas chambers during a tour of the camp before explaining in depth the extermination of Jews at the camp through both gassing and shooting.

&quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; provide another key piece of testimony. These were Jewish prisoners who helped march Jews to the gas chambers, and later dragged the bodies to the crematoria. Since they witnessed the entire process, their testimony is vital in confirming that the gas chambers were used for murderous purposes and the scale to which they were used.

Other key testimony comes from non-Jewish survivors of the camps such as Catholic French Resistance member André Rogerie who was held in seven different camps, and who as a member of the Resistance was not targeted for extermination but for hard labor and survived. After the war Rogerie wrote and testified extensively about his experiences in the camps including Auschwitz-Birkenau, where he viewed and produced the oldest contemporary sketch of a camp crematorium.

<text>The Park Row Building, also known as 15 Park Row, is a luxury apartment building and early skyscraper on Park Row in the Financial District of the New York City borough of Manhattan. The , 31-story building was designed by R. H. Robertson, a pioneer in steel skyscraper design, and engineered by the firm of Nathaniel Roberts. The Park Row Building includes 26 full floors, a partial 27th floor, and a pair of four-story cupolas. The architectural detail on the facade includes large columns and pilasters, as well as numerous ornamental overhanging balconies. J. Massey Rhind sculpted several ornamental details on the building, including the balconies and several figures atop the building.

The Park Row Building was developed by the Park Row Construction Company as an office building between 1897 and 1899. It used a steel frame and elevators to make it one of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings at the time. It was constructed over a period of two years and nine months. Upon completion, about 4,000 people worked at the Park Row Building, with tenants such as the Associated Press and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. Until the completion of the Singer Building in 1908, it was the city&#x27;s tallest building and the world&#x27;s tallest office building. The Park Row Building was used as an office structure until the early 2000s, when it was converted to residential use. Today, the Park Row Building consists of 339 luxury apartment units, two penthouse apartments, ground floor retail, and office suites located in the building&#x27;s historic cupola space.

Upon its completion, the Park Row Building received praise from the general public, although architectural critics reviewed the building more harshly. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission gave city landmark status to the Park Row Building in 1999, and the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

==Site==
The Park Row Building is in the Financial District of Manhattan, just south of New York City Hall, City Hall Park, and the Civic Center. Its primary address is 15 Park Row, but its other addresses include 13–21 Park Row, 13 Ann Street, and 3 Theatre Alley. The Park Row Building is bounded on the west by Park Row, on the south by Ann Street, and on the east by Theatre Alley; the main facade on Park Row is situated midway between Ann Street to the south and Beekman Street to the north. The building is situated on an irregularly shaped land lot, with none of the three facades connected to each other. The Park Row Building&#x27;s original developers had been unable to acquire the corner lots at Ann Street and Park Row and at Ann Street and Theatre Alley.

The building has a frontage of on Park Row, on Ann Street, and on Theatre Alley. The base of the building covers a land area of approximately . It is immediately adjacent to 25 Park Row to the northeast. Other nearby buildings include 5 Beekman Street to the east, the Woolworth Building to the north, St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel to the west, and the Bennett Building to the south. In addition, 41 Park Row, 150 Nassau Street, the Morse Building, and the Potter Building are across Beekman Street to the northeast.

==Architecture==
The building was designed by R. H. Robertson, a pioneer in steel skyscraper design, and engineered by the firm of Nathaniel Roberts. Roberts&#x27;s chief draftsman, George Shea Dayton, was also highly involved in the design. John Downey was hired as the general contractor; T. P. Galligan was the foundation contractor; J,B. &amp; J.M. Cornell were the iron contractors; and Dawson and Archer were the masonry contractors. The total cost to build the skyscraper was $2.4–2.75 million (equivalent to $– million in ).

The building has 26 full floors, a partial 27th floor, and a pair of four-story towers on the 28th through 31st floors. It has a total height of . Counting the flagpoles that were formerly installed atop the towers, the total height upon the building&#x27;s completion was , making it one of the world&#x27;s tallest buildings at the time. There were also two basement levels. This gives the building a total of 33 habitable levels.

=== Form and facade ===
The ground level of 15 Park Row occupies its entire lot. However, the center of the southwestern elevation (facing the eastern corner of Park Row and Ann Street) contains a light court so the upper floors resemble a backward, warped &quot;E&quot;, with the &quot;spine&quot; running along the northeastern facade. Another light court to the east faces the corner of Theatre Alley and Ann Street. The two four-story towers are capped with copper-clad domes. The design is reminiscent of the double-towered Baroque churches of Europe, as well as the church of the Monastery of São Vicente da Fora of Lisbon. The towers were easily distinguished on the city&#x27;s 20th-century skyline. 

The facade contains decorative elements only on the elevations facing Park Row and Ann Street. Due to its location along the middle of the block on Park Row, the building was designed with elements of both a freestanding tower and an infill building. The vast majority of the decoration is concentrated on the main elevation along Park Row. This elevation is divided into several horizontal groups, each containing up to five stories. The 3rd through 5th floors have granite cladding, while the 6th through 26th stories have terracotta, light-brick, and limestone cladding. The other elevations have plain red brick and window openings. The first and second floors on Park Row were initially clad with granite as well, but were replaced with bronze and glass in 1930. Because of the modification, the &quot;base&quot; of the Park Row elevation is perceived as containing either two or five stories.

==== Park Row elevation ====

The Park Row elevation is split into three vertical sections. The outer sections, or &quot;end pavilions&quot;, each contain two window openings on the first through fourth stories, and three openings on the fifth story and above. The inner section is split into five bays with a single window on each bay, and above the fifth story, is slightly recessed behind the outer sections.

The first and second stories are largely a commercial storefront with bronze-and-glass infill, though two granite Doric-style pilasters from the original design remain extant, at the extreme outer ends of this elevation. The rest of the first and second stories was originally articulated with Doric pilasters and columns. The main entrance is composed of three glass-and-bronze doors underneath a glass-and-bronze transom, within a black Belgian granite surround. The first- and second-story facade to either side of the main entrance is slightly asymmetrical, with two pilasters to the north and three to the south. Secondary entrances also exist on either side of the main entrance. Bronze, gilded spandrels separate the first and second stories. A granite Doric cornice runs above the second story.

The third and fourth stories are clad with rusticated limestone. These floors both contain nine bays, and there is a belt course separating these stories. There are four large console brackets outside the third story, supporting large female figures on the fourth story; these brackets flank the third-outermost windows on either side. The brackets were designed by J. Massey Rhind and depict several facets of commerce. A small balustrade runs above the five center bays on the fourth story. The fifth story is clad with smooth limestone and has a large cornice with a frieze above it. There are recessed panels flanking the end pavilions on the fifth story, as well as between each of the five center bays on that story.

Above the fifth story, the end pavilions are clad with brick that is patterned to look like rusticated stone. On the end pavilions, there are balconies on the 10th, 18th, and 27th floors, each supported by four brackets and highly ornamented. Keystones above the 10th story windows of the end pavilions are ornamented with lions&#x27; heads. In the center section, terracotta pedestals separate each bay of the 6th story, supporting pilasters that span the 7th through 9th stories. Pilasters also separate each of the center bays on the 11th–13th, 14th–16th, and 18th–21st floors, while rectangular panels separate the 17th-floor center windows; each set of pilasters is separated by friezes. Angled balconies extend from the center bay on the 11th and 23rd floors. A decorative band extends horizontally between the 22nd and 23rd floors. The windows on the 23rd floor contain thick pedestals that support terracotta Doric columns spanning the 24th through 26th stories. A cornice with lions&#x27;-heads ornamentation rises above the 26th story. There is a 27th story above the center section topped with sheet-copper balls. The 27th story contains no ornamentation other than engaged columns between brick walls, and contains a round addition above it. The ceiling of the 27th story is lower within the towers than in the space between the towers.

==== Towers ====

Above the end pavilions are a pair of circular four-story towers spanning the 28th through 30th stories. Both towers have three visible stories, as well as a fourth story in cupolas that surmount both towers. On each tower, there are cornices above the 29th story, as well as four octagonal piers, one at each corner, supporting the 30th-story dome. The piers separate the towers into four sides, each of which contains three bays. The bays are separated by Corinthian brick pilasters ornamented with terracotta capitals, while the floors are separated by terracotta spandrels. Both domes have oculus windows and a copper-domed cupola on the 31st story. There are eight sheet-copper caryatids and 16 figures on the towers that are attributed to Rhind. The tops of the towers both formerly supported one-story-tall finials.

==== Other elevations ====
The Ann Street elevation is wide. At ground level is a service entrance with Doric pilasters on each side and a wave molding above it. There are two windows on the second floor with a Doric pilaster between them, and a cornice and frieze above the 2nd floor. There are rusticated limestone blocks on the 3rd through 5th floors, which have two windows each, and a molding above the fifth floors. On the 6th through 27th floors, there are three windows on each floor and balconies on the 10th, 18th, and 27th floors.

The remaining elevations, which are made of brick and contain very little ornamentation, are visible from the street. The northern elevation contained many window openings nearer the Park Row side and fewer nearer the Theatre Alley side. The southern and eastern elevations, as well as the light court facing southwest, have single, double, or triple windows set within a bare brick facade. These elevations were originally painted in a cream color, the same color as the Park Row and Ann Street facades. Eight steel beams, each with a depth of , span the light court.

=== Foundation ===
The foundations are sunken to a depth of . Underneath the subbasement level are 3,900 Georgia spruce piles, each deep with a diameter, driven into wet sand. The piles descend to below the water table. The underlying sand layer was removed to a depth of above the top of the piles, and then concrete was poured into the space until it reached to the top of the piles. Afterward, granite blocks were placed above the poured concrete and a of I-beams was laid atop the granite blocks. Each pile was capped by brick piers and a granite capstone, and the cellar floor was brought to the same depth as the granite capstones so that the grillage beams could be easily maintained.

The depth of the piles was influenced by the construction of Robertson&#x27;s previous project at 150 Nassau Street, which used a similar technique to build the foundation, and is located two blocks northeast of the Park Row Building. In the earlier project, pilings had been carried to a deeper level, but the sand was highly compacted below a depth of 20 feet. The excavations were almost the same level as the adjacent, now-demolished St. Paul Building.

The centers of the piles were spaced apart beneath the vertical columns, and apart elsewhere. The foundation pilings were intended to support a maximum weight of , or in total. Horizontal distributing girders were placed between the tops of the foundations and the footings of the above-ground vertical supports, ranging in length from and in depth from . This distributed the building&#x27;s weight more easily, meaning that the vertical supports only bore loads of up to . There are several columns whose footings were isolated from the grillage; these columns are located atop short girders on a set of I-beams, which in turn rest on the grillage. Each section of the foundation was designed with a different cross section because the irregular lot shape precluded uniform loads.

=== Features ===

==== Structure ====
The building contains about of steel and of other material, chiefly brick and architectural terracotta. The skeleton is made of steel manufactured by Carnegie Steel Company. Two uninvolved companies examined 890 steel-bar samples to determine if the steel was strong enough for use in the building, accepting 870 of these samples. The exterior wall columns are carried above the roof beams, connected by belt courses. All of the structural columns in the building, both interior and exterior, are covered with a layer of brick. Box and lattice girders, each of which are deep, connect the columns at the walls.

Floor areas ranged widely from at the base to in each of the towers. The floors rest atop open-web floor girders and use both concrete arches and hollow-tile arches as well as a concrete-arch system. Most of the floor beams are made of pairs of I-beams, which range in thickness from . The concrete arches, fabricated by John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons Company, consist of metal sheets rolled into arches and covered with concrete. The hollow-tile floors are made of flat arches made of terracotta blocks set in cement mortar and covered with cinder concrete. The vertical partitions in the building were also made of hollow terracotta tiles, thick. When built, the Park Row Building also contained two steel water tanks of , one in the cellar and one on the roof. The 27th floor has a roof and walls made of vertical I-beams, with terracotta infill. The roof was waterproofed with five layers of hot asphalt alternating with four layers of paper.

When the building was completed, thirteen elevators were provided in total. These consisted of one freight elevator for the subbasement through 26th floor; one elevator shared by passengers and freight between the 1st and 27th floors; four passenger elevators for the 1st through 27th floors; five passenger elevators for the 1st through 26th floors; and two passenger elevators connecting the 26th floor to each of the towers. The freight elevators were housed in a rectangular shaft near the Park Row entrance, while the passenger elevators were arranged in a semicircular layout. The tower elevators were smaller than the building&#x27;s other elevators and are no longer extant. These elevators were manufactured by Sprague Electric, and were one of the company&#x27;s last major installations in New York City; this model quickly became unpopular after the Park Row Building&#x27;s opening. There were also two dumbwaiters provided for the restaurant at the top of the building. Upon the building&#x27;s opening, the passenger elevators were described as being able to accommodate 20,000 passengers per day, or 100,000 on a typical workweek.

====Interior spaces====
The outer lobby design dates from 1930 and has a terrazzo floor; a pink-marble wall with black-marble bases; a plaster cornice; and an octagonal ceiling lamp. The main lobby is connected to the outer lobby via a pair of bronze-and-glass doors and is irregular in plan. The walls and floors are similar in design to the outer lobby. The ceiling is made of plaster with ornate decoration and deep coffers, contains a Greek cornice, and is supported by a row of square piers through the center of the lobby. On the north wall is a semicircular elevator lobby with access to the nine (originally ten) passenger elevators. The main lobby extends to a stair to the southeast, which has black marble risers, terrazzo treads, and a bronze handrail. There is another staircase in the lobby&#x27;s northwest corner, with more simple detail, and gray marble walls.

On the building&#x27;s northern side, there are two staircases above the second floor, with cast-iron risers, marble treads, and wrought-iron railings with wooden handrails. As arranged, each floor contained numerous small offices, as well as a semicircular elevator lobby on the north side with mosaic floor tiles. From the elevator lobby, passageways led west and east to a stair and a north–south passageway. Another hallway connected to the northern end of the easterly passageway, leading southeast and then south to the offices overlooking Theatre Alley. The building contained 950 offices, each with a capacity of about four people. At the top of the building was a restaurant.

Much of the original detail in the southern tower remains. A spiral stair made of cast-iron connects the 28th through 30th floors, surrounding a curved elevator shaft with cast- and wrought-iron doors. A staircase leads from the 30th to the 31st floor and contains alternating steps for one&#x27;s left and right feet. 

==History==
Starting in the early 19th century and continuing through the 1920s, the surrounding area grew into the city&#x27;s &quot;Newspaper Row&quot;; several newspaper headquarters were built on Park Row, including the Potter Building, the New York Times Building, the New York Tribune Building, and the New York World Building. Meanwhile, printing was centered around Beekman Street, less than one block north of the Park Row Building. By the late 19th century, technological advances in elevator technology and steel framework enabled the construction of taller office buildings, particularly in Lower Manhattan. Park Row was particularly favored because skyscrapers on the street could be readily seen from afar, which in turn was due to the lack of tall buildings in City Hall Park, west of Park Row. Between 1890 and 1908, the number of buildings in Lower Manhattan above ten stories increased from six to 538.

=== Development ===
Prior to the Park Row Building&#x27;s development, the site at 15 Park Row was occupied by the International Hotel. In 1896, seven lots at 15 Park Row were purchased by William Mills Ivins Sr., a prominent lawyer and former judge advocate general for New York State. He was acting on behalf of an investment syndicate that included wealthy businessman August Belmont Jr., for which he was employed as legal counsel. Ivins transferred the land to the syndicate, but due to his involvement, the building was sometimes known during development as the Ivins Syndicate Building. The group also purchased lots on either side, including at 3 Park Row near Ann Street, so that no other skyscraper could be developed to obstruct the view of the windows on the side facades. The syndicate was unable to buy the corner lots on Ann Street &quot;at any reasonable price&quot;, resulting in the unusual shape of the building.

The Park Row Building was envisioned as an entirely speculative development, and from the start, was intended to be the world&#x27;s tallest office building. R. H. Robertson was employed to create designs for the building, the first plans for which were publicized in March 1896. The skyscraper was to be erected by the Park Row Construction Company, a company operated by Belmont.

Work started on October 20, 1896, and Ivins was concurrently asked to &quot;retire&quot; from the company in 1896 or 1897. The building was mortgaged for $2.25 million to the Equitable Life Assurance Society in mid-1897. During construction, the Park Row Building&#x27;s engineers attempted to install concrete floor slabs, which were $20,000 cheaper and lighter than the more established hollow-tile floor technology. The New York City Board of Examiners opposed the use of concrete floors, giving no explanation for their refusal, and the builders sued and won the right to install concrete floors in December 1897. Because construction had already begun, the Park Row Building used both types of floors. Subsequently, the existing tile arches were found to be defective, exposing some of the structural steelwork, and had to be reinstalled. At the time, tile arches were relatively common since they protected the steelwork, even though they were not a structural feature. The Park Row Building was completed on July 20, 1899, after two years and nine months of construction.

=== Office use ===
At , the Park Row Building was the city&#x27;s tallest building upon its completion, overtaking the previous record holder, the St. Paul Building, by . It was also significantly taller than other tall structures in the area, such as the Manhattan Life Insurance Building and the American Surety Building. The Park Row Building was the tallest office building in the world, but not the tallest structure. The Park Row Building continued to be New York City&#x27;s tallest building and the world&#x27;s tallest office building until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Singer Building. The Park Row Construction Company transferred the building&#x27;s ownership in 1901 to the Park Row Realty Company, also operated by Belmont.

At the time of the building&#x27;s completion in 1899, approximately 4,000 people worked there under the employ of 1,000 companies. Many of the early tenants were small businesses, particularly law firms and those in the news-gathering industry. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), a company operated by Belmont which operated the city&#x27;s then-new subway system, had its headquarters in the building, as was the first office of the recently organized Associated Press. The Park Row Building also had several tenants who engaged in suspicious activity, such as a bucket shop in 1901, a get-rich-quick scheme in 1903, and a gambling ring in 1904. Belmont built an eight-story edifice on 3 Park Row, the lot that he had purchased to preserve the views from the Park Row Building, in 1906. The next year, Belmont turned over the Park Row Building, 3 Park Row, and several other properties to British banker Nathan Rothschild for $7 million.

The Park Row Building and 3 Park Row were sold to Frederick Brown in July 1923 for $5 million. Brown immediately resold the buildings to Kenneth W. McNeil of the McNeil Coal Company in Bridgeport, Connecticut. In October 1924, McNeil sold the buildings to Bernard Dorf in exchange for the Theodore Roosevelt Apartments on the Bronx&#x27;s Grand Concourse, in a sale worth $12 million. Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the building went into receivership, and the Federal Securities Corporation bought the property. W. Irving Moss bought the building at auction in 1930 for $2.9 million, and it was resold the next year to Charles W. Crosby. Clinton and Russell were hired in August 1930 to renovate the lowest two floors for $300,000, and the project was completed by early 1931. In addition to replacing the facade, Clinton and Russell restored the interior spaces and added commercial space on the first floor.

During the later 20th century, more tenants moved in, representing a variety of fields. These included Patterson Brothers, hardware dealers; Universal National Bank, New York City&#x27;s second black-controlled bank; and The Legal Aid Society. The building received few modifications throughout the remainder of the century, except for the replacement of windows and refurbishment of the lobby&#x27;s original ceiling.

=== Residential use ===
Joseph and Rachelle Friedman, owners of electronic and music retailer J&amp;R, bought 15 Park Row in the 1990s. At the time, J&amp;R occupied several neighboring low-rise buildings on Park Row, and the Friedmans had demolished and replaced the neighboring building at the corner of Park Row and Ann Street. By 2000, plans were developed for a thorough renovation of the entire structure. The 1st through 10th floors would remain as commercial space, while everything above the 10th floor would be converted into 210 residential units, ranging from studio apartments to two-bedroom suites. Fogarty Finger and H. Thomas O&#x27;Hara restored the interiors. The initial renovations and residential conversions were completed by 2001, and the first tenants moved in during that May. However, the building was shuttered after the September 11, 2001, attacks and the resulting collapse of the World Trade Center; when the building reopened in March 2002, nearly half of the 70 tenants did not return, while there were 62 units available. The pair of apartments in the cupolas at the 28th through 30th floors were not renovated, and were offered for sale as unfurnished units in 2013.

In the 2000s and early 2010s, J&amp;R took up most of the storefronts along the block of Park Row that included 15 Park Row, with a sales space at the ground floor and mezzanine of the building. By 2013, J&amp;R was planning to expand to five floors and knock down the walls separating 15 Park Row from 1 Park Row. However, J&amp;R closed permanently the following year. The 3rd through 10th floors were subsequently converted for residential use as well. By 2018, the building had 332 apartments, with five more under construction, two of which were planned for the towers atop 15 Park Row. In February 2020, Fogarty Finger proposed renovating the ground-level retail units, with options for one storefront on the lobby&#x27;s northern side as well as one, two, or three storefronts on the southern side. J&amp;R Music Lounge By City Winery was also supposed to open in 15 Park Row&#x27;s basement in early 2020. These plans were canceled following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Atlas Capital Group bought the Park Row Building from the Friedman family in January 2021 for about $140 million. At the time, half of the building was vacant. By early 2022, residents had raised complaints that the building&#x27;s elevators, heat, water, and gas services sometimes did not work properly. About one-fourth of the residents launched a rent strike to protest the building&#x27;s condition. That March, chef Todd English agreed to lease in the building&#x27;s lower stories and open a restaurant there. Atlas obtained a $136.5 million loan from Berkshire Residential Investments in mid-2022 to fund improvements to the Park Row Building, but the ongoing rent strike meant that the building provided enough income for only 30 percent of the loan payments. Furthermore, an environmental assessment in 2022 had discovered that the dust in the building had large amounts of several toxic substances.

== Notable incidents ==
On May 26, 1918, Harry H. Gardiner climbed 15 Park Row to raise money for the American Red Cross. A crowd of 50,000 people watched until he touched the golden ball at the top of one of the flagpoles. Gardiner then climbed back down; the event took two hours in total. A similar climb took place on September 8, 1918, when Steve Peterson climbed the building to raise money for the Free Milk for France Fund.

At 4:20 a.m. on May 3, 1920, anarchist Andrea Salsedo fell from the fourteenth floor of 15 Park Row. He was being held with Roberto Elia by the Justice Department in connection with a series of bombings that had occurred in New York City, Boston, Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, Paterson, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh. A leaflet entitled &quot;Plain Words&quot;, signed by the &quot;Anarchist Fighters&quot;, was found at the sites, and because of an aberrant &quot;S&quot; in the printing, the authorities tracked down the print shop where both Salsedo and Elia worked. They were held at 15 Park Row for eight weeks with limited external communication. When Salsedo fell, the anarchists claimed he was thrown, while the police claimed he jumped.

==Impact==
Criticism from the architectural community was harsh because of the lack of comparable structures at the time. A critic, writing in the &quot;Real Estate Record and Guide&quot; in 1898, stated that &quot;New York is the only city in which such a monster would be allowed to rear itself&quot;, and called the blank side walls &quot;absolutely inexpressive and vacuous&quot;, except for the steel girders across the light court that were &quot;provided to give the inmates of the central part some allowance of light and air&quot;. The unnamed critic described the cupolas as &quot;insignificant terminations which add nothing&quot;, in contrast to the top stories of the St. Paul Building, which they felt was well designed. However, the critic also praised Rhind&#x27;s figures on the Park Row Building as compared with the &quot;impossible &#x27;realism&#x27;&quot; of Karl Bitter&#x27;s figures on the St. Paul Building&#x27;s facade. In a 1908 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a French architect, Augustin-Adolphe Rey, wrote that &quot;one side of it is an entirely bare wall—what difference does it make how the other sides are treated?&quot; Critic Jean Schopfer called the building &quot;detestable&quot;, as compared with other skyscrapers like the &quot;mediocre&quot; St. Paul Building or the &quot;interesting&quot; American Surety Building. Negative criticism highlighted the composition of the facade as well. In 1898, the &quot;Engineering News&quot; said that the building was influenced by &quot;no established style of architecture&quot;. Architectural critic Montgomery Schuyler stated in 1897 that he believed skyscrapers should be divided into three horizontal layers but that &quot;Mr. Robertson declines to recognize even this convention&quot; in general.

The Park Row Building also had admirers, including the photographers Charles Sheeler and Alvin Langdon Coburn, who took pictures of the undecorated side walls of the building and the shadows made by its unusual shape. &quot;Scientific American&quot;, in 1898, praised Robertson&#x27;s design as having a &quot;very satisfactory effect&quot;, in that the facade was able to &quot;clothe the &#x27;skeleton; with a mantle of stone and glass that shall appear diversified, dignified and appropriate&quot;. Author H. G. Wells described the building as one of the &quot;splendid fountains of habitation&quot; present in the city at the beginning of the 20th century. &quot;Munsey&#x27;s&quot; referred to the building as &quot;a city and a world within four towering walls...a footprint of the twentieth century&quot;.

The Park Row Building was also depicted in several media works. Sheeler included the building in the short documentary film he made with Paul Strand, &quot;Manhatta&quot; (1921). The extreme narrowness of the Ann Street facade made that section of the building appear to be an extremely slender tower, as depicted in the film &quot;The Fisher King&quot;. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Park Row Building as a New York City landmark on June 15, 1999. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 2005.

<text>Rocinante (Rozinante) () is Don Quixote&#x27;s horse in the 1605/1615 novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes. In many ways, Rozinante is not only Don Quixote&#x27;s horse, but also his double; like Don Quixote, he is awkward, past his prime, and engaged in a task beyond his capacities.

== Etymology ==

 in Spanish means a work horse or low-quality horse, but can also mean an illiterate or rough man. There are similar words in English (&quot;rouncey&quot;), French (&quot;roussin or roncin; rosse&quot;), Portuguese (&quot;rocim&quot;), and Italian (&quot;ronzino&quot;). The etymology is uncertain. 

The name is a complex pun. In Spanish, &quot;&quot; has several meanings and can function as a standalone word as well as a suffix. One meaning is &quot;before&quot; or &quot;previously&quot;. Another is &quot;in front of&quot;. As a suffix, &quot;-ante&quot; in Spanish is adverbial; &quot;rocinante&quot; refers to functioning as, or being, a &quot;rocín&quot;. &quot;Rocinante&quot;, then, follows Cervantes&#x27;s pattern of using ambiguous, multivalent words, which is common throughout the novel.

Rocinante&#x27;s name, then, signifies his change in status from the &quot;old nag&quot; of before to the &quot;foremost&quot; steed. As Cervantes describes Don Quixote&#x27;s choice of name: &quot;nombre, a su parecer, alto, sonoro y significativo de lo que había sido cuando fue rocín, antes de lo que ahora era, que era antes y primero de todos los rocines del mundo&quot;—&quot;a name, to his thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks in the world&quot;.

In chapter 1, Cervantes describes Don Quixote&#x27;s careful naming of his steed:

Four days were spent in thinking what name to give him, because (as he said to himself) it was not right that a horse belonging to a knight so famous, and one with such merits of his own, should be without some distinctive name, and he strove to adapt it so as to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and what he then was.&quot;

<text>Ullmannite or &quot;Nickel glance&quot; (trivial name) is a nickel antimony sulfide mineral with formula: NiSbS. Considerable substitution occurs with cobalt and iron in the nickel site along with bismuth and arsenic in the antimony site. A solid solution series exists with the high cobalt willyamite.

==Physical properties==
Ullmannite is steel-gray to tin white in color with a metallic luster, has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of 6.65. Initially thought to be of two species, tetrahedral and cubic, it was later confirmed that both samples conformed to the 23 point group of the isometric crystal class and typically exhibits cubic, octahedral, or pyritohedral forms although euhedral crystals are rare.

Variance in its chemical composition has been shown to be responsible for loss of symmetry and variations in striation patterns.

Ullmannite crystals are usually less than 2 mm, however larger have been identified in especially antimony rich environments. Ullmannite commonly displays interpenetration twins as well as enantiomorphic twinning along [110].

==Occurrence==

It is a member of the cobaltite group and forms a series with willyamite (). It occurs with nickeline, gersdorffite, pentlandite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, galena, tetrahedrite and dyscrasite in hydrothermal deposits.

Principal localities are in Germany, it is also found in Austria, Australia, France, England, and Wales.

It was first described in 1843 for an occurrence in the Storch und Schöneberg Mine, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

Specimens of ullmannite were found at Sarrabus, Sardinia, Italy in 1887. The crystals of the specimens from Sarrabus were described as hemihedral with parallel faces, whereas specimens from Lölling in present-day Austria were hemihedral with inclined faces.

==Origin of name==
Ullmannite was named for German chemist and mineralogist, Johann Christoph Ullmann (1771–1821), one of the fathers of systematic mineralogy. Ullmann established a mineral collection (now the basis for the internationally renowned Museum of Mineralogy in Marburg) and authored &quot;Ein Systematisch-Tabellarische Übersicht der Mineralogisch einfachen Fossilien&quot;, one of the first attempts to provide a structured organization to the observed minerals of the day.

<text>Raja Ravi Varma () (29 April 1848 – 2 October 1906) was an Indian painter and artist. His works are one of the best examples of the fusion of European academic art with a purely Indian sensibility and iconography. Especially, he was notable for making affordable lithographs of his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure. His lithographs increased the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among the common people. Furthermore, his religious depictions of Hindu deities and works from Indian epic poetry and Puranas have received profound acclaim. He was part of the royal family of erstwhile Parappanad, Malappuram district.

Raja Ravi Varma was closely related to the royal family of Travancore of present-day Kerala state in India. Later in his life, two of his granddaughters were adopted into the royal family, and their descendants comprise the present royal family of Travancore, including the latest three Maharajas (Balarama Varma III, Marthanda Varma III and Rama Varma VII).

== Personal life ==
Raja Ravi Varma was born M. R. Ry. Ravi Varma, Koil Thampuran of Kilimanoor at Kilimanoor palace in the erstwhile princely state of Travancore (present-day Kerala) into an aristocratic family that for over 200 years produced consorts for the princesses of the matrilineal Travancore royal family. The title Raja was conferred as a personal title by the Viceroy and Governor-General of India Lord Curzon.

Ravi Varma was the son of Ezhumavil Neelakanthan Bhattatiripad and Uma Ambabayi Thampurratti. His mother Uma Ambabayi Thampuratty belonged to the baronial family which ruled the Kilimanoor feudal estate within the kingdom of Travancore. She was a poet and writer of some talent, and her work &quot;Parvati Swayamvaram&quot; was published by Varma after her death. Ravi Varma&#x27;s father was a scholar of Sanskrit and Ayurveda and hailed from the Ernakulam district in Kerala. Ravi Varma had two siblings, a sister named Mangala Bayi and a brother named Raja Varma (born 1860). The last-named was also a painter and worked closely with Ravi Varma all his life.

In 1866, at the age of 18, Varma was married to 12-year-old Bhageerthi Bayi (known formally as Pooruruttati Nal Bhageerathi Bayi Thampuratty) of the royal house of Mavelikkara, another major fief of Travancore kingdom. Notably, the house of Mavellikara was a branch of the Royal House of Travancore. Bhageerthi was the youngest of three sisters, and both of her elder sisters had been adopted into the royal family of Travancore in 1857 in order to carry on the lineage. They were known as the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and in their progeny was vested the succession to the throne of Travancore. Therefore, Ravi Varma&#x27;s connection to the royal family became very close due to his marriage with Bhageerthi. His children (because they belonged to their mother&#x27;s family) would be royal by birth. The marriage, which was arranged by the parents in the proper Indian manner, was harmonious and successful. The couple had five children, two sons, and three daughters. Their elder son, Kerala Varma (b.1876) was of an excessively spiritual temperament. He never married and eventually renounced the world, leaving home for good in 1912. The younger son, Rama Varma (born 1879), inherited his father&#x27;s artistic talent and studied at the JJ School of Arts, Mumbai. He was married to Gowri Kunjamma, sister of Dewan PGN Unnithan, and became the father of seven children.

The three daughters of Ravi Varma and Bhageerthi Bayi were Mahaprabha Amma (who features in two of Varma&#x27;s most famous paintings), Uma Amma (named after Varma&#x27;s mother) and Cheria Kochamma. In 1900 CE, the Royal House of Travancore once again faced a succession crisis. Bhageerthi&#x27;s two elder sisters, who had been adopted in order to carry forward the lineage, had failed to produce the desired heirs. They had six children between them, but only two of those survived, and both were boys (who also, incidentally, later died childless). According to the matrilineal Marumakkathayam system, the succession to the throne could only progress through females, and therefore it was necessary to make an adoption. Tradition dictated that two girls belonging to branches of the Royal Family be adopted together. They would be designated the Senior and Junior Rani of Attingal, and the succession to the throne of Travancore would be vested in their progeny, in accordance with the unusual and unique Marumakkathayam system of succession.

Two of Varma&#x27;s granddaughters were marked by destiny to receive this honour, the main reason being that they were the nearest matrilineal (cognatic) kin to the incumbent Rani of Attingal. In August 1900, Mahaprabha&#x27;s eldest daughter Lakshmi Bayi (aged 5 years) and Uma&#x27;s eldest daughter Parvati Bayi (aged 4 years) were adopted into the Royal family of Travancore. It was Bharani Thirunal Lakshmi Bayi, their surviving grand-aunt, who formally adopted them. She died within one year of doing this, and the two girls were then installed as the Senior and Junior Ranis of Attingal respectively. They were married while yet in their early teens to two gentlemen from suitable aristocratic families. It was the Junior Rani, Sethu Parvathi Bayi, who gave birth to the much-awaited heir in 1912, exactly a day after her sixteenth birthday. Incidentally, her husband was a grand-nephew of Raja Ravi Varma and belonged to Kilimanoor. The newborn child was the future Maharaja Chithira Thirunal, the last ruling Maharaja of Travancore. He was followed by a brother (the future Maharaja Marthanda Varma III) and a sister Lakshmi Bayi, the mother of Maharaja Rama Varma VII who is presently on the throne (since 2013). Meanwhile, the Senior Rani (Sethu Lakshmi Bayi, daughter of Mahaprabha Amma, and Regent from 1924 to 1931) also gave birth to two daughters later in life (in 1923 and 1926).

In this way, the entire present (existing) royal family of Travancore is descended from Raja Ravi Varma. Well known among his royal descendants are the writers Aswathi Thirunal Gowri Lakshmi Bayi and Shreekumar Varma, the artist Rukmini Varma and the classical musician Aswathi Thirunal Rama Varma.

Around Ravi Varma&#x27;s 57th birthday he announced his decision to accept Sanyasa, and retire from all worldly life when he turned 60. In his final years he suffered from grief for the death of Raja Raja Varma, and also from diabetes, which contributed to his death on 2 October 1906.

==Art career==
Varma was patronised by Ayilyam Thirunal, the next Maharaja of Travancore and began formal training thereafter. He learned the basics of painting in Madurai. Later, he was trained in water painting by Rama Swami Naidu and rather reluctantly in oil painting by British portraitist Theodore Jenson.

The British administrator, Edgar Thurston was significant in promoting the careers of Varma and his brother. Varma received widespread acclaim after he won an award for an exhibition of his paintings at Vienna in 1873. Varma&#x27;s paintings were also sent to the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition held in Chicago in 1893 and he was awarded three gold medals. He travelled throughout India in search of subjects. He often modelled Hindu Goddesses on Indian women, whom he considered beautiful. Ravi Varma is particularly noted for his paintings depicting episodes from the story of Dushyanta and Shakuntala, and Nala and Damayanti, from the Mahabharata. Ravi Varma&#x27;s representation of Hindu characters has become a part of the Indian imagination of the epics. He is often criticized for being too showy and sentimental in his style but his work remains very popular in India. Many of his fabulous paintings are housed at Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara.

==Raja Ravi Varma Press==

Apparently on the advice of the then Dewan (Prime Minister) of Travancore, T. Madhava Rao, Ravi Varma started a lithographic printing press in Ghatkopar, Mumbai in 1894 and later shifted it to Malavli near Lonavala, Maharashtra in 1899. The oleographs produced by the press were mostly of Hindu gods and goddesses in scenes adapted mainly from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; and the &quot;Puranas&quot;. These oleographs were very popular and continued to be printed in thousands for many years, even after the 1906 death of Ravi Varma.

The Ravi Varma press was the largest and most innovative press in India at that time. The press was managed by Varma&#x27;s brother, Raja Varma, but under their management, it was a commercial failure. By 1899 the press was deeply in debt and in 1901, the press was sold to his printing technician from Germany, Fritz Schleicher. Schleicher continued to print Ravi Varma&#x27;s prints but later employed other artists to create new designs. Schleicher also broadened the product of press to include commercial and advertisement labels. Under the management of Schleicher and his successors, the press continued successfully until a devastating fire destroyed the whole factory in 1972. Many of Ravi Varma&#x27;s original lithographic prints were also lost in the fire.

==Honours==

In 1904, Viceroy Lord Curzon, on behalf of the British King Emperor, bestowed upon Varma the Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal. A college dedicated to fine arts was also constituted in his honour at Mavelikara, Kerala. Raja Ravi Varma High at Kilimanoor was named after him and there are many cultural organizations throughout India bearing his name. In 2013, the crater Varma on Mercury was named in his honor. Considering his vast contribution to Indian art, the Government of Kerala has instituted an award called Raja Ravi Varma Puraskaram, which is awarded every year to people who show excellence in the field of art and culture.
* On his 65th death anniversary, India Post issued a commemorative postal stamp depicting Ravi Varma and his famous painting &#x27;Damayanti and Swan&#x27;

==Legacy==

Raja Ravi Varma is sometimes regarded as the first modern Indian artist due to his ability to reconcile Western aesthetics with Indian iconography. The Indian art historian and critic Geeta Kapur wrote, 

Similarly, Baroda School artist Gulam Mohammed Sheikh also wrote about Ravi Varma as a modern artist. In his essay &quot;Ravi Varma in Baroda&quot;, Sheikh asserted that Varma was a key figure in the establishment of Indian modern art, claiming that &quot;the story of contemporary Indian art was never the same after Ravi Varma had entered it. He left his imprint on almost every aspect of it.&quot; Like Kapur, Sheikh praised Ravi Varma&#x27;s integration of Indian and Western aesthetics and techniques, comparing him favorably to Indian modernist Nandalal Bose.

However, Ravi Varma&#x27;s legacy is controversial. Fellow Baroda School artist and art historian Ratan Parimoo saw Ravi Varma in a less favorable light, derogatorily referring to him as kitsch and claiming Varma&#x27;s work was less spiritually authentic than folk art and tribal art. He argued that Ravi Varma was responsible for the &quot;vulgarity&quot; of popular art, comparing Varma&#x27;s work to the lurid colors and sexuality of popular images in calendar art and films.

Despite his controversial legacy, Ravi Varma continues to be an important figure for modern and contemporary Indian artists. For example, modern artist Nalini Malani recreated Ravi Varma&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy of Musicians&quot; in her video installation &quot;Unity in Diversity&quot; to interrogate Ravi Varma&#x27;s idealistic nationalism. Similarly, contemporary artist Pushpamala N. recreated several Ravi Varma paintings with herself as the subject to deconstruct Ravi Varma&#x27;s idealized depictions of goddesses and Indian women.

Many organizations do programs in his memory and give awards in his name. A two days festival of The Maharaja Ranjitsinh Gaekwad Festival of Arts is annually organized, in his memory at the Durbar Hall in Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara, Gujarat.
The Raja Ravi Varma Award for Excellence in the Field of Visual Arts is presented during this festival. Jayant Parikh was the first recipient.

<text>The Clinch River is a river that flows southwest for more than through the Great Appalachian Valley in the U.S. states of Virginia and Tennessee, gathering various tributaries, including the Powell River, before joining the Tennessee River in Kingston, Tennessee.

==Course==
The Clinch River is dammed twice: by Norris Dam, the first dam built by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); and by the Melton Hill Dam, the only TVA dam with a navigation lock that is not located on the main channel of the Tennessee River.

An important tributary of the Clinch River is the Powell River. The Clinch and Powell drainage basins are separated by Powell Mountain. Tributaries entering the Clinch River below Norris Dam but above Melton Hill Dam include Coal Creek, Hinds Creek, Bull Run Creek, and Beaver Creek. Poplar Creek enters the river below the Melton Hill Dam.

==History==
A peninsula located at the mouth of the Clinch River, later called Southwest Point, was important to generations of Native Americans. In the early colonial period, it was the site of a frontier fort. This structure has recently been reconstructed.

The Cherokee and European settlers signed a treaty at Southwest Point to allow the capital of Tennessee to be moved there. The Tennessee General Assembly fulfilled this requirement technically by meeting in Kingston for one day and then voting to move the capital city elsewhere. It later was moved to Nashville.

Clinch was the name of an 18th-century explorer of the area. Former variations of the name included &quot;Clinch&#x27;s River&quot;, &quot;Clench River&quot;, &quot;Clinches River&quot; and &quot; Clinchs&quot;. Folk etymology, however, provides a more colorful account: the river received its name after a pioneer fell into it, and shouted &quot;Clinch me! Clinch me!&quot;, supposedly meaning &quot;clench me&quot; or &quot;grab me&quot;.

An older name for the river, which appears on some early maps, was the &quot;Pelisipi River&quot;, with such variant spellings as &quot;Pelisippi&quot; and &quot;Pellissippi&quot;, and the variant form &quot;Fiume Pelissipi&quot;. The Mitchell Map (1755–1757) labels a tributary of the &quot;Pelisipi River&quot; as &quot;Clinch&#x27;s River&quot;. The word &quot;Pellissippi&quot; was long said to have been the Cherokee language name for the river and was purported to mean &quot;winding waters&quot;.

Research completed in 2017 concluded that the Miami-Illinois name (&quot;river of the Mosopelea&quot; tribe) was first applied to what later European settlers called the Ohio River. Shortened in the Shawnee language to , or , the name evolved through other variant forms such as &quot;Polesipi&quot;, &quot;Peleson&quot;, &quot;Pele Sipi&quot; and &quot;Pere Sipi&quot;. It was eventually stabilized to the &quot;Pelisipi/Pelisippi/Pellissippi&quot; form. These names were variously applied back and forth between the Ohio and Clinch rivers. The name Pellissippi has been used in proper names throughout East Tennessee, for example in Pellissippi Parkway and Pellissippi State Community College.

==Power industry==
A power plant is located along the Clinch River at Carbo in Russell County, Virginia. It was completed in 1957 and is owned by Appalachian Power, a part of American Electric Power. The coal-fired plant was converted to natural gas in 2016. The Virginia City Hybrid Energy Center, another coal-fired power plant that began operations in 2012, is a few miles away outside St. Paul in Wise County, Virginia. It is owned by Dominion Virginia Power.

==Ecology==
The Clinch River above Clinton, Tennessee (tailwaters of Norris Dam) is stocked with rainbow trout and brown trout by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

Before being dammed, the Clinch River was a major producer of freshwater mussels and pearls. The rivers of the southern Appalachians are still notable for their unusually rich mussel biodiversity. The mussels were an important food source for Native Americans. Scots-Irish and later British settlers used mussels as bait and hog feed.

The freshwater pearl industry thrived throughout the southern Appalachians in the late 19th century and early 20th century. The Clinch River and the Emory River were considered the economic heart of the pearl industry, and Tennessee was one of the top six states in the United States for pearl production. The mussel-based industries began to decline in the early 20th century and were effectively eliminated by the dams built by the TVA in the mid-20th century. The first major Tennessee River dam was Wilson Dam, built at a site known as Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The name may have referred to the freshwater mussels of the region (the shoals could also be named for the exertion necessary to move river traffic across them). Norris Dam and Norris Lake on the Clinch River flooded one of the other areas of mussel near Young&#x27;s Island.

Pollution of the river from mining in the region has caused great concern among environmentalists because several rare species inhabit the river. Some mussels were reintroduced to the Cleveland, Virginia, area from outside the state in the early 2000s. Pollution of the 20th century had destroyed much of the historic mussels species.

In 2008, a dike rupture at a coal ash pond led to a large release of fly ash from the TVA&#x27;s Kingston Fossil Plant depositing 2.6 million pounds of fly ash in the lower section of the river below the confluence of the Emory River. Although at first the TVA began cleaning the ash out of the river, in 2009 the EPA took over; they finished removing coal ash in 2010. The release of coal ash in rivers has been shown to result in increased sedimentation and the exposure of trace elements to aquatic organisms.

A study done several months after the spill revealed that the river had increased amounts of trace metals such as mercury and arsenic, which are dangerous throughout the food chain. A study done a year after the spill showed that there was a possibility of food web accumulation of methylmercury, but this had not yet been shown.

==Recreation==
There are several state and local parks along the Clinch River in both Tennessee and Virginia, including:
*Big Ridge State Park
*Norris Dam State Park
*Chuck Swan State Forest
*Clinch River State Park

<doc id="910006" wikidata="Q2073292" url="?curid=910006" title="Symbols of Kraków">
<text>The city of Kraków uses a coat of arms, a seal, official colors, a flag, and a banner as its official symbols. Additionally, a number of semi-official and unofficial symbols of the city are also used.

==Official symbols==
The current official symbols of Kraków are described by the Ordinance of the Kraków City Council no. CXXIII/1150/02 adopted on October 9, 2002. However, they are all based on symbols which have been in use since much earlier, some of them dating back to the 16th century.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms displays a red brick wall with three towers in a blue field. Each tower, the middle one taller and wider than the other two, is topped with a battlement with three crenels and has a black vertical loophole and a black window. In the wall there is a gate with a pair of open golden doors with fleur-de-lis-shaped metalwork and a raised golden grate. Inside the gate there is the White Eagle with a golden crown, beak and talons. The escutcheon has a typically Renaissance shape and is topped with a golden Crown of Bolesław I the Brave with fleurs-de-lis, closed with a globus cruciger (an orb with a cross).

The crowned White Eagle, which is also used in the coat of arms of Poland, and the crown above the escutcheon symbolize the fact that Kraków was the Polish capital and seat of Polish kings from ca. 1040 until 1596. The coat of arms with the brick wall, the three towers, the open gate and the eagle dates back to the 16th century. The actual colors and shapes, however, changed with time. The current design, adopted in 2002, uses shapes of the escutcheon and the eagle based on those found on Renaissance seals, signets and other artifacts, but other shapes, including Gothic and Neo-Classical, were also used in past. The Free City of Kraków, a city state which existed between 1815 and 1846 used the Kraków coat of arms as its state symbol. The Grand Duchy of Kraków created after the Free City&#x27;s annexation by the Austrian Empire, used the White Eagle with the Kraków coat as an inescutcheon but without the eagle inside the gate.

===Seal===
The seal is round and consists of the coat of arms surrounded by an inscription with the city&#x27;s official name: &quot;Stołeczne Królewskie Miasto Kraków&quot;, or &quot;Royal Capital City of Kraków&quot;.

===Colours and flag===
The official colors of Kraków are white and blue. The flag consists of two horizontal stripes of equal width, the top one white and the bottom one blue. The flag proportions are 5:8. The white-and-blue bicolor was adopted as the flag of the Free City of Kraków in 1815. It is almost identical with the civil flag of San Marino, the only difference being the shade of blue.

===Banner===
The banner consists of a white saltire in a blue field with the coat of arms superimposed in the center. The banner proportions are 5:8. It is attached to a pole topped with a miniature of the crown used for coronations of Polish kings.

===Use of official symbols===
The use of the city&#x27;s official symbols is regulated by the Ordinance no. 167/2004 signed by the Mayor of Kraków on February 6, 2004.

Both the banner and the seal exist in only two official specimens. One set of the banner and seal is used by the Mayor (&quot;Prezydent Miasta Krakowa&quot;) and the other – by the President of the City Council (&quot;Przewodniczący Rady Miasta Krakowa&quot;). The banner is only used on special occasions. Similarly, the seal is only impressed upon particularly important documents.

The coat of arms should be displayed outside and may be also displayed indoors by organs of the City of Kraków, the city administration and the city&#x27;s one-person joint-stock companies. The flag is the most &quot;democratic&quot; of the official symbols as it may be used virtually by anyone, especially on special occasions.
==Other symbols==

Since the use of most of Kraków&#x27;s official symbols is legally restricted, many semiofficial and unofficial symbols are also used. The Kraków logo, which includes the city&#x27;s Latin name, &quot;Cracovia&quot;, is used by the city authorities for Kraków&#x27;s promotion. Another popular symbol of the city is a stylized crowned letter K based on that found on old city seals and, most famously, on the door to the Wawel Cathedral.

Images of the city&#x27;s patron saints, Saint Stanislaus and Saint Florian, may be also used as its symbols, particularly in religious contexts. &quot;Hejnał mariacki&quot;, the famous trumpet call made every hour from the taller tower of St Mary&#x27;s Church, may be considered an audible symbol of Kraków. Other unofficial symbols of Kraków include a variety of objects popularly associated with the city, such as:

* the Wawel Dragon;
* the Lajkonik;
* certain landmark buildings, especially the Wawel, St Mary&#x27;s Church, the Sukiennice (Cloth Hall) and the Barbican;
* mascarons from the Sukiennice attic;
* the krakowiak folk costume;
* &quot;obwarzanek krakowski&quot;, a traditional ring-shaped bread.

<doc id="910008" wikidata="Q3138706" url="?curid=910008" title="Hiwassee River">
<text>The Hiwassee River is a 
 river in the states of 
Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. It originates from a spring on the north slope of Rocky Mountain in Towns County in northern Georgia, then flows northward into North Carolina before turning westward into Tennessee; it joins the Tennessee River a few miles west of what is now State Route 58 in Meigs County, Tennessee.

== Hydrography ==
The river is dammed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) in four locations, all in Western North Carolina: Chatuge Dam, Mission Dam (not owned by TVA), Hiwassee Dam, and Apalachia Dam. Water is diverted from the stream bed at Apalachia Dam and sent through a pipeline, which is tunneled through the mountains for eight miles (13 km); then it flows through the Apalachia Powerhouse to generate electricity. The stretch of the river that flows between Apalachia Dam and Apalachia Powerhouse features reduced flow. The John Muir Trail in Tennessee&#x27;s Cherokee National Forest goes along this part of the river.

The stretch of river that flows from the North Carolina/Tennessee state line to U.S. Highway 411 near Delano is designated as a Tennessee State Scenic River (Class III Partially Developed River). For recreational purposes, it is managed by the Tennessee Resource Management Division, in cooperation with TVA. The river features Class I through Class III rapids, depending on water levels.

After exiting the mountains through a gorge, the Hiwassee broadens, meandering through rural Polk and Bradley counties in Tennessee. It is crossed by a bridge carrying US-411 soon after it exits the mountains. U.S. Route 11 passes over the river at Calhoun and Charleston, Tennessee, where local industries such as Bowater Newsprint Mill and Arch/Olin Chemical use river water in their operations. 

At this point the river interfaces with the impoundment of Chickamauga Dam (located in Chattanooga, Tennessee). Many marshes and wetlands surround the main channel, providing rich habitats for wildlife and areas for hunting and fishing. 

Interstate 75 passes over the river on the border of McMinn and Bradley counties. The Hiwassee continues westward; it is crossed by SR 58&#x27;s bridge on its way to its confluence with the Tennessee River. This area of the river is enjoyed by boaters, fishermen, and water skiers.

Major tributaries include Valley River, Nottely River, Coker Creek, Big Lost Creek, Spring Creek, Conasauga Creek, and Toccoa/Ocoee River.

==Etymology==
The Hiwassee River has been known by many variant spellings, particularly Hiawassee, which is also the name of the Georgia town through which the river flows. Other alternate spellings include Heia Wassea, Highwassee, Euphasee, and Quannessee. Some say the name came from the Cherokee word &quot;Ayuhwasi&quot;, meaning meadow or savanna.

==History==

The river flows west from North Carolina into Tennessee. This area is popular for whitewater rafting, whitewater canoeing, and whitewater kayaking. Recreational fishing is popular with several outfitters located near the river, and there is also industrial activity along the river, such as paper mills.

The Interstate 75 bridge crossed the Hiwassee between McMinn and Bradley counties in Tennessee. This was the site of a fatal 99-vehicle accident in December 1990, during extremely foggy weather in the area of a paper mill in the valley. During the years since then, a huge system of warning signs and lights has been built on that stretch of Interstate 75 to warn automobiles and trucks against incidents of foul weather, characterized by heavy rains and clouds. Many serious collisions had occurred in this area.

<text>BAX Global was an American international shipping company that was headquartered in Irvine, California, and had other major offices in Australia, Singapore, London, the Netherlands and Toledo, Ohio. The company was a subsidiary of the Burlington Northern Railroad.

In January 2006, BAX Global was acquired by DB Logistics and was integrated with Schenker, the land, sea, and air freight branch of DB Logistics.

DB Logistics is the freight and logistics division of Deutsche Bahn, the State-owned German railway company. In July 2011 Schenker Inc. announced it would give up its airfreight activities and stop the use of the remaining 20 aircraft.

==History==
The company originally opened for business in ten cities in the United States on June 15, 1972, as Burlington Northern Airfreight, Inc. (BNAFI), a subsidiary of Burlington Northern Railroad. In 1982, BNAFI was acquired by the Pittston Company, which later became Brink&#x27;s. In 1986, BNAFI changed its name to Burlington Air Express, repositioning itself as an overnight air express company. The company acquired WTC Air Freight in 1987 and the assets of failed air freight carrier Roadway Global Air from Caliber System in 1995. In 1997 the company changed its name to BAX Global, reflecting its expansion over all continents.

On January 31, 2006, BAX Global was acquired from Brink&#x27;s by DB Logistics, the Transportation and Logistics Division of Deutsche Bahn, for $1.1 billion.

Burlington Air Express had a dedicated fleet of aircraft owned and operated by Air Transport International (ATI), a sister company also owned by Brinks. At the time of the sale of BAX Global to DB Logistics, ATI was sold to Cargo Holdings International. Cargo Holdings International is still under contract with BAX Global to provide dedicated lift.

In July 2011, Schenker Inc. (DB Schenker Logistics) announced it would give up its domestic airfreight activities in the US, Canada and Mexico and therefore would stop using the remaining fleet of 20 aircraft in the coming week as cargo had begun to be moved by trucks. This decision affected 700 employees and represented 10% of the Schenker Inc. business in this area.

==Former fleet==
Before acquisition:

* 18 Douglas DC-8F
* 10 Boeing 727-200F
* Several Boeing 747 for international charters

<doc id="910025" wikidata="Q7342338" url="?curid=910025" title="Robert Brent">
<text>Robert Brent (1764 – September 7, 1819) was the first mayor of City of Washington, federal capital of the United States of America. Brent was born into a prominent Catholic family, members of which emigrated to the Maryland colony in the 17th century and for which the Brent Society is named. 

==Early life==
Brent was born in 1764, on the Woodstock estate in Aquia, Stafford County, Virginia. to parents Robert Brent and Anne Carroll Brent. Several of his ancestors had emigrated to northeastern Virginia after a political falling out with the Calvert family, the proprietors of the Maryland colony, and the Brents retained their Catholic faith, practicing it quietly when it became illegal in the Virginia colony. His maternal uncle, John Carroll became the first Catholic Bishop appointed for the United States, and traveled from his Maryland base into Virginia occasionally to conduct religious services at Brent family properties. Several of his Brent ancestors and relatives were lawyers and even members of the Virginia legislature representing Stafford County and later (when it was created) adjoining Prince William County, in addition to operating plantations using enslaved labor. Brent&#x27;s father was a businessman who also owned the Aquia quarry.

In 1789 or 1787, Brent married Mary Young—the daughter of Notley Young, a plantation owner in Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. The couple resided on the Young family property after their marriage. A few years later, Young&#x27;s property was among those annexed by the Federal government for the new national capital, making Brent one of the first residents of the newly created City of Washington. He soon took over his father&#x27;s businesses, selling sandstone to the U.S. government for the White House, U.S. Capitol, and other early construction projects in the District of Columbia and thereby becoming one of the capital&#x27;s most prominent merchants.

==Mayor of City of Washington==
In 1802 Congress officially incorporated the city, including in its incorporation a directive for a mayor to be appointed annually by the President of the United States. On June 3, 1802 Thomas Jefferson wrote to Brent, informing Brent of his intention to appoint Brent as mayor of the city. Brent replied accepting the appointment that same day: &quot;Altho I feel great diffidence in the talents I possess for executing that duty, in a manner which may afford general satisfaction, yet feeling it a duty to contribute my feeble aid for the public service, I will venture upon its duties.&quot;

Brent was reappointed to the position seven times by Jefferson and three times by James Madison, finally relinquishing the position in June 1812. During his tenure, he essentially created the city government from the ground up — establishing markets, public schools, a police department, a fire department, and a system for taxation. In addition, since city planner Pierre L&#x27;Enfant had been dismissed before completion of his design, Brent was responsible for laying out many of the streets in the new city. In ten terms as mayor, Brent took no salary.

==Other careers==
During his lifetime, Brent also served as Paymaster-General of the United States Army, Judge of the Orphan&#x27;s Court for Washington County, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Public Schools. He was the first president of the Patriotic Bank and of the Columbia Manufacturing Co.

==Brentwood Mansion==

Brent&#x27;s home was located on the southeast corner of the present 12th Street and Maryland Avenue SW in Washington, DC, but he owned land throughout the region, including parts of Montgomery County, Maryland, and Washington County. His landholdings were largely inherited through his father&#x27;s family, his mother&#x27;s family (the Carrolls of Maryland), and his father-in-law.

In 1817 Brent had the Brentwood Mansion constructed in Washington County (the mansion site - Florida Ave and 6th Street NE is now part of the Gallaudet University campus in Northeast DC) as a present for his daughter Eleanor on her marriage to Congressman Joseph Pearson (Federalist - N.C.). Brentwood was designed by one of the Capitol&#x27;s architects, Benjamin Henry Latrobe. The Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland, towns of Brentwood and North Brentwood and the DC neighborhood of Brentwood (which formed most of the original estate) take their names from his home.

==Legacy==
Brent died in City of Washington, at his home on September 7, 1819, after suffering from a stroke. He was buried in a vault on the property of Brentwood Mansion but vandalism and desecration of the crypts forced the last owners of the property to re-inter the remains of Brent and his family members to Saint John the Evangelist Catholic Church Cemetery in Forest Glen, Maryland in 1915.

Robert Brent Elementary School in City of Washington is named in his honor. His son William Brent Jr. served in the Virginia House of Delegates and as charge de affairs to Argentina.

<doc id="910031" wikidata="Q2519283" url="?curid=910031" title="Ouragan-class landing platform dock">
<text>The &quot;Ouragan&quot; class () was a series of French landing platform docks operated by the Marine Nationale. They were designated &quot;Transport de chalands de débarquement&quot; (TCD) (in English: landing craft transport) in French service. The &quot;Ouragan&quot; class was the first series of landing platform docks designed and constructed by France. The two ships entered service in the late 1960s and both ships saw service in the Pacific Ocean as part of the French nuclear programme. They were initially intended to be replaced by the s in the 1990s. However, due to delays, they were kept in service until they were replaced by the s in the 2000s. A possible sale to Argentina fell through after concerns of asbestos arose. Both ships were taken out of service in 2007 and were scrapped in Belgium in 2016 and 2017 respectively.

==Background==
In the immediate post-World War II era, the French Navy acquired a series of American and British amphibious warfare ships. This was done in order to gain knowledge and experience with these ship types. The French acquired the in 1952 via the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. &quot;Foudre&quot; served until 1969 and was the basis for French knowledge of the ship type.

==Design and description==

The class was designed for multi-mission capability. They had the ability to complete a fast loading and unloading of landing craft, and other equipment, carrying troops and vehicles for a land mission. The vessels could carry, supply and operate helicopters transporting commandos or providing close support. They could transport the mission crew and command a landing operation of limited scale. The &quot;Ouragan&quot; class had a standard displacement of and at full load. They were long overall and between perpendiculars with a beam of and a draught of . When completely docked down they had a displacement of and a draught of . The vessels had a max complement of 213 personnel including 10 officers.

&quot;Ouragan&quot; was powered by two SEMT-Pielstick 12 PC 2V diesel engines turning two shafts and controllable pitch propellers. &quot;Ouragan&quot;″s powerplant created and &quot;Orage&quot;″s, . This gave the ships a maximum speed of and a range of at . The ships both created 2,650 kW of electrical power.

===Amphibious warfare===
The ship had a well deck that could be submerged under water. The movement of water within the ship was control by sluices, valves and automatic pumps. The vessels were capable of filling the deck at controlled from a central position. The well deck was accessed by a stern gate. Since the vessels were designed for multi-mission capability, the &quot;Ouragan&quot; class had several layouts. The standard layout allowed the vessels to transport 349 troops with 14 officers. For short distances the number could rise to 470 troops. The ships were supplied with two &quot;Engin de débarquement d&#x27;infanterie et de chars&quot; (EDICs) which could transport eleven light tanks or eight loaded &quot;Chaland de transport de matériel&quot; (CTMs) or with eighteen Mk 6 landing craft mechanized (LCMs) operating from the well deck. A further three landing craft vehicle personnel (LCVPs) could be carried topside.

Mission flexibility was accomplished through the non-permanent sections of both the internal and external decks that could be removed. A temporary dock could be created from fifteen temporary sections that allowed for an increase in storage space for equipment, however the docking well was reduced to half its normal size. Logistically they could carry of equipment which was serviced by the two 35-ton cranes mounted above the docking well. &quot;Orage&quot;″s interior layout was altered, equipped with an enclosed flag bridge but with the removable decks and surgical compartments removed Furthermore, there was a large provision of decontamination areas. They were also designed as repair ships, able to dock ships up to within their well and had repair and maintenance facilities along with electrical and ordnance workshops.

===Armament and electronic warfare===
&quot;Ouragan&quot; was originally armed with two single-mounted mortars and four single-mounted guns. The 120 mm mortars had a range of and fired a shell. The 40 mm guns had a range of . &quot;Orage&quot; was unarmed. However, in 1993, the two ships were upgraded with two Matra Simbad twin missile launchers armed with the Mistral infrared surface-to-air missile. The anti sea-skimmer missile has a homing range to and carried a warhead. &quot;Orage&quot; was also given two single-mounted Breda/Mauser /70 guns.

&quot;Ouragan&quot; was initially deployed with the SQS-17 sonar system. In 1993, as part of their modernisation, both ships were equipped with Thomson-CSF DRBV 51A air/surface radar operating on the G band and for weapons control they were given two SAGEM VIGY-105 optronic systems. &quot;Ouragan&quot;″s sonar was removed in the refit.

===Aircraft===
Ships of the &quot;Ouragan&quot; class had a flight deck that initially had the ability to operate three Aérospatiale SA 321 Super Frelon helicopters or ten Aérospatiale Alouette IIIs. To accommodate the flight deck, a small island was situated to the starboard side. They could have one further Super Frelon or three Alouettes fly from a removable six-section flight deck area covering their well deck space. Within its hold, it could carry 18 Super Frelons and 80 Alouettes for transport purposes only.

== Service history ==

&quot;Ouragan&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Experimental Centre, the French nuclear testing centre while based at Brest. &quot;Ouragan&quot; took part in nuclear tests and was present for the first French hydrogen bomb test in 1968. In 1975, the ship was ordered to Anjouan to evacuate French citizens from the Cormoros.
Following its commissioning, &quot;Orage&quot; was sent to the Pacific Ocean and assigned to the Pacific Experimental Centre. While deployed with this unit, &quot;Orage&quot; was unarmed and its surgical compartments and inboard removable decks were replaced with modular structure. This allowed the vessel to be a floating headquarters ship. The vessel acted as the primary transport for the unit to and from France. During its career, &quot;Orage&quot; carried out eleven Pacific cruises before joining the Atlantic fleet in 1977.

In 1979, &quot;Ouragan&quot; was sent to Lebanon to embark the French army contingent of UNIFIL. In 1987, &quot;Ouragan&quot; rescued the small freighter &quot;Taporo 1&quot; after the merchant suffered damage to its propulsion and was left adrift on a coral reef. In 1991, &quot;Ouragan&quot; and &quot;Orage&quot; took part in the Opération Daguet, the French armed forces operation in the Gulf War. That year, &quot;Orage&quot; supported the French ballistic missile submarine when it sailed to Dakar, marking the first acknowledged visit of nuclear submarine to Africa.

The ships were due to decommission in 1993, however delays in the construction of the forced the French Navy to send the class in for an overhaul. Following the refit, both ships were assigned to the &quot;Force d&#x27;action navale&quot; based in Toulon. Their service life was again extended until the s entered service. In the 1990s, &quot;Orage&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea in support of missions during the Yugoslav War and the War in Kosovo. In 2004, the ship was ordered to Haiti to protect French citizens during unrest in the country. The two ships of this class were supposedly due for transfer to the Argentine Navy in 2006 and 2007 but the whole operation was placed on hold by the Argentine Government due to concerns about asbestos, a toxic material used in the ships&#x27; construction. They remained moored in Toulon harbour. Both ships were taken out of service in 2007 and sold for scrap on 16 July 2009. In early 2016 &quot;Ouragan&quot; arrived at Ghent at the Galloo ship recycling plant where it was dismantled. In mid 2017, &quot;Orage&quot; was sent for dismantling in Belgium.

<doc id="910036" wikidata="Q7193324" url="?curid=910036" title="Pigeon River (Tennessee–North Carolina)">
<text>The Pigeon River of Western North Carolina and East Tennessee rises above Canton, North Carolina, is impounded by Walters Dam, enters Tennessee, and flows into the French Broad River, just past Newport, Tennessee. The river traverses the Pisgah National Forest and the Cherokee National Forest, and drains much of the northeastern Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

The river takes its name from the passenger pigeon, an extinct bird whose migration route once included the river valley in North Carolina.

==Course==
The Pigeon River arises in southeastern Haywood County, North Carolina, and flows basically northwest for most of its length. However, near Pressley Mountain it turns northeast for about four miles and in the town of Canton, where it was utilized by a now-closed local paper mill, it turns north. After Canton it turns almost due west for about five miles, before resuming its northwest trend at about Clyde. From Canton, the Pigeon River flows roughly parallel to Interstate 40 for many miles. It is impounded by the Walters Dam of Progress Energy creating the long, narrow Waterville Lake. It enters Tennessee just after the village of Waterville, and continues with I-40 in the same valley northwestward through Hartford to Newport, where I-40 heads west, and the Pigeon River flows north into the French Broad River.

==History==
The Pigeon River dam was started in and was completed in . The project was started by Carolina Power &amp; Light and was completed by its affiliate Phoenix Electric Co. The concrete dam is high by 800 ft long. The brick power plant (visible from I-40) is actually from the dam. A tunnel long stretches from the dam to the power plant.

The floods following the series of storms spawned by Hurricanes Frances and Ivan in September 2004 have changed the character of the river. The rains lasted days and flooding was severe. Portions of the towns of Canton and Clyde were completely underwater, and there was significant damage to a large portion of both towns. Farther upstream the water levels reached unprecedented levels. Part of Interstate 40 collapsed into the river gorge because of the force of the floodwaters. This began when trees on the hill beside the highway fell in the river, followed by the soil the trees had held in place. The shoulder gave way, and a guardrail ended up just hanging.

A large paper mill (once part of Champion International Paper and now the Blue Ridge Paper Company) in Canton was the primary source of considerable dioxin and particulate matter pollution discharged into the Pigeon River. The pollution situation in the river became a minor issue in the campaign for the 1988 Presidential election. As Al Gore started his first run for the Presidency, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine reported that Gore was pressured by North Carolina Senator Terry Sanford and Congressman Jamie Clarke to ease up on his campaign against Champion&#x27;s wastewater discharges into the Pigeon River. According to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Gore complied with their request, writing to the United States Environmental Protection Agency to oppose tighter water pollution control requirements. This issue came up again during the 2000 Presidential election.
==Recreation==
Recreational rafting is popular in two sections of the river, the Upper and the Lower. Both sections are found in Hartford, Tennessee. The Upper section begins at the powerhouse (located right on the North Carolina/Tennessee border) and features up to Class III+ whitewater rapids. The Lower section features &quot;more modest&quot; waves.

<doc id="910042" wikidata="Q2588227" url="?curid=910042" title="Aberavon">
<text>Aberavon () is a town and community in Neath Port Talbot county borough, Wales. The town derived its name from being near the mouth of the river Afan, which also gave its name to a medieval lordship. Today it is essentially a district of Port Talbot, covering the central and south western part of the town. Aberavon is also the name of the nearby Blue Flag beach and the parish covering the same area.

==History==

Little is known about Aberavon before Norman times. Bronze Age remains have been found in the hills behind the town. Roman artifacts have been found near the sea, including when the docks were being built in the 19th century.

About 1090 the invading Normans deposed Iestyn ap Gwrgant, the ruler of Glamorgan. His son, Caradog ab Iestyn, was the only Welsh lord to retain lands in Glamorgan - the area between the Afan and Neath rivers - and he became the first of the Lords of Afan. Caradoc built a castle in Aberafan near the present site of St Mary&#x27;s Church. This wooden castle was burnt down in 1153 and Caradoc&#x27;s son, Morgan ap Caradoc, rebuilt the castle in stone. In 1147, Cistercian monks founded the nearby Margam Abbey. In 1241, the Lordship passed to Morgan Fychan. His son, Leisan D&#x27;Avene, was the first known by a Norman-style surname. In 1304, Leisian D&#x27;Avene adopted the town&#x27;s first charter. By 1373, the town had passed into the hands of Edward le Despencer, Lord of Glamorgan, and the Lords of Afan had ceased to be.

The English antiquarian John Leland made an extensive journey through Wales –1539, of which he recorded an itinerary. He passed through Aberafan, which he describes as a &quot;poor village&quot; surrounded by barren ground, though he also describes the area as heavily wooded, not much of which remains today. He mentions the use of the river mouth as a port, a &quot;haven for ships&quot; as he puts it. His portrayal of Aberafan as a small, struggling village however suggests that the port was not in great use, especially as traffic to and from Margam Abbey would have ceased following its dissolution in 1536.

Tradition has it that when the English Civil War broke out in 1648 Oliver Cromwell tried to seize the town charter as he passed through the town on his way to Pembroke, but it was hidden from him in a chopping block. Aberafan also endured the storm surge of 1607 and the Great Flood of 1768, when the river flowed into St Mary&#x27;s Church.

Aberavon was the birthplace of Dic Penderyn, a key figure in the Merthyr Rising of 1831. St Mary&#x27;s Church is the site of his grave. The castle site was built over between 1876 and 1897 and its foundations now lie underneath the streets around the church. There have been reports of a ghost, a white lady seen floating above the castle ruins. The ghost is speculated to be Jane de Afan, the last occupant of Aberavon Castle.

In the 18th century industry began to appear in the area. Industrialists worked with the Talbot family of Margam Castle to divert the bottom of the Afan river to its present bed, and in 1836 opened a new harbour east of the river Afan with the name of &quot;Port Talbot&quot;. The following decades saw significant industrial and population growth for Aberafan and the surrounding areas with people coming from North and West Wales, South West England, and Ireland. A new borough of Aberavon came into being in 1861, though at the time it was still smaller than nearby Cwmafan or Taibach. Although there were small local collieries the area had become known for its metalworking industry.

In the 1950s many of the sand dunes of Aberavon Beach disappeared as part of the development of the Sandfields estate, at this time a 1.25 mile sea wall was built primarily for sea defences. The estate was built to accommodate the growing population, especially the families of workers at the new Port Talbot Steelworks.

From 1832 Aberavon had belonged to the Swansea parliamentary district of boroughs, uniting with Kenfig, Loughor, Neath and Swansea to return one member; from 1918 to 2024 it had its own UK parliament constituency. Starting in 2024 it was part of the Aberafan Maesteg constituency. Its most famous MP was Ramsay MacDonald. Sir Geoffrey Howe, who although born locally never represented the town in the House of Commons, chose as his peerage title Lord Howe of Aberavon. Since 1999 it has had its own Welsh Assembly constituency.

Aberavon hosted the National Eisteddfod in 1932 and 1966.

Aberavon &amp; Port Talbot Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1905. The course closed following WW2 and the land was used for housing.

==Baglan Industrial Park==

The Baglan Bay Industrial Park lies on a stretch of Baglan Moors in the parish of Aberavon south east of the Baglan Energy Park and immediately northwest of Neath Port Talbot Hospital. It is sandwiched between the M4 Motorway and Afan Way (A4241). Current occupants include Morrisons, Iceland Food Warehouse, Lidl, KFC, Dreams, Screwfix, Pound Stretcher, Pets at Home &amp; Halfords superstores and a Warburtons bread factory in premises which were previously occupied by Panasonic.

==Government and politics==

The electoral ward of Aberavon is coterminous with district of Aberavon and is a part of the Welsh parliamentary constituency of Aberavon.

Aberavon is bounded by the wards of Sandfields West and Sandfields East to the southwest; Baglan to the north; Port Talbot to the east and Margam to the south. The ward boundaries can be defined by the roads surrounding it which are the M4 Motorway to the north east; the A4241 to the north west; Afan Way to the southwest and the River Afan to the south east.

The Aberavon ward can be roughly divided into two parts. There is the residential area to the southeastern part of the ward beside the River Afan. The north western area consists of areas of industrial estate land called the Baglan Industrial Park which includes a number of out of town retail premises as well as business and manufacturing premises.

<text>Inferential role semantics (also conceptual role semantics, functional role semantics, procedural semantics, semantic inferentialism) is an approach to the theory of meaning that identifies the meaning of an expression with its relationship to other expressions (typically its inferential relations with other expressions), in contradistinction to denotationalism, according to which denotations are the primary sort of meaning.

==Overview==
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel is considered an early proponent of what is now called inferentialism. He believed that the ground for the axioms and the foundation for the validity of the inferences are the right consequences and that the axioms do not explain the consequence. 

In its current form, inferential role semantics originated in the work of Wilfrid Sellars.

Contemporary proponents of semantic inferentialism include Robert Brandom, Gilbert Harman, Paul Horwich, Ned Block, and Luca Incurvati.

Jerry Fodor coined the term &quot;inferential role semantics&quot; in order to criticise it as a holistic (i.e. essentially non-compositional) approach to the theory of meaning. Inferential role semantics is sometimes contrasted to truth-conditional semantics. 

Semantic inferentialism is related to logical expressivism and semantic anti-realism. The approach also bears a resemblance to accounts of proof-theoretic semantics in the semantics of logic, which associate meaning with the reasoning process.

<text>Sir Timothy James Alan Colman (19 September 1929 – 9 September 2021) was a British businessman and a Lord Lieutenant of Norfolk.

==Biography==
Colman was from the Colman&#x27;s mustard family, and was the son of Lettice Elizabeth Evelyn Adeane and Geoffrey Colman. Colman was educated at Heatherdown Preparatory School in Berkshire and at the age of 13 enrolled at the Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, and joined the Royal Navy. Colman later served as a second lieutenant on HMS Frobisher and Indefatigable leaving as a lieutenant in 1953, before commencing a business career. He subsequently joined the Castaways&#x27; Club. Colman was chairman of the Eastern Counties Newspaper Group from 1969 to 1996. He was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1996.

Colman was a yachtsman, and claimed the record for the world&#x27;s fastest yacht at 26.3 knots with &quot;Crossbow&quot;, a proa outrigger, at the inception of the World Sailing Speed Record Council in 1972. He increased the record to 31.2 knots three years later, and then in 1980 his catamaran &quot;Crossbow II&quot; extended the record to 36 knots. It held the record for six years until being beaten by the sailboard of Pascal Maka of France. Colman was a member of the Royal Yacht Squadron.

Colman had important roles in establishing the University of East Anglia, the creation of Whitlingham Broad and the Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts.

==Personal life==
His father died in 1935, when Timothy was just six, and his mother brought up him and his four siblings – David, Juliet, Penelope and Russell.

His brother David was killed at El Alamein in 1942 aged 21, the same age that his younger brother Russell died in a railway accident in 1958.

He was married to Lady Mary Colman (née Bowes-Lyon), niece of the Queen Mother, and lived in Bixley Manor, near Norwich. Lady Mary died on 2 January 2021 and Sir Timothy died at Bixley Manor on 9 September 2021, at the age of 91. His death came one day after fellow Knight Companion of the Garter Sir Antony Acland.

Colman&#x27;s children include Sarah Troughton, who was appointed Lord Lieutenant of Wiltshire in 2012.

<text>La Araucana (also known in English as The Araucaniad) is a 16th-century epic poem in Spanish by Alonso de Ercilla, about the Spanish Conquest of Chile. It was considered the national epic of the Captaincy General of Chile and one of the most important works of the Spanish Golden Age (&quot;Siglo de Oro&quot;). It was translated into English in 1945 by Paul Thomas Manchester and Charles Maxwell Lancaster for Vanderbilt University Press.

==The poem==
===Structure===
&quot;La Araucana&quot; consists of 37 cantos that are distributed across the poem&#x27;s three parts. The first part was published in 1569; the second part appeared in 1578, and it was published along with the first part; the third part was published with the first and second parts in 1589. The poem shows Ercilla to be a master of the octava real (that is Italian ottava rima), the complicated stanza in which many other Renaissance epics in Castilian were written. A difficult eight-line unit of 11-syllable verses that are linked by a tight rhyme scheme abababcc, the octava real was a challenge few poets met. It had been adapted from Italian only in the 16th century.

===Subject matter===
The work describes the initial phase of the Arauco War which evolved from the Spanish conquest attempt of southern Chile. The war would come to shape the economics, politics and social life of Chile for centuries. Ercilla placed the lesser conquests of the Spanish in Chile at the core of his poem, because the author was a participant in the conquest and the story is based on his experiences there.

===Development===
On scraps of paper in the lulls of fighting, Ercilla jotted down versified octaves about the events of the war and his own part in it. These stanzas he later gathered together and augmented in number to form his epic. In the minds of the Chilean people &quot;La Araucana&quot; is a kind of Iliad that exalts the heroism, pride, and contempt of pain and death of the legendary Araucanian leaders and makes them national heroes today. Thus we see Ercilla appealing to the concept of the &quot;noble savage,&quot; which has its origins in classical authors and took on a new lease of life in the renaissance – c.f. Montaigne&#x27;s essay &quot;Des Canibales&quot;, and was destined to have wide literary currency in European literature two centuries later. He had, in fact, created a historical poem of the war in Chile which immediately inspired many imitations.

===Influences===
&quot;La Araucana&quot; is deliberately literary and includes fantastical elements reminiscent of medieval stories of chivalry. The narrator is a participant in the story, at the time a new development for Spanish literature. Influences include &quot;Orlando furioso&quot; by Ludovico Ariosto. Also features extended description of the natural landscape. &quot;La Araucana&quot;’s successes—and weaknesses—as a poem stem from the uneasy coexistence of characters and situations drawn from Classical sources (primarily Virgil and Lucan, both translated into Spanish in the 16th century) and Italian Renaissance poets (Ludovico Ariosto and Torquato Tasso) with material derived from the actions of contemporary Spaniards and Araucanians.

The mixture of Classical and Araucanian motifs in &quot;La Araucana&quot; often strikes the modern reader as unusual, but Ercilla&#x27;s turning native peoples into ancient Greeks, Romans, or Carthaginians was a common practice of his time. For Ercilla, the Araucanians were noble and brave—only lacking, as their Classical counterparts did, the Christian faith. Caupolicán, the Indian warrior and chieftain who is the protagonist of Ercilla&#x27;s poem, has a panoply of Classical heroes behind him. His valour and nobility give &quot;La Araucana&quot; grandeur, as does the poem&#x27;s exaltation of the vanquished: the defeated Araucanians are the champions in this poem, which was written by one of the victors, a Spaniard. Ercilla&#x27;s depiction of Caupolicán elevates &quot;La Araucana&quot; above the poem&#x27;s structural defects and prosaic moments, which occur toward the end when Ercilla follows Tasso too closely and the narrative strays from the author&#x27;s lived experience. Ercilla, the poet-soldier, eventually emerges as the true hero of his own poem, and he is the figure that gives the poem unity and strength.

The story is considered to be the first or one of the first works of literature in the New World (cf. Cabeza de Vaca&#x27;s &quot;Naufragios&quot;—&quot;Shipwrecked&quot; or &quot;Castaways&quot;) for its fantastical/religious elements, it is arguable whether that is a &quot;traveler&#x27;s account&quot; or actual literature; and Bernal Díaz del Castillo&#x27;s &quot;Historia verdadera de la conquista de Nueva España&quot; (&quot;The Conquest of New Spain&quot;). &quot;La Araucana&quot;’s more dramatic moments also became a source of plays. But the Renaissance epic is not a genre that has, as a whole, endured well, and today Ercilla is little known and &quot;La Araucana&quot; is rarely read except by specialists and students of Spanish and Latin American literatures, and of course in Chile, where it is subject of special attention in the elementary schools education both in language and history.

==The author==
Alonso de Ercilla was born into a noble family in Madrid, Spain. He occupied several positions in the household of Prince Philip (later King Philip II of Spain), before requesting and receiving appointment to a military expedition to Chile to subdue the Araucanians of Chile, he joined the adventurers. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign; but, having quarrelled with a comrade, he was condemned to death in 1558 by his general, García Hurtado de Mendoza. The sentence was commuted to imprisonment, but Ercilla was speedily released and fought at the Battle of Quipeo (14 December 1558). He was then exiled to Peru and returned to Spain in 1562.

==Reception==
Ercilla embodied the Renaissance ideal of being at once a man of action and a man of letters as no other in his time was. He was adept at blending personal, lived experience with literary tradition. He was widely acclaimed in Spain. There is an episode in Miguel de Cervantes’s 17th-century novel &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, when a priest and barber inspect Don Quixote&#x27;s personal library, to burn the books responsible for driving him to madness. &quot;La Araucana&quot; is one of the works which the men spare from the flames, as &quot;one of the best examples of its genre&quot;, entirely Christian and honorable, and is proclaimed to be among the best poems in the heroic style ever written, good enough to compete with those of Ariosto and Tasso.

Voltaire was much more critical, describing the poem as rambling and directionless and calling the author more barbarous than the Indians whom it is about. He does, however, express admiration for the speech in Canto II, which he compares favorably to Nestor&#x27;s speech in the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

In 1858, the French lawyer Antoine de Tounens, after reading the book in French translation, decided to go to South America to proclaim the kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia with him as king. De Tounens gained the support of a few Mapuche leaders who proclaimed him king, but his kingship and kingdom was never recognized by Chile, Argentina or the European states.

==Events==
A revolt starts when the conqueror of Chile, Pedro de Valdivia is captured and killed by Mapuche (also known as Araucanian) Indians. Ercilla blames Valdivia for his own death, having mistreated the natives who had previously acquiesced to Spanish rule and provoking them into rebellion. However, having previously accepted the rule of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, the Araucanians were now in revolt against their legitimate sovereign lord. This is the ethical position of Ercilla: sympathy for the Indians&#x27; suffering, admiration for the courage of their resistance, criticism of Spanish cruelty, but loyalty to and acceptance of the legitimacy of the Spanish cause (the legitimate rule of a duly-constituted prince and the extension of Christianity). Although Ercilla&#x27;s purpose was to glorify Spanish arms, the figures of Araucanian chiefs, the strong Caupolicán, the brilliant Lautaro, the old and wise Colocolo and the proud Galvarino, have proved the most memorable.

Key events include the capture and execution of Pedro de Valdivia; the death of the hero Lautaro in the Battle of Mataquito, and the execution of Caupolicán the Toqui for leading the revolt of the Araucanians (thanks to betrayal by one of their own); the encounter with a sorcerer who takes the narrator for a flight above the earth to see events happening in Europe and the Middle East; and the encounter with an Indian woman (Glaura) searching for her husband amongst the dead after a battle. This last is an indicator of the humanist side of Ercilla, and a human sympathy which he shows towards the indigenous people. The narrator claims that he attempted to have the life of the Indian chieftain spared.

The historicity of some events and characters have been put into question. Historian Diego Barros Arana has argued that the female character Janequeo is an invention that passed down without scrutiny as historical in the chronicles of the Jesuits Alonso de Ovalle and Diego de Rosales.

<doc id="910058" wikidata="Q7848251" url="?curid=910058" title="Truth-conditional semantics">
<text>Truth-conditional semantics is an approach to semantics of natural language that sees meaning (or at least the meaning of assertions) as being the same as, or reducible to, their truth conditions. This approach to semantics is principally associated with Donald Davidson, and attempts to carry out for the semantics of natural language what Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory of truth achieves for the semantics of logic.

Truth-conditional theories of semantics attempt to define the meaning of a given proposition by explaining when the sentence is true. So, for example, because &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is true if and only if snow is white, the meaning of &#x27;snow is white&#x27; is snow is white.

==History==
The first truth-conditional semantics was developed by Donald Davidson in &quot;Truth and Meaning&quot; (1967). It applied Tarski&#x27;s semantic theory of truth to a problem it was not intended to solve, that of giving the meaning of a sentence.

==Criticism==

===Refutation from necessary truths===
Scott Soames has harshly criticized truth-conditional semantics on the grounds that it is either wrong or uselessly circular.

Under its traditional formulation, truth-conditional semantics gives every necessary truth precisely the same meaning, for all of them are true under precisely the same conditions (namely, all of them). And since the truth conditions of any unnecessarily true sentence are equivalent to the conjunction of those truth conditions and any necessary truth, any sentence means the same as its meaning plus a necessary truth. For example, if &quot;&quot;snow is white&quot; is true if and only if snow is white&quot;, then it is trivially the case that &quot;&quot;snow is white&quot; is true if and only if snow is white and 2+2=4&quot;, therefore under truth-conditional semantics &quot;snow is white&quot; means both that snow is white and that 2+2=4.

Soames argues further that reformulations that attempt to account for this problem must beg the question. In specifying precisely &quot;which&quot; of the infinite number of truth-conditions for a sentence will count towards its meaning, one must take the meaning of the sentence as a guide. However, we wanted to specify meaning with truth-conditions, whereas now we are specifying truth-conditions with meaning, rendering the entire process fruitless.

===Refutation from deficiency===
Michael Dummett (1975) has objected to Davidson&#x27;s program on the grounds that such a theory of meaning will not explain what it is a speaker has to know in order for them to understand a sentence. Dummett believes a speaker must know three components of a sentence to understand its meaning: a theory of sense, indicating the part of the meaning that the speaker grasps; a theory of reference, which indicates what claims about the world are made by the sentence, and a theory of force, which indicates what kind of speech act the expression performs. Dummett further argues that a theory based on inference, such as proof-theoretic semantics, provides a better foundation for this model than truth-conditional semantics does.

===Pragmatic intrusion===
Some authors working within the field of pragmatics have argued that linguistic meaning, understood as the output of a purely formal analysis of a sentence-type, underdetermines truth-conditions. These authors, sometimes labeled &#x27;contextualists&#x27;, argue that the role of pragmatic processes is not just pre-semantic (disambiguation or reference assignment) or post-semantic (drawing implicatures, determining speech acts), but is also key to determining the truth-conditions of an utterance. That is why some contextualists prefer to talk about &#x27;truth-conditional pragmatics&#x27; instead of semantics.

<doc id="910064" wikidata="Q5496669" url="?curid=910064" title="Fredbird">
<text>Fredbird is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals major league baseball team. He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team&#x27;s uniform. Fredbird can always be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from &quot;Redbird&quot;, a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves. Fredbird was introduced on April 6, 1979, by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans at the games.

He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of &quot;beaking&quot; the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by &quot;Team Fredbird&quot;, a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties. He can also be seen rallying the crowd regularly during pregame on-field ceremonies, and, occasionally, he finds time to sit behind (or on top of) the dugout to get the crowd going. After every Cardinal home victory, Fredbird takes a flag with the team&#x27;s logo onto the field and waves it around. He is one of baseball&#x27;s best-known mascots, and he makes hundreds of appearances year-round in the St. Louis area. Fredbird can also be seen on television once a week on the Cardinals Kids TV show with former Cardinal Brad Thompson.
==Controversy==
He came under slight controversy in 2015 when he was seen holding a sign saying &quot;Police Lives Matter&quot; when the Cardinals said that Fredbird was not involved in any sort of political activity. However, a man and a woman asking for a quick photo with Fredbird said that he was unaware of the sign. Eventually, the Cardinals asked the police association that had the sign to take the sign down.

<doc id="910067" wikidata="Q6306122" url="?curid=910067" title="Julia's Kitchen Wisdom">
<text>Julia&#x27;s Kitchen Wisdom (Knopf, 2000) is the final cookbook authored by chef and television personality Julia Child. Co-authored by David Nussbaum and edited by Judith Jones, the book covers basic cooking principles and techniques and was designed to serve as a reference point for amateur cooks. &quot;Julia&#x27;s Kitchen Wisdom&quot; was the 17th book written by Child and gained widespread popularity following the release of the 2009 film, &quot;&#x27;Julie and Julia&#x27;&quot;.

== Description ==
As the final book in Child&#x27;s oeuvre, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; is a compilation of her previous 16 cookbooks, forming a “loose-leaf kitchen reference guide”. It is intended for use by home-cooks to answer cooking questions and solve common cooking problems, such as how long to cook a particular cut of meat, the most suitable accompaniments to serve with a certain dish, or different methods used to cook an ingredient. In the book&#x27;s introduction, Child suggests that the book is written for an audience relatively familiar with the language, techniques and equipment involved in home cooking. Child collaborated on the book with media executive and CEO of &quot;America’s Test Kitchen&quot; David Nussbaum, who helped Child gather and collate material from her extensive body of work, including previous cookbooks and television shows&quot;.‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; followed a television special by the same name, which aired in 2000.

== Inspiration ==
Child&#x27;s education at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in France under the tutelage of chef Max Bugnard was influential in developing Child&#x27;s affinity with French cuisine. Her training and collaboration with friends Simone Beck and Louisette Betholle, whom she founded ‘L’Ecole Des Trois Gourmandes’ (The School of the Three Hearty Eaters) with in 1951, can be credited with teaching Child many of the techniques and recipes she shares in &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’.&quot; Child&#x27;s first and only editor, Judith Jones, credits the increased interest of the American public in French culture and cuisine in the 1960s and 1970s to the success of Child&#x27;s books. An appreciation of French cooking and the widespread popularity of Julia Child may have inspired the publishing of &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’.&quot;

As the final book authored by Child, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; collates the tips and instructions offered in her previous books in a succinct and simplistic manner. It was inspired by the “trials, remedies, and errors” recorded in Child&#x27;s own notebook and is designed to serve as a useful reference for home-cooks. Child&#x27;s earlier books, ‘&quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking: Volume I and II’&quot; and &quot;‘The Way to Cook’&quot; were devised as comprehensive guides that offered highly detailed instruction on techniques, cooking methods, and numerous recipes to educate readers on the fundamentals of French cuisine. According to Child, these books were geared towards “an intelligent, reasonably sophisticated audience which likes good food and cooking”. ‘&quot;Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; is Child&#x27;s most accessible book, distilling the information offered in her previous works into short explanations, methods of problem solving, and master recipes to guide readers. ‘&quot;Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; was inspired by a two-hour television special of the same name which aired in 2000 on PBS.

== Structure ==
Unlike her previous, more thorough cookbooks, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; is structured in a simplistic manner, designed as an easy-to-follow reference guide. It is one of Child’s shortest cookbooks. The book has a particular focus on basic cooking techniques and contains an array of master recipes to guide home-cooks. The book is divided into categories such as ‘Soups and Two Mother Sauces’, ‘Salads and Their Dressings’, ‘Meats, Poultry and Fish’, and so on. Within each main category, there is a master recipe, four to five variations of the master recipe, relevant techniques, and useful tips. The book also contains an extensive index, approximately 20 pages long, where ingredients and their corresponding recipes are alphabetised. The index allows readers to look up a specific ingredient or technique to find answers to common questions relatively quickly. The book is considered popular as it covers many facets of home-cooking in a straightforward manner, despite its relatively brief nature.

== Writing ==
For her final cookbook, Child collaborated on &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; with journalist, media executive and Chief Executive Officer of independent media company &quot;America&#x27;s Test Kitchen,&quot; David Nussbaum. Child and Nussbaum previously collaborated on Child’s second-to-last published cookbook, &quot;‘Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home’&quot;, where Nussbaum worked as the book’s writer. He assisted by drafting recipes and recording commentary between Julia Child and chef, television personality and author, Jacques Pepin. Nussbaum contributed to the creation of &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; by compiling content from Child’s previous works. As the book consists of a number of simplified recipes from Child’s former, more comprehensive books, such as ‘&quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking’&quot;, and Child&#x27;s own notes, tips and findings from her culinary experience, Nussbaum was responsible for amassing and collating potential content for the book. According to Child, Nussbaum assisted her by offering “outlines and suggestions” for the cookbook. Child credits Nussbaum with ensuring &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; was published by its deadline.

In the book&#x27;s ‘Acknowledgments’ section, Child also makes mention of her editor, Judith Jones, who edited all of Child&#x27;s cookbooks. Jones has been credited with introducing American audiences to Julia Child with the publishing of Child&#x27;s first cookbook, ‘&quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking’&quot; in 1961.

== Television special ==
Following the release of Child’s first cookbook ‘&quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking’&quot; in 1961&quot;,&quot; educational television station WGBH in the United States (now known as PBS) offered her a television series entitled &quot;‘The French Chef’&quot;, where she demonstrated how to cook French recipes in half-hour episodes. Child went on to host numerous other television shows inspired by her popular cookbooks. Some of these included ‘&quot;Julia Child and Company’&quot; (1978–79), &quot;‘Baking with Julia’&quot; (1996-98), and the two-hour special &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot;&#x27; which inspired the book.

The television special, ‘&quot;Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’,&quot; aired in 2000 and was a two-hour compilation of videos from Child’s earlier television shows and specials. In between snippets of Child demonstrating recipes, there are brief clips of her peers discussing the impact Child’s work – both her books and television shows – have had on their own careers. The special is seen as more of a tribute to Child and her enduring legacy as opposed to an instructional cooking show. Like the book, the show is organised by categories, such as &quot;‘Vegetables’&quot; and &quot;‘Eggs’&quot; and incorporates information on techniques and tips from Child. The accompanying book is designed to be more instructional than the show itself.

== Response ==
&quot;&#x27;Julia&#x27;s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; garnered positive responses globally and gained increased popularity following the release of the film ‘&quot;Julie and Julia’&quot; in 2009. It was well received in the food community given its simple and easy-to-follow structure. It was also popular as it differed from traditional cookbooks, like Child&#x27;s previous works, that only offer recipes consisting of an ingredient list and method. &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; instead offers recipes along with explanations of technique, advice on what utensils and equipment to use, recipe variations and tips to solve common cooking problems. The book&#x27;s accessible nature and characterisation as a ‘basic’ cookbook suited for home-cooks contributed to the book&#x27;s success and endurance as a timeless kitchen reference guide. The popularity of Julia Child as a chef, home-cook and television personality also contributed to the book&#x27;s success. At the time of publishing, Child was renowned both within and beyond the food industry and was lauded for her ability to encourage amateur cooks to attempt complex meals and techniques. Her reputation of being a reliable source of cooking advice, understanding and know-how is likely to have been influential in eliciting the positive response &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; received.
== Impact ==
Julia Child is remembered for the enduring legacy she has left on the food world. Her cookbooks and television shows have been credited with introducing French cuisine to America and revolutionising home-cooking in both the United States and globally. Whilst her earlier works are revered for their thorough and accurate explanations of French cooking, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; remains popular due to its accessibility for amateur cooks. According to Child, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; is not intended to take the place of her more comprehensive books, such as ‘&quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking’&quot;, but rather serves as an all-purpose guide for basic cooking techniques and recipes.

The release of Nora Ephron’s 2009 film, ‘&quot;Julie and Julia’&quot; led to a resurgence in interest in Child’s works. The film tells the true stories of Julia Child and Julie Powell, a woman who attempts to cook all 524 recipes from &quot;‘Mastering the Art of French Cooking’&quot; in one year. Following the film’s release, &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot;, was propelled to number one on New York Times paperback Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous list. The success of &quot;‘Julia’s Kitchen Wisdom’&quot; five years after her death highlights the enduring popularity of Child’s final book amongst home-cooks and speaks to the lasting impacts of Child’s own legacy. Julia Child is remembered as a teacher, role model and mentor within the food industry. Her first television series ‘&quot;The French Chef’&quot;, which aired in 1963, has been credited with redefining discourse surrounding ‘gourmet dining’ by introducing French cuisine to American home cooks.

<doc id="910070" wikidata="Q4040485" url="?curid=910070" title="Hearst Television">
<text>Hearst Television, Inc. (formerly Hearst-Argyle Television) is a broadcasting company in the United States owned by Hearst Communications, made up of a group of television and radio stations, and the Hearst Media Production Group, a distributor of programming in broadcast syndication.

== History ==
Hearst-Argyle was formed in 1997 with the merger of Hearst Corporation&#x27;s broadcasting division and stations owned by Argyle Television Holdings II, which is partially related to the company of the same name who (in 1994) sold its stations to New World Communications, stations that eventually became Fox-owned stations (Hearst itself, unusual for any American broadcast group, has never held a Fox affiliation on any of its stations). Hearst&#x27;s involvement in broadcasting dates to the 1920s.

In 1980, Hearst Broadcasting purchased WDTN in Dayton, Ohio, from Grinnell College for a price estimated to be $45–48 million.

Hearst-Argyle announced its purchase of the nine television stations and two radio stations owned by Pulitzer Publishing Company in May 1998, in a deal worth $1.15 billion in stock. The acquisition was completed in March 1999.

In terms of audience reach, Hearst is the third-largest group owner of ABC-affiliated stations, behind the E. W. Scripps Company and Sinclair Broadcast Group, and ahead of Tegna Inc., and the second-largest group owner of NBC affiliates, behind Tegna.

Hearst-owned ABC affiliates in National Football League markets simulcast &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; games from ESPN that involve these teams - ESPN is 20% owned by Hearst, the rest being owned by ABC&#x27;s parent, The Walt Disney Company. Other Hearst-owned stations also carry ESPN-aired NFL games, even though they are affiliated with other networks (like WBAL-TV, Baltimore&#x27;s NBC affiliate). Hearst also holds some joint ventures for syndicated programming with NBCUniversal Syndication Studios.

On June 3, 2009, the Hearst Corporation announced that it would purchase substantially all of the stock not held by Hearst. Hearst-Argyle Television then dropped &quot;Argyle&quot; from its name and became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation.

In February 2009, Hearst-Argyle announced that its stations (except for KITV and its satellites in Hawaii, which had already completed their transition to digital, and WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, and WNNE in Hartford, Vermont, which followed the other Champlain Valley stations in transitioning on February 17, 2009) would comply with the new DTV transition date of June 12, 2009.
Currently, Hearst owns a total of 34 overall television stations but considers two groups of four stations and an NBC station with an ABC digital subchannel joint operations, bringing its count down to 31 under that consideration: eleven NBC affiliates, fifteen ABC affiliates (one as a subchannel of an NBC affiliate, and one which acts as a two-station simulcast), two CBS affiliates, six CW affiliates (two traditional, two subchannel (which are part of a two-station simulcast), and two channel shares), one MyNetworkTV affiliate, and one independent station. Most of the company&#x27;s subchannel stations broadcast either Weigel Broadcasting&#x27;s MeTV or NBC&#x27;s Cozi TV through national affiliation deals, along with being charter carriers of Weigel&#x27;s two newest concepts, Heroes &amp; Icons, and Story Television. Since December 1, 2014, Des Moines CBS affiliate KCCI has used its third subchannel as an H&amp;I affiliate carrying MyNetworkTV programming in primetime. Hearst also owns two radio stations in Baltimore, the last remaining from the company divesting most of their radio assets after the Telecommunications Act of 1996 went into effect. As already mentioned above, none of Hearst&#x27;s stations have ever held a Fox affiliation, with the exception of two WMUR translators in the northern part of New Hampshire dis-affiliating with the network upon Hearst&#x27;s assumption of ownership of WMUR.

Some Hearst-owned stations use the &quot;Commitment (Year)&quot; banner for all political news coverage leading up to the local, national, and statewide elections in lieu of a localized version of their associated network&#x27;s political branding. This started in 2000. Hearst also maintains a Washington, D.C. bureau to assist its stations in coverage of national politics, including on-air reporters and facilities and equipment assistance for local stations. Many Hearst stations license the &quot;Operation High School&quot; branding for coverage of local high school sports. In 2007, Hearst-Argyle became one of the first television broadcasting groups to post its news stories on YouTube. WCVB-TV, KCRA-TV, WTAE-TV, WBAL-TV and WMUR-TV were the first stations in Hearst-Argyle&#x27;s station group to do this.

Until 2009, three of Hearst&#x27;s television stations (KCWE, WMOR-TV, and WPBF) and its two radio stations (WBAL radio and WIYY) were owned by Hearst Broadcasting, Inc., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Hearst Corporation through which Hearst ultimately controlled Hearst-Argyle Television, as opposed to Hearst-Argyle itself; Hearst-Argyle still operated these stations under a management services agreement. These stations were transferred to Hearst Television shortly after its privatization. Hearst&#x27;s television and radio cluster in Baltimore additionally serves as the flagship stations and operation bases for the Baltimore Ravens radio and television networks, and as the flagship/operations base for the Baltimore Orioles Radio Network.

On August 20, 2014, it was announced that Hearst Television would acquire WVTM in Birmingham, Alabama, and WJCL in Savannah, Georgia, from Media General, which divested those stations under FCC advisement as part of its acquisition of LIN Media.

In 2021, Hearst began to carry the home shopping network Shop LC on several its stations under a revenue-sharing agreement with that network&#x27;s owners. In most markets, Hearst did not pursue cable or satellite carriage for Shop LC, as the network already pays providers nationwide to carry its network on several channel slots per system.

On September 20, 2021, Hearst launched &quot;Very Local&quot;, an over-the-top media service which consists of news programming from its television stations as well as nationally produced content such as &quot;Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Matter of Fact&quot;.

On April 5, 2023, the company began the process of purchasing NBC affiliate WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, Florida, which would be acquired from Waterman Broadcasting for $220 million. The transaction included the local marketing agreement (LMA) for ABC affiliate WZVN-TV with Montclair Communications. The sale was completed on June 30, 2023.

== Television production ==
Hearst Television also produces the weekly public-affairs program &quot;Matter of Fact with Soledad O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Outside of the Hearst stations and A&amp;E, the show is distributed in national broadcast syndication by Sony Pictures Television.

In 2019, former &quot;Today&quot; consumer affairs reporter Jeff Rossen joined Hearst as a multi-platform consumer affairs reporter, whose reports (which as of April 2020, include COVID-19 pandemic consumer issue Q&amp;A segments) are syndicated throughout the chain, in addition to full-scale semi-annual consumer specials that are also carried by Hearst Television stations.

Hearst once owned Hearst-Argyle Television Productions, a producer and distributor of syndicated programming. As part of Hearst-Argyle&#x27;s acquisition of KCRA-TV in Sacramento, the company also acquired Kelly News &amp; Entertainment, which was merged into Hearst-Argyle Television Productions. In January 2001, NBC Enterprises and Hearst-Argyle agreed to merge their production and distribution operations into a joint venture majority-owned by NBC; this followed a December 2000 deal between the NBC-owned stations, Gannett, and Hearst-Argyle to develop programming. NBC Enterprises continued to produce some programming from a Hearst-Argyle facility near Boston until June 2003.

On January 6, 2017, Hearst acquired majority control of Charleston, South Carolina-based syndicator Litton Entertainment, which has control of four of the five E/I-compliant Saturday morning blocks on the five major broadcast networks, along with being a syndicator of traditional programming. The deal closed on February 1. Hearst acquired the remaining interest in Litton in 2021; in January 2022, it rebranded the entity—which, in addition to Litton&#x27;s existing programming, had also taken over production of &quot;Matter of Fact with Soledad O&#x27;Brien&quot;— as Hearst Media Production Group.

<text>Winnaretta Singer (8 January 186526 November 1943) was an American-born heiress to the Singer sewing machine fortune. She used this to fund a wide range of causes, notably a musical salon where her protégés included Debussy and Ravel, and numerous public health projects in Paris, where she lived most of her life. Singer entered into two marriages that were unconsummated, and openly enjoyed many high-profile relationships with women. She was styled as Princess Louis de Scey-Montbéliard during her first marriage and as Princess Edmond de Polignac following her second marriage in 1893.

==Early life and family==
Winnaretta Singer was born in Yonkers, New York, the twentieth of the 24 children of Isaac Singer. Her mother was his Parisian-born second wife, Isabella Eugénie Boyer. After the American Civil War, the Singer family moved to Paris, where they remained until the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. The family then settled in England, first in London, and then Paignton, Devon where they moved to Oldway Mansion, a 115-room palace built by her father. After Isaac Singer&#x27;s death in 1875, Isabella and her children moved back to Paris. In 1879 Isabella remarried; her new husband was a Belgian violinist, Victor-Nicolas Reubsaet. Presumably, he abused Winnaretta; rumors flew about the violence in their house. As soon as she came of age, Winnaretta seized control of her $1 million inheritance and left to live on her own.

===Relatives===
Winnaretta&#x27;s older brother, Adam Mortimer Singer, became one of England&#x27;s landed gentry. Her younger sister, Isabelle-Blanche (1869–1896) married Jean, duc Decazes. Their daughter, Daisy Fellowes, was raised by Winnaretta after Isabelle-Blanche&#x27;s death and became a noted socialite, magazine editor, and fashion trendsetter. Winnaretta&#x27;s younger brother, Paris Singer, was one of the architects and financiers of the resort of Palm Beach, Florida; he had a son by Isadora Duncan. Another brother, Washington Singer, became a substantial donor to the University College of the southwest of England, which later became the University of Exeter; one of the university&#x27;s buildings is named in his honor.

== Marriages and relationships ==
Although known within private social circles to be a lesbian, Winnaretta married at the age of 22 to Prince Louis de Scey-Montbéliard (fr). The marriage was annulled in 1892 by the Catholic church, five years after a wedding night that reportedly included the bride&#x27;s climbing atop an armoire and threatening to kill the groom if he came near her.

In 1893, at the age of 28, she stepped companionably into an equally chaste marriage with the 59-year-old Prince Edmond de Polignac (1834–1901), a gay amateur composer. Although it was a &quot;mariage blanc&quot; (unconsummated marriage), or indeed a lavender marriage (a union between a gay man and a lesbian), it was based on profound platonic love, mutual respect, understanding, and artistic friendship, expressed especially through their love of music. The same year, Singer exhibited her work at the Palace of Fine Arts at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

===Lesbian relationships===
In the course of her life, Singer had affairs with numerous women, never making attempts to conceal them, and never going for any great length of time without a female lover. She had these affairs during her own marriages and afterwards, and often with other married women. The disgruntled lesser half of one of Singer&#x27;s lovers once stood outside her Venetian palazzo and issued this challenge: &quot;If you are half the man I think you are, you will come out here and fight me.&quot;

Polignac had a relationship with painter Romaine Brooks, which had begun in 1905, and which effectively ended her affair with Olga de Meyer, who was married at the time and whose godfather (and purported biological father) was Edward VII. Composer and conductor Ethel Smyth fell deeply in love with her during their affair. In the early 1920s, Polignac became involved with pianist Renata Borgatti. From 1923 to 1933, her lover was the British socialite and novelist Violet Trefusis, with whom she had a loving but often turbulent relationship. Alvilde Chaplin, the future wife of the author James Lees-Milne, was involved with Polignac from 1938 to 1943; the two women were living together in London at the time of Polignac&#x27;s death. In addition, she had an affair with Virginia Woolf.

==Patron of the arts==
In 1894, the Prince and Princesse de Polignac established a salon in Paris in the music room of their mansion on Avenue Henri-Martin. Their niece by marriage, Jeanne de Montagnac, often assisted in hosting the salons. The Polignac salon came to be known as a haven for avant-garde music. First performances of Chabrier, d&#x27;Indy, Debussy, Fauré, and Ravel took place in the Polignac salon. The young Ravel dedicated his piano work, &quot;Pavane pour une infante défunte&quot;, to the Princesse de Polignac. Many of Marcel Proust&#x27;s evocations of salon culture were born during his attendance at concerts in the Polignac drawing room.

After her husband&#x27;s death, Winnaretta Singer-Polignac used her fortune to benefit the arts, sciences, and letters. She decided to honor his memory by commissioning several works of the young composers of her time, amongst others Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Renard&quot;, Erik Satie&#x27;s &quot;Socrate&quot; (by her intercession Satie was kept out of jail when he was composing this work), Darius Milhaud&#x27;s &quot;Les Malheurs d&#x27;Orphée&quot;, Francis Poulenc&#x27;s Concerto for Two Pianos and Organ Concerto, Jean Françaix&#x27;s &quot;Le Diable boîteux&quot; and &quot;Sérénade pour douze instruments&quot;, Kurt Weill&#x27;s Second Symphony, and Germaine Tailleferre&#x27;s First Piano Concerto. Manuel de Falla&#x27;s &quot;El retablo de maese Pedro&quot; was premiered there, with the harpsichord part performed by Wanda Landowska.

In addition to Proust and Antonio de La Gándara, the Princesse de Polignac&#x27;s salon was frequented by Isadora Duncan, Jean Cocteau, Marguerite de Saint-Marceaux, Claude Monet, Sergei Diaghilev, and Colette. She helped Diaghilev with his Ballets Russes on multiple occasions and financially supported the company. She was also patron to many others, including Nadia Boulanger, Clara Haskil, Dinu Lipatti, Arthur Rubinstein, Vladimir Horowitz, Armande de Polignac, Loie Fuller, Ethel Smyth, Le Corbusier, Adela Maddison, the Ballets Russes, l&#x27;Opéra de Paris, and the Orchestre Symphonique de Paris. In addition to performing as pianist and organist in her own salon, she was an accomplished painter who exhibited in the Académie des Beaux-Arts and in the 1906 International Society of Sculptors, Painters and Gravers. One canvas eventually appeared in the showcase of an art gallery, advertised as being a Manet.

==Public service==
Winnaretta Singer-Polignac was also an important leader in the development of public housing in Paris. Her 1911 building of a housing project for the working poor at Rue de la Colonie, in the 13th arrondissement, was considered to be a model for future projects. In the 1920s and 1930s, Singer commissioned the architect Le Corbusier to rebuild or construct several public shelters for Paris&#x27;s Salvation Army. The plans of Le Corbusier&#x27;s Salvation Army hostel in Paris show a private apartment at the top floor for &quot;Miss Singer&quot;. With her friend Madeleine Zillhardt, she bought the barge &#x27;Louise-Catherine&#x27; named in memory of Zillhardt&#x27;s companion Louise Catherine Breslau. The boat was rehabilitated by Le Corbusier in 1929 in order to be a refuge of the Salvation Army for the homeless in winter and a summer camp for children, moored in Paris on the banks of the Seine, at the Pont des Arts and at the Pont d&#x27;Austerlitz.

During World War I, working with Marie Curie, Singer-Polignac helped convert private limousines into mobile radiology units to help wounded soldiers at the front.

During the inter-war period, Singer-Polignac worked with Consuelo Vanderbilt Balsan and assisted in the construction of a 360-bed hospital destined to provide medical care to middle-class workers. The result of this effort is the Foch Hospital, located in Suresnes, a suburb of Paris, France. The hospital also includes a school of nursing and is one of the top-ranked hospitals in France, especially for renal transplants. It has remained true to its origins and stayed a private not-for-profit institution that still serves the Paris community. It is managed by the Fondation médicale Franco-américaine du Mont-Valérien, commonly called Fondation Foch.

==Fondation Singer-Polignac==
After Singer-Polignac&#x27;s death, her legacy of enlightened generosity was carried on through the work of the Fondation Singer-Polignac. Created in 1928, the goals of the foundation are the promotion, through gifts and bourses, of science, literature, the arts, culture, and French philanthropy. The Foundation continued to present concerts and recitals in the Polignac mansion&#x27;s music room. The performances were first organized by Nadia Boulanger, who presented programs that juxtaposed early music and modern compositions. After Boulanger&#x27;s death in 1979, the composer Jean Françaix took over the organization of the concert series.

<doc id="910078" wikidata="Q1026652" url="?curid=910078" title="Calexico (band)">
<text>Calexico is an American indie rock band based in Tucson, Arizona. Founded in 1996, the band&#x27;s two main members, Joey Burns and John Convertino, first played together in Los Angeles as part of the group Giant Sand. They have recorded a number of albums on Quarterstick Records and City Slang, and their 2005 EP, &quot;In the Reins&quot;, recorded with Iron &amp; Wine, reached the Billboard 200 album charts. Their musical style is influenced by traditional Latin sounds of mariachi, conjunto, cumbia, and tejano mixed with country, jazz, and post-rock.

The band is named for the border town of Calexico, California, and has been described by some as &quot;desert noir&quot;.

==History==

===Formation ===

Calexico had its origins in 1990 when Joey Burns, who was studying music at the University of California, Irvine, met up with John Convertino, who was playing drums with Howe Gelb in Giant Sand. Burns also joined Giant Sand, after first playing upright bass on a European tour. Giant Sand moved to Tucson, Arizona in 1994.

Around this time, Burns and Convertino also played in the Friends of Dean Martinez along with Bill Elm. This group signed a record deal with Sub Pop. However, the pair split up with Bill Elm, the co-founder of The Friends of Dean Martinez in 1996. The band subsequently became a kind of indie rhythm section for hire, working with the likes of Victoria Williams, Bill Janovitz, Barbara Manning and Richard Buckner before forming Calexico.

Calexico first recorded &quot;Spoke&quot; in 1995 for German independent label &quot;Hausmusik&quot; with a limited edition of 2,000 copies. At that point the band was still called Spoke and the album was technically self-titled. After the band signed with Quarterstick Records (a subsidiary of Touch and Go Records) and changed their name to Calexico, &quot;Spoke&quot; was reissued by that label in 1997. Burns and Convertino also collaborated with Gelb and Lisa Germano on the album &quot;Slush&quot; released under the name OP8 that same year.

===Early years (1998 - 2005)===
Their second album &quot;The Black Light&quot; was released in 1998. This was a concept album about the desert of Arizona and northern Mexico and received excellent reviews, with the critic from the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; rating it as one of the best records of the year.

The band built their profile by touring as support acts for bands such as Pavement, the Dirty Three and Lambchop. Calexico has regularly played festivals such as the Bonnaroo Music Festival, the Hurricane Festival and All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties. The &quot;Road Map&quot; album was a limited recording released in 1999 for sale only at Calexico&#x27;s live shows.

Calexico released its third album &quot;Hot Rail&quot; in May 2000 featuring the addition of horns and violin to their sound. The duo was busy in 2000 as they also appeared on a Giant Sand record called &quot;Chore of Enchantment&quot; as well as a tour only record &quot;Travelall&quot;.

At the end of 2000, Burns and Convertino joined with two French friends Naïm Amor and Thomas Belhôm to record &quot;Tête A Tête&quot; (Wabana Records, 2001) released under moniker ABBC (Amor/Belhom/Burns/Convertino). Calexico released two collections of rarities during 2001. &quot;Even My Sure Things Fall Through&quot; collected outtakes from previous albums, B-sides, remixes and material previously unreleased in the US. The album also featured Mariachi Luz de Luna who frequently played live with the duo. The &quot;Aerocalexico&quot; album was sold exclusively at their gigs in 2001. Their songs &quot;Ballad Of Cable Hogue&quot; and &quot;Service And Repair&quot; were featured in the 2001 German comedy movie &quot;Lammbock&quot;. 

In 2003 they released &quot;Feast of Wire&quot; which was considered their breakthrough album, praised by Mojo.

=== &quot;Garden Ruin&quot; to &quot;Edge of the Sun&quot; (2006 to 2017) ===
Released in 2006, &quot;Garden Ruin&quot; is Calexico&#x27;s fifth studio album and was produced by JD Foster. The sound strays slightly from earlier works, focusing less on the horn section and placing more emphasis on guitar and vocal tracks, giving the whole album a more contemporary Indie sound.

Their sixth studio LP is called &quot;Carried to Dust&quot;, featuring Sam Beam of Iron &amp; Wine, Douglas McCombs of Tortoise and Pieta Brown. It was released in the US via Touch &amp; Go Records on September 9, 2008. The album was positively reviewed. On October 16, 2008, a three-song live acoustic video performance premiered on LiveDaily Sessions, featuring Joey Burns performing the songs &quot;Two Silver Trees&quot;, &quot;Writer&#x27;s Minor Holiday&quot; and &quot;Man Made Lake&quot;. In 2009, the song &quot;Banderilla&quot; was featured in an episode of AMC&#x27;s Breaking Bad.

In 2010, Calexico released the soundtrack of the documentary &quot;Circo&quot;. The band also spent part of 2010 touring with Arcade Fire along the US west coast. In May 2011, their song &quot;Slowness&quot; was dedicated by Gabby Giffords to her husband astronaut Mark Kelly as the wake up song aboard the Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot; on its final flight. &quot;Algiers&quot; was released 11 September 2012 on Anti-Records and City Slang (Europe). Algiers is titled after the neighborhood of New Orleans where it was recorded, Algiers, New Orleans. This was Calexico&#x27;s seventh studio album.

In April 2013, Calexico released the album &quot;Edge of the Sun&quot;. The album features guest appearances by Neko Case, Sam Beam (Iron &amp; Wine), Ben Bridwell (Band of Horses), Gaby Moreno, Carla Morrison and members of the Greek instrumental group Takim. Burns commented how happy he was to work with Sergio Mendoza on writing the songs for the album. Mendoza also co-produced the album along with Burns and Convertino. This album was also released on Anti-Records. In 2016, the band performed on the main stage at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival.

=== &quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot; (2018 to present) ===
In 2018, Calexico released &quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot;. The album was recorded in Northern California in a home-turned-studio called Panoramic House. The band called this space “The Phantom Ship”. The album was co-produced by their longtime engineer Craig Schumacher. Calexico and Schumacher recruited musicians from all across the globe to find an earthy yet expansive sound. “There&#x27;s a little more chaos and noise in the mix than what we&#x27;ve done in the past,” Burns points out. The rugged coastline of northern California impacted the making of &quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot;. This sound is heard throughout the album. The album was released by Anti-Records and City Slang on January 26, 2018.

&quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot; was #2 on the Alternative Albums retail chart and #5 on the Americana / Folk Chart in the USA in its first week of sales (&quot;Billboard&quot;). &quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot; also entered the charts in Europe at #7 in Germany, #13 in Belgium, #21 in Netherlands, #47 in France, #58 in the United Kingdom, and #60 in Italy.

On March 21, 2019, Calexico and Iron &amp; Wine announced &quot;Years to Burn&quot;, their first full-length collaboration album. It was released on June 14, 2019 via Sub Pop.

Then, on December 4, 2020, they released their eleventh album &quot;Seasonal Shift&quot; via Anti- and City Slang.

In February 2022, Calexico announced that their thirteenth studio album, &quot;El Mirador&quot;, would be released on April 8, 2022.

The band reissued and toured &quot;Feast of Wire&quot; in 2023; the album&#x27;s twentieth anniversary.

== Critical acclaim ==
Their debut album &quot;Spoke&quot; received three stars from AllMusic, which called the album &quot;a Santa Fe rummage sale of sounds.&quot; Their second album &quot;The Black Light&quot;, released in 1998, gained the band notoriety and attention. AllMusic praised this sophomore effort and gave the album 4.5 stars. The album was praised for being &quot;deeper and richer than their debut.&quot;

&quot;Hot Rail&quot; was released in 2000 and continued off the success of previous albums. Pitchfork gave the album a 7.9. The band then took a brief hiatus and released their next studio album in 2003, &quot;Feast of Wire&quot;. The album received an 8.9 from Pitchfork, which described it as &quot;the album we always knew they had in them but feared they would never make.&quot;

Feast of Wire was well received by Mojo, describing the 2003 album as, “Seductive, stirring songs about crushed hope and the corruption of beauty and some of their most ambitious arrangements make this their most fully-realised and accomplished album”.

Again after another hiatus, Calexico returned in 2006 with &quot;Garden Ruin&quot;. Amazon gave their album a 90/100 and described it as &quot;what Sigur Ros might sound like if they came from Arizona, and it&#x27;s truly excellent.&quot; In 2008, came &quot;Carried to Dust&quot;. By now Calexico was already established as a band who meticulously created beautiful albums. This success continued with &quot;Carried to Dust&quot; receiving 4.5 stars from AllMusic. Describing the album as &quot;their most balanced, channeling their experience and potential into a subtly dramatic, chiaroscuro tour de force.&quot;

2012 was a busy year for Calexico, giving birth to a new album titled &quot;Algiers&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; gave the album an A−. Another studio album came in 2015; titled &quot;Edge of the Sun&quot;. This album also received high ranks from reviewers. Rough Trade called it the twenty-first best album of 2015. Their next studio album came in 2018, &quot;The Thread That Keeps Us&quot;. Exclaim! rated the album a 4 out of 10.

<doc id="910082" wikidata="Q2140610" url="?curid=910082" title="Fangtooth">
<text>Fangtooths are beryciform fish of the family Anoplogastridae (sometimes spelled &quot;Anoplogasteridae&quot;) that live in the deep sea. The name is from the Greek , meaning &quot;unarmed&quot;, and (), meaning &quot;stomach&quot;. With a worldwide distribution in tropical and cold-temperate waters, the family contains only two very similar species in one genus, with no known close relatives.

==Species==
The currently recognized species in this genus are:
* &quot;Anoplogaster brachycera&quot; (shorthorn fangtooth)
* &quot;Anoplogaster cornuta&quot; (common fangtooth)

==Description==
While named for their disproportionately large, fang-like teeth and unapproachable visage, fangtooths are actually quite small and harmless to humans: the larger of the two species, the common fangtooth, reaches a maximum length of just ; the shorthorn fangtooth is less than half this size though currently known only from juvenile specimens.

&quot;Anoplogaster cornuta&quot; are in the smaller size range of fishes. They are well known for their large sharp teeth when having their jaws closed. With the help of their teeth they are able to kill fishes much larger than themselves. The head is small with a large jaw and appears haggard, riddled with mucous cavities delineated by serrated edges and covered by a thin skin. The eyes are relatively small, set high on the head; the entire head is a dark brown to black and is strongly compressed laterally, deep anteriorly and progressively more slender towards the tail. 
In adults, the largest two fangs of the lower jaw are so long, the fangtooths have evolved a pair of opposing sockets on either side of the brain to accommodate the teeth when the mouth is closed. According to BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Planet&quot;, episode &quot;The Deep&quot;, the fangtooth has the largest teeth of any fish in the ocean, proportionate to body size, and are so large, they can never close their mouths. The juveniles are morphologically quite different - unlike the adults, they possess long spines on the head and preoperculum, larger eyes, a functional gas bladder, long and slender gill rakers, much smaller and depressible teeth, and are a light gray in colour. These differences once caused the two life stages to be classed as distinct species, with one in another genus; &quot;Caulolepis&quot;.

Unlike many other fish, the fangtooth&#x27;s large, fang-like teeth are permanently attached to their jaw bones without replacement. These teeth also lack the typical calcium-phosphate layer seen in other fish teeth, a feature that may contribute to the fangtooth’s survival in the extreme conditions of the deep sea.
The fins are small, simple, and spineless; the scales are embedded in the skin and take the form of thin plates. As compensation for reduced eyes, the lateral line is well-developed and appears as an open groove along the flanks.
==Ecology==
The pelagic fangtooths are among the deepest-living fish, found as far as down. They are more commonly found between , however, and juveniles apparently stay within the upper reaches of this range. They may undergo diel migrations as is common with many deep-sea fish: by day these fish remain in the gloomy depths and towards evening they rise to the upper layers of the water column to feed by starlight, returning to deep water by daybreak. Fangtooths may form small schools or go alone. They are thought to use contact chemoreception to find prey. 

The smaller teeth and longer gill rakers of juveniles suggest they feed primarily by filtering zooplankton from the water, while the deeper-living adults target other fish and squid. The fangtooths&#x27; oversized teeth and mouths are a common feature among the miniature beasts of the deep (&quot;cf.&quot; viperfishes, daggertooths, bristlemouths, barracudinas, anglerfishes), thought to be an advantage in these lean waters where anything encountered (even if it is larger than the fish) must be considered a possible meal. The fangtooths in turn are preyed upon by other large pelagic fish, such as tuna and marlin and some species of sharks.

Fangtooths are known to be robust when compared to many other deep-sea fish; they have been kept alive for months in aquariums despite conditions which are significantly different from their usual deep-sea habitat.

==Reproduction==
Fangtooths have planktonic larvae and are assumed to not be egg guarders; spawning frequency and time are not certain, but some activity has been reported from June–August. The juveniles of common fangtooths begin to assume adult form from about in length, at which time they begin to descend into deeper water. Onset of maturity is not known, but common fangtooths are known to be mature at . They are likely slow-growing, as are most deep-sea fish.

<text>The Spanish Golden Age (Spanish: Siglo de Oro , &quot;Golden Century&quot;) (1492 - 1700) was a period that coincided with the political rise of the Spanish Empire under the Catholic Monarchs of Spain and the Spanish Habsburgs. This era saw a flourishing of literature and the arts in Spain. The most significant patron of Spanish art and culture during this time was King Philip II (1556–1598). However, the period is more broadly associated with the reigns of Isabella I, Ferdinand II, Charles V, Philip II, Philip III, and Philip IV, when Spain was at the peak of its power and influence in Europe and the world.

During this period, Philip II&#x27;s royal palace, El Escorial, attracted some of Europe&#x27;s greatest architects and painters, including El Greco. These artists introduced foreign styles to Spanish art, contributing to the development of a uniquely Spanish style of painting.

The start of the Golden Age can be placed in 1492, with the end of the &quot;Reconquista&quot;, the voyages of Christopher Columbus to the New World, the expulsion of Jews from Spain, and the publication of Antonio de Nebrija&#x27;s &quot;Grammar of the Castilian Language&quot;. Amongst scholars of the period, it is generally accepted that it came to an end around the time of the Treaty of the Pyrenees (1659), that concluded the Franco-Spanish War of 1635 to 1659. Others, however, extend the Golden Age up to 1681 with the death of Pedro Calderón de la Barca, the last great writer of the age. Generally, it is divided into a Plateresque/Renaissance period and the early part of the Spanish Baroque period.

The Spanish Golden Age spans the work of Miguel de Cervantes, the author of &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha;&quot; and of Lope de Vega, Spain&#x27;s most prolific playwright, who wrote around 1,000 plays during his lifetime, of which over 400 survive to the present day. Lope de Vega, Luis de Gongora, and other poets attended the famous Medrano Academy (also known as the Poetic Academy in Madrid) established by Sebastián Francisco de Medrano in 1616.

Diego Velázquez, regarded as one of the most influential painters of European history and a greatly respected artist in his own time, was patronized by King Philip IV and his chief minister, the Count-Duke of Olivares.

What is widely acknowledged as some of Spain&#x27;s greatest music was written during this period. Composers such as Tomás Luis de Victoria, Cristóbal de Morales, Francisco Guerrero, Luis de Milán and Alonso Lobo helped to shape Renaissance music and the styles of counterpoint and polychoral music. Their influence lasted long into the Baroque period, resulting in a revolution of music.

==Painting==

During the Italian Renaissance, few great artists from Italy visited Spain, but the Italian holdings and relationships established by Ferdinand of Aragon, Queen Isabella&#x27;s husband and, later, Spain&#x27;s sole monarch, prompted a steady flow of intellectuals across the Mediterranean between Valencia, Seville, and Florence. Luis de Morales, one of the leading exponents of Spanish Mannerist painting, retained a distinctly Spanish style in his work, reminiscent of medieval art. Spanish art, particularly Morales&#x27;s, was notable for its mysticism and religious themes, which were encouraged by the Counter-Reformation and by the patronage of Spain&#x27;s Catholic monarchs and aristocracy. Spanish rule of Naples was important for making connections between Italian and Spanish art, with many Spanish administrators bringing Italian works back to Spain.

===El Greco===
Known for his unique expressionistic style, which elicited both puzzlement and admiration, El Greco (&quot;the Greek&quot;) was originally from the island of Crete. He was not Spanish but Greek by birth. El Greco studied the great Italian masters of his time—Titian, Tintoretto, and Michelangelo—during his stay in Italy from 1568 to 1577. According to legend, El Greco once claimed he would paint a mural as good as one of Michelangelo&#x27;s if one of the Italian artist&#x27;s murals was demolished first. After falling out of favor in Italy, he found a new home in Toledo, central Spain. During this period, Spain was an ideal environment for the Venetian-trained painter, with art flourishing throughout the empire and Toledo being a great place to receive commissions. His paintings of the city became models for a new European tradition in landscapes and influenced the work of later Dutch masters. In his lifetime, El Greco was influential in creating a style based on impressions and emotion, characterized by elongated fingers and vibrant color and brushwork. His works uniquely featured faces that captured expressions of somber attitudes and withdrawal while still having his subjects bear witness to the terrestrial world.

===Diego Velázquez===

Diego Velázquez was born on June 6, 1599, in Seville, to parents of minor nobility and was the eldest of six children. Widely regarded as one of Spain&#x27;s most important and influential artists, he became a court painter for King Philip IV and gained increasing demand across Europe for his portraits of statesmen, aristocrats, and clergymen. His portraits of the King, his chief minister the Count-Duke of Olivares, and the Pope showcased his belief in artistic realism and a style comparable to many of the Dutch masters. Following the Thirty Years&#x27; War, Velázquez met the Marqués de Spinola and painted his famous Surrender of Breda (1635), celebrating Spinola&#x27;s victory at Breda in 1625. Spinola was impressed by Velázquez&#x27;s ability to convey emotion through realism in both his portraits and landscapes, the latter of which became a lasting influence on Western painting. Velázquez&#x27;s friendship with Bartolomé Esteban Murillo, a leading Spanish painter of the next generation, ensured the enduring influence of his artistic approach.

Velázquez&#x27;s most famous painting is the celebrated (1656, Prado Museum in Madrid) in which the artist includes himself as one of the subjects.

===Francisco de Zurbarán===
The religious element in Spanish art gained prominence in many circles during the Counter-Reformation. The austere, ascetic, and severe works of Francisco de Zurbarán exemplified this trend in Spanish art, alongside the compositions of Tomás Luis de Victoria. Philip IV actively patronized artists whose views aligned with his perspectives on the Counter-Reformation and religion. The mysticism in Zurbarán&#x27;s work, influenced by Saint Theresa of Avila, became a defining characteristic of Spanish art in subsequent generations. Influenced by Michelangelo da Caravaggio and the Italian masters, Zurbarán dedicated himself to an artistic expression of religion and faith. His paintings of St. Francis of Assisi, the Immaculate Conception, and the Crucifixion of Christ reflected a significant aspect of seventeenth-century Spanish culture, set against the backdrop of religious conflict across Europe. Zurbarán diverged from Velázquez&#x27;s sharp realist interpretation of art and, to some extent, drew inspiration from the emotive content of El Greco and earlier Mannerist painters. Nevertheless, Zurbarán respected and maintained the lighting and physical nuance characteristic of Velázquez&#x27;s style.

It is unknown whether Zurbarán had the opportunity to study Caravaggio&#x27;s paintings; nonetheless, he adopted Caravaggio&#x27;s realistic use of chiaroscuro. The painter who may have had the greatest influence on his characteristically severe compositions was Juan Sánchez Cotán. Additionally, polychrome sculpture—which had reached a high level of sophistication in Seville by the time of Zurbarán&#x27;s apprenticeship and surpassed that of the local painters—served as another important stylistic model for the young artist. The work of Juan Martínez Montañés is particularly close to Zurbarán&#x27;s in spirit.

Zurbarán painted directly from nature and frequently utilized the lay figure in his study of draperies, in which he was particularly skilled. He had a notable talent for depicting white draperies, leading to numerous representations of the white-robed Carthusians in his works. Zurbarán is said to have adhered to these meticulous methods throughout his career, which was successful and spent entirely in Spain. His subjects were predominantly austere and ascetic religious scenes, often depicting the spirit subduing the flesh. These compositions were frequently simplified to a single figure. His style is more reserved and subdued than Caravaggio&#x27;s, with a color tone that is often bluish. Exceptional effects are achieved through precisely finished foregrounds, primarily utilizing light and shade.

===Bartolomé Esteban Murillo===
Bartolomé Esteban Murillo began his art studies under Juan del Castillo in Seville. The city&#x27;s great commercial importance at the time ensured that he was also subject to influences from other regions, which enabled him to become familiar with Flemish painting. His first works were influenced by Zurbarán, Jusepe de Ribera and Alonso Cano, with whom he shared a strongly realist approach. As his painting developed, however, his more important works evolved into a polished style that suited the bourgeois and aristocratic tastes of the time, especially his Roman Catholic religious works.

In 1642, at the age of 26, he moved to Madrid. While there, it is highly likely that he became familiar with the work of Velázquez and that he viewed the work of Venetian and Flemish masters in the royal collections; the influence of both can be seen in the rich colors and softly modeled forms of his later work. Murillo returned to Seville in 1645, where in the same year he painted 13 canvases for the monastery of St. Francisco el Grande. This proved a boost to his reputation. Following the completion of a pair of pictures for the Seville Cathedral, he began to specialize in the themes that brought him his greatest successes: Mary and the Child Jesus, and the Immaculate Conception.

After another period in Madrid from 1658 to 1660, he returned to Seville. There, he was one of the founders of the Academia de Bellas Artes (Academy of Fine Arts), sharing its direction in 1660 with the architect Francisco Herrera the Younger. This was his period of greatest activity, during which he received numerous important commissions, among them the altarpieces for the Augustinian monastery and the paintings for Santa María la Blanca (completed in 1665). He died in 1682.

==Architecture==
===Palace of Charles V===
The Palace of Charles V is a Renaissance construction located on the top of the hill of the Assabica, inside the Nasrid fortification of the Alhambra. It was commanded by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, who wished to establish his residence close to the Alhambra palaces. Although the Catholic Monarchs had already altered some rooms of the Alhambra after the conquest of the city in 1492, Charles V intended to construct a permanent residence befitting an emperor. The project was given to Pedro Machuca, an architect whose biography and influences are poorly understood. Even if accounts that place Machuca in the atelier of Michelangelo are accepted, at the time of the construction of the palace in 1527 the latter had yet to design the majority of his architectural works. At the time, Spanish architecture was immersed in the Plateresque style, still with traces of Gothic origin. Machuca built a palace corresponding stylistically to Mannerism, a mode still in its infancy in Italy.

===El Escorial===
El Escorial is the historical residence of the king of Spain. It is one of the Spanish royal sites and functions as a monastery, royal palace, museum, and school. It is located about northwest of the Spanish capital, Madrid, in the town of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. El Escorial comprises two architectural complexes of great historical and cultural significance: El Real Monasterio de El Escorial itself and La Granjilla de La Fresneda, a royal hunting lodge and monastic retreat about five kilometers away. These sites have a dual nature; that is to say, during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, they were places in which the temporal power of the Spanish monarchy &quot;and&quot; the ecclesiastical predominance of the Roman Catholic religion in Spain found a common architectural manifestation. El Escorial was at once, a monastery and a Spanish royal palace. Originally a property of the Hieronymite monks, it is now a monastery of the Order of Saint Augustine.

Philip II of Spain, reacting to the Protestant Reformation sweeping through Europe during the sixteenth century, devoted much of his lengthy reign (1556–1598) and much of his seemingly inexhaustible supply of New World silver to stemming the Protestant tide sweeping through Europe while simultaneously fighting the Islamic Ottoman Empire. His protracted efforts were, in the long run, partly successful. However, the same counter-reformational impulse had a much more benign expression thirty years earlier, in Philip&#x27;s decision to build the complex at El Escorial.

Philip engaged the Spanish architect, Juan Bautista de Toledo, to be his collaborator in the design of El Escorial. Juan Bautista had spent the greater part of his career in Rome, where he had worked on the basilica of St. Peter&#x27;s, and in Naples, where he had served the king&#x27;s viceroy, whose recommendation brought him to the king&#x27;s attention. Philip appointed him architect-royal in 1559, and together they designed El Escorial as a monument to Spain&#x27;s role as a center of the Christian world.

===Plaza Mayor in Madrid===
The Plaza Mayor in Madrid, built during the Habsburg period, is a central plaza in the city of Madrid, Spain. It is located only a few blocks away from another famous plaza, the Puerta del Sol. The Plaza Mayor is rectangular in shape, measuring 129 by 94 meters, and is surrounded by three-story residential buildings having 237 balconies facing the Plaza. It has a total of nine entranceways. The Casa de la Panadería, serving municipal and cultural functions, dominates the Plaza Mayor.

The origins of the Plaza date back to 1589 when Philip II of Spain asked Juan de Herrera, a renowned Renaissance architect, to discuss a plan to remodel the busy and chaotic area of the old Plaza del Arrabal. Juan de Herrera was the architect who designed the first project in 1581 to remodel the old Plaza del Arrabal but construction did not start until 1617, during Philip III&#x27;s reign. The king asked Juan Gómez de Mora to continue with the project, and he finished the porticoes in 1619. Nevertheless, the Plaza Mayor as we know it today is the work of the architect Juan de Villanueva who was entrusted with its reconstruction in 1790 after a spate of big fires. Giambologna&#x27;s equestrian statue of Philip III dates to 1616, but it was not placed in the center of the square until 1848.

===Granada Cathedral===
Unlike most cathedrals in Spain, construction of this cathedral had to await the acquisition of the Nasrid kingdom of Granada from its Muslim rulers in 1492. While its very early plans had Gothic designs, such as are evident in the Royal Chapel of Granada by Enrique Egas, the construction of the church in the main occurred at a time when Renaissance designs were supplanting the Gothic regnant in Spanish architecture of prior centuries. Foundations for the church were laid by the architect Egas starting from 1518 to 1523 atop the site of the city&#x27;s main mosque; by 1529, Egas was replaced by Diego de Siloé who labored for nearly four decades on the structure from ground to cornice, planning the triforium and five naves instead of the usual three. Most unusually, he created a circular capilla mayor rather than a semicircular apse, perhaps inspired by Italian ideas for circular &#x27;perfect buildings&#x27; (e.g., in Alberti&#x27;s works). Within its structure the cathedral combines other orders of architecture. It took 181 years for the cathedral to be built.

Subsequent architects included Juan de Maena (1563–1571), followed by Juan de Orea (1571–1590), and Ambrosio de Vico (1590–?). In 1667, Alonso Cano, working with Gaspar de la Peña, altered the initial plan for the main façade, introducing Baroque elements. The magnificence of the building would be even greater if the two large 81-meter towers foreseen in the plans had been built; however, the project remained incomplete for various reasons, including finance.

Granada Cathedral had been intended to become the royal mausoleum for Charles I of Spain, but Philip II of Spain moved the site for his father and subsequent kings to El Escorial outside of Madrid.

The main chapel contains two kneeling effigies of the Catholic King and Queen, Ferdinand and Isabel, by Pedro de Mena y Medrano. The busts of Adam and Eve were made by Alonso Cano. The Chapel of the Trinity has a marvelous retablo with paintings by El Greco, Alonso Cano, and José de Ribera (The &quot;Spagnoletto&quot;).

===Cathedral of Valladolid===
The Cathedral of Valladolid, like all the buildings of the late Spanish Renaissance built by Herrera and his followers, is known for its purist and sober decoration, with its style being typical Spanish &quot;clasicismo&quot;, also called &quot;Herrerian&quot;. Using classical and Renaissance decorative motifs, Herrerian buildings are characterized by their extremely sober decorations, their formal austerity, and its like for monumentality.

The cathedral has its origins in a late Gothic college that started in the late 15th century. Before becoming the capital of Spain, Valladolid was not a bishopric and thus lacked the right to build a cathedral. Soon enough, though, the Collegiate became obsolete due to the changes of preference during the period, and thanks to the newly established episcopal in the city, the Town Council decided to build a cathedral that would share similar architecture to neighboring capitals.

Had the building been finished, it would have been one of the biggest cathedrals in Spain. When the building was started, Valladolid was the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of Spain, housing King Philip II and his court. However, due to strategic and geopolitical reasons, by the 1560s, the capital was moved to Madrid, making Valladolid lose its political and economic relevance. By the late sixteenth century, Valladolid&#x27;s importance had been severely reduced, and many of the monumental projects, such as the cathedral, started during its prosperous years, had to be modified due to a lack of proper finance. Thus, the building that stands now could not be finished completely, and due to several additions built during the 17th and 18th centuries, it lacks the purported stylistical uniformity sought by Herrera. Although mainly faithful to the project of Juan de Herrera, the building would undergo many modifications.

==Music==
=== Tomás Luis de Victoria ===
Tomás Luis de Victoria, a Spanish composer of the sixteenth century, mainly of choral music, is widely regarded as one of the greatest Spanish classical composers. He joined the cause of Ignatius of Loyola in the fight against the Reformation and, in 1575, became a priest. He lived for a short time in Italy, where he became acquainted with the polyphonic work of Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina. Like Zurbarán, Victoria mixed the technical qualities of Italian art with the religion and culture of his native Spain. He invigorated his work with emotional appeal, experimental mystical rhythm, and choruses. He broke from the dominant tendency among his contemporaries by avoiding complex counterpoint, preferring longer, simpler, less technical, and more mysterious melodies, and employing dissonance in ways that the Italian members of the Roman School shunned. He demonstrated considerable invention in musical thought by connecting the tone and emotion of his music to those of his lyrics, particularly in his motets. Like Velázquez, Victoria was employed by the monarch – in Victoria&#x27;s case, in the service of the queen. The Officium Defunctorum (Requiem) he wrote upon her death in 1603 is regarded as one of his most enduring and complex works.

=== Francisco Guerrero ===
Francisco Guerrero, a Spanish composer of the 16th century. He was second only to Victoria as a major Spanish composer of church music in the second half of the 16th century. Of all the Spanish Renaissance composers, he was the one who mostly lived and worked in Spain. Others, e.g., Morales and Victoria, spent large portions of their careers in Italy. Guerrero&#x27;s music was both religious and secular, unlike that of Victoria and Morales, the two other Spanish 16th-century composers of the first rank. He wrote numerous secular songs and instrumental pieces, in addition to masses, motets, and passions. He was able to capture an astonishing variety of moods in his music, from elation to despair, longing, depression, and devotion. His music remained popular for hundreds of years, especially in cathedrals in Latin America. Stylistically, he preferred homophonic textures rather than Spanish contemporaries. One feature of his style is how he anticipated functional harmonic usage: there is a case of a Magnificat discovered in Lima, Peru, once thought to be an anonymous 18th century work, which turned out to be his work.

=== Alonso Lobo ===
Victoria&#x27;s work was complemented by Alonso Lobo – a man Victoria respected as his equal. Lobo&#x27;s work—also choral and religious in its content – stressed the austere, minimalist nature of religious music. Lobo sought out a medium between the emotional intensity of Victoria and the technical ability of Palestrina; the solution he found became the foundation of the Baroque musical style in Spain.

=== Cristóbal de Morales ===
Regarded as one of the finest composers in Europe around the middle of the 16th century, Cristóbal de Morales was born in Seville in 1500 and employed in Rome from 1535 until 1545 by the Vatican. Almost all of his music is religious, and all of it is vocal, though instruments may have been used in an accompanying role in performance. Morales also wrote two masses on the famous &quot;L&#x27;homme armé&quot; melody, which was often set by composers in the late 15th and 16th centuries. One of these masses is for four voices, and the other for five. The four voice mass uses the tune as a strict cantus firmus, and the setting for five voices treats it more freely, migrating it from one voice to another.

==Literature==

The Spanish Golden Age was a time of great flourishing in poetry, prose and drama.

===Cervantes and &quot;Don Quixote&quot;===

Regarded by many as one of the finest works in any language, &quot;El ingenioso hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot; by Miguel de Cervantes was the first novel published in Europe; it gave Cervantes a stature in the Spanish-speaking world comparable to his contemporary William Shakespeare in English. The novel, like Spain itself, was caught between the Middle Ages and the modern world. A veteran of the Battle of Lepanto (1571), Cervantes had fallen on hard times in the late 1590s and was imprisoned for debt in 1597, and some believe that during these years he began work on his best-remembered novel. The first part of the novel was published in 1605; the second in 1615, a year before the author&#x27;s death. &quot;Don Quixote&quot; resembled both the medieval, chivalric romances of an earlier time and the novels of the early modern world. It parodied classical morality and chivalry, found comedy in knighthood, and criticized social structures and the perceived madness of Spain&#x27;s rigid society. The work has endured to the present day as a landmark in world literary history, and it was an international hit in its own time, interpreted variously as a satirical comedy, social commentary and forebear of self-referential literature.

===Lope de Vega and Spanish drama===
A contemporary of Cervantes, Lope de Vega consolidated the essential genres and structures that would characterize the Spanish commercial drama, also known as &quot;Comedia,&quot; throughout the 17th century. While Lope de Vega wrote prose and poetry as well, he is best remembered for his plays, particularly those grounded in Spanish history. Like Cervantes, Lope de Vega served with the Spanish army and was fascinated by the Spanish nobility. In the hundreds of plays he wrote, with settings ranging from Biblical times to legendary Spanish history to classical mythology to his own time, Lope de Vega frequently took a comical approach, just as Cervantes did, taking a conventional moral play and dressing it up in good humor and cynicism. His stated goal was to entertain the public, much as Cervantes&#x27;s was. In bringing morality, comedy, drama, and popular wit together, Lope de Vega is often compared to his English contemporary Shakespeare. Some have argued that as a social critic, Lope de Vega attacked, like Cervantes, many of the ancient institutions of his country – aristocracy, chivalry, and rigid morality, among others. Lope de Vega and Cervantes represented an alternative artistic perspective to the religious asceticism of Francisco Zurbarán. Lope de Vega&#x27;s &quot;cloak-and-sword&quot; plays, which mingled intrigue, romance, and comedy together were carried on by his literary successor, Pedro Calderón de la Barca, in the later seventeenth century.

===Poetry===
This period also produced some of the most important Spanish works of poetry. The introduction and influence of Italian Renaissance verse are apparent perhaps most vividly in the works of Garcilaso de la Vega and illustrate a profound influence on later poets. Mystical literature in Spanish reached its summit with the works of San Juan de la Cruz and Teresa of Ávila. Baroque poetry was dominated by the contrasting styles of Francisco de Quevedo and Luis de Góngora; both had a lasting influence on subsequent writers and even on the Spanish language itself. Lope de Vega was a gifted poet of his own, and there were a vast quantity of remarkable poets at that time, though less known: Francisco de Rioja, Bartolomé Leonardo de Argensola, Lupercio Leonardo de Argensola, Bernardino de Rebolledo, Rodrigo Caro, and Andrés Rey de Artieda. Another poet was Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, from the Spanish colonies overseas in New Spain (modern day Mexico). Many of the greatest poets attended the Medrano Academy in Madrid, including Lope de Vega, Quevedo and Gongora, established by the president, poet and playwright Sebastian Francisco de Medrano.

The picaresque genre flourished in this era, describing the life of &quot;pícaros&quot;, living by their wits in a decadent society. Distinguished examples are &quot;El buscón&quot;, by Francisco de Quevedo, &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; by Mateo Alemán, &quot;Estebanillo González&quot; and the anonymously published &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; (1554), which created the genre.

===Other significant authors===
*Juana Inés de la Cruz was a Mexican writer, philosopher, composer, poet of the Baroque period, and Hieronymite nun. She wrote poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, feminism, and religion. In addition to the two comedies; &quot;Pawns of a House&quot; (Los empeños de una casa) and &quot;Love is but a Labyrinth&quot; (Amor es mas laberinto), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: &quot;The Second Celestina&quot; (La Segunda Celestina).
*Alonso de Ercilla wrote the epic poem &quot;La Araucana&quot; about the Spanish conquest of Chile.
*Gil Vicente was Portuguese, but his influence on Spanish playwriting was so wide that he is often considered part of the Spanish Golden Era.
*Francisco de Avellaneda was a prolific writer of short comedies and dances.

Other well-known playwrights of the period include: 
*Tirso de Molina
*Agustín Moreto
*Juan Pérez de Montalbán
*Juan Ruiz de Alarcón
*Guillén de Castro
*Antonio Mira de Amescua

== Rhetoric ==
As elsewhere in Europe, Spanish scholars participated in the humanist recovery and theorizing of Greek and Roman rhetorics. Early Spanish humanists include Antonio Nebrija and Juan Luis Vives. Spanish rhetoricians who discussed Ciceronianism include Juan Lorenzo Palmireno and Pedro Juan Núñez. Famous Spanish Ramists include Francisco Sánchez de las Brozas, Pedro Juan Núñez, Fadrique Furió Ceriol, and Luis de Verga. Many other rhetoricians turned to Greek rhetorics from Hermogenes and Longinus which were preserved by Byzantine scholars, especially George of Trebizond. These Byzantine-inspired Spanish rhetoricians include Antonio Lull, Pedro Juan Núñez, and Luis de Granada. There were also many translators of progymnasmata, including Francisco de Vergara, Francisco Escobar, Juan de Mal Lara, Juan Pérez, Antonio Lull, Juan Lorenzo Palmireno, and Pedro Juan Núñez. Another important Spanish rhetorician is Cypriano Soarez, whose rhetorical handbook was a key textbook in the Jesuit &quot;Ratio studiorum&quot; which was used in Jesuit education throughout the Spanish empire. Diego de Valadés&#x27;s &quot;Rhetorica christiana&quot; is the first Western rhetoric published by a native of México. Besides Soarez&#x27;s &quot;De arte rhetorica&quot;, the progymnasmata by Pedro Juan Núñez was also published in Mexico City. Examples of Nahua oratory (&quot;huehuetlatolli&quot;) were collected by Andrés de Olmos and Bernardino de Sahagún.

<text>Panicsville is a Chicago noise music group founded in 1992 by Andy Ortmann (founder of Nihilist Records) with David Forquer and Ryan Kohler. It has become an ongoing project for Ortmann to work with other musicians. Early shows consisted of pelting the audience with items like dry ice, meat, blood and insects. Now the group generally plays shrieking, high-pitched noises dressed in strange black latex outfits, and physically attack their audience in a violent but playful fashion. 
At one time, the group consisted of 15 members -- Ben Armstrong and Drew St. Ivany from Laddio Bolocko and The Psychic Paramount among them; however, Jeremy Fisher and Andy Ortmann are the only two permanent members of the group. Recent collaborators include filmmaker Usama Alshaibi, Cock E.S.P., M.V. Carbon from Metalux and Thymme Jones from Cheer Accident.

<doc id="910089" wikidata="Q55733" url="?curid=910089" title="Otylia Jędrzejczak">
<text>Otylia Jędrzejczak (; born 13 December 1983) is a Polish swimmer. She was the Olympic champion from 2004 Athens in the 200 metre butterfly. She finished 4th in this event in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, and also swam at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In Athens 2004 she also silvered in 400 m freestyle and 100 m butterfly. Three times she broke the world record in the women&#x27;s 200 m butterfly (once in the 25-metre pool).

Jędrzejczak was born in Ruda Śląska, Silesian Voivodship, Poland. She started swimming at the age of six as a measure to correct a slight curvature of the spine. At first she hated the sport. Her attitude towards it changed after she had won her first prize in a competition in Germany at the age of eight. Jędrzejczak took up swimming seriously in high school. Led by coach Maria Jakóbik, she won her first titles in the Junior European Championships in 1999. Medals in the Senior European Championships in 1999 and 2000 opened the way to her first Olympic appearance.

Jędrzejczak studied at the Academy of Physical Education in Warsaw. Her coach is Paweł Słomiński. She is 190 cm (6 ft 3 in) tall.

For her sporting achievements, she received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta (5th Class) in 2004.

== Career ==

In 1999 she won the 100 m and 200 m butterfly titles during the Junior European Championships in Moscow and a bronze medal in the 200 m butterfly event in the Senior European Championships in Istanbul.

In 2000, she won gold in the 200 m butterfly and silver in the 100 m butterfly in the European Championships in Helsinki.

In the 2000 Summer Olympics she placed 5th in the 200 m butterfly.

In 2001, she placed second in the 100 m butterfly event in the World Championships in Fukuoka.

On 4 August 2002 she established a new world record in the 200 m butterfly with a time of 2:05.78 during the European Championships in Berlin. Except the 200 m title, she won a silver medal in the 100 m butterfly event.

During the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona she placed first in the 200 m butterfly and second in the 100 m butterfly.

In the 2004 European Championships in Madrid she defended her 200 m butterfly title and placed third in the 100 m butterfly event.

During the 2004 Summer Olympics she won three medals: silver in the 400 m freestyle and 100 m butterfly, and gold in the 200 m butterfly. The latter one was Poland&#x27;s first ever Olympic gold medal in swimming. This equals her in the number of medals earned during single Olympic games with the legendary Polish athlete Irena Szewińska.

After winning bronze in the 100 m butterfly during the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, Jędrzejczak managed to defend her title in the 200 m butterfly event on 29 July 2005. In the final she improved her own world record with a time of 2:05.61 to beat Australian Jessicah Schipper by only 0.04 seconds. After the race it was disputed that Jędrzejczak touched the finishing wall with only one hand (with video replays confirming this), which according to International Swimming Federation rules would be grounds for an automatic disqualification. But since this was not noticed by the judges and no complaints were filed within 30 minutes of the race, her result has been approved.

In the summer of 2005 she won three gold medals at the Summer Universiade in İzmir.

In the 2006 European Championships in Budapest she again defended her 200 m butterfly title and won 200 m freestyle. With her teammates, she took the silver medal in 4×200 m freestyle relay.

On 13 December 2007, on her 24th birthday, Jędrzejczak broke the world record for the 200 metre women&#x27;s butterfly (short course) with a time of 2:03.53.

==Olympic Games gold medal auction==
Jędrzejczak owes her Olympic gold medal success to a brilliant finish in the last quarter of the 200 metre distance, which allowed her to overtake Australian Petria Thomas, who led the race for over 150 metres.

After the race Jędrzejczak revealed, that during the pre-Olympic trials in Athens in June she had declared that if she won a gold medal in the Olympics, she would auction it off and hand the proceeds to a charity helping children suffering from leukemia.

The results of the internet auction were announced on 19 December 2004 with Victoria Cymes, a Polish food company, turning out to be the highest bidder with 257,550 zlotys (about 82,437 USD). The money was handed over to the Oncology and Haematology Clinic of Wrocław&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Hospital.

== Accident and trial ==
On 1 October 2005, she was injured in a car accident, which killed her 19-year-old brother, Szymon. The 2005 Chrysler 300C HEMI which she was driving crashed head-on into a tree, after a botched attempt to overtake several long-haul trucks at excessive speed during bad weather conditions.

She was tried for an accident resulting in passenger&#x27;s death. The prosecutors initially proposed Jędrzejczak an agreement which would lead to a sentence of 2 years imprisonment in suspension. Jędrzejczak refused the agreement and strongly pressed for an acquittal, stating that she was already punished enough by her brother&#x27;s death. Her trial began in February 2007 before the District Court in Płońsk, close to the place of the accident. She was convicted and sentenced to 9 months of probation during which she had to do 30 hours of community service a month. She also lost her driving licence for 1 year. Both the prosecution and Jędrzejczak appealed to the Regional Court in Płock, which upheld the ruling.

During the trial the prosecution highlighted the fact that Jędrzejczak was an inexperienced driver and her driving at the moment of the fatal accident was reckless. The defence suggested discrepancies in the accident witness testimonies and criticized the opinions of experts assessing the causes of the accident.

In relation to whoever was responsible for the accident council Tadeusz Wolfowicz declared that his client (Jędrzejczak) does not feel guilty of causing the accident, while her other attorney Jakub Wende claimed that &quot;The mere fact that an accident took place cannot be regarded as that my client was at fault&quot;.

The accident, the trial and their aftermath started taking their toll. Her attitude during the trial resulted in alienation of many of her fans and decline of her popularity.

==Later career==
In 2006, she returned to competitive swimming and competed in European Championships in Budapest, finishing first in 200 m freestyle and 200 m butterfly as well as sechond in 4×200 m relay. In 2007, she managed to set a new world record in 200m butterfly (short course) in Debrecen, but earlier in the year in Melbourne, in the World Championships, she finished third in her main competition, 200 m butterfly, and in Eindhoven in 2008, she failed to qualify for the final race in both 100 m and 200 m butterfly.

Although both Jędrzejczak and her trainer Paweł Słomiński stated that Eindhoven results were &quot;just an accident&quot;, 2008 Summer Olympics proved otherwise. Jędrzejczak, who won three Olympic medals four years earlier, in Beijing managed only to reach 9th place in 200 m freestyle and a disastrous 17th place in 100 m butterfly. She hoped for a medal in her favourite 200 m butterfly, but she failed, finishing 4th.

After returning from Beijing, Jędrzejczak stated in an interview that she probably would quit the career as a professional swimmer.

However, Jędrzejczak qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics in the 100m and 200m butterfly. She swam a time of 59.31 in her 100m heat, and did not qualify for the semifinals.

<doc id="910091" wikidata="Q5929018" url="?curid=910091" title="Hudson Valley Renegades">
<text>The Hudson Valley Renegades are a Minor League Baseball team based in Fishkill, New York. The High-A affiliate of the New York Yankees, the Renegades play in the South Atlantic League. The Renegades play their home games at Heritage Financial Park. From 1994 to 2020, the team competed in the Class A Short Season New York–Penn League.

==History==
The Renegades were founded in 1994 when the Erie Sailors relocated from Pennsylvania to the Hudson Valley, rebranding as the Hudson Valley Renegades. The team originally retained the Sailors&#x27; existing affiliation with the Texas Rangers organization but became an affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays organization in 1996, even though the major league team would not start playing until 1998. The Renegades became an affiliate club of the New York Yankees in 2021.

=== New York-Penn League ===
The Renegades won three New York–Penn League championships in 1999, 2012, and 2017. The team has had a number of future major leaguers such as Scott Podsednik, Jorge Cantu, Ryan Dempster, Joe Kennedy, Craig Monroe, Matt Diaz, Evan Longoria, Josh Hamilton, John Jaso, Wade Davis, and Toby Hall as players. 

On August 10, 2000, Doug Waechter threw the only no-hitter in Renegades history against the Pittsfield Mets. 

In October 2005, Scott Podsednik became the first former Renegade to win a World Series with the Chicago White Sox defeating a Houston Astros club which included former Renegades Brandon Backe and Dan Wheeler.

=== High-A East/South Atlantic League ===
In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s restructuring of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Renegades were placed into the High-A East. They won the 2021 Northern Division title with a first-place 71–49 record. Despite winning the division, their record was third-best in the league, and only the two teams with the highest winning percentages in the regular season competed for the league championship.

In 2022, the High-A East became known as the South Atlantic League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

=== Ownership ===
The original owner of the team was the Goldklang Group headed by Marvin Goldklang, which also had stakes in several other minor league baseball teams, including the Charleston RiverDogs and St. Paul Saints. In December 2021, it was announced that The Goldklang Group sold the Renegades to Diamond Baseball Holdings, which as of 2023 is owned by Silver Lake, an American global private equity firm.

=== Mascots ===
The team&#x27;s mascots are a family of anthropomorphic raccoons. &quot;Rookie&quot; the Raccoon appeared first and Rene Gade in late 1995. The pair was married &quot;in an on-field ceremony&quot; on July 20, 1997. Occasionally, Rookie&#x27;s father Roofus also appears as part of the mascot team. Their raccoon mascot son Rascal was born in 2000 who married a skunk named Rosie on July 20, 2024. 

In December 2023, the mascots participated in a holiday yule log event. 

Team promotions include a &quot;Fun Team&quot; that promotes between-inning entertainment. Former manager Matt Quatraro coined the nickname &quot;Gades&quot; in 2000.

<doc id="910094" wikidata="Q164622" url="?curid=910094" title="Gail Emms">
<text>Gail Elizabeth Emms MBE (born 23 July 1977) is a retired English badminton player who has achieved international success in doubles tournaments. A badminton player since the age of four, Emms was first chosen to represent England in 1995 and regularly played for her country until her retirement from professional sport in 2008.

Her best results were winning gold at the 2006 World Championships in Madrid, 2004 European Championships in Geneva, and a silver medal at the 2004 Olympic Games, partnering Nathan Robertson in the mixed doubles. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester she won a bronze medal with Joanne Goode in the women&#x27;s doubles and won gold as part of the England team in the mixed team event. In the English National Championships she won the mixed doubles three times and the women&#x27;s doubles twice.

== Early life and career ==
Emms attended the Dame Alice Harpur School in Bedford, a private girls&#x27; school. She and Nathan Robertson reached the semi-finals of 1994 World Junior Championships held in Kuala Lumpur. In 1998 she graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Sports Science from Kingston University. After graduating Emms became a full-time professional badminton player with the help of national lottery funded grants paid to her by UK Sport. Her father owned a building firm that collapsed in the recession of the late 1980s leading to a sudden decline in the family standard of living. Her mother, Janice Emms (née Barton), played for the unofficial England women&#x27;s national football team. Her parents divorced while Emms was in her early teens.

== 2004 Athens Summer Olympics ==
Emms competed in badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics in women&#x27;s doubles with partner Donna Kellogg. They defeated Koon Wai Chee and Li Wing Mui of Hong Kong in the first round but were defeated by Zhao Tingting and Wei Yili of China in the second round.

She also competed in mixed doubles with Robertson. They had a bye in the first round and defeated Björn Siegemund and Nicol Pitro of Germany in the second. In the quarterfinals, Emms and Robertson beat Chen Qiqiu and Zhao Tingting of China 15–8, 17–15 to advance to the semifinals. There, they beat Jonas Rasmussen and Rikke Olsen of Denmark 15–6, 15–12. In the final, they lost to the Chinese pair Zhang Jun and Gao Ling 1–15, 15–12, 12–15 to finish with the silver medal.

== 2006 Commonwealth Games ==
The 2006 Commonwealth Games brought Emms a silver in the team event, a bronze in the women&#x27;s doubles (with Donna Kellogg) and a gold in the mixed doubles (with Nathan Robertson). An additional gold together with Robertson followed at the 2006 IBF World Championships.

== 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics ==
Emms participated in the women&#x27;s doubles with partner Donna Kellogg only to be knocked out in the first round by the Chinese pair Wei Yili and Zhang Yawen. Emms then went on to win her first match in the mixed doubles with Nathan Robertson against the Chinese world number 2 pair. Emms and Robertson won the first game 21–16 before Gao Ling and her new partner Zheng Bo hit back to win the second 21–16. The British duo found themselves 12–17 down in the decider only to recover to win 21–19. Emms and Robertson lost out on a medal at the quarter final stage against the world number 10 pair and eventual gold medalist Lee Yong-dae and Lee Hyo-jung of South Korea.

Emms retired after the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing.

== Later career ==
After 2008 Emms started a portfolio career and has engaged in badminton coaching, motivational speaking, media activities, TV commentary and product endorsements. The latter includes work for SKODA cars and Adidas. Emms has worked as a TV presenter and commentator for the BBC, Sky and BT Sport. She has delivered talks on performance, teamwork and gender issues at events held by many prominent clients including the Ashridge Business School, Sainsbury&#x27;s and the Thames Valley Police.

In 2013 she was appointed to the Badminton England coaching staff with a remit to develop young female prospects and mixed doubles pairs. But loss of financial support for badminton from UK Sport in 2017 resulted in cutbacks to the coaching programmes which impacted on Emms&#x27; position. She has subsequently been critical of UK Sport&#x27;s strategy in allocating funds, suggesting that its emphasis on elite level players and Olympic medal results is inappropriate.

Emms has appeared on the sports-based panel show &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; and is a regular guest on &quot;Fighting Talk&quot;. On 6 March 2014, she appeared on &quot;Sport Relief&#x27;s Top Dog&quot; with her dog Raffa, a Westie. They won their heat, and went on to win the semi-final against Jenni Falconer on 20 March and the final, where they competed against Sally Gunnell.

== Personal life ==
Emms was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours for services to badminton.

She gave birth to her first child, Harry, in March 2010 and to her second child, Oliver, in May 2013. In 2015 she was living in Milton Keynes with her partner. After retiring as a badminton player in 2008 Emms has periodically suffered from depression. She has spoken about the difficulty many professional athletes have in adjusting to life after retiring from their sport while still young.

Emms is a passionate supporter of Tottenham Hotspur. She participated in the 2017 Great North Run half marathon in order to raise money for SportsAid, finishing in a time of 1 hour and 48 minutes.

<doc id="910097" wikidata="Q7573930" url="?curid=910097" title="Megalithic art">
<text>Megalithic art refers to art either painted or carved onto megaliths in prehistoric Europe and found on the structural elements, like the kerbstones, orthostats, or capstones of megalithic tombs, but recent investigations have included decorations on stelae and menhirs.

Megalithic art is found in many places in Western Europe although the main concentrations are in England, Malta, Ireland, Brittany and Iberia. Megalithic art started in the Neolithic and continued into the Bronze Age. Although many monument types received this form of art the majority is carved on Neolithic passage graves. Megalithic art tends to be highly abstract and contains relatively few representations of recognizable real objects. Megalithic art is often similar to prehistoric rock art and contains many similar motifs such as the &#x27;cup and ring mark&#x27;, although the two forms of rock carving also have large stylistic differences. The meaning of megalithic art is the subject of much debate.

Weathering and vandalism have affected many examples of the art, and little of it remains today.
==Ireland==
Ireland has the largest concentration of megalithic art in Europe, particularly in the Boyne Valley. This art form appears to be entirely abstract and is perhaps the most famous with its well-known multiple-spirals. It has been suggested that much of this artwork is entoptically derived from induced states of altered consciousness (Dronfield 1993). Stylistically the art of Ireland is similar to occasional finds in nearby Wales and the Scottish Isles. Approximately 70% of Ireland&#x27;s ancient decorated rocks and stones are to be found in the Boyne Valley (o&#x27;Sullivan 1997;19)

==France==
The French region of Brittany has the second highest concentration of megalithic art. The earliest examples in this area are with anthropomorphic representations on menhirs which later continued in passage graves. Brittany shares some motifs with both Ireland and Iberia and the level of contact between them has always been debated. Among the most famous examples are the passage grave at Gavrinis and the Barnenez mound.

==Iberia==

Iberian megalithic art contains the most number of realistic representations of objects, although there is also a strong abstract element. Iberia is the only place to have painted decoration as well as carved. Other areas may also have originally been painted, but Iberia&#x27;s dry climate lends itself to preservation of the paint. The paint (as it currently survives) is normally restricted to black and red, although occasionally features white as well.

==Germany==
Megalithic art is extremely rare in Central Europe. The gallery grave at Züschen in Germany is an intriguing exception, as it appears to mix motifs known from the west European megalithic tradition with others more familiar from alpine Rock art.

==Non-abstract art==

As well as abstract or geometric art, some carvings are considered to represent tools, weapons, animals, human figures, deities or idols. The gallery graves of the Seine-Oise-Marne culture such as that at Courjeonnet have images of axes, breasts and necklaces carved on their walls. The meaning of some of these is disputed. For instance, some of the tombs in the valley of the Petit Morin in France and elsewhere contain engravings of breasts, noses, hair, and a collar or necklace. These have been described both as deities (occasionally as &#x27;dolmen deities&#x27;) and as representations of the deceased.

<text>The third USS &quot;Proteus&quot; (AS-19) was a in the United States Navy.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Proteus&quot; was laid down by the Moore Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company, Oakland, California, 15 September 1941; launched 12 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Charles M. Cooke, Jr.; and commissioned 31 January 1944.

==Service history==
===1944–1959===
After shakedown off San Diego, she stood out of San Francisco on 19 March for Midway to tend submarines of Submarine Squadron 20. She arrived 3 May, and operated there until 1 December completing 51 voyage repairs and 14 refits for submarines. She returned to Pearl Harbor 4 December, and on 5 February got underway for Guam where she completed 4 voyage repairs and 24 refits by 7 August.

Assigned to occupation duty after the end of the war, &quot;Proteus&quot; rendezvoused with units of the 3rd Fleet and became the flagship of a 26-ship support group which steamed off the coast of Honshū until 26 August. On the 28th she anchored in Sagami Wan to begin supporting Submarine Squadron 20 as it demilitarized surrendered Japanese submarines, human torpedoes, torpedo carrying boats, and suicide boats at Yokosuka and other locations in the Sagami Wan-Tokyo Bay areas. Future actors Tony Curtis – whose birth name was Bernard Schwartz – and Larry Storch were aboard &quot;Proteus&quot; at Tokyo Bay in August–September 1945 – and watched much of the formal surrender activities aboard from &quot;Proteus&quot;″s signal bridge.

Also assigned to repair Japanese submarines, she remained until 1 November, when she headed home.
Transiting the Panama Canal on 6 December, she reached New London 16 December. A trip to the Canal Zone preceded cold weather operations with SubRon 8 at NS Argentia, Newfoundland during November, after which she returned to New London. Decommissioned and placed in service 26 September 1947, she provided vital service to the submarine base at New London until January 1959. On the 15th she entered Charleston Naval Shipyard for conversion to a tender for the Polaris Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, including the addition of a 44-foot section amidships.

===1960–1992===
&quot;Proteus&quot; recommissioned 8 July 1960, and after shakedown at Guantanamo Bay, she accomplished her first SSBN refit 20 January–21 February at New London. She then crossed to Holy Loch, Scotland, arriving 3 March 1961. There for the next two years she completed 38 refits of Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines. She received the Navy Unit Commendation for her accelerated deployment of all SSBNs alongside during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Back at Charleston for overhaul in 1963, on 2 January 1964 she resumed operations at Holy Loch to provide support and refits to the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines of Submarine Squadron 14.

On 24 February &quot;Proteus&quot; arrived at Rota, Spain, to establish the second overseas replenishment site for Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, returning to Holy Loch 12 April. On 29 June she put in at Charleston and on 16 October was en route to Guam. Arriving Apra Harbor 29 November, she established the third overseas replenishment site for the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines. She continued to operate at Apra Harbor and in the Pacific for the next seven years, taking a five-month time off for self-overhaul in 1968 – relieved by .

In 1971, after a brief R&amp;R visit to Pearl Harbor, &quot;Proteus&quot; proceeded to Mare Island for an extensive overhaul, including a significant propulsion upgrade. A boiler accident forced her to stay at Ford Island, Hawaii for two months then a shake-down was accomplished out of Pearl Harbor, and after an R&amp;R port call to Sydney Australia, &quot;Proteus&quot; returned to Apra Harbor for the now routine exchange with &quot;Hunley&quot;.
The exchange was completed by mid-January, 1973, and &quot;Proteus&quot; resumed her duties. In 1974 personnel from the Ship Repair Facility at Naval Base Guam removed the remaining 5-inch gun turret and munitions as unnecessary for her primary mission – leaving only the four 20mm mounts as her main defensive weapons. When Saigon fell in 1975, some 100,000 Vietnamese fled their country and were processed by the U.S. on Guam. In a massive undertaking called Operation New Life, every able-bodied individual who could be spared helped provide facilities to care for the refugees. As part of that effort over 1,000 officers and men from &quot;Proteus&quot; worked with Seabee construction personnel to erect the refugee tent city at Orote Field on Naval Base Guam, leaving only a hand-picked skeleton crew of individuals aboard to see to her safety and security; as well as handle emergencies from the boats that were in. But for that week, &quot;Proteus&quot; was out of business as usual – for which the Secretary of the Navy awarded &quot;Proteus&quot; her second Meritorious Unit Commendation in 1975; and she (along with other participating Navy Units) were awarded the first award of the Navy Humanitarian Service Medal (established by Executive Order January 1977 for actions beginning 1 April 1975).

In 1976 &quot;Proteus&quot; received her third consecutive Engineering &quot;E&quot; and second Humanitarian Medal for Typhoon Pamela disaster relief; and the Battle Efficiency &quot;E&quot; in 1978. That year, &quot;Proteus&quot; was sent to overhaul at Long Beach Naval Shipyard rather than the expected retirement and decommissioning.
In 1980, her overhaul ended, &quot;Proteus&quot; returned to Guam via a port call in Mazatlán, Mexico. Once again, she relieved the USS &quot;Hunley&quot; and resumed duties as the Guam home-ported submarine tender. The ensuing year saw Proteus conduct the last Pacific SSBN refits under the aegis of Submarine Squadron 15. Following, the standing down of Submarine Squadron 15 on 30 September 1981, &quot;Proteus&quot; was placed under the command of Submarine Group 7 with additional duty as Submarine Group 7 Rep Guam. The missile magazine was deactivated, various modifications were made to the ship, and the Marine Detachment departed. On 21 October 1981, the Proteus was awarded the Battle &quot;E&quot; Efficiency. In November 1981, &quot;Proteus&quot; departed Guam on a six-month deployment to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. 22 December 1981, &quot;Proteus&quot; crossed the equator and received Neptunis Rex and Davy Jones aboard for Shellback ceremonies. Although a submarine tender, while at Diego Garcia, &quot;Proteus&quot; worked on any ship needing assistance. In March 1982, still in Diego Garcia, &quot;Proteus&quot; provided repair assistance to who tied up to &quot;Proteus&#x27;s&quot; port side. After leaving Diego Garcia, the &quot;Sheffield&quot; sailed to the Falkland Islands where she sank on 10 May 1982 after an Argentine air attack on 4 May 1982. &quot;Proteus&quot; returned to Guam in May 1982, after port calls in Fremantle, Australia and Subic Bay, RP and with a second crossing of the Equator. In the fall of 1983, &quot;Proteus&quot; once again visited Subic Bay, RP, along with a November stop in Hong Kong prior to returning to Guam on 9 December 1983. Another Indian Ocean deployment to Diego Garcia followed from May to September 1984 with stops in Singapore and both Perth and Darwin, Australia as well as a third crossing of the Equator.

During 1987-1989 Proteus continued Fast Attack and SSBN support while homeported in Guam and deployed to Subic Naval Base, Philippines, Chinhae, S. Korea, and Japan. Proteus during these years enjoyed liberty ports in Hong Kong and Pattaya, Thailand.

&quot;Proteus&quot; was decommissioned again in September 1992 and soon thereafter struck from the Naval Register.

===1994–2007===
1994 &quot;Proteus&quot; was re-commissioned yet again as a Berthing Auxiliary and placed in service at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Washington. At this time &quot;Proteus&quot; took on the new naval designation Miscellaneous Unclassified IX-518.

In September 1999 the ship was placed out of active service and laid up at the National Defense Reserve Fleet at Suisun Bay, California. Late 2007 she was towed to Esco Marine, Brownsville, Texas for scrapping; which was completed in early 2008.

<text>The U25C is a diesel locomotive built by General Electric intended for the United States domestic market. Launched in September 1963, it remained in production until December 1965. It was replaced by the U28C.

==Development==
The origin of the U25C grew out of the need for six axle locomotives to operate on a 12-mile heavy haul railroad to construct Oroville Dam. The General Electric salesman to Oro Dam Constructors offered essentially a U25B riding on six axle trucks. When the salesman got back to GE&#x27;s Erie Plant it was discovered that no six axle U25 was available, nor did GE wish to construct a domestic six axle road switcher until the horsepower threshold reached 3000 horsepower. Rather than lose the four unit sale GE quickly began a design of a six axle U25 that relied heavily on the U25B for engineering. The U25C was longer than the U25B by four feet four inches. The extra length was needed to accommodate the improved Trimount trucks. Completed in September 1963 the U25C was the first six axle unit of the second generation of dieselization. Following quickly on the Oro Dam Constructor&#x27;s order was an order by Atlantic Coast Line for four U25Cs. The ACL also ordered the first four Alco C628s. Both of these ACL orders were delivered in December 1963.

==Phases==
The following are normally identified as U25C phases:

=== Phase I ===
Phase I units were built from September 1963 to May 1964. These units featured a 2900-gallon fuel tank with the air tanks on the ends of the tank. The early U25Cs had louvers on the equipment boxes under the engineer&#x27;s side of the cab. Oro Dam Constructors #8010-8016 and Atlantic Coast Line #3000-3003 were the only examples.

=== Phase II ===
Phase II units were built from May 1964 to November 1964. These units had a 3500-gallon fuel tank. The air tanks were relocated to inside the carbody behind the cab. Louvers were placed in the long hood behind the cab for ventilation of the air tanks. There were 24 Phase II units. They were built for Northern Pacific #2500-2514, Lake Superior &amp; Ishpeming #2500-2501, and Atlantic Coast Line #3004-3010

=== Phase III ===
Built from April 1965 to July 1966. The Phase III units were the most numerous and included the Upgraded U25Cs. A total of 78 U25Cs were built with this carbody. The Phase III U25C carbody overlapped into early Phase I U28C production. A total of 28 Phase I U28Cs used this same carbody. The Phase III had screened panel openings in the carbody behind the cab. Louvers were eliminated from the left side of the carbody, but kept on the engineer&#x27;s side. A rectangular box opening on the roof provided fresh air for ventilation and cooling the air tanks. Pennsylvania and L&amp;N U25Cs also had an extra equipment box and third handrail stanchion on the raised part of the walkway next to the radiator intake. The extra equipment box was for extended range dynamic brake contactors. In later Phase III production screened doors replaced the screen panels behind the engineer&#x27;s side of the cab. The louvers behind the engineer&#x27;s side of the cab were also removed in late production Phase III units.

==Original Owners==

==Uprated U25Cs==
General Electric built ten uprated U25Cs in 1965. Facing the competitive pressure of the second generation horsepower race GE built these units with increased horsepower. The Alco C628 had more horsepower and the Alco C630 was already announced that Summer. General Motors had the EMD SD40 demonstrators working on several railroads. The increase in unit horsepower was happening that year. The uprated units were built for three railroads that were already operating the U25C. The first uprated units were built for the Northern Pacific between May and July 1965. These were NP #2518-2520 and were rated at 2750 horsepower. Three more uprated U25Cs were built as Atlantic Coast Line #3011-3013 in December 1965. The ACL units were rated at 2800 horsepower. The last four uprated U25Cs were rated at 2800 horsepower and were built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in December 1965. These were PRR #6516-6519. Six additional PRR U25Cs were uprated to 2800 horsepower: 6500-6503, 6510-6511. In early 1966 General Electric began offering the 2800 horsepower U28C. A total of 28 look-a-like U28Cs were built between February 1966 and July 1966 as Chicago Burlington and Quincy #562-577 and Northern Pacific #2800-2811.
==Preservation==
The only U25C preserved is Lake Superior and Ishpeming #2501 which is displayed in Marquette, Michigan.

<doc id="910103" wikidata="Q357620" url="?curid=910103" title="Alonso de Ercilla">
<text>Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga (7 August 153329 November 1594) was a Spanish soldier and poet, born in Madrid. While in Chile (1556–63) he fought against the Araucanians (Mapuche), and there he began the epic poem &quot;La Araucana&quot;, considered one of the greatest epics of the Spanish Golden Age. This heroic work in 37 cantos is divided into three parts, published in 1569, 1578, and 1589. It celebrates both the violence of the conquistadors and the courage of the Araucanians.

==Biography==
Ercilla was born into a Basque noble family. His father was Fortuño García de Ercilla, and his mother Doña Leonor de Zúñiga, both from Bermeo (Biscay). In 1548, after his father&#x27;s death, his mother became lady-in-waiting to the Infanta María and made young Alonso a page to the heir-apparent, Prince Philip (afterwards King Philip II). Ercilla received a thorough education from the most learned teachers, and also enjoyed the advantages of extensive travel and life at court where he came in contact with high personages. When he was only fifteen, he accompanied 21-year-old Philip through Italy and Germany; and their travels lasted three years. Later, Ercilla accompanied his mother to Bohemia where he left her and then visited Austria, Hungary, and other countries. Returning to Spain, he soon started out again with Philip. In this capacity Ercilla (sometimes spelled Arcilla) visited Italy, Germany and the Netherlands, and was present in 1554 at the marriage of his master to Queen Mary I of England.

In London, he made the acquaintance of Jerónimo de Alderete (1555), whose stories of his thrilling adventures in the New World so fired Ercilla&#x27;s imagination that he was determined to accompany Alderete to the New World. He obtained leave from Philip, and they set sail for America, 15 October 1555. Soon after their arrival, however, Alderete died (near Panamá, April 1556).

In 1556 Ercilla continued on his way to Peru and accompanied García Hurtado de Mendoza, recently named Governor and Commander-in-chief of Chile, where the Araucanians had revolted. He distinguished himself in the ensuing campaign. Apparently, he remained in Chile seventeen months, between 1557 and 1559. He participated in the battles of Lagunillas, Quiapo and Millarapue, and witnessed the death of Caupolicán, protagonist of &quot;La Araucana&quot;. This is an epic poem of military exaltation in 37 &quot;cantos&quot; or verses, where the narrator relays the most significant facts of the Arauco War against the Araucanos (mapuches) and which he began to write during the campaign.

In March 1558, García Hurtado de Mendoza founded the city of San Mateo de Osorno and while their neighbours were preoccupied with the celebrations in the new city, García left by a secret entrance, disguised by a helmet with closed visor, accompanied by Ercilla and Pedro of Eyrie. They were confronted by Juan de Pineda, an old enemy of Alonso de Ercilla, and there was a fight. García was warned of the situation.

Alonso de Ercilla ran to a church and looked for asylum. The governor imprisoned both duelists and condemned them to be executed on the following day. However, many people considered the sentence unjust and tried to persuade García to reprieve them. The preparations for the execution continued and all hope of saving them was lost. Then two women, one Spanish and another Native American, approached the house of García, entering by the window, and managed to convince the governor to spare the lives of both. Ercilla was imprisoned for three months and soon afterwards was exiled to Peru.

===Later life===
After Ercilla&#x27;s return to Spain in 1562, he made several diplomatic journeys to Austria, where his mother was a maid of honor at the imperial court, and also visited Italy, France, Germany and Bohemia. In 1570, he married Doña María de Bazán, a woman of illustrious family and of intellectual attainments and, after other diplomatic missions, settled permanently in Spain in 1577. In 1571 he was made a knight of the Order of Santiago, and in 1578 he was employed by Philip II on a mission to Zaragoza. He complained of living in poverty but left a modest fortune and was obviously disappointed at not being offered the post of secretary of state. Ercilla&#x27;s later years were saddened by the loss of his only son, and his own death occurred in Madrid in 1594.

== Works ==

Ercilla&#x27;s great work is &quot;La Araucana&quot;, an epic poem of thirty-seven cantos, describing the difficulties encountered by the Spaniards during the insurrection in Arauco, and the heroic deeds of the natives as well as his companions. The epic partakes of the character of history, and the author adheres with such strict fidelity to the truth, that subsequent historians characterize his work as thoroughly trustworthy. In it the difficult art of storytelling is carried to perfection. Places are admirably described, dates are given with accuracy, and the customs of the native faithfully set forth, giving to the narrative animation and colouring.

The poem was published in three parts, of which the first, composed in Chile and first appearing in 1569, is a versified narrative adhering strictly to historic fact; the second, published in 1578, is encumbered with visions and other romantic machinery; and the third, which appeared in 1589-1590, contains, in addition to the subject proper, a variety of episodes mostly irrelevant. Nevertheless, many scholars consider it the most successful Renaissance epic in the Classical mode written in Spanish. The best editions are those published by the Spanish Academy in 1776 and 1828.

==In literature==
In his novel &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; (1867), Jules Verne wrote, &quot;Araucania is populated by the Mapuche, the native Chilean race extolled in verse by the poet Ercilla&quot;.

==Legacy==
There is a municipality in the Araucania Region of Chile named after Ercilla.

The plant genus &quot;Ercilla&quot; is named after him by French botanist A. de Jussieu.

<doc id="910107" wikidata="Q17005805" url="?curid=910107" title="Biological small-angle scattering">
<text>Biological small-angle scattering is a small-angle scattering method for structure analysis of biological materials. Small-angle scattering is used to study the structure of a variety of objects such as solutions of biological macromolecules, nanocomposites, alloys, and synthetic polymers. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) are the two complementary techniques known jointly as small-angle scattering (SAS). SAS is an analogous method to X-ray and neutron diffraction, wide angle X-ray scattering, as well as to static light scattering. In contrast to other X-ray and neutron scattering methods, SAS yields information on the sizes and shapes of both crystalline and non-crystalline particles. When used to study biological materials, which are very often in aqueous solution, the scattering pattern is orientation averaged.

SAS patterns are collected at small angles of a few degrees. SAS is capable of delivering structural information in the resolution range between 1 and 25 nm, and of repeat distances in partially ordered systems of up to 150 nm in size. Ultra small-angle scattering (USAS) can resolve even larger dimensions. The grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS) is a powerful technique for studying of biological molecule layers on surfaces.

In biological applications SAS is used to determine the structure of a particle in terms of average particle size and shape. One can also get information on the surface-to-volume ratio. Typically, the biological macromolecules are dispersed in a liquid. The method is accurate, mostly non-destructive and usually requires only a minimum of sample preparation. However, biological molecules are always susceptible to radiation damage.

In comparison to other structure determination methods, such as solution NMR or X-ray crystallography, SAS allows one to overcome some restraints. For example, solution NMR is limited to protein size, whereas SAS can be used for small molecules as well as for large multi-molecular assemblies. Solid-State NMR is still an indispensable tool for determining atomic level information of macromolecules greater than 40 kDa or non-crystalline samples such as amyloid fibrils. Structure determination by X-ray crystallography may take several weeks or even years, whereas SAS measurements take days. SAS can also be coupled to other analytical techniques like size-exclusion chromatography to study heterogeneous samples. However, with SAS it is not possible to measure the positions of the atoms within the molecule.

== Method ==

Conceptually, small-angle scattering experiments are simple: the sample is exposed to X-rays or neutrons and the scattered radiation is registered by a detector. As the SAS measurements are performed very close to the primary beam (&quot;small angles&quot;), the technique needs a highly collimated or focused X-ray or neutron beam. The biological small-angle X-ray scattering is often performed at synchrotron radiation sources, because biological molecules normally scatter weakly and the measured solutions are dilute. The biological SAXS method profits from the high intensity of X-ray photon beams provided by the synchrotron storage rings. The X-ray or neutron scattering curve (intensity versus scattering angle) is used to create a low-resolution model of a protein, shown here on the right picture. One can further use the X-ray or neutron scattering data and fit separate domains (X-ray or NMR structures) into the &quot;SAXS envelope&quot;.

In a scattering experiment, a solution of macromolecules is exposed to X-rays (with wavelength &quot;λ&quot; typically around 0.15 nm) or thermal neutrons (&quot;λ&quot;≈0.5 nm). The scattered intensity &quot;I(s)&quot; is recorded as a function of momentum transfer &quot;s&quot; (&quot;s=4πsinθ/λ&quot;, where &quot;2θ&quot; is the angle between the incident and scattered radiation). From the intensity of the solution the scattering from only the solvent is subtracted. The random positions and orientations of particles result in an isotropic intensity distribution which, for monodisperse non-interacting particles, is proportional to the scattering from a single particle averaged over all orientations. The net particle scattering is proportional to the squared difference in scattering length density (electron density for X-rays and nuclear/spin density for neutrons) between particle and solvent – the so-called contrast. The contrast can be varied in neutron scattering using H2O/D2O mixtures or selective deuteration to yield additional information. The information content of SAS data is illustrated here in the figure on the right, which shows X-ray scattering patterns from proteins with different folds and molecular masses. At low angles (2-3 nm resolution) the curves are rapidly decaying functions of &quot;s&quot; essentially determined by the particle shape, which clearly differ. At medium resolution (2 to 0.5 nm) the differences are already less pronounced and above 0.5 nm resolution all curves are very similar. SAS thus contains information about the gross structural features – shape, quaternary and tertiary structure – but is not suitable for the analysis of the atomic structure.

==History==
First applications date back to the late 1930s when the main principles of SAXS were developed in the fundamental work of Guinier following his studies of metallic alloys. In the first monograph on SAXS by Guinier and Fournet it was already demonstrated that the method yields not only information on the sizes and shapes of particles but also on the internal structure of disordered and partially ordered systems.

In the 1960s, the method became increasingly important in the study of biological macromolecules in solution as it allowed one to get low-resolution structural information on the overall shape and internal structure in the absence of crystals. A breakthrough in SAXS and SANS experiments came in the 1970s, thanks to the availability of synchrotron radiation and neutron sources, the latter paving the way for contrast variation by solvent exchange of H2O for D2O and specific deuteration methods. It was realised that scattering studies on solution provide, at a minimal investment of time and effort, useful insights into the structure of non-crystalline biochemical systems. Moreover, SAXS/SANS also made possible real time investigations of intermolecular interactions, including assembly and large-scale conformational changes in macromolecular assemblies.

The main difficulty of SAS as a structural method is to extract the three-dimensional structural information of the object from the one-dimensional experimental data. In the past, only overall particle parameters (e.g. volume, radius of gyration) of the macromolecules were directly determined from the experimental data, whereas the analysis in terms of three-dimensional models was limited to simple geometrical bodies (e.g. ellipsoids, cylinders, etc.) or was performed on an ad hoc trial-and-error basis. Electron microscopy was often used as a constraint in building consensus models. In the 1980s, progress in other structural methods led to a decline of the interest of biochemists in SAS studies, which drew structural conclusions from just a couple of overall parameters or were based on trial-and-error models.

The 1990s brought a breakthrough in SAXS/SANS data analysis methods, which opened the way for reliable &quot;ab initio&quot; modelling of macromolecular complexes, including detailed determination of shape and domain structure and application of rigid body refinement techniques. This progress was accompanied by further advances in instrumentation, allowing sub-ms time resolutions to be achieved on third generation SR sources in the studies of protein and nucleic acid folding.

In 2005, a four-year project was started. &quot;S&quot;mall-&quot;A&quot;ngle &quot;X&quot;-Ray scattering &quot;I&quot;nitiative for &quot;E&quot;u&quot;R&quot;ope (SAXIER) with the goal to combine SAXS methods with other analytical techniques and create automated software to rapidly analyse large quantities of data. The project created a unified European SAXS infrastructure, using the most advanced methods available.

== Data analysis ==
In a good quality SAS experiment, several solutions with different concentrations of the macromolecule under investigation are measured. By extrapolating the scattering curves measured at varying concentrations to zero concentration, one is able to get a scattering curve that represents infinite dilution. Then &quot;concentration effects&quot; should not affect the scattering curve. Data analysis of the extrapolated scattering curve begins with the inspection of the start of the scattering curve in the region around &quot;s = 0&quot;. If the region follows the &quot;Guinier approximation&quot; (also known as &quot;Guinier law&quot;), the sample is not aggregated. Then the shape of the particle in question can be determined by various methods, of which some are described in the following reference.

===Indirect Fourier transform===
First step is usually to compute a Fourier transform of the scattering curve. Transformed curve can be interpreted as distance distribution function inside a particle. This transformation gives also a benefit of regularization of input data.

===Low-resolution models===

One problem in SAS data analysis is to get a three-dimensional structure from a one-dimensional scattering pattern. The SAS data does not imply a single solution. Many different proteins, for example, may have the same scattering curve. Reconstruction of 3D structure might result in large number of different models. To avoid this problem a number of simplifications need to be considered.

An additional approach is to combine small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering data and model with the program MONSA.

Freely available SAS analysis computer programs have been intensively developed at EMBL. In the first general &quot;ab initio&quot; approach, an angular envelope function of the particle &quot;r=F(ω)&quot;, where (&quot;r,ω&quot;) are spherical coordinates, is described by a series of spherical harmonics. The low resolution shape is thus defined by a few parameters – the coefficients of this series – which fit the scattering data. The approach was further developed and implemented in the computer program &quot;SASHA&quot; (&quot;Small Angle Scattering Shape Determination&quot;). It was demonstrated that under certain circumstances a unique envelope can be extracted from the scattering data. This method is only applicable to globular particles with relatively simple shapes and without significant internal cavities. To overcome these limitations, there was another approach developed, which uses different types of Monte-Carlo searches. &quot;DALAI_GA&quot; is an elegant program, which takes a sphere with diameter equal to the maximum particle size Dmax, which is determined from the scattering data, and fills it with beads. Each bead belongs either to the particle (index=1) or to the solvent (index=0). The shape is thus described by the binary string of length M. Starting from a random string, a genetic algorithm searches for a model that fits the data. Compactness and connectivity constrains are imposed in the search, implemented in the program &quot;DAMMIN&quot;. If the particle symmetry is known, &quot;SASHA&quot; and &quot;DAMMIN&quot; can utilise it as useful constraints. The &#x27;give-n-take&#x27; procedure &quot;SAXS3D&quot; and the program &quot;SASMODEL&quot;, based on interconnected ellipsoids are &quot;ab initio&quot; Monte Carlo approaches without limitation in the search space.

An approach that uses an &quot;ensemble&quot; of Dummy Residues (DRs) and simulated annealing to build a locally &quot;chain-compatible&quot; DR-model inside a sphere of diameter Dmax lets one extract more details from SAXS data. This method is implemented in the program &quot;GASBOR&quot;.

Solution scattering patterns of multi-domain proteins and macromolecular complexes can also be fitted using models built from high resolution (NMR or X-ray) structures of individual domains or subunits assuming that their tertiary structure is preserved. Depending on the complexity of the object, different approaches are employed for the global search of the optimum configuration of subunits fitting the experimental data.

===Consensus model===
The Monte-Carlo based models contain hundreds or thousand parameters, and caution is required to avoid overinterpretation. A common approach is to align a set of models resulting from independent shape reconstruction runs to obtain an average model retaining the most persistent- and conceivably also most reliable-features (e.g. using the program &quot;SUPCOMB&quot;).

===Adding missing loops===
Disordered surface amino acids (&quot;loops&quot;) are frequently unobserved in NMR and crystallographic studies, and may be left missing in the reported models. Such disordered element contribute to the scattering intensity and their probable locations can be found by fixing the known part of the structure and adding the missing parts to fit the SAS pattern from the entire particle. The Dummy Residue approach was extended and the algorithms for adding missing loops or domains were implemented in the program suite &quot;CREDO&quot;.

===Hybrid methods===
Recently a few methods proposed that use SAXS data as constraints. The authors aimed to improve results of fold recognition and de novo protein structure prediction methods. SAXS data provide the Fourier transform of the histogram of atomic pair distances (pair distribution function) for a given protein. This can serve as a structural constraint on methods used to determine the native conformational fold of the protein. Threading or fold recognition assumes that 3D structure is more conserved than sequence. Thus, very divergent sequences may have similar structure. Ab initio methods, on the other hand, challenge one of the biggest problems in molecular biology, namely, to predict the folding of a protein &quot;from scratch&quot;, using no homologous sequences or structures. Using the &quot;SAXS filter&quot;, the authors were able to purify the set of de novo protein models significantly. This was further proved by structure homology searches. It was also shown, that the combination of SAXS scores with scores, used in threading methods, significantly improves the performance of fold recognition. On one example it was demonstrated how approximate tertiary structure of modular proteins can be assembled from high resolution NMR structures of domains, using SAXS data, confining the translational degrees of freedom. Another example shows how the SAXS data can be combined together with NMR, X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy to reconstruct the quaternary structure of multidomain protein.

===Flexible systems===

An elegant method to tackle the problem of intrinsically disordered or multi-domain proteins with flexible linkers was proposed recently. It allows coexistence of different conformations of a protein, which together contribute to the average experimental scattering pattern. Initially, EOM (ensemble optimization method) generates a pool of models covering the protein configuration space. The scattering curve is then calculated for each model. In the second step, the program selects subsets of protein models. Average experimental scattering is calculated for each subset and fitted to the experimental SAXS data. If the best fit is not found, models are reshuffled between different subsets and new average scattering calculation and fitting to the experimental data is performed. This method has been tested on two proteins– denatured lysozyme and Bruton&#x27;s protein kinase. It gave some interesting and promising results.

==Biological molecule layers and GISAS==
Coatings of biomolecules can be studied with grazing-incidence X-ray and neutron scattering. IsGISAXS (&quot;grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering&quot;) is a software program dedicated to the simulation and analysis of GISAXS from nanostructures. IsGISAXS only encompasses the scattering by nanometric sized particles, which are buried in a matrix subsurface or supported on a substrate or buried in a thin layer on a substrate. The case of holes is also handled. The geometry is restricted to a plane of particles. The scattering cross section is decomposed in terms of interference function and particle form factor. The emphasis is put on the grazing incidence geometry which induces a &quot;beam refraction effect&quot;. The particle form factor is calculated within the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA), starting as an unperturbed state with sharp interfaces or with the actual perpendicular profile of refraction index. Various kinds of simple geometrical shapes are available with a full account of size and shape distributions in the Decoupling Approximation (DA), in the local monodisperse approximation (LMA) and also in the size-spacing correlation approximation (SSCA). Both, disordered systems of particles defined by their particle-particle pair correlation function and bi-dimensional crystal or para-crystal are considered.

<text>The U28C locomotive was developed by General Electric from the U25C, with a slight increase in power of . A passenger-hauling variant, the U28CG, was also produced for the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway.

==Development==
General Electric built ten uprated U25Cs in 1965. Facing the competitive pressure of the second generation horsepower race, GE built these units with increased horsepower. The competitive 2750 horsepower Alco C628 had more horsepower and the 3000 horsepower Alco C630 was announced in July 1965. General Motors had the 3000 horsepower EMD SD40 demonstrators testing on several railroads. The increase in unit horsepower was happening that year. The uprated units were built for three railroads that were already operating the U25C. The first uprated units were built for the Northern Pacific between May and July 1965. These were NP #2518-2520 and were rated at 2750 horsepower. Three more uprated U25Cs were built as Atlantic Coast Line #3011-3013 in December 1965. The ACL units were rated at 2800 horsepower. The last four uprated U25Cs were rated at 2800 horsepower and were built for the Pennsylvania Railroad in December 1965. These were PRR #6516-6519. Six additional PRR U25Cs were uprated to 2800 horsepower: 6500–6503, 6510–6511. In early 1966 General Electric began offering the 2800 horsepower U28C. A total of 28 look-a-like U28Cs were built between February 1966 and July 1966 as Chicago Burlington and Quincy #562-577 and Northern Pacific #2800-2811. These early Phase I U28Cs shared the 64 foot 4 inch frame that was standard with the predecessor U25C.

A drawing of the proposed longer frame U28C is in the November 1965 issue of Trains Magazine. Starting in May 1966 GE began producing the U28C on a longer frame. The new length for these U28Cs was 67 feet 3 inches. These are the 43 Phase II units built for Louisville and Nashville, Pennsylvania, Southern Pacific and Union Pacific. The Phase II units used either the General Electric GT 598 Generator or the GTA 9 Alternator. The 10 Santa Fe U28CGs were also built on this longer frame. Starting in November 1966 and through mid 1967 GE built 24 look a like Phase I U30Cs that used the same carbody as the Phase II U28Cs.

==Original owners==
GE produced 71 U28C locomotives, not including ten U28CG passenger variants for the Santa Fe:


==Preservation==
Ex-Union Pacific 2804 is preserved at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis, Missouri. The rear of the locomotive has been cutaway to show the inner workings of a diesel locomotive.

<text>The GE U30C is a six-axle locomotive built by General Electric from 1966 to 1976. With 600 units sold, the U30C proved to be a viable alternative for customers who were unable to purchase SD40s from Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) due to production backlog. Throughout its ten-year production span, the U30C was known for reliability issues concerning its electrical system. However, most railroads were assured of the reliability of the GE Model 752 DC traction motor and began to place orders for U30Cs starting in 1966. When production ended, the last U30Cs carried pre-Dash 7 specifications, which would be carried in its replacement, the GE C30-7.

The U30C served customers of all kinds, from mining to general freights, coal trains, and even as a power source unit for the Department of Transportation&#x27;s subway-car test tracks in Pueblo, Colorado before a connection from the commercial electric power grid could be established .

Not to be outdone in the freight sector, GE produced a passenger version of the locomotive, the GE U30CG. The U30CG only sold six units for the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway.

When most U30Cs were being retired due to old age and mechanical or electrical problems, General Electric initiated a rebuild program where older Universal Series locomotives would be upgraded with the latest technology and fuel-saving systems. GE would then strip the locomotive down to its frame and engine and completely rebuild the locomotive with new components. When completed, the unit would receive a new designation: GE C30-S7R (R for Rebuilt frame of traded-in locomotive). In the later years, the rebuild frame was discontinued, and a brand-new frame would be used, re-designating the locomotive as GE C30-S7N (N for New frame). The only external difference was a large vent on the fireman&#x27;s side ahead of the engine compartment. The final variation came with the discontinued frame of the Universal series and instead, using GE C40-8 kits. This new model also featured a microprocessor, officially designating this locomotive as GE C30-S7NMP.

A variant of the U20C export locomotive was known as the U30C. This version is unrelated to the U30C built for North America.

<text>The Loomis Chaffee School (; LC or Loomis) is an independent, coeducational, college preparatory school for boarding and day students in grades 9–12, including postgraduate students, located in Windsor, Connecticut, seven miles north of Hartford. As of the 2024-25 school year, 70 percent of Loomis Chaffee&#x27;s 742 students reside on the school&#x27;s 300-acre campus and represent 51 foreign countries and 27 U.S. states; the remaining 30 percent are day students.

Founded in 1914, Loomis Chaffee is a member of the Ten Schools Admission Organization.

== History ==
The school was chartered in 1874 as The Loomis Institute by five Loomis siblings, who were determined to turn tragedy into generosity after all of their own children died before the age of 21. The original 1640 Loomis Homestead was chosen as the site for the school, which opened in 1914. The forty-year gap between chartering and the opening of the school was due to the estate of the Loomis siblings being reserved for the siblings&#x27; retirement.

In 1910, John Mason Loomis&#x27;s widow left over $1.1 million as an endowment to The Loomis Institute for charitable purposes. This donation allowed the school to remain tuition-free for its first four decades. In addition to being tuition-free, The Loomis Institute was distinguished from other New England preparatory schools by its lack of religious affiliation, offering of vocational education alongside college preparatory courses, and admission of both boys and girls.

The Loomis Institute ended coeducation in 1926 when The Chaffee School was incorporated to educate girls on an adjacent campus. In 1970, the boys and girls schools merged to form The Loomis Chaffee School. Since then, the school has expanded as its endowment, financial aid budget, faculty, and campus increased in size. Loomis had an acceptance rate of 17% for the 2023–2024 school year.

==Overview==

=== Academics ===
Loomis Chaffee serves students from grades 9-12, as well as post-graduate students. Loomis offers 250 courses, 70 of which are classified as advanced or college-level. The average class size is 12 students with a 4:1 student-to-faculty ratio. 

===Athletics===
Loomis Chaffee competes in sports against schools from all over New England and adjacent states. The school is a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC) and competes in the Class A large school division. Additionally, Loomis is a member of The Founders League which comprises private schools located mainly in Connecticut.

<text>Michael Andrew Brown (born May 5, 1984) is a Canadian former competitive swimmer. He started swimming at age seven and was a student at the University of Calgary. Brown&#x27;s dream was to become an olympian for Canada and it became true when he qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. He broke the 200-meter breaststroke Canadian record and placed 6th.

His best finish at a world championships was at the 2005 championships in Montreal, when he finished 2nd in the 200-metre breaststroke. Brown won gold at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, Australia, beating his opponent by 0.01 of a second. He was born in Perth, Ontario.

Brown competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 100-metre breaststroke and 200-metre breaststroke. He finished 20th in the 100-metre heats with a time of 1:00.98 and 4th in the 200-metre final with a Canadian Record 2:08.84.

After serving his country for eight years in the national team, Brown announced his retirement in 2009 but it didn&#x27;t seem long lasting and he was seen back in the pools by 2010, fueled and determined for 2012 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="910134" wikidata="Q3087571" url="?curid=910134" title="National Defense Reserve Fleet">
<text>The National Defense Reserve Fleet (NDRF) consists of ships of the United States, mostly merchant vessels, that have been mothballed but can be activated within 20 to 120 days to provide shipping during national military emergencies, or non-military emergencies such as commercial shipping crises.

The NDRF is managed by the U.S. Department of Transportation&#x27;s Maritime Administration (MARAD). It is distinct from the United States Navy reserve fleets, which consist largely of naval vessels.

NDRF vessels are at the fleet sites at James River, Virginia (James River Reserve Fleet); Beaumont, Texas (Beaumont Reserve Fleet); and Suisun Bay, California (Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet); and at designated outported berths. Former anchorage sites included Stony Point, New York (Hudson River Reserve Fleet); Wilmington, North Carolina; Mobile, Alabama; Astoria, Oregon; and Olympia, Washington.

Through the 2010s, the oldest, most decrepit hulls at Suisun Bay were stripped of toxic materials, then broken up in Texas, California, or Asia. Twenty of the most polluting mothball ships were recycled by 2012, and another 32 by 2017.

At its peak, in 1950, the NDRF had 2,277 ships in lay-up. In 2003, it had 274. In July 2007, it held 230 ships, primarily dry-cargo ships, with some tankers, military auxiliaries, and other types. In December 2021, the number of ships was down to 91.

==History==
The NDRF was established under Section 11 of the Merchant Ship Sales Act of 1946 to serve as a reserve of ships for national defense and national emergencies.

NDRF vessels were used in seven wars and crises:
*During the Korean War, 540 vessels were broken out to move military forces.
*During a worldwide tonnage shortfall in 1951–53, more than 600 ships were reactivated to carry coal to Northern Europe and grain to India.
*From 1955 through 1964, another 600 ships were used to store grain for the Department of Agriculture.
*Another 223 cargo ships and 29 tankers were activated during a tonnage shortfall after the Suez Canal was closed in 1956.
*During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, 18 vessels were activated and remained in service until 1970.
*Another 172 vessels were activated for the Vietnam War.

===Ready Reserve Force===
In 1976, a Ready Reserve Force component was established as a subset of the NDRF to provide rapid deployment of military equipment and later became known as the Ready Reserve Force, which numbers 72 vessels. These are crewed with a reduced crew but kept available for activation within four, five, ten or twenty days.

An additional 28 ships are held under United States Maritime Administration (MARAD) custody for other Government agencies on a cost-reimbursable basis.

==Operations==
Vessels with military utility or logistic value are held in retention status and are in a preservation program that is designed to keep them in the same condition as when they enter the fleet. The internal spaces are dehumidified to slow the corrosion of metal and the growth of mold and mildew. DC power is distributed through anodes to the exterior underwater portions of the hull, creating an electric field that suppresses corrosion and preserves the surface of the hull. External painting and other cosmetic work are generally deferred since they do not affect the ability to activate and operate the vessel.

MARAD is authorized as the government&#x27;s disposal agent through the NDRF program for merchant type vessels equal to or greater than 1,500 gross tons. A state agency can file an application to request title to a vessel &quot;as-is where-is&quot; from the NDRF for the purpose of creating an artificial reef. A total of 51 vessels have been transferred to 10 states under the program including: Texas (12), Florida (10), North Carolina (7), Virginia (6), Alabama (5), Mississippi (5), Georgia (2), South Carolina (2), California (1), and New Jersey (1). Of the 132 non-retention vessels in the NDRF, there are 117 that are being prepared for disposal.

The NDRF program can give and lend historic artifacts to maritime-heritage organizations and transfer entire ships to memorial associations through special legislation.

Reserve Fleet Inactive naval ships of merchant design, including amphibious ships but not ships maintained in a mobilization status by MARAD for Military Sealift Command (MSC), may be laid up in the NDRF when overcrowded berthing conditions exist at a Navy Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility. Battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers which have been stricken or those awaiting final disposition may be transferred to MARAD locations for berthing. Initially, these ships will be transferred to MARAD for caretaking in accordance with the Economy Act of 1932.

Ships transferred to the NDRF may be retained in Navy Mobilization Plans and maintained by MARAD under priorities set by the Department of the Navy. If the Navy decides it no longer needs the ship, the Secretary of the Navy strikes the ship from the Naval Vessel Register and transfers the title to MARAD. When possible, MARAD gets first disposition rights, which allows it to convert merchant ships to the Ready Reserve Force (RRF) or to sell the ship for scrapping in connection with the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, Sec. 508, and use the proceeds to buy more supply ships.

==Fleet reduction==

The Suisun Bay location contained 324 ships in 1959. Forty years later, the number was down by about 250, but pollutants had begun to accumulate in the area. Paint containing toxins such as lead, copper, zinc and barium had been flaking off many of the ships&#x27; hulls and superstructures. By June 2007, some 21 tons of toxic paint debris was estimated to have been shed from the ships, to settle in the bay sediment. A further 65 tons of paint was estimated to be in danger of flaking off.

David Matsuda, acting administrator of MARAD, said in March 2010 &quot;We are moving expeditiously to remove the worst-polluting ships first and diligently moving to clean the rest.&quot; Some 52 ships were identified as problematic, and were scheduled for removal and recycling by September 2017. The process began in October 2009; as of October 2012, 36 ships had been removed and the disposal effort was ahead of schedule. One such vessel, the SS &quot;Winthrop&quot;, the last Victory ship of the California mothball fleet, was towed in March 2010 to BAE Systems San Francisco Ship Repair dock to be cleaned of barnacles and plant matter before its final journey to ship breakers in Brownsville, Texas. The hull cleaning was prescribed by the U.S. Coast Guard to prevent the spread of California species to other locations. Some of the recycling work may be completed in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically at the former Mare Island Naval Shipyard—an application for such work is under permit review. Some $38 million in federal funds will be used to complete the dismantling project.

<doc id="910135" wikidata="Q567820" url="?curid=910135" title="Alexander disease">
<text>Alexander disease is a very rare autosomal dominant leukodystrophy, which are neurological conditions caused by anomalies in the myelin which protects nerve fibers in the brain. The most common type is the infantile form that usually begins during the first two years of life. Symptoms include mental and physical developmental delays, followed by the loss of developmental milestones, an abnormal increase in head size and seizures. The juvenile form of Alexander disease has an onset between the ages of 2 and 13 years. These children may have excessive vomiting, difficulty swallowing and speaking, poor coordination, and loss of motor control. Adult-onset forms of Alexander disease are less common. The symptoms sometimes mimic those of Parkinson&#x27;s disease or multiple sclerosis, or may present primarily as a psychiatric disorder.

According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the destruction of white matter is accompanied by the formation of Rosenthal fibers—abnormal clumps of protein that accumulate in astrocytes in the brain.

The disease occurs in both males and females, and no ethnic, racial, geographic or cultural/economic differences are seen in its distribution. Alexander disease is a progressive and often fatal disease.

== Presentation ==
Delays in development of some physical, psychological and behavioral skills; progressive enlargement of the head (macrocephaly), seizures, spasticity, and in some cases also hydrocephalus, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, and dementia.

In cases of early-onset or neonatal Alexander disease, symptoms include seizures, fluid buildup in the brain, high protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid, and severe motor and intellectual impairment. In cases of type I Alexander disease, where the condition appears before age 4, symptoms include seizures, enlarged brain and head, stiffness in the limbs, delayed intellectual and physical development, recurrent vomiting, and difficulties with gaining weight. In cases of type II Alexander disease, where the condition appears after the age of 4, symptoms include speech problems, difficulty swallowing, poor coordination, scoliosis, recurrent vomiting, and difficulties with gaining weight.

==Cause==
Alexander disease is a genetic disorder affecting the midbrain and cerebellum of the central nervous system. It is caused by mutations in the gene for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) that maps to chromosome 17q21. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, such that the child of a parent with the disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition, if the parent is heterozygotic. However, most cases arise &quot;de novo&quot; as the result of sporadic mutations.

Alexander disease belongs to leukodystrophies, a group of diseases that affect the growth or development of the myelin sheath. The destruction of white matter in the brain is accompanied by the formation of fibrous, eosinophilic deposits known as Rosenthal fibers. Rosenthal fibers appear not to be present in healthy people, but occur in specific diseases, like some forms of cancer, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and ALS. The Rosenthal fibers found in Alexander disease do not share the distribution or concentration of other diseases and disorders.

== Pathology ==
Alexander disease causes the gradual loss of bodily functions and the ability to talk. It also causes an overload of long-chain fatty acids in the brain, which destroy the myelin sheath. The cause of Alexander disease is a mutation in the gene encoding GFAP.

A CT scan shows:
* Decreased density of white matter
* Frontal lobe predominance
* Dilated lateral ventricles may present

== Diagnosis ==
Detecting the signs of Alexander disease is possible with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which looks for specific changes in the brain that may be tell-tale signs for the disease. It is even possible to detect adult-onset Alexander disease with MRI. Alexander disease may also be revealed by genetic testing for its known cause. A rough diagnosis may also be made through revealing of clinical symptoms, including enlarged head size, along with radiological studies, and negative tests for other leukodystrophies.

==Treatment==
No cure or standard procedure for treatment is known, although a University of Wisconsin study shows promise with gene editing of the astrocytes. A phase III clinical trial of an antisense therapy, sponsored by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, began in 2021. A bone marrow transplant has been attempted on a child, but it made no improvement. Hydrocephalus may be seen in younger patients and can be relieved with surgery or by implanting a shunt to relieve pressure.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis is generally poor. With early onset, death usually occurs within 10 years from the onset of symptoms. Individuals with the infantile form usually die before the age of seven. Usually, the later the disease occurs, the slower its course.

==Prevalence==
Its occurrence is very rare. The infantile form occurs from birth to two years of age. The average duration of the infantile form is usually about three years. Onset of the juvenile form presents between 2 and 12 years of age. Duration of this form is in most cases about six years. The adult form occurs after 12 years. In younger patients, seizures, megalencephaly, developmental delay, and spasticity are usually present. Neonatal onset is also reported. Onset in adults is least frequent. In older patients, bulbar or pseudobulbar symptoms and spasticity predominate. Symptoms of the adult form may also resemble multiple sclerosis. No more than 500 cases have been reported.

<doc id="910147" wikidata="Q13948235" url="?curid=910147" title="Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery">
<text>A Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (; MBBS, also abbreviated as BM BS, MB ChB, MB BCh, or MB BChir) is a medical degree granted by medical schools or universities in countries that adhere to the United Kingdom&#x27;s higher education tradition. Despite the historical distinction in nomenclature, these degrees are typically combined and conferred together. This degree is usually awarded as an undergraduate degree, but it can also be awarded at graduate-level medical institutions. The typical duration for completion is five to six years.

A Bachelor of Medicine (BMed or MB) is an undergraduate medical degree awarded by medical schools in countries following the tradition of China. The completion period for this degree is generally five to six years. The term &#x27;Medicine&#x27; in this context encompasses the broader field of medical science and practice, rather than specifically internal medicine. Consequently, graduates with a BMed degree are qualified to practise surgery. The BMed degree serves as the primary medical qualification, and individuals holding it may pursue further professional education, such as a Master of Medical Science or a Doctor of Medical Science (equivalent to a PhD).

Both degrees are considered equivalent to the Doctor of Medicine degree typically conferred by universities in North America. In the United States only, some doctors opt to train in osteopathic medicine, and thus receive a Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine degree. For practical purposes, all three degrees (MBBS/MD/DO) are considered to be equal.

== History and nature ==
The degree is currently awarded in institutions in the United Kingdom and countries formerly part of the British Empire.

Historically, Bachelor of Medicine was also the primary medical degree conferred by institutions in the United States and Canada, such as the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, the University of Toronto, the University of Maryland, and Columbia University. Several early North American medical schools were (for the most part) founded by physicians and surgeons who had trained in England and Scotland. University medical education in England culminated with the Bachelor of Medicine qualification and in Scotland the Doctor of Medicine. In the mid-19th century, the public bodies that regulated medical practice required practitioners in Scotland and England to hold the dual Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees. Over the course of the 19th century, North American medical schools switched to the tradition of the ancient universities of Scotland and began conferring Doctor of Medicine rather than Bachelor of Medicine.

In the countries that award bachelor&#x27;s degrees in medicine, however, Doctor of Medicine denotes a holder of a junior doctorate and is reserved for medical practitioners who undertake research and submit a thesis in the field of medicine. Nevertheless, those holding Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually referred to by the courtesy title of &quot;Doctor&quot; and use the prefix &quot;Dr.&quot;, whether or not they also hold a Ph.D. or DSc.

In many countries, the degrees are awarded after an undergraduate course lasting five or six years. For example, most Chinese universities offering medical degrees provide undergraduate courses lasting six years. In some cases, a graduate in another discipline may subsequently enter a special graduate-entry medical course, reduced in duration to account for relevant material covered or learning skills acquired during the first degree. In some cases the old first-year courses (for six-year degrees) in the basic sciences of physics, chemistry, and biology have been abolished: that standard has to be reached by school examinations before entry. However, in most countries, a newly graduated Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery must spend a specified period in internship before he or she can obtain full registration as a licensed medical practitioner.

== Naming ==
The names and abbreviations given to these degrees depend on the institution, awarding body or country, and vary widely. This is mostly for reasons of tradition rather than to indicate any difference between the relative levels of the degrees. They are considered equivalent.

If the awarding body titles the degrees in Latin, the degrees are commonly named &quot;Medicinae Baccalaureus, Chirurgiae Baccalaureus&quot;; &quot;Medicinae Baccalaureus et Chirurgiae Baccalaureus&quot;; or &quot;Baccalaureus in Medicina et in Chirurgia&quot;; abbreviated as MB ChB, MB BCh or otherwise. If titled in English, they are named &quot;Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery&quot;; &quot;Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery&quot;; or &quot;Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery&quot;; usually abbreviated as MB BS, and sometimes as BM BS, even though most MB BS-awarding institutions do not use Latin to name their degrees.

Below are described the specific names used, arranged by country.

=== Australia ===
Historically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorised as Level 7 Bachelor&#x27;s degrees together with other undergraduate programs.

The latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master&#x27;s (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term &#x27;Doctor&#x27; in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, most undregraduate Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with a combined degree that ends with the MD (e.g. the Bachelor of Medical Studies / Doctor of Medicine at The University of New South Wales or the Bachelor of Medical Science and Doctor of Medicine at Monash University) or switched to graduate only MD pathways, to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. Even still, Curtin University and James Cook University both still offer the MBBS degree. With the introduction of the Master&#x27;s level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).

=== Bahrain ===
The Medical University of Bahrain or RCSI-Bahrain is a constituent university of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) and awards its graduates the MB, BCh, BAO (Hons), the same degree awarded to graduates at RCSI.

=== Bangladesh ===
All medical schools in Bangladesh award &quot;MBBS&quot;.

=== Barbados ===
The Bridgetown International University, Victoria University of Barbados, American University of Barbados School of Medicine, and University of the West Indies Faculty of Medicine all award the MBBS.

=== China ===
In China, medical undergraduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine (MB, also BMed, and BM) in Clinical Medicine for a course of study lasting five years for native Chinese students and six years for international/foreign students, including internship. International students may take the program in English or Chinese. Some medical schools also award MBBS degrees, but only for international students. In total, 247 universities are authorized to award medical degrees. All 247 universities are recognized by most of the medical councils around the world and by ECFMG. By August 2022, 136 universities have passed the process of Accreditation of Medical Education from the Ministry of Education of China. The universities awarding MB and MBBS degrees are at the list of medical schools in China.

=== Egypt ===
All Egyptian medical schools, public and private, award an &quot;MB BCh&quot; as the basic medical degree after completion of five academic and clinical study years followed by two years of obligatory clinical rotations (the MB BCh is issued only after the completion of the clinical rotations) with total of seven years both academic, clinical study and clinical rotations.

=== France ===
French students get permitted access to medical studies when succeeding the competitive examination occurring at the end of their first year of studies. They spend their second and third year at their medical school where they learn physiology, semiology and the basics of medical examination. From their fourth year, they begin their rotations in teaching hospitals where they assist junior and senior physicians and learn their art. At the end of their sixth year, they undertake a competitive examination to match with their medical specialty and city of practice. Students are then full-time physicians practising under supervision and will be called &quot;doctors&quot; only when graduating at the end of their residency.

After 9 years (or 3 cycles including successfully defending a Practical (or Exercise) thesis (Le Doctorat en Medecine) on an area of interest), they are awarded : Diplôme d&#x27;État de docteur en médecine (State diploma of Doctor of Medicine) and Diplôme d&#x27;études spécialisées (DES) which are both needed for full registration on the National Council of the Order of Physicians (l&#x27;Ordre des médecins) and can practise medicine

=== Ghana ===
All Ghanaian medical schools award an MBChB as the basic medical degree after 6 academic years. These seven medical schools are Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology, University of Ghana, University for Development Studies, University of Cape Coast, University of Health and Allied Sciences and the private Accra College of Medicine, and Family Health Medical School, another private medical school.

=== Guyana ===
The University of Guyana awards &quot;MB BS&quot;. Other &quot;offshore&quot; United-States-linked schools in the country award the North American MD, such as Texila American University, Lincoln American University.

=== Hong Kong ===
The awarding of qualifications in Hong Kong follows the British tradition.

The dual degree is awarded as:

* &quot;MBBS&quot; at the University of Hong Kong
* &quot;MBChB&quot; at the Chinese University of Hong Kong

=== India ===
In India the MBBS is generally a -year course including one year of mandatory internship and an additional year of mandatory rural posting. Some institutes like the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences and other Deemed Medical Colleges do not have the 1 year of mandatory rural posting. During internship, medical students are paid a stipend. Registration as MBBS doctor is granted after completion of these postings. MBBS in India comes under purview of the National Medical Commission which has the power to recognize or de-recognize medical colleges which provide MBBS education.

Over the last decade, a number of medical colleges have been opened in India, to cater to the huge Indian population. The National Medical Commission mentions 704 medical colleges, which teach MBBS in the country, as in July 2023. There are both government run as well as private medical colleges in India. Admission to MBBS program in government colleges can be highly competitive because of subsidized education and extensive hands-on experience. Every year, millions of students appear for the national competitive examination National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (Undergraduate) for a total of 107,798 MBBS seats in the country, as of July 2023.

The MBBS course starts with the basic pre and para-clinical subjects such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology, forensic medicine including toxicology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for five years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are the best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management, and thorough counselling skills. After 1 year of rotatory internship, additional years of rural internship is mandatory in many states, which can be skipped by paying a huge fine to the government, for obtaining permanent registration as a medical practitioner.

MBBS curriculum in India is going through changes with incorporation of modern teaching methods and introduction of National Exit Test (NExT) as the exit test for obtaining MBBS degree, notified on 30 June 2023.

=== Indonesia ===
In Indonesia, graduating students are awarded the academic degree of &quot;Sarjana Kedokteran&quot; / Bachelor of Medicine (written as suffix &quot;S.Ked&quot;&quot;&quot;) after completing their pre-clinical studies. At this point, the graduate is not yet a practising doctor, but may choose to work directly as a medical scientist or other non-clinician professions (usually health-related). However, most graduates will pursue the conventional path, which is to enroll in the clinical clerkship program (&quot;Program Pendidikan Profesi Dokter&quot;) for another 1.5 to 2 years. During this program, students are required to rotate through different medical/surgical specialties in a teaching hospital, actively involved in diagnoses and treatment of patients under the direct supervision of residents and consultants/attending physicians. After completing a clinical clerkship, students take the national medical licensing examination (&quot;Ujian Kompetensi Mahasiswa Program Profesi Dokter/UKMPPD&quot;) and will be awarded the title &quot;Dokter&quot; (written as prefix &quot;dr.&quot;) as their first professional title if they pass the examination.

=== Iraq ===
All medical schools in Iraq award &quot;MB ChB&quot;, with the exception of the University of Kurdistan-Hewlêr which awards the MBBS degree.

=== Ireland ===

The medical schools in both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland – Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, Trinity College Dublin, some constituent institutions of the National University of Ireland (University College Dublin, University College Cork and University of Galway), and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland — award the degrees of &quot;MB BCh BAO&quot;. The letters &quot;BAO&quot; stand for &quot;Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia&quot; (Bachelor of Obstetrics), a degree unique to Ireland which the Irish universities added in the 19th century as the legislation at the time insisted on a final examination in obstetrics. This third degree is an anachronism which is not registerable with the Irish Medical Council nor the British General Medical Council (GMC). The only exception is the newly established University of Limerick graduate entry school of medicine which awards &quot;BM BS&quot; for Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery.

At Trinity College Dublin, the preclinical course leads to an additional Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree (upgradable after three or four years to Master of Arts); as originally after this most students used to go elsewhere to complete clinical training.

&quot;LRCPI LRCSI&quot;, or simply &quot;LRCP&amp;SI&quot;, denotes a holder of the historical non-university qualifying licentiates awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland to students of the RCSI&#x27;s medical school under the &quot;Irish Conjoint Scheme&quot;. Unlike the corresponding licentiates awarded by the Royal Colleges in Scotland and England (which were external qualifications), these qualifications are still registerable with the Irish Medical Council, but not with the British GMC. Students at RCSI still receive these licences but now also receive the degrees &quot;MB BCh BAO&quot;, due to RCSI&#x27;s status as a recognised college of the National University of Ireland. The RCSI students received a Licence in Midwifery (LM) from each college, in the same way that the Irish universities granted BAO degrees, so their qualifications were sometimes expressed as &quot;L &amp; LM, RCPI, L &amp; LM, RCSI&quot; or more misleadingly as &quot;LLM&quot;, &quot;LRCPI LRCSI&quot;, or simply &quot;LRCP&amp;SI&quot;.

&quot;LAH&quot; formerly denoted a licentiate of the Apothecaries&#x27; Hall of Ireland, and is no longer awarded.

=== Nigeria ===
The &quot;MBBS/MB ChB&quot; is awarded by many public and private universities in Nigeria, after a period of 6 academic years.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, a medical school is more often referred to as a medical college. The full-form of MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery. It is a 5-year course plus one-year internship in affiliated hospital that can be completed from a college recognized by the Pakistan Medical and Dental Council, to receive a degree titled MBBS (Medical colleges in Pakistan). Medical colleges may also teach Post Graduate courses such as FCPS and diplomas. A medical college is affiliated with a university as a department which usually has a separate campus. Currently, a total of 127 medical colleges are listed in World Directory of Medical Schools in Pakistan.

All medical colleges and universities are regulated by the respective provincial department of health. They, however, have to be recognised after meeting criteria set by a central regulatory authority called Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC). Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both the academic performance at the HSSC (grades 11–12) and a centralized entrance test like NMDCAT, are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges.

To get admission into any government medical college, the weightage is determined by the provincial or federal government. In order to get admission into any private medical college, the following weightage is used:

* 50% to Marks of entrance test like Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT).
* 40% to Marks of Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSSC) Pre-Medical.
* 10% to Marks of Secondary School Certificate (SSC) Pre-Medical.

=== Syria ===
The higher education in Syria provides training to a Diploma, Bachelor, Master, and Doctorate levels (see European Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency on Higher Education: Syria).

=== Tunisia ===
Medical education in Tunisia is solely administered by the government Ministry of Higher Education and Ministry of Public Health. Students get permitted access to medical studies when succeeding their national baccalauréat exam and obtaining a competitive score that allows them admission to medical schools (usually in the 95% percentile).
The curriculum spans six years, two years of fundamental medicine, followed by three years of clinical medicine, culminating in a final year of internship. Upon the completion of this comprehensive training, students are awarded a certificate equivalent to a bachelor&#x27;s degree, known as the &quot;Diplome de Fin des Etudes Cliniques en Médecine.&quot; Subsequently, a national exam is undertaken, and students are ranked based on their performance. Specialization in medicine then follows, ranging from an additional three years for family medicine to five years for most medical and surgical specialties.

During the initial two years at medical school, students focus on foundational subjects such as physiology, semiology, and the fundamentals of medical examination. From the fourth year onwards, they engage in rotations at teaching hospitals, where they actively participate under the guidance of junior and senior physicians, honing their practical skills. At the conclusion of the fifth year, students undergo a competitive examination to determine their medical specialty and city of practice. Following this, they transition to full-time physicians, practising under supervision, and earn the title of &quot;doctors&quot; upon successful completion of their residency.

=== Uganda ===
The nine universities in Uganda that have medical schools that teach undergraduate courses, namely; Makerere University, Mbarara University, Gulu University, Kampala International University, Busitema University, Kabale University, Habib Medical School, St. Augustine International University, and Uganda Christian University all award the &quot;MBChB&quot; degree, after five years of study.

=== Ukraine ===
In Ukraine, the full-form of MBBS is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. It is generally a 5.8 year course including one year compulsory internship, that can be completed from a college accredited by the National Medical Commission. At present, Ukraine is ranked at the fourth position in Europe for having the largest number of post graduates in fields of medicine. Ukraine has a number of Top Government Medical Universities offering MBBS, MD and other degrees in medicine to the local students as well as international students.

The MBBS course starts with the basic pre and para-clinical subjects such as biochemistry, physiology, anatomy, microbiology, pathology, forensic medicine including toxicology and pharmacology. The students simultaneously obtain hands-on training in the wards and out-patient departments, where they interact with real patients for six years. The curriculum aims to inculcate standard protocols of history taking, examination, differential diagnosis and complete patient Management. The student is taught to determine what investigations will be useful for a patient and what are the best treatment options. The curriculum also contains a thorough practical knowledge and practice of performing standard clinical procedures. The course also contains a 12-month-long internship, in which an intern is rotated across various specialties. Besides standard clinical care, one also gets a thorough experience of ward management, staff management, and thorough counselling skills.
The degree awarded is &quot;Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery&quot;. The minimum requirements for the MBBS course are 50% marks in physics, chemistry, biology and English in a student&#x27;s secondary school examinations and student need to pass National Eligibility cum Entrance Test examination for the admission in Ukraine Universities.

=== United Kingdom ===
==== England, Wales, and Northern Ireland ====
While first degrees in medicine meet the expectations of the descriptor for higher education qualification at &quot;level 7 (the UK master&#x27;s degree)&quot;, these degrees usually retain, for historical reasons, &quot;Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery&quot; and are abbreviated to MBChB or MBBS.

Varied abbreviations are used for these degrees in these areas:

*&quot;MB ChB&quot; is used at the universities of Aston, Anglia Ruskin, Birmingham, Bristol, Buckingham, Lancaster, Leeds, Leicester, Liverpool, Keele, Manchester, Sheffield, Sunderland (in partnership with Keele) and Warwick.
*&quot;MB BCh&quot; is used by the Welsh universities, Cardiff University and Swansea University.
*&quot;MB, BCh, BAO&quot; is used at the Queen&#x27;s University, Belfast
*&quot;MB BS&quot; is used at all medical schools currently or previously part of the University of London (aka The United Hospitals) (Imperial College School of Medicine, UCL Medical School, King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine, Barts and The London School of Medicine and St George&#x27;s, University of London). Other medical schools that also award an &quot;MB BS&quot; are Norwich Medical School, Hull York Medical School, Newcastle University, University of Central Lancashire and Ulster University (which is currently partnered with St George&#x27;s)
*&quot;BM BCh&quot; is awarded by the University of Oxford.
*&quot;BM BS&quot; is used at the University of Nottingham, University of Exeter, University of Plymouth, University of Southampton, University of Surrey, Kent and Medway Medical School and Brighton and Sussex Medical School (formerly at Peninsula College of Medicine and Dentistry)
*&quot;BM&quot; was previously awarded at the University of Southampton. However, beginning in 2013 students have been awarded BMBS. Although no degree in surgery was formally awarded by Southampton, this degree was equivalent to the MB ChB; students may go on to a career in surgery the same as any other graduates in medicine and surgery.
*&quot;MB BChir&quot; is awarded by the University of Cambridge.

At the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, the preclinical course leads to an additional Bachelor of Arts (&quot;BA&quot;), degree (upgradable after three or four years to Master of Arts), after which most students used to go elsewhere (but usually to one of the London teaching hospitals) to complete clinical training. They could then take the degrees of their new university: They used to have the options of returning to their old university to take the clinical examinations or taking one of the old non-university qualifying examinations. All students at Oxford and Cambridge now remain in place to take their clinical training.

==== Scotland ====
All medical schools in Scotland (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) award MB ChB.

The University of St Andrews School of Medicine awarded &quot;MB ChB&quot; until the early 1970s, but since the incorporation of its clinical medical school into the University of Dundee, St Andrews now only awards a pre-clinical &quot;BSc&quot; or &quot;BSc (Hons)&quot;, and students go to a Partner Medical School (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, or Manchester), where they are awarded an &quot;MB ChB&quot; after a further three years&#x27; study. There is also a programme for Canadian Citizens and residents whereby they complete 3 years at St. Andrews, then 3 years at Edinburgh and are assisted with applying for residency back in Canada.

Since 2018, a joint initiative coordinated by both the Universities of St Andrews and Dundee, the Scottish Graduate Entry Medicine (ScotGEM) programme, has based its first and second year students at St Andrews, and its third and fourth year students at Dundee. This is Scotland&#x27;s first graduate entry medical degree programme. The intention is that the students of the inaugural cohort, due to graduate in July 2022, will be conferred a joint &quot;MB ChB&quot; by both universities – the first to graduate with this professional degree directly from St Andrews in over fifty years.

The Scottish Triple Qualification of &quot;LRCPE, LRCSE, LRCPSG&quot; (earlier LRCPE, LRCSE, LRFPSG) is an old non-university qualifying examination in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh, Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh and Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow, previously through a Conjoint Board and from 1994 through the United Examining Board. The UEB was dissolved in 2007. These qualifications are still registrable with the GMC, but permission to award them was withdrawn by the Privy Council of the UK in 1999.

==== Historical Primary Medical Qualifications ====
The Conjoint diplomas &quot;LRCP MRCS LMSSA&quot; were non-university qualifying examinations in medicine and surgery awarded jointly by the Royal College of Physicians of London, Royal College of Surgeons of England and Society of Apothecaries through the United Examining Board from 1994 until 1999, when the General Medical Council withdrew permission. Before 1994, the English Conjoint diploma of &quot;LRCP, MRCS&quot; was awarded for 110 years, and the &quot;LMSSA&quot; was a distinct and sometimes less-esteemed qualification. These diplomas slowly became less popular among British medical students, but as recently as 1938 only a half of them qualified with university degrees. The diplomas came to be taken mostly by those who had already qualified in medicine overseas or who failed their medical school finals.

=== United States ===

International medical graduates with an MBBS from foreign countries are generally exempt from having to attend medical school in the United States, but must still undergo US residency and pass the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), which is given in three exams. The MBBS is not offered at medical schools in the United States as the majority of medical school programs are graduate entry and by tradition offer the MD degree as a primary medical qualification.

There are a number of institutions in the United States that offer a combined 6-year BS-MD joint degree, notably Northeast Ohio Medical University whereby graduating high school seniors complete an accelerated bachelor&#x27;s degree in two years followed by an MD at the traditional four-year pace. Although the BS-MD pathway is a hybrid undergraduate/graduate program, the result is a primary medical qualification equivalent to an MBBS degree and graduates of these schools go on to enter their intern year at roughly the same age as their UK counterparts. Most American schools offering a BS-MD program do so in 7 years, such as the Indiana University School of Medicine, or in 8 years, such as the Baylor College of Medicine. The Association of American Medical Colleges maintains a list of such schools.
Primarily US-educated MDs and Doctors of Osteopathic Medicine (DOs) go through four years of undergraduate education and apply to professional medical graduate schools with a competitive Medical College Admission Test score and GPA. They then go through two more years of didactic medical science study, and take the pass-fail USMLE Step 1 exam. DO students take a similar exam known as COMLEX Level 1. Following a pass, they then undergo experiential learning of medicine by taking part in patient care in clinics and hospitals under the close supervision of board-certified physicians. After this year, they take the Step 2 Clinical Knowledge exam and formerly took the Step 2 Clinical Skills exam as well. DO students take the COMLEX Level 2-Cognitive Evaulation exam and previously took the COMLEX Level 2-Performance Evaluation exam. COMLEX 2-PE and Step 2 CS were discontinued in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic. They then go through one more year of experiential learning, often with elective rotations tailored to particular interests of study or future specialization. They also apply for the National Resident Matching Program in this year. Following their fourth and final year, they graduate from medical school and are awarded their MD or DO degree. If selected for a residency, they continue for a minimum of three to eight years in their specialty where they are officially licensed to practise after completion. New resident physicians, or interns, in the first year of residency, known as intern year or internship, often take the USMLE Step 3 exam or COMLEX Level 3 exam during that year.

Undergraduate students applying to medical school also have the option to apply to an MD/PhD Medical Scientist Training Program at various academic institutions, which entails 7–8 years of primary medical education that is combined with a doctoral thesis. MD/PhD students are required to take all USMLE exams and postgraduate residency training if they wish to practise medicine. A few schools, such as Ohio University&#x27;s Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine or the Michigan State University College of Osteopathic Medicine, offer DO/PhD programs.

Most MBBS physicians visiting or practising in the United States use the designation of MD for various personal and professional reasons, but laws may change to require full disclosure when presenting as a clinical practitioner for litigious reasons. The MD title is distinctly used in the US for physicians who earned their medical degree in the US who practise evidence-based medicine. They separate themselves from DOs who go through a different type of education and training that focuses on the patient as a whole and an array of treatments inclusive of medicine and surgery as well.

=== Vietnam ===
There are many medical schools in Vietnam, such as Hanoi Medical University, Vietnam University of Traditional Medicine, and Hue University of Medicine and Pharmacy. Most of them require six years to receive a Doctor of Medicine degree.

=== West Indies ===
All constituent countries of the University of the West Indies (UWI) confer &quot;MB BS&quot;, due to the historical affiliation of UWI to the University of London. The degree is a 5-year programme. The three physical campuses are Mona in Jamaica, Saint Augustine in Trinidad and Tobago, and Cave Hill in Barbados, with each campus having a Medical Faculty.
The University of Guyana (UG) also confers &quot;MB BS&quot; to their medical school graduates. There are other medical schools in the West Indies, but these follow the North-American system leading to &quot;MD&quot;.

=== Zambia ===
All schools in Zambia award the MBChB degree.

=== Zimbabwe ===
The University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences (UZ-CHS) awards the MBChB degree. Midlands State University (MSU) also offers the MBChB degree. The National University of Science and Technology (NUST) awards the MBBS.

== Classification ==
Medical degrees differ from other undergraduate degrees in that they are professional qualifications that lead holders to enter a particular career upon receipt. This is not the case with most other undergraduate degrees, so whilst the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery are undergraduate or graduate degrees (depending on the institution), they are perhaps more accurately conceptualised as a so-called first professional degree. Other professions whose qualifications follow a similar pattern include:
*Dentistry
*Education
*Engineering
*Environmental Health
*Occupational Therapy
*Optometry
*Pharmacy
*Physical Therapy
*Clinical Psychology
*Law
*Veterinary Medicine
*Osteopathy
*Physician Assistant
*Nursing
*OT Technician

Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery are usually awarded as professional degrees, not as honours degrees, and as such the graduate is not classified as for honours degrees in other subjects. However, at many institutions (for example the University of Aberdeen, University of Birmingham, University of Sheffield, University of Liverpool, University of Leicester, Hull York Medical School, and University of Manchester in England, Queen&#x27;s University Belfast in Northern Ireland, Cardiff University in Wales and the University of Dundee in Scotland), it is possible for the degrees to be awarded with Honours (i.e. MB ChB (Hons.)) or with Commendation, if the board of examiners recognises exceptional performance throughout the degree course. Very few of these are awarded.

More often, it is possible to study one subject for an extra year for an intercalated honours degree. This is usually a Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Medical Science (BMedSci), Bachelor of Medical Biology (BMedBiol) or similar: at Oxford and Cambridge in England and Dublin in Ireland Bachelor of Arts degrees are awarded. At a few universities most medical students obtain an ordinary degree in science as well: when the University of Edinburgh had a six-year course, the third year was followed by the award of an ordinary BSc(MedSci). In Australia, The University of Melbourne in Australia offers an Arts Degree (BA) to a medical student on the completion of two extra years of undergraduate study, and Monash University offers a law degree (LLB); if the optional law degree is undertaken, on completion of their degree the student may choose to do a one-year internship at a hospital and become a doctor, or spend one year doing articles to practise thereafter as a lawyer. At the University of Nottingham and the University of Southampton, both in England, all medical students on the five-year course obtain a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci) degree without an extra intercalated year. At the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London and University College London, certain medical students are able to extend their intercalated year to an extra three years, thus temporarily exiting the MBBS course to complete a PhD. Upon completion of the PhD, the student is required to sit the remaining 2 years of the medicine course to receive his/her MBBS degree. The University of the West Indies, Mona in Kingston, Jamaica automatically awards a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci) degree to all students who have successfully completed three years of their MBBS programme.

== Progression ==
Medical graduates are eligible to sit postgraduate examinations, including examinations for membership and fellowship of professional institutions. Among the latter are the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons, postgraduate master&#x27;s degrees (such as a Master of Surgery or Master of Medicine), and a postgraduate doctorate in medicine (such as Doctor of Medicine or Doctor of Science, if earned in Ireland, the UK or Commonwealth nations, and board certification examinations).

<doc id="910154" wikidata="Q1011020" url="?curid=910154" title="Orania">
<text>Orania () is a white separatist South African town founded by Afrikaners. It is located along the Orange River in the Karoo region of the Northern Cape province. The town is situated on the R369 highway, and is from Cape Town and approximately from Pretoria. Its climate is semi-arid.

The town was founded with the goal of creating a stronghold for the Afrikaner minority group, the Afrikaans language and the Afrikaner culture through the creation of an Afrikaner state known as a Volkstaat. The town is generally described by outside observers and scholars as &quot;Whites-only&quot; and as an attempt to revive apartheid, although the community denies this. Living in the town requires application, and acceptance is dependent upon being Afrikaner, demonstrating fluency in Afrikaans, a clean criminal record, and sharing the community&#x27;s values and goals. Afrikaner Calvinism is an important aspect of local culture. While the South African government has stated that it is opposed to the idea of a Whites-only community, it has generally ignored the town.

The town&#x27;s economy is focused on self-sufficiency and is largely based on agriculture, notably of pecan nuts. Orania prints its own money-like coupons which can be used to purchase in its stores and maintains the last transitional representative council in South Africa. The town has pursued energy independence primarily through solar power, constructed its own sewage works, and has experimented with introducing its own cryptocurrency as a replacement for cash.

Two South African presidents have visited the town. Nelson Mandela visited in 1995, and Jacob Zuma in 2010. The town has also received visits from tribal leaders from the Xhosa and Tswana people.

The town has grown at an annual rate that was estimated at 10% in 2019 — faster than any other town in South Africa. The population increased by 55% to 2,500 from 2018 to mid-2022, and to 2,800 in July 2023. In 2023, the town council announced plans for the population to grow to 10,000 as soon as possible.

==Ideology and purpose==
The stated goal of Orania&#x27;s founders was the preservation of Afrikaner cultural heritage, and &quot;selfwerksaamheid&quot; (&quot;&quot;). All jobs, from management to manual labour, are done by Afrikaners; non-Afrikaner people are not allowed to live or work there. The town&#x27;s monoculturalism and monoethnic philosophy rejects the concept of &quot;baasskap&quot;, where the White minority exploited Black labour for economic gain, in favour of a model of strict Afrikaner self-sufficiency.

Critics accuse the town authorities of rejecting the Rainbow Nation concept and trying to recreate apartheid-era South Africa within a White ethnostate.

Residents argue that they wish to preserve their own Afrikaner cultural heritage and protect themselves from crime in South Africa. They also reject the &quot;White&quot; label as meaningless.

==History==
===Early history of the area===
The Orania region has been inhabited since about 30,000 years ago when Stone Age hunter-gatherers lived a nomadic lifestyle there. A number of late Stone Age engravings indicate the presence of the San people, who remained the main cultural group until the second half of the 1700s, with the arrival of European hunters, trekkers and the Griqua people. The earliest indication of the presence of Afrikaner people in Orania dates to 1762; in the early 19th century, many farmers moved seasonally back and forth across the Orange River in search of better grazing. An 1842 Rawstone map shows the Vluytjeskraal farm, on which Orania would later be built. The first known inhabitant of what is today Orania was Stephanus Ockert Vermeulen, who purchased the farm in 1882.

=== Etymology ===

The Department of Water Affairs established the town as Vluytjeskraal in 1963 to house the workers who were building the irrigation canals connected to the Vanderkloof Dam. It was part of a bigger scheme to bring water to the semi-desert central parts of South Africa. Other comparable construction towns like Vanderkloof and Oviston were also established.

The Department of Water Affairs changed the name to Orania, a variation of the Afrikaans word &quot;oranje&quot;, referring to the adjoining river, after it was chosen in a competition. By 1965, it was home to 56 families. Coloured workers who participated in the construction project lived in a separate area named Grootgewaagd. The first phase of the irrigation project was completed in 1976. After the dam was completed, most of the workers moved away, and the town fell into disrepair during the 1980s. Grootgewaagd became home to a mixture of coloured and black families who squatted on the abandoned land. The Department of Water Affairs completely abandoned Orania in 1989.

===Origins of modern Orania===
The idea that Afrikaners should concentrate in a limited region of South Africa was first circulated by the South African Bureau for Racial Affairs (SABRA) in 1966. By the 1970s, SABRA advocated the idea of transforming South Africa into a commonwealth, where different population groups would develop parallel to each other. At the time, mainstream Afrikaners supported the bantustan policy, which allocated for the 15 million black Africans living in South Africa at the time. (See also: ethnic groups in South Africa.)

In 1981, Hendrik Verwoerd Jr (son of former South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd) advocated for Afrikaner homeland in an underpopulated area of the country. He believed that such a mini-state would run on computers and nuclear energy. To support his concept, he established the Society of Orange Workers, with hoped of a establishing its first establishment. The organisation attracted 325 members. 

May 1984 saw the establishment of the &quot;Afrikaner Volkswag&quot;, an organisation founded by Carel Boshoff, a right-wing academic and the son-in-law of former South African Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd. The goal of the Afrikaner Volkswag was to put the ideas of the SABRA into practice. Boshoff regarded contemporary plans of the National Party government to retain control through limited reforms as doomed to fail. Believing that black-majority rule could not be avoided, he supported the creation of a separate, smaller state for the Afrikaner nation instead.

In 1988, Boshoff founded the &quot;Afrikaner-Vryheidstigting&quot; (Afrikaner Freedom Foundation) or Avstig. The founding principles of the Avstig were based on the belief that since black majority rule was unavoidable, and European minority rule morally unjustifiable, Afrikaners would have to form their own nation, or &quot;Volkstaat&quot;, in a smaller part of South Africa. Orania was intended to be the basis of the &quot;Volkstaat&quot;, which would come into existence once a large number of Afrikaners moved to Orania and other such &#x27;growth points&#x27;, and would eventually include the towns of Prieska, Britstown, Carnarvon, Williston and Calvinia, reaching the west coast.

On 23 April 1994, the Freedom Front, the African National Congress and the National Party (South Africa) signed the Accord on Afrikaner self-determination. This led to article 235 of Constitution of South Africa, which guarantees the right of self-determination for cultural groups.

Boshoff&#x27;s plans excluded the area of traditional Boer republics in the Transvaal and the Free State, which encompass the economic heartland of South Africa and much of its natural resources, instead focusing on an economically underdeveloped and semi-desert area in the north-western Cape. This desert state, &quot;Orandeë&quot;, because of its very inhospitableness would not be feared or coveted by the South African government.

Proponents of the idea conceded that this model would demand significant economic sacrifices from Afrikaners who moved to the &quot;Volkstaat&quot;. The model is based on the principle of &#x27;own labour&#x27;, requiring that all work in the &quot;Volkstaat&quot; be performed by its citizens, including ploughing fields, collecting garbage and tending gardens, which is traditionally performed by blacks in the rest of South Africa.

The town was originally part of a strategy to create an Afrikaner majority in the northwestern Cape by encouraging the construction of other such towns, with the eventual goal of an Afrikaner majority in the area and an independent Afrikaner ethnostate between Orania and the West Coast. Boshoff had originally envisaged a population of 60,000 after 15 years. While he conceded that most Afrikaners might decide not to move to the &quot;Volkstaat&quot;, he thought that it was essential Afrikaners have this option, since it would make them feel more secure, thereby reducing tensions in the rest of South Africa.

===Establishment and recognition===

In December 1990, about 40 Afrikaner families headed by Carel Boshoff bought the dilapidated town of Orania for around R1.5 million (US$585,000), on behalf of Orania Bestuursdienste (OBD) from the Department of Water Affairs. In the lead-up to the move-in, some 500 black and colored people still lived in Orania (then called Grootgewaagd). 64 families were evicted by the Department of Water Affairs in early 1991, in one of the last largescale forced removals of Apartheid. The families were provided newly built homes, but were taken more than away to Warrenton, Northern Cape. Grootgewaagd village was renamed Kleingeluk. In April 1991, the first 13 inhabitants moved into Orania. At that time, the town consisted of 90 houses in Orania and 60 in Kleingeluk, all in serious disrepair. In August 1991, the farm Vluytjeskraal 272 was added to Orania. The National Party government led by F. W. de Klerk opposed the creation of an Afrikaner state, and the existence of Orania, but it took no action, believing it would fail on its own.

The town council was established in February 1992. A journalist for the &quot;Provinciale Zeeuwse Courant&quot;, visiting in 1993, noted that houses had been repaired, but the town lacked any meaningful economic activity. There were few jobs available, and no money for further development. The town relied on neighboring farms for food. Orania elected its own transitional representative council, a temporary form of local government created after the end of apartheid, in 1995. Construction on an irrigation scheme to cover a area began in 1995 and was completed in October 1996.

In a conciliatory gesture, President Nelson Mandela visited the town in 1995 to have tea with Betsie Verwoerd, widow of former Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd.

Orania grew to 200 permanent inhabitants in 1996. By 1998 R15 million had been invested in the town for expenses including the upgrading of water and electricity supply, roads and businesses.

On 5 June 1998, Valli Moosa, then Minister of Constitutional Development in the African National Congress (ANC) government, stated in a parliamentary budget debate that &quot;the ideal of some Afrikaners to develop the North Western Cape as a home for the Afrikaner culture and language within the framework of the Constitution and the Charter of Human Rights is viewed by the government as a legitimate ideal&quot;.

On 14 September 2010, the president of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, visited Orania. He said that he was &quot;warmly welcomed&quot;, that Orania had &quot;interesting ideas&quot;, and, &quot;the Oraniers were prepared to live in South Africa, but wanted a place to exercise their culture&quot;. In May 2023, Gayton McKenzie, leader of the Patriotic Alliance party, visited the town.

===Evolution of concept===
A policy shift was announced in 2014. Acknowledging that early growth expectations had not been met, the town&#x27;s chief executive argued that Orania should employ its limited resources to grow into a &#x27;city&#x27; of around 50,000 inhabitants. Urbanisation was deemed necessary to strengthen cultural institutions, deliver services and make possible an adequate standard of living for residents. However, the ultimate objective remains self-determination, similar to the small countries of Lesotho and Eswatini, which are also situated inside South Africa.

Carel Boshoff IV rejected the word &quot;Volkstaat&quot;, arguing that repeated use with no grounding in reality had led it to become an abstract term. While regarding an Afrikaner nation as desirable, he felt the word carried too much baggage, connected to unrealistic and anachronistic expectations. The vision of an &quot;Afrikanerstad&quot; was seen as a more effective way to achieve prosperity and decision-making power. The shift met with some resistance, as the Orania Movement was seen as straying away from its original goal. The movement since then promotes Orania as the &quot;Home of the Afrikaner&quot; (Afrikanertuiste).

In August 2023, Orania held a city planning conference in Pretoria where the new city plan from NewUrban city planners was released. The town is planning for substantial growth in the future with up to one million residents in the area anticipated.

===External reception===
Coverage generally describes Orania as culturally backward, racially intolerant, and separatist. Descriptions of Orania frequently call it &quot;whites-only&quot;, since the town only accepts Afrikaner residents.

Andrew Kenny, a regular contributor to &quot;The Citizen&quot; newspaper, wrote in 2015 that: &quot;Orania was a revelation to me. I was enormously impressed by its success, decency, safety, modesty, friendliness, cleanliness, by its spirit of goodwill, by its egalitarian attitudes and, above all, by its prevailing philosophy of freedom&quot;.

In 1991, the &quot;New York Times&quot; was not as impressed when it said that Orania was a &quot;ghost town where White supremacists dream of carving out an idyllic homeland&quot;. In 1994 the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described it as a &quot;Zealots&#x27; Dream&quot; and &quot;a bastion of intolerance&quot;. A year later the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; saw it as &quot;the last pathetic holdout of the former ruling class of South Africa&quot;, continuing that &quot;the Afrikaners who once forced blacks to live apart from the rest of society are now living in their own prison&quot;. Bill Keller dubbed Orania &quot;the racist Camelot&quot;. A &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot; article describes it as a &quot;widely ridiculed town&quot; and a &quot;media byword for racism and irredentism&quot;. An article in &quot;The Independent&quot; similarly writes that residents of Orania &quot;have a reputation for being racists, and that the town attracts plenty of negative press&quot;. Benjamin Pogrund described Orania as a &quot;curious hangover from the vanished terrible past&quot;.

Vadim Nikitin, writing for &quot;The National&quot; in 2011, described the conventional narrative about Orania as the last bastion of apartheid, and a &quot;pathetic outpost of embittered racists&quot; who refuse to live in equality with black South Africans. Nikitin notes that Orania lacks some of the conventional indications of privilege found in other post-apartheid White South African suburbs, such as black servants and some material luxuries. Eve Fairbanks, writing for &quot;Witness&quot;, describes Orania&#x27;s heavy emphasis on self-reliance as a paradox: &quot;While Orania is the place Whites can go to undergo the regimen most explicitly designed to cleanse themselves of the sins of apartheid, it is also the place they can go to live most visibly like they did before it ended.&quot;

Regarding the near-total segregation of the town and lack of any black residents, James Kirchick and Sebastian Rich of the &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; describe an uneasy relationship between the town&#x27;s residents and the country&#x27;s apartheid history. Orania&#x27;s strict ethnonationalism and anti-globalization are incompatible with both apartheid and the rainbow nation of modern South Africa. Despite this, Orania maintains several monuments of the apartheid which had been discarded from other places. The Orania Cultural History Museum includes busts of every apartheid president of South Africa except for F. W. de Klerk, whom the museum&#x27;s director considers a &quot;traitor&quot; for his part in the country&#x27;s transition to democracy. Leon Louw, the executive director of the South African Free Market Foundation, questioned the perception that the town is a refuge for racial bigots.

Gavin Haynes from Vice News said that, &quot;If you&#x27;re a certain way inclined, Orania is probably a nice place to live. It&#x27;s very neighbourly. It&#x27;s also one of the dullest, most achingly pointless places in Christendom&quot;.

Professor Kwandiwe Kondlo, a professor in political economy at the University of Johannesburg, said that Orania served as an important safety valve for Afrikaners in transition, and that &quot;The Afrikaners are very forward-thinking people. Orania was established as a tactical strategic exit for the Afrikaner, should the new South Africa run into serious crisis. They will then have a place to preserve themselves&quot;.

Rebecca Davis of the Daily Maverick feels that, &quot;What makes Orania different is that it makes no secret of its discrimination. Because of this, the town has come to occupy a place in the public imagination vastly out of proportion to its size&quot;.

===Afrikaner reception===

Most Afrikaners did not support the establishment of an Afrikaner state in the early 1990s, as they saw it as nothing more than an impractical pipe dream. Shortly after the first residents arrived in 1991, many Afrikaners derided the project as unrealistic, with even right-wingers rejecting it for its location in barren territory, far from traditional Afrikaner states. Two decades later, a survey of Beeld readers (in 2010), found that 56% of respondents would consider moving to a Volkstaat.

The largest right-wing party in apartheid-era South Africa, the Conservative Party, did not support the &quot;Volkstaat&quot; concept until 1993, shortly before converging with other right-wing organisations into the Afrikaner Volksfront. Even then, their plan involved separating parts of Transvaal Province, including Pretoria, to form a state where the many black residents would have only limited voting rights. Negotiations to this end were conducted with the African National Congress, but were inconclusive.

In 2010, Marida Fitzpatrick, journalist for the Afrikaans newspaper &quot;Die Burger&quot;, praised the town for its safety and environmentally friendly approaches to living, but also wrote that overt racist ideas and ideology still underpinned the views of many residents. Members of the AfriForum group who visited Orania in February 2015 came back with mostly positive impressions of the town, comparing it to a Clarens or Dullstroom of the Karoo.

In 2018, Afrikaans trade union, Solidariteit, and civil rights group AfriForum named Orania as one of their 30 &quot;anchor towns&quot; to which Afrikaner migration should be encouraged with the aim of becoming the majority population in these areas, making self determination possible.

===Internal and external threats===
Initially the presence of residents with politically extreme views hampered early attempts to gain broader acceptance for the community. Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) members made up a sizable minority of the population. In July 1991, one resident publicly threatened to resort to terrorism unless Orania was granted independence. By 1993, people with similarly militant views had reportedly been removed from the community.

In December 2000, the provincial government ordered the dissolution of Orania&#x27;s town council and its absorption into a new municipality along with neighbouring towns. Oranians lodged an application with the Northern Cape Division, which found that negotiations between the residents of Orania and the government for a compromise on Orania&#x27;s municipal status should take place; until such an agreement can be reached, the status quo would remain.

In May 2005, a dispute arose with a faction of residents who claimed the town was being run like a &#x27;mafia&#x27;, with a number of lawsuits being filed as part of the dispute. A raid on the town&#x27;s radio station in November 2005 was linked to a tip-off received from internal dissenters; they ultimately left the community.

In November 2005, around 20 coloured families who lived in Kleingeluk before 1991 lodged a land claim with the government for around of land within Orania. It was settled in December 2006 when the South African government agreed to pay the claimants R2.9 million in compensation.

Some black people from neighbouring communities feel that they are not welcome to visit the town, to buy in local shops or to use petrol stations.

In 2016, prior to the 2016 local elections, the Thembelihle branch of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) campaigned on a platform of ending the autonomous status of Orania, saying that Orania&#x27;s autonomy would no longer be tolerated in an EFF-run municipality. After a visit to Orania, Thembelihle&#x27;s EFF mayor, Danny Jonas, said he wanted to retain the status quo while working together with Orania for the benefit of Thembelihle. In 2009 the EFF&#x27;s future leader, Julius Malema, visited Orania. In 2019, Malema indicated that he agreed with the idea of moving landless black people to Orania.

In June 2020, Gauteng ANC MEC for education, Panyaza Lesufi, said that Orania had to fall as it is neither a symbol of inclusivity nor democracy. &quot;We understand why that institution was established. It has lived its time now. It&#x27;s now that that place must be liberated and all South Africans must be allowed to stay wherever they want to stay&quot;. He also said, &quot;If you think we will keep quiet you are wrong. This madness must come to an end. It&#x27;s a betrayal of our call for a truly non-racial SA&quot;. In response, anti-apartheid veteran and then ANC politician Carl Niehaus, who himself is an Afrikaner, said, &quot;Destroy the money, destroy the damn flag. Charge these White, Orania &#x27;Boere&#x27;, for their racism, throw them in jail&quot;.

In January 2021, the Orania Movement made a Facebook post about how Afrikaners should develop their own sport institutions in view of government controlled sports organisations being hostile to Afrikaners. Facebook removed this post as hate speech, according to their new policy of &quot;banning praise or support for White separatism&quot; from their platform. In response the Orania movement created a channel on Telegram.

==Afrikanerdom==
===Culture===
The &quot;Orania Beweging&quot; (Orania Movement) is a local political and cultural organisation that promotes Afrikaner history and culture.

Cultural institutions include the &quot;Orania Kunsteraad met orkes en koor&quot; (arts council with orchestra and choir) and the &quot;Orania Kultuurhistoriese museum&quot; (cultural history museum). Exhibits housed in the museum include the Felix Lategan gun collection and a Vierkleur flag carried by Jopie Fourie. The Koeksistermonument, erected in 2003, celebrates the women who baked and sold &quot;koeksisters&quot; to collect money for charity and is one of the town&#x27;s tourist attractions. The town also houses the Irish Volunteer Monument, dedicated to the Irish soldiers who fought on the Boer side during the Boer War (see Boer foreign volunteers). Jan van Wijk, who created the Afrikaans Language Monument in Paarl, designed the monument. It was moved from Brixton, Gauteng in 2002 by a group of Afrikaners concerned by its imminent demolition. There is also a Verwoerd museum, where items and photos of Hendrik Verwoerd are on display. It was the house where his widow lived from 1992 until her death at the age of 98 years in 2000.

A collection of busts of Afrikaner leaders, dumped by institutions that no longer wanted them after 1994, sits on a &#x27;monument hill&#x27; outside town. They look towards a statue of Orania&#x27;s mascot named Klein Reus (small giant), a small boy shown rolling up his sleeves and getting ready to do the work himself. These old and new statues are symbolic of the Afrikaner&#x27;s past and future. The small giant symbol is also used for the town&#x27;s flag, its currency and merchandise. It was designed by South African artist Elly Holm. The colours of the town&#x27;s flag is based on the Dutch Prince&#x27;s Flag, which was the flag under which Jan van Riebeeck of the Dutch East India Company founded the Cape Town refreshment station in 1652.

The Orania Karnaval (formerly Volkstaatskou) is the main cultural event in town. Held annually since April 2000, it features exhibitions, competitions and concerts from local and national Afrikaner artists, with food stalls offering traditional Afrikaner treats. The Ora currency and the Kleinreus flag were both introduced during the celebrations.

Traditional Afrikaner cultural activities such as &quot;volkspele&quot; dances and games of &quot;jukskei&quot; are promoted within the community. Karoo-style food such as skaapkop (sheep&#x27;s head) is part of the local culinary heritage. Like most White South Africans, Orania residents are rugby fans. The town has a rugby team, the Orania Rebelle, playing in the Griqualand West Rugby Union.

In its early years Orania offered few amusements to teenagers and young adults, who missed the entertainment offered by city life. 2014 witnessed the opening of the Ou Karooplaas shopping centre, which also houses a cinema, pizza parlor and DVD shop, as well as the Stokkiesdraai Adventure Park, which also has a pub and coffee shop.

===Cultural holidays===
Orania does not celebrate South African national holidays. Instead, it has largely carried over the national holidays from apartheid South Africa. Geloftedag (Day of the Vow) on 16 December is one of the most important holidays for the community. Locals wear traditional clothing and go to church to commemorate the victory of 470 Afrikaners over an army of 15,000 Zulu warriors in 1838.

A list of public holidays in Orania:
===Religion===
Orania is a deeply religious community, with local churches including the Dutch Reformed Church, Apostoliese Geloofsending, Afrikaanse Protestantse Kerk, Evangelies-Gereformeerde Kerk, Gereformeerde Kerk, Hervormde Kerk, Israel Visie and Maranata Kerk; all are Reformed Protestant except Maranata, which is part of the Charismatic Movement. According to a 2014 local census, the Afrikaanse Protestantse Kerk was the most popular denomination, followed by 21.9% of households in Orania, followed by unaffiliated households with 15.6%, the Dutch Reformed Church and the Maranatha Church (both 14.8%), Gereformeerd Church (7.4%). In total, 84.4% of households were affiliated with a religion.

The arrival of Orania residents from various parts of South Africa meant that newcomers brought a relatively large variety of denominations to their new town. In the early years, all denominations shared one church building. On important holidays such as the Day of the Vow interdenominational services are held. In accordance with first-day Sabbatarian principles, work stops on Sundays, except for services that are deemed essential.

The Afrikaanse Protestantse Kerk was established in 1991, making it the first church to be established in Orania. In 2015 the congregation counted 145 members. The church is located in a prefabricated building.

The Dutch Reformed Church in Orania was established in 1999, when it detached from the Hopetown congregation. The church is part of the &quot;ring&quot; (presbytery) of Hopetown and the synod of the Northern Cape. In March 2015, the Dutch Reformed Church in Orania voted against changes to the DRC Church Order allowing for the adoption of the Belhar Confession, as did a majority of churches in the Northern Cape Synod.

===Education===

The &quot;Orania Koördinerende Onderwysraad&quot; supervises all educational activities in Orania. Orania&#x27;s schools have consistently achieved a 100% matric pass rate since 1991.

There are two schools, the CVO Skool Orania (&quot;Christelike Volks-Onderwys&quot; or Christian People&#x27;s Education) and Volkskool Orania (Orania People&#x27;s School). Afrikaans is the language of instruction, while English is taught as a second language. Both schools follow the IEB curriculum; the CVO school offers a more conservative education, while the Volkskool is relatively more progressive.

The CVO-school, established in January 1993, is run along conventional lines. It boasts of a 100% matric pass rate since its inception. In 2014 enrollment was 225 students, with some coming from neighbouring towns. The school is growing, and had 400 students by 2021. The CVO School includes Christian tenets as a vital part of the education, and is part of the Beweging vir Christelik Volkseie Onderwys, a network of similarly minded schools across the country. As a Reformed Christian school, its teachings are in accordance with the Canons of Dort. In November 2020, the construction of 12 new classrooms started.

The Volkskool, established in June 1991 with Julian Visser as its first principal, uses a self-driven teaching (&quot;selfgedrewe&quot;) system which is unorthodox by South African standards. Because the town had few school-aged children when it was established, the school adopted a computer-based learning system that allowed students of different levels to be taught by a single teacher. The Volkskool&#x27;s e-learning system was seen as innovative and received attention from South African media in the early 2000s.

There is a rivalry between the schools, which is generally friendly but can occasionally become quite fierce. Not all local children attend them, as some parents choose homeschooling or boarding schools in cities such as Bloemfontein.

Bo-Karoo Opleiding, a vocational training college, offering courses in technical subjects such as welding, metalworking and engineering, was opened in 2017. In 2019, it started the first course with 5 students, by 2023 the total number of students increased to 108 students.

===Demographics===

A local census carried out in 2023, found 2,874 inhabitants. Children made up a third of the population. According to town authorities, the population had grown by 12% annually, much higher than the South African average of 1.3% per year.

Afrikaners were the main population group at the time of the 2011 census, representing 97% of the total. Male residents outnumbered females 60% to 40% in 2011. Afrikaans is the only language used in all spheres of local life. According to a 2014 census carried out by town authorities, Afrikaans is the main language spoken at home for 95% of residents, followed by English with 2%, with speakers of both English and Afrikaans making up the remaining 3%.

According to the 2011 census, 97.2% of the population of Orania was White.

==Economy==
===General===

About 244 businesses were registered in Orania in 2019, and town leaders reported annual economic growth in excess of 11%.

In 2019 Orania&#x27;s workforce was employed as follows: 269 service providers, 140 traders, 76 construction workers, 19 hospitality providers, 12 manufacturers, 66 in education, 27 agricultural service providers. The town hosts diverse industries, from macadamia farming, a toffee factory, a brewery, a call centre, stockbroking services, architecture, construction, etc. Previously, a permit was required to start new businesses in town, which was only granted if the new business did not compete with existing ones. The permit system proved unworkable, causing dissatisfaction among the residents, and was abolished.

The average wage in Orania was estimated at approximately R94,036 per annum in 2019, low by White South African standards. The lack of cheap labour means that living in Orania is more expensive than the rest of South Africa; at the same time, unskilled workers are scarce. In 2016, CNN reported the unemployment rate in Orania to be 2%. 

In Orania people from all levels of society perform their own manual labour. Local Afrikaners also work in unskilled positions such as gardening and waste collection. In 2009, 14% of the population was self-employed. Rapid growth over the four years to 2014 led to the construction of new commercial developments and a rising number of young adult immigrants, but also caused an increase in class differences between residents.

Orania also has a tourism industry. , thirteen independent hospitality businesses operated in the town. From October 2012 to February 2013, about 2,000 holidaymakers visited the town.

The Orania Chamber of Commerce was established in 2001. The Orania Spaar- en Kredietkoöperatief (Orania Savings and Credit Co-operative) is a local cooperative bank. It registered with the South African Reserve Bank in 2011, and in 2013 it had R45 million in savings deposits. During April 2004, Orania launched its own monetary system, called the Ora, based on the idea of discount shopping vouchers. Orania launched its own chequebook in 2007. The enclave is currently working to introduce the e-Ora, a digital version of the currency that is currently in circulation.

Orania has its own currency, the Ora, which is not sanctioned by the South African Reserve Bank and is referred as a coupon system by the Orania Chamber of Commerce. The Ora is pegged to the Rand and it was introduced to stimulate the circulation of money inside Orania and prevent theft. The Orania Chamber of Commerce, which issues the currency, uses the Rands deposited by the residents to earn interest. In 2021, the Dora, a digital version of the Ora, was introduced. The Dora did not replace the paper bills and, unlike them, it does not have an expiration date.

===Agriculture===

Farming is an important part of Orania&#x27;s economy, the most prominent project being a massive pecan nut plantation. The plantation is said to have given Orania a substantial economic boost. Most of the agricultural production is exported to China. Since purchasing the town, the community has added of agricultural land to it. A pumping station on the Orange River, financed and built by the town&#x27;s residents, provides water for agricultural use. The station is connected to a pipeline.

A R9 million dairy farm, the Bo-Karoo Suiwel, operated in Orania from 1998 to 2002. Though deemed one of the most modern dairies in South Africa at the time, the increased cost of imported machinery caused by a decline in value of the rand combined with a rise in the price of corn used to feed cattle led to its liquidation. Another ambitious project, a mill processing a range of corn products, was completed in 2005, but also proved unsuccessful and was closed down. The Orania management has since mostly eschewed large-scale projects, rather focussing on small- and micro-enterprises to develop the local economy.

===Construction===
The construction industry is an important element of the local economy. Orania counts 8 construction companies as of 2017. During 2020 the town set out and serviced 100 new stands, and has enough land available for a further 4200 erven, according to Frans De Klerk (head of the Orania Development Company.

The shortage of affordable housing is a significant problem in Orania. Given the relatively low local wages, even two mid-range salaries might not be enough to buy a house. Outside investors, who can afford to pay more using savings from previous employment outside Orania, inflate housing prices. While buildings from the Water Works era can rely on pre-existing utility connections, new builds face the additional cost of installing infrastructure, raising prices further. In 2010, property prices ranged from R250,000 at the low-end, up to R900,000 for new riverfront property. By 2020, property prices ranged from R420,000 at the low-end, up to R2,900,000 for a detached house. Average house prices in Orania have grown by 13.9% a year from 1992 to 2006.

===Environmental practices===
Town authorities have a strong focus on green practices, including recycling and conservation. Solar water heaters are a requirement for all new houses built in Orania.

Between 1991 and 2022, over 35,000 trees were planted in Orania.

In 2013, the Sonskip / Aardskip earthship living museum construction started in Orania, designed by Christiaan van Zyl, one of South Africa&#x27;s foremost experts on sustainable architecture. The building is open to the public as a living museum; it is the largest earthbag earthship in the world.

In 2014 Orania introduced a bicycle sharing system, called the &quot;Orania Openbare Fietsprojek&quot; (Orania Public Bicycle Project).

In 2022, it was reported that the construction of a 900kW solar energy plant was completed in Orania with the aim being energy independence. The plant is owned by the town&#x27;s council, which sells the electricity generated from solar to residents at the same price as Eskom to fund future expansion. In April 2024, Orania took possession of a 4.8 MWh BESS battery to power the town during rolling blackouts. 

In 2022, an audit of 18 landfill sites in the Northern Cape found that Orania&#x27;s dump is the only one in the Northern Cape that was compliant with government national standards.

In 2022, Orania completed its new sewage works in anticipation of 10,000 residents.

==Administration==
===Private company===
The town is privately owned by the Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok company (VAB, Vluytjiekraal Share Block). Ownership of plots and houses is in the form of shares in the company, according to a framework known as &#x27;share block&#x27; under South African law, similar to the strata title or condominium in other countries. No title deeds are provided, except for agricultural land. Share blocks are linked to portions of the company&#x27;s real estate property, and the shareholder acquires the right to use property linked to their share block.

A general meeting of shareholders is held every year. The shareholders, numbering about 400 as of 2017, vote for the company&#x27;s board of directors. The eight people on the board of directors form the village council (Dorpsraad). The board of directors elects a chairperson, who serves as the town&#x27;s mayor, and an executive officer who is responsible for the daily administration of the town. Other members of the board are given responsibility for community matters such as safety, planning and community services.

In September 2022, the Shareblock Company confirmed that Orania received its 31st clean and unqualified municipal audit.

Parts of the community are critical of the share block arrangement, as it offers no effective representation to people who rent their house, and thus are not shareholders in the company. Even shareholding residents feel they have only a limited say in the management of Orania.

Vluytjeskraal functions like a municipal administration, being funded by rates and delivering services like water, electricity and waste management. Utility companies like Eskom and Telkom provide services to this private entity, which then splits the costs and charges the end users. The budget for the fiscal year 2006/2007 was R2.45 million. Harry Theron is the company chairman as of 2018; Frans de Klerk is the chief executive officer.

Kambrolandskap Koöperatief is a separate legal entity acquiring land on Orania&#x27;s behalf. It owns land plots in share blocks, just like Vluytjeskraal Aandeleblok.

===Democratic institutions===

The Orania Verteenwoordige Raad (OVR, Orania Representative Council) is an elected institution, tasked with handling Orania&#x27;s political interests in negotiations on the provincial and national levels. It is the last transitional representative council extant in South Africa. The Representative Council is elected by all residents, including those who own no shares in the company.

Orania has its own municipal structure in the form of the Orania Representative Council based on the Local Government Transition Act of 1993, where other municipalities are based on the Municipal Structures Act of 1998. This legal framework was laid down in 2000 when an agreement between the Cabinet of South Africa, the Northern Cape government and the Orania Representative Council was reached about a provisional status for Orania. This agreement was confirmed by a ruling of the Northern Cape High Court.

Orania residents are eligible to vote in the Thembelihle municipal elections, but few choose to do so.

The Boshoff family are regarded as the &#x27;political elite&#x27; of Orania. They are generally seen as being relatively more liberal than most of the town&#x27;s other residents.

===Subdivisions and architecture===
Orania has three residential areas: &quot;Kleingeluk&quot; (&quot;small happiness&quot;), &quot;Grootdorp&quot; (&quot;big village&quot;) and &quot;Orania Wes&quot; (&quot;Orania West&quot;). Kleingeluk is a separate district about from Grootdorp, and is poorer than the main town, although progress has been made in narrowing the gap in living conditions.

Many houses in Orania are built in the Cape Dutch architectural style. Most of the original buildings from the water department era are prefabricated, and while some have been renovated others show signs of deterioration, as they were not designed to last more than 20 years. A &quot;City Press&quot; reporter wrote in 2013 that &quot;none of the town&#x27;s buildings are impressive&quot;.

===Territorial extension===
The town&#x27;s territory originally covered , and was expanded through a number of land acquisitions.

In August 1991, the 2,300-hectare (5,700-acre) farm farm Vluytjeskraal 272 was added to Orania. It was divided into smaller farmsteads, and now grows pecan nuts, olives and fruit.

Kambro Landbou Koöperatief is a legal entity established to buy land on Orania&#x27;s behalf. In 2004–2005, the purchase of two farms located south of Orania, Nooitgedacht and Biesiebult, added to the town&#x27;s territory. Biesiebult is a pasture, covering , and is used as grazing land for cattle. Nooitgedacht is a riverfront farm, located between Orania and Vanderkloof. It is used mostly for agriculture, with a smaller built-up area along the river bank. Kambro also own a farm west of Orania. The Masada farmhouse opposite Orania, about , was bought and proclaimed as an eco-park.

Farm Vluytjeskraal Noord was bought by a group of Orania residents in 2011. Vygiesvlakte is a farm on the West Coast, near Groenriviermond. It was purchased around 2012. After the Vluytjeskraal Noord purchase, the town administration decided that developing the infrastructure of existing land should be the priority, though new land acquisitions were not ruled out.

===Application process===
Prospective residents are required to go through an interview process with a committee, which may deny access to people based on criteria such as criminal records. Once permission is granted, the new residents become members of the community, either as shareholders if they buy property, or as tenants.

Being an Afrikaner is the most important criterion for admission. Although the town has no formal statute barring admission based on race, which would violate South Africa&#x27;s constitution, in practice only Whites are admitted. Though the community is not supportive of same-sex relationships, some gay people do live in Orania. Unmarried couples living together are also frowned upon.

Some people who try to live in Orania leave due to the limited choice of available jobs or the requirement to conform to local social norms. According to a 2004 study, 250 people had left Orania since its establishment in 1991, most of them due to &quot;physical and social pressure&quot;. The difference in lifestyle compared to an urban environment is another factor that negatively impacts newcomers.

===Social welfare===

Orania receives no fiscal contributions from either state or provincial government, and must generate all funds itself.

Orania has a 3-step program of dealing with destitute Afrikaner arrivals: stabilisation, rehabilitation and integration. First they are supplied with housing, next work, and then land at 10% of market value + interest-free loans from the local co-operative bank for the construction of a house.

The Helpsaam Fund, a non-profit institution, raises money for projects like subsidised housing for newcomers in need. The Elim Centre accommodates unemployed young men who come to Orania seeking employment. Most are destitute when they arrive. They are usually given work with the municipality or local farms, and provided with training. Nerina, the equivalent residential complex for women, was completed in July 2012.

In 2013, Orania had a small clinic, and a government-funded nurse visited twice a month. By 2020, the town had a doctor, a physiotherapist, a radiographer, and a pharmacist according to Frans De Klerk, head of the Orania Development Company. The town has two airstrips, one and the other .

===Law enforcement===
Orania has neither an official police force nor a prison. Although crime is not non-existent, it is very low, helped by having a small population whose residency applications are strictly examined. Traffic monitoring and minor crimes such as petty theft are handled internally. Volunteers carry out neighbourhood watch patrols. In October 2014 &quot;Orania Veiligheid&quot; (Orania Security) was established as the town&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; municipal police, to handle reports of illegal activities such as theft, but also more trivial matters such as littering and noise complaints. Apprehended suspects are taken to the South African Police Service station in neighbouring Hopetown. National police are only called in as a last resort. Residents are exhorted to use mediation and arbitration procedures made available by the town council, rather than resorting to South African courts.

In 2017, local media reported on child abuse committed by an elderly Orania resident that went undetected for years.

In 2019, the SAPS&#x27;s Child Protection Unit visited the Volkskool Orania school to investigate a case of statutory rape against a student teacher. The student teacher was charged before the Hopetown Magistrate&#x27;s Court.

===External relations===
Over the years, Orania has been visited by many public figures, including Northern Cape Premier Dipuo Peters (in 2004), Julius Malema (in 2009), Desmond Tutu (in 2010), and former President Jacob Zuma (in 2010).

In June 2007, the Cape Coloured community of Eersterust, outside Pretoria visited the Afrikaner enclave. The groups met to discuss community development and discussed methods of self-governance. On 4 July 2007 the town of Orania and the Northern Cape government agreed that all government levels should discuss the question of Orania&#x27;s self-government.

Orania and the Xhosa community of Mnyameni signed a cooperation agreement in December 2012, to assist in the development of own institutions and the transfer of knowledge between the communities.

Members of the Orania Beweging, including its president Carel Boshoff, went on a European tour in 2013, meeting with MPs from the Partij voor de Vrijheid of the Netherlands, the Vlaams Belang party in Belgium and Südtiroler Volkspartei in Italy&#x27;s South Tyrol province. In 2022, representatives of Orania visited politicians and two Parliaments in Europe (The Netherlands and Belgium) to make the case that Afrikaners are a victimised minority in South Africa.

Boshoff rejected an invitation to the funeral of Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB) leader Eugene Terre&#x27;Blanche in April 2010, as he saw him as having chosen a path of confrontation and conflict. Boshoff IV also noted that the Orania concept was at odds with the baasskap system of the apartheid period.

In August 2018, the Orania movement met with the previous president, Thabo Mbeki, as part of their public relations efforts.

In July 2022, two tribal leaders visited Orania on diplomatic missions. Representatives from the AmaBhele kaJamangile of the Xhosa people and king Seleka Barolong of the Tswana people met with Orania&#x27;s leadership. The purpose of the visits was ‘to learn more about self-determination’.

===Elections===
Since 1994, citizens of Orania have voted in the six national elections. Over the last three elections, Orania had an average vote turnout of 65%, based on registered voters. In the South African general elections in 2004, 2009, and 2014, the community voted decisively for the Freedom Front Plus party. The four votes recorded for the Economic Freedom Fighters party in the 2014 election elicited a number of comments from South African media.

In the 2019 general elections, the EFF took its members from surrounding areas to the voting station in Orania. In the 2021
municipal elections the FF Plus garnered some 88% of the votes, the DA almost 11% and the ACDP over 1%.

;Notes:
===Media===
The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA) shut down the first local community radio, &quot;Radio Club 100&quot;, in November 2005 for broadcasting without a licence and being a &quot;racist-based station&quot;. The station&#x27;s management contended they had repeatedly applied for a licence and were merely carrying out tests, and that they broadcast news about birthdays and social events. ICASA granted a licence to the new Radio Orania in December 2007, and the station began broadcasting on 13 April 2008 on 95.5 MHz. The community station is run by volunteers and counts over 50 contributors. Programmes include readings of Afrikaans literature such as Mikro&#x27;s &quot;Die ruiter in die nag&quot;.

&quot;Dorpnuus&quot;, the town hall&#x27;s newsletter, was launched in November 2005 and reports on local events and meetings of the town council. &quot;Volkstater&quot; is an independent local publication that is sent to supporters of the &quot;Volkstaat&quot; idea, mostly non-residents of Orania, and deals with local events and Afrikaner history. &quot;Voorgrond&quot;, a publication of the Orania Beweging, is aimed primarily at non-residents who support the movement.

==Geography==
The climate of the area around the town is that of a dry-winter desert (Köppen &quot;BWhw&quot; or &quot;BWkw&quot;, depending on how these designations are defined). Orania is part of the Nama Karoo biome, and receives of rain a year. More than 30,000 trees have been planted in Orania and the surrounding farmlands.

The tree vegetation of Orania includes common karee (&quot;karee&quot;), white karee (&quot;witkaree&quot;), buffalo-thorn (&quot;blinkblaar-wag-’n-bietjie&quot;), shepherd&#x27;s tree (&quot;witgat&quot;) and common acacia (&quot;soetdoring&quot;).

==Works about Orania==
The unusual and controversial nature of Orania has drawn the interest of researchers, especially in the field of anthropology. Kotze (2003) examines Orania as a case of a non-declining small town in South Africa. Steyn (2004) elaborates on the town&#x27;s bottom-up approach to development. De Beer (2006) considers the achievements of Orania, deeming it unlikely that it will ever succeed in bringing about self-determination. Terisa Pienaar analyzed the &quot;Volkstaat&quot; concept, and the suitability of Orania as a growth point for a &quot;Volkstaat&quot;. Lindi Todd included Orania in a study on how the Afrikaner identity developed after the end of apartheid. Liesel Blomerus focused on the identity of Afrikaner women in the town. Lise Hagen addressed the concepts of space and place in Orania. South African economist Dawie Roodt described the town as being &quot;like a Petri dish&quot; for economic research.

In September 2012, a German documentary film titled &quot;Orania&quot; premiered at London&#x27;s Raindance Film Festival. The film is a sociological study of the town. The town was also featured in a 2009 documentary produced by France Ô, &quot;Orania, citadelle blanche en Afrique&quot; and in 2018, the town featured in &quot;Farmlands&quot; a documentary about farm murders in South Africa, produced by Lauren Southern. 

On 17 May 2023, Channel 4 commissioned a documentary in which British television presenter Ade Adepitan travels to Orania to understand the mindset of its people. The film was entitled &quot;Whites Only: Ade&#x27;s Extremist Adventure&quot;, and it premiered on 18 March 2024. In the documentary, Adepitan concluded that it&#x27;s &quot;too simplistic to brand everyone in Orania a racist&quot;, but that they are prejudiced. He thought that many in Orania are traumatised by the end of apartheid, and that they want to recreate their past. But Adepitan sees this as a form of extreme racial separatism, and says he doesn&#x27;t want to live in a world where people are &quot;segregated into ethnically cleansed states&quot;.
