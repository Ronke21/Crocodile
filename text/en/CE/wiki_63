<text>Heves was an administrative county in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory, which is now in northern Hungary, was slightly larger than that of present Heves county. The capital of the county was Eger.

==Geography==
Heves county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun, Nógrád, Gömör-Kishont, Borsod, Hajdú and Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok. It stretched from the Mátra and Bükk mountains to and across the river Tisza. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Heves county was formed in the 13th century. The territory of Heves was conquered by the Ottomans in 1596 (see Ottoman Hungary) and formed part of the Ottoman Eğri Eyalet until it was retaken by the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary in 1687.

In 1765 it was ; due to the occupation the latter could not maintain its administration (the justice system had already been merged in 1569).

Following the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848 a period of military dictatorship and centralisation began in Hungary. Heves-Külső-Szolnok was re-partitioned on 13 September 1850 into Heves and Szolnok counties. The border between Heves and Szolnok mostly followed the Tisza river. As of 1853 Heves comprised the and of Erlau (Eger) and the of Pétervásár, Heves, and Gyöngyös. Both counties formed part of the District of Pest-Ofen during this period. The traditional counties of Hungary, including Heves-Külső-Szolnok, were restored in October 1860.

Heves County was recreated again in the newly arranged Hungarian county system of 1876. Its territory after 1876 was broadly similar to its 1850s iteration but with the addition of Tisza-Füred south of the Tisza.

After World War II, the territory of the county was modified: the region around Pásztó became part of Nógrád county, the area on the left bank of the Tisza (Tiszafüred) became part of Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county, and an area north of Eger was transferred from Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county.

<text>Marlene Ahrens Ostertag-Ebensperger (July 27, 1933 – June 17, 2020) was a Chilean athlete. She won the silver medal in Javelin throw at the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne with a distance of 50.38 metres. She was the mother of journalist Karin Ebensperger.

== Biography ==
Ahrens was born in Concepción, Chile, the daughter of German immigrants. In Melbourne, she was the Chilean flag bearer, and the only woman on the Olympic team. She participated in the Javelin throw, winning the silver medal with a distance of 50.38 metres. In doing so, she became the first Chilean woman to win an Olympic medal. She won gold in both 1959 Pan American Games, held in Chicago, and 1963 Pan American Games held in São Paulo. Also, she again was the flag bearer in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, although she did not win a medal. Ahrens was forced to retire after having a dispute with the Chilean newspaper Clarín, and she was banned from competing in the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

After athletics she began to play tennis and in 1967, won the Chilean national tournament in mixed doubles with Omar Pabst. Soon after that, she injured her knee and dedicated her life to Equestrianism. She competed in the 1995 Pan American Games in Mar del Plata. She retired from horse riding in 2012, at 79 years old.

She married Jorge Roberto Ebensperger Grassau, a hockey player and another descendant of German settlers; they gave birth to 2 children: Karin Ebensperger and Roberto Ebensperger. She is the grandmother of Marlén Eguiguren, also a journalist like her mother Karin.

On the night of June 17, 2020, Ahrens died of heart failure in Santiago de Chile at the age of 86.

<text>Akaka Falls State Park is a state park on Hawaii Island, in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The park is about north of Hilo, west of Honomū off the Hawaii Belt Road (Route 19) at the end of Hawaii Route 220. It includes its namesake Akaka Falls, a tall waterfall. &quot;Akaka&quot; is named after Chief &#x27;Akaka-o-ka-nī&#x27;au-oi&#x27;o-i-ka-wao, grandson of Kūlanikapele and Kīakalohia. The accessible portion of the park lies high on the right shoulder of the deep gorge into which the waterfall plunges, and the falls can be viewed from several points along a loop trail through the park. Also visible from this trail is Kahūnā Falls, a tall waterfall, and several smaller cascades.
Local folklore describes a stone here called &quot;Pōhaku a Pele&quot; that, when struck by a branch of &quot;lehua āpane&quot;, will call the sky to darken and rain to fall. &quot;Lehua āpane&quot; or &quot;ōhia āpane&quot; is an &quot;ōhia&quot; tree (&quot;Metrosideros polymorpha&quot;) with dark red blossoms.

Akaka Falls is located on Kolekole Stream. A large stone in the stream about upstream of the falls is called &quot;Pōhaku o Kāloa&quot;.

==Wildlife==
The oopu alamoo is an endemic Hawaiian species of goby fish that spawns in stream above the waterfall, but matures in the sea. These fish have a suction disk on their bellies that allows them to cling to the wet rocks behind and adjacent to the waterfall. Using this disk, they climb back up to the stream when it is time to spawn. A shrimp called the ōpaekalaole has also evolved to climb Akaka Falls and live in Kolekole Stream.

<doc id="923893" wikidata="Q79375" url="?curid=923893" title="Giro (banking)">
<text>A giro transfer, often shortened to giro (), is a payment transfer between current bank accounts and initiated by the payer, not the payee. The debit card has a similar model. Giros are primarily used in Europe; although electronic payment systems exist in the United States (e.g., the Automated Clearing House), it is not possible to perform third-party transfers with them. In the European Union, the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) allows electronic giro or debit card payments in euros to be executed to any euro bank account in the area.

== Name ==
The word &quot;giro&quot; is borrowed from Dutch and/or German , which are both from the Italian meaning &quot;circulation of money&quot;. The Italian term comes via the Latin meaning &quot;gyre&quot; from the Greek meaning &quot;circle&quot;.

== History and concept ==
Giro systems originated in Ptolemaic Egypt in the 4th century BCE, where state granary deposits functioned as an early banking system with a central bank in Alexandria accepting giro payments. Giro was a common method of money transfer in early banking.

The first occurrences of book money are not known exactly. The giro system itself can be traced back to the &quot;&quot;bancherii&quot; in Northern Italy, especially on the Rialto (a financial centre, resembling the modern day Wall Street or the City of London). Originally these were money changers sitting at their desk (&quot;bancus&quot;&quot; = bench) that customers could turn to. They offered an additional service to keep the money and to allow direct transfer from one money store to another by checking the accounts in their storage books. Literally they opened one book, withdrew an amount, and opened another book where the amount was added. This handling was naturally a very regional system but it allowed the money to circulate in the books. This led finally to the foundation of the &quot;Banco del Giro&quot; in 1619 (in Venetian, &quot;Banco del Ziro&quot;) which gave the blueprint for similar banking systems. The usage in German can be seen in the Banco del Giro founded in Vienna in 1703 (to extend the financing business that Samuel Oppenheimer had brought from Venice in 1670).

Postal giro or postgiro systems have a long history in European financial services. The basic concept is that of a banking system not based on cheques, but rather by direct transfer between accounts. If the accounting office is centralised, then transfers between accounts can happen simultaneously. Money could be paid in or withdrawn from the system at any post office, and later connections to the commercial banking systems were established, often simply by the local bank opening its own postgiro account.

By the middle of the 20th century, most countries in continental Europe had a postal giro service. The first postgiro system was established in Austria in the early 19th century. When the time the British postgiro was conceived in 1968, the Dutch postgiro was very well established with virtually every adult having a postgiro account, and very large and well-used postgiro operations in most other countries in Europe. Banks also adopted the giro as a method of direct payment from remitter to receiver.

The term &quot;bank&quot; was not used initially to describe the service. The banks&#x27; main payment instrument was based on the cheque, which has a totally different remittance model from that of a giro.

== Model ==

In the banking model, cheques are written by the paying party and then handed or mailed to the payee, who must then visit a bank or mail the cheque to their bank. The cheque must then be cleared, a complex process by which cheques are sorted once, mailed to a central clearing location, sorted again, and then mailed back to the paying branch, which verifies that the funds are available and pays the payee&#x27;s bank.

In the postal giro model, the paying party sends a request to pay the payee (called a giro transfer) to the giro centre, which verifies that the funds are available, debits the payer&#x27;s accounts by the amount requested, and credits that amount to the payee&#x27;s account. The giro centre then sends the giro transfer document to the payee, and an updated account statement to both the payer and payee. In the case of large utilities receiving thousands of payments per day, statements are sent electronically and incorporate a unique reference number for each payment for purposes.

In the United States, the rise of electronic cheque clearing (and debit cards as preferred instruments of payment) has made this difference less important than it once was. In some stores in the United States, checks are scanned at the cash register and handed back to the customer. The scanned information is forwarded to a payment processor, which transfers the money using the ACH Network.

Unlike the banking model, the postal giro model allows an individual to transfer money directly into another individual&#x27;s bank account, provided the sender has the recipient&#x27;s account details. The recipient is not required to approve or acknowledge the transfer or visit the bank to claim it. As a result, cheques are rarely used in countries with extensive giro networks, such as Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries.

Direct deposit systems such as those in common use in the United States, by contrast, require the recipient&#x27;s explicit approval, typically provided by filling out a form. Transferring funds from one personal bank account to another typically requires either a physical check or a wire transfer, which may incur a significant fee and require the paying party to visit the bank.

In giro systems, credit risk for currency transfers is borne by operators like banks as interbank credit risk, but not by the payer or payee, unlike with cheques or credit cards. This eliminates the need to evaluate the payer&#x27;s creditworthiness, as transactions can only be initiated with sufficient funds. However, the lack of credit also means the payer has no protection against dishonest payees, and transactions cannot be recalled or disputed. Fraud is easier in interpersonal transactions, so payments should only be made to trusted parties. Additionally, while intra-bank transfers are fast, interbank transfers may take several days unless both parties use an instant transfer system like the UK&#x27;s Faster Payments or Canada&#x27;s Interac e-transfer.

== Electronic bill payment ==
Modern electronic bill payment is similar to the use of giro.

Advantages include:
* Instant access to the funds via an ATM, debit card or cheque card.
* There is no paper cheque that can be lost, stolen, or forgotten.
* Payments made electronically can be less expensive to the payer; typically electronic payments may cost around $0.25 (US) whereas it could cost up to $2 (US) to generate, print and mail a paper cheque. Banks may not even charge for the service at all; for example many banks in the European Union charge nothing for electronic payments inside the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area), provided the proper BIC and IBAN account numbers are used.
* The payment error rates and subsequent reconciliation issues are significantly reduced.

In the United States, the ACH Network, regulated by NACHA and the Federal Reserve Bank, handles all interbank transfers, including direct deposit and direct debit.

In entirely electronic bill payment, the payer receives a bill—either physically by mail or electronically from a website (electronic billing). Then, the payer reads in the information from the bill, either manually or by using the barcode on the bill (ex: EPC QR Code in the European Union), enters it to the form on the bank website, and submits the form. The payment is immediately deducted from the account balance. This is common in Sweden with giro invoices in the standard formats, which can be scanned by a mobile banking app, have their numbers manually typed in to a web form, or physically presented to a bank in the traditional manner.

<text>Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok was an administrative county (comitatus) in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory, which is now in central Hungary, was slightly smaller than that of present Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county. The capital of the county was Szolnok.

==Geography==
Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county shared borders with the Hungarian counties Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun, Heves, Hajdú, Békés, and Csongrád. The rivers Tisza and Körös flow through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==History==
Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok county was formed in 1876 from the territories of the Külső-Szolnok part of Heves-Külső-Szolnok County, the Jászság (Jazygia) and the Nagykunság (&quot;great Cumania&quot;). After World War II, the territory of the county was modified: the area on the left bank of the Tisza around Tiszafüred was taken from Heves county, and the area around Dévaványa went to Békés county.

The term &quot;Jász&quot; originates from the Jassic people (cf. Alans) who moved to this area of Hungary from the Pontic steppes sometime in the 13th century.

<text>Trencsén county (Latin: &quot;comitatus Trentsiniensis / Trenchiniensis&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Trencsén (vár)megye&quot;; Slovak: &quot;Trenčiansky komitát / Trenčianska stolica / Trenčianska župa&quot;; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in western Slovakia.

==Geography==

Trencsén county shared borders with the Austrian lands Moravia, Galicia, and Silesia, and the Hungarian counties Árva, Turóc and Nyitra. The county&#x27;s territory was a strip in the extreme northwestern edge of present-day Slovakia, i.e. the territory between the Czech border, the town of Vágújhely, the Turóc county, the Árva county and the Polish border. The river Vág flowed through the county. Its area was 4,456 km2 around 1910.

==Capitals==
The capital of Trencsén County was the Trenčín Castle (), and from around 1650 the town of Trencsén.

==History==
A predecessor of the Trencsén county maybe existed already in the 9th century, at the time of Great Moravia, with a center in Ducové. In the 10th and 11th century, the county was probably temporarily part of Bohemia and then temporarily of Poland (&quot;castellania Trecen&quot;).

The Trencsén county as a Hungarian &quot;comitatus&quot; arose at the end of the 11th century, when most parts of the territory were conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary. Traditionally, the office of hereditary lord lieutenant of Trencsén county was held by the Csák, Cseszneky and Illésházy families.

In the aftermath of World War I, Trencsén county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. The county as (&quot;Trenčianska župa&quot;) continued to exist until 1922, but it had completely different powers, etc.

During the existence of the first Slovak State between 1939 and 1945, Trenčín county was recreated again in 1940, but its territory was slightly extended. After World War II Trenčín county became part of Czechoslovakia again. In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and Trenčín became part of Slovakia.

<text>Zólyom county (; ; ; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Slovakia.

==Geography==
Zólyom county shared borders with the counties of Bars, Turóc, Liptó, Gömör-Kishont, Nógrád and Hont. The county&#x27;s territory was situated along the central Garam river, approximately between (excluding) Korpona and (including) Breznóbánya. Its area was 2634 km2 around 1910. The county was characterised by extensive mining activities.

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the castle of Pusztavár near Zólyom, then from the late 15th century the Zvolen Castle () and from the 1760s the town of Besztercebánya.

==History==
Zólyom county arose as a Hungarian comitatus in the 14th century, when most parts of the territory were conquered by the Kingdom of Hungary, from a huge royal property (the &quot;Vetusolium dominium&quot;). Initially, it comprised with a territory of the latter separated Árva, Turóc and Liptó counties.

In the aftermath of World War I, Zólyom county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. The Zvolen county (&quot;Zvolenská župa&quot;) continued to exist until 1927, but it had completely different powers etc. and somewhat different borders. During the existence of the newly created Slovak State (1939–1945), Hron county (&quot;Pohronská župa&quot;) was created in 1940, whose territory roughly corresponded to that of the Zvolen county. The capital was Banská Bystrica.

Together with the Slovak parts of Hont and Gömör, it became part of the Banská Bystrica Region (&quot;Banskobystrický kraj&quot;) created in 1948. In 1993, Czechoslovakia was split and the Zvolen county became part of Slovakia.

<doc id="923905" wikidata="Q4925168" url="?curid=923905" title="Blanket mortgage">
<text>A blanket mortage, or blanket loan, is a type of mortgage used to fund the purchase of more than one piece of real property. Blanket loans are popular with builders and developers who buy large tracts of land, then subdivide them to create many individual parcels to be gradually sold one at a time. Rather than securing a new mortgage each time a portion of the development is sold, the borrower uses the blanket loan to buy them all. Once a parcel is sold, a portion of the mortgage is released, with the rest of the mortgage remaining intact.

In the United States, traditional mortgages typically have a &quot;due-on-sale clause&quot;, which stipulates that if property secured by the mortgage is sold, the entire outstanding mortgage debt must be paid in full immediately. With a blanket mortgage, a “release clause” allows the sale of portions of the secured property and corresponding partial repayment of the loan. This is done to facilitate purchases and sales of multiple units of property with the convenience of a single mortgage.

A builder, for example, might use a blanket mortgage to pay for construction of several homes in one neighborhood. When a home is sold, the portion of the mortgage that was used to fund that home is paid back to the lender, and then retired. The remaining outstanding balance is adjusted accordingly, and the blanket mortgage continues phase by phase in that manner, until all houses are sold and the entire mortgage is repaid and retired.

==Early life and education==
The youngest of five children, Lederer grew up in West Philadelphia. He graduated from Haverford College as a pre-med student. He attended Harvard Law School for one year, then switched to the Master of Arts in Teaching Program at Harvard University. He taught English and media at the St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire for 27 years until 1989. In 1980, he earned a PhD in Linguistics from the University of New Hampshire. His Jewish parents were from Poland and Germany, and he had a bar mitzvah.

==Career==
He has written more than 50 books, including &quot;Anguished English&quot; books starting in 1987, &quot;Get Thee to a Punnery&quot; (1988), &quot;Crazy English&quot; (1989), &quot;The Miracle of Language&quot; (1992), &quot;Amazing Words&quot; (2011), and &quot;The Joy of Names&quot; (2018).

Known as a &quot;verbivore,&quot; a word he coined in the late 1980s, Lederer&#x27;s interests include uncovering word and phrase origins, pointing out common grammatical errors and fallacies, and exploring palindromes, anagrams, and other forms of recreational wordplay.

His books about various subjects other than language include &quot;Presidential Trivia&quot; (2007), &quot;A Treasury for Cat Lovers&quot; (2009) and &quot;A Treasury for Dog Lovers&quot; (2009), &quot;The Gift of Age&quot; (2011), &quot;A Tribute to Teachers&quot; (2011), and &quot;American Trivia&quot; with Caroline McCullagh (2012).

In 1998, he and Charles Elster became the first co-hosts of the weekly radio show, &quot;A Way with Words&quot;, produced by KPBS, San Diego Public Radio, and broadcast by multiple stations throughout the United States. In October 2006, Lederer retired from &quot;A Way with Words&quot; and was replaced by Grant Barrett. He continues broadcasting through regular guest appearances on several major market public and Clear-Channel commercial radio stations.

Lederer makes more than a hundred appearances each year, many of them benefit performances in San Diego.

<text>Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun is the name of an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now in central Hungary, comprising roughly the territory of the present Hungarian county Pest and the northern part of present Bács-Kiskun county. The capital of the county was Budapest.

==Geography==
The Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun county shared borders with the counties Komárom, Esztergom, Hont, Nógrád, Heves, Jász-Nagykun-Szolnok, Csongrád, Bács-Bodrog, Tolna and Fejér. Its territory covered the eastern bank of the river Danube from Visegrád in the north to (excluding) Baja in the south, stretching to the river Tisza in the east. A part of the county (Pilis) was on the west bank of the Danube, near Budapest. Its area was 12,228 km2 around 1910. It was the largest and by far the most populous county of Hungary.

==History==
The counties Pest and Pilis were formed in the 11th century. Pest was the area on the left (east) bank of the Danube around present-day Budapest, Pilis was on the opposite bank. They were united and became the political, cultural and economical centre of Hungary. The Solt region (the left bank of the Danube south of Ráckeve), which previously belonged to Fejér county, was incorporated into Pest-Pilis-Solt county in the 17th century. Kiskunság (Little Cumania) was added in 1876, creating Pest-Pilis-Solt-Kiskun county.

After World War II, the county was split into two roughly equal parts. The northern part became Pest county, the southern part merged with Bács-Bodrog county to form Bács-Kiskun county.

The Bearhawk was designed in the early 1990s as a personal project by Barrows to carry aircraft engines for delivery as freight. It features a strut-braced high-wing, a four-seat enclosed cabin that is wide and accessed by doors, fixed conventional landing gear and a single engine in tractor configuration.

The aircraft fuselage is made from welded steel tubing covered in doped aircraft fabric, while the wings are made from aluminum sheet. Its span wing employs a NACA 4412 mod airfoil, has an area of and mounts flaps. The aircraft&#x27;s recommended engine power range is and standard engines used include the Lycoming O-360 and Lycoming O-540 four-stroke powerplants. Construction time from the supplied kit is 1200 hours.

The prototype was fitted with a Lycoming O-360 burning automotive fuel, but in August 2023, the option of fitting the DeltaHawk DHK180 type certified, two-stroke diesel engine was added.

==Operational history==
By October 2016, 77 examples had been registered in the United States with the Federal Aviation Administration and 11 with Transport Canada.

<doc id="923910" wikidata="Q2429491" url="?curid=923910" title="Three Lions (song)">
<text>&quot;Three Lions&quot;, commonly referred to as &quot;It&#x27;s Coming Home&quot; or &quot;Football&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;, is a song by the English comedians David Baddiel and Frank Skinner and the rock band the Lightning Seeds. It was released on 20 May 1996 through Epic Records to mark the England football team&#x27;s participation in that year&#x27;s UEFA European Championship, which England was hosting.

The music was written by the Lightning Seeds singer Ian Broudie, while Baddiel and Skinner—presenters of the football comedy show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;—provided the lyrics. All three provided vocals. The title comes from the England team emblem.

Both the original version of &quot;Three Lions&quot; and the updated &quot;Three Lions &#x27;98&quot; reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. It regularly reappears in the UK singles chart around major football tournaments involving the England team. Its accompanying music video was directed by Pedro Romhanyi.

The song has been described as the &quot;de facto&quot; &quot;anthem&quot; of English football since 1996. Its chorus, with the refrain &quot;It&#x27;s coming home&quot;, has become a popular chant for fans at England games.

==Writing==
The Football Association (FA) asked Lightning Seeds songwriter Ian Broudie to compose a song for the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship. He composed a melody he felt would make a good football chant, and asked the comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, presenters of the football comedy show &quot;Fantasy Football League&quot;, to write the lyric. Broudie refused the FA&#x27;s offer to have football players sing on the song, saying he did not want it to be &quot;England-istic&quot; or nationalistic. He said it was more about &quot;being a football fan, which, for 90% of the time, is losing&quot;.

According to Skinner&#x27;s autobiography, the original lyric included the line &quot;Butcher ready for war&quot; instead of &quot;Bobby belting the ball&quot;. The line was a reference to a notorious World Cup qualifier against Sweden in 1989, when the defender Terry Butcher played despite his head bleeding profusely for much of the match. Baddiel later revealed a handwritten copy of the lyrics on Twitter with &quot;Terry Butcher at war&quot; shown as the replaced lyric. The FA requested that this line be changed to avoid suggestions of hooliganism imagery. The &quot;ready for war&quot; motif was later used in the 1998 version of the song, attributed to Paul Ince.

The crowd noise in the intro of the track is Brøndby fans recorded by Broudie at Anfield during a UEFA Cup tie in October 1995.

==Themes==
The song title refers to the three lions on the England team crest. The chorus lyric, &quot;it&#x27;s coming home&quot;, reflected the fact that Euro 1996 was the first football competition England had hosted since the 1966 FIFA World Cup but has evolved to include the concept of the cup returning to the homeland of the sport. The song makes references to several players: Bobby Moore, Bobby Charlton, Nobby Stiles and Gordon Banks, who played in the 1966 World Cup winning team.

Among the references in the song are:
*&quot;That tackle by Moore&quot;: Bobby Moore&#x27;s tackle of Jairzinho in a group match against Brazil at the 1970 FIFA World Cup.
*&quot;When Lineker scored&quot;: Gary Lineker&#x27;s goal against West Germany in a semi-final at the 1990 FIFA World Cup.
*&quot;Bobby belting the ball&quot;: Bobby Charlton&#x27;s goal against Mexico in a group match at the 1966 FIFA World Cup.
*&quot;Nobby dancing&quot;: Nobby Stiles dancing with the Jules Rimet Trophy after England won the 1966 FIFA World Cup.

Unlike those of most football songs, the lyrics speak not of unbounded optimism for victory but instead of how, since England&#x27;s victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, every tournament has ended in dashed hopes. However, the failures have not dampened the feeling that England could succeed again (&quot;Three lions on a shirt / Jules Rimet still gleaming / Thirty years of hurt / never stopped me dreaming&quot;). Baddiel said the song was &quot;really about magical thinking. About assuming we are going to lose, reasonably, based on experience, but hoping that somehow we won&#x27;t.&quot;

Despite the failures of the past, each tournament is greeted with fresh hopes that this might be the year they do it again: &quot;I know that was then, but it could be again&quot;, and the song&#x27;s chorus proclaimed that &quot;It&#x27;s coming home, it&#x27;s coming home, it&#x27;s coming, football&#x27;s coming home&quot; which refers, like the tournament&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Football comes home&quot;, to the invention of the modern game in England. Following England&#x27;s success at the 2022 Women&#x27;s Euro, Baddiel said: &quot;I&#x27;m very happy to think the song would, in a way, be put to bed.&quot;

==Critical reception==
Mark Roland from &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote, &quot;It has been left to Ian Broudie to come up with a curiously Slade-esque theme to celebrate the impending Championships. Once you have heard it a couple of time, you&#x27;ll want to mace anyone who sings it.&quot; In December 1996, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; ranked &quot;Three Lions&quot; number 44 in their list of &quot;Singles of the Year&quot;, adding, &quot;The best footie anthem of all time, and you know it. Buoyant, blissful and brilliant, until that irritating bit at the end.&quot; The song has been criticised for being arrogant.

==Commercial reception==
The Britpop phenomenon was at its peak in 1996, and the Lightning Seeds were one of its leading acts, so their involvement gave the song very wide appeal. It reached number one on the singles chart, and as England progressed to the semi-finals, stadiums around the country echoed to the sound of fans singing the song after English victories over Scotland, the Netherlands and Spain. It was so popular that even other teams liked it. England faced Germany in the semi-finals, and Jürgen Klinsmann said later that the Germans were singing the song themselves on the way to the stadium, and the German team and the crowd sang the song as they paraded the trophy on the Römer balcony in Frankfurt. The single as a result reached number 49 on the German Singles Chart. Broudie said he was shocked to hear German fans singing the song after beating England at Euro 96. The song was later sung by Germany fans during their team&#x27;s first appearance at the new Wembley in 2007. 

The original version still receives regular airplay in England around the time of major international football tournaments. It has been adopted as a terrace chant and is occasionally sung by fans at England international matches today. When it was sung by England fans at the 2006 World Cup after England took the lead against Paraguay, commentator John Motson remarked, &quot;As football songs go, &#x27;Three Lions&#x27; is certainly the best&quot;. The song has sold 1.6 million copies in the UK as of June 2018.

The song reached number one on the UK Singles Chart again in 2018 following England reaching the semi-finals of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, with the line &quot;it&#x27;s coming home&quot; featuring heavily on social media. In doing so, it became the first song in history to have four separate stints at number one in the UK. By the following week, following England&#x27;s semi-final defeat by Croatia, and elimination from the tournament, the single had fallen to number 97, setting what was at the time a record for the fastest ever descent from the top of the charts.

==Music video==
Pedro Romhanyi directed the music video for the original &quot;Three Lions&quot;. Romhanyi said that while Skinner and Baddiel are comedians, they took the recording seriously, as &quot;this is not about making a pop video; it&#x27;s about doing something that&#x27;s good for football.&quot; Baddiel recalled that Romhanyi insisted that the music video feel &quot;homely&quot;, opening with Skinner and Baddiel making tea while watching television at home.

The video also features much archival footage and images of the referenced 1966 and later teams featuring for example, Bobby Moore, Nobby Stiles, and Gary Lineker. The contemporary pub scene was filmed at The Queen of the Isle in London, which was demolished in 2004. The pub scene includes a cameo appearance by 1966 team member Geoff Hurst, who was the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final.

==&quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot;==
England lost in a penalty shootout against Germany in 1996, so the song&#x27;s lyrics rang true once again. It was subsequently re-recorded with different lyrics (under the title &quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot;) as an unofficial anthem for England&#x27;s 1998 World Cup campaign (unlike in 1996, when it was the &quot;official song of the England football team&quot;) and landed the number-one spot in the singles chart for a second time, beating the official England song &quot;(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World?&quot; by England United to the top spot by eight places.

This version of the song begins with the sound of stadium crowds singing the original chorus. It then samples Jonathan Pearce&#x27;s commentary of the decisive penalty miss by England&#x27;s Gareth Southgate in a shoot-out with Germany, where England were eliminated at the semi-final stage. Pearce&#x27;s commentary of earlier rounds of the tournament was also used later in the song.

While the 1996 &quot;Three Lions&quot; song drew on various memorable moments from the previous 30 years, the 1998 version reflected on the Euro 96 tournament and its entry alongside previous disappointments, as well as the team&#x27;s performance in qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. The verse mentioning specific players focused this time on the then-current England squad:

* Paul Ince – &quot;Ince ready for war&quot; – his performance against Italy in a crucial qualifier for that year&#x27;s World Cup
* Paul Gascoigne – &quot;Gazza good as before&quot; – the long-awaited return of his 1990 World Cup form in Euro 96, particularly his goal against Scotland
* Alan Shearer – &quot;Shearer certain to score&quot; – with five goals, he had been the top scorer of Euro 96, despite a poor run of form in internationals before the tournament
* Stuart Pearce – &quot;And Psycho screaming&quot; – his primal celebration after scoring a penalty in the Euro 96 quarter-final shoot-out against Spain, which lifted the burden he had felt after failing to score in the semi-final shootout at the 1990 World Cup

Amid much controversy, neither Gascoigne nor Pearce were selected for England&#x27;s 1998 World Cup squad, which was not announced until some time after the song had been recorded.

As well as a karaoke version of the new song, the single featured a song called &quot;Tout est Possible&quot; (French for &quot;Anything is Possible&quot;) as a B-side. The song was largely composed of a recurring chorus, samples from commentators and pundits, and the occasional short verse. It also started with a French speech sample referring to &quot;La Coupe du Monde&quot; (The World Cup).

===1998 video===
There was also a completely new video made for the 1998 version of the song again directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The storyline is different as the trio are now travelling on a motor coach to France with a group of England fans for the 1998 World Cup. The video later portrays a match between the English fans and their German equivalents, most of whom have the name &quot;Kuntz&quot; printed on the back of their football shirts (except for one, who instead has &quot;Klinsmann&quot;). German player Stefan Kuntz had played an instrumental part in Germany&#x27;s semi-final victory over England at Wembley in 1996, but his name is similar to the disparaging vulgarity &quot;cunts&quot;; the segment was often cut by broadcasters. Baddiel and Skinner had previously mocked Kuntz&#x27;s name on their &quot;Fantasy Football&quot; television programme.

The video also featured cameo appearances from Geoff Hurst (who also made a cameo in the music video for the original song in 1996), John Regis, Robbie Williams and Chris Evans. The archival footage was also updated.

== &quot;Three Lions 2010&quot; by the Squad==
Although Frank Skinner had dismissed the possibility in early 2010, Skinner, Baddiel and Broudie were joined by Robbie Williams and comedian/actor Russell Brand under the name the Squad for a new version of the song for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, produced by Trevor Horn. The song features added vocals from the ACM Gospel Choir, a soprano (Olivia Safe) and commentator John Motson. It entered the UK Singles Chart at number 21. The song can be found on &quot;England The Album 2010&quot;.

==&quot;Three Lions (Lionesses Version)&quot;==
In summer 2022, the song was rewritten slightly as England hosted UEFA Women&#x27;s Euro 2022 and the England women&#x27;s team made the final against Germany, which they won 2–1 in extra time to win the Lionesses&#x27; first major trophy and England&#x27;s first major football trophy (men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s) since the 1966 World Cup. The Lightning Seeds and Baddiel performed the new version with Chelcee Grimes and retired Lionesses Fara Williams, Rachel Yankey, Faye White, Rachel Brown-Finnis and Anita Asante at the Electric Ballroom in Camden with Skinner in attendance. This time, references were to current England women&#x27;s players:

* Ellen White – &quot;Ellen White standing tall&quot; – she scored two goals at what was eventually her final international tournament, having already become England&#x27;s all-time female leading goalscorer before the tournament.
* Alessia Russo – &quot;Russo&#x27;s ready to score&quot; – she scored four goals in the tournament, including a backheel goal in the semi-final against Sweden at Bramall Lane that went between Swedish goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl&#x27;s legs and became a FIFA Puskás Award nominee.
* Georgia Stanway – &quot;Stanway kicking the ball&quot; – she scored the winning goal in the quarter-final against Spain at Falmer Stadium in extra time with a shot from outside the box.
* Beth Mead – &quot;And Beth Mead screaming&quot; – she was named both player of the tournament and top scorer with six goals and five assists and later went on to become the first female footballer to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award.

Two other verses were added: &quot;Now is the time, the Lionesses can shine…&quot; and &quot;Lionesses roar, a squad we can believe in / This England team has soared, no more need for dreaming.&quot;

In a further reference to the song, at full time in extra time of the final, commentator Vicki Sparks exclaimed on BBC Radio 5 Live&#x27;s radio call, &quot;No more years of hurt! No more need for dreaming, because dreams have become reality at Wembley!&quot; before the song began playing over the Wembley speakers.

==&quot;Three Lions (It&#x27;s Coming Home for Christmas)&quot;==

In October 2022, Skinner and Broudie confirmed that a new version of the song would be released in time for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The singer noted that the Lionesses&#x27; Euro 2022 win made him consider remaking the song, noting that the track might be Christmas-themed due to the World Cup&#x27;s close proximity to Christmas.

On 18 November 2022, Baddiel, Skinner and The Lightning Seeds released the song, titled &quot;Three Lions (It&#x27;s Coming Home for Christmas)&quot;. Skinner explained that they re-recorded it to take advantage of the &quot;tacky&quot; novelty of a Christmas-themed football song, stating that &quot;in maths two negatives make a positive, so we think there&#x27;s so much tacky in this that it&#x27;s going to be a classic.&quot; The rewritten lyrics mention the England women&#x27;s team winning the Women&#x27;s Euros in July, updating the original&#x27;s &quot;30 years of hurt&quot; to be &quot;56 years of hurt, for the men&#x27;s game&quot; and adding &quot;20 weeks of hurt, for the women&#x27;s game, obviously&quot;, though the women&#x27;s team had played several matches during those weeks and ended the year unbeaten. Baddiel and Skinner also make fun of the song itself, singing &quot;a football Christmas song, not at all demeaning&quot;. Other lyrics include criticism of the choice to host in Qatar, though also the ironic suggestion that the men&#x27;s team may be more successful playing in a different month, and the deliberate pronunciation of &quot;Jules&quot; (as in Jules Rimet Trophy) as the similar &quot;&quot;.

An accompanying music video was released, combining the original music video with modern footage. Baddiel and Skinner visit their past selves and prepare for Christmas. The archive footage of the original music video is replaced with footage of the women&#x27;s team memorably interrupting manager Sarina Wiegman&#x27;s post-Euro final press conference to sing and dance to the original song, and of the men&#x27;s team playing in the Euro 2020 final and their reactions to losing. Geoff Hurst made a cameo, as he had in the original, now dressed as Father Christmas and joined by female Euro-winning players Bethany England and Jess Carter.

==Re-issues==
&quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot; was re-released for the World Cup in 2002, and again on 5 June 2006 for the World Cup 2006 in Germany. It charted at number nine on the UK Singles Chart in 2006. The 2006 re-release was a DualDisc version with both the original version of &quot;Three Lions&quot; and &quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot; on the CD side and the music videos for the two songs on the DVD side. In 2021, Sony re-issued the two versions on a seven-inch vinyl as &quot;3 Lions: Football&#x27;s Coming Home - 25th Anniversary Edition&quot;, with &quot;Three Lions&quot; on one side listed as The First Half (rather than the A-side) and &quot;3 Lions &#x27;98&quot; on the other side, listed as The Second Half (rather than the B-side or double A-side).

==Covers and other uses==
In autumn of 1996, Labour opposition leader Tony Blair addressed his party&#x27;s conference with the quote &quot;Seventeen years of hurt, never stopped us dreaming, Labour&#x27;s coming home&quot;, a play on words from the song&#x27;s chorus and in reference to his confidence that Labour would return to power at the forthcoming general election, having been in the opposition since the Conservatives ousted them from government in 1979. When the election was held on 1 May 1997, Labour won by a landslide.

In 2016, a parody of the song, &quot;Britain&#x27;s Coming Home&quot;, was released in support of Brexit by UKIP member Mandy Boylett. Lyrics included &quot;We&#x27;re coming out, we&#x27;re voting Leave... Believe in Britain coming home.&quot; and &quot;They’ve taken all our fish and money through the years&quot;. The song went viral and became the target of public ridicule, though David Baddiel praised the song as &quot;brilliantly naff&quot;.

In summer 2018, the song enjoyed a renaissance due to the England national team&#x27;s performance in the 2018 FIFA World Cup, in which they reached the semi-finals, and this caused the song to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart. After Croatia eliminated England in the World Cup semi-final, Croatia&#x27;s captain Luka Modrić said that his team had taken the song&#x27;s refrain as disrespect which had additionally motivated them to win the match. In response, England manager Gareth Southgate among others stated the Croats misunderstand English humour.

In addition, the Barmy Army group of England cricket supporters adapted the song into &quot;Three Lions and a Crown&quot; ahead of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, which England hosted and eventually won for their first ODI (50-over) World Cup championship.

During England&#x27;s semifinal run at the 2018 World Cup in Russia, England supporters adapted the chorus of girl group Atomic Kitten&#x27;s &quot;Whole Again&quot; into a chant that referenced &quot;Three Lions&quot; in honor of Gareth Southgate, who had become manager. Specifically, the chorus lines &quot;Baby, you&#x27;re the one / You still turn me on / You can make me whole again&quot; were changed to &quot;Southgate, you&#x27;re the one / You still turn me on / Football&#x27;s coming home again&quot;. Before England&#x27;s quarterfinal against Sweden, group member Natasha Hamilton shared a video of herself on Twitter singing the alternate lyrics. On 3 July 2021 during UEFA Euro 2020, Hamilton and fellow member Liz McClarnon then returned to perform the song with reworked lyrics including the existing alternate ones in front of chanting football fans at a watch party at Boxpark Croydon for England&#x27;s quarterfinal against Ukraine. On 6 July 2021, the day before England&#x27;s semi-final against Denmark, the group – including Jenny Frost, who rejoined following a 13-year break to re-record – released an official full-length version of the adapted song called &quot;Southgate You&#x27;re the One (Football&#x27;s Coming Home Again)&quot; via Columbia Records UK.

<doc id="923926" wikidata="Q138726" url="?curid=923926" title="Ceratomia catalpae">
<text>Ceratomia catalpae, the catalpa sphinx, is a hawk moth of the family Sphingidae. The species was first described by Jean Baptiste Boisduval in 1875. Other common names are the Catawba worm, or Catalpa sphinx.

==Range==
&quot;Ceratomia catalpae&quot; is a native of southeastern North America and can be located on catalpa trees that grow within this region. It can be found from Maine, west to Iowa, south to Florida, the Gulf States and Texas.

==Life cycle==

From oviposition of the eggs to pupation, about four weeks will pass. Where multiple broods occur, pupae will eclose in two weeks, or when conditions are suitable. Adult &quot;C. catalpae&quot; do not reflect the wonderful colors of their larvae. They are a dull brown color lacking the show-off appearance of its larval stages.

===Egg===
Translucent, milky-white, green, or yellowish eggs are oval, being about 0.5 mm in diameter. Eggs are deposited in masses of 100-1000 eggs on the undersurface of leaves, while smaller masses are deposited onto branches on the catalpa tree. Eggs incubate and hatch five to seven days after oviposition.

===Larva===
The larval stage of &quot;C. catalpae&quot; is known as the catalpa or catawba worm. When first hatching, the larvae are very pale, but become darker toward the last instars. The yellow caterpillars will usually have a dark, black stripe down their back along with black dots along their sides. There is also a &quot;pale&quot; phase where the black striping is not as prevalent or missing altogether and a shade of white has replaced it. They grow to a length of about and feed on the leaves of the northern catalpa and, more commonly, the southern catalpa, also known as catawba or Indian bean trees. They are highly desired by fishermen as bait.

===Pupa===
Like most other Sphingidae, &quot;Ceratomia catalpae&quot; will burrow into the ground after its fifth and final instar in order to pupate. The larvae will go into a &quot;wandering&quot; stage where it leaves the catalpa tree and climbs to the ground to find a place to bury itself so that it may pupate. The larvae will then shed its fifth instar skin to reveal its pupal skin, which will be soft and almost translucent at first, but will then harden to a light brown for protection from the elements.

===Adult===
The adult catalpa sphinx is brown with a circular band of dark brown or black surrounding its thorax. Each forewing has a small, dark mark towards the middle, with a white dot in the cell. The body is approximately 30 mm long. The wingspan is 65–95 mm.
===Images of life cycle===
==Food plants==
&quot;C. catalpae&quot; can be quite harmful to the catalpa tree during large outbreaks. The first trial of aerial crop dusting was an attempt to control the catalpa sphinx. However, more recent research may indicate the caterpillars are not as harmful as once thought. The research of Stephen L. Peele, curator of the Florida Mycology Research Center, indicates that catalpa trees might be completely defoliated multiple times during a single summer yet still survive and return to full health, a process which, Peele says, no other tree could survive. &quot;They always come back. They always look healthy,&quot; says Peele. &quot;I have tried to understand the possible symbiotic relationship between the worm and the tree. There surely must be one.&quot;

*&quot;Catalpa speciosa&quot;, (northern catalpa)

==Human use==
&quot;C. catalpae&quot; caterpillars are used as fishing baits to catch bass, bream, and catfish.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 25 May 1977. The Labour Party remained the largest party, winning 53 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. Following the election, it took 208 days of negotiations to form a new government. This was a European record for longest government formation that stood until after the 2010 Belgian general election. The Christian Democratic Appeal was formed by the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), Christian Historical Union (CHU) and the Catholic People&#x27;s Party (KVP) in 1976. The first joint party leader was a member of the KVP, Dries van Agt.

Eventually a coalition was formed between the Christian Democratic Appeal and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy with Dries van Agt as Prime Minister.

<doc id="923935" wikidata="Q2565098" url="?curid=923935" title="Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)">
<text>Queen Charlotte Sound () is a sound of the Pacific Ocean in British Columbia, Canada, between Vancouver Island in the south and Haida Gwaii in the north. It merges with Hecate Strait in the north and Queen Charlotte Strait in the south. 

Queen Charlotte Sound is part of the Inside Passage shipping route. 

Queen Charlotte Sound is part of the Haíɫzaqv Nation territory also known as the Heiltsuk Nation. 

==Definition==
According to the BCGNIS, the northern boundary of Queen Charlotte Sound is defined as a line running from the southernmost point of Price Island to Cape St James on Kunghit Island, the southernmost point of Haida Gwaii. The western boundary is a line from Cape St James to Cape Scott at the north end of Vancouver Island. The southern boundary runs along the coast of Vancouver Island from Cape Scott to Cape Sutil, then to Cape Caution on the mainland. An older definition placed the northern boundary as a line from the southernmost point of Aristazabal Island to Cape St James.

==History==
Queen Charlotte Sound was named by James Strange on August 5, 1786, in honour of the British queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. Strange was the leader of a fur trading expedition of two vessels, &quot;Captain Cook&quot;, under Captain Henry Lawrie, and &quot;Experiment&quot;, under Captain John Guise. During a boat excursion up Goletas Channel Strange saw an opening ahead and named it Queen Charlotte Sound. The body of water he named was what is today known as Queen Charlotte Strait. For some time Queen Charlotte Strait was also called Queen Charlotte Sound, until 1920 when the BCGNIS and Hydrographic Service distinguished between Queen Charlotte Sound and Queen Charlotte Strait. George Vancouver, who used the name in his maps and writings, wrote that the sound was named by Mr. S. Wedgeborough, in command of the &quot;Experiment&quot; under James Strange, but Vancouver was wrong—Strange was the one who gave the name.

<doc id="923946" wikidata="Q3492347" url="?curid=923946" title="Southwest (Washington, D.C.)">
<text>Southwest (SW or S.W.) is the southwestern quadrant of Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States, and is located south of the National Mall and west of South Capitol Street. It is the smallest quadrant of the city, and contains a small number of named neighborhoods and districts, including Bellevue, Southwest Federal Center, the Southwest Waterfront, Buzzard Point, and the military installation known as Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling.

==Geography==
Southwest has the following districts and neighborhoods:
*the Southwest Federal Center, also called the Southwest Employment District, is the area between the National Mall and the Southeast/Southwest Freeway (Interstate 395).
**Southwest Federal Center contains the Smithsonian Institution museums along the south side of the Mall—including the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, the National Museum of African Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the National Air and Space Museum, the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and the National Museum of the American Indian—as well as the United States Botanical Gardens, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and a large concentration of federal executive branch office buildings for departments as well the House office buildings;
**Southwest Federal Center is in Ward 2.
*the Southwest Waterfront, also called Near Southwest, is between I-395 and Fort Lesley J. McNair. 
**Southwest Waterfront is a primarily residential neighborhood. It also is home to several Washington DC marinas, including the Washington Marina, The Capitol Yacht Club, the Gangplank Marina, and the James Creek Marina.
**It is also home to the Maine Avenue Fish Market, Arena Stage, the Washington Marina, Fort McNair, and Hains Point; East and West Potomac Park, a conjunction of two national parks between I-395 and the National Mall that contain the Tidal Basin, the Jefferson Memorial, and the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial (West Potomac Park continues into Northwest and includes the Lincoln Memorial and World War II Memorial, both of which straddle the Southwest/Northwest boundary);
**Southwest Waterfront is in Ward 6, except for the unpopulated East and West Potomac Parks, which are in Ward 2.
*Buzzard Point, a largely under-developed industrial area between South Capitol Street and Fort McNair.
**Buzzard Point contains Audi Field, home of local MLS team D.C. United, winner of 4 MLS Cups. It is also home to the Matthew A. Henson Earth Conservation Center. Prior to 2013, Buzzard Point was the home of the U.S. Coast Guard, which was headquartered in a building at the confluence of the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers. The headquarters then moved to the former St. Elizabeths Hospital campus in Southeast Washington near Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling to a building renamed the Douglas A. Munro Coast Guard Headquarters Building.
*the area of Southwest that is south and east of the Anacostia River contains Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling together with the Naval Research Laboratory and the Blue Plains Advanced Wastewater Treatment Plant, Job Corps Center, and Fire Department Training Center.
**Bolling is in Ward 8.
*the Bellevue neighborhood occupies all of the Southwest land between South Capitol Street (to the east) and the Anacostia and Potomac rivers (to the west and north). Included is the small Hadley Hospital. 
**Bellevue is in Ward 8.

===Transportation===
The Blue, Orange, and Silver lines of the Washington Metro have the following stations in the Southwest Federal Center: Smithsonian, L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, and Federal Center SW.

The Green line has a stop in the Southwest Federal Center at L&#x27;Enfant Plaza and in the Southwest Waterfront at Waterfront; additionally, the Navy Yard – Ballpark stop is one block outside the eastern boundary of the Southwest Waterfront neighborhood.

==History==
===Before 1950===
Southwest is part of Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s original city plans and includes some of the oldest buildings in the city, including the Wheat Row block of townhouses, built in 1793, and Fort McNair, which was established in 1791 as &quot;the U.S. Arsenal at Greenleaf Point.&quot;

Before 1847, much of the Virginia portion of the District of Columbia, including the town of Alexandria, was included in Southwest.

After the Civil War, the Southwest Waterfront became a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians. The neighborhood was divided in half by Fourth Street SW, then known as 4 Street; Scotch, Irish, German, and eastern European immigrants lived west of 4 Street, while freed blacks lived to the east. Each half was centered on religious establishments: St. Dominic&#x27;s Catholic Church and Talmud Torah Congregation on the west, and Friendship Baptist Church on the east. (Also, each half of the neighborhood was the childhood home of a future American musical star — the first home of Al Jolson, whose father was the cantor of Talmud Torah Congregation, after his family emigrated from what is now Lithuania was on 4 Street, and Marvin Gaye was born in a tenement on First Street.)

Waterfront developed into a quite contradictory area: it had a thriving commercial district with grocery stores, shops, a movie theater, as well as a few large and elaborate houses (mostly owned by wealthy blacks). However, most of the neighborhood was a very poor shantytown of tenements, shacks, and even tents. These places, some of them in the shadow of the Capitol Building, were frequent subjects of photographs highlighting the stark contrast.

===1950s rebuilding===
In the 1950s, city planners working with the U.S. Congress decided that Southwest should undergo a significant urban renewal — in this case, meaning that the city would declare eminent domain over all land south of the National Mall and north of the Anacostia River (except Fort McNair); evict virtually all of its residents and businesses; destroy all streets, buildings, and landscapes; and start again from scratch. The seizure of the entire area, including well maintained properties, was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Berman v. Parker&quot;. Justice William Douglas emphasized the squalor and segregation the area suffered, noting that the area was 98% black while 58% of dwellings had outside toilets.

Only a few buildings were left intact, notably the Maine Avenue fish market, the Wheat Row townhouses, the Thomas Law House, and the St. Dominic&#x27;s and Friendship churches. The Southeast/Southwest Freeway was constructed where F Street, SW, had once been.

The rebuilt Southwest featured a large concentration of office and residential buildings in the brutalist style that was then popular. It was during this time that most of the Southwest Federal Center was built. The heart of the urban renewal of the Southwest Waterfront was Waterside Mall, a small shopping center and office complex, which housed satellite offices for the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The Arena Stage was built a block west of the Mall, and a number of hotels and restaurants were built on the riverfront to attract tourists. Southeastern University, a very small college that had been chartered in 1937, also established itself as an important institution in the area. Following a proposal by Chloethiel Woodard Smith and Louis Justement, renewal in Southwest marked one of the last great efforts of the late Modernist movement. Architect I. M. Pei developed the initial urban renewal plan and was responsible for the design of multiple buildings, including those comprising L’Enfant Plaza and two clusters of apartment buildings located on the north side of M St. SW, initially called Town Center Plaza). Various firms oversaw individual projects and many of these represent significant architectural contributions. Modernist Charles M. Goodman designed the River Park Mutual Homes complex. Likewise, Harry Weese designed the new building for Arena Stage and Marcel Breuer the Robert C. Weaver Federal Building, located at 451 Seventh Street, SW, to house the newly established U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Hubert H. Humphrey Federal Building. The Tiber Island complex, which was designed as a replica of the adjacent Carollsburg Condominium and Carrollsburg Square, were designed by Keyes, Lethbridge &amp; Condon, and won an American Institute of Architects award in 1966.

However, urban renewal did not fully succeed in Southwest for many of the reasons that plagued other Modernist renewal efforts. Areas of the neighborhood remained run-down, low-income, and somewhat dangerous. This situation intensified in the 1980s and the 1990s, when Washington had among the lowest per capita incomes and highest crime rates in the nation. The Southwest urban renewal has been called &quot;a case study of everything urban renewal got wrong about cities and people.&quot;

===Recent redevelopment===
While many of the residential neighborhoods of Southwest remained both highly mixed-race and mixed-income, around 2003, the wave of new development occurring throughout D.C. reached Southwest including a number of apartment building renovations and condominium conversions. Nationals Park stadium, located on the east side of South Capitol Street and thus in Southeast, opened for the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team in 2008, construction having cost more than $611 million. As part of the Capitol Riverfront revitalization efforts, high rise office buildings and condominiums have been constructed. Developers have created a waterfront greenspace The Yards, and a waterfront bike trail is planned. Public Housing projects continue to occupy the area between the Waterfront metro and the Nationals Park stadium.

On April 16, 2010, the new Waterfront Safeway (including a sushi bar). Along Water Street, &quot;The Wharf&quot; includes restaurants, shopping, theaters, public piers, hotels, and high-rise housing; the first phase opened in October 2017 (see Redevelopment of Southwest Waterfront) with phase two slated to deliver in early 2022.

L&#x27;Enfant Plaza has also undergone a facelift, with new retail and hotels, as well as office renovations having been completed in the late 2010s. In April 2017, the National Capital Planning Commission (NCPC) approved plans for a staircase and ramp that will travel through a grassy slope in Benjamin Banneker Park to connect L&#x27;Enfant Plaza to the Southwest Waterfront and to add lighting and trees to the area. The NCPC and the National Park Service intended the project to be an interim improvement that could be in place for ten years while the area awaits redevelopment. Hoffman-Madison Waterfront (the developer of &quot;The Wharf&quot;) and the District of Columbia government agreed to invest $4 million in the project in an effort to improve neighborhood connectivity in the area. Construction began on the project in September 2017.

<text>Early general elections were held in the Netherlands on 8 September 1982. The Labour Party emerged as the largest party, winning 47 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives; however, this would be the last time it did so until 1994.

The Centre Party received 0.8% of the vote, winning one seat, which was taken by Hans Janmaat. This was the first time since World War II that a party considered to be right-wing extremist won a seat in the Dutch parliament.

Following the election the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) formed a coalition government with the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy, with the CDA&#x27;s Ruud Lubbers becoming prime minister.

After being selected by Sharon Osbourne to appear at Ozzfest 2001, Otep was signed to a record deal with Capitol Records without a demo in March 2001. Otep released two albums through Capitol, &quot;Sevas Tra&quot; (2002) and &quot;House of Secrets&quot; (2004); both albums were moderate successes, and sold a combined total of 400,000 copies worldwide by 2006. Otep&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Ascension&quot;, was due to be released through Capitol in March 2007, but was delayed indefinitely following the label&#x27;s consolidation into Capitol Music Group two months prior to its planned release date; the band subsequently parted ways with the label, and the album was eventually issued through Koch Records in October of that year.

In February 2009, Otep signed with Victory Records. The band released three albums through the label; &quot;Smash the Control Machine&quot; (2009), which saw a reunion of the band&#x27;s &quot;Sevas Tra&quot; lineup, &quot;Atavist&quot; (2011), and &quot;Hydra&quot; (2013), a concept album. &quot;Hydra&quot; was intended to be the band&#x27;s final album, but thereafter Otep Shamaya opted to continue the band, and they subsequently released two more albums through Napalm Records, &quot;Generation Doom&quot; (2016) and &quot;Kult 45&quot; (2018). Otep&#x27;s ninth and final album, &quot;The God Slayer&quot;, was released through Cleopatra Records on September 15, 2023. Shamaya announced her retirement from music in November 2024, effectively ending the band.

==History==
===Early years, &quot;Jihad&quot; and &quot;Sevas Tra&quot; (2000–2003)===
Otep began as a band in Los Angeles in November 2000. They were invited to play Ozzfest before they had signed to a label after Sharon Osbourne witnessed their fourth live performance. They have since played Ozzfest several times. Otep signed with Capitol Records after four shows and without a demo, purely on the power of their live performance. They started gigging around Los Angeles a lot and released an EP, &quot;Jihad&quot;, in June 2001. After performing at Ozzfest, Marsh and Aguilera were fired, with both guitarists being replaced by Rob Patterson for the rest of the tours that year.

The band released their album &quot;Sevas Tra&quot; with Terry Date on June 18, 2002, and then played several gigs at the Ozzfest and was considered one of the prime bands there in 2002. Their first time at Ozzfest was in 2001 with their eighth gig. The first album peaked at 145 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 86 on the UK Albums Chart.

===&quot;House of Secrets&quot; (2004–2006)===
On July 27, 2004, Otep released their second album, &quot;House of Secrets&quot;, produced by Greg Wells. The album peaked at 93 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 102 on the French Chart.

===&quot;The Ascension&quot; (2007–2008)===
After three years of touring, the band created a third album &quot;The Ascension&quot;, with a scheduled release date of March 20, 2007. In preparation of its original release, they toured with Static-X starting in the spring of 2007.

However, the album was delayed indefinitely due to the Capitol Music Group merger in January 2007. The merger led to the firing of the label&#x27;s president and the band&#x27;s A&amp;R representative from the label, and Otep was left in limbo whether to stay at the label or find a new one; they were eventually dropped from Capitol in May 2007.

In September 2007, the band was able to ink a deal with Koch Records, who belatedly released &quot;The Ascension&quot; in October. Upon its release, It peaked at 81 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 6 on the US Independent Charts. The album sold about 10,200 album copies in its first week of release.

===&quot;Smash the Control Machine&quot; (2009–2010)===

In 2009, Otep signed with Victory Records. Their 2009 album, &quot;Smash the Control Machine&quot;, which was released on August 18, 2009, included a reunion with former members Mark &quot;Moke&quot; Bistany on drums and Rob Patterson on guitar. The album also featured Koichi Fukuda on piano, and Emilie Autumn on violin, and a song co-written with songwriter Holly Knight, which resulted in &quot;UR a WMN NOW&quot;. Knight previously co-wrote &quot;Perfectly Flawed&quot; with Otep on &quot;The Ascension&quot;. It peaked at 47 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 6 on the US Independent Charts.

The band appeared with 2Cents, Five Finger Death Punch and Shadows Fall on the &#x27;Shock &amp; Raw Tour&#x27; of North America in the fall of 2009.

On September 30, 2010, bassist Jay McGuire left the band.

===&quot;Atavist&quot; and &quot;Sounds Like Armageddon&quot; (2011–2012)===
On April 26, 2011, Otep released their fifth studio album, &quot;Atavist&quot;. It peaked at 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, 10 on the Independent Charts and 19 on the US Rock Charts. On November 6, 2012, Otep released their first live album, &quot;Sounds Like Armageddon&quot;.

=== &quot;Hydra&quot; and further activity (2013–2014) ===
In an interview, Otep Shamaya said that &quot;Hydra&quot; will be her band&#x27;s final album. The album was released on January 22, 2013 and peaked at 133 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

The band is still touring and tours the U.S. east coast and Australia for their Sounds of Armageddon tour. In early 2014, Otep confirmed on her personal Facebook account and the band account that another album would be made.

In April 2014, Otep signed a new management deal with Kam 9.8 Machlation Group, a company founded by Slipknot&#x27;s DJ Sid Wilson and his business partner Synonym Mead. The contract with Kam 9.8 was not renewed. In September 2015 Otep announced on her Facebook page that the band had signed a new management deal with Napalm Records, and that a new album would be released in the spring of 2016 (pre-order from winter 2015).

=== &quot;Generation Doom&quot; (2015–2017) ===
&quot;Signing with Napalm Records is one of the most exciting alliances I&#x27;ve ever made. I haven&#x27;t felt this excited to write a new album since &#x27;Sevas Tra.&#x27; There&#x27;s a lot of work to do, a lot of music to write, a lot of things to say, a lot of injustices to confront and a lot of madness to summon and capture. To be able to forge this sacred alchemy with the dark brilliance of producer Howard Benson is a dream come true.&quot;

On February 4, 2016, Otep announced that the album would be titled &quot;Generation Doom&quot; and would be released on April 15. They also released the album art on their Facebook page. On April 11, 2016 &quot;Billboard&quot; was to stream &quot;Generation Doom&quot; in its entirety for 24 hours, but due to its success extended the streaming time to several days.

The music video for the song &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; premiered on April 15, 2016, on Music Choice. On Record Store Day (April 16, 2016), record stores released a picture vinyl disk of &quot;Generation Doom&quot;. On April 20, Napalm Records released the video for &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; on their YouTube page.

&quot;Generation Doom&quot; sold 5,825 copies in its first week of sale in the United States. It was number 3 of the top 8 Napalm Record sellers in the week of April 23. On April 26 the album reached #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Rock Chart, #10 on the Independent Chart and #109 on the Top 200 Albums Chart. On May 7, the album reached #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hard Rock Chart 

=== &quot;Kult 45,&quot; &quot;The God Slayer&quot; and Shamaya&#x27;s retirement (2018–2024) ===
On May 2, 2018, Otep disclosed the album title and artwork for their eighth album, together with disclosing interviews about the content of the album. The official Napalm announcement read: &quot;You can expect a complete and total mutiny of the senses on Kult 45&quot;, says Shamaya. &quot;That said, it&#x27;s important for fans to know that this record is not just an indictment of Trump. The idea is rather to empower people to stand up and remind them this is our country and we have the power. It&#x27;s primarily a rallying cry for people with common sense and good-natured patriots to rise up and know that we own this nation.&quot;

&quot;Although the album is produced well technically, lyrically, it&#x27;s very raw. Musically, we explore different genres - we&#x27;re trying to reach everyone. I don&#x27;t want to be limited to one genre or to be anchored to a particular space where I can only reach certain political minds. It&#x27;s important to me that I&#x27;m sending a clear and concise message to the Resistance - the people out there bending the barricades and fighting for justice is this country.&quot;

Kult 45 was recorded at The Lair in Los Angeles, using exactly the same equipment which was used for Otep&#x27;s first album, Sevas Tra (down to Shamaya&#x27;s vocal microphone, a SHURE Beta 58), in order to create a sound reminiscent of their roots. Kult 45 was self-produced by the band, with assistant engineering from Larry Goetz, Nicolas Schilke, and Lizzy Ostro.
It was also mentioned that the lyrics will tackle subjects like the immigrant crisis, rape culture and the US government.

In an episode of &#x27;Wake and Bake&#x27; (a weekly Facebook live stream on the Otep page) Justin Kier said that while creating this album the band had kept the fans in mind. Therefore, making it an album for the fans, rather than for self-exploration.

The first single of the album, &quot;To the Gallows&quot;, was released on May 25, 2018, along with a lyric video. The album sold 1,850 copies in its first week, and became Otep&#x27;s first studio album not to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

Otep&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;The God Slayer&quot;, was released through Cleopatra Records on September 15, 2023. The album features original material alongside covers of songs by artists including Lil Peep, Olivia Rodrigo, Billie Eilish and Eminem. After its release, Otep Shamaya said that the album will be Otep&#x27;s last, &quot;In symbolic terms, nine is the last single digit. So [&quot;The God Slayer&quot;] is the last; it represents the last. I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;ll make another record&quot;. From April to May 2024, Otep toured with Doyle. In November 2024, she announced her retirement from music and began &quot;liquidating&quot; her collection of musical equipment.

==Musical style and influences==
The band&#x27;s style is primarily nu metal, and is also considered alternative metal. It has also been labelled as gothic metal, rap metal and extreme metal. AllMusic has described Otep as &quot;art house nu-metal&quot;. Otep&#x27;s influences include Slipknot, Slayer, Korn, Rage Against the Machine, The Notorious B.I.G., Nine Inch Nails, Jim Morrison, Tool, the Doors, Nirvana, and Deftones. Although the band&#x27;s style is primarily nu metal, their music incorporates strong elements of death metal.

==Awards==
In 2004, the music video for the single &quot;Warhead&quot; was on the top ten of MTV Headbangers Ball. In 2010, Otep was nominated for a GLAAD Media Award for &quot;Outstanding Music Artist&quot; for the album &quot;Smash the Control Machine&quot; during the 21st GLAAD Media Awards.

Beginning with &quot;The Ascension&quot; and continuing through to &quot;Generation Doom&quot;, Otep has consistently charted high, most often in the top five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hard Rock Chart.

<text>Siren Sundby (born 2 December 1982 in Lørenskog) is a former Norwegian sailor.

She won an Olympic gold medal in the Europe-class in the 2004 Summer Olympics. She also won the world championships in the Europe-class in 2003 and 2004.

Sundby was selected female sailor of the year by the International Sailing Federation in 2003.

Sundby revealed in July 2006 that she was giving up sailing. Since her sailing partner Karianne Melleby became pregnant and gave up sailing, Sundby had been looking for a new partner, but then decided that there was not enough time to prepare with a new partner before the 2008 Summer Olympics, and still have a realistic chance of winning gold.

==Personal life==
Her parents live in Son, south of Oslo. She lives in Oslo with her husband, Christopher Gundersen, who is a sailor. She has a Bachelor of Science in Engineering from Technical University of Denmark, 2008, and is attending her final year of the Master program, Innovation and Entrepreneurship, 2011, at BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo.

The incumbent CDA-VVD coalition maintained exactly the same number of seats as they had achieved at the last general election and continued working together in government with the CDA&#x27;s Ruud Lubbers as Prime Minister.

==Electoral system==
The Dutch parliament was elected using party-list proportional representation with a single nationwide constituency.

<text>The Dixon Entrance () is a strait about long and wide in the Pacific Ocean at the Canada–United States border, between the U.S. state of Alaska and the province of British Columbia in Canada. The Dixon Entrance is part of the Inside Passage shipping route. It forms part of the maritime boundary between the U.S. and Canada, although the location of that boundary here is disputed.

==Etymology==
The strait was named by Joseph Banks for Captain George Dixon, a Royal Navy officer, maritime fur trader, and explorer, who surveyed the area in 1787.

==Geography==
The Dixon Entrance lies between Clarence Strait in the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska to the north, and Hecate Strait and the islands known as Haida Gwaii (the Queen Charlotte Islands) in British Columbia, to the south. Prince of Wales Island is the largest of the Alaskan islands on the north side of the entrance; the Kaigani Haida occupy this island. Members of the Haida nation maintain free access across the strait.

Major inlets that empty into Dixon Entrance include Portland Inlet, Prince Rupert Harbour, and Masset Inlet.

==Boundary dispute==
The &quot;A–B&quot; line (approximately 54°40′ N), which marks the northern boundary of the Dixon Entrance, was delineated by a court of arbitration set up by the 1903 Alaska Boundary Treaty. The meaning of the line remains in dispute between Canada and the United States. Canada claims the line is the international maritime boundary, while the United States holds that its purpose was only to designate the land masses belonging to each country. Hence, the U.S. does not recognize the &quot;A–B&quot; line as an official boundary (to govern, for example, seafloor resources or fishing rights). In 1977 the U.S. defined a maritime boundary as an equidistant line between land masses.

The two differing boundary lines intersect to create four separate water areas with different claim status. The two areas south of the &quot;A–B&quot; line (about 2789 km2 and 51.5 km2 in size) are claimed by both countries. The other two water areas are north of the &quot;A–B&quot; line and are not claimed by either country. The two unclaimed areas are about 72 km2 and 1.4 km2 in size.

In addition, Nunez Rocks is a low-tide elevation (LTE) (&quot;bare at half-tide&quot;) that lies south of the &quot;A–B&quot; Line, surrounded by the sea territory claimed by the U.S. The United States has not ratified the Law of the Sea Treaty, although it adheres to most of its principles as customary international law. Under the treaty, LTEs may be used as basepoints for a territorial sea, and the U.S. uses Nunez Rocks as a basepoint. As a non-signatory, however, there is nothing preventing the U.S. from claiming areas beyond the scope of the Law of the Sea Treaty. The fact remains that, for about half of each day, above-water territory that Canada regards as Canadian is surrounded by sea territory that the U.S. has declared to be American.

Territorial fishing disputes between the countries remain today, as the United States has never shown the &quot;A–B&quot; line as an official boundary on its government maps.

<doc id="923969" wikidata="Q1592911" url="?curid=923969" title="Hecate Strait">
<text>Hecate Strait (; Haida language: &quot;K̲andaliig̲wii&quot;, also &quot;siigaay&quot; which means simply &quot;ocean&quot;) is a wide but shallow strait between Haida Gwaii and the mainland of British Columbia, Canada. It merges with Queen Charlotte Sound to the south and Dixon Entrance to the north. About wide at its southern end, Hecate Strait narrows in the north to about . It is about in length.

==Definition==
According to the BCGNIS, the southern boundary of Hecate Strait is defined as a line running from the southernmost point of Price Island to Cape St James on Kunghit Island, the southernmost point of Haida Gwaii. The northern boundary is a line from Rose Point, the northeastern tip of Graham Island, to Hooper Point at the north end of Stephens Island off the mainland.

==History==
Because it is so shallow, Hecate Strait is especially susceptible to storms and violent weather. The Haida of Haida Gwaii crossed the Hecate Strait to the mainland to plunder coastal villages to take slaves and booty. Sometimes mainland First Nations crossed Hecate Strait to Haida Gwaii, such as a Nisga&#x27;a war party from the lower Nass River, which crossed the strait in a retaliatory raid after an attack by Haida Ravens from Hiellen, which took Nisga&#x27;a slaves back to Hiellen. The inhabitants of Hiellen, fearing a Nisga&#x27;a retaliation, took refuge in Masset. The Nisga&#x27;a found Hiellen abandoned and burned it to the ground. Haida from Masset counterattacked, resulting in a long battle at Hiellen and nearby Taaw Tldáaw. The Nisga&#x27;a survivors crossed Hecate Strait again to return home.

The Strait was first explored for the europeans in 1792 by the spanish Armada explorer Jacinto Caamaño. Hecate Strait was named by Captain George Henry Richards in 1861 or 1862 after his surveying vessel, HMS &quot;Hecate&quot;.

==Geology==
During the last ice age, the seafloor in this area was a wide coastal plain stretching south to the Olympic Peninsula and including what is now Queen Charlotte Sound.

==Flora and fauna==
The strait once contained strong salmon and halibut fisheries.

Hecate Strait is one of the few locations in the world with species from the glass sponge class of fauna. Regions with these sponge are currently protected from damage by commercial fishing.

The Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Area was designated by the Fisheries and Oceans Canada in February 2017. The MPA is located in the Northern Shelf bioregion of the Pacific Region, southeast of Haida Gwaii, North and South of the entrance to the Douglas Channel. The MPA is composed of three individual areas known as the Northern Reef, the Central Reefs, and the Southern Reef. Together these three areas cover approximately 2,410 square kilometers. The four reef complexes in the Hecate Strait and Queen Charlotte Sound discontinuously cover an area of about 1,000 km2, and are located in glacial troughs between 140 m and 240 m deep.

<text>The 63rd Infantry Division (&quot;Blood and Fire&quot;) was an infantry division of the Seventh Army of the U.S. Sixth Army Group of the Army of the United States that fought in Europe during World War II. After the war it was inactivated, but later the division number and shoulder sleeve insignia were authorized for use by the 63rd Army Reserve Command (ARCOM).

The 63rd Regional Support Command is responsible for the base and administrative support of all United States Army Reserve units throughout the seven-state region of southwestern United States including California, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas. Although the 63rd Regional Readiness Command located in Los Alamitos, CA, was not authorized to carry the lineage of the 63rd Infantry Division, the creation of the new 63rd Regional Support Command in Moffett Field, CA, authorizes it to inherit the lineage and the bi-color red and blue background 63rd Infantry Division flag as an exception to policy. The unit was inactivated on 6 December 2009 and replaced by the 79th Sustainment Support Command, and was reactivated as a regional support command.

==World War II==

===Formation and deployment===
The 63rd Infantry Division was activated on 15 June 1943, at Camp Blanding, Florida, using a cadre from the 98th Infantry Division. Shortly thereafter, the division removed to Camp Van Dorn, Mississippi to train for action in Europe. On three occasions during the next seventeen months the division turned recruits into combat teams that were sent overseas as replacement troops. The first elements of the division arrived in Europe in December 1944, were assigned to the Seventh Army of the U.S. Sixth Army Group of the United States Army and deployed in support of the Battle of the Bulge; the balance joined them in France in January 1945.

===In action===
Three regiments of the 63rd Division arrived in Marseille, France, 8 December 1944, trained at Haguenau and, under the designation Task Force Harris, protected the east flank of the Seventh Army along the Rhine River. The task force fought defensively from 22 to 30 December 1944. On 30 December 44, while the 253d Inf Regt was attached to the 44th Inf Division and the 255th Inf Regt was attached to the 100th Inf Division, the 254th Inf Regt was moved to the Colmar area of France where it was attached to the 3d Inf Division which was at the time a part of the First French Army. The infantry regiments remained with their attachments until early February 1945. The rest of the division arrived at Marseilles, 14 January 1945, and moved to Willerwald on 2 February, where it was joined by the advance elements on 6 February. On 7 February, the 63rd conducted local raids and patrols, then pushed forward, crossing the Saar River on 17 February, and mopping up the enemy in the Mühlenwald (Muehlen Woods). After bitter fighting at Güdingen early in March, the division smashed at the Siegfried Line on 15th at Saarbrücken, Germany, taking Ormesheim and finally breaching the line at Sankt Ingbert and Hassel on 20 March. Hard fighting still lay ahead, but the Siegfried Line was Germany&#x27;s last attempt to defend its prewar boundaries along the western front. Before resting on 23 March, the 63d took Spiesen-Elversberg, Neunkirchen and Erbach. On 28 March, the division crossed the Rhine at Worms, moved to Viernheim and occupied Heidelberg on 30 March, establishing its command post there on 1 April. Continuing the advance, the 63rd crossed the Neckar River near Mosbach and the Jagst River on 3 April. The 253rd Infantry Regiment, received the majority of the German resistance during this time at the Battle of Buchhof and Stein am Kocher. Heavy resistance slowed the attack on Bad Wimpfen, Möckmühl, and Adelsheim.

The division switched to the southeast, capturing Lampoldshausen and clearing the Harthäuser Woods on 7 April. A bridgehead was secured over the Kocher River near Weißbach on 8 April, and Schwäbisch Hall fell on 17 April. Advance elements crossed the Rems River and rushed to the Danube. The Danube was crossed on 25 April, and Leipheim fell before the division was withdrawn from the line on 28 April. A final command post was established at Bad Mergentheim on 30 April, 1945, after which the division was assigned security duty from the Rhine to Darmstadt and Würzburg on a line to Stuttgart and Speyer. The 63d began leaving for home on 21 August 1945, and was inactivated on 27 September 1945.

From mid-February 1945 until the end of the war, the 63d Division saw constant combat from Sarreguemines through the Siegfried Line to Worms, Mannheim, Heidelberg, and Gunzburg, with elements ending in Landsberg at the end of April 1945, pulled from the line for a much needed rest.

===War crimes===
On 15 April 1945, American soldiers from the 63rd Infantry Division perpetrated the Jungholzhausen massacre, when they killed between 13 and 30 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; and &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; prisoners of war in Braunsbach.

===ARCOM===
On 1 January 1968, the 63rd Army Reserve Command (ARCOM) was activated and, as an exception to policy, allowed to wear the shoulder sleeve insignia and distinctive unit insignia of the 63rd Infantry Division. The 63rd ARCOM did not, however, perpetuate the lineage and honors of the 63rd Infantry Division, as Department of the Army policy does not authorize TDA units, such as ARCOMs, to inherit the lineage and honors of TO&amp;E units, such as divisions.

Based at Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve Center, the command encompassed Army Reserve units in Southern California, Arizona, and Nevada. From 1990 through 1991, over 2,500 Army Reserve soldiers from the 63rd ARCOM served on active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Twenty-two of the command&#x27;s units were mobilized, with fourteen of them deploying to the Persian Gulf.

In April 1995, the 63rd ARCOM was redesignated as the 63rd Regional Support Command (RSC) (later revised to Regional &quot;Readiness&quot; Command (RRC)), and its geographic boundaries were realigned to coincide with those of Federal Emergency Management Agency Region IX. The 63rd maintained command and control of 14,000 soldiers and 140 units in the states of California, Arizona and Nevada, and assumed additional responsibility to support the major functional reserve commands within its area. The 63rd RRC supported both foreign and domestic active Army missions, including participation in NATO operations in Bosnia and Kosovo. Since 2001, thousands of soldiers from the 63rd RRC have served in Afghanistan and Iraq.

In September 2008, the 63rd and 90th RRCs combined into the 63rd which was redesignated the 63rd RSC again, with its new headquarters at Moffett Field, California. As a key component of the Army Reserve&#x27;s transition to an operational force, the newly formed 63rd RSC has foregone command and control of units in favor of a greatly expanded area of responsibility. The 63rd RSC provides base support and administrative support to over 40,000 Army Reserve soldiers in the southwest United States.

==Insignia==
* Shoulder sleeve insignia:
** Description: On a tear-drop-shaped olive drab background 5.72 cm (2¼ in.) wide and 8.89 cm (3½ in.) long, a scarlet flame of five rays superimposed by an upright gold sword in pale, charged with a scarlet drop of blood.
** Symbolism: The design alludes to the unit&#x27;s motto, &quot;Blood and Fire&quot; (see below).
*** Background: The shoulder sleeve insignia was designed by the division&#x27;s first commander, Brigadier General Louis E. Hibbs. It was originally approved for the 63d Infantry Division on 27 March 1943. It was authorized for the 63d Army Reserve Command on 22 April 1968. It was reassigned and authorized effective 16 April 1996, for the 63d Regional Support Command. The insignia was redesignated effective 16 July 2003, for the 63d Regional Readiness Command. It was redesignated effective 17 September 2008, for the 63d Regional Support Command and amended to add a symbolism.
* Distinctive unit insignia:
** Description: A silver color metal and enamel device, 3.02 cm (1 3/16 in.) in diameter, consisting of a silver chevron on a red background, bearing seven blue wavy vertical bands; in base, a black embattled area with two merlons; encircling all, a continuous silver scroll of four folds inscribed on the upper three folds, &quot;PRIDE&quot; &quot;HONOR&quot; &quot;SERVICE&quot; in black letters. Overall, a yellow vertical sword, the tip charged with a scarlet drop.
** Symbolism: The elements of the design reflect the history of the 63d Infantry Division. The silver chevron simulates a spearhead and is indicative of the aggressiveness displayed by the 63rd Infantry Division during the crossing of seven European rivers—the Saar, Rhine, Neckar, Jagst, Kocker, Rems, and Danube—during World War II. The rivers are represented by the seven blue wavy bands. The breaching of the Siegfried Line at Sankt Ingbert and Hassell is symbolized by the two black merlons of the embattled area, surmounted by the yellow sword with the scarlet drop taken from the shoulder sleeve insignia of the organization.
** Background: The distinctive unit insignia was originally approved for the 63d Army Reserve Command on 8 May 1970. It was reassigned and authorized effective 16 April 1996, for the 63d Regional Support Command. The insignia was redesignated for the 63d Regional Readiness Command effective 16 July 2003. It was redesignated effective 17 September 2008, for the 63d Regional Support Command.
* Motto: &quot;Blood and Fire,&quot; inspired by a quote of British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. At the Casablanca Conference in 1943, shortly before the activation of the 63d Infantry Division, Churchill promised to make the enemy &quot;bleed and burn in expiation of their crimes.&quot; The slogan was adopted by Brigadier General Louis E. Hibbs, the division&#x27;s first commander, who designed the shoulder sleeve insignia.

<text>City of Derry Airport , previously known as RAF Eglinton and Londonderry Eglinton Airport, is a regional airport located northeast of Derry, Northern Ireland. It is located on the south bank of Lough Foyle, a short distance from the village of Eglinton and from the city centre.

The airport, also known locally as Eglinton Airport, has experienced a decline in passenger numbers in recent years partially due to the COVID pandemic and underfunding. In 2023, 154,486 passengers used the airport, having peaked at 438,996 in 2008. The airport is currently a base for the Scottish regional airline Loganair, who operate domestic flights to other parts of the UK. Other airlines who serve the airport include Ryanair, easyJet and Volotea.

==History==
===1945–1989===

The airport has its origins in the Second World War. In 1941, the Royal Air Force (RAF) Eglinton air base was established as the home to No. 133 Squadron RAF which flew Hawker Hurricanes in defence of the city. In 1942 the base was occupied by No. 41 Squadron RAF. In 1943 the airfield became a Fleet Air Arm base called RNAS Eglinton (HMS &quot;Gannet&quot;) and was home to No. 1847 Fleet Air Arm Squadron which provided convoy air cover as part of the Battle of the Atlantic. RNAS Eglinton closed in April 1959 with the remaining squadrons moving to RAF Ballyhalbert, County Down and RAF Ballykelly, County Londonderry.

After the war, the base remained a military establishment until the 1950s when the Ministry of Defence returned much of the land to the original landowners. The original name of the airport was Londonderry Eglinton Airport and it was usually just referred to as &quot;Eglinton&quot;. Some limited commercial activities were undertaken at the airfield during the 1960s when Emerald Airways operated a service to Glasgow. Emerald built a new terminal building and control tower to support services with the first flight to Glasgow operating on 16 September 1967. During most of the 1970s, the only flying at Eglinton was carried out by Eglinton Flying Club which is still based at the airport. In 1978 Londonderry City Council decided to purchase the airfield with a view to improving the transport infrastructure for the northwest of Ireland. The airport has slowly developed since then with private short-haul charters to various destinations within the British Isles, a service which still continues including the recent addition of helicopter pilot training and charter services. Loganair introduced the first scheduled flight between Derry and Glasgow in 1979, a route which was dropped due to rising fuel costs. This route was the only route for ten years until Loganair introduced an additional daily Manchester service in 1989.

===1989–2006===
A major redevelopment programme was undertaken by the council from 1989 to 1993 with grant aid from the European Regional Development Fund. £10.5 million was spent upgrading all of the facilities at the airport including runways, taxiways, access roads, navigation equipment, and runway lighting, as well as a new purpose-built terminal and fire station. The new terminal was officially opened in March 1994. The name of the airport was officially changed from Londonderry Eglinton to the City of Derry Airport by Derry City Council following nationalist support within the newly renamed council. However, as of May 2014, the Aeronautical Information Publication published by the UK&#x27;s air navigation service provider, National Air Traffic Services, still shows Londonderry/Eglinton. At that time there were still only two scheduled routes carrying about 40,000 passengers each year. 1995 saw the arrival of Jersey European Airways who attempted to operate a short-lived shuttle link between Derry and Belfast City Airport.
During 1998 and 1999 safety improvements were undertaken at the airport as a matter of priority. As the airport served Northern Ireland and Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, funding was sourced and thereafter provided by the Irish Government in addition to that provided by the British Government and Derry City Council. These improvements meant that larger aircraft could use the airport, thus, Air 2000 started holiday charter flights, on behalf of Falcon Holidays, in May 1999, followed in July by Ryanair who operated scheduled flights. The Ryanair service to London Stansted grew substantially and the Loganair routes continued to operate until October 2008 as a British Airways franchise, including a sector to Dublin, initiated as a public service obligation route, subsidised by the Irish Government. Soaring fuel costs saw all British Airways operations to Northern Ireland suspended. British Airways has since returned to Northern Ireland by buying British Midland Airways (bmi) and continuing operating the route to London Heathrow Airport from George Best Belfast City Airport.

Aer Arann operated services to Manchester and Birmingham for a short time.

===2006–2011===
In May 2006, the European Commission gave its approval for the British and Irish governments to invest €15 million in the airport. Although this work did not include the lengthening of the single serviceable runway, it included the expansion of the safety zones at each end which would allow jets to land and take off with full passenger capacities. Operators of Boeing 737 jets were previously limited to 80% capacity as a safety feature due to the short length of the runway. Other works included the expansion of the apron immediately in front of the control tower which would allow for the parking of several aircraft at any one time. As a prelude to the expansion at the airport several families were removed from their homes under a Government Compulsory Purchase scheme before the buildings and outbuildings were demolished.

The decrease in operational hours at the airport as a direct consequence of the challenging economic conditions have caused problems for Eglinton Flying Club and the helicopter flight training facility, who in turn have threatened to leave the airport if the decisions are not reversed. They have claimed that this would cost the airport some £250,000 in annual revenue while the owners, Derry City Council, have countered that the decrease in operational hours was necessary as part of the implementation of the £600,000 budget reduction plan.

In January 2009, the council appointed Albert Harrison, the former head of Belfast International Airport, as the new manager of the airport. He had been tasked with turning the loss-making facility around and has been given just six months to implement savings of £600,000 per annum and increase the number of carriers, destinations, and passengers.

The recently completed runway safety zone extension and apron works have allowed the CAA to lift the capacity restriction on aircraft operating out of the airport. This has increased seat availability and passenger throughput at the airport. It also enabled Ryanair to establish their first international route from the airport to Alicante.

In April 2009 the council issued tender documents for a multimillion-pound expansion of the terminal to improve passenger flow and meet current EU customs and immigration regulations. The arrivals hall has recently been improved and tax free shopping, WHSmith and the Amelia Earhart Business lounge in the departure area are open during operational hours.

On 9 October 2009, Derry City Council who own and operate the airport began the process which will lead to the privatisation of the facility. Initially, a holding company will be set up by the council which will own 100% of the shares, thereafter the council intends to do market research to seek the level of interest in private sector investors. As part of the privatisation plan two subsidiaries will be formed that will operate the airport and manage the estate.

In June 2010 it was announced that the Airport was in the final stages of discussion with the Balfour Beatty Group about a management contract, with the objective of bringing additional commercial experience and resources to the Airport for the economic benefit of the region and to reduce the subvention from the City Council.

The Belfast to Derry single-track railway line of Northern Ireland Railways passes close to but not across the tip of the runway at the North Eastern end. Because it is in the Runway End Safety Area, safety systems ensure that no train can pass when aircraft are taking off or landing.

===2011–2022===

Ryanair axed its services to Alicante and Birmingham in 2014, followed by its service to Faro in 2016. In 2017, Ryanair axed its daily service to London Stansted. In response, the airport submitted a public service obligation request to the Department for Transport. The Northern Ireland Executive also agreed a multimillion-pound funding package for the airport. Flybmi commenced operations on the Stansted route in 2017, with 13 weekly flights. These flights operated up until February 2019, when Flybmi ceased operations.

In October 2018, Ryanair replaced its Derry to Glasgow route with a new route to Edinburgh. Following this decision, Loganair resumed operations to Glasgow, having previously operated the route between 1979 and 2007. In 2019 following flybmi&#x27;s collapse Loganair announced they would be taking on the route while adding a new service to Manchester.

Loganair ended flights to Manchester in Early 2020 while also reverting flights back to London Stansted from London Southend after previously being switched in September 2019.

In December 2020, Ryanair was forced to axe all of their flights from the UK to non-EU destinations (including UK Domestic routes) due to a row with the Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom). The CAA required that post-Brexit, all flights originating from the United Kingdom to non-EU-based destinations for airlines with a base airport in the United Kingdom use aircraft with a UK registration (Eg: G-ABCD). Due to this, Ryanair decided to axe these routes saying &quot;The decision to cancel these flights was taken by Ryanair alone. We will continue to engage with the airline on these matters as we seek to act in the best interest of consumers&quot;. The UK regional airline Loganair will launch a route to Liverpool (Ryanair operated from Derry to Liverpool &amp; Edinburgh), replacing the lost Ryanair route, beginning 24 May 2021.

In October 2021 Ryanair announced their return to the airport with a new service to Manchester operating three times a week, which commenced at the beginning of December 2021. Loganair also announced a new route in late October to Edinburgh, this service would launch on the 17th of May 2022, and operates thrice weekly, increasing to five times weekly in the summer.

===2023–present===

Loganair announced they would be ceasing all flights to Edinburgh from City of Derry Airport from January 3, 2023, as a result Loganair stated they would be increasing the frequency of Glasgow flights to daily. In September 2023 Loganair announced they would no longer operate scheduled flights between City of Derry and Liverpool, with regular services halting in October 2023, and only select dates between then and January 2024 available for purchase.

Ski packages for local schools will be launched from the airport in 2024 to Verona. 
As well as religious pilgrimages to Lourdes operated by various charter airlines such as Albastar, Smartwings, Enter Air and Corendon Airlines these flights operate between May and June of each year. 

In summer 2024, seasonal charters by travel solutions, flew a Faro service operated by BA Cityflyer, using their fleet of Embraer E190 Aircraft. This will not operate in 2025 

In January 2024, Ryanair announced they would be launching a new service from Derry to Birmingham twice weekly. It would be the first since a previous Ryanair route connecting Birmingham and Derry was scrapped in 2014.

On 4th November 2024 easyJet began flights to the airport for the very first time, re-establishing routes to Edinburgh and Liverpool twice weekly.

In January 2025, Volotea operated a charter flight to Verona for six weeks commencing 18th January 2025, following the success of its four week charter the previous year.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 24 May 2007, the airport was closed by the Civil Aviation Authority following an inspection. Four days later, after reinspection, the CAA allowed the airport to be reopened. Changes included limiting wild bird populations (by placing nets over nearby culverts and ponds), repairs to the aircraft parking apron, and minor drainage work carried out on the runway. All cancelled airlines, including British Airways and Ryanair, subsequently resumed full services.

<text>Bjelovar (, , Czech: &quot;Bělovar&quot; or &quot;Bělovár,&quot; Kajkavian: &quot;Belovar,&quot; Latin: &quot;Bellovarium&quot;) is a city in central Croatia. In the 2021 census, its population was 36,316 . 
It is the administrative centre of Bjelovar-Bilogora County as well as one of the youngest cities in Croatia, officially founded in the year 1756.

== Name ==
The origin of the modern name &quot;Bjelovar&quot; is a topic of debate; however, a prominent theory posits that the name is derived from the concept of &quot;white land&quot;, a term historically used to describe land that was challenging to cultivate. Older records of names like Belublathya or Bjeloblaće i.e. &quot;white mud&quot;, indicate this possibility.

The name of the city itself consists of the Croatian adjective &#x27;, meaning &quot;white&quot;, added to the Hungarian word &#x27; or &quot;város&quot; which roughly translates to &quot;city&quot; or &quot;fortress&quot;.

=== Name history ===
The name of a settlement similar to Bjelovar is mentioned several times in various historical records. In a letter dating to 13 April 1465, Belovarc (Belowarcz) was mentioned by the bans Emeric Zápolya and Nicholas of Ilok, addressed to the archbishop of Zagreb, about the return of said property, and in the archbishops eply to their letter.

In 1473, in a letter, king Matthias Corvinus gifted the properties of so-called &quot;Belublathy&quot; to several nobles.

In other documents from that period, the names Belowarcz, Beloblatje and Bjeloblaće are mentioned. The same names are also mentioned around the years 1579 to 1611. Where a small fortress or &quot;schloss&quot; was built along the Bjelovacka to defend against oncoming Turkish invasions. This fortress is recorded on various maps as a fortress: Belouac, Belouax and Wellovar.

In 1756, with the establishment of the modern city and its subsequent promotion to the military center of the Varaždin Generalate, which was commanded by barron Philipp Lewin von Beck. Bjelovar was founded and named as Novi Varaždin ( New Varaždin), which the local population did not accept, for which Beck ordered that those who do not accept the name Novi Varaždin be punished.
==Geography==
Bjelovar sits on a plateau in the southern part of the Bilogora a long, low elevation range, with an average height of 150–200 m (highest point: Rajčevica, 309 m). The geology of the area consists of Pliocene sandy marl and sandstones with lesser layers of lignite. Older rocks do not appear on the surface in this area. Deeper down can be found crystalline rocks. The city stands 135 metres above sea level. It is the capital of the Bjelovar-Bilogora county, and the natural, cultural and political centre of the area.

Bjelovar sits at an intersection of roads in this area: the D28 intersects with the D43, and it lies on the road between Zagreb and west Slavonia, Podravina and Osijek. Bjelovar is currently being connected by dual carriageway with Zagreb.

The city of Bjelovar has an area of , and administratively it includes 31 other settlements.

==History==
=== Neolithic and ancient history ===
The oldest Neolithic location in this area is in Ždralovi, a suburb of Bjelovar, where, while building a basement for the house of Josip Horvatić, a dugout was found and identified as belonging to the Starčevo culture (5000 – 4300 BC). Finds from Ždralovi belong to a regional subtype of a late variant of the Neolithic culture. It is designated the Ždralovi &quot;facies&quot; of the Starčevo culture, or the final-stage Starčevo. There are also relics of the Korenovo culture, Sopot culture, Lasinja culture, and the Vučedol culture. as well as the Bronze and Iron Age cultures, found in the wider Bjelovar area.

==== Roman Empire ====
The more intensive development of the area began with the arrival of the Romans, who first came to the area between the Sava and Drava rivers in 229 BC. The intersection of two Roman roads was located exactly at the place where the present-day Bjelovar developed, and in its immediate vicinity was a presumed military camp or station.

With the stabilization of the northern border of the Roman Empire, a collection of settlements probably developed here in the period from II. to IV. century, unrecorded on Roman itineraries, but attested by archaeological remains on today&#x27;s Matošev Square, Stjepan Radić Square and findings in the wider city area, such as the most prominent findings of a Roman rural settlement in the forest and area of Lug.

=== Origin of the city ===
By the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century, many noble and church estates were located within the circle of today&#x27;s Bjelovar, some of them were the settlement Jakobove Sredice, the fort of Gudovačka Gradina and church parishes in today&#x27;s Veliko Korenovo, Međurača and Nova Rača.

With the Turkish invasions in the 16th century today&#x27;s Bjelovar region became a border area and a humanly and materially devastated region that constantly changed hands. The population had dispersed and life had been mostly carried out in small forts along the unstable border with the Ottomans. Only with the establishment of an administrative and military system of defense against the Turks, better known as the Croatian Military Frontier, within which the Bjelovar area was located, did the situation stabilize. In the 17th century Bjelovar is mentioned as a military guardhouse, which indicates that it was already included in the Frontier defense system then. Stabilization of the Habsburg-Ottoman border on the Sava river and the new circumstances of the society in the region during the first half of the 18th century conditioned the territorial and administrative reorganization of the Varaždin Generalate.

The Severin Uprising (also known as the Varaždin rebellion), which took place in 1755 in the immediate vicinity of the future city, pointed to the need for a new command center from which better control of the Krajišan could be projected out. Viennese military strategists decided to establish a new settlement that would take over the function of headquarters of regimental administrations. A location was chosen in the center of the generalate, on the dividing line between the Križevci and Đurđevac regiments.

The foundation and beginning of the construction of Bjelovar dates back to 1756, when the land was purchased and a permit was issued for the purchase of building materials, and the construction was led by Baron Philipp Lewin von Beck. From the very beginning, the city was conceived as the center of the Varaždin Generalate, and in accordance with the military function, the construction of military facilities and the settlement of the military population first began. As well as the resettlement of many Czech and Croatian peasants as workforce on the new fort. The exception is the block on the square where the parish church of St. Teresa of Avila (now the Cathedral of St. Teresa of Avila) and the Piarist monastery and school. Two Piarist monks, brothers Hubert and Ignacije Diviš, came to Bjelovar in 1761 and opened the first public school on the Đurđevac regiment side of town. By the decision of Maria Theresa construction of a new church started, which was completed in 1772, with which the parish of Bjelovar was established, which until 1790 was managed by Piarists. In 1771, Empress Maria Theresa confirmed Bjelovar&#x27;s status as a privileged &quot;Krajina city&quot;, i.e. a military community, which resulted in demographic and significant economic growth. This trend continued at the beginning of the 19th century when the city began to expand beyond its original borders. And with time it became the administrative centre of the Bjelovar-Križevci county.
=== 19th century ===
The then town of Bjelovar was pronounced a free royal town by ban Ivan Mažuranić in 1874 after the conclusions of the Ottoman invasion. Peaceful life and economic boom was interrupted by the beginning of the First World War. As an important military town, Bjelovar made its contribution by recruiting the male population, converting many public buildings into hospitals, using the railway to transport soldiers and the wounded. Consequently, with the war dragging on, the shortage of manpower and natural resources led to a difficult economic situation and a general shortage of food. With the end of the war Bjelovar became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and it retained its status as the administrative centre of the Bjelovar-Križevci county. The Vidovdan Constitution of 1921, and on the basis of the Law on Regional and County Self-Government (1922), the Kingdom of SHS was divided into 33 oblasts, and Bjelovar thereby lost the status of county center and became part of the Osijek Oblast with the status of a district and a city.

Thanks to the economic foundations created in the previous period, based on trade, crafts and industry, the positive economic trend continued until The Great Depression, when the growth of registered merchants, craftsmen and industrialists was still recorded, but with much lower incomes. In the interwar period, the city received some new facilities. The football field of the Bjelovar Academic Sports Club was arranged in the modern-day city quarter of Logorište. Public city pools were also established.
=== 20th century ===
The short-lived period of the Independent State of Croatia during the Second World War stopped the development of the city in all areas. Two days before the official proclamation in Zagreb, on 8 April 1941, from the balcony of the then city hall (now the building of the Bjelovar City Museum), the mayor Dr. Julije Makanec proclaimed the Independent State of Croatia during the event known as the Bjelovar uprising. Within two months, a new territorial-administrative division of the state into 22 parishes followed. During the war, unlike the villages in the immediate vicinity of Bjelovar, the town did not experience severe material destruction. On several occasions, the railway as well as the military bases in the quarter of Vojnović were bombed by Allied forces.

With the end of the war and the arrival of the new socialist government, tendencies towards the modernization of the state and the restoration of the failing industry and communal infrastructure were evident from the very beginning. Housing construction was intensified mainly in the northern part of the city as well as to the south. in 1960 a new post office building was built on the site of the old post office building. In 1955, the Koestlin plant moved from the city core to the industrial zone south of the railway. In addition to Koestlin and the already existing factories of Tomo Vinković, Česma, Tehnogradnja and Elektrometal, new plants were built in the area from the 1960s, while the United Paromlin (later renamed 5 .maj), stayed in its historical location by the old mill, where it was reorganized and built upon.

In addition to demographic and economic growth, the aforementioned built infrastructure contributed to the strengthening of all functions, which turned Bjelovar into one of the most important centers of northwestern Croatia.

=== Bjelovar during and after breakup of Yugoslavia ===

After the first multi-party democratic elections in the SR Croatia held on 22 and 23 April 1990, the newly founded Croatian Democratic Union won power in Bjelovar. After the referendum and the declaration of independence, the crisis worsened and conflicts began. For this reason, on 12 September, the President of the Republic of Croatia, Dr. Franjo Tuđman, made a decision to block all JNA barracks in Croatia and suspend the supply of electricity, water and food to these barracks. After a series of unsuccessful attempts to get the JNA army to peacefully leave the barracks located in the city or in its immediate surroundings, namely the barracks or military facilities in the quarters of Logorište, Vojnović, Zvijerci, the forest of Bedenik (The Barutana depot) and the Preradović barracks on the main city square, known as the Božidar Adžija Barracks.

On the morning of 29 September, ZNG (Zbor narodne garde) and Croatian police attacked the JNA facilities in Bjelovar. In response, Kovačević contacted the JNA 5th Military District in Zagreb and requested airstrikes against the city and the ZNG. The sources do not indicate if the requested airstrikes were carried out. The 5th Military District instead pressured the central Croatian authorities to order the ZNG in Bjelovar to observe a comprehensive ceasefire previously agreed between Croatia and the JNA on 22 September. To verify the ceasefire, the European Community Monitor Mission (ECMM) deployed a monitoring team to the city. However, the authorities in Bjelovar ignored the order they received from the General Staff and stopped the ECMM team before it reached the city. According to Šimić, the move was made after Lieutenant General Petar Stipetić telephoned him and urged him to continue the attack. The authenticity of Šimić&#x27;s account of has been disputed by Admiral Davor Domazet-Lošo, who claims it was an attempt to discredit Croatia before the ECMM. At 19:00, the ZNG captured Božidar Adžija Barracks. By that time, all other JNA facilities in and near Bjelovar had been captured.

Before Barutana Depot was captured by the ZNG, one of the four storage structures, containing 1,700 tonnes (1,700 long tons; 1,900 short tons) of ammunition and explosives, was blown up by JNA Major Milan Tepić. The explosion occurred at 10:43, killing Tepić, and eleven ZNG troops who were blockading the depot in Bedenik Forest. The blast knocked down trees in a circle 200 metres (660 feet) wide, caused damage to nearby structures, predominantly in the then suburb of Hrgovljani and could be heard 20 kilometres (12 miles) away. The JNA lost another soldier in the area of the depot, killed by an antitank missile while he was engaging the ZNG using an infantry fighting vehicle gun.

29 September 1991 became one of the most important dates in the modern history of Bjelovar. In 1997, the City Councilr declared that date the Day of the City of Bjelovar. Since 2007, 29 September has been marked as Bjelovar Veterans&#x27; Day.

In 2009. the then Bjelovar parish church was officially pronounced as the Cathedral of Teresa of Ávila. by the Pope Benedict XVI making it the youngest cathedral in Croatia. On the same day, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bjelovar-Križevci, of which the Bjelovar cathedral is the centre, was created.

<doc id="923994" wikidata="Q1200405" url="?curid=923994" title="Derwent Reservoir (North East England)">
<text>The Derwent Reservoir is a reservoir on the River Derwent, on the border between County Durham and Northumberland, in England. It is west of Consett. It is 3.5 miles (5.6 km) long) and covers an area of 4 km2 and has a maximum depth of 100 ft (30m) and when full, holds 11,000 million gallons (50,000,000m³).

The reservoir is a key part of the water supply network in north east England (which is owned and managed by Northumbrian Water). It is the principal water source for the Tyne and Wear metropolitan area, supplying per day. The reservoir was first proposed in 1957 when the Sunderland and South Shields Water Company promoted the Derwent Water Order. Building work began on the reservoir in 1960, and it was opened in July 1967 by Princess Alexandra. Unlike other reservoirs in Northern England that are flooded valleys with a dam head, Derwent was dug out of the ground and the earth removed was used in its dam head.

The flow of the River Derwent can be supplemented, when necessary, by water transferred from the much larger Kielder Water in Northumberland. However, this connection cannot be used to increase the depth of the reservoir itself.

Sediment within the reservoir has been found to contain elevated levels of zinc, lead and cadmium. These have drained into the reservoir from areas of historic mining activity around Blanchland. Consequently, populations of macroscopic plants in the reservoir are relatively low.

Derwent Reservoir also hosts a sailing club, which holds many events throughout the year, including windsurfing, sailing, running and triathlons. The area around the reservoir hosts the annual Tour of the Reservoir cycle race.

The reservoir also has hydro electric plant installed, with a rating of 97 kilowatts.

<text>The 45th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army, most associated with the Oklahoma Army National Guard, from 1920 to 1968. Headquartered for most of its history in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, the guardsmen fought in both World War II and the Korean War. 

The 45th Infantry Division guardsmen saw no major action until they became one of the first National Guard units activated in World War II in 1941. They took part in intense fighting during the invasion of Sicily and the attack on Salerno in the 1943 Italian Campaign. Slowly advancing through Italy, they fought at Anzio until the capture of Rome. After landing in France during Operation Dragoon, they joined the 1945 drive into Germany that ended the War in Europe.

After a brief inactivation and subsequent reorganization as a unit restricted to Oklahomans, the division returned to duty in 1951 for the Korean War. It joined the United Nations troops on the front lines during the stalemate of the second half of the war, with constant, low-level fighting and trench warfare against the People&#x27;s Volunteer Army of China that produced little gain for either side. The division remained on the front lines in such engagements as Old Baldy Hill and Hill Eerie until the end of the war, returning to the U.S. in 1954.

The division remained a National Guard formation until its downsizing in 1968. Several units were activated to replace the division and carry on its lineage. Over the course of its history, the 45th Infantry Division sustained over 25,000 battle casualties, and its men were awarded ten Medals of Honor, twelve campaign streamers, the Croix de Guerre and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.

==History==
With the American entry into World War I, in April 1917, troops of the National Guard were formed into the units which exist today, with elements of the Colorado National Guard forming the 157th Infantry Regiment, the Arizona National Guard forming the 158th Infantry Regiment, and the New Mexico National Guard forming the 120th Engineer Regiment. These units were assigned to the 40th Division, and deployed to France where the division was used as a &quot;depot&quot; unit to process and provide replacements for front-line units. They returned home at the end of the war, which occurred on Armistice with Germany. The Oklahoma National Guard units that would later become the 179th Infantry Regiment and 180th Infantry Regiment were assigned to the 36th Division and would earn a combat participation credit during the Meuse–Argonne offensive in France as part of the 142nd Infantry.

===Inter-war years===
On 19 October 1920, units of the Oklahoma National Guard were organized as part of the 45th Infantry Division, also manned with troops from Arizona, Colorado, and New Mexico. The division headquarters was federally recognized on 3 August 1923 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. It was assigned the 89th Infantry Brigade of the Colorado and Arizona National Guards, and the 90th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma National Guard. As a consequence of these militia roots, when the division was properly organized, many of its members were marksmen and outdoorsmen from the remote frontier regions of the Southwestern United States. The division&#x27;s first commander was Major General Baird H. Markham.

The designated mobilization training center for the 45th Division was Fort Sill, Oklahoma. From 1922 to 1936, the division’s subordinate units generally held separate summer camps at locations within their respective states: Fort Sill for Oklahoma units; Fort Tuthill, near Flagstaff, for Arizona units; Camp Maximilliano Luna in San Miguel County for New Mexico units; and Camp George West near Golden, Colorado, for Colorado units. For at least 3 years, in 1927, 1932, and 1933, the division’s subordinate units trained over 250 company-grade officers of the 95th and 103rd Divisions at the various state encampment locations. In 1936, the division and brigade staffs participated in the Third Army command post exercise at Fort Sam Houston and Camp Bullis, Texas, which was designed to prepare them for the large-scale army maneuvers to be held the summer of 1938. For participation in the Eighth Corps Area concentration of the Third Army Maneuvers in August 1938, the division was split between Camp Bullis (Oklahoma elements), Fort Bliss, Texas (New Mexico and Colorado elements), and Fort Huachuca, Arizona (Arizona elements). During the maneuver at Fort Bliss, the 45th Division (-) operated as part of the provisional Brown Corps with the 2nd Division against the 36th Division and the 56th Cavalry Brigade of the Blue Corps. 

The 45th Infantry Division engaged in regular drills but no major events in its first few years, though the division&#x27;s Colorado elements were called in to help quell a large coal mining strike. The onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s severely curtailed its funding for training and equipment. Major General Roy Hoffman took command in 1931, followed by Alexander M. Tuthill in 1933, Alexander E. McPherren in 1935, and William S. Key in 1936. In 1937, the division&#x27;s troops were once again called up, this time to help manage a locust plague affecting Colorado.

The division&#x27;s original shoulder sleeve insignia, approved in August 1924, featured a swastika, a common Native American symbol, as a tribute to the Southwestern United States region which had a large population of Native Americans. However, with the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany, with its infamous swastika symbol, the 45th Division stopped using the insignia. After a long process of reviewing design submissions, a design by Woody Big Bow, a Kiowa artist from Carnegie, Oklahoma, was chosen for the new shoulder sleeve insignia. The new insignia featured the Thunderbird, another Native American symbol, and was approved in 1939.

In August 1940, the 45th Division again participated in the Third Army maneuvers, this time near the Kisatchie National Forest in Louisiana as part of the provisional VIII Corps. This was the first opportunity for all division elements to assemble and operate together since its organization. On 16 September 1940, the 45th Infantry Division, under Major General Key, was federalized from state control. It was one of four National Guard divisions to be federalized on that day, alongside the 30th, the 41st and 44th Infantry Divisions, originally for a one-year period. Its men immediately began basic combat training at Fort Sill. In August 1941, the 45th Infantry Division took part in the Louisiana Maneuvers, the largest peacetime exercises in U.S. military history. The division was assigned to VIII Corps with the 2nd and 36th Infantry Divisions, camped near Pitkin, Louisiana. Still operating with outmoded equipment from World War I, the division did not perform well during these exercises, and was criticized by officers who considered it &quot;feeble.&quot; In spite of these deficiencies, less than one month later, the men&#x27;s tour of duty was extended for another eighteen months, much to their chagrin, because of concerns of an impending American entry into World War II.

===World War II===
Throughout 1942, it continued this training at Camp Barkeley, Texas, before moving to Fort Devens, Massachusetts, to undergo amphibious assault training in preparation for an invasion of Italy. It then moved to Pine Camp, New York briefly for winter warfare training, but was hampered by continuously poor weather. In January 1943 it moved to Fort Pickett, Virginia, for its final training. The division, now commanded by Major General Troy H. Middleton, a Regular Army soldier and highly distinguished World War I veteran, moved to the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation&#x27;s Camp Patrick Henry to await combat loading on the transports.

The division&#x27;s two combat commands, the 89th and 90th Infantry Brigades, were inactivated in 1942, as the Army favored smaller and more versatile regimental and battalion-level commands for the new conflict. The 45th Infantry Division was then based around the 157th, 179th, and 180th Infantry Regiments. Also assigned to the division were the 158th, 160th, 171st, and 189th Field Artillery Battalions, the 45th Signal Company, the 700th Ordnance Company, the 45th Quartermaster Company, the 45th Reconnaissance Troop, the 120th Engineer Combat Battalion, and the 120th Medical Battalion.

====Sicily====


The 45th Division sailed from the Hampton Roads Port of Embarkation for the Mediterranean region on 8 June 1943, combat loaded aboard thirteen attack transports and five cargo attack vessels as convoy UGF-9 headed by the communications ship . By the time the 45th Division landed in North Africa on 22 June 1943, the Allies had largely secured the African theater. As a result, the division was not sent into combat upon arrival and instead commenced training at Arzew, French Morocco, in preparation for the invasion of Sicily. Allied intelligence estimated that the island was defended by approximately 230,000 troops, the majority of which were drawn mostly from weak Italian formations and two German divisions which had been reconstituted after being destroyed earlier. Against this, the Allies planned to land 180,000 troops, including the 45th Infantry Division, which was assigned to Lieutenant General Omar Bradley&#x27;s II Corps, part of the U.S. Seventh Army under Lieutenant General George S. Patton, for the operation.

The division was subsequently assigned a lead role in the amphibious assault on Sicily, coming ashore on 10 July. Landing near Scoglitti, the southernmost U.S. objective on the island, the division advanced north on the U.S. force&#x27;s eastern flank. After initially encountering resistance from armor of the Hermann Goering Division, the division advanced, supported by paratroopers of the 505th Parachute Regimental Combat Team, part of the 82nd Airborne Division, who landed inland on 11 July. The paratroopers, conducting their first combat jump of the war after six weeks of training in Tunisia, then set up to protect the 45th&#x27;s flank against German counterattack, but without weapons to counter heavy armor, the paratroopers had to rely on support from the 2nd Armored Division to repulse the German Tiger I tanks. As the division advanced towards its main objective to capture the airfields at Biscari, and Comiso, German forces were pushed back. For most of the first two weeks while the division moved slowly north, it encountered only light resistance from Italian forces fighting delaying actions. Italian and German forces resisted fiercely at Motta Hill on 26 July, however, and for four days the 45th Division was held up there. After this, the division was allocated to drive towards Messina, being ordered by the Seventh Army commander to cover the distance as quickly as possible. The 45th Division spent a few days in that city, but on 1 August, the division was withdrawn from the front line for rest and rear-guard patrol duty, after which the division was assigned to Major General Ernest J. Dawley&#x27;s VI Corps, part of the U.S. Fifth Army, under Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark, in preparation for the invasion of mainland Italy.

====Salerno====
On 3 September 1943, Italy surrendered to the Allied powers. Hoping to occupy as much of the country as possible before the German Army could react, the U.S. Fifth Army prepared to attack Salerno. On 10 September, elements of the division conducted its second landing at Agropoli and Paestum with the 36th Infantry Division, on the southernmost beaches of the attack. Opposing them were elements of the German 29th Panzergrenadier Division and XVI Panzer Corps. Against stiff resistance, the 45th pushed to the Calore River after a week of heavy fighting. The Fifth Army was battered and pushed back by German forces until 20 September, when Allied forces were finally able to break out and establish a more secure beachhead.

On 3 November it crossed the Volturno River and took Venafro. The division had great difficulty moving across the rivers and through the mountainous terrain, and the advance was slow. After linking up with the British Eighth Army, which had advanced from the south, the combined force, under the 15th Army Group, commanded by British General Sir Harold Alexander, was stalled when it reached the Gustav Line. Until 9 January 1944, the division, now under Major General William W. Eagles (replacing Major General Middleton who struck down with arthritis, was sent to England to command VIII Corps in the Normandy invasion), inched forward into the mountains reaching St. Elia, north of Monte Cassino, before moving to a rest area.

====Anzio====
Allied forces conducted a frontal assault on the Gustav Line stronghold at Monte Cassino, and VI Corps, under Major General John P. Lucas from 20 September, was assigned to Operation Shingle, detached from the 15th Army Group to land behind enemy lines at Anzio on 22 January 1944. For this mission, CCA (Combat Command A) of the 1st Armored Division was attached to the 45th Infantry Division. Landing on schedule, VI Corps surprised the Germans, but Major General Lucas&#x27;s decision to consolidate the beachhead instead of attacking gave the Germans time to bring the LXXVI Panzer Corps forward to oppose the landings.

One regiment of the 45th (the 179th Infantry) went ashore with the landings. In company with the British 1st Infantry Division, they advanced north along the Anzio-Albano road and captured the Aprilia &quot;factory&quot;, but encountered ingrained resistance from German armored units a few miles further on. Lucas then ordered the rest of the division ashore. The 45th Division was deployed on the southeastern side of the beachhead, along the lower Mussolini Canal.

On 30 January 1944, when VI Corps advanced from the beaches, it encountered heavy resistance and took heavy casualties. VI Corps was stopped at the &quot;Pimlott Line&quot; (the perimeter of the beachhead), and the fight became a battle of attrition.

The first major German counterattack came in early February and was against the British 1st Division. Two regiments of the 45th (the 179th and 157th Infantry) were sent to the Aprilia sector to reinforce the British. The 179th Infantry and a tank battalion of CCA tried to recapture Aprilia but were repulsed. Lucas then moved the rest of the 45th Division to the left-center of the perimeter, at Aprilia and along the west branch of the Mussolini Canal. For the next few months the 45th Infantry Division was mostly stuck in place, holding its ground during repeated German counterattacks, and subjected to bombardment from aircraft and artillery.

On 16 February, a major German attack struck the 45th and nearly broke through the 179th Infantry on 18 February. Lucas sent famed U.S. Army Ranger leader Colonel William Orlando Darby to assume command of the 157th Infantry, and the Germans were repulsed. The next three months were spent on the defensive, with the 45th engaged in trench warfare, alike to that in World War I.

On 23 May, VI Corps, now commanded by Major General Lucian Truscott, went on the offensive, breaking out of the beachhead to the northeast, with the 45th Division forming the left half of the attack. By 31 May, the German defenses were shattered, and the 45th Division turned northwest, toward the Alban Hills and Rome. On 4 June the 45th Division crossed the Tiber River below Rome, and entered the city along with other VI Corps troops. Men of the 45th Division were the first Allied troops to reach the Vatican.

On 16 June, the 45th Division withdrew for rest in preparation for other operations. At this time, VI Corps was attached to the Seventh Army, under Lieutenant General Alexander Patch, itself part of the Sixth United States Army Group under Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. The 45th, 36th, and 3rd Infantry Divisions were pulled from the line in Italy in preparation for Operation Dragoon (formerly &quot;Anvil&quot;), the invasion of southern France. &quot;Dragoon&quot; was originally planned to coincide with the Normandy landings in the north, but was delayed until August because of a shortage of landing craft.

====France and Germany====
The 45th Infantry Division participated in its fourth amphibious assault landing during Operation Dragoon on 15 August 1944, at St. Maxime, in Southern France. The 45th Infantry Division landed its 157th and 180th regimental combat teams and captured the heights of the Chaines de Mar before meeting with the 1st Special Service Force. The German Army, reeling from the Battle of Normandy, in which it had suffered a major defeat, pulled back after a short fight, part of an overall German withdrawal to the east following the landings. Soldiers of the 45th Infantry Division engaged the dispersed forces of German Army Group G, suffering very few casualties. The U.S. Seventh Army, along with Free French forces, were able to advance north quickly. By 12 September, the Seventh Army linked up with Lieutenant General George S. Patton&#x27;s U.S. Third Army, advancing from Normandy, joining the two forces at Dijon. Against slight opposition, it spearheaded the drive for the Belfort Gap. The 45th Infantry Division took the strongly defended city of Epinal on 24 September. The division was then reassigned to V Corps, under the command of Major General Leonard T. Gerow, for its next advance. On 30 September the division crossed the Moselle River and entered the western foothills of the Vosges, taking Rambervillers. It would remain in the area for a month waiting for other units to catch up before crossing the Mortagne River on 23 October. The division remained on the line with the U.S. 6th Army Group the southernmost of three army groups advancing through France.

After the crossing was complete, the division was relieved from V Corps and assigned to Major General Wade H. Haislip&#x27;s XV Corps. The division was allowed a one-month rest, resuming its advance on 25 November, attacking the forts north of Mutzig. These forts had been designed by Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1893 to block access to the plain of Alsace. The 45th Division next crossed the Zintzel River before pushing through the Maginot Line defenses. During this time much of the division&#x27;s artillery assets were attached to the 44th Infantry Division to provide additional support. The 45th Infantry Division, now commanded by Major General Robert T. Frederick, who had previously commanded the 1st Special Service Force, was reassigned to VI Corps on New Year&#x27;s Day. From 2 January 1945, the division fought defensively along the German border, withdrawing to the Moder River. It sent half of its artillery to support the 70th Infantry Division. On 17 February the division was pulled off the line for rest and training. Once this rest period was complete, the division was assigned to XV Corps for the final push into German territory. The 45th moved north to the Sarreguemines area and smashed through the Siegfried Line, on 17 March taking Homburg on the 21st and crossing the Rhine between Worms and Hamm on the 26th. The advance continued, with Aschaffenburg falling on 3 April, and Nuremberg on the 20th. The division crossed the Danube River on 27 April, and liberated 32,000 captives of the Dachau concentration camp on 29 April 1945. The division captured Munich during the next two days, occupying the city until V-E Day and the surrender of Germany. During the next month, the division remained in Munich and set up collection points and camps for the massive numbers of surrendering troops of the German armies. The number of POWs taken by the 45th Division during its almost two years of fighting totalled 124,840 men. The division was then slated to move to the Pacific theater of operations to participate in the invasion of mainland Japan on the island of Honshu, but these plans were scrubbed before the division could depart after the surrender of Japan, on V-J Day.

====Allegations of war crimes====

During and after the war, courts-martial were convened to investigate possible war crimes by members of the division. In the first two cases, dubbed the Biscari massacre, occurred on 14 July 1943, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate following the capture of an airfield in the area. George Patton, the Seventh Army commanding general, asked Omar Bradley, II Corps commanding general, to get the cases dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer, Sergeant Horace T. West, 33 years old, later confessed to the crimes in the first incident and was found guilty. On the second incident, Captain John T. Compton ordered Italian soldiers to be lined up and shot; the officer claimed he had only been following orders and was acquitted.

In a third incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers of the 157th Infantry Regiment under Lieutenant Colonel Felix L. Sparks after servicemen were accused of massacring German soldiers who were surrendering at the Dachau concentration camp in 1945. Some of the German troops were camp guards; the others were sick and wounded troops from a nearby hospital. The soldiers of the 45th Division who liberated the camp were outraged at the malnourishment and maltreatment of the 32,000 prisoners they liberated, some barely alive, and all victims of the Holocaust. After entering the camp, the soldiers found boxcars filled with dead bodies of prisoners who had succumbed to starvation or last-minute executions, and in rooms adjacent to gas chambers they found naked bodies piled from the floor to the ceiling. The cremation ovens, which were still in operation when the soldiers arrived, contained bodies and skeletons as well. Some of the victims apparently had died only hours before the 45th Division entered the camp, while many others lay where they had died in states of decomposition that overwhelmed the soldiers&#x27; senses. Accounts conflict over what happened and over how many German troops were killed. After investigating the incident, the Army considered court-martialling several officers involved, but Patton successfully intervened. The Seventh Army was being disbanded and Patton had been appointed Military Governor of Bavaria, placing the matter in his hands. Some veterans of the 45th Infantry Division have said that only 30 to 50 German soldiers were killed and that very few were killed trying to surrender, while others have admitted to killing or refusing to treat wounded German guards.

Confessed murderer Frank Sheeran later recalled his war service with the 45th as the time when he first developed a callousness to the taking of human life. Sheeran claimed to have participated in numerous massacres and summary executions of German POWs, acts which violated the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907 and the 1929 Geneva Convention on POWs. In later interviews with Charles Brandt, he divided such massacres into four categories:

* Revenge killings in the heat of battle. Sheeran told Brandt that, when a German soldier had just killed his close friends and then tried to surrender, he would often &quot;send him to hell, too&quot;. He described often witnessing similar behavior by fellow GIs.
* Orders from unit commanders during a mission. When describing his first murder for organized crime, Sheeran recalled: &quot;It was just like when an officer would tell you to take a couple of German prisoners back behind the line and for you to &#x27;hurry back&#x27;. You did what you had to do.&quot;
* The Dachau massacre and other reprisal killings of concentration camp guards and trustee inmates.
* Calculated attempts to dehumanize and degrade German POWs. While Sheeran&#x27;s unit was climbing the Harz Mountains, they came upon a Wehrmacht mule train carrying food and drink up the mountainside. The female cooks were first allowed to leave unmolested, then Sheeran and his fellow GIs &quot;ate what we wanted and soiled the rest with our waste&quot;. Then the Wehrmacht mule drivers were given shovels and ordered to &quot;dig their own shallow graves&quot;. Sheeran later joked that they did so without complaint, likely hoping that he and his buddies would change their minds. But the mule drivers were shot and buried in the holes they had dug. Sheeran explained that by then, he &quot;had no hesitation in doing what I had to do.&quot;

===After the war===

During World War II, the 45th Division fought in 511 days of combat. Nine soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor during their service with the 45th Infantry Division: Van T. Barfoot, Ernest Childers, Almond E. Fisher, William J. Johnston, Salvador J. Lara, Jack C. Montgomery, James D. Slaton, Jack Treadwell, and Edward G. Wilkin. Soldiers of the division also received 61 Distinguished Service Crosses, three Distinguished Service Medals, 1,848 Silver Star Medals, 38 Legion of Merit medals, 59 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 5,744 Bronze Star Medals, and 52 Air Medals. The division received seven distinguished unit citations and eight campaign streamers during the conflict.

Most of the division returned to New York in September 1945, and from there went to Camp Bowie, Texas. On 7 December 1945, the division was inactivated from the active duty force and its members reassigned to other Army units. The following year, on 10 September 1946, the 45th Infantry Division was reconstituted as a National Guard unit. Instead of comprising units from several states, the post-war 45th was an all-Oklahoma organization. During this time the division was also reorganized and as a part of this process the 157th Infantry was removed from the division&#x27;s order of battle and replaced with the 279th Infantry Regiment.

During this time, the U.S. Army underwent a drastic reduction in size. At the end of World War II, it contained 89 divisions, but by 1950, there were just 10 active divisions in the force, along with a few reserve divisions such as the 45th Infantry Division which were combat-ineffective. The division retained many of its best officers as senior commanders as the force downsized, and it enjoyed a good relationship with its community. The 45th in this time was regarded as one of the better-trained National Guard divisions. Regardless, by mid-1950 the division had only 8,413 troops, less than 45 percent of its full-strength authorization. Only 10 percent of the division&#x27;s officers and five percent of its enlisted men had combat experience with the division from World War II.

===Korean War===
At the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950, the U.S. Army looked to expand its force again to prepare for major conflict. After the North Korean People&#x27;s Army invaded the Republic of Korea, four understrength U.S. divisions on occupation duty in Japan were rushed to South Korea to stand alongside the Republic of Korea Army. These were the 7th Infantry Division, the 1st Cavalry Division, the 24th Infantry Division, and the 25th Infantry Division, which were all under the control of the Eighth United States Army. Due to drastic reductions in U.S. military spending following the end of World War II, these divisions were equipped with worn-out or obsolete weaponry and suffered from a shortage of anti-armor weapons capable of penetrating the hulls of the North Korean T-34 tanks.

==== Reinforcement pool ====
Initially, the division was used to provide a pool of reinforcements for the divisions which had been sent to the Korean War theater, and in January 1951 it provided 650 enlisted fillers for overseas service. Later that month, it was given 4,006 new recruits for its three infantry regiments and artillery assets, and each unit created a 14-week training program to prepare these new soldiers for combat. Because of heavy casualties and slow reinforcement rates, the Army looked to the National Guard to provide additional units to relieve the beleaguered Eighth Army. At the time, the 45th Infantry Division was comprised overwhelmingly of high school students or recent graduates and only about 60 percent of its divisional troops had conducted training and drills with the division for a year or more. Additionally, only about 20 percent of its personnel had prior experience of military service from World War II. Nevertheless, the division was one of four National Guard divisions identified as being among the most prepared for combat based on the effectiveness of its equipment, training, and leadership. As a result, in February 1951, the 45th Infantry Division was alerted that it would sail for Japan.

In preparation for the deployment, the division was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, to begin training and to fill its ranks. After its basic training was complete, the division was sent to Japan in April 1951 for advanced training and to act as a reserve force for the Eighth United States Army, then fighting in Korea. The involvement of the National Guard in the fighting in Korea was further expanded when the 40th Infantry Division of the California Army National Guard received warning orders for deployment as well.

==== Initial struggles ====

On 1 September 1950, the 45th Infantry Division was activated as the first National Guard division to be deployed to the Far East theater since World War II. Nevertheless, it was not deployed to Korea until December 1951, when its advanced training was complete. 

When it arrived in Korea, only half the division&#x27;s manpower were National Guard troops. Though the 45th remained &quot;de facto&quot; segregated as an all-white unit in 1950, individual unit commanders went to great lengths to integrate reinforcements from different areas and ethnicities into their units. By 1952, it was fully integrated. Following its arrival, the division moved to the front line to replace the 1st Cavalry Division, which was then delegated to the Far East reserve, having suffered over 16,000 casualties in less than 18 months of fighting.

Additionally, in an effort to reduce the burden on the National Guard, the term of service for National Guardsmen in Korea was initially set at 21, and later 24 months; over 4,500 guardsmen left between May and July 1952, continually replaced by more active-duty troops and draftees, including an increasing number of African Americans. In August 1952, Congress approved a law authorizing the organization of &quot;National Guard of the United States&quot; (NGUS) units in states whose National Guard units were in federal service, which would bear the same designations as those on active duty. Before the establishment of the 45th Infantry Division (NGUS) on 15 September 1952, the returning Oklahoma guardsmen were either separated from the service if their Guard enlistments had expired, or remained in inactive reserve status. As a result of this effort, two 45th Infantry Division units existed between 1952 and 1954; the National Guard 45th Infantry Division in Korea, and the 45th Infantry Division (NGUS) in Oklahoma.

By the time the division was in place, the battle lines on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put under the command of the Eighth Army&#x27;s I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and the weather was poor in the region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.

Initially, the division did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor assets were used as mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar attack. It also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made up the majority of the division&#x27;s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had to disengage when it was attacked.

In the division&#x27;s first few months on the line, Chinese forces conducted three raids in its sector. In retaliation, the 245th Tank Battalion sent nine tanks to raid Agok. Two companies of Chinese forces ambushed and devastated a patrol from the 179th Infantry a short time later. In the spring, the division launched Operation Counter, which was an effort to establish 11 patrol bases around Old Baldy Hill. The division then defended the hill against a series of Chinese assaults from the Chinese 38th Army.

==== Final engagements and the end of the war ====

The 45th Infantry Division, along with the 7th Infantry Division, fought off repeated Chinese attacks all along the front line throughout 1952, and Chinese forces frequently attacked Old Baldy Hill into the fall of that year. Around that time, the 45th Infantry Division relinquished command of Old Baldy Hill to the 2nd Infantry Division. Almost immediately the Chinese launched a concentrated attack on the hill, overrunning the U.S. forces. Heavy rainstorms prevented the divisions from retaking the hill for around a month, and when it was finally retaken it was heavily fortified to prevent further attacks. The 245th Tank Battalion was sent to assault Chinese positions throughout late 1952, but most of the division held a stationary defensive line against the Chinese.

In early 1953, North Korean forces launched a large-scale attack against Hill 812, which was then under the control of K Company, 3rd Battalion, 179th Infantry. The ensuing Battle of Hill Eerie was one of a series of larger attacks by Chinese and North Korean forces which produced heavier fighting than the previous year had seen. These offensives were conducted largely in order to secure a better position during the ongoing truce negotiations. Chinese forces continued to mount concentrated attacks on the lines of the UN forces, including the 45th Infantry Division, but the division managed to hold most of its ground, remaining stationary until the end of the war in the summer of 1953.

During the Korean War, the 45th Infantry Division suffered 4,004 casualties, consisting of 834 killed in action and 3,170 wounded in action. The division was awarded four campaign streamers and one Presidential Unit Citation. One soldier from the division, Charles George, was awarded the Medal of Honor while serving in Korea.

===After Korea===

The division briefly patrolled the Korean Demilitarized Zone following the signing of the armistice ending the war, but most of its men returned home and reverted to National Guard status on 30 April 1954. Its colors were returned to Oklahoma on 25 September of that year, formally ending the division&#x27;s presence in Korea.

The division remained as a unit of the Oklahoma National Guard and participated in no major actions throughout the rest of the 1950s save regular weekend and summer training exercises. In 1963, the formation was reorganized in accordance with the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions plan, which saw the establishment of a 1st, 2nd and 3rd Brigade within the division. These brigades would see no major deployments or events and were inactivated five years later in 1968. That same year, due to the perceived lack of need for so many large formations in the Army National Guard, the 45th Infantry Division was inactivated, as part of a larger move to reduce the number of Army National Guard divisions from 15 to eight, while increasing the number of separate brigades from seven to 18. In its place, the independent 45th Infantry Brigade (Separate) was established. The 45th Infantry Brigade received all of the 45th Division&#x27;s lineage and heraldry, including its shoulder sleeve insignia. Also activated from division assets were the 45th Field Artillery Group, later redesignated the 45th Fires Brigade, and the 90th Troop Command.

==Honors==
The 45th Infantry Division was awarded eight campaign streamers and one foreign unit award in World War II and four campaign streamers and one foreign unit award in the Korean War, for a total of twelve campaign streamers and two foreign unit decorations in its operational history.

==Museum==
The 45th Infantry Division Museum located in Oklahoma City, is the nation’s largest state-operated military history museum depicting the military history of Oklahoma and the 45th Infantry Division. With displays from 1941 through Desert Storm, the museum includes the country’s third-largest collection of historic U.S. military firearms and the world’s largest collection of items once owned by Adolf Hitler. Also includes a substantial collection of cartoons by World War II cartoonist Bill Mauldin, who served with it during the war.

==Commanding Generals==
Note: The similarity of dates of command for General Muldrow and commanders beginning with General Ruffner is because the 45th Infantry Division was retained in federal service as a unit during the Korean War while a duplicate unit, the 45th Infantry Division (NGUS), was authorized to be activated in Oklahoma during its absence.

<doc id="924021" wikidata="Q2477700" url="?curid=924021" title="1994 Dutch general election">
<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 3 May 1994. The Labour Party emerged as the largest party, winning 37 of the 150 seats in the House of Representatives. The election resulted in significant losses for both the Labour Party and the Christian Democratic Appeal. The two liberal parties, People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democrats 66 made large gains, whilst two pro-elderly parties and the Socialist Party all passed the electoral threshold to win seats.

The formation of a government coalition was arduous but after four months the First Kok cabinet was formed. It was an unprecedented coalition of the two liberal parties and Labour. The CDA was consigned to opposition for the first time in its history. It was also the first government since 1918 not to include a Christian Democratic party.

==Background==
Before the 1994 general election opinion polls predicted that the Centre Democrats party could win more than five seats in the House of Representatives. However, media reports claiming that some newly elected local members had extremist pasts damaged the Centre Democrats&#x27; prospects. A secret recording broadcast on national television one week before the election showed an Amsterdam council member bragging about having set immigrant centers on fire in the early 1980s. In the election that followed, the Centre Democrats won 2.5% of the vote and three seats in the House of Representatives (Janmaat was joined by Wil Schuurman and Cor Zonneveld), well below earlier expectations. Janmaat claimed that the relatively poor result was a result of an anti-CD campaign in the media. Due to its growth, and questions arising amongst the other parties over the development of a multicultural society, political opponents began to confront the Centre Democrats directly rather than maintain a strict &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; around it.

:1, 9, 35, 91, 189, 341, 559, 855, 1241, 1729, 2331, 3059, 3925, 4941, 6119, 7471, 9009, ... .

==Formulas==
The centered cube number for a pattern with concentric layers around the central point is given by the formula

:formula_1

The same number can also be expressed as a trapezoidal number (difference of two triangular numbers), or a sum of consecutive numbers, as
:formula_2

==Properties==
Because of the factorization , it is impossible for a centered cube number to be a prime number.
The only centered cube numbers which are also the square numbers are 1 and 9, which can be shown by solving , the only integer solutions being (x,y) from {(0,0), (1,2), (3,6), (12,42)}, By substituting a=(x-1)/2 and b=y/2, we obtain x^2=2y^3+3y^2+3y+1. This gives only (a,b) from {(-1/2,0), (0,1), (1,3), (11/2,21)} where a,b are half-integers.

<text>The Charter Committee (also known as the Charter Party) is an independent political organization dedicated to good government in Cincinnati, Ohio. Members of this committee are called Charterites. Committee organizers prefer the term Charter Committee rather than Charter Party. Because of Ohio State laws regarding vote percentage cutoffs for official party recognition, the Charter Committee is not an officially recognized political party in Ohio.

== History ==
The Charter Committee claims to be &quot;the oldest third party in the nation that has continually elected officials to the office&quot;. It was founded in 1924, during a time when Cincinnati government was under the control of the Republican Party. Cincinnati was infamous for being the most corruptly governed major city in the United States, the era of Boss Cox (established by George Cox in the 1880s), controlled then by his protégé Rudolph Hynicka, who spent most of his time in New York in the management of the Columbia Burlesque Circuit.

Republican reformers, led by members of the Republican Executive and Advisory Committee, then began the Cincinnatus Association. In 1923, Republican lawyer Murray Seasongood became the leader of the reformers&#x27; successful anti-tax campaign.

The Cincinnatus Association then led to the formation of the Birdless Ballot League, which advocated nonpartisan elections. (The term &quot;birdless&quot; referred to the use of the Republican eagle and Democratic rooster as party symbols on the ballot). In 1924, the Birdless Ballot League joined with other reformers to create the City Charter Committee.

The pre-1925 charter established a 32-member city council, six of whom were elected at-large. Only candidates nominated in a citywide primary by the Republican and Democratic parties were eligible to run. In 1924, there were 31 Republicans and one Democrat on the council. Between 1913 and 1925, only five Democrats had managed to get elected to the council. The real power behind government was held by Hynicka&#x27;s Republican Central Committee, comprising Republican ward and township captains, which held the real power in the Republican party, to the disadvantage of the Executive and Advisory Committee.

The new municipal charter enacted in 1925 as part of the Charterite movement established a Council-Manager form of government (abolishing the mayor-council system) and a civil service bureaucracy to replace political patronage. The new charter, which created a nine-member council, also mandated nonpartisan municipal elections and proportional representation with preference-ranked voting.

With Democrats running on the Charter ticket, the first election following the adoption of the council resulted in the election of six Charterites to the council. Democrat Ed Dixon, who had won more votes than Seasongood, and, therefore, should automatically have become mayor under the new charter, was persuaded to allow the leader of the reform movement to become the first mayor under the new charter.

Although the Charter movement started with Republican reformers like Seasongood, the movement quickly became informally allied with the Democratic party against the Republican machine. Democratic candidates ran as Charterites. By the 1950s, Republicans fought the Charterites by plastering them with the label of socialism. In 1957, the Republicans overturned proportional representation. It is believed that this was done to prevent the election of Theodore M. Berry as the city&#x27;s first black mayor. 

In 1959, Democrats broke off from the Charterite coalition. Splitting the progressive vote with the Democrats throughout the 1960s, the Charterites barely survived the return of Republican rule, with Charles Phelps Taft II its only elected official by 1961. In 1963, Berry joined Taft on the council.

In 1969, the Charterites joined with the Democrats in a formal coalition that took control of city government in 1971. The coalition was led at times both by Charterites (Bobbie L. Sterne and Charles Phelps Taft II) and by Democrats (Tom Luken and Jerry Springer). From 1973, the two parties divided the two-year mayoral term into two one-year periods that alternated between them.

Tom Luken&#x27;s son, Charlie Luken ended the Democratic-Charterite coalition in 1985 when Arn Bortz was the only Charterite left on the council. In 1983 Marian Spencer was the first African American female elected to Cincinnati City Council and served as Vice Mayor and as a member of the Charter Party for one term. Sterne, who lost her seat in 1985, made a comeback in 1987. Bortz left politics in 1988 to concentrate on business but was anointed as his successor the popular professional football player Reggie Williams. Williams stayed for only two years. When Charterite Tyrone Yates became a Democrat in preparation for running for the state legislature, Sterne found herself again the sole Charterite on the council. Term limits prevented Sterne from running again in 1999, so she resigned her seat in 1998 in favor of restaurateur Jim Tarbell.

Over the years, Charterites pursued several liberal and progressive causes, including reducing pollution and establishing cost-of-living wage increases for municipal employees. The Charterites instituted the now-common requirement of maintaining a public inventory of municipal property. Another Charterite initiative that has spread throughout the country requires private employers to inform employees of the risks of handling hazardous materials, known as a right-to-know law.

The Charter Committee reached its height of power in the 1950s when it ran city government with Democrats running on the Charter ticket. In the 1970s and 1980s, the Charter Committee formed a coalition municipal government with the Democrats. The coalition lasted until 1986. In recent years, the Charter Committee has sought to expand beyond the Cincinnati city limits, endorsing candidates in neighboring jurisdictions, such as Covington, Kentucky.

The Charter Committee includes Democrats as well as Republicans and independents. The Charter Committee advocates an activist government to address public problems and its main power base has been among the progressive-minded, educated, affluent senior citizens of Cincinnati. The committee is currently making efforts to appeal to younger voters. The committee has also turned its sights on establishing a regional government.

The last Charterite mayor of Cincinnati was Arn Bortz. The party was nearly extinguished in the 1990s. From 1993 to 2003, the city council had only one Charterite member. In 2015, there were three Charterite members of the city council, Yvette Simpson, Kevin Flynn, and Amy Murray.

As of August 15, 2021, the current president of the Charter Committee is Darrick Dansby. The previous president was Matt Woods.

It accepts both Democratic and Republican members on its volunteer board of directors.

== Platform ==

As of 2021, the committee website states three main pillars that comprise its platform: Return, Reform, and Renew.

== Notable Charterites ==
* Chris Bortz
* Courtis Fuller
* Roxanne Qualls
* Murray Seasongood
* Yvette Simpson
* Marian Spencer
* Nick Spencer
* Bobbie L. Sterne
* Charles Phelps Taft II
* Jim Tarbell
* Reggie Williams
* Russell Wilson

== Former Charterites ==
Many former Charterites switched to one of the major parties or to independent. They include:
* Ken Blackwell, the former Republican Ohio Secretary of State and unsuccessful Republican candidate for Governor of Ohio against Democrat Ted Strickland in 2006
* John J. Gilligan, who was elected Governor of Ohio as a Democrat in the 1970s.
* Christopher Smitherman, a Cincinnati City Council member was endorsed in 2003 by the Charter Committee. He lost reelection in 2005 and recently returned to the council in 2011 as an independent with no political party endorsements.
* Tyrone Yates, a Democratic member of the state legislature, was a Charterite member of the city council until 1993.

<text>The Alaska Marine Highway (AMH) or the Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) is a ferry service operated by the U.S. state of Alaska. It has its headquarters in Ketchikan, Alaska.

The Alaska Marine Highway System operates along the south-central coast of the state, the eastern Aleutian Islands and the Inside Passage of Alaska and British Columbia, Canada. Ferries serve communities in Southeast Alaska that have no road access, and the vessels can transport people, freight, and vehicles. AMHS&#x27;s of routes go as far south as Bellingham, Washington, in the contiguous United States and as far west as Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, with a total of 32 terminals throughout Alaska, British Columbia, and Washington. It is part of the National Highway System and receives federal highway funding. It is also the only method of transportation of vehicles between the state and the contiguous United States not requiring international customs and immigration.

The Alaska Marine Highway System is a rare example in the U.S. of a shipping line offering regularly scheduled service for the primary purpose of transportation of passengers rather than of leisure or entertainment. Voyages can last many days, but, in contrast to the luxury of a typical cruise line, cabins cost extra, and most food is served cafeteria-style.

==History==

===Pre-statehood===
The forerunner to the Alaska Marine Highway was the Chilkoot Motorship Lines, founded in 1948 by Haines residents Steve Homer and Ray Gelotte. The company used a converted LCT-Mark VI landing craft, christened the . They operated a weekly service from Tee Harbor (north of Juneau) to Haines and Skagway, connecting the territorial capital to the international road system. The Chilkoot Motorship Lines was purchased by the territorial government, and moved under the Territorial Board of Road Commissioners in 1951. In 1957, the MV &quot;Chillkoot&quot; was replaced by the MV &quot;Chilkat&quot;, which remained a part of the system until being decommissioned in 1988.

===A state ferry system===
In 1959, the year Alaska became a state, voters approved an $18 million ($ million today) bond package to improve the ferry system throughout the Southeast and Southcentral regions. The package included 4 new vessels and new docks throughout. The first of these new vessels built was the MV &quot;Malaspina&quot;, followed closely by the MV &quot;Matanuska&quot; and MV &quot;Taku&quot;. With 3 new ships, and a new name, the Alaska Marine Highway System (AMHS) was born.

The following year, the ocean-certified MV &quot;Tustumena&quot; was completed, the &quot;Chilkat&quot; moved to Prince William Sound, and the AMHS started service in Southcentral. In 1969, that service was expanded with the addition of the MV &quot;E.L. Bartlett&quot;, in service with the state until 2004.

===Farther south===
In 1967, two events acted to severely restrict transportation to and from Southeast Alaska. A slide took out the Alaska Highway to the North, and BC Ferries MV &quot;Queen of Prince Rupert&quot; ran aground, severely limiting transfer passengers&#x27; ability to move between the AMHS Southern terminus of Prince Rupert, British Columbia to Seattle. Until this time, portions of the passage between Southeast Alaska and Washington State were classified as outside waters, and none of the vessels the AMHS operated in Southeast Alaska had the necessary ocean-going certification required to carry passengers on outside waters. Citing the need for a transportation link between Alaska and the rest of the United States, then governor Wally Hickel ordered the AMHS to send a vessel south to Seattle while putting a request to Congress to re-classify the route as inside waters. The federal government agreed to do so, which left the AMHS with a significantly longer route system, and no new vessels to serve it.

Faced with the lengthy construction time and cost of building a new vessel, the AMHS looked abroad to find a quicker solution. The &quot;Stena Britannica&quot;, just a year old, was purchased and rechristened the MV &quot;Wickersham&quot;. While the &quot;Wickersham&quot; was relatively inexpensive to purchase, and could be added to the system quickly, she was never re-flagged as an American ship, and so commercial operation between US ports of call was a violation of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly known as the &quot;Jones Act&quot;). Initially, the State of Alaska had felt they would be able to get a waiver of the Jones Act for the Wickersham, but that request was blocked, severely limiting the scheduling flexibility of the ship. While the Wickersham could pick up passengers in Washington State and deliver them to Alaska if there were an intermediary stop in Canada, moving passengers within Alaska was not allowed. Additionally, as the Wickersham was not specifically built for Alaskan ports, she was limited as to which ports she could dock at. The AMHS ordered the new construction of the MV &quot;Columbia&quot;, which replaced the Wickersham on the mainline Seattle route in 1974.

The southern terminus of the AMHS remained in Seattle until October 1989, when it moved to the Bellingham Cruise Terminal in Fairhaven, Washington, after signing a 20-year lease with the city of Bellingham.

===Feeder service===
Facing the need to increase capacity, both the &quot;Matanuska&quot; and &quot;Malaspina&quot; were stretched by 56 feet, beyond the capacity of some of the smaller harbors and leaving the &quot;Taku&quot; as the only AMHS ship in Southeast able to serve some of the smaller communities. To serve the smaller communities of Southeast, the AMHS ordered the MV &quot;LeConte&quot; in 1974 and the MV &quot;Aurora&quot; in 1978. These would be the last new ships built for the AMHS for 20 years, ending the initial construction of the AMHS.

===&quot;Exxon Valdez&quot; oil spill===
On March 24, 1989, the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound. The State of Alaska&#x27;s on scene response was managed from the &quot;E.L. Bartlett,&quot; later relieved by the &quot;Aurora.&quot; Suction trucks were placed in the car-deck, temporarily converting the ferry into a spill response vessel. The State of Alaska determined a new vessel was necessary, and the new vessel should be designed from the beginning to be able to take on a command and control role in the case of another disaster. Funded in part by settlement money from Exxon, the MV &quot;Kennicott&quot; joined the system in 1998.

===Day boats===
New construction since the &quot;Kennicott&quot; has focused on day boats, which can run their expected schedule and return home within a 12-hour shift.

In 2004, the MV &quot;Lituya&quot; was added to the fleet to make the trip between Ketchikan and Metlakatla in Southeast. With a design heavily influenced by oil rig supply vessels, she is unique among the fleet with an open car deck and limited passenger facilities. Costing only $9.5 million ($ million today), her low fuel consumption and small crew complement make her the most economical vessel in the fleet, giving the AMHS real-world data on the effectiveness of small, short-haul ferries in Southeast waters.

=== Labor strike ===

In 2019, a labor strike involving over 400 members of the Inlandboatman&#x27;s Union of the Pacific shut down the AMH for several days between July 24 and August 2. This strike, the first one the AMH had seen in 42 years, led to a $3.2 million loss in revenue and reimbursements and was resolved with federal mediation.

==Routes==
===Southeast Alaska===
The southeast AMHS route system is divided into two subsystems: the mainline routes which typically take more than one day for the ship to travel; and shorter routes where the vessels depart their home port in the morning, travel to destination ports and then return to their home port on the same day. The shorter routes are commonly referred to as &quot;day boat&quot; routes.

The mainline routes carry a high percentage of tourists in the summer, and provide service between Bellingham, Washington, or Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and Skagway, Alaska. Along the way, the ships stop in Ketchikan, Wrangell, Petersburg, Sitka, Juneau, and Haines. The smaller communities Kake and Hoonah are served by certain mainline sailings. During 2008, the five largest AMHS vessels were used on the Southeast mainline routes. These were the , , , , and the .

Day boat service was also provided on the North Lynn Canal route during the peak summer season by MV Malaspina. This route provides round-trip service between Juneau, Haines and Skagway. The day boat routes connect the smaller communities of Southeast Alaska with each other and with the Southeast Alaska mainline communities (Ketchikan, Petersburg, Wrangell, Sitka, Juneau, Haines and Skagway) that serve as regional centers for commerce, government health services, and/or connections to other transportation systems. The day boat routes primarily serve local residents, and include Angoon, Hoonah, Kake, Metlakatla, Pelican, and Tenakee.

In 2008, three AMHS vessels provided service on the day boat routes. These were the , the and the . The MV &quot;Lituya&quot; is dedicated to providing day boat service between Ketchikan and Metlakatla. The Southeast System connects with the continental road system at Bellingham, Washington, Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and in Alaska at Haines and Skagway.

===Cross-gulf service===
When the MV &quot;Kennicott&quot;, a vessel certified to operate in open waters, joined the fleet in the summer 1998 the ferry system expanded to include regular cross-gulf sailings. Also known as &quot;inter-tie trips&quot;, these sailings connect Southeastern Alaska with Southcentral and Southwest regions of the state. All cross-gulf trips include a stop at the port of Yakutat, a community unique in that it is served only on a cross-gulf route. During 2008, the AMHS provided Yakutat with 10 port calls.

===Southwest Alaska===
The Southwest system serves Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Aleutian Islands. The MV Tustumena provides regular service between Kodiak, Port Lions, Seldovia and Homer. In 2008, between April and October, the MV &quot;Tustumena&quot; traveled out the Aleutian chain once a month to Unalaska/Dutch Harbor, stopping at Chignik, Sand Point, King Cove, False Pass, Akutan and Cold Bay.
This trip is not made in the winter because of adverse weather conditions. In 2008 service in Prince William Sound to Valdez, Cordova and Whittier was provided by the MV &quot;Aurora&quot;. The MV &quot;Chenega&quot; provided additional service during the summer season, and the MV &quot;Kennicott&quot; provided supplemental service. AMHS also provided fifty-five stops in the village of Tatitlek and thirty-six stops in Chenega Bay. Tourist passengers add a significant percentage to the Prince William Sound traffic in the summer, especially between Valdez and Whittier. In the winter months when traffic demand was significantly reduced and weather conditions worsened, the MV &quot;Chenega&quot; was moved to North Lynn Canal to replace the Fairweather for its overhaul period. The MV &quot;Tustumena&quot; also underwent a CIP project, leaving the MV &quot;Aurora&quot; to provide service between the ports.

==Communities served==
The Alaska Marine Highway&#x27;s main hub is in Juneau, though administrative offices are in Ketchikan. Other smaller operational hubs include Cordova (Prince William Sound), Ketchikan (southern Panhandle), and Kodiak (Southcentral Alaska).

The AMHS serves the following communities year-round:
*Akutan
*Angoon
*Bellingham, Washington
*Chenega Bay
*Chignik
*Cold Bay
*Cordova
*False Pass
*Gustavus

==Current vessels==
The following vessels, from smallest to largest, currently serve in the Alaska Marine Highway&#x27;s fleet:
* MV &quot;Lituya&quot;, solely dedicated to serving the Ketchikan-Annette Bay route, which includes the city of Metlakatla.
* MV &quot;Aurora&quot; operates in Prince William Sound.
* MV &quot;LeConte&quot; serves the feeder communities in the northern Southeast as a day boat.
* MV &quot;Tazlina&quot;, the first Alaska-Class vessel and the first AMHS ship to be built in Alaska.
* MV &quot;Hubbard&quot;, the second Alaska-Class vessel.
* MV &quot;Tustumena&quot;, serves Southcentral and Aleutian Island communities.
* MV &quot;Malaspina&quot;, runs backup mainline throughout Southeast Alaska when the MV Columbia is off-line for service. During the summer months it serves a daily shuttle route between Juneau, Haines and Skagway.
* MV &quot;Matanuska&quot;, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, frequently beginning in Prince Rupert, and occasionally running to Bellingham.
* MV &quot;Columbia&quot;, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, usually beginning in Bellingham.
* MV &quot;Kennicott&quot;, runs mainline throughout Southeast Alaska, frequently beginning in Prince Rupert and making a cross-Gulf of Alaska trip to Southcentral Alaska once a month.

Most Alaska Marine Highway System vessels are built for multiple-day voyages due to the large distances between ports. For example, it takes just under three days to travel from Bellingham to Skagway, and 18 hours for the Sitka to Juneau &quot;milk run&quot;. Because of this, larger vessels (MV &quot;Tustumena&quot; and larger) come with staterooms, while all mainline vessels have solariums, showers, and lounges for sleeping. Hot food services and, on the MV &quot;Columbia&quot;, a sit-down restaurant are also offered.

In July 2011 the Marine Highway began the bidding process to build the first of what they refer to as &quot;Alaska-Class Vessels&quot;, made to travel shorter routes. They would not have staterooms available for passengers. One hundred-twenty million dollars were set aside for the project, and the future ships names were selected from a contest amongst Alaska students. 

The first ferry named the MV &quot;Tazlina&quot; was delivered in August 2018 by the Vigor Shipyard in Ketchikan, AK, and the MV &quot;Hubbard&quot; was launched in June 2023. 

All current vessels are named after Alaskan glaciers.

==Retired vessels==
In addition to the current fleet, the following vessels have been retired:
* MV &quot;Bartlett&quot;
* MV &quot;Chilkat&quot;
* MV &quot;Chilkoot&quot;
* MV &quot;Taku&quot;
* MV &quot;Wickersham&quot;
* MV &quot;Chenega&quot; (fast ferry) had been laid up in Seattle, Washington, Lake Washington Ship Canal, due to service reductions. Has been sold to the Spanish company Trasmapi as of 2021.
* MV &quot;Fairweather&quot; (fast ferry) operated a variety of routes in Southeast Alaska. Has been sold to the Spanish company Trasmapi as of 2021.

==Traffic==
The AMHS carries around 350,000 passengers and 100,000 vehicles every year. In their 2008 Annual Traffic Volume Report, the Alaska Marine Highway reported moving 340,412 passengers and 109,839 vehicles; equating to the highest passenger ridership in eight years and the highest vehicle ridership in sixteen. The Ferry is very popular with summer tourists (one of the primary reasons Bellingham and Prince Rupert are AMHS destinations). Tent cities commonly sprout up on the aft of mainline vessels, and for budget travellers, the AMHS is one of the top modes of transportation to the &quot;Last Frontier&quot;. Service drops off significantly in winter. Vessels usually undergo overhauls and renovations during this period due to the decline in passenger and vehicle traffic (attributed to a lack of tourists).

<text>Mariposa Grove is a sequoia grove located near Wawona, California, United States, in the southernmost part of Yosemite National Park. It is the largest grove of giant sequoias in the park, with several hundred mature specimens. Two of its trees are among the 30 largest giant sequoias in the world. The grove attracts about one million visitors annually.

The Mariposa Grove was first visited by non-native people in 1857 when Galen Clark and Milton Mann found it. They named the grove after Mariposa County, California, where the grove is located. Abraham Lincoln signed an Act of Congress on June 30, 1864, ceding Mariposa Grove and Yosemite Valley to the state of California. Criticism of stewardship over the land led to the state&#x27;s returning the grove to federal control with the establishment of Yosemite National Park.

The grove closed on July 6, 2015, for a restoration project and reopened on June 15, 2018. The Mariposa Grove Museum is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Human Development==

Mariposa Grove&#x27;s evolution from a remote natural area to a well-integrated conservation model highlights the ongoing efforts to balance public access with ecological preservation. 

===Discovery===
In 1856, after hearing from a hunter about three massive trees similar to those recently discovered at Calaveras Grove, Galen Clark, a resident of Wawona in Yosemite, embarked on a year-long search. 
In 1857, he discovered not only the three trees but a total of 427 mature giant sequoias in what he would later name Mariposa Grove. Clark built the first permanent structure in the grove, a cabin from which he guided tourists. The site now houses the Mariposa Grove Museum.

===Tunnel Trees===
In 1881, the Yosemite Stage and Turnpike Company carved a tunnel through the Wawona Tree in Mariposa Grove, large enough to accommodate stagecoaches. The tunnel, measuring wide, high, and long, transformed the tree into a significant tourist attraction and a symbol of the grove&#x27;s colossal sequoias. Such tunnel trees became hallmark attractions of Mariposa Grove. A second tunnel tree, the California Tunnel Tree, was cut in 1895. It remains the only living tunnel tree in Mariposa Grove.

===Automobile Era===

The introduction of automobiles significantly changed tourism at Yosemite National Park. The lift of the car ban in 1913 and the construction of Highway 41 in 1933 made the park more accessible. This increased accessibility coincided with a rise in visitor numbers.

====Camp in the Big Trees====
In response to the growing number of motorists visiting the park, the Yosemite National Park Company established Camp in the Big Trees in 1919. The camp provided direct access to the giant trees, eliminating the need for the previously required 18-mile round trip from the Wawona Hotel. The camp featured cabins where visitors could stay overnight, right among the giant sequoias.

====Big Trees Lodge====
Built in 1932 to replace cabins that had collapsed under heavy snowfall, the Big Trees Lodge featured 12 guest rooms—four with private baths—along with a lounge, office, gift shop, dining room, kitchen, and a photo darkroom.. Originally intended for year-round use, the lodge operated from June to September due to heavy snowfall. It closed as a guest lodge in 1972, later served as a dormitory, and was eventually removed due to environmental concerns.

====Tram Service====
In 1969, Yosemite officials introduced trams to reduce traffic congestion around the giant sequoias, banning private vehicles in the upper grove. Each tram carried 50 passengers, offering a more sustainable way to access the trees and protect the environment. The tour, which provided visitors with headphone-guided experiences among the giant sequoias, ran until 2014 when it was discontinued as part of the restoration effort that removed the asphalt roads from the grove.

===Restoration Project===
On June 30, 2014, to mark the 150th anniversary of the Yosemite Grant Act, Mariposa Grove closed for a four-year restoration project, the largest in the park&#x27;s history. The project focused on protecting tree root systems and restoring natural water flows which had been impeded by paved roads throughout the grove. Key improvements included restoring sequoia and wetland habitats, realigning roads and trails, building a new welcome plaza, adding shuttle services, and removing commercial operations like gift shops and tram tours. When the grove reopened on June 15, 2018, a major change was the removal of private car access. Visitors now begin their journey at a welcome plaza near the park’s south entrance, taking a free shuttle on a two-mile ride to the restored grove.

==Human Impact==

===Fire Management===
Giant sequoias rely on fire for reproduction but can be destroyed by intense wildfires when suppression allows ladder fuels to accumulate. This reduces soil moisture and increases heat generated by wildfires, which can overwhelm the trees&#x27; natural resistance. In recent times, controlled burns have been key to Mariposa Grove&#x27;s ecological health, restoring the natural fire cycle disrupted by fire suppression after Anglo-American settlement. Natural fires historically occurred every one to fifteen years, and controlled burns were reintroduced in 1968 to preserve the grove.

Controlled burns have been crucial. During the 2022 Washburn Fire, they helped firefighters protect ancient sequoias, demonstrating their effectiveness in forest conservation.

===Climate Change===
Climate change is placing immense pressure on Mariposa Grove, threatening the survival of its iconic trees. From the 1930s to 1990s, large-diameter trees declined by 24% in Yosemite National Park due to water stress. This issue worsened after the 2012–2017 drought, with several sequoias dying from drought and beetle infestations. Experts predict more losses as severe droughts increase.

In 2022, an alarming sign of distress emerged in Mariposa Grove when sequoias released a massive, unprecedented crop of seeds—an event typically triggered by fire. This release was ultimately futile, as sequoia seeds can only take root in soil that has been fully exposed by fire. 

Signs of climate stress in Mariposa Grove are overshadowed by the rising number of climate-induced sequoia deaths in National Park Service-managed groves further south in the Sierra Nevada.

==Noteworthy trees==

Many trees in Mariposa Grove are named after 19th-century American figures, like conservationist Galen Clark, or for their unique characteristics, such as the Telescope and Clothespin Trees. Though the grove has never been logged, several named trees, including the Wawona Tunnel Tree and the Massachusetts Tree, have fallen due to human activity. Visitors can explore the trees via a network of trails, offering routes that range from easy to strenuous, with some accessible options.

==Structures==

===Mariposa Grove Museum===
The Mariposa Grove Museum is a historic log cabin that opened to the public in 1931. Positioned near the General Grant and General Sheridan trees, the cabin was constructed to replace an earlier structure known as the Galen Clark Cabin which had stood on the same site since the late 19th century. The original cabin, built by Galen Clark in 1858, served as a shelter for visitors and became renowned for its picturesque setting. Due to deterioration, the original cabin was replaced by the current structure, which was designed to echo the rustic style of its predecessor while incorporating modern building techniques for longevity.

The museum housed within the cabin features historic photographs and exhibits detailing the history of the Mariposa Grove and its significance. The Mariposa Grove Cabin was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978.

<text>General elections were held in the Netherlands on 6 May 1998. The elections saw the purple coalition of social democrats and liberals (left and right) strengthen its majority. Both the social democratic Labour Party (PvdA) and the conservative liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) won considerably, much at the cost of their junior coalition partner, the social liberal Democrats 66 (D66).

Political observers attributed the win to the economic performance of the coalition, including the reduction of unemployment and the budget deficit, steady growth and job creation, combined with wage freezes and trimming of the welfare state, together with a policy of fiscal restraint.

The two small left opposition parties, the green GroenLinks, and the Socialist Party, were rewarded for their &#x27;quality opposition&#x27;. The major opposition party, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), after being in opposition for the first time in its history, also lost seats, and also failed to secure the most votes in the country&#x27;s southernmost provinces North Brabant and Limburg for the first time ever. The two parties for the elderly AOV and Union 55+ and the right-wing populist CD did not return to parliament.

The formation resulted in the continuation of the Kok cabinet with the second Kok cabinet, consisting of the PvdA, VVD and D66, even though the latter was not necessary for a majority of 76 seats.

<doc id="924038" wikidata="Q230608" url="?curid=924038" title="Together (2000 film)">
<text>Together () is a Swedish comedy-drama film, which was released to cinemas in Sweden on 25 August 2000. It is Swedish director Lukas Moodysson&#x27;s second full-length film. Set in a Stockholm commune called &quot;Tillsammans&quot; (Swedish for &quot;Together&quot;) in 1975, it is a satirical view of socialist values and a bittersweet comedy. Moodysson filmed a sequel titled &quot;Together 99&quot; that was released in 2023.

==Plot==
&quot;Together&quot; is set in one of the sharehome communes that was created around Stockholm in the 1970s. Loosely led by the kind-natured Göran, who will do anything to avoid a conflict, the group spend their time arguing about left-wing politics and other more practical issues, such as whether doing the dishes is bourgeois. The sharehome&#x27;s dynamics are significantly shaken when Göran&#x27;s sister, Elisabeth, leaves her violent husband Rolf and moves in, bringing her two children Eva and Stefan.

Self-declared lesbian Anna lives in the commune with her ex-husband Lasse and their son Tet (named after the Tet offensive), who befriends Stefan. The two play games such as &quot;torture the Pinochet victim&quot; where, in the spirit of equality, they take turns at being Augusto Pinochet. Eva meanwhile befriends a lonely boy across the street named Fredrik; his family appears conventional on the surface but proves to be even more dysfunctional than the commune of which they so openly disapprove. The children are portrayed as sidelined by everyone in the film, from the new school where they are bullied to the parents who, while genuinely loving, are too busy experimenting with their own freedom to show it.

Elisabeth&#x27;s husband Rolf makes a concerted effort to clean up his act, although not before getting drunk and arrested, leaving his children stranded on a roadside after a disastrous meal in a Chinese restaurant. Further relationship problems are found with Klas, who is desperately in love with Lasse, and between Göran and his selfish and immature girlfriend, who wants the benefits of an open relationship but not the responsibilities.

The New York Times called &quot;Together&quot; &quot;A funny, graceful and immensely good-natured work&quot;, while &quot;Salon&quot; described it as &quot;The kind of picture that makes you feel that there are many good reasons to actually like mankind.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened on 87 screens in Sweden and grossed $506,479 in its opening weekend. It was number one at the box office in Sweden and grossed $6.4 million from 880,000 admissions.

<text>Hopkins Center for the Arts at Dartmouth College is located at 4 East Wheelock Street in Hanover, New Hampshire. The center, which was designed by Wallace Harrison and foreshadows his later design of Manhattan&#x27;s Lincoln Center, is the college&#x27;s cultural hub. It is home to the drama and music departments. In addition to these fields, the Hopkins Center, or the &quot;Hop&quot; as it is called by students, has a woodshop and jewelry studio which are open for use by students and the public.

==Features==
Within the Hopkins Center are Faulkner Recital Hall, Spaulding Auditorium, Warner Bentley Theater, the Moore Theater, and Alumni Hall. These are used for student performances, concerts and plays by visiting artists, and alumni and faculty meetings. Various student groups perform regularly at the Hop, including the Dartmouth College Gospel Choir, Dartmouth Dance Ensemble, the Glee Club, the Barbary Coast Jazz Ensemble, the Wind Symphony, and the Symphony Orchestra, among others. Students receive a reduced ticket price for performances. However, all events are open to the public. Tickets can be purchased at the Hop&#x27;s box office.

The center makes available several classes each term for the enrichment of students and the public. For example, the dance department usually offers classes in different styles of dance, from ballet to hip hop.

The Hop was also home to the college&#x27;s Hinman Mail Center, before being moved to the basement of the nearby Class of 1953 Commons. Each undergraduate student receives his or her own mailbox, known as a &quot;Hinman Box&quot; or &quot;HB&quot;, at the beginning of freshman year. Packages may be sent to the mail center as well.

On special occasions, events are held at the &quot;Top of the Hop&quot;, an area on the second floor of the center. The college&#x27;s president often holds catered events here to celebrate various visitors, donors, exhibits, or performances.

==History==
When the Hopkins Center opened in 1962, it was the first academic (or civic) arts center of its kind, and as such, it served as the prototype for an entire generation of such centers that has grown to encompass many hundreds over the succeeding half century. Its genesis was the promise for a new theater made in the late 1920s by then Dartmouth president Ernest Martin Hopkins to Warner Bentley, a newly recruited English faculty member with responsibility for the non-department theatre program. Various calamities intervened—the Depression, the Second World War, Korea, and Hopkins&#x27; own retirement. But when the building finally reached the construction stage in the favorable economic climate of the early 1960s, its concept had grown to include space for a new concert hall / film theater, a &quot;black box&quot; theater, music and theatre rehearsal halls, a recital hall, gallery exhibition and art storage space, arts studios, and a student workshop — and its new footprint covered four and a half acres.

An early architect&#x27;s rendering revealed a building of Georgian-style brick, matching much of the rest of the Dartmouth campus. But with the engagement of architect Wallace K. Harrison, a favorite of Dartmouth graduate and New York&#x27;s then-governor Nelson A. Rockefeller, the style moved to 1960s modern, and the arched and glassed-in front façade took on aspects that Harrison drew upon when he later designed the new Metropolitan Opera House at Lincoln Center.

The arts were not new to Dartmouth at the time. A student theatre company, the Glee Club, Handel Society Chorus, Community Symphony Orchestra, Dartmouth Film Society, and artist-in-residence programs all pre-existed—but the thought was that students would need to be drawn into the arts activity housed within the center. So, integral to its concept was the use of internal glass. Large windows looked into the theaters and design shops, practice rooms, art studios, and galleries — many of which proved impractical given the activity occurring within.

Public programs initiated by its first director, Warner Bentley, and his successor, Peter D. Smith, drew significant media coverage and made the Hopkins Center a regional and sometimes national destination. For a number of years in the mid- and late 1960s, the Hop hosted a summer Congregation of the Arts, which featured summer theatre programs, a festival orchestra and resident chamber ensembles that performed works by distinguished contemporary composers invited to residencies, exhibitions of works by artists-in-residents, and special film series. The Hop earned a reputation as a venue friendly to contemporary music that persisted for nearly two decades. In the 1970s it also initiated and hosted Celebration Northeast, an indoor / outdoor festival that was one of the first to celebrate indigenous but non–mainstream North America folk musics.

For many years the Hop remained ahead of the curve in its programming of imported events, and Peter Smith liked to joke that he was the only impresario who could fail to sell out a 900-seat hall for either Luciano Pavarotti or Bruce Springsteen — both of whom were engaged just prior to their super-stardom.

== Connections ==
The Hopkins Center is connected to the Hood Museum of Art, North America&#x27;s oldest museum in continuous operation. This is Dartmouth&#x27;s own museum, which houses both permanent collections and visiting exhibitions. After a walk through the museum, one can visit the Hood&#x27;s museum store which is located next to the Courtyard Café. Beneath the museum is Gilman Auditorium, which regularly had movie showings before the opening of Loew Auditorium in the Black Family Visual Arts Center next door.

<text>The 44th Infantry Division was a division of the United States Army National Guard from October 1920 to November 1945, when it was inactivated after Federal Service during World War II. A second 44th Infantry Division existed in the Illinois Army National Guard from 1946 until October 1954, when that division was disbanded after federal service during the Korean War.

==Formation and interwar period==
Originally named the 44th Division, it was constituted on 19 October 1920 as a National Guard division, as a result of the National Defense Act of 1920&#x27;s major expansion of the National Guard. As originally conceived, the division was to consist of National Guard units from the States of Delaware, New Jersey and New York, and was to form part of the Second Corps Area. However, only individual members of the division staff, and not any whole units, ended up being assigned to the state of Delaware. The 57th Infantry Brigade from the New Jersey National Guard and the 87th Infantry Brigade of the New York National Guard were incorporated and growth continued piecemeal as subordinate units were organized until 1940. The shoulder sleeve insignia (unit patch) of the 44th Division was approved by the Secretary of War on 5 October 1921. The division headquarters was organized and federally recognized on 26 March 1924.

The headquarters was relocated on 21 February 1925 to Newark, New Jersey, and back to Trenton on 5 October 1936. The designated mobilization training center for the 44th Division was Camp Dix, New Jersey. The division staff, composed of personnel from all three states, came together each summer to conduct joint training at the New Jersey National Guard camp at Sea Girt, also where the New Jersey elements conducted summer camp every year. The New York units held their training at Camp Smith, near Peekskill, New York. The division staff participated in the First Army command post exercise at Camp Dix in 1931 and 1934 and at Fort Devens in 1936 and 1937. The division was assembled for the first time in August 1935 when it participated in the First and Second Corps Area phase of the First Army Maneuvers at Pine Camp, New York. In 1939, the division again participated in the First Army Maneuvers, this time at Plattsburg, New York, as part of the provisional II Corps. The 44th Division’s last major training event before induction was the First Army maneuver involving the provisional I, II, and III Corps near Canton, New York, in August 1940. The division was inducted into active federal service at home stations on 16 September 1940, assigned to the II Corps, and ordered to move to Fort Dix, where it arrived on 23 September 1940. After the division’s initial train-up period, the 44th Division participated in the First Army Carolina Maneuvers near Wadesboro, North Carolina, in October–November 1941.

===Order of battle, 1939===

Italics indicates the given unit was unorganized or inactive. Immediately before the induction of the 44th Division into federal service in mid-September 1940, the 44th Tank Company was disbanded and its personnel were assigned to other units of the 44th Division Special Troops.

== World War II ==
The division was en route to New Jersey on 7 December 1941, returning to Fort Dix when news was heard of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. A regimental combat team, based on the 113th Infantry, was immediately detached from the division and attached to the Eastern Defense Command to provide ground forces for the defense of the East Coast from New York to Philadelphia. Shortly afterwards, the remainder of the division moved to Camp Claiborne, LA, where the 44th Division was reorganized and redesignated, the 44th Infantry Division on 16 February 1942.

The division was then sent to Fort Lewis Washington, where it participated in defense of the West Coast under the Western Defense Command for the remainder of 1942. In February 1943, the 44th Infantry Division, much reduced through the loss of personnel and units entered a period of rebuilding and training. After completing the &quot;D-Series&quot;, division-level training, the 44th was sent to participate in the multi-division Fourth Army #6 Louisiana Maneuvers, 7 February-3 April 1944. The division then moved to Camp Phillips, KS for its final pre-deployment preparations. The division moved by railroad to Camp Myles Standish, Massachusetts, arriving on 24–27 August 1944; departing the United States via the Boston Port of Embarkation on 5 September 1944.

=== Combat chronicle ===


The 44th Infantry Division landed in France via Cherbourg Naval Base, 15 September 1944, and trained for a month before entering combat, 18 October 1944, when it relieved the 79th Division in the vicinity of Foret de Parroy, east of Lunéville, France, to take part in the Seventh Army drive to secure several passes in the Vosges Mountains. Within 6 days, the division was hit by a heavy German counterattack, 25–26 October. The attack was repulsed and the 44th continued its active defense. On 13 November 1944, it jumped off in an attack northeast, forcing a passage through the Vosges Mountains east of Leintrey to Dossenheim, took Avricourt, 17 November, and pushed on to liberate Strasbourg, along with the 2d French Armored Division. After regrouping, the division returned to the attack, taking Ratzwiller and entering the Ensemble de Bitche in the Maginot Line. On 14 December, regiments of the 44th Division took part in assaulting major Maginot line fortifications. The division&#x27;s 71st and 324th Infantry Regiments assaulted Fort Simserhof and nearby Hottviller. After six days of fighting, the unit captured Simershof on 20 December. Displacing to defensive positions east of Sarreguemines, 21–23 December, the 44th threw back three attempted crossings by the enemy of the Blies River.

An aggressive defense of the Sarreguemines area was continued throughout February 1945 and most of March. Moving across the Rhine at Worms, 26 March, in the wake of the 3d Division, the 44th relieved the 3d, 26–27 March, and crossed the Neckar River to attack and capture Mannheim, 28–29 March. Shifting to the west bank of the Main, the division crossed that river at Gross-Auheim in early April, and engaged in a 3-week training period. Attacking 18 April, after the 10th Armored Division, the 44th took Ehingen, 23 April, crossed the Danube, and attacking southeast, took Füssen, Berg, and Wertach, in a drive on Imst, Austria. On 2 May, a group of V-2 rocket scientists that included Wernher von Braun surrendered to the 44th. Pursuing the disintegrating enemy through Fern Pass and into the Inn River valley, the 44th set up its CP at Imst on 4 May. After a short period of occupation duty, the division returned to the United States in July 1945 for retraining prior to redeployment, but the end of the Pacific war resulted in inactivation in November 1945 at Camp Chaffee, Arkansas.

<text>The Schwarze Kapelle (German for &quot;Black Orchestra&quot;) was a term used by the Gestapo to refer to a group of conspirators in Nazi Germany, including many senior officers in the Wehrmacht, who plotted to overthrow Adolf Hitler. Unlike the &quot;Rote Kapelle&quot; (Red Orchestra), the name given by the Gestapo to the Soviet spy network in the Third Reich, many members of the &quot;Black Orchestra&quot; were of aristocratic background, felt contempt for the ideology of the Nazi Party, and were politically close to the Western Allies.

==Activities==
The members of &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; included many in the higher echelons of the Wehrmacht (the &quot;regular&quot; German army) and Abwehr (military intelligence). Drawn heavily from the aristocracy, they feared Hitler&#x27;s policies would ruin their country and hoped overthrowing the Nazi Party would preserve their vision of Germany. Members utilized the Abwehr, headed by top-ranking conspirator Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, to regularly communicate with their counterparts in Britain, other Allied nations, and various neutrals.

Elements of the &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; began making overtures to Britain before war broke out and Hitler could have been easily ousted or killed. British officials asserted they would not interfere with German internal affairs at that time. Many hard feelings remained among them from the First World War, exacerbated by Hitler&#x27;s occupation of the Germanic Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia six months after the Munich Agreement. Moreover, Britain&#x27;s covert apparatus had been burned in the Venlo Incident, losing two SIS (MI6) officers—including Sigismund Payne Best, who had extensive knowledge of British espionage on the continent—to supposed &quot;discontented conservatives&quot; who were actually German SD counterintelligence operatives.

Although Hitler had built Germany into the world&#x27;s most dominant power, the conspirators were afraid his hubris would eventually bring harm to their Fatherland. Allied officials shied from any suggestions of a negotiated peace, refusing to recognize German wartime gains. Many were also reluctant to accept the credibility of the &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, believing it to be a front for the Gestapo. Thus the Allies encouraged its members to act but were not willing to promise anything in return. This reticence was to significantly hamper the German opposition to Hitler throughout the entire war.

By September 1938 the &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; had devised plans for a coup to take place whenever the Munich Agreement was abrogated, as they anticipated Hitler would. The plotters believed Britain would deny Germany the Sudetenland, Germany would start a war it was sure to lose, which they sought to avoid. When Chamberlain stalled for time so that Britain could rearm, Germany had a free hand, there was no invasion, and the coup plans evaporated. Had the coup succeeded, Hitler was to have been shot &quot;resisting arrest.&quot; With a successful annexation of the Sudetenland Hitler instead rose to his highest esteem yet; under the circumstances, no coup could possibly win the support of the German military, let alone the German people. The conspirator in charge of the plot, Chief of Staff of the Army High Command (OKH) Franz Halder, called it off.

The &quot;Schwarz Kapelle&#x27;s&quot; plans for a provisional government were reconsidered a year later, in October–November 1939, when Hitler planned a November 12 autumn attack through the neutral Low Countries into France. Many on the General Staff thought it would be a military disaster at that time of year. Other high-ranking officers had been outraged at the barbarities being reported out of Poland. Once again Halder was in charge. After a meeting between Commander-in-Chief Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch and Hitler at the very time of the planned coup, 13:30 on November 5, 1939, Halder misunderstood a reference Hitler made to the OKH headquarters as the &quot;spirit of Zossen&quot; and feared the conspirators had been found out. He called off the plan and had all documents burned.

There had been enough support from high-level military commanders during both the 1938 and 1939 plots that the chief conspirator, Abwehr head Admiral Canaris, was able to propose preventing the war to Britain as an outcome of the first, and surrender in the second. The British, however, were never really on board either time, undermining the conspirators&#x27; confidence in pursuing treason each time. Further, the plotters were never confident that Germany would be treated fairly by Britain in any successful coup, as opposed to 1919 and Versailles. High ranking conspirators in the Wehrmacht, who were central to any coup attempt, also feared they would be seen as traitors if Germany did not receive favorable terms after replacing Hitler.

Following the spectacular success of Hitler&#x27;s invasion plan for France, both German public opinion and support of and in the German military solidified behind the &quot;Fuhrer&quot;. Still, the &quot;Schwarz Kapelle&quot; maintained its efforts to overthrow Hitler and seek a negotiated peace with its enemies. The disastrous September 1941 stall and subsequent total failure of Hitler&#x27;s plan to invade and conquer the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa, renewed the conspirator&#x27;s hopes. Fallow times, however, dominated their dealings until 1943.

When Roosevelt announced at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943 that the Allies would accept nothing less than unconditional surrender, an approving Churchill and others realized this would force the Germans to fight &quot;like rats.&quot; Canaris also grasped this demand would probably doom his efforts to recruit supporters among the German generals.

On March 13, 1943, Colonel Henning von Tresckow had his adjutant, Fabian von Schlabrendorff, place a time bomb aboard Hitler&#x27;s plane on March 13, 1943, right after the disaster of Stalingrad, but it failed to go off, despite their testing and retesting the fuses.

Throughout the rest of 1943 and into the first half of 1944 the Allies continued their gains in the Mediterranean Theatre and massed men and materiel for a European invasion along the French channel coastline. The conspirators began to organize for another attempt to assassinate Hitler and take over both German civil government and its military.

===The von Stauffenberg bomb attempt and aftermath===
By the summer of 1944 unrest in the German military and diplomatic ranks was widespread. The Allied landing at Normandy in June and failed German response raised the specter of doom among the upper ranks even of German field marshals. The &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; responded by organizing a deadly attempt on Hitler&#x27;s life at his Wolf&#x27;s Lair compound in East Prussia. Undertaken by an aristocratic member of a hereditarily military family, Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, the July 20 Plot nearly succeeded. Although surrounded by fatalities from the bomb Hitler escaped with a concussion and various injuries.

In the aftermath he was determined to get vengeance upon the plotters. The Gestapo rounded up the members of the &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; and many, many more it believed were either implicated in or sympathetic to it; according to its records it put 7,000 of them to death. Stauffenberg and three others were summarily shot that night. Most of the conspirators were put on trial in the &quot;Volksgerichtshof&quot; (People&#x27;s Court) between August 1944 to February 1945. Many were executed the day after their convictions by hanging from meat hooks at Plötzensee Prison. Architect of the 1943 bomb plot on Hitler&#x27;s plane Fabian von Schlabrendorff only escaped death because an Allied bomb fell on the court as he was being led in, killing presiding officer Roland Freisler and destroying most of the court and investigation records.

So widespread was the terror and prosecution that even some of the highest ranking generals of the German military who had not been direct members of the &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot; but merely knew of the coup attempt in advance through them and supported it - such as Field Marshalls Erwin Rommel and Gunther von Kluge - were swept to their deaths. Von Kluge, Supreme Commander of German forces in the West, was deposed by Hitler on August 16, 1944, a day after he was suspected of seeking a surrender to the Allies, and took cyanide en route to Berlin to avoid hanging via the People&#x27;s Court; Rommel, hero of the Desert Campaign, architect of Atlantic Wall, and the popular choice to replace Hitler, was forced to take cyanide by him to prevent retributions being taken against his family.

Admiral Canaris and his deputy, Hans Oster, the top two figures in German military intelligence, were not tried until February 1945, and not executed until April 9, 1945, when Germany&#x27;s defeat was already certain. Their deaths were particularly grisly, by slow strangulation.

<text>Algeria elects on the national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. The president is elected for a five-year term by the people. People&#x27;s National Assembly (&quot;Assemblée Populaire Nationale&quot;) has 407 members, elected for a five-year term in multi-seat constituencies by proportional representation. Eight seats in the national assembly are reserved for Algerians abroad. The Council of the Nation (&quot;Conseil de la nation&quot;) has 144 members, 96 members elected by communal councils and 48 members appointed by the president. 

Algeria has a multi-party system, with numerous political parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. 

According to the U.S Department of State, the elections are well organized and conducted without significant problems or irregularities, but they noted restrictions on civil liberties during the election period and lack of transparency in vote-counting procedures. 

Until 12 November 2008, presidents were limited to two terms; on this date, amendments to the constitution were passed which removed the term limits. Term limits were later reinstated in the 2016 constitution reform by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika.

The last legislative election was held on 12 June 2021.

<doc id="924070" wikidata="Q212214" url="?curid=924070" title="Amalfi Coast">
<text>The Amalfi Coast ( or ) is a stretch of coastline in southern Italy overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno. It is located south of the Sorrentine Peninsula and north of the Cilentan Coast.

Attracting international tourists of all classes annually, the Amalfi Coast was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997. Atrani and Vietri sul Mare are marketed as (&quot;The most beautiful villages of Italy&quot;).

==History==

During the 10th–11th centuries, the Duchy of Amalfi existed on the territory of the Amalfi Coast, centred in the town of Amalfi. The Amalfi coast was later controlled by the Principality of Salerno until Amalfi was sacked by the Republic of Pisa in 1137.

==Geography==

Like the rest of the region, the Amalfi Coast has a Mediterranean climate, featuring warm summers and mild winters. It is located on the relatively steep southern shore of the Sorrentine Peninsula, leaving little room for rural and agricultural development. The only land route to the Amalfi Coast is the long Amalfi Drive (Strada Statale 163) which runs along the coastline from the town of Vietri sul Mare in the east to Positano in the west. Thirteen municipalities are located on the Amalfi Coast, many of them centred on tourism.

===Municipalities===

==Economy==
The Amalfi Coast is known for its production of limoncello liqueur, made between February and October from lemon (known as &quot;sfusato amalfitano&quot; in Italian) grown in terraced gardens along the entire coastline. Another typical liqueur is concerto (literally, &quot;concert&quot;, derived from the mix of herbs that compose it), a dark rosolio with spicy notes typically produced in Tramonti. Amalfi is also a known maker of a hand-made thick paper called &quot;bambagina&quot;, symbolic of Italy&#x27;s traditional technique for paper production and historically used for private writings, legal acts, and revenue stamps. Other notable local products are a particular kind of anchovy (local Italian: &quot;alici&quot;) from Cetara and the colourful handmade ceramics from Vietri.

==Transport==
Buses and ferries run along the Amalfi Coast, as well as boat excursions from Positano and Amalfi.

===Airport===
The Salerno Costa d&#x27;Amalfi Airport is the most proximal airport to the coast, however, Naples International Airport (Napoli-Capodichino) serves the main international gateway airport to reach the area from abroad.

==In popular culture==

The natural beauty and picturesque landscapes of the Amalfi Coast have made it one of the most popular destinations of the world&#x27;s jet set, earning it the nickname of &quot;Divine Coast&quot; (&quot;Divina costiera&quot;).

The rulers of Amalfi are the central figures in John Webster&#x27;s Jacobean tragedy &quot;The Duchess of Malfi&quot;. The Dutch artist M. C. Escher produced a number of artworks of the Amalfi coast, and Spike Milligan describes his time in Amalfi during a period of leave in the fourth part of his war memoirs, &quot;&quot;.

The Amalfi Coast was used for scenes of Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Roma&quot; and for the 2017 American superhero film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;, where it was depicted as the Amazon island of Themyscira.

The Amalfi Coast serves as a setting for fictional racetracks in the &quot;Forza Motorsport 3&quot;, &quot;Forza Motorsport 4&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo 4&quot;. It also plays host to the fictional town of Sapienza in Hitman.

The city of Positano is featured in John Steinbeck&#x27;s 1953 short story &quot;Positano&quot;. The city is also featured in &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;, Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Tenet&quot; and the Kath and Kim movie &quot;Kath &amp; Kimderella&quot;.

<doc id="924077" wikidata="Q2816821" url="?curid=924077" title="43rd Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 43rd Infantry Division was a formation of the United States Army from 1920 to 1963, serving in the Pacific during World War II. It was activated in 1920 as a National Guard Division in Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The 143rd Regional Support Group of the Connecticut National Guard now carries on the heritage.

==Creation and interwar period==
The 1920 amendments to the National Defense Act of 1916 provided for eighteen National Guard divisions. Seventeen National Guard divisions had served in the First World War; the 42nd &quot;Rainbow&quot; Division was not reconstituted after the war, and the 39th &quot;Delta&quot; Division was eliminated from the force structure in 1923 by being renamed the 31st Division. The 43rd, 44th, and 45th Divisions were constituted as new units. The 43rd Division was allotted as the National Guard division for the New England states of Connecticut, Maine, Rhode Island, and Vermont; units from these states had previously belonged to the 26th Division, which became a Massachusetts-only outfit.

The 43rd Infantry Division was constituted in the National Guard on 19 October 1920, allotted to the First Corps Area, and assigned to the I Corps, with the division headquarters being organized and federally recognized in Hartford, Connecticut, on 21 March 1925. The 43rd Division consisted of two infantry brigades, the 85th in Connecticut, and the 86th in Vermont. The 85th Infantry Brigade included the 102nd and 169th Infantry Regiment, both based in Connecticut. The 86th Infantry Brigade was made up of the 172nd Infantry Regiment in Vermont and the 103rd Infantry in Maine. In addition, the 68th Field Artillery Brigade was based in Providence, Rhode Island.
The division staff, composed of personnel from all four states, came together each summer to conduct joint training, usually held at the Connecticut State Camp military area near Niantic. The staff participated in the First Army command post exercises at Camp Dix, New Jersey, in 1931 and 1934, and at Fort Devens, Massachusetts, in 1936 and 1937. From 1922 to 1939, the division&#x27;s subordinate units generally held separate summer camps at locations within their respective states: Connecticut units at Niantic; Rhode Island units at Quonset Point; Maine units at Camp Keyes, near Augusta; and Vermont units at Fort Ethan Allen. The division was assembled in one place for the first time at Fort Devens in June 1930. During that camp, training was conducted at the squad and platoon level due to the relative inexperience of the units’ soldiers. The next opportunity for the 43rd Division to function as a complete unit came in August 1935 when it participated in the First and Second Corps Area phase of the First Army maneuvers at Pine Camp, New York. In 1939, the “Winged Victory” Division again participated in the First Army maneuvers, this time at Plattsburg, New York, as part of the provisional I Corps. The 43rd Division&#x27;s last major training event before induction was the First Army maneuvers near Canton, New York, in August 1940. The division was relieved from the I Corps on 30 December 1940 and assigned to the IV Corps. It was inducted into federal service at home stations on 24 February 1941 and ordered to move to Camp Blanding, Florida, where it arrived on 13 March 1941. After the division&#x27;s initial train-up period, it participated in the IV Corps Louisiana Maneuvers in August 1941, in the GHQ maneuvers near Bellwood, Louisiana, in September 1941, and in the First Army Carolina Maneuvers near Peachland-Camden, in October–November 1941.

==World War II==
The 43rd Division was mobilized for federal service on 24 February 1941. The 43rd was originally sent to Camp Blanding, Florida where it was based prior to participating in the Louisiana Maneuvers of 1941 and the Carolina Maneuvers later that same year. The division relocated to Camp Shelby, Mississippi on 14 February 1942. On 19 February 1942, it was reorganized as a &quot;triangular&quot; division meaning that it had three infantry regiments, rather than four infantry regiments organized into two brigades.

The division staged for shipment overseas at Fort Ord, California, on 6 September 1942 and departed San Francisco on 1 October. The division arrived in New Zealand on 23 October 1942, prior to being committed to combat in the South West Pacific Theater under the command of General Douglas MacArthur.

===Combat chronicle===

The 43rd Infantry Division landed in New Zealand on 23 October 1942. The 172nd Infantry Regiment arrived at Espiritu Santo, 26 October.

The division moved to Noumea, New Caledonia, in November and to Guadalcanal, 17 February 1943. The Russell Islands were occupied without opposition, 21 February, and training continued. Elements landed on Vangunu and Rendova Islands against minor resistance, 30 June.

Rendova served as the major staging point for the assault on the island of New Georgia. The assault on New Georgia was met with determined enemy resistance. The Japanese fought fiercely before relinquishing Munda and its airfield, 5 August. Vela Cela and Baanga were taken easily, but the Japanese resisted stubbornly on Arundel Island before withdrawing, 22 September.

After training at Munda, the 43rd moved to Guadalcanal and thence to New Zealand for rest and rehabilitation. On 19 July 1944, the division was deployed to the Aitape-Wewak campaign, assuming defensive positions at Aitape. It engaged in patrols and reconnaissance at Tadji and along the Drinumor River, 25 July, and took the offensive, 8 August 1944, ending organized resistance on the 25th. On 9 January 1945, the 43rd made an assault landing in the San Fabian area, Lingayen Gulf, Luzon. Under enemy fire, the Division secured the beachhead and fought into the Lingayen Plain by 12 February. The offensive was resumed against the enemy north and west of Fort Stotsenburg, 27 February. After ending Japanese resistance in the Zambales Mountains with help from the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary, the 43rd swung south against the Shimbu Line. On 6 May 1945, the attack continued in the Bulacan area. Ipo Dam was secured and enemy opposition smashed in the Ipo area, 19 May. Mopping-up activities continued until 30 June 1945. The Division left Manila, 7 September 1945, and arrived in Yokohama, Japan on 13 September for occupation duty. The division began preparations for departure for home on 27 September 1945, and officially began their departure on 29 September. The first ship arrived in San Francisco on 8 October 1945, three years and seven days after the first ship had left on 1 October 1942. The division troops were then moved to Camp Stoneman near Pittsburg, California, and arrangements were made to send each man to the Army separation center nearest his home.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 6,026
*Killed in action: 1,128
*Wounded in action: 4,887
*Missing in action: 9
*Prisoner of war: 2

==Post World War II (1946–1963)==

In 1946 the Division was reorganized again, and was now made up of units from Connecticut, Vermont and Rhode Island. The 172d Infantry with the 206th Field Artillery Battalion were based in Vermont. The division headquarters, 102d and 169th Infantry Regiments, and 963d Field Artillery and 192d Field Artillery were organized in Connecticut. In addition, Connecticut was also home to the 143d Tank Battalion. Rhode Island was home to Headquarters, 43d Division Artillery; the 103d Field Artillery Battalion; the 118th Engineer Battalion; and the 43d Signal Company. Combat Support units were based throughout all three states.

During the Korean War, the 43d Division was again ordered into active Federal Service on 5 September 1950 and was moved to Seventh United States Army, VII Corps in West Germany in 1951. On 15 June 1954, the 43d Infantry Division was released and returned to state control. Its elements, stationed in the Augsburg/Munich area, were reflagged as the units of the 5th Infantry Division. Division elements in the Nuernberg Area such as the 169th Infantry Regiment became units of the 9th Infantry Division. The 169th Infantry reflagged as the 39th Infantry Regiment.

The 43d Infantry Division was inactivated on 1 May 1963 as a result of National Guard restructuring. Its headquarters was reorganized as Headquarters Company, 43rd Brigade, 26th Infantry Division. The 43rd Brigade was relieved from assignment to the 26th Division on 1 September 1993, when the 26th Division was inactivated. It was then reorganized as Headquarters Company, 43rd Infantry Brigade, and now is organized as the Headquarters Company, 143d Regional Support Group.

==Recognition==

<doc id="924079" wikidata="Q16105989" url="?curid=924079" title="Jim Lonborg">
<text>James Reynold Lonborg (born April 16, 1942) is an American former professional baseball right-handed starting pitcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Boston Red Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, and Philadelphia Phillies. Though nicknamed &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;, he was known for fearlessly pitching on the inside of the plate throughout his fifteen-year career.

== Early life ==
Lonborg was born on April 16, 1942, in Santa Maria, California. His father was a professor of agriculture. Lonborg attended San Luis Obispo High School in San Luis Obispo, California, where he excelled in both baseball and basketball. One of his teammates was future major league pitcher Mel Queen, who would also become his brother-in-law.

He attended Stanford University as a pre-med student on an academic scholarship, graduating in 1963. He pitched on the school&#x27;s baseball team as a walk-on, and was its MVP as a junior. He was a walk-on player on the basketball team as well, but did not see a future as there was a star player ahead of him. He has been inducted into Stanford&#x27;s Athletics Hall of Fame as a baseball player.

During his college years, the Baltimore Orioles had an interest in Lonborg, and he played as an amateur on teams sponsored by the Orioles during his college career. In 1963, he played in the Basin League for the Oriole-sponsored Winner Pheasants, along with future Oriole hall of fame pitcher Jim Palmer, and future Oriole player and .300 hitter Merv Rettenmund.

On August 14, 1963, he signed as an amateur free agent with the Boston Red Sox. The Red Sox had offered him a much higher signing bonus than the Orioles.

==Professional baseball career==
Longborg spent only one year in the Red Sox minor league system (1964) before being called up to the team in 1965. In his rookie year for Boston, Lonborg had a 9–17 win loss record and 4.47 earned run average (ERA). In 1966, he improved his record to 10–10, and his ERA to 3.86.

In the 1967 Red Sox&#x27; &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; season, Lonborg tied for the American League (AL) lead for pitchers in wins (22) and games started (39), and led the AL in strikeouts (246). He also led the league in hitting batters (19), after his pitching style changed under the tutelage of pitching coach Sal &quot;The Barber&quot; Maglie.

That year, the Red Sox were involved in a four-way race for the AL pennant with the Detroit Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox; the race was reduced to three teams after the White Sox lost a doubleheader to the Kansas City Athletics, on September 27. The Red Sox and Twins faced each other in the season&#x27;s final series and entered the final day (October 1) tied for first place; the Tigers were half a game out of first and needed to sweep a doubleheader from the California Angels to force a playoff between the winner of the Red Sox–Twins game. Lonborg outdueled Twins ace Dean Chance in that finale, while the Tigers defeated the Angels in the first game but lost the second, putting the Red Sox in the World Series for the first time since .

In that World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, Lonborg pitched a one-hit shutout in Game 2 on October 5, only the fourth one-hitter in Series history. He followed that up with another victory in Game 5 four days later by limiting the Cards to three hits, and pitching a complete game again. Longborg&#x27;s boyhood idol Sandy Koufax was calling the World Series as a television broadcaster, and gave Longborg game preparation advice on visualizing himself pitching, that aided Longborg&#x27;s success in his two victories.

Called upon to pitch the seventh and deciding game with only two days rest, he lasted six innings, but allowed six earned runs in a 7–2 loss. Teammate Dan Osinski remembered, &quot;Lonborg couldn&#x27;t break a pane of glass in the bullpen when he was warming up. We all knew that, and [Dick Williams] still started him. You know he could have pitched the bullpen an inning apiece, or something. It just gave Gibson too big a lead against us that we couldn&#x27;t come back from.&quot; Shortly after being fired by the Red Sox, pitching coach Sal Maglie also criticized Williams&#x27;s handling of Lonborg. &quot;It was obvious Lonborg didn&#x27;t have it. Williams should have gotten him out sooner, and I told him so. It was a crime that he let a man who&#x27;d done such a great job for him all season take a pounding like that. It was degrading.&quot;

Lonborg received the Cy Young Award, with 90% of the votes, (becoming the first Red Sox pitcher so honored). He was selected to the 1967 AL All-Star team, though he did not play in the All-Star Game, and finished prominently in voting for the MLB Most Valuable Player (MVP) award (placing 6th in the voting, with teammate Yastrzemski winning the award).
In December of 1967, Lonborg tore the ligaments in his left knee while skiing, and his pitching career thereafter was marked by many injuries. In trying to compensate for his knee injury, he developed right shoulder problems that lasted the remainder of his career. After pitching 273.1 innings in 1967, he never threw more than 167.2 innings in a season over the next four years with the Red Sox, and won only 27 games from through 1971. In both 1970 and 1971, he spent time with the Triple-A Louisville Colonels while trying to recover from his injuries and to regain his pitching form, and he finished the 1971 season with the Red Sox going 10–7, his best record since 1967. It would not be until 1976, years after leaving Boston, that Lonborg&#x27;s right shoulder would be pain free.

Lonborg was traded along with George Scott, Ken Brett, Billy Conigliaro, Joe Lahoud and Don Pavletich to the Milwaukee Brewers in a ten-player trade that also sent Tommy Harper, Marty Pattin, Lew Krausse and minor-league outfielder Pat Skrable to the Red Sox on October 10, 1971. In 1972, he had his second best season to date, with at 14–12 record, 2.83 ERA, and 143 strikeouts in 223 innings for the Brewers. His success was in part attributable to pitching coach Wes Stock, who changed Lonborg from a power pitcher into one who relied on control and change of speed.

With the Philadelphia Phillies needing to improve its pitching staff beyond Steve Carlton, a future hall of fame pitcher and 329 game winner, both Lonborg and Brett were acquired along with Ken Sanders and Earl Stephenson from the Brewers for Don Money, John Vukovich and Bill Champion on October 31, 1972. Like Stock, Phillies pitching coach Ray Rippelmeyer suggested adjustments that improved Lonborg&#x27;s pitching significantly. Lonborg spent the next six and a half seasons with Philadelphia before his release midway through the 1979 season. In 1974, he was 17–13 with a 3.21 ERA, leading the Phillies starting pitchers (including Carlton) in wins and ERA; and in 1976 Lonborg was 18–10 with a 3.08 ERA, second among starting pitchers in wins (Carlton had 20), and first in ERA. The Phillies reached the NL championship series in 1976 and 1977, losing both times. Lonborg pitched one game in each series, losing each. The Phillies lost the NL championship again in 1978, but Lonborg did not appear in the playoffs.

Lonborg&#x27;s MLB career statistical totals include a 157–137 record with 1,475 strikeouts, a 3.86 ERA, 90 complete games, 15 shutouts, and innings pitched in 425 games. Lonborg was selected to the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002.

Longborg&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot;.

==Post-baseball career==
After retiring, Lonborg attended the Tufts University School of Dental Medicine, and graduated in 1983 and began practicing. He worked as a general dentist in Hanover, Massachusetts, until he retired in 2017. He is active in many nonprofit organizations, including Catholic Charities, Little League Baseball, and The Jimmy Fund, as well as the Susan G. Komen foundation and those seeking to treat cystic fibrosis. Lonborg lives in Scituate, Massachusetts.

On the Boston-based sitcom &quot;Cheers&quot;, the photo of Sam Malone pitching is actually that of Lonborg. At times, Sam also wore Lonborg&#x27;s number 16 Red Sox jersey.

<text>Léon Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle (; 15 June 1906 – 31 March 1994) was a Belgian Walloon politician and Nazi collaborator. He rose to prominence in Belgium in the 1930s as the leader of the Rexist Party (Rex). During the German occupation of Belgium during World War II, he enlisted in the German army and fought in the Walloon Legion on the Eastern Front. After the collapse of the Nazi regime, Degrelle escaped and went into exile in Francoist Spain, where he remained a prominent figure in neo-Nazi politics.

Degrelle was raised Roman Catholic and during his years at university became involved in politics through journalism. In the early 1930s, he took control of a Catholic publishing house that morphed under his leadership into the Rexist Party. Rex contested the 1936 Belgian general election and won 11 percent of the vote, but slipped into irrelevance by the start of World War II. Degrelle began to collaborate with Nazi Germany as the war began and was detained by Belgian and then French authorities. After the German invasion of Belgium in mid-1940, Degrelle was released and began to change Rex into a mass movement to curry the favor of the Nazis. In 1941, Degrelle organized and himself joined and fought in the Walloon Legion, a unit of the German Army and, after 1943, the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot;. His performance in 1944 at the Cherkassy pocket and subsequent decorations turned him into a model for foreign collaborators.

Following the liberation of Belgium in late 1944, Degrelle was stripped of his citizenship and was sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot;. Early the next year, he fled to Spain, where with the help of the Spanish government he went into hiding from Belgian authorities in August 1946. In the 1960s, Degrelle returned to public life as a neo-Nazi and gained great influence in far-right European circles. He published several books and papers glorifying the Nazi regime and denying the Holocaust.

==Early life==
Léon Degrelle was born on 15 June 1906 in Bouillon, in the Belgian province of Luxembourg, and baptized five days later as Léon Joseph Marie Ignace Degrelle. He was the fifth child of Marie Boever and . 

Édouard, who came from the French Ardennes, later claimed that he had emigrated to Belgium as a result of the introduction of secularism in France. He made a career as a brewer and became a naturalized citizen before World War I. He was elected to the provincial council of Luxembourg for the first time in 1904 and became a respected conservative politician as a member of the Catholic Party. Marie came from a local bourgeois family whose father had been involved in the founding of the newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Avenir du Luxembourg&quot;.

The Degrelle family was highly religious; as a child, Léon attended Mass every day and attended a preschool run by the Sisters of Christian Doctrine of Nancy. He completed secondary schooling at the Institut Saint-Pierre de Bouillon. From there, he enrolled at the Collège Notre-Dame de la Paix, in Namur, where he read and subscribed to the ideas of Léon Bloy, Charles Péguy, Léon Daudet, and especially Charles Maurras. Degrelle next enrolled at the Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix in Namur to study law. There, however, he became active in clericalist political activism to the detriment of his studies, which he abandoned in 1925 after failing his exams that year.

==Journalistic career, 1927–1935==
Shortly after his failure at Namur, Degrelle was admitted into the prestigious Catholic University of Leuven, which awarded him a diploma of candidacy in philosophy and literature on 27 July 1927. That year, Degrelle joined (&quot;Action catholique de la jeunesse belge&quot;, ACJB), a militant clerical youth organization founded by the priest Louis Picard, whom Degrelle had met while studying in Namur. Again preoccupied with activism and reading, Degrelle was a poor student but encountered some professional success as the director of the student newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Avant-Garde&quot;. At this time, Degrelle also began a successful career as a writer and published several books from 1927 to 1930.

Impressed by Degrelle, Picard encouraged him to become involved in journalism within the ACJB from 1927. The next year, Degrelle began writing pro-monarchy, clericalist pamphlets whose wide circulation brought Degrelle to the attention of &quot;Abbé&quot; Norbert Wallez, another Catholic priest and an admirer of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who worked as a newspaper director. Degrelle accepted an offer from Wallez to become an editor at his newspaper &quot;Le XXe Siècle&quot;. In 1929, with Wallez&#x27;s support, Degrelle traveled to Mexico to report on the Cristero War, a rebellion of Mexican Catholics against the incumbent anti-clerical government. On returning to Belgium, Degrelle dropped out of Leuven after failing to attend the exams for his &quot;doctorat de troisième cycle&quot;.

In October 1930, Degrelle was asked by the ACJB to take over the management of &quot;Christus Rex&quot;, a small Catholic publishing house named after the popular youth cult of Christ the King. He accepted, staffed it with young radical Catholic students, started publishing mass-circulation magazines, and, having achieved success with these magazines, expanded its catalog with new periodicals over the next three years. In the same period, he popularized a pair of Marian apparitions at Banneux and Beauraing. He produced leaflets and posters for the Catholic Party ahead of the 1932 election, earning &quot;Christus Rex&quot; and Degrelle many conservative allies. From January 1931, with Picard&#x27;s support as chair of the board of directors, Degrelle and his father purchased controlling stakes in the business. Léon assumed total control of &quot;Christus Rex&quot; by 1933 and used the platform to attack the leadership of the Catholic Party.

After the 1932 election, Degrelle began to refer to &quot;Christus Rex&quot; as a nationalistic, pro-clerical political movement, which alienated the officially apolitical ACJB. In 1933, the Catholic Party cut its ties with Degrelle, as did the ACJB the following year. To avoid insolvency, Degrelle downsized &quot;Christus Rex&quot;″s staff and obeyed a command from the Bishop of Tournai to cancel a rally in Charleroi to avoid further clashes with the Catholic establishment. Over the interwar years, however, Belgian Catholic politics had split between that Catholic establishment and an authoritarian and radically clerical faction of urban, middle class students who viewed the Catholic Party as being weak and complacent. By 1936, Degrelle, who proved to be a charismatic speaker, had become highly influential amongst the latter group.

==Political activism and Rex, 1935–1940==
In early 1935, Degrelle morphed &quot;Christus Rex&quot; into the Rexist Party (Rex), an authoritarian, populist, and strongly clerical faction of francophone Catholic student radicals such as José Streel, Jean Denis, and . Rex&#x27;s first meeting as a political organization, modeled on Italian fascist meetings, was held on 1 May 1935. There, Degrelle declared that Rex desired to reform the Catholic Party. To that end, on 2 November 1935, in an event dubbed the Kortrijk Coup (&quot;coup de Courtrai&quot;), Degrelle and a party of Rexists interrupted a meeting of Catholic Party leaders at Kortrijk. He denounced the party leaders as corrupt and ineffective, and demanded their resignations. The party leadership responded by expelling Degrelle from the Catholic Party on 6 November, and on 20 November Cardinal Jozef-Ernest van Roey forbade the fraternization of any Catholic priest with Rex. In response, on 23 February 1936, Degrelle announced that Rex would run in the 1936 Belgian general election, the results of which would be announced on 24 May, and on 3 May launched a hastily-organized newspaper, &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot;, to serve as Rex&#x27;s mouthpiece.

Rex, which ran on a populist, middle-class, and anti-democratic platform that united several right-wing elements such as anti-communists and war veterans, won 11.5% of the votes cast and 21 of the 202 seats in the Chamber of Representatives. This was a ringing defeat of the Catholic Party, which lost much of its previous constituency to Rex in the form of protest votes. Degrelle sought to capitalize on Rex&#x27;s victory by establishing a party bureaucracy and holding rallies. He also continued to attack the &quot;rotten ones&quot; (&quot;pourris&quot;) whom he alleged dominated Belgium&#x27;s political and economic establishment. At the prompting of the dissident Catholic politician Gustave Sap, Degrelle publicly revealed a series of what he termed &quot;politico-financial scandals&quot; (&quot;scandales politico-financières&quot;), apparently demonstrating collusion between &quot;high finance&quot; and the incumbent government of the former banker Paul Van Zeeland.

Following the election, Degrelle formed alliances with far-right francophone Belgian groups, then traveled to Italy to meet representatives of the Italian National Fascist Party and received subsidies from them. On 26 September 1936, he met with Joseph Goebbels and Adolf Hitler in Germany to establish relations with the Nazi Party. In October, Degrelle returned to Belgium, met secretly with the Flemish National League (&quot;Vlaamsch Nationaal Verbond&quot;, VNV), a Flemish nationalist political party, and agreed to collaborate in the formation of a corporatist state with an autonomous Flanders. He then announced a march of Rexists on the capital, Brussels, for 25 October, inspired by Mussolini&#x27;s 1922 March on Rome. The government banned the demonstration on 22 October and, with the erosion of Rex&#x27;s alliances and image caused by their meetings with the VNV and the Nazis, the march fizzled.

In March 1937, Alfred Olivier, who had been among the Rexists elected to the Chamber of Representatives, resigned with his staff. Degrelle ran in the snap election in Brussels to determine his replacement, hoping to spark a chain of by-elections until he could force King Leopold III to call for another general election. The rhetoric and aftermath of the 1936 campaign had, however, inspired Belgian politics to form a united front against Rex to defend democracy. In the election, held on 11 April 1937, Van Zeeland personally ran against Degrelle as the candidate of the governing center-left coalition and defeated him with 76% of the votes cast. Degrelle&#x27;s momentum was decisively broken, and though he provoked Van Zeeland&#x27;s resignation in October 1937 after accusing him of receiving financial support from the National Bank of Belgium, Rex&#x27;s membership withered and its fortunes at the polls continued to decline; in the 1939 general election, Rex received only 4.4% of the popular vote. As the 1930s drew to a close, Rex rapidly transformed into a fascist movement and included increasingly antisemitic rhetoric in its publications.

==War and German occupation, 1940–1945==

At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Belgium declared its neutrality, which Rex vociferously supported. Degrelle additionally blamed the war on Britain, France, and &quot;the occult forces of Freemasonry and the Jewish finance&quot;, precipitating a further decay of Rex&#x27;s membership and reputation. In January 1940, Degrelle secretly and unsuccessfully requested German funding for a new, pro-neutrality newspaper. Amid the German invasion of Belgium on 10 May 1940, Degrelle was detained by the Belgian government, as were other Rexist leaders not enlisted in the Belgian Army such as Victor Matthys and Serge Doring.

Degrelle was first imprisoned in Bruges, then was transferred to French custody on 15 May 1940 and interrogated at Dunkirk, and then moved to the Camp Vernet internment camp in southern France as the military situation deteriorated amid the Battle of France. Leopold III surrendered at the head of the Belgian Army on 28 May and became a prisoner of war, while France sought an armistice a month later. In German-occupied Belgium, Degrelle was assumed to have been executed. On 22 July, Rexist journalist Pierre Daye discovered Degrelle in Carcassonne with the assistance of Otto Abetz, a German diplomat Degrelle had met in 1936. Daye and Degrelle arrived in Paris on 25 July and were invited to dinner with Abetz, with whom Degrelle spoke at length about expanding Belgium at the expense of France and the Netherlands.

===Return to German-occupied Belgium===
Degrelle returned to Brussels on 30 July, and found that Belgium had been placed under a military administration and that Rex had been reorganized and had formed a militia known as the Combat Formations (&quot;Formations de Combat&quot;). Degrelle began reasserting his leadership, attempting to establish contact with German leadership through Abetz, and adopting facets of Nazi ideology. In early August, Degrelle returned to Paris to meet on 10 or 11 August with Abetz, now the ambassador to France in Paris, and to attempt to convince him of the validity of his territorial designs with the aid of maps of the Duchy of Burgundy. Also at the meeting, however, was Henri de Man, president of the Belgian Labor Party and one of Leopold III&#x27;s advisors, as Abetz desired an alliance between Degrelle and de Man. They agreed to a pact and met again on 18 August in Brussels to sign an official agreement, sketching out the possible political future of Belgium as a state with no parties and an all-powerful royal government.

On his return to Brussels, Degrelle met with Belgian notables such as , Leopold III&#x27;s secretary, Albert Devèze, a former minister, and Maurice Lippens at his residence on the . He came to no agreement with any of these men, however, and thus could not form a government. This required the support of Leopold III, who disliked Degrelle, and of the Germans, who were unwilling to delegate any power to Rex, and had orders from Goebbels to ignore Degrelle. Leopold III refused to meet with Degrelle or consider him for the office of Prime Minister, and summons to meet with Nazi leadership promised by Abetz were not forthcoming. Degrelle also failed to gain support for a government under his leadership from the Belgian Catholic Church.

With his other ventures flagging, Degrelle returned to attempting to gain power through popular support. He relaunched &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot; on 25 August and attempted to transform Rex into a mass movement, beginning with a tour of the country in September and the appointment of Doring and newcomers Félix Francq, Rutger Simoens, and Fernand Rouleau to positions of leadership. The revitalized &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot; achieved some success over late 1940, dramatically expanding the Combat Formations, which began attacking Jewish-owned businesses and engaging in street violence to weaken local governments. Rex remained, however, a minor entity and the disturbances caused by its street violence further angered the German military government, who were collaborating with the Belgian establishment. The Germans ordered the Rexist violence to cease and Rexist leaders complied by the end of 1940.

===Rex&#x27;s embrace of collaborationism===
By 1941, Belgian leaders including Degrelle had realized that the war would be long and that while it was ongoing, the Germans would not delegate any power to the Belgians. Degrelle became increasingly and publicly pro-Nazi until, on 1 January 1941, in &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot;, and in a speech on 6 January, Degrelle declared his support for the German occupation of Belgium. This new orientation was unpopular within Rex, whose members came to be seen as traitors by most Belgians, and sparked another exodus of disillusioned members.

Following the January declaration, the German military administration of General Alexander von Falkenhausen remained unimpressed by Degrelle but began subsidizing Rex, appointed members to civil office, and allowed it to freely organize. In February, it also decided to seek Belgian enlistees in the National Socialist Motor Corps (&quot;Nationalsozialistisches Kraftfahrkorps&quot;, NSKK). Degrelle, who had petitioned the military administration for Rexist units in the German armed forces over late 1940, began to recruit Walloons for a Rexist brigade in the NSKK. He promised 1,000 drivers, but only recruited 300. At the same time, Degrelle began courting members of the working class and socialist leaders via &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot; to replenish Rex&#x27;s membership, but again achieved little.

By April, Rex was collapsing from a combination of resignations, defections, popular and sometimes violent hostility from other Belgians, and German indifference. When the military administration appointed new, collaborationist civil servants and officials on 1 April, no Rexists were appointed. In response, Degrelle attacked the military administration in &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot; and was subsequently chastised in person by Eggert Reeder, the head of civil affairs in the military administration. On 10 April, Degrelle wrote to Hitler to request, without success, permission to enlist in the German military. On 10 May, the VNV, who were favored by the military administration and by Nazi ideology, was ceded Rex&#x27;s Flemish branch in an agreement that also established Rex and the VNV as the only legitimate parties in German-occupied Belgium. No top-level Rexist leaders, however, were consulted—Rex&#x27;s Flanders branch had acted independently—and Rex was not given the option of refusing the merger. This opened a rift between Rex and more moderate francophone collaborators, who attacked Rex and Degrelle as being impotent and began forming rival parties. The Germans ignored those rivals, but Rex continued to stagnate over May.

===Barbarossa and the Walloon Legion===

On 22 June 1941, Germany launched an invasion of the Soviet Union. Degrelle joined other prominent Rexists in announcing his support of the invasion, which he hoped would stem Rex&#x27;s decline. He again went to meet with Abetz in Paris. In his absence, Rouleau unsuccessfully requested permission from the military administration to organize volunteer units for the Eastern Front. When Degrelle returned from France, he repeated the request. Likely because of instructions from Berlin, the military administration granted Rex permission to form a unit of francophone Belgian volunteers. As the Nazis considered Walloons an inferior people to the Flemish, Walloon and Flemish volunteers would be segregated into different units. Walloons would also only be able to enlist in the regular armed forces.

Degrelle announced the permission to organize a volunteer unit at a meeting of the Combat Formations on 6 July and exhorted Rexists to join. Claiming to have Leopold III&#x27;s support, Degrelle began energetically promoting and organizing his &quot;Walloon Legion&quot; but achieved little. To bolster this venture, Degrelle announced on 20 July that he would enlist as a foot soldier, and gave leadership of Rex to Matthys. As a result, the Walloon Legion ballooned to 850 or 860 volunteers, 730 of whom were Rexists. The force departed Belgium for basic training on 8 August, taking with it much of Rex&#x27;s provincial leadership. By this time, Degrelle had decided that the Legion was a better political vehicle than Rex, and strove to totally control it. In August, believing Rouleau to be plotting to wrest control of the Legion and then Rex from him, Degrelle ousted him from both.

Beginning in November 1941, the Legion was assigned to anti-partisan operations in occupied Soviet territory. In February 1942 it was attached to the 100th &quot;Jäger&quot; Division and moved to the frontline, where it engaged in combat with regular Soviet forces for the first time on 28 February. By the end of 1942, the Legion was reduced by attrition to 150 men and would have to rely on new recruitment drives to sustain itself. The Legion&#x27;s battlefield performance was of great value to Degrelle, who came to be appreciated by German officers. In May, he was made an officer and awarded the Iron Cross, First Class, for his conduct in battle.

===Overtures to the SS===
As early as September 1941, Degrelle had taken an interest in the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS), a paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party led by Heinrich Himmler, and came to see the SS as the most powerful force in Nazi-occupied Europe. In 1942, Degrelle began lobbying for the integration of Walloons into the SS, and in June made a brief visit to Berlin to meet with Nazi functionaries and Rex&#x27;s interim leaders. Degrelle did not meet any SS leaders during that trip, but after returning to the front from this meeting, the Walloon Legion was briefly assigned to the command of &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; general Felix Steiner. Degrelle met Gottlob Berger, head of the SS Main Office, on 19 December. Himmler also personally warmed to Degrelle, and by the end of the year he was persuaded to name the Walloons a Germanic people.

On 17 January 1943, Degrelle gave a speech at an assembly of Rexists in Brussels in which he declared that Walloons were a Germanic people forced to adopt the French language. He proclaimed a new, &quot;Burgundian&quot; nationalism within a pan-German state. Following the speech, Streel and much of Rex&#x27;s old guard left the party, Walloon competitors to Rex for German favor evaporated, and Degrelle definitively turned his attentions away from Rex and towards the SS. Over the rest of January and February 1943, Degrelle met with Nazi functionaries in Brussels, Berlin, and Paris to gain influence in the Nazi Party.

===Incorporation in the Waffen-SS===
On 23–24 May 1943, Degrelle met with Himmler near Rastenburg (Kętrzyn) to discuss the transfer of the Walloon Legion from the German Army to the Waffen-SS. On 1 June 1943, the Legion was integrated into the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; as the &quot;SS-Sturmbrigade Wallonien&quot;. Degrelle spent the rest of mid-1943 enriching himself and his family with assets seized by the Germans in Belgium and France, and recruiting for the Legion. He purchased a seized Jewish-owned perfume company, and on 29 July 1943 launched a newspaper named &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot; that, devoid of the sensational tone and polemics of &quot;Le Pays Réel&quot;, found immediate financial success. Also in July, Degrelle attended Mass in his hometown in SS uniform and was refused the sacraments per standing orders from the Belgian bishops. In response, Degrelle and his bodyguards apprehended the offending priest and imprisoned him in Degrelle&#x27;s home, provoking his excommunication by the Bishop of Namur on 19 August 1943. Degrelle successfully appealed to the Legion&#x27;s chaplain and the German military chaplain service to have his excommunication overturned.

In October and again in November, Degrelle met with Berger, and at his direction wrote to Hitler to denounce the military administration in Belgium and request an SS-run government, only a few days after sending a letter of praise to Reeder. Reeder was made aware of the letter to Hitler and wrote to German field marshal Wilhelm Keitel, then the commander of the regular German armed forces, to denounce Degrelle. Degrelle rejoined the Legion on 2 November, and nine days later arrived in Ukraine with the unit, now numbering about 2,000 men. On 28 January 1944, the Legion was trapped by the Red Army in the Cherkassy pocket. The Legion was savaged in the subsequent fighting, being reduced to 632 men by the time the encirclement was broken in mid-February. Among the casualties were the Legion&#x27;s commanding officer, Lucien Lippert, who was killed, and Degrelle himself, who had been injured. Degrelle was promoted to the rank of &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; (Major) to replace Lippert, but effective control of the Legion was given to another German SS officer.

Degrelle was flown to Berlin and became, according to historian Nico Wouters, &quot;the poster boy for all European collaborators.&quot; On 20 February, Degrelle was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross by Hitler. Two days later Degrelle was sent to Brussels to recuperate and was met there by Matthys and Richard Jungclaus, head of the SS in Belgium. Degrelle was received by collaborators in Brussels on 27 February and in Paris on 5 March, and on 2 April the surviving members of the Legion paraded through Charleroi. Degrelle, however, could not translate his military service into political aggrandizement, as the SS desired for him to remain an instrument of propaganda. While on leave, Degrelle tried to make connections with collaborators in Paris and Flanders without success. On 8 July, Degrelle&#x27;s brother Edouard, who had had no role in Rex but was sympathetic to the party and the German occupation, was shot and killed in his pharmacy in their hometown. In response, German authorities arrested 46 men and Rexist militants murdered another pharmacist. Returning from a speaking tour in Germany, Degrelle arrived in Bouillon on 10 July to demand reprisals. He wrote to Himmler to request the retaliatory killing of 100 Belgian civilians and was ignored, but on 21 July Rexists attached to the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; murdered three hostages near Bouillon.

On 22 or 23 July 1944, Degrelle returned to the Legion as it was engaged in the Battle of Narva in Estonia. The Legion was depleted by the fighting and after the battle returned to Germany, where Degrelle was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Oak Leaves on 25 August. On 18 September the Legion was expanded and renamed the 28th Waffen-SS Division and placed under Degrelle&#x27;s acting command. To staff the Division, Degrelle now made service in the Legion mandatory for all Rexists, many of whom were fleeing the then-ongoing liberation of Belgium, and recruited French collaborators who had fled to Sigmaringen and the Spanish volunteers of the defunct Blue Legion. In December, the Legion was assigned an armored unit was moved back to the front in January 1945. It was destroyed in battle by the Red Army at the Battle of the Oder–Neisse in April.

==Exile in Spain, 1945–1994==
In November 1944, Degrelle was given the title &quot;Popular Leader (&quot;Volksführer&quot;) of the Walloons&quot; by Hitler, and in December was promised control of any Belgian territory that the German armed forces retook in the upcoming Ardennes offensive. Degrelle arrived at the Western Front on 1 January 1945 with a staff of 55. The offensive was a failure, and Degrelle began to plan for an Allied victory. On 30 March, he met with Matthys and Louis Collard, another Rexist leader, and dissolved Rex. In late April, Degrelle abandoned the remains of the Legion near Berlin and headed north. On 2 May, he encountered Himmler near Lübeck and attempted to gain a guarantee of safety for his family from Himmler. He was instead promoted to &quot;Oberführer&quot;. Degrelle boarded a German naval vessel bound for occupied Norway where, on 7 May, the day of Norway&#x27;s liberation, Josef Terboven, former &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of Norway, put Degrelle and five other men on a Heinkel He 111 bound for Francoist Spain and then South America. The next day, the plane crashed on the Beach of La Concha, at San Sebastián, Spain. Degrelle, who had amongst other injuries sustained a broken leg, was hospitalized and detained.

On 15 May, the Spanish government contacted the British government about deporting Degrelle, but not back to Belgium. In response, Belgium, which made Degrelle&#x27;s repatriation and prosecution a top priority, asked for British and American support in talks with Spain. The United States and the U.K. were ambivalent about the matter as Degrelle had not been named a war criminal by the United Nations War Crimes Commission, but were moved into an active role in June by Belgian protests. The British and Americans decided that, since Degrelle had entered Spain as a member of the German armed forces, he should be taken into Allied custody with 30 other German exiles via an American ship, and communicated this desire to Spain. The Spanish government decided it could not extract diplomatic recognition from Belgium in exchange for Degrelle, and instead justified its reluctance to repatriate Degrelle on human rights grounds. On the night of 21–22 August 1946, Degrelle disappeared from the hospital in which he was recuperating. The Spanish government announced that he had left the country and that his location was unknown, and promised to repatriate Degrelle to Belgium if he returned.

The Belgian government had sentenced Degrelle to death &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1944 and revoked his citizenship on 29 December 1945. With the assistance of the Spanish government, Degrelle went into hiding in the southern Spanish Province of Málaga and was kept informed about Belgian agents posing as tourists visiting the region to locate him. In 1954, Degrelle was adopted by a local woman he had befriended, Matilde Ramírez Reina, and thereby gained Spanish citizenship under the name José León Ramírez Reina. Degrelle made his first public appearance since the war on 15 December 1954 at a ceremony held to honor Spanish volunteers in the German military. This, and a letter Degrelle wrote to the Belgian newspaper &quot;La Libre Belgique&quot; offering to stand trial in Belgium if the trial was publicized, provoked a diplomatic breach between Spain and Belgium.

By the 1960s, the Belgian government was content with Degrelle remaining in exile in Spain as long as he remained unprovocative. Degrelle became an increasingly public figure in the 1960s and was frequently discussed by French and Belgian media. He openly associated with other Nazi exiles such as Otto Skorzeny, and wore his SS uniform to his daughter&#x27;s wedding in 1969, an event reported widely in the Spanish press. On 3 December 1964, Belgium passed a law, named the &quot;Lex Degrelliana&quot;, that extended the statute of limitations for death sentences issued for offenses against the Belgian state committed between 1940 and 1945 from 20 years to 30. In 1969, Degrelle began a media campaign to be allowed to return to Belgium. At Belgium&#x27;s request, an arrest warrant for Degrelle was filed the next year by Spanish police but not served, putting an end to the campaign. By the 1980s, Degrelle was living comfortably, having profited from running a construction company that helped build American airbases in Spain, and under his original name. On 31 March 1994, Degrelle died of cardiac arrest in a hospital in Málaga. Belgium definitively blocked Degrelle&#x27;s return in 1983 and subsequently forbade the repatriation of his remains.

===Holocaust denial and lawsuit===
After World War II, Degrelle joined other Nazi exiles in denying the Holocaust. In 1979, ahead of Pope John Paul II&#x27;s visit to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Degrelle wrote an open letter to the Pope. In the letter, Degrelle denied that any systematic killing had taken place at Auschwitz and that the &quot;real genocide&quot; was the American bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the bombings of Hamburg and Dresden.

In its July–August 1985 issue, the Spanish magazine &quot;Tiempo&quot; published an interview with Degrelle in which he repeated his skepticism about the Holocaust, and claimed that Josef Mengele, an SS officer stationed at Auschwitz, was an ordinary doctor and that no gas chambers existed at Auschwitz. Violeta Friedman, a survivor of Auschwitz whose family had been gassed on Mengele&#x27;s orders, decided to sue Degrelle and &quot;Tiempo&quot;. In August, Friedman was introduced by Jewish community leaders Max Mazín and Alberto Benasuly to Catalan lawyer Jorge Trías for legal counsel and was assured of the support of Israel&#x27;s then-ambassador to Spain, Shlomo Ben Ami.

The lawsuit went to court in Madrid on 7 November 1985 and was based on the Ley Orgánica 1/82 of 5 May 1982 and the Ley 62/78 of 26 December 1978, protecting the same rights, as Trías realized that it was not possible to sue Degrelle for making his statements under any of the articles of the Spanish Criminal Code which were in force at the time. Friedman and her lawyer thus alleged that Degrelle&#x27;s statements had sullied the honor of her family as victims of the Holocaust, which Degrelle&#x27;s lawyer dismissed by stating that Friedman lacked standing as Degrelle had not mentioned her or her family, and motioned for the case to be dismissed. The lower courts were initially favorable to Degrelle, but in 1991 the Supreme Court of Spain ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court determined that Friedman had standing to sue Degrelle because his statements were not protected by the freedom of expression guaranteed by the Constitution of Spain. According to Trías, the case influenced Spanish law about genocide denial, racism, and xenophobia.

==Personal life==
Degrelle married Marie Lemay, the daughter of a French industrialist, on 27 March 1932. The couple had five children. Their marriage became strained during the war as Degrelle kept mistresses in Brussels and Paris, and Lemay had an open affair with an officer of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; until she ended the affair in March 1943 and informed Degrelle of it. The officer, unwilling to end the affair, was found shot in the head and heart near the Degrelle residence on 12 April 1943. Degrelle was cleared of any wrongdoing by Nazi authorities and news of the officer&#x27;s death was suppressed. Lemay was imprisoned by Belgian authorities and chose not to join Degrelle in Spain. She died in Nice on 29 January 1984. On 15 June 1984, Degrelle married Jeanne Brevet Charbonneau, niece of Joseph Darnand, former commander of the Vichy French paramilitary &quot;Milice&quot;.

==Legacy==
Degrelle had a great influence in the post-war resurgence of fascism. Beginning in 1949, Degrelle began to publish books and give interviews in which he praised the Nazis, denied the Holocaust, attempted to distort the historical record, and aggrandize himself. Degrelle&#x27;s work formed a large amount of the 20th century, French-language historiography of Belgium during the war until it was refuted by Belgian historian in the 1970s. Degrelle was also influential among post-war far-right groups in Belgium and West Germany, especially in the 1980s and 1990s. In the 2010s, Italian journalist Alessandro Orsini embedded himself with neo-fascist militias in Italy and reported that Degrelle&#x27;s writings were required reading among them.

Degrelle&#x27;s estate in Málaga became a port of call for neo-Nazis. He established connections with neo-Nazis such as the Spanish Circle of Friends of Europe (&quot;Círculo Español de Amigos de Europa&quot;, CEDADE), which networked with neo-Nazi groups throughout Europe through Degrelle and Skorzeny. In the 1960s, a portrait of Degrelle appeared in a work by for the HIAG, a &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; veterans&#x27; lobbyist group. He continued to make appearances in German-language, neo-Nazi publications into the 1990s. Degrelle also found friends in the post-Francoist People&#x27;s Alliance (&quot;Alianza Popular&quot;, AP), and in Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of the far-right National Front party in France, and Michael Kühnen, a leader of the German neo-Nazi movement of the later 20th century.

<text>Komárom county (in Latin: &quot;comitatus Comaromiensis&quot;, in Hungarian: &quot;Komárom (vár)megye&quot;, in Slovak: &quot;Komárňanský komitát / Komárňanská stolica / Komárňanská župa&quot;, in German: &quot;Komorner Gespanschaft / Komitat Komorn&quot;) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary, situated on both sides of the Danube river. Today, the territory to the north of the Danube is part of Slovakia, while the territory to the south of the Danube is part of Hungary.

==Geography==

Komárom County shared borders with the counties of , , , , , , Fejér and Veszprém. The rivers Danube Vág and Nyitra ran through the county. It also covered the eastern part of the island between the Danube and the Little Danube (Slovak translates as English: &quot;Rye Island&quot;, Hungarian: ). Around 1910 its area was .

==Capitals==
The capital of the county was the Komárom Castle and later the town of Komárom (the town was divided into Komárom-Komárno).

==History==
The Komárom comitatus arose in the 11th century as one of the first comitatuses of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was situated within a radius of about 20 km around Komárom.

In the aftermath of the revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire Hungary came under military administration and was divided into five military districts. In 1850 Komárom and Esztergom counties were divided along the Danube: the areas north of the river – Komárom&#x27;s Comorn (Komárom) and (land- and city-districts, including the Szőny suburb of Komárom on the southern bank) and Perbete (&#x27;seat-district&#x27;); Esztergom&#x27;s Muzsla and a small part of Győr County on the north bank – were combined into a new Komárom county (under the German name ) administered by the Military District of Preßburg; the southern parts of the traditional Komárom and Esztergom counties, including Komárom&#x27;s Kócs and Dotis , were merged to form a new (Esztergom) county administered by the Military District of Pest-Ofen. The districts were dissolved and traditional counties restored in 1860.

Until the later 19th century the area of Lábatlan and Piszke (now merged with Lábatlan) was an exclave of Komárom county within Esztergom county.

In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon assigned the part of Komárom county north of the Danube to Czechoslovakia (Komárno region). The southern part stayed in Hungary and merged with the southern part of Esztergom county to form Komárom-Esztergom County in 1923. The forming of Czechoslovakia, whose border in the south became the Danube River, separated the seat of the county, Komárom, from its southern half. 

In 1938, the Czechoslovak part became part of Hungary by the First Vienna Award. Komárom county was recreated, which included, besides the territory of pre-1920 Komárom County, most of the Rye Island. After World War II, the pre-war situation was reestablished, but in 1950, the county was renamed to Komárom as the county was rearranged and received some extra territories. This county was renamed to Komárom-Esztergom County in 1990. The part of the former county north of the river Danube is now in Slovakia, is part of the Nitra region and is largely identical with the Komárno district.

The territory to the north of the Danube is part of Slovakia (Nitra region) and is largely identical with the Komárno district. The territory to the south of the Danube is part of Hungary. The town on the northern shore was renamed to Komárno. Komárno and Komárom are today connected by the Elisabeth Bridge.
==Demographics==

<text>White-Jacket; or, The World in a Man-of-War is the fifth book by American writer Herman Melville, first published in London in 1850. The book is based on the author&#x27;s fourteen months&#x27; service in the United States Navy, aboard the frigate USS &quot;Neversink&quot; (actually ).

Although early biographers of Melville assumed the account was reliably autobiographical, scholars have shown that much in the book was taken and transformed from popular sea books.

==Overview==
Based on Melville&#x27;s experiences as a common seaman aboard the frigate from 1843 to 1844, stories that other sailors told him, and earlier sea books, the novel is severely critical of virtually every aspect of American naval life and thus qualifies as Melville&#x27;s most politically strident work. At the time, though, the one thing that journalists and politicians focused on in the novel was its graphic descriptions of flogging and the horrors caused by its arbitrary use; in fact, because Harper &amp; Bros. made sure the book got into the hands of every member of Congress, &quot;White-Jacket&quot; was instrumental in abolishing flogging in the U.S. Navy forever. Melville scholars also acknowledge the huge number of parallels between &quot;White-Jacket&quot; and &quot;Billy Budd&quot; and view the former as &quot;a major source for naval matters&quot; in the latter.

The novel takes its title from the outer garment that the eponymous main character fashions for himself on board ship, with materials at hand, being in need of a coat sufficient for the rounding of Cape Horn. Due to a ship-wide rationing of tar, however, White-Jacket is forever denied his wish to tar the exterior of his coat and thus waterproof it. This causes him to have two near-death experiences, once when he is reclining among the canvases in the main-top and, his jacket blending in with the surrounding material, he is nearly unfurled along with the main sail; and once when, having been pitched overboard while reeving the halyards, he has to cut himself free from the coat in order not to drown. He having done so, his shipmates mistake the discarded jacket for a great white shark and harpoon it, sending it to a watery grave.

The symbolism of the color white, introduced in this novel in the form of the narrator&#x27;s jacket, is more fully expanded upon in &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, where it becomes an all-encompassing &quot;blankness&quot;. The mixture of journalism, history, and fiction; the presentation of a sequence of striking characters; the metaphor of a sailing ship as the world in miniature, all prefigure &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, his next novel.

==&quot;White-Jacket&quot; and the log of the USS &quot;United States&quot;==
Many of the actual crew and the incidents of the voyage recorded in the ship log are transformed and figure prominently in &quot;White-Jacket&quot;. As one Melville scholar has stressed, &quot;Melville rarely invents...&quot; and &quot;the ship&#x27;s records bear him out.&quot; Foremost among them is Melville&#x27;s hero Jack Chase, captain of the maintop, in reality Englishman John J. Chase, age 53, whom Melville introduces in &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, Chapter 4, Jack Chase, thus, &quot;First and foremost was Jack Chase, our noble First Captain of the Top.&quot; Melville described Chase, as having fought at the Battle of Navarino and deserted to fight for Peruvian independence. The ship log confirms Melville&#x27;s narrative, Chase returned to the frigate on 29 May 1842 and was pardoned, at the request of the Peruvian ambassador for his services to the government of Peru. 

Similarly among the officers, Melville&#x27;s paragon is a lieutenant he calls, &quot;Mad Jack&quot;. Melville describes Mad Jack as a model of excellence in chapter 8, in contrast to an ineffectual lieutenant whom Melville refers to as &quot;Selvagee.&quot; &quot;Mad Jack is in his saddle on the sea. That is his home ... Mad Jack was a bit of tyrant — they &quot;say&quot; all good officers are — but the sailors loved him all round; and would much rather stand fifty watches with him, than one with a rose-water sailor.&quot; Mad Jack&#x27;s original was Lt. Latham B. Avery, who two of Melville&#x27;s shipmates identified as Mad Jack. Melville writes (chapter 27), &quot;In time of peril, like the needle to the loadstone, obedience, irrespective of rank, generally flies to him who is best fitted to command.&quot; Melville recorded one other telling detail about his hero: &quot;But Mad Jack, alas! has one fearful. He drinks.&quot; Melville adds, &quot;in very fine weather he was sometimes betrayed into a glass too many. But with Cape Horn before him, he took the Temperance Pledge outright, till that perilous promontory should be far astern.&quot; The log for 15 August and 6 September 1842 confirms that Lt. Lantham B. Avery was court-martialed and reprimanded for leaving the deck while he was drunk.

Another actual crew member is &quot;the Purser, who was a southern gentleman...&quot; The purser was Edward Fitzgerald, who like many naval officers of the era was a slaveholder. On 18 October 1841 Fitzgerald, requested the consent of the Secretary of the Navy, Abel P. Upshur, to entered his &quot;servant&quot; (slave), Robert Lucas, as a landsman (in reality his personal steward) as a crew member and whose nine dollar per month wages Fitzgerald collected. In reply, Secretary Upshur, on 26 October 1841, wrote, &quot;the department grants your request to take your own servant aboard the frigate United States.&quot; In &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, Lucas becomes &quot;Guinea&quot; the purser&#x27;s body servant, the only person aboard except the hospital steward and the invalids who is exempt from being present at muster for punishment. Once in Boston, Robert Lucas was able with the help of sympathetic shipmates to flee the vessel and successfully petition Lemuel Shaw, Chief Justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court, Melville&#x27;s family friend and future father-in-law, for freedom. This important case &quot;Commonwealth vs. Edward Fitzgerald re Robert Lucas,&quot; became a precedent in the naval service, effectively barring enslaved individuals as seamen. 

&quot;In both the ship log and &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, mortality is prominent; with Melville relating and the log confirming the various modes of death.&quot; For sailors death and burial at sea or on a foreign shore was a commonplace.&quot; During the long voyage, six crew members died, including David Black, the ship&#x27;s cooper, &quot;Bungs&quot;, who fell overboard and perished on 4 October 1843. The actual log entry for 4 October 1843, is terse: &quot;From 4 to 8 moderate breezes and clear weather at 5.22 David Black (Cooper) fell overboard, hove to with maintop sail to the mast and sent the Barge &amp; 2nd Cutter in search of him … at 10.15 wore to the N hove to and hoisted up the 2nd Cutter, all search proving ineffectual.&quot; In &quot;White-Jacket&quot;, chapter 17, headed, &quot;Away! Second, Third, and Fourth Cutters, Away!&quot; Melville, transforms this brief passage into art,

&quot;Do you see him?&quot; shouted the officer of the watch through his trumpet, hailing the mainmast-head. &quot;Man or &quot;buoy&quot;, do you see either?&quot; &quot;See nothing, sir,&quot; was the reply. &quot;Clear away the cutters!&quot; was the next order. &quot;Bugler! call away the second, third, and fourth cutters&#x27; crews. Hands by the tackles!&quot; In less than three minutes the three boats were down. More hands were wanted in one of them, and, among others, I jumped in to make up the deficiency... For a time, in perfect silence, we slid up and down the great seething swells of the sea, but saw nothing. &quot;There, it&#x27;s no use,&quot; cried the officer; &quot;he&#x27;s gone, whoever he is. Pull away, men — pull away! they&#x27;ll be recalling us soon.&quot; &quot;Let him drown!&quot; cried the strokesman; &quot;he&#x27;s spoiled my watch below for me.&quot; &quot;Who the devil is he?&quot; cried another. &quot;He&#x27;s one who&#x27;ll never have a coffin!&quot; replied a third. &quot;No, no! they&#x27;ll never sing out, &quot;&#x27;All hands bury the dead!&#x27; &quot; for him, my hearties!&quot; cried a fourth.

The same incident is described by the anonymous author of &quot;Journal of A Cruise to the Pacific Ocean, 1842-1844, in the Frigate United States&quot;, who recounts a similar set of facts and circumstances.

==Characters==

&quot;This list is not exhaustive.&quot;

* White-Jacket, the main character and narrator, so nicknamed because his coat is the only white one on board; a novice sailor (at least on a naval ship), his jacket often gets him into trouble, mostly because of its whiteness
*Jack Chase, a sailor of British origin who is universally regarded by his fellow seamen and even by the officers as the epitome of a true and good sailor; he shows contempt for any man who has shipped out on a whaler
* Captain Claret, a captain of usually severe tendencies, his name reflects the fact that he is also an alcoholic
* Commodore
* Selvagee, a foppish lieutenant whose leadership style is tyrannical
* Mad Jack, a lieutenant whose leadership style is collegial
* Old Coffee, the ship&#x27;s cook
* Mayday, a ship&#x27;s cook deputy 
* Rosewater, a ship&#x27;s cook deputy
* Lemsford, a sailor who aspires to be a poet
* Quoin, a sailor &quot;indefatigable in attending to his duties, which consisted in taking care of one division of the guns&quot;
* Nord, a sailor of surly look and melancholy disposition; when White-Jacket first encounters him, the only friend Nord has on board is Lemsford
*Williams
* Wooloo, the commodore&#x27;s Polynesian servant
* Old Revolver
* Old Combustibles
* Chaplain
* Cuticle, the ship&#x27;s Surgeon
* Shakings
* Bland, the ship&#x27;s master-at-arms
* Tawney, a sheet-anchor man, a &quot;staid and sober seamen, very intelligent,&quot; whom White-Jacket sometimes invites to join the crew in the main top and tell stories. Tawney is the only black character in the novel to be treated equitably in relation to the other characters.
* Guinea, a slave owned by the ship&#x27;s purser
* Ushant, a much admired sexagenarian and crew member of the fore top who, along with many other sailors, cultivates a long flowing beard or &quot;homebounder.&quot; When Captain Claret commands all facial hair be shorn to meet Navy regulations, a small rebellion ensues but ultimately Ushant is the sole remaining dissenter. He is flogged, put in chains, and held in the brig for weeks, but arrives in Norfolk harbor with his beard intact and a hero among his peers. White-Jacket takes a hair from Ushant&#x27;s beard as a memento.
* Don Pedro II, Emperor of Brazil

==Publication history==
&quot;White-Jacket&quot; was published in London by Richard Bentley on February 1, 1850, and in New York by Harper &amp; Brothers on March 21, 1850. Melville referred to it and his previous book &quot;Redburn&quot; as &quot;two &quot;jobs&quot; which I have done for money—being forced to it as other men are to sawing wood.&quot;

==Legal impact==
At the urging of New Hampshire Senator John P. Hale (whose daughter, Lucy, would later become the fiancée of John Wilkes Booth, the murderer of President Abraham Lincoln) the United States Congress banned flogging on all U.S. ships in September 1850. He was inspired by Melville&#x27;s &quot;vivid description of flogging, a brutal staple of 19th century naval discipline&quot; in his &quot;novelized memoir&quot; &quot;White-Jacket&quot;.

The officer whom Melville based his fictional commodore on, Thomas ap Catesby Jones, a former commander of , was later brought up on a court-martial in 1850 and found guilty on three counts mostly related to &quot;oppression&quot; of junior officers. Jones was relieved of command for two and a half years. In 1853, President Millard Fillmore reinstated him, and in 1858 the United States Congress restored his pay.

During Melville&#x27;s time on the USS &quot;United States&quot; from 1843–1844, the ship log records 163 floggings, including some on his first and second days (18 and 19 August 1843) aboard the frigate at Honolulu, Oahu. The official log entry for 18 August 1843 simply states:Commenced with moderate breezes from the Nd &amp; Ed. and clear. Shipped Herman Melville. &quot;O.S.&quot; and Griffith Williams &quot;O.S.&quot; ... at 9 a m . mustered the crew at Quarters, Punished Jno Hall, &quot;O.S&quot; with 12 lashes with cats for striking sentry on Post. Geo Clark &quot;OS&quot; with 12 of cats for smuggling liquor, Bos. C. B. Stanly &quot;App&quot; with 12 lashes with Kittens for fighting and Wm B Ewing &quot;App&quot; with 6. for using provoking language. Suspended the Boatswain from duty for disrespectful - conduct to the Officer of the Deck,- by replying when ordered by same through – Midn [Midshipman] Key, to call all hands stand by their washed clothes &quot;that he would &#x27;receive no more orders in this Ship&quot;, or words to that effect.

The following day, 19 August 1843, the log records yet another muster for punishment. &quot;From 8 to meridian, moderate breezes from the Nd &amp; Ed and clear, at 9. hoisted in the &quot;3&quot;d Cutter, and got the lower booms alongside. Punished Geo Davis, Wm Stewart and Antonio Guavella &quot;Bandsmen&quot; with 12 lashes each for drunkenness.&quot; In &quot;A Flogging&quot; (chapter 33), Melville changed this brutal scene from 19 August 1843 in Honolulu Oahu to sometime later when the frigate was at sea. He also changed the names of the crewmen punished to John, Peter, Mark, and Antone and the charge from drunkenness to fighting. &quot;Antone, the Portuguese&quot; is clearly based on his recollection of Antonio Guavella.&quot;

<text>Pan Am Flight 759 was a regularly scheduled domestic passenger flight from Miami to San Diego, with en route stops in New Orleans and Las Vegas. On July 9, 1982, the Boeing 727 flying this route crashed in the New Orleans suburb of Kenner after being forced down by a microburst shortly after takeoff. All 145 on board, as well as eight people on the ground, were killed.

==Aircraft and crew==
The aircraft involved, a 14-year-old Boeing 727-235, registration N4737, construction number 19457/518, was delivered to National Airlines on January 31, 1968. The aircraft was powered by three Pratt &amp; Whitney JT8D-7B turbofan engines, and was renamed from &quot;37 Susan/Erica&quot; to &quot;Clipper Defiance&quot; after National was merged with Pan Am.

At the time of accident, the aircraft was carrying 137 passengers and one non-revenue passenger in the cockpit jumpseat, along with a crew of seven. The captain was 45-year-old Kenneth L. McCullers, who had 11,727 flying hours, including 10,595 hours on the Boeing 727. McCullers was described by others as an &quot;above average&quot; pilot, who was &quot;comfortable&quot; to fly with because of his excellent judgement and ability to exercise command. The First Officer was 32-year-old Donald G. Pierce, who had 6,127 flying hours, including 3,914 hours on the Boeing 727. Pierce was described by other captains as a conscientious pilot with excellent knowledge of aircraft systems and company flight procedures and techniques. The flight engineer was 60-year-old Leo B. Noone, who had 19,904 flying hours, including 10,508 hours on the Boeing 727. All three flight crew, including the captain, the first officer and the second officer, were reported having no sleep or health problems, and had passed all proficiency checks without issues.

== Accident ==
The weather forecast issued at 07:40 on July 9 by the New Orleans National Meteorological Center contained thunderstorms, possible severe turbulence, icing, and wind shear. The weather chart at 18:00 local time identified a high pressure system located off the Louisiana coast. No fronts or low pressure areas were within of the airport. The forecast between 1200 and 2200 indicated &quot;scattered clouds, variable to broken clouds at , thunderstorms, and moderate rain showers.&quot; According to the NWS (National Weather Service), there were no severe weather warnings for the time and area of the accident.

Flight 759 began its takeoff from Runway 10 at the New Orleans International Airport (now Louis Armstrong New Orleans International), in Kenner, Louisiana at 16:07:57 central daylight time, bound for Las Vegas, Nevada. At the time of Flight 759&#x27;s takeoff, there were thunderstorms over the east of the airport and east-northeast of the departure end of runway 10. The winds were reported to be &quot;gusty and swirling.&quot; First Officer Pierce was the pilot flying and Captain McCullers was the pilot monitoring, as recorded on the aircraft&#x27;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR):

Flight 759 lifted off the runway, climbed to an altitude of between , and then began to descend. About from the end of runway, the aircraft struck a line of trees at an altitude of about . The aircraft continued descending for another , hitting trees and houses. At 16:09:01, the aircraft crashed into the residential area of Kenner, about from the end of the runway. Flight 759 initially struck a house at 1624 Fairway Street, destroying it. The plane broke apart as it went across two and a half blocks, tearing diagonally across Hudson Street, 17th Street, and Taylor Street.

The aircraft was destroyed by the impact, explosion, and subsequent ground fire. A total of 153 people were killed (all 145 passengers and crew on board and 8 on the ground). Another four people on the ground sustained injuries. In one of the destroyed houses, a 16-month-old baby girl was discovered in a crib covered with debris that protected her from the flames, sustaining only minor burns. The child&#x27;s mother and 4-year-old sister were killed; the father was at work when the accident occurred. In all, six houses were demolished, while five houses sustained significant damage. Most of the homes have since been rebuilt.

==Investigation==
The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the probable cause of the accident was the aircraft&#x27;s encounter with microburst-induced wind shear during the liftoff, which imposed a downdraft and a decreasing headwind, the effects of which the pilot would have had difficulty recognizing and reacting to in time for the aircraft&#x27;s descent to be stopped before its impact with trees. Contributing to the accident was the limited capability of then current wind shear detection technology. The investigation noted the failure of the US Government to &quot;put out proper weather information that day and to maintain wind shear detection devices at the airport.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that:

According to witnesses, a wind shear alert was mentioned on New Orleans Airport radio frequencies on July 9, before Flight 759 took off. But the flight crew had been briefed with a recorded weather advisory that was two hours old, though airport routine is for hourly recordings of weather information. There were no procedures at the airport for advising flight crews that updated weather announcements were available.

As a result, millions of dollars were paid out as compensation to various families affected by the crash. Flight 759, along with Delta Air Lines Flight 191 which crashed due to similar circumstances three years later, led to the development of the Airborne wind shear detection and alert system and the Federal Aviation Administration mandate to install windshear detection systems at airports and on board aircraft in the U.S. by 1993.

==Victims==
===Nationalities of passenger, crew and ground fatalities===
A memorial to the accident is located at Our Lady of Perpetual Help Church in Kenner, Louisiana.

==Media==
Royd Anderson wrote and produced a documentary on the crash in 2012. 

Australian radio presenter Peter Goers, whose parents died in the crash, wrote a book about the aftermath in 2023.

<doc id="924093" wikidata="Q931687" url="?curid=924093" title="Elections in South Africa">
<text>Elections in South Africa include elections for the National Assembly (the lower house of parliament), the provincial legislatures, and municipal councils. Elections are held on a five-year cycle and are conducted by the Electoral Commission (IEC), which is an independent body established by the constitution. The most recent elections for the National Assembly and provincial legislatures were held in 2024, while the most recent elections for municipal councils were held in 2021.

In elections for the National Assembly every South African citizen who is 18 or older is eligible to vote, including (since the 2014 election) those resident outside South Africa. Voters must be registered with the Electoral Commission and have a identity card or book. In elections for a provincial legislature or municipal council, only those resident within the province or municipality may vote.

The electoral system for the National Assembly and the provincial legislatures is based on party-list proportional representation, which means that parties are represented in proportion to their electoral support. Since 2024 independent candidates have also been able to stand for election. For municipal councils there is a mixed-member system in which wards elect individual councillors alongside those named from party lists.

== History ==
===Before the Union===
When the British took over the Cape, first in 1795 and then more permanently in 1806, they inherited a large, thinly populated pastoral society that depended on the labour of slaves and a rural workforce of indigenous Khoekhoe whose condition was akin to serfdom. In 1806 the entire population of the colony consisted of fewer than 80,000 people: 26,768 whites, 1,200 free blacks (manumitted slaves), 29,861 slaves and 20,426 Khoekhoe. In 1807, the British government ended the slave trade and, finally, in 1833 outlawed the practice of slavery throughout the Empire. 

Under pressure from the humanitarian lobby in the UK, acting in concert with a local missionary campaign, the government abolished the Khoekhoe&#x27;s serf-like status by the declaration of Ordinance 50 of 1828. According to the government&#x27;s instructions, &#x27;all Hottentots and other free persons of colour, lawfully residing within the said Colony, are and shall be, in the most full and ample manner, entitled to all and every the rights, privileges and benefits of the law, to which any other His Majesty&#x27;s subjects, lawfully residing within the said Colony, are or can be entitled.&#x27; This became known as the &quot;Hottentots&#x27; Magna Carta&quot;. The equality of all people appeared to be assured. As a result, municipal boards set up in the colony&#x27;s towns and villages from 1836 allowed any male resident who lived in a property with a yearly rent £10 or more to vote for his town board. From the very beginning, therefore, persons of color were able to participate in local elections.

This principle of a non-racial franchise was to be entrenched when the Cape was granted representative government in 1853. Part of the reason may have been give propertied Khoekhoe a greater stake in the political system. In 1850 the Khoekhoe of the Kat River Settlement had risen in rebellion. Although the uprising was defeated, it did influence the minds of colonial officials and politicians who were responsible for drawing up the 1853 constitution. The Cape&#x27;s Attorney General, William Porter said: &#x27;I would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings voting for his representative than meet the Hottentot in the wilds with a gun on his shoulder.&#x27; In terms of the constitution of 1853, any man who owned property worth at least £25 was entitled to vote for or stand in the Cape&#x27;s Parliament. By 1886 Africans made up 43 per cent of the vote in six constituencies of the Eastern Cape, and were a real political force. It was not long before white politicians began challenging the rights of Coloureds and Africans to vote. The passage of the Franchise and Ballot Act, which raised the property qualification from £25 to £75 in 1892, met with an angry response from African and Coloured voters.

These developments were not without criticism or opposition. The abolition of slavery, the declaration of Ordinance 50, and the accompanying extension of rights to the black population, were deeply resented by the white Dutch farmers of the Cape as undermining their way of life. Starting in 1834, thousands of these Boers set out on the Great Trek in the hope of leaving British control behind them. In the interior of southern Africa they would establish independent states, the South African Republic (also called the Transvaal Republic) and the Orange Free State, whose constitutions enshrined the principle of inequality between white and black in church and state.

After the Second Anglo-Boer War, the white peoples made peace and came together at the National Convention in October 1909. It brought together politicians from the Cape, Transvaal, Natal and the Orange River Colony, as well as Rhodesia. They aimed to draw up a constitution for the Union of South Africa, uniting the British possessions. The result was the South Africa Act.

Only white men were present at the National Convention; women and all other racial groups were excluded. This was in some ways unusual. Black men had enjoyed the vote in the Cape since the 1850s and – as long as they had sufficient property, income and education – continued to do so. By 1909 there were 14,388 Coloured and 6,633 African voters in the Cape. Between them they made up 14.8% of the electorate. In Natal African men also had the right to vote, but it was so constrained that it was almost theoretical. They had to prove they had property and that they were &#x27;civilised&#x27; and had been so for seven years. The Governor might then grant them the vote. Indians also had to overcome obstacles designed to prevent them from being enfranchised. In the Transvaal and Orange Free State, only white men could vote.

The Cape argued that their non-racial franchise should be extended across the proposed Union. This was rejected by the Transvaal and Orange Free State. Finally, a compromise was arrived at, maintaining the Cape&#x27;s existing voting system without extending it to the rest of the country, but insisting that this compromise was entrenched in the constitution. Africans and Coloured people would retain most of their voting rights in the Cape, but would not receive them in any other part of the Union.

African and Coloured politicians came together to resist these plans, and called on a former Cape Prime Minister, William Philip Schreiner, to lead a delegation to the UK to call for the Cape franchise to be implemented in the whole of South Africa. The delegation was unsuccessful in its appeal, despite receiving considerable support from the infant Labour Party and other liberal British organisations.

===At the Union===
The Union of South Africa was created on 31 May 1910 by the South Africa Act 1909, an act of the British Parliament. The House of Assembly (the lower house of the newly created Parliament of South Africa) and the provincial councils were elected by first-past-the-post voting in single-member electoral divisions. The franchise in these elections was initially the same as the franchise for the lower houses in the four colonies that had formed the Union, so there were different qualifications in different provinces.

In the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, the vote was limited by law to white men aged 21 or over. In Natal the vote was limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications; in theory, this could include non-white men but in practice only very small numbers managed to qualify: in 1910 over 99% of the electorate was white. In the Cape Province the franchise was also limited to men over 21 who met property and literacy qualifications, and non-white men did qualify in significant numbers, making up approximately 15% of the electorate in 1910. The qualifications in the Cape and Natal also excluded a substantial number of poorer white men. Only white men could stand for election to the House of Assembly, even from the Cape constituencies. The franchise rights of non-white voters in the Cape (but not in Natal) were entrenched in the South Africa Act by a provision that they could only be reduced by an act of Parliament passed by a two-thirds majority of both houses of Parliament sitting in a joint session.

===Enfranchisement of white women and poor whites===
In 1930 the National Party government of J. B. M. Hertzog passed the Women&#x27;s Enfranchisement Act, which extended the right to vote and the right to stand for election to all white women over the age of 21. In the following year the Franchise Laws Amendment Act lifted the property and literacy requirements for white male voters in the Cape and Natal, with the result that all white citizens over 21 were enfranchised. As the exclusion of women and the literacy and property qualifications continued to apply to non-white voters, these acts had the effect of diluting their electoral power by more than doubling the size of the white electorate.

At the next following general election in 1933, Leila Reitz was elected as the first female MP, representing Parktown for the South African Party.

===Segregation of black voters===
In 1936 the Hertzog government enacted the Representation of Natives Act, which removed black voters from the common voters&#x27; rolls and placed them on separate &quot;native voters&#x27; rolls&quot;. The act was passed by the required two-thirds majority in a joint session. Black voters could no longer vote in ordinary elections for the House of Assembly or the Cape Provincial Council; instead they would separately elect three members of the assembly and two members of the council. Four senators would also be indirectly elected by chiefs, tribal councils and local councils for &quot;native areas&quot;. The Representation of Natives Act was repealed in 1959 and consequently the seats of the &quot;native representative members&quot; were abolished in 1960. From this point, the only political representation of black South Africans was in the Bantustan legislatures.

=== Segregation of coloured voters ===

After coming to power in 1948 the National Party engaged in a policy of removing coloured voters similarly to black voters. In 1951 Parliament passed the Separate Representation of Voters Act, which removed coloured voters from the common voters roll and instead allowed them to separately elect four MPs. The act was challenged on the basis that it had not been passed with a two-thirds majority in a joint sitting, as required by the South Africa Act, and in 1952 the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court declared it to be invalid.

A subsequent attempt by the government to circumvent the Supreme Court by creating a High Court of Parliament failed. In the election of 1953, coloured voters in the Cape cast their ballots in the same constituencies as white voters. In 1955, the government introduced a new act which reconstituted the Senate, providing the two-thirds majority necessary to validate the Separate Representation of Voters Act.

This separate representation of coloured voters in the House of Assembly was ended in 1970. Instead, all coloured adults were given the right to vote for the Coloured Persons&#x27; Representative Council, which had limited legislative powers and was permanently dissolved in 1980.

=== Republic referendum ===
In 1960 a whites-only referendum was held to decide whether South Africa should become a republic. No changes were made to the franchise with the Republic&#x27;s emergence in 1961. However, with the policy of establishing Bantustans, the remaining black representation in the Senate was completely removed.

=== Tricameral Parliament ===
In 1983 a referendum on constitutional reform was held, as a result of which the Tricameral Parliament was formed, consisting of three separate houses to represent white, coloured and Indian South Africans. The existing House of Assembly was retained with its white electorate, while two new houses were created: the House of Representatives elected by coloured voters, and the House of Delegates elected by Indian voters. Many Indians and Coloureds rejected this powerless government as it was a strategy by the government to divide and rule over the nonwhite vote. Elections to these houses were conducted on the basis of first-past-the-post voting in single-member electoral divisions.

=== End of Apartheid ===
During the negotiations to end apartheid the Interim Constitution was enacted. It introduced universal suffrage on a non-racial basis, and replaced first-past-the-post voting with party-list proportional representation. South Africans of all races took part in the first fully democratic elections in 1994. &quot;Universal adult suffrage, a national common voters roll, regular elections and a multi-party system of democratic government&quot; are founding principles of the 1996 Constitution of South Africa, and the right of all citizens to vote is included in the Bill of Rights.

In the post-apartheid era, the Constitutional Court has struck down two attempts by the government to deny the vote to convicted criminals in prison. The court has also ruled that South Africans living outside the country must be allowed to vote. In 2020 in the &quot;New Nation Movement&quot; case the court ruled that the pure party-list electoral system is unconstitutional because it prevents individuals from standing as candidates without joining a political party; Parliament was given two years to adopt a new electoral system. As of the 2024 General Elections a third provincial ballot was adopted. This ballot facilitates the election of independent candidates.

== Voting districts ==

Each voter in South Africa is assigned to a voting district based on the voter&#x27;s residence at the time that they registered to vote. Each voting district is uniquely associated with a single voting station. Voters who are outside their registered district on election day may vote at another polling station, but additional paperwork is required. Voting districts have no significance outside of the election process, and district boundaries are drawn for purposes of efficiently planning and administering elections. Urban voting districts are drawn to have a population of around 3,000 within a radius of , and rural voting districts are drawn to have a population of around 1,200 within a radius of .

As of 2019, there were 22,933 voting districts nationwide. The district boundaries are set by the Electoral Commission&#x27;s Delimitation Directorate, and are reviewed and adjusted before each election.

<text>A training corset is generally a corset used in body modification. A training corset is believed to help orthopedic issues (such as in attempt to correct a poor posture) and it is believed to help cosmetic issues (such as waistline, commonly called waist training or in more extreme cases tightlacing.)

In addition, the term &quot;training corset&quot; may refer to a corset which is used to acclimate the body prior to wearing a full corset as an everyday undergarment, this concept is called waist train.

==Redresseur corset==
The redresseur corset or preparatory corset was a form of training corset used from the mid-19th century into the early 20th century, designed specifically for young adolescent girls who had not worn stays from an early stage. In addition to moulding a pronounced waist, it served as a back harness and was intended to improve posture.

In a number periods of western history, children were put in stays as soon as they could sit upright or walk. It was believed that the young body was too soft to grow upright on its own. Boys stopped wearing them once they were breeched, i.e. were changed from toddler&#x27;s dresses to boy&#x27;s breeches at about 4-7. Girls continued to wear them for their whole lives. It was not until the late 19th century that this practice began to fall away.

==Orthopedic corsets==

Corsets may be worn for orthopedic reasons, such as correcting a crooked spine, poor posture or straightening the back and shoulders.

==Waist training corsets==

It was primarily in the 19th century when corsets were used to noticeably reduce a woman&#x27;s waist in order to achieve a fashionable hourglass figure. The corset was laced progressively tighter, forcing the floating ribs upward and compressing the soft tissue at the waist. This could lead to many negative health ramifications, including difficulty breathing, problems with digestion, and permanent deformity.

Waist training, or waist reduction, generally uses an hourglass corset. Waist reduction, sometimes called &quot;tightlacing&quot;, is often used by women who are post-pregnancy or by women involved in BDSM. 

No structural features distinguish a modern waist training corset from a corset worn as an external garment for special occasions. Training corsets are usually made from strong fabric (or leather) and with relatively inflexible boning (molding body shape requires a strong corset). A training corset is designed to be used every day, and can be hidden under clothing.

<doc id="924101" wikidata="Q1142950" url="?curid=924101" title="Lilya 4-ever">
<text>Lilya 4-ever () is a 2002 crime drama film written and directed by Lukas Moodysson, which was released in Sweden on 23 August 2002. It depicts the downward spiral of Lilja Michailova, played by Oksana Akinshina, a girl in the former Soviet Union whose mother abandons her to move to the United States. The story is loosely based on the true case of Danguolė Rasalaitė, and examines the issue of human trafficking and sexual slavery.

The film received positive reviews both in Sweden and abroad. It won five Guldbagge Awards including Best Film, as well as was nominated for Best Film and Best Actress at the European Film Awards.

==Plot==
The film begins with a girl running towards a motorway bridge. When the girl turns around, the film introduces the audience to Lilya Michailova, an adolescent girl who has recently been badly beaten. The film then reveals her past.

Lilya lives with her mother in a run-down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union. Lilya&#x27;s mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother&#x27;s new boyfriend, but instead, she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt while she and the boyfriend move to America. The aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat Lilya and her mother had lived in while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment.

A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilya. Her best friend Natasha encourages her to join her in prostitution, but Lilya declines. When money is discovered in Natasha&#x27;s possession, she lies and says the money belongs to Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. This culminates in Lilya being raped by a group of boys she knows. She ultimately has to become a prostitute to support herself.

Meanwhile, Lilya forms another close, protective friendship with a younger boy named Volodya, who is physically abused by his alcoholic single father. She buys Volodya a basketball, but his father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She then meets a young man, Andrei, who becomes her boyfriend and convinces her to move to Sweden, where he says she will have a better life. After arriving in Sweden, she is instead met by a pimp named Witek who takes her to a nearly empty apartment where he imprisons and rapes her. Lilya is then forced to perform sexual acts for a large number of clients.

Despondent over the departure of his only friend, Volodya commits suicide, his soul taking the form of an angel. In his new guise, Volodya comes to Lilya to watch over her and says being in heaven is really good but he wishes he&#x27;d stayed alive for longer. On Christmas Day, he transports Lilya to the roof of the apartment building where they lived and, deeply regretting having killed himself, gives her the world as a present, but Lilya rejects the gift because the world is cold and not that good. After an escape attempt, Lilya is violently beaten by her pimp, but she escapes when he forgets to lock the door to the apartment he imprisoned her inside of. Lilya panics when she sees a policewoman pull up outside a gas station (Witek had lied to her that if she tried to escape, the police would deport her back to her country and his partners would find and kill her there) and runs through the streets of Malmö before stopping on a bridge and crying tears of exhaustion and defeat. With the story arriving full circle to the scene at the beginning of the film, Lilya ignores Volodya&#x27;s angel as he begs her to stop and jumps from the bridge overpass to her death.

The film&#x27;s conclusion presents two different endings. One version shows Lilya being sent back in time after killing herself to when she made the decision to go to Sweden with Andrei. However, this time she rejects Andrei&#x27;s offer, and she and Volodya are shown to presumably live happier lives. In the final scene, Lilya and Volodya are both angels happily playing basketball on the roof of a tenement building.

==Production==
===Writing and pre-production===
The script was loosely based on the life of Danguolė Rasalaitė, a 16-year-old girl from Lithuania whose case had made headlines in Sweden in 2000. A male acquaintance helped Rasalaitė travel to Sweden with the promise of a job in Malmö. When she arrived, a man referred to as &quot;the Russian,&quot; who would become her pimp, took her passport and told her she would have to repay him 20,000 SEK (US$2410 in 1999; $ today) for travel expenses and she was forced to prostitute herself for the next month. She escaped from the apartment where she was being held in the rough suburb of Arlöv, moved to Malmö and after three months, the day after she had been raped by her boyfriend and two other men, jumped from a bridge on 7 January 2000 and died three days later in hospital. Three letters she was carrying with her unravelled the story. The screenplay was originally supposed to be deeply religious, with Jesus being a prominent character, walking next to Lilja throughout the story. Moodysson wrote the script in Swedish and then had it translated into Russian.

Production was led by Moodysson&#x27;s usual studio Memfis Film. Co-producers were Film i Väst, Sveriges Television, and Zentropa. Financial support was provided by the Swedish and Danish Film Institutes as well as Nordisk Film- &amp; TV-Fond. The budget was 30 million SEK.

During the casting period, Moodysson and the crew interviewed &quot;something like 1000&quot; young applicants for the leading roles. The actors had to improvise on a scenario where they had been grounded and were trying to convince their mother to let them go out. While Artyom Bogucharsky had no previous acting experience, Oksana Akinshina had already starred in Sergei Bodrov, Jr.&#x27;s 2001 crime film &quot;Sisters&quot;. Moodysson has commented Akinshina as &quot;[not] exactly what I had imagined. She is better than I imagined but different, somehow.&quot;

===Filming and post-production===

As Moodysson recalls, filming took &quot;something like 40 days&quot; to finish in total. Outdoor scenes set in the former Soviet Union were shot in Paldiski, Estonia, a former nuclear submarine training centre for the Soviet Navy. Swedish exteriors were filmed in Malmö and studio scenes in Trollhättan. Interpreters had to be present for the Russian actors to be able to understand Moodysson, who in turn had to direct based on emotional impression from the actors&#x27; intonation rather than the words. When the lines didn&#x27;t sound well he would ask the actors to drop the script and improvise. One of the interpreters was Alexandra Dahlström, the star from Moodysson&#x27;s debut feature &quot;Show Me Love&quot;. Dahlström, whose mother is of Russian descent, also served as assistant director, which the producers held as an advantage since she was the same age as the title character.

Director of photography was Ulf Brantås, who started his career as a cinematographer for Roy Andersson and had filmed both of Moodysson&#x27;s previous feature films. &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot; was shot with an Aaton XTR Prod on 16mm film which was later transferred to 35mm. Minimum lighting was used, mainly from practicals and whenever possible only sunlight. Locations were only sparsely rigged by the crew. A custom built rickshaw, made from the wheels of a mountain bike, was used for the long rearward-facing tracking shots. No correction filters were used though the stock was eventually graded in post-production in order to appear slightly warmer.

==Release==
On 23 August 2002, Sonet Film released &quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot; in Swedish cinemas. Several festival appearances followed including Venice, Toronto, Vancouver, and London Film Festival. A limited release in the United States begun on 18 April 2003 through Newmarket Films. Metrodome released it on 25 April 2003 in the United Kingdom, where it opened in 13 theatres. The Australian premiere followed on 7 August the same year, distributed by Potential Films.

The film has also been utilised by humanitarian organisations, in information campaigns against human trafficking in various Eastern European countries. In Moldova, the International Organization for Migration received the distribution rights and organised screenings attended by 60,000 people, mostly young females but also members of the government.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Swedish critics were very positive to &quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot; upon its release. Malena Janson started her review in &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; by hailing Moodysson&#x27;s ability to address different themes and emotional spectra, thereby escaping comparison between his pictures. Janson went on to compare the directing to Lars von Trier&#x27;s &quot;Breaking the Waves&quot; and &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;, but found &quot;Lilja 4-ever&quot; to be superior: &quot;What particularly distinguishes Moodysson&#x27;s from von Trier&#x27;s destruction tales and makes it so much more gruesome, are the ties to reality. While we&#x27;re sitting in the movie theatre and delight and torment ourselves through this masterpiece, happens outside exactly what Lilja encounters perhaps only a few kilometres or miles away from us.&quot; The film was fairly successful at the Swedish box office, although significantly less so than Moodysson&#x27;s previous films. &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot; sold 270,000 tickets during the theatrical run, compared to 867,584 for &quot;Show Me Love&quot; and 882,000 for &quot;Together&quot;.

The film was embraced by most English-language critics as well. As of December 2023, it holds an 85% approval from 72 reviews listed at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The consensus states: &quot;A tragic, hard-hitting story about a teenager trapped in a life of prostitution.&quot; Metacritic gives a score of 83 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

It was rated with four out of five stars by Michael Hayden in the British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot;, where he praised the performance by Oksana Akinshina and wrote that the film was &quot;the darkest of fairy tales, complete with wicked aunts and guardian angels&quot; while being &quot;reminiscent of Ken Loach at his most socially aware&quot;. Manohla Dargis of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that the image of the girl lured into prostitution might be a cliché, but held the director&#x27;s honest intention as an acceptable excuse: &quot;Moodysson wants us to see that there&#x27;s a real person under the platitudes&quot;. She also noted that while the story might be unpleasant to take part of, the discomfort is surpassed by the sheer quality of the film: &quot;This isn&#x27;t an easy film -- only a memorable one.&quot; A negative review came from &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot;″s Tony Rayns. Rayns dismissed the film as melodramatic and lacking in substance, while also criticizing the stylistic choice of the dream sequences, as well as the soundtrack&#x27;s composition: &quot;The most extreme case is [the] use of Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot;, played at woofer-challenging volume over the opening and closing scenes. ... Even if we take the volume as a metaphor for the girl&#x27;s wish to block out the world, it&#x27;s absurd to imagine that Lilja would ever relate to or even listen to a Rammstein track in German. So the wall of sound comes from some &#x27;higher&#x27; version of MTV, not from the character or story.&quot; Rayns ignored at the time that Rammstein was extremely popular in Russia.

===Awards and honors===
&quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot; won several awards from film festivals around the world including Best Film at Gijón International Film Festival. Akinshina won the awards for Best Actress both in Gijón and at Rouen Nordic Film Festival. Ulf Brantås was prized for Best Cinematography at Zimbabwe International Film Festival and Moodysson won the award for Best Director at Brasília International Film Festival.

The film was the big winner at the 2003 Guldbagge Awards where it received prizes for Best Film, Best Direction, Best Screenplay, Akinshina as Best Actress and Best Cinematography. Bogucharsky was also nominated for Best Actor. It was nominated for Best Film and Best Actress at the European Film Awards. It was Sweden&#x27;s submission for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 75th Academy Awards, which sparked some controversy when the academy considered to deem it ineligible since the primary language is not Swedish. Eventually it was accepted, but failed to be nominated. In November 2009 the film magazine &quot;FLM&quot; published a list of the 10 best Swedish films of the decade as voted by 26 of the country&#x27;s leading critics. &quot;Lilya 4-ever&quot; appeared as number three on the list, surpassed only by &quot;Involuntary&quot; and &quot;Songs from the Second Floor&quot;.

<doc id="924102" wikidata="Q2168916" url="?curid=924102" title="Willington, Derbyshire">
<text>Willington is a village and civil parish in the South Derbyshire district of Derbyshire, England. The 2001 Census recorded a parish population of 2,604, increasing to 2,862 at the 2011 Census.

The 2021 Census recorded a population of 3,277 incorporating the expanded Mercia Marina and full parish boundary.

==Geography==
Willington is on the River Trent about southwest of Derby. The parish is within of the Staffordshire county boundary and the village is about northeast of Burton upon Trent.

The village is at the crossroads of the north–south B5008 road (for Findern, Repton and Winshill), and the east–west A5132 road (formerly the B5009, linking Hilton and Swarkestone). The A5132 carried a lot of Nottingham – Stoke-on-Trent traffic before the A50 road was opened in September 1997.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The toponym Willington is derived from the Old English &quot;tun&quot; (homestead or farm) among the willows. In the Domesday Book, the village is called &quot;Willetune&quot; or &quot;Willentune&quot;, and the land was held by Ralph FitzHubert and was an agricultural village on the flood plain of the Trent. The village is recorded as &quot;Wilintun&quot; in about 1150 and as &quot;Wyliton&quot; in 1230.

===Manors===
Willington, in the hundred of Morleston and Litchurch, comprised two estates as recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, one held by the king in demesne, the other by Ralph FitzHubert:
====Royal manor====
King Henry II (1154–1189) gave a manor in Willington to Burton Abbey. This estate was held in 1539 from Burton Abbey by George Finderne, Esquire. John Meynell, Esquire, died seised of it in 1561 and it was sold in 1760 by his descendant Hugo Meynell, Esq. to Sir Henry Harpur, 6th Baronet (1739–1789), the father of Sir Henry Crewe, 7th Baronet (1763–1819) who was the proprietor in 1817. No remains survive of the Meynell&#x27;s manor house.

====de Willington&#x27;s manor====
The other manor appears to have been held from FitzHubert by the de Willington family, which took its name from the manor. It appears to have given this manor together with the advowson of the church to Repton Abbey, to whom the tithes were appropriated in 1223. The de Willingtons were later seated at Yate and Sandhurst in Gloucestershire, and later at Umberleigh in Devon. In about 1554 William Westcote conveyed this manor to Sir John Port (d.1557), founder of Repton School and of the hospital at Etwall, and in 1817 it continued to form part of the estate belonging to those foundations, which also held the tithes and advowson of the vicarage.

===Later history===
In the 17th century Willington became the highest navigable port on the Trent. It first began to grow from a population of 477 with the construction of the Trent and Mersey Canal in 1777, the same year Bass beer in Burton was started, at which time it became a small inland port and a village with four public houses: the Railway (which was later demolished), the Rising Sun, the Green Man and the Green Dragon (now just called The Dragon), all selling locally brewed beers from Burton upon Trent for the many Irish canal navvies.

The railway was built in 1838, the railway station being called Repton and Willington railway station and brought the scholars to nearby Repton School. The main-line station was closed in 1964 but a new station was opened in the 1990s as part of the (incomplete) Ivanhoe Line project to link Leicester and Burton-on-Trent and runs mainline trains to Derby, Birmingham and beyond. The village&#x27;s population increased to 708 by 1940. Trentside Cottage, Bargate Lane is the oldest cottage in the village. A 200-year-old Cedar of Lebanon lies on the site of the now-demolished Potlock&#x27;s Farm on Twyford Road in the village. The bridge over the Trent was opened on 7 August 1839, being the only one between Swarkestone and Burton. To commemorate the centenary of the abolishing of the bridge toll in 1898, an annual raft race has been held since 1998 from nearby Newton Solney along the River Trent to Willington&#x27;s bridge.

In 1995 Willington railway station was re-opened at a cost of £565,000 funded by the EU. Some scenes from the 2018 film &quot;Get Gone&quot; were filmed at Willington train station.

==Economy==
A former cheese factory in 1920 became a reclaimed aluminium processing plant in 1964 dominating the southern part of the village for twenty years and it was hoped that aluminium car engines would be made nearby for the Toyota Manufacturing UK (TMUK). The site is now closed and the land for sale.

Due to the opening of the nearby Toyota car factory (on the A38/A50) in 1992 between Willington (on the former Derby airfield at Burnaston) and Findern, the village has prospered and expanded since the 1980s.

Local shops include a post office and newsagent, florist, Co-op supermarket, delicatessen/cafe, beautician, hairdresser, barbers, vets, hardware and DIY, general store, pharmacy, Indian restaurant, chip shop, a Chinese take-away and the three pubs mentioned above.

The thriving Mercia Marina is the largest inland marina in Europe. As well as 360 permanent boat moarings, the marina has holiday lodges and short term moorings. A vibrant tourist destination with restaurants, bars, shops, art-galleries, furnishings as well as numerous offices. The Marina is due to expand further in 2024 with planning approved for new shops and apartments. 

Willington has a large GP practice incorporating a dentist, a Church of England parish church and Baptist Chapel, a large modern primary school and nearby in Etwall (within Willington&#x27;s catchment area) an expanding secondary school, John Port Spencer Academy.

Opening in 2022 Talbot Turf was relocated from Hilton to Willington, Talbot Turf have been sole provider of resurfacing work on many large-scale projects including Derby County FC, Wembley Stadium and the Olympic Stadium.

As of 2024, Willington Parish Council are completing their Neighbourhood Development Plan which if approved will create a development framework to cover until 2039.

===Willington Power Station===

In the 1950s, two coal-fired power stations were built on a site off Twyford Road, between Willington and Findern. The stations were privatised and sold to National Power in the early 1990s and eventually closed in the mid-1990s. Although most of the stations were demolished at the turn of the millennium, the five cooling towers continue to dominate the skyline of the local area. The site was earmarked for a large residential development, but the application was rejected and in 2011 permission was granted for a new gas fuelled power station to be built on the site.

In the mid-1990s a pair of peregrine falcons nested in one of the site&#x27;s huge cooling towers. Unlike many bird of prey breeding sites, this was widely publicised because of its impregnable location.

The power station was also the subject of a short documentary by Channel 4 titled &quot;Drones in Forbidden Zones&quot;.

The site is currently mothballed whilst renewable energy options are sought.

===Bus company===
Blue Bus Services (Tailby &amp; George Ltd) operated a depot on Repton Road from 1922. The company was privately owned until December 1973 when it was sold to Derby Corporation. Tragically, two years later on 5 January 1976, almost the entire original Blue Buses fleet was destroyed by a fire at the depot. The Saxon Grove and Tailby Drive residential estate was built on the site in the late 1980s (Named after Percy Tailby, co-owner of the Blue Bus Service).

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Waltham or Sutton Coldfield transmitters. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Derby, Capital Mid-Counties, Smooth East Midlands and Greatest Hits Radio Midlands.

==Notable residents==
*John Wetton (1949–2017), musician, member of King Crimson and founder of Asia.

==Nature reserve==
Although some of the former ARC owned aggregate quarry was back-filled with pulverised fuel ash transported via a pipeline from the power station, the remaining gravel pits at the southern edge of the village adjacent to the River Trent have now become a wetland nature reserve managed by the Derbyshire Wildlife Trust and developed with the aid of the Environment Agency.

In September 2021, Derbyshire Wildlife Trust successfully relocated beavers from the River Tay in Scotland. The pair of beavers were the first to be in Derbyshire for over 800. Another pair from Devon, were introduced shortly afterwards. The reintroduction was successful and two beaver kits were born in July 2022.

<text>The 42nd Infantry Division (42ID) (&quot;Rainbow&quot;) is a division of the United States Army National Guard. It was nicknamed the Rainbow Division because, during rapid mobilization for service in WW1, it was formed from 27 National Guard units from across the US. The division was engaged in four major operations between July 1918 and the armistice in November 1918, and demobilized in 1919. Since World War I, the 42nd Infantry Division has served in World War II and the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT).

The division is currently headquartered at the Glenmore Road Armory in Troy, New York. The division headquarters is a unit of the New York Army National Guard. The division currently includes Army National Guard units from fourteen different states, including Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont. , 67 percent of 42ID soldiers are located in New York and New Jersey.

==World War I==


===Rainbow Division===
When the United States entered World War I by declaring war on Germany in April 1917, it federalized the National Guard and organized many of its units into divisions to quickly build up the Army. Douglas MacArthur, then a major, suggested to Major General William Abram Mann, the head of the Militia Bureau, that he form a division from the units of several states that had not been assigned to divisions. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker approved the proposal, and recalled MacArthur saying that such an organization would &quot;stretch over the whole country like a rainbow.&quot;

On 1 August 1917, the War Department directed the formation of a composite National Guard division, comprising units from 26 states and the District of Columbia. As a result, the 42nd Division came to be known as the &quot;Rainbow Division&quot;. The name stuck, and MacArthur was promoted to colonel and became the division&#x27;s chief of staff, with Mann as its commander.

The 42nd Division was assembled in August 1917 at Camp Mills, New York, four months after the American entry into World War I. The 42nd arrived at the Western Front of Belgium and France in November 1917, one of the first divisions of the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF) to do so, under the command of Mann, although he was soon to be replaced by Major General Charles T. Menoher, who remained in this position for the rest of the war. Colonel Douglas MacArthur was the division&#x27;s chief of staff until assigned command of its 84th Brigade. 

After initially landing at St. Nazaire, France, the 42nd was temporarily located at Vaucouleurs, Lorraine, from 7 November – 7 December 1917, to preliminarily train before transferring to another training area between Lafauche and Rimaucourt. The day after Christmas, the 42nd, along with other divisions it had now linked up with, departed for another training area near Rolampont, Langres. French officers had been attached to the 42nd at Lafauche, Rimaucourt, and Rolampont as instructors in trench warfare who &quot;...seemed, from Menoher and MacArthur&#x27;s view, to think more highly of the Rainbow&#x27;s performance than did AEF commander General John Pershing and his Chaumont staff&quot;.

&quot;On February 13, 1918, the day that the [3-day] inspection [by General Pershing&#x27;s headquarter&#x27;s staff from Chaumont was completed, Pershing ordered the 42nd division to move to the Lunéville sector of southern Lorraine for a month&#x27;s training at the front with the French VII Corps&quot;. &quot;Rainbow division entrained for the Lunéville sector on February 16, 1918, and it was joined by the 67th Field Artillery Brigade shortly thereafter. Rainbow&#x27;s soldiers were distributed over the entire sixteen-mile front of the sector, from Lunéville past St. Clément to Baccarat. As far as administration, supply, and discipline were concerned, the division was part of Major general Hunter Liggett&#x27;s I Corps, A.E.F., but for combat and training purposes it was under Major General Georges de Bazelaire, of the French VII Army Corps, with each of the 42nd&#x27;s regiments assigned to one of the French Divisions holding the sector. Each American battalion served one week at a time on the front line, then spent the next week on the second line of defense, and the third week in reserve Acute shortages of some types of equipment still existed, as evidenced, for example, by Menoher&#x27;s order order that 
troops of a battalion leaving the front line were to yield their pistols to the men of the relieving battalion&quot;.

On 16 June 1918, General Pershing ordered the 42nd to entrain to &quot;the Champagne region east of Rheims (a sector comparatively more active than Baccarat) to be assigned to General Henri Gouraud&#x27;s Fourth Army&quot;; relinquishing the current Baccarat sector &quot;to the relieving American 77th and French 61st divisions&quot;.

During 1918, Rainbow division, specifically with the 67th Field Artillery&#x27;s &quot;1650 projectiles&quot; in the Bois des Chiens, engaged German forces with and experienced bombardment by German forces with deadly, poison-gas bombardments, specifically with German 75-mm. and 105-mm. shells filled with palite and yperite (also known as Mustard gas). The 42nd took part in four major operations during the last four months of World War I: the Champagne-Marne, the Aisne-Marne, the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, and the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. In total, it saw 164 days of combat, third behind only the 1st Infantry Division (220 days) and 26th Infantry Division (193 days).

*Casualties: total 14,683 (KIA/DOW – 2,810; WIA – 11,873).
*Commanders: MG W. A. Mann (5 September 1917), Brig. Gen. Charles T. Menoher (19 December 1917), Maj. Gen. Charles D. Rhodes, (7 November 1918), Brig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur (10 November 1918), Maj. Gen. C. A. F. Flagler (22 November 1918), Brig. Gen. George G. Gatley (28 March 1919), Maj. Gen. George Windle Read (10 April 1919 to Division&#x27;s deactivation on 9 May 1919).

The 42nd Division was demobilized in May 1919 at Camp Upton, New York, Camp Grant, Illinois, Camp Dix, New Jersey, and Camp Dodge, Iowa.

===Rainbow unit insignia===


The 42nd Division adopted a shoulder patch and distinctive unit insignia acknowledging the nickname. Division lore includes the story that division commander Charles T. Menoher approved the patch after observing a rainbow shortly before a battle, deciding this was a favorable omen. The original version of the patch symbolized a half arc rainbow and contained thin bands in multiple colors. During the latter part of World War I and post war occupation duty in Germany, the patch was changed to a quarter arc. According to the division&#x27;s official history, Colonel William N. Hughes Jr., who had succeeded MacArthur as chief of staff, was credited with modifying the design to a quarter arc in an attempt to standardize it. According to World War I veterans of the 42nd Division, soldiers removed half the original symbol to memorialize the half of the division&#x27;s soldiers who had been killed or wounded during the war. They also reduced the number of colors to just red, gold and blue bordered in green, to standardize the design and make the patch easier to reproduce.

Description: The 4th quadrant of a rainbow with three bands of color: red, gold and blue, each 3/8-inch (.95 cm) in width, outer radius 2 inches (5.08 cm); all within a 1/8-inch (.32 cm) Army green border.

Background: The shoulder sleeve insignia was originally authorized by telegram on 29 October 1918. It was officially authorized for wear on 27 May 1922. It was reauthorized for wear when the division was reactivated for World War II. On 8 September 1947, it was authorized for the post-World War II 42nd Infantry Division when it was reactivated as a National Guard unit.

When reconstituted in the Army of the United States on 5 February 1943, the 42ID was a unique unit, as it continued the lineage of the Rainbow Division from World War I. The officer and enlisted cadre came from the 102nd Infantry Division and from personnel stationed at bases in Hawaii and Newfoundland, while the enlisted fillers came from every state; from the division&#x27;s activation until it stood down in Austria, the division displayed not only the national and divisional colors, but all 48 state colors (state flags) at every formal assembly. To emphasize the 42ID&#x27;s continued lineage from the 42ID of World War I, division commander Major General Harry J. Collins issued the orders that activated the unit on 14 July, the eve of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Champagne-Marne campaign in France.

From January to September 1944, the 42nd Infantry Division was subject to large-scale removals of personnel to adhere to War Department policies stating that the greatest possible proportion of men sent overseas as replacements should have at least six months of training, prohibiting the sending of soldiers who were younger than nineteen or who had children conceived prior to Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor overseas as replacements unless men could be found from other sources, to supplement the capacity of replacement training centers, and to build up a reserve of replacements for Operation Overlord.

From January to September, a cumulative total of 15,000 men were transferred out of the division, its three infantry regiments losing 5,600 men from January to April. Beginning in the latter month, &quot;when the initial age rules began to have a substantial effect&quot; on manpower utilization, and until September, the division lost 3,936 infantrymen, 840 field artillerymen, and 45 cavalrymen. Major withdrawals ceased in July, and the division was ordered to start an abbreviated training program from the ground up. In mid-October 1944, 25% of the men in the division&#x27;s regiments had been members since January 1944 or before, 20% had joined from replacement training centers during the past thirty days, 20% were former Army Specialized Training Program students or aviation cadets with approximately five months of training in the division, and 35% were men from other arms, principally antiaircraft, with approximately four months of training in the division.

On 14 October 1944, the three infantry regiments were alerted for imminent overseas movement, and the entire division was restricted to Camp Gruber. The disruption caused by the withdrawal of personnel and advancement of readiness dates meant that the division did not get the chance to participate in major division-versus-division maneuvers.

===Combat chronicle===

The three infantry regiments (222nd, 232nd, &amp; 242nd) and a detachment of the 42ID Headquarters arrived in France at Marseille on 8 to 9 December 1944, and were formed into Task Force (TF) Linden, under Henning Linden, the Assistant Division Commander (ADC). As part of the Seventh Army&#x27;s VI Corps, TF Linden entered combat in the vicinity of Strasbourg, relieving elements of the 36ID on 24 December 1944.

While defending on a 31-mile sector along the Rhine north and south of Strasbourg in January 1945, TF Linden repulsed a number of enemy counterattacks at Hatten and other locations during the German &quot;Operation Northwind&quot; offensive. At the headquarters of 1st Battalion, 242nd Infantry, Private First Class Vito R. Bertoldo waged a 48-hour defense of the battalion command post, for which he received the Medal of Honor. When the command post was attacked by a German tank with its 88-mm. gun and machine gun fire, Bertoldo remained at his post, and with his own machine gun killed the occupants of the tank when they tried to remove mines which were blocking their advance. On 24 and 25 January 1945, in the Bois D&#x27;Ohlungen, and the vicinity of Schweighouse-sur-Moder and Neubourg, the 222nd Infantry Regiment held a position covering a front of 7,500 yards, three times the normal frontage for a regiment in defense. After a two-hour artillery bombardment, the 222nd Infantry Regiment was repeatedly attacked by elements of the German 7th Parachute, 47th Volks Grenadier Division, and the 25th Panzer Grenadier Division. During the ensuing struggle, one company of the 222nd Infantry was surrounded, but withdrew from their position and infiltrated back through the Germans to the regimental lines after exhausting all but 35 rounds of ammunition. For 24 hours, the battle raged, but the Germans were never able to break through the 222nd lines. For this action the 222nd Infantry Regiment was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation (2001). After these enemy attacks, TF Linden returned to reserve of the 7th Army and trained with the remainder of the 42ID which had arrived in the meantime.

On 14 February 1945, the 42ID as a whole entered combat. Initially occupying defensive positions near Haguenau, after a month of patrolling in the Hardt Forest, the division went on the offensive. During the night of 27 February, elements of the German 6th Mountain Division were withdrawn under cover of heavy artillery and mortar fire and replaced by the 221st Volksgrenadier Regiment. In the brief period this unit had been in the line, German soldiers had come to fear the 42nd Division&#x27;s patrols and raids. &quot;Is your Division a part of Roosevelt&#x27;s SS?&quot; asked one German when captured. The remark circulated and men kidded each other about being in the Rainbow SS. The 42ID attacked through the Hardt Forest during 15 to 21 March, broke through the Siegfried Line, and cleared Dahn and Busenberg, while Third Army created and expanded bridgeheads across the Rhine. Moving across the Rhine on 31 March, the division captured Wertheim am Main on 1 April and Würzburg on 6 April, following a fierce battle from 2 to 6 April. Schweinfurt fell next after hand-to-hand engagements during the period of 9 to 12 April. Fürth, near Nuremberg, put up fanatical resistance on 18 and 19 April but was taken by the 42ID.

On 25 April, the 42ID captured Donauwörth on the Danube. On 29 April, units of the 42nd Division liberated some 30,000 inmates at Dachau concentration camp. In mid-May, 42nd Division patrols arrested German war criminal Arthur Greiser and Waffen-SS officer Heinz Reinefarth.

The 42nd Division ended World War II on occupation duty in Austria and was inactivated by the end of January 1947.

==Cold War==
On 13 October 1945, the War Department published a postwar policy statement for the entire Army. After the policy statement was published, the Army Staff prepared a postwar National Guard troop basis, which included twenty-four divisions, including the 42nd Infantry Division. Most soldiers considered the 42nd, initially organized with state troops in 1917, as a Guard formation. During the process, New York successfully petitioned the War Department for all units of the 42nd Infantry Division. After the state governors formally notified the National Guard Bureau that they accepted the new troop allotments, the bureau authorized reorganization of the units with 100 percent of their officers and 80 percent of their enlisted personnel. By September 1947, the 42nd Division headquarters, along with all the other new Guard divisional headquarters, had received federal recognition.

In April 1963, the 42nd Division was reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Division structure. From 1967 to 1969, the division was briefly part of the Selected Reserve Force, designed to reinforce the active army in Vietnam. In a 1968 reorganization, the division was split between the New York Army National Guard and the Pennsylvania Army National Guard. In 1973–74, the division was converted back into an all-New York organization.

In the 1970s, the division headquarters was located at the armory at 125 West 14th Street in Manhattan. It was relocated in December 1989 to the Glenmore Armory in Troy, New York and remains there to this day.

In post-Cold War restructuring of the early 1990s, the 42nd Infantry Division absorbed the units of the 26th Infantry Division and the 50th Armored Division of the Massachusetts and New Jersey Army National Guard, respectively, All three divisions were severely understrength, so the assets of the three were combined into one. The 50th Brigade, created from the assets of the disbanding 50th Armored Division, was initially assigned to the 42nd Infantry Division as an armored brigade, but was transformed to an infantry brigade combat team (BCT) in the very first years of the 21st century as part of Army modularity.

==Global War on Terrorism==
Since the 11 September attacks, the 42ID has been extensively involved in the war on terrorism, in both homeland security (HLS) and expeditionary operations. The 42ID&#x27;s 1–101st Cavalry led the New York Army National Guard&#x27;s efforts and provided security at Ground Zero during the rescue and then recovery efforts there. 42ID units from the New Jersey Army National Guard provided security at all the major river crossings into New York City and Newark International Airport in the months following 11 September 2001.

The first major overseas effort of the 42ID was the deployment of elements of the 50th BCT/42ID to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba. The 2–102nd Armor Battalion deployed as ILO MP&#x27;s and served with the Joint Detention Operation Group in the detention facility. The 2nd Battalion, 113th Infantry deployed to Guantanamo Bay as well and provided security for the Joint Task Force at Camp Delta. While there elements of the 2nd Battalion, 102nd Armor supported the first military tribunals held at the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility. Elements have also deployed to the Horn of Africa and Djibouti. New Jersey&#x27;s 3/112th Field Artillery and 5/117th Cavalry deployed as an ILO Military Police Company with 89th MP Brigade/759th Military Police Battalion; served in Sadr City, and worked alongside the First Cavalry Division. Stationed out of Camp Cuervo (Al Rustimayah) in Baghdad, platoons also worked with U.S. Marines in Fallujah. On 4 June 2004, SSG Carvill and SGT Duffy were killed and the following day the unit lost SPC Doltz and SSG Timoteo.
The 2/108th Infantry deployed to Iraq in 2004. In 2004–05, the 1/69 Infantry served in Iraq, eventually providing security on the Baghdad International Airport (BIAP) Road. The 42nd Combat Aviation Brigade also deployed to Iraq during this period.

In 2004, the division headquarters and division troops of the 42nd Infantry Division deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) III, relieving the 1st Infantry Division (1ID). The division controlled the north-central Iraq area of operations. Serving as the command and control (C2) of Task Force Liberty, the 42ID took over responsibility for the area known as Multi-National Division North Central (MND-NC) including the provinces of Saladin, Diyala, At Ta&#x27;amim (Kirkuk) and As Sulymaniah from the 1st Infantry Division on 14 February 2005. The 42ID directed the operations of: 1st BCT, 3ID; 3rd BCT, 3ID; the 278th ACR; 3rd- 313rd Field Artillery, 56th BCT (Texas Army National Guard); and the 116th Cavalry Brigade Combat Team (Idaho, Oregon, and Montana Army National Guard). Soldiers conducted combat actions and raids, seized weapons caches, destroyed improvised explosive devices (IEDs), trained Iraqi army forces, and worked on reconstruction to ensure free elections. 1–69th Infantry of the 42ID manned the checkpoint where Italian SISMI officer Nicola Calipari was shot and killed.

Maj. Gen. Joseph J. Taluto, commanding general of the division during its deployment, commended the many contributions of the 42ID led Task Force Liberty. Vice Chief of Staff of the Army (VCSA), Gen. Richard Cody, saluted members of the 42ID at the unit&#x27;s homecoming ceremony. The division&#x27;s Headquarters and Headquarters Company was awarded the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation for its service in Iraq.

In 2008, 26 company-sized elements of the 50th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT), headquartered at Fort Dix, New Jersey, deployed to Iraq bringing the total number of NJ National Guard soldiers sent to Iraq and Afghanistan to over 3,200. These elements of the 50th IBCT were mobilized for one year, including stateside training and &quot;boots on the ground&quot; in theater. Premobilization training began in 2007 and took place in New Jersey, with further OIF specific preparation conducted at other Army installations out-of-state. Originally slated to deploy to Iraq in 2010, these elements deployed earlier as a result of changes needed to comply with new Department of Defense (DoD) policies. Earlier, in 2007, the DoD had reduced the amount of time units spend overseas in a combat theater, which in turn shifted mobilization schedules and required earlier deployments than anticipated. Elements of the 50th IBCT had deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) previously in 2004.

In 2008, the 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (IBCT), headquartered in Syracuse, New York, was mobilized and deployed to Afghanistan to train Afghan National Army (ANA) and police forces. Initial personnel from the 27th IBCT deployed in late 2007, with the majority of the approximately 1,700 service members deployed by mid-2008.

In conjunction around February 2008, soldiers of the 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team were beginning to receive notification of their upcoming deployment. The Brigade Commander at the time was Colonel William F. Roy. In 2009, the brigade did a rotation at JRTC in Fort Polk, LA. In December 2009, the brigade was officially mobilized and to report to Camp Atterbury, IN. While in Indiana, the brigade trained and prepped for their future deployment to Afghanistan. After receiving numerous replacements and volunteer soldiers, the brigade was sent back to JRTC for one more rotation before they left the country.

The majority of the brigade landed in Afghanistan in early March. The brigade headquarters was on Bagram Airfield in RC-East. The brigade was tasked with numerous missions across eastern Afghanistan. The missions included partnering with the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), assisting in the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and securing over 30,000 soldiers on Bagram Airfield while ensuring the base was continuing its daily operations. The brigade left Afghanistan in early December returning to Camp Atterbury, IN. The brigade was released from federal service and returned to the northeast to continue their respective state missions. Several component units of the brigade were awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation for their service from 8 March 2010 – 4 December 2010 while deployed in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.

===Deaths of Esposito and Allen===
Captain Phillip Esposito and First Lieutenant Louis Allen were killed on 7 June 2005, at Forward Operating Base Danger in Tikrit, Iraq by a M18A1 Claymore mine placed in the window of Esposito&#x27;s office. Esposito was the commander of the Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 42ID, while Allen had recently arrived in Iraq to serve as Esposito&#x27;s executive officer, or second in command.

Military investigators determined that the mine was deliberately placed and detonated with the intention of killing Esposito and Allen. Staff Sergeant Alberto B. Martinez, from the officers&#x27; unit, was charged in the killing but was acquitted in a court-martial trial at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, on 4 December 2008. The case was one of only two publicly announced alleged fragging incidents among U.S. forces during the Iraq War.

Subsequently, Siobhan Esposito and Barbara Allen, the widows of the officers, continued to pursue justice for their husbands&#x27; deaths, pushing for the military to strictly enforce regulations that prohibit threats against superiors and require soldiers to report violations of &quot;good order and discipline.&quot;

==Homeland security==
During the Cold War and through the present, the 42ID and its soldiers have been regularly called upon for homeland security missions including disaster relief (such as Hurricane Katrina, Hurricane Floyd), emergency preparedness (such as Y2K missions), airport security, critical infrastructure protection, border security, bridge and tunnel security, as well as rail/train station security.

Several first responders to the 11 September 2001 attacks were members of the 42ID, and led much of the military support to the relief and recovery efforts. The 42ID was part of the relief team for the duration of the effort at Ground Zero in New York City. The 42ID has also been actively engaged in missions supporting Operation Noble Eagle.

In October 2005, elements of the 50th Armored Brigade/42 ID were activated for Operation Hurricane Katrina relief in the city of New Orleans. The 2–102nd Armor and the 1–114th Infantry were called to active duty and the combined unit was dispatched to Louisiana to provide security for FEMA. The 50th Brigade arrived at Belle Chase Naval Air Station and from there went to the New Orleans Convention Center. From there, the elements of the 42nd ID sent teams to various parts of the city on various missions of security ranging from roving patrol to security escort for the New Orleans Fire Department and other relief agencies

<doc id="924105" wikidata="Q508093" url="?curid=924105" title="United States Railroad Administration">
<text>The United States Railroad Administration (USRA) was the name of the nationalized railroad system of the United States between December 28, 1917, and March 1, 1920. It was the largest American experiment with nationalization, and was undertaken against a background of war emergency following American entry into World War I. During its brief existence, the USRA made major investments in the United States railroad system, and introduced standardized locomotive and railroad car classes, known as USRA standard. After the end of World War I, while some in the United States advocated for continuing nationalization, ultimately the railroads were returned to their previous owners in early 1920.

== Background ==
Although the carriers had made massive investments in the first years of the 20th century, there remained inadequacies in terminals, trackage, and rolling stock. Inflation struck the American economy, and when in 1906 Congress empowered the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to set maximum shipping rates, the rail firms had difficulty securing revenue sufficient to keep pace with rising costs. The ICC did allow some increases in rates, however. Ownership of the United States rail network was divided among 441 distinct corporations. Investors had overexpanded the nation&#x27;s trackage, so by late 1915 fully one-sixth of the railroad trackage in the country belonged to roads in receivership (bankruptcy). The national railway investment of $17.5 billion, of which more than half was funded by debt, had an estimated worth of $16 billion.

European nations engaged in World War I ordered $3 billion of munitions from United States factories; and most of this production was routed through a few Atlantic port cities. Terminal facilities in these cities were not designed to handle the resulting volume of export tonnage, though German destruction of Allied cargo ships was ultimately a bigger problem. Thousands of loaded railroad cars were delayed awaiting transfer of their contents to ships; they were essentially used as warehouses. This resulted in a shortage of railroad cars to move normal freight traffic. The United States&#x27; declaration of war on April 6, 1917, increased rail congestion by requiring movement of soldiers from induction points through training facilities to embarkation points.
The railroad unions (commonly called &quot;brotherhoods&quot;), desiring shorter working days and better pay, threatened strike action in the second half of 1916. To avert a strike, President Woodrow Wilson secured Congressional passage of the Adamson Act, which set the eight-hour work day as the industry standard. When the Supreme Court ruled the law constitutional, the carriers had no choice but to comply.

The railroads attempted to coordinate their efforts to support the war by creating the Railroads&#x27; War Board, but private action ran into anti-trust and other regulatory barriers. Observers noted, for example, that sometimes competitive practices prevailed that were not in the best interests of efficient mobilization. Also, government departments sought priority for shipment made on their behalf, and congestion in freight yards, terminals, and port facilities became staggering.

Finally, in December 1917 the ICC recommended federal control of the railroad industry to ensure efficient operation. The takeover measures were to go beyond simply easing the congestion and expediting the flow of goods; they were to bring all parties—management, labor, investors, and shippers—together in a harmonious whole working on behalf of the national interest. President Wilson issued an order for nationalization on December 26, 1917. This action had been authorized by the Army Appropriations Act of 1916. Federal control extended over the steam and electric railroads with their owned or controlled systems of coastwise and inland water transportation, terminals, terminal companies, terminal associations, sleeping and parlor cars, private cars, private car lines, elevators, warehouses, and telephone and telegraph lines.

== Changes and new equipment ==

Change happened swiftly. The railroads were organized into three divisions: East, West, and South. Uniform passenger ticketing was instituted, and competing services on different former railroads were cut back. Duplicate passenger services were reduced by eliminating more than 250 trains from eastern railroad schedules to allow increased numbers of freight trains to use crowded lines. Costly and employee-heavy sleeping car services were reduced and extra fares applied to discourage their use. Giving priority to coal trains reduced shortages of locomotive fuel. Ordering all empty box cars to be sent to wheat-producing areas improved the flow of food to European allies. USRA pooled all rolling stock, terminals, port facilities, and shops to reduce congestion in Chicago and New York City. All railroad companies serving those metropolitan areas were given trackage rights over all lines entering the area and equal access to terminal facilities. Available railroad rolling stock inventory of 61,000 locomotives, 2,250,000 freight cars, and 58,000 passenger cars were augmented by new production. Over 100,000 railroad cars and 1,930 steam locomotives were ordered at a cost of $380 million, all of new USRA standard designs. The new rolling stock consisted of up-to-date and standardized types, designed to be the best that could be produced to replace outdated equipment.
Before the new USRA standard locomotive types were built and released, locomotives that builders had on hand were issued to various railroads. 2-8-0 &quot;Consolidation&quot; locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for transport and use in France were made available. Then 2-10-0 &quot;Decapod&quot; locomotives built for Imperial Russia by both ALCO and Baldwin, but stranded in the US by the Russian Revolution of 1917, were also made available to the railroads. The USRA leased these locomotives.

== Progression ==
On March 21, 1918, the &quot;Railway Administration Act&quot; became law, and Wilson&#x27;s 1917 nationalization order was affirmed. Wilson appointed his son-in-law, Secretary of the Treasury William Gibbs McAdoo, as Director General of the newly formed USRA.

The law guaranteed the return of the railroads to their former owners within 21 months of a peace treaty, and guaranteed that their properties would be handed back in at least as good a condition as when they were taken over. It also guaranteed compensation for the use of their assets at the average operational income of the railroads in the three years previous to nationalization. The act laid down in concrete terms that the nationalization would be only a temporary measure; before, it was not defined as necessarily so.

With the Armistice in November 1918, McAdoo resigned from his post, leaving Walker Hines as the Director General.

== Winding down ==

There was support among labor unions for continuing the nationalization of the railroads after the war. However, this position was not supported by Wilson nor the public generally. Because the United States was not a party to the Treaty of Versailles ending the war in 1919, which would have been the legal basis for returning the railroads to private ownership under the Railway Administration Act, legislation was drafted to effect the return.

Congress passed the Esch-Cummins Act (Railroad Transportation Act) in February 1920, which substantially increased the ICC&#x27;s powers over the railroads, and the USRA&#x27;s authority ended on March 1, 1920. The ICC was given powers to approve or reject railroad mergers, to set rates, to approve or reject abandonments of service, and additional oversight responsibilities. The government also made financial guarantees to the railroads after control was handed back to them, to ensure their financial survival after the restoration of control.

== Aftermath ==
The Esch-Cummins Act maintained and expanded a complete railroad regulatory system after the war. During the 1920s the railroads, with rates and routes set by the ICC, were facing increasing competition from other modes of transportation: trucking and airplanes. These competing modes were basically unregulated at the time, and received extensive financial assistance from the federal government. This competition contributed to the railroads&#x27; decline in the 1920s and beyond, and which was amplified in the 1930s during the Great Depression.

<text>Elections in Mauritania encompass four different types: presidential elections, parliamentary elections, regional elections and local elections.

This article only lists elections held after the introduction of multi-party politics with the 1991 Constitution, introduced after a referendum. During the authoritarian regime of Ould Daddah elections that were not up to democratic standards were held under a one-party state, while elections weren&#x27;t held during a period of military junta rule after Mauritania&#x27;s participation in the Western Sahara War.

Mauritania has a presidential election every five years, in which a president of Mauritania is elected in two rounds on the basis of a direct popular vote.

Parliamentary elections for the National Assembly are held every five years with a parallel voting system combining several national lists and an electoral district vote, with a two-round system used for one-seat districts, a general ticket used for two-seat districts, with larger districts using the proportional largest remainder method. Mauritania has a multi-party system with a dominant ruling party holding an absolute majority supported by several minor parties (with this bloc being referred to as the &quot;presidential majority&quot;). Mauritania has a high number of parties, with a peak of 105 parties running in 2018. 

Regional and local elections are also held every five years (usually at the same time as parliamentary elections) to elect Mauritania&#x27;s regional and local councils using a proportional largest remainder method.

<text>Malawi elects on the national level a head of state and government (Malawi Constitution, 1994 p 27) – the President – and a national assembly. The President and members of the National Assembly, elected simultaneously at a General Election, together form the Malawian Parliament owing to the President&#x27;s role as both head of government and head of state. In practice however, the National Assembly is on par with the executive and is able to exercise oversight functions through investigations and public hearings on various matters including those involving the executive. 

The President of Malawi and the Vice-President of Malawi are elected jointly to a five-year term through universal suffrage. In order to be duly elected, a presidential candidate and their running mate must have more than 50 percent of the total valid votes cast at the election. If no candidate achieves that threshold, a runoff election is organized within 60 days in which the two most popular candidates contest. The provision for a runoff election was first introduced by the Malawian High Court and subsequently backed by the Malawian Supreme Court of Appeal in 2020 following an electoral petition contesting the results of the 2019 elections which resulted in the invalidation of the presidential election. 

Parliament, following the recommendations of both courts, then amended and passed the presidential, parliamentary and local government elections act in 2022 which was then assented to by the current President, Lazarus Chakwera, in February of 2023. In addition to provisions for runoff elections, the act also stipulates the precise procedures by which the electoral process from candidate nominations, the campaigning process, to the vote counting and announcement of results. It also stipulates legal remedies for dealing with complaints and potential violations of the electoral process, including outlining the precise powers of the High Court in addressing electoral irregularities. The amended act is currently in force. 

The National Assembly currently has 193 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat constituencies. The Malawian Electoral Commission however completed its belated constitutionally mandated review of constituencies and has recommended to parliament an increase to the membership of the National Assembly in line with population trends, settlement patterns, voter accessibility concerns, and other stipulated requirements outlined in the constitution. The review is likely to be adopted and upheld by parliament. 

Malawi is a multi-party system, which means that there are multiple parties as well as a number of independent politicians who do not formally associate with any party.

Malawian citizens who are 18 or over are entitled to vote. Foreign nationals who have lived in Malawi for 7 years can also vote.

<doc id="924110" wikidata="Q1508144" url="?curid=924110" title="George Ramsay (footballer, born 1855)">
<text>George Burrell Ramsay (4 March 1855 – 7 October 1935) was a Scottish footballer and manager.

Ramsay was the secretary and manager of Aston Villa Football Club during the club&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;. As a player he was the first Aston Villa captain to lift a trophy, being instrumental in establishing the club as force in the game. A pioneer of the passing game, which he learned in his native Scotland, Aston Villa became renowned for their short, slick combination passing under his leadership.

His trophy haul of six League Championships and six FA Cups established Aston Villa as the most successful club in England. He has been described as the world&#x27;s first paid football manager. To this day, Ramsay remains one of the most successful managers in the history of English football.

==Early life==
Ramsay was born at Abbotsford Place in the Gorbals district of Glasgow, the second son of William Ramsay, a master ironmonger, who originated from Perthshire and Mary Ann Burrell who was born in Woolwich. After initially working with his father, the Glaswegian arrived in Birmingham 1876 to work as a clerk in a brass foundry.

==Playing career==

Prior to joining Aston Villa, Ramsay had played for Glasgow&#x27;s Oxford F.C. and Rovers F.C. In 1877 he appeared as a guest player for Welsh club Druids, when they played a fixture against Queens Park.

Ramsay came to join Aston Villa by chance shortly after arriving in Birmingham. One day in 1876, whilst taking a stroll in Aston Park, the 21-year-old Ramsay came across a Villa players&#x27; practice match and was asked to make up the numbers. They were amazed by his skills, they had never seen a display of close ball control before. When the game was over, the Villa players surrounded him and invited him to join the club, and very soon he became their captain. Ramsay later described the newly formed club&#x27;s approach to the game as &#x27;a dash at the man and a big kick at the ball&#x27;. Word spread about how fine a player Ramsay was, spectators began turning up to watch the little man nicknamed &#x27;Scotty&#x27;. He also took charge of training which saw dramatic improvement that showed in the results, introducing what was known as the &quot;passing game&quot;. This had become the main style of play in Scotland whereas in England most teams relied on what was known as the &quot;dribbling game&quot;.

In addition to the introduction of a radical change in playing style, Ramsay, along with John Linsay, discovered the Wellington Road ground at Perry Barr in 1876, which meant the club was able to charge admission for the first time. He was also responsible for the recruitment of Villa legend Archie Hunter, who later recounted the story in his 1890 memoir &quot;Triumphs of the Football Field&quot;.

Villa gradually improved under his guidance,&quot;the influence of Ramsay, then Hunter, led Villa to develop an intricate passing game, a revolutionary move for an English club in the late 1870s. It was a style of play modelled on that which was prevalent in Scotland at the time and which had been pioneered by Queen&#x27;s Park, the Glasgow side. This type of sophisticated teamwork had rarely been employed in England.&quot; Villa were becoming a force to be reckoned with in the Midlands, which culminated in the club winning their first trophy, The Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, with Ramsay as captain. The club would go on to lift the trophy 9 times in the next 12 seasons. William McGregor later recalled: 

Ramsay retired from playing at the age of just 27 due to an injury sustained during an early experimental floodlit match against Nottingham Forest at Villa&#x27;s Perry Bar ground in 1882. He handed the captaincy to fellow Scotsman, Archie Hunter, but remained involved with the club serving on the committee.

==Management career==
Following the professionalisation of football in 1885, the club decided that it needed a full-time paid manager. The following advert was placed in the Birmingham Daily Gazette newspaper in June 1886:

 Villa received 150 applicants for the role, but with his strong association with the club George Ramsay was the overwhelming choice of the membership. Thus on 26 June 1886, Villa appointed what has been described as the world&#x27;s first football manager. The position predates the modern role of a football manager, the advert used the title &#x27;manager&#x27; but the club settled on the title of &#x27;secretary&#x27;. Ramsay was responsible for the team, including controlling recruitment and transfers, supported by a specialist fitness trainer, who from 1893 until 1915 was Joe Grierson. The team was selected by the committee each week, which consisted of such figures as William McGregor, Fred Rinder and, following their retirement, former club captains John Devey and Howard Spencer.

He held his position at the club for a remarkable 42 years, in which time Villa won the Football League and FA Cup 6 times each, establishing themselves as the premier football club in England. Villa&#x27;s style of play under Ramsay consisted of high speed dribbling, short passes and powerful shooting. In a rare interview in 1920, Ramsay said of Villa&#x27;s playing style:
The Villa News remarked in October 1935 that: &quot;He was not content that Aston Villa should be noted just in the playing sense; his demand was that it should become an institution with a world-wide reputation for probity in sportsmanship&quot;.

Aston Villa&#x27;s success under Ramsay was built upon a scouting network that signed up the best young players from Birmingham and the Black Country towns and moulding them to play &#x27;the Villa way&#x27;. Players such as John Devey, Charlie Athersmith, Howard Spencer, Billy Garraty, Steve Smith, Joe Bache, Billy Walker and Frank Moss were all local lads who played starring roles for Villa during the club&#x27;s golden era. The team was reinforced by a strong contingent of talented Scottish players such as Archie Hunter, James Cowan and John Campbell.

Howard Spencer, Villa&#x27;s captain from 1902 - 1907 once said:
Spencer was one of a succession of Aston Villa captains that, starting with Ramsay himself, maintained the club&#x27;s distinctive and highly successful playing style for over 40 years. Archie Hunter, John Devey, Howard Spencer, Joe Bache, Frank Moss and Billy Walker, all captained the club under Ramsay and were important influences both on and off the pitch.

Ramsay later said of his role in the establishment of Aston Villa as the most successful football club in England:

In 1926, with his health failing due to arthritis, Ramsay retired as secretary at the age of 71. He was made honorary advisor and a vice-president of the Club. His replacement W. J. Smith was unable to continue Ramsay&#x27;s success, although the club did finish runners-up in the league twice under his guidance. In 1934 Smith stood down and the club decided to appoint its first manager, Jimmy McMullan. The following year Ramsay died at the age of 80. Within a year of his death the Midlands giants were relegated, an unthinkable notion in the Ramsay era.

In all, Ramsay&#x27;s association with the football club lasted 59 years, a time which will always be known as Aston Villa&#x27;s &#x27;Golden Age&#x27;. Ramsay was laid to rest at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Handsworth, his gravestone reads &quot;Founder of Aston Villa&quot;.

==Personal life==
He married Fanny Elizabeth Warwick, an Aston girl, in 1893. They had two sons and one daughter. Ramsay divorced his wife on the grounds of her adultery in 1915.

In later life, Ramsay was a keen player of crown green bowls and won several competitions. He often played at the Welsh spa town of Llandrindod Wells, where he spent much of his retirement.

<text>Broadmoor is an 85 acre (340,000 m²) gated residential community with a 115 acre (465,000 m²) golf course in Seattle, Washington, United States. It is bounded on the west by the Washington Park Arboretum; on the south by East Madison Street, beyond which is the Washington Park neighborhood; on the east by 37th Avenue East, beyond which is the Madison Park neighborhood; and on the north by Union Bay marshland. It was founded on September 10, 1924.

Broadmoor was developed on land that had been logged by the Puget Mill Company for sixty years. In 1920, the parcel was split in two. The western 230 acres (930,000 m²) were given to the city, who developed Washington Park on the site; the eastern 200 acres (800,000 m²) were developed as Broadmoor by a group of businessmen that included E. G. Ames, general manager of Puget Mill. Like other developments by Puget Mill, Broadmoor was built as a racially segregated neighborhood, using exclusionary covenants to block prospective home buyers of certain races and ethnicities. For example, a 1928 covenant blocked &quot;any Hebrew or by any person of the Ethiopian, Malay or any Asiatic Race&quot;.

<doc id="924115" wikidata="Q7474735" url="?curid=924115" title="Mankurt (film)">
<text>Mankurt (; ) is a 1990 Soviet film written by Mariya Urmadova and directed by Hojaguly Narliyev. The main cast were the Turkish actors and and the Turkmen actors Maya-Gozel Aymedova and Hojadurdy Narliyev.

==Background==
The film was partially filmed on location in Syria and in Turkey, representing a Turkish-Soviet cooperation in filmmaking. The film is based on the fictional legend about a mankurt within the novel &quot;The Day Lasts More Than a Hundred Years&quot; (&quot;И дольше века длится день&quot;) by Chinghiz Aitmatov, a philosophical tale about what can happen to people if they forget their motherland, language, and history. The Turkic legend invented by Aitmatov for the novel conceives of a cruel way of making &quot;mankurts&quot; of captives in the hopes that they will forget everything but basic activities, rendering them servile minions to &quot;Zunghar&quot; conquerors.

==Synopsis==
The film is about a Turkmen who defended his homeland from invasion. He is captured, tortured, and brainwashed into serving his homeland&#x27;s conquerors. He is so completely turned that he does not recognize his mother and kills her when she attempts to return his memories.

<doc id="924120" wikidata="Q7333752" url="?curid=924120" title="Right Socialist Party of Japan">
<text>The was a political party in Japan that existed between 1951 and 1955.

== History ==
Following the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, the Japan Socialist Party dissolved into chaos and internal bickering between moderate reformist socialists and more radical revolutionary socialists over the issue of whether or not to support the Treaty. As a result of the JSP split, some of its members formed a more centrist social democratic party, while others formed a more radical socialist party. Both groups claimed the name &quot;Nihon Shakaitō&quot; () but different English translations, and are known as the Left Socialist Party of Japan and the Right Socialist Party of Japan, respectively. On domestic policy, the Right Socialist Party was a centre-left social democratic party.

The left wing was in chaos between 1951 and 1955. In early 1955, the Left Socialists and the Right Socialists reconciled and merged to reform the JSP, months before the Liberal Democrat Party was created through the merger of the Liberal and Democrat parties. Even though the Right Socialist Party dissolved in 1955 when the JSP reunified, some members of the former Right Socialist Party broke off from the JSP in 1960 and created the Democratic Socialist Party. The Young Socialists, a newly formed youth organisation which retains full membership in the International Union of Socialist Youth, is said to be inherited from the political tradition of the Right Socialist Party.

<text>Blink is a 1993 American neo-noir thriller film directed by Michael Apted and written by Dana Stevens. Starring Madeleine Stowe and Aidan Quinn, the film follows Emma Brody, the recipient of a corneal transplant who works with a police detective to track down a serial killer whose latest murder she inadvertently bore witness to.

Principal photography began on March 14, 1993 and took place in various Chicago locations. Chicago rock band The Drovers play a supporting role as themselves and contributed three songs to the soundtrack.

==Plot==
Emma Brody, a violinist for a Celtic rock band in Chicago, has been blind for twenty years as the result of an attack by her abusive mother. She volunteers for an experimental surgery where her doctor, Ryan Pierce, equips her with corneal transplants. Though Emma&#x27;s vision is partially restored, a side effect is &quot;retroactive hallucination&quot;, meaning some things she sees don’t actually register in her brain until days after first witnessing them.

After hearing a noise from the apartment above and seeing a shadowy figure descend the building stairs, Emma goes to the police to file a report. However, her reliability is questioned because of her impaired vision. When Emma’s upstairs neighbor Valerie is later found murdered, Detective John Hallstrom, who earlier expressed skepticism about Emma, comes to rely on her for clues.

After an appointment with Dr. Pierce, Emma is walking in the parking garage of a hospital when her guide dog Ralphie begins barking and acting jittery. Emma also sees a crucifix pendant left on the garage floor. Ralphie gives chase to an assailant, but is accidentally hit by a car and must be taken to a veterinarian. Hallstrom starts to put more credence in Emma because the crucifix pendant she claims to have seen was found on the earlier victim’s body. He gets a policeman to stand watch at her door and follows her around town, taking a romantic interest in her. When Emma goes on a date with Dr. Pierce, Hallstrom enviously watches from afar.

After Dr. Pierce drops Emma off at her place, Hallstrom follows her back home where they express their mutual attraction to each other, embarking on a romance. Hallstrom’s fellow officers believe his relationship with Emma compromises his detective work. Meanwhile, the serial killer strikes again in Milwaukee. Hallstrom is rebuked by his superior for not having found the killer; to focus on his work, he distances himself from Emma and asks his colleague Ridgeley to look after her.

Emma goes to Hallstrom&#x27;s office looking for him, prompting an argument between the couple about their relationship and ending with Emma storming off. She gets on the L train and sees visions of a man coming after her, but these turn out to be distorted visions as Ridgeley is the one chasing her, not the killer. Ridgeley finds Emma just as she faints on the train. Later, when seeing Dr. Pierce for an appointment, Emma becomes wary when she sees the doctor using surgical soap, as she remembers this was the scent when she encountered the killer.

Hallstrom finds medical bills addressed to Emma that erroneously lists the upstairs apartment as hers. He pieces together that the murderer meant to kill Emma, but ended up mistakenly killing her neighbor Valerie. He deduces that the killer is going after people who received the organs of Leslie Davison, a woman the killer loved. Dr. Pierce shows up outside Emma’s apartment claiming the family of her organ donor wants to get in touch with her. After some hesitation, Emma gets the address from Pierce and heads to the location with Crowe, her police officer escort.

Emma knocks on the door of the house but nobody is home. She goes to tell Crowe who has parked in an empty garage, but she is ambushed by the killer, who has killed the cop in his car and locked the garage. The murderer, a former hospital orderly, refers to Emma as Leslie and taunts her. Emma fights back, gets ahold of his gun and shoots, but her impaired vision makes it difficult. When Hallstrom is informed that Emma went to Leslie’s supposed address, he goes to the location with backup. After a prolonged chase around the garage, Emma manages to shoot the killer dead. The cops hear the gunshots and bring Emma to safety.

After some questioning at the police station, Ridgeley offers to give Emma a ride home, but Hallstrom is waiting outside with a recovering Ralphie. Emma decides to walk home with Hallstrom and they share a kiss.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
&quot;Blink&quot; holds a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 critics&#x27; reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10.

Praise went to Stowe&#x27;s performance, with critics commending how it departs from &quot;the old &#x27;beautiful blind woman in peril&#x27; school of romantic thrillers&quot;. In a positive review, film critic Roger Ebert said Emma is &quot;not your average movie blind woman, all trembling and sensitive. She&#x27;s independent, tough, smart, cynical, and she likes to take a drink from time to time&quot;. He added, &quot;Quinn and Stowe are able to bring to their characters a certain no-B.S. edge that I recognize as very Chicago&quot;, and ultimately called the film &quot;an uncommonly good thriller&quot; in a review that gave 3 and ½ stars out of four.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s Janet Maslin praised the film&#x27;s cast and visual effects, but criticized the screenplay, writing &quot;&#x27;Blink&#x27; resembles last year&#x27;s &#x27;Malice&#x27; as a mystery with a compelling setup, good actors, a lot of well-evoked atmosphere and a solution so nutty it takes the breath away. The denouement of &#x27;Blink&#x27; is such a doozy that it winds up deflating the whole film, which otherwise might have sustained its sharp characterizations and gritty atmosphere.&quot; Peter Rainer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described the plot as &quot;so convoluted that even Hitchcock might have gotten tangled up in it&quot;. David Ansen of &quot;Newsweek&quot; wrote &quot;Blink&quot; &quot;walks a fine line, but if you&#x27;re willing to accept it on its frankly formulaic terms, it delivers some good jolts&quot;.

&quot;The Miami Herald&quot; gave the film 2.5 stars (out of 4), saying, &quot;After a number of red herrings, the identity of the killer turns out to be rather inconsequential -- and the motive somewhat farfetched. A shame, because the premise here, paired with an equally clever plot, would&#x27;ve made a dandy exercise in suspense. As it is, &quot;Blink&quot; is mildly engaging entertainment, nothing that will have you checking your watch, but nowhere near as good as its terrific trailers (&quot;Things are not what they seem&quot; and all that) make it out to be.&quot;

===Box office===
The film debuted at number 4 at the US box office. It grossed $16,696,219 in the US and Canada and $21.7 million worldwide.

<doc id="924125" wikidata="Q19192" url="?curid=924125" title="California State Route 56">
<text>State Route 56 (SR 56) is an east–west state highway in the U.S. state of California. It runs from Interstate 5 (I-5) in the Carmel Valley neighborhood of San Diego to I-15. The eastern terminus of the highway is also the western end of the Ted Williams Parkway. SR 56 serves as an important connector between I-5 and I-15, being the only east–west freeway between SR 78 in north San Diego County, several miles away, and SR 52 near Marine Corps Air Station Miramar. It is also named the Ted Williams Freeway, after the San Diego-born baseball player.

SR 56 was added to the state highway system in 1959 as Legislative Route 278, and was renumbered SR 56 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. Plans in 1964 were to connect SR 56 to the north end of SR 125 and continue east to SR 67, but these plans did not come to fruition. The eastern end from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was completed in 1993; the western end from I-5 to Carmel Creek Road was completed in 1995 after several lawsuits filed by the Sierra Club and other community groups. The two ends were not connected until the middle portion of the freeway was completed in 2004. The delay was largely due to funding issues and environmental concerns.

==Route description==

Eastbound SR 56 begins as a ramp from the northbound I-5&#x27;s local bypass lanes. The interchange is not complete; southbound I-5 traffic must exit to Carmel Valley Road before entering SR 56. Westbound traffic on SR 56 merges into the southbound I-5 local bypass lanes, which provide access to I-805. Continuing east, the route then has an interchange at Carmel Creek Road, which provides access to the nearby San Diego Jewish Academy, and proceeds eastward through a residential area. After passing milepost 2, the freeway has another interchange with Carmel Country Road south of the community of Torrey Hills.

SR 56 meets Carmel Valley Road and curves northward, passing Canyon Crest Academy before turning southeastward. The route passes over McGonigle Creek before intersecting Camino Del Sur, which serves the nearby Westview High School. Southeast of Camino Del Sur, SR 56 curves back east, passing under Carmel Mountain Road without an exit. The route encounters exits with Black Mountain Road and Rancho Peñasquitos Boulevard in Rancho Peñasquitos in a primarily residential area before meeting its terminus at a partial cloverleaf interchange with I-15. Past the bridge over I-15, the road continues as Ted Williams Parkway, ending at Twin Peaks Road in Poway.

SR 56 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System; and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. In 2014, SR 56 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 32,000 vehicles between I-15 and the eastern terminus at Ted Williams Parkway, and 81,000 vehicles between Carmel Creek Road and Carmel Country Road, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the freeway.

==History==

===Planning and initial construction===
Planning for SR 56 started in 1956, according to San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden. The route was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRN 278). The routing ran from LRN 2, which later became US 101, all the way east to LRN 198, which is now SR 67. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, LRN 278 was renumbered SR 56 and was designated to run from I-5 to SR 67. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in their city plan extending all the way east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 all the way to SR 67, although Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in their city. Nevertheless, there are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I-15; several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4).
Citizens began to lobby for the construction of SR 56 in 1986, in a similar action to efforts for SR 52. As far back as 1987, the Sierra Club opposed the use of sales tax revenue to build the freeway because of environmental concerns. A public forum was held on April 10, 1990, in Rancho Peñasquitos. Since funds were not available for constructing the middle of the route, many opposed the construction of the eastern part of SR 56 as a &quot;road to nowhere&quot;. Opposition to the western end of the freeway related to concerns about destruction of &quot;farmland, marshland, and willow scrubland&quot;, the habitat of the endangered least Bell&#x27;s vireo. The San Diego City Council voted against such widening of Carmel Valley Road on April 12, citing the environmental concerns. Caltrans rejected other routes, and insisted on ending the freeway at I-5 and Carmel Valley Road. The council reversed its decision on May 8; after the public gave several opinions on the matter, Caltrans agreed to set aside for environmental mitigation, and $2 million (about $ in dollars) was to be set aside for the purchase of land for a park near the San Dieguito River.

In June 1990, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy and the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the San Diego City Council to require them to move the western terminus of SR 56 closer to Sorrento Valley. On August 1, the City of San Diego received a petition in which more than 45,000 people requested that the City Council overturn their decision or refer it to a public referendum. The City Council backed down and rescinded the appropriate zoning changes on August 7, in efforts to keep the city from having to run a special election. They also approved the plans for the eastern portion between Black Mountain Road and I-15. Meanwhile, the Carmel Valley Coalition sued the city as well. The California Coastal Commission approved the construction on September 13, and several local residents representing both sides of the debate attended the meeting in Marina del Rey.

Construction on the predecessor of SR 56 began on November 16, 1987, the Newland-California Company paying for the work as a local developer. Around 1990, the North City Parkway was completed as a two-lane road between Rancho Peñasquitos Boulevard (then Peñasquitos Boulevard) and I-15, along the proposed route of SR 56. The first official segment of the freeway from Black Mountain Road to I-15 was constructed next, beginning on July 25, 1991 by Daley Corporation and W.R. Connelly Inc. This was scheduled to open in May 1993, at a cost of $13 million (about $ in dollars).

Opposition to the western segment (from I-5 to Carmel Valley Road) persisted. By 1991, the Del Mar Terrace Conservancy filed an appeal with the 4th District Court of Appeals after losing the lawsuit to the city of San Diego and Caltrans. The Sierra Club had also sued the California Coastal Commission. On July 16, 1992, the Sierra Club withdrew its lawsuit after the City of San Diego agreed to work to keep the Peñasquitos Lagoon flowing to the ocean and to restore a wetland area. Following the Sierra Club&#x27;s settlement, the City of Del Mar raised an objection to the club&#x27;s decision to accept a settlement, since the city had given a $7,000 contribution (about $ in dollars) to the case. The Sierra Club agreed to return the money in August 1992.

The Del Mar Conservancy suit continued, and the plaintiffs requested a court order to stop construction. This lawsuit claimed that the state and city had not done enough environmental studies and mitigation. The 4th District Court of Appeals denied an appeal on October 23. In 1993, citizens complained that funds were being diverted from a recreational park to build the freeway, possibly hindering the development of a new elementary school. The segment was finally completed at a projected cost of $27.2 million (about $ in dollars), opening to traffic by 1995. The ramps connecting SR 56 to I-5 were opened between 1997 and 1998; traffic was diverted onto Carmel Valley Road in the meantime.
The freeway is named after Ted Williams, a Hall of Fame baseball player born in San Diego who played for the Boston Red Sox during his 21-year career. The San Diego City Council also considered naming SR 56 after the former governor and San Diego mayor Pete Wilson. The Council voted 7-1 to name it after Williams on May 12, 1992. Since Williams was still alive, the State of California had to approve the name. Lionel Van Deerlin alleged that Councilwoman Abbe Wolfsheimer nominated Wilson for the honor as political ammunition against Councilman Ron Roberts. Williams came to Mt. Carmel High School on July 12, 1992, for the freeway dedication. Kevin McNamara, who had worked with the government to get the name approved despite opposition, was charged $15,000 (about $ in dollars) for the highway signs when the name was official. The freeway was officially named after Ted Williams in 1993 by the Legislature.

===Filling the gap===
A gap in the freeway remained, nevertheless. Concerns about the missing funds for the freeway date back to 1990. Since the proposed route passed through the open area between Carmel Valley and Rancho Peñasquitos, revenue from the Proposition A sales tax hike could not be used. In 1993, a &quot;Citizens United for State Route 56&quot; group was commissioned to work on the funding issues. Two years later, County Supervisor Pam Slater briefly proposed making SR 56 a toll road in order to raise funds for construction. The city of San Diego agreed to pay $25 million (about $ in dollars), and the state indicated that it would contribute $20 million.

Highway 680 was a planned county route that would have run from Encinitas to Rancho Bernardo. The San Diego County Board of Supervisors cancelled the plans in February 1994, respecting the wishes of the city of Encinitas. There were concerns that some of the traffic from this proposed route would now travel on SR 56 instead. On May 17, 1994, $20 million (about $ in dollars) allocated to Highway 680 was given to the SR 56 project.

In January 1998, the State Transportation Improvement Program approved a $245 million allocation (about $ in dollars) for the expansion, and hopes were to finish construction by 2000, with traffic projected to decrease by 20 percent on I-15. There were environmental concerns that fostered consideration of four northern alternatives. One of them was chosen in June 1998 by the San Diego City Council, amid concerns that by moving the route away from &quot;environmentally sensitive canyons&quot;, the freeway would be closer to residences. Some of those living in Rancho Glens Estates sued the city over these concerns in August.
Construction began on the missing portion of SR 56 on October 21, 1999, amid allegations of a missing Army Corps of Engineers permit, at an estimated cost of $111 million (about $ in dollars). The California Coastal Commission approved the extension on May 10, 2000, after residents lost two lawsuits relating to the proximity of the freeway. Caltrans was required to install a drainage system because of the wetlands; this requirement was similar to a court ruling for a project in the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. At this time, the completion was estimated to occur in 2004, at a cost of $151 million (about $ in dollars). In October 2000, Carmel Valley Road was extended to Black Mountain Road, providing a paved alternative until SR 56 was completed; commuters had to travel on a unpaved road, one of the only roads between I-5 and I-15 in North County.

Local developers contributed $21 million (about $ in dollars) for the construction of the interchange at Camino Ruiz, and construction began on July 11, 2001. An open house was held on the portion of the freeway between the Camino Ruiz (renamed Camino del Sur) interchange and the Black Mountain Road interchange on April 5, 2003. The road was scheduled to open on April 12, 2003, and was projected to decrease the traffic on city streets coming from the extended Carmel Valley Road.

The city of San Diego constructed SR 56 from Black Mountain Road to Carmel Mountain Road, and Caltrans built the remaining portion of the route to Carmel Creek Road. The bridges were still under construction in November 2000 on the city portion. San Diego mayor Dick Murphy commissioned the San Diego Freeway Congestion Strike Team to attempt to accelerate stalled freeway projects such as SR 56 in 2001. In May 2001, the City Council allocated another $5.1 million (about $ in dollars) to purchase land to build the freeway. Critics stated that the construction of SR 56 was a short-term solution, and that traffic would return by 2020.

FCI Constructors Inc. and W.R. Connelly Inc. won the contract for the Caltrans portion of the new freeway at a bid of $50.2 million (about $ in dollars), with completion scheduled for 2004. The freeway was built with two lanes in each direction, additional land being available to expand to three lanes if necessary. The project continued on schedule through the 2003 California budget crisis, receiving $4.3 million from the state in 2003. In 2004, there were citizen complaints about the lack of a sound wall to reduce the freeway noise in private residences. It took until July 19, 2004, to join the west and east ends of the freeway; a public festival was held on the freeway on July 17. The cost of completing the middle segment was reported at $220 million in 2004 (about $ in dollars). Citizens complained in 2008 that the bike path along SR 56 was difficult to access from the northern side of the interchange with El Camino Real; however, funding issues prevented the construction of a paved path at the time.

===Ramps and bypasses===

The construction of a &quot;dual freeway&quot; at the western end was scheduled to begin in early 2002, referring to the two carriageways needed for each direction of the freeway. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006. The southbound I-15 to westbound SR 56 ramp was improved in a construction project in 2005.

Concerns about the lack of a ramp from westbound SR 56 to northbound I-5 date back from 1988, because of a projected increase of traffic on local Carmel Valley streets. Planning for the missing ramps at the western end of SR 56 was underway in 2008, despite nearby homeowner opposition. Caltrans agreed not to destroy homes in late June 2008, but concerns about noise and funding remained. On June 13, 2012, Caltrans held a public forum to discuss five proposals to address the missing ramps at the western terminus:
*build the westbound to northbound ramp and the southbound to eastbound ramp,
*add additional lanes to both SR 56 and I-5,
*only build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes to southbound I-5 and eastbound SR 56,
*build the westbound-to-northbound ramp and add lanes on SR 56 only, or
*build nothing at all.

A final environmental document was scheduled to be released in the middle of 2016. In the meantime, Caltrans began studies relating to widening the route to three lanes in each direction, as called for by the 2050 regional plan; by late 2022, plans had been developed to add high-occupancy vehicle lanes between El Camino Real and Carmel Country Road starting in April. On April 24, 2023, the San Diego City Council voted unanimously to allocate $22.5 million and approve the construction of HOV lanes.

<text>The Broadmoor Golf Club is a pair of golf courses, located on the grounds of The Broadmoor, a historic hotel and resort Colorado Springs, Colorado. Originally opened in 1918 and designed by Donald Ross, the course format was expanded in 1965 with 18 additional holes designed by Robert Trent Jones.

The club has hosted several USGA championships since 1959, including the 1995 and 2011 U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, the 2008 and 2018 U.S. Senior Open, and the 1959 and 1967 U.S. Amateur.

The current layout consists of the East Course and the West Course, and the club previously had a third 18-hole course, the Mountain Course, which was closed after a 2016 rockslide.

==History==
The original course opened in 1918 and has hosted several USGA championships since 1959, most recently the U.S. Senior Open in 2018, won by David Toms.

The East Course previously hosted the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open in 1995, the first of the ten majors won by Annika Sörenstam.

The current course format (East and West) opened in 1965, featuring new routing and 18 additional holes designed by Robert Trent Jones. The West Course includes the front 9 holes from the original Ross course (now holes 1–4, 13–18 on West). The East Course includes the original back 9 Donald Ross holes (now holes 1–6,16-18 on East). The Mountain Course opened in 1976 and was designed by Arnold Palmer and Ed Seay. It was renovated by Jack Nicklaus&#x27; company in 2006 and closed in 2016 due to a landslide. Nicklaus won his first major tournament, the 1959 U.S. Amateur, at the East Course at the age of 19.

The resort&#x27;s landmark hotel sits at an elevation of above sea level, with the golf courses climbing slightly

<doc id="924131" wikidata="Q623709" url="?curid=924131" title="California State Route 125">
<text>State Route 125 (SR 125) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that serves as a north–south route in San Diego County. It runs from SR 11 and SR 905 in Otay Mesa, near the Mexican border, to SR 52 in Santee. SR 125 also connects SR 54, SR 94, and I-8.

The first parts of SR 125 were added to the state highway system in 1933, connecting Route 94 with US 80. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, what was signed as Route 67 was transferred to the new SR 125. After several delays in funding and in planning, the highway was extended north to SR 52 and south to SR 54 in the early 2000s.

The southern portion of SR 125 from SR 11 and SR 905 to SR 54 near Chula Vista is a toll road called the South Bay Expressway. This portion was completed in 2007 after many years of planning and litigation related to concerns over the destruction of endangered species habitat. The toll road was operated by a public-private partnership known as South Bay Expressway LLC. However, the partnership declared bankruptcy in 2010 and sold the road to the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) in 2011. Since then, following a decrease in the toll amount, traffic using the highway has increased.

The definition of the SR 125 route continues to SR 56, but this portion has not been constructed, and there are no plans to do so.

==Route description==
SR 125 begins as the South Bay Expressway toll road at an interchange with SR 11 and SR 905. The route heads north through an undeveloped area, encountering its first toll plaza just before entering the city of Chula Vista. The freeway cuts through the Eastlake neighborhood of Chula Vista before leaving the city and turning to the northeast, passing through Sweetwater Summit Regional Park near Sweetwater Reservoir. SR 125 intersects with SR 54, where the tolled portion ends. SR 54 runs concurrently with SR 125 north to the Jamacha Road exit. SR 125 continues north again through the unincorporated area of La Presa. The freeway briefly enters Lemon Grove before intersecting with SR 94 and crossing into the city of La Mesa.

Passing to the west of Mount Helix, SR 125 interchanges with I-8 before continuing north through the city of El Cajon near Grossmont College. The freeway continues into suburban Santee, where the route terminates just north of the SR 52 interchange. Traffic can continue onto SR 52 or Mission Gorge Road at the terminus.
SR 125 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is only a scenic highway from SR 94 to I-8 as designated by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans), meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a &quot;memorable landscape&quot; with no &quot;visual intrusions&quot;, where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. In 2018, SR 125 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 10,200 vehicles between the Otay River Bridge and Olympic Parkway, and 183,000 vehicles between SR 94 and Lemon Avenue, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

==History==
===Route 67===
Added to the state highway system in 1933, and defined in 1935, Route 198 extended from US 80 onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR 94 by 1938. In 1947, the San Diego County Highway Development Association requested that the highway from Sixth Avenue in Mission Valley to US 80 be constructed as a freeway. Although state senator Fred Kraft criticized the proposal in July 1953 because he believed that it would be too expensive and would not reduce congestion in the long-term, especially around the junction with US 80 in Grossmont, approval for the Route 94 freeway extended to the junction with US 80 by October, with the Grossmont part of the route signed as Route 67. The Route 67 freeway was completed in March 1957, from Campo Road and Route 94 to US 80; the project was completed for $1,625,000 (about $ in dollars).

===Planning and Poway extension===
Planning for what would become SR 125 north of I-8 began in 1954. Route 282 was defined as a route from Brown Field through La Mesa extending to Route 277 in 1959, and in 1961 the latter terminus was changed to Route 278. The California Highway Commission selected a route for the highway in mid-1963. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 125 was designated as the highway from SR 75 near Brown Field to SR 56. Route 198 was renumbered as SR 67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.

In early 1964, the La Mesa City Council expressed their preference for Route 282, which had been nicknamed the Ramona Freeway, to run on the routing of Fletcher Parkway, contrary to local businesses that wanted the highway to be routed west of the parkway. A few months later, state engineer Jacob Dekema indicated that there were four routes under consideration for the portion from Brown Field to Sweetwater Lake. The project would not be completed until well after 1972. The state had selected a route for that part of the highway by June, and for the routing west of Fletcher Parkway extending to Mission Gorge Road by July. The following year, the California Highway Commission approved a routing north of Mission Gorge Road into Poway and ending at SR 56.

In the 1970s, planning continued for the construction of the route, as well as modifications to the existing roadway. The City of La Mesa began discussions regarding adding SR 125 from SR 94 to I-8 into the scenic highway system in 1968; the county Planning Commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970. SR 125 was lengthened by the Legislature to extend to the Mexican border in 1972. In 1973, then-governor Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to delete part of SR 125 from state plans, over concerns that not enough transportation studies had been done on the matter. An improved interchange with SR 94 was being planned the next year. Soon after, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) raised concerns about the remainder of SR 125 not being constructed, due to objections from the community relating to freeway construction in general.

Construction began on the SR 94 interchange in October, and continued into late 1975, at a cost of $11 million (about $ in dollars). Parts of the interchange with SR 94 were open by July 20. The City of Chula Vista considered SR 125 as possibly having scenic value when constructed, and considered asking the state to add it to the state highway system; this influenced a rule that construction projects near possible scenic routes in the city had to take natural aesthetics into account. The La Mesa City Council asked the state to modify the interchange with I-8 in July; the original interchange did not allow for access to SR 125 from I-8 east or to I-8 west from SR 125.

In January of the following year, state Assemblyman Wadie Deddeh proposed legislation to remove the southern portion of SR 125 from the state highway plans again. Soon afterward, the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) moved to support retaining SR 125 from Poway to Santee in the county transportation plan, despite opposition from a county supervisor and the mayor of Escondido. Deddeh&#x27;s bill passed the state Assembly Transportation Committee a month later; in the meeting, Deddeh noted the construction of I-805 to handle the traffic demands of the region, as well as a lack of funding that would result in the construction being delayed for at least 20 years. Despite a petition from the mayor of Escondido, the CPO again declined to remove SR 125 from the county transportation plan in March.

The new interchange with SR 94 was completed in July 1976. In August, the California Highway Commission (CHC) announced that SR 75 south of SR 54 had been removed from the state highway plan. The next year, the county supervisor, a San Diego City councilman, and the mayors of La Mesa and National City wrote a letter to then-Governor Jerry Brown to ask that this portion of SR 125 and other freeways be constructed. There were concerns about the types of congestion seen in Los Angeles coming to San Diego due to the incomplete freeway system. San Diego City Councilman Tom Gade wrote a telegram to the Caltrans Director Adriana Gianturco about the possible deletions; in response, Gianturco clarified that the plans were only being reconsidered and had not been removed, and a CHC member criticized the tone of the original telegram, calling it &quot;intemperate.&quot; However, the city of Chula Vista was opposed to the construction at the time, which was a factor in the removal of SR 125 from the highway plans.

In March 1980, the CPO approved the funding for the redesign of the interchange with I-8. By early 1980, SR 125 was denoted with signs saying &quot;To 94&quot; at Grossmont Summit; plans were to provide access north to Fletcher Parkway in the revamp of the interchange. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125.

By 1981, an environmental impact report had been completed on the proposed changes to the I-8 intersection, and the $50 million (about $ in dollars) project to add ramps and widen I-8 was awaiting clearance from the Federal Highway Administration. That year, Poway removed SR 125 from their city plan, leading to a lawsuit from the City of San Diego. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 to SR 67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending there. The next year, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) suggested routing SR 125 through the city of Poway, rather than terminating the route further to the south as Poway had requested. Jacob Dekema was asked to advise the city of Poway in the dispute following his departure from the Caltrans district director position.

The proposal to extend SR 125 north into Poway was discussed as late as 2003 by a local advisory group working with the San Diego Association of Governments. The City of Poway opposed the plan in 2001, saying that SR 67 should be improved instead; it had been removed from city plans in 1980. So far, no proposals to extend SR 125 further north have been included in SANDAG&#x27;s 2050 Regional Transportation Plan.

===Construction from SR 52 to SR 54===
In 1986, the project revamping the I-8 interchange was under way, at a cost of $80 million (about $ in dollars); it would allow for SR 125 to be extended north past I-8 to Fletcher Parkway. That year, SR 125 was truncated to begin at SR 905 by the Legislature, as the latter was formed as a route from I-5 to the border. In 1988, work was under way to add lanes to SR 125 from south of Lemon Avenue to the northern terminus, at a cost of $17.2 million. The next year, some Bonita residents raised objections about the proposed extension south of La Mesa, as they were concerned about additional congestion and urbanization from the freeway going through Bonita.

The California Transportation Commission decided to reallocate the funding for the part of SR 125 from SR 94 to SR 54; they shifted it towards finishing the 40th Street portion of I-15. A year later, the city of Santee expressed concerns about expanding SR 125 and SR 52 to Santee before both those roadways were connected to SR 67, due to the increased traffic that would result. However, Caltrans said this was unavoidable due to a lack of funds to make the connections right away.

La Mesa residents also expressed concerns about the destruction of homes under some of the proposals for the Amaya Drive interchange design, which the city council also endorsed. However, the council approved the construction and design of the Fletcher Parkway interchange in January 1991, over those objections. Further interchange-related concerns were raised from Lemon Grove homeowners the next year. In August 1993, Caltrans agreed to design the new freeway to keep it west of Sweetwater Reservoir, which satisfied Spring Valley while raising concerns from those living in Bonita, who would be closer to this new routing.

The northern portion of SR 125 would be built in stages, at the same time as the portion south of SR 94. The reconstruction of the interchange with I-8 was completed in April 1993. The construction process began in April 1996, at a cost of $177 million in sales tax revenue. The first phase of the construction of the eastern portion of the SR 54 freeway corresponded with the construction of SR 125 north of Jamacha Boulevard to SR 94; construction began in 1996 at the cost of $313.5 million, using money from sales tax revenue. The plans were to exclude the controversial ramps at Troy and Palm streets. After weather-related construction delays due to the El Niño season of the winter of 1997–1998, as well as a contractor declaring bankruptcy, the extension of SR 52 between Mission Gorge Road and SR 125 was dedicated on May 9, 1998, as well as SR 125 from Mission Gorge Road to Grossmont College Drive.

Others raised some complaints during construction on the freeway south of SR 94. A proposed drainage basin raised concerns about a potential breeding ground for mosquitoes being located near homes. Caltrans was later ordered by local courts to pay settlements in the millions of dollars to local business owners for undervaluing property taken by eminent domain.

The portion from Fletcher Parkway to ramps located at Amaya Drive was finished at the beginning of 2001. The segment north to Navajo Road was due to open later that year, and the part from there to Grossmont College Drive was to begin construction in early 2001.

The H. Lee House, a historic site built in 1928, was relocated by Caltrans for $1.5 million to the City Center Park in Lemon Grove. The portion from SR 94 to Jamacha Boulevard was completed in 2003 for $277 million; at this time, the only part of the freeway from SR 54 to SR 52 not complete was between Navajo Road and Grossmont College Drive. During the construction, residents were inconvenienced by dirt, excess noise, and lights operating at nighttime. The entire freeway from SR 52 to I-8 was completed by mid-2004.

====Construction====
Environmental impact studies began on the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans proposed building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.

The California Transportation Commission agreed to ensure that the southern connection from SR 125 to the new toll road would be funded in May 1996. Much of the routing for SR 125 south of SR 54 was determined in March 1997, and the Federal Highway Administration determined the &quot;San Miguel Connector&quot; routing that would connect the new freeway with SR 54 in August. The selection of the route, due to concerns over the destruction of the habitat of the Least Bell&#x27;s Vireo, led to objections from county officials due to the proximity to homes and passing through the Bonita Golf Course and a Little League field. CTV spent $14 million on improving parks, and building Little League fields and trails to offset effects of the construction of the road. However, the construction of both SR 125 and Olympic Parkway were considered by Chula Vista officials to be essential for the further development for the eastern part of that city.
Concerns about the destruction of the Quino checkerspot butterfly were raised by the community group Preserve South Bay. That group sued the developer as well as Caltrans and SANDAG in August 1999, following the latter&#x27;s approval for the project. Early the next year, an environmental impact report suggested that Bonita might face negative effects from the freeway, such as noise and having the roadway divide the community. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) allowed the project that year, even though the Environmental Protection Agency objected to it. A contractor for the project was soon retained by California Transportation Ventures. Another group, Citizens for 125, obtained 7,000 signatures in support of the road.

However, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board withheld its permit approval in December 2000 over concerns that Sweetwater Reservoir could be polluted in the process. Such an approval was necessary under the Clean Water Act in order to get the necessary approval from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The suit by Preserve South Bay was dismissed in March 2001, on the grounds that the legislature did not need to review the annexation of state parkland for the highway because it was done under eminent domain. In April, the San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board approved the project on several conditions, including monitoring the water quality to ensure that Sweetwater Reservoir would remain a clean water source for local residents. An appeal to the state Water Resources Control Board to overturn the approval was unsuccessful. In July, the USACE approved the wetlands permit for the southern portion of SR 125.

The Sierra Club and the San Diego National Audubon Society, as well as some other groups, sued the FHWA, USACE, and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to block the construction of the toll road over alleged breaches of the Endangered Species Act in October 2001; however, a San Diego judge sided with the contractor and the federal government in March 2003. The developer resolved the environmental concerns for $3.07 million and an agreement to work outside breeding times for the endangered species involved in May of that year. In return, the environmental groups agreed not to appeal the court decision. Some community groups also opposed the project.

Construction of the SR 125 toll road started in September 2003; it was projected to open in 2006. Over the next few years, 1.5 million cubic meters of rock were blasted through in 160 separate explosions to allow for the interchange with SR 54 to be built. In 2005, the road was given the South Bay Expressway name. The South Bay Expressway extended SR 125 southward from SR 54 to Otay Mesa. This toll road was one of four privately financed toll highway projects, including the 91 Express Toll Lanes, that were approved in 1990; it was also one of two toll roads financed and controlled by both public and private sources, although the 91 Express Lanes, the other road, soon became entirely publicly owned. A partnership known as the South Bay Expressway operated the road, while an Australian company, Maquarie Group Ltd., handled financial and construction matters.

By 2006, the contractor had encountered delays due to material and worker shortages. The initial toll rates were announced in early 2007, with the lowest toll set at 75 cents. The toll road opened on November 19 of that year. The entire cost of the expressway portion was $843 million, paid for by South Bay Expressway to own the franchise on the tolled portion of SR 125. The interchange with SR 54 was constructed with $160 million of public funding.

====Bankruptcy====
In 2008, 30,000 vehicles a day traveled on the expressway, which fulfilled state expectations; however, complaints were made about the toll machines, due to their low height and needing the exact amount of the toll. In late 2009, the South Bay Expressway partnership that operated the road questioned the value of the toll road for property tax purposes, saying that it was worth $330 million less than it was originally valued due to the low volumes of traffic using the road. On March 22, 2010, the toll road&#x27;s operator filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing traffic counts running at less than 40 percent of initial estimates due to the economic downturn. Some drivers chose not to use the toll road due to a recent increase in tolls. An editorial in the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; also blamed the delay in opening the toll road and the associated penalties, interest, and legal fees for the company&#x27;s financial status. According to the bankruptcy filing, the expressway had $510 million of loans outstanding, of which $170 million was owed to the U.S. Department of Transportation. In addition, there was over $600 million of unresolved litigation with the construction contractors. The gross earnings (EBITDA) for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 were approximately $3 million on revenues of $21 million.

Discussions regarding a potential SANDAG purchase of the road began in October 2010. On July 29, 2011, SANDAG agreed to purchase the lease of the freeway from South Bay Expressway LLC; even though a study suggested that the agency might have to spend millions of dollars on maintaining and repairing parts of the highway. Objections raised to the purchase during the negotiation phase included needing a loan from the federal government of $1.5 million to complete the purchase, and a possible increase in traffic through Lemon Grove. The sale of the franchise rights until the year 2042 was finalized on December 16, 2011, at a price of $341.4 million, and $10.2 million in additional fees, with $254 million from TransNet sales tax revenue, some of it to be repaid with toll revenue. SANDAG claimed at the time that they would reduce the tolls to attract increased use and decrease traffic on I-805, which would mean that additional lanes would not need to be constructed on that route. Despite this, the operator decided to increase tolls instead even with the low demand for using the road; the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; criticized the decision. In mid-2011, it cost $4 to drive the entire toll portion of the road.

Tolls on the tolled section were reduced in 2012 to 25 to 40 percent less than when the road was privately owned. As a result, the number of vehicles using that particular section increased by 19 percent that year compared to the year before. It was estimated that the road would be fully paid off in 2042, and there were reports of decreased traffic on Chula Vista streets and an increase in retail business.

====Proposal to remove tolls====
In early 2022, Chula Vista mayor Mary Salas said that she hoped to end the toll by 2027 instead of 2042, wanting SANDAG to find a way to pay off the loans by then, stating that it is affecting the economically disadvantaged and driving away companies. In April, SANDAG officials reported that the regional body lost up to $1.8 million in revenue when the toll sensors were disabled between June and August 2021.

By July 2022, SANDAG officials announced that they will support eliminating tolls by 2027, but still have to explore ways to pay off the debt.

===SR 11 / SR 905 interchange===
Before being upgraded to a freeway between Britannia Boulevard and Siempre Viva Road, SR 905 directly connected with SR 125 via two at-grade intersections on Otay Mesa Road. When Caltrans opened that segment of the SR 905 freeway in 2010, they omitted the interchange with SR 125, forcing traffic on SR 905 and SR 125 to exit their respective freeways and use Otay Mesa Road (which SR 905 followed at that time) to make the connection. To help fix this problem, a direct freeway-to-freeway interchange was planned, which also included the new SR 11 freeway once it was to be constructed, with construction beginning in late 2015. SR 11 is planned to be a toll facility that will serve a new border crossing east of Otay Mesa. Ramps from SR 905 eastbound to SR 125 northbound, SR 905 westbound to SR 125 northbound, and SR 11 westbound to SR 125 northbound were completed on November 30, 2016, at the cost of over $21 million. Prior to December 16, 2021, traffic on southbound SR 125 was forced to exit onto Otay Mesa Road at that toll road&#x27;s then southern terminus in order to connect to SR 11 and SR 905. Construction on the ramps for these connections began in 2018, with the ramps from SR 125 southbound to SR 11 eastbound and SR 125 southbound to SR 905 eastbound being completed on December 16, 2021, at the cost of $74 million. The ramp from SR 125 southbound to SR 905 westbound, which was still under construction at the time, was initially scheduled to open to traffic in 2023, but was instead opened to traffic on July 26, 2022, finally completing the interchange. There are no plans to construct the remaining connections from SR 905 westbound to SR 11 eastbound and SR 11 westbound to SR 905 eastbound.

==Tolls==
Tolls along the South Bay Expressway depend on whether a driver uses the FasTrak electronic toll collection device or pays by cash or credit card. It is the last remaining FasTrak facility offering cash payment. Those using FasTrak pass under open road tolling gantries at all exits and entrances and are charged a prorated toll based on the distance traveled, similar to a toll ticket system used on several turnpikes in the Eastern United States. Drivers paying with cash or credit cards are instead charged a more expensive flat rate depending on which toll booth they pass through, using a barrier toll system. Unstaffed toll plazas with automated cash and credit card machines are located at northbound and southbound off-ramps. Tolls are also collected at the mainline Otay Mesa Toll Plaza near the southern end of the facility just north of Otay Mesa Road. For example, any cash- or credit-paying driver who passes through the Otay Mesa Toll Plaza ends up paying the maximum rate of $3.50 regardless of the distance they traveled.

Drivers without FasTrak, credit cards, or exact change have within four business after using the toll road to make a one-time &quot;Pay-by-Plate&quot; payment online, plus a $2 processing fee, or they will be assessed an additional toll violation penalty.

The following table lists the toll rates for passenger cars, both with and without FasTrak (). The toll rate is doubled for vehicles with more than two axles.

Following the signing of the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951, the Japan Socialist Party dissolved into chaos and internal bickering between moderate reformist socialists and more radical revolutionary socialists over the issue of whether or not to support the Treaty. The JSP split, with some of its members forming a more centrist social-democratic party, while others formed a more radical socialist party. Both groups claimed the name &quot;Nihon Shakaitō&quot; () but different English translations, and are known as the Left Socialist Party of Japan and the Right Socialist Party of Japan, respectively.

The left-wing in Japan was in chaos between 1951 and 1955. In early 1955, the Left and Right Socialists reconciled and merged to reform the JSP, months before the Liberal Democratic Party was created through a merger of the Liberal and Democrat parties. The Left Socialists generally had the upper hand in the reunified JSP, causing a few former Right Socialists to leave the party in 1960 to create the Democratic Socialist Party.

<text>Canada holds elections for legislatures or governments in several jurisdictions: for the federal (national) government, provincial and territorial governments, and municipal governments. Elections are also held for self-governing First Nations and for many other public and private organizations including corporations and trade unions. Municipal elections can also be held for both upper-tier (regional municipality or county) and lower-tier (town, village, or city) governments.

Formal elections have occurred in Canada since at least 1792, when both Upper Canada and Lower Canada had their first elections. Canada&#x27;s first recorded election was held in Halifax in 1758 to elect the 1st General Assembly of Nova Scotia.

All Canadian citizens aged 18 or older who currently reside in Canada as of the polling day (or at any point in their life have resided in Canada, regardless of time away) may vote in federal elections. The most recent Canadian federal election occurred on September 20, 2021.

Elections for other levels of government may have additional residency or ownership requirements. For example, some municipalities allow both residents and non-resident landowners to vote.

==Electoral regulatory bodies==
Elections in Canada (federal, provincial, or Territorial) are organised by their respective election regulatory bodies as follows:


==National (federal) elections==
The Parliament of Canada has two chambers: the House of Commons has 338 members, elected for a maximum four-year term in single-seat electoral districts through first-past-the-post voting, and the Senate has 105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister. Senators are given permanent terms (up to age 75) and thus often serve much longer than the prime minister who was primarily responsible for their appointment.

National elections are governed by the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; and administered by an independent agency, Elections Canada. Canadians vote for their choice for local Member of Parliament (MP), who will hold a seat in the House of Commons. Under first-past-the-post voting, the plurality winner is elected and then votes as the named representative of that specific constituency in the House of Commons. But in practice usually voting in line with other members of their party caucus in the House of Commons. 

The leader of the party most likely to hold the confidence of the House of Commons becomes the prime minister. He or she stays in power as long as he holds the support of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons.

Most MPs are members of a political party, although candidates may stand for election and be elected as independents unaffiliated with any political party. The practice of listing candidates&#x27; party affiliation on ballots began with the 1972 election. Since then, the Canada Elections Act has required that a local candidate running under a party label be directly approved by the leader of their affiliated party, effectively centralizing the candidate nomination process.

Once MPs are elected, sitting members of parliament are permitted to &quot;cross the floor&quot; switching party affiliation without having to first resign and restand for office under their new affiliation. Sitting members may also be dismissed from or voluntarily leave their party and become independents. By-elections (casual vacancies) also may change the party seat counts. As a result, the distribution of seats by party affiliation often fluctuates between elections.

Although several parties are typically represented in parliament, Canada historically has had two dominant political parties: the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party, which was preceded by the Progressive Conservative Party and the Conservative Party (1867–1942). However, in the 2011 federal election, the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP), took the second largest caucus. While other parties have sometimes formed the Official Opposition, the 41st Parliament (2011–2015) was the first in which the Liberals did not form either the government or the Official Opposition.

Every government since Confederation has been either Liberal or Conservative with the exception of the Unionist government during World War I, which was a coalition of Conservatives and Liberals. Most have been majority governments (one party holding a majority of seats in the House of Commons, even if not holding a majority of votes cast in the last election). Many times due to strong showing by &quot;third parties&quot;, no party (neither the Liberals nor the Conservatives) captured a majority of seats in the House of Commons, thus producing a minority government. Faced with such a situation, the Liberals and the NDP signed a Confidence and Supply Agreement in 2022, the first of its kind in Canada.

If a government loses a confidence motion, traditionally the prime minister asks the governor general to call an election and traditionally the governor general follows that advice. However, the viceroy&#x27;s compliance is not assured -- the governor general has the right to seek out another party leader who is thought to command the confidence of the House (support from majority of the MPs) and ask them to form a government. This happened in 1926 and is referred to as the &quot;King–Byng Affair&quot;.

The five-year time limitation is strictly applied to the life of the parliament or assembly in question — this body is not deemed to have been formed until the return of the writs and ceases to exist the moment it is dissolved. It is therefore possible to run slightly longer than five years between election days, as was the case between the 1930 and 1935 elections. Although the law has allowed for a five-year gap between elections, there have in fact only been two five-year gaps since 1974: between 1974 and 1979 and between 1988 and 1993. When no party secures a majority of seats, it is common for a government to last just a couple years or less. (The 1979 government of Joe Clarke lasted just six months.) As well, a party with a majority of seats may decide to call an election early, hoping to win more seats and fearing that postponement will lower its chances for reelection. At the federal level, there have been six general elections since 2000. 

All provinces had brought in fixed-term legislation, dictating that a government will run only four years, but even where such legislation is in effect, variation is possible.

It is also possible for a general election to be delayed should Canada be embroiled in a war or insurrection. This provision was enacted to allow Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden to delay a federal election for about a year during the First World War. Since then, the provision has only been used twice, both times by provincial governments — Ontario delayed an election for a few weeks in the year following the Armistice in 1918. Saskatchewan was the only jurisdiction to delay a general election by more than a year, due to World War II, but held an election in 1944, one week more than six years after the previous vote.

The Canadian population generally misunderstands the electoral system, with most citizens believing they vote to directly elect the prime minister; that the majority choice is elected in each district; that a majority government in the House of Commons had support of a majority of voters; that a party with the most seats in the House of Commons has the right to control the House of Commons. In 2008, Conservative politicians tried to use the public&#x27;s misconception of how governments are formed to defend its decision to maintain its grip on power despite not having a majority of seats in the House of Commons. Attempts to correct erroneous claims are often delegitimized as politically motivated.

===Results===
Hugo Cyr found in 2017 that the Canadian media&#x27;s habit of announcing, before polls close on election nights, which party will form the next government misrepresents the process of the governor general or lieutenant governors appointing cabinet or executive councils, respectively, &quot;as automatic, merely a matter of arithmetic&quot;.

The leader of a party that secures a majority of seats in the House of Commons or other legislative assembly is the obvious choice to be prime minister or premier. And when no party has majority of seats, the leader of the political party that wins the plurality of seats in the elected body is typically called by the governor general or lieutenant governor to form a government. But this is not a requirement. The relevant viceroy must appoint as head of government whomever can command the confidence of the elected house. This means a party that does not win the majority of seats, or even the plurality of seats in an election, can still govern if it allies itself with another party or other parties in the same legislative chamber, so as to, combined, hold the majority of seats, whether forming a coalition government or not. Only a few coalition governments have existed in Canadian history. To produce a working majority, Liberals and the NDP signed a Confidence and Supply Agreement in 2022, the first of its kind in Canada, which allowed the Liberal minority government to rule for longer than most minority governments have done so historically. In many cases, minority governments have been sustained in power due to passage of bills by ad hoc case-by-case multi-party support, at least for a couple years.

Due to many votes not being used to elect the winner in each of the 340 or so ridings in Canada, a party&#x27;s share of seats in the House of Commons may vary considerably from the party&#x27;s share of votes cast. Smaller parties have almost always received fewer seats than their due share. Disproportional artificially-produced one-party sweep of a province&#x27;s seats is often produced. On occasion a party with more votes may receive fewer seats than a party with fewer votes. Such situations lead some to call for electoral reform and proportional representation. (&quot;Adopted and attempted electoral reform&quot; is discussed below.)

===Fixed dates===

Section 4 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; limits the term of any federal, provincial, or territorial parliament to a maximum of five years after the return of the writs of the last election. On November 6, 2006, the Parliament of Canada amended the Canada Elections Act to introduce a requirement that each federal general election must take place on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the previous poll, starting with October 19, 2009. Since then, all provinces and territories have enacted similar legislation establishing fixed election dates.

These laws, nevertheless, do not curtail the power of the governor general or a provincial lieutenant governor to dissolve a legislature prior to the fixed election date on the advice of the relevant first minister or due to a motion of no confidence.

Even where such legislation is in effect, voluntary variation is possible.

===By-elections and referenda===
By-elections can be held between general elections when seats become vacant through the resignation or death of a member. The date of the by-election is determined by the governor general, who must call it between 11 and 180 days after being notified of the seat vacancy by the Speaker of the House of Commons.

The federal government can also hold nationwide referendums on major issues. The last federal referendum was held in 1992, on proposed constitutional changes in the Charlottetown Accord. On occasion, one particular issue will dominate an election, and the election will in a sense be a virtual referendum. The most recent instance of this was the 1988 election, which was considered by most parties to be a referendum on free trade with the United States.

===Qualifications===
Every Canadian citizen 18 years of age or older has the right to vote, except for the Chief Electoral Officer and the Deputy Chief Electoral Officer. In the Canada Elections Act, inmates serving a sentence of at least two years were prohibited from voting, but on October 31, 2002, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;Sauvé v. Canada&quot; that such a law violated the section 3 of the Charter, and was rendered of no force or effect.

The federal National Register of Electors is updated to reflect various changes in the Canadian population, including address changes, reaching voting age, naturalization, and death. Every year, about 3,000,000 address changes are processed by Elections Canada from information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, Canada Post (via the National Change of Address service), provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Every year, about 400,000 Canadians reach voting age and 200,000 Canadians die, resulting in changes to the National Register of Electors based on information obtained from the Canada Revenue Agency, provincial and territorial motor vehicle registrars, and provincial electoral agencies with permanent voters lists. Additionally, over 150,000 individuals a year become naturalized Canadians, and are added to the National Register of Electors by Elections Canada based on information obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada.

===Canadian citizens abroad===
The Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s 2019 decision in &quot;Frank v Canada (AG)&quot; ruled that non-resident citizens have the right to vote regardless of time living outside of Canada.

While Section Three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that &quot;every citizen of Canada has the right to vote&quot;, in practice only those citizens 18 years of age or older who resided in Canada &quot;or&quot; had been abroad for fewer than five years were eligible to vote in federal elections from 1993 to 2019. The five-year limit was originally enacted as part of Bill C-114, &quot;An Act to Amend the Canada Elections Act&quot;, in 1993; these amendments extended the special ballot to certain prisoners, and Canadians &quot;living or travelling&quot; abroad. Exemptions to the five-year limit existed for members of the Canadian Armed Forces, employees of the federal or a provincial government stationed abroad, employees of certain international organizations, and their cohabitants.

Jean-Pierre Kingsley, then the Chief Electoral Officer of Canada for 15 years, explicitly recommended in his 2015 official post-election report that Parliament remove the five-year limit by amendment, but no action was taken.

In May 2014, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled in favour of Canadian expatriates Gillian Frank and Jamie Duong&#x27;s claim that the five-year limit was an unconstitutional restriction on the right to vote, in violation of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, leading to a period of fourteen months during which all Canadian expatriates could apply to be on the register of electors. However, the decision was reversed 2–1 on appeal at the Court of Appeal for Ontario on July 20, 2015, in a judicial opinion citing Canada&#x27;s history of using a residence-based electoral district system and a justification based on social contract theory, which held that the five-year limit was a permissible limitation of the constitutional right to vote under Section One. In response to the appellate court ruling, Elections Canada implemented changes in August 2015 to require expatriates already on the register to declare an intended date of return. The decision from the Court of Appeal was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada, which announced on April 14, 2016, that it would hear the case. The court ultimately overturned the appellate court&#x27;s decision, with the majority finding that &quot;the disenfranchisement of long-term non-resident citizens not only denies them a fundamental democratic right, but also comes at the expense of their self-worth and their dignity.&quot;

===Length of election campaigns===
The length of election campaigns can vary, but under the Elections Act, the minimum length of a campaign is 36 days and the maximum length of the campaign is 50 days. Also section 5 of the &quot;Charter&quot; requires that the Parliament sit at least once every twelve months, and thus a campaign would have to conclude in time for returns to be completed and parliament to be called into session within twelve months of the previous sitting. The federal election date must be set on a Monday (or Tuesday if the Monday is a statutory holiday).

The first two elections, the 1867 election and the 1872 election, took place over several weeks.

The 1872 election was both the second shortest and the longest campaign in history. Parliament was dissolved on July 8, 1872, while the writ was dropped on July 15, 1872. Voting occurred from July 20 to October 12. Therefore, the campaign started 12 days after dissolution of Parliament and 5 days after the writ, and was concluded 96 days (13 weeks plus 5 days) after dissolution and 89 days after the writ.

Every subsequent election has occurred on a single day. Of these elections, the longest election campaign, in terms of days from dissolution to election day, was that of 1926 election, following the King–Byng Affair, which lasted 74 days.

In terms of days from writ to election day, the longest campaign had been the 1980 election, which lasted 66 days. It was surpassed by the 2015 election, which was 78 days long from writ to election day, making it the longest campaign for a one-day election, exceeded in length only by that of 1872.

Prior to the adoption of the minimum of 36 days in law, there were six elections that lasted shorter periods of time. The last of these was the 1904 election which occurred many decades before the minimum was imposed.

In practice, the prime minister will generally keep a campaign as brief as is legal and feasible, because spending by parties is strictly limited by the Elections Act. The maximum spending by each party is increased by 1/37th of the maximum for each day that the campaign exceeds 37 days. The 1997, 2000 and 2004 elections were all of the minimum 36 days in length which has led to a common misconception that elections &quot;must&quot; be 36 days long. However, prior to 1997, elections averaged much longer: aside from the 47-day campaign for the 1993 election and the 51-day campaign for the 1988 Election, the shortest election period after World War II was 57 days and many were over 60 days in length.

Much speculation had surrounded how long the campaign for the 39th federal election would be in 2006, especially as it became certain the election would be called in the weeks preceding Christmas 2005. The government of Joe Clark, which fell on December 13, 1979, recommended a campaign of 66 days for the resulting election, and nothing legal barred a similarly lengthened campaign. In the end, the 2006 election was called on November 29, 2005, for January 23, 2006 — making a 55-day-long campaign.

==Provincial and territorial==

===System===
All of Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories use the same plurality voting system used in federal elections (First-past-the-post voting). However, since elections are monitored and organized by an independent provincial and territorial election commission, a province may legally change its electoral system should its parliament wish to do so. This would not require permission from the federal government or the Parliament of Canada. Federal elections formerly used a mixture of first-past the-post and plurality block voting; provincial elections formerly used a variety of electoral methods See &quot;Electoral reform&quot; below.

In the ten provinces and Yukon, elections are contested by candidates either representing political parties or running as independents. Territorial elections in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are held on a fully non-partisan basis, due to those territories&#x27; use of a consensus government model.

===Parties===
All Canadian provinces and Yukon, have electoral systems dominated by major political parties. In most provinces the leading parties are the same parties prominent at the federal level. However, the provincial party may or may not have an official affiliation with the federal party of the same name. Thus, names of provincial parties can sometimes be misleading when associating a provincial party with a national party, although the respective ideologies are usually fairly similar.

The Conservative Party of Canada has no provincial wings and none of the current provincial Progressive Conservative Parties are formally linked with the federal party as they all predate the 2003 establishment of the federal party, which resulted in the formal disbanding of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada. Some provincial parties (such as Alberta) formally broke off links with the federal party prior to the merger.

In British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec the provincial Liberal parties are independent of the Liberal Party of Canada, while in the other provinces, the provincial Liberal parties are autonomous entities that retain formal links with the federal party.

All provincial wings of the New Democratic Party are fully integrated with the federal party, and members of the provincial party are automatically also members of the federal party. The Green Party has provincial counterparts that are directly affiliated but do not share membership or organizational structure and support.

In Saskatchewan and Yukon, the political parties, the Saskatchewan Party and the Yukon Party, respectively, have no federal counterpart, although they are both ideologically conservative.

===Results===
The following table summarizes the results of the most recent provincial and territorial elections. A link to complete lists for each province and territory is below. The winning party is indicated in bold and by the coloured bar at the left of the table.

This table shows the party standings as a result of the most recent election, and not the current representation in legislatures; refer to the articles on the individual houses for the current state.

For lists of general elections in each province and territory, see the infobox at the bottom of the article.

1Note: Nunavut does not have political parties, and political parties in the Northwest Territories were disbanded in 1905. MLAs in both territories are elected as independents and the legislatures function under a consensus government model.

2Note: Provincial Liberal parties that are not affiliated with the federal Liberal Party of Canada.

==Municipal==

Municipal elections are held in Canada for the election of local governments. Most provinces hold all of their municipal elections on the same date. Candidates are elected through either ward or at-large systems, every two, three or four years, depending on the province. Plurality block voting is used in at-large elections and where wards elect multiple members; otherwise First past the post is used. (London, Ontario did adopt Instant-runoff voting but has been banned from using that system.)

A minority of locations in Canada have local political parties or election slates, while most locations elect only independents, or where the candidate has party ties, no party identification is allowed on the ballot.

==Senate nominee (Alberta)==
==Adopted and attempted electoral reform==

Canada is now the only major country in the world to use only First past the post in its federal and provincial elections. But in past times other systems were used or debated.

By one count, at the provincial level there have been ten instances of electoral reform in Canadian history. All of them were achieved by passage of normal legislation, without referendum. There have been no instances in Canadian history of electoral reform being achieved after the holding of a referendum.

Reforms and attempted reforms are outlined below.

===Multiple-member districts replaced by single-member districts -- federal elections, all provinces, two territories various dates===
At various times in the 19th and 20th centuries, federal elections and those held in every province used multi-member districts to elect all or some of its members. The systems used included Block Voting, Single transferable voting, Limited voting and a system where each seat was filled through a separate contest. Limited voting usually resulted in mixed multi-party representation, according representation to both the majority and at least the largest minority. STV resulted in mixed multi-party representation and every candidate that had quota were elected, thus every party with substantial backing in the district got some representation. Block voting in multi-member districts usually (but not always) produced one-party sweeps of the district&#x27;s seats.

Now federal elections — and all provincial and territorial elections — use only single-member districts, a situation that came about through electoral reform.

Eleven ridings elected multiple MPs (two at a time) at one time or another, between 1867 and 1968. These were Ottawa, West Toronto, Hamilton, Halifax (NS), Cape Breton (NS), Pictou (NS), St. John City and County (NB), Victoria and three in PEI: King&#x27;s County, Queen&#x27;s County and Prince County.

All the provinces and territories (except Nunavut) once used multiple-member districts. Most of the multiple-member districts elected just two, but others elected 5 to 7 or more. Ten MLAs were elected in the Winnipeg district from 1920 to 1949.

The provinces and territories switched to electing all their members in single-member districts elected through First past the post in these years:

* Quebec 1867
* Ontario 1926
* North-West Territories 1894 (see 1891 North-West Territories general election)
* Yukon 1905
* Manitoba 1954
* Alberta 1956
* New Brunswick 1967
* Saskatchewan 1967
* Newfoundland and Labrador 1975
* Nova Scotia 1978
* BC 1990
* PEI 1996
* (PEI&#x27;s elections were special cases. Each district elected two members. At one time voters who owned property in the district voted for the Councilman while voters resident in the district joined with the property-owners to vote for the Assemblyman. Later the exact same voters were allowed to vote for each of the two members in a district but still each seat was filled in separate contest.)

===1886, 1890 Ontario used Limited Voting in Toronto===
Toronto&#x27;s three MPPs were elected through Limited voting, where each voter could cast up to two votes.
(Later Toronto MPPs were elected in two-seat districts, with each seat elected separately through single-winner First Past The Post voting. This ended in 1926 when all the MPPs in the province began to be elected in single-member districts.)

===1909-1921 Alberta partially adopted Block Voting system===
For the 1909, 1913 and 1921 election Alberta adopted multiple-member city-wide districts in one or both of the cities of Edmonton and Calgary. Alberta&#x27;s two army representatives were elected in 1917 in one contest. Also in 1921, the city of Medicine Hat was a two-seat district. Voters cast multiple votes under the Plurality block voting to elect MLAs.

===1914 Manitoba adopted multi-member districts, later brought in STV/FPTP then STV/IRV===
In 1914, the three Winnipeg districts -- Winnipeg Centre, Winnipeg South and Winnipeg North — were each given a second member. Each seat was filled through a separate contest. The same system was used in the 1915 election.

In 1920 Winnipeg was made into a ten-member city-wide district. Manitoba began to use Single transferable voting in the new district. Later the province adopted Alternative Voting in single-member rural districts.

In 1949 Winnipeg was divided into three four-seat districts. St. Boniface got a second member and switched from AV to STV to elect its MLAs.

===1924 Alberta adopted STV/AV system===
After the election of the United Farmers of Alberta in 1921, Alberta maintained its existing mixture of multi-member districts and single-member districts. In 1924 Alberta adopted Single transferable voting in the cities&#x27; multi-member districts and the Instant-runoff voting system in single-member rural districts. (It was the first instance in North America where all the members in a legislature were elected through non-plurality methods.) This mixed system was in use until 1956. In 1956 the province brought in consistent single-member districts and First past the post elections. Medicine Hat reverted to being a single-member district before the 1930 election (IRV was then used there).

===1922 House of Commons elections===
Canadian MP William Charles Good introduced legislation in the House of Commons in June 1922 that would have seen Instant-runoff voting used in each riding where more than two candidates were competing and he also called for demonstration multi-member districts in to provide experience of proportional representation. However the bill was talked out and nothing was changed.
===1952, 1953 BC elections used Instant-runoff voting electoral system===

In 1952, BC adopted the Alternative Voting system. It retained its mixture of single-member districts and multi-member districts. In the later, it held separate contests for each seat. preferential ballots was used for the first time in a BC general election. 
After 1953 election the province returned to its previous electoral system, a mixture of single-member and multi-member districts, of Block Voting and FPTP, which in turn was replaced by consistent FPTP single-member-district contests in 1990.

===2004 Quebec proposed electoral reform===
The Liberal government of Quebec proposed electoral reform in 2004, which was scheduled to be passed in the fall of 2006 without a referendum. The project was postponed due to divergent views on how to improve it.

===2005 BC Single Transferable Vote referendum===

In a 2005 referendum 57.7% of British Columbians voted in favour of the Single Transferable Vote system. However the government required a vote of 60% to pass the change, and the vote result was ignored.

===2005 PEI Provincial MMP referendum===

Prince Edward Island held a referendum in 2005 regarding the adoption of mixed member proportional representation. The motion was defeated.

===2007 Ontario MMP referendum===
A referendum was held in Ontario in 2007 on the question of whether to establish a mixed member proportional representation (MMP) system for elections to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The vote was strongly in favour of the existing plurality voting or first-past-the-post (FPTP) system.

===2008 New Brunswick referendum===

A referendum on the issue of electoral reform in New Brunswick was proposed for 2008 by the Progressive Conservative Party, but the party was defeated in the September 2006 election and the new Liberal government cancelled the vote.

===2009 BC Proportional Representation Vote referendum===

A referendum for the proportional representation (PR) system was held in British Columbia on May 12, 2009. The adoption of PR was defeated, with 61% of voters preferring First past the post (FPTP) over Proportional Representation.

===2015 federal election===

In the 2015 federal election, both of the main opposition parties (the federal Liberals and NDP) promised to implement electoral reform no later than the next scheduled election. The NDP has long supported Mixed Member Proportional, a hybrid system proposed by the Law Commission in which voters would cast two ballots (one for a riding representative and one for their preferred party, with member elected from a regional and open list).

By comparison, the Liberals led by Justin Trudeau promised to review numerous electoral reform options through an &quot;all party parliamentary committee&quot; and to implement the changes in time for the next election. Trudeau promised to make the 2015 election &quot;Canada&#x27;s last first-past-the-post election&quot;. There are differences between the political parties over which alternative system would be better.

67% of Canadians voted in 2015 for parties that promised to replace the voting system. 88% of experts brought forward by the Liberal government recommending a proportional representation voting system, and 96% rejected Trudeau&#x27;s preferred Instant-runoff voting system. On December 1, 2016, the all party Special Committee on Electoral Reform released its final report, recommending that the government design a system of proportional representation with a gallagher index score of 5 or less, and hold a national referendum with that system against the current system. The Liberal members of the all party special-committee urged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to break his promise to change Canada&#x27;s voting system.

On February 1, 2017, the new Liberal Minister of Democratic Institutions, Karina Gould, announced that Trudeau instructed her that a change of voting system would no longer be in her mandate. She claimed a lack of broad consensus among Canadians in favour of one particular type of electoral voting and that the various political parties could not agree on a new system as reasons for the abandonment of the 2015 election promise. On May 31, 2017, the House of Commons officially rejected the final report of the all party special-committee by a vote of 146–159, with the Conservatives, NDP, BQ, and Greens voting to concur in the report, and the Liberals voting not to, notably, two Liberal MPs, Sean Casey and Nathaniel Erskine-Smith broke whip and voted to concur in the report.

During the 2015 election campaign, the Liberal Party of Canada made a promise to implement a process to review the costs of campaign platforms in future elections. It was implemented within an omnibus bill passed in 2017, with responsibility assigned to the Parliamentary Budget Office.

===2016 Prince Edward Island electoral reform referendum===

The 2016 Plebiscite on Democratic Renewal was a non-binding referendum held in the Canadian province of Prince Edward Island between October 27 – November 7, 2016. The referendum asked which of five voting systems residents would prefer to use in electing members to the Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island. The referendum was conducted using Instant runoff voting, and no option was the choice of a majority in the first count. After three options were eliminated due to being un-electable, mixed member proportional representation received more than 52% support on the final count. But government ignored the result, holding another referendum in 2019.

===2018 British Columbia Electoral Reform Referendum===

In accordance to campaign promises, the BC NDP (In a confidence and supply agreement with the Greens) scheduled a plebiscite to be held between October 22 and November 30, 2018, with voting done through mail for those registered to vote. 61.3% of voters voted for retaining First Past The Post.

===2019 Prince Edward Island Electoral Reform Referendum===

the 2019 referendum ended in defeat.
On the question &quot;Should Prince Edward Island change its voting system to a mixed member proportional voting system?&quot;, 52 percent voted against change while only 48 percent voted in favour. But neither side took a majority of votes in 60 percent of the districts so government did not consider it a clear decision. In 2021/2022, PEI again investigated switching away from the FPTP system.

===2022 Quebec proposed electoral reform===
CAQ François Legault was elected on a promise to reform the electoral system within a year of his victory in 2018. On September 25, 2019, Minister of Justice Sonia LeBel presented Bill 39, &quot;An Act to establish a new electoral system&quot; which aims to replace the First-past-the-post electoral system in favour of a mixed-member proportional representation system. According to the bill, the National Assembly would have kept 125 members. Of the 125 members, 80 would have been elected by receiving a plurality of votes in single-member districts matching the 78 federal ridings with the addition of 2 unique districts: Îles-de-la-Madeleine and Ungava). The remaining 45 members would have been chosen according to their order in a regional party list. All 17 regions of Québec would have been guaranteed at least one MNA.

Bill 39 was intended to be debated in the legislature before June 2021. The bill&#x27;s implementation would have been contingent on popular support expressed in a referendum held on the same day as the general election. Was this referendum successful, then the first legislature to be elected under mixed-member proportional would have been the 44th, in October 2026 at the latest. On April 28, 2021, Justice Minister LeBel informed a legislative committee hearing that the government would not move forward with a referendum on electoral reform in 2022. LeBel blamed the COVID-19 pandemic for altering the government&#x27;s timeline and could not commit to providing an alternate date for the referendum, effectively ending discussions about electoral reform in Quebec.
