<text>A corporate tax, also called corporation tax or company tax, is a type of direct tax levied on the income or capital of corporations and other similar legal entities. The tax is usually imposed at the national level, but it may also be imposed at state or local levels in some countries. Corporate taxes may be referred to as income tax or capital tax, depending on the nature of the tax.

The purpose of corporate tax is to generate revenue for the government by taxing the profits earned by corporations. The tax rate varies from country to country and is usually calculated as a percentage of the corporation&#x27;s net income or capital. Corporate tax rates may also differ for domestic and foreign corporations.

Many countries have tax laws that require corporations to pay taxes on their worldwide income, regardless of where the income is earned. However, some countries have territorial tax systems, which only require corporations to pay taxes on income earned within the country&#x27;s borders.

A country&#x27;s corporate tax may apply to:
* corporations incorporated in the country,
* corporations doing business in the country on income from that country,
* foreign corporations who have a permanent establishment in the country, or 
* corporations deemed to be resident for tax purposes in the country.

Company income subject to tax is often determined much like taxable income for individual taxpayers. Generally, the tax is imposed on net profits. In some jurisdictions, rules for taxing companies may differ significantly from rules for taxing individuals. Certain corporate acts or types of entities may be exempt from tax.

The incidence of corporate taxation is a subject of significant debate among economists and policymakers. Evidence suggests that some portion of the corporate tax falls on owners of capital, workers, and shareholders, but the ultimate incidence of the tax is an unresolved question.

==Economics==

Economists disagree as to how much of the burden of the corporate tax falls on owners, workers, consumers, and landowners, and how the corporate tax affects economic growth and economic inequality. More of the burden probably falls on capital in large open economies such as the US. Some studies place the burden more on labor. According to one study: &quot;Regression analysis shows that a one-percentage-point increase in the marginal state corporate tax rate reduces wages 0.14 to 0.36 percent.&quot; There have been other studies. According to the Adam Smith Institute, &quot;Clausing (2012), Gravelle (2010) and Auerbach (2005), the three best reviews we found, basically conclude that most of the tax falls on capital, not labour.&quot;

A 2022 meta-analysis found that the impact of corporate taxes on economic growth was exaggerated and that it could not be ruled out that the impact of corporate taxation on economic growth was zero.

=== Economic policy ===
Regardless of who bears the burden, corporation tax has been used as a tool of economic policy, with the main goal being economic stabilization. In times of economic downturn, lowering the corporate tax rates is meant to encourage investment, while in cases of an overheating economy adjusting the corporate tax is used to slow investment.

Another use of the corporate tax is to encourage investments in some specific industries. One such case could be the current tax benefits afforded to the oil and gas industry. A less recent example was the effort to restore heavy industries in the US by enacting the 1981 Accelerated Cost Recovery System (ACRS), which offered favorable depreciation allowances that would in turn lower taxes and increase cash flow, thus encouraging investment during the recession.

The agriculture industry, for example, could profit from the reassesment of their farming equipment. Under this new system, automobiles and breeding swine obtained a three year depreciation value; storage facilities, most equipment and breeding cattle and sheep became five year property; and land improvements were fifteen year property. The depreciation defined by ACRS was thus sizeably larger than under the previous tax system.

==Legal framework==

A corporate tax is a tax imposed on the net profit of a corporation that is taxed at the entity level in a particular jurisdiction. Net profit for corporate tax is generally the financial statement net profit with modifications, and may be defined in great detail within each country&#x27;s tax system. Such taxes may include income or other taxes. The tax systems of most countries impose an income tax at the entity level on the certain type(s) of entities (company or corporation). The rate of tax varies by jurisdiction. The tax may have an alternative base, such as assets, payroll, or income computed in an alternative manner.

Most countries exempt certain types of corporate events or transactions from income tax. For example, events related to the formation or reorganization of the corporation, which are treated as capital costs. In addition, most systems provide specific rules for taxation of the entity and/or its members upon winding up or dissolution of the entity.

In systems where financing costs are allowed as reductions of the tax base (tax deductions), rules may apply that differentiate between classes of member-provided financing. In such systems, items characterized as interest may be deductible, perhaps subject to limitations, while items characterized as dividends are not. Some systems limit deductions based on simple formulas, such as a debt-to-equity ratio, while other systems have more complex rules.

Some systems provide a mechanism whereby groups of related corporations may obtain benefit from losses, credits, or other items of all members within the group. Mechanisms include combined or consolidated returns as well as group relief (direct benefit from items of another member).

Many systems additionally tax shareholders of those entities on dividends or other distributions by the corporation. A few systems provide for partial integration of entity and member taxation. This may be accomplished by &quot;imputation systems&quot; or franking credits. In the past, mechanisms have existed for advance payment of member tax by corporations, with such payment offsetting entity level tax.

Many systems (particularly sub-country level systems) impose a tax on particular corporate attributes. Such non-income taxes may be based on capital stock issued or authorized (either by number of shares or value), total equity, net capital, or other measures unique to corporations.

Corporations, like other entities, may be subject to withholding tax obligations upon making certain varieties of payments to others. These obligations are generally not the tax of the corporation, but the system may impose penalties on the corporation or its officers or employees for failing to withhold and pay over such taxes. A company has been defined as a juristic person having an independent and separate existence from its shareholders. Income of the company is computed and assessed separately in the hands of the company. In certain cases, distributions from the company to its shareholders as dividends are taxed as income to the shareholders.

Corporations&#x27; property tax, payroll tax, withholding tax, excise tax, customs duties, value added tax, and other common taxes, are generally not referred to as &quot;corporate tax&quot;.

===Definition of corporation===

Characterization as a corporation for tax purposes is based on the form of organization, with the exception of United States Federal and most states income taxes, under which an entity may elect to be treated as a corporation and taxed at the entity level or taxed only at the member level. See Limited liability company, Partnership taxation, S corporation, Sole proprietorship.

==Types==
Most jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom and the United States, tax corporations on their income. The United States taxes most types of corporate income at 21%.

The United States taxes corporations under the same framework of tax law as individuals, with differences related to the inherent natures of corporations and individuals or unincorporated entities. For example, individuals are not formed, amalgamated, or acquired, and corporations do not incur medical expenses except by way of compensating individuals.

Most systems tax both domestic and foreign corporations. Often, domestic corporations are taxed on worldwide income while foreign corporations are taxed only on income from sources within the jurisdiction.

===Taxable income===
The United States defines taxable income for a corporation as all gross income, i.e. sales plus other income minus cost of goods sold and tax exempt income less allowable tax deductions, without the allowance of the standard deduction applicable to individuals.

The United States&#x27; system requires that differences in principles for recognizing income and deductions differing from financial accounting principles like the timing of income or deduction, tax exemption for certain income, and disallowance or limitation of certain tax deductions be disclosed in considerable detail for non-small corporations on Schedule M-3 to Form 1120.

The United States taxes resident corporations, i.e. those organized within the country, on their worldwide income, and nonresident, foreign corporations only on their income from sources within the country. Hong Kong taxes resident and nonresident corporations only on income from sources within the country.

==Rates==

Corporate tax rates generally are the same for differing types of income, yet the US graduated its tax rate system where corporations with lower levels of income pay a lower rate of tax, with rates varying from 15% on the first $50,000 of income to 35% on incomes over $10,000,000, with phase-outs.

The corporate income tax rates differ between US states and range from 2.5% to 11.5%.

The Canadian system imposes tax at different rates for different types of corporations, allowing lower rates for some smaller corporations.

Tax rates vary by jurisdiction and some countries have sub-country level jurisdictions like provinces, cantons, prefectures, cities, or other that also impose corporate income tax like Canada, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, and the United States. Some jurisdictions impose tax at a different rate on an alternative tax base.


Examples of corporate tax rates for a few English-speaking countries include:
* Australia: 28.5%, however some specialized entities are taxed at lower rates.
* Canada: Federal 11%, or federal 15% plus provincial 1% to 16%. The rates are additive.
* Hong Kong: 16.5%
* Ireland: 12.5% on trading (business) income, and 25% on non-trading income
* New Zealand: 28%
* Singapore: 17% from 2010, however a partial exemption scheme may apply to new companies.
* United Kingdom: 19% for 2017–2022. 
* United States: Federal 21%. States: 0% to 10%, deductible in computing federal taxable income. Some cities: up to 9%, deductible in computing federal taxable income. The Federal Alternative Minimum Tax of 20% is imposed on regular taxable income with adjustments.

===International corporate tax rates===

Corporate tax rates vary widely by country, leading some corporations to shield earnings within offshore subsidiaries or to redomicile within countries with lower tax rates.

In comparing national corporate tax rates one should also take into account the taxes on dividends paid to shareholders. For example, the overall U.S. tax on corporate profits of 35% is less than or similar to that of European countries such as Germany, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, which have lower corporate tax rates but higher taxes on dividends paid to shareholders.

Corporate tax rates across the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) are shown in the table.

The corporate tax rates in other jurisdictions include:

In October 2021 some 136 countries agreed to enforce a corporate tax rate of at least 15% from 2023 after the talks on a minimum rate led by OECD for a decade.

==Distribution of earnings==
Most systems that tax corporations also impose income tax on shareholders of corporations when earnings are distributed. Such distribution of earnings is generally referred to as a dividend. The tax may be at reduced rates. For example, the United States provides for reduced amounts of tax on dividends received by individuals and by corporations.

The company law of some jurisdictions prevents corporations from distributing amounts to shareholders except as distribution of earnings. Such earnings may be determined under company law principles or tax principles. In such jurisdictions, exceptions are usually provided with respect to distribution of shares of the company, for winding up, and in limited other situations.

Other jurisdictions treat distributions as distributions of earnings taxable to shareholders if earnings are available to be distributed, but do not prohibit distributions in excess of earnings. For example, under the United States system each corporation must maintain a calculation of its earnings and profits (a tax concept similar to retained earnings). A distribution to a shareholder is considered to be from earnings and profits to the extent thereof unless an exception applies. The United States provides reduced tax on dividend income of both corporations and individuals.

Other jurisdictions provide corporations a means of designating, within limits, whether a distribution is a distribution of earnings taxable to the shareholder or a return of capital.

===Example===
The following illustrates the dual level of tax concept:

Widget Corp earns 100 of profits before tax in each of years 1 and 2. It distributes all the earnings in year 3, when it has no profits. Jim owns all of Widget Corp. The tax rate in the residence jurisdiction of Jim and Widget Corp is 30%.
==Other corporate events==
Many systems provide that certain corporate events are not taxable to corporations or shareholders. Significant restrictions and special rules often apply. The rules related to such transactions are often quite complex.

===Formation===
Most systems treat the formation of a corporation by a controlling corporate shareholder as a nontaxable event. Many systems, including the United States and Canada, extend this tax free treatment to the formation of a corporation by any group of shareholders in control of the corporation. Generally, in tax free formations the tax attributes of assets and liabilities are transferred to the new corporation along with such assets and liabilities.

Example: John and Mary are United States residents who operate a business. They decide to incorporate for business reasons. They transfer the assets of the business to Newco, a newly formed Delaware corporation of which they are the sole shareholders, subject to accrued liabilities of the business in exchange solely for common shares of Newco. Under United States principles, this transfer does not cause tax to John, Mary, or Newco. If on the other hand Newco also assumes a bank loan in excess of the basis of the assets transferred less the accrued liabilities, John and Mary will recognize taxable gain for such excess.

===Acquisitions===
Corporations may merge or acquire other corporations in a manner a particular tax system treats as nontaxable to either of the corporations and/or to their shareholders. Generally, significant restrictions apply if tax free treatment is to be obtained. For example, Bigco acquires all of the shares of Smallco from Smallco shareholders in exchange solely for Bigco shares. This acquisition is not taxable to Smallco or its shareholders under U.S. or Canadian tax law if certain requirements are met, even if Smallco is then liquidated into or merged or amalgamated with Bigco.

===Reorganizations===
In addition, corporations may change key aspects of their legal identity, capitalization, or structure in a tax free manner under most systems. Examples of reorganizations that may be tax free include mergers, amalgamations, liquidations of subsidiaries, share for share exchanges, exchanges of shares for assets, changes in form or place of organization, and recapitalizations.

==Interest deduction limitations==
Most jurisdictions allow a tax deduction for interest expense incurred by a corporation in carrying out its trading activities. Where such interest is paid to related parties, such deduction may be limited. Without such limitation, owners could structure financing of the corporation in a manner that would provide for a tax deduction for much of the profits, potentially without changing the tax on shareholders. For example, assume a corporation earns profits of 100 before interest expense and would normally distribute 50 to shareholders. If the corporation is structured so that deductible interest of 50 is payable to the shareholders, it will cut its tax to half the amount due if it merely paid a dividend.

A common form of limitation is to limit the deduction for interest paid to related parties to interest charged at arm&#x27;s length rates on debt not exceeding a certain portion of the equity of the paying corporation. For example, interest paid on related party debt in excess of three times equity may not be deductible in computing taxable income.

The United States, United Kingdom, and French tax systems apply a more complex set of tests to limit deductions. Under the U.S. system, related party interest expense in excess of 50% of cash flow is generally not currently deductible, with the excess potentially deductible in future years.

The classification of instruments as debt on which interest is deductible or as equity with respect to which distributions are not deductible can be complex in some systems. The Internal Revenue Service had proposed complex regulations under this section (see TD 7747, 1981-1 CB 141) which were soon withdrawn (TD 7920, 1983-2 CB 69).

==Foreign corporation branches==
Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations differently from domestic corporations. No international laws limit the ability of a country to tax its nationals and residents (individuals and entities). However, treaties and practicality impose limits on taxation of those outside its borders, even on income from sources within the country.

Most jurisdictions tax foreign corporations on business income within the jurisdiction when earned through a branch or permanent establishment in the jurisdiction. This tax may be imposed at the same rate as the tax on business income of a resident corporation or at a different rate.

Upon payment of dividends, corporations are generally subject to withholding tax only by their country of incorporation. Many countries impose a branch profits tax on foreign corporations to prevent the advantage the absence of dividend withholding tax would otherwise provide to foreign corporations. This tax may be imposed at the time profits are earned by the branch or at the time they are remitted or deemed remitted outside the country.

Branches of foreign corporations may not be entitled to all of the same deductions as domestic corporations. Some jurisdictions do not recognize inter-branch payments as actual payments, and income or deductions arising from such inter-branch payments are disregarded. Some jurisdictions impose express limits on tax deductions of branches. Commonly limited deductions include management fees and interest.

Nathan M. Jenson argues that low corporate tax rates are a minor determinate of a multinational company when setting up their headquarters in a country.

==Losses==
Most jurisdictions allow interperiod allocation or deduction of losses in some manner for corporations, even where such deduction is not allowed for individuals. A few jurisdictions allow losses (usually defined as negative taxable income) to be deducted by revising or amending prior year taxable income. Most jurisdictions allow such deductions only in subsequent periods. Some jurisdictions impose time limitations as to when loss deductions may be utilized.

==Groups of companies==
Several jurisdictions provide a mechanism whereby losses or tax credits of one corporation may be used by another corporation where both corporations are commonly controlled (together, a group). In the United States and Netherlands, among others, this is accomplished by filing a single tax return including the income and loss of each group member. This is referred to as a consolidated return in the United States and as a fiscal unity in the Netherlands. In the United Kingdom, this is accomplished directly on a pairwise basis called group relief. Losses of one group member company may be &quot;surrendered&quot; to another group member company, and the latter company may deduct the loss against profits.

The United States has extensive regulations dealing with consolidated returns. One such rule requires matching of income and deductions on intercompany transactions within the group by use of &quot;deferred intercompany transaction&quot; rules.

In addition, a few systems provide a tax exemption for dividend income received by corporations. The Netherlands system provides a &quot;participation exception&quot; to taxation for corporations owning more than 25% of the dividend paying corporation.

==Transfer pricing==

A key issue in corporate tax is the setting of prices charged by related parties for goods, services or the use of property. Many jurisdictions have guidelines on transfer pricing which allow tax authorities to adjust transfer prices used. Such adjustments may apply in both an international and a domestic context.

==Taxation of shareholders==
Most income tax systems levy tax on the corporation and, upon distribution of earnings (dividends), on the shareholder. This results in a dual level of tax. Most systems require that income tax be withheld on distribution of dividends to foreign shareholders, and some also require withholding of tax on distributions to domestic shareholders. The rate of such withholding tax may be reduced for a shareholder under a tax treaty.

Some systems tax some or all dividend income at lower rates than other income. The United States has historically provided a dividends received deduction to corporations with respect to dividends from other corporations in which the recipient owns more than 10% of the shares. For tax years 2004–2010, the United States also has imposed a reduced rate of taxation on dividends received by individuals.

Some systems currently attempt or in the past have attempted to integrate taxation of the corporation with taxation of shareholders to mitigate the dual level of taxation. As a current example, Australia provides for a &quot;franking credit&quot; as a benefit to shareholders. When an Australian company pays a dividend to a domestic shareholder, it reports the dividend as well as a notional tax credit amount. The shareholder utilizes this notional credit to offset shareholder level income tax.

A previous system was utilised in the United Kingdom, called the advance corporation tax (ACT). When a company paid a dividend, it was required to pay an amount of ACT, which it then used to offset its own taxes. The ACT was included in income by the shareholder resident in the United Kingdom or certain treaty countries, and treated as a payment of tax by the shareholder. To the extent that deemed tax payment exceeded taxes otherwise due, it was refundable to the shareholder.

==Alternative tax bases==
Many jurisdictions incorporate some sort of alternative tax computation. These computations may be based on assets, capital, wages, or some alternative measure of taxable income. Often the alternative tax functions as a minimum tax.

United States federal income tax incorporates an alternative minimum tax. This tax is computed at a lower tax rate (20% for corporations), and imposed based on a modified version of taxable income. Modifications include longer depreciation lives assets under MACRS, adjustments related to costs of developing natural resources, and an addback of certain tax exempt interest. The U.S. state of Michigan previously taxed businesses on an alternative base that did not allow compensation of employees as a tax deduction and allowed full deduction of the cost of production assets upon acquisition.

Some jurisdictions, such as Swiss cantons and certain states within the United States, impose taxes based on capital. These may be based on total equity per audited financial statements, a computed amount of assets less liabilities or quantity of shares outstanding. In some jurisdictions, capital based taxes are imposed in addition to the income tax. In other jurisdictions, the capital taxes function as alternative taxes.

Mexico imposes an alternative tax on corporations, the IETU. The tax rate is lower than the regular rate, and there are adjustments for salaries and wages, interest and royalties, and depreciable assets.

==Tax returns==
Most systems require that corporations file an annual income tax return. Some systems (such as the Canadian, United Kingdom and United States systems) require that taxpayers self assess tax on the tax return. Other systems provide that the government must make an assessment for tax to be due. Some systems require certification of tax returns in some manner by accountants licensed to practice in the jurisdiction, often the company&#x27;s auditors.

Tax returns can be fairly simple or quite complex. The systems requiring simple returns often base taxable income on financial statement profits with few adjustments, and may require that audited financial statements be attached to the return. Returns for such systems generally require that the relevant financial statements be attached to a simple adjustment schedule. By contrast, United States corporate tax returns require both computation of taxable income from components thereof and reconciliation of taxable income to financial statement income.

Many systems require forms or schedules supporting particular items on the main form. Some of these schedules may be incorporated into the main form. For example, the Canadian corporate return, Form T-2, an eight-page form, incorporates some detail schedules but has nearly 50 additional schedules that may be required.

Some systems have different returns for different types of corporations or corporations engaged in specialized businesses. The United States has 13 variations on the basic Form 1120 for S corporations, insurance companies, Domestic international sales corporations, foreign corporations, and other entities. The structure of the forms and imbedded schedules vary by type of form.

Preparation of non-simple corporate tax returns can be time consuming. For example, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service states in the instructions for Form 1120 that the average time needed to complete form is over 56 hours, not including record keeping time and required attachments.

Tax return due dates vary by jurisdiction, fiscal or tax year, and type of entity. In self-assessment systems, payment of taxes is generally due no later than the normal due date, though advance tax payments may be required. Canadian corporations must pay estimated taxes monthly. In each case, final payment is due with the corporation tax return.

<text>World Taekwondo (WT; formerly the World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) until June 2017) is an international federation governing the sport of Taekwondo and is a member of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF).

The World Taekwondo Federation was established on 28 May 1973, at its inaugural meeting held at the Kukkiwon with participation of 35 representatives from around the world. there are 213 member nations. Since 2004, Choue Chung-won has been the president of World Taekwondo, succeeding the first president, Kim Un-yong.

On 17 July 1980, the International Olympic Committee recognized World Taekwondo Federation at its 83rd Session in Moscow, Russia. Taekwondo debuted as a demonstration sport of the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. On 4 September 1994, Taekwondo was adopted as an official sport of the 2000 Summer Olympics at the 103rd IOC Session in Paris, France.

In June 2017, World Taekwondo Federation was renamed as World Taekwondo to avoid its acronym WTF clashing with the common Internet slang WTF.

==Organizational structure==

The main constituents of World Taekwondo are the following: The General Assembly (GA); the World Taekwondo Council; the President and the Secretariat. In addition to its main constituents World Taekwondo also encompasses other organizations that have been duly authorized or recognized by the Council and the GA and that operate under the auspices of World Taekwondo. 

World Taekwondo-recognized or authorized organizations include but are not limited to the Continental Unions. The General Assembly is the general meeting of the council and representatives of MNAs of World Taekwondo. The GA is World Taekwondo&#x27;s supreme decision making organ. Its decisions are final, whereas the Council consists of the President, the Vice Presidents, the Secretary General, the Treasurer and the Council members. Responsibilities of the council are for example planning and management of World Taekwondo organization and operations and the control over the financial budget and financial reports. The President is elected by the GA from among its members for a term of four years. The President must lead and represent World Taekwondo; concurrently lead the GA and the council as its chairman, and preside over meetings and other activities as well as designate official duties to Vice Presidents on an ad-hoc basis for the betterment of the development of the sport of taekwondo and World Taekwondo operations. Furthermore, the President appoints the chairmen and members of World Taekwondo Committees. Lastly, the Secretariat of World Taekwondo is installed at the location of World Taekwondo headquarters for the execution of the secretarial affairs and duties of the President and the Secretary General.

==History==
The World Taekwondo Federation (WTF) was established on May 28, 1973, at the inaugural meeting held at the Kukkiwon with participation of 35 representatives from the world after it separated from the International Taekwon-Do Federation because of political reasons. At that time, Un Yong Kim was elected president for a four-year term. One of the main Constituents of World Taekwondo, the Secretariat was formed on June 3, 1973, and began operating.

On October 8, 1974, World Taekwondo was affiliated to the General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), now SportAccord. Until the 1980s, the European (May, 1976), the Asian (October, 1976), the Pan American (September, 1978) and the African (April, 1979) Taekwondo Unions inaugural meetings were held, while Oceania&#x27;s Taekwondo Union was not recognized as the 5th Continental Union of World Taekwondo until July 16, 2005. 

The recognition of the IOC towards World Taekwondo at its 83rd session in Moscow on July 17, 1980, was the cornerstone for their Cooperation. Thereupon Taekwondo participated in the 24th Olympiad at Changchung Gymnasium in Seoul, Korea as well as the 25th Olympiad at the Palau Blaugrana in Barcelona, Spain as a demonstration sport. 

In recognition of his contribution to the Olympic Movement Un Yong Kim was awarded the Order of Commander by Prince Rainier of Monaco on September 21, 1993. Moreover, Taekwondo was adopted as an official sport of the 2000 Summer Olympics at the 103rd IOC session in Paris, France, on September 4, 1994. Half a year later, on February 15, 1995, World Taekwondo was affiliated with the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) as a provisional member. 

After the first appearance of Taekwondo as an Olympic Sport in the 2000 Summer Olympics, the IOC executive board confirms Taekwondo as an Olympic Sport for the 2004 Summer Olympics on December 11–13, 2000. Furthermore, the inclusion of taekwondo in the 2008 Summer Olympics was confirmed on November 29, 2002, at the 114th IOC session held in Mexico City.

On February 15, 2004, the Vice President (Italy) Sun Jae Park was elected as Acting President of World Taekwondo due to the resignation of the founding President Un Yong Kim from the presidency of World Taekwondo. Four month later Chung Won Choue was elected as new President of World Taekwondo at the extraordinary General Assembly on June 11, 2004. Taekwondo was confirmed as program of the 2012 Summer Olympics on July 8, 2005.

In June 2017, the body was renamed World Taekwondo to avoid the &quot;negative connotations&quot; of the acronym associated with the common Internet slang WTF.

==Mission and objectives==
The mission of World Taekwondo is to provide effective international governance of taekwondo as an Olympic sport and Paralympic sport. The envisioned objectives of World Taekwondo are to promote, expand, and improve worldwide the practice of taekwondo in light of its educational, cultural, and sports values (the &quot;Taekwondo movement&quot;) and to promote fair play, youth development, and education as well as to encourage peace and cooperation though participation in sports. Moreover, World Taekwondo wants to promote or sanction international taekwondo competitions and relating to those World Taekwondo resolves to constantly improve technical rules regulating taekwondo competitions and poomsae competitions sanctioned or promoted by World Taekwondo, including the taekwondo event of the Olympic Games and Paralympic Games. Furthermore, World Taekwondo wants to take action in order to strengthen the unity and protect the interests of World Taekwondo and the Taekwondo Movement as well as to engage in other activities in support of the above objectives. World Taekwondo undertakes its missions and objectives in cooperation with independent affiliated organizations including World Taekwondo Academy, World Taekwondo Peace Corps, World Taekwondo Demonstration Team, Pro Taekwondo Federation, Global Taekwondo Support Federation, and Taekwondo International Federation.

== Membership ==
As of 2023, the global membership of World Taekwondo stands at 213 national member associations (NMAs), spanning five Continental Unions (CUs).

===Continental Unions (CUs)===
* African Taekwondo Union (AFTU) – 53 national member associations
* Asian Taekwondo Union (ATU) – 44 national member associations
* European Taekwondo Union (ETU) – 52 national member associations
* Oceania Taekwondo Union (OTU) – 19 member national associations
* Pan American Taekwondo Union (PATU) – 45 national member associations

===National Member Associations (NMAs)===
==Sparring==
Under World Taekwondo and Olympic rules, sparring is a full-contact event and takes place between two competitors on a matted 8 meter octagon.

Scoring of valid points is determined by using the electronic scoring system installed in what World Taekwondo designates as &quot;Protector and Scoring Systems&quot; (PSS). In events where the PSS are used, all scoring is determined by judges using manual scoring devices.

There are now two alternate forms of contest.

=== Standard form ===
At the end of three rounds, the athlete with the most points is declared the winner. A tie, however, results in an additional round, known as &quot;Golden Point&quot;. If no point is scored during the Golden Point, the player with the most registers on the PSS is declared the winner. If one athlete is knocked out, or is otherwise unable to continue as a result of a legal technique by his opponent, the other athlete is automatically awarded the victory.

=== Best of three system ===
In the best of three system, the duration of the contest comprises three rounds of two minutes each. The contestant with the most number of points per round wins the round. The winning contestant is the one who wins the most number of rounds out of three.

=== Points ===
Points are awarded for permitted, accurate, and powerful techniques to the legal scoring areas; light contact does not score any points. Points are awarded as follows:
* 1 point for a strike to the chest or when &quot;Gam-jeom&quot; is given to the opponent
* 2 points for a standard kick to the chest
* 3 points for a standard kick to the head
* 4 points for a turning kick to the chest
* 5 points for a turning kick to the head
The competition sparring rules were updated by World Taekwondo General Assembly in November 2016 in order to upgrade the sport so that it &quot;dazzles and excites.&quot; Changes include encouraging more offensive actions with modifications to some of the point scoring and by disallowing certain leg blocks, elimination of mid-game interruptions, and improvements that simplify penalty assessment and foster better officiating. These new rules took effect in January 2017.
Beginning in 2009, a kick or punch that makes contact with the opponent&#x27;s &quot;hogu&quot; (the body guard that functions as a scoring target) scores one point; if a kick to the &quot;hogu&quot; involved a technique that includes fully turning the attacking competitor&#x27;s body, so that the back is fully exposed to the targeted competitor during execution of the technique (spinning kick), an additional point is awarded; a kick to the head scores three points; as of October 2010 an additional point is awarded if a turning kick was used to execute this attack. Punches to the head are not allowed. As of March 2010, no additional points are awarded for knocking down an opponent (beyond the normal points awarded for legal strikes).

The referee can give penalties (called &quot;gam-jeom&quot;) at any time for rule-breaking, such as hitting an area not recognized as a target, falling, or stalling the match.

Until 2008, if one competitor gained a 7-point lead over the other, or if one competitor reached a total of 12 points, then that competitor was immediately declared the winner and the match ended. These rules were abolished by World Taekwondo at the start of 2009. In October 2010 World Taekwondo reintroduced a point gap rule. Under the new rule if a competitor has a 12-point lead at the end of the second round or achieves a 12-point lead at any point in the third round then the match is over and the athlete in the lead is declared the winner.

World Taekwondo-sanctioned events allow any person, regardless of school affiliation or martial arts style, to compete in World Taekwondo events as long as he or she is a member of World Taekwondo Member National Association in his or her nation. These National Associations are open for anyone to join.

===WT World Ranking===
As of the rules established in 2017, it has been arranged a new grading for competitions that will award points to the best placed athletes. Previously the maximum was G10, now it was doubled to G20. The &quot;G&quot; value of a tournament is used to calculate how many points an athlete is awarded for winning a tournament. For example, the Olympics as a G-20 tournament is worth five times as many points to the athlete as a Continental Championship (a G-4 tournament). To compete on a WT Ranking-Points Competition the athletes need a Global License, which allows them to secure points on any country that hosts a tournament and it&#x27;s affiliated with WT.

The points awarded to the athletes are given within the following formula:

* Rank of Athlete within the tournament x Grade of Tournament

Where, generally, excluding the Summer Olympics where players tie at the same place due to the repechages:

* The first-place athlete is said to have a &quot;rank&quot; of 10 within the tournament
* The second-place athlete is said to have a rank of 6 within the tournament (60% of first-place)
* The third-place athlete is said to have a rank of 3.6 within the tournament (60% of second-place)
* The fourth-place athlete is said to have a rank of 2.16 within the tournament (60% of third-place)

Thereafter (generally) the percentage used is 70% rather than 60%

Example:

An athlete places 3rd at a G-8 event. Then the athlete is awarded:

(10 points x 60% x 60%) x 8 = 28.8 points.

===Attrition of Athlete Points===
When an athlete is awarded points at a Ranking-Point Tournament, those points remain attached to that athlete for four years. During a four-year period, points are deducted from the athletes rank after each completed year by 25% of the initial points.

<doc id="912416" wikidata="Q3506135" url="?curid=912416" title="The Night of the Triffids">
<text>The Night of the Triffids is a science fiction novel by British writer Simon Clark, published in 2001. It is a sequel to John Wyndham&#x27;s 1951 novel &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. Clark has been commended for his success at mimicking Wyndham&#x27;s style, but most reviewers have not rated his creation as highly as the original work. Clark&#x27;s book is written in the first person and narrated by David Masen, the son of Wyndham&#x27;s protagonist.

==Plot summary==

The story begins on the Isle of Wight, 25 years after the events from &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;. The community there has thrived, primarily by refining triffid oil into fuel.

One morning, a solar blackout occurs and triffids once again besiege the island. Pilot David Masen (son of Bill and Josella Masen from &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;) takes to the skies to investigate the cause of the blackout; however, even after taking his plane into the atmosphere as high as it can go, he finds that there is no end to the absolute darkness.

On David&#x27;s descent, he loses communication with the control tower and is forced to make a crash landing on a floating island populated by triffids. There, he meets an orphaned young girl, Christina, who has been surviving on her own in the wild since she was a young child, primarily because she is immune to triffid stings. The pair are rescued by an American ship that takes them to Manhattan Island in New York City.

Manhattan, a secure and self-contained community like the one on the Isle of Wight, appears at first glance to be a utopia seemingly untouched by the triffid catastrophe. David quickly falls in love with his tour guide, Kerris Baedekker, who is one of the hundreds of daughters of General Fielding, the primary ruler of the city. David divulges to General Fielding that the Isle of Wight has a considerable fleet of aircraft, which, using triffid oil for fuel, can fly much farther than the Manhattan fleet, which runs on wood alcohol.

Just before David is set to return home to the Isle of Wight, he is kidnapped by a rebel group known as the Forresters. However, David ends up siding with them when they reveal that Fielding is actually a terrible dictator named Torrence, an old enemy of David&#x27;s father, and that he keeps Manhattan prosperous by using the black and blind citizens as slaves, unbeknownst to the rest of the population. The Forresters further reveal that Torrence is planning to attack the Isle of Wight in order to steal their triffid oil refining machinery and that he intends to create a race of soldiers immune to triffid poison by harvesting Christina&#x27;s ovaries and implanting them into all the viable women in Manhattan.

In order to rescue Christina and Kerris from Torrence&#x27;s headquarters in the Empire State Building, the Forresters unleash thousands of triffids into the city, some as gigantic as sixty feet tall. Unfortunately, Torrence and his guards manage to fend off the attacks and capture David and his group. However, Torrence is defeated when thousands of slaves arrive, released from their slave camps during the triffid attack, and persuade the soldiers to turn on the dictator.

At the end of the story, it is revealed that the great blackout was caused by interstellar dust, and that even though it continues to wreak havoc on the global climate, people everywhere are still surviving. It is also revealed that up to 25 percent of the population is immune to triffid stings, due to repeated exposure to small amounts of the plant&#x27;s poison when consuming triffids for food.

==Literary significance and criticism==
Comments on &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; include:
:&quot;Clark scores fairly high in pastiching Wyndham&#x27;s style, at least.&quot;
:&quot;Wyndham did hit notes of poetry and grim beauty more often than Clark does&quot; 
:&quot;Overall, The Night of the Triffids is a fine work of fiction that will keep any sci-fi/horror fan happy&quot;
:&quot;It fails, however, in its main aim, that of supplying a worthy follow-up to one of the classics of British science fiction.&quot;

==Awards==
&quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot; won the British Fantasy Award in 2002.

==Adaptations==
On June 19, 2014 Big Finish Productions announced an audio drama adaptation of &quot;The Night of the Triffids&quot;, released in September 2014. Big Finish&#x27;s production was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 Extra on June 29, 2016.

<doc id="912417" wikidata="Q5593765" url="?curid=912417" title="Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Concept Music Video was an award that was presented to recording artists at the 30th Grammy Awards in 1988, and the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989, for quality, concept music videos. The Grammy Awards (Grammys) is an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and was originally called the Gramophone Awards; awards are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Beginning in 1982, the academy began to honor quality music videos with the Video of the Year category, which was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 and was replaced with two awards; Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album. Criteria changes for the 1988 and 1989 ceremonies resulted in the Best Concept Music Video award being presented alongside the award for Best Performance Music Video. Best Concept Music Video award recipients were the English rock band Genesis for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; and the American singer &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic for &quot;Fat&quot;. The academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the categories are now known as Best Short Form Music Video and Best Long Form Music Video.

==Background==
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences began to honor quality music videos with the Grammy Award for Video of the Year category in 1982. The first two award recipients were former member of The Monkees Michael Nesmith for the hour-long video &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; (also known as &quot;Michael Nesmith in Elephant Parts&quot;) and Olivia Newton-John for &quot;Olivia Physical&quot;. The Video of the Year category was discontinued in 1984 when MTV established the MTV Video Music Awards whose top award is also presented for Video of the Year. For the 26th Grammy Awards the academy replaced the category with awards for Best Video, Short Form, and Best Video Album. For the awards held in 1988 and 1989, the criteria changed and awards for the categories Best Concept Music Video, and Best Performance Music Video were presented. The academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the categories were renamed Best Music Video, Short Form, and Best Music Video, Long Form. In 1998, the categories were retitled Best Short Form Music Video, and Best Long Form Music Video, respectively.

==Recipients==


For the 30th Grammy Awards (1988), Best Concept Music Video nominees included David Bowie for &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot;, Kate Bush for &quot;The Whole Story&quot;, the English rock band Genesis for &quot;Land Of Confusion&quot;, David Lee Roth for &quot;David Lee Roth&quot;, and Janet Jackson for &quot;Control – The Videos Part II &quot;. The music video for Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Day-In Day-Out&quot;, directed by Julien Temple, included &quot;offending&quot; scenes such as a man urinating on Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Hollywood Walk of Fame star, which was edited out for television broadcast. Bush&#x27;s &quot;imaginative&quot; video sampler accompanies her greatest hits album of the same name and includes music videos for songs throughout her career to that point. The music video for &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;, a song included on the band&#x27;s 1986 album &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, contained &quot;Spitting Image&quot; puppets of Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher and other notable individuals. David Lee Roth&#x27;s self-titled video consisted of promotional clips created for his debut solo EP &quot;Crazy from the Heat&quot; and album &quot;Eat &#x27;Em and Smile&quot;. Jackson&#x27;s video collection, which was certified gold in the United States, contained six promotional videos recorded for singles from her album &quot;Control&quot;. Awards were presented to members of Genesis (Tony Banks, Phil Collins, and Mike Rutherford) as the performing artists, Jim Yukich and John Lloyd as the video directors, and Jon Blair as the video producer.

Nominees for the 31st Grammy Awards were the Hampton String Quartet for &quot;Get a Job&quot;, George Harrison for &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, the American rock band Talking Heads for &quot;Storytelling Giant&quot;, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic for &quot;Fat&quot;, and Neil Young for &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot;. &quot;Get a Job&quot;, a song recorded originally by the American group The Silhouettes, appears on the Hampton String Quartet&#x27;s album &quot;What If Mozart Wrote &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot;&quot;, a collection of 1950s R&amp;B and pop music songs performed in the styles of Beethoven, Debussy, Mozart, and other composers. &quot;When We Was Fab&quot;, a song from the album &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, is constructed from quotations written when The Beatles were at the height of their fame and features Harrison playing a sitar. The music video shows Elton John dressed as a walrus, a reference to the 1967 song &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;. &quot;Storytelling Giants&quot; is a collection of Talking Heads&#x27; music videos and additional material linking them together. Two of the nominated music videos had connections to Michael Jackson; &quot;Fat&quot; is a parody of Jackson&#x27;s song &quot;Bad&quot;, and the video for &quot;This Note&#x27;s for You&quot; depicts a Jackson look-alike&#x27;s hair catching fire; a parody of an incident that occurred during a shoot for a Pepsi television advertisement in 1984. In the &quot;Fat&quot; video, Yankovic becomes a &quot;grossly overweight guy&quot; through the use of cosmetics and special effects, and leads a group of overweight people on a parade. The award was presented to Yankovic as the performing artist, along with Jay Levey as the video director and Susan Zwerman as the video producer.

<text>In Greek mythology, Oeonus (; Ancient Greek: Οἰωνὸν) was a son of Licymnius who accompanied Heracles. He was killed in Sparta in Heracles&#x27;s company. Heracles had promised Licymnius that he would bring back his son, and so, when Oeonus died, Heracles burned his body and took the ashes back to the father. This is supposed to be the origin of the Greek practice of cremation.

<doc id="912421" wikidata="Q1371354" url="?curid=912421" title="Forced assimilation">
<text>Forced assimilation is the involuntary cultural assimilation of religious or ethnic minority groups, during which they are forced by a government to adopt the language, national identity, norms, mores, customs, traditions, values, mentality, perceptions, way of life, and often the religion and ideology of an established and generally larger community belonging to a dominant culture. 

The enforced use of a dominant language in legislation, education, literature, and worship also counts as forced assimilation. Unlike ethnic cleansing, the local population is not outright destroyed and may or may not be forced to leave a certain area. Instead, the assimilation of the population is made mandatory. This is also called &quot;mandatory assimilation&quot; by scholars who study genocide and nationalism. 

Mandatory assimilation has sometimes been made a policy of new or contested nations, often during or in the aftermath of a war. Some examples are both the German and French forced assimilation in the provinces Alsace and (at least a part of) Lorraine, and some decades after the Swedish conquests of the Danish provinces Scania, Blekinge and Halland the local population was submitted to forced assimilation, or even the forced assimilation of ethnic Teochews in Bangkok by the Siam government during World War I until the 1973 uprising.

== Overview ==
Forced assimilation is a mode of assimilation that occurs by force, when one society conquers another society. It may manifest through the establishment of different types of colonies and tends to take place during the process of colonization. Forced assimilation may persist into the postcolonial era.

Numerous societies have undergone forced assimilation following the establishment of plantation, occupation, or settler colonies. This process often intersects with broader historical events such as enslavement, forced immigration, or foreign conquest. Forced assimilation occurs when a society is deprived of the ability to preserve its cultural or societal institutions and customs, potentially resulting in either full or partial assimilation.

Full forced assimilation entails the complete adoption of another society&#x27;s language, religion, and social practices, accompanied by full integration into the dominant society. Conversely, partial forced assimilation may involve the adoption of aspects of another society&#x27;s language, religion, and social norms, yet without the acquisition of equivalent privileges enjoyed by the dominant society. Such incomplete assimilation is marked by the perpetuation of hierarchical relationships between the dominant and subordinate societies.

==Ethnic==

If a state puts extreme emphasis on a homogeneous national identity, it may resort, especially in the case of minorities originating from historical foes, to harsh, even extreme measures to &#x27;exterminate&#x27; the minority culture, sometimes to the point of considering the only alternative its physical elimination (expulsion or even genocide).

States, mostly based on the idea of nation, perceived the presence of ethnic or linguistic minorities as a danger for their own territorial integrity. In fact minorities could claim their own independence, or to be rejoined with their own motherland. The consequence was the weakening or disappearing of several ethnic minorities.

The latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century saw the rise of Euro-Christian nationalism, which asserts the right to homeland for each nation with a common heritage through race, religion, and language. Previously, a country consisted largely of whatever peoples lived on the land that was under the dominion of a particular ruler. Thus, as principalities and kingdoms grew through conquest and marriage, a ruler could wind up with peoples of many different ethnicities under his dominion. This also reflected the long history of migrations of different tribes and peoples throughout Europe. Much of European history in the latter half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century can be understood as efforts to realign national boundaries with this concept of &quot;one people, one nation&quot;.

===East Asia===
In Japan and Korea, as each country stated themselves as a single-nation country, ethnic minorities had to hide their national identity for centuries, and many resulted in assimilation, migrants of Peninsular Japonic and Tungusic peoples in Korea.

Ainu and Ryukyuan people in Japan were subject to forced assimilation.

Thailand sought to assimilate its many Chinese immigrants by only granting Thai citizenship if they renounced all loyalty to China, learned to speak Thai, changed their names, and sent their children to Thai schools.

During the Cambodian genocide, Cham Muslims were persecuted by the Khmer Rouge regime, first through forced assimilation, but later through direct violence (mass killing, raiding and destroying their villages).

====China====
At least one million members of China&#x27;s Muslim Uyghur minority have been detained in mass detention camps in Xinjiang, termed &quot;reeducation camps&quot;, aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs. Approximately one million Tibetan minority children are experiencing the impacts of Chinese government policies designed to assimilate Tibetan people culturally, religiously, and linguistically, primarily through a residential school system.

=== Europe ===
==== Azerbaijan ====
Ethnic minorities in Azerbaijan, including Talyshis (see Talysh assimilation), Lezghins, Kurds, Tats and Georgian-Ingilois, are subjected to forced assimilation into Azerbaijani Turkic identity and ethnic discrimination by the Azerbaijani government since the Soviet era.

==== France ====
France practiced forced assimilation of Occitans and other ethnic minorities whose native language was not French, such as Alsatians, Basques and Catalans. This process extended during the 19th and 20th centuries and was known as Vergonha. It included &quot;being made to reject and feel ashamed of one&#x27;s (or one&#x27;s parents&#x27;) mother tongue through official exclusion, humiliation at school and rejection from the media&quot; and was endorsed by French political leaders from Henri Grégoire onward. The number of Occitan speakers in France was reduced from 39% of the French population in 1860 to 7% in 1993.

To this day, France has also continuously refused to ratify the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, and native non-French languages in France continue to be denied official recognition, with Occitans, Basques, Corsicans, Catalans, Flemings, Bretons, Alsatians, and Savoyards still having no explicit legal right to conduct public affairs in their regional languages within their home lands.

==== Russia ====
As part of the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine the Russian government forcibly relocated thousands of Ukrainian children to Russia and adopted them out to Russian families, a process that is in violation of the forced assimilation prohibition of the Genocide Convention. On March 17, 2023, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian Children&#x27;s Rights Commissioner Maria Alekseyevna Lvova-Belova for their roles in this alleged war crime.

=== Middle East ===
==== Turkey ====

The denial of Kurds was the official state policy of Turkey for several decades, which denied that Kurds constituted an ethnic group and instead alleged that they are a subgroup of Turks. The words &#x27;Kurd&#x27; and &#x27;Kurdistan&#x27; were omitted by state institutions, and during the 20th century, Kurds were referred to as Mountain Turks (). To this day, Turkey does not recognize Kurds as an ethnic group, though the Kurdish languages are now permitted to be used.

It was denied that a Kurdish nation had ever existed; according to the Turkish History Thesis, the Kurds migrated from Turanic Central Asia in the past. During the 1920s and 1930s, merchants were fined separately for every word of Kurdish they used. In school, students were punished if they were caught speaking Kurdish and during the 1960s Turkish language boarding schools were established in order to separate the students from their Kurdish relatives and Turkify the Kurdish population.

=== North America ===
Enslaved Africans in the 16th to 19th centuries throughout North America, South America, and the Caribbean were forced to abandon their native languages, religions, and cultural practices. Many communities descending from these groups formed traditions and linguistic dialects that still face discrimination and attempts at forced assimilation.

==== United States and Canada ====

In the United States and Canada, forced assimilation had been practiced against indigenous peoples through the American Indian boarding schools and Canadian Indian residential school system. The same assimilation was also faced by French and Spanish speaking peoples populating the U.S. and Canada, through language bans, violence, and extreme prejudice by anglophones into and throughout the 20th century.

During World War I and World War II, people of Japanese, German, and Italian descent faced societal and political pressure to stop speaking their native languages and abandon their cultural practices in the United States and Canada, even being interred in concentration camps (See Japanese American internment, Japanese Canadian internment, German American internment, German Canadian internment, Italian American internment, Italian Canadian internment). 

=== Oceania ===

==== Australia ====

As a part of its genocide of Indigenous Australians, the Australian government enacted policies of forced assimilation that included removing Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children from their families throughout the twentieth century.

==Religious==
Assimilation also includes the (often forced) conversion or secularization of religious members of a minority group.

Throughout the Middle Ages and until the mid-19th century, most Jews in Europe were forced to live in small towns (shtetls) and were restricted from entering universities or high-level professions.

In the Kingdom of Hungary, most ethnic Romanians, Croatians, Czechs, and other non-Hungarians were forcibly converted to Catholicism, and those who resisted conversion were usually arrested.

<text>Mount Kumgang () or the Kumgang Mountains is a mountain massif, with a peak, in Kangwon-do, North Korea. It is located on the east coast of the country, in Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, formerly part of Kangwŏn Province, and is part of the Taebaek mountain range which runs along the east of the Korean Peninsula. The mountain is about from the South Korean city of Sokcho in Gangwon-do.

==Seasonal names==
Mount Kumgang has been known for its scenic beauty since ancient times and is the subject of many different works of art. Including its spring name, &quot;Kŭmgangsan&quot; (, ), it has many different names for each season, but it is most widely known today in the Korean language as Kŭmgangsan. In summer, it is called Pongraesan (); in autumn, Phung&#x27;aksan (); in winter, Kaegolsan ().

== Formation ==
The creation of Mt. Kŭmgang is closely related to the unique climate and distinctive geological activity of the area. Mt. Kŭmgang is a region where rain and snow fall relatively heavily, and the climate varies depending on altitude and even east-west location. The Kŭmgang geological layer is composed of several types of rocks from ancient geological periods. The most widely distributed rocks are granites of two types (mica mixed and stained), with granite-gneissic fertilization zones being formed in some areas. The rocks are transversely oriented and form a joint in various directions, forming unusual terrains and strange rocks, which have been formed as a result of erosion for a long period of crustal activity and weathering, from 10 million years to the present.

==Geography==

Kŭmgang Mountain ranges from Tongchon County, Kangwon Province in North Korea, to Inje County, Gangwon Province in South Korea. The area is up to 40 km long east–west, 60 km north–south, with a total size of 530 km² to the back of Baekdudaegan. It is divided between the &quot;Inner Kumgang&quot; in the west and the &quot;Outer Kumgang&quot; in the east. The area on the east side of the Yeongeum River is called &quot;Hae Kumgang&quot; (&quot;Sea Kumgang&quot;). The main peak of Mt. Kŭmgang is Pirobong, and there are more than 60 peaks over 1,000 meters. Combined with countless sub-peaks, they were historically called &quot;12,000 peaks&quot;. Many scenic spots in the area are designated as natural monuments of North Korea. The southern part of the &quot;Outer Kumgang&quot; is also called &quot;New Kumgang&quot;. There are 11 areas in Outer Kumgang, 8 in Inner Kumgang and 3 in Hae Kumgang, although not all have been opened.

=== Inner Kumgang ===
Since ancient times, the name Kumgang has been mainly used for the &quot;Inner Kumgang&quot; (), which, located in the western part of the central pole, contains the main peak of Mount Kŭmgang.

=== Outer Kumgang ===
&quot;Outer Kumgang&quot; () is located to the east of the &quot;Inner kumgang&quot; and covers an area along the east coast. The Outer Kŭmgang area is noted for the large number of peaks. Chipson Peak (literally &quot;rock of ten thousand forms&quot;) is known for its many waterfalls. It includes many mountain peaks including Moonjoo Peak, Ho Peak, Sangdeung Peak, etc. The &quot;Sea Kŭmgang&quot; area is known for the lagoons and stone pillars.

Kuryong Falls (&quot;Nine Dragons Falls&quot;) in Kuryongyeon is one of the three major waterfalls in Korea along with Daeseung Falls in Seoraksan. It is 74 meters in height and 4 meters in width. The waterfall cliffs and the bottom are made of one granite mass. Bibbong Waterfall is 139 meters higher, and is named for its refreshing water stream. The rocks there are associated with unique legends.

===Environment===
Much of the mountain is covered by mixed broadleaf and coniferous forest and protected in a 60,000 ha national park. Some 25,000 ha has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports endangered red-crowned cranes.

== Climate ==
It belongs to the alpine region and has relatively high rainfall, with heavy rainfall in July and August. The East-West difference is severe, and the rainfall increases from Haegeumgang to Oegeumgang, but due to the phenomenon of Foehn, the rainfall decreases from Naegeumgang to Naegeumgang. It is also warm and humid in preparation for the overall climate in Korea. However, depending on the altitude, cold temperatures of minus 10 to 30 degrees Celsius will continue in the winter, and depending on the region, snow will fall as early as October. These climatic conditions lie at the intersection of the northern and southern plants.

==Mount Kumgang Tourist Region==
 
Starting in 1998, South Korean tourists were allowed to visit Mount Kumgang, initially travelling by cruise ship, and later more commonly by coach. In 2002, the area around the mountain was separated from Kangwŏn Province and organized as a separately-administered Tourist Region. The land route was opened in 2003. A rail link exists on the North Korean side up to the border, but no tracks are laid between Gangneung and the border in South Korea.

In 1998, there were 15,500 tourists in November and December, in 1999 there were 148,000, and in 2000 213,000. In 2001 tourist numbers dropped to 58,000 amidst disagreements over the access over land. As of 2002, almost 500,000 had visited the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region. Tourist numbers then reached about 240,000 a year. In June 2005, Hyundai Asan announced the one millionth South Korean visit to the area.

The Mount Kumgang Tourist Region, developed by Hyundai Asan, was thought to be one way for the North Korean government to earn hard currency. The currency at the resort was neither the South Korean won nor the North Korean won, but the Chinese RMB and US dollar. Food and services to South Korean tourists were provided by some North Koreans. But most of the staff in the hotels are Chinese citizens of Korean heritage with Korean language skills. There had been plans to expand the site but as of late 2022 there were reports based on satellite imagery that the resort&#x27;s facilities, including a golf course and a floating hotel, were being dismantled pursuant to directives from leader Kim Jong Un.

On the morning of July 11, 2008, a 53-year-old South-Korean tourist was shot and killed while walking on the resort&#x27;s beach. Park Wang-ja entered a military area by crossing over a sand dune and was shot twice by North Korean soldiers. North Korea claimed that sentries had no choice but to shoot her because, despite their order to stop, she fled. South Korea demanded an on-the-spot survey, but North Korea declined it, claiming all the facts were clear and all responsibilities were the victim&#x27;s and South Korea&#x27;s. Due to the shooting, South Korea temporarily suspended all trips to Mount Kumgang.

In March 2010, the DPRK government warned of &quot;extraordinary measures&quot; if the tourism ban were not lifted. On April 23, 2010, the North Korean government seized 5 properties owned by South Korea at the resort, saying that it was done &quot;in compensation for the damage the North side suffered due to the suspension of the tour for a long period.&quot; In seizing the properties, North Korea also alluded to the Baengnyeong incident, showing displeasure with South Korea blaming North Korea for the sinking of the ship.

Since April 2010, North Korea is now permitting companies to run tours from the North Korean side, making it appear increasingly unlikely that tours will be resumed from the South. However, on October 1, 2010, news reports said, &quot;Red Cross officials from the two Koreas agreed Friday to hold reunions for families separated by the Korean War amid mixed signals from North Korea on easing tensions over the sinking of a South Korean warship. One hundred families from each country will attend the meetings from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5 at a hotel and reunion center at the North&#x27;s scenic Diamond Mountain resort, Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said.&quot;

As of September 2011, North Korea has begun operating cruises directly from Rason in north-eastern North Korea, to the port in Mount Kumgang, offering visitors the chance to stay in the resorts previously run by the south. Although they are aimed primarily at Chinese guests, western companies are also offering the tours.

== Cultural significance ==

Various Korean artists have revered Kŭmgangsan as a subject for art and poetry since antiquity. Numerous poets and artists who lived during the Joseon period (1392–1910) made pilgrimages to Kŭmgangsan. Among other well-known works are the &quot;Geumgang jeondo&quot; and the &quot;Pungaknaesan chongramdo&quot;, painted in the 1740s by Jeong Seon.

The division of the Korean peninsula in 1950 resulted in the South Korean people finding themselves unable to visit this beloved mountain for the better part of 50 years. The barbed-wire fence erected as part of the DMZ (Demilitarized zone) separating the two Koreas proved to be an obstacle stronger than any other barrier.

In 1894 the British writer Isabella Bird Bishop referred to it in her travelogue as &quot;Diamond Mountain&quot;.

Kŭmgangsan is the subject of a 1962 South Korean folk song, &quot;Longing for Mt. Geumgang&quot;. It is also the setting of the 1973 North Korean revolutionary opera &quot;The Song of Mount Kumgang&quot;, and is a central motif in the South Korea TV drama Saimdang, Memoir of Colors.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Performance Music Video was an honor presented to recording artists at the 30th Grammy Awards in 1988 and the 31st Grammy Awards in 1989 for quality performance music videos. The Grammy Awards, an annual ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

Beginning in 1982, the Academy began to honor quality music videos with the Video of the Year category. This category was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984 and was replaced by awards for Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album. Criteria changes for the 1988 and 1989 ceremonies resulted in the Best Performance Music Video award being presented alongside the award for Best Concept Music Video. Best Performance Music Video award recipients were Anthony Eaton as the video producer of &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Trust All-Star Rock Concert&quot;, a recording of a benefit concert for The Prince&#x27;s Trust, and the Irish rock band U2 for &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;. The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the categories are now known as Best Short Form Music Video and Best Long Form Music Video.

==Background==
The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences began to honor quality music videos with the Video of the Year category in 1982. The first two award recipients were former member of The Monkees, Michael Nesmith for the hour-long video &quot;Elephant Parts&quot; (also known as &quot;Michael Nesmith in Elephant Parts&quot;) as well as Olivia Newton-John for &quot;Olivia Physical&quot;. The Video of the Year category was discontinued with the establishment of the MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, the top award of which is also presented for Video of the Year. The Academy replaced the category with the awards for Best Video, Short Form and Best Video Album beginning with the 26th Grammy Awards. For the awards held in 1988 and 1989, the criteria changed and honors were presented for the categories Best Concept Music Video and Best Performance Music Video. The Academy returned to the previous format in 1990, though the categories were renamed Best Music Video, Short Form and Best Music Video, Long Form. In 1998, the categories were retitled Best Short Form Music Video and Best Long Form Music Video, respectively.

==Recipients==
For the 30th Grammy Awards (1988), Best Performance Music Video nominees included Anthony Eaton for producing &quot;The Prince&#x27;s Trust All-Star Rock Concert&quot; (a recording of a benefit concert for The Prince&#x27;s Trust), Russian American pianist Vladimir Horowitz for &quot;Horowitz in Moscow&quot;, Cyndi Lauper for &quot;Cyndi Lauper in Paris&quot;, Bobby McFerrin for &quot;Spontaneous Inventions&quot;, and Barbra Streisand for &quot;One Voice&quot;. Directed by Brian Large, &quot;Horowitz in Moscow&quot; was a recording of Horowitz&#x27;s first concert appearance in Russia since 1925 and features compositions by Chopin, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Schubert and other composers. &quot;Cyndi Lauper in Paris&quot; was filmed at Zénith de Paris on March 12, 1987, the final date of her world tour. Produced by John Diaz and directed by Andy Morahan, the recording features Sterling Campbell on drums, Rick Derringer on guitar, Sue Hadjopoulas on percussion, Kevin Jenkins on bass, and David Rosenthal on keyboards. Ferrin&#x27;s &quot;Spontaneous Inventions&quot;, directed by Bud Schaetzle, is an hour-long recording of a 1986 performance in Hollywood. Streisand&#x27;s video &quot;One Voice&quot;, directed by Dwight Hemion, is a companion piece to her 1987 live album of the same name. Originally broadcast as an HBO special, the September 6, 1986 concert recording marked her first &quot;official&quot; live performance since 1972, held in part as a protest against the nuclear arms race during Ronald Reagan&#x27;s presidency. The concert was filmed in Streisand&#x27;s backyard and features special appearances by Burt Bacharach, Barry Gibb, Richard Marx, Carole Bayer Sager and comedian Robin Williams. The award was presented to Eaton as the producer of the concert recording, which included appearances by Elton John, Sting, Tina Turner and others.

Nominees for the 31st Grammy Awards were English musician David Bowie for &quot;Glass Spider&quot;, Canadian musician and producer David Foster for &quot;The Symphony Sessions&quot;, American singer-songwriter John Cougar Mellencamp for &quot;Check It Out&quot;, Stevie Nicks for &quot;Stevie Nicks: Live at Red Rocks&quot;, and the Irish rock band U2 for &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;. &quot;Glass Spider&quot; was a recording of a live two-hour concert filmed in Sydney in November 1987. &quot;The Symphony Sessions&quot; included ten compositions by Foster presented as a &quot;collage of video images&quot; in performance with the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra. Recorded over a period of five nights in Vancouver, Foster wrote, arranged, produced and played piano for the project (which included a recording of the theme for the 1988 Winter Olympics) with the assistance of Jeremy Lubbock, David Paich, and Lee Ritenour. The music video for &quot;Check It Out&quot;, a song that appears on Mellencamp&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;The Lonesome Jubilee&quot;, was filmed live at Market Square Arena in Indianapolis, Indiana on December 11, 1987. Directed by Marty Callner, &quot;Stevie Nicks: Live at Red Rocks&quot; is an hour-long recording of a live concert filmed at Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Morrison, Colorado with special guests Mick Fleetwood and Peter Frampton. The music video for U2&#x27;s &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot; was filmed on the roof of a Los Angeles liquor store. During the filming process, police ordered the band to stop the shoot &quot;due to fears the crowd was getting out of hand&quot;. Awards were presented to members of U2 (Bono, Adam Clayton, The Edge, Larry Mullen, Jr.) as the performing group, along with Meiert Avis as the video director and Ben Dossett and Michael Hamlyn as the video producers.

<doc id="912426" wikidata="Q109964" url="?curid=912426" title="Folk etymology">
<text>Folk etymology – also known as (generative) popular etymology, analogical reformation, (morphological) reanalysis and etymological reinterpretation – is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one through popular usage. The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reinterpreted as resembling more familiar words or morphemes.

The term &quot;folk etymology&quot; is a loan translation from German &quot;Volksetymologie&quot;, coined by Ernst Förstemann in 1852. Folk etymology is a productive process in historical linguistics, language change, and social interaction. Reanalysis of a word&#x27;s history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to loanwords or words that have become archaic or obsolete.

Folk/popular etymology may also refer to a popular false belief about the etymology of a word or phrase that does not lead to a change in the form or meaning. To disambiguate the usage of the term &quot;folk/popular etymology&quot;, Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann proposes a clear-cut distinction between the derivational-only popular etymology (DOPE) and the generative popular etymology (GPE): the DOPE refers to a popular false etymology involving no neologization, and the GPE refers to neologization generated by a popular false etymology.

Examples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form , originally from Greek (&quot;asparagus&quot;) remade by analogy to the more familiar words &quot;sparrow&quot; and &quot;grass&quot;. When the alteration of an unfamiliar word is limited to a single person, it is known as an eggcorn.

== Productive force ==
The technical term &quot;folk etymology&quot; refers to a change in the form of a word caused by erroneous popular suppositions about its etymology. Until the academic development of comparative linguistics and description of laws underlying sound changes, the derivation of a word was mostly guess-work. Speculation about the original form of words in turn feeds back into the development of the word and thus becomes a part of a new etymology.

Believing a word to have a certain origin, people begin to pronounce, spell, or otherwise use the word in a manner appropriate to that perceived origin. This popular etymologizing has had a powerful influence on the forms which words take. Examples in English include &quot;crayfish&quot; or &quot;crawfish&quot;, which are not historically related to &quot;fish&quot; but come from Middle English &quot;crevis&quot;, cognate with French &quot;écrevisse&quot;. Likewise &quot;chaise lounge&quot;, from the original French &quot;chaise longue&quot; (&quot;long chair&quot;), has come to be associated with the word &quot;lounge&quot;.

== Related phenomena ==
Other types of language change caused by reanalysis of the structure of a word include rebracketing and back-formation.

In rebracketing, users of the language change, misinterpret, or reinterpret the location of a boundary between words or morphemes. For example, the Old French word comes from Arabic , with the initial of understood as part of the article. Rebracketing in the opposite direction saw the Middle English become &quot;an apron&quot;.

In back-formation, a new word is created by removing elements from an existing word that are interpreted as affixes. For example, Italian is derived from the verb and English &quot;edit&quot; derives from &quot;editor&quot;. Some cases of back-formation are based on folk etymology.

== Examples in English ==
In linguistic change caused by folk etymology, the form of a word changes so that it better matches its popular rationalisation. Typically this happens either to unanalysable foreign words or to compounds where the word underlying one part of the compound becomes obsolete.

=== Loanwords ===
There are many examples of words borrowed from foreign languages, and subsequently changed by folk etymology.

The spelling of many borrowed words reflects folk etymology. For example, &quot;&quot; borrowed from Old French was variously spelled or in Middle English, but was altered by association with &quot;iron&quot;. Other Old French loans altered in a similar manner include &quot;belfry&quot; (from ) by association with &quot;bell&quot;, &quot;female&quot; (from ) by &quot;male&quot;, and &quot;penthouse&quot; (from ) by &quot;house&quot;. The variant spelling of &quot;licorice&quot; as &quot;&quot; comes from the supposition that it has something to do with liquid. Anglo-Norman (influenced by ) and Late Latin were respelled for similar reasons, though the ultimate origin of all three is Ancient Greek .

Reanalysis of loan words can affect their spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. The word &quot;cockroach&quot;, for example, was borrowed from Spanish but was assimilated to the existing English words &quot;cock&quot; and &quot;roach&quot;. The phrase &quot;forlorn hope&quot; originally meant &quot;storming party, body of skirmishers&quot; from Dutch &quot;lost troop&quot;. But confusion with English &quot;hope&quot; has given the term an additional meaning of &quot;hopeless venture&quot;.

Sometimes imaginative stories are created to account for the link between a borrowed word and its popularly assumed sources. The names of the &quot;serviceberry&quot;, &quot;service tree&quot;, and related plants, for instance, come from the Latin name . The plants were called in Old English, which eventually became &quot;service&quot;. Fanciful stories suggest that the name comes from the fact that the trees bloom in spring, a time when circuit-riding preachers resume church services or when funeral services are carried out for people who died during the winter.

A seemingly plausible but no less speculative etymology accounts for the form of &quot;Welsh rarebit&quot;, a dish made of cheese and toasted bread. The earliest known reference to the dish in 1725 called it &quot;Welsh rabbit&quot;. The origin of that name is unknown, but presumably humorous, since the dish contains no rabbit. In 1785 Francis Grose suggested in &quot;A Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; that the dish is &quot;a Welch rare bit&quot;, though the word &quot;rarebit&quot; was not common prior to Grose&#x27;s dictionary. Both versions of the name are in current use; individuals sometimes express strong opinions concerning which version is correct.

=== Obsolete forms ===
When a word or other form becomes obsolete, words or phrases containing the obsolete portion may be reanalyzed and changed.

Some compound words from Old English were reanalyzed in Middle or Modern English when one of the constituent words fell out of use. Examples include &quot;&quot; from Old English . The word &quot;&quot; from Old English fell out of use during the sixteenth century and the compound was eventually reanalyzed with the Modern English word &quot;&quot; . A similar reanalysis caused &quot;&quot;, from Old English with a once-common prefix , to be respelled as though it is related to &quot;sand&quot;. The word &quot;island&quot; derives from Old English . The modern spelling with the letter &quot;s&quot; is the result of comparison with the synonym &quot;&quot; from Old French and ultimately as a Latinist borrowing of , though the Old French and Old English words are not historically related. In a similar way, the spelling of &quot;&quot; was likely affected by comparison with &quot;wood&quot;.

The phrase &quot;&quot;, meaning to flatter, comes from Middle English . This was an allusion to a fourteenth-century French morality poem, &quot;Roman de Fauvel&quot;, about a chestnut-coloured horse who corrupts men through duplicity. The phrase was reanalyzed in early Modern English by comparison to &quot;favour&quot; as early as 1510.

Words need not completely disappear before their compounds are reanalyzed. The word &quot;&quot; was originally &quot;&quot;. The original meaning of &quot;fast&quot; &#x27;fixed in place&#x27; still exists, as in the compounded words &quot;steadfast&quot; and &quot;colorfast&quot;, but by itself mainly in frozen expressions such as &quot;stuck fast&quot;, &quot;hold fast&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. The songbird &quot;wheatear&quot; or &quot;white-ear&quot; is a back-formation from Middle English , referring to the prominent white rump found in most species. Although both &quot;white&quot; and &quot;arse&quot; are common in Modern English, the folk etymology may be euphemism.

Reanalysis of archaic or obsolete forms can lead to changes in meaning as well. The original meaning of &quot;hangnail&quot; referred to a corn on the foot. The word comes from Old English + , but the spelling and pronunciation were affected by folk etymology in the seventeenth century or earlier. Thereafter, the word came to be used for a tag of skin or torn cuticle near a fingernail or toenail.

== Other languages ==

Several words in Medieval Latin were subject to folk etymology. For example, the word meaning &#x27;reward&#x27; was borrowed from Old High German . The &quot;l→d&quot; alteration is due to confusion with Latin . Similarly, the word or (related to modern English &quot;bachelor&quot;) referred to a junior knight. It is attested from the eleventh century, though its ultimate origin is uncertain. By the late Middle Ages its meaning was extended to the holder of a university degree inferior to master or doctor. This was later re-spelled , probably reflecting a false derivation from , alluding to the possible laurel crown of a poet or conqueror.

In the fourteenth or fifteenth century, French scholars began to spell the verb as on the false belief it was derived from Latin . In fact it comes from .

The Italian word , meaning &#x27;unicorn&#x27; derives from 13th-century &quot;lunicorno&quot; (&quot;lo&quot; &#x27;the&#x27; + &quot;unicorno&quot; &#x27;unicorn&#x27;). Folk etymology based on &quot;lione&quot; &#x27;lion&#x27; altered the spelling and pronunciation. Dialectal &quot;liofante&quot; &#x27;elephant&#x27; was likewise altered from &quot;elefante&quot; by association with &quot;lione&quot;.

The Dutch word for &#x27;hammock&#x27; is . It was borrowed from Spanish (ultimately from Arawak ) and altered by comparison with and . German shares this folk etymology.

&quot;Islambol&quot;, a folk etymology meaning &#x27;Islam abounding&#x27;, is one of the names of Istanbul used after the Ottoman conquest of 1453.

An example from Persian is the word &#x27;chess&#x27;, which is derived from the Sanskrit (&quot;four-army [game]&quot;; 2nd century BCE), and after losing the &quot;u&quot; to syncope, became in Middle Persian (6th century CE). Today it is sometimes factorized as + , or .

Some Indonesian feminists discourage usage of the term &quot;wanita&quot; (&#x27;woman&#x27;) and replacing it with &quot;perempuan&quot;, since &quot;wanita&quot; itself has misogynistic roots. First, in Javanese, &quot;wanita&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;wani ditata&quot; (dare to be controlled), also, &quot;wanita&quot; is taken from Sanskrit (someone desired by men).

In Turkey, the political Democrat Party changed its logo in 2007 to a white horse in front of a red background because many voters folk-etymologized its Turkish name as .

<text>Samuel Yellin (1884–1940) was an American master blacksmith and metal designer.

==Early life and education==

Samuel Yellin was born to a Jewish family in Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Ukraine in the Russian Empire in 1884. At the age of eleven, he was apprenticed to a master ironsmith. In 1900, at the age of sixteen, he completed his apprenticeship. Shortly afterwards he left Ukraine and traveled through Europe. In about 1905, he arrived in Philadelphia, in the United States, where his mother and two sisters were already living. His brother arrived in Philadelphia at about the same time. In early 1906, Yellin took classes at the Pennsylvania Museum School of Industrial Art and within several months was teaching classes there, a position he maintained until 1919.

==Career==
In 1909, Yellin opened his own metalsmith shop. In 1915, the firm of Mellor, Meigs &amp; Howe, for whom he designed and created many commissions, designed a new studio for Samuel Yellin Metalworkers at 5520 Arch Street in Philadelphia. Yellin died in 1940, but the firm remained there for decades under the direction of Yellin&#x27;s son, Harvey. Following Harvey&#x27;s death, the business moved forward under the ownership and guidance of Samuel Yellin&#x27;s granddaughter, Clare Yellin. The firm has now been in operation for over 110 years as of this writing (2022).

During the building boom of the 1920s, Samuel Yellin Metalworkers employed as many as 250 workers, many of them European artisans. Although Yellin was highly knowledgeable about traditional craftsmanship and design, he also championed creativity and the development of new designs. Samuel Yellin&#x27;s works can be found in some of the finest buildings in America.

===Honors===
Yellin received awards from the Art Institute of Chicago (1919), the American Institute of Architects (1920), the Architectural League of New York (1922), and the Bok Civic Award from the City of Philadelphia (1925). He was a member of the Philadelphia Chapter of the American Institute of Architects and the T Square Club, the Philadelphia Sketch Club, and the Architectural League of New York.

<doc id="912441" wikidata="Q350520" url="?curid=912441" title="Adam Nelson">
<text>Adam McCright Nelson (born July 7, 1975) is an American shot putter and Olympic gold medalist. Nelson competed in three consecutive Olympic Games in 2000, 2004 and 2008. In addition to his gold medal at the 2004 Olympics, Nelson won a silver medal at the 2000 Olympics.

He is married to Laci Nelson and he has 2 daughters, Caroline and Lauren Nelson.

==Personal life==

Adam Nelson was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended The Lovett School in Atlanta where he was a letterman and a standout in football and track and field. Nelson graduated from Lovett in 1993 and moved on to Dartmouth College, graduating from the Ivy League school in 1997. As an undergraduate at Dartmouth, Nelson earned various accolades as a member of the track and field team, including the collegiate shot put title at the 1997 NCAA championships with a throw of .

Nelson holds the Dartmouth shot put record with a throw of . In addition to shot put, Nelson played football at Dartmouth, as a linebacker and later, as a defensive tackle. In 1993 he became the first freshman ever to play football on the Dartmouth squad. Prior to 1993, the Ivy League prohibited first-year students from playing on the varsity football team. Nelson was a member of Dartmouth&#x27;s 1996 undefeated Ivy League champion team.

At Dartmouth, Adam Nelson served as President of Chi Heorot fraternity.

Prior to his own Olympics experience, Nelson worked at a concession stand during the 1996 Summer Olympics in his hometown of Atlanta.

==International career==
Adam Nelson earned a silver medal In the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Prior to the Games, Nelson was considered the favorite to win gold. He had won the title in every major shot put event leading up to the Olympic Games that summer including the 2000 Olympic Trials. At the 2000 Games, his throw of was short of the winning throw of gold medalist, Arsi Harju of Finland.

Nelson&#x27;s personal best in the shot put is , which he threw in 2002. At that time, this was the third-longest throw in U.S. history and the ninth-farthest ever in the world.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece the shot put was held in a spectacular setting at the original Stadium of Ancient Olympia, bringing Olympic competition back to the venue for the first time in over a millennium.

In Athens, Nelson jumped out in front of the field with his first round throw of . He held the lead going into the final round, despite fouling throws in rounds 2, 3, 4 and 5. As the event leader, Nelson was the last to throw in the sixth and final round. The current second-place thrower, Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine, stepped up on his final throw and improved with a throw of to tie Nelson for first place. Nelson entered the ring for his final throw to break the tie. He unleashed what looked to be initially a gold medal-winning 70-foot throw, but Nelson was flagged for stepping on the line to the left-front of the circle. Nelson protested vociferously to the officials at the time of the call, but later apologized for his emotional reaction.

With Nelson and Bilonog precisely tied on distance after six-rounds, the tie-breaker rule came into effect, counting the competitors&#x27; second-best throws. Because Nelson had fouled on each throw after the opening round, he had no second mark. Yuriy Bilonog was awarded the gold medal; Nelson was awarded his second consecutive Olympic silver medal. Nelson&#x27;s shot put Silver was the first track and field medal for the United States in the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Nelson&#x27;s silver medal in the shot put at the 2004 Summer Olympics was upgraded to a gold medal retroactively in 2013 after Yuriy Bilonog&#x27;s urine sample tested positive for performance-enhancing drug use. With the advent of drug testing at international athletic competitions, it has become increasingly common for athlete disqualifications from placements in standings months or years after the event conclusions.

At the 2005 World Athletics Championships, Nelson won his first major world title with a throw of . Two years later, he won a silver medal at the 2007 World Athletics Championships with a throw of . At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Nelson failed to throw a valid mark in the final. In the qualifying round, Nelson had a throw of . At the 2009 and 2011 World Athletics Championships, Nelson failed to medal in the finals, finishing 5th and 8th place, respectively.

Nelson attempted to make the U.S. Olympic Team for a fourth time at the 2012 United States Olympic Trials, but did not make the final round in wet conditions.

==2013 elevation to Olympic gold medal==
In 2012, retroactive testing on competitors&#x27; urine samples retained from the 2004 Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee revealed that 2004 Olympic gold medalist Yuriy Bilonog of Ukraine was guilty of performance-enhancing drug use. In 2012, the IOC re-tested approximately 100 urine samples from specific events in the 2004 Games and found that four medal winners in Track and Field (both men and women, all in the throwing events) tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs.

On December 5, 2012, the IOC announced that men&#x27;s shot put winner Bilonog, and women&#x27;s shot put third-place finisher, Svetlana Krivelyova of Russia, re-tests showed positive for the steroid agent, Oxandrolone. Bilonog was stripped of his gold medal. The IOC, following established rules, allowed Bilonog (and the others disqualified) 21 days to appeal the ruling. Although no appeal was filed, the IOC waited another five months, to May 30, 2013, before declaring Adam Nelson the 2004 Olympic champion and awarding him the gold medal.

Nelson received his gold medal from a United States Olympic Committee official at an airport food court in Atlanta.

In 2017, Adam Nelson joined Michael Phelps in speaking before a U.S. Congressional committee examining anti-doping measures in international sporting events.

==Spin technique==

Nelson throws with his right arm, utilizing the &quot;spin&quot; technique to generate speed and power within the 7-foot-diameter (2.135-meter) throwing ring. While the &quot;spin&quot; is considered a more powerful style (because of its rotational speed), competitors have a greater tendency to foul compared to those who use the more traditional &quot;glide&quot; technique. Although throws are usually launched within the legal sector, spinners are more prone to lose their balance in their follow-through and to step on the front toe board (or, to have a foot come down to the side, on or over the ring&#x27;s 7-foot circle line.) For example, at the 2004 Olympic Games, Nelson foot-fouled on five of his six rounds of throws, though he did still win the gold medal.

==Advertising==
During the early 2005 shot put season, Nelson solicited sponsors by wearing T-shirts reading &quot;Space for Rent.&quot; This culminated in May when Nelson found a sponsor in the amount of $12,000, slightly more than the donation Nelson had made to the World Anti-Doping Agency following his second Olympic silver medal, and prior to that Olympics&#x27; winner later being disqualified for positive drug test. Nelson went on to win the IAAF World Championships later that season (though he wore the USA uniform in that competition).

==Post-shot put career==
Since retiring from formal athletic competition, Nelson has trained top-level athletes in football, golf, baseball, and track and field. He has worked for NBC Sports as an expert on field events. Nelson remains a strong advocate of clean sport competition and often speaks out against the use of performance-enhancing drugs in athletic competition.

In 2017, Nelson moved to Houston with his wife and two kids, where he works for The D10, an events organization, that like the Olympic movement, has found ways to leverage physical performance to create a massive social impact, raising over $12 million for pediatric cancer research and treatment.

In 2020, he returned to his alma mater to become the athletic director of The Lovett School.

The sky, distant mountains, distant buildings, and other unreachable objects are projected onto the cube&#x27;s faces (using a technique called cube mapping), thus creating the illusion of distant three-dimensional surroundings. A skydome employs the same concept but uses either a sphere or a hemisphere instead of a cube.

Processing of 3D graphics is computationally expensive, especially in real-time games, and poses multiple limits. Levels have to be processed at tremendous speeds, making it difficult to render vast skyscapes in real-time. Additionally, real-time graphics generally have depth buffers with limited bit-depth, which puts a limit on the amount of details that can be rendered at a distance.

To avoid these problems, games often employ skyboxes. Traditionally, these are simple cubes with up to six different textures placed on the faces. By careful alignment, a viewer in the exact middle of the skybox will perceive the illusion of a real 3D world around it, made up of those six faces.

As a viewer moves through a 3D scene, it is common for the skybox to remain stationary with respect to the viewer. This technique creates the illusion that objects in the skybox are infinitely far away, since they do not exhibit any parallax motion, whereas 3D objects closer to the viewer do appear to move. This is often a good approximation of reality, where distant objects such as clouds, stars and even mountains appear to be stationary when the viewpoint is displaced by relatively small distances. However, designers must be careful about which objects they include in a fixed skybox. If an object of known size (e.g. a car) is included in the texture, and is large enough for the viewer to perceive it as close by, the lack of parallax motion may be perceived as unrealistic or confusing.

The source of a skybox can be any form of texture, including photographs, hand-drawn images, or pre-rendered 3D geometry. Usually, these textures are created and aligned in 6 directions, with viewing angles of 90 degrees (which covers up the 6 faces of the cube).

==Advanced skyboxes==

Simple texture-based skyboxes had severe disadvantages. They could not be animated, and all objects would appear equally distant at infinity. They looked simple and because of certain limits, it was hard for designers to be creative with this feature. But starting in the late 1990s, some game designers built small amounts of 3D geometry to appear in the skybox to create a better illusion of depth, in addition to a traditional skybox for objects very far away. This constructed skybox was placed in an unreachable location, typically outside the bounds of the playable portion of the level, to prevent players from touching the skybox.

In older versions of this technology, such as the ones presented in the game &quot;Unreal&quot;, this was limited to movements in the sky, such as the movements of clouds. Elements could be changed from level to level, such as the positions of stellar objects, or the color of the sky, giving the illusion of the gradual change from day to night. The skybox in this game would still appear to be infinitely far away, as the skybox, although containing 3D geometry, did not move the viewing point along with the player movement through the level.

Newer engines, such as the Source engine, continue on this idea, allowing the skybox to move along with the player, although at a different speed. Because depth is perceived on the compared movement of objects, making the skybox move slower than the level causes the skybox to appear far away, but not infinitely so. It is also possible, but not required, to include 3D geometry which will surround the accessible playing environment, such as unreachable buildings or mountains. They are designed and modeled at a smaller scale, typically 1/16th, then rendered by the engine to appear much larger. This results in fewer CPU requirements than if they were rendered in full size. The effect is referred to as a &quot;3D skybox&quot;.

In the game &quot;Half-Life 2&quot;, this effect was extensively used in showing The Citadel, a huge structure in the center of City 17. In the closing chapters of the game, the player travels through the city towards the Citadel, the skybox effect making it grow larger and larger progressively with the player movement, completely appearing to be a part of the level. As the player reaches the base of the Citadel, it is broken into two pieces. A small lower section is a part of the main map, while the upper section is in the 3D skybox. The two sections are seamlessly blended together to appear as a single structure.

<text>Dyea ( ) is a ghost town in the U.S. state of Alaska. A few people live on individual small homesteads in the valley; however, it is largely abandoned. It is located at the convergence of the Taiya River and Taiya Inlet on the south side of the Chilkoot Pass within the limits of the Municipality of Skagway Borough, Alaska.

During the Klondike Gold Rush, prospectors disembarked at its port and used the Chilkoot Trail, a Tlingit trade route over the Coast Mountains, to begin their journey to the gold fields around Dawson City, Yukon, about away. Confidence man and crime boss Soapy Smith, famous for his underworld control of the town of Skagway in 1897–1898 may have had control of Dyea as well.

The port at Dyea had shallow water, and neighboring Skagway had deep water. Dyea was abandoned when the White Pass and Yukon Route railroad chose the White Pass Trail (instead of the alternative Chilkoot Trail), which began at Skagway, for its route.

Use of the name Dyea for its present location first occurred in 1886, when John J. Healy (1840–1908) and Edgar Wilson (1842–1895) opened their trading post there. Previously, only a small hunting and fishing cabin had existed at the location. Before 1886, Dyea or Dei-yi (phonetic spelling) had been the second half of the name Jilḵoot Dei-yi [Chilkoot-owned Trail]. Prior publications state that Dyea was derived from the words for “to pack” [&quot;yaa&quot;] or “carrying place” [&quot;yaa yé&quot;]. However, the presence of the initial \d\ sound in Dyea casts doubt on those latter possibilities and suggests that the first syllable was in fact dei (as in dei-yi).

Chilkoot Trail and Dyea Site is a U.S. National Historic Landmark.

Dyea is now within the Klondike Gold Rush National Historical Park. All that remains are a number of foundations surrounded by scraps of lumber and metal, three cemeteries, including one where almost every person buried died on the same date in 1898 in an avalanche on the gold rush trail, and the ruins of the wharf. Visitors can usually spot brown bears, black bears, and eagles. Brown bears tend to use the Dyea inlets to feed during salmon spawning season (July–August).


==Demographics==

Dyea appeared one time on the U.S. Census in 1900 as an unincorporated village. It has since been annexed into the city of Skagway.

<doc id="912454" wikidata="Q963362" url="?curid=912454" title="Philip Murray">
<text>Philip Murray (May 25, 1886 – November 9, 1952) was a Scottish-born steelworker and an American labor leader. He was the first president of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC), the first president of the United Steelworkers of America (USWA), and the longest-serving president of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).

==Early life==
Murray was born in Blantyre, Scotland, in 1886. His father, William Murray, was a Catholic coal miner and union leader who emigrated from Ireland to Scotland prior to his son&#x27;s birth. His mother, the former Rose Layden, was a cotton mill weaver. Rose died when Philip was only two years old. William Murray remarried and had eight more children. Philip was the oldest boy, and after only a few years of public education, he went to work in the coal mines at 10 to help support the family.

In 1902, Philip and his father emigrated to the United States. They settled in the Pittsburgh region and obtained jobs as coal miners. Young Philip was paid for each ton of coal that he mined. By the following year, they had saved enough money to bring the rest of the family to America.

==UMWA==
Murray was working in a coal mine in 1904 when he became involved in the United Mine Workers of America (UMWA). Feeling that a manager had purposefully altered and lowered the weight of the coal he had mined, Murray punched the man and was fired. The other coal miners went on strike to demand his reinstatement. In response, the company threw Murray&#x27;s family out of their company-owned home. Murray was shocked and angered by the company&#x27;s actions. Convinced that unions were the only means workers had of protecting their interests, Murray became an avid and lifelong unionist.

In 1905, Murray was elected president of the UMWA local in the Pittsburgh area town of Horning, Pennsylvania. Determined to become the best local president he could, he enrolled in an 18-month correspondence course in mathematics and science. Although he had little formal education, he completed the course in just 6 months.

Murray married Elizabeth Lavery (the daughter of a miner killed in a mine accident) on September 7, 1910. They adopted a son.

In 1911, Murray became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

Murray, who favored co-operation with management rather than militancy, came to the attention of UMWA President John P. White. After White won the UMWA presidency in 1912, he appointed Murray to a vacant seat on the UMWA executive board. White then backed Murray in 1916 when Murray ran for president of UMWA District 5.

Despite his relative conservatism, however, Murray became a close associate of John L. Lewis. He supported Lewis&#x27;s bid to become a UMWA vice president in 1917, and UMWA president in 1920. In return, Lewis appointed Murray to the position of vice president. Murray became a strong supporter of and assistant to Lewis. Lewis handled relations with employers and politicians, and Murray handled relationships with UMWA members.

Murray strongly supported America&#x27;s entry into World War I and worked closely with government officials and employers to ensure that labor cooperated in the war effort. President Woodrow Wilson appointed him to the Pennsylvania regional panel of the National War Labor Board and the National Bituminous Coal Production Committee.

In the 1930s, Murray continued to serve on government committees. When General Hugh S. Johnson formed the Labor and Industrial Advisory Board in 1933 to implement Section 7(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, Murray agreed to serve on the new body. He played a key role in writing the &quot;Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935&quot; (also known as the Guffey-Snyder Act), later struck down by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Carter v. Carter Coal Co.&quot;

==SWOC==
Murray was active both in the CIO and in SWOC, the steelworkers&#x27; organizing project.

When the American Federation of Labor ejected the unions that composed the Committee for Industrial Organization (CIO) in 1936, Murray supported Lewis&#x27;s decision to form a new labor organization and was named a vice president in the new CIO. When the Steel Workers Organizing Committee (SWOC) was formed in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on June 7, 1936, Lewis named Murray its chair. Murray oversaw a $500,000 budget and 36 (eventually 200) organizers.

Under Murray, SWOC made a dramatic breakthrough when, on March 2, 1937, it signed a collective bargaining agreement with US Steel. SWOC infiltrated the employer&#x27;s company unions and turned them against the company, foregoing a traditional organizing campaign.
Murray and SWOC suffered their first defeat when SWOC attempted to organize workers laboring for &quot;Little Steel:&quot; Republic Steel, Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, National Steel, Inland Steel and American Rolling Mills. Employers used violence, espionage, and many strikebreakers to defeat the organizing drive.

Murray was elected second vice president of the CIO at its first formal convention in November 1938.

Organizing slowed after the initial burst of success at US Steel. By 1939, SWOC was in debt by $2.5 million. Little Steel continued to strongly resist unionization, and SWOC made few inroads at mills in the Deep South.

==CIO==

When Lewis retired as CIO president in 1940, Murray was elected president as his successor. The CIO absorbed a large amount of UMWA&#x27;s dues at a time when the ongoing Great Depression and employer resistance had stalled the influx of new members. Lewis soon broke with Franklin D. Roosevelt, over the need for war with Germany and Japan and with his CIO colleagues over the need for government protection, as embodied by the National Labor Relations Act. Lewis endorsed Wendell Willkie for president just 11 days before the 1940 presidential election and secured union members&#x27; support for Willkie by threatening to resign as CIO president if union members did not follow him. Despite a Lewis draft at the CIO convention two weeks after the November election, Sidney Hillman and other CIO leaders pushed for a Murray candidacy. Although Murray had supported Roosevelt in the election, Lewis placed Murray&#x27;s name into nomination himself. Murray was elected president of the CIO on November 22, 1940.

===Formation of USWA===
Little Steel capitulated to SWOC in the spring of 1941. Walkouts involving tens of thousands of workers and adverse court rulings led to elections at Bethlehem Steel, Youngstown Sheet and Tube, and Inland Steel, and huge majorities voted for the union. Republic Steel quietly signed contracts soon thereafter. SWOC soon had more members than the United Mine Workers, further alienating Murray and Lewis.

The victories at Little Steel led Murray to transform SWOC into a real union. SWOC was disbanded at a convention held in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 22, 1942. A new organization, the United Steel Workers of America (USWA), was founded. Murray was USWA&#x27;s first president. David J. McDonald, Murray&#x27;s long-time aide at SWOC, became the number two man at SWOC, often running the union&#x27;s day-to-day business. Together, they ran the union in a highly centralized manner that was not very democratic. All dues flowed to the national office in Pittsburgh, and the right to negotiate contracts and conduct job actions was strictly controlled. Such actions were justified, Murray argued, in light of the vigorous resistance to the union displayed by steelmakers.

===Reform of CIO===
Murray took over as president of the CIO, he found the federation in deep financial and organizational distress. He quickly instituted a series of reforms to stabilize it. He collected back dues from members and unions alike, reined in expenses, shuttered or cut off marginal organizing projects and unions, pulled organizers out of unions (who acted more like service representatives than organizers), and slowly ended the organization&#x27;s dependence on subsidies from the Mine Workers. By November 1941, the CIO had a budget surplus. In late 1941, Lewis submitted a &quot;bill&quot; to the CIO demanding repayment for its five years of subsidies and began speaking to Murray only through intermediaries. The relationship between the two former friends soured quickly. When Murray transformed SWOC into USWA and installed himself as president, Lewis retaliated. On May 25, 1942, he forced the UMWA executive board to remove Murray as vice president and strip him of his union membership.

===World War II===

Murray strongly supported the Roosevelt administration and the war effort during World War II. He quickly adopted a &quot;no strike pledge&quot; on behalf of all CIO unions, and supported (with Walter Reuther) the establishment of industry union councils to promote increased production, quicker retooling, and overcoming design problems.

To help overcome racial tensions in war plants, Murray established the CIO Committee to Abolish Racial Discrimination (CARD). CARD quickly undertook a discrimination-awareness education program, which proved somewhat effective, at least outside the South. In 1943, Murray advocated making the Fair Employment Practice Committee a permanent government agency.

Murray also served on the National Defense Mediation Board and a number of other government agencies to help promote the war effort.

===Post-war strikes and Taft–Hartley===

In 1945, he attended the World Trade Union Conference in London alongside many renowned trade unionists.

Murray lead the Steelworkers out on strike in 1946. Employers said that they were unable to meet the union&#x27;s wage demands under existing federal wage and price controls. US President Harry Truman established a fact-finding board to craft a settlement, eventually approving the price increases sought by business in order to finance the wage increases. The strike, which began in mid-January, was over within a month.

Murray had another fight on his hands in 1947 when the Congress enacted the Taft–Hartley Act over Truman&#x27;s veto. In July 1943, Murray had established a permanent political action committee (PAC) within the CIO, the CIO-PAC, the first-ever PAC in the United States. The CIO&#x27;s political efforts were only marginally effective. The Republican Party successfully passed the Taft–Hartley Act despite the vigorous opposition of Murray and the CIO.

After the act passed, Murray and the CIO were indicted for violating section 304 of the act, which forbade the expenditure of union funds in federal political campaigns. The CIO had endorsed a candidate for Congress in Maryland, and the US Department of Justice prosecuted Murray and the CIO for advertising the fact on the front page of &quot;The CIO News&quot;. In &quot;United States v. Congress of Industrial Organizations&quot;, the Supreme Court overturned the indictment and found that the publicizing endorsements was not an &quot;expenditure&quot; under the act. Representing Murray was Lee Pressman.

Murray also refused to sign the required anticommunist affidavit on the grounds that it was demeaning. Nevertheless, Murray was no radical, and he aggressively purged the CIO of 11 left-leaning unions in 1949 and 1950. In the 1948 presidential election, Murray refused to support former Vice-President Henry A. Wallace&#x27;s third-party candidacy and accused Wallace and his Progressive Party of being supported and influenced by communists. Instead, both Murray and the CIO supported Truman and the Democratic Party.

Murray led the USWA through a second successful strike in 1949. Now, the issue was whether employers should bear the entire cost of workers&#x27; health benefits and pensions. Once more, the union and the employers sought the assistance of a federal factfinding board, but the board&#x27;s recommendations did not prevent a strike from beginning on October 1, 1949 and lasting 31 days. Murray won a doubling of the pension benefit, with the employer continuing to pick up the entire cost. The USWA, meanwhile, agreed to pick up only half the cost of a new health and insurance benefit.

===1952 steel seizures===
In 1952, Murray led the USWA in its most famous strike. National wage controls had been reimposed to keep inflation in check during the Korean War. In November 1951, USWA negotiators asked US Steel for a large 30-cent wage increase, improvement in fringe benefits, and a closed shop. The company responded that it could not agree without prior government approval of commensurate price increases.

Truman referred the dispute to the federal Wage Stabilization Board (WSB). Murray agreed to delay a planned January 1, 1952 walkout until the Board had made its recommendation. In March, the WSB recommended a 16.5 cent wage increase. US Steel and other steelmakers lobbied Congress, the Pentagon and the defense industry heavily, opposing any wage hike.

Congress threatened to overturn any Board agreement, but Truman refused to invoke the Taft–Hartley Act&#x27;s cooling-off provisions or seek an injunction against the Steelworkers.

Instead, on April 8, 1952, President Truman nationalized the American steel industry.

The steelmakers sought an injunction preventing the seizure. After a preliminary hearing went in the government&#x27;s favor, a federal district court judge enjoined the President from seizing the steel mills. The full Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, sitting &quot;en banc&quot;, granted a stay of the injunction pending a decision by the Supreme Court to hear the case. A meeting between USWA and the steelmakers at the White House on May 3 nearly ended in agreement on a tentative contract, but the Supreme Court accepted the case and so the steelmakers backed out of the pact. On June 2, 1952, Justice Hugo Black, writing for a 6-3 majority in &quot;Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer&quot;, ruled that the president lacked the authority to seize the steel mills.

The government returned the mills to their owners hours later, and the Steelworkers went on strike for 51 days. The CIO, lacking a strike fund, was unable to help the Steelworkers. J
Lewis triumphantly offered the union a $10 million line of credit, which humiliated Murray. Steel supplies finally began to dwindle, and Murray feared the public opinion might turn against the union for impeding the war effort. Truman began preparations to draft the steelworkers into the military under the provisions of Section 18 of the Selective Service Act of 1948, further weakening Murray&#x27;s resolve to see the strike through.

An agreement was reached on July 24, 1952. The Steelworkers achieved only a limited version of the closed shop. Wages and benefits rose but not as much as the WSB had recommended, but Murray and others considered the strike a terrific win. They had avoided the crippling imposition of a Taft–Hartley injunction and its fines, and Truman had gone to significant lengths to support the union.

==Death==
Murray was unable to savor his victory. In the November presidential election, Dwight D. Eisenhower won the presidential election, and Republicans swept to majorities in both houses of Congress. It was another defeat for the CIO-PAC.

Murray died in San Francisco on November 9, 1952, of a heart attack. Reuther succeeded him as president of the CIO. McDonald succeeded him as president of the Steelworkers.

He is buried in Saint Anne&#x27;s Cemetery, in the south suburbs of Pittsburgh (Castle Shannon, PA).

==Other roles and publications==
Murray was a civic-minded individual who participated on a wide number of nonprofit organizations. From 1918 to his death, he was a member of the Pittsburgh Board of Education. He was a long-time member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and served on its executive committee. He also was a member of the board of directors of the American Red Cross.

Murray wrote one book in his lifetime: &quot;Organized Labor and Production&quot; was published in 1940.

<text>Wan Li (December 1916 – 15 July 2015) was a Chinese Communist revolutionary and politician who served as First Vice Premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China from 1983 to 1988 and the 5th Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress from 1988 to 1993.

Wan joined the Chinese Communist Party in 1936 and led revolutionary and wartime resistance activities in his native Shandong province. After the founding of the communist state in 1949, Wan served in a series of government ministries, then worked as a member of the municipal leadership in Beijing. He was purged during the Cultural Revolution, but was eventually rehabilitated and returned to work as party chief of Anhui province, where he led the implementation of successful agrarian reforms centered on the household-responsibility system. In the 1980s, Wan became one of the leading moderate reformers in China&#x27;s top leadership, advocating for constitutional reforms, the strengthening of legislative institutions, and the abolition of &#x27;lifelong-terms&#x27; of top political leaders. He was named head of the national legislature (i.e., the NPC) in 1988. He retired in 1993.

==Early life and education==

Wan was born to an impoverished family in Zhoucheng Subdistrict, Dongping County, Shandong province. Wan aspired to become educated from a young age, and was admitted to a provincial-run teacher&#x27;s college located in Qufu in 1939. After joining the school, Wan founded a book club to study Marxist–Leninist works. After the student-led December 9th Movement, revolutionary and anti-Japanese fervour spread across campuses all over China, motivating youth to take up the cause for the country&#x27;s future. Wan returned to his native Dongping County and became a part-time teacher while devoting most of his time to the revolution and agitating for resistance against Japanese invaders.

Wan Li joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1936, and served in party administrative positions, many in Shandong province, from county level on up. Wan led the party organization in his native Dongping County in between 1937 and 1938, Propaganda and Organization Department director in Taixi Prefecture in 1938–40, deputy head of propaganda for Western Shandong regional CCP committee in 1940, and Secretary of the party&#x27;s 2nd, 7th and 8th Prefectural Committees in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Area in 1940–47. In the last phases of the Civil War, Wan Li served as Secretary-General of the Border Area committee (1947–49).

==Early People&#x27;s Republic==
After the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, Wan was named deputy director of the finance department of the Nanjing Municipality Military Control Committee, director of the Economic Department and Chief of the city Construction Bureau, all within a few months. He served as deputy director of the CCP South-west Military and Administrative Committee&#x27;s Industrial Department (1949–52), where he would have encountered Deng Xiaoping, who was leading the southwest bureau at the time.

In 1952 Wan was transferred to begin work for the central authorities in Beijing. He shortly became the Vice Minister of Architectural Engineering (1953) followed by the post of Minister of Urban Construction (1955). From 1958, he was a secretary of the Beijing Municipality CCP Committee (under First Secretary Peng Zhen) and vice mayor; in 1959 he took a leading role in directing the construction of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in preparation for the 10th anniversary celebrations of the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. He used with blacksmith .

==Post-Cultural Revolution==
During the Cultural Revolution, like many of his contemporaries, Wan was purged and sent into solitary interrogation, and then took part in &quot;re-education through labour&quot;.

Wan was restored to his Beijing posts in May 1973. He was named Minister of Railways in January 1975 (to April 1976) and 1st Vice Minister of Light Industry in 1977. In May of the same year, he took over Anhui Province as CCP 1st Secretary (i.e., provincial party leader) and Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee (i.e., government).
In Anhui, Wan Li was responsible for the earliest post-Mao agrarian reform. He instituted the household-responsibility system whereby farmers divided communal lands and assigned them to individual farmers. Wan faced resistance from conservatives in Beijing who criticized his reforms as not sufficiently socialist or ineffective. Nevertheless, he pressed on with the reforms. His six guidelines (the &quot;Anhui liu tiao&quot;) relaxed controls on trading as well, permitting farmers to sell surplus produce independently. Peasants were allowed to grow vegetables on 3/10th of a &quot;mu&quot; and did not have to pay taxes on wheat and oil-bearing plants grown on private plots.

The Anhui agricultural reforms were heralded as brilliant innovations by the central government. The system implemented by Wan was followed up with reform programs led by Zhao Ziyang in Sichuan province. Along with Xi Zhongxun, Hu Yaobang, and other reformists in charge of implementing wide-ranging reforms, Wan was seen as a pioneer who made significant contributions to the national reform programmes in the 1980s, winning praise from paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. Wan Li was immortalised by the folk saying &quot;If you want to eat rice, look for Wan Li.&quot;

==National politics==
Wan was elected to the 11th Central Committee in 1977, and to the Central Committee Secretariat in February 1980, where he worked under General Secretary Hu Yaobang. In April he was made Vice Premier to fellow agrarian reformer Zhao Ziyang, and in August Wan was named Minister of the State Agricultural Commission. He was also made a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in September of that year.

Wan served as the chair of the Five Disciplines, Four Graces and Three Loves activity committee.

Wan Li became the Vice Premier in 1984 and the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 1988. Wan supported Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang in arguing to spread the household responsibility system nationwide in 1979–81. He also supported Zhao in curtailing the Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign in the mid-1980s.

After the January 1987 resignation of General Secretary Hu Yaobang, Wan Li was named to the interim &quot;five man group&quot;, which essentially acted as an interim Politburo Standing Committee. Wan was one of seven individuals shortlisted as candidates for formal entry into the supreme body, due for confirmation at the 13th National Congress of the party in the autumn of 1987. However, the appointment was opposed by party elder Bo Yibo and others conservatives such as Yao Yilin. According to Zhao Ziyang&#x27;s memoirs, Yao said that Wan had &quot;offended too many people&quot; and criticized Wan as &quot;the type to stir up trouble when things go wrong.&quot;

Deng heeded the conservatives&#x27; opposition to Wan entering the party&#x27;s foremost decision-making body, but instead suggested that Wan take on the office of the Chairman of the National People&#x27;s Congress. The legislative position, while not part of the party&#x27;s apex, was still a prestigious office that carried a full &#x27;national leader&#x27; rank. Wan initially was unsure about his taking up the office, telling Deng that he was not qualified enough since he did not have a background in law. Deng replied that Wan &quot;could always learn [on the job] and find people to assist him.&quot;

Wan was duly elected as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 1988, succeeding Peng Zhen. He maintained this position until he retired in 1993.

===1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre===
Wan was on an official visit to Canada and the United States during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. As Wan was seen as one of the representative figures of the CCP&#x27;s reformist wing, leading voices within the party&#x27;s top leadership, particularly retired elders, believed that Wan was sympathetic to the students and would rally behind Zhao Ziyang, the leading reformer in China&#x27;s top leadership.

On May 12, Wan Li left on a scheduled working visit to Canada and the United States. On May 13, the protests entered its hunger strike stage. Some of the protesters planned a demonstration to welcome him back to Beijing in late May. Moreover, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, which Wan chaired, had the constitutional power to convene the National People&#x27;s Congress in full session. Such an extraordinary session of the body was, legally speaking, the top authority of the state, and was seen by some scholars and political insiders as a constitutionally-sanctioned way to break the deadlock. Moreover, 57 members of the Standing Committee of the NPC had petitioned for a special convening of the body to resolve the Tiananmen crisis. On May 21, Deng met with then Shanghai party chief Jiang Zemin. In addition to hinting that Jiang was slated to &quot;take on a bigger role&quot; in the days ahead, Deng asked Jiang to discuss the ongoing situation with Wan Li to ensure the latter&#x27;s support for the decision to crack down.

Upon returning from his visit on the afternoon of May 25, Wan&#x27;s plane was diverted to Shanghai, where he was greeted by Jiang Zemin and others who tried to persuade him to take a stand against the student protests. While in Shanghai, Wan learned that his former ally Zhao Ziyang had already essentially been ousted from power, and that Deng and party elders had planned to use military force to put an end to the protests. Wan, fully aware that he did not have the military power nor personal clout necessary to fight the decision regardless of his &#x27;true&#x27; political leanings, expressed support for the leadership on May 27, and specifically endorsed the provisions for martial law announced by conservative figures Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun. Apart from asking his secretary to draft a memo clarifying his position, Wan did not make any further statements of support for the position of the leadership, suggesting that he may well have acquiesced to the decision rather than being earnestly in support of it.

==Retirement and death==

Wan Li gradually faded from public view after 1993, making occasional appearances but otherwise heeding his own view that retired politicians should not interfere with the workings of the party and state. Bo Yibo died on January 15, 2007, leaving Wan Li as the sole living pre-revolutionary party elder. Many historians have also classified Wan Li as one of the &quot;Eight Immortals&quot; of the Communist Party, i.e., elders with revolutionary experience who were called upon to make the most important decisions facing the Communist Party after Deng Xiaoping became paramount leader in 1978.

Wan Li died on 15 July 2015 in Beijing of an unspecified illness. In his official obituary, Wan Li was extolled as &quot;an excellent Party member, a time-tested fighter for the communist cause, and an outstanding proletarian revolutionary, statesman and leader of the Party and the state.&quot; It also said that Wan was &quot;loyal to the party, loyal to the people, and loyal to the socialist cause for his entire life [...]&quot; and that &quot;he observed party discipline and preserved party unity&quot;.

Wan&#x27;s official obituary numbered over 2,200 Chinese characters, half of the length of the obituary of second-generation stalwarts Deng Xiaoping and Chen Yun, but far higher than the word count of the obituaries of former leader Hua Guofeng, and one-time Politburo Standing Committee members Liu Huaqing, and Huang Ju, who were each given a mere few hundred words. The announcement of his death was the fifth item reported on the evening &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot; program; the announcement was made in the form of a &quot;joint statement&quot; by the top organs of the party and state, which is generally reserved for only the highest-ranked leaders.

On July 22, 2015, Wan&#x27;s memorial service was held at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. On that day, flags flown at half-mast at Tiananmen Square and at government buildings. President and Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and the entire Politburo Standing Committee, except for Yu Zhengsheng, attended the memorial service. Former Chinese President Hu Jintao also attended. He died just one month before former Secretary Wei Jianxing died on August 7, 2015.

<doc id="912465" wikidata="Q1416398" url="?curid=912465" title="Gap creationism">
<text>Gap creationism (also known as ruin-restoration creationism, restoration creationism, or &quot;the Gap Theory&quot;) is a form of old Earth creationism that posits that the six-&quot;yom&quot; creation period, as described in the Book of Genesis, involved six literal 24-hour days (light being &quot;day&quot; and dark &quot;night&quot; as God specified), but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, which the theory states explains many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth. It differs from day-age creationism, which posits that the &#x27;days&#x27; of creation were much longer periods (of thousands or millions of years), and from young Earth creationism, which although it agrees concerning the six literal 24-hour days of creation, does not posit any gap of time.

== History ==
From 1814, Thomas Chalmers popularized gap creationism; he attributed the concept to the 17th-century Dutch Arminian theologian Simon Episcopius. Chalmers wrote:
Chalmers became a divinity professor at the University of Edinburgh, founder of the Free Church of Scotland, and author of one of the &quot;Bridgewater Treatises&quot;. Other early proponents of gap creationism included Oxford University geology professor and fellow &quot;Bridgewater&quot; author William Buckland, Sharon Turner and Edward Hitchcock. The idea gained widespread attention when a &quot;second creative act&quot; was discussed prominently in the reference notes for Genesis in the influential 1917 Scofield Reference Bible.

In 1954, a few years before the re-emergence of young-Earth flood geology eclipsed gap creationism, influential evangelical theologian Bernard Ramm wrote in &quot;The Christian View of Science and Scripture&quot;:
Ramm&#x27;s book became influential in the formation of another alternative to gap creationism, that of progressive creationism, which found favour with more conservative members of the American Scientific Affiliation (a fellowship of scientists who are Christians), with the more modernist wing of that fellowship favouring theistic evolution.

Religious proponents of this form of creationism have included Oral Roberts, Cyrus I. Scofield, Harry Rimmer, Jimmy Swaggart, Perry Stone, G. H. Pember, L. Allen Higley, Arthur Pink, Peter Ruckman, Finis Jennings Dake, Chuck Missler, E. W. Bullinger, Charles Welch, Victor Paul Wierwille, Donald Grey Barnhouse, Herbert W. Armstrong, Garner Ted Armstrong, Michael Pearl and Clarence Larkin.

==Interpretation of Genesis==
Some gap creationists may believe that science has proven beyond reasonable doubt that the Earth is far older than can be accounted for by, for instance, adding up the ages of Biblical patriarchs as James Ussher famously attempted in the 17th century when he developed the Ussher chronology.

For some, the gap theory allows both the Genesis creation account and geological science to be inerrant in matters of scientific fact. Gap creationists believe that certain facts about the past and the age of the Earth have been omitted from the Genesis account; they hold that there was a gap of time in the biblical account that lasted an unknown number of years between a first creation in and a second creation (or restoration) in . By positing such an event, various observations in a wide range of fields, including the age of the Earth, the age of the universe, dinosaurs, fossils, ice cores, ice ages, and geological formations are allowed by adherents to have occurred as outlined by science without contradicting their literal belief in Genesis.

== Biblical support ==
Because there is no specific information given in Genesis concerning the proposed gap of time, other scriptures are used to support and explain what may have occurred during this period and to explain the specific linguistic reasoning behind this interpretation of the Hebrew text. A short list of examples is given below:

* The Masoretic Text contains a small mark at the end of Genesis 1:1, referred to as a &quot;rebhia&quot;, which acts as a &quot;disjunctive accent&quot;, indicating that the reader is to pause before proceeding to the next verse. It is one indication, among others, that the &quot;waw&quot; which introduces verse 2 should be translated &quot;but&quot; rather than &quot;and&quot;.
* The word &quot;was&quot; in for some adherents is more accurately translated &quot;became&quot;. Such a word choice makes the gap interpretation easier to see in modern English.
* God is perfect and everything He does is perfect, so a newly created Earth from the hand of God should not have been without form and void and shrouded in darkness. , 
* The Holy Spirit was &quot;renewing&quot; the face of the Earth as he hovered over the face of the waters, noting that the water-covered planet already existed. 
* Angels already existed in a state of grace when God &quot;laid the foundations of the Earth&quot;, so there had been at least one creative act of God before the six days of Genesis. 
* Satan and his angels caused the war in Heaven () and had fallen from grace () () &quot;in the beginning&quot; which, since the serpent tempted Adam and Eve, had to have occurred before the Fall of man. , ,

<doc id="912486" wikidata="Q1357250" url="?curid=912486" title="Jack Holt (actor)">
<text>Charles John Holt, Jr. (May 31, 1888 – January 18, 1951) was an American motion picture actor who was prominent in both silent and sound movies, particularly Westerns.

==Early life==
Holt was born in 1888 in the Fordham section of The Bronx, New York, the son of an Episcopal priest at St. James Church. When in Manhattan, he attended Trinity School. He was accepted into the Virginia Military Institute in 1909, but expelled for misbehavior in his second semester there.

Following Holt&#x27;s father&#x27;s death, the family moved to Manhattan, where Jack, his mother, and brother Marshall lived with his married sister, Frances.

Holt worked at various jobs, including construction of the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s tunnel under the Hudson River and being a &quot;surveyor, laborer, prospector, trapper, and stagecoach driver, among many other jobs&quot; during an almost six-year stay in Alaska.

== Military service ==
Holt was prevented from serving in World War I because of &quot;chronic foot problems&quot; from frostbite when he was in Alaska. On January 28, 1943, Holt reported for duty with the rank of captain in the Army Quartermaster Corps. He began training at Fort Francis E. Warren.

==Film career==

Holt began in Hollywood with stunt work and bit parts in serials and at Universal Pictures worked as a supporting player for Francis Ford and his brother John Ford, and Grace Cunard.

In his 1914 film debut, Holt rode a horse down a steep embankment into the Russian River in a scene for &quot;Salomy Jane&quot;. The stunt cracked some of Holt&#x27;s ribs and injured the horse so badly that it had to be destroyed. The film, which was considered lost for years, was included in the DVD released 2011 anthology &quot;Treasures 5 The West 1898—1938&quot; by the National Film Preservation Foundation after a print was discovered in Australia.

Holt appeared in three Frank Capra action dramas: &quot;Submarine&quot; (1928), &quot;Flight&quot; (1929) and &quot;Dirigible&quot; (1931). Holt&#x27;s characterizations were eclipsed by younger actors like James Cagney and Chester Morris, but still played leads. Two mid-1930s features, &quot;Whirlpool&quot; and &quot;The Defense Rests&quot;, starred Holt opposite up-and-coming ingenue Jean Arthur.

Exhibitors had come to associate Jack Holt with rough-and-tumble action, and so Holt continued to work in low-budget crime dramas (mostly for Columbia) through 1940. The series came to an end when he argued with studio chief Harry Cohn. Cohn thought the actor so arrogant that he assigned Holt the leading role in a lowbrow 15-chapter serial, &quot;Holt of the Secret Service&quot; (1941). Holt — the star of longest standing with the studio — was insulted by Cohn&#x27;s demotion; although he turned in a professional performance in the serial, he walked out on both Cohn and Columbia. 

Holt began freelancing at other studios, frequently appearing in outdoor and western fare. He would become an enduring member of the cowboy fraternity through &quot;Trail of Robin Hood&quot; (1950), a Roy Rogers western with guest appearances by Holt, Allan Lane, Tom Keene, Tom Tyler, Kermit Maynard, and Rex Allen.

Holt&#x27;s children established their own film careers. Tim Holt succeeded George O&#x27;Brien as the star of RKO Radio Pictures&#x27; &quot;B&quot; westerns, and co-starred with his father in &quot;The Treasure of the Sierra Madre&quot; (1948), with Jack as a grubby vagrant. Jennifer Holt played ingenues in low-budget features, mostly for Universal Pictures. The Holt family performed together on the &quot;Drifty&quot; episode of &quot;All Star Western Theater&quot; (KNX-CBS Pacific Network, 1946/47) as a father/son/daughter trio featuring a dramatic sketch and additional entertainment by Foy Willing and the Riders of the Purple Sage.

== Personal life ==
Holt married divorcee Margaret Wood in 1918. She obtained a divorce in Mexico in 1932 but, on January 9, 1940, a judge in Los Angeles ruled that the divorce was invalid. Her father, tycoon Henry Morton Stanley-Wood, disowned her because she married an actor; they later made up after her father lost most of his money in the Great Depression. She already had a daughter when she married Holt, and together they had a son, Charles John Holt III, and a daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Holt. Better known as Tim and Jennifer, respectively, both of them became actors in western films.
Holt was a lifetime member of the Society of Colonial Wars, admitted to the California Society on July 13, 1928.

==Death==

Holt died in 1951 of a heart attack, at age 62. He was interred at Los Angeles National Cemetery.

==Contribution==
Holt has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6313-½ Hollywood Blvd for his contribution to the motion picture industry. 

Margaret Mitchell, although having no say in the casting for &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; (1939), expressed her preference for Jack Holt as Rhett Butler, because her personal favorite, Charles Boyer, had a French accent.

<text>John Miller Murry (born 1979) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, composer and producer. He is from Tupelo, Mississippi, and currently lives in Drumlish, County Longford, Ireland.

His debut solo record, &quot;The Graceless Age&quot;, was issued on Evangeline Recording Co. in 2013 and listed by &quot;Uncut&quot; as one of the 10 best records of 2012. &quot;Mojo&quot; also included it in their 10 best albums of 2013; &quot;The Guardian&quot; included it in their Top 50 of 2013; and &quot;American Songwriter&quot; included it in their Top 5 of 2013.

Murry has recorded and toured with Memphis singer-songwriter Bob Frank. Murry often writes and collaborates with the San Francisco-based singer-songwriter, Chuck Prophet.

The follow-up to &quot;The Graceless Age&quot;, was recorded in Canada by Michael Timmins and was released by TV Records in Europe under exclusive license from Latent Recordings on July 14, 2017, and in February 2018 in North America by Latent Recordings.

2021 saw the release of &quot;The Stars are Gods Bullet Holes&quot; which charted at 22 in the U.K. indie album charts and No 6 in the U.K. Americana charts.

==Biography==
John Murry is the second cousin of William Faulkner through adoption, though a more direct relation hidden from Murry has been put forth by Robin Young of NPR and others.

He began singing at the age of five in church. At 12, he learned the Tom Petty song &quot;Free Fallin&quot;. He began playing in bands when he moved to Memphis, Tennessee, as a teenager.

Murry was a member of several bands in the early 2000s. His first appearance as a solo artist was on an album in collaboration with Bob Frank, &quot;World Without End&quot;, which was released on Bowstring Records in 2006. David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;all bullets, blades and guilt without end.&quot;

Murry moved to the Bay Area of California in 2004 and began performing solo work. He began recording with producer (and American Music Club drummer) Tim Mooney in 2005 and worked at San Francisco&#x27;s Closer Recording Studio, where he met Chuck Prophet. After several collaborative recordings with Bob Frank, Murry released his debut solo album, &quot;The Graceless Age&quot; in 2012, which was well received by &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;.

==&quot;The Graceless Age&quot; and critical reception==
Murry&#x27;s debut solo record, &quot;The Graceless Age&quot;, details his struggle with substance abuse. It was released in 2012 in the UK on Bucketfull of Brains, and in 2013 in the US and Australia on Evangeline Recording Co. and Spunk Records, respectively. It received critical acclaim from a number of magazines. It was featured in the September 2012 issue of &quot;Uncut&quot;; senior editor Allan Jones called it &quot;a masterpiece&quot; and gave it a 9/10 rating. &quot;Mojo&quot; gave the record a 5/5 star review, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &quot; a work of genius&quot;, also giving it 5/5 stars. NPR said the record&#x27;s &quot;deep rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll is alluring, emotional and infectious,&quot; while &quot;American Songwriter&quot; said it was filled with songs about &quot;drugs and near-death experiences&quot; that had &quot;standouts everywhere.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; magazine called it &quot;Intensely beautiful... Like Father John Misty, Mark Lanegan and Josh T Pearson rolled into one really broken dream.&quot; The record featured a song called &quot;Little Colored Balloons,&quot; chronicling Murry&#x27;s near-overdose from heroin, the video for which was directed by Chuck Mobley and premiered on Billboard.

==&quot;A Short History Of Decay&quot;==
Shortly after the release of &quot;The Graceless Age&quot;, Murry&#x27;s mentor Tim Mooney died suddenly and Murry eventually relocated to Ireland. &quot;A Short History Of Decay&quot; was released in July 2017 on Michael Timmins label, Latent Recordings, in Canada and on TV Records Ltd in Europe. Produced by Michael Timmins and recorded over a period of five days in Toronto, &quot;A Short History Of Decay&quot; featured Michael&#x27;s brother and fellow Cowboy Junkie Pete Timmins on drums, Josh Finlayson on bass with backing vocals by Cait O&#x27;Riordan. &quot;A Short History Of Decay&quot; has again received widespread critical acclaim. With glowing in reviews in &quot;Mojo&quot; (4/5), &quot;Q&quot; magazine (4/5), &quot;Uncut&quot; (8/10), &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; who named Murry &quot;Seer Of The Week&#x27;, &quot;Hotpress&quot; (9/10) and &quot;The Quietus&quot; observing &quot;There is more than a touch of Cave&#x27;s brooding darkness about Murry, whose rumbling voice and preoccupation with mortality place him in a genre somewhere between Mark Lanegan and Mark Linkous&quot;.

==Documentary: &quot;The Graceless Age: The Ballad of John Murry&quot;==
A documentary about Murry&#x27;s life (titled &quot;The Graceless Age: The Ballad of John Murry&quot;) is being released in 2023 by filmmaker Sarah Share and producer Nuala Cunningham. Additional producers: New Decade/Hawkeye/Irish Film Board .

<doc id="912491" wikidata="Q7191345" url="?curid=912491" title="Piebald (band)">
<text>Piebald is an American rock band. Piebald started as a hardcore punk band in Andover, Massachusetts, out of the same scene that produced Converge and Cave In. Originally a key Massachusetts post-hardcore band often seen touring with fellow DIY hardcore bands such as Jesuit, Reversal of Man, and Harvest during the mid to late 1990s, they later moved to the Boston suburb of Somerville and became a staple of the Greater Boston indie rock scene.

== History ==
Their first gig, a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, is chronicled on their two-CD set &quot;Barely Legal/All Ages&quot;. From the liner notes: &quot;... from the sound board 1994 battle of the bands, Piebald lost.&quot;

From then on, they recorded and played shows together semi-seriously. In 1995, Piebald started recording, which amounted to a four-track demo and a two-track split record. Their driving hardcore sound during these years was highlighted by the technical playing of drummer Jon Sullivan and the deep screams of vocalist/guitarist Travis Shettel.

=== Post-hardcore ===
A turning point in Piebald&#x27;s career came when they recorded seven tracks for a self-release that came to be known as &quot;Sometimes Friends Fight&quot;. Their musical sound had greatly matured, and Shettel&#x27;s lyricism and singing was finally brought to the forefront of the band&#x27;s music. Another two seven-inches later, Piebald was ready for another metamorphosis.

Eleven tracks recorded at Salad Days became the first record to showcase Piebald&#x27;s signature sound and wry jokes. Traditionally the most sought-after Piebald recording (before it was immortalized in its entirety on &quot;All Ages&quot;), &quot;When Life Hands You Lemons&quot; was considered to be Piebald&#x27;s best music yet. This release furthered the lyrical style that had been growing within the band, and also showcased the first lead vocals by lead guitarist Aaron Stuart, and a piano track by Shettel.

=== Breakthrough ===
Following &quot;If it Weren&#x27;t for Venetian Blinds, It Would Be Curtains for Us All&quot;, Piebald released &quot;We Are the Only Friends We Have&quot;. It featured the singles &quot;Just a Simple Plan&quot; and &quot;American Hearts&quot; which were played on MTV and college radio. 

The following album, &quot;All Ears, All Eyes, All the Time&quot;, the band&#x27;s first release on Side One Dummy Records, featured piano-driven compositions, along with horn arrangements and vocal harmonies. Music videos for the songs &quot;Part of Your Body is Made Out of Rock&quot; and &quot;I Haven&#x27;t Tried It&quot; were produced.

&quot;Accidental Gentlemen&quot;, their last album of original work, was released in 2007.

=== Retirement ===
On August 19, 2007, a bulletin was posted from the band&#x27;s official MySpace page as well as in the &quot;News&quot; section of their official website, announcing the dissolution of Piebald.
&quot;Friends, friends, friends…we have not posted anything anywhere in quite some time and our word on the street is that this is our last tour. All the preceding words are true and we have decided to put Piebald to rest. The past fifteen years or so have been nothing short of extremely incredible. We have met lots of people, been to lots of places and experienced a whole lot of life. In 1994 we started making music, screenprinting our own seven inch covers and borrowing our parents cars to get to shows. Since then, we have traveled the globe, released many records, and played thousands of shows; pedaling the righteous name of piebald to all whose paths we crossed. In celebration of the many years of good times and incredible accomplishments, we have decided to dedicate this tour to us; Piebald. Thanks to all who have helped in any and every way…families, friends, girlfriends, vans, bands, fans, promoters, labels, booking agent, lawyer, clubs, engineers, producers, and those who we forgot to mention. Now, this is not a teary eyed time, people. This is a time of new beginnings, positive vibes, and a congratulatory nod to the past. There has been talk of a few shows to give the band an official sendoff, but as of yet, those shows are not booked and unknown. Thanks for all the undying support. We love you.&quot;
The band played three final farewell shows in April 2008: April 17 at the Bowery Ballroom in New York City and April 18 and 19 at The Middle East nightclub in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Their final release is a live DVD / documentary called &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Robots: A Farewell to Piebald&quot;. It includes the entire farewell show in 5.1 surround sound, a retrospective documentary and an anthology of the band&#x27;s several music videos. Audio from the show is exclusively available through iTunes. The DVD was released nationwide July 13, 2010, on Sidehatch Entertainment Group.

=== Reunion ===
Piebald reunited for two shows at the Bamboozle music festivals in Anaheim, California, on March 28, 2010, and in East Rutherford, New Jersey, on May 2, 2010. Between these two shows, Rise Records released a three-volume set containing out-of-print releases from the band. The set contains material recorded and released by Piebald while signed with Big Wheel Recreation from 1999 to 2002. Each disc also includes various B-sides and rarities.

On March 22, 2016, Piebald was listed on the lineup for the Wrecking Ball festival on August 12–14 at The Masquerade in Atlanta, a final series of performances celebrating the soon-to-be-vacated legendary venue which prompted several retired bands to play one-off reunions. This was the first hint that Piebald might return for more shows; then, on April 6, 2016, Piebald announced an 11-show 2016 reunion tour, playing the Wrecking Ball along the way. This included east coast dates as well as 5 shows out west with their past tour buddies Limbeck, bringing them through San Francisco, Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Diego, and Phoenix.

Following this well-received string of shows, Piebald has toured at least once a year from 2017 through 2023.

On June 7, 2024, the band signed with Iodine Recordings.

Other significant reunion shows:

* May 28, 2017: Boston Calling 2017
* September 15, 2018: Riot Fest 2018 in Chicago
* June 4, 2022: Piebald played the main stage at Sticks and Stones Fest, the Worcester, MA stop on a tour to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Sticks and Stones&quot; by New Found Glory. Their set consisted of mostly songs from their 20-year-old album, &quot;We Are the Only Friends We Have&quot;.

=== Other projects ===
Since Piebald, Travis Shettel has performed in The Was, TS and The Past Haunts, and The Hunting Accident with Aaron Stuart.

<doc id="912493" wikidata="Q1090185" url="?curid=912493" title="John Middleton Murry">
<text>John Middleton Murry (6 August 1889 – 12 March 1957) was an English writer. He was a prolific author, producing more than 60 books and thousands of essays and reviews on literature, social issues, politics, and religion during his lifetime. A prominent critic, Murry is best remembered for his association with Katherine Mansfield, whom he married in 1918 as her second husband, for his friendship with D. H. Lawrence and T. S. Eliot, and for his friendship (and brief affair) with Frieda Lawrence. Following Mansfield&#x27;s death, Murry edited her work.

==Early life==
John Middleton Murry was born in Peckham, London, on 6 August 1889 to John Murry (1860/1–1947), a clerk in the Inland Revenue, and Emily Wheeler (1869/70–1951). John Murry, a self-made man from an &quot;impoverished and illiterate&quot; background, prioritized his son&#x27;s education. At the age of two, Murry was sent to the Roles Road Board School, and afterward attended the Bellendon Road Higher Grade Board School. His aunt, at the age of 11, called him a &quot;little old man&quot;. By 1893, his parents moved from Peckham to East Dulwich, along with his mother&#x27;s sister and mother, into a shared house. Beginning in 1901, Murry was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, where he received a scholarship. There, he and friends purchased a jellygraph machine for a newspaper he was the editor-in-chief of, and at 18 he became the editor of the school&#x27;s magazine. When he was 16 and at Christ&#x27;s Hospital, he was awarded the Charles Lamb medal for an essay entitled &quot;Literature and Journalism&quot;. He also attended Brasenose College, Oxford. There he met the writer Joyce Cary, a lifelong friend.

He met Katherine Mansfield at the end of 1911, through W. L. George. His intense relationship with her, her early death, and his subsequent allusions to it shaped both his later life and the attitudes (often hostile) of others to him. Leonard Woolf in his memoirs called Murry &quot;Pecksniffian&quot;. By 1933 his reputation &quot;had touched bottom&quot;, and Rayner Heppenstall&#x27;s short book of 1934, &quot;John Middleton Murry: A Study in Excellent Normality&quot;, could note that he was &quot;the best-hated man of letters in the country&quot;.

==Editor==
Murry was editor of the literary magazine &quot;Rhythm&quot; from 1911 to 1913, and then &quot;The Blue Review&quot;. In 1913 an associate, the publisher Charles Granville of Stephen Swift Ltd, was found guilty of embezzlement and bigamy, and imprisoned. Some debts had been put in Murry&#x27;s name, and their finances were seriously affected for the next six years. In 1914 he met D. H. Lawrence, and became an important supporter. The next year they started a short-lived magazine together, &quot;The Signature&quot;. In 1931, after a complex evolution of the relationship, Murry wrote in &quot;Son of Woman&quot; one of the first and most influential posthumous assessments of Lawrence as a man. Medically certified as unfit for military service, with pleurisy and possible tuberculosis, during the war years he was part of the Garsington circle of Ottoline Morrell.

In 1919, Murry became the editor of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, recently purchased by Arthur Rowntree. Under his editorship it was a literary review featuring work by T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, Clive Bell, and other members of the Bloomsbury Group. It lasted until 1921. It had enthusiastic support from E. M. Forster, who later wrote that &quot;Here at last was a paper that was a pleasure to read and an honour to write for, and which linked up literature and life&quot;. Its fate was to be merged into &quot;The Nation&quot;, which became &quot;The Nation and Athenaeum&quot;, in the period 1923 to 1930 edited by H. D. Henderson. In 1923 he became the founding editor of &quot;The Adelphi&quot; (&quot;The New Adelphi&quot;, 1927–30), in association with Jack Common and Max Plowman. The magazine continued in various forms until 1948. It reflected his successive interests in Lawrence, an unorthodox Marxism, pacifism, and a return to the land. According to David Goldie, Murry and the &quot;Adelphi&quot;, and Eliot and &quot;The Criterion&quot;, were in an important rivalry by the mid-1920s, with competing definitions of literature, based respectively on romanticism allied to liberalism and a subjective approach, and a form of classicism allied to traditionalism and a religious attitude. In this contest, Goldie says, Eliot emerged a clear victor in the sense that, in London during the 1930s, Eliot had taken the centre of the critical stage.

==Critic==
Murry reviewed for &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot; and then &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot;, from 1912. Initially he was much influenced by the philosophy of Henri Bergson, which he disavowed in 1913. He was one of an identified group of post-World War I critics that included Richard Aldington, Robert Graves, Aldous Huxley, Herbert Read, and Edgell Rickword. Murry gave Huxley an editorial job at &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;. Murry also helped encourage British interest in the work of Fyodor Dostoyevsky: his 1916 work &quot;Fyodor Dostoevsky: A Critical Study&quot; argued Dostoyevsky was an important novelist and philosophical thinker.

Murry led the charge against Georgian poetry. A leader in the 16 May 1919 edition of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot; was an early example of a reasoned attack against the Georgian style of verse; and Murry coupled this with an adversarial attitude to &quot;The London Mercury&quot; edited by J. C. Squire. He reviewed quite harshly Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;Counter-Attack&quot; in 1918, despite having helped him in 1917 to draft an anti-war piece for H. W. Massingham&#x27;s &quot;The Nation&quot;. In-house, however, he was not master enough to award an essay competition prize to the then-unknown Herbert Read, over the wishes of George Saintsbury and Robert Bridges, who preferred the poet William Orton.

F. R. Leavis admired and was influenced by Murry&#x27;s early criticism; later he criticised Murry in the pages of &quot;Scrutiny&quot;, but continued to acknowledge a debt to him late in life.

==On Romanticism==
Murry gave his philosophy its fullest expression in his writings on Keats and Shakespeare and in an ambitiously titled volume, &quot;God: An Introduction to the Science of Metabiology&quot;. There, picking up certain concepts from his acquaintance George Santayana, Murry describes the project of Romanticism as one of inner exploration:

:&quot;To discover that within myself which I *must obey, to gain some awareness of the law which operates in the organic world of the internal world, to feel this internal world as an organic whole working out its own destiny according to some secret vital principle, to know which acts and utterances are a liberation from obstacles and an accession of strength, to acknowledge secret loyalties which one cannot deny without impoverishment and starvation – this is to possess one&#x27;s soul indeed, and it is not easy either to do or to explain.&quot;

The upshot of this discovery results in the highest degree of ethical awareness, &quot;an immediate knowledge of what I am and may not do.&quot; The awareness of one being &quot;really alone&quot; in the universe, as he put it, marks the final point of discovery which is followed by the upward ascent to spiritual life.

Murry vividly narrates this exploration as a spiritual conversion (in his 1929 book &quot;GOD&quot;) —what he describes as a &quot;desolation&quot; followed by &quot;illumination&quot;—after the death of Katherine Mansfield (who had moved to G. I. Gurdjieff&#x27;s &quot;Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man&quot;, where she died).

==&quot;The Adelphi&quot;==
In 1930 Max Plowman joined Murry and Sir Richard Rees in developing &quot;The Adelphi&quot; as a socialist, and later pacifist, monthly; Murry had founded it in 1923 as a literary journal (&quot;The New Adelphi&quot;, 1927–30). Rees edited it from 1930; Plowman took on the role in 1938. &quot;The Adelphi&quot; was closely aligned with the Independent Labour Party; Jack Common worked for it as circulation promoter and assistant editor in the 1930s. Throughout this period, Murry&#x27;s then close friend and protégé, Guernsey-born G. B. Edwards, was a regular contributor to the magazine. Thanks to Murry&#x27;s support, Jonathan Cape commissioned Edwards to write a book on D.H. Lawrence but following Lawrence&#x27;s death it was never completed.

He moved to Norfolk; to South Acre; and then, with his third marriage in 1931, to the Old Rectory, Larling. Murry told Antony Alpers the biographer of Katherine Mansfield that K.M.&#x27;s manuscripts had all been &quot;dispersed to collectors&quot; in the 1930s. He had the manuscripts of nine or ten completed stories, and when an admirer wrote to ask if he would sell a manuscript, he would reply that some land adjoining his farm in Norfolk was on the market or that he needed a tractor, so would sell one for the amount he required.

Plowman co-founded (in 1934) and ran the Adelphi Centre. It was an early commune, based on a farm in Langham, Essex bought by Murry. Short-lived in its original conception, it ran a Summer School in August 1936 that was stellar: George Orwell spoke on &quot;An Outsider Sees the Distressed Areas&quot; on 4 August, with Rayner Heppenstall in the chair. Other speakers were Steve Shaw, Herbert Read, Grace Rogers, J. Hampden Jackson, N. A. Holdaway (a Marxist theorist and schoolmaster, and a director of the centre), Geoffrey Sainsbury, Reinhold Niebuhr, Karl Polanyi, John Strachey, Plowman and Common.

By 1937 the commune had collapsed, and the house, &#x27;The Oaks&#x27;, was turned over to some 60 Basque refugee children under the auspices of the Peace Pledge Union; they remained until 1939.

==Lodge Farm, Thelnetham==
In October 1942 Murry set up a new commune at Lodge Farm in the Suffolk village of Thelnetham. Murry purchased the farm and recruited fellow conscientious objectors to run the enterprise. The commune had mixed fortunes and it gradually reverted to a more conventional arrangement with Murry running the farm as a commercial enterprise. He wrote an account of his time at Lodge Farm in the book &quot;Community Farm&quot; which was published in 1953 and was illustrated by his brother, the artist Richard Murry.

==Political views==

===Marxist===
Murry had a Marxist phase in the early 1930s. With his third marriage in 1931, he moved within Norfolk, from South Acre to the Old Rectory, Larling, and wrote in two weeks his &quot;The Necessity of Communism&quot;. It was this identification as &quot;mystical Marxist&quot; that led Bert Trick (1889–1968) to introduce Dylan Thomas to Murry, in 1933. The occasion went well enough for Richard Rees to publish Thomas in the &quot;Adelphi&quot;.

He supported the small Independent Socialist Party, a regional breakaway from the Independent Labour Party.

===Pacifist===
Murry was an outspoken radical Christian and pacifist, writing &quot;The Necessity of Pacifism&quot; (1937). He was a Sponsor of the Peace Pledge Union, and editor of its weekly newspaper, &quot;Peace News&quot;, from 1940 to 1946.

Murry&#x27;s opinions during this period often provoked controversy. He angered many left-wingers (including George Orwell and Vera Brittain) by arguing that Nazi Germany should be allowed to retain control of mainland Europe. Murry believed even though Nazi rule was tyrannical, it was preferable to the horrors of total war. Murry later &quot;renounced his pacifism in 1948 and...urged a preventative war against the Soviet Union, ending his life as a Conservative voter&quot;. Finally Murry&#x27;s opposition to the Soviet Union was attacked by pro-Soviet elements in the peace movement.

Murry&#x27;s anti-feminism also drew criticism from feminist pacifists such as Brittain and Sybil Morrison.

===Christianity===
During this period Murry was widely known as a Christian intellectual. He had in fact considered ordination as an Anglican priest, but gave up on it after a diagnosis in 1938 of Buerger&#x27;s disease, coupled with doubts about his marriages (his third was then breaking up messily).

===Elitism===
His views converged with those of Eliot: he supported a type of elitism foreshadowed by Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s clerisy, and argued for by Matthew Arnold. In &quot;Christianity and Culture&quot;, Eliot partially supported Murry&#x27;s reasoning from &quot;The Price of Leadership&quot; (1939), though stopping short of the endorsement of Arnold. When Murry died, Eliot wrote to Mary that &#x27;a very warm affection existed between us&#x27;.

==Family==
Murry was married four times: first to Katherine Mansfield in 1918; after her death in 1923 he arranged the publishing or republishing of her works. In 1924 he married Violet Le Maistre, in 1932 Ada Elizabeth Cockbaine, and in 1954 Mary Gamble. With his second wife, Violet Le Maistre, he had two children: a daughter, Katherine Violet Middleton Murry who became a writer and published &quot;Beloved Quixote: The Unknown Life of John Middleton Murry&quot; in 1986, and a son, John Middleton Murry Jr., who became a writer under the names of Colin Murry and Richard Cowper. There were also two children from the third marriage.

==Depictions==

===In fiction===
Aldous Huxley portrayed him as &quot;Denis Burlap&quot; in &quot;Point Counter Point&quot; (1928). He was the model for Philip Surrogate in Graham Greene&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;It&#x27;s a Battlefield&quot;; Greene did not know him personally. David Holbrook wrote that Gudrun and Gerald in Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; were based on Mansfield and Murry. D. H. Lawrence satirised him in a number of short stories. In Lawrence&#x27;s novel &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Rod&quot; (1922), the title character is based on Murry. The relationship between Lilly and Aaron in the novel mirrors that of Lawrence and Murry.

===Dramatic portrayals===
Murry appears as a character in Amy Rosenthal&#x27;s D.H. Lawrence biodrama &quot;On the Rocks&quot;. In the 2008 Hampstead Theatre production Murry was played by Nick Caldecott with Ed Stoppard as Lawrence and Charlotte Emmerson as Mansfield.

In &quot;Priest of Love&quot; (1981), he is portrayed by Mike Gwilym. In &quot;Leave All Fair&quot; (1985), he is portrayed by John Gielgud as a sanctimonious exploiter of Mansfield&#x27;s memory who treated her poorly during their association.

<doc id="912495" wikidata="Q1346544" url="?curid=912495" title="Fall factor">
<text>In lead climbing using a dynamic rope, the fall factor (f) is the ratio of the height (&quot;h&quot;) a climber falls before the climber&#x27;s rope begins to stretch and the rope length (&quot;L&quot;) available to absorb the energy of the fall,

:formula_1

It is the main factor determining the violence of the forces acting on the climber and the gear.

As a numerical example, consider a fall of 20 feet that occurs with 10 feet of rope out (i.e., the climber has placed no protection and falls from 10 feet above the belayer to 10 feet below—a factor 2 fall). This fall produces far more force on the climber and the gear than if a similar 20 foot fall had occurred 100 feet above the belayer. In the latter case (a fall factor of 0.2), the rope acts like a bigger, longer rubber band, and its stretch more effectively cushions the fall.

== Sizes of fall factors ==

The smallest possible fall factor is zero. This occurs, for example, in top-rope a fall onto a rope with no slack. The rope stretches, so although &quot;h&quot;=0, there is a fall.

When climbing from the ground up, the maximum possible fall factor is 1, since any greater fall would mean that the climber hit the ground.

In multi-pitch climbing (and big wall climbing), or in any climb where a leader starts from a position on an exposed ledge well above the ground, a fall factor in lead climbing can be as high as 2. This can occur only when a lead climber who has placed no protection falls past the belayer (two times the distance of the rope length between them), or the anchor if the climber is solo climbing the route using a self-belay. As soon as the climber clips the rope into protection above the belay, the fall factor drops below 2.

In falls occurring on a via ferrata, fall factors can be much higher. This is possible because the length of rope between the harness and the carabiner is short and fixed, while the distance the climber can fall depends on the gaps between anchor points of the safety cable (i.e. the climber&#x27;s lanyard will fall down the safety cable until it reaches an anchor point); to mitigate this, via ferrata climbers can use energy absorbers.

== Derivation and impact force==

The impact force is defined as the maximum tension in the rope when a climber falls. We first state an equation for this quantity and describe its interpretation, and then show its derivation and how it can be put into a more convenient form.

===Equation for the impact force and its interpretation===

When modeling the rope as an undamped harmonic oscillator (HO) the impact force &quot;Fmax&quot; in the rope is given by:

:formula_2

where &quot;mg&quot; is the climber&#x27;s weight, &quot;h&quot; is the fall height and &quot;k&quot; is the spring constant of the portion of the rope that is in play.

We will see below that when varying the height of the fall while keeping the fall factor fixed, the quantity &quot;hk&quot; stays constant.

There are two factors of 2 involved in the interpretation of this equation. First, the maximum force on the top piece of protection is roughly 2&quot;Fmax&quot;, since the two sides of the rope around that piece both pull downward with force &quot;Fmax&quot; each.
Second, it may seem strange that even when &quot;h=0&quot;, we have &quot;Fmax&quot;=2&quot;mg&quot; (so that the maximum force on the top piece is approximately 4&quot;mg&quot;). This is because a factor-zero fall is the sudden weighting of a slack rope with weight &quot;mg&quot;. The climber falls, picking up speed as the earth pulls them downward and, simultaneously, the rope stretches and pulls upward on them. The climber starts slowing down when the upward force generated by the stretching rope equals the gravitational force &quot;mg&quot;. They then keep moving downward because of their momentum but now they are slowing down, not speeding up. Eventually they come to a stop and at that instant the rope is at maximum tension pulling upward on the climber by a force of &quot;2mg&quot;. Because this upward force by the rope is more than the weight &quot;mg&quot; downward, the climber then yo-yo&#x27;s up. The yo-yo&#x27;ing will eventually stop when the fall energy has all dissipated by frictional forces between (and within) the rope, the protection pieces and the harness.

===Derivation of the equation===

Conservation of energy at rope&#x27;s maximum elongation &quot;xmax&quot; gives

:formula_3

The maximum force on the climber is &quot;Fmax-mg&quot;. It is convenient to express things in terms of the elastic modulus &quot;E&quot; = &quot;k L/q&quot; which is a property of the material that the rope is constructed from. Here &quot;L&quot; is the rope&#x27;s length and &quot;q&quot; its cross-sectional area. Solution of the quadratic gives

:formula_4

Other than fixed properties of the system, this form of the equation shows that the impact force depends only on the fall factor.

Using the HO model to obtain the impact force of real climbing ropes as a function of fall height &quot;h&quot; and climber&#x27;s weight &quot;mg&quot;, one must know the experimental value for &quot;E&quot; of a given rope. However, rope manufacturers give only the rope’s impact force &quot;F0&quot; and its static and dynamic elongations that are measured under standard UIAA fall conditions: A fall height &quot;h0&quot; of 2 × 2.3 m with an available rope length &quot;L0&quot; = 2.6m leads to a fall factor &quot;f0&quot; = &quot;h0/L0&quot; = 1.77 and a fall velocity &quot;v0&quot; = (&quot;2gh0&quot;)1/2 = 9.5 m/s at the end of falling the distance &quot;h0&quot;. The mass &quot;m0&quot; used in the fall is 80 kg. Using these values to eliminate the unknown quantity &quot;E&quot; leads to an expression of the impact force as a function of arbitrary fall heights &quot;h&quot;, arbitrary fall factors &quot;f&quot;, and arbitrary gravity &quot;g&quot; of the form:

:formula_5

Note that keeping &quot;g&quot;0 from the derivation of &quot;Eq&quot; based on UIAA test into the above &quot;Fmax&quot; formula assures that the transformation will continue to be valid for different gravity fields, as over a slope making less than 90 degrees with the horizontal. This simple undamped harmonic oscillator model of a rope, however, does not correctly describe the entire fall process of real ropes. Accurate measurements on the behaviour of a climbing rope during the entire fall can be explained if the undamped harmonic oscillator is complemented by a non-linear term up to the maximum impact force, and then, near the maximum force in the rope, internal friction in the rope is added that ensures the rapid relaxation of the rope to its rest position.

===Effect of friction===

When the rope is clipped into several carabiners between the climber and the belayer, an additional type of friction occurs, the so-called dry friction between the rope and particularly the last clipped carabiner. &quot;Dry&quot; friction (i.e., a frictional force that is velocity-independent) leads to an effective rope length smaller than the available length &quot;L&quot; and thus increases the impact force.

<text>Post-hardcore is a punk rock music genre that maintains the aggression and intensity of hardcore punk but emphasizes a greater degree of creative expression. Like the term &quot;post-punk&quot;, the term &quot;post-hardcore&quot; has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. Initially taking inspiration from post-punk and noise rock, post-hardcore began in the 1980s with bands like Hüsker Dü and Minutemen. The genre expanded in the 1980s and 1990s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black, Jawbox, Quicksand, and Shellac that stuck closer to post-hardcore&#x27;s noise rock roots. Dischord Records became a major nexus of post-hardcore during this period.

The genre also began to incorporate more dense, complex, and atmospheric instrumentals with bands like Slint and Unwound, and also experienced some crossover from indie rock with bands like The Dismemberment Plan. In the early- and mid-2000s, achieved mainstream success with the popularity of bands like At the Drive-In, My Chemical Romance, Dance Gavin Dance, AFI, Underoath, Hawthorne Heights, Silverstein, the Used, Saosin, Alexisonfire, and Senses Fail. In the 2010s, bands like Sleeping with Sirens and Pierce the Veil achieved mainstream success under the post-hardcore label. Meanwhile, bands like Title Fight and La Dispute experienced underground popularity playing music that bore a closer resemblance to the post-hardcore bands of the 1980s and 1990s.

== Characteristics ==
Hardcore punk typically features very fast tempos, loud volume, and heavy bass levels, as well as a &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; ethic. Music database &quot;AllMusic&quot; stated &quot;These newer bands, termed post-hardcore, often found complex and dynamic ways of blowing off steam that generally went outside the strict hardcore realm of &#x27;loud fast rules&#x27;. Additionally, many of these bands&#x27; vocalists were just as likely to deliver their lyrics with a whispered croon as they were a maniacal yelp.&quot; AllMusic also claims that post-hardcore bands find creative ways to build and release tension rather than &quot;airing their dirty laundry in short, sharp, frenetic bursts&quot;. Jeff Terich of Treblezine stated, &quot;Instead of sticking to hardcore&#x27;s rigid constraints, these artists expanded beyond power chords and gang vocals, incorporating more creative outlets for punk rock energy.&quot;

British post-punk of the late 1970s and early 1980s has been seen as influential on the musical development of post-hardcore bands. As the genre progressed, some of these groups also experimented with a wide array of influences, including soul, dub, funk, jazz, and dance-punk. It has also been noted that since some post-hardcore bands included members that were rooted in the beginnings of hardcore punk, some of them were able to expand their sound as they became more skilled musicians. During the early 2000s it became common for mainstream &quot;melodic&quot; post-hardcore bands to crossover into other related genres like Melodic hardcore, Heavy hardcore, indie rock, screamo, and emo, straddling experimentation and accessibility.

== History ==
=== Origins (1980s) ===
Groups such as Minutemen, Naked Raygun, and The Effigies, which were active around the early 1980s, are considered to be forerunners to the post-hardcore genre. Naked Raygun&#x27;s Jeff Pezzati and Effigies frontman John Kezdy have disputed this classification, however, insisting that neither band was drawing from hardcore, and were instead influenced by British punk and post-punk acts like Buzzcocks, Sex Pistols, and the Stranglers. Los Angeles&#x27; Saccharine Trust mixed Minutemen&#x27;s sound with that of post-punk acts the Fall and Gang of Four on early releases like their EP &quot;Paganicons&quot;, helping to further the burgeoning genre.

During the early- to mid-1980s, the desire to experiment with hardcore&#x27;s basic template expanded to many musicians that had been associated with the genre or had strong roots in it. Many of these groups also took inspiration from the 1980s noise rock scene pioneered by Sonic Youth. Some bands signed to the independent label Homestead Records, including Squirrel Bait (as well as David Grubbs-related bands Bastro and Bitch Magnet) and Steve Albini&#x27;s Big Black (just as his subsequent projects Rapeman and Shellac) are also associated with post-hardcore. Big Black, which also featured former Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango, made themselves known for their strict DIY ethic, related to practices such as paying for their own recordings, booking their own shows, handling their own management and publicity, and remaining &quot;stubbornly independent at a time when many independent bands were eagerly reaching out for the major-label brass ring&quot;. The band&#x27;s music, punctuated by the use of a drum machine, has also been seen as influential to industrial rock, while Blush has also described the Albini-fronted project as &quot;an angst-ridden response to the rigid English post-punk of Gang of Four&quot;. After the issuing of the &quot;Il Duce&quot; single and between the release of their only two full-length studio albums, Big Black left Homestead for Touch and Go Records, which would later reissue not only their entire discography, but would also be responsible for the release of the complete works of Scratch Acid, an act from Austin, Texas described as post-hardcore, that, according to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;laid the groundwork for much of the distorted, grinding alternative punk rockers of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

According to Ryan Cooper of About.com and author Doyle Greene, 1980s hardcore punk band Black Flag is one of the pioneers of for the experimental style the band started playing later on in the 1980s. In 1984, Minneapolis punk band Hüsker Dü released their second studio album, &quot;Zen Arcade,&quot; considered a key post-hardcore record. Upon its release, the album received positive critical reception from &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Outside the United States, post-hardcore would take shape in the works of the Canadian group Nomeansno, related with Jello Biafra and his independently run label Alternative Tentacles, and that had been active since 1979. The magazine &quot;Dusted&quot; noted that the group&#x27;s 1989&#x27;s release &quot;Wrong&quot; was &quot;one of the most aggressive and powerful opuses in post-hardcore ever made&quot;.

==== The Washington D.C. scene ====
During the years 1984 and 1985 in the &quot;harDCore&quot; scene, a new movement had &quot;swept over&quot;. This movement was led by bands associated with the D.C. independent record label Dischord Records, home in the early 1980s to seminal hardcore bands such as Minor Threat, State of Alert, Void, and Government Issue. According to the Dischord website: &quot;The violence and nihilism that had become identified with punk rock, largely by the media, had begun to take hold in DC and many of the older punks suddenly found themselves repelled and discouraged by their hometown scene&quot;, leading to &quot;a time of redefinition&quot;. When The Faith put out the EP &quot;Subject to Change&quot; in 1983, it marked a critical evolution in the sound of D.C. hardcore and punk music in general. During these years, a new wave of bands started to form, these included Rites of Spring (which featured The Faith former guitarist Eddie Janney), Lunchmeat (later to become Soulside), Gray Matter, Mission Impossible, Dag Nasty and Embrace, the latter featuring former Minor Threat singer and Dischord co-founder Ian MacKaye and former members of The Faith. This movement has been since widely known as the &quot;Revolution Summer&quot;. Rites of Spring has been described as the band that &quot;more than led the change&quot;, challenging the &quot;macho posturing that had become so prevalent within the punk scene at that point&quot;, and &quot;more importantly&quot;, defying &quot;musical and stylistic rule&quot;. Journalist Steve Huey writes that while the band &quot;strayed from hardcore&#x27;s typically external concerns of the timenamely, social and political dissenttheir musical attack was no less blistering, and in fact a good deal more challenging and nuanced than the average three-chord speed-blur&quot;, a sound that, according to Huey, mapped out &quot;a new direction for hardcore that built on the innovations&quot; brought by Hüsker Dü&#x27;s &quot;Zen Arcade&quot;. Other bands have been perceived as taking inspiration from genres such as funk (as in the case of Beefeater) and 1960s pop (such as the example of Gray Matter).

According to Eric Grubbs, a nickname was developed for the new sound, with some considering it &quot;post-harDCore&quot;. Another name used for the scene was &quot;emo-core&quot;. The latter, mentioned in skateboarding magazine &quot;Thrasher&quot;, would come up in discussions around the D.C. area. While some of these bands have been considered contributors to the birth of emo, with Rites of Spring sometimes being named as the first or one of the earliest emo acts, musicians such as the band&#x27;s former frontman Guy Picciotto and MacKaye himself have voiced their opposition against the term. In the nearby state of Maryland, similar bands that are categorized now as post-hardcore would also emerge, these include Moss Icon and The Hated. The former&#x27;s music contained, according to Steve Huey, &quot;shifting dynamics, chiming guitar arpeggios, and screaming, crying vocal climaxes&quot;, which would prove to be influential to later musicians in spite of the band&#x27;s unstable existence. This group has also been considered one of the earliest emo acts.

The second half of the 1980s saw the formation of several bands in D.C., which included Shudder to Think, Jawbox, the Nation of Ulysses, and Fugazi, as well as Baltimore&#x27;s Lungfish. MacKaye described this period as the busiest that the Dischord Records label had ever seen. Most of these acts, along with earlier ones, would contribute to the 1989 compilation &quot;State of the Union&quot;, a release that documented the new sound of the late 1980s D.C. punk scene. Fugazi gained &quot;an extremely loyal and numerous global following&quot;, with reviewer Andy Kellman summarizing the band&#x27;s influence with the statement: &quot;To many, Fugazi meant as much to them as Bob Dylan did to their parents.&quot; It has also been noted that the group&#x27;s &quot;ever-evolving&quot; sound would signal a more experimental turn in hardcore that paved the way for later Dischord releases. The band, which included MacKaye, Picciotto, and former Rites of Spring drummer Brendan Canty along with bassist Joe Lally, issued in 1989 &quot;13 Songs&quot;, a compilation of their earlier self-titled and &quot;Margin Walker&quot; EPs, which is now considered a landmark album. Similarly, the band&#x27;s debut studio album, 1990&#x27;s &quot;Repeater&quot;, has also been &quot;generally&quot; regarded as a classic. The group also garnered recognition for their activism, cheaply priced shows and CDs, and their resistance to mainstream outlets. On the other hand, Jawbox had been influenced by &quot;the tradition of Chicago&#x27;s thriving early-&#x27;80s scene&quot;, while the Nation of Ulysses are &quot;best remembered for lifting the motor-mouthed revolutionary rhetoric of the MC5&quot; with the incorporation of &quot;elements of R&amp;B (as filtered through the MC5) and avant jazz&quot; combined with &quot;exciting, volatile live gigs&quot;, and being the inspiration for &quot;a new crop of bands both locally and abroad&quot;.

=== Expansion (late 1980s and 1990s) ===

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the formation and rise to prominence of several bands associated with earlier acts that not only included the examples of Fugazi and Shellac, but also Girls Against Boys (originally a side-project of Brendan Canty and Eli Janney, which would later incorporate members of Soulside), The Jesus Lizard (formed by ex-members of Scratch Acid), Quicksand (fronted by former Youth of Today and Gorilla Biscuits member Walter Schreifels), Rollins Band (led by former Black Flag singer Henry Rollins), Tar (which raised from the ashes of a hardcore outfit named Blatant Dissent), and Slint (containing members of Squirrel Bait). Acts such as Shellac and Louisville&#x27;s Slint have been considered influential to the development of the genre of math rock, with the former featuring &quot;awkward time signatures and trademark aggression&quot; that has come to characterize &quot;a certain slant&quot; on math rock, while the latter presented &quot;instrumental music seeped in dramatic tension but set to rigid systems of solid-structured guitar patterns and percussive repetition&quot;. According to reviewer Jason Arkeny, Slint&#x27;s &quot;deft, extremist manipulations of volume, tempo, and structure cast them as clear progenitors of the post-rock movement&quot;.


AllMusic has noted that younger bands &quot;flowered into post-hardcore after cutting their teeth in high school punk bands&quot;. In Washington D.C., new bands such as Hoover (as well as the related The Crownhate Ruin), Circus Lupus, Bluetip, and Smart Went Crazy were added to the Dischord roster. Hoover has been cited by journalist Charles Spano as a band that had &quot;a tremendous impact on post-hardcore music&quot;. In New York City, in addition to Quicksand, post-hardcore bands such as Helmet, Unsane, Chavez and Texas Is the Reason emerged. Chicago, which alongside the Midwestern United States has been important to the progression of math rock, also saw the birth of post-hardcore acts such as the examples of Shellac, Tar, Trenchmouth, and the Jade Tree-released group Cap&#x27;n Jazz (as well as the subsequent related project Joan of Arc, which also released their work through Jade Tree). Steve Huey argues that the release of Cap&#x27;n Jazz&#x27;s retrospective compilation album &quot;Analphabetapolothology&quot; helped spread the band&#x27;s influence &quot;far beyond their original audience&quot;, while also considering the group as influential for the development of emo in the independent music scene. Champaign, also in Illinois, was known for an independent scene that would give way to groups like Hum, Braid and Poster Children. The American Northwest saw the creation of acts such as Karp, Lync and Unwound, all hailing from the Olympia, Washington area. The latter&#x27;s music has been considered by critic John Bush to be a combination of &quot;the noise of Sonic Youth&#x27;s more raucous passages&quot; with a &quot;rare energetic flair which rivals even that of Fugazi&quot;. Texas saw the formation of groups such as The Jesus Lizard (later to be based in Chicago) and ...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead in Austin, and At the Drive-In from El Paso. This last band was known for their energy in both performances and music, and for their &quot;driving melodic punk riffs, meshed together with quieter interlocking note-picking&quot;. Kansas City, Missouri bands of the early 90s also contributed significantly to the genre including Season to Risk.

The genre also saw representation outside the United States in Refused who emerged from the Umeå, Sweden music scene. The band, which made itself known earlier in their career for its &quot;massive hardcore sound&quot;, released in 1998 &quot;The Shape of Punk to Come&quot;, an album that saw the group take inspiration from the Nation of Ulysses while incorporating elements such as &quot;ambient textures, jazz breakdowns&quot;, metal and electronica to their hardcore sound.

==== The San Diego scene ====

The early-to-mid 1990s would see the birth of several bands in the San Diego, California music scene, some of which would lead a post-hardcore movement associated with the independent label Gravity Records. This movement would eventually become known as the &quot;San Diego sound&quot;. Gravity was founded in 1991 by Matt Anderson, member of the band Heroin, as a means to release the music of his band and of other related San Diego groups, which also included Antioch Arrow and Clikatat Ikatowi. The label&#x27;s earlier releases are known for the definition of &quot;a new sound in hardcore rooted in tradition but boasting a chaotic sound that showcased a new approach&quot; to the genre. Heroin were known for being innovators of early 1990s hardcore and for making dynamic landscapes &quot;out of one minute blasts of noisy vitriol&quot;. These bands were influenced by acts like Fugazi and The Nation of Ulysses, while also helping propagate an offshoot of hardcore that &quot;grafted spastic intensity to willfully experimental dissonance and dynamics&quot;. This movement has been associated to the development of the subgenre of screamo, while it also should be noticed that this term has been, as with the case of emo, the subject of controversy. The label also featured releases by non-San Diego bands that included Mohinder (from Cupertino, California), Angel Hair and its subsequent related project The VSS (from Boulder, Colorado), groups that have also been associated with this sound. The VSS was known for their use of synthesizers &quot;vying with post-hardcore&#x27;s rabid atonality&quot;.

Outside the Gravity roster, another band that played an important role in the development of the &quot;San Diego sound&quot; was Drive Like Jehu. This group, founded by former members of Pitchfork, was known, according to Steve Huey, for their lengthy and multisectioned compositions based on the innovations brought by the releases on Dischord, incorporating elements such as &quot;odd time signatures played an important role on its development in spite of the band&#x27;s music not resembling the sound such term would later signify. In a similar manner, Swing Kids, composed of former members of hardcore bands from the San Diego scene such as Unbroken, Struggle and Spanakorzo, have been described by journalist Zach Baron as the moment in which the &quot;hardcore&quot; sound of bands like Unbroken effectively became &quot;post-hardcore&quot;, known for &quot;covering Joy Division songs&quot; and for its sonic &quot;jazz-quoting&quot; and &quot;guitar feedback&quot; experimentation features. They were also one of the first bands released under the independent label Three One G, founded by the band&#x27;s vocalist Justin Pearson and later known for releasing the works of several other post-hardcore, noise rock, mathcore and grindcore groups.

Bands like At the Drive-In have acknowledged the influence of the post-hardcore sound coming from the San Diego scene, with vocalist Cedric Bixler-Zavala citing elements such as &quot;screaming vocals with over-the-top emotions, calculated, heavy riffs, [...] offbeat rhythms&quot; and an &quot;incredible amount of energy, chaos and melody&quot; put by these groups as crucial in the development of his band&#x27;s sound.

==== Moderate popularity ====
According to Ian MacKaye, the sudden interest in underground and independent music brought by the success of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; attracted the attention of major labels towards the Dischord imprint and many of its bands. While the label rejected these offers, two Dischord acts, Jawbox and Shudder to Think, would sign deals with major labels. The former&#x27;s signing to Atlantic Records would alienate some of the band&#x27;s long-term fanbase, but it would also help with the development and recording of the 1994 release &quot;For Your Own Special Sweetheart&quot;, considered by Andy Kellman to be &quot;one of the best releases to come out of the fertile D.C. scene of the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s&quot;. The subsequent tour for the album and the MTV rotation of some videos would introduce the band to a handful of new crowds, but ultimately the album would remain &quot;unnoticed outside of the usual indie community&quot;.

Likewise, out of the Dischord label, Quicksand became the first post-hardcore act to sign a major label record deal (with Polydor Records) in 1992. Interscope Records would sign Helmet after a reportedly &quot;ferocious&quot; bidding war between several major record companies, and while MTV would air some videos by the group, which by the time of the release of their major-label debut &quot;Meantime&quot;, was considered then &quot;the only band close to the Seattle grunge sound&quot; on the American East Coast and would be hailed as &quot;the next big thing&quot;, these expectations would &quot;never be fully realized&quot; in spite of the record&#x27;s later influence. In another notable case, Hum was signed to RCA in 1994, selling approximately 250,000 copies of their album &quot;You&#x27;d Prefer an Astronaut&quot; fueled by the success of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Stars&quot;, and while the band had established by this point a strong underground fanbase, this would prove to be &quot;the pinnacle of Hum&#x27;s media attention&quot;, as its follow-up, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Downward Is Heavenward&quot; would sell poorly, resulting in the decision of RCA to drop the band from their roster.

=== 2000s (mainstream success) ===
Record producer Ross Robinson, who was credited for popularizing nu metal with bands like Korn, Slipknot, Soulfly and Limp Bizkit in the 1990s, helped post-hardcore achieve popularity during the 2000s. Mehan Jayasuriya of PopMatters suggested that Robinson&#x27;s sudden focus on post-hardcore was his &quot;pet project&quot; designed to redeem himself of &quot;the &#x27;Nu-Metal&#x27; scourge of the late &#x27;90s&quot;. Robinson recorded At the Drive-In&#x27;s &quot;Relationship of Command&quot; (2000), Glassjaw&#x27;s &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; (2000) and &quot;Worship and Tribute&quot; (2002), and the Blood Brothers&#x27; &quot;...Burn, Piano Island, Burn&quot; (2003); four albums that are said to &quot;stand as some of the best post-hardcore records produced&quot; during the 2000s. In John Franck&#x27;s review of &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Silence&quot; for Allmusic, he stated: &quot;Featuring extraordinary ambidextrous drummer Sammy Siegler (of Gorilla Biscuits/CIV fame), Glassjaw has paired up with producer/entrepreneur Ross Robinson (a key catalyst in the reinvention of the aggro rock sound) to take you on a pummeling ride that would make Bad Brains and Quicksand proud.&quot;

These bands allowed the genre to grow and become much more varied with At the Drive-In taking influence from art rock and rock and roll, and Glassjaw using elements of both pop music and heavy metal; furthermore, bands such as Hell Is for Heroes, Hundred Reasons, Hondo Maclean and Funeral for a Friend took significant influence from heavy metal bands like Pantera as well as hardcore bands like the Hope Conspiracy. Post-hardcore achieved mainstream success with the success of emo post-hardcore bands such as My Chemical Romance, Senses Fail, Alexisonfire, Taking Back Sunday, Brand New, Thrice, AFI, the Used, Silverstein, From First To Last, Thursday and Hawthorne Heights. Some bands also began to incorporate progressive elements; with bands such as Chiodos, Scary Kids Scaring Kids, Circa Survive, the Fall of Troy and Dance Gavin Dance gaining significant success, and bands such as Damiera, the Sound of Animals Fighting, The Bled, Norma Jean and the Chariot being left under the wood works; as well as bands taking influence from metalcore like Ice Nine Kills, Blessthefall and Pierce the Veil, inspired by acts such as Killswitch Engage, Avenged Sevenfold and Atreyu.

=== 2010s–present (continued underground popularity) ===
Beginning to form in the late 2000s, the fourth wave of emo came into full fruition in the early 2010s. Moment defining bands like Modern Baseball, the Hotelier and Joyce Manor all gained significant success in the underground, a new takes on post-hardcore became prominent with the sonic experimentation of Drug Church, Title Fight, The World Is a Beautiful Place &amp; I Am No Longer Afraid to Die and Citizen. At the same time &quot;the Wave&quot;, or &quot;new wave of post-hardcore&quot;, was a movement of bands reviving 1990s emo, screamo and post-hardcore sounds. The name was originally coined to refer to only Touché Amoré, La Dispute, Defeater, Pianos Become the Teeth and Make Do and Mend, however by 2014 had expanded to also include groups Balance and Composure, Into It. Over It. and Title Fight. In 2011 &quot;Alternative Press&quot; noted that La Dispute is &quot;at the forefront of a traditional-screamo revival&quot; for their critically acclaimed release &quot;Wildlife&quot;, while a 2014 article by &quot;Treble&quot; called Touché Amoré &quot;the one band carrying the sound forward in the most interesting ways&quot;. By 2015, many of the original acts in the movement had either gone on hiatus or entered periods of inactivity.

Later forms of post-hardcore have garnered more mainstream attention with bands such as Sleeping with Sirens, whose third album &quot;Feel&quot; (2013) debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200 chart, making it one of the highest charting post-hardcore album by any band to date. Pierce the Veil&#x27;s third album, &quot;Collide with the Sky&quot; (2012), has also received much attention. While &quot;Madness&quot; (2015) and &quot;Misadventures&quot; (2016)—by Sleeping with Sirens and Pierce the Veil respectively—incorporate more elements of pop rock and pop punk, entering territory that many find to be loosely defined as post-hardcore. Seen also is the emergence of independent post-hardcore bands like the Men, Cloud Nothings and METZ, who are moved closer to the dynamics and aesthetics of earlier acts, whilst diverging deeper into external influences. Reviewers have also noted the incorporation of a diversity of elements like krautrock, post-rock, sludge metal, shoegaze, power pop and no wave in addition to previous hardcore, noise rock and post-punk sensibilities.

<text>Princess Sophia of Gloucester (Sophia Matilda; 29 May 1773 – 29 November 1844) was a great-granddaughter of King George II of Great Britain and niece of King George III.

==Life==
Princess Sophia was born in Grosvenor Street, Mayfair. Her father was Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the third son of The Prince Frederick, Prince of Wales. Her mother, the Duchess of Gloucester, born Maria Walpole, was the illegitimate daughter of Sir Edward Walpole.

She was privately baptized in a drawing room at her parents&#x27; home in Mayfair, Gloucester House, on 26 June 1773, by Charles Moss, Bishop of St David&#x27;s. She had three godparents: The Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn, her paternal uncle; the Duchess of Cumberland and Strathearn, her aunt by marriage; and the Queen of Denmark and Norway, her paternal aunt, who was represented by a proxy. George III had been asked to stand as godfather, but he declined, upset by his brother&#x27;s marriage to Maria Walpole, a commoner.

Sophia was considered as a potential bride for her first cousin Prince William, Duke of Clarence and St Andrews (who later ruled as King William IV), but she expressed no enthusiasm for the match.

She lived at Gloucester Lodge on the Gloucester Road from about 1805 and remained there after her mother&#x27;s death in 1807, but by 1809 she had sold the villa to George Canning. She also lived at New Lodge in Winkfield, near Windsor in Berkshire.

In 1811, Sophia visited the Royal Yacht Squadron, at Northwood on the Isle of Wight with her brother the Duke of Gloucester: the Gloucester Hotel, by the Parade, was named in their honour.

From 1816, Sophia held the office of Ranger of Greenwich Park and had a home at the Ranger&#x27;s House, Blackheath.

Sophia was an early patron of the new seaside town of St Leonard&#x27;s on Sea, where she stayed at Gloucester Lodge on Quarry Hill in 1831. The building was formerly named the Castellated Villa, but was renamed in her honour.

Sophia died at the Ranger&#x27;s House, Blackheath, on 29 November 1844, unmarried. She was buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor.

**16 December 1834 – 29 November 1844: &quot;Her Royal Highness&quot; Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester

As a great-granddaughter in the male-line of George II, Sophia had the style of &quot;Highness&quot; from birth. On 22 July 1816, Sophia&#x27;s brother, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester, married their cousin Princess Mary, a daughter of George III. On their wedding day, the Prince Regent bestowed the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; on the Duke of Gloucester. The next day, Sophia was also bestowed with this style, giving her equal rank with her brother.

<text>Loriga () is a civil parish () and town in south-central part of the municipality of Seia, in central Portugal. Part of the district of Guarda, it is 20 km away from the city of Seia, 40 km away from Viseu, 80 km away from Guarda and 320 km from Lisbon, nestled in the Serra da Estrela mountain range. The population in 2011 was 1,053, in an area of 36.25 km2, including the two localities, the town of Loriga and the village of Fontão.

==History==

Loriga was founded along a column between ravines where today the historic centre exists. The site was ostensibly selected more than 2000 years ago, owing to its defensibility, the abundance of potable water and pasturelands, and lowlands that provided conditions to practice both hunting and gathering/agriculture.

When the Romans arrived in the region, the settlement was concentrated into two areas. The larger, older and principal agglomeration was situated in the area of the main church and &quot;Rua de Viriato&quot;, fortified with a wall and palisade. The second group, in the &quot;Bairro de São Ginês&quot;, were some small homes constructed on the rocky promintory, which were later appropriated by the Visigoths in order to construct a chapel. The 1st-century Roman road and two bridges (the second was destroyed in the 16th century after flooding in the Ribeira de Loriga) connected the outpost of &quot;Lorica&quot; to the rest of their Lusitanian province. The São Ginês&#x27; neighbourhood (&quot;São Gens&quot;), a local ex-libris, is the location of the chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo, an ancient Visigothic chapel.

===Middle Ages===
Loriga was the municipal seat since the 12th century, receiving Forals in 1136 (João Rhânia, master of the &quot;Terras de Loriga&quot; for over two decades, during the reign of Afonso Henriques), 1249 (during the reign of Afonso III), 1474 (under King Afonso V) and finally in 1514 (by King Manuel I).

Loriga was an ecclesiastical parish of the vicarage of the Royal Padroado and its Matriz Church was ordered to construct in 1233, by King Sancho II. This church, was to the invocation of &quot;Santa Maria Maior&quot;, and constructed over the ancient small Visigothic chapel (there is a lateral block with Visigoth inscriptions visible). Constructed in the Romanesque-style it consists of a three-nave building, with hints of the Old Cathedral of Coimbra. This structure was destroyed during the 1755 earthquake, and only portions of the lateral walls were preserved.

===Monarchy===
The 1755 earthquake resulted in significant damage to the town of Loriga, destroying homes and the parochial residence, in addition to opening-up cracks and faults in the town&#x27;s larger buildings, such as the historic municipal council hall (constructed in the 13th century). An emissary of the Marquess of Pombal visited Loriga to evaluate the damage (something that did not happen in other nearby biggest parishes, like Covilhã) and provide support.

The residents of Loriga supported the Asolutionist forces of the Infante Miguel of Portugal against the Liberals, during the Portuguese Liberal Wars.
It ceased to be the seat of a municipality in 1855 after the application of a territorial planning carried out during the 19th century, interestingly the same plan that gave rise to the Districts.

At the time of its municipal demise (October 1855), the municipality of Loriga included the parishes of Alvoco da Serra, Cabeça, Sazes da Beira, Teixeira, Valezim and Vide, as well as thirty other disincorporated villages.

Loriga was an industrial centre for textile manufacturing during the 19th century. It was one of the few industrialized centres of the region, even supplanting Seia until the middle of the 20th century. Only Covilhã out-performed Loriga in terms of businesses operating from its lands; companies such as Regato, Redondinha, Fonte dos Amores, Tapadas, Fândega, Leitão &amp; Irmãos, Augusto Luís Mendes, Lamas, Nunes Brito, Moura Cabral and Lorimalhas, among others.
The main roadway in Loriga, &quot;Avenida Augusto Luís Mendes&quot;, is named for one of the villages most illustrious industrialists. The wool industry started to decline during the last decades of the 20th century, a factor that aggravated and accelerated the decline of the region.

==Geography==

Known locally as the &quot;Portuguese Switzerland&quot; due to its landscape that includes a principal settlement nestled in the mountains of the Serra da Estrela Natural Park. It is located in the south-central part of the municipality of Seia, along the southeast part of the Serra, between several ravines, but specifically the Ribeira de São Bento and Ribeira da Nave; it is 20 kilometres from Seia, 80 kilometres from Guarda and 300 kilometres from the national capital (Lisbon). A main town is accessible by the national roadway E.N. 231, that connects directly to the region of the Serra da Estrela by way of E.N.338 (which was completed in 2006), or through the E.N.339, a 9.2 kilometre access that transits some of the main elevations (960 metres near Portela do Arão, and 1650 metres around the Lagoa Comprida).

The region is carved by U-shaped glacial valleys, modelled by the movement of ancient glaciers. The main valley, &quot;Vale de Loriga&quot; was carved by longitudinal abrasion that also created rounded pockets, where the glacial resistance was minor. Starting at an altitude of 1991 metres along the Serra da Estrela the valley descends abruptly until 290 metres above sea level (around Vide), passing villages such as Cabeça, Casal do Rei and Muro. The central town, Loriga, is seven kilometres from Torre (the highest point), but the parish is sculpted by cliffs, alluvial plains and glacial lakes deposited during millennia of glacial erosion, and surrounded by rare ancient forest that surrounded the lateral flanks of these glaciers.

==Economy==
Textiles are the principal local export; Loriga was a hub the textile and wool industries during the mid-19th century, in addition to being subsistence agriculture responsible for the cultivation of corn. The Loriguense economy is based on metallurgical industries, bread-making, commercial shops, restaurants and agricultural support services.

While that textile industry has since dissipated, the town began to attract a tourist trade due to its proximity to the Serra da Estrela and Vodafone Ski Resort (the only ski center in Portugal), which was constructed totally the parish limits.

<doc id="912533" wikidata="Q3077977" url="?curid=912533" title="Fort Ouiatenon">
<text>Fort Ouiatenon, built in 1717, was the first fortified European settlement in what is now Indiana, United States. It was a palisade stockade with log blockhouse used as a French trading post on the Wabash River located approximately three miles southwest of modern-day West Lafayette. The name &#x27;Ouiatenon&#x27; is a French rendering of the name in the Wea language, &quot;waayaahtanonki&quot;, meaning &#x27;place of the whirlpool&#x27;. It was one of three French forts built during the 18th century in what was then New France, later the Northwest Territory and today the state of Indiana, the other two being Fort Miami and Fort Vincennes. A substantial French settlement grew up around the fort in the mid-18th century. It was ceded to the British and abandoned after the French and Indian War. Later, it passed into Indian hands and was destroyed in 1791 by American militia during the Northwest Indian War. It was never a U.S. fort. The original site was rediscovered in the 1960s; the archaeological site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2021.

Every year between the end of September and the month of October, a reenactment of pioneer life called the Feast of the Hunters&#x27; Moon is held at a replica of the fort built a short distance from the original site.

==French period==
Fort Ouiatenon was originally constructed by the Government of New France as a military outpost to protect against Great Britain&#x27;s western expansion. Its location among the unsettled woodlands of the Wabash River valley also made it a key center of trade for fur trappers. French merchants and trappers from Quebec would arrive at Fort Ouiatenon in search of beaver pelts and to take advantage of trade relations with the native Wea Indian tribes.

In 1717, Ensign François Picote de Beletre (related to another Picoté de Bélestre, see Adam Dollard des Ormeaux) arrived at the mouth of the Tippecanoe and Wabash with four soldiers, three men, a blacksmith [Jean Richard, a son of Guillaume Richard dit Lafleur and Agnes Tessier] and supplies to trade with the nearby Wea people, an Algonquian-speaking nation closely related to the Miami people. They built a stockade on the Wabash, eighteen miles below the mouth of the Tippecanoe. François-Marie Bissot, the Sieur de Vincennes assumed command of the fort sometime in the 1720s. The French settled on the north bank, with Wea villages on the south bank. The boundary between the French colonies of Louisiana and Canada, although inexact in the first years of the settlement, was decreed in 1745 to run between Ouiatenon and Fort Vincennes.

In order to convince the Wea to trade exclusively with the French, the Governor-General of New France, Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil, issued permits for trade at Ouiatenon. Traders immediately began to bring a steady flow of goods to the new town. Soon the officials in Louisiana sent more men to help Vincennes to hold the Wabash River. Ouiatenon was described as &quot;the finest palisaded fort in the upper country,&quot; and was one of the most successful trading posts in the region. At its peak level of activity during the mid-18th century, Fort Ouiatenon may have supported over 3,000 residents, and it was central to a hub of five Wea and two Kickapoo villages.

==British period==
After the surrender of New France to the British in September 1760, Robert Rogers dispatched troops to occupy Ouiatenon. A contingent of British soldiers led by Lieutenant Edward Jenkins arrived in 1761, capturing and occupying the fort.

On June 1, 1763, during Pontiac&#x27;s War, the Wea, Kickapoo and Mascouten peoples captured Ouiatenon. They surprised Lieutenant Jenkins and his men and captured Fort Ouiatenon without firing a shot. Seven similar posts were also captured in the widespread Indian uprising against the British presence.

The British made little use of Fort Ouiatenon after the French and Indian War; it was never garrisoned. In the mid-1770s, the fort was described as 70 yards from the Wabash river.

The Ouiatenon nation of Indians is on the opposite side, &amp; the Kiccaposses are round the Fort, in both villages about 1000 men able to bear arms.

As late as 1778, Ouiatenon was a staging ground for war parties fighting on behalf of the British government.

==Indian period==
Captain Leonard Helm and Lt. Bailey arrived in 1778 to secure the fort for the rebelling Americans. A British Indian agent named Celeron controlled the fort and tried to evacuate, but was captured with a force of 40 men. A British company arrived and hoisted &quot;St. George&#x27;s Ensign&quot; in the fort by December of the same year. Shortly after the Americans captured Vincennes in 1779, Captain I. Shelby arrived in Ouiatenon and received promises of cooperation from the Wea.

During the 1780s, however, local Indian tribes used it as a base of operations in resistance against the westward expansion of white American settlers. Consequently, President George Washington ordered the fort to be destroyed in 1791. In an operation dubbed the &quot;Blackberry Campaign&quot;, Northwest Territory Governor Arthur St. Clair ordered General Charles Scott to attack villages along the Wabash River, with Ouiatenon as the primary target. Scott crossed the Ohio River in May 1791 and marched to the Ouiatenon area with 750 Kentucky militia. While Colonel John Hardin led a force to the Big Pine Creek to destroy a large Kickapoo village, Scott led the main force to Ouiatenon. The American Indians who were present evacuated, and Colonel James Wilkinson led a battalion of mounted militia down to the river to fire on escaping Indians. Ouiatenon was then burned to the ground, and the militia destroyed several other nearby villages, including the large village of Keth-tio-e-ca-muck near the mouth of the Tippecanoe River. 38 Native Americans had been killed, and another 58 were taken prisoner, mostly women and children. The Kentucky militia had no men killed, and only five wounded.

Ouiatenon was never again a site of historical significance.

==Twentieth century==
The ruins of the old fort were lost, and the land became a farm in the 20th century.

The site of Fort Ouiatenon was discovered and confirmed archaeologically in the late 1960s. The Ouiatenon Preserve is located about a mile west of the Fort Ouiatenon Historical Park along South River Road and the Wabash River. It contains the site of the original 1700s era Fort Ouiatenon and nearly 200 acres of land surrounding it. In 1970 the site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places by the U.S. Department of the Interior.

In 1930, a replica of Fort Ouiatenon was built by a local physician named Richard Wetherill. Since few useful records of the original structure exist, the replica is mostly confabulation. The Daughters of the American Revolution had placed a small commemorative marker near this spot in 1909. Dr. Wetherill&#x27;s blockhouse was actually patterned after those more typical of British fortifications (using horizontal logs) and does not match the style or type of construction of the original Fort Ouiatenon (with vertical logs). The replica blockhouse is now the focal point of Fort Ouiatenon Historical Park. Today, the Fort Ouiatenon Blockhouse Museum is open to tourists in the summer and is the location of the annual Feast of the Hunters&#x27; Moon. Many rare artifacts from the original Fort Ouiatenon are displayed by the Tippecanoe County Historical Association during the Feast.

<text>The Moodna Viaduct is a steel railroad trestle spanning Moodna Creek and its valley at the north end of Schunemunk Mountain in Cornwall, New York, near the hamlet of Salisbury Mills.

==Significance==
The bridge was constructed between 1906 and 1909 by the Erie Railroad as part of its Graham Line freight bypass, and was opened for service in January 1909. The trestle spans the valley for 3,200 feet (975 m) and is 193 feet (59 m) high at its highest point, making it the second-highest and -longest railroad trestle east of the Mississippi River (after the 1889 Poughkeepsie Bridge of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, which is long and high). Apart from the valley below, the viaduct crosses two roads (Otterkill Rd. and Orrs Mills Rd.), the Moodna Creek, and the Erie Railroad&#x27;s now-abandoned Newburgh Branch. The open design of the trestle was used to reduce wind resistance and is a major reason why the trestle is still in service today.

==Current use==
The viaduct carries New Jersey Transit/Metro-North Port Jervis commuter line trains and Norfolk Southern freight trains. The Metro-North Salisbury Mills–Cornwall station sits near the north end of the viaduct. In summer 2007, timber replacement on the viaduct caused delays on the line due to slow orders placed on it, and required that service be halted during weekend days. Repairs were made to several of the concrete piers in October 2009, but traffic remained uninterrupted.

It is also a tourist attraction for the small town of Salisbury Mills. Two major roads cross under it, the major one is Orange County Route 94. The viaduct creates a spectacular landscape when viewed from the corner of Orrs Mills Road and Jackson Avenue outside of town, frequently photographed during fall foliage season.

The Moodna Viaduct appears as a prominent feature in the 2007 film &quot;Michael Clayton&quot; and in the 2020 film &quot;The Half of It&quot;.

<doc id="912544" wikidata="Q1976374" url="?curid=912544" title="Princess Marie of Hanover">
<text>Princess Marie Ernestine Josephine Adolphine Henriette Therese Elisabeth Alexandrine of Hanover (2 December 1849 – 4 June 1904) was the younger daughter of King George V of Hanover and his wife, Marie of Saxe-Altenburg.

==Biography==

Marie was born in the city of Hanover. She held the title of Princess with the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; in the Kingdom of Hanover. In the United Kingdom, she held the title of Princess with the style &quot;Her Highness&quot; as a male line great-granddaughter of King George III.

In 1866 Marie&#x27;s father was deposed as king of Hanover. Marie and her mother remained in Hanover for over a year, residing at Schloss Marienburg, until they went into exile in Austria in July 1867. Eventually the family settled at Gmunden.

===Marriage prospects===
Marie visited England with her family in May 1876, and again, after her father&#x27;s death, in June 1878. Her sister Frederica moved to England where she married, but Marie returned to Gmunden where she remained single and lived with her mother at Schloss Cumberland (named after her father&#x27;s British ducal title). An American newspaper suggests that Marie twice turned down an offer of marriage from Queen Victoria&#x27;s third son the Duke of Connaught.

===Death===
Marie died at Gmunden at the age of 54. Her funeral was the day after her death since two days later her niece Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland was scheduled to marry Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Marie is buried in the family mausoleum at Schloss Cumberland next to her mother who outlived her by three years.

<text>Archaeological science consists of the application of scientific techniques to the analysis of archaeological materials and sites. It is related to methodologies of archaeology. Martinón-Torres and Killick distinguish ‘scientific archaeology’ (as an epistemology) from ‘archaeological science’ (the application of specific techniques to archaeological materials). Martinón-Torres and Killick claim that ‘archaeological science’ has promoted the development of high-level theory in archaeology. However, Smith rejects both concepts of archaeological science because neither emphasize falsification or a search for causality.

In the United Kingdom, the Natural and Environmental Research Council provides funding for archaeometry separate from the funding provided for archaeology.

== Types of archaeological science ==
Archaeological science can be divided into the following areas:
* physical and chemical dating methods which provide archaeologists with absolute and relative chronologies
* artifact studies
* environmental approaches which provide information on past landscapes, climates, flora, and fauna; as well as the diet, nutrition, health, and pathology of people
* mathematical methods for data treatment (including computer-based methods)
* remote-sensing and geophysical-survey techniques for buried features
* conservation sciences, involving the study of decay processes and the development of new methods of conservation

Techniques such as lithic analysis, archaeometallurgy, paleoethnobotany, palynology and zooarchaeology also form sub-disciplines of archaeological science.

=== Dating techniques ===
Archaeological science has particular value when it can provide absolute dates for archaeological strata and artifacts. Some of the most important dating techniques include:
* radiocarbon dating — especially for dating organic materials
* dendrochronology — for dating trees; also very important for calibrating radiocarbon dates
* thermoluminescence dating — for dating inorganic material (including ceramics)
* optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) — for absolutely dating and relatively profiling buried land-surfaces in vertical and horizontal stratigraphic sections, most often by measuring photons discharged from grains of quartz within sedimentary bodies (although this technique can also measure potassium feldspars, complications caused by internally induced dose-rates often favor the use of quartz-based analyzes in archaeological applications)
* electron spin resonance, as used (for example) in dating teeth
* potassium-argon dating — for dating (for example) fossilized hominid remains by association with volcanic sediments (the fossils themselves are not directly dated)

=== Artifact studies ===
Another important subdiscipline of archaeometry is the study of artifacts. Archaeometrists have used a variety of methods to analyze artifacts, either to determine more about their composition, or to determine their provenance. These techniques include:
* X-ray fluorescence (XRF)
* inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
* neutron activation analysis (NAA)
* scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
* laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS)

Lead, strontium and oxygen isotope analysis can also test human remains to estimate the diets and even the birthplaces of a study&#x27;s subjects.

Provenance analysis has the potential to determine the original source of the materials used, for example, to make a particular artifact. This can show how far the artifact has traveled and can indicate the existence of systems of exchange.

== Influence of archaeometry ==
Archaeometry has greatly influenced modern archaeology. Archaeologists can obtain significant additional data and information using these techniques, and archaeometry has the potential to revise the understanding of the past. For example, the &quot;second radiocarbon revolution&quot; significantly re-dated European prehistory in the 1960s, compared to the &quot;first radiocarbon revolution&quot; from 1949.

== Locating archaeological sites ==
Archaeometry is an important tool in finding potential dig sites. The use of remote sensing has enabled archaeologists to identify many more archaeological sites than they could have otherwise. The use of aerial photography (including satellite imagery and Lidar) remains the most widespread remote-sensing technique. Ground-based geophysical surveys often help to identify and map archaeological features within identified sites.

<text>The Laurentian Bank of Canada (LBC; ) is a Schedule 1 bank that operates primarily in the province of Quebec, with commercial and business banking offices located in Ontario, Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia. LBC&#x27;s Institution Number (or routing number) is 039.

The institution was established as the Montreal City and District Savings Bank in 1846. The bank&#x27;s shares were publicly listed on the Montreal Stock Exchange in 1965 and the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1983. In 1987, the institution was renamed the &quot;Laurentian Bank of Canada&quot;.

It is the only bank in North America to have had a labour union, some 1,100 positions becoming unionized in 1967, with the rest of non-managerial positions joining decades later. In 2017, there was a failed attempt by the bank to decertify the Canadian Office and Professional Employees Union, but a majority of workers voted for union decertification in March 2021, leading the Canada Industrial Relations Board to revoke the union&#x27;s certification in April 2021.

==History==

LBC&#x27;s history began in 1846 with the founding of the Banque d&#x27;Épargne de la Cité et du District de Montréal, or Montreal City and District Savings Bank, by Bishop Ignace Bourget and a group of 15 prominent individuals from Montreal, Quebec. The bank&#x27;s 60 honorary directors included Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine, Louis-Joseph Papineau, and Sir George-Étienne Cartier.

In 1965, the bank listed its shares on the Montreal Stock Exchange.

In 1974, the bank installed an ATM system called &quot;Bancaide&quot;. Primitive by the standards of the following decade, the nonetheless revolutionary machine dispensed cash 24 hours a day. 

In 1980, the Montreal City and District Savings Bank obtained the right to expand its operations throughout Canada. This expansion led to the institution listing its shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange three years later, and in 1987, the bank was renamed Laurentian Bank of Canada. In 1988, after more than a century (1871–1988) at 176 Saint-Jacques Street, the institution&#x27;s head office moved to McGill College Avenue in Montreal.

In 1993, the bank acquired General Trust Corporation and purchased most of the Société Nationale de Fiducie&#x27;s assets from the brokerage firm BLC Rousseau, thus creating Laurentian Bank Securities (LBS).

In 2000, it acquired all Sun Life Trust Company stock in a transaction that resulted in the creation of the new B2B Trust subsidiary, now known as B2B Bank.

In 2016, the bank relocated all of its Montreal offices, including its headquarters on McGill College Avenue, into a single building on 1360 Rene Levesque Boulevard West in Montreal.

In 2020, Rania Llewellyn was named president and CEO replacing acting CEO Stephane Therrien who had been serving as president and chief executive since Francois Desjardins retired in June 2020. 

On October 2 2023, Laurentian Bank announced the departure of CEO Rania Llewellyn and Chairman of the Board Michael Mueller. Ms. Llewellyn was replaced by M. Éric Provost. 

===Mergers and acquisitions===
The bank merged with Eaton Trust Company (in 1988), purchased Standard Trust&#x27;s assets (1991), acquired La Financière Coopérants Prêts-Épargne Inc., and Guardian Trust Company in Ontario (1992), acquired General Trust Corporation in Ontario, and purchased some Société Nationale de Fiducie assets and the brokerage firm BLC Rousseau (1993).

In 1993, the Desjardins-Laurentian Financial Corporation became the new majority shareholder of Laurentian Bank of Canada, following the merging of the Laurentian Group Corporation with the Desjardins Group. The bank purchased the Manulife Bank of Canada&#x27;s banking service network and the assets of Prenor Trust Company of Canada in 1994.

In 1995, the bank acquired 30 branches of the North American Trust Company.

In 1996, one of its subsidiaries acquired the parent corporation of Trust Prêt et Revenu du Canada. A few months later, the withdrawal of its main shareholder, Desjardins-Laurentian Financial Corporation, prompted the Laurentian Bank to become a Schedule 1 Bank under the Bank Act, on par with all the other large Canadian banks.

In 2023, Laurentian Bank launched a new line of Visa credit cards in partnership with Brim Financial. The new system provides digital onboarding and instant adjudication, instant virtual card issuance, mobile wallet functionality and self-serve card management options including setting credit limits and replacement of lost cards.

<text>Cullompton () is a town and civil parish in the district of Mid Devon and the county of Devon, England. It is north-east of Exeter and lies on the River Culm. In 2021, the parish as a whole had a population of 10,071, while the built-up area of the town had a population of 9,439.

The earliest evidence of occupation is from the Roman period: there was a fort on the hill above the town and occupation in the current town centre. Columtune was mentioned in Alfred the Great&#x27;s will, which left it to his youngest son Æthelweard (c. 880–922).

In the past, the town&#x27;s economy had a large component of wool and cloth manufacture, then, later, leather working and paper manufacture.

A large proportion of the town&#x27;s inhabitants are commuters, but there is some local manufacturing, including flour and paper mills. It has a monthly farmers&#x27; market held on the second Saturday of every month, which is the oldest event of its kind in the South West. It is home to two grade I listed buildings: the fifteenth-century St Andrew&#x27;s parish church and the seventeenth-century house known as The Walronds. The centre of the town is a conservation area; there are seven grade II*-listed buildings and ninety grade II-listed buildings in the parish.

==History==

===Toponymy and orthography===

The derivation of the name Cullompton is disputed. One derivation is that the town&#x27;s name means &quot;Farmstead on the River Culm&quot; with Culm probably meaning knot or tie (referring to the river&#x27;s twists and loops). The other theory is that it is named after Saint Columba of Tir-de-Glas, who preached to West Saxons in 549 AD. The Revd Grubb also states that the parish church was probably formerly dedicated to St Columba (although for the last 500 years it has been dedicated to St Andrew) and that tradition records there was an ancient figure or image of Columba. There are 40 recorded spellings of Cullompton between the first recorded use of the name and the present day, and even as late as the mid-nineteenth century three spellings were in use: the post office spelled it &quot;Cullompton&quot;; in their 1809 first edition the Ordnance Survey map used &quot;Cullumpton&quot; and the railway station sign said &quot;Collumpton&quot;. The railway station sign was changed to Cullompton in 1874 and the Ordnance Survey used Cullompton in the edition of their map published in 1889. It is affectionately known as &quot;Cully&quot;.

===Roman period===

On St Andrew&#x27;s Hill, to the north-west of Cullompton town centre, two Roman forts were discovered in 1984 by aerial photography carried out for Devon County Council. The earlier, smaller fort (the boundary ditches of which showed up in cropmarks) was later replaced by a second, larger fort. The ramparts of this second fort are preserved on two sides as modern field boundaries with substantial earthen banks with hedges on top. The banks on the other two sides were removed shortly before the site was recognised as Roman. The site was made a scheduled monument in 1986. The aerial photography also revealed two subsidiary military enclosures or annexes to each fort. In 1992 a geophysical survey was made of the fort and areas to the east and west and this was followed by a trial excavation to the west of the site. These confirmed the existence of two forts, and the ditch of the second fort was excavated. Pottery from the site was dated from around 50–70 AD, which is consistent with a previous date of before 75 AD based on finds from fieldwalking. A Roman settlement near Shortlands Lane was excavated in 2009. A large quantity of Roman pottery, burial remains and fragments of hypocaust tile from the second and third century was found.

===Saxon period and middle ages===

Saxon settlers moved into the Culm Valley in the seventh century and Cullompton was made the site of a minster. In 872 Alfred the Great bequeathed &quot;Columtune&quot; and its lands to his son Æthelweard. At the time of the Norman Conquest, it was held by the Lady Gytha Thorkelsdóttir, the widow of Godwin, Earl of Wessex and mother of King Harold II. In 1067 William the Conqueror passed through the villa of Colitona on his way to besiege Exeter where Gytha was living. In 1087 William the Conqueror gave the manor to Baldwin, his wife&#x27;s favourite nephew. It was subsequently held by the Earl of Devon for many years until in 1278 Amicia Countess of Devon willed it to the Abbot and Convent of Buckland Monachorum. With the dissolution of the monasteries it was sold to Sir John St Ledger. The five prebends of Cullompton (Colebrook, Hineland, Wiever, Esse, Upton) were presented by William the Conqueror to Battle Abbey in Sussex and were later held by St Nicholas Priory, Exeter. In 1536 St Nicholas Priory was dissolved and the last Prior gained appointment as the Vicar of Cullompton. Patronage then passed to the More family of Moorehays.

In 1278 the town was granted its first market to be held on a Thursday. In 1356 the town gained its first water supply by a deed of gift of the Abbot of Buckland. The water (known as the Town Lake or watercourse) came from a stream rising at Coombe Farm and flowed into a pond near Shortlands. From there it flowed in several open channels to all parts of the town. Water bailiffs were employed to protect the interests of the town and a tradition of &quot;possessioning&quot; took place. This was a ceremony that took place every seven years where a group of townsfolk would inspect the channel and ensure that it was not being abused. The first recorded possessioning was in 1716. In the mid-nineteenth century the water courses were used for boiling vegetables, surface drainage and emptying cesspools. A Board of Health Inspector in 1854 concluded that &quot;typhus and other epidemic diseases are so prevalent here more so than in any other parish in the Union&quot;. They were eventually only used to keep the streets clean and continued to flow until 1962 when the town council decided that they were not willing to pay for their upkeep.

===English Civil War to the eighteenth century===
In August 1642, during the English Civil War Mr Ashford and Richard Culme – then Sheriff of Devon attempted to have their commission read in Cullompton, but were opposed by the local parish constable, Walter Challs, and by the people of the town. As well as raising troops for the Royalists, the commission would also have halted a scheduled muster of the local militia. Despite the support of local landowners such as John Acland, who was another of the Commissioners of the Array, this strong local opposition meant that Culme and Ashford failed. Later, the Royalist Earl of Bath came with cavaliers to try and support Ashford, but the locals responded by throwing up chains and preparing their militia.

Troops passed through Cullompton on several occasions during the civil war: Sir Ralph Hopton rode with a small troop through the town on his way to Cornwall; Cornish Royalist forces marched through Cullompton on their way to join Prince Maurice at Chard as did the Earl of Essex and Thomas Fairfax. There were troops on the streets of Cullompton again in 1655 during the Penruddock uprising.

In 1678 a local innkeeper, John Barnes was hanged after being found guilty of highway robbery. He had waylaid, with the help of accomplices, a coach travelling from Exeter to London and made off with about £600 but he was recognised by the guards from Exeter, where he had been a taverner.

Another local man called Tom Austin was hanged in August 1694. He inherited a farm with an annual income of £80 and then married the daughter of a neighbouring farmer with a dowry of £800. He lived an extravagant lifestyle and spent all of his money. His farm, having been neglected could not provide sufficient income for him and he borrowed a lot of money from neighbours and friends. He then turned to highway robbery and was moderately successful for a time. He shot Sir Zachary Wilmott during a robbery on the road between Wellington and Taunton. The proceeds from his crimes supported him for a time but in the long term he was unable to clear his debts. In 1694, following a row with his wife, he went to visit his uncle. His uncle was not at home and he killed his aunt and her five children and took around £60 from the house. On returning home he was asked about the bloodstains on his clothes by his wife. He then killed her and his two children. His uncle, who dropped in to visit him on his way home, knocked Austin unconscious and he was arrested and later hanged at Exeter Jail.

The Cullompton Company of Volunteers (a voluntary body of soldiers) was first raised in 1794 and continued until 1810. The volunteer companies were formed following Britain&#x27;s entry into the French Revolutionary Wars and continued to exist during the Napoleonic Wars. Cullompton was the first inland town to offer to raise a volunteer company (on 16 May 1794) and on 24 June the volunteers were accepted. The first commander, Captain Jarmin, was a former Marine officer. The company was formed into a battalion with 11 other volunteer companies called the Hayridge (later Highbridge) regiment. It had 1,200 men and three companies were based in Cullompton with a barracks in New Cut. Jarmin died in 1794 and was succeeded by Henry Skinner Esq. In 1801 the company became a cavalry troop and was then disbanded only to be reformed in 1805 when hostilities with France resumed. Many Cullompton men fought in the Peninsular War and at the Battle of Waterloo.
The first Nonconformist congregation began in 1662 when the vicar of Cullompton, Revd William Crompton, was ejected from the established church. He continued to preach and a Protestant Dissenters meeting house was built in 1698 which became the Unitarian Chapel. In the eighteenth century there was a prevalence of Dissent with the local vicar recording in 1736 that of a population of 3358 there were 508 Presbyterians, 133 Anabaptists and 87 Quakers. By 1743 the first Baptist Chapel had been built. John Wesley&#x27;s journal records preaching near the town in 1748 and on numerous occasions until 1789.

===Nineteenth century to present===

In 1805 or 1806 the last bull-baiting in the town took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire destroyed many houses in Cullompton. About two thirds of the town burnt with 145 houses and other buildings being destroyed. A subscription for rebuilding was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.

There have been police stations in the town since 1857, when the first Police Station was rented. It had three cells and a petty session courtroom. A new police station was built in 1974, which underwent a major refurbishment in 2011, to become a police force hub for Mid Devon, with 72 staff members. The town acquired its first steam-driven fire engine in 1914 which cost £100 and was paid for by voluntary subscription.

In April 1903 a petition objecting to the renewal of alcohol licences for local inns, signed by 450 people, was presented to the brewsters sessions (magistrates&#x27; court meetings in England where pub licences were renewed or granted). A deputation sent to the session explained that the number of licensed houses was too large in proportion to the population. In 1917, the cattle market moved from the Higher Bullring to a field near the station. The first cinema was opened in the Victoria Hall in 1918 by Bill Terry and in 1977 the town was twinned with Ploudalmézeau in Brittany, France.

In 1920, a public company was formed to provide an electricity supply for Cullompton which merged with the Bradninch Electricity Company in 1927 to form the Culm Valley Electricity Supply Co. Ltd. A gasworks was set up in Cullompton in 1865 for the Cullompton Gas Light and Coke Co. This was taken over by the Devon Gas Association and nationalised in 1949. The gasworks was closed in 1956 and Cullompton was then supplied from Exeter.

Another serious fire occurred on 17 October 1958, when Selwood&#x27;s tannery in Exeter Street was gutted by fire; the site was subsequently used by a series of supermarkets. It was run as a Gateway store and then as a Somerfield before closing in 2010. Aldi re-opened on the site in April 2014 following a major refurbishment of the store.

The town saw a major expansion in the 1970s as the construction of a bypass in 1969, and its conversion into part of the M5 in 1974, made it a popular commuter town, and it continued to expand during the closing years of the 20th century and the first few years of the 21st century. The Mid Devon Local Development Framework Proposals include plans to erect 95 new dwellings a year, and to build of new employment floorspace a year between the start of the plan and 2026. The first Cullompton town website was set up in 1998 and a new website was created in 2011. CCTV was installed in the main street in 2000.

In March 2010, it was announced that the town&#x27;s magistrates&#x27; court was to be closed due its poor facilities and lack of rooms. It had been suggested that the site might be developed as a town hall or the site used as a car park. but this plan was prevented when a group formed to oppose the proposal to purchase the site for a new town hall were elected to two thirds of the council seats in May 2011. In June 2011, it was announced that two local businesspeople had purchased the site and the building was demolished in March 2012 to make space for a car park.

The town got its first permanent library in 1938 in a building on Exeter Hill. In September 2011, a new library opened on a new site, which was four times the size of the old one and cost three million pounds. This was followed shortly afterwards, in December 2011, by the opening of the Cullompton Community Centre, costing 1.5 million pounds. The Tiverton Dramatic Society used the new venue to stage the first pantomime to be performed in Cullompton for 20 years.

===Historic estates===
Within the parish of Cullompton are situated various historic estates including:
* The church of Cullompton and its land was given to Battle Abbey by William the Conqueror. The manor contained five sub-manors called Upton, Weaver, Ash, Colebrook and Henland (now in the parish of Kentisbeare). This manor later passed to St Nicholas Priory in Exeter. 
* Cullompton. At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, this manor was part of the royal manor of Silverton and so not recorded separately. Before the conquest it was held by King Edward. In 1291 this manor was given to Buckland Abbey by Isabella Countess of Devon. 
* Padbrook and Newland were also smaller parts of Silverton in Domesday.
* Colebrook was also a Domesday manor. William Cheever was the tenant-in-chief and it was held by Manfred. Alward held it before 1066. It was given to Ford Abbey by Henry de Tracey. 
* Hillersdon, was held by Sherwold before 1066. Reginald held it from Odo FitzGamelin at the time of Domesday and was later held of the Honour of Torrington. 
* Two manors named Ponsford were recorded in the Domesday Book and were both held by William from Baldwin the Sheriff. Before 1066, one of the manors was held by Sidwin and one by Edwin. 
* Langford was also held from Baldwin by Rainer at the time of Domesday. The manor was previously held by Brictmer. Along with Ponsford it later formed part of the Honour of Okehampton and was held by the Courtneys. 
* There are two estates named Aller in the Domesday Book. One of these lay within the Parish of Cullompton and was held by Ralph Pagnell. Within the manor were Whitheathfield and an unidentified place named Frieland. Bolealler may have also been part of this manor. Along with Kerswell, Aller was granted to Montacute Priory by Matilda Peverel and a cell was established at Kerswell Priory. 
* Moor Hayes, for many centuries the seat of the prominent Moor (&quot;alias&quot; Moore) family, which was responsible for the Moore Chantry / Moor Hayes Chapel at the east end of the north aisle of Cullompton Church.

=== Economic history ===

Cullompton has a long history of manufacturing, first with wool and cloth manufacture, and then later with leather working and light industry.

==== Cloth trade ====

In the 15th century the weaving of fine kersies and later serges was introduced to the area by weavers from the continent. This was largely a cottage industry and merchants would have premises where the fleeces would be combed and sorted. John Lane was one of the best known local cloth merchants (see Lane&#x27;s Aisle in the section on St Andrew&#x27;s church below). In the seventeenth century, Higher and Lower King&#x27;s Mills were fulling mills for the local industry. In 1816 Mr Upcott employed 60 weavers and &#x27;many spinners&#x27;. The Wellington based firm Fox Brothers had a branch factory built in 1890 and made high quality woolen and worsted cloth until 1977. During World War I, their entire output was of khaki cloth, employing over 200 people. In 1910 Mrs Gidley, wife of Dr Gustavus Gidley, set up a hand-weaving enterprise in the stables of Heyford House with the aim of giving employment to ex-servicemen and disabled people. To manage it she appointed two women, one a granddaughter of Bishop Phillpotts. Later the business evolved into machine knitted garments.

==== Mills powered by the town leat ====

A leat runs to the east of the town&#x27;s main street but it is uncertain when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, the southern end of the leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie&#x27;s bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and a chimney base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.

==== Tanning ====

Tanning in Cullompton goes back to at least the sixteenth century and in the nineteenth century there were three tanneries: Crow Green, Lower King&#x27;s Mill and Court Tannery. The tannery at Higher King&#x27;s Mill was active between about 1830 and 1875 and employed 12 labourers in 1851 and 9 a decade later. Court Tannery was established by 1871 and had closed by 1906. It was located at the north end of the town behind Court House, which was the residence of the owners of the tannery. In 1871 it employed 21 men and was probably steam-powered. A local tanner, James Whitby, along with George Bodley and John Davis patented an improved bark mill (used to grind bark for producing tanbark used in the tanning process).

The Crow Green tannery was situated at the south-west end of the town and was already in existence in 1816. It had a water-powered bark mill and 47 tan pits at that date. It was owned by the Selwood family for much of the 19th and 20th centuries, who probably purchased it from James Whitby around 1830, and it was often referred to as Selwood&#x27;s tannery. It suffered from fires in 1831, 1867 and 1958. In 1881 it employed 48 people and over 100 in 1958 (8% of the local workforce at the time). One of the major products of the factory in the nineteenth century was high-quality sole leather, but during the Second World War, only poor-quality hides, such as buffalo, were allocated to the firm. The business was badly damaged by the invention of rubber stick-on shoe soles which reduced the demand for sole leather from shoe repairers. It finally finished operation in 1967 when the leather side of the business was sold to a Yorkshire firm.

The building to the north-west of Exeter Hill, which formerly housed the water-powered bark mill, is now an antiques warehouse and the remains of the leat and tail race can still be seen. This side of the site was also the location of the lime yard. The other half of the site, to the south-east of Exeter Hill, which was the location of the tan yard, is now the site of an Aldi supermarket.

In addition to tanning, the leather industry included a leather dressing works (founded in 1921 and which closed in 1982) and a glove maker, Drevon and Brown.

==== Paper making ====

The first paper mill in Cullompton dates from 1729, with mills being set up near by at Hele and Higher Kensham in 1767, at Lower Kensahm c1788 and Langford c 1788. These would have been small water-powered vat mills, where paper was made by hand, generally by women and children. Records show that the mill in Cullompton was owned by a Mr Simon Mills in 1757 and was taken over by a Mr Theodore Dart in 1799. There followed a number of different owners of whom one of the most significant was Albert Reed who purchased the mill in 1883. His brother, William Reed, established a partnership with a Mr C King Smith.
The Reed &amp; Smith group (which acquired New Taplow Mill in 1950) became one of the biggest papermakers in the UK. A Fourdrinier machine was installed in 1892 and continued to make paper at Higher Kings until about 1972. A new machine was built in 1956 to make blue sugar bags and other products, and has been modified over the years to make different grades of paper and card. St Regis acquired Higher Kings in the early 1980s and since then the mill has diversified into making a wide range of recycled coloured papers and card. It is now owned by Asia File Corporation.

==== Cabinet making ====

Luxtons cabinet makers was founded in 1800 and grew until it employed 50 people, with workshops at Cockpit Hill and Duke Street. After World War I a retail shop was opened by the firm in Fore Street and it kept going doing retailing and repairs until the mid-1960s.

A former employee of Luxtons, William Broom, started his own cabinet making business in 1920 and employed 7 or 8 workmen until the 1930s when the Great Depression meant that by the start of the Second World War, William Broom was the only worker in the firm. After the war, the firm concentrated on repair work and antiques restoration. The firm closed in 1990 with the retirement of Sid Russ who had taken the firm over after William Broom retired.

==== Haulage ====
Mark Whitton founded Whitton&#x27;s in the early 1900s carrying timber with a horse and cart. After World War I the company carried coal to the gas works and local paper mills. In 1923 they bought their first Sentinel steam lorry and carried paper to Bristol, returning with animal feed. During the Second World War they were run by the Ministry of Transport and after the war were nationalised to become part of British Road Services. The brothers who had owned the company moved back into haulage, setting up a new firm which went into receivership in the 1970s and was then bought by Wild Transport of Exeter in 1973.

==== Bell foundry and clock making ====

A Cullompton man called Chubb travelled widely to repair bells during the reign of James I. In 1745 a vestry meeting determined that in order to reduce the cost of having the church bells repaired, the bells should be cast in some part of the almshouses, and a bell founder be found to work there.
In 1746 Thomas Bilbie, from Chew Stoke in Somerset, created a new bell foundry (The West of England Church Bellfoundry) in the town, paying an annual rent of £1/13/4 (£1.67) for premises in the Almshouse building. He recast the six bells of Cullompton church as eight new ones. In 1754 Thomas&#x27;s eldest son also called Thomas moved to Cullompton to take over the bell foundry. Over a period of 26 years he cast 239 bells, the majority for churches in Devon. When he died, aged 53 in 1780, his son Thomas Castleman Bilbie took over the business and cast 197 bells from 1780 to 1813. The business was then sold to Pannell and Co. who moved it to Exeter in 1850.
St Michael&#x27;s and All Angel&#x27;s in Alphington has a peal of 8 bells cast by Bilbie in Cullompton, at a cost of £108 12 shillings and 8 pence (£1.63) in 1749. The bell in the Chapel at Killerton House was made by W. Pannell and Son in 1845.

The Bilbie family were also involved in clock making. In 1749 Thomas Biblie (senior) was asked to make a set of chimes for Cullompton church. Thomas II worked on clock mechanisms to play tunes on church bells at East Coker and also at Beaminster. Thomas Castleman is recorded as having made a clock for Cullompton Church in 1811 at a cost of £55.

==== Other industries ====
There was also a jam factory, &#x27;Devon Dale Jam&#x27; in the 1930s and a foundry.

== Governance ==
The town and civil parish of Cullompton has three wards: North (6 councillors), South (7 councillors) and Outer (2 councillors). The town council first met on 1 December 1894 when it took over from the Parochial Committee, and since 1995 the town has had a mayor elected by the councillors, The current Mayor since 2022 is Councillor James Buczkowski. It is part of Mid Devon District Council and there are three Cullompton wards in the district council North (2 councillors), South (2 councillors) and Outer (1 councillor). The total population of the wards at the 2011 Census was 9,835. It is also part of Devon County Council and is represented through the Cullompton Rural ward.

From Saxon times it was part of the hundred of Hayridge. From 1894 to 1935 it was part of Tiverton Rural District and prior to that it was part of Tiverton Sanitary District and Tiverton Poor Law Union. It may have been a borough in the 17th century but this status was not sustained.

It is part of the Honiton and Sidmouth constituency and its MP since the 2024 United Kingdom general election is Richard Foord. It was formerly part of the Northern Parliamentary Division of Devon (1831–67), the North Division (1867–85), the North Eastern Division (1885–1918), the Honiton Division, and the Tiverton and Honiton constituency.

== Geography ==
Cullompton is south-east of Tiverton, north-north-east of Exeter and west-south-west of London. It is at about 70 m above sea level. The parish covers nearly and stretches for along the Culm valley.

== Demography ==

At the 2011 Census the parish of Cullompton had a population of 8,499. The wards of &quot;Cullompton North&quot; and &quot;Cullompton South&quot; contain the urban area and had a combined population of 7,643.

In 2011 there were 6,153 people aged 16 to 74 living in the parish. 4,591 were economically active of whom 177 were unemployed and 1,562 were economically inactive of whom 867 were retired. Figures in 2011 on ethnic composition for Cullompton were: White English/Welsh/Scottish/Northern Irish/British 94.2%, White other 3.6% and White Irish 0.3%. The parish&#x27;s religious composition was 61.8% Christian, 28.7% no religion and 8.5% religion not stated.

=== Population trends ===
In 1660 the population of the town (only including the urban parts of the parish) has been estimated at 1,800, which made it the 10th largest town in Devon and Cornwall. The town&#x27;s population grew to 2,750 by 1750 (meaning it was the 8th largest town) but it then fell rapidly so that it was only 2,275 by 1805 – only the 23rd largest town in Devon and Cornwall. This fall in population, in a period when many other towns grew rapidly, was probably due to the decline in the importance of the cloth trade in this period. The population of the parish changed little from the start of the 19th century until the 1970s, remaining at around 3,000 (see chart). However it increased rapidly in the last part of the 20th century and the start of the 21st. Cullompton&#x27;s population growth looks set to continue as Mid Devon&#x27;s core strategy foresees 95 new dwellings being built per year in the period to 2026.

== Economy ==
In 2001 the proportion of people living and working in Cullompton was 43% with 19% of the town&#x27;s working population employed in Exeter.

=== Retail ===
In 2001 the retail sector in Cullompton met fairly local needs only. The town currently has two supermarkets, Tesco, which opened in September 2008 and Aldi which opened in April 2014. Mole Valley Farmers has a store in the town which sells a wide range of goods including farm requirements, garden supplies and hardware.

The Cullompton street market came to an end in the late 1950s but it was revived for a trial period of seven weeks starting on Saturday 28 June 2008. Although in the initial few weeks trading was good, overall takings for the traders were disappointing. The town also has an indoor market in Cullompton Town Hall every Wednesday.

A farmers&#x27; market held in Cullompton is the oldest event of its kind in the South West. It was Tracey Frankpitt&#x27;s idea, and after much work, the first market was held on 13 June 1998. She was later consulted by the producers of the long running radio soap opera The Archers and the Cullompton farmers&#x27; market was mentioned in one of the episodes. It is held monthly on the second Saturday of the month.

There is an active traders group (Cullompton Traders Association) which holds a range of events. The Bullring Market has been relaunched since Dec 2012 and continues into 2013 every Wednesday and Saturday.

=== Kingsmill industrial estate ===
Mid Devon District Council owns 11 industrial units at the Kingsmill industrial estate which are let
by a variety of businesses. Business based on the estate include Gregory Distribution, who have of temperature controlled storage which they use for a contract to deliver chilled and frozen goods to Spar stores in the southwest. There is also a flour mill, milk depot, marketing and advertising agency and an industrial clothing shop as well as Higher Kings Mill.

== Culture and community ==

The town has an annual Christmas parade to celebrate the switching on of the town&#x27;s Christmas lights and a festival week in the summer which includes the annual town fayre (formerly known as the Cullompton Town Picnic and Classic Car Show).

Community facilities improved during 2011, with the completion of two projects. The first was a &#x27;community hub&#x27; called &#x27;The Hayridge&#x27;, which opened in September. The facility, which is open six days a week, has a public lending library and cafe with free Wi-Fi access, IT suites and conference facilities. The office space is used by Cullompton Adult Community Learning which was previously based at the local secondary school. Cullompton Adult Community Learning is run by Devon County Council and offers a range of courses for adult learners ranging from Indian Head Massage to French for Beginners. Courses are run in the Hayridge&#x27;s learning suites on the first floor. The second major project completed in 2011 was the Cullompton Community centre, which opened in December. This is a building created for community use with sponsorship from St Andrew&#x27;s church and with grants from Devon County Council and Uffculme Environmental Fund, donations from church members, and money from the South West of England Regional Development Agency. The main meeting area has seating capacity for 180 people, and there are five further meeting rooms as well as offices, kitchens and toilets.

A major recreational area for the town is the Cullompton Community Association&#x27;s fields which cover in the centre of the town. The fields are used for a variety of events, which include a circus, whippet racing and a firework display. The Association is a registered charity which was formed in 1970 to provide a recreation area for the town. It purchased the fields, which are next to the riverside walk along the leat, for £11,500. The site was chosen as the water meadows needed to be maintained to help prevent flooding and it was also close to the cricket and bowling clubs. Youth activities have been provided by a youth centre called the John Tallack Centre since it opened in 1988.

In February 2008 the Culm Valley Integrated Centre for Health opened in Cullompton. The services provided at the site include: the College Surgery Partnership which is a large general practice with ten doctors; complementary therapies provided by Culm Valley
Natural Health; self care groups a health food café, a physic garden and a pharmacy run by Alliance Boots. Health care is also provided by the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Trust, which has run a residential centre called &#x27;The Woodmill&#x27; since May 1998. It is the most southerly residential assessment and rehabilitation centre run by the Trust in the United Kingdom, and provides rehabilitation for up to 23 adults with acquired brain injury.

Cullompton United Charities provides a number of charitable services to residents of Cullompton. The majority of the funds come from bequests made to the parish from the seventeenth century onwards. Thirteen separate charities were combined in 1921 and then in 1953 further amalgamation went on with the Trott&#x27;s almshouses, John Lanes Charity and the Charity of George Spicer combining to form the current United Charities. There are nine local almshouses which are available to local residents over the age of 55. They also offer Alpha Piperline emergency call services for the elderly, can refund up to £100 to school leavers under 25 who have spent money equipping themselves with tools, books, vocational training or further education and offer financial help needy individuals resident in the parish to help them purchase specific items.

== Media ==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received Stockland Hill and local relay TV transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, Radio Exe, East Devon Radio, and TCR Radio, a community-based station which broadcast from Tiverton.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Culm Valley Gazette.

== Landmarks ==
The street plan of the town still reflects the medieval layout of the town. Most shops lie along Fore Street with courts behind them linked by alleyways. The length of the high street reflects the prosperity of the town from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century when it was a centre of the cloth trade. The street plan is still fundamentally the same as shown on a map of 1663, with a wider area at the North end where markets were held, roads to Tiverton and Ponsford and a small lane leading down to a mill (now known as Lower Mill). This map has only two buildings with roofs coloured blue (conventionally meaning they were of slate) – St Andrew&#x27;s church and the Walronds. There are two grade I listed buildings in Cullompton: the fifteenth century parish church (St Andrew&#x27;s) and the Walronds at 6 Fore Street. There are also seven grade II* listed buildings and ninety grade II listed buildings. The centre of the town is a conservation area, first designated in 1977, with further planning protections implemented in 2009. Hillersdon House, a Victorian manor house is near to the town centre and within the parish.

=== The Walronds ===
The Walronds was probably built in 1605 which is the date over the hall fireplace. John Peter, a lawyer, acquired the property by marriage into the Paris family and his initials are over the fireplace. The plan is a traditional one with the ground floor hall divided from the entrance passage by a screen. The main range has three storeys and there are two wings which are both two storeys high. In the upper south-east room is a barrel shaped ceiling and a second fireplace with the date 1605. The association with the prominent local gentry family of Walrond of Bradfield House only dates from the eighteenth century.

It is now owned by Cullompton Walronds Preservation Trust which was registered as a charity and as a private company limited by guarantee in the spring of 1997. It inherited half the building in 2005 from Miss June Severn and bought the other half. In 2008 the building became the only building in Mid Devon to be put on English Heritage&#x27;s Buildings at Risk Register and received £250,000 from Devon County Council and £100,000 from Mid Devon District Council for restoration work. Emergency repairs costing £15,000 were carried out during 2008. In July 2010 the Heritage Lottery Fund announced that it would provide a grant of £1.75 million to help complete the restoration. Work began with the erection of scaffolding in August 2011. Restoration including restoring the rendering on the house. This had been removed in 1898 causing water to penetrate the fabric of the building. The house re-opened to the public following the restoration on 29 March 2014 with a display of kersey cloth and costumes made by the Walronds Costume making group.

The upper floors of the house, the inner garden and car park will be leased to the Vivat Trust for holiday lettings. The trust will retain the three rooms adjoining the path from Fore Street for public use. These comprise a meeting room, a kitchen and a lavatory. Additionally, the Trust plans to convert the garden which stretches back to Shortlands Lane into a park for the people of the town.

=== St Andrew&#x27;s Church ===
St Andrew&#x27;s church dates from the fifteenth century and is set back from the main street but despite this its tower is a landmark which is highly visible from the surrounding area. The tower is tall with pinnacles on top which add a further to its height. On the west face are the badly damaged remains of a Crucifixion scene with figures of Edward VI and St George to either side. The tower also has a large clock face by Norman of Ilfracombe dating from about 1874. Despite being the first part of the church to be seen when approaching from the main street, it is however the most recent part of the church, being built 1545–1549. The tower is built in the local red sandstone with carved parts in Beer and Ham Hill stone.

The nave and chancel are carried on five pairs of piers and the interior has a boarded wagon roof coloured in blue, crimson and gold which stretches the whole length of the church. At the time of the construction of the Bristol and Exeter Railway, William Froude – the engineer given responsibility for this section of the line by Isambard Kingdom Brunel – inserted iron stringers to prevent the walls from spreading as a result of vibrations from the trains. A screen runs across the whole width of the church.

At the end of the nave is a Jacobean gallery with four oak pillars about tall. It dates from 1637 and there are sixteen figures carved on it. These figures are typical of the Stuart period and represent the twelve apostles and the Four Evangelists (meaning that Matthew and Mark appear twice). At the centre are Saint Andrew (with an X cross), Saint Peter (with a key) and Saint John (with the chalice).

The central window of the North Aisle is a World War II memorial and a World War I memorial is on the other side. The Moores Chantry Chapel (or Moor Hayes Chapel) occupying the easternmost bay of the North Aisle, was built by the Moor (&quot;alias&quot; Moore) family, long resident at Moor Hayes within the parish, and contains some original box pews. At the rear (western end) of the church are two large pieces of oak which make up a Golgotha which once rested on top of the Rood Screen. They are carved with rocks, skulls and bones. They were probably removed from the church in 1549 and cut into 2 pieces. For many years they remained in the graveyard.

On the south side of the church is the first major addition to the church: Lane&#x27;s Aisle. This was built 1526–1529 by a local cloth merchant, John Lane (d.1529). It is fan vaulted in a style inspired by the Dorset aisle at Ottery St Mary and some of the carvings are similar to John Greenway&#x27;s Chapel at Tiverton. John Lane and wife are buried at the east end of the aisle.

=== Cullompton Manor House ===
Cullompton Manor House is a grade II* listed building with sections built in 1603 (dated panel and initials TT for Thomas Trock on the top corner of the front of the house) and 1718 (on a lead cistern head of a drainpipe, are the letters (L) S/WT (R) and the date 1718). It was originally a private residence and now forms part of the Manor House Hotel. It has a jettied half timbered front with four gables and stone end walls with upper windows on carved brackets. It was probably built in the sixteenth century but was refurbished in 1603 for Thomas Trock, a clothier. The original structure consisted only of the front part, in which there were three rooms and a passage on the ground floor, three rooms opening into each other on the floor above, and above again. The front room on the left was the former hall with large oak panels of the Queen Anne period, and a moulded and beamed ceiling. Part of an earlier newel stair which descended to the hall or kitchen survives above a back staircase. The house was remodelled in 1718 for William Sellock. At the front of the building is a hooded shell porch of the early 18th century supported on pilasters and the back of house is also early 18th century of red and blue brick, with windows with thick glazing bars beneath a hipped slate roof with coved eaves. It was given the name of The Manor House in 1850 by J. S. Upcott who owned the property at that time. During World War II it was requisitioned by the army and used to billet officers. The adjacent house, Veryards, was originally a separate residence but was bought by the owners of the Manor House Hotel and incorporated into the hotel in the 1980s.

The building is currently on the Heritage at Risk Register following a serious deterioration in its condition which led to concerns for public safety, and the issuing of a repairs notice under section 48 of Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 by Mid Devon District Council.

===Cullompton Leat===
Running parallel to the main high street is a leat with a public footpath running along it. The leat runs from Head Weir, north of Cullompton, and takes its water from the Spratford Stream. It flows past three former watermills (Upper, Middle and Lower Mill) and then empties into the Culm near First Bridge. It is uncertain when the leat was first made but the south end of the leat and Lower Mill are shown on an early seventeenth-century map. The leat is no longer in use for powering mills and the Environment Agency is not interested in managing the leat nor keeping it flowing so the Cullompton Leat Conservancy Board was formed to restore and maintain the Leat in 2005.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
Junction 28 of the M5 lies within the parish of Cullompton and a short distance from the town centre. Other major road links are the A373 to Honiton and the former A38 to Exeter which runs through the town, and is now the B3181. In 2001 61.6% of people living in Cullompton travelled to work by car or van and 83% of households had at least one car. In October 1969 a bypass was completed but after only five years this was upgraded to form part of the M5. Since this time traffic coming from the south of Cullompton to the M5 junction has had to pass through the centre of the town. There are now problems with air quality in the town and Mid Devon District Council have made the whole of the built up area in Cullompton an Air quality management area. Traffic on the exit slip road leaving the M5 northbound often backed up onto the motorway, so the Highways Agency and Devon County Council made junction improvements by widening roads, introducing traffic lights and reopening the left hand lane of the northbound slip road, at a cost of £1.3m. This cost was covered by businesses moving to Cullompton.

There are two routes for relief roads being considered by Mid Devon District Council – a western route and an eastern route. If a lower growth option is chosen it is proposed that only the western route would be constructed. An alternative Outer Eastern Relief Road crossing the M5 at Old Hill was rejected as the existing bridges would need rebuilding, making the cost prohibitive. There is some opposition to both routes – a group called &quot;Cullompton Against Western Relief Road&quot; has been formed to oppose one route and there is also opposition to the eastern route which passes through the Cullompton Community Fields.

===Railways===

The Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway opened Cullompton railway station when the railway opened on 1 May 1844. Around 1931 the lines were widened to provide two passing loops and a new goods shed and waiting room were constructed. It closed to passengers on 5 October 1964, the site now being used for the M5 motorway Cullompton services. The nearest railway station is Tiverton Parkway, opened by British Rail in May 1986, about north along the M5.

====Railway station reopening====
Devon County Council&#x27;s Travel Transport Plan includes the reopening of Cullompton railway station, and in July 2016 Mid Devon District Council announced that it would spend £40k on engineering design work to test the viability of their concept for a new station. This matched a previous commitment by Taunton Deane Borough Council of £40,000 and £10,000 contributions from the Town Councils of Cullompton and Wellington. The Cullompton Reopening Plan was a successful bidder in the May 2020 Round of the Department of Transport Ideas Fund.

===Buses===
The 1 and 373 buses run by Stagecoach South West provide regular bus services to Tiverton and Exeter. There is also a town circular bus run by Dartline. An express bus from Plymouth to Bristol, branded the SW Falcon and run by Stagecoach, stops at Cullompton.

== Education ==

Cullompton has two primary schools: St Andrews Primary School which is a medium-sized primary school with approximately 230 pupils in Key Stages 1 &amp; 2, and nine classes and Willowbank Primary School. The secondary school is Cullompton Community College. It opened in 1964 on the present site and became fully comprehensive in 1979. It is now a co-educational comprehensive school for students aged between 11 and 16 with approximately 650 students on roll and in December 2003 it secured sponsorship of £50,000 from The Co-operative Group to enable it to become a Business and Enterprise college. It 2017 it was described as being in the top 10% of schools in the country by Offsted. There was also good support for pupils who have special educational needs and/ or disabilities and the most able pupils were reaching high standards.

== Religious sites ==

As well as the Parish church, St Andrew (see #Landmarks), there are several other religious sites. The Roman Catholic church, Saint Boniface, was built in 1929 by Manuel de las Casas who was descended from the uncle of Bartolomé de las Casas. The church served a separate parish until 2014 when the parish merged with that of Tiverton to become the Parish of St Boniface and St James Mid Devon. The Methodist church in New Cut is the third chapel on the site. The first was started in 1764 and the current building was built following a fire in 1872 which did serious damage to the chapel built in 1806. The Unitarian chapel on Pound Square dates from 1913 following the collapse of the previous building in 1911. It is the oldest nonconformist congregation in Cullompton. Hebron Evangelical Church was built in 1962. The Baptist Church is the site of a meeting house erected in 1743 on High Street.

== Sports and leisure ==
===Local teams and clubs===
Cullompton Rugby Club was formed in 1892 and played on thirteen different grounds in and around the town before their current ground – Stafford Park – was purchased in 1980. In 2008-9 the senior 1st XV team won the Western Counties West League finishing the season unbeaten. On Saturday 9 May 2009 they won the EDF Energy Senior Vase by beating Tyldesley 8–7 at Twickenham. Exeter Chiefs prop Ben Moon formerly played for Cullompton and is now an England International. Ladies rugby started at Cullompton in 1997 and by 2009 the team had two qualified coaches. They currently play in the National Challenge South West South 2 league. Former Cullompton flanker Izzy Noel Smith, currently playing for Bristol has been capped for England. Abbie Brown is another former player who captained England at the 2018 Commonwealth Games where they won a bronze medal in the Rugby Sevens competition.

The local football team is Cullompton Rangers who were formed in 1945 and play in Premier Division of the South West Peninsula League. Their ground is called Speeds Meadow. There was also a women&#x27;s football team – Cullompton Rangers L.F.C. who were formed when Exeter City L.F.C. amalgamated with Cullompton Rangers AFC but in 2011 the women&#x27;s team folded when the manager was forced to leave and a replacement could not be found.

Cullompton cricket club was established in 1892 and they play at Landspeed Meadow, by the Cullompton Community Association Fields.
There are also a variety of other clubs including several bowls clubs and badminton, running, squash, and Taekwondo martial arts clubs.

<doc id="912558" wikidata="Q1747778" url="?curid=912558" title="Essiac">
<text>Essiac is a herbal tea promoted as an alternative treatment for cancer and other illnesses. There is no evidence it is beneficial to health. In a number of studies Essiac either showed no action against cancer cells, or actually increased the rate of cancer growth.

==Background==
While the formulations can vary, most Essiac formulations contain burdock root, turkey rhubarb root, sheep sorrel and slippery elm. From the 1920s through the 1970s, Essiac was promoted as a cancer treatment by Rene Caisse, a Canadian nurse who invented the formula. Caisse claimed at some times that the formula had been given to her by an Ontario Ojibwa patient she treated, and at other times that she had learned the formula from an unnamed &quot;medicine man&quot;. Neither story has ever been substantiated. There is no evidence that Essiac is a Native American or First Nations remedy. However, there are multiple factors that indicate the formula is not from any Native American or First Nations culture. Notably, in the original recipe, only one of the plants in the mixture, slippery elm, is indigenous to the Americas; none of the other herbs are native to North America. Caisse changed her story about the origins of the remedy, as well as the ingredients in the formula, several times, and was said to be fond of cultivating &quot;an air of mystery&quot; around it. The name &quot;Essiac&quot;, which Caisse gave to the tea, is Caisse&#x27;s name spelled backwards. Today, Essiac is often sold with apparatus (such as bottles and infusers) for making the tea, and is sometimes promoted with untrue claims that scientific studies have shown it to be effective.

In 1977, Caisse sold her Essiac formula and trademark rights to Respirin Corporation (a Canadian company and predecessor in title to Essiac Products Inc.), which attempted to commercialize the product. However, the company was unable to show any efficacy of Essiac against cancer. Repeated laboratory tests showed that Essiac failed to slow tumor growth and, in large doses, killed test animals. In a number of studies, Essiac actually &quot;increased&quot; the rate of cancer growth. As a result, both the U.S. and Canadian governments refused to approve Essiac as a medical treatment. Essiac was instead marketed by Essiac Products Inc. and others as a dietary supplement, subject to much looser regulation and not required to show any proof of effectiveness.

==Effectiveness==
Essiac&#x27;s purported effect on cancer has been reviewed by several major medical and scientific bodies, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. The American Cancer Society states that &quot;Reviews of medical records of people who have been treated with Essiac do not support claims that this product helps people with cancer live longer or that it relieves their symptoms.&quot; The NCI states &quot;Essiac and Flor Essence have not reported clear evidence of an anticancer effect&quot;, and the FDA described Essiac as a &quot;Fake Cancer &#x27;Cure&#x27; Consumers Should Avoid&quot;. Researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center have written that Essiac continues to be a popular cancer therapy despite unsubstantiated claims of its effectiveness. Cancer Research UK also notes that there is &quot;no scientific evidence that Essiac can help to treat cancer&quot; and cautions &quot;Always ask your doctors and nurses about whether any complementary or alternative cancer therapy you are thinking of using might interact with your other treatments.&quot;

==Side effects==
&quot;Essiac may cause headache, nausea, diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, low blood sugar, liver damage, and kidney damage. Allergic rashes are possible. Rarely, serious allergic reactions have been reported.&quot;

<doc id="912571" wikidata="Q3026236" url="?curid=912571" title="Diane Marleau">
<text>Diane Marleau, (June 21, 1943 – January 30, 2013) was a Canadian politician. She represented the riding of Sudbury in the House of Commons of Canada from 1988 to 2008, and was a cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chrétien. Marleau was a member of the Liberal Party of Canada.

She was married to Paul Marleau, a prominent businessman in Sudbury who ran for mayor of the city in the 2003 municipal election.

==Early life and career==

Marleau was born Diane Paulette Lebel in Kirkland Lake, Ontario, one of three children raised by a single mother in a low-income household. She was a childhood friend of Marie-Paule Charette, who later became a Senator and president of the Liberal Party.

She studied Commerce at the University of Ottawa, but left after three years when she married fellow student Paul Marleau, with whom she had three children: Brigitte, Donald and Stéphane, and moved to Sudbury. She worked as the secretary to a medical doctor for five years, prior to the introduction of Medicare. She later said that this experience made her realize the importance of a publicly funded health system, saying &quot;I was the one who had to collect the bills. It gave me an understanding of what it means when people are obliged to pay to see a doctor.&quot;

Marleau returned to Laurentian University as a mature student, and completed a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in Economics (1976). She worked as an accountant, managed an office for a firm of chartered accountants (Thorne and Riddell and then with Collins, Barrow-Maheux Noiseux), and operated a restaurant she co-owned with her husband. She also served on the boards of Laurentian University and Laurentian Hospital. Marleau worked on Judy Erola&#x27;s campaign in the 1980 federal election, and later credited Erola as a role model for her own career in public life.

==Municipal politics==

Marleau entered politics at the municipal level, serving as a Sudbury alderman and a Regional Municipality of Sudbury councillor from 1980 to 1985. She chaired the city&#x27;s Finance Committee, and backed a &quot;pay as you go&quot; debt-elimination plan that prohibited borrowing on capital investments. She served on the board of governors of Cambrian College, and was a member of the Ontario Advisory Council on Women&#x27;s Issues. In 1983, she chaired the Canadian Games for Physically Disabled.

After the 1985 provincial election, Ontario Liberal Party leader David Peterson appointed Marleau to a ten-member transition team that assisted the party as it formed government for the first time in 42 years. She ran for Mayor of Sudbury in the 1985 municipal elections, and lost to incumbent Peter Wong. She was asked to run for the Ontario Liberal Party in the 1987 provincial election, but declined. Marleau was considered to be on the right-wing of the Liberal Party in this period, although she later identified with a more left-wing position.

==Member of Parliament==

Marleau was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1988 federal election. The Progressive Conservative Party under Brian Mulroney won a majority government in this election, and Marleau served in the Official Opposition as critic for Energy, Mines and Resources. She supported Jean Chrétien&#x27;s successful bid for the party leadership in 1990, and was appointed to a five-person working group to design the party&#x27;s tax policy. She was named deputy Liberal whip in 1991, and became associate finance critic in 1992. Marleau criticized Bank of Canada governor John Crow during this period, arguing that his high interest rate policy was driving the economy into a recession.

===Cabinet minister===

;Minister of Health

The Liberals won a majority government in 1993 federal election, and incoming Prime Minister Jean Chrétien appointed Marleau as Minister of National Health and Welfare and Minister of Amateur Sport on November 4, 1993. This came as a surprise to many political observers, as Marleau did not have the national profile normally associated with Health portfolio. Some have speculated that Chrétien originally planned to appoint Marleau as Minister of National Revenue, and assigned her to Health as a late replacement for Sheila Copps and/or Hedy Fry.

;;Public health care

Marleau is a vocal supporter of public medicare. As Health Minister, she once said that she opposed user fees on the grounds that they discourage poor people from seeking medical treatment until the advanced stages of illness.

She intervened on more than one occasion to ensure that provincial governments upheld the principles of the Canada Health Act. Marleau withheld $750,000 in transfer payments to British Columbia in April 1994, after some doctors in that province extra-billed their patients for services. She defended this decision by arguing that it was inappropriate for taxpayers to subsidize private medicine. The British Columbia government supported her decision, and pledged to work with her in the future against extra-billing. Marleau also expressed concern about Ontario&#x27;s cuts to out-of-country hospital insurance in the same period, though she added that her government could do little to intervene in this particular situation.

Marleau later took action to stop provincial governments from funding semi-private clinics that required patients to pay facility fees. This was primarily directed against Alberta, where the provincial government of Ralph Klein argued that such fees were not in violation of the Canada Health Act. In 1995, Marleau warned the Alberta government that it would face transfer cuts if it did not shut down its private eye and diagnostic clinics before a federal deadline. Alberta agreed to develop a new policy shortly before time expired. Marleau later indicated that her standoff with Alberta was opposed by some in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, who worried about encroaching on a provincial jurisdiction during the period of the 1995 Quebec referendum. For his part, Chrétien described Marleau&#x27;s stand against the Klein government as &quot;courageous&quot; in his 2007 memoirs.

After Marleau left the Health portfolio, the Chrétien government allowed Alberta doctors to work in both the public and private sectors by selling services not deemed &quot;medically necessary&quot;. This did not technically constitute extra billing, as the services were not covered by medicare. Marleau opposed this decision.

;;Federal spending

The Chrétien government&#x27;s 1995 austerity budget reduced transfer payments to the provinces, and provided lump-sum financing for health and social spending in place of separate budgetary envelopes. Marleau argued that the new approach would free the provinces to spend more money on health, and allow them to better carry out the Canada Health Act&#x27;s provisions. Some critics argued that the change put medicare at risk, while others suggested it would jeopardize other social programs in favour of health spending.

;;Anti-smoking policy

The Chrétien government introduced a significant tax cut on tobacco in early 1994, to counter powerful smuggling rings that had emerged in Quebec. This decision was opposed by health professionals, on the grounds that it would lead to increased smoking rates among youth. Marleau personally opposed the strategy but could not prevent its implementation, a fact that undermined her reputation in the health community. She argued that the Chrétien government still favoured high tobacco taxes as a long-term strategy, and would seek to mitigate the cuts with a youth education program on the dangers of tobacco.

In April 1994, Marleau announced plans for legislation requiring that cigarettes be sold only in plain packages without corporate logos. This was strongly opposed by the tobacco industry, and ran into delays in the federal health committee. In June 1994, committee chair Roger Simmons issued a report indicating that Marleau&#x27;s proposal was viable, but should be deferred pending research as to whether it would actually reduce smoking levels. A May 1995 report found no conclusive proof that plain packaging would reduce smoking, but suggested it would be effective in deterring children from starting the habit.

Marleau&#x27;s plans suffered a setback later in 1995, when the Supreme Court of Canada unexpectedly struck down a law against tobacco advertising that had been passed by the Mulroney government in 1988. She expressed disappointment at the ruling, but later introduced a blueprint for new legislation that would ban all tobacco advertising and severely restrict tobacco companies from sponsoring arts and cultural events. The latter measure was opposed by some in the arts community, although polls showed that most Canadians supported the proposal.

Marleau left the Health portfolio before the legislation was introduced, and it was left to her successor David Dingwall to introduce modified legislation in late 1996. The resulting Tobacco Act was passed in early 1997.

;;Women&#x27;s health

Marleau established a section of Canada&#x27;s Health department specifically devoted to women&#x27;s issues, and introduced Canada&#x27;s first Centre of Excellence focused on Women&#x27;s Health. She brought forward a pilot project to better inform women about breast cancer in 1994, and later introduced a program to ensure that low-income pregnant women would have access to proper nutrition and prenatal care. In 1995, she announced the first conference on women&#x27;s health issues sponsored by both Canada and the United States.

Marleau received a report on new reproductive technologies shortly after her appointment as Health Minister, and welcomed its primary thesis that conception and child-bearing should not become for-profit industries. She reiterated this view in late 1994, when speaking about the need for legislation to prevent the sale of human sperm and eggs. She called for a voluntary moratorium on commercial surrogate motherhood contracts the following year, as a first step toward greater regulation. Some believed this approach fell short of the 1993 report&#x27;s recommendations, and expressed concern that it would be ineffective. Marleau later acknowledged that the voluntary approach was not successful, and indicated that legislation banning the sale of human eggs was forthcoming. Her successor introduced the legislation in June 1996.

;;Other

In March 1994, Marleau announced that her government would legalize cannabis for commercial hemp production. In the same year, however, she introduced a bill to create a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act that would increase penalties for simple possession of marijuana. This was criticized by many in the Liberal caucus. The bill passed committee hearings more-or-less intact, but was withdrawn from the House of Commons agenda in July 1995.

Marleau introduced some programs to alleviate health problems in aboriginal communities during her tenure as Health Minister. A deal between the federal government and the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs was delayed in early 1995, as the result of disagreements on whether First Nations health care was a treaty right.

The Chrétien government set up a 22-member National Forum on Health in 1994, with Chrétien as chair and Marleau as vice-chair. They were joined by twenty health professionals and private citizens, with a mandate that focused on matters such as the health costs associated with an aging society, patient choice and responsibility, and research priorities. Some provincial governments criticized the structure of the panel, and some in the media argued that Roy Romanow would have been a better choice for chair.

In addition to serving as Health Minister, Marleau also served on a committee of cabinet that focused on jobs and the economy.

;;Media coverage

Marleau&#x27;s performance as Health Minister was frequently criticized in the national press. A &quot;Globe and Mail&quot; report in April 1994 argued that the government&#x27;s tobacco tax cuts had made her the most undermined minister in Chrétien&#x27;s cabinet. Throughout 1994 and 1995, there was frequent speculation that she would be shifted to another portfolio. One of the few occasions in which the national media supported her was during her stand against Alberta&#x27;s semi-private clinics. Marleau later acknowledged that she was regarded as a weak minister after failing to stop the tobacco tax cut, but defended her overall performance by saying that she consistently stood up for public health care against powerful opposition.

;Minister of Public Works

Marleau was appointed as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Supply and Services on January 25, 1996. During her term, these positions were amalgamated into the position of Minister of Public Works and Government Services. Her first major act in this portfolio was to introduce Canada&#x27;s newly minted two-dollar coin at a Montreal civic landmark in February 1996.

;;Canada Post

In late 1996, George Radwanski submitted a report to the federal government on the future of Canada Post. Although he opposed privatisation, he argued that the crown corporation was &quot;needlessly and unfairly&quot; competing with the private sector in some areas. Marleau accepted Radwanski&#x27;s primary findings, and said that Canada Post would withdraw from delivering most store fliers and unaddressed junk mail. Canada Post responded by announcing that it would need to dismiss almost 10,000 part-time workers, and the Canadian Union of Postal Workers held a series of protests against the government. Marleau did not endorse Radwanski&#x27;s recommendation that Canada Post should concentrate solely on delivering regular mail, and also disagreed with his call for the government to sell Purolator Courier.

Shortly before the 1997 federal election, Marleau announced that the federal government would review Canada Post&#x27;s urban and rural delivery services and appoint an ombudsman to oversee the corporation.

;;Sponsorship program

In November 1996, Marleau and Jean Chrétien sought and received $34 million from the Treasury Board of Canada for sponsorship spending earmarked toward national unity. This followed a narrow federalist victory in the 1995 Quebec referendum, and was intended to reduce the threat of Quebec separatism. The program continued under Marleau&#x27;s successor, Alfonso Gagliano. Some of these funds were later discovered to have been misappropriated, leading to a national controversy known as the sponsorship scandal. Marleau subsequently testified before a public inquiry that she did not personally oversee the program, and that she had declined on procedural grounds to receive direct reports from sponsorship head Chuck Guité. Her account was confirmed by others involved in the program, and she was cleared of any wrongdoing by a commission led by Justice John Gomery.

;;Other

Marleau privatized the Canada Communications Group&#x27;s printing, warehousing and distribution operations in 1996, but took steps to ensure that jobs, wage levels and benefits would be protected after the sale. She later warned the Ontario provincial government of Mike Harris against its plans to download social housing to the municipalities, arguing that any such move would require Ottawa&#x27;s concurrence. Her successor formally rejected the Harris government&#x27;s plan in July 1997.

Marleau announced that the Department of Public Works would tighten its anti-discriminatory regulations in 1996, after an employee working on repairs at the Peace Tower complained of sexual discrimination. One of her last major acts as Public Works Minister was to officially open Confederation Bridge, a permanent land link between Prince Edward Island and the rest of Canada.

Reflecting on Marleau&#x27;s tenure as Public Works Minister in 2002, journalist Edward Greenspon wrote that she did not fit the profile of the &quot;pork barrel&quot; politician usually assigned to the portfolio and that her term in office was necessarily brief.

;Minister of International Cooperation

Marleau was re-elected without difficulty in the 1997 federal election, in which the Liberals won a second consecutive majority government. On June 11, 1997, she was appointed as Minister for International Co-operation and Minister responsible for La Francophonie. Shortly after her appointment, she called on Canada to take a stronger role in developing information technology services in the global south. She later wrote a piece supporting microcredit loans, arguing that they would promote women&#x27;s rights in under-developed countries.

Marleau announced in late 1997 that she would try to convince her cabinet colleagues not to proceed with a scheduled $150 million cut in international aid. She argued that the cut was initially planned as part of a deficit-fighting strategy, and said that Canada&#x27;s improved financial situation made it unnecessary. The budget cuts were eventually held to $60 million, and Marleau expressed hope that no further reductions would occur in the future.

Marleau introduced several aid programs during her tenure as International Cooperation Minister. She committed two million dollars to land mine removal in Afghanistan and Cambodia, and announced $23.8 million for infrastructure, water and environmental projects in Bangladesh. She pledged $500,000 to promoting dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians in June 1998, and promised $100 million over three to four years for Central American rebuilding efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Mitch. She also committed over fifty million dollars in new money for Kosovar refugees in March 1999.

Marleau gave permission for Canadian organizations to send direct famine relief to North Korea in 1997, during a period of widespread starvation in that country. Direct aid to North Korea is normally prohibited for geopolitical reasons, but Marleau and others argued that humanitarian intervention was necessary in this instance.

In April 1998, Marleau said that Canada would consider restoring foreign aid to Burma after ten years of sanctions for human rights abuses. She argued that Canada was often able to bring about quiet diplomacy with repressive regimes, after earning their trust through development work. Her comments about Burma were widely criticized, and she later indicated that the restoration of foreign aid was conditional on improved human rights conditions.

===Out of cabinet===

Marleau was dropped from cabinet on August 3, 1999. She became increasingly critical of Jean Chrétien&#x27;s leadership after being sent to the backbenches, and developed a reputation as a party . In 2000, she argued that Chrétien was not doing enough to protect medicare and called on the government to block Alberta&#x27;s plans to allow public funding for private, for-profit clinics. Some Liberal MPs were unhappy with Marleau&#x27;s remarks; when asked about the matter, Chrétien remarked, &quot;It looks like [bitterness], but I don&#x27;t know&quot;.

Prior to the 2000 federal election, Marleau aligned herself with a group of Liberal MPs who supported Paul Martin&#x27;s ambition to succeed Chrétien as party leader. Nothing came of this in the short term, and Chrétien led the Liberals to a third consecutive majority government. Marleau ran to become Speaker of the House of Commons in January 2001, but was eliminated on the first ballot. In July 2002, she became one of the first sixteen Liberal MPs to openly call on Chrétien to resign as party leader.

In May 2003, Marleau introduced the first-ever Older Adults Justice Act in Canada. It called for the creation of a national ombudsman on the rights of older Canadians, and sought to amend the Criminal Code to make it a criminal offence to knowingly target the elderly for criminal purposes. The legislation died at committee when parliament was dissolved for the 2004 federal election, and was re-introduced by Lloyd St. Amand in the next Parliament.

Paul Martin succeeded Jean Chrétien as Liberal Party leader and Prime Minister of Canada in December 2003, and led the Liberals to a minority government in the 2004 election. Marleau was re-elected to a fifth term, and was appointed as parliamentary secretary to the President of the Treasury Board and the minister responsible for the Canadian Wheat Board. There was speculation that she would be returned to cabinet in late 2005, but nothing came of this.

The Liberals were defeated in the 2006 federal election, as the Conservatives under Stephen Harper won a minority government. Marleau ran for Speaker again at the start of the new parliament, arguing that she would work to restore decorum during Question Period. She was defeated by incumbent speaker Peter Milliken.

Marleau endorsed Bob Rae in the 2006 Liberal Party leadership contest, and moved to the camp of Stéphane Dion when Rae was eliminated on the next-to-last ballot. She later became a prominent supporter of Dion&#x27;s Green Shift plan within the Liberal Party. Marleau chaired the House Standing Committee on Government Operations and Estimates in the 39th parliament, and was also elected chair of the Liberal Women&#x27;s Caucus in March 2008.

Marleau was defeated by New Democratic Party candidate Glenn Thibeault in the 2008 federal election. She later said that comments made by Sudbury Member of Provincial Parliament Rick Bartolucci shortly before election day played a &quot;crucial&quot; role in her defeat. Marleau later said that she would probably not seek re-election to the House of Commons.

The Conservative Party won a second minority government in the 2008 election. In December 2008, the Liberals and New Democrats announced plans to defeat the Conservatives on a motion of non-confidence and form a new coalition government. Marleau was a supporter of the proposed coalition, which dissolved when Stephen Harper prorogued parliament and Michael Ignatieff replaced Dion as Liberal leader.

==After politics==

Marleau was awarded the Bernadine Yackman Award from the Business and Professional Women&#x27;s Club of Greater Sudbury in March 2009.

She died on January 30, 2013, following a battle with colorectal cancer. Following her death, statements of tribute were issued by a variety of political figures in the Sudbury area, including former mayor and former Nickel Belt MP John Rodriguez, incumbent mayor Marianne Matichuk, incumbent Sudbury MP Glenn Thibeault and provincial MPPs Rick Bartolucci and France Gélinas, as well as by Paul Martin, Bob Rae, Leona Aglukkaq and Dwight Duncan.

==Electoral record==




Marleau was elected to the Sudbury City Council in 1980 and 1982. She also served on the Sudbury Regional Council.

<text>The Continental Bank of Canada is a chartered bank in Canada founded in 2013. A different bank operated under that name in the early 1980s.

==First Continental Bank==

The first Continental Bank had its origins in 1925 when the Industrial Acceptance Corporation was founded. It became IAC, a financing company, in 1970. Continental Bank of Canada was chartered in 1977 when IAC decided to expand the scope of operations, and began business in June 1979. It had its head office at 130 Adelaide St. West, Toronto. In 1981, it was Canada&#x27;s ninth-largest bank with 70 branches across the country, and assets at June 30 of $1.6 billion. Also in that year, Continental Bank absorbed its parent company, IAC.

In 1985, after a loss of depositor confidence and a run on deposits that affected several small banks, the bank received a line of Credit from the Bank of Canada. The bank and its remaining 55 branches were then acquired by Lloyds Bank Plc of the United Kingdom and became &quot;Lloyds Bank Canada&quot; in 1986. Continental Bank continued to exist as a chartered bank until 1996 because of a dispute with Revenue Canada. Lloyds Bank sold its Canadian operations to HongKong Bank of Canada in 1990, which became HSBC Bank Canada.

==Second Continental Bank==
In 2013 a new bank named &quot;Continental Bank of Canada&quot; was chartered. Before being chartered, the company had been operating as Continental Currency Exchange. It continues to operate under that name and focus on providing foreign exchange services through its 19 branches across Ontario.

<doc id="912581" wikidata="Q1038470" url="?curid=912581" title="Luis Sojo">
<text>Luis Beltrán Sojo Sojo ( ; ; born January 3, 1965) is a Venezuelan former professional baseball infielder for the Toronto Blue Jays, California Angels, Seattle Mariners, Pittsburgh Pirates and New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. Sojo filled a role as a utility infielder and won four World Series championships with the Yankees. After he retired he became the manager of the Venezuelan national baseball team. He is a member of the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.

==Professional career==
===Toronto Blue Jays (1990)===
Sojo signed with the Blue Jays on January 3, 1986. Called up late in the 1990 season, Sojo played 33 games for the Toronto Blue Jays. He went 18-for-80 (.225).

===California Angels (1991–1992)===
After the 1990 season, the Blue Jays traded Sojo, Junior Félix, and a player to be named later (Ken Rivers) to the California Angels for Devon White, Willie Fraser, and Marcus Moore. Sojo played 219 games for the Angels over two years. In 1991, he had 19 sacrifice hits, a career-high.

===Return to Toronto (1993)===
After the 1992 season, the Angels traded Sojo back to the Blue Jays for Kelly Gruber.

Sojo played only 19 games in 1993, and was only 8 for 47 (.170), although he managed to collect six runs batted in. He earned his first of five World Series rings. On October 15, he was granted free agency.

===Seattle Mariners (1994–1996)===
Sojo hit .277 over 63 games in the strike-shortened 1994 season, while also hitting 6 home runs, then a career-best. He was once again awarded a starting role in 1995, where he played in 102 games, his second-highest career total. He finished the season with 98 hits, and seven home runs, tying a career best. In the 1995 American League Division Series against the Yankees, he played in all five games, going 5-for-20 with 3 runs batted in. He continued his hot streak into the 1995 American League Championship Series, again going 5-for-20 as the Mariners lost to the Cleveland Indians.

Sojo began the 1996 season with the Mariners, hitting just .211 (52-for-247) over 77 games.

===First stint with the Yankees (1996–1999)===
The New York Yankees claimed Sojo off of waivers on August 22, 1996. He began his Yankee career 11-for-40 (.275) while only striking out four times with one walk. After playing only 18 games with the Yankees, he was added to the postseason roster. He did not receive a plate appearance during the 1996 American League Division Series, but played as a defensive replacement and pinch runner. He did, however, play in the 1996 American League Championship Series, going 1 for 5 over 3 games. Despite his limited playing time in that postseason, he played in five of the six games of the 1996 World Series, going 3 for 5 (.600) with a double and a run batted in. Sojo earned his second World Series ring when the Yankees defeated the Atlanta Braves.

On January 9, 1997, Sojo re-signed with the Yankees. In 1997, Sojo began to see his playing time decrease. He played in only 77 games, hitting .307. Sojo&#x27;s 25 runs batted in was his most as a Yankee. He did not play at all in the 1997 postseason as the Yankees were defeated by the Cleveland Indians. He was granted free agency on October 31, and again re-signed with the Yankees on November 12, 1997.

During the 1998 season, Sojo appeared in 54 games, hitting .231. He had 34 hits and 14 runs batted in during the season, but did not play in the 1998 American League Division Series. He rejoined the team for the Championship Series, where he played in one game. He did not play in the World Series, but received a ring regardless.

In 1999, Sojo played in just 49 games, less than the previous year, but hit .252 and again missed the Division Series. He re-joined the team for the 1999 American League Championship Series, where he had only one at-bat. He was not much of a force in the World Series that year either, with just one at-bat, but nevertheless received a World Series ring. He was released on November 10.

===Pittsburgh Pirates (2000)===
On January 9, 2000, Sojo signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He played in 61 games and hit .284 with five home runs before being traded to the Yankees on August 7 in exchange for Chris Spurling.

===Second stint with the Yankees (2000–2001)===
Sojo played in 34 games after being traded and hit .288, earning him a spot on the postseason roster. Playing in all five games of the American League Division Series, he was 3 for 16 with 5 RBIs and 3 hits. Playing in all six games of the 2000 American League Championship Series, he went 6 for 23. In Game 5 of the 2000 World Series, Sojo turned from a role player to a hero. With the score tied at two with two outs in the ninth inning, Sojo singled to center, driving in Jorge Posada to break the tie with Scott Brosius also scoring on the errant throw to home plate. The Yankees won their 26th World Series, their third consecutive, and fourth in the Joe Torre era. Sojo obtained his fifth World Series ring, (4 with New York and one with the Blue Jays).

On November 7, Sojo was released again and re-signed exactly one month later on December 7. In 2001, he played in 39 games, collecting only 13 hits, but proved productive, as he drove in nine runs. After missing the American League Division Series, he received one at-bat in the American League Championship Series. He played in two of the seven games in that year&#x27;s World Series, going 1-for-3 with a run batted in.

==Retirement and first coaching stint (2002)==
In 2002, Sojo failed to earn a spot on the Yankees roster, and retired from playing Major League Baseball. He then made his managerial debut with the Yankees Double A affiliate Norwich Navigators, and led the team to its first Eastern League Championship.

==Return to the Yankees (2003)==
Having left the Navigators, Sojo was invited to the Yankees Old Timers Day in 2003. During the annual Old Timers&#x27; Game, he hit the game-winning home run off Ron Guidry. Later that season, the Yankees re-signed Sojo as an active player when Jeter had an injury. and he appeared in three games to conclude the season.

In 13 seasons, Sojo batted .261 (671-for-2571) with 36 home runs, 261 RBI, 300 runs, 103 doubles, 12 triples, and 28 stolen bases in 848 games.

==Post playing career==
After his playing career, he served as the New York Yankees third base coach for the 2004 and 2005 seasons. He was the manager for the Class A Advanced Tampa Yankees from 2006 to 2009, before being relieved on February 2, 2010. Sojo also managed the Venezuelan national baseball team in the 2006, 2009, and the 2013 World Baseball Classic. On January 10, 2011, the New York Yankees announced that they were bringing Sojo back to manage the Tampa Yankees.

After a disappointing 2013 season for the Tampa Yankees, the Yankees dismissed Sojo. He spent the 2014 season as the third base coach for the AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders before being fired and starting in 2015 he served as the assistant field coordinator for the Yankees. In 2017 he was named manager of the Gulf Coast League Yankees East.

In 2019, Sojo was named new manager of the Spanish national baseball team.

==Skills==
Not classically athletic, he was a natural shortstop in the minors, but took on an expanded role in emergency situations, initially and most commonly as a second baseman, and eventually as a third baseman, first baseman and left fielder as well.

Sojo had limited power and did not draw many walks, but he was a good contact hitter, especially for someone who made a habit of falling behind in the count during his minor league tenure. He did show an ability to put the ball in play with a low strikeout rate (one for 13 at-bats). Some of his great contributions came when going to the opposite field in hit and run situations and with infield hits. An avid bunter, he led the league in sacrificial hits in 1991 (19). Though not a threat as a base stealer, he was a competent base runner. In the field, Sojo had a good range and a good arm, showing quick hands and slick moves.

==Highlights==

* Hit a two-outs bases-clearing broken-bat double against California Angels Mark Langston to lead Seattle to its very first AL West division title, with four runs scoring on the play: Sojo took third on the throw to the plate, and scored after the frustrated Langston&#x27;s relay ended up in the backstop (1995)

<text>The Molsons Bank was a Canadian bank founded in Montreal, Quebec, by brothers William (1793–1875) and John Molson, Jr. (1787–1860), the sons of brewery magnate John Molson.

==Operations==
In 1837, the bank opened and issued its first banknotes. In 1850, it was constituted under the &quot;Free Banking Act&quot; passed by the parliament of the Province of Canada. To increase its powers and its revenue, the bank was incorporated in 1855. It was granted a charter on May 19, 1855 in Montreal allowing it to operate its bank in the same way as other banks. With its head office at the corner of St. James &amp; St. Peter streets (today known as Saint-Jacques and Saint-Pierre streets) in Montreal, it continued in operation until 1925 when it merged with the Bank of Montreal.

==Branches==
The bank operated 125 branches primarily in Quebec and Ontario. It also had branches in western Canada and agents in the US and UK.

The Bank of Montreal at 3 King Street South, Waterloo, Ontario, is a former branch of the Molson Bank that was built in 1914 and is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.

<doc id="912592" wikidata="Q1086798" url="?curid=912592" title="Hiroko Suzuki">
<text>, née , (born 1974) is a Japanese politician, professional wrestling valet, occasional professional wrestler and professional wrestling promoter best known in the United States for her work with World Wrestling Entertainment on its &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand under the ring name Hiroko. She graduated from Meiji University, and became an announcer of Fukushima Central Television. She is married to professional wrestler Kenzo Suzuki.

==Professional wrestling career==
===World Wrestling Entertainment (2004–2005)===
On June 10, 2004, Hiroko made her debut as the geisha valet and translator for her real-life husband Kenzo Suzuki on World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)&#x27;s SmackDown! brand. Her trademark phrase was &quot;You cheer Kenzo Suzuki on to the victory!&quot;

In November 2004, Hiroko began feuding with Torrie Wilson and numerous catfights took place between the two female wrestlers and Hiroko even wanted to fight her in a bra and panties match. The bra and panties match Hiroko wanted was later changed to a kimono match. In December 2004, backstage during a photo shooting, Torrie Wilson was given a bouquet of flowers from Kenzo. This angered Hiroko and stripped Torrie to her underwear, this made Torrie chase, and eventually caught up to, Hiroko and strip her to her underwear as well. On an episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; held in Japan airing February 10, 2005, The kimono match was then held. Hiroko lost and got stripped to her bra and panties during the match. Hiroko and Kenzo were traded to the RAW brand on June 30, 2005 at the end of the 2005 Draft Lottery. However, they were both released by the WWE on July 6, 2005 without ever appearing on RAW. The move was seen as cost-cutting since several other wrestlers were released at the same time, as well as over the course of several weeks.

=== Hustle (2005–2006) ===
Hiroko and her husband returned to Japan, where they competed for the off-beat Hustle promotion. In a match on December 25, 2005, both Hiroko &amp; Kenzo were defeated by the team of Liosazer &amp; Riser Glen (of Toho&#x27;s Choseishin Series).

In late 2005, Hiroko Suzuki became the General Manager for HUSTLE. On March 5, 2006, during a match between Kenzo Suzuki and Toshiaki Kawada, Hiroko turned on Kenzo and slapped him in the face, causing him to lose the match, and turning face in the process.

=== Independent circuit (2024) ===
Hiroko made her first wrestling appearance since 2006, as a participant in the 2024 SHW Rumblejack event. She participated in the Rumblejack Match, where it was eventually won by Carlie Bravo. 

==Political career==
In 2015, Suzuki was elected to the Funabashi city council.

==Personal life==
Suzuki is married to Kenzo Suzuki, whom she accompanied as his valet during his time with the WWE.

<doc id="912593" wikidata="Q236586" url="?curid=912593" title="Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh">
<text>Princess Mary, Duchess of Gloucester and Edinburgh (25 April 1776 – 30 April 1857) was the eleventh child and fourth daughter of King George III and his consort Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

She married her first cousin, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, when both were 40, and was his widow in later life. In her last years, her niece Queen Victoria was on the throne as the fourth monarch during Mary&#x27;s life, after her father and two of her brothers, George IV and William IV. Dying aged 81 at Gloucester House, Weymouth, Mary was the longest-lived and last survivor of George III&#x27;s fifteen children (thirteen of whom lived to adulthood).

==Early life and family==

Princess Mary was born on 25 April 1776, at Buckingham Palace, London. Her father was the reigning British monarch, George III. Her mother was Queen Charlotte, the daughter of Charles, reigning Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.

Mary was baptised on 19 May 1776, in the Great Council Chamber at St. James&#x27;s Palace, by Frederick Cornwallis, The Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were:
*Landgrave Frederick of Hesse-Cassel (her first cousin once-removed, for whom The Earl of Hertford, Lord Chamberlain stood proxy)
*The Duchess of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg (wife of her first cousin once-removed, for whom The Duchess of Argyll, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, was proxy)
*Princess Charles of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her third cousin once-removed, for whom The Dowager Countess of Effingham, Lady of the Bedchamber to The Queen, stood proxy).
The king was a devoted father, finding time to regularly visit the royal nursery. Engaging in active play with his young children, he behaved quite informally in contrast to the dignified Queen Charlotte, who had more difficulty abandoning the formal behaviour expected of their class. Despite her outer reserve, however, Charlotte took a role as conscientious as her husband in their children&#x27;s upbringing. For the royal princesses, the queen carefully oversaw their welfare, education, and development of moral values. Faced with less time due to her public duties and close marriage to the king, she appointed Lady Charlotte Finch to manage the royal nursery and administer her ideas.

According to Flora Fraser, Mary was considered to be the most beautiful daughter of George III; Fraser calls her a &quot;bland beauty&quot;. Mary danced a minuet for the first time in public at the age of sixteen in June 1791, during a court ball given for the king&#x27;s birthday. In the spring of 1792 she made her official debut at court. Around 1796 Mary fell in love with the Dutch Prince Frederick, while he and his family lived in exile in London. Frederik was a son of William V, Prince of Orange, the Dutch stadholder, and younger brother to the future King William I of the Netherlands. However Frederik and Mary never married because George III stipulated that her elder sisters should marry first. In 1799 Prince Frederik died of an infection while serving in the army, and Mary was allowed to go into official mourning.

Mary&#x27;s youngest sister and beloved companion Princess Amelia called her &quot;Mama&#x27;s tool&quot; because of her obedient nature. Amelia&#x27;s premature death in 1810 devastated her sister, who had nursed her devotedly during her painful illness.

Princess Mary was quite close to her eldest brother, and she shared his antipathy toward his wife, their cousin Caroline of Brunswick. When the latter left for Italy, Princess Mary congratulated her brother &quot;on the prospect of a good riddance. Heaven grant that she may not return again and that we may never see more of her.&quot;

==Marriage and later life==

Mary&#x27;s upbringing was very sheltered and she spent most of her time with her parents and sisters. King George and Queen Charlotte were keen to shelter their children, particularly the girls. Mary, however, married on 22 July 1816, to her first cousin, Prince William Frederick, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh, the son of George III&#x27;s brother, Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh. Both were aged 40. On their wedding day, Mary&#x27;s brother, The Prince Regent, raised the bridegroom&#x27;s style from &quot;Highness&quot; to &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, an attribute to which Mary&#x27;s rank as daughter of the King already entitled her.

William Frederick had initially sought to marry Mary&#x27;s niece Princess Charlotte of Wales. Charlotte, while interested, was berated by her father, who subsequently also expressed his displeasure to Gloucester and the courtship ended. The historian A. W. Purdue suggests that Mary&#x27;s motive for marrying her cousin sprang from her dislike of Queen Charlotte&#x27;s restrictive household. Princess Charlotte observed that the duke &quot;is much in love, &amp; and tells me he is the happiest creature on earth. I won&#x27;t say [Mary] does as much, but being her own mistress, having her own house, &amp; being able to walk in the streets all delights her in their several ways.&quot;

The couple lived at Bagshot Park, but after William&#x27;s death she moved to White Lodge in Richmond Park. They had no children together.
==Death==
Princess Mary died on 30 April 1857 at Gloucester House, Mayfair, aged 81. She was the last-surviving and longest-lived child of King George III and Queen Charlotte.

==Arms==
As of 1789, as a daughter of the sovereign, Mary had use of the arms of the kingdom, differenced by a &quot;label argent of three points, the centre point bearing a rose gules, the outer points each bearing a canton gules&quot;.

<text>Crewkerne ( ) is a town and electoral ward in south Somerset, England, southwest of Yeovil and east of Chard. The civil parish of West Crewkerne includes the hamlets of Coombe, Woolminstone and Henley, and borders the county of Dorset to the south. The town is on the main headwater of the River Parrett, A30 road and West of England Main Line railway, in modern times the slower route between the capital and the southwest peninsula, having been eclipsed by the Taunton route.

The earliest written record of Crewkerne is in the 899 will of Alfred the Great who left it to his youngest son Æthelweard. After the Norman conquest it was held by William the Conqueror and in the Domesday Survey of 1086 was described as a royal manor. Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth demonstrated in the fifteenth century Church of St Bartholomew. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.

Local ecological sites include the Bincombe Beeches Local Nature Reserve and the Millwater biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. Crewkerne railway station is served by South Western Railway. There are local supermarkets and local shops, and some local industry. The town is the birthplace of several notable people and has varied cultural and sporting facilities including those at Wadham Community School.

==History==

The name Crewkerne is thought to be derived from &quot;Cruc-aera&quot;; from the British &quot;cruc&quot; – a spur of a hill, and the Old English &quot;aera&quot; – a house, especially a storehouse. The town was known as &quot;Crocern&quot;, or &quot;Cruaern&quot; in the 899 will of Alfred the Great when he left it to his younger son Æthelweard, and by 1066 the manor was held by Edith Swanneck, mistress of King Harold. After the Norman conquest the Domesday Survey of 1086 shows the so-named manor was feudally royal, a possession of William the Conqueror, and the church estate was given to the Abbaye-aux-Hommes in Caen, Normandy.

In 1499, John de Combe, a precentor of Exeter Cathedral and former vicar of Crewkerne, founded Crewkerne Grammar School. The school survived until 1904.

The parish was part of the hundred of Crewkerne.

Crewkerne Castle was possibly a Norman motte castle on a mound to the north-west of the town, which is known as Castle Hill. The town grew up in the late mediaeval period around the textile industry, its wealth preserved in its fifteenth century parish church. It later prospered as a coaching stop in the Georgian period.

The Manor Farmhouse in Henley was built from hamstone in the early 17th century, but possibly incorporates medieval fragments. The building is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building. During the 18th and 19th centuries the main industry was cloth making, including webbing, and sails for the Royal Navy.

==Governance==

The town council takes charge of some local issues so sets an annual precept (local rate) to cover its costs and makes annual accounts for public scrutiny. It evaluates local planning applications; it works with the police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The current council, elected on 5 May 2022, consists of six Liberal Democrats, and five independents.

The town falls within the non-metropolitan district of South Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been Crewkerne Urban District. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. This electoral ward includes Misterton and at the 2011 Census had a population of 7,826.

Crewkerne Town Hall occupies part of the Victoria Hall in the Market Square. The Hamstone building was rebuilt around 1742, altered in 1836, when a south piazza was added after the demolition of the shambles. In 1848-9 it became a museum, reading room and library and was remodelled in 1900 by Thomas Benson of Yeovil to create shops and offices. It is a Grade II listed building.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, the library, roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service.

Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around .

==Religious sites==

St Bartholomew&#x27;s Parish Church stands on high ground to the west of the town. The first Saxon church was founded before the end of the 9th century as a &quot;minster&quot;, or main church of a Saxon royal estate that included an area which later became the parishes of Seaborough, Wayford and Misterton. This church was replaced after the Norman Conquest with a larger stone cruciform building, with a central tower. This was almost completely rebuilt and enlarged in the late 15th and early 16th centuries. This is, for the most part, the church building visible today. It is an excellent example of the Perpendicular style with many unusual and individual features. These include the west front, the nave, the six-light aisle windows and the Tudor-style chapels and windows in the north east corner. The building material is golden-coloured Ham Hill stone, quarried nearby. There is a notable pair of &#x27;green man&#x27; carvings within the church.

No major alterations have been made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, but there have been many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808–11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church&#x27;s architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. The pews date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

Crewkerne also contains one of very few Unitarian chapels left in the West Country, Crewkerne Unitarian Church, a tiny chapel tucked away on Hermitage Street. The Methodist church on South Street is shared by Roman Catholic and Methodist congregations, following the closure and proposed redevelopment of St Peter&#x27;s Catholic Church. Christ Church, a chapel of ease to St Bartholomew&#x27;s, was built on South Street in 1852–54. It was declared redundant in 1969 and demolished in 1975. It is now the site of the residential Christchurch Court.

==Education==

The primary schools in Crewkerne are St. Bartholomew&#x27;s on Kithill, Ashlands on North Street and Maiden Beech Primary Academy on Lyme Road.

Crewkerne Grammar School was at DeCombe House, until it closed in the late 1960s, to combine into St Martin&#x27;s School long on Abbey Street (having moved from the high street in the late 1970s). Its Senior and Juniors School closed in 2003, leaving a pre-school nursery. Its gym was on Gouldsbrook Terrace, converted since.

Wadham School has students from 11 to 18 years old and includes those travelling from surrounding villages. In November 2005, Wadham was placed into Special measures after failing an Ofsted inspection. In June 2007 the school successfully left these, after a full Ofsted inspection showed ample progress.

==Culture==

Crewkerne and District Museum is part of a wider heritage centre which includes local archives and a meeting room. The museum opened in 2000 in an old house with an 18th-century frontage. It was restored with the help of grants from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Somerset County Council, South Somerset District Council and Crewkerne Town Council. The development of Crewkerne during the 18th and 19th centuries, with particular emphasis on the flax and linen industry is illustrated with a permanent display. Other collections relate to local archaeology, Coins and Medals, Costume and Textiles, Fine Art, Music, Personalities, Science and Technology, Social History, Weapons and War.

==Sport==
The Crewkerne Aqua Centre also provides swimming pool and fitness gym facilities to the town, located on the grounds next to Henhayes Park, which used to be the Grammar Schools Playing fields. St. Martins School retained the use of the playing fields until the junior section was closed in 2003, as regular sports days were a tradition dating back to the Grammar school era in the town.

<text>Shown here are all the major rivers and tributaries of Ireland with their lengths (in kilometres and miles). Starting with the Northern Ireland rivers, and going in a clockwise direction, the rivers (and tributaries) are listed in regard to their entry into the different seas: the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Also shown are two tables. &quot;Table 1&quot; shows the longest rivers in Ireland with their lengths (in kilometres and miles), the counties they flow through, and their catchment areas (in square kilometres). &quot;Table 2&quot; shows the largest rivers in Ireland (by mean flow) in cubic metres per second.

The longest river in Ireland is the River Shannon, at . The river develops into three lakes along its course, Lough Allen, Lough Ree and Lough Derg. Of these, Lough Derg is the largest. The Shannon enters the Atlantic Ocean at the Shannon Estuary. Other major rivers include the River Liffey, River Lee, River Swilly, River Foyle, River Lagan, River Erne, River Blackwater, River Nore, River Suir, River Barrow (The Three Sisters), River Bann, River Slaney, River Boyne, River Moy and River Corrib.

== Longest Irish Rivers (with Basin areas) ==
Lengths obtained from the Ordnance Survey of Ireland: &quot;Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958&quot; (Table of Reference), and for the rivers Bann and Erne – &quot;Notes on River Basins&quot; by Robert A. Williams

TABLE 1

a 
* The length of the River Shannon from the Shannon Pot to Limerick City is with a basin area of 11,700 km2.
* The River Shannon&#x27;s overall length (to Loop Head), using the Owenmore River (County Cavan) as source, is , 11 km (7 mi) longer than the Shannon Pot source.
* The River Shannon&#x27;s overall length (to Loop Head), using the Boyle River&#x27;s furthest source, is , making the Boyle-Shannon river the longest natural stream flow (source to sea) in Ireland, 31.6 km (19.5 mi) longer than the Shannon Pot source.
* The River Shannon is a traditional freshwater river for just about 45% of its total length. Excluding the tidal estuary from its total length of , if one also excludes the lakes (L. Derg , L. Ree , L. Allen plus L. Boderg, L. Bofin, L. Forbes, L. Corry) from the Shannon&#x27;s freshwater flow of , the Shannon as a freshwater river is only about long.

b 
* The total basin area of the Three Sisters (Barrow, Nore and Suir) is 9,207 km2.

c
* The traditional length given for the River Bann is 80 miles (129 km) which is the combined total length of Upper and Lower Bann rivers and doesn&#x27;t include Lough Neagh.
* The total length of the Ulster Blackwater from its source to the sea via L. Neagh and the Lower Bann is 186.3 km (115.75 mi), surpassed, in Ireland, only by the Shannon and Barrow rivers. This is the longest stream flow (source to sea) in Ulster.

d 
* The total basin area of the 6 km River Corrib is 3,138 km2
* The total length of the River Robe&#x27;s journey from its source near Ballyhaunis to Galway Bay (via Lough Mask, Cong canal and river, Lough Corrib and River Corrib) is . This is the longest stream flow (source to sea) within the Corrib Basin.

== Largest Irish Rivers (by flow) ==
 TABLE 2

a The River Shannon&#x27;s 209 m3/s is to Limerick City (Catchment area: 11,700 km2). If the discharges from all of the rivers and streams into the Shannon Estuary (including the rivers Feale 34.6m3/s, Maigue 15.6m3/s, Fergus 25.7m3/s, and Deel 7.4m3/s) are added to the discharge at Limerick giving a total catchment of 16,865 km2, the total discharge of the River Shannon at its mouth at Loop Head reaches 300 m3/s

b The River Bann&#x27;s 92 m3/s is to Movanagher Gauging station (Basin area 5209.8 km2). The 102.5 m3/s is based on the total basin area of 5808 km2

c The Three Sisters (Barrow, Nore &amp; Suir) total flow into Waterford Harbour is 154 m3/s and the combined flow of the Barrow and Nore rivers is 86 m3/s before joining the river Suir near Waterford City.

<doc id="912604" wikidata="Q335825" url="?curid=912604" title="George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough">
<text>George Spencer, 4th Duke of Marlborough, (26 January 1739 – 29 January 1817), styled Marquess of Blandford until 1758, was a British courtier, nobleman, and politician from the Spencer family. He served as Lord Chamberlain between 1762 and 1763 and as Lord Privy Seal between 1763 and 1765. He is the great-great-great grandfather of Sir Winston Churchill.

==Background and education==
Styled by the courtesy title Marquess of Blandford from birth, he was the eldest son of Charles Spencer, 3rd Duke of Marlborough, and the Honourable Elizabeth Trevor, daughter of Thomas Trevor, 2nd Baron Trevor. His siblings were Charles, Diana and Elizabeth.

==Personal traits and characteristics==
According to George III, who mentioned it to Fanny Burney, the Duke suffered from severe red-green colourblindness. As he was unable to tell scarlet from green, Fanny, therefore, remarked that this was unlucky for someone in possession of so sumptuous a home as Blenheim Palace.

==Career==
Marlborough entered the Coldstream Guards in 1755 as an Ensign, becoming a Captain with the 20th Regiment of Foot the following year. After inheriting the dukedom in 1758, Marlborough took his seat in the House of Lords in 1760, becoming Lord-Lieutenant of Oxfordshire in that same year. The following year, he bore the sceptre with the cross at the coronation of George III. In 1762, he was made Lord Chamberlain as well as a Privy Counsellor, and after a year, resigned from this appointment to become Lord Privy Seal, a post he held until 1765. An amateur astronomer, he built a private observatory at his residence, Blenheim Palace. He kept up a lively scientific correspondence with Hans Count von Brühl, another non-academic astronomer.

The Duke was made a Knight of the Garter in 1768, and was elected to the Royal Society in 1786.

==Family==
Marlborough married Lady Caroline Russell (1743–1811), daughter of John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford, in 1762, by whom he had eight children:

*Lady Caroline Spencer (1763–1813), married Henry Agar-Ellis, 2nd Viscount Clifden and had issue, including George Agar-Ellis, 1st Baron Dover.
*Lady Elizabeth Spencer (1764–1812), married her cousin John Spencer (a grandson of the 3rd Duke of Marlborough) and had issue.
*George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough (1766–1840)
*Lady Charlotte Spencer (1769–1802), married Rev. Edward Nares and had issue.
*Lord Henry John Spencer (1770–1795)
*Lady Anne Spencer (1773–1865), married Cropley Ashley-Cooper, 6th Earl of Shaftesbury and had issue.
*Lady Amelia Spencer (1774–1829), married Henry Pytches Boyce.
*Lord Francis Almeric Spencer (1779–1845), created Baron Churchill in 1815.

The Duchess of Marlborough died at Blenheim Palace in November 1811, aged 68. The Duke of Marlborough died at Blenheim Palace in January 1817, aged 78, and was buried there.

<text>Cuckfield ( ) is a village and civil parish in the Mid Sussex District of West Sussex, England, on the southern slopes of the Weald. It lies south of London, north of Brighton, and east northeast of the county town of Chichester. Nearby towns include Haywards Heath to the southeast and Burgess Hill to the south. It is surrounded on the other sides by the parish of Ansty and Staplefield formerly known as Cuckfield Rural.

Aumale in Normandy has been a twin town since 1993 and Karlstadt in Bavaria since 1998.

Cuckfield is known locally for its idiosyncratic system of mayoral voting; unlimited numbers of votes can be purchased for the price of one penny each, with the winner receiving the most votes. The position is purely honorary and the money raised supports local charities.

== History ==

Before the modern local government system came into operation in the late 19th century it was described as being &quot;in the hundred of Buttinghill, in the rape of Lewes&quot;. The civil parish covers an area of 431.58 ha (1066 acres), and had a population of 3,266 persons in the 2001 census, increasing to 3,500 at the 2011 Census.

The origin of the name, Cuckfield (earlier spelled Kukefeld, Cucufeld, and Cucufelda), is debated but it is generally associated with the cuckoo which is the village emblem.

The village grew as a market town; and an important coaching stop between London and Brighton, since it lay on the turnpike. In 1820, 50 coaches a day were passing through; but when the railway to Brighton was to be constructed in the 1840s, local landowners objected to its projected route: it was therefore built through neighbouring Haywards Heath instead. The village lost its importance as a result. Today the A272 road also bypasses the village centre.

It became an urban district in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894, and was greatly enlarged in 1934 under a County Review Order by adding part of Chailey Rural District, Cuckfield Rural District (including the parish of Lindfield) and Haywards Heath Urban District.

The Parish Council, Cuckfield Museum and village library reside within the Queen&#x27;s Hall, built in 1897 to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The parish church, dedicated to the Holy Trinity, has Norman foundations, although the building itself is 13th century. The lych gates are listed buildings and several of the stained glass windows as well as the pulpit and the ceiling&#x27;s painting were designed by Charles Eamer Kempe (1837–1907).

In 1822, Mary Ann Mantell, wife of Gideon Mantell, found the first known iguanodon fossils among many others close to Cuckfield at Whitemans Green, where a monument to him now stands though the quarry from where he acquired them is long gone. He also features in the town&#x27;s museum. Other attractions include the Elizabethan stately home, Cuckfield Park, to the west of the village. Cuckfield Park is reputedly haunted by its former resident Anne Pritchard Sergison, who was known to the locals as &#x27;Wicked Dame Sergison&#x27;, and who died in 1748. Bonfire Night celebrations are held here. Another Elizabethan house, Ockenden Manor, is a hotel and restaurant which has had one star from the Michelin Guide in 2001 and again 2004–2016.

== Schools ==

Cuckfield is home to Warden Park Secondary Academy, one of the main secondary schools serving the Haywards Heath area and to Holy Trinity CE (A) Primary School, Cuckfield. The latter is one of the oldest schools in the country; it was founded in the early 1500s as the local grammar school. The founder was Edward Flower, a London merchant tailor in about 1512 and endowed by his will in 1521 with lands in Westerham and £100 to be laid out in other lands. Other endowments were added, but in 1589, the original endowment was leased at a perpetual rent of £20. In consequence in 1819, the schoolmaster had an income of a mere £28.8s.0d. In 1844, as a result of local discontent, the Court of Chancery made a scheme reorganising the school like a National School and the existing National School (established in 1812) was discontinued. The teaching of Latin and Greek were discontinued and the fees fixed at a maximum of a shilling. The teacher no longer had to be a clergyman.

In 1886, the National Society gave £15 and the school formally became a National School. A proposal to rebuild the school between 1935 and 1950, and money collected for this was returned to the donors. The school was reorganised again in 1964 under the Chichester Diocesan Board of Finance. In 1991, the school was rebuilt on a new site. The old school was acquired by the church in 1992 for use as a church hall.

<text>Abertay University is a public university in the city of Dundee, Scotland. In 1872, Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet of Kilmaron, left a bequest for the establishment of a mechanics&#x27; institute in Dundee and the Dundee Institute of Technology was formed in 1888. As early as 1902 it was recognised by the Scottish Education Department as an educational hub, and was one of the first to be designated a central institution, akin to an &quot;industrial university&quot;. Abertay gained university status in 1994.

Abertay launched the world&#x27;s first computer games degree in 1997 and in 2017 held a programme of events celebrating 20 Years of Games. Abertay was also the first to offer a degree in Ethical Hacking, starting in 2006.

==History==

The following history to 1988 provides a summary account that relies primarily on the book published by Dundee Institute of Technology in 1989, &#x27;The First Hundred Years: 1888-1988&#x27;. Where additional sources have been used, post 1988, these have been cited accordingly.

===The Baxter bequest (1872)===

In 1872 Sir David Baxter, 1st Baronet of Kilmaron, died and bequeathed £20,000 (£ million adjusting for inflation) for the establishment of a mechanics&#x27; institute in Dundee. The Baxter bequest was intended to create an educational establishment permitting young (male) working mechanics and other craftsmen to better themselves. After some years of delay the trustees finalised a scheme and met the conditions of the bequest and the Dundee Technical Institute opened on 15 October 1888 in grounds, purchased from University College, Dundee, adjacent to Small&#x27;s Wynd, Dundee. Initially 238 students enrolled and classes were conducted based on the syllabus of the Government Science and Art Department of South Kensington and the City &amp; Guilds of London Institute. Subjects were primarily scientific and technical although applied art was also taught, and jute spinning and textile design were soon added to the portfolio.

In 1901 the Dundee Technical Institute enrolled 723 part-time students and was one of the first education hubs to be recognised as a &#x27;central institution&#x27; by the Scotch Education Department. In 1906 a new site in Bell Street, Dundee was purchased to build a larger complex to accommodate a growing student population. In 1911 the completed complex was formally opened as the Dundee Technical College &amp; School of Art. The portfolio had by now expanded again to include marine engineering and navigation.

The First World War retarded enrolments and growth but the vocational nature of the institute meant that its classes were highly relevant to the war effort. Records show that the first women students enrolled in 1914. After the war, the institute continued to expand adding a new school of pharmacy, and more specialist classes in engineering and building. Commercial classes in finance, economics and accounting were added to support trade at home and abroad.

===The Duncan of Jordanstone bequest (1909)===

In 1909 James Duncan of Jordanstone left £60,000 (£ million adjusting for inflation) to establish an art college in Dundee. It was only after a lengthy legal battle surrounding this bequest and the right of the existing college to spend the money, that a new scheme was entered into in 1933 permitting the establishment of the Dundee Institute of Art and Technology. The scheme allowed for separate technical and art colleges under a single governance framework. Plans for a new art college were drawn up in 1937. However, owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, plans were delayed and construction did not begin until 1953. The college of art became a formally separate institution, known as the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, in 1975, remaining independent until 1994 when it became part of the University of Dundee.

===First degrees (1951)===

After the Second World War enrolments and the scope of delivery continued to expand, as did the reputation of the institute. By 1951 the institute was teaching courses that led to examinations for the external degrees of the University of London in pharmacy, mechanical, civil, and electrical engineering. In 1955 the National Council for Technological Awards was established and validated diplomas in technology which were equivalent in standard if not in name to honours degrees. In 1963 the Robbins Committee on Higher Education set out the principle that higher education should be available to all who wanted it and were suitably well qualified. The Committee recommended that the government should expand higher education in the UK, particularly in science and technology.

===University status (1994)===

Abertay University was created in 1994, under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992, granting the title &quot;University of Abertay Dundee&quot; to the Dundee Institute of Technology. Since 2014 the university has promoted itself as Abertay University. The university&#x27;s name was formally changed to Abertay University by an Order of Council on 1 September 2019.

Abertay was the first university in the world to offer a &quot;computer games&quot; degree in 1997. Abertay was the UK&#x27;s first university to be recognised as a Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, and is associated with a business support programme for computer game startups.

==Campus==

Abertay University is situated in the centre of Dundee. The campus buildings include the historic Old College buildings of Dundee Business School, the Bernard King Library, scenes of crime teaching facilities, modern computer games labs in the UK Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, and the , a centre housed within the university dedicated to cybersecurity research and development.

The Bernard King Library in Bell Street opened to learners in February 1998 and was formally opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 June 1998. The library was voted best new building in Scotland in the 1998 Scottish Design Awards competition. The building has a stone rectangular &#x27;spine&#x27; and a curved glass front mimicking an open book. The Library houses an English Language learning centre, a specialist Law library, and an EU funded IT suite. The library was designed with the digital age very much in mind, and although the traditional books still feature, the emphasis was and is very much on providing access to digital information through online subscriptions.

The opened in June 2022 with they key aim of bringing together students, academics, and organisations to help solve global cybersecurity challenges. The centre offers a physical space for collaboration and experimentation using digital tools and technologies and also a secure cloud-computing infrastructure for specialist online teaching and learning. As well as offering businesses access to new talent, the provides students with opportunities to work with industry on real-world challenges.

==Academic reputation==
Abertay is a small university that receives the majority of its funding for teaching rather than research. Nevertheless, according to the results of the Research Excellence Framework 2014 (REF2014) published on 18 December 2014, Abertay was the highest ranked modern university in Scotland for &#x27;research intensity&#x27;. The university submitted an increased proportion of staff in REF2014 compared to RAE2008 and achieved an average score of 2.15 - which in REF terms means &#x27;quality that is recognised internationally in terms of originality, significance, and rigour&#x27;. This was an improvement from the average score of 1.83, &#x27;national recognition&#x27;, achieved in RAE2008.

The Research Excellence Framework 2021 (REF2021) published on 12 May 2022 and Abertay recorded a 23% increase in research that is ‘internationally excellent’ or ‘world-leading’ since the last REF in 2014. There was particularly strong performance in the areas of Art &amp; Design (covering work in digital games), Engineering (including work in cybersecurity, computing and environmental engineering) and Food Science, which respectively had 83%, 73% and 65% of research rated as ‘internationally excellent’ or ‘world-leading’.

Abertay was the first university in the world to offer a &quot;computer games&quot; degree in 1997. In 2009 it established the UK&#x27;s first Centre for Excellence in Computer Games Education, and a business support programme. Abertay runs five of the 25 interactive and games degree courses accredited in the UK by Creative Skillset, the industry skills body for the creative sector, more than any other institution.

==Symbols==

===Coat of arms===
Prior to 1953 no coat of arms was registered in the name of the college. The original Ensigns Armorial were recorded in the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland on 25 July 1953, in the name of Dundee Technical College. They were subsequently transferred to Dundee College of Technology in 1977, then to Dundee Institute of Technology in 1988 and, finally, to the University of Abertay Dundee on 25 April 1994.

The arms are described as:
&quot;Party per fess, in chief tierced in pale: 1st, Ermine, a chevron engrailed between three mullets Gules; 2nd, Azure, three chevronels Or; 3rd, Argent, a spray of oak Proper fructed Or between three pheons Azure; in base Azure, a pot of three flowering lilies Argent between two flanches Or each charged with a book Gules.&quot;

The top left sector is taken from the arms of Sir David Baxter of Kilmaron, who bequeathed a significant sum of money in order to establish the original Dundee Technical Institute in 1888. The top right sector is taken from the arms of Sir William Dalgleish, who was the senior trustee of what by then was known as Dundee Technical College and School of Art, and who opened the first building – Old College – on Abertay&#x27;s present campus on Bell Street in 1911. The top middle sector of three chevrons is the heraldic symbol for &quot;technical&quot;. The pot of lilies in base is taken from the arms of the City of Dundee, with the books on either side representing education.

===Motto===
&quot;Beatus homo qui invenit sapientiam&quot; (Blessed is the man who finds wisdom).

===Tartan===

Aaron McCauley, a graduate of Abertay, designed and registered the Abertay tartan in 2003. The tartan is based on Abertay&#x27;s promotional colours of dark blue, red, gold and green from its coat of arms.

SECNAV Notice 5030 originally gave the ship the name &quot;Delphinus&quot; after a small constellation in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere, on 15 February 1974. It was quickly realized in service that she could be nicknamed &#x27;dull penis,&#x27; so Secretary of the Navy J. William Middendorf issued a new notice on 1 April 1974, renaming her &quot;Pegasus&quot; for the constellation Pegasus. In service it earned the nickname &#x27;Pegasorous&#x27;. As this vessel was constructed several years before the rest of the class, there are some minor differences, notably in the fire-control systems of the respective craft.

==Construction==
&quot;Pegasus&quot; was laid down on 10 May 1973, by Boeing Marine Systems, in Seattle, Washington. She was launched on 9 November 1974, and commissioned on 9 July 1977.

==Purpose==

&quot;Pegasus&quot;-class hydrofoils were designed to operate offensively against hostile surface combatants (equipped with Harpoon anti-surface missiles) and conduct surveillance, screening and special operations in coastal waters. The six PHMs of the &quot;Pegasus&quot; class formed a single squadron which operated from Key West. They were the Navy&#x27;s fastest ships when foil borne. Their most notable applications were participation in the 1983 invasion of Grenada and counter-narcotics; they were credited with about 30% of all seizures from 1982 to 1992. They never participated in a major naval mission and remained relegated to Caribbean deployments during their service life 

==Project==

The PHM project was started in early 1970, by CNO Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, in an effort to increase the Navy&#x27;s number of surface combatants. The project called for a cost-effective hydrofoil boat designed to operate in coastal waters and equipped to fulfill the missions of destroyers and frigates in those areas so that these larger ships could be deployed to areas where they are needed most. These missions included surface surveillance as well as immediate responses such as surface-to-surface missiles (SSM) to any hostile actions conducted by enemy navies.

The PHM project was not only a US project. Other countries involved included Italy, Germany, Canada and Great Britain. During the initial phase of the project it was planned to build up to 100 hydrofoil boats for the NATO navies.

Following the retirement of Admiral Zumwalt, the Navy reduced funding for the PHM project. Due to the lack of money it was decided to use available monies for larger fleet units instead. The increasing costs of the PHM project finally resulted in the completion of only one PHM, &quot;Pegasus&quot;, although the construction of this ship had to be stopped for a while in 1974, again due to the lack of funds. At that time, the ship was only 20% completed.

Although PHM 3 - 6 had already been funded in FY 74 (PHM 2 in FY 73), construction of these ships did not start until 6 April 1977, when Secretary of Defense Harold Brown announced that the whole project, with the exception of &quot;Pegasus&quot;, was suspended. Congress now insisted on the completion of the last five ships since they had already been funded. In August 1977, Secretary of Defense Brown reactivated the PHM project and construction of the ships resumed, but the four countries involved in the project had lost interest in the PHM program.

The last of the US Navy&#x27;s hydrofoil boats was commissioned in 1982.

==Collision==
On 30 September 1981, &quot;Pegasus&quot; was involved in a collision with , but was later repaired.

<text>USS &quot;Aries&quot; (PHM-5) is the fifth ship of her class of hydrofoils operated by the United States Navy. &quot;Pegasus&quot; class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility. Despite being small in size, they carried a large 76 mm gun. &quot;Aries&quot; was named for the constellation.

&quot;Aries&quot; was laid down on 7 January 1980 at Renton, Seattle, Washington, by Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, launched on 5 November 1981, sponsored by Mrs. Earl B. Fowler, the wife of Vice Admiral Earl B. Fowler, Commander, Naval Sea Systems Command, and was commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 18 September 1982.

==Service history==
&quot;Aries&quot; operated in Puget Sound until 23 November 1982 when she got underway for Key West, Florida, her assigned home port. She made calls at San Francisco and San Diego on her way down the California coast. The guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat transited the Panama Canal on 11 December and arrived in Key West on the 15th. After the holidays, the warship began operations from her base. Acceptance trials came late in January 1983, and, in February, she carried out her first law enforcement operation against drug smugglers in cooperation with the Coast Guard. March and April brought training duty out of Key West and two more missions assisting the Coast Guard in its efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the United States. In each instance, &quot;Aries&quot; embarked a detachment of Coast Guardsmen and carried out the assignment under the operational control of the Commandant, Coast Guard District 7, based at Miami, Florida. Early in May, she entered the yard at Atlantic Drydock in Jacksonville, Florida, for six weeks of post-shakedown repairs and modifications. Halfway through June, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat returned to Key West and resumed a normal schedule of duty out of her home port. Though the bulk of her operations for the rest of the year consisted of routine training evolutions, tests, and equipment calibrations and checks, &quot;Aries&quot; participated in another anti-smuggling sweep during the second week in August and visited Nassau in the Bahamas later that month.

Normal duty in the waters near Key West kept &quot;Aries&quot; busy for the remainder of 1983 and during the first few weeks of 1984. In February 1984, the warship expanded her sphere of operations to include the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of Central America. Late in April, she participated in Exercise &quot;Ocean Venture 84&quot;. &quot;Aries&quot; returned to Key West for normal operations at the end of May and the beginning of June. On 11 June, however, she departed Key West for the waters around Puerto Rico to participate in the initial phase of UNITAS XXV, the 1984 edition of the annual series of multilateral exercises carried out with units of various Latin American navies. At the end of June, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat proceeded back to Key West to resume normal duty. In August, &quot;Aries&quot; took part in maneuvers conducted off the east coast of Central America. Back at Key West at the end of August, she began operating again on a training schedule.

The guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat spent the rest of 1984 and the first part of 1985 engaged in operations in the immediate vicinity of Key West. In March, she traveled to Puerto Rico to participate in a readiness exercise, READEX 1-85. More duty out of her home port occupied the warship&#x27;s time in April. At the beginning of May, she voyaged to Onslow Beach, where she took part in Exercise &quot;Solid Shield 85.&quot; The middle of June found &quot;Aries&quot; in the waters near Puerto Rico again for the initial phase of UNITAS XXVI. During July and early August, the warship carried out normal operations from her base at Key West. Her third fleet readiness exercise occupied the last half of August. In September, &quot;Aries&quot; resumed local operations from Key West and remained so occupied for the rest of 1985.

At the end of the first week in January 1986, she moved to Mayport, Florida, for a three-month availability. At the end of April, she proceeded back to Key West where she operated until late in July. At that time, she embarked upon a cruise that took her to the Caribbean for another UNITAS exercise during which she made port calls at La Guaira, Venezuela, and at St. Johns, Antigua. &quot;Aries&quot; returned to Key West on 14 August and carried out local training missions until mid-October. On 14 October, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat set sail for Little Creek, Virginia, to take part in a special project for the Chief of Naval Operations. Over the next two months, she divided her time between her home port and operations off the Virginia Capes. She concluded her development work for 1986 on 12 December and headed back to Key West on the 16th. &quot;Aries&quot; reentered her home port on 17 December and spent the remainder of the year in that vicinity.

&quot;Aries&quot; was decommissioned on 30 July 1993.

===Memorial===

USS Aries PHM-5 Hydrofoil Memorial, Inc obtained &quot;Aries&quot; for rehabilitation as a memorial located on the Grand River in Brunswick, Missouri in 1996. As of 2022 she can be found at the USS Aries Hydrofoil Museum. Dedicated to preserving hydrofoils of all types, the museum is centered around &quot;Aries.&quot;

Bill and Bob Meinhardt and Eliot James, knowing nothing about hydrofoils, bought the 133-foot &quot;Aries&quot; for scrap in 1996. Finding her in good shape, he sailed from Charleston, South Carolina to Missouri and decided to restore her.

&quot;Aries&quot; is currently located on the bank of the Gasconade River,

<text>The second USS &quot;Aquila&quot; (PHM-4) was the fourth ship of her class of hydrofoils operated by the United States Navy. &quot;Pegasus-&quot;class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility, and carried a powerful (for their size) armament.

Named for the constellation, &quot;Aquila&quot; (&quot;Eagle&quot;) was laid down on 10 July 1979 at Seattle, Washington, by Boeing Marine Systems; launched on 16 September 1981; sponsored by Mrs. John D. Bulkeley, the wife of Rear Admiral John D. Bulkeley, World War II, PT-boat hero; and commissioned at the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 26 June 1982.

==Service history==
After completing her fitting out, &quot;Aquila&quot; got underway from Bremerton, Washington, on 15 July 1982 in company with and and shaped a course for her home port, Key West, Florida. &quot;Frederick&quot; escorted the two guided-missile hydrofoil gunboats as far as Rodman in the Canal Zone where took over. &quot;Aquila&quot; and her traveling companions transited the Panama Canal on 8 August and arrived in Key West three days later. The warship spent the remainder of 1982 conducting shakedown and other training out of her base at the Trumbo Point Annex, Naval Air Station, Key West, Florida. During the first quarter of 1983, post-shakedown repairs occupied her time. That spring, &quot;Aquila&quot; embarked upon a schedule of normal training duties out of Key West that occupied her time through the summer and into all of 1983. From 10 to 20 October, she joined &quot;Taurus&quot; and for special operations in the Caribbean Sea.

In mid-November, &quot;Aquila&quot; and &quot;Taurus&quot; joined at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, to test the feasibility of operating guided-missile frigates and guided-missile hydrofoil gunboats together in the same task organization. However, demands attendant to the American presence in Grenada forestalled the experiment. &quot;Aquila&quot;, &quot;Taurus&quot;, and &quot;Aubrey Fitch&quot; headed for Grenada where they performed patrol duties and relief work until the middle of December. &quot;Aquila&quot; returned to Key West on 16 December and spent the last two weeks of the year in port.

Holiday leave and upkeep ended early in January 1984, and &quot;Aquila&quot; reembarked upon normal operations out of her base at Key West. In May, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat added another duty to her busy training schedule, helping the Coast Guard to interdict the traffic in illicit drugs. That fall she joined &quot;Taurus&quot; in a special mission to the Caribbean coast of Central America. The two warships returned to Key West at the end of the first week in November, and &quot;Aquila&quot; resumed her program of training missions and drug traffic interdiction. She continued so occupied through the end of 1984 and during the first half of 1985. Late in July 1985, the warship began a restricted availability that lasted until the middle of October. Following post-overhaul trials, &quot;Aquila&quot; rejoined the effort against drug smugglers in mid-December.

Law enforcement duties occupied her during the first two months of 1986. In March, she carried out post-overhaul refresher training and, late in April, participated in FLEETEX 1-86 staged in the West Indies. Immediately thereafter, &quot;Aquila&quot; joined in another exercise, Operation &quot;Ocean Venture 86,&quot; that simulated an attack on an enemy fleet attempting to force the Mona Passage between Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. At the beginning of the second week in May, the guided-missile hydrofoil gunboat returned to normal operations out of Key West. She interrupted those operations twice that summer—once early in July and again early in August—to conduct special tests with A-7E Corsair II aircraft for the Chief of Naval Operations. Otherwise, she carried out normal duties from her base at Key West through the end of the year.

In April 1991, The USS &quot;Aquila&quot; hit a whale that suddenly breached in front of PHM-4 while she was flying on her foils in the Straits of Florida. 
The front foil skipped off the back of the whale, while the stern foils stuck the whale cutting it into 3 pieces. 
The whale strike caused tremendous stress on the hull; visible warping of the stern hull section could be easily seen. Several crew men including the Captain required medical attention and evacuation. The event caused the radios to fall on the radioman resulting in loss of communications. The captain issued a mayday using a handheld radio. The engine room was flooding due to the raw water intake being broke loose from the hull. Being the largest compartment the pumps could not maintain sufficient removal of water. A coast guard falcon dropped two P250s which saved the ship. Additionally the impact caused such force that the rafts self deployed in mid air and floated next to the ship.

&quot;Aquila&quot; was decommissioned in 1993 and sold in 1996.

<text>USS &quot;Taurus&quot; (PHM-3) was the third ship of her class of hydrofoils operated by the United States Navy. &quot;Pegasus&quot; class vessels were designed for high speed and mobility, and carried a powerful (for their size) armament. The ship was named for the constellation Taurus.

In November 1972, The United States, Germany and Italy signed a Memorandum of Understanding to share the cost of the development of a Patrol Missile Hydrofoil. This brought about the building of the &quot;Pegasus&quot; class . The &quot;Taurus&quot; was the first production model.

<doc id="912628" wikidata="Q3092837" url="?curid=912628" title="Feast of the Hunters' Moon">
<text>Feast of the Hunters’ Moon is a weekend festival and historical reenactment held on a weekend in October since 1968, at the present-day site of Fort Ouiatenon, a replica 18th century French military and trading post near West Lafayette, Indiana. Traditionally, the Hunters&#x27; Moon is the full moon in October, following September&#x27;s Harvest Moon.

==Site==

The Feast is held on the grounds of the Historic Fort Ouiatenon Park, on the Wabash River. The blockhouse is a replica of the original Fort Ouiatenon, which was the first fortified European settlement in what is now called Indiana. The fort served as a French trading post and was located approximately one mile downriver from the replica.

==Program==

During the festival, participants reenact the annual fall gathering of the French and Native Americans which took place at Fort Ouiatenon in the mid-18th century. Participants dress in the garb of the 18th century French soldiers, settlers, and Native Americans who lived in this region. Food vendors sell traditional period foods such as rabbit stew, voyageur stew, and venison sausage. The program also includes music, marching, dancing and reenacted military maneuvers.

===Musical performances===
As part of the event, various musical acts perform, including Native American drummers, historical folk music performers, French folksingers and period fife and drum corps.

===Living history presentations===

The event includes historical reenactments featuring period characters from the 1700s to educate visitors about the lives and culture of the period. One historical interpreter presented a Delaware Indian who first served as a scout for the French and whose people lived along the Wabash River in the 1700s and co-existed peacefully with the French at the outpost. Others play traders and gunsmiths, such as &quot;Pierre Rolletof&quot; of French Scots-Irish descent who traveled along the Wabash River trading a range of items, including guns, and also gunsmithed as he traveled. Other reenactors have demonstrated various period trades and crafts, including a chairmaker who built Windsor chairs to order, spending 40–45 hours per chair.

==Size and production==

In 2004, the annual event drew over 8,000 participants and over 60,000 spectators. The Tippecanoe County Historical Association, cooperating with the Tippecanoe County Parks Department, presents the event on a weekend in late September or early October. The annual event ran for its 44th year in 2011. 2017 marked its 50th anniversary and the 300th anniversary of the fort. The event was cancelled during the Pandemic of 2020 but resumed in 2021.

<text>&quot;&quot; (Latin for &quot;Glory to God in the highest&quot;) is a Christian hymn known also as the Greater Doxology (as distinguished from the &quot;Minor Doxology&quot; or Gloria Patri) and the Angelic Hymn/Hymn of the Angels. The name is often abbreviated to Gloria in Excelsis or simply Gloria.

The hymn begins with the words that the angels sang when announcing the birth of Christ to shepherds in : Douay-Rheims (in Latin). Other verses were added very early, forming a doxology.

An article by David Flusser links the text of the verse in Luke with ancient Jewish liturgy.

==History==
 is an example of the &quot;psalmi idiotici&quot; (&quot;private psalms&quot;, i.e., compositions by individuals in imitation of the biblical Psalter) that were popular in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Other surviving examples of this lyric poetry are the Te Deum and the Phos Hilaron. In the 4th century it became part of morning prayers, and is still recited in the Byzantine Rite Orthros service.

The Latin translation is traditionally attributed to Hilary of Poitiers (–368), who may have learned it while in the East (359–360); as such, it is part of a loose tradition of early Latin translations of the scripture known as the Vetus Latina. The Vulgate Latin translation of the Bible was commissioned only in 382. 

The Latin hymn thus uses the word &quot;excelsis&quot; to translate the Greek word ὑψίστοις – &quot;hypsístois&quot; (the highest) in : Douay-Rheims, not the word &quot;altissimis&quot;, which Jerome preferred for his translation. However, this word is used near the end: &quot;tu solus Altissimus, Iesu Christe&quot; (you alone the Most High, Jesus Christ).

==Present-day Greek Orthodox text==
== Present-day Coptic text ==
==Present-day Latin text==
==Liturgical use==
===Byzantine Rite===
In the Byzantine Rite (used by the Eastern Orthodox and some Eastern Catholic Churches), the Gloria is referred to as the &quot;Doxology&quot;, and there are two forms: the Greater Doxology and the Lesser Doxology. The Greater Doxology is always sung, whereas the Lesser Doxology is read. There are certain textual differences between the two, and the order is somewhat altered in the two forms.

The Greater Doxology is used in the Orthros (Matins) on Sundays and feast days. The Lesser Doxology is used at Matins on simple weekdays and at the Apodeipnon (Compline), but not in the Divine Liturgy.

=== Alexandrine Rite ===
In the Alexandrine Rite (used by the Coptic Orthodox Church and some other Oriental Orthodox Churches), the Gloria is a common congregational prayer, sometime referred to as the &quot;Praise of the Angels&quot;. It is recited collectively by the congregation during the Morning Raising of Incense, as well as at the Matins prayer of the Agpeya (the Alexandrian Canonical Book of the Hours). The first verse of the hymn is also recited at the dismissal of the Divine Liturgy before the chanting of the &quot;Concluding Canon&quot;. 

===Roman Rite===
By contrast, in the Roman Rite this hymn is not included in the Liturgy of the Hours, but is sung or recited at Mass, after the Kyrie, on Sundays outside of Lent and Advent, during the octaves of Easter and Christmas, and on solemnities and feasts.

In Masses celebrated in accordance with the 1962 Roman Missal (authorized as an extraordinary form of the Roman Rite), the Gloria is sung much more frequently: the 1960 Code of Rubrics require it at Mass when in the corresponding Office of the day the Te Deum is said at Matins. It is thus used not only on I and II-class feasts (corresponding to solemnities and feasts in the post-Vatican II Mass) but also on III-class feasts (corresponding to memorials in the later form). In the 1962 form it is also said on ferias of Christmastide and Paschaltide even outside the octaves, but is omitted during the Septuagesima season, which does not exist in the post-Vatican II liturgy. The Gloria is also sung in both the pre-Vatican II and in the later form of the Roman Rite at the Mass of the Lord&#x27;s Supper in the evening of Maundy Thursday and at the Easter Vigil.

A tradition recorded in the Liber Pontificalis attributes to Pope Telesphorus (128–139?) the use of the hymn at the Mass of Christmas Day and to Pope Symmachus (498–514) its use on Sundays and the feasts of martyrs, but only by bishops; the right to use it was later extended to priests, at first only at Easter and on the day of their ordination, but by the end of the 11th century priests, as well as bishops, used it in the Mass on Sundays and feasts outside of Lent and Pre-Lent. After the 12th century Advent began to be considered a penitential period in imitation of Lent, to the exclusion therefore of the .

===Lutheran Rite===
The hymn is used in the Mass (Divine Service) of the Lutheran Churches. 

===Anglican use===
In the Church of England&#x27;s 1549 edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, it was used in the same position as in the Roman Rite but was later moved to the end of the service, immediately before the concluding blessing. Revisions to the Prayer Book produced the 1552 prayer book and later the 1662 prayer book, but this placement was retained by the Anglican Communion until the 20th century. &quot;Common Worship&quot; provides two Orders, one of which places the hymn in the earlier position.

The 1789 Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States of America prayer book placed the Gloria at the end of the psalms in Morning Prayer and Evening Prayer as an option to use of the Gloria Patri and also placed the Gloria at the end of the holy Eucharist (like the 1662 prayer book). The 1928 version removed the Gloria from Morning Prayer but retained it in Evening Prayer. This 1928 edition is still the standard in the breakaway Continuing Anglican churches. The Episcopal Church&#x27;s 1979 Book moved it to the beginning, after or in place of the &quot;Kyrie&quot; in Rite One. In a Rite Two (i.e., contemporary language) service of Holy Eucharist, the Gloria, or another song of praise, is sung or said on all Sundays except those in Advent or Lent. It may also be used at other times as desired excepting Lent and Advent.

====Gloria in the Mass ordinary====

==Associated ceremonial==
===Roman Rite===
In the Tridentine Mass, the priest is instructed, when saying the opening phrase &quot;Gloria in excelsis Deo&quot;, to extend his hands and raise them to shoulder height and, at the word &quot;Deo&quot;, to join them and bow his head. He is then to continue the recitation standing erect with hands joined and bowing his head to the cross at the words &quot;Adoramus te&quot;, &quot;Gratias agimus tibi&quot;, &quot;Iesu Christe&quot; (twice), and &quot;Suscipe deprecationem nostram&quot;, and at the concluding phrase (as also at the concluding phrase of the Nicene Creed and the Sanctus), to make a large sign of the cross on himself. At High Mass the priest intones the opening phrase, while the deacon and subdeacon stand behind him; then they join him at the altar and together with him quietly recite the rest of the hymn, after which they sit down and wait for the choir to finish its singing of the same text.

The Roman Missal as revised in 1970 simplifies this, saying: &quot;The Gloria is intoned by the priest or, if appropriate, by a cantor or by the choir; but it is sung either by everyone together, or by the people alternately with the choir, or by the choir alone. If not sung, it is to be recited either by all together or by two parts of the congregation responding one to the other.&quot; No particular ritual gestures are prescribed.

===Byzantine Rite===
In the usage of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, the Great Doxology is one of the high points of the festal Matins service. The priest puts on his phelonion (chasuble). When it comes time for the Great Doxology the deacon opens the Holy Doors, and the priest raises his hands orans and exclaims: &quot;Glory to Thee, Who hast shown us the Light!&quot;, and the choir begins chanting the Doxology, while all of the oil lamps and candles in the temple are lit. The Great Doxology concludes with the chanting of the Trisagion and leads into the chanting of the Troparion of the Day. If the bishop is present he vests in his full pontifical vestments for the Great Doxology, and the subdeacons stand behind the Holy Table (altar) holding the lit dikirion and trikirion.

When the Lesser Doxology is called for, it is simply said by the reader, the priest does not put on his phelonion, the Holy Doors remain closed and no lamps or candles are lit. The Lesser Doxology does not end with the Trisagion and is followed by an ektenia (litany).

In liturgical calendars it is symbolized by a red mis-shapen semicircle (with the opening to one side) with three dots inside.

== Musical settings ==

The Gloria has been and still is sung to a wide variety of melodies. Modern scholars have catalogued well over two hundred of them used in the medieval church. The Roman Missal indicates several different plainchant melodies. In addition, several &quot;farced&quot; Glorias were composed in the Middle Ages and were still sung in places when the Roman Missal was revised by order of Pope Pius V in 1570. These expanded the basic Gloria by, for instance, adding to mentions of Jesus Christ a mention of some relationship between him and his mother. The use of these additional phrases in honour of the Blessed Virgin Mary was so common that in editions of the Roman Missal earlier than the 1921 revision, the text of the Gloria was followed by the rubric: &quot;Sic dicitur , etiam in Missis beatæ Mariæ, quando dicenda est&quot; (When the is to be recited, it is recited in this way, even in Masses of Blessed Mary).

Almost all polyphonic settings of the Mass include the Gloria. In addition, there are a number of settings of the Gloria alone, including: 
* Antonio Vivaldi, who wrote two Glorias that survived: the widely recorded RV 589, and the less famous RV 588
* George Frideric Handel, whose setting for solo soprano and strings was rediscovered in 2001: Gloria
* Camille Saint-Saëns
* Francis Poulenc: Gloria
* William Walton
* John Rutter: Gloria
* Mike Anderson: Gloria
* Karl Jenkins, who interpolates other texts alongside the standard Gloria text: Gloria

A paraphrase of the text in German, the early Lutheran hymn , has also been commonly set to music, in the form of chorale preludes or as part of larger compositions. The free paraphrase &quot;Ich lobe meinen Gott, der aus der Tiefe mich holt&quot; became a 1979 hymn of the genre Neues Geistliches Lied, similarly &quot;Ich lobe meinen Gott von ganzem Herzen&quot; the same year.

The popular Christmas carol &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; is derived from the beginning of the Gloria, which it uses as a refrain. It has been translated into several languages. 

The Gloria features prominently in the popular song &quot;Silence&quot; by Delerium, a trance song as well as in Gina&#x27;s and Elvira&#x27;s theme from the &quot;Scarface&quot; soundtrack.

The first phrase is also present in Bladee and Ecco2K&#x27;s track &#x27;5 Star Crest (4 Vattenrum)&#x27; from their collaborative album &quot;Crest&quot;.

<text>Hedy Madeleine Fry, (born August 6, 1941) is a Canadian politician and physician who is currently the longest-serving female Member of Parliament, winning ten consecutive elections in the constituency of Vancouver Centre including the 1993 election, when she defeated incumbent Prime Minister Kim Campbell.

==Early life and career==
Fry was born in San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago. She is of Scottish, Spanish, Indian, and Chinese ancestry. After declining an English Literature scholarship to Oxford, Fry earned her equivalent of a BA in Science in one year and then went on to receive her medical training at the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, Ireland. She immigrated to Canada in 1970 and established a practice in Vancouver.

Fry worked at St. Paul&#x27;s Hospital (Vancouver) for 23 years. She served as president of the British Columbia Federation of Medical Women in 1977. She was president of the Vancouver Medical Association in 1988–89, the BC Medical Association in 1990–91, and chaired the Canadian Medical Association&#x27;s Multiculturalism Committee in 1992–9. She volunteered as a Tawny Owl as a member of the Girl Guides of Canada, leading a Brownie group. Fry was also a host on the nationally televised CBC show Doctor Doctor.

==Federal politics==
Fry sought and won the Liberal Party nomination for Vancouver Centre for the 1993 federal election over lawyer David Varty and college lecturer John Lang in March 1993. She was elected to the House of Commons of Canada, defeating Progressive Conservative Prime Minister Kim Campbell. Fry was only the fifth person to unseat a sitting prime minister, and the first to do so on his or her first try for office. Fry has been re-elected in every subsequent election (1997, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011, 2015, 2019 and 2021).

===Chretien and Martin governments===
She served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of National Health and Welfare from 1993 until 1996 when she was appointed to the Cabinet as Secretary of State for Multiculturalism and Status of Women. Fry apologized to the people of Prince George, B.C. after she said in the House of Commons that “crosses are being burned on lawns as we speak”. Fry did not remain a minister after cabinet was shuffled in 2002.

When Paul Martin became Prime Minister of Canada at the end of 2003, he made her Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration with special emphasis on Foreign Credentials. After the 2004 election, she was named Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration and the Minister of Human Resources and Skills Development with special emphasis on the Internationally Trained Workers Initiative.

===In opposition===
In 2006, she beat high-profile NDP activist and former MP Svend Robinson and in 2008 she defeated high-profile Conservative Lorne Mayencourt. On May 4, 2006, Fry became the 11th person, 3rd woman, and the only Westerner to officially enter the Liberal party leadership race. Fry launched her leadership campaign saying that Canada&#x27;s diversity is its greatest competitive advantage - &quot;our weapon of mass inclusion&quot; - and called for a &quot;non-ideological&quot; approach to problem solving. She withdrew from the contest on September 25 and announced her support for Bob Rae.

Re-elected in Vancouver Centre for a sixth term in 2008, Fry was appointed the Official Opposition Critic for Canadian Heritage. On November 21, 2008, Liberal leadership candidate Bob Rae announced that Fry would serve as his Campaign Co-Chair in British Columbia.

Fry was re-elected in 2011 by a margin of approximately 2,000 votes. When the Liberals lost power in 2006, Fry was named as Critic for Sport Canada in the Liberal shadow cabinet. In 2011, as the Liberals lost their designation as Official Opposition, Fry was named Liberal Critic for Health.

===Trudeau government ===
In the 2015 election, Fry won her riding once more, becoming the oldest Canadian MP and the longest serving female MP. During the 42nd Parliament, she was appointed to the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, which provides oversight to Canada&#x27;s security services and requires a Top Secret security clearance.

In the 2019 Election, Fry once again won her riding for a 9th consecutive term. She currently serves as the Special Representative for Gender Issues at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe&#x27;s Parliamentary Assembly, a role she has held since 2010. Fry is also a member of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development, and the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic.
==Family==
Fry has three adult sons and four grandchildren. Her eldest son, Pete Fry, was elected to Vancouver City Council in the 2018 municipal election.

<text>Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) is an American professional wrestling promotion and former developmental territory based in Louisville, Kentucky. The company is currently run by Al Snow, Matt Jones, and Louisville mayor Craig Greenberg.

OVW was initially a member promotion of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from its inception in 1993 until 2000, when it became the primary developmental territory for the World Wrestling Federation, now known as WWE. It remained in this role from 2000 until February 7, 2008, when the promotion became unaffiliated. In November 2011, OVW became the developmental territory for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling. This relationship initially ended on November 2, 2013, but on March 19, 2019, the two promotions re-established their developmental agreement.

OVW&#x27;s television programming originates from the Davis Arena in the Buechel neighborhood of Louisville. Their weekly series (branded on-air as OVW Rise since January 2024, and known informally as OVW TV) currently airs live on local station WBNA-21, streaming service Triller TV, and the promotion&#x27;s YouTube channel. As of 2020, through various syndication and distribution deals, OVW&#x27;s weekly series is available to view in over 100 million households in the U.S., and to over 700 million worldwide.

== History ==

===Founding and NWA membership (1993–2001)===
OVW was founded by Nightmare Danny Davis in 1993 as a National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) member promotion under the name NWA Ohio Valley Championship Wrestling. The company primarily ran shows in the Kentucky and Indiana territories that were formerly run by the United States Wrestling Association, with weekly shows run out of the original Davis Arena in Jeffersonville, Indiana, with larger shows run out of the Louisville Gardens in Louisville, Kentucky.

In 1997, OVW ended its relationship with the NWA and renamed itself Ohio Valley Wrestling. Later that year, Trailer Park Trash became the first OVW Heavyweight Champion by defeating Vic the Bruiser.

On January 16, 1998, OVW taped the first episode of its weekly television series, emanating from the original Davis Arena in Jeffersonville, Indiana. Louisville Gardens ring announcer Dean Hill served as play by play commentator alongside Faye Davis as the Ring Announcer. The show featured an introduction to the company by owner Danny Davis, with a main event of Nick Dinsmore and Rob Conway vs Juan Hurtado and The Assassin #2.

===WWF/WWE developmental territory (1999–2008)===
In 1999, WWF creative team member Jim Cornette bought a stake in OVW. Cornette, taking on the role of booker and show writer while appearing in an on-camera commentator role, made his first televised appearance on July 10, 1999, and spoke of the changes that were to take place. The first group of developmental talent included future stars such as John Cena, Randy Orton, Brock Lesnar, Batista, and Shelton Benjamin.

OVW held its final show at the original Davis Arena on August 21, 2002, headlined by a match between Damaja and Rene Dupree. On September 4, 2002, the company would debut its show at the current Davis Arena at 4400 Shepherdsville Rd in Louisville, KY. On July 10, 2005 Jim Cornette parted ways with WWE and was relieved of his duties overseeing OVW. This resulted from an incident where Cornette reportedly slapped an OVW beginners class student Anthony Carelli (better known as Santino Marella) for having an inappropriate reaction to being confronted by a horror-themed wrestler called The Boogeyman during a match at an OVW live show. The two have not been on positive terms since, even having a confrontation during an event both were performing at as recently as October 2017. Cornette was replaced by WWE Trainer Al Snow on the announce team, and Snow was replaced as creative director/producer by Paul Heyman. This arrangement would be short-lived, however, as WWE would eventually put Heyman in charge of the revival of ECW as a WWE brand. Eventually the booking duties would go to Al Snow, who would have the longest tenure outside of Cornette. Jim Cornette sold his stake in OVW to Davis in 2007.

In 2007, WWE launched Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW) in Tampa, Florida to serve as a new developmental territory. OVW and FCW simultaneously trained WWE prospects for a brief period, but on February 7, 2008, WWE announced that it had ended its relationship with OVW, moving all contracted talent to FCW. WWE-contracted talent also made occasional appearances on OVW shows, including a match between John Cena and Lance Cade as the main event for the final Kentucky Kingdom show. However, FCW was dissolved in 2012 and was relaunched as NXT, formerly a reality/scripted television program that existed in its format from 2010 to 2012, replacing the ECW brand.

===Post-WWE years (2008–2018)===
In 2009, OVW alumnus John &quot;Bradshaw&quot; Layfield would leave WWE to sponsor OVW. On September 8, 2010, in what was dubbed the company&#x27;s &quot;season premiere&quot;, Danny Davis, who himself was making his return for the first time in over a year, announced that Jim Cornette was returning to his role as match maker of the company. Cornette, who was also executive producer of Ring of Honor&#x27;s HDNet show, &quot;Ring of Honor Wrestling&quot;, announced that ROH talent were going to work in OVW, along with other new and returning OVW members of the roster.

On November 7, 2011, it was announced that OVW and TNA Wrestling had reached an agreement for the former to become an official training and developmental territory. This agreement would end on November 2, 2013, due to a financial dispute.

===Gladiator Sports and Al Snow era (2018–2021)===
On April 6, 2018, it was announced that professional wrestler Al Snow was purchasing the promotion from Danny Davis, who was planning to retire but didn&#x27;t want to shut the company down. On September 12, 2018, it was announced that Ohio Valley Wrestling would be merging with Top Notch Boxing, a major boxing promotion in Louisville, to form the Gladiator Sports Network. OVW&#x27;s first event under the Gladiator Sports banner was the 1000th episode special of its television series on October 10, 2018, from Louisville&#x27;s Fourth Street Live!. This was OVW&#x27;s first ever live televised event and it was streamed on FITE TV. The event featured a tournament for the vacant OVW championship featuring both current and past stars as well as a tribute to the companies founders.

On October 29, 2018, the brand announced an international expansion of its wrestling school and television product to the European Market labeled OVW-EU. Most of the schools now affiliated with the OVW Brand outside the United States were formally with the &quot;Al Snow Wrestling Academy&quot; brand which was merged with OVW upon the purchase by Gladiator Sports. This expands Ohio Valley Wrestling to a total of 17 wrestling schools worldwide. An on-demand service, which will air past and current editions of the original American brand plus the possibility of a future OVW UK Brand, was also announced. The service would officially launch on the third week of March 2019 at a cost of $4.99 a month.

In February 2019, OVW would announce a partnership with Impact Wrestling to produce an exclusive event for Impact&#x27;s Global Wrestling Network (GWN). The event, titled Clash in the Bluegrass, would be an Impact One Night Only special held on March 2, 2019, in Davis Arena. The full-length event would stream on GWN on March 9, 2019. Clash in the Bluegrass would mark the first collaboration between OVW and Impact since 2013, and would be the first time the new Davis Arena has ever sold out an event via pre-sale tickets. On March 19, 2019, Impact announced that the company had entered a new partnership with OVW as its developmental territory.

In April 2019, local media in Louisville reported that OVW was developing a formal vocational educational program in professional wrestling through the Al Snow Wrestling Academy, and had applied for accreditation with the Kentucky Department of Education. The school would be approved by the state of Kentucky on September 15, making it the first officially accredited professional wrestling trade school.

During the August 8, 2019 TV tapings, it was announced that &quot;OVW TV&quot; would move to Tuesday nights on WBNA starting October 1, and that the show would air live.

In October 2020, OVW announced a partnership with Qatar Pro Wrestling. That same month, Game+, a Canadian channel owned by Impact&#x27;s parent company, Anthem Sports &amp; Entertainment, began syndicating OVW&#x27;s television program in Canada and the United States.

===2021–present===
On January 5, 2021, OVW announced that Matt Jones of Kentucky Sports Radio and Craig Greenberg of 21c Museum Hotels were lead investors in a group that purchased a majority interest in the company. Snow continues to run the promotion&#x27;s day-to-day operations. Later that year, Louisville TV station WDRB reported that OVW was preparing to move into a building in the city&#x27;s St. Joseph neighborhood that had served as a University of Louisville employee fitness center before being closed in 2019. If zoning approval is obtained, both OVW and the Al Snow Wrestling Academy will operate out of that facility.

It was announced on August 21, 2023, that OVW would be featured in a new docu-series to air on Netflix titled, &quot;Wrestlers&quot;. The show follows the company throughout their journey and climb back to prominence. The series comes from director Greg Whiteley (&quot;Last Chance U&quot;, &quot;Cheer&quot;) and BBC Studios Los Angeles and covers Al Snow&#x27;s attempt to keep the promotion economically viable. The success of the show led to OVW to enter a strategic partnership with Genvec Ventures that would ensure them a financial stability. In addition, Ed Payer was named the new CEO of the company.

On January 11, 2024, OVW announced that Mickie James has joined OVW as Creative Director, Head of Female Talent and Executive Producer of their wrestling shows.

<text>A deep-sky object (DSO) is any astronomical object that is not an individual star or Solar System object (such as Sun, Moon, planet, comet, etc.). The classification is used for the most part by amateur astronomers to denote visually observed faint naked eye and telescopic objects such as star clusters, nebulae and galaxies. This distinction is practical and technical, implying a variety of instruments and techniques appropriate to observation, and does not distinguish the nature of the object itself.

==Origins and classification==
Classifying non-stellar astronomical objects began soon after the invention of the telescope. One of the earliest comprehensive lists was Charles Messier&#x27;s 1774 Messier catalog, which included 103 &quot;nebulae&quot; and other faint fuzzy objects he considered a nuisance since they could be mistaken for comets, the objects he was actually searching for. As telescopes improved these faint nebulae would be broken into more descriptive scientific classifications such as interstellar clouds, star clusters, and galaxies.

&quot;Deep-sky object&quot;, as an astronomical classification for these objects, has its origins in the modern field of amateur astronomy. The origin of the term is unknown but it was popularized by &quot;Sky &amp; Telescope&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Deep-Sky Wonders&quot; column, which premiered in the magazine&#x27;s first edition in 1941. Houston&#x27;s columns, and later book compilations of those columns, helped popularize the term, each month giving the reader a guided tour of a small part of the sky highlighting well-known and lesser-known objects for binoculars and small telescopes.

==Observations and activities==

There are many amateur astronomical techniques and activities associated with deep-sky objects. Some of these objects are bright enough to find and see in binoculars and small telescopes. But the faintest objects need the light-gathering power of telescopes with large objectives, and since they are invisible to the naked eye, can be hard to find. This has led to increased popularity of GoTo telescopes that can find DSOs automatically, and large reflecting telescopes, such as Dobsonian style telescopes, with wide fields of view well suited to such observing. Observing faint objects needs dark skies, so these relatively portable types of telescopes also lend themselves to the majority of amateurs who need to travel outside light polluted urban locations. To cut down light pollution and enhance contrast, observers employ nebular filters, which are designed to admit certain wavelengths of light and block others.

There are organized activities associated with DSOs such as the Messier marathon, which occurs at a specific time each year and involves observers trying to spot all 110 Messier objects in one night. Since the Messier catalog objects were discovered with relatively small 18th-century telescopes, it is a popular list with observers, being well within the grasp of most modern amateur telescopes. The Herschel 400 Catalogue is also a popular list with observers and is considered more challenging; it was designed for larger telescopes and experienced amateur astronomers.

==List of deep-sky object types==
There are many astronomical object types that come under the description of &quot;deep-sky objects&quot;. Since the definition is objects that are not Solar System objects or individual stars, examples include:

* Black holes and active galactic nuclei
* Nebulae
** Bright nebulae
*** Emission nebulae
*** Reflection nebulae
*** H II regions
*** Diffuse ionized gas
*** Planetary nebulae
*** Supernova remnants
** Dark nebulae
* Galaxies
* Star clusters
** Open clusters
** Globular clusters

<text>Sir Henry Mortimer Durand, (14 February 1850 – 8 June 1924) was a British diplomat and member of the Indian Civil Service. He is best-known as the namesake for the Durand Line, which serves as the international border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

==Early life and education==
Born at Sehore, Bhopal, India, he was the son of Sir Henry Marion Durand, the Resident of Baroda and he was educated at Blackheath Proprietary School, and Tonbridge School.

==Career==
Durand entered the Indian Civil Service in 1873. He served as the Political Secretary in Kabul during the Second Anglo-Afghan War (1878–1880); was Foreign Secretary of India from 1884 to 1894; and appointed Minister plenipotentiary at Tehran in 1894, where despite being a Persian scholar and fluently speaking the language and he made little impression either in Tehran or on his superiors in London. He left Persia in March 1900, by which time owing to the illness of his wife Ella he had withdrawn from social life and the legation was in a depressed and disorganised state. He served as British Ambassador to Spain from 1900 to 1903, and as Ambassador to the United States from 1903 to 1906.

He was appointed a CSI in 1881 knighted with a KCIE in 1888, and a KCSI in 1894 and appointed a GCMG in 1900.

Durand unsuccessfully stood as a Conservative candidate for Plymouth in the January 1910 United Kingdom general election.





==Legacy==

===Afghanistan–Pakistan border===
The Durand Line is named after Sir Mortimer and remains the international border between Afghanistan and modern-day Pakistan that is officially recognized by all countries apart from Afghanistan. The border is an ongoing point of contention between the two countries, as Afghanistan unilaterally disputes the legitimacy of the border.

In 1884 Durand informed Abdur Rahman Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan, the frontier between modern-day Pakistan (the successor state of British India) and Afghanistan that the garrison of Panjdeh had been slaughtered on the orders of the Russian General Komarov. The Russians wished to stop British occupation of Herat, so Durand was despatched to prevent &quot;the strained relations which then existed between Russia and ourselves,&quot; wrote the Viceroy, Lord Dufferin, and &quot;might in itself have proved the occasion of a long miserable war.&quot; Tensions at home in British newspapers heightened the urgency of the incident, threatening war in Central Asia, which Rahman was desperate to avoid. A telephone line was kept open between Lord Granville and Count Giers in St Petersburg.

Sir Mortimer was deputed to Kabul by the government of British India for the purpose of settling an exchange of territory required by the demarcation of the Joint Boundary Commission between northeastern Afghanistan and the Russian possessions along the same lines as in 1873, except for the southward salient at Panjdeh. The British made it clear that any further extension towards Herat would amount to a declaration of war. Rahman showed his usual ability in diplomatic argument, his tenacity where his own views or claims were in debate, with a sure underlying insight into the real situation. A Royal Commission was established to demarcate the boundary between Afghanistan and the British-governed India. The two parties camped at Parachinar, now part of FATA Pakistan, near Khost Afghanistan. From the British side the camp was attended by Mortimer Durand and Sahibzada Abdul Qayyum, the Political Agent for Khyber. The Afghans were represented by Sahibzada Abdul Latif and Governor Sardar Shireendil Khan representing Amir Abdur Rahman Khan. The territorial exchanges were amicably agreed upon; the relations between the British Indian and Afghan governments, as previously arranged, were confirmed. The Durand Road in Lahore is also named after him.

===Durand Cup===
In 1888, Durand founded a football tournament in Shimla to promote the value of sports as a means to maintain health, as well as to encourage sporting competition in India. It would later be named after him.

==Death==
There is a misconception regarding the grave of Mortimer Durand, leading to the mistaken belief that he is buried in Pakistan. However, in reality, he died in Polden, Somerset, England, and was laid to rest there. The grave that has been associated with him actually belongs to his father, Sir Henry Marion Durand.

==Published works==
From 1906, after his return to England, he devoted his time to writing.

He also published the biography of his father, General Henry Marion Durand (1812–1871), and also had ambitions as a novelist, often with his wife, Lady E. R. Durand (1852–1913), as a co-author. Some of his publications are:

* &quot;Nadir Shah: An Historical Novel&quot; (1908)
* &quot;The Life of Sir Alfred Comyn Lyall&quot; (1913)
* &quot;The Life of Field-Marshal Sir George White, V.C.&quot; (1915)
*&quot;The Thirteenth Hussars in the Great War&quot; (1921)
* &quot;An Autumn Tour in Western Persia&quot; (1902) is by his wife E. R. Durand

<text>Granville Stanley Hall (February 1, 1844 – April 24, 1924) was an American psychologist and educator who earned the first doctorate in psychology awarded in the United States of America at Harvard College in the nineteenth century. His interests focused on human life span development and evolutionary theory. Hall was the first president of the American Psychological Association and the first president of Clark University. A 2002 survey by &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; ranked Hall as the 72nd most cited psychologist of the 20th century, in a tie with Lewis Terman.
==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Born in Ashfield, Massachusetts, Hall grew up on a farm with his parents, Granville Bascom Hall, who served on the Massachusetts legislature, and Abigail Beals, who attended school at Albany Female Seminary and went on to become a teacher herself. As a child, Hall spent much of his time reading and taking advantage of the educational advantages he could gain from his parents and the local schools. At a young age, he was interested in animals and bodily skills. By the age of 16, he began to teach other students, most of whom were older than he was.

===Education and early career===
Hall attended Williston Seminary and graduated from Williams College in 1867, then studied at the Union Theological Seminary. Inspired by Wilhelm Wundt&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Physiological Psychology&quot;, Hall pursued doctoral studies at Harvard University, where he met William James, an adjunct professor who had just taught the nation&#x27;s first psychology class. In 1878, Hall earned the first psychology doctorate awarded in America. Afterward, Hall could find no academic jobs available in psychology, so he went to Europe to study at the University of Berlin, and spent a brief time in Wundt&#x27;s Leipzig laboratory in 1879.

He began his career by teaching English and philosophy at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and then teaching history of philosophy at Williams College in Massachusetts. Following successful lecture series at Harvard and Johns Hopkins University, Hall secured a position in the philosophy department at Johns Hopkins, teaching psychology and pedagogy. He remained at Johns Hopkins from 1882 to 1888 and, in 1883, began the first formal American psychology laboratory. There, Hall objected to the emphasis on teaching traditional subjects, e.g., Latin, mathematics, science and history, in high school, arguing instead that high school should focus more on the education of adolescents than on preparing students for college.

Hall was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888.

===Later career (psychology)===
In 1887, Hall founded the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;, and in 1892 was elected the first president of the American Psychological Association. In 1889 he was named the first president of Clark University, a post he filled until 1920. During his 31 years as president, Hall remained intellectually active. He was instrumental in the development of educational psychology, and attempted to determine the effect adolescence has on education. He was also responsible for inviting Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung to visit and deliver a lecture series in 1909 at the Clark University Vicennial Conference on Psychology and Pedagogy. Hall promised Freud an honorary degree from Clark University in exchange, and the two shared the same beliefs on sex and adolescence. This was Freud&#x27;s first and only visit to America and the biggest conference held at Clark University. It was also the most controversial conference, given that Freud&#x27;s research was based on theories that Hall&#x27;s colleagues criticized as non-scientific.

In 1917, Hall published a book on religious psychology, &quot;Jesus the Christ in the Light of Psychology&quot;. The book was written in two volumes to define Jesus Christ in psychological terms. Hall thoroughly discussed all that is written about Christ, and the probable mental processes of Christ and all of those who believed in him and wrote about him. He analyzes the myths, the magic, etc., built up about the name and life of Christ. He dissects the parables and discusses the miracles, the death and the resurrection of Jesus. He endeavors to reduce all possible expressions or trends which he finds in Jesus and his followers to their genetic origins, and with that aid in comparative psychology, especially the knowledge of anthropology and childhood tendencies, he points out here and there certain universal trends which are at the bottom of it all. This was his least successful work. In 1922, at the age of 78, he published the book &quot;Senescence&quot;, a book on aging.

Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution and Ernst Haeckel&#x27;s recapitulation theory were large influences on Hall&#x27;s career. These ideas prompted Hall to examine aspects of childhood development in order to learn about the inheritance of behavior. The subjective character of these studies made their validation impossible. He believed that as children develop, their mental capabilities resemble those of their ancestors and so they develop over a lifetime the same way that species develop over eons. Hall believed that the process of recapitulation could be sped up through education and force children to reach modern standards of mental capabilities in a shorter length of time. His work also delved into controversial portrayals of the differences between women and men, as well as the concept of racial eugenics. While Hall was a proponent of racial eugenics, his views were less severe in terms of creating and keeping distinct separations between races. Hall believed in giving &quot;lower races&quot; a chance to accept and adapt to &quot;superior civilization&quot;. Hall even commended high ranking African Americans in society as being &quot;exception to the Negro&#x27;s diminished evolutionary inheritance&quot;. Hall viewed civilization in a similar fashion he viewed biological development. Humans must allow civilization to &quot;run its natural evolution&quot;. Hall saw those who did not accept the superior civilization as being primitive &quot;savages&quot;. Hall viewed these civilizations in a similar fashion as he viewed children, stating that &quot;their faults and their virtues are those of childhood and youth&quot;. Hall believed that men and women should be separated into their own schools during puberty because it allowed them to be able to grow within their own gender. Women could be educated with motherhood in mind and the men could be educated in more hands-on projects, helping them to become leaders of their homes. Hall believed that schools with both sexes limited the way they could learn and softened the boys earlier than they should be. &quot;It is a period of equilibrium, but with the onset of puberty the equilibrium is disturbed and new tendencies arise. Modifications in the reproductive organs take place and bring about secondary sexual characteristics. Extroversion gives way slowly to introversion, and more definitely social instincts begin to play an increasing role.&quot;

Hall was heavily influenced by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and his theory of evolution. Hall found the idea of passing on memories from parent to offspring was a plausible mode of inheritance.

===Anomalistic psychology===
Hall was one of the founding members and a vice President of the American Society for Psychical Research. The early members of the society were skeptical of paranormal phenomena. Hall took a psychological approach to psychical phenomena. By 1890 he had resigned from the society. He became an outspoken critic of parapsychology.

Hall was an early psychologist in the field of anomalistic psychology. Hall and his assistant Amy Tanner from Clark University were notable debunkers of spiritualism and carried out psychological and physiological tests on mediums. Tanner published &quot;Studies in Spiritism&quot; (1910) with an introduction by Hall. The book documented the tests carried out by Hall and Tanner in the séance sittings held with the medium Leonora Piper. Hall and Tanner had proven by tests that the personalities of Piper were fictitious creations and not discarnate spirits.

==Guiding views==

===Social views===
Hall was deeply wedded to the German concept of &quot;Volk&quot;, an anti-individualist and authoritarian romanticism in which the individual is dissolved into a transcendental collective. Hall believed that humans are by nature non-reasoning and instinct driven, requiring a charismatic leader to manipulate their herd instincts for the well-being of society. He predicted that the American emphasis on individual human right and dignity would lead to a fall that he analogized to the sinking of Atlantis.

Hall was one of the founders of the child-study movement in the 1880s. A national network of study groups called Hall Clubs existed to spread his teaching. He is popularly known today for supervising the 1896 study &quot;Of Peculiar and Exceptional Children&quot;, which described a series of only child eccentrics as permanent misfits. For decades, academics and advice columnists alike disseminated his conclusion that an only child could not be expected to go through life with the same capacity for adjustment that siblings possessed. &quot;Being an only child is a disease in itself&quot;, he claimed.

Hall argued that child development recapitulates his highly racialized conception of the history of human evolutionary development. He characterized pre-adolescent children as savages and therefore rationalized that reasoning was a waste of time with children. He believed that children must simply be led to fear God, love country, and develop a strong body. As the child burns out the vestiges of evil in his nature, he needs a good dose of authoritarian discipline, including corporal punishment. He believed that adolescents are characterized by more altruistic natures than pre-adolescents and that high schools should indoctrinate students into selfless ideals of service, patriotism, body culture, military discipline, love of authority, awe of nature, and devotion to the state and the well-being of others. Hall consistently argued against intellectual attainment at all levels of public education. Open discussion and critical opinions were not to be tolerated. Students needed indoctrination to save them from the individualism that was so damaging to the progress of American culture.

Hall popularized the phrase &quot;storm and stress&quot; with reference to adolescence, taken from the German &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement. His colleague William Burnham had published this phrase in relation to adolescence in an 1889 article titled &#x27;Economy in Intellectual Work&#x27;. The concept&#x27;s three key aspects are conflict with parents, mood disruptions, and risky behavior. As was later the case with the work of Lev Vygotsky and Jean Piaget, public interest in this phrase, as well as with Hall&#x27;s role, faded. Recent research has led to some reconsideration of the phrase and its denotation. In its three aspects, recent evidence supports storm and stress, but only when modified to take into account individual differences and cultural variations. Currently, psychologists do not accept storm and stress as universal, but do acknowledge the possibility in brief passing. Not all adolescents experience storm and stress, but storm and stress is more likely during adolescence than at other ages.

Hall had no sympathy for the poor, the sick, or those with developmental differences or disabilities. A firm believer in selective breeding and forced sterilization, he believed that any respect or charity toward those he viewed as physically, emotionally, or intellectually weak or &quot;defective&quot; simply interfered with the movement of natural selection toward the development of a super-race.

Hall&#x27;s major books were &quot;Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relations to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime and Religion&quot; (1904) and &quot;Aspects of Child Life and Education&quot; (1921). In his book &quot;Adolescence&quot;, which was based on the results of the child-study movement, Hall described his system of psychology (which he called &quot;genetic psychology&quot;) and the evolutionary benefits of development from the womb to adolescence. The book comprises six sections: biological and anthropological standpoint, medical standpoint, health and its tests, nobility of educated women, fecundity of educated women, and education. Hall hoped that this book would become a guide for teachers and social workers in the education system.

In 1904, Hall published &quot;Adolescence: Its Psychology and Its Relation to Physiology, Anthropology, Sociology, Sex, Crime, Religion, and Education&quot;. In this 2-volume study, based on the idea that child development recapitulates human evolution, Hall took on a variety of issues and synthesized scholarship from a wide range of disciplines. After his retirement in 1920, Hall wrote a companion volume on aging. This important account has been labeled &quot;prophetic&quot; in its recognition of an emerging &quot;crisis of aging&quot; in the 20th century, in which longer lifespan, narrowing family roles, and expulsion from the workforce combined to dramatically isolate the elderly and restrict their active participation in public life. Hall railed against this process, arguing that the wisdom conferred by old age meant that the elderly had valuable and creative contributions to make to society. Yet, the stigma of aging meant that, instead, many were engaged in the foolish pursuit of youth, trying to avoid being excluded from full participation in their communities. In the conclusion of the book, Hall expressed a tangible sense of personal anger against this form of discrimination. His stirring call for a better understanding of the aging process anticipated the development of gerontology, and his critique of the marginalization of the elderly still resonates today.

Hall viewed masturbation as an immoral act and a blemish of the human race that interfered with moral and intellectual growth. Hall discussed masturbation in reference to men and did not discuss it in terms of women. It is not known whether he knew this act occurred in women or that Hall believed adolescent boys must go through what he described as &quot;conversion&quot;. This conversion releases the boys from biological sins that were passed onto them by their ancestors. This passing on of sins through generations is guided by Lamarckian evolution. He claimed that conversion occurred as naturally as a &quot;blossoming flower&quot;. Instead of masturbation, Hall viewed spontaneous emissions as a natural and acceptable alternative to forced ejaculation. Hall believed that he went through conversion during his freshman year at Williams College.

Hall also coined the technical words describing types of tickling: knismesis, or feather-like tickling; and gargalesis, for the harder, laughter inducing type.

Hall is best remembered for his contributions to psychology, for his support of applied psychology, and for his success in advising many doctoral students who have made great contributions to psychology. Hall also mentored the first African American to get a PhD in psychology, Francis Cecil Sumner in 1920.

===Religious views===
Hall is listed in the &quot;Cambridge Companion to Atheism&quot; as having been an atheist. Hall was a pioneer in the school of religious psychology. He was exposed to Christianity by his pious mother as a child. While he attended Williston Seminary School, he joined the college church and instructed adult bible classes. He is quoted as saying, &quot;highest choice of free will is self surrender to the service of God&quot;, as well as &quot;love fixed in the highest being, God&quot;. He moved on to attend Union Theological Seminary in New York in 1867. Interested in comparative religion, he took a position at the city missionary society and attended multiple types of religious services. After graduation, Hall served at a small church in Pennsylvania for a short while, before leaving to further his studies. Hall promoted religion as the reinstatement of the individual into their true place in the world, a return to health and wholeness. Hall would later teach religious psychology at Johns Hopkins and Clark School of Religious Psychology. He also founded a library department for religious psychology.

===Views on eugenics===

Hall expressed openly eugenic views in many of his writings. He was listed in numerous American eugenic organizations as its leader. The &quot;Eugenical News&quot; (1916–1922) celebrated the development of new American eugenic scholarly organization by highlighting that its roster included such as in the following announcement about &quot;new active members of Eugenics Research Association ... C. C. Brigham, Psychological Laboratory, Princeton, N. J., G. Stanley Hall, Clark University, C. E. Seashore, State University of Iowa, Lewis, M. Terman, Stanford University, Calif., John B. Watson, Johns Hopkins Hospital&quot; (p. 53). Although Hall is credited with bringing notable psychoanalytic scholars to the U.S., including S. Freud and C. Jung, Hall expressed openly anti-psychoanalytic views in his writings that emphasized his eugenic commitments. For example, in the first issue of the &quot;Journal of Applied Psychology&quot;, of which Stanley G. Hall (1917) was an editor, his opening article proclaimed that the U.S. psychology had to &quot;draw any lesson ... from the present war, in which the great Nordic race which embraces the dominant elements of all the belligerent nations is committing suicide&quot; (p. 9) The most significant of these lessons, according to Hall, was for American psychology to fight against the &quot;revisionary conceptions of Freud ... that it is ... normal for man at times to plunge back and down the evolutionary ladder&quot; (p. 12).

Hall included openly anti-Semitic statements in his writings such as in his book &quot;On the Aspects of German Culture&quot; in which he discussed the supposed destruction of Western civilization by &quot;rapacious Jews&quot;, though such statements were more often made to criticize than to condone anti-Semitism, as suggested in the quote: &quot;they [the Jews] have been made the scapegoat for evils which they have not caused.&quot; Hall remarked, perhaps out of anti-Semitic feeling, that the psychoanalytic focus on &quot;sex&quot; in addition to this approach&#x27;s &quot;rapid growth ... found outside the circle of specialists [academic experimental psychologists]&quot; made psychoanalysis and &quot;the number of out-and-out disciples&quot; to be a form of a &quot;cult&quot; (p. 412). Moreover, Hall stated that the &quot;Freudian theory of therapy ... is mistaken&quot; (p. 12), giving a warning example of how an individual&#x27;s culturally unacceptable sexual desires and behaviors could be justified through psychoanalytic interpretations rather than &quot;cured by the very modesty&quot; based on cultural or religious norms (p. 13).

Hall held Victorian moral positions in regard to sexuality which regarded all divergent sexual experiences as amoral, including masturbation, same-sex sexuality, sex outside of marriage, and so forth. Hall claimed that psychoanalytic treatment would &quot;destroy&quot; this religious &quot;morality&quot; during the process of analysis (p. 13). In his book &quot;Jesus, the Christ, In the Light of Psychology&quot; Hall openly praised eugenics and discussed that the presence of supposedly evolutionary unfit people (i.e., the poor, racial minorities, immigrants) served the purpose of teaching the evolutionary fit people (i.e., Nordic wealthy Whites) virtues of caring for the lower classes. Other openly eugenic writings by Hall include his 1903 article entitled &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden versus Indigenous Development of the Lower Races&quot; in &quot;The Journal of Education&quot;. A majority of American eugenic organizations listed Hall as the leader in this thought (e.g., American Eugenic Society, American Eugenic Research Organization). His students included many notable eugenicists, including H. H. Goddard, Robert Yerkes, Lewis Terman, and many others.

==Literary activities==
An important contributor to educational literature, and a leading authority in that field, he founded and was editor of the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;. In addition, he edited the &quot;Pedagogical Seminary&quot; (after 1892), the &quot;American Journal of Religious Psychology and Education&quot; (after 1904), and the &quot;Journal of Race Development&quot; (after 1910). 
Hall was, from his student days to his death, interested in philosophy, psychology, education and religion in every one of their aspects which did not involve detailed experimentation, intricate quantitative treatment of results, or rigor and subtlety of analysis. There was, however, an order of emphasis, the years from &#x27;80 to &#x27;90 being devoted to problems of general psychology and education, those from 1890 to 1905 being especially devoted to the concrete details of human life, particularly the life of children and adolescents, and those from 1905 on being more devoted to wide-reaching problems of man&#x27;s emotional, ethical and religious life.

== Legacy and honors ==
Hall contributed a large amount of work in understanding adolescent development, some of which still holds true today. Hall observed that males tend to have an increase in sensation seeking and aggression during adolescence. Hall also observed an increase in crime rates during the adolescent years. He noted that in terms of aggression there are two types; relational aggression and physical aggression. Relational aggression relates to gossiping, rumor spreading, and exclusions of others. Hall noted that relational aggression occurs more frequently in females while physical aggression occurs more often in males.

Much of the mark that Hall left behind was from his expansion of psychology as a field in the United States. He did a lot of work to bring psychology to the United States as a legitimate form of study and science. He began the first journal dedicated only to psychology in the United States of America, called the &quot;American Journal of Psychology&quot;. He was also the first president of the American Psychological Association. All of the work that Hall did in the field of psychology and for psychology in the United States of America allowed for all the other psychologists to follow in his foot steps and to become psychologists in the United States. Without the effort from Hall it could have taken many more years for psychology to become a field in the United States.

The World War II Liberty Ship was named in his honor.

== Personal life==
Hall was married twice. His first wife was Cornelia Fisher. They were married September 1879 and had two children: Robert Granville Hall, born February 7, 1881; and Julia Fisher Hall, born May 30, 1882.

In 1890, Cornelia and Julia died of accidental asphyxiation. Robert was raised by his father from the age of four. He became a doctor.

Hall&#x27;s second wife was Florence E Smith; they married in July 1899. Florence was diagnosed with &quot;arteriosclerosis of the brain&quot; and was institutionalized after years of eccentric behaviors.

Hall died on April 24, 1924, in Worcester, Massachusetts.
