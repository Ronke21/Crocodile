<text>St. Andrew&#x27;s is a private, Episcopal, co-educational 100% boarding school near Middletown, Delaware. It is one of only three co-ed college preparatory schools in the United States where all students board. St. Andrew&#x27;s has 318 students, and is highly selective, accepting 18% for the 2021–2022 school year.

Despite its relatively small student body, it has one of the largest secondary school campuses in the United States, spanning 2,200 acres. In 2024, Architectural Digest named St. Andrew&#x27;s one of the &quot;World&#x27;s 9 Most Beautiful Boarding Schools.&quot; St. Andrew&#x27;s offers 130 courses each year, in 10 disciplines.

== Tuition and financial aid ==
Since the founding of the school in 1929, St. Andrew’s has been a boarding school that meets 100% of demonstrated need. In 2020-2021, student tuition cost was $62,150 for the 2021–2022 school year, with 47% of students receiving some form of financial aid. St. Andrew&#x27;s granted approximately $7.2 million in financial aid in 2022–2023, with a grant average of $49,102.

==History==
St. Andrew&#x27;s was founded in 1929 by A. Felix du Pont (1879–1948). He was a member of the du Pont family. The school was founded to provide a top education for boys of all socio-economic backgrounds, regardless of their families&#x27; ability to pay. St. Andrew&#x27;s was originally a boys&#x27; school, but became coeducational in 1973.

==Film appearances==
The 1989 coming-of-age drama film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; directed by Peter Weir and starring Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, and Ethan Hawke was filmed almost entirely on the school grounds. The school was known as Welton Academy in the movie.

It also served as the filming location of the young President Bartlet&#x27;s boarding school in the television series &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode entitled &quot;Two Cathedrals&quot; (number 44).

<text>A crash dive is a maneuver by a submarine in which the vessel submerges as quickly as possible to avoid attack. Crash diving from the surface to avoid attack has been largely rendered obsolete with the advent of nuclear-powered submarines, as they normally operate submerged. However, the crash dive is also a standard maneuver to avoid a collision.

A crash dive in a diesel-powered submarine requires careful orchestration of the crew. On German U-boats of World War II, a crash dive began with the Captain or senior lookouts giving the order &quot;Alarm!&quot; which led to a bridge officer activating the alarm bell. All crew members then immediately stopped what they were doing and proceeded to their diving stations. Once the lookouts were below deck and the upper deck hatch was secured, the Captain or Chief Engineer shouted the order, &quot;Fluten&quot; (&quot;flood the tanks&quot;). With the bow planes at a maximum down angle, the crew then flooded the forward ballast tanks. Often, all available crew members moved as far forward in the boat as practical (a &quot;trim party&quot;). This extra weight forward gave the boat a bow-down angle so its momentum helped pull it below the surface. A few seconds later, the crew would flood the rear ballast tanks to prevent the bow-down angle from lifting the boat&#x27;s stern out of the water. The entire crash dive was generally coordinated by the chief engineer.

Before hatches and air induction vents fall below the surface they must be closed. Before that, the diesel engines must be stopped or they will suck the air out of the boat in a matter of seconds. On submarines with direct drive, the crew disengages the diesel engines from the propeller shafts and switches to electric motor propulsion. The motors run at high speed to maintain the forward momentum. Once all hatches and induction vents are closed, the diving planes (like the control surfaces of an airplane) pull the boat below the surface and level it out at the desired depth—typically between . In a World War II-era boat, the whole operation could take as little as 30 seconds with a well-trained crew. In contrast, an ballistic-missile submarine may take as long as five minutes to reach periscope depth from the surface. However, it is capable of doing so faster if required; the smaller, more agile attack submarines can dive quite rapidly. The crash diving rate of a missile submarine is also not relevant since it can stay submerged for very long periods of time, and is not expected to ever cruise on the surface when in range of enemy units of any type. A WWII era submarine (technically a &quot;submersible&quot; since it is only capable of diving for limited periods of time) is by design forced to spend much of its time on the surface, and therefore needs to be able to &quot;escape&quot; by diving when an enemy is spotted.

In extreme emergencies, submarines have had to crash dive so quickly that lookouts were left on-deck. Such was the only survivor of &quot;U-68&quot; when the four lookouts were left top-side as she crash dived among exploding aerial bombs. Commander Howard Gilmore earned the Medal of Honor posthumously during World War II by ordering a crash dive (&quot;Take her down!&quot;) while wounded and unable to leave the bridge of .

<doc id="926649" wikidata="Q551648" url="?curid=926649" title="Jules Dalou">
<text>Aimé-Jules Dalou (; 31 December 183815 April 1902) was a 19th-century French sculptor, admired for his perceptiveness, execution, and unpretentious realism.

==Early life==
Born in Paris to a working-class family of Huguenot background, he was raised in an atmosphere of secularity and Republican socialism. He was the pupil of Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux, who sponsored him for the Petite École (future École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs), where he sympathized with Alphonse Legros and Fantin-Latour.

In 1854, he attended the École des Beaux-Arts de Paris in the François-Joseph Duret classroom. He combined the vivacity and richness of Carpeaux, for &quot;he was, technically, one of the most distinguished modellers of his time&quot;, with the academic insistence on harmonious outlines and scholarly familiarity with the work of Giambologna, Pierre Puget, Peter Paul Rubens and others.

==Career==

Dalou first exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1861, but he made no secret of his working-class sympathies. His politics obstructed his career under the Second Empire: he was repeatedly refused the Prix de Rome that opened sculptors&#x27; careers to future official commissions. He started to work for decorators, and through this work met Auguste Rodin and began their friendship.

He made a quiet living providing decorative sculpture for the structures that lined Paris&#x27;s new boulevards and providing wax models for jewelry. He married Irma Vuillier, a partnership that sustained him throughout his life. They had one daughter, Georgette, who was mentally handicapped and required constant care. Dalou&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; shown at the Paris salon of 1869, was purchased by the State.

Having identified himself too publicly with the Paris Commune of 1871, as curator at the Musée du Louvre under Gustave Courbet, he took refuge in England in July 1871, staying at first with his friend the painter and engraver Alphonse Legros. He rapidly made a name through his appointment teaching at the South London Technical Art School and the South Kensington School of Art, also in London. He was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by the French government of participation in the Commune, and given a life sentence.
===English exile===

In his eight-year English exile, Dalou&#x27;s association with City and Guilds of London Art School, the National Art Training School and the artists of the New Sculpture movement laid the foundation for new developments in the post-classical British school of sculpture. He also recommended his friend and colleague Édouard Lantéri to move from France to England. At the same time Dalou executed a remarkable series of terracotta statuettes and groups, such as &quot;A French Peasant Woman&quot; and &quot;The Reader&quot;; a series of Boulogne women, such as &quot;A Woman of Boulogne telling her Beads&quot;; and a series of informal terracotta portrait busts of friends and acquaintances, rarely signed. He was commissioned to produce the large public fountain called &quot;Charity&quot;, erected at the back of the Royal Exchange (1878), and for Queen Victoria a monument to two young granddaughters in her private chapel at Windsor (1878).

===Return to France===

He returned to France in 1879, after the declaration of amnesty, and produced a number of masterpieces. His great relief of &quot;Mirabeau replying to Dreux-Brézé&quot; illustrating an encounter of 23 June 1789, which was exhibited in 1883 and later at the Palais Bourbon, and the highly decorative panel &quot;Fraternity&quot; were followed in 1885 by &quot;The Triumph of Silenus&quot;. For the city of Paris he executed his most elaborate and splendid achievement, the vast monument, &quot;The Triumph of the Republic&quot;, erected after twenty years of work in the Place de la Nation, showing a symbolical figure of the Republic, aloft on her car, drawn by lions led by Liberty, attended by Labour and Justice, and followed by Abundance. It is somewhat in the taste of the Louis XIV period, ornate, but with a forward thrust to the ensemble and exquisite in every detail.

Within a few days, his great &quot;Monument to Alphand&quot; (1899), which almost equalled the success achieved by the &quot;Monument to Delacroix&quot; in the Luxembourg Garden, was inaugurated.

The last of his works, cast posthumously, were a statue of Lazare Hoche in Quiberon (1902), the &quot;Monument to Gambetta&quot; in Bordeaux (1904), the &quot;Monument to Émile Levassor&quot; (1907) and the &quot;Monument to Scheurer-Kestner&quot; (1908) in Paris.

Dalou, who was awarded the Grand Prix of the Exposition Universelle (1889), was made a commander of the Legion of Honor. He was one of the founders of the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, and was the first president of the sculpture section.

==Death and legacy==
Dalou died in Paris on 15 April 1902, aged 63, and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse in Paris. His auction record, set at Sotheby&#x27;s on 21 May 2014 is £362,500 for &quot;Boulonnaise Allaitant Son Enfant&quot; (a young mother from Boulogne feeding her child).

<doc id="926664" wikidata="Q700116" url="?curid=926664" title="Edenbridge (band)">
<text>Edenbridge is an Austrian symphonic metal led by songwriter Arne &quot;Lanvall&quot; Stockhammer and fronted by soprano singer Sabine Edelsbacher. Established in 1998, the band has released eleven studio albums so far.

==History==
===1998–2004===
Edenbridge was formed in 1998 by guitarist and keyboardist Lanvall, singer Sabine Edelsbacher, and bassist Kurt Bednarsky. The line-up was completed when drummer Roland Navratil joined the band. Edenbridge entered the recording studio in 1999, signing a record deal with Massacre Records the same year. In the following year, their debut album &quot;Sunrise in Eden&quot; was released.

The band added a second guitarist, Georg Edelmann, to its line-up in February 2000, but his stay with the band was to be a short one. When he left in January 2001, he was replaced by Andreas Eiblar. Under this line-up, Edenbridge released the album &quot;Arcana&quot; (2001). During a tour in 2002, Edenbridge&#x27;s bassist and founding member Kurt Bednarsky left the band. In December 2003, the album &quot;Aphelion&quot; was released.

Their next album, recorded live and entitled &quot;A Livetime In Eden&quot;, was released in August 2004, followed by the studio album &quot;Shine&quot; in October. At that time, a new bassist, Frank Bindig, joined the band. In December the same year, guitarist Andreas Eibler left the band and was replaced by Martin Mayr.

===Napalm Records, more personnel changes===
&quot;The Grand Design&quot; (2006), their fifth studio album, was recorded at Lanvall&#x27;s studio Farpoint Station and was released on 19 May 2006 in Europe, and on 30 January 2007 in America. The single &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; was released on 21 April 2006 featuring the album track &quot;Evermore&quot; and a cover version of the James Bond theme of &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot;, the first cover the band ever recorded. The following year, Edenbridge signed a worldwide deal with Napalm Records.

Edenbridge released &quot;MyEarthDream&quot; in April 2008. The album features the Czech Film Orchestra, with arrangements by Enrique Ugarte. In November 2008 bass player Frank Bindig left, and he was replaced the next year by Simon Holzknecht; Dominik Sebastian joined on guitar. A few days later, on 4 May 2009, Edenbridge released &quot;LiveEarthDream&quot;, a limited-edition live album recorded in 2008.

&quot;Solitaire&quot; was released on 2 July 2010 and charted at number 95 in Germany. In February 2010, bassist Simon Holzknecht left the band.

In 2012, the band asked fans to help sponsor the new album&#x27;s orchestra recordings. In late 2012, all orchestra and drum recordings had been completed. Bassist Wolfgang Rothbauer who formerly played for Disbelief and Zombie Inc. joined Edenbridge in 2013. The eighth studio album &quot;The Bonding&quot; was released in June 2013.

Lanvall and Sabine began a side project, &quot;Voiciano&quot;, in February 2014. It focuses exclusively on acoustical music and released their first album, &quot;Everflow&quot;, in 2014.

In November 2014 the band announced their first video album, called &quot;A Decade and a Half... The History So Far&quot; to celebrate their 15th anniversary. The video album contains early beginnings of the band, tour and studio documentaries and live concerts from 1998 to 2014. The album was released on 8 May 2015.

The ninth studio album, &quot;The Great Momentum&quot;, was released on 17 February 2017. It reached position 80 in the Swiss album charts and 82 in Germany.

On 26 August 2022, they released their eleventh studio album titled &quot;Shangri-La&quot;. The album is the band&#x27;s first album under AFM records.

<text>Robert Lee Dodd (November 11, 1908 – June 21, 1988) was an American college football player and coach, college baseball coach, and college athletics administrator. He served as the head football coach at Georgia Tech from 1945 to 1966, compiling a record of 165–64–8. His teams won consecutive Southeastern Conference (SEC) title in 1951 and 1952, and his 1952 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team won the 1953 Sugar Bowl and was recognized as a national champion by a number of selectors though they finished second behind Michigan State in both major polls. Dodd was also Georgia Tech&#x27;s head baseball coach from 1932 to 1939, tallying a mark of 43–64–2, and the school&#x27;s athletic director from 1950 until 1976. All together, Dodd served Georgia Tech 57 years in various capacities.

Dodd starred as quarterback at the University of Tennessee, playing for teams coached by Robert Neyland from 1928 to 1930. He also lettered in baseball, basketball, and track at Tennessee. He was a member of Sigma Nu fraternity. Dodd began his coaching career at Georgia Tech, working as an assistant under William Alexander from 1931 until succeeding Alexander as head football coach in 1945. Dodd was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and a coach in 1993. He is one of four individuals to be so honored, along with Amos Alonzo Stagg, Bowden Wyatt, and Steve Spurrier.

==Early life==
Robert Lee &quot;Bobby&quot; Dodd was born in 1908 in Galax, Virginia. He was named after Confederate General Robert E. Lee. Dodd was the youngest of Edwin and Susan Dodd&#x27;s four children. In the fall of 1921, the Dodd family relocated to Kingsport, Tennessee. When Dodd was twelve and weighed only 100 pounds, he made the seventh-grade team of Kingsport&#x27;s first organized football program. During the next three seasons, the Kingsport Indians were very successful, gaining two state titles. They were helped by Dodd, who moved from end to quarterback and kicker. Dodd is in the school&#x27;s hall of fame.

However, the happiness of Bobby Dodd&#x27;s early life came to a sad end in 1924 when his father committed suicide due to business failure and financial troubles. The family was forced to move, but was held together by the perseverance of Dodd&#x27;s mother. In 1926, Bobby Dodd graduated and was admitted to the University of Tennessee with a football scholarship. Dodd wanted to play for Georgia Tech but was not offered a scholarship.

==Player at Tennessee==

Dodd played college football as a quarterback, tailback, and punter for the Tennessee Volunteers football team from 1928 to 1930, under head coach Robert Neyland. He also won varsity letters in baseball, basketball, and track during his time at Tennessee. Dodd stood 6&#x27;1&quot;, weighed 170 pounds, and on the football team wore number 17. In the games that Dodd started at Tennessee, the Vols held a record of 27–1–2. He led Tennessee to back-to-back unbeaten seasons with identical 9–0–1 records his sophomore and junior years, leading the &quot;Hack and Mack&quot; backfield of Buddy Hackman and Gene McEver. Tennessee fans even developed a catch phrase for Dodd during his time there: &quot;In Dodd we trust&quot;.

Dodd twice earned All-Southern honors, in his junior and senior years. &quot;It is doubtful if any quarterback in the south can match Dodd on all-around ability. He is a fine passer, a punter of ability, and the greatest field general to ever grace southern turf since the days of the one and only Pooley Hubert&quot;, according to one newspaper article of this era. In 1959, Dodd was named to the University of Tennessee&#x27;s Hall of Fame and to the College Football Hall of Fame as a player. He was elected in the same year as teammate Herman Hickman. He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1920–1969 era team.

===1928===
During his sophomore year, his first year on the varsity, Dodd was the difference in the rivalry game against Alabama in Tuscaloosa, &quot;Dodd threw a touchdown pass in that game to tie Alabama, 13–13. Then he punted out of bounds inside the Alabama 1-yard line and Tennessee got a safety on the next play to win, 15–13.&quot; To close the season, Dodd led the Vols to a victory in the mud over previously undefeated Florida, replacing the injured starter Roy Witt.

===1929–1930===

The Vols went 33 games without a loss until an 18–6 setback against national champion Alabama in 1930, which ranks as the longest unbeaten streak in UT history. After the loss, Dodd and his teammates helped start a 28-game unbeaten streak that ranks as the second longest.

&quot;The Dodger&quot; again showed his versatility in a 13–0 win against Vanderbilt. Dodd finished with 14 punts with a 42-yard average, had nine carries for 39 yards, was 7-of-12 passing for 159 yards and two touchdowns and intercepted two passes. During that game, Dodd gained 212 all-purpose yards, collecting all but 14 of Tennessee&#x27;s team total of 226.

Another instance in Dodd&#x27;s career foreshadowed the creativity he would use in his coaching career.
&quot;Against Florida in 1930 he got his teammates in a huddle and told them about a play he had used in high school. When the ball was snapped, it was placed on the ground unattended. The players ran in one direction. Then the center returned, picked up the ball, and waltzed to the winning touchdown.&quot; 

The Vols finished the 1930 season with a 9–1 record. Dodd was named to Grantland Rice&#x27;s All-American team in 1930, making him the second ever granted that honor at Tennessee (following Gene McEver).

==Coach and athletic director at Georgia Tech==

After being recognized as 1928 national champions, the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team struggled during the next two seasons. Georgia Tech football coach William Alexander began looking for a new assistant. During the 1930 football season, Alexander sent his line coach, Mack Tharpe, to scout future opponent North Carolina, playing Tennessee in Knoxville. Tharpe&#x27;s car broke down and by the time he reached Knoxville, the game was over. Tharpe asked Tennessee head coach Bob Neyland for information, who suggested that he talk to Dodd. When Tharpe returned to Atlanta he told Alexander: &quot;Dodd&#x27;s analysis of Carolina is better than any scouting report that I could have made.&quot; Tech managed to tie the Tar Heels.

===Assistant (1931–1944)===
Alexander was also impressed by reports of Dodd&#x27;s performance during games. On December 27, 1930, Dodd signed a contract to join Alexander&#x27;s staff as backfield coach for the 1931 season. Dodd served as an assistant coach at Tech for 14 years, even though he received many offers for head coaching positions from other schools during that time frame. Dodd lionized Coach Alexander which was later reflected in his coaching style. &quot;He taught me to treat athletes as men, not boys – to never use their failings as an alibi for a loss&quot;, Dodd said.

===Head coach (1945–1966)===
Dodd took over the Georgia Tech football program with the late president Blake Van Leer&#x27;s support in 1945 following Coach Alexander&#x27;s retirement as head football coach. Dodd&#x27;s coaching philosophy revolved around player treatment and character development. He did not believe in intense physical practices but rather precise and well executed practices. Dodd&#x27;s philosophy translated to winning; he set the record for career wins at Tech with 165, including a 31-game unbeaten streak from 1951–1953. He also managed to capture two Southeastern Conference (SEC) championships (1951 and 1952) and the 1952 national title, which concluded a perfect 12–0 season and Sugar Bowl conquest of Ole Miss. Under Dodd&#x27;s leadership, Tech played in 13 major bowl games, winning 9, including six in a row. Bobby Dodd compiled a 165–64–8 record as head coach at Georgia Tech.
Football was Dodd&#x27;s lifelong passion, but at Tech he was just as obsessed with the notion that his players should get an education as he was with teaching them how to play football. Other coaches and sportswriters of his era were united in their puzzlement that anyone could coach with such a light hand and still win so many games. However, Coach Dodd knew that his &quot;Books First&quot; reputation caused parents to favor Georgia Tech over his competition.

Georgia Tech football was Atlanta&#x27;s one major sports franchise during this time frame. To hold a ticket to watch the Yellow Jackets play was highly valued and was difficult to obtain. During the games, Bobby Dodd sat in a folding chair at a card table on the side line, rarely standing or showing interest in the game. Dodd took his seat and left the pacing to his assistants. When a crisis arose, Dodd would decide which plays to be run and the designated players to run them. Dodd sometimes made unusual substitutions, as in the 1952 game against Georgia, when Georgia Tech seemed about to be upset. Dodd sent in a small halfback who had been frequently injured during his career, who then broke to the right faking a run, stopped, threw a pass for a touchdown and returned to the bench. What Dodd brought to Grant Field was a kind of unbruising football other coaches couldn&#x27;t understand: runty halfbacks; lightweight linemen; rarely a classic quarterback. Once free substitution became possible, no one made more use of it than Dodd.

===Rivalries===
====Alabama====
Georgia Tech had an intense rivalry with the University of Alabama which ended during Bobby Dodd&#x27;s tenure as head football coach. Until that time, the matchup between the Crimson Tide and the Yellow Jackets was a fall football classic. The two teams have met on the gridiron a total of 52 times with Georgia Tech coming away victorious in 21 of those matchups, with 3 ties. Bobby Dodd&#x27;s football teams won 7 of 17 games played against Alabama. The contests were annual events until Georgia Tech withdrew from the SEC.

Dodd considered his two biggest victories to have come against Alabama, including a 7–3 victory in 1952 and a 7–6 victory in 1962. The former victory secured a perfect season for Georgia Tech which led to a national title. The latter victory came against a top ranked Alabama team and cost the Crimson Tide another national title. Alabama head coach Bear Bryant once said that he would rather look across the field and see anyone other than Bobby Dodd.

====Georgia====
Dodd also understood the deep-seated rivalry with the Georgia Bulldogs. His teams won eight games in a row over Georgia from 1949 to 1956, outscoring the Bulldogs 176–39. This 8–game winning streak is still the longest winning streak for either side in the series and commonly referred to as &quot;The Drought&quot; by UGA football fans. Dodd finish his career with a 12–10 record against the Bulldogs.

===&quot;Dodd&#x27;s luck&quot;===
By the end of his coaching career, Dodd had built a reputation not only as a good coach, but also as a lucky one. Georgia Tech often played teams that were physically superior but Bobby Dodd would still find a way to win. The experts called it &quot;Dodd&#x27;s luck&quot;, but his success actually came from an understanding of motivational psychology, football strategy, and innovative game-planning. University of Georgia&#x27;s longtime football coach Wallace Butts once said &quot;If Bobby Dodd were trapped in the center of an H-Bomb explosion, he&#x27;d walk away with his pockets full of marketable uranium.&quot; However, the following describes Dodd&#x27;s perspective regarding his luck:

===Athletic director (1950–1976)===
In 1967, Dodd stepped down as head football coach due to health concerns, and he was succeeded by assistant Bud Carson. Dodd simply retained his athletic director position, which he had acquired in 1950 from William Alexander. Dodd retired as athletic director in 1976 and was followed in the position by Doug Weaver. Dodd continued to serve during his retirement years as an Alumni Association consultant and as a fundraiser for Georgia Tech. In 1983, he expressed interest in running a United States Football League team if Atlanta were awarded one, but the league folded before Atlanta received a team.

==Legacy==
Dodd was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a player in 1959 and as a coach in 1993. He was voted Southeastern Conference Coach of the Year by his fellow coaches in 1951, and &quot;National Coach of the Year&quot; by the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; poll in 1952. After retiring, he was awarded a special &quot;Citation of Honor&quot; by the Football Writers Association of America for his accomplishments and contributions to football. Dodd also developed 22 recognized All-America football players as head football coach. Dodd was also inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in 1973. Coach Dodd has also received honors not related to football. The Bobby Dodd Institute is an organization that helps people with disabilities; it is named in honor of Coach Dodd for his assistance to the disabled.

===Bobby Dodd Stadium===

Georgia Tech named its stadium Bobby Dodd Stadium in honor of the legendary coach in April 1988, two months before he died. In 1989 part of Third Street located next to Bobby Dodd Stadium was rechristened Bobby Dodd Way. On Friday September 14, 2012, Georgia Tech provided another honor for the former coach by unveiling the Bobby Dodd statue in Callaway Plaza on the Georgia Tech campus, which was funded by former players for Coach Dodd. In attendance for the unveiling were the athletic director, members of the 1952 national championship squad, President of the Institute Bud Peterson, Head Coach Paul Johnson, and Bobby Dodd&#x27;s son and daughter.

===Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award===
While Bobby Dodd was a determined competitor, he cared deeply for those who played for him. Unlike some other coaches, he did not believe in winning at any costs; he truly believed that the most important aspect of college football was the college football player. As a testament to the character of Bobby Dodd, each year a Division I college coach whose team excels on the field, in the classroom, and in the community is awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award, presented by the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Foundation.

===Georgia Tech&#x27;s withdrawal from SEC===

Dodd&#x27;s tenure included Georgia Tech&#x27;s withdrawal from the Southeastern Conference (SEC) after the 1963 season.

====Feud with Bear Bryant====

The initial spark for Dodd&#x27;s withdrawal was a historic feud with Alabama Crimson Tide coach Bear Bryant. The feud began when Tech was playing the Tide at Legion Field in Birmingham in 1961. After a Tech punt, Alabama fair-caught the ball. Chick Graning of Tech was playing coverage and relaxed after the signal for the fair catch. Darwin Holt of Alabama continued play and smashed his elbow into Graning&#x27;s face, causing severe fracturing in his face, a broken nose, and blood-filled sinuses. Graning was knocked unconscious and suffered a severe concussion, the result of which left him unable to play football again. Dodd sent Bryant a letter asking Bryant to suspend Holt after game film indicated Holt had intentionally injured Graning; but Bryant never suspended Holt. The lack of discipline infuriated Dodd and sparked Dodd&#x27;s interest in withdrawing from the SEC. (Georgia Tech lost that game 10–0, and Alabama went on to win its first Associated Press national championship.)

====Over-recruitment====
Another issue of concern for Dodd was Alabama&#x27;s and other SEC schools&#x27; over-recruitment of players. Universities would recruit more players than available space on their rosters. During the summer the teams in question would cut the players well after signing day. This practice prevented the cut players from being able to play for other colleges during the following football season. Dodd appealed to the SEC administration to punish the &quot;tryout camps&quot; of his fellow SEC members but the SEC did not. Finally, Dodd withdrew Georgia Tech from the SEC after the 1963 football season. Tech would remain an independent like Notre Dame and Penn State (at the time) during the final three years of Dodd&#x27;s coaching tenure.

Dodd insisted the only reason he left the SEC was due to the &quot;140 Rule&quot;, which allowed colleges to over-recruit. The 140 Rule stated a college program could only have 140 football and basketball players on scholarship at any one time, but the teams were still allowed to sign up to 45 players a year. Therefore, if a school recruited its full allotment of players each year it would exceed the 140 maximum even with normal attrition. Dodd would sign about 30–32 football players a year to meet the guidelines, but the other schools in the SEC were offering 45 scholarships a year, and most were allotting all but a nominal amount to football. Players not good enough to fall under the 140 Rule had their scholarships withdrawn before the end of each year by the other schools. Dodd insisted the recruiting of athletes by this method amounted to nothing more than a tryout for a scholarship. Dodd would not allow any of the football players choosing Tech to be dismissed from Tech, just because they were not the best players. Dodd said, &quot;It is not the recruit&#x27;s fault for not making the squad, it was the coaches&#x27; fault for misjudging their talents.&quot; If a recruit came to Tech, he would stay on a football scholarship until he graduated.

Dodd wanted the SEC to limit the amount of scholarships to about 32 per year, which would keep the other schools from offering 45 scholarships, picking the best, and withdrawing scholarships from the rest. A vote was to be taken by the presidents of the colleges on the issue, and Dodd made it clear that Tech would leave the SEC unless the rule was changed. Bear had promised Dodd he would get his president to vote for Dodd&#x27;s position, which would have changed the rule; when the meeting was held on January 24, 1964, the Alabama president voted against Dodd&#x27;s position and the 140 Rule was upheld when the presidents split 6–6. Tech&#x27;s president immediately walked to the podium and announced Tech was withdrawing from the SEC.

===Integration===

During Bobby Dodd&#x27;s tenure, Georgia Tech played against several integrated football teams while the South was resisting integration. Georgia Tech played against Notre Dame in 1953 with Wayne Edmonds starting at offensive tackle and defensive end for the Irish. Edmonds was the first black player to win a monogram at Notre Dame. Georgia Tech lost to Notre Dame 27–14.
Georgia Tech also participated in the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South. The 1956 Sugar Bowl featured the 7th ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the 11th ranked Pitt Panthers. There was controversy over whether Bobby Grier from Pitt should be allowed to play because he was black, and whether Georgia Tech should even play at all due to Georgia governor Marvin Griffin&#x27;s opposition to integration. Governor Griffin threatened Tech&#x27;s Blake R. Van Leer publicly after he let the game go forward. Dodd would back Van Leer&#x27;s decision as well. Ultimately, Bobby Grier played, which made the game the first integrated Sugar Bowl and the first integrated bowl game in the Deep South.
Georgia Tech won the 1956 Sugar Bowl by the score 7–0.

As athletic director Dodd oversaw the integration of Georgia Tech&#x27;s football team. Eddie McAshan was the first African American football player to start for Georgia Tech. Bud Carson started McAshan in 1970 at quarterback as a sophomore and McAshan would go on to set several career records for Georgia Tech (which have since been broken by Shawn Jones and Joe Hamilton). McAshan&#x27;s first career start was on September 12, 1970, against South Carolina. His start marked the first time that an African American had ever started at quarterback for a major Southeastern university and McAshan did not disappoint. He rallied Tech from a fourth-quarter deficit, defeating the Gamecocks 23–20 with two late touchdown drives. McAshan threw for 32 touchdowns during his college football career, and Georgia Tech had a 22–13–1 record during that time frame.
====Coaching tree====
Many coaches have been influenced by Dodd&#x27;s style and approach to the game, including Vince Dooley, University of Georgia&#x27;s longtime football coach, who was the first recipient of the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. In addition, several assistant coaches for Bobby Dodd went on to have successful careers as head football coaches for other colleges, including Frank Broyles with Arkansas. Broyles led the Razorbacks to a 14–7 victory over the Yellow Jackets in the 1960 Gator Bowl, which was the first bowl game Georgia Tech had lost with Bobby Dodd as head coach.

Dodd&#x27;s coaching tree includes:
#Frank Broyles, Dodd assistant, coached at Arkansas
#Vince Dooley, influenced by Dodd&#x27;s style, coached at Georgia
#Ray Graves, Dodd assistant, coached at Florida 
#Pepper Rodgers, Tech quarterback, coached at Kansas
#Jim Carlen, Tech player and assistant, coached at Texas Tech, West Virginia, and South Carolina

==Family, personal life, and death==

Dodd married Alice Davis in 1933, and they had two children, Linda Dodd Thompson and Robert Lee Dodd Jr., who played quarterback for the University of Florida from 1960–61. Dodd Jr. had wanted to play for Georgia Tech, but Dodd thought it would be best if he played for another college. On October 1, 1960, Dodd Jr. contributed to Florida&#x27;s 18–17 upset of the Yellow Jackets at Florida Field with Ray Graves, Dodd&#x27;s former assistant, as Gator head coach.

Alice Davis was a younger sister to Wink Davis, who played halfback at Georgia Tech. Dodd met Alice in 1931 through Ed Hamm, who was the track coach. They went on a few double dates together before Bobby started dating Alice. They postponed their wedding until after the 1933 football season since Dodd was coaching his future brother-in-law.

Bobby Dodd and Bear Bryant ended their feud in 1975 after Bill Curry helped negotiate a peace settlement between the two old football coaches. As a result, Georgia Tech and Alabama resumed their series from 1979–1984.

Dodd stayed in touch with many of his former football players over the years and he was like a father to them until his death. &quot;The record I am most proud of&quot;, he said, &quot;is from all those years of coaching I probably don&#x27;t have five former players who are bitter at me or Georgia Tech...means more than the number of games we won.&quot; He died on June 21, 1988, at the age of 79, in Atlanta.

Alice Dodd was named honorary alumnus of the Georgia Tech Alumni Association in 1967. After her husband&#x27;s death in 1988, she continued to attend homecoming functions and special events, such as the 1991 Florida Citrus Bowl which led to Georgia Tech winning its fourth national championship. Dodd will be portrayed in the upcoming film &quot;Bowl Game Armageddon&quot; about the 1956 Sugar Bowl.

<text>Emily Drinkard (September 30, 1933 – October 7, 2024), known professionally as Cissy Houston, was an American soul and gospel singer. Born in Newark, New Jersey, Houston began singing with three of her siblings in the family gospel group, The Drinkard Singers. By the early 1960s, Houston began a career as a session vocalist for several secular musicians in the rhythm and blues, soul, rock and roll, pop and rock genres. After initially joining her nieces&#x27; group the Gospelaires for a session with Ronnie Hawkins in 1961, Houston gradually took control of the group, which revamped into &quot;The Group&quot; with Houston, niece Sylvia Shemwell, Myrna Smith and teenager Estelle Brown. She eventually founded the girl group The Sweet Inspirations with Shemwell, Smith and Brown in 1967 and that year signed a contract with Atlantic Records where, with Houston as lead singer, they would record four albums before Houston departed for a solo career in 1970. Her best known solo singles include the top 20 R&amp;B chart single, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and the top 5 dance single, &quot;Think It Over&quot;. Her solo career culminated with two Grammy Award wins, both in the Traditional Gospel Album category.

Besides her session work and work with the Sweet Inspirations, Houston was also best known as the mother of renowned singer and actress Whitney Houston, the aunt of singers Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, and the grandmother of Whitney Houston&#x27;s only child, Bobbi Kristina Brown. She was also a first cousin of opera singer Leontyne Price. Houston was honored by several institutions over her career. In 1990, she received the Stellar Award of Excellence for her contributions to gospel. Five years later, in 1995, Houston earned the Rhythm and Blues Foundation Pioneer Award for her contributions to rhythm and blues and soul music. With the Sweet Inspirations, Houston was inducted into the National Rhythm and Blues Hall of Fame in 2014 (same year as daughter Whitney) and, in 2019, was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame joining Whitney and niece Dionne.

==Early life==
Emily Drinkard was born on September 30, 1933 in Newark, New Jersey to Delia Mae &quot;Dee Dee&quot; (née McCaskill) and Nicholas &quot;Nitch&quot; Drinkard, the youngest of eight children. Houston was the granddaughter of a black landowner in Blakely, Georgia, who later shared the land he owned with Houston&#x27;s father Nitch during a time when it was unusual for black people to have large landholdings. The asset was gradually depleted as they sold small portions of land over time, to resolve the continued legal troubles of a close relative, which later led to the entire family relocating to Newark during the Great Migration a decade before Houston&#x27;s birth. Houston has claimed to be part Dutch and part Native American descent due to her grandparents Susan Bell (née Fuller) and John Drinkard Jr. respectively.

Houston&#x27;s parents emphasized the children getting educated and being involved in the church. Around the time of Houston&#x27;s fifth birthday, her mother Delia suffered a stroke. To help her recovery, along with raising the family&#x27;s spirits, Houston&#x27;s father encouraged Houston and her elder siblings Anne, Nicholas Jr. (&quot;Nicky&quot;) and Larry to sing sacred hymns, to which afterwards, they formed The Drinkard Four, singing jubilees in various churches, including their own St. Luke&#x27;s A.M.E. Church. Three years later, in 1941, Houston lost her mother to cerebral hemorrhage. Houston claimed that she &quot;found Christ&quot; after listening to a sermon at the age of fourteen. Houston&#x27;s father died of stomach cancer in March 1952 when Houston was 18. For a time, Houston went to live with her older sister Lee and her husband Mancel Warrick and helped to raise her four nieces Dionne, Dee Dee, Judy Guions and Sylvia Shemwell and nephew Mancel Jr. Soprano Leontyne Price is a Drinkard cousin. 
Houston attended South Side High School where she eventually graduated in 1952. Raised Methodist Episcopal, Houston converted to the Baptist faith after she joined the New Hope Baptist Church at around 19.

==Career==
===The Drinkard Singers===

Houston first began singing in the sibling jubilee quartet, the Drinkard Four, at the age of five. A little while later, they changed the name to the Drinkard Jubilairs and then, after the inclusions of sisters Lee and Marie (&quot;Reebie&quot;), the Drinkard Singers. Houston contended in her 2013 book, &quot;Remembering Whitney: A Mother&#x27;s Story of Love, Loss and the Night the Music Died&quot;, that the group didn&#x27;t sing professionally until radio announcer Joe Bostic hired them to open for Clara Ward and Mahalia Jackson at the first ever gospel showcase, named the &quot;Negro Gospel and Religious Music Festival&quot; at Carnegie Hall in October 1951. Not long after that, the group sang on Bostic&#x27;s &quot;Gospel Train&quot; New York radio show, becoming regulars on the program. 

In two October dates in 1954 and 1957, the group, which now included Houston&#x27;s adopted niece Judy, joined Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Mahalia Jackson as one of several gospel acts to perform at the Newport Jazz Festival, leading to appearances on two live albums recorded at the festival in those years. Shortly after their second Newport performance, they landed a recording deal with RCA Victor Records where they recorded and released the album, &quot;A Joyful Noise&quot;, in 1958, which made history as one of the first gospel albums to be released on a major label. 

By the early 1960s, the group landed on the Sunday morning television gospel show, &quot;TV Gospel Time&quot;. By the end of 1962, however, the group had permanently separated due to Houston&#x27;s growing career as a session vocalist for secular recording artists.

===The Sweet Inspirations===

By the early 1960s, Houston&#x27;s nieces Dionne and Dee Dee Warrick and Sylvia Shemwell and their close friend Doris Troy had found success under the group the Gospelaires, singing background for various artists including The Drifters. One night, around late 1961, when Dionne Warrick began working with producer Burt Bacharach, Houston&#x27;s then-boyfriend, John Houston Jr., who managed the Gospelaires, convinced Houston to replace Dionne for a session for Canadian-American rockabilly singer Ronnie Hawkins. After John Houston showed her the money she had made from the session, Houston was convinced to begin a professional singing career as a session vocalist, the group soon found themselves singing for artists such as Solomon Burke, Ben E. King and The Drifters. 

In 1962, Dionne Warrick permanently separated from the group for good to begin singing professionally, working exclusively with Bacharach and his songwriting partner Hal David on Scepter Records, leading to the Gospelaires now being Houston, Dee Dee Warwick, Doris Troy and Shemwell before Troy herself left at the end of 1962, leading to her being replaced by Myrna Smith. The group continued to back the newly rechristened Dionne Warwick and Troy on their solo hits, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me Over&quot; and &quot;Just One Look&quot;. Then, in 1963, Dee Dee Warrick left the group to began her own solo career. Her place was taken by 17-year-old Estelle Brown. The lineup of Houston, Shemwell, Smith and Brown was the nucleus to what became The Sweet Inspirations.

After singing background for the two Warwicks, Garnet Mimms, Wilson Pickett and Aretha Franklin among others for a number of years, the group was hired to back Irish soul singer Van Morrison on his composition, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, in 1967. After the song hit the top ten that year, Jerry Wexler of Atlantic Records offered the group, then going by the nickname &quot;The Group&quot;, a recording contract of their own and advised them to change their name to &quot;The Inspirations&quot;. Only after learning that another group had that name, Wexler added &quot;Sweet&quot; in front of their name. Their first album, &quot;The Sweet Inspirations&quot;, charted, reaching number 90 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number 12 on the Billboard Best-Selling R&amp;B Albums chart, producing three &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles, including their sole top twenty Hot 100 hit, &quot;Sweet Inspiration&quot;, which later earned the group a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rhythm &amp; Blues Performance by a Duo or Group. The group would record three more albums during Houston&#x27;s tenure and would continue to back up Aretha Franklin, who began to have a successful recording career after signing with Atlantic the same year as the Sweet Inspirations. The group backed Franklin on hits such as &quot;Think&quot;, &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman&quot;, &quot;(Sweet Sweet Baby) Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Way&quot;, the latter of which would feature Houston&#x27;s descant in the background. The group would also back Franklin during her concerts of this period and also occasionally appeared on TV with Franklin as they did on &quot;The Jonathan Winters Show&quot;. 

In addition, the group backed psychedelic rocker Jimi Hendrix on his song, &quot;Burning of the Midnight Lamp&quot;, which was later featured on Hendrix&#x27;s final studio album during his lifetime, &quot;Electric Ladyland&quot; and would also back up more artists such as Otis Redding, Lou Rawls and Dusty Springfield. In July 1969, the group was hired to back up Elvis Presley on the rocker&#x27;s first live performances in almost a decade at the International Hotel. Presley often introduced them at the shows by saying, &quot;They really live up to their name, ladies &amp; gentlemen: The Sweet Inspirations!&quot; The original Sweet Inspirations with Houston could be heard on the Presley live albums, &quot;All Shook Up&quot; and &quot;Live in Las Vegas&quot;. By September 1969, Houston had grown tired of performing on the road as her three children were growing up. That month, she decided to quit the Sweet Inspirations and stop touring to stay at home while also settling on a solo career. Houston would still mentor the remaining members at her home in East Orange, New Jersey and occasionally reunite with them during recording sessions, usually backing Franklin, who was by now a family friend and considered an honorary aunt to Houston&#x27;s three children, all of whom affectionately nicknamed her &quot;Aunt Ree&quot;.

===Solo career===
As Cecily Blair, Houston cut her first secular solo record &quot;This Is My Vow&quot; on M&#x27;n&#x27;M Records in 1963, following this up in 1966 with &quot;Bring Him Back&quot; b/w &quot;World Of Broken Hearts&quot; on Congress Records. Her final solo single before recording with The Sweet Inspirations was &quot;Don&#x27;t Come Running To Me&quot; b/w &quot;One Broken Heart For Sale&quot; released on Kapp Records in 1967. On these early singles, her name is spelled as Sissie Houston. 

In 1969, Houston signed a recording contract with Commonwealth United Records and recorded her solo debut LP &quot;Presenting Cissy Houston&quot; which was released in 1970. It contained several well received singles, including covers of &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There&quot; and &quot;Be My Baby&quot;, both of which made the R&amp;B charts as well as the pop charts. Following the release of her debut album, Houston&#x27;s contract was sold to Janus Records. She recorded another album and several more singles in the early 1970s, which included the original recording of Jim Weatherly&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Train to Georgia&quot; in 1972, which was a minor R&amp;B and UK hit for Houston and later became a number one hit for Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips. She continued to record with Janus Records until 1975. Houston performed as backing vocalist on jazz flautist Herbie Mann&#x27;s funky disco single &quot;Hijack&quot; (1975), album &quot;Discotheque&quot; (1975), and album &quot;Surprise&quot; (1976).

In 1977, Houston was signed by Private Stock Records, working with arranger/producer Michael Zager on three albums. The first, a self-titled effort produced two modest R&amp;B hits, including a soulful, gospel-influenced rendition of &quot;Tomorrow&quot;. The second included her big disco hit &quot;Think It Over&quot;, which climbed to number 32 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Selling Soul Singles chart in 1979 and number 5 on the same magazine&#x27;s Disco Action Top 80 chart. That same year, Houston represented the United States at the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan with the song, &quot;You&#x27;re the Fire&quot;, landing second place during its Grand Prix contest and winning the &quot;Most Outstanding Performance Award&quot;. The song later appeared on her 1980 disco-flavored album, &quot;Step Aside for a Lady&quot;, again produced by Zager, but released on Columbia Records after Private Stock had folded (the same album was released on EMI in the United Kingdom). 

During the mid- to late 1970s through the mid-1980s, Houston began regularly performing all over Manhattan&#x27;s jazz clubs, headlining at venues such as Sweetwaters, Fat Tuesday, Reno Sweeney, Seventh Avenue South and Mikell&#x27;s. During this time, Houston brought along her teenage daughter Whitney and would have her sing solos to help her get started in the record business. When Whitney Houston began attracting attention from record label scouts offering contracts, Houston would decline such offers, telling them to wait until Whitney finished high school. It was Houston who eventually convinced her daughter to sign with Arista Records in the spring of 1983, figuring that Davis was the right man to guide her daughter&#x27;s career. Shortly after Whitney signed with Arista, Cissy was featured on TV with her daughter following Whitney&#x27;s national television debut on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, where mother and daughter performed a medley of Aretha Franklin duets with Whitney singing &quot;Aretha&quot; and Houston singing &quot;Cissy&quot;. That same year, Houston took part in the Off-Broadway musical &quot;Taking My Turn&quot;, which received a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Musical, often singing the song &quot;I Am Not Old&quot;.

After her daughter found musical stardom in the mid-1980s, Houston&#x27;s solo output slowed, though she contributed duet vocals to her and Whitney&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I Know Him So Well&quot; on the latter&#x27;s eponymous 1987 album. The song charted in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, becoming Houston&#x27;s biggest international hit, reaching the top twenty in the latter two countries; Houston later sang the song with her daughter on Whitney&#x27;s HBO concert special, &quot;Classic Whitney: Live from Washington, D.C.&quot; a decade later. In 1992, she recorded the duet album, &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot;, with fellow soul singer and longtime friend Chuck Jackson, on Shanachie Records. It would be Houston&#x27;s final secular album as she put her focus primarily on gospel music afterwards. Two years later, Houston joined Whitney onstage for her historic , where she directed a South African choir of young girls while Whitney sang the Earth, Wind &amp; Fire song &quot;Touch the World&quot;. Houston also performed the gospel hymn, &quot;Mary Don&#x27;t You Weep&quot; at the first annual &quot;Soul Train Music Awards&quot; and, with Whitney and son Gary, the gospel song, &quot;Wonderful Counselor&quot; at the 15th annual American Music Awards in 1988. That same year, she joined her daughter onstage at the Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute at London&#x27;s Wembley Stadium, where she performed the gospel-R&amp;B song, &quot;He/I Believe&quot;, a song that Whitney had incorporated during the early years of her solo career and which Houston first recorded for her debut album in 1970.

In 1996, after signing with the independent House of Blues label, Houston released the gospel album, &quot;Face to Face&quot;, which featured a gospel rendition of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s &quot;How Sweet It Is (To Be Loved By You)&quot;. Houston would win her first Grammy Award at the 1997 Grammys showcase under the Best Traditional Gospel Album category. In 1997, she released a second album of gospel work, &quot;He Leadeth Me&quot;, for a one-off A&amp;M Records deal, and won a second Grammy in the Best Traditional Gospel Album category for that album at the 1999 Grammys showcase. In between these recordings, she also contributed vocals on &quot;The Lord is My Shepherd&quot; on daughter Whitney&#x27;s soundtrack to &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot;, which her daughter produced; Houston played a minor role in the film as choir singer Mrs. Havergal, in the film. In 2006, she contributed vocals on the song &quot;Family First&quot; alongside her daughter Whitney, granddaughter Bobbi Kristina Brown and nieces Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick for the soundtrack to &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Little Girls&quot;. In June 2012, Houston sang &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; as a tribute to her daughter Whitney, who had passed away that February. Two years later, Houston was seen backing up longtime friend Aretha Franklin while Franklin performed her hit, &quot;Rolling in the Deep&quot; on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot;.

===Session musician===

Houston&#x27;s versatile cross-genre singing style kept her highly in demand as a session musician with some of the world&#x27;s most successful recording artists. Houston, along with Dionne Warwick and Dee Dee Warwick, sang the background vocals on the original recording of &quot;Time Is On My Side&quot; by Kai Winding, released by Verve Records in October 1963. She was one of the backup singers on the Paul Simon song &quot;Mother and Child Reunion&quot; (1972). In 1971, Houston contributed lead vocals on several songs featured on Burt Bacharach&#x27;s self-titled 1971 gold album including &quot;One Less Bell to Answer&quot;, &quot;All Kinds of People&quot; and &quot;Mexican Divorce&quot;. Houston sang back-up on Bette Midler&#x27;s 1972 debut hit album, &quot;The Divine Miss M&quot;, as well as Aretha Franklin&#x27;s 1972 album, &quot;Young, Gifted and Black&quot;, the latter with the Sweet Inspirations. Two years later, Houston contributed background vocals on Linda Ronstadt&#x27;s &quot;Heart Like a Wheel&quot;. During 1975-76, she worked with jazz flutist Herbie Mann on three Atlantic albums, &quot;Discothèque&quot;, &quot;Waterbed&quot;, and &quot;Surprises&quot;, featuring on three tracks, &quot;Violet Don&#x27;t Be Blue&quot;, JJ Cale&#x27;s &quot;Cajun Moon&quot;, and &quot;Easter Rising&quot;. In 1978, she contributed background vocals on Chaka Khan&#x27;s self-titled solo debut, including Khan&#x27;s breakthrough hit, &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot;. Two years later, with daughter Whitney, Houston also sang on Khan&#x27;s sophomore effort, &quot;Naughty&quot;. Starting in 1981, Houston would sing background on many of Luther Vandross&#x27; recordings that would last throughout Vandross&#x27; lifetime. In 1986, Houston joined Vandross, Chaka Khan and David Bowie on the song &quot;Underground&quot;, which was Bowie&#x27;s theme song from his film, &quot;Labyrinth&quot;. Houston would also occasionally back her daughter Whitney, singing background on the number one hit, &quot;How Will I Know&quot;, as well as the track, &quot;Who Do You Love&quot;, from Whitney&#x27;s acclaimed third album, &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;. Houston was one of several famed notable women that appeared in the music video of her daughter&#x27;s rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m Every Woman&quot;, which later won Whitney an NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Music Video in 1994. Houston would continue her session work through the early half of the 21st century.

===New Hope Baptist Church Youth Inspirational Choir===
In 1953, after leaving her former church at St. Luke&#x27;s A.M.E. Church, she and the rest of her family joined the New Hope Baptist Church, where shortly after being baptized, Houston, 19, began serving as the Minister of Music there, a position she would hold for more than half a century. She was also a driving force behind McDonald&#x27;s Gospelfest, at which she regularly performed.

==Personal life and death==
According to Houston, during her career with the Drinkard Singers, she enjoyed a brief courtship with Soul Stirrers front man Sam Cooke in the early 1950s. 

Houston married twice. In 1955, Houston married construction worker Freddie Garland, with whom she gave birth to her first child, Gary Garland (b. 1957), an NBA basketball player and DePaul University Athletic Hall of Famer. Prior to Gary&#x27;s birth, Houston divorced Freddie. 

In the spring of 1958, Houston met John Russell Houston Jr. and engaged in a romantic affair that led to the births of son Michael (b. 1961), a songwriter and road manager, and daughter Whitney (1963–2012), who went on to be a world-renowned singer, actress, and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer. 

During the early years of the relationship, John was still married to his first wife, Elsie Hamilton, up until April 1964. Following that divorce, Houston and John officially married in May of that year. 

John Houston Jr. was a former Army veteran who served his country during World War II and was working as a taxi and truck driver when he met Cissy. He first entered the entertainment business managing his nieces-in-law&#x27;s vocal group, the Gospelaires, in 1959. 

After his wife formed The Sweet Inspirations, he served as their manager until Cissy left the group in 1969 to start her solo career, which he also managed. He also worked as an administrator at Newark&#x27;s City Hall, under the city&#x27;s first black mayor Kenneth A. Gibson.

After an initially happy marriage, following John&#x27;s near fatal heart attack in September 1976, the Houstons&#x27; marriage turned volatile. Despite attempts at marriage counseling, by January 1981, following a tense argument reportedly witnessed by their then 17-year-old daughter Whitney, John filed for legal separation, though they decided to stay married just as Whitney&#x27;s career was taking shape with John later taking on the role as Whitney&#x27;s manager and head of her Nippy Inc. production company. 

After attempts of reconciliation, John filed for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences in February 1991. Three months later, on the 27th anniversary of their wedding, the divorce was finalized.

Houston would never remarry.

Houston had six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

In the late 1990s, when her daughter Whitney began to struggle with drug addiction, Cissy staged several interventions to get her into rehabilitation programs. On one occasion she obtained a court order and the assistance of two sheriffs to intervene, persuading Whitney to undertake treatment at Hope For Women Residential &amp; Therapeutic Services in Atlanta, Georgia. In her 2013 book, &quot;Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped&quot;, Cissy described a scene she encountered during a visit to Whitney and then-husband Bobby Brown&#x27;s home in 2005 where she saw the walls and door painted with big glaring eyes and strange faces. After having seen what she thought was several disturbing scenes, this led Cissy to return with law enforcement and perform an intervention. Whitney would attend recovery and rehabilitation programs. 

On February 11, 2012, Whitney Houston died at the Beverly Hilton Hotel in Beverly Hills, California. After her daughter&#x27;s death, Cissy expressed her distaste for the media&#x27;s coverage of related events: &quot;The media are awful. People have come from here and there, [and they] don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re talking about,&quot; she said. &quot;People I haven&#x27;t seen in 20 years ... Here they come, [they] think they know everything, but that&#x27;s not true. But God has His way of taking care of all of it, and I&#x27;m glad I know that.&quot;

Cissy Houston died at her home in Newark on October 7, 2024, at the age of 91. She had been in hospice care for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

<text>Micromount is term used by mineral collectors and amateur geologists to describe mineral specimens that are best appreciated using an optical aid, commonly a hand-lens or a binocular microscope. The magnification employed ranges from 10 to 40 times.

A micromount is permanently mounted in some kind of box and labelled with the name of the mineral and the location from which it came. Proper mounting both preserves delicate crystals, and facilitates their handling.

Micromount specimen collecting has a number of advantages over collecting larger specimens.
:Micromount specimens take up less space and cost less than larger specimens.
:Small crystals are usually more perfect than larger ones.
:Micromount material can often be readily collected at locations that rarely if ever yield specimens with large crystals.
:Crystals of many rare species are only found in microscopic sizes.

Micromounting is a craft, as much as it is a collecting activity. Two English language books on
micromounting have been published, by Milton Speckels
in 1965, and by Quintin Wight
in 1993.

<text>The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet () was the standing body of the highest body of state authority in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). The presidium was elected by joint session of both houses of the Supreme Soviet to act on its behalf while the Supreme Soviet was not in session. By the 1936 and 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet served as the collective head of state of the USSR. In all its activities, the Presidium was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

Beside the all-Union body they were also in all union republics (e.g.: Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR, Presidium of the Ukrainian SSR, etc.) and other regions including autonomous republics. Structure and functions of the presidiums in these republics were virtually identical.

During discussions in regard to the adoption of the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, on proposition to elect the chairman of the Presidium in a nationwide election, Stalin argued:
==Election==

The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet was elected by the Supreme Soviet of the USSR at a joint session of both chambers at the first session of each after convocation. The deputies of the Presidium were appointed for the duration of the term of office of the Supreme Soviet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR consisted of a chairman, a first vice-chairman (after 1977), his 15 deputies (one from each republic), a secretary, and 20 additional deputies from its two constituent chambers, for a total of 39. The Presidium was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for all its activities.

From 1938 to 1989, the chairman of the Presidium was reckoned as the USSR/Soviet Union&#x27;s head of state and was sometimes referred to as the &quot;President of the USSR/Soviet Union&quot; in non-Soviet sources.

==The building of the Presidium==
Its building, situated inside the Moscow Kremlin, was appropriately named the Kremlin Presidium.

==Constitutional powers==
===At inception===
According to the 1936 Constitution of the USSR, as in force as enacted originally (and thus, at the establishment of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:

*promulgation of decrees (ukases);
*interpretation of current Soviet laws;
*dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the basis of Article 47 of the 1936 Constitution of the USSR and scheduling new elections: implementing a national referendum on its own initiative or at the request of one of the republics of the Union.
* of decrees, issued by the Council of Ministers and Council of Ministers of the republics of the Union in case there is a discrepancy with the law;
*relieving the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of his job and appointing Ministers of the USSR (between sessions of the Supreme Soviet) with the subsequent submittal for the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s approval;
*establishment of orders and medals of the USSR and implementing the awarding procedures.
*establishment of honorary titles of the USSR and their assignment.
*realization of the right to pardon;
*appointment and dismissal of the executive command of the Soviet Armed Forces;
*establishment of military and diplomatic ranks and other special ranks;
*declaration of the general and partial mobilization;
*declaration of war in case of an attack on the USSR or in case when it was necessary to implement obligations of international mutual defense treaties;
*ratification and denunciation of international treaties, signed by the USSR;
*representation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (between its sessions) in its relations with parliaments of foreign countries;
*appointment and dismissal of Soviet plenipotentiaries in foreign countries;
*receiving of Letters of Credence and Letters of Recall from foreign diplomatic representatives, accredited in the USSR;
*declaration of the martial law in a given region or across the USSR in the interest of defending the USSR or preserving public order and state security.

The presidium also dealt with questions regarding the acquisition of the Soviet citizenship, its forfeiting or voluntary rejection.

When the Supreme Soviet was not in session, the Presidium carried out the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s ordinary functions. It was also empowered to issue decrees in lieu of law, which were to be submitted to the Supreme Soviet at its next session. If such decrees were not ratified by the Supreme Soviet, they were to be considered revoked. In practice, the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s infrequent sessions (it usually sat for only one week per year) and the principles of democratic centralism meant that Presidium decrees &quot;de facto&quot; had the force of law. It was not unheard of for the CPSU Politburo to bypass the full Supreme Soviet and enact major laws as Presidium decrees. While the Supreme Soviet&#x27;s power of veto was almost never exercised in practice, it was not unheard of for the Politburo to enact Presidium decrees into legislation without even the formality of submitting them to the full Supreme Soviet for ratification.

As party members made up the majority of members of the presidum, in such plenary sessions or extraordinary ones wherein the Chairman of the Presidium or any high ranking CC-CPSU introduces a relevant CC decision for the resolution of the Presidium or if any decrees would be passed by it, they voted thus in the manner prescribed by the Constitution and laws to wilt that any absolute majority of deputies voting in favor thus approved the law, the same number voting not in favor (not unlike the ones as mentioned before) produced a veto on the draft legislation.

===At abolition===
According to the 1977 Constitution of the USSR, as in force at the union&#x27;s dissolution (and thus, at the abolition of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:

* organization of the work of the Supreme Soviet;
* preparation of meetings of the Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies and sessions of the Supreme Soviet;
* coordination of the work of the committees of the Supreme Soviet;
* organization of nationwide discussion of legislative bills and &quot;other very important matters&quot; in the national level provided that these would be dealt by a plenary of the whole of the Supreme Soviet.

By then, most of the Presidium&#x27;s former powers were reassigned to the whole Supreme Soviet and to the President of the USSR.

<text>Laurence Paul Godfrey (born 9 June 1976, in Bristol) is a British archer.

He studied for an HND in Mechanical Manufacturing at the University of the West of England from 1997 to 2000.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Godfrey was the only British male to qualify for the men&#x27;s tournament at Athens 2004. He competed for the United Kingdom (as Great Britain) at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual archery. He won his first three elimination matches, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Godfrey faced Chen Szu-yuan of Chinese Taipei, defeating Chen 110–108 in the 12-arrow match and advancing to the semifinals. There, he faced Marco Galiazzo of Italy, losing to the eventual gold medalist 110–108. Godfrey then competed against Tim Cuddihy of Australia in the bronze medal match, losing 113–112 to take 4th place overall.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Godfrey finished his ranking round with a total of 657 points. This gave him the 34th seed for the final competition bracket in which he faced Bair Badënov in the first round. Badënov won the match with 114–109 and went on to win the bronze medal.

Together with Simon Terry and Alan Wills he also took part in the team event. With his 657 score from the ranking round combined with the 670 of Terry and the 661 of Wills the British were in fifth position after the ranking round. In the first elimination round they faced the Chinese team and got eliminated with 214–210. The Chinese went on to win the bronze medal.

==2012 Summer Olympics==
At the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Godfrey finished 4th in the ranking round with a total of 680 points. He defeated Emdadul Haque Milon from Bangladesh in the 1/32 elimination round, winning 6-0 (scoring 84 out of a possible 90 points). He then went on to defeat Mexico&#x27;s Juan Serrano, winning the first set, tying the second set, and then winning the final 2 sets, giving him a victory of 7–1. The 1/8 elimination round against Malaysian Khairul Anuar Mohamad was tied at 5–5 at the end of the 5th and final set. Mohamad won the one arrow shoot off and progressed to the quarterfinals, only to be defeated by Takaharu Furukawa from Japan who went on to win the silver medal.

<text>The Habitation Module for the International Space Station was intended to be the Station&#x27;s main living quarters designed with galley, toilet, shower, sleep stations and medical facilities. About the size of a bus, the module was canceled after its pressurized hull was complete. If named and sent into space, the Habitation Module would have been berthed to &quot;Tranquility&quot;.

==History==
In order to accommodate more than three people on the ISS, a lifeboat craft other than a single Soyuz TMA would be needed and such a Crew Return Vehicle was not there at that time. Later in the project, budget constraints and delays to the space station due to the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster led to its cancellation. On 14 February 2006 it was decided to recycle the Habitation Module for ground-based Life Support Research for future missions.

With the cancellation of the Habitation Module, sleeping places are now spread throughout the station. There are two in the Russian segment and four in the US segment. However, just like a hotel, it is not necessary to have a separate &#x27;bunk&#x27; in space at all; many visitors just strap their sleeping bag to the wall of a module, get into it, and sleep.

At various points in the design of the International Space Station, an inflatable TransHab module with several times the space of the initial design was considered as an alternative to the Habitation module. This concept is similar to the Bigelow Expandable Activity Module, which was brought to the ISS in May 2016 by a Dragon cargo spacecraft to test the concept. Some engineers in Britain have also proposed a Habitation Extension Module which could be attached to Node 3.

<text>Fracastorius is the lava-flooded remnant of an ancient lunar impact crater located at the southern edge of Mare Nectaris. To the northwest of this formation lies the crater Beaumont, while to the northeast is Rosse.

The northern wall of this crater is missing, with only mounds appearing in the lunar mare to mark the outline. The lava that formed Mare Nectaris also invaded this crater, so the structure now forms a bay-like extension. The remainder of the rim is heavily worn and covered in lesser impact craters, leaving little of the original rim intact. The maximum elevation of the rim is 2.4 km. The most prominent of these craters is Fractastorius D, which overlies a portion of the western rim.

Fracastorius has no central peak, but a long, slender rille runs across the middle of the floor in a generally east–west direction.

The crater commemorates the Italian scholar, astronomer and poet Girolamo Fracastoro, &quot;Fracastorius&quot; (1478‑1553).

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Fracastorius.

<text>Timothy John Cuddihy (born 21 May 1987) is an archer from Toowoomba, Australia, who competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual matchplay archery. He won his first three elimination matches, advancing to the quarterfinals.

In the quarterfinals, Cuddihy faced Park Kyung-mo of Korea, defeating Park 112–111 in the 12-arrow match and advancing to the semifinals. There, he faced Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan, losing to the eventual silver medalist in a 10–9 tie-breaker after the first 12 arrows resulted in a 115–115 tie. Cuddihy then competed against Laurence Godfrey of Great Britain in the bronze medal match, winning 113–112 to earn the bronze medal. Cuddihy was also a member of the 6th-place Australian men&#x27;s archery team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

Cuddihy retired temporarily from archery after failing to qualify for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, but returned to the Australian Institute of Sport&#x27;s archery program in January 2010. The AIS Archery program ceased at the end of 2011.

<text>is a Japanese athlete who competes in archery, who is a former world number one.

He won a bronze medal in archery at the 1984 Summer Olympics.

Yamamoto competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual archery. He won his first three elimination matches, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Yamamoto faced Im Dong-hyun of South Korea, defeating the 1st-ranked archer 111–110 in the 12-arrow match and advancing to the semifinals. There, he faced Tim Cuddihy of Australia, defeating the eventual bronze medalist in a 10–9 tie-breaker after the first 12 arrows resulted in a 115–115 tie. Yamamoto then competed against Marco Galiazzo of Italy in the gold medal match, losing 111–109 to finish with the silver medal.

Since 2004 Yamamoto has been a frequent guest on television programs in Japan and has become a well recognized public figure.

Yamamoto was also a member of the 8th-place Japanese men&#x27;s archery team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

<doc id="926722" wikidata="Q7310712" url="?curid=926722" title="Relational data mining">
<text>Relational data mining is the data mining technique for relational
databases. Unlike traditional data mining algorithms, which look for
patterns in a single table (propositional patterns), 
relational data mining algorithms look for patterns among multiple tables
(relational patterns). For most types of propositional
patterns, there are corresponding relational patterns. For example,
there are relational classification rules (relational classification), relational regression tree, and relational association rules.

There are several approaches to relational data mining:
# Inductive Logic Programming (ILP)
# Statistical Relational Learning (SRL)
# Graph Mining
# Propositionalization
# Multi-view learning

==Algorithms==
Multi-Relation Association Rules: Multi-Relation Association Rules (MRAR) is a new class of association rules which in contrast to primitive, simple and even multi-relational association rules (that are usually extracted from multi-relational databases), each rule item consists of one entity but several relations. These relations indicate indirect relationship between the entities. Consider the following MRAR where the first item consists of three relations &quot;live in&quot;, &quot;nearby&quot; and &quot;humid&quot;: “Those who &quot;live in&quot; a place which is &quot;near by&quot; a city with &quot;humid&quot; climate type and also are &quot;younger&quot; than 20 -&gt; their &quot;health condition&quot; is good”. Such association rules are extractable from RDBMS data or semantic web data.

==Software==
* Safarii: a Data Mining environment for analysing large relational databases based on a multi-relational data mining engine.
* Dataconda: a software, free for research and teaching purposes, that helps mining relational databases without the use of SQL.

==Datasets==
* Relational dataset repository: a collection of publicly available relational datasets.

<text>Marco Galiazzo (born 7 May 1983 in Padua) is an athlete from Italy. He competes in archery for C.S. Aeronautica Militare, and is a former world number one. He was the first Olympic champion in the Italian archery history, winner of the gold medal in men&#x27;s individual competition at Olympic Games – Athens 2004 and gold medal in team competition at the Olympic Games – London 2012 (in the same event he won silver at the Olympic Games – Beijing 2008).

==Career==
Galiazzo started to shoot at the age of thirteen, together with his father, who later became his coach. His first win was at Italian Youth Games (Giochi della Gioventù), at the age of fourteen. At sixteen he was chosen for the first time for the Italian national archery team. His first team was the Compagnia Arcieri Padovani with whom he trained when he won the Olympic medal. Currently, he is a member of A.S.D. Archers Rio.

On 19 August 2004, he won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s individual at the Athens Olympic Games, beating the Japanese archer Hiroshi Yamamoto in the final round. In the second round he beat teammate Ilario Di Buò.

On 3 February 2006, he entered the C.S. Aeronautica Militare.

On 18 April 2008 in Porec, Croatia, during the second leg of the Meteksan World Cup, he established the new Italian team record with Mauro Nespoli and Ilario Di Buò. On 11 August of the same year, together with Mauro Nespoli and Ilario Di Buò he won the silver medal in the team competition at Olympic Games – Beijing 2008, losing in the final against South Korea. Two days later he was defeated 109–110 in the second round of the individual competition against Alan Wills (ENG), losing the opportunity to retain the Olympic title won four years earlier.

On 28 July 2012, he won the gold medal at Olympic Games in London in the team competition, together with Michele Frangilli and Mauro Nespoli, beating the United States in the final.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Galiazzo competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s individual archery. He won his first three elimination matches, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Galiazzo faced Vic Wunderle of the United States, defeating Wunderle 109–108 in the 12-arrow match and advancing to the semifinals. There, he faced Laurence Godfrey of Great Britain, defeating Godfrey 110–108. Galiazzo then competed against Hiroshi Yamamoto of Japan in the gold medal match, winning 111–109 to earn the gold medal. He was also a member of the 7th-place Italian men&#x27;s archery team at the 2004 Summer Olympics.

<text>The Boeing X-48 is an American experimental unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) built to investigate the characteristics of blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. Boeing designed the X-48 and two examples were built by Cranfield Aerospace in the UK. Boeing began flight testing the X-48B version for NASA in 2007. The X-48B was later modified into the X-48C version, which was flight tested from August 2012 to April 2013. Boeing and NASA planned to develop a larger BWB demonstrator, although no updates have been provided since 2013.

==Design and development==

===Background===
Boeing had in the past studied a blended wing body design, but found that passengers did not like the theater-like configuration of the mock-up; the design was dropped for passenger airliners, but retained for military aircraft such as aerial refueling tankers.

McDonnell Douglas developed the blended wing concept in the late 1990s, and Boeing presented it during an annual Joint AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEA Propulsion Conference in 2004. The McDonnell Douglas engineers believed their design had several advantages, but their concept, code named &quot;Project Redwood&quot;, found little favor at Boeing after their 1997 merger. The most difficult problem they solved was that of ensuring passengers a safe and fast escape in case of an accident, since emergency door locations were completely different from those in a conventional aircraft.

The blended wing body (BWB) concept offers advantages in structural, aerodynamic and operating efficiencies over today&#x27;s more conventional fuselage-and-wing designs. These features translate into greater range, fuel economy, reliability and life cycle savings, as well as lower manufacturing costs. They also allow for a wide variety of potential military and commercial applications. These advantages are achieved at the expense of a multitude of disadvantages that make the concept impractical for airline use.

===X-48===

Boeing Phantom Works developed the blended wing body (BWB) aircraft concept in cooperation with the NASA Langley Research Center. In an initial effort to study the flight characteristics of the BWB design, a remote-controlled propeller-driven blended wing body model with a 17 ft (5.2 m) wingspan was flown in 1997. The next step was to fly the 35 ft (10.7 m) wide X-48A in 2004, but the program was canceled before manufacturing.

Research at Phantom Works then focused on a new model, designated X-48B, two examples were built by United Kingdom-based Cranfield Aerospace, a division of Cranfield University. Norman Princen, Boeing&#x27;s chief engineer for the project, stated in 2006: &quot;Earlier wind-tunnel testing and the upcoming flight testing are focused on learning more about the BWB&#x27;s low-speed flight-control characteristics, especially during takeoffs and landings. Knowing how accurately our models predict these characteristics is an important step in the further development of this concept.&quot;

The X-48B had a wingspan, weighs , and was built from composite materials. It was powered by three small turbojet engines and was expected to fly at up to and reach an altitude of . The X-48B was an 8.5% scaled version of a conceptual span design. Though passenger versions of the X-48B have been proposed, the design has a higher probability of first being used for a military transport.
Wind tunnel testing on a wide blended wing body model was completed in September 2005. During April and May 2006, NASA performed wind tunnel tests on X-48B Ship 1 at a facility shared by Langley and Old Dominion University. After the wind tunnel testing, the vehicle was shipped to NASA&#x27;s Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base to serve as a backup to X-48B Ship 2 for flight testing. X-48B Ship 2 then conducted ground tests and taxi testing in preparation for flight. In November 2006, ground testing began at Dryden, to validate the aircraft&#x27;s systems integrity, telemetry and communications links, flight-control software and taxi and takeoff characteristics.

The second X-48B was modified into the X-48C starting in 2010 for further flight tests. The X-48C has its vertical stabilizers moved inboard on either side of the engines, and its fuselage extended aft, both to reduce the aircraft&#x27;s noise profile; it was to be powered by two JetCat turbines, each producing of thrust. The X-48C was instead modified to use two Advanced Micro Turbo (AMT) turbojet engines in 2012.

Following flight testing of the X-48C in April 2013, Boeing and NASA announced future plans to develop a larger BWB demonstrator capable of transonic flight.

==Operational history==

The X-48B first flew on July 20, 2007, reaching an altitude of 7,500 ft (2,286 m); the flight lasting 31 minutes. The remotely piloted aircraft was successfully stalled for the first time on September 4, 2008, with fixed leading edge slats, a forward center of gravity, and 23-degree angle of attack (2° beyond the maximum coefficient of lift). Stall testing was repeated on September 11 with a NASA pilot at the console.

On March 19, 2010, NASA and Boeing successfully completed the initial flight testing phase of the X-48B. Fay Collier, manager of the ERA Project in NASA&#x27;s Aeronautics Research Mission Directorate commented on the completion of the first phase of testing saying, &quot;This project is a huge success. Bottom line: the team has proven the ability to fly tailless aircraft to the edge of the low-speed envelope safely.&quot;

Following the installation of a new flight computer in 2010, the X-48B was to continue a new phase of flight tests to investigate controllability aspects. The second phase of flight tests with the X-48B began in September 2010.

The X-48C first flew on August 7, 2012. Engine yaw control was among the aspects to be studied. The X-48C completed its 8-month flight test program with its 30th flight on 9 April 2013.

==Variants==
;X-48A: The initial planned 35 ft (10.7 m) wide version. It was canceled before manufacture.
;X-48B: Two 8.5% scale aircraft that have been used for flight testing.
;X-48C: A modified, two-engine version of the X-48B intended to test a low-noise design.

<doc id="926738" wikidata="Q758090" url="?curid=926738" title="California State Route 120">
<text>State Route 120 (SR 120) is a state highway in the central part of California, connecting the San Joaquin Valley with the Sierra Nevada, Yosemite National Park, and the Mono Lake area. Its western terminus is at Interstate 5 in Lathrop, and its eastern terminus is at U.S. Route 6 in Benton. While the route is signed as a contiguous route through Yosemite, the portion inside the park is federally maintained and is not included in the state route logs. The portion at Tioga Pass at Yosemite&#x27;s eastern boundary is the highest paved through road in the California State Route system. This part is not maintained in the winter and is usually closed during the winter season.

==Route description==

SR 120 begins as a freeway intersecting Interstate 5 to extend Interstate 205 through Manteca. In east Manteca the freeway ends at SR 99 and becomes a highway which continues to head east through Escalon, Oakdale and other various small towns. East of Oakdale there are no highly populated areas for 90 miles (144 km) as it heads into the foothills of the Sierra Nevada and into Yosemite National Park. Entering Yosemite, SR 120 is known as Big Oak Flat Road as it heads towards Crane Flat. After leaving Crane Flat, Big Oak Flat Road turns southeast towards Yosemite Valley, while SR 120 continues east as Tioga Pass Road (or often simply Tioga Road). The highway retains that name as it travels through Tuolumne Meadows, over Tioga Pass at an elevation of 9,945 feet, and through the Lee Vining Canyon on its journey to its intersection with U.S. Route 395, at Lee Vining. After a jog to the south along US 395, it continues east as Mono Mills Road, skirting the south end of Mono Lake and providing access to the Mono Lake South Tufa as well as the historical site of Mono Mills before cresting Sagehen Summit and ending with the intersection of U.S. Route 6 at Benton. Both the portions through Yosemite National Park and the stretch between Mono Lake and Benton are subject to winter closure. Usually the highway is open through Tioga Pass by the Memorial Day weekend at the end of May, and typically closes for the winter sometime in November. 

Tioga Road/Big Oak Flat Road is officially both a National Scenic Byway and a National Forest Scenic Byway. The segment through the Lee Vining Canyon between the eastern edge of Yosemite and US 395 is designated as the Lee Vining Canyon Scenic Byway, a separate National Forest Scenic Byway.

SR 120 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and both the western portion and the eastern portion west of US 395 are part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 120 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The Tioga Pass Road was designated as a California Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2002.

==History==

During the Gold Rush, SR 120 was originally known as Big Oak Flat Road, after the village of Big Oak Flat through which it passes in the Sierra foothills. It was a pack trail from Stockton which became popular with prospectors about 1849. By 1874 it was a wagon road which extended to Yosemite Valley.

In 1921, the California State Assembly authorized San Joaquin County to transfer the county road connecting Manteca with then-Route 5 (now I-5) at Mossdale to the state. It was numbered Route 66, as was a 1933 extension from Manteca east to Route 13 in Oakdale. Also in 1933, Route 40 was extended east from Mono Lake to Route 76 (US 6) at Benton. The route from Manteca to Benton was marked as Sign Route 120 in 1934, and was soon extended west to Mossdale, replacing what had been part of U.S. Route 99W.
===Priest grades===
West of Priest is a section of highway with over one hundred curves and hairpin turns, known as the &quot;New Priest Grade.&quot; With a 4% grade, it opened in 1915 and was built by a group of local volunteers who desired an alternative to the very steep (17%) Old Priest Grade. Today, both grades are paved, but trailers and RVs are prohibited from Old Priest Grade. There is a 7,500-pound weight limit on the old grade.

===New Tioga Road Construction, 1958-1961===
In 1956, National Park Service developed plans to relocate the Big Oak Flat Road from Crane Flat to the park&#x27;s eastern boundary, and reconstruct the unimproved central section of the Tioga Road. NPS management wanted to &quot;open up&quot; the High Sierra section of the park to vastly increased numbers of visitors, and planned a new visitor center and other facilities at Tuolumne Meadows, as well as campgrounds and other facilities along the Tioga Road. This brought fierce opposition from the Sierra Club, led by famed photographer Ansel Adams. Adams and his supporters opposed the blasting of a great granite dome southwest of Tenaya Lake, as well as routing the highway along the western shore of the lake. Internally, however, many Sierra Club members supported the project. At the time, Sierra Club opposition created a serious rift in the long-time close relationship between the environmental organization and the National Park Service. In the end, the government proceeded to build the project as originally planned, with only minor modifications. 

===California&#x27;s first diverging diamond interchange===
On November 25, 2020, the first diverging diamond interchange in the state of California opened to traffic at the interchange with Union Road (exit 4) in Manteca.

<text>Fabrice Bellard (; born 1972) is a French computer programmer known for writing FFmpeg, QEMU, and the Tiny C Compiler. He developed Bellard&#x27;s formula for calculating single digits of pi. In 2012, Bellard co-founded Amarisoft, a telecommunications company, with Franck Spinelli.

== Life and career ==

Bellard was born in 1972 in Grenoble, France and went to school in Lycée Joffre (Montpellier), where, at age 17, he created the executable compressor LZEXE. After studying at École Polytechnique, he went on to specialize at Télécom Paris in 1996.

In 1997, he discovered a new, faster formula to calculate single digits of pi in hexadecimal representation, known as Bellard&#x27;s formula. It is a variant of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula.

Bellard&#x27;s entries won the International Obfuscated C Code Contest three times. In 2000, he won in the category &quot;Most Specific Output&quot; for a program that implemented the modular fast Fourier transform and used it to compute the then biggest known prime number, 26972593−1 (in the sense that it prints the decimal representation of this number, which itself is assumed to be known). In 2001, he won in the category &quot;Best Abuse of the Rules&quot; for a tiny compiler (the source code being only 3 kB in size) of a strict subset of the C language for i386 Linux. The program itself is written in this language subset, i.e. it is self-hosting. In 2018, he won in the category &quot;Most inflationary&quot; for an image decompression program.

In 2002, he developed TinyGL, a subset of OpenGL suitable for embedded environments.

In 2003, he pushed the first commits of QEMU, developing it solo through v0.7.1 in 2005.

In 2004, he wrote the TinyCC Boot Loader, which can compile and boot a Linux kernel from source in less than 15 seconds. In 2005, he designed a system that could act as an Analog or DVB-T Digital TV transmitter by directly generating a VHF signal from a standard PC and VGA card. In 2011, he created a minimal PC emulator written in pure JavaScript. The emulated hardware consists of a 32-bit x86 compatible CPU, a 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller, a 8254 Programmable Interrupt Timer, and a 16450 UART.

On 31 December 2009, he claimed the world record for calculations of pi, having calculated it to nearly 2.7 trillion places in 90 days. Slashdot wrote: &quot;While the improvement may seem small, it is an outstanding achievement because only a single desktop PC, costing less than US$3,000, was used—instead of a multi-million dollar supercomputer as in the previous records.&quot; On 2 August 2010, this record was eclipsed by Shigeru Kondo who computed 5 trillion digits, although this was done using a server-class machine running dual Intel Xeon processors, equipped with 96 GB of RAM.

In 2011, he won an O&#x27;Reilly Open Source Award.

In 2014, he proposed the Better Portable Graphics (BPG) image format as a replacement for JPEG.

In July 2019, he released QuickJS, a small and embeddable JavaScript engine.

In April 2021, his artificial neural network–based data compressor, NNCP, took first place out of hundreds in the Large Text Compression Benchmark. The compressor uses Bellard&#x27;s own artificial neural network library, LibNC (&quot;C Library for Tensor Manipulation&quot;), which is publicly available.

In August 2023, Bellard released ts_zip, a lossy text compressor using large language models. He updated it in March 2024, making the algorithm considerably faster as well as hardware-independent.

In April 2024, Bellard released TSAC, an audio compression utility that can achieve really low bitrates of 5.5kb/s (mono) or 7.5kb/s (stereo) while still preserving reasonable audio quality at 44.1kHz.

<text>A patent examiner (or, historically, a patent clerk) is an employee, usually a civil servant with a scientific or engineering background, working at a patent office.

==Duties==
Patent examiners review patent applications to determine whether the invention(s) claimed in each of them should be granted a patent or whether the application should instead be refused. One of the most important tasks of a patent examiner is to review the disclosure in the application and to compare it to the prior art. This involves reading and understanding a patent application, searching the prior art (including prior patent applications and patents, scientific literature databases, etc.) to determine what contribution the invention makes over the prior art, and issuing office actions to explain to the applicants and their representatives (i.e., patent attorneys or agents) any objections that may exist against the grant of a patent. In other words, an examiner reviews a patent application substantively to determine whether it complies with the legal requirements for granting of a patent. A claimed invention must meet patentability requirements of novelty, inventive step or non-obviousness, industrial application (or utility) and sufficiency of disclosure.

Due to a long-standing and incessantly growing backlog of unexamined patent applications, examiners have a very limited amount of time to determine patentability of disclosed inventions. Ill-defined &quot;tenure rules&quot;, as well as pressure to work overtime to meet the &quot;production quotas&quot;, result in very high (over 50% within 4 years after hiring, mostly involuntary) attrition rates among patent examiners, especially at the USPTO. The attrition (mostly involuntary) of patent examiners is so severe that &quot;in some years the USPTO loses more examiners than it hires&quot;.

Some patent applications are easy for an examiner to assess, but others require considerably more time. This has given rise to controversy: On April 13, 2007, a &quot;Coalition of Patent Examiner Representatives&quot; expressed concern that 

== Offices ==

=== European Patent Office ===
Patent examiners at the European Patent Office (EPO) carry out examination and opposition procedures for patent applications originating anywhere in the world and seeking protection in any of the member states of the European Patent Organisation. The process involves a search for existing documentation in the technical area of the application (prior art) and communication with the applicant in order to bring the application in line with the legal requirements of the European Patent Convention. For every patent application, a division formed by three examiners must decide whether the application is granted or not, and in which scope.

EPO examiners are organized in a branched structured by their technical field of expertise and examine patent applications in three official languages, English, French, and German. They are recruited among nationals of the member states and work in one of the EPO offices in Munich, The Hague and Berlin.

Candidates for examiner positions must meet certain minimum requirements:
* EPO member state nationality;
* degree in engineering or in science;
* good knowledge of two languages out of German, English and French with a willingness to learn the third.

Some examiners have work experience in industry, but such experience is not required. EPO examiners are also reportedly required to speak three languages fluently.

Most EPO examiners are represented by SUEPO, a trade union.

=== United States Patent and Trademark Office ===
Patent examiners at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) examine patent applications for claims of new inventions. Examiners make determinations of patentability based on policies and guidance from this agency, in compliance with federal laws (Title 35 of the United States Code), rules, judicial precedents, and guidance from agency administrators. These determinations are appealable as a matter of right to United States district courts and then to the Federal Circuit. The decisions of the latter can be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, but only at the court&#x27;s discretion via a petition for a writ of certiorari.

Responsibilities for a patent examiner at the USPTO include:
* reviewing patent applications to determine if they comply with basic format, rules and legal requirements;
* determining the scope of the invention claimed by the inventor;
* searching for relevant technologies to compare similar prior inventions with the invention claimed in the patent application; and
* communicating findings as to the patentability of an applicant&#x27;s invention via a written action to inventors/patent practitioners.
Examiners are hired at the GS-5, GS-7, GS-9 or GS-11 grade levels.

Patent examiners in the U.S. have responsibilities that are commensurate with their GS level. Promotions from GS-7 to GS-14 are non-competitive. At GS-13 they are eligible to start the &quot;Partial Signatory Authority&quot; program, a testing phase to see if an examiner can apply patent concepts (e.g. obviousness and novelty) and laws (35 USC). Upon passing the &quot;Partial Signatory Program&quot;, a patent examiner is given signatory authority to sign all of their own non-final rejections and other non-final communications to applicants. After a waiting period a patent examiner may take part in an additional testing phase known as the &quot;Full Signatory Authority&quot; (FSA) program. When a patent examiner has passed the FSA program, they are given &quot;Full Signatory Authority&quot; and can sign all of their own &quot;office actions&quot; (e.g. allowances, rejections) without review and approval by a supervisor. Such examiners are also able to review and sign actions of &quot;junior examiners&quot; (patent examiners without signatory authority). Upon completion of the &quot;Full Signatory Authority program&quot;, an examiner is advanced from GS-13 to GS-14 and is referred to as a &quot;primary examiner&quot;. 

Supervisors at the USPTO are GS-15 employees who are necessarily primary examiners now called Supervisory Patent Examiners (formerly Supervisory Primary Examiners) (SPE, colloquially called &quot;spee&quot;). They apply for positions competitively and receive management training inside the office. They are responsible for an Art Unit of patent examiners, typically 8-15 examiners who examine cases in the same area of technology (e.g. GPS devices and aircraft are handled by different art units). Responsibilities include training new examiners, reviewing and signing office actions of junior examiners and acting as an advocate of the examiners they are responsible for to a variety of parties (e.g. other managers in the office, patent applicants and their attorneys). They are the lowest rung of the USPTO&#x27;s management chain of command, and the only part of management that is paid as part of the general schedule (GS). Higher paid managers are part of the Senior Executive Service and are technically political appointees. For example, a primary examiner (GS-14) and her SPE (GS-15) are part of the general schedule and cannot be fired as part of an administration change, but the SPE&#x27;s boss (a &quot;technology center&quot; director paid at SES-1), can be asked to resign by the president, at his pleasure.

According to the USPTO, an examiner is measured entirely by his own performance, without regard to the performance of others. The two most important performance statistics are referred to as &quot;production&quot; (the number of applications processed in the allotted time) and &quot;docket management&quot; (compliance with goals for responding to applicant communications within the allotted time). Legal, technical and automation training is provided to examiners at the USPTO.

To work as an examiner at the USPTO, a person must be a U.S. citizen and pass a background investigation. Examiners also must have a college degree in engineering or science. The Technology Centers at the USPTO are divided into chemistry, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering, so college degrees in these areas are typically preferred. In recent years, however, new technologies have been important areas of innovation, so the USPTO employs people with training in biotechnology, business methods, geology, mathematics, and many other disciplines.

Experienced examiners have an option of working primarily from home through a hoteling program implemented in 2006 by the USPTO.

A 2023 study looked into how political preferences of USPTO examiners affect their propensity to allow patent claims. They found no statistically significant difference except for the case when the most politically active examiners (i.e. those who donate to political campaigns) examine software patents (i.e. in the Art Units where the examiners have the most discretion). In this case Republican-leaning examiners are more likely to issue patents than Democratically-leaning examiners.

<text>Thiel College (, ) is a private college in Greenville, Pennsylvania, United States. It is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is one of the smallest colleges in the region with about 100 full-time and part-time faculty members.

==History==
Founded in 1866 as an inclusive and coeducational institution known as Thiel Hall, the college started as a result of a meeting between William Passavant and A. Louis Thiel. At the Lutheran Church Pittsburgh Synod convention in Greensburg in 1869, it was decided that Thiel Hall would become a college and serve western Pennsylvania from an initial campus in Philipsburg (now known as Monaca). Four years later, on September 1, 1870, the college received a charter from the government of Pennsylvania and relocated to Greenville, where it was incorporated as Thiel College.

On August 1, 2016, Susan Traverso became the 20th and the first female president of Thiel College.

Today, Thiel is home to about 110 full- and part-time faculty members. According to the US Department of Education, the school has just under 1,000 students in attendance. In 2016 and 2018, &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; rated Thiel among the top ROI colleges in the U.S. In 2018, Colleges of Distinction recognized Thiel overall for the third consecutive year, and its Business and Education programs were singled out for their excellence for the second straight year.

Thiel College awarded Amelia Earhart an honorary degree in 1932. In his book “The Search for Amelia Earhart,” author Fred Goerner said, “The most satisfying recognition, however, came from her father’s alma mater, Thiel College of Greenville, Pennsylvania in the form of an honorary Doctor of Science degree.”

Thiel was also the first institution to grant an honorary degree to Fred Rogers in 1969. Rogers’ address at Thiel was titled &quot;Encouraging Creativity.&quot; In his address, he admonished educators and society in general for forcing conformity on children and encouraged understanding and tolerance as children endeavored to find their gifts. Thiel College also presented an honorary degree to Richard M. Nixon in 1959, when he was U.S. vice-president.

<text>The Vechte (, ) or Vecht (), often called Overijsselse Vecht () in the Netherlands to avoid confusion with its Utrecht counterpart, is a river in Germany and the Netherlands. Its total length is , of which is in Germany.

The Vechte originates in Oberdarfeld in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia near the city of Coesfeld and flows north into the state of Lower Saxony, past the towns of Nordhorn and Emlichheim, across the border and then westwards into the Dutch province of Overijssel (hence its alternate Dutch designation). There, it flows through the north part of the Salland region past Hardenberg and Ommen, taking in the water of the Regge stream along the way.

Close to the city of Zwolle, the river suddenly bends north to end in confluence with the Zwarte Water river near the town of Hasselt.

The Vechte is probably the Vidrus mentioned by Ptolemy in his map of Magna Germania.

<doc id="926761" wikidata="Q1781816" url="?curid=926761" title="List of Billboard number-one singles of 1957">
<text>This is a list of number-one songs in the United States during the year 1957 according to &quot;Billboard magazine&quot;. Prior to the creation of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, &quot;Billboard&quot; published multiple singles charts each week. In 1957, the following five charts were produced:

*&quot;Best Sellers in Stores&quot; – ranked the biggest selling singles in retail stores, as reported by merchants surveyed throughout the country.
*&quot;Most Played by Jockeys&quot; – ranked the most played songs on United States radio stations, as reported by radio disc jockeys and radio stations.
*&quot;Most Played in Jukeboxes&quot; – ranked the most played songs in jukeboxes across the United States (this chart was discontinued in June 1957).
*&quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot; – a composite ten-position song chart which combined data from the three charts above along with three other component charts. It served as &quot;The Billboard&quot;″s lead chart until the introduction of the Hot 100 in 1958 and would remain in print until 1963.
*&quot;Top 100&quot; – an early version of the Hot 100, the first chart to feature a combined tabulation of sales, airplay and jukebox play.

NOTE: &quot;Billboard&quot; changed its issue dates from a Saturday to a Monday schedule on April 29, thus causing a one-week inconsistency. This would later be changed back from a Monday to a Saturday schedule on January 6, 1962. In addition, the &quot;Top 100&quot; reported a tie for the number-one single for the issues dated April 20 and December 9, while the &quot;Honor Roll of Hits&quot; reported a tie for the number-one song for the issue dated November 4. &quot;Billboard&quot; also considered the following B-sides as sharing the number-one spot with its A-side on one of its charts:
* &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; (Elvis Presley; Best Sellers in Stores; February 9);
* &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot; (Elvis Presley; Most Played in Jukeboxes; March 9);
* &quot;Bernardine&quot; (Pat Boone; Best Sellers in Stores; June 3–July 4);
* &quot;Loving You&quot; (Elvis Presley; Best Sellers in Stores; July 8–August 19);
* &quot;Treat Me Nice&quot; (Elvis Presley; Best Sellers in Stores; October 21–November 18, December 16);
* &quot;Summertime&quot; (Sam Cooke; Best Sellers in Stores; December 2–9); and
* &quot;When the Swallows Come Back to Capistrano&quot; (Pat Boone; Best Sellers in Stores; December 23).

<doc id="926763" wikidata="Q466878" url="?curid=926763" title="Kelly Sotherton">
<text>Kelly Jade Sotherton (born 13 November 1976) is a British former heptathlete, long jumper and relay runner. In the heptathlon she was the bronze medallist at the 2004 Summer Olympics and, following the disqualification of two other athletes, also at the 2008 Summer Olympics, as well as being part of the bronze medal-winning team in the Women&#x27;s 4x400m relay at the 2008 Summer Olympics (again, initially finishing 5th but upgraded after various subsequent doping disqualifications). As such she is one of only five women to win multiple medals in Olympic heptathlon. She also won a bronze at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics. Representing England, Sotherton is a one-time Commonwealth Games champion, as the heptathlon gold medallist at the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

Indoors, Sotherton was a World silver medallist, and twice European silver medallist in pentathlon, in which she was ranked seventh all-time in 2022.

Several of Sotherton&#x27;s medals arrived after other athletes had been caught doping - at the time, Sotherton&#x27;s reputation was more of near misses than medal success. As the scale of her accomplishments at global level (5 global medals in four years) became clear in hindsight, Sotherton was increasingly recognised as fully part of a notable line of world class British pentathletes/heptathletes that included Olympic gold medalists Mary Rand, Mary Peters, Commonwealth Games champions Judy Simpson, and Louise Hazel and three modern champions across multiple events, Denise Lewis (Olympic, double-Commonwealth gold), Jessica Ennis-Hill (Olympic, European and triple-World gold) and Katarina Johnson-Thompson (double-World, double-Commonwealth gold), her multiple global medals and Commonwealth title between 2004 and 2008 bridging the gap between the Olympic triumphs of Lewis and Ennis-Hill.

In November 2010, she announced her decision to retire from the heptathlon, due to foot and back injuries. After considering switching to cycling, she then chose instead to focus on the 400 m winning her only National title in 2011. Sotherton&#x27;s funding from UK Athletics was cut in 2011, but while she returned to heptathlon training, she failed to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics ahead of reigning Commonwealth champion Louise Hazel, World (and eventual Olympic) champion Ennis Hill or future World and Commonwealth champion Katarina Johnson-Thompson and Sotherton retired from elite competitive athletics for the final time shortly thereafter.

==Early life and education==
Sotherton was born in Newport, Isle of Wight on 13 November 1976. She began her athletics career in the sports day at Caversham House Primary School in Ryde, Isle of Wight. She was subsequently educated at Bishop Lovett Middle School, Ryde High School and Brunel University.

==Career==
As a teenager, Sotherton played netball for the Isle of Wight, and won two English Schools&#x27; championships in the heptathlon. She moved to the Midlands in 1998, to become a member of Birchfield Harriers athletics club. She made her senior British team debut in 2002.

===2004===
She gained international recognition in 2004 when she unexpectedly won a bronze medal at the Summer Olympics in Athens behind Carolina Klüft (gold) and Austra Skujytė (silver), scoring 6424 points and finishing ahead of defending Olympic champion Lewis, who dropped out due to injury.

She was famously criticised for settling for the bronze medal instead of chasing the silver in the final event, the 800m, by her coach Charles van Commenee.

===2005===
In March 2005 she competed in the European Indoor Championships, where she took silver once again behind Klüft. At Götzis, Austria in May Sotherton was again beaten into second, behind the Swede, but she did record a personal best of 6547 points. At the AAA&#x27;s National Championship in July, Sotherton competed in four individual events and took her first senior national title, winning the long jump with a jump of 6.48 metres.

At the 2005 World Championships Sotherton had held a medal position going into the sixth event, despite some below average performances, but a disastrous javelin saw her drop out of contention. Sotherton did manage to knock nearly 2.5 seconds off her personal best to win the final 800 m, but despite closing the overall gap on those ahead she only finished fifth.

===2006===
In March 2006 Sotherton competed for England in the heptathlon at the Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. She took gold with a score of 6396, ahead of Kylie Wheeler of Australia (silver) and her teammate Jessica Ennis (bronze). In August 2006 she competed for Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the heptathlon at the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg. She came seventh ahead of her teammate Jessica Ennis, after a disappointing javelin event caused her to drop from second.

===2007===

2007 saw Great Britain host the European Indoor Championships, in Birmingham. Klüft led after the hurdles, but Sotherton and compatriot Jessica Ennis trailed closely behind. The high jump saw Ennis take the lead over Klüft and Sotherton, with a jump of 1.91, but Sotherton set a personal best for indoors of 1.88. Seven points separated Klüft and Sotherton. In the shot put, Sotherton took a two-point lead ahead of defending champion Klüft. The long jump saw Klüft take a 24-point lead over the Briton. In the 800 m, a strong event for Sotherton, she needed to take 1.6 seconds from Klüft to see her beaten for the first time since 2002. Sotherton set a personal best 2:12.54, but Klüft also underscored her previous mark to win by 17 points. This was her smallest winning margin ever. Sotherton took silver, and Karin Ruckstuhl the bronze. In one of the best pentathlons of all time, many athletes set national records and Klüft and Sotherton rose to second and fourth on the all-time lists respectively. Sotherton also set a Commonwealth record by 200 points.

In 2007, the World Championships were held in the Japanese city of Osaka. Sotherton started the first day with a personal best of 13.21 seconds in the 100 metres hurdles. She then came within a centimetre of her personal best in the high jump with a 1.86 m performance. A season&#x27;s best of 14.14 m followed in the shot put and Sotherton ended the day with a second personal best in the 200 m, with 23.40. On the second day, Sotherton hit 6.68 m in the long jump, to stay in medal contention, but again the javelin saw a weak performance, with Sotherton throwing just 31.90, finishing last. However, Sotherton put in a strong performance in the 800 m, running 2:11.58 to just beat teammate Jessica Ennis to the bronze medal, with 6,510 points.

===2008–09===
In February 2008, Sotherton competed in a three-event triathlon, at the Indoor Grand Prix, in Birmingham, against a field including Carolina Klüft. Sotherton started with a below-par performance in the long jump, allowing Klüft to take the lead. Sotherton then won the 60 m hurdles in a personal best of 8.17 seconds. Despite running a personal best (and the fastest time by a Briton that season) of 52.47 seconds in the 400m, Sotherton took second behind Klüft, who won by 18 points.

After Klüft pulled out of the World Indoor Championships in Valencia, Sotherton became favourite for the gold medal. She lived up to expectation in the 60 m hurdles, winning in 8.25 seconds. However, Sotherton put in a below-par performance in the high jump, achieving only 1.81 m, against Tia Hellebaut&#x27;s 1.99 m., and Sotherton slipped to third and then to fifth after the shot put. Sotherton then won the long jump with 6.45 m, moving into second, behind Hellebaut, who set a Belgian record of 6.41 m. Hellebaut held a considerable lead entering the final event, the 800 m. Sotherton needed to beat the Belgian by 7.7 seconds to win gold. Sotherton set a personal best of 2:09.95, with Hellebaut collapsing over the line in 2:16.42, 6.47 seconds behind Sotherton, and the Briton had to again settle for silver.

After Klüft&#x27;s retirement from heptathlon in 2008, Sotherton had been tipped by many people to take gold at the 2008 Olympics, including Klüft herself. However, after a disappointing performance she could only manage 5th place in the competition. Lyudmila Blonska was later disqualified for failing a doping test and Sotherton was upgraded to fourth. She had previously labelled Blonska a cheat, and questioned the validity of Blonska&#x27;s silver medal at the World Championships in 2007. In December 2017 Tatyana Chernova was disqualified from 3rd place in the competition for doping, promoting Sotherton to the bronze medal. She was also part of the 4 × 400 m relay team which finished fifth in the final although the team was later upgraded to bronze medal position following disqualification for doping offences of the teams finishing in third and fourth place.

Sotherton received her bronze medal from the 4x400 metre relay at the London Anniversary Games on 21 July 2018 along with her teammates. She then received her second bronze medal from the Heptathlon two months later on 13 September at the Team GB ball in London.

The following year, Sotherton struggled with injuries and although she was selected for the 2009 European Indoor Championships she had to withdraw due to heel problems. Despite recovering from this injury, her 2010 season was also ruined by injury as her back problems recurred.

===2011===
Sotherton completed &quot;the first step of her reinvention as a 400m specialist&quot;, with a victory in the 400m final in 53.46 sec, at the English Institute of Sport - Sheffield indoor arena on 13 February 2011. Overcome at her win, she explained a temporary breakdown at trackside; &quot; When I prolapsed the disc in my back it was career-threatening. I had to make a decision whether to end my career or try something new.&quot; It was Sotherton&#x27;s first national title in a track event.

===2012===

<text>The Cincinnati City Council is the lawmaking body of Cincinnati, Ohio. The nine-member city council is elected at-large in a single election in which each voter chooses nine candidates from the field. The nine top vote-getters win seats on the council for a two-year term.

Until the charter of 1925, the council comprised 32 members—six elected at-large and 26 elected from single-member wards. The 1925 charter instituted the present nine-member council elected in a single non-partisan, at-large election. From 1925 to 1955, elections were under the single transferable vote form of proportional representation. The mayor was chosen by the council from among its members. In the 1970s, the system was changed so that the top vote-getter in the council election automatically became mayor. Since 2001, the mayor is chosen in a separate election.

Although the election officially is non-partisan, the local Charterite party and three of the major political parties (Democratic, Republican, and Green Party) all endorse candidates in the race. Party designations, however, can be fluid. After the 1997 election, for example, Democrats Minette Cooper and Dwight Tillery formed a majority coalition on the council with Republicans Charlie Winburn, Phil Heimlich, and Jeanette Cissell.

Prior to 2013, council members were elected for two-year terms. In 2013, a referendum was passed changing City Council to four-year terms. In 2018, two competing proposals were placed on the ballot to modify the structure of the City Council yet again. Issue 10 would bring back two-year terms; Issue 11 would keep four-year terms but stagger them, such that five council members would be elected in a mayoral election year, and four council members would be elected two years later. Issue 10 passed with a larger margin of victory, and the City Council returned to two-year terms beginning with the 2021 election.

The next city council election is scheduled for November 2025.

<doc id="926767" wikidata="Q1472026" url="?curid=926767" title="Gabriola Island">
<text>Gabriola Island is one of the Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia in British Columbia (BC), Canada. It is about east of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island, to which it is linked by a 20-minute ferry service. It has a land area of about and a resident population of 4,500.

Gabriola has public beaches and forests, shopping centres, restaurants, a library, an elementary school and a museum. It is known as the Isle of the Arts due to its high percentage of working artists, and its many cultural events include annual festivals related to art, poetry, gardens, music, boating and fishing. The Gabriola Arts Council produces three large annual events: the Isle of the Arts Festival (April), Cultivate Arts Festival (Summer) and Thanksgiving Studio Tour (October).

==History==

===Pre-contact===
Gabriola is part of the traditional territory of the Snunéymux (of whose name the nearby city of Nanaimo was given an anglicized form). The earliest archeological record on Gabriola is a cave burial dated to about 1500 BC.

The pre-contact population of Gabriola is difficult to estimate, but in mid-Marpole times—between about AD 1 and 1000—several thousand people lived in the village at Senewélets or more commonly known as, False Narrows, the site of today&#x27;s El Verano Drive. Archaeologists have found that infant mortality at that time was surprisingly low and that the population was well adapted to its environment. Other smaller villages on Gabriola were scattered around the coast. After contact, and perhaps as early as AD 1500, the population of the Snunéymux declined drastically from smallpox and other diseases brought to North America by Europeans. Overall, there are over 200 archaeological sites on Gabriola and the isles near it.

The island is famous for its petroglyphs, which, while commonly believed to be thousands of years old, are almost impossible to date. Because they are carved in relatively soft sandstone, they are eroding rapidly.

===Post-contact===
The first European visit to Gabriola was by the Spanish schooner &quot;Santa Saturnina&quot; under José María Narváez in 1791. Narváez is said to have given the name Punta de Gaviola to the southeastern end of the island. It may also have been Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, rather than Narváez, who bestowed the name. Over time, &quot;Gaviola&quot; may have been corrupted into &quot;Gabriola&quot; and applied to the whole island. Gaviola is sometimes said to be a misspelling of gaviota (&quot;seagull&quot;), but it may refer to the Spanish surname Gaviola.

In 1792, the island was again visited by a Spanish expedition, under Galiano and Valdés. Galiano and Valdés stayed at Pilot Bay for several days, to repair their vessels and explore the vicinity of what is now Nanaimo. They called the anchorage &quot;Cala del Descanso&quot; (&quot;Cove of Rest&quot;). Galiano stayed at the island for four days and while there, encountered several Indians and engaged in limited trading. Galiano also found an abandoned Indian village. This site was later wrongly identified as the present Descanso Bay by British cartographers. The British expedition of George Vancouver may also have visited the island very briefly in 1792. While the Spanish explored and charted the Strait of Georgia, they left no permanent settlements. In 1827, fur traders of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company established a post at Fort Langley on the Fraser River, but no Europeans settled in the Nanaimo area until the discovery of coal there in 1852. From the mid-1850s on, coal miners and ex-gold miners began to move to Gabriola, where they started farms to supply the growing population of Nanaimo.

By 1874, 17 settlers were working the land on Gabriola, and two-thirds of those had First Nations wives and young families. Portuguese settler John Silva, for whom Silva Bay was named, married &quot;Louise,&quot; the daughter of a Cowichan chief, in 1873. Three of their sons volunteered to fight in the First World War; one was killed, another wounded. The name of Frank Silva, missing in action on Vimy Ridge in 1917, is inscribed on the Vimy Memorial in France.

In the early 20th century, the population of Gabriola grew slowly. By the 1950s, fewer than 400 people lived full-time on the island. Electricity came to Gabriola in 1955, but even then the population grew only about one percent a year until the 1970s. In roughly the next 10 years, the population tripled, in part due to hippie immigration from the United States. By the mid-1980s, the population was 2,000, half the current figure.

In summer, the island&#x27;s population greatly increases. Even in the first half of the 20th century, families came from Nanaimo or Vancouver to estivate, spending weeks or months living a simpler, rural life on the island. In the 21st century, about come to Gabriola each year for the sun, music, art, and relaxed pace, and they raise the population temporarily to about 6,000.

Apart from farming, Gabriola experienced industrial development in the 20th century. A brickyard produced a day in the early part of the century, and they were sent principally to Victoria and Vancouver. The brickyard ceased functioning in the 1950s. In the 1890s and early twentieth century, sandstone blocks were cut from a quarry near Descanso Bay and shipped for architectural use in public buildings in Vancouver and Victoria. In the early- to mid-1930s, millstones were cut from the sandstone and sent to towns along the west coast and as far away as Finland for use in the pulp and paper industry. A small diatomaceous earth industry also flourished in the 1930s. After World War II, the shipyard at Silva Bay became the major employer on the island until the 1970s.

==Geography==
Gabriola, part of the Regional District of Nanaimo, is the most northerly of the Southern Gulf Islands in the Strait of Georgia between mainland BC to the east and Vancouver Island to the west. The Gulf Islands are an archipelago consisting of hundreds of islands of various sizes stretching from the San Juan Islands in the United States to the Northern Gulf Islands, north of Gabriola. The biggest of the Southern Gulf Islands are Gabriola Island, Galiano Island, Kuper Island, North and South Pender Island, Saltspring Island, Saturna Island, Thetis Island, and Valdes Island.

The Southern Gulf Islands consist mainly of former seabed sediments crumpled and gradually thrust upward by tectonic plate movement approximately ago. Subsequent periods of glaciation scraped away topsoil and some of the bedrock. During the peak of the Fraser Glaciation, ago, Gabriola was covered with ice up to thick. Though melting glaciers left deposits of sand, gravel, and boulders, the main rocks exposed on Gabriola&#x27;s surface are sandstone and shale. Differential erosion of relatively soft shales and relatively hard sandstones helped create cliffs, points, and bays along Gabriola&#x27;s shoreline.

Gabriola is about long by wide on average with a land area of . The topography varies from flat sandy beaches at sea level to forested hills rising to on Stoney Ridge in the centre of the island.

Gabriola lies about east of Nanaimo, the second largest city on Vancouver Island, to which it is linked by BC Ferries. The ferry, which takes 20 minutes for the crossing, runs almost hourly from 6:15 a.m, starting at the Gabriola side, to about 11:00 p.m. ,from Nanaimo, daily. Residents of Gabriola who work or attend high school in Nanaimo use the ferry to commute. Gabriola may also be reached by float plane or small boat.

 Islands and islets near Gabriola include Snake Island and Entrance Island to the north, the Flat Top Islands, Breakwater Island, and Valdes Island to the east, and Mudge Island, Link Island, and DeCourcy Island to the south. The North Road-South Road loop of is the main island highway. It passes near most parts of the island, including the ferry terminal at Descanso Bay.

The island has three provincial parks—Gabriola Sands Provincial Park on the northwest shore, Sandwell Provincial Park on the northeast shore, and Drumbeg Provincial Park on the east shore—as well as Descanso Bay Regional Park and an adjacent community park near the ferry terminal. Large coastal sandstone formations known as the Malaspina Galleries are preserved in this community park. The formations were named after the 18th-century Spanish explorer Alejandro Malaspina.

==Demographics==

The population of Gabriola rose by 15 percent, from 3,522 to 4,050, between 2001 and 2006. This growth rate was higher than that for BC as a whole, which grew at a rate of 5.3 percent. The population density was in 2006 compared to 4.4/km2 (11.4 mi2) for all of BC.

The total number of private dwellings on Gabriola was 2,744 in 2006, of which 1,998 were occupied by the usual residents. The median age of the population was 52.9 years compared to the BC median of 40.8. Of the total population, 1,960 were male and 2,090 were female.

==Climate==

Under the Köppen climate classification, the island has a cool summer Mediterranean climate due to its dry summers. Other climate classification systems, such as Trewartha, place it firmly in the Oceanic zone (&quot;Do&quot;). Cool and moist, the island averages 138 rainy days per year and seven days with snowfall greater than . Days with high temperatures of or higher are rare, averaging less than one per year. Days with temperatures below occur about 25 times per year. Winters are cool and wet with the average temperature in January being and an average precipitation of . Due to its mild winters, the average annual snowfall is low at during the season. Summers, on the other hand are dry and mild with a July average of with only of precipitation.

==Community==

Island festivals include the annual Isle of the Arts Festival in April, Cultivate Festival in July, and the Thanksgiving Studio Tour, all three events produced by the Gabriola Arts Council. The Concert on the Green and the Annual Salmon Barbecue occur in August. From May to October, the great Saturday Market at the Agricultural Hall features local produce and baked goods from the island, as well as crafts and high-quality artwork. [[Habonim Dror] Camp Miriam, a [[Jewish summer camp]], operates on the island from the end of June through the end of August.

 Folklife Village, on North Road a few minutes beyond the ferry terminal, is the island&#x27;s main shopping centre. It was bought and transferred to Gabriola after its role as the Folklife Pavilion, a tribute to Canada&#x27;s native and settler cultures, in [[Expo 86]] in Vancouver. Other shopping areas can be found at Twin Beaches Mall on the north end of the island and Silva Bay on the south end. The island has a strong connection to the city of Nanaimo. Some islanders refer to Gabriola as &quot;Gabe,&quot; Nanaimo as &quot;Town,&quot; Vancouver Island as &quot;The Big Island,&quot; and Vancouver as &quot;The Mainland.&quot;

<text>Annette Island or Tàakw.àani (Tlingit) is an island in the Gravina Islands of the Alexander Archipelago of the Pacific Ocean on the southeastern coast of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is at . It is about long and about wide. The land area is . Annette Island is located west across the Revillagigedo Channel from the Alaska mainland and south of Revillagigedo Island. The Island was named in 1879 by William Healey Dall, an American naturalist and explorer in Alaska, in honor of his wife Annette Whitney Dall.

The meaning of the Tlingit name for the island is Winter Town. Since the late 19th century, it has been the base of the Annette Island Reserve of the Metlakatla Alaska Native Community, composed mostly of Tsimshian people. This is the only Indian reservation in Alaska as Metlakatla voted to opt out of giving up their lands under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of the 1970s. In 2016 they elected Audrey Hudson as their first Tribal Chairwoman.

==Community and demographics==
The largest settlement on the island is Metlakatla. The federally recognized Metlakatla Indian Community was founded by an unordained Anglican missionary William Duncan and Tsimshian followers who moved with him from their community of Metlakatla in British Columbia after he developed new doctrine and schismatized from his church.
Since the late 19th century, the entire island has been an Indian reserve, a status enacted by Congress when the Tlingit agreed to let the Tsimshian use this territory.

==Government==
The Tsimshian set up their government under the Indian Reorganization Act (1934), writing a constitution for electoral government. They have a twelve-person Council. &quot;The mayor, secretary, and treasurer are elected by the general voting membership of the community. Each of these is elected for a two-year term. Council seats are staggered, resulting in the election of six Council seats each year and three executives every second year.&quot;

Since the late 1970s, this has been the only remaining reservation in Alaska, as the Metlakatla opted out of giving up their lands for payment under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act.

In 2016 its Tribal Chairwoman is Audrey Hudson, the first woman to be elected to this role. She also serves as mayor, city manager, and police commissioner of the Metlakatla Indian Community.

The island&#x27;s population was 1,447 at the 2000 census. The island population is composed mainly of Tsimshian people. It is a cultural crossroads for Tlingit and Haida Natives as well.

==Infrastructure==

A network of unimproved roads and trails on the island were developed during years of logging. More than 50 years after the United States made a treaty with the Metlakatla Community that promised a cross-island road in exchange for their allowing construction and operation of an airfield on the island, it made good on its word. A joint armed forces task force constructed a 15-mile road across the island, completed from 1997 to 2007, which connected Metlakatla on the ocean side to the side facing Ketchikan, where a ferry landing has been built. This has not improved access by ferry to the mainland.

After the Second World War, the airfield was used as a United States Coast Guard Search and Rescue base. It served commercial aircraft as well until the 1970s, when the new Ketchikan Airport was built at Gravina Island in the Inside Passage.

==Climate==

The lower elevations of Annette Island have a Marine west coast climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;), with windy and wet weather year-round, cool winters, and mild summers, and straddle the border between USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 7 and 8. Due to its southerly and maritime location, with an annual mean temperature of , the Annette Island Airport is one of the warmest locations statewide. Precipitation falls on most days during the winter, and the seasonal total snowfall of occurs mostly from November to March, with some accumulation during April. Snowfall in May and October is relatively rare; warm spells raise the high to for several days each month. During summer, there is an average of 17 days with + highs, and rain still falls on around half of the days. Precipitation averages more than annually, with June and July being the driest months and October and November the wettest. Extreme temperatures have ranged from on January 30, 1947, up to on June 19, 2004, with the temperature having fallen below only on a handful of occasions. In addition, the Annette Island Airport holds the Alaska state monthly record high temperatures for January ( on January 14, 2017), April ( on April 29, 1976), and November ( on November 1, 1970).

==Demographics==

Annette first appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. In 1980, it was made a census-designated place (CDP). It last returned in 1990 and was dissolved as a CDP effective as of the 2000 census.

<text>Richard Patrick DeWine (born February 22, 1968) is an American jurist who has served as a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court since 2017. He served as a justice of the 1st district of the Ohio District Courts of Appeals from 2013 to 2017 and as a politician in Hamilton County, Ohio. He is the son of Ohio Governor Mike DeWine.

==Early life and education==
DeWine is the oldest of eight children born to Mike DeWine and Frances Struewing. DeWine grew up in the Mount Lookout neighborhood of Cincinnati. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from Miami University, he graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from the University of Michigan Law School in 1994 and was inducted into the Order of the Coif.

==Career==
DeWine served as a member of the Cincinnati City Council and the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners . He was first elected to city council in 1999, finishing sixth with 27,745 votes in a field of 20 (with the top nine elected). He was re-elected in 2001 (finishing second with 43,191 votes in a field of 26) and in 2003 (finishing sixth with 26,573 votes in a field of 26). He resigned from city council in order to take his seat on the Hamilton County Commission. Chris Monzel, a Republican who had lost his council seat in the last election, was appointed to fill out DeWine&#x27;s term on city council.

DeWine was a candidate in the June 14, 2005 Republican primary for the Ohio&#x27;s 2nd congressional district special election after Rob Portman resigned to become U.S. Trade Representative. He placed fourth behind Jean Schmidt, Bob McEwen, and Tom Brinkman. His campaign for Congress suffered after allegations of infidelity surfaced against DeWine.

===State judicial career===
DeWine sought and won election to the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas in 2008, defeating Norma Holt Davis in the general election. He subsequently won a seat on the 1st District Ohio District Courts of Appeals in 2012, defeating Bruce Whitman in the November 6, 2012 election.

DeWine took his seat on the Appellate bench in January 2013 after defeating Bruce Whitman in the November 2012 general election. He won an uncontested Republican primary election in March 2016 for a seat on the Ohio Supreme Court commencing January 2, 2017. In November 2016 he won election to that seat over his Democratic opponent. He was reelected to the Ohio Supreme Court in November 2022 for a second six-year term. Prior to his election as a justice, he served as a judge on the Ohio 1st District Court of Appeals and the Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas and was an associate for 13 years with the firm of Keating Muething &amp; Klekamp.

In August 2021, DeWine withdrew from the contest to be nominated as Ohio Supreme Court chief justice in succession to Chief Justice Maureen O&#x27;Connor.

==== Involvement in legislative redistricting cases ====
DeWine refused to recuse from a case in which his father, Governor Mike DeWine, was a party and helped author the minority opinion that would have upheld an unconstitutional gerrymander approved by the Ohio Redistricting Commission, on which Governor DeWine sits.

==Personal life==
DeWine&#x27;s first marriage ended in divorce in 2003. He and his ex-wife have three sons. He was married to his second wife, Rhonda DeWine, from 2010 until 2019 when she filed for divorce.

<text>Hednesford ( () is a market town and civil parish in the Cannock Chase district of Staffordshire, England. The Cannock Chase area of natural beauty is to the north of the town. Hednesford is also to the north of Cannock and to the south of Rugeley. The population at the 2011 census was 17,343.

==Toponymy==
Hednesford was first recorded as &quot;Hedenedford&quot; in AD 1153. The town has seen progressive name evolution over the last millennium, with the name being variously documented as &quot;Ed(e)nesford&quot;, &quot;Adnesford&quot;, &quot;Hedg(e)ford&quot;, and Hednesford.

The etymology of the placename is likely &quot;The ford of &quot;Heddīn&quot;&quot;, &quot;Heddīn&quot; being an Old English diminutive form of the given name &quot;Headda&quot;.

==History==

The first recorded mention of Hednesford dates back to 1153, when King Stephen granted an exemption of pannage dues to the small hamlet of &quot;Hedenedford&quot;.

The town can be found on William Yates&#x27; 1775 map of Staffordshire (pictured), showing it as a small village with 13 buildings.

Hednesford developed as a coal mining town in the second half of the 19th century, with the opening of the Uxbridge Pit.

The Valley Pit (first called the Pool Pit) in Hednesford town centre opened in the 1870s. To prevent this pit from flooding, the Cannock &amp; Rugeley Colliery Company diverted the brook that fed Hednesford Pool (pictured on the 1775 map). This led to the pool drying up by 1900. In 1931, the site was reopened as Hednesford Park.

Between 1914 and 1918 two army training camps were built in the area, and over half a million British and Commonwealth troops passed through destined for the Western Front of World War I.

In 1939, the Royal Air Force opened the No. 6 School of Technical Training, later known as RAF Hednesford. It was used to train technicians in the maintenance and repair of airframes and engines for World War II. The camp ceased operations in 1956, and was repurposed for the resettlement of refugees fleeing from the Hungarian Revolution of the same year. The site is now a part of the Cannock Chase Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

Economically, Hednesford has experienced widespread changes since the 1980s due to the decline of mining and manufacturing jobs in the region. However, Cannock Chase district has seen prolonged job growth in recent years.

A £50 million regeneration was completed in 2012, with two new developments: Victoria Shopping Park, with a Tesco store being the anchor tenant, and Chase Gateway, containing an Aldi and a new bingo hall, along with several other shops. A new drill hall for the local Army Cadet Force detachment was also constructed.

The town was awarded a £2.2 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund in 2012 to refurbish Hednesford Park, including the construction of a new skatepark and play area. Work was completed in 2019.

==Governance==
Hednesford falls under Cannock Chase district in the county of Staffordshire. The town is divided into three wards: Hednesford Green Heath, Hednesford North, and Hednesford South. The town is also parished and run by Hednesford Town Council. At the parish level, it is split into a different set of three wards: Pye Green, Anglesey, and West Hill.

At the national level, the town is represented under Cannock Chase constituency. Since 2015, this has been by Conservative Party MP Amanda Milling.

==Geography==
Hednesford is situated north-northwest of Birmingham. The town centre is above sea level, but parts of Pye Green reach up to above sea level. No major rivers run through Hednesford, and the nearest large body of water is Chasewater, to the southeast. The town is surrounded to the north and west by Cannock Chase, a large, mixed area of countryside and Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The town is situated on the Cannock Chase Coalfield.

Just north of the town centre lies Hednesford Park, a mixed-use recreational area with a play area, skatepark, cafe, and tennis courts, and to the east of the town centre, the Hednesford Hills Nature Reserve. Hednesford has several other nature reserves, including the Anglesey Nature Reserve to the southwest of the town centre, and the Old Brickworks Nature Reserve to the southeast.

The town&#x27;s main road connection is the A460 road, running from Wolverhampton in the south to Rugeley in the north. The town is also bisected by the Chase Line, a heavy rail line running from Birmingham New Street to Rugeley Trent Valley.

The urban area of Hednesford now spreads across a swathe of the northern fringe of Cannock, from Pye Green across to Heath Hayes, and is the southern gateway to the Cannock Chase AONB.

Historically, coal mining was a very important industry in Hednesford, employing thousands of people in the area with upwards of 48 coal mines on Cannock Chase Coalfield. Coal production decreased locally as well as nationally throughout the 1970s and 1980s, and the last coal mine on the coalfield, Littleton Colliery, closed in 1993.

==Landmarks==
Hednesford has a war memorial unveiled by Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone in 1922, built for victims of World War I. It now also commemorates soldiers who were lost in World War II, the Korean War, and the British campaign in Northern Ireland. The town is also situated south-southeast of the Cannock Chase German Military Cemetery, housing almost 5000 identified German casualties of World War I and II.

The town centre of Hednesford is home to a miners&#x27; memorial. 3,500 miners are commemorated on individual bricks on a wall topped with a model of a Davy lamp, as well as placed into the ground surrounding Hednesford&#x27;s clock tower.

Several listed buildings are located in Hednesford. For example, the Cross Keys Inn opened in Hednesford as a coaching station in 1764, and the building was Grade II listed in 1973. The building is now a public house. The town also has a Grade II listed Roman Catholic church, Our Lady of Lourdes, finished in 1934.

The town also houses the Museum of Cannock Chase, built on the site of the former Valley Colliery. The museum is dedicated to the history of coal mining in the region but also hosts community events. It is operated by the Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust.

Hednesford lies west of the ruins of Beaudesert Hall, formerly one of the family seats of the Marquesses of Anglesey. Demolition began in 1935 but was never completed, and today the site is used for recreation by scouting groups. Another part of the estate has since been turned into the Beau Desert Golf Club.

==Transport==
Hednesford railway station was re-opened in April 1989 by British Rail. It is on the Chase Line, with routes run by West Midlands Railway between Rugeley Trent Valley and Birmingham International railway stations.

Hednesford is served by a number of bus routes operated by Chaserider (25, 26, 62, 63) and Select Bus Services (23), which run through the town centre interchange on Victoria Street. These provide connectivity to Cannock, Heath Hayes, Wimblebury, Chadsmoor, Rugeley, Lichfield, Uttoxeter and Rodbaston.

Hednesford&#x27;s original bus station located off Victoria Street closed in 2012. The site was then used for the construction of Victoria Shopping Park.

Both schools have academy status. Hednesford Valley High School is a school for children with special educational needs, which services the local and wider areas.

Hednesford also contains 5 primary schools, with several others located in neighbouring towns.

==Sport==
The town is located near Hednesford Hills Raceway, a stock car track built on the site of a disused reservoir in the 1950s.

The town&#x27;s semi-professional football team, Hednesford Town F.C., nicknamed &quot;the Pitmen&quot;, currently play in the Northern Premier League - West Central and won the FA Trophy in 2004. The team was unable to participate in the 2023/24 season due to a planned transfer of ownership falling through.

The town&#x27;s most prominent sportsperson is former footballer Brian Horton, who played for the Pitmen in the late sixties and early seventies. After a long professional career, he went on to manage Manchester City, Macclesfield Town and Port Vale amongst others.

<doc id="926791" wikidata="Q7743453" url="?curid=926791" title="The Joker's Wild">
<text>The Joker&#x27;s Wild is an American television game show that aired at different times between 1972 and 2017. Contestants answer trivia questions based on categories determined randomly by a mechanism resembling a slot machine. The show&#x27;s title refers to the game&#x27;s slot-machine mechanism also having jokers, which may be used to represent any category.

The show was billed as &quot;the game where knowledge is king and lady luck is queen&quot;, and was notable for being the first successful game show produced by Jack Barry after his company&#x27;s role in the quiz show scandals during the late 1950s. The success of the series led in part to the reformation of Barry &amp; Enright Productions in the 1970s, which reunited Barry with his partner Dan Enright. It aired on CBS from 1972 to 1975, and from 1977 to 1986 in broadcast syndication. A children&#x27;s version, titled &quot;Joker! Joker!! Joker!!!&quot;, aired from 1979 to 1981, also in syndication. Barry also served as host of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; until just before his death in 1984, and was replaced by Bill Cullen afterward. Jim Peck also filled in for both Barry and Cullen at various points.

Barry&#x27;s sons, Jonathan and Douglas Barry, were co-executive producers for a revival of the series that aired in 1990 and 1991, which was produced in association with Richard S. Kline and billed as &quot;a Kline and Friends production in association with Jack Barry Productions&quot;. Pat Finn hosted this version of the show. The series returned in 2017 on TBS, with Snoop Dogg as host, appropriately titled &quot;Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;. He was also co-executive producer with Michael Strahan. In December 2018, it was announced that the show would be moving to TNT in 2019.

==Personnel==

Jack Barry, who created the show and eventually used it to revive his partnership with longtime producer Dan Enright, hosted all versions of the show up until his death in May 1984.

Barry was not the original choice to host, due to his past involvement in the 1950s quiz show scandals. As a result, Allen Ludden hosted the first two pilots for CBS. Barry hosted the local KTLA series in 1971, but CBS was still hesitant to let him host the network run in 1972. Tom Kennedy, Wink Martindale, and Ludden were the three top choices to host, but each was already committed to other shows (Kennedy was tied to &quot;Split Second&quot; for ABC, Ludden had just started hosting a revival of &quot;Password&quot;, and Martindale was to host &quot;Gambit&quot;, which premiered the same day as &quot;Joker&quot; on CBS). They even offered it to Dennis James, who had originally been the favorite to land the host job for the upcoming Mark Goodson–Bill Todman Productions&#x27; game show &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;. When CBS agreed to a weekday daytime version of &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot;, Vice President of Daytime Programming B. Donald &quot;Bud&quot; Grant wanted 15-year &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; host Bob Barker to host &quot;New Price&quot; instead of James. Barker originally said he would gladly host &quot;Joker&quot;, but Grant convinced him to take the hosting role on &quot;Price&quot; instead. With no alternatives after Grant pushed Barker to &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; (a position he would hold for 35 years) and James was hired by Goodson to host a nighttime syndicated version of the same program, Barry was given the green light to host. Barry&#x27;s contract, however, was only for sixty-five episodes (thirteen weeks, a standard run for a daytime game show).

By January 1973, with no complaints from the viewers or the network and good ratings, Barry signed a regular contract to host the program and continued in that role up to its cancellation in June 1975. Enright was brought on as executive producer of &quot;Joker&quot; during its final CBS season, and was mentioned by Barry himself on the program&#x27;s final CBS episode.

In 1981, Barry hired Jim Peck to serve as a regular substitute host for when he was unavailable. Peck subbed for Barry several times between 1981 and 1984, and the original plan set forth by Barry and producer Ron Greenberg was to have Barry end the 1983–84 season as host, announce his retirement on the first episode of the next season, and hand the show over to Peck on a permanent basis. When Barry died of cardiac arrest in May 1984, Enright posthumously overruled his partner and selected Bill Cullen, who had just completed five months of hosting the cancelled NBC game show &quot;Hot Potato&quot; for the company, to take over the series. Cullen hosted for the final two seasons and Peck subbed for him for one week in 1986. Pat Finn hosted the 1990–91 version, and Calvin &quot;Snoop Dogg&quot; Broadus helmed the 2017-2019 version.

===Announcers===
Johnny Jacobs, a longtime friend of host Jack Barry, was the original announcer of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;. Jacobs served through most of its CBS run, with Johnny Gilbert and Roy Rowan filling in for Jacobs on occasion. When the series returned to first-run syndication in 1977, Jacobs, Gilbert, and Jay Stewart alternated the primary announcer position. Stewart became the exclusive announcer for &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; (as well as for all Barry &amp; Enright-produced game shows at the time) during the 1978–79 season; Bob Hilton and Art James were substitutes for Stewart for the 1980–81 season whenever he was unavailable. In 1981 Stewart was replaced as Barry &amp; Enright lead announcer by Charlie O&#x27;Donnell, who announced for the remainder of the series&#x27; run. Johnny Gilbert filled in for O&#x27;Donnell on occasion.

Ed MacKay, a local Los Angeles radio DJ and one-time overnight news anchor at KNX radio, announced the 1990–91 revival.

===Other personnel===
Richard S. Kline served as the director on all incarnations of the show.

===Music===
The first two seasons of the CBS version, as well as the opening of the first season of the syndicated version, used &quot;The Savers&quot; by Perrey and Kingsley from their 1967 album &quot;Kaleidoscopic Vibrations: Electronic Pop Music from Way Out&quot; as the program&#x27;s theme music. The final CBS season instead utilized an original composition, &quot;Joker&#x27;s Jive,&quot; composed by Alan Thicke; this was also used as the closing theme during the 1977–78 syndicated season. The second syndicated season introduced a brand-new music package by Hal Hidey, including a re-recording of &quot;The Savers&quot; that was utilized as the opening theme.

==Gameplay==
===Main game===
Two contestants, one a returning champion, played. The challenger began the game by pulling a lever to set a slot machine in motion. The game&#x27;s slot machine consisted of three slide projectors that had been modified to use discs loaded with slides for the categories and jokers, similar to the wheels used in ViewMaster toys. The discs were spun by electric motors, and unused categories were removed from the board by shutting off the projectors for those windows.

The wheels on the machine each contained five different categories, which were revealed to the contestants before the game, as well as jokers that could represent any category. After the wheels stopped, the contestant chose one of the displayed categories and was asked a question in it. If the contestant answered correctly, the dollar value of the question was added to their score. An incorrect response or a failure to answer within an unspecified time limit allowed the opponent a chance to answer and steal the money. Certain special categories gave the contestant in control a chance to win extra money, by either increasing the question value or allowing multiple questions on that turn, or involved the participation of both contestants.

====Question values====
The values of the questions were determined by the spin. Categories were worth $50, $100, or $200 if they appeared in one, two, or all three windows, respectively. A pair without a joker, if chosen, was played for $100. A &quot;natural triple&quot; (three of a kind with no jokers) required the contestant to answer a question in that category for $200.

In addition, beginning in 1974, spinning a natural triple awarded a bonus, which the contestant kept whether or not they answered the question correctly or won the game. The bonus initially consisted of a single prize worth approximately $300-$500, but by late 1983, it had been changed to a jackpot of prizes that increased in value after every show in which it was not won. Under these rules, the largest single jackpot award totaled $26,550, won in the 1983-84 season after going unclaimed for 46 consecutive days.

====Special categories====
* Mystery: This category was always played for double normal value ($100 as a single, $200 as a pair or $400 as a triple). The contestant selected one of seven numbered question cards in a rack mounted on the host&#x27;s podium; each card was in a different category, none of which were the same as any of the other four in play.
* Pot Luck / Grab Bag: Questions could be about any topic, not necessarily one of the other four in play.
* Alphabet Soup: All answers began with the same letter of the alphabet, stated by the host at the start of the game.
* Stumpers: This category consisted of questions that were missed by both contestants in previous episodes. After the host read the question, the contestant could choose to hear the two previous wrong answers and play for the normal value, or decline the help and play for double value. When first introduced, this category consisted merely of straightforward questions and was played for an extra $100.
* Fast Forward: The contestant could answer multiple questions if desired, each worth the amount spun, and stop after any correct answer. Missing a question forfeited all money earned on that turn and gave the opponent a chance to claim the money for only that question.
* Bid: The contestant had to decide at the outset how many questions they wanted, with a minimum of two. Completing the bid awarded the full value of all questions answered (for example, three questions at $100 each awarded $300), but a miss gave the opponent a chance to take control with a correct answer and complete the bid themself. If the champion selected this category but did not bid enough questions to tie or surpass a challenger who had already reached $500, the champion immediately forfeited the game.
* Fact or Foto: The contestant could either hear one or more facts about a subject or see a photograph of it, then try to identify it. If they were wrong, the opponent got both the fact(s) and the photo.
* Just One More: Given a question with multiple answers, the contestants bid back and forth as to how many they could name. The high bidder won control; if they gave an incorrect answer, the opponent could steal the money with one correct response.
* How Low Will You Go?: A question and one clue were read to the contestants. Seven more clues were available, and the contestants bid back and forth as to how few clues they would need. The low bidder won control, but if they answered incorrectly, the opponent got to hear all the clues before responding.
* Take a Chance: After hearing the question, the contestant could either answer it or pass it to the opponent. An incorrect answer awarded the money to the contestant who did not receive the question.
* Choose the Clues: The opponent decided whether the contestant would receive one clue and play for double value, or two clues for the normal value. If the contestant was given only one clue and missed, the opponent got both clues and played for the normal amount.

====Jokers====

When one or two jokers came up during a spin, a contestant could use them to match any displayed category and create a pair or triple, increasing the value of the question. They could also substitute a joker for a category in play but not displayed on the wheels (referred to as going &quot;off the board&quot;) for $50 with one joker showing, or for either $50 or $100 with two. In addition, if a natural pair and a joker came up, the contestant could discard the pair but use the joker to go off the board in that same category for $50.

Spinning three jokers allowed the contestant to choose any of the categories in play during the game. A correct answer automatically won the game, regardless of the contestant&#x27;s score or whether a full round had been played or not. The winner received either $500 or the total amount they had accumulated to that point, whichever was greater. If unsuccessful, however, the opponent could not steal and the game continued as normal.

Using jokers was optional, and contestants occasionally declined to use them if enough money was at stake for their opponent to win the game or take the lead (e.g., spinning a natural pair and a joker, then playing the pair for $100 instead of turning it into a $200 triple). By playing this way, the opponent had less of an advantage if the contestant missed the question and the opponent answered it correctly.

====Winning the game====
The game was played in rounds, with each contestant guaranteed one turn per round unless the outcome of the challenger&#x27;s turn made it unnecessary for the champion to take their own. The first contestant to reach $500 won the match and kept their money. If the challenger reached or surpassed $500 on the first turn of the round, the champion had one last chance to spin either three jokers or a combination that would tie or beat that score. Either contestant could win the game by reaching $500 with a correct answer to a question missed by the other, or by spinning three jokers and correctly answering a question in any category. If a round ended with the scores tied at $500 or more, the game continued until the tie was broken. As was common practice on Barry &amp; Enright’s productions during this period, champions played until they were defeated and received a new automobile after every fifth victory. There was an exception to this practice, however.

=====Winnings cap=====
At the time that &quot;The Joker’s Wild&quot; was airing in syndication, most syndicated programs had what was referred to as a “network of record”. This meant that &quot;The Joker’s Wild&quot; would be treated as if it was airing on a major network and be subjected to that network’s standards and practices policy, although stations that were not affiliated with said network could still air the show. In 1981, CBS became the network of record for &quot;The Joker’s Wild&quot; after striking an agreement with Barry &amp; Enright Productions to carry the program on its group of owned and operated stations.

At the time, CBS had a specific policy regarding game shows airing over its network. Any such program airing on CBS or a station owned by the network was subjected to a cap on winnings, with a contestant being retired upon reaching it. Some shows allowed for champions to keep all of their winnings once the limit was passed while others had a rule where any champion who won more than the limit was required to donate any overage to charity; the latter approach was employed for &quot;The Joker’s Wild&quot;.

The limit was in effect until the end of the 1983-84 season, when the contract between the two sides expired. In the three years of the arrangement, one contestant was retired because of the limit. In 1983, clinical psychologist Joe Dunn appeared on nine consecutive programs and won sixteen games, winning a total of $66,200 in cash and prizes; his total was the highest in show history in regular, non-tournament play.

On his tenth and final appearance, Barry opened the program by explaining the rules set upon the show by CBS, including an agreed upon cap of $35,000 in winnings. As Dunn continued to win games, Barry and the production staff went to CBS and requested that the limit be increased for Dunn. During the negotiations, Dunn was allowed to continue playing after he passed $35,000 in winnings and was retired as champion after an agreement was made. CBS agreed to allow Dunn to keep $50,000 of his total winnings, and he arranged to donate the $16,200 overage to United Cerebral Palsy.

===Bonus Round (&quot;Face the Devil&quot;)===
The wheels now contained 12 slides each, displaying various amounts of money ($25, $50, $75, $100, $150 and $200). One wheel contained a slide depicting a caricature of a devil. If the devil did not appear on a spin, the total of the displayed amounts was added to the pot. The object was to score $1,000 or more without spinning the devil; doing so won the money accumulated plus a prize package worth anywhere between $3,000 and $5,000. Spinning a natural triple automatically awarded the prize package, along with either $1,000 or the total in the pot plus the value of the triple, whichever was greater. (For example, a contestant who had $850 and spun a triple of $100&#x27;s would receive $1,150.) If the devil came up, the round ended and the contestant lost the accumulated money. After every safe spin, the contestant had the option to stop and keep the money won up to that point. Contestants who chose this option were often invited by the host to take an unofficial spin to see if the devil would have come up next. For the 1974–75 CBS daytime episodes, as well as the first six syndicated seasons, the same prize package was at stake for the entire show until won, but this was changed to a different prize package in each bonus round for the final three seasons.

In late 1974 on CBS, a special &quot;Lucky $100&quot; symbol appeared on each of the bonus reels. If a contestant spun all three of these symbols in one turn, they won not only the prize package and the $1,000, but also a $3,000 cash bonus and a trip around the world worth approximately $7,000. The bonus increased by $100 per day until it was won or the combined value of the bonus and trip reached $15,000. After the extra prizes were claimed, the Lucky $100 symbols were removed and the bonus game reverted to its standard format. It was also during this time that audience members were selected to play the bonus game.

==Tournament of Champions==
From 1977 until 1980, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; conducted an annual tournament of champions where contestants from the previous season returned to compete for an additional series of cash and prizes. 

The format of the tournament matches differed in several ways from the regular matches. Each question was played for points instead of dollars, and each round was played to its conclusion to allow both participants an equal amount of turns; this meant that if the first contestant was to reach 500 points, even if he/she had spun three jokers, the opposing contestant would get one more spin to try and match or beat that total. The first to reach 500 or more points advanced in the tournament, and no Face the Devil round was played. Once the tournament was down to its final two contestants, they would face off in a best-of-three match to determine the champion.

The first tournament was held during the series&#x27; first season and featured eight former contestants that had appeared on the original series on CBS. Frank Dillon was the victor and earned a total of $50,000 in cash and prizes. He also earned a spot in the 1978 tournament, with eight of the previous season&#x27;s highest winners competing for the right to face him in the championship final; Dillon won for the second consecutive time and was rewarded with an additional $100,000 in winnings. 

The 1979 tournament was conducted under a slightly different format. As before, there were eight participants competing for the right to play Dillon in the championship final. The preliminary and semifinal rounds were single elimination, but the penultimate match was a best of three. The winner of that match, Eileen Jayson, defeated Dillon in a best of five championship final to win $250,000. 

The 1980 tournament featured sixteen past champions playing for a prize pool of $1 million, the largest in television history to that point. Each of them was guaranteed a cash prize for competing, with the prize increasing depending on how far they advanced; the participants would receive half of that prize in cash, with the other half donated to a charity of choice. 

Below is the prize structure. 

* Eliminated in first (preliminary) round: $15,000
* Eliminated in quarterfinals: $25,000
* Eliminated in semifinals: $40,000
* Runner-up, finals: $200,000
* Winner, finals: $500,000

Rob Griffin won the tournament, and Cassandra Dooley was the runner-up. They each received their share of the prize money as a ten-year annuity, and respectively donated the balance to the March of Dimes and Big Brothers Big Sisters of America.

==Broadcast history==
In the late 1960s, Jack Barry pitched the concept of &quot;Joker&quot; to Goodson-Todman Productions. The company was not impressed, and Barry continued tinkering with the format over the next few years.

&quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; debuted on CBS September 4, 1972, incidentally on the same Labor Day when both the modern incarnation of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (which debuted after &quot;Joker&quot;) and the Wink Martindale hosted show &quot;Gambit&quot; (which debuted after &quot;Price&quot;) premiered. It ran until June 13, 1975, on that network, airing at 10:00 a.m. Eastern (9:00 Central). A total of 686 episodes were produced.

For the first two years, it faced NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dinah&#x27;s Place&quot;, the talk vehicle for singer/actress Dinah Shore, which gave way in July 1974 to the Dennis James revival of &quot;Name That Tune&quot;, which &quot;Joker&quot; easily defeated in the ratings. However, when NBC moved its panel game &quot;Celebrity Sweepstakes&quot; to 10:00/9:00 in January 1975, &quot;Joker&quot; went into steep decline, ending a nearly three-year run in the summer.

However, some big-market independent stations gave the game another chance the next year. After a syndicated rerun cycle of the last CBS season proved successful in 1976, the show returned to first-run syndication from September 5, 1977, to May 23, 1986 (airing back-to-back with sister show &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; in some markets, especially so during the aforementioned period where CBS&#x27; O&amp;Os added both series). Additionally, repeats of the CBS era were also seen on KTLA in Los Angeles from March 6 to September 8, 1978, in a double-run with the concurrent first-run syndicated episodes, replacing another Barry &amp; Enright series, &quot;Hollywood Connection&quot;.

A second revival for syndication was one of five game shows sold to local stations for the 1990–91 season. Premiering on September 10, 1990, the new &quot;Joker&quot; ran into the same ratings trouble that the other four series did and was the third, following a revival of its sibling show &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; and &quot;The Quiz Kids Challenge&quot;, to be canceled before the end of the television season. The last new episode aired on March 8, 1991.

===Taping locations===
From 1972 to 1975, the program taped at CBS Television City. From 1977 until 1986—with the exception of the 1984–85 season, which taped at the Production Group Studios near Columbia Square in Hollywood—the taping location was moved to the La Brea Avenue studios of KCOP-TV. Taping returned to CBS Television City for the 1990–91 version. The 2017–19 version of the show taped at Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City, California.

==Versions==
===1971: KTLA===
A tryout series aired locally on Los Angeles&#x27; KTLA for about three months and was hosted by Jack Barry. The rules were similar to the 1972–86 versions with the following changes:

Three contestants competed in each game, with the champion spinning first to begin the game. Spinning three different categories and answering a question in any of the three categories was worth $25, while pairs were worth $50 and triples were worth $100. $250 was the goal to win, with an equal number of turns for each contestant. A three-joker spin resulted in an automatic win with a correct response to a question from any of the five categories in play.

In the event of a tie, play continued until one was ahead after each round. The bonus round was similar to that of the Ludden pilots but had more elaborate prizes.

Highlights of this version were shown during promos of the eventual series, which began production on CBS in 1972.

===1972–75===
For the first two weeks, triples were worth $150 and a three-joker spin resulted in an automatic win for a contestant without having to answer a question. From the premiere until around May 1974, the champion went first in each round; afterwards, the challenger did.

====Bonus Round====
The bonus round went through a few different iterations:
* Prize Round #1: The wheels were loaded with various prizes. The champion spun once and could either keep the prizes that came up, or decline them in favor of a second spin; in the latter case, they automatically received the prizes from that spin. Some prizes were marked with circles; if three circled prizes came up in a single spin, the contestant won a car in addition to those items. This format was only used on the first two episodes.
* Prize Round #2: Beginning with the third aired episode, the circles were eliminated and the car was added to the prize wheels, in addition to other high-value items such as boats and trips. This format lasted through the second week.
* Jokers and Devils: Beginning with the third week, the wheels contained only jokers and devils (see above for description). The contestant took up to three spins, receiving a prize of increasing value every time three jokers came up. If a devil appeared at any time, the round ended and they lost all prizes accumulated to that point. The contestant could end the round after any safe spin and keep the prizes they had won. Originally, the contestant was given up to four spins, with a large prize such as a car or trip at stake on the last one. For a brief period, the prize for a spin was not revealed until after the wheels had stopped. In 1973, to avoid confusion between the wheels used in the main game and bonus round, the jokers on the bonus round wheels were marked with the word &quot;Joker&quot; instead of the word &quot;Wild&quot;.
* Face the Devil: Starting around May 1974, the &quot;Face the Devil&quot; round described above had been implemented.

====Joker&#x27;s Jackpot====
Early in the show&#x27;s run, returning champions were competing for a chance to win the Joker&#x27;s Jackpot, an accruing cash jackpot that started at $2,500. Contestants won this jackpot if they won three (originally four) consecutive games. After the &quot;Jokers and Devils&quot; bonus round stopped offering a fourth prize, a new automobile was added to the jackpot instead. However, if the champion was defeated, all of their cash winnings were forfeited to the jackpot, though prizes won in the bonus round were theirs to keep. After every game, the champion decided whether to play on for a chance to win the jackpot, or keep all their winnings and leave the show. The jackpot continued to build until it reached $25,000, which was at the time CBS&#x27;s winnings limit for game show contestants.

Originally, after winning the Joker&#x27;s Jackpot, the champion was retired undefeated, but in February 1973 the rules were changed to allow champions to continue playing until either being defeated or reaching the maximum CBS winnings limit. Once a champion won the Joker&#x27;s Jackpot, that money (and the car, once it was added) was theirs to keep even if they lost a subsequent game.

Upon implementation of the &quot;Face the Devil&quot; bonus round, the Joker&#x27;s Jackpot was discontinued. Contestants kept whatever they earned, while still retiring after winning $25,000, and received a car after every fifth victory.

====Audience Game====
An audience game was played beginning with the 1981–82 season. Three members of the studio audience were selected to win money and a chance to spin against the devil. Each audience member had one spin to get as much money as possible. The wheels contained money amounts ($10, $20, $30, $40, $50 and $100), with $300 the highest amount possible in one spin. All three audience members kept whatever totals they spun; the high scorer went on to play &quot;Face the Devil&quot; for a bonus prize and cash, using the same rules and dollar amounts as the onstage contestants. Ties were broken with an additional spin, and the tied members kept the money they scored on this spin in addition to their previous winnings.

When Bill Cullen began hosting in fall 1984, two audience members were chosen along with a home viewer who played by pressing a key on their touch-tone telephone to spin the wheels. The game was played onstage instead of in the audience as Barry and Peck had done to accommodate Cullen&#x27;s limited range of motion on a stage.

When the audience game was first introduced, it was played at least once every week (usually on the Friday episode). Each audience member was allowed a maximum of two spins, and could either stop after the first or decline that score in hopes of improving it on the second. These rules were later changed to those described above, and the feature began appearing daily halfway through the 1981–82 season.

===&quot;Joker! Joker!! Joker!!!&quot; (1979–81)===
&quot;Joker! Joker!! Joker!!!&quot; was a special once-weekly version of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild,&quot; with Barry hosting, in which children competed with appropriately-themed subject matter. Prior to its debut, beginning in 1973, &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; featured children playing every year around Easter.

The format was essentially the same, with some slight alterations. In the main game, the children played for points instead of money, with 500 points needed to win. The winning contestant received a $500 education bond, while the loser received a $100 bond. The special categories &quot;Mystery&quot; and &quot;Fast Forward&quot; were not used in this version, but &quot;Multiple Choice&quot; was. As before, full rounds were played, and the contestant who reached 500 points or more after each completed round won; if the score was tied at 500 or more, additional rounds were played to break the tie. A three-joker spin still was worth an automatic win with one correct answer from any of the five categories in play. More jokers were also added to the wheels, which Barry himself pointed out during one episode.

The joker cards contained a more juvenile-looking animated joker performing a handstand (with the word &quot;Joker&quot; written below the design), and the children played the &quot;Face the Devil&quot; round under the same rules as the adults on &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, except that members of their families joined them onstage for assistance. During the CBS era, the &quot;Jokers and Devils&quot; round was in play; however, prizes already won were not at risk when going for future prizes. Also, both the winner and loser got to spin for prizes; the loser got to spin one time, while the winner got to spin up to three times. Additionally, children were allowed to confer with their parents/relatives when choosing categories, but were required to answer questions themselves.

===1990–91===
Game play was changed dramatically when the series returned to syndication in 1990. In particular, the regular questions were replaced with terms that the contestants had to define. This version lasted only one season and was hosted by Pat Finn. A memorial plaque was placed on the slot machine as a tribute to Jack Barry, and the wheels were replaced by video monitors that simulated the appearance of spinning.

====Format #1====

=====Round 1=====
In the first round, three contestants (one a returning champion) competed to be the first to reach $500. The game began with a toss-up clue, and whoever buzzed in first with the correct answer gained control of the machine. The wheels contained cash amounts from $5 to $60 in multiples of $5, and the far right wheel also held a joker.

If the contestant spun only cash amounts, they were read a series of rapid-fire clues and had to identify the subject to which each one referred. Each correct response awarded the total showing on the wheels, but a miss or a failure to respond within three seconds allowed either opponent a chance to buzz in and steal both the money and control of the next spin. If the joker came up, the contestant had 15 seconds to answer as many clues as possible, each one worth triple the total on the other two wheels. A miss immediately forfeited any remaining time and gave the opponents a chance to steal. If no one answered a clue correctly, control reverted to the contestant who had spun last.

The round ended as soon as any contestant reached or exceeded $500, and the low scorer was eliminated from the game and received parting gifts.

=====Round 2=====
The two remaining contestants retained their scores from Round 1, and the high scorer had initial control. For this round, the dollar values ranged from $10 to $75 in multiples of $5, and the contestant chose one of two categories after spinning. Play proceeded as in Round 1, with one change: if an &quot;Opponent&#x27;s Choice&quot; card came up on the far right wheel, the opponent selected the category for that turn.

The first contestant to reach or exceed $2,000 won the game, kept the money, and became champion. The losing contestant left with parting gifts.

====Format #2====
On January 7, 1991, the front game format was reworked to incorporate elements of the version hosted by Jack Barry and Bill Cullen. Although the game was still played with the definition format, the wheels were loaded with categories and jokers and the contestant in control selected a displayed category after spinning. Correct answers awarded $25, $50, or $100 for a single, pair, or triple respectively. As in the first format, a miss or failure to respond gave either opponent a chance to buzz in and steal the money and control. Spinning three jokers immediately added $250 to the contestant&#x27;s score, set the question value at $100, and revealed a category in each window for them to choose on that turn. It was possible for the same category to appear on more than one wheel after such a spin.

The options to discard jokers or go off the board with them were removed; if one or two came up on a spin, they all had to be matched to a displayed category. In addition, no bonus was awarded for spinning a natural triple.

The winning score for Round 1 was increased to $1,000, while $2,000 was still needed to win Round 2 and the game. A new set of categories was loaded onto the wheels for Round 2. The pace of gameplay was changed to allow games to straddle between episodes, if an episode ended without enough time to play the bonus round.

====Tiebreaker====
In both formats, a second-place tie at the end of Round 1 was resolved by allowing each contestant to answer as many clues unopposed as they could, with their turn ending at the first miss. The contestant who gave more correct answers advanced to Round 2.

====Bonus Round====
The champion had 60 seconds to identify as many words as possible, all starting with the same letter of the alphabet. The host read a maximum of three definitions per word, and the champion could offer multiple guesses at any time without penalty. The host would only move on to a new word once the contestant either identified the current one or passed after hearing its last definition. Each correct response awarded one spin of the machine, whose wheels were now loaded with prizes, jokers, and cash amounts. After each spin, the champion could freeze one or more wheels, putting them out of play for the rest of the round. If one or two jokers came up, they had to be matched immediately to a displayed prize.

If the champion got the same prize showing on all three wheels before running out of spins, they won it. If three jokers came up in a single spin, the champion won the Joker Jackpot, a cash award that started at $5,000 and increased by $500 every day it went unclaimed. The largest Joker Jackpot won was $36,000 in 1991.

====1990s audience game====
As in the Barry/Cullen version, the revival gave audience members a chance to win money, but only in situations where a game ended sooner than expected. One audience member at a time was chosen to spin the machine up to three times, under the same rules as the bonus round. They won $100 for getting three of the same prize or three Jokers, or a &quot;Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; T-shirt for failing to do so.

====Final week change====
During the final first-run week of this version (March 4–8, 1991), the format reverted to the original format without categories.

===2017===
On May 17, 2017, it was announced that TBS would reboot the show with Calvin &quot;Snoop Dogg&quot; Broadus acting as host and serving as the executive producer along with Michael Strahan appropriately titled here as &quot;Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;. The revival premiered on October 24, 2017. In January 2018, the show was renewed for a second season. On December 21, 2018, Broadus announced that the show would be moving to fellow WarnerMedia network TNT starting with its third season premiering in 2019. Jeannie Mai served as hostess in the first season. Beginning in the second season, there is no co-host.

Each episode is self-contained, with no straddling games or returning champions. The front game consists of two rounds, each of which uses a separate set of five categories. Both contestants receive four spins in the first round and three in the second. In the first round, singles, pairs, and triples are worth $100, $200, and $300 respectively; spinning three jokers earns the contestant a separate question worth $500. Dollar values are doubled for the second round, with the trailing player or, in case of a tie, the player that went last, spinning first. Jokers may not be used to go off the board, but must be matched to a displayed category, and the game can end early if one contestant attains an insurmountable lead. If one contestant misses a question, their opponent is not given a chance to steal. If the scores are tied after two rounds, each player takes one last spin and the high scorer becomes the champion.

In the second season, the game is played in three rounds. Both players get two spins in each round, with all values doubled for the second round and tripled for the third. New categories are only introduced at the start of the second round. Additionally, in the third round, a player may challenge their opponent to answer the question (&quot;Slang That Thang&quot;); the opponent receives the money with a correct response, while the player scores on a miss. If the scores are tied after three rounds, each player chooses one of three face-down cards and the one with the higher draw becomes the champion; if the cards match, further tiebreakers are played until there is a winner.

The winner plays Face the Devil, with values from $300 to $1,500 and jokers worth $2,000 on the wheels. If the player either spins three jokers or accumulates at least $10,000 without seeing the Devil, their total is increased to $25,000 in season 1 or $50,000 in season 2, in addition to the money won in the main game. In season 2, the host occasionally offers extra cash in addition to the accumulated total as an incentive for the player to quit the round.

====&quot;Gettin&#x27; Wild with Snoop Dogg&quot;====
Prior to the shows&#x27; premiere, an all-exclusive six episode documentary series aired on the TBS app, TBS social media handles including the Facebook Watch tab along its very own website at TBS.com. Directed by Rory Karpf, the show chronicles Snoop Dogg&#x27;s transition to a game show host as it explores his creative processes behind the show&#x27;s reboot. The six episodes were posted on the official Facebook and YouTube page every Friday at 4:20 p.m. ET.

==Merchandise==
Board-game manufacturer Milton Bradley produced three editions of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; home game from 1973 to 1975, as well as a kids’ version of &quot;Joker! Joker!! Joker!!!&quot; in 1979. The standard editions of the game included the “Jokers and Devils” bonus round, while the kids’ edition replicated the “Face the Devil” bonus.

Plans for an Atari 2600 and Mattel Intellivision version of &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; were announced by The Great Game Company in 1983, but due to the video game crash of 1983, it was never released for either console.

In 1994, Philips produced two editions for its CD-i platform based on &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, licensed by Sony Pictures Entertainment, who owned the franchise at that point. These games featured television game show hosts and were based more or less on the first syndicated series, while the sets on both games resembled the 1990 version. Wink Martindale hosted the first edition, while Marc Summers could be found on a special &quot;Junior&quot; edition of the game. The late Charlie O&#x27;Donnell served as the announcer for both games. Martindale was among the first candidates to host the original series when CBS was still not entirely sold on Jack Barry as host, due to his involvement in the quiz show scandals of the 1950s. However, Martindale already chose to host &quot;Gambit,&quot; another of the three game shows that premiered on the same day in 1972 on CBS (&quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; also debuted that day). O&#x27;Donnell was an announcer on the series. The theme music in these games was a remix of the 1977–86 theme.

In 2003, a mobile game based on &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; was released by Sony Pictures Digital Entertainment.

In 2005, 2007, 2008 and 2009, IGT released video slot machines based on the 1970s version of the show.

===Snoop Dogg Presents The Joker&#x27;s Wild===
A &quot;Snapchat&quot; video lens was released on October 18, 2017, where Snoop would dance in the lens next to the snapchat user who would act as the dancing joker. The lens features custom green screen footage of Snoop Dogg that was shot exclusively for the lens experience.

An online game was released on October 24, 2017, where fans of the show can play along via the TBS Android and iOS apps, or on TBS.com.

In 2020, a slot machine game based on the show was released by Everie.

==Episode status==
The status of the KTLA series is unknown; only brief footage is known to survive through 1972 CBS promos.

For many years, only the third season of the CBS run was known to exist, as the first two seasons were presumed to be wiped due to network practices of the era (although CBS was far less prone to master tape wiping than ABC and NBC).

In 2000, a search of New York&#x27;s WCBS-TV found the original master tapes of both the first two seasons (restoring the full 686-episode run of the original CBS daytime series) and the entire series of &quot;Spin-Off&quot; (which replaced &quot;Joker&quot; in 1975) in a tape storage room.

A clip from a January 1974 celebrity week was used during the network&#x27;s anniversary special &quot;CBS At 75&quot;. This version of the show is currently held by Sony Pictures Television &amp; CBS Television Distribution.

The 1977–1986 syndicated episodes exist, and were rerun (with the exceptions of the 1980–81, 1981–82, 1983–84, and 1984–85 seasons) on GSN, as were the first few months of the CBS era.

USA Network reran episodes of the Cullen era from April 1985 to April 1987. The network also aired the 1990 revival from December 30, 1991 to September 11, 1992 and March 29, 1993 to June 24, 1994.

In 2006, Sony Pictures Television and King World attempted to develop a new version for syndication, paired with a new show called &quot;Combination Lock&quot;; however, neither project was picked up. On December 4, 2023, Wink Martindale uploaded a run-through for this version, hosted by producer Mark Maxwell-Smith and featuring Charlie O&#x27;Donnell as announcer, to his YouTube channel.

<text>Camille Coduri (born 18 April 1965) is an English actress. She gained prominence through her role as Jackie Tyler, the mother of Rose Tyler, in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005–2006, 2008, 2010). She has since appeared in the BBC comedies &quot;Him &amp; Her&quot; (2010–2013) and &quot;King Gary&quot; (2018–2021), and the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Big Boys&quot; (2022–2025).

Her films include &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; (1990), &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Firm&quot; (2009).

==Early life==
Coduri was born in south London. She studied drama at Kingsway Princeton College. She pursued higher education for only four months to resit her O Levels, and left to go into theatre.

==Career==
Coduri featured in the film comedies &quot;Hawks&quot; (1988), &quot;Nuns on the Run&quot; (1990) and &quot;King Ralph&quot; (1991). She has also appeared extensively on British television, appearing in guest roles in episodes of series such as &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot;, &quot;Boon&quot;, &quot;A Touch of Frost&quot; and in the BBC&#x27;s 1997 adaptation of Henry Fielding&#x27;s novel &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot;. She appeared in BBC Three&#x27;s six-part drama series &quot;Sinchronicity&quot; (2006).

Coduri recurred regularly in the first two series of the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot; as Jackie Tyler and reprised her role in the Series 4 episode &quot;Journey&#x27;s End&quot; (2008) and David Tennant&#x27;s final episode, &quot;The End of Time&quot; (2010). She also participated in a &quot;Doctor Who&quot;-themed episode of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, first broadcast on 30 March 2007. She won the game, beating Noel Clarke (Mickey Smith) in the final round, splitting the prize money of £16,550 evenly between multiple sclerosis and children who are carers.

In an episode of &quot;Ashes to Ashes&quot; (April 2010), Coduri played a woman who helps DCI Gene Hunt and DI Alex Drake during an investigation. In September 2010, she joined BBC Three comedy &quot;Him &amp; Her&quot;, playing Shelly.

On 15 May 2017, it was announced that Coduri would reprise her role as Jackie Tyler in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Big Finish Productions audio &quot;Infamy of the Zaross&quot;, which was released on 23 November 2017. She also reprised her role as Jackie Tyler in the Big Finish audios &quot;Wednesdays For Beginners&quot; (part of The Lives of Captain Jack, 2017), &quot;Retail Therapy&quot; (part of The Ninth Doctor Chronicles, 2017), &quot;The Siege of Big Ben&quot; and &quot;Flight into Hull&quot; (part of Short Trips, 2018).

She is the narrator of the Ninth Doctor audiobooks &quot;The Monsters Inside&quot; (2011), &quot;The Stealers of Dreams&quot; (2011), &quot;Winner Takes All&quot; (2011) and &quot;Rose&quot; (2018) (novellisation), as well as the Tenth Doctor novelisation &quot;The Christmas Invasion&quot; (2018), produced by BBC Audio.

<text>Penelakut Island (called Kuper Island by most people between 1851–2010) is located in the southern Gulf Islands between Vancouver Island and the mainland Pacific coast of British Columbia, Canada. The island has a population of about 300 members of the Penelakut Band. The island has an area of . There is frequent car and passenger ferry service to Penelakut from Chemainus on Vancouver Island. On its west side sits Telegraph Harbour.

A Mediterranean climate of mild winters and warm, dry summers supports a unique ecosystem and an ideal living environment. The island is in the rain shadow of Vancouver Island, with an annual rainfall of about . Unlike most neighbouring Gulf Islands, the topography is subdued with few bluffs or rock outcrops. Poorly drained soils are common.

There is a Roman Catholic Church and a longhouse, but no commercial establishments on the island. Because it is an Indian reserve, property is not available for purchase. (There is one private lot dating from the events of 1863).

From 1890 to 1978, the Catholic Church operated a residential school on the island. The present comprehensive school is run by the Penelakut. There is still much bitterness in the community over the violence and sexual abuse suffered by Indigenous children who attended the school. In 2002, Glenn Doughty, a Catholic Oblate brother who was employed at the school was sentenced to three years in prison for his historical crimes at the Kuper Island School, including indecent assault on a male, gross indecency, and one count of buggery involving 11 different victims. Those were the laws on the books when the crimes occurred in the 1960s and &#x27;70s., and former attendees say the abusive practices were widespread. In July 2021, an announcement was made that 160 unmarked graves were identified near the site of the residential school.

==History==

Britain&#x27;s Royal Navy, surveying the area in 1851, cruised into a group of five islands in the Strait of Georgia, declaring the colonial name of the two largest islands to be Kuper and Thetis, after their Captain Augustus Leopold Kuper R.N. (1809–1885) and his frigate, HMS &quot;Thetis&quot;, a 36-gun Royal Navy frigate on the Pacific Station between 1851 and 1853.

In 1861 about 300 Bella Bella Indigenous people in 19 large canoes were ordered away from Victoria by Governor James Douglas. On their return journey north, they staged a surprise attack at dawn on the Penelahut natives of Kuper Island, a tribe of about 400 in number. About 225 Penelahuts were murdered in one of the worse massacres recorded.

A Nanaimo chief named Winni-win-chin was visiting Kuper Island. He escaped to Nanaimo and reported the massacre to Mr. A.G. Horne, in charge of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post. Mr. Horne dispatched canoe men to Victoria to report the act.

On April 20, 1863, the British gunboat HMS &quot;Forward&quot; attacked the native village on Kuper Island. The captain believed that the village harboured individuals of the separate Lamalchi tribe involved in two recent assaults in the Gulf Islands in which three Europeans had been killed in combat. The gunboat fired on the village but, unprepared for a naval landing, withdrew with one casualty after a fierce battle with island warriors. Following the event, the colonial government responded with one of the largest military assaults in British Columbia&#x27;s history, which took place on the east coast of Vancouver Island and extended throughout the waters and islands of Active Pass, Trincomali Channel and Stuart Channel. Subsequently, having gained control of the region, the government publicly hanged four Indigenous men in Victoria and established colonial governance in the region, ultimately forming the Province of British Columbia.

<text>Picture-in-picture (PiP) is a feature that can be found in television receivers, personal computers, and smartphones. It consists of a video stream playing within an inset window, freeing the rest of the screen for other tasks.

For televisions, picture-in-picture requires two independent tuners or signal sources to supply the large and the small picture. Two-tuner PiP TVs have a second tuner built in, but a single-tuner PiP TV requires an external signal source, which may be an external tuner, videocassette recorder, DVD player, or cable box. Picture-in-picture is often used to watch one program while waiting for another to start or advertisements to finish.

==History==
Adding a picture to an existing picture was done long before affordable PiP was available on consumer products. The first PiP was seen on the televised coverage of the 1976 Summer Olympics where a Quantel digital framestore device was used to insert a close-up picture of the Olympic flame during the opening ceremony. In 1978 Sharp introduced its TV in TV &quot;Mr.X&quot; (CT-1804 X) in Japan; the export version began in 1979 as &quot;Dualvision&quot; (17D50). In 1980, NEC introduced its &quot;Popvision&quot; television (CV-20T74P) in Japan with a rudimentary picture-aside-picture feature: a separate 6&quot; (15 cm) CRT and tuner complemented the set&#x27;s main 20&quot; (50 cm) screen. Its price was ¥298,000 MSRP, equal to about $1,200 (at $1 = ¥250), and $1,200 in 1980 had the approximate buying power of $3,000 in 2007.

An early consumer implementation of picture-in-picture was the Multivision set-top box; it was not a commercial success. Later, PiP became available as a feature of advanced television receivers.

The first widespread consumer implementation of picture-in-picture was produced by Philips in 1983 in their high-end television sets. A separate video or RF input was available on the back of the set and displayed in black and white on one of the four corners of the screen. Televisions at the time were still in analog format, and earlier versions of the PiP implemented in analog were too costly. New digital technology allowed the second video signal to be digitized and saved in a digital memory chip, then replayed in a mini version. While the new technology was not good enough for color or full-screen viewing, it did provide a low-cost PiP feature.

The Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD specifications included picture-in-picture, allowing viewers to see content such as the director&#x27;s commentary on a film they are watching. All the Blu-ray Disc titles in 2006 and 2007 that had a PiP track used two separate HD encodings, with one of the HD encodings including a hard-coded PiP track. Starting in 2008 Blu-ray Disc titles started being released that use one HD and one SD video track which can be combined with a Bonus View or BD-Live player. This method uses less disc space, allowing for PiP to be more easily added to a title. Several studios released Bonus View PiP Blu-ray Disc titles in 2008 such as &quot;Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil: Extinction&quot;, &quot;V for Vendetta&quot;, and &quot;War&quot;.

In 2011, after DirecTV released the HR34 Home Media Center HD DVR, picture-in-picture was introduced to all HD DVR models onwards; The feature has five options: Upper Left, Upper Right, Lower Right, Lower Left, and Side-by-Side.

== Software support ==
Some streaming video websites may minimize a video stream similarly when browsing outside the playback page. Some web browsers (including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari) provide APIs or similar functions that allow a playing video to be opened in a pop-up overlay atop other applications.

The mobile operating systems Android (starting with Android 7.0 for Android TV devices and Android 8.0 for other devices) and iOS (starting with iOS 14) similarly provide native APIs for picture-in-picture overlays.

<text>Living in Clip is a live album by singer-songwriter Ani DiFranco, released in 1997. The title is from a comment made by live sound engineer Larry Berger, indicating that the amplifiers weren&#x27;t merely being overdriven into clipping occasionally (which is not uncommon in live sound situations); they were clipping so much that they were &quot;living in clip&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; named it one of &quot;The Essential Recordings of the ‘90s&quot;.

<doc id="926806" wikidata="Q3640758" url="?curid=926806" title="Black Sea (XTC album)">
<text>Black Sea is the fourth studio album by the English rock band XTC, released 12 September 1980 on Virgin Records. It is the follow-up to the previous year&#x27;s &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, building upon its focus on guitars and expansive-sounding drums, but with more economical arrangements written with the band&#x27;s subsequent concert performances in mind, avoiding overdubs unless they could be performed live.

Like &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, &quot;Black Sea&quot; was recorded at Virgin&#x27;s Town House studio in London with producer Steve Lillywhite and engineer Hugh Padgham. It was originally titled &quot;Work Under Pressure&quot; in reference to XTC&#x27;s grueling touring and recording regimen. After their manager complained, frontman Andy Partridge devised &quot;Black Sea&quot; as a reference to his emotional state while composing the album. From 1980 to 1981, the band supported the album on tour as the opening act for the Police. His fatigue worsened and XTC ceased touring indefinitely by 1982.

&quot;Black Sea&quot; was critically acclaimed and remains XTC&#x27;s second-highest charting British album, placing at number 16 on the UK Albums Chart, as well as their most successful US album, peaking at number 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It spawned three UK top 40 singles: &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; (number 32), &quot;Towers of London&quot; (number 31), and &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; (number 16). Another single, &quot;Respectable Street&quot;, was banned from BBC radio due to its references to abortion and a &quot;Sony Entertainment Centre&quot;.

==Background==

In August 1979, XTC released their third LP &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, a more pop-oriented venture than the previous &quot;Go 2&quot; (1978). It was met with positive reviews and a number 34 chart peak. Bassist Colin Moulding&#x27;s dissatisfaction with XTC&#x27;s &quot;quirky&quot; reputation inspired the group to take a more accessible approach with the album. In his recollection, &quot;Up until that point, we were viewed as a poor man’s Talking Heads or something ... when we came out with &quot;Drums and Wires&quot; it was like a different band, really.&quot; Lead single &quot;Making Plans for Nigel&quot; went further to propel the band&#x27;s popularity, with every date of their proceeding UK tour sold-out. They still felt that they were not &quot;fashionable&quot; in England. The LP sold particularly well in Canada and other parts of the world, but in England, sales were at a minimal improvement from their previous records.

Frontman Andy Partridge sensed that he was losing the band&#x27;s leadership, partly due to Moulding providing all of their charting singles to date and the resultant favouritism attracted from their label Virgin Records. He attempted to exert more authority in the group, later calling himself &quot;a very benevolent dictator.&quot; Guitarist Dave Gregory disagreed, recalling that the band was &quot;pretty tired&quot; and that Partridge &quot;could be a little bit of a bully.&quot; Moulding offered: &quot;Virgin wanted a quick follow-up to &#x27;Nigel.&#x27; I felt pressured but Andy was champing at the bit to redress the balance and prove that he could write a chart hit, too.&quot; To follow &quot;Nigel&quot;, the band recorded Partridge&#x27;s &quot;Wait Till Your Boat Goes Down&quot; with production by Phil Wainman of Bay City Rollers fame. Partridge thought of the song as the band&#x27;s &quot;Hey Jude&quot; and expected that it would catapult the group&#x27;s successes. Instead, it was their lowest-selling single to date.

Between late 1979 and early 1980, the members spent a significant amount of time on tour, making stops in Japan, Britain, mainland Europe and the United States, while also writing the songs that would form &quot;Black Sea&quot;. The group played gigs almost six nights a week for two months, an arrangement that Partridge said turned him into a &quot;vegetable&quot; and made him believe he &quot;cracked up in a minor sort of way.&quot; During one of their performances, he suffered a brief memory lapse, forgetting XTC&#x27;s songs as well as his own identity. Meanwhile, he released the side LP &quot;Take Away / The Lure of Salvage&quot;, Gregory played on Peter Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;Melt&quot;, whilst Moulding and Chambers recorded singles under the moniker &quot;the Colonel&quot; with producer Mick Glossop. The band also contributed the song &quot;Take This Town&quot; to the 1980 film &quot;Times Square&quot;.

==Production and style==

As with &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, &quot;Black Sea&quot; was recorded at Virgin&#x27;s The Town House studio in London with producer Steve Lillywhite and engineer Hugh Padgham. The team were asked to return for the recording of &quot;Take This Town&quot;. Partridge remembered seeing &quot;how Steve and Hugh had progressed&quot; after working with Peter Gabriel and developing their signature gated reverb drum sound: &quot;I think they developed a few interesting new techniques and there was a new toughness to our recordings.&quot; By comparison, the experience with Wainman proved unsatisfactory. The original intention was for XTC to produce themselves, but Virgin did not allow them to.

Partridge described the production as taking &quot;&quot;Drums and Wires&quot; to the Nth degree ... The drums got boomier and bigger and more gated and more aggressive, and the guitars got slashier, with more punch to them.&quot; Gregory attributed the band&#x27;s tighter sound to their 18 months touring &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, which strengthened &quot;our performance muscles.&quot; Moulding added that, in that time, Gregory&#x27;s 1960s influences was starting to revitalize the band&#x27;s interest in the music of that era. Gregory said the band had simplified into a &quot;beat&quot; group, with songs less elaborate than the ones recorded for &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;. Partridge imposed the rule that no overdubs should be recorded unless they can be performed live.

&quot;Black Sea&quot; was recorded in six weeks, longer than &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;, during which time the band resided on an upper floor of the studio. Moulding said it was a &quot;Real luxury—bare box rooms with a bed and carpet.&quot; Gregory did not enjoy the recording experience due to his disappointment in himself as a non-contributing songwriter, his diabetes, and his uncomfortable working relationship with Partridge. As Gregory explained, &quot;He&#x27;s not a very giving musician when it&#x27;s his song you&#x27;re recording. ... I was incredibly frustrated during the sessions and then it was just tour, tour, tour.&quot; Commenting on how their playing styles intersected, Partridge said: &quot;Dave and I worked to not tread on each other&#x27;s toes musically, so we played in the holes left by the other.&quot; Gregory played &quot;the more complicated parts&quot; due to Partridge&#x27;s consideration for live performances: &quot;I was a stickler for it sounding as close to the record as we could get it. So, if I had to do the vocals, I usually gave myself a simpler part that I could play and sing with.&quot;

==Songs==
&quot;Respectable Street&quot; was lyrically inspired by Partridge&#x27;s observations of Bowood Road, a Swindon street that was diagonally opposite to where he lived at the time, as well as a next-door neighbour nicknamed &quot;Mrs. Washing&quot;. Once the song was finished, he realised that there &quot;couldn&#x27;t be any other nation I&#x27;m talking about&quot; besides England, and appended an old-fashioned Noël Coward-style intro that was then repurposed for the bridge section.

&quot;Generals and Majors&quot; was written by Moulding as a satirical take on the phrase &quot;oh, what a lovely war&quot;. The song was Moulding&#x27;s attempt at a composition with one chord, inspired by the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Doctor Robert&quot; and &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;, while the guitar riff was supplied by Partridge. Chambers played a disco drumbeat.

&quot;Living Through Another Cuba&quot;, a live favourite, is about Partridge&#x27;s fears of the Cold War and Britain’s downplayed role in it. “It was total nuclear-war paranoia. That, and the uselessness of England – this completely and utterly useless little country whose significance in the world ended at the First World War.” 

&quot;Towers of London&quot; is a tribute to the workers who constructed Victorian era London. It is one of the few XTC songs that modulates key, which was unintentional, and one of the few XTC recordings that necessitated an edit on Chambers&#x27; drum performance. The music stemmed from Partridge &quot;subconsciously&quot; trying to rewrite the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Rain&quot;, desiring &quot;clangorous guitars crashing together, and sort of droning.&quot; At the beginning of the recording, Lillywhite is heard saying &quot;take-a-hundred-and-three&quot;, followed by the same phrase echoed by Chambers and Partridge, who are imitating the voice of Ian Reid. This was one of the band&#x27;s running jokes during sessions.

&quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; is a lyrical throwback to the group&#x27;s earlier songs when they were known as the Helium Kidz. It was considered &quot;the most irrelevant song on the album&quot; by Partridge. He explained: &quot;I wrote it as a bit of fun, rehearsed it and started to think, &#x27;Why did I write this?&#x27; Then the record company go, &#x27;Brilliant, it&#x27;s a single.&#x27; I wish I hadn&#x27;t written it, this is crass but not enjoyably crass.&quot;

&quot;Travels in Nihilon&quot;, the album&#x27;s closing track, is about Partridge&#x27;s feelings of disillusionment with the music industry. The song (and album) ends with the sound of a shower running, meant to mimic the sound of rain falling, but someone told Partridge they thought it instead sounded like someone urinating, which he liked even more as he thought it fit with the song&#x27;s lyrical theme of &quot;the Pop industry, the fashion industry, the religion industry -- pissing on you, in contempt, for being such a dolt and buying into all their shit!&quot; 

==Title and packaging==
The band wanted the album&#x27;s cover design to be a marked contrast from &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;. One of the potential titles for the LP—had drummer Terry Chambers agreed to pose in a Lurex tuxedo for the album cover—was &quot;Terry and the Lovemen&quot;. Late in production, the title was changed to &quot;Work Under Pressure&quot;, in conjunction with the cover photo depicting the members in diving suits, before being vetoed by manager Ian Reid, who felt the title reflected negatively on him. In Japan, the album was initially advertised under this title. Later, XTC appropriated the title &quot;Terry and the Lovemen&quot; as their pseudonym on the tribute album &quot;A Testimonial Dinner: The Songs of XTC&quot; (1995).

&quot;Black Sea&quot; was ultimately chosen to fit the nautical theme and to express the feelings of claustrophobia that Partridge felt at the time. He said his state of mind &quot;was very black. People were buying copies of Sandy Lesberg&#x27;s &quot;Violence in Our Time&quot; and leaving them ... strewn around the studio ... It&#x27;s just the worst photographs you could ever imagine in one book: Belsen, child molestations, murders.&quot; Early copies of the UK, US and Australian editions of the LP came with the sleeve enclosed in a sea-green paper bag.

==Release==
===Sales and promotion===
Released on 12 September 1980, &quot;Black Sea&quot; sold moderately, with 7 weeks spent on the UK album charts and a number 16 peak. In the US, the album spent 24 weeks on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; album charts and reached its peak position of number 41 in February 1981. Virgin&#x27;s marketing department found &quot;Black Sea&quot; difficult to promote, and so publicity campaigns were split between &quot;serious&quot; national media, the independent music press, and schoolgirl-oriented magazines. Partridge remembered that the label &quot;wanted us to be the power-pop teen dream thing.&quot;

Several singles were issued, including the UK top 40 hits &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; (number 32), &quot;Towers of London&quot; (number 31) and &quot;Sgt. Rock (Is Going to Help Me)&quot; (number 16). &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; elicited feminist hate-mail for the lyric &quot;keep her stood in line&quot;. The band performed the song on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot;, where Partridge gave away his acoustic guitar. &quot;Respectable Street&quot; was banned from BBC radio due to its references to abortion and a &quot;Sony Entertainment Centre&quot;. &quot;Love at First Sight&quot; was issued exclusively in Canada.

Music videos were filmed for &quot;Towers of London&quot;, &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; and &quot;Respectable Street&quot;. &quot;Towers of London&quot; was initially the lead single, but after filming the video, Virgin changed plans and decided to issue &quot;Generals and Majors&quot; first. On 10 October 1980, BBC-2 premiered the documentary &quot;XTC at the Manor&quot;. It largely featured the group at The Manor Studio for a faked studio session of &quot;Towers of London&quot;. During its filming, the band voiced their concerns with having no video for &quot;Generals and Majors&quot;. In response, Virgin owner Richard Branson rented war uniforms and organized a makeshift video featuring himself, his friends and the band. Partridge called it &quot;the worst video ever made by man.&quot;

===Touring===
From 1980 to 1981, XTC toured Australia, New Zealand and the US as the opening act for the Police. They did two tours with the group, one in the summer and another in the autumn. Todd Rundgren attended a date in Chicago, and Robert Stigwood met XTC backstage at The Ritz in New York, telling them they were the most exciting live band he had seen since the Who. In Athens, Georgia, XTC were supported by local band R.E.M., who covered XTC songs in their set. The night after John Lennon was killed, XTC played a gig at Liverpool, where they performed both &quot;Towers of London&quot; and &quot;Rain&quot; in tribute to the Beatles.

At this point, XTC were playing in arena stadiums while Partridge, encumbered by XTC&#x27;s touring regimen, began declining further in his mental state. While in upstate New York in December 1980, Partridge exited the tour van to relieve himself: &quot;I jumped out of the van and wandered into this field ... and I thought, &#x27;Who am I? Who the hell am I, and what am I doing in this field?&#x27; And just got back in the van, not knowing who I was.&quot; He requested to cease touring, but was opposed by Virgin, his bandmates and the band&#x27;s management. On 2 June 1981, XTC performed their last ever British date, in Cardiff. In 1982, &quot;Respectable Street&quot; was the only song they performed at a televised gig simulcast in Paris, which became one of the last live performances of their career. Partridge experienced a panic attack mid-performance and walked off the stage.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporary===
&quot;Black Sea&quot; received critical acclaim. An unnamed &quot;Billboard&quot; reviewer deemed the album &quot;consistently appealing and more accessible than [&quot;Drums and Wires&quot;]. The vocals of Andy Partridge and Colin Moulding have an attractive breeziness and the instrumentation is tight.&quot; In &quot;Musician&quot;, Roy Trakin wrote of XTC as among &quot;the new English art rock&quot; and praised &quot;Black Sea&quot;″s successful fusion of &quot;Partridge&#x27;s love of rhythm and Moulding&#x27;s affinity for melody ... Songs like &#x27;Towers of London&#x27; and &#x27;Burning With Optimism&#x27;s Flames&#x27; show the two approaches finally achieving a seamless synthesis.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Don Shewey of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; found &quot;Black Sea&quot; to be overall consistent—with the exception of &quot;Travels in Nihilon&quot;, which he wrote &quot;strays from the intersection of punk and pop where XTC are most at home&quot;. Jeff Tamarkin of &quot;CMJ New Music Report&quot; described the album as a refinement on &quot;Drums and Wires&quot; with &quot;superb production, musicianship and writing&quot;, although he expressed disappointment towards the lack of Moulding songs. He predicted the band would &quot;find itself with an even wider audience, because there&#x27;s plenty here to satisfy even the most timid radio programmer and borderline rock dance club DJ.&quot;

According to biographer Chris Twomey, detractors of the record thought that its &quot;complex musical nuts and bolts [were] too arty or too clever for their own good.&quot; Michael Kremen of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; reviewed that the songs &quot;no longer sound fresh. I hear too many bits and pieces from their previous records as well as a lots of White Album and Abbey Road-era Beatles stuff. Perhaps, having influenced lots of bands over the last three years, that which once seemed unique in XTC is now fairly common.&quot;

===Retrospective===
The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s Greg Kot said the album marked &quot;the end of an era with an exclamation point. From here on out, the band`s writing would become even more complex and personalized.&quot; AllMusic&#x27;s Chris Woodstra called it XTC&#x27;s most consistent album yet, both in terms of its full arrangements and unsubtle political commentary. Oregano Rathbone of &quot;Record Collector&quot; wrote that &quot;Black Sea&quot; was arguably &quot;the sweet spot in XTC&#x27;s imperial phase as a perma-touring four-piece experimental pop group.&quot; David Sinclair, in an overview of XTC&#x27;s early albums for &quot;Q&quot;, determined that the arrangements of &quot;Black Sea&quot;, while complex, were much cleaner than earlier arrangements, such as those found on their debut, &quot;White Music&quot;. In 1996, critic Jack Rabid praised the &quot;sardonic crack&quot; of &quot;Respectable Street&quot; and wrote &quot;am I the only one who&#x27;s noticed that super-fans Blur have ripped this song off three times already???!!!!&quot;

Writing for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Chris Dahlen highlights &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; (&quot;... will never vacate your brain&quot;), &quot;Rocket From a Bottle&quot; (&quot;one of their most jet-fueled songs&quot;), and &quot;Travels in Nihilon&quot; (&quot;one of their strangest&quot;). He also appreciated the placement of the bonus tracks on the 2001 CD reissue, following the original track listing of the album. Previous reissues placed the tracks in the middle of the album, interrupting the &quot;flow&quot;. Robert Christgau was impressed by the album&#x27;s pacing and eclecticism, despite delving into excessively &quot;embellishing herkyjerk whozis&quot; and over-intellect.

<text>Castle Hill is a heritage-listed isolated pink granite monolith in the suburb of Castle Hill, City of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Its Indigenous name is Cootharinga, sometimes written as Cooderinga.

It rises to a height of some above sea level and dominates the city skyline. It is one of the most distinctive natural features on the Queensland coast. There are a number of vantage points from which to view the city below and also across Cleveland Bay to nearby Magnetic Island. Castle Hill (as a hill) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register in 1993.

==Geography and features==
The hill is an inselberg of Carboniferous–Permian origins, rising abruptly from the younger Quaternary coastal plain. The surface is primarily bare rock or shallow lithosols with small areas of duplex soils. There are three peaks to the summit. There is a former quarry site on the southern slopes, accessed via Stagpole Street, and on the northern cliff face a large graffiti of &#x27;The Saint&#x27; is painted.

The bitumen &quot;Castle Hill Road&quot; winds for from the northeast slopes to the summit of the second peak, on which the Hynes Lookout platform has been erected.

There are several buildings and installations on the hill. On the southern face was a two-storeyed octagonal building of concrete block work, which formerly housed the Panorama Restaurant, which has now been demolished. A carpark associated with the former restaurant is located nearby to the north. Other structures on the site include several water reservoirs and three radio communication installations. On the northernmost peak of the summit is a 1942 observation post, a low, square, concrete bunker with observation apertures.

===Robert Towns monument===

In 1873, Robert Towns, the founder of Townsville, died in Sydney and was buried in Balmain Cemetery.

In 1940, the Municipality of Leichhardt decided to replace that cemetery with parkland (called Pioneers Memorial Park). The plans were advertised and families were invited to arrange for re-interment of bodies or removal of memorials. In 1941, the Leichhardt Council offered the memorial from the grave of Robert Towns to the Townsville City Council. In January 1942, Townsville City Council voted to accept the memorial and transport it to Townsville at a cost of . The decision to accept the monument was opposed by two councillors, one claiming that Robert Towns had done nothing for Townsville and it was only sheer good luck that caused the city to bear his name. A local resident, Tom Gleeson, proposed &quot;high on the peak of Castle Hill, overlooking the harbour&quot; would be a suitable location for the monument. Having arrived in Townsville, the monument was then placed in storage for a number of years.

It was not until October 1947 that the Council discussed where to place the monument. A number of locations were considered: Castle Hill, the Botanic Gardens, in front of the Queens Hotel, the Anzac Memorial Park and the Railway Oval, but Castle Hill was ultimately the council&#x27;s choice. In February 1948, the Queensland Government gave its approval to the council to place the monument in the centre of the car parking area on the top of Castle Hill.

Over two years later, in November 1949, the monument was finally placed on Castle Hill, where it stands to the present day. A plaque was added to explain the origins of the monument.

==Flora==
The vegetation, largely regenerative, is dominated by indigenous plant species. Approximately 300 plant species have been identified. Of particular importance are:

*Sarcochilus ceciliae (Orchidaceae), for which Castle Hill is the type locality, first described by renowned German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller in 1865;
* Aristida sp. nov. (Poaceae)
* Arthragrostis sp. nov. (Poaceae), both endemic to Castle Hill and currently being examined for description as new species; and Trodia stenostachya (Poaceae), a hummock grass community which represents an unusual coastal occurrence of this more typically inland spinifex.

The plant communities are predominantly mixed Eucalyptus spp. (E. drepaniphylla, E. dolichocarpa, E. tessellaris, E. Platyphylla, E. papuana) with variable woody understorey. Small areas of semi-evergreen notophyll vine thickets, not native to the site, occur in mesic areas such as gullies. On the gentler slopes kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra) is the dominant herbaceous species, while giant spear grass (Heteropogon triticeus) dominates on the steeper slopes. Specialised flora also occur on the cliffs and rocky outcrops, in particular the Triodia hummock grass community, Ficus spp. (five species) and orchids (two species). Introduced flora comprised almost 50 species, including Ficus benghalensis (Banyan).

==Fauna==
The fauna, which has not been surveyed comprehensively, includes the unadorned rock-wallaby. The avifauna had been surveyed, with over 50 bird species either visiting or residing on the hill. Peregrine falcons and brahminy kites nest here. Echidna, death adder and quail have been seen.

==Activities==

Many locals walk up Castle Hill for regular exercise. There are many different routes to the top, by road or by &quot;goat track&quot;. The Goat Track is a rough path that consists of 758 individual stairs from start to finish. Castle Hill is also a popular tourist site. Education groups regularly using the reserve to study natural environments, community history and urban geography. The North Queensland Conservation Council is undertaking a voluntary bush rejuvenation program of the site.

==History==

===Early records and creation of a Reserve===
Castle Hill has formerly also been known locally as Cutheringa, Cudtheringa, Cootharinga, and Mt Cutheringa. The Aboriginal history associated with Cutheringa has not been recorded, but its name survives as one of only two known Australian Indigenous place names in the Townsville region, the other being Pallarenda.

Castle Hill was one of the earliest sites named by Andrew Ball who, together with MW Reid, were the first Europeans to explore the Ross River area in April 1864. The settlement established here was known initially as Castletown, until the name was replaced by Townsville in 1865. The hill became a much admired local landmark, evoking aesthetic delight and a unique sense of identity. This prominent link between urban life and nature largely determined the disordered layout of Townsville&#x27;s streets and in the late 19th century was frequented for recreational pursuits such as botanising and nature study. Townsville residents also illegally plundered timber and firewood from Castle Hill. Wild goats further ravaged the native vegetation. By the late 1880s the Townsville Herald (1822–97) voiced considerable public outrage at the continued denudation of Castle Hill. These concerns were part of Queensland-wide debates on forest resource use and conservation. In an innovative approach to conservation, the Townsville Municipal Council applied to the Crown to establish the Hill as a reserve under their protective trusteeship, and on 30 June, Castle Hill was gazetted a Recreation Reserve of . However, despite the appointment of Crown Land Rangers and later, a Conservator of Trees for Castle Hill, the council was able to do little to restore the tree cover of the reserve during the depression years of the 1890s. Alderman Edward Downs and EJ Banfield privately planted various trees through the 1890s, including the surviving banyans, but by the 20th century, popular interest in preserving the natural vegetation of Castle Hill had waned. Small areas of the reserve were excised in the 1890s for water reserves and quarrying, but by 1900 it remained an unimproved reserve of close to .

Only into the 1930s did the Council appear to directly address the Castle Hill environment. The goats were removed, permitting natural revegetation and in 1935-36 a road to the summit was constructed as an employment generating scheme, partly funded by the Main Roads Commission. Hynes Road (now Castle Hill Road) and Lookout were named after the then Minister for Labour and Industry, Hon. MP Maurice Hynes.

===World War II===
During the Second World War Castle Hill was used as a communications and observation post. Infantry and field regiments of the 5th Australian Division were deployed on the hill, and the observation post they constructed remains. In 1942 a radar station was established on the summit, and searchlights extended halfway up the hill. The road up Castle Hill was closed to traffic on 12 March 1942 to enable the construction of the above-ground Green Street Bunker near Sidney Street, West End. Unconfirmed reports indicate approval was given for the construction of an underground Area Combined Headquarters in Castle Hill in 1943.

===Development===
Since the 1950s areas from within the recreation reserve, including the summit, were excised for a variety of purposes: further water reserves and quarrying, a restaurant, car parking, communications installations and residential subdivision. By 1972 the Recreation Reserve had been reduced to about . Since 1974 radio communications installations erected at the summit have serviced the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, ambulance, fire brigade, police, state emergency services and customs.

In 1983 a further were granted to Yarrawonga Pty Ltd under special lease as a potential development site. The Yarrawonga subdivision is situated in the foothills of Castle Hill. With views of North Ward and Magnetic Island; it has been described as the most expensive real estate outside south-east Queensland and is noted for its elevation and large homes, precariously placed on the foothills. 

There have been at least two attempts to raise the height of Castle Hill so that it would qualify as a mountain.

<doc id="926811" wikidata="Q3950707" url="?curid=926811" title="Duke Island (Alaska)">
<text>Duke Island () is an island in the Gravina Islands of the Alexander Archipelago in the southeastern part of the U.S. state of Alaska and within Tongass National Forest. The island is just north of the Canada–United States border, about south of Ketchikan and about northwest of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. It is about long east–west and north-south.

The original name for the island in the Tlingit language is: &quot;Yeixhi&quot; (building), referring to it looking like something under construction when viewed from the waters around it.

The island was named by William Healey Dall in 1879. He probably took the name from the island&#x27;s southern cape, which George Vancouver had named in 1793 after the Duke of Northumberland.

Duke Island is a roadless area of Tongass National Forest under the Alaska Roadless Rule. The Duke Island Roadless Area consists of Duke Island, Mary Island, and the Percy Islands.

Duke Island hosts an Alaskan-type ultramafic complex which as of 2010 was being explored for magmatic sulfide Cu-Ni-PGE deposits.

Duke Island is an important and ancient indigenous location, with numerous archaeological sites dating back at least several thousand years. The Taantakwaan (&quot;Taantʼa Ḵwáan&quot;) Tlingit (&quot;Tongass people&quot;), Sanyakwaan (&quot;Saanyaa Ḵwáan&quot;) Tlingit, and the Tsimshian people of Metlakatla all consider Duke Island to be a very sacred place and an integral part of their history and contemporary life. Additionally, Duke Island is where the Taantakwaan had their first contacts with Westerners who came as maritime fur traders. After extensive mineral exploration for anomalous copper, nickel, platinum, and palladium began in 2005 the Taantakwaan Tlingit, along with the Native Site Guardianship Council and the Ketchikan Indian Community (KIC) objected and began the process of designating the island, along with others nearby, a traditional cultural property (TCP). A determination of eligibility for TCP began in 2009. The study concluded that the Duke Island Area is eligible to the National Register of Historic Places as a TCP. On 9 June 2011 the State Historic Preservation Office concurred that the Duke Island Area is eligible under all criteria.

In 2020 the Trump administration announced a new Roadless Rule that exempted Tongass National Forest, including Duke Island, from the Alaska Roadless Rule. In 2023, after study and review that began in 2021, the Biden administration repealed the 2020 Trump administration&#x27;s Roadless Rule, returning to the 2001 Clinton-era Roadless Rule. This resulted in Duke Island once again being a designated roadless area of Tongass National Forest.

<text>The Vecht () is a Rhine branch in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is sometimes called Utrechtse Vecht to avoid confusion with its Overijssel counterpart. The area along the river is called the Vechtstreek.

==Geography==
The Vecht originates from the city of Utrecht, where the Kromme Rijn stream forks into two branches: the Leidse Rijn/Oude Rijn branch to the west and the Vecht to the north. Originally the Vecht branched off south of the city near the Roman fort Fectio, flowing eastwards around the city, but in the 12th century a northern shortcut was dug out.

The Vecht meanders north past the towns and villages of Maarssen, Breukelen and Nigtevecht, crosses the border into the province of North Holland, passes the city of Weesp and discharges into the IJmeer (Lake IJ, part of the former Zuiderzee) at Muiden. The Amsterdam-Rijnkanaal (Amsterdam-Rhine Canal) was dug in the Vecht basin.

The Roman historian Tacitus tells us that in the first century CE a Roman fleet sailed due north down a Rhine branch, then sailed past Lake Flevo (now the Markermeer and IJsselmeer lakes) into the North Sea. This could have been the IJssel, which the Romans connected to the Rhine themselves, or the river Vecht.

In the 17th and 18th centuries many country estates, known as buitenplaatsen, were built on the banks of the Vecht by rich merchants and administrators from Amsterdam.

<doc id="926818" wikidata="Q1570283" url="?curid=926818" title="Mayne Island">
<text>Mayne Island is a island in the southern Gulf Islands chain of British Columbia. It is midway between the Lower Mainland of BC and Vancouver Island, and has a population of over 1300. Mount Parke in the south-central heart of the island is its highest peak at 255 metres (837 feet).

==History==
Mayne Island was inhabited by members of the Tsartlip First Nation prior to European colonization. Several middens are present on the island, along with period articles – most notably including a stone bowl which was stolen in 1982 and again, in 2007.

In 1794 Captain George Vancouver camped on Georgina Point where his crew left a coin and a knife found over a century later by early settlers.

In 1857 Captain George Richards of the Royal Navy surveyed the area as captain of the Royal Navy vessel HMS &quot;Plumper&quot;, naming the island after his Lieutenant Richard Charles Mayne, son of the first commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police. His journals concerning his explorations of British Columbia are important sources for early British Columbia history, as are those of his colleague in many of those explorations, Royal Engineer Lieutenant Henry Spencer Palmer.

During the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858-1860 and after, Vancouver Island miners gathered on Mayne Island before rowing across Georgia Strait to the mainland of BC in search of their fortunes. The earliest homesteaders registered land claims in the Miners Bay area in 1859.

During the late 19th century, Mayne Island was the commercial and social centre of the Gulf Islands. The port at Miners Bay was always busy due to the steady stream of marine traffic travelling through Active Pass, the narrow, curving strait separating Mayne from Galiano Island to the north, which is the main ferry route between the Mainland and Vancouver Island today. The historic village at Miners Bay remains the commercial centre of the island, with the annual Fall Fair still being held at the old Agricultural Hall like so many years before. Miners Bay is also the site of the Springwater Lodge which was built in 1892 and remains the oldest continuously operated hotel in British Columbia. Nearby Active Pass still throbs with a steady stream of marine traffic, a bustling contrast to the island&#x27;s quiet interior byways. Village Bay, with its BC Ferries terminal, has several late 19th-century to 1930s buildings. Active Pass is named after the American survey ship USCS &quot;Active&quot;, the first steam vessel to navigate the pass.

The Japanese-Canadian community on Mayne Island played a historical role in the island&#x27;s economics and society from the turn of the 20th century until World War II. The community had close ties to the European-Canadian population throughout the Gulf Islands and was involved in major economic initiatives such as greenhouse farming. In 1942 the Japanese Canadians living on Mayne Island were interned by the government and resettled in various internment camps such as New Denver or moved to Southern Alberta to work in the sugar beet fields. These restrictions on where the Japanese Canadians from the coast could live continued until well after the end of World War II, only ending in April 1949 with the rescinding of the last restrictions on Japanese Canadian movement and the provision of full citizenship rights to all Japanese Canadians. All of the Japanese Canadian properties, including their homes, land and fishing boats were confiscated by the BC Security Commission, initially in trust for their owners, but later sold without the permission of their owners. As a consequence, almost all of the families would never return to the island after the loss of their land, possessions and their community. Today, the Japanese Gardens, near Dinner Bay, are dedicated to the memory and legacy of the Mayne Island&#x27;s Japanese-Canadian community.

The Mayne Island community holds a Farmers&#x27; Market every Saturday morning throughout the summer months. Islanders sell their local produce, handicrafts, baked goods, and art work.

==Transportation==

BC Ferries operates a vehicle and passenger scheduled ferry service from Tsawwassen (Vancouver) on the mainland and Swartz Bay (Victoria) on Vancouver Island as well as to the other major southern Gulf Islands. SeaAir Seaplanes operates a scheduled float plane service calling at Mayne Island from Vancouver downtown and the airport. Hitchhiking is common on the island in the summer and dedicated &quot;car stops&quot; for pick-ups are located along the major roadways.

==Climate==

The warmest month is August, the coldest month is December.


==Parks and beaches==
*Gulf Islands National Park Reserve offers opportunities for boating, kayaking, hiking, wildlife viewing and picnicking. There is an easy loop trail at Bennett Bay that leads to Campbell Point. Campbell Point features remnant old-growth forest and views of Georgeson Island. Bennett Bay has a sandy beach which is suitable for sunbathing and swimming. Georgina Point is the location of a historic lighthouse. Built in 1885, the Georgina Point lighthouse marks the entrance to Active Pass. Orca whales, harbour seals and seabirds can all be seen at Georgina Point.

<text>Gravina Island is an island in the Gravina Islands of the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska. It is long and about wide, with a land area of . The island had a population of 50 people at the 2000 census.

The Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño named the Gravina Islands group in 1792. George Vancouver applied the name to Gravina Island itself in 1793. The name honors Federico Carlos Gravina y Nápoli which was originated in the town of Gravina in Puglia, Italy.

Ketchikan International Airport is located on Gravina Island across the Tongass Narrows (½ mile) from Ketchikan and is reached by a ferry service which takes between three and seven minutes and runs at least every half-hour. A bridge to the island was first proposed in 2002. Its high cost, combined with the island&#x27;s low population, resulted in critics calling it the bridge to nowhere. The U.S. Congress slashed funding in 2005, and permanently cancelled the project in 2015.

==Demographics==

Gravina Island first appeared on the 1940 U.S. Census as an unincorporated area. This was the only time it appeared on the census as a separate community.

==Flora and fauna==

A variety of wildlife and vegetation are found on Gravina Island including a disjunctive population of the Crater Lake Newt, a subspecies of the Rough-skinned Newt, whose northern range is in Alaska.

==Proposed bridge==
In 2002, it was proposed that a for-profit prison corporation, Cornell Corrections, build a prison on the island. To connect the island with Ketchikan, it was originally planned that the federal government spend $175 million on building a bridge to the island, and another $75 million to connect it to the power grid with an electrical intertie. The Ketchikan Borough Assembly turned the proposal down when the administration of Governor Tony Knowles also expressed its disfavor to the idea. Eventually, the corporation&#x27;s prison plans led to the exposure of the wide-ranging Alaska political corruption probe, which eventually ensnared U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. The bridge idea persisted. The 2005 Highway Bill provided for $223 million to build the Gravina Island Bridge between Gravina Island and nearby Ketchikan, on Revillagigedo Island. The provisions and earmarks were negotiated by Alaska&#x27;s Rep. Don Young, who chaired the House Transportation Committee and were supported by the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Alaska&#x27;s Senator Stevens. This bridge, nicknamed &quot;The Bridge to Nowhere&quot; by critics, was intended to replace the auto ferry which is currently the only connection between Ketchikan and its airport. While the federal earmark was withdrawn after meeting opposition from Oklahoma Senator Tom Coburn, though the state of Alaska received $300 million in transportation funding, the state of Alaska continued to study improvements in access to the airport, which could conceivably include improvements to the ferry service. Despite the demise of the bridge proposal, Governor Sarah Palin spent $26 million in transportation funding for the planned access road on Gravina Island that ultimately had little use.

<doc id="926837" wikidata="Q4999148" url="?curid=926837" title="Burley (tobacco)">
<text>Burley tobacco is a light, air-cured tobacco used primarily for cigarette production. In the United States, it is produced in an eight-state belt, with about 70% produced in Kentucky. Tennessee produces around 20%, with smaller amounts produced in Indiana, North Carolina, Missouri, Ohio, Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Burley tobacco is produced in many other countries, with major production in Brazil, Malawi, and Argentina.

==History==


The origin of white burley tobacco was credited to George Webb and Joseph Fore in 1864, who grew it on the farm of Captain Frederick Kautz near Higginsport, Ohio, from seed from Bracken County, Kentucky. He noticed it yielded a different type of light leaf shaded from white to yellow, and cured differently. By 1866, he had harvested 20,000 pounds of burley tobacco and sold it in 1867 at the St. Louis Fair for $58 per hundred pounds. By 1883, Cincinnati had become the principal market for this tobacco, and it was grown throughout central Kentucky and Middle Tennessee. In 1880, Kentucky accounted for 36% of the total national tobacco production, and was first in the country, with nearly twice as much tobacco produced as by Virginia, then the second-place state. Later, the type became referred to as burley tobacco, which is air-cured.

== Cultivation &amp; processing ==
In the U.S., burley tobacco plants are started from pelletized seeds placed in polystyrene trays floated on a bed of fertilized water in March or April. Transplanting begins in May and progresses through June with a small percentage set in July. Producers must contend with major diseases, such as black shank and blue mold, and insects including aphids, tobacco hornworms, and budworms. Plants are topped by removing the developing flower head roughly 60 days from transplanting, and treated to prevent the growth of side shoots called suckers. Topping allows energy that would have produced a bloom to promote leaf expansion.

Many of the benefits in topping at the appropriate bloom stage and leaf number are lost if suckers are not controlled. Suckers grow vigorously immediately after topping and can severely reduce yield and quality if not effectively controlled. Some varieties, such as &#x27;KY 14xL8&#x27; and &#x27;Narrowleaf Madole&#x27;, are known to have more rapid sucker growth than other varieties and may require more aggressive sucker-control strategies. Three types of chemicals are available for controlling sucker growth on tobacco.

About four weeks after topping, the tobacco is stalk-cut, using a knife that is shaped like a tomahawk. Each plant is speared, spiked, or spudded (the terminology depending on the geographic location) onto a stick topped by a metal spear, spike, or spud that fits over the stick. Each stick contains five or six stalks.

Sticks of green-cut tobacco are most often allowed to field-wilt for three or four days prior to hanging in a barn. Tobacco is allowed to air-cure for eight or more weeks, turning from the normal pale green to yellow and then to brown. Burley that cures too quickly can retain some of the yellow pigments, as well as chemicals that normally break down with a slower cure. The quality achieved by U.S. burley producers is primarily due to natural curing conditions. Once fully cured burley is taken down, sticks are removed and leaves are stripped from the plant into grades by stalk position. Leaves are baled by grade and taken to a receiving station run by a tobacco manufacturer or leaf dealer.

==Sweetening==

Burley contains little sugar, and has generally been cased (sweetened) with humectants, sugars, or other flavors for uses such as in American-blend cigarettes. As a result, a broad ban enacted by Canada and proposed in many other countries would block the import of nearly all tobacco products containing burley. The situation resembles a dispute between Asian producers and the United States, which banned clove cigarettes. For each nation, banning components typical of tobacco manufactured abroad provides a powerful trade advantage, but may be prohibited by WTO (formerly, GATT) trade agreements. The effect on American producers is limited, but not negligible, as most Canadian imports were already of flue-cured Virginia tobacco.

<text>Mikontalo is a large student housing complex in Hervanta, Tampere, Finland. Its exact address is Insinöörinkatu 60, 33720 Tampere, Finland.

With affordable rents, easy availability, and location near the Hervanta campus of Tampere University, it is a popular dwelling for first year students and exchange students.

Mikontalo was built during the period 1978–1980. Representing brutalism, it consists of 4 blocks with 12 floors where 767 dwellings are situated. Mikontalo offers for its inhabitants saunas (two per building), a free gym, public lounge with a TV-set, Nintendo Wii, Soundsystem, board games, coffee machine and microwave; laundry room (5 washing and 2 drying machines), cable TV, and connection to the Internet.

The building went through major renovations from Summer 2007 until Summer 2009. During the renovation juliet balconies were added to some of the apartments. Also the façade panels were painted with bluish grey color, replacing red, orange and yellow colors.

==Mikontalo Lights==

In early December 2007, the D block of Mikontalo, while undergoing the reconstruction, was the scene of the Mikontalolights project.

The object of Mikontalolights project was to create the world&#x27;s physically largest colored graphics platform by using the windows of Mikontalo&#x27;s D block as light pixels. The platform was used for playing Tetris and other games and present demos created by the students of Tampere University of Technology. The project climaxed on December 4 when the new lights of the building were lit. The goal was to gain global visibility for Tampere University of Technology and the rich student culture of city of Tampere.

Mikontalolights was a part of the 42nd jubilee year of the Student Union of Tampere University of Technology. Mikontalolights was fully carried out by students who were willing to give their work contribution besides their studies. TOAS and the building contractor of Mikontalo Rakennustoimisto Palmberg Oy made it possible to accomplish Mikontalolights by providing Mikontalo as a platform for the project.

<doc id="926840" wikidata="Q7885135" url="?curid=926840" title="Uniformity of motive">
<text>In astrobiology, uniformity of motive is an essential assumption of the zoo hypothesis explanation to Fermi&#x27;s paradox. The zoo hypothesis states that alien civilizations refrain from contacting Earth, so as to not interfere in natural evolution and cultural development, or to minimize risk for themselves. Certain technological, political or ethical thresholds and standards could be implemented for other civilizations to pass, after which contact would be established. 

In the likely case that more than one sufficiently developed alien civilizations exist, a uniformity of motive with legal policy concerning the contact of newly developing civilizations would have to be established and maintained. A &quot;galactic club&quot; would be formed and maintained, possibly by an early advanced civilization. The size of a club like this would influence the likelihood of compliance by all members, since any member could break the contact rules at any point in time, making large galactic clubs unlikely to succeed in their goals.

== Plausibility of the assumption ==
The concept of Uniformity of Motive is not a widely researched topic, as it would only resolve Fermi&#x27;s paradox when all extraterrestrial civilizations would abide by the rule to not contact ‘lesser developed’ civilizations, such as Earth. Additionally, the Uniformity of Motive is purely based on assumptions and is therefore a hard hypothesis to scientifically confirm or reject. 

Thomas Hair (2011) researches the idea that, given that Earth is a relatively young planet, older extraterrestrial civilizations would likely follow the lead of an even older civilization - the first civilization to come up with a Uniformity of Motive (as originally proposed by Ronald Bracewell). He calculates using Monte Carlo simulations that there would be an enormous time gap between the first civilization and the emergence of Earth, During that time span, a first civilization could spread its rule throughout the galaxy. Still, the uniformity of motive is a difficult galactic rule to uphold when most extraterrestrial civilizations are scattered over thousands of light years, restricted by natural speed laws. Due to the number of civilizations that could be present in our galaxy, the assumption of a uniformity of motive would be arguable, proposes Duncan Forgan. Forgan reconsiders this idea that the galaxy would be rather made up of Galactic Cliques with similarly evolved cultural norms than one big Galactic Club.

== Convergent cultural evolution ==
Convergent cultural evolution could explain the emergence of uniform motives in a possible Galactic Club. This convergence on a certain set of cultural norms and ethics might be a necessary condition for civilizations to reach sufficient developmental stages for space exploration and communication, since the environmental pressures of intergalactic travel and communication are similar for all alien civilizations. Under this assumption, the concept of a Galactic Club with Uniformity of Motive would gain plausibility. 

== Earth law on extraterrestrial contact ==
Space can be explored and used freely by all United Nations States according to the Outer Space Treaty from 1967. However, the United Nations have no specific laws on initiating contact with other extraterrestrial civilizations, apart from three important principles to follow when doing so (as quoted from the source):
# The decision on whether or not to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence should be made by an appropriate international body, broadly representative of Humankind.
# If a decision is made to send a message to extraterrestrial intelligence, it should be sent on behalf of all Humankind, rather than from individual States or groups.
# The content of such a message should be developed through an appropriate international process, reflecting a broad consensus.
There have been multiple attempts to contact alien civilizations, of which the most notable examples are the Voyager probes. 

The International Academy of Astronautics has prepared a SETI detection protocol to follow that is in accordance with all International Space Law of the United Nations. The detection of possible alien life should first be validated. If the detection appears to be real, then the discoverer should seek contact with the national authorities and other research organizations so they can conduct independent research on the observations. The United Nations and consequently the public will be contacted after.

<text>Robustness is the property of being strong and healthy in constitution. When it is transposed into a system, it refers to the ability of tolerating perturbations that might affect the system&#x27;s functional body. In the same line &quot;robustness&quot; can be defined as &quot;the ability of a system to resist change without adapting its initial stable configuration&quot;. 
&quot;Robustness in the small&quot; refers to situations wherein perturbations are small in magnitude, which considers that the &quot;small&quot; magnitude hypothesis can be difficult to verify because &quot;small&quot; or &quot;large&quot; depends on the specific problem. Conversely, &quot;Robustness in the large problem&quot; refers to situations wherein no assumptions can be made about the magnitude of perturbations, which can either be small or large.
It has been discussed that robustness has two dimensions: resistance and avoidance.

<text>Jostedal Glacier or is the largest glacier in continental Europe. It is in Vestland county in Western Norway. Jostedalsbreen lies in the municipalities of Luster, Sogndal, Sunnfjord, and Stryn. The highest peak in the area is Lodalskåpa at a height of .

==History==
In 1906, work was being done on footpaths that could accommodate tourists.

The glacial water is also used in distilling Vikingfjord

==Geography==
The Jostedal Glacier has a total area of . The highest point is Høgste Breakulen at above mean sea level. Branches of the glacier reach down into the valleys, for instance Bøyabreen in Fjærland and Nigardsbreen, both at above sea level. The thickest part of the glacier is . Jostedalsbreen has a length of a little more than and it is a part of the Jostedalsbreen National Park, which was established in 1991. The glacier covers over half of the national park.

The glacier is maintained by the high snowfall rates in the region, not the cold temperatures. This means the glacier has high melting rates in its snouts. The Jostedalsbreen has around 50 glacier arms such as the Nigardsbreen and Tunsbergdalsbreen in Jostedal, the Briksdalsbreen near Olden, the Bøyabreen by Fjærland, the Kjenndalsbreen, Tindefjellbreen near Loen, and Austerdalsbreen.
In 2012, the glacier arm Briksdalsbreen lost of ice in a few months. More recent measurements now show that Briksdalsbreen retreated in 2006, and could be in danger of breaking away from the upper icefield. Ice climbing has now been terminated because of this event.

<doc id="926859" wikidata="Q2555929" url="?curid=926859" title="Donna Pescow">
<text>Donna Gail Pescow (born March 24, 1954) is an American film and television actress and director. She is known for her roles as Annette in the 1977 film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, Angie Falco-Benson in the 1979–1980 sitcom &quot;Angie&quot;, Donna Garland in the sitcom &quot;Out of This World&quot; and Eileen Stevens in the Disney Channel sitcom &quot;Even Stevens&quot;.

==Early life==
Pescow was born in Brooklyn, New York, on March 24, 1954, into a Jewish family. Her father Marty owned and ran a newsstand in downtown Manhattan at 17 Battery Place. Pescow attended Sheepshead Bay High School in Brooklyn and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Around 1973, she had a leading role in an Off-off Broadway musical entitled &quot;Poor Old Fool&quot;, though it closed after just a few weeks.

==Career==
In 1977, Pescow played Annette in the John Travolta film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. To prepare for the role, she had to relearn her Brooklyn accent, which she had significantly reduced for professional reasons. For this role, she was the New York Film Critics&#x27; third-place choice for their award for Best Supporting Actress.

Also in 1977, Pescow joined the cast of the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;, portraying Celena Arquette. The role proved to be brief, lasting less than a year, but it helped to launch her television career, including roles on two other ABC soap operas in later years.

In 1978, Pescow portrayed one of Judy Garland&#x27;s older sisters in the television biographical film &quot;Rainbow&quot;, directed by Jackie Cooper.

She appeared as a celebrity panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; in 1978.

Pescow starred in her own television series, &quot;Angie&quot;, which ran for two seasons from 1979 to 1980 on ABC. Her primary castmates were Robert Hays, Debralee Scott, and fellow New Yorker Doris Roberts.

In 1982, Pescow was cast in the role of Dr. Lynn Carson, the first lesbian on a daytime serial, on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;, which she played until 1983. After her run on &quot;All My Children&quot; ended, Pescow landed the role of Donna Garland in the first-run syndication children&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Out of This World&quot; in 1987, starring with Maureen Flannigan and Joe Alaskey. She stayed with the show until its cancellation in 1991.

After &quot;Out of This World&quot; ended, Pescow went on to a series of smaller roles before returning to prominent television roles. She made guest appearances on the shows &quot;Clueless&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, &quot;Pauly&quot; and &quot;Ivory Tower&quot;, and in the 1998 television film &quot;Dead Husbands&quot;.

Pescow appeared on the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1999 to 2001 as the villainous Gertrude Morgan, the evil aunt of Chloe Morgan (Tava Smiley). In 2001, Smiley was released from her &quot;General Hospital&quot; contract and Pescow&#x27;s character was written out. During her run on &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Pescow also had a small role in the television film &quot;Partners&quot; and guest starred on the television series &quot;Philly&quot;.

In 1999, Disney contacted Pescow about appearing in a half-hour youth sitcom for the network. A pilot was filmed in 2000, and the series went on to become &quot;Even Stevens&quot;. It aired for three seasons on Disney Channel, from 2000 to 2003. She also directed three episodes of the series, which became a flagship for the network. After the series ended in 2003, Pescow and the rest of the cast returned for the finale film &quot;The Even Stevens Movie&quot;.

After taking several years off following &quot;Even Stevens&quot;, Pescow appeared in the film &quot;One Sung Hero&quot; alongside Nicole Sullivan. She then took another brief break from acting, but she did appear in a 2006 episode of &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;. In 2007, Pescow appeared in the series finale of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as Donna Parisi, the wife of mobster Patsy Parisi.

In 2023, Pescow made a cameo appearance alongside John Travolta in a Capital One Christmas ad, as the cashier in a shoe store that Santa (Travolta) visits.

<text>Blue cheese is any cheese made with the addition of cultures of edible molds, which create blue-green spots or veins through the cheese. Blue cheeses vary in flavor from mild to strong and from slightly sweet to salty or sharp; in colour from pale to dark; and in consistency from liquid to hard. They may have a distinctive smell, either from the mold or from various specially cultivated bacteria such as &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot;.

Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. Blue cheeses are typically aged in temperature-controlled environments.

== History ==
Blue cheese is believed to have been discovered by accident when cheeses were stored in caves with naturally controlled temperature and moisture levels which happened to be favorable environments for varieties of harmless mold. Analysis of paleofeces sampled in the salt mines of Hallstatt, Austria showed that miners of the Hallstatt Period (800 to 400 BC) already consumed blue cheese and beer.

According to legend, one of the first blue cheeses, Roquefort, was discovered when a young boy, eating bread and ewes&#x27; milk cheese, abandoned his meal in a nearby cave after seeing a beautiful girl in the distance. When he returned months later, the mold (&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;) had transformed his cheese into Roquefort. Gorgonzola is one of the oldest known blue cheeses, having been created around AD 879, though it is said that it did not contain blue veins until around the 11th century. Stilton is a relatively new addition, becoming popular sometime in the early 1700s. Many varieties of blue cheese originated subsequently, such as the 20th century Danablu and Cambozola, were an attempt to fill the demand for Roquefort-style cheeses.

== Production ==
Similarly to other varieties of cheese, the process of making blue cheese consists of six standard steps. However, additional ingredients and processes are required to give this blue-veined cheese its particular properties. To begin with, the commercial scale production of blue cheese consists of two phases: the culturing of suitable spore-rich inocula and fermentation for maximum, typical flavor.

=== &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; inoculum ===

In the first phase of production, a &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; inoculum is prepared prior to the actual production of blue cheese. Multiple methods can be used to achieve this. However, all methods involve the use of a freeze-dried &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; culture. Although &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; can be found naturally, cheese producers nowadays use commercially manufactured &quot;Penicillium roqueforti.&quot; First, &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; is washed from a pure culture agar plates which is later frozen. Through the freeze drying process, water from the frozen state is evaporated without the transition through the liquid state (sublimation). This retains the value of the culture and is activated upon the addition of water.

Salt, sugar or both are added to autoclaved, homogenized milk via a sterile solution. This mixture is then inoculated with &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;. This solution is first incubated for three to four days at . More salt and/or sugar is added and then aerobic incubation is continued for an additional one to two days. Alternatively, sterilized, homogenized milk and reconstituted non-fat solids or whey solids are mixed with sterile salt to create a fermentation medium. A spore-rich &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; culture is then added. Next, modified milk fat is added which consists of milk fat with calf pre-gastric esterase. This solution is prepared in advance by an enzyme hydrolysis of a milk fat emulsion. The addition of modified milk fat stimulates a progressive release of free fatty acids via lipase action which is essential for rapid flavor development in blue cheese. This inoculum produced by either methods is later added to the cheese curds.

=== Production and fermentation ===
First, raw milk (either from cattle, goats or sheep) is mixed and pasteurized at for 15 seconds. Then, acidification occurs: a starter culture, such as &quot;Streptococcus lactis,&quot; is added in order to change lactose to lactic acid, thus changing the acidity of the milk and turning it from liquid to solid. The next step is coagulation, where rennet, a mixture of rennin and other material found in the stomach lining of a calf is added to solidify the milk further. Following this, thick curds are cut typically with a knife to encourage the release of liquid or whey. The smaller the curds are cut, the thicker and harder the resulting cheese will become.

After the curds have been ladled into containers in order to be drained and formed into a full wheel of cheese, the &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; inoculum is sprinkled on top of the curds along with &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot;. Then, the curds granules are knit in molds to form cheese loaves with a relatively open texture. Next, whey drainage continues for 10–48 hours in which no pressure is applied, but the molds are inverted frequently to promote this process. Salt is then added to provide flavor as well as to act as a preservative so the cheese does not spoil through the process of brine salting or dry salting for 24–48 hours. The final step is ripening the cheese by aging it. When the cheese is freshly made, there is little to no blue cheese flavor development. Usually, a fermentation period of 60–90 days are needed before the flavor of the cheese is typical and acceptable for marketing.

During this ripening period, the temperature and the level of humidity in the room where the cheese is aging is monitored to ensure the cheese does not spoil or lose its optimal flavor and texture. In general, the ripening temperature is around eight to ten degrees Celsius with a relative humidity of 85–95%, but this may differ according to the type of blue cheese being produced. At the beginning of this ripening process, the cheese loaves are punctured to create small openings to allow air to penetrate and support the rich growth of the aerobic &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; cultures, thus encouraging the formation of blue veins.

Throughout the ripening process, the total ketone content is constantly monitored as the distinctive flavor and aroma of blue cheese arises from methyl ketones (including 2-pentanone, 2-heptanone, and 2-nonanone) which are a metabolic product of &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;.

=== Toxins from the production of blue cheese ===
&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;, responsible for the greenish blue moldy aspect of blue cheese, produces several mycotoxins. While mycotoxins like roquefortine, isofumigaclavine A, mycophenolic acid and ferrichrome are present at low levels, penicillic acid and PR toxin are unstable in the cheese. Because of the instability of PR toxin and lack of optimal environmental conditions (temperature, aeration) for the production of PR toxin and roquefortine, health hazards due to &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; metabolites are considerably reduced. Additionally, mycotoxin contamination occurs at low levels and large quantities of cheese are rarely consumed, suggesting that hazard to human health is unlikely.

== Physicochemical properties ==

=== Structure ===
The main structure of the blue cheese comes from the aggregation of the casein. In milk, casein does not aggregate because of the outer layer of the particle, called the “hairy layer.” The hairy layer consists of κ-casein, which are strings of polypeptides that extend outward from the center of the casein micelle. The entanglement of the hairy layer between casein micelles decreases the entropy of the system because it constrains the micelles, preventing them from spreading out. Curds form, however, due to the function that the enzyme, rennet, plays in removing the hairy layer in the casein micelle. Rennet is an enzyme that cleaves the κ-casein off the casein micelle, thus removing the strain that occurs when the hairy layer entangles. The casein micelles are then able to aggregate together when they collide with each other, forming the curds that can then be made into blue cheese.
=== Mold growth ===
&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; and &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; are both molds that require the presence of oxygen to grow. Therefore, initial fermentation of the cheese is done by lactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid bacteria, however, are killed by the low pH and the secondary fermenters, &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;, take over and break the lactic acid down, maintaining a pH in the aged cheese above 6.0. As the pH rises again from the loss of lactic acid, the enzymes in the molds responsible for lipolysis and proteolysis are more active and can continue to ferment the cheese because they are optimal at a pH of 6.0.

&quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; creates the characteristic blue veins in blue cheese after the aged curds have been pierced, forming air tunnels in the cheese. When given oxygen, the mold is able to grow along the surface of the curd-air interface. The veins along the blue cheese are also responsible for the aroma of blue cheese itself. In fact, one type of bacteria in blue cheese, &quot;Brevibacterium linens&quot;, is the same bacteria responsible for foot and body odor. &quot;B. linens&quot; was previously thought to give cheeses their distinct orangish pigmentation, but studies show this not to be the case and blue cheese is an example of the lack of that orange pigmentation. In pressing the cheese, the curds are not tightly packed in order to allow for air gaps between them. After piercing, the mold can also grow in between the curds.
=== Flavour ===

A portion of the distinct flavour comes from lipolysis (breakdown of fat). The metabolism of the blue mold further breaks down fatty acids to form ketones to give blue cheese a richer flavour and aroma.

== Regulation ==
=== European Union ===
In the European Union, many blue cheeses, such as Cabrales, Danablu, Gorgonzola, Roquefort and Blue Stilton, carry a protected designation of origin, meaning they can bear the name only if they have been made in a particular region. Similarly, individual countries have protections of their own such as France&#x27;s Appellation d&#x27;Origine Contrôlée and Italy&#x27;s Denominazione di Origine Protetta. Blue cheeses with no protected origin name are designated simply &quot;blue cheese&quot;.

=== Canada ===

Under the regulation of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, manufacturers can produce blue cheese with a maximum of 47 percent moisture and minimum of 27 percent milk fat. Salt is allowed to be used as a preservative; however, the amount of the salt or combination of salts shall not exceed 200 parts per million of milk and milk products used to make the cheese. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency does not limit the use of bacterial cultures to aid further ripening and flavoring preparations other than cheese flavoring.

=== United States ===

The United States Code of Federal Regulations standard for blue cheese specifies a minimum milkfat content of 50 percent, and maximum moisture of 46 percent. Optional ingredients permitted include food coloring to neutralize the yellowish tint of the cheese, benzoyl peroxide bleach, and vegetable wax for coating the rind.

== Properties ==
Gorgonzola, Stilton, and Roquefort are considered to be favored blue cheeses in many countries. These cheeses all have a protected designation of origin in which they may only be called their respective name if produced a certain way in a certain location.

=== Gorgonzola ===
Gorgonzola blue cheese takes its name from the village of Gorgonzola in Italy where it was first made. Belonging to the family of Stracchino cheeses, Gorgonzola is a whole milk, white, and &quot;uncooked&quot; cheese. This blue cheese is inoculated with &quot;Penicillium glaucum&quot; which, during ripening, produces the characteristic of blue-green veins. The odor of Gorgonzola varies between natural and creamy Gorgonzola. 63 components in natural Gorgonzola cheese and 52 components in creamy Gorgonzola cheese contribute to odor with 2-nonanone, 1-octen-3-ol, 2-heptanol, ethyl hexanoate, methylanisole and 2-heptanone being the prominent compounds for odor in both cheeses.

=== Stilton ===
Stilton blue cheese was first sold in the village of Stilton in England but there is little evidence it was ever made there. Different from Stichelton, which is made from raw milk, Stilton cheese is made from pasteurized milk. In addition to being inoculated with &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; to give it the blue vein characteristic, research has shown that other microbiota which are relatives of &quot;Lactococcus lactis&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus plantarum&quot;, &quot;Lactobacillus curvatus&quot;, &quot;Leuconostoc mesenteroides&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus equorum&quot;, and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; sp. can also be found in Stilton cheese. Some important microbiota contribute to the aromatic profile such as those of the &quot;Lactobacillus&quot; genus due to their production of volatile compounds. During ripening, free fatty acids increase in amount which contribute to the characteristic flavor of blue cheeses due to fat breakdown by &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;.

=== Roquefort ===
Roquefort blue cheese originates from the village of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. Its flavors come from the use of unpasteurized sheep&#x27;s milk, inoculation with &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;, and the special conditions of the natural caves of Roquefort-sur-Soulzon in which they are ripened. &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot; is the cause of the blue veins in Roquefort cheese. In addition to &quot;Penicillium roqueforti&quot;, various yeasts are present, namely &quot;Debaryomyces hansenii&quot; and its non-sporulating form &quot;Candida famata&quot;, and &quot;Kluyveromyces lactis&quot; and its non-sporulating form &quot;Candida sphaerica.&quot; Similarly to other kinds of blue cheeses, Roquefort&#x27;s flavor and odor can be attributed to the particular mixture of methyl ketones such as 2-heptanone, 2-pentanone, and 2-nonanone.

<doc id="926866" wikidata="Q5108332" url="?curid=926866" title="Chris Turner (footballer, born 1958)">
<text>Christopher Robert Turner (born 15 September 1958) is an English former footballer and former director of football at Wakefield. He made 589 league and cup appearances in a 19-year career as a professional in the English Football League and then took charge of a further 469 matches as a manager.

A goalkeeper, he began his career at hometown club Sheffield Wednesday, winning the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award in his debut season in 1977–78. He then won a place on the PFA Team of the Year the following season and also played on loan at Lincoln City before being sold to Sunderland for £80,000 in July 1979. He helped Sunderland to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1979–80, and in 1985 played on the losing side in the League Cup final, before he was named as the club&#x27;s Player of the Year. He was signed by Manchester United for a £275,000 fee in July 1985. He was sold back to Sheffield Wednesday for £175,000 in September 1988. The following year, he briefly played on loan at Leeds United. He helped Wednesday to win promotion out of the Second Division in 1990–91. He kept a clean sheet against former club Manchester United as Wednesday won the League Cup in 1991. He was moved on to Leyton Orient for £75,000 in 1991 and again named on the PFA Team of the Year in 1991–92.

He began his managerial career at Leyton Orient in August 1994, working alongside John Sitton. The pair were sacked in April 1995, and he coached at Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers before being appointed manager at Hartlepool United in February 1999. He turned the club from relegation candidates to consistent play-off challengers and was lured to Sheffield Wednesday in November 2002. He lasted 22 months at the job before being sacked in September 2004. He took charge at Stockport County three months later but was again unsuccessful and left the club by mutual consent in December 2005. He returned to Hartlepool United as Director of Sport in February 2006 before being named first-team manager in December 2008. He resigned in August 2010 and went on to work behind the scenes at Chesterfield, Port Vale and Wakefield.

==Playing career==
===Sheffield Wednesday===
Born in Sheffield, Turner began his goalkeeping career at Sheffield Wednesday, turning professional in August 1976. He was capped at England Youth level. He enjoyed a highly successful debut season, winning the club&#x27;s Player of the Year award for his performances across his 52 appearances as Len Ashurst&#x27;s Owls posted an eighth-place finish in the Third Division in the 1976–77 campaign. Wednesday slipped to 14th-place in the 1977–78 season, and Turner was limited to 31 appearances as new manager Jack Charlton looked for a larger-sized goalkeeper in Bob Bolder. Wednesday again finished 14th in 1978–79. Turner played 32 games at Hillsborough, whilst also spending a five-game loan spell at bottom club Lincoln City. He was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year, alongside teammate Brian Hornsby. Despite this award, Charlton sold Turner on to Sunderland for £80,000 in July 1979.

===Sunderland===
Ken Knighton led the Rokerites to promotion out of the Second Division in 1979–80 – they finished runners-up, just a point behind champions Leicester City – with Turner playing 30 of the club&#x27;s 42 league games as he fended off competition from Barry Siddall. He then featured 31 times as they consolidated their First Division status with a 17th-place finish. New manager Alan Durban then led Sunderland to a 19th-place finish in 1981–82, with Turner being limited to only 19 league appearances. He regained his first-team status in the 1982–83 season, playing 41 matches as Sunderland posted a 16th-place finish; during the season, he managed to keep six clean sheets in a row. Len Ashurst took charge for the end of the 1983–84 campaign, and kept faith in Turner, who ended the season with 48 appearances to his name. He featured 53 times across the 1984–85 campaign, his last one at Roker Park, as Sunderland were relegated in 21st-place. Sunderland did also make it to the League Cup final at Wembley Stadium in 1985, but lost 1–0 to Norwich City after Gordon Chisholm deflected Asa Hartford&#x27;s shot past Turner just after half-time. The campaign did end on a positive note on a personal level for Turner, as supporters voted him the club&#x27;s Player of the Year.

===Manchester United===
In July 1985, Ron Atkinson signed Turner for a £275,000 fee to challenge Gary Bailey for the number one shirt at Manchester United. Turner played 22 of the club&#x27;s 56 matches in the 1985–86 campaign, helping the Red Devils to a fourth-place finish. He was on the bench as United lost the 1985 FA Charity Shield to Everton. Bailey was injured for most of the 1986–87 season, but Turner could only make it to 29 appearances as youth team goalkeeper Gary Walsh established himself in the first-team at Old Trafford. Turner was placed on the transfer-list by new manager Alex Ferguson, but still went on to make 30 appearances in the 1987–88 season before his place was taken by incoming Aberdeen goalkeeper Jim Leighton.

===Return to Sheffield Wednesday===
Turner returned to Sheffield Wednesday, who had struggled in the First Division under Peter Eustace, for a £175,000 fee in September 1988. Ironically, Eustace was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who managed to keep Wednesday three points above the relegation zone at the end of the 1988–89 season. Turner played 23 of the club&#x27;s 38 league games in the 1989–90 season, as Wednesday dropped out of the top-flight on goal difference. He also spent a two-game spell on loan at Howard Wilkinson&#x27;s Second Division Leeds United, providing cover for the injured Mervyn Day. Wednesday made an immediate return to the First Division after securing the third automatic promotion place at the end of the 1990–91 season. Turner also kept goal in the 1991 League Cup final, and kept a clean sheet in a 1–0 victory over former club Manchester United.

===Leyton Orient===
However, Turner did not return to the top flight and instead dropped down to the Third Division to sign for Leyton Orient to be reunited with former Wednesday manager Eustace, who paid a fee of £75,000. The O&#x27;s finished in tenth place at the end of the 1991–92 campaign in what was Turner&#x27;s final season as a guaranteed number one. He was voted onto the PFA Team of the Year for the second time in his career. He was limited to 20 appearances in the 1992–93 season, as Orient missed out on the play-offs on goal difference. He played just eight games of the 1993–94 season and featured once in the 1994–95 campaign, by which time he had been elevated to joint-manager.

==Style of play==
Turner was an agile goalkeeper with good reflex shot-stopping ability and good handling, though he lacked a physical presence.

==Managerial career==
===Leyton Orient===
Turner started his managerial career at Leyton Orient as joint-manager with John Sitton at the start of the 1994–95 season. The campaign was unsuccessful, as Orient were relegated out of the Second Division in last place, and new chairman Barry Hearn sacked the pair on 20 April 1995. After leaving Brisbane Road, Turner was appointed as reserve team coach at Leicester City by manager Mark McGhee, and later moved with McGhee to Wolverhampton Wanderers, where he was appointed youth team coach.

===Hartlepool United===
Turner was appointed manager at Hartlepool United by chairman Ken Hodcroft on 24 February 1999, who were sitting bottom of the Football League following Mick Tait&#x27;s departure. He proved to be an instant success at Victoria Park, keeping the Monkey Hangers two places and three points ahead of Scarborough, who were relegated into non-League football and never to return at the end of the 1998–99 season following a real upturn in form. He then led Pools to a seventh-place finish in 1999–2000, though a 3–0 aggregate defeat to Darlington in the play-off semi-finals saw them remain in the Third Division. He was named as Third Division Manager of the Month for January 2001. Hartlepool narrowly missed out on a place in the automatic promotion places in 2000–01 and ended up losing 5–1 on aggregate to Blackpool in the play-off semi-finals. More play-off heartbreak followed in 2001–02; this time, they took Cheltenham Town to penalties after two legs of the semi-finals. He left the club, sitting top of the table, to manage his boyhood club on 7 November 2002, leaving Mike Newell to complete the task of securing promotion for Hartlepool.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
Turner took charge at Sheffield Wednesday 26 years after first making his debut for the club. He was unable to save the club from relegation to the third tier at the end of the 2002–03 season, and later said it was &quot;virtually a no-win situation&quot; and that it was &quot;like trying to build a shed without the tools. We had a lot of blunt tools, but no sharp ones&quot;. They also struggled to adapt in the Second Division, and ended the 2003–04 campaign in 16th-place and were the division&#x27;s lowest scorers with 48 goals. He released 13 players in May 2004. Turner was sacked on 18 September 2004 after a slow start to the League One campaign left Wednesday languishing in 14th-place. He stated that &quot;I&#x27;ve given it everything I had – we just needed more time&quot;. His successor, Paul Sturrock, steered the club to promotion at the end of the 2004–05 season, ironically beating Turner&#x27;s former club Hartlepool in the play-off final.

===Stockport County===
Turner returned to management with Stockport County on 19 December 2004, who were bottom of League One. He was unable to turn the &quot;Hatters&quot; around, and County ended the 2004–05 season relegated in last place. They went on to struggle in League Two, and Turner left the club by mutual consent on 27 December 2005, with Stockport now five points adrift at the bottom of the Football League. His replacement at Edgeley Park, Jim Gannon, managed to keep Stockport out of the relegation zone at the end of the 2005–06 season.

===Return to Hartlepool===
In February 2006, Turner returned to Hartlepool United in the newly created position of Director of Sport, with Paul Stephenson working as caretaker manager; Turner&#x27;s role left him to administer &quot;the club&#x27;s overseas participation in football tournaments, pre-season planning, conferences and Football League issues&quot;. On 15 December 2008, Turner took over as caretaker manager at Hartlepool following the departure of Danny Wilson, in addition to his Director of Sport role at the club. He then led Hartlepool to a 19th-place finish in League One at the end of the 2008–09 season, two places and one point above the relegation zone. Speaking in January 2010, Turner responded to criticism from supporters by saying that &quot;people have to realise to get into the top six is very difficult for the majority of clubs in this division&quot;. Pools ended the 2009–10 campaign above the relegation zone on goal difference after being deducted three points for fielding an ineligible player as Gary Liddle played against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion when he should have served a suspension. On 19 August 2010, Turner resigned from his position at Hartlepool. He had previously stated his frustration at what he said was a lack of funds to sign players. Over the summer he had released eight players but was only able to make four new signings. His successor, Mick Wadsworth, took the club to a 16th-place finish at the end of the 2010–11 season.

===Later career===
In October 2010, Turner fronted an ultimately unsuccessful bid to purchase Sheffield Wednesday. He went on to become chief executive of Chesterfield in December 2011, replacing Carol Wilby. He switched roles to director of football in January 2017, before he was made redundant two months later. He applied to take charge at Hartlepool for a third time in May 2017, citing &#x27;unfinished business&#x27;, but was unsuccessful. He was appointed as the new sales and marketing manager at Port Vale in November 2017. He left the role in June 2018 after being informed of the club&#x27;s decision to make a change.

Turner helped to found a new club Wakefield A.F.C. in 2019 and was appointed as director of football.

<text>Edwin Herbert Hall (November 7, 1855 – November 20, 1938) was an American physicist, who discovered the electric field Hall effect. Hall conducted thermoelectric research and also wrote numerous physics textbooks and laboratory manuals.

== Biography ==
Hall was born in Gorham, Maine, U.S. Hall did his undergraduate work at Bowdoin College, Brunswick, Maine, graduating in 1875. He was the principal of Gould Academy in 1875–1876 and the principal of Brunswick High School in 1876–1877. He did his graduate schooling and research, and earned his Ph.D. degree (1880), at the Johns Hopkins University where his seminal experiments were performed.

=== Discovery of Hall effect ===
The &quot;Hall effect&quot; was discovered by Hall in 1879, while working on his doctoral thesis in Physics under the supervision of Henry Augustus Rowland. Hall&#x27;s experiments in electromagnetics consisted of exposing thin gold leaf (and, later, using various other materials) on a glass plate and tapping off the gold leaf at points down its length. The effect is a potential difference (&quot;Hall voltage&quot;) on opposite sides of a thin sheet of conducting or semiconducting material (the &quot;Hall element&quot;) through which an electric current is flowing. This was created by a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the &quot;Hall element&quot;. The ratio of the voltage created to the amount of current is known as the &quot;Hall resistance&quot;, and is a characteristic of the material in the element. In 1880, Hall&#x27;s experimentation was published as a doctoral thesis in the American Journal of Science and in the Philosophical Magazine.

Hall effect sensors use his &quot;Hall effect&quot; to detect the magnetic field. Hundreds of millions are sold every year and are present in a large number of devices, including high efficiency electric propulsion systems on spacecraft.

In the presence of large magnetic field strength and low temperature, one can observe the quantum Hall effect, the quantization of the Hall resistance and in 1990 became a calibration standard for electrical resistance due to its low uncertainty (see ).

=== Subsequent career ===
Hall was appointed as a professor of physics at Harvard in 1895, and succeeded John Trowbridge as Rumford Professor of Physics in 1914. During the 1919 Boston police strike, Hall briefly volunteered as a strikebreaking police officer. After returning to the physics department, Hall retired in 1921 and died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, U.S. in 1938.

== Works ==
Hall made various contributions to scientific journals on the thermal conductivity of iron and nickel, the theory of thermoelectric action, and on thermoelectric heterogeneity in metals. His publications include: 
* &quot;A Text-Book of Physics&quot; (1891; third edition, 1903), with J. Y. Bergen
* &quot;Elementary Lessons in Physics&quot; (1894; 1900)
* &quot;The Teaching of Chemistry and Physics&quot; (1902), with Alexander Smith
* &quot;College Laboratory Manual of Physics&quot; (1904; revised edition, 1913)

<doc id="926877" wikidata="Q908121" url="?curid=926877" title="East Asian Gothic typeface">
<text>In East Asian writing systems, gothic typefaces (; ; , &quot;godik-che&quot;) are a type style characterized by strokes of even thickness and lack of decorations, akin to sans serif styles in Western typography. It is the second most commonly used style in East Asian typography, after Ming.

== History ==
Gothic typefaces were first developed in Japan. Starting in the 1960s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s Shanghai Printing Technology and Research Institute developed new typefaces for Simplified Chinese, including gothic typefaces. The communist government favored gothic typefaces because they were plain and &quot;represented a break with the past.&quot;

== Characteristics ==
Similar to Ming and Song typefaces, sans-serif typefaces were designed for printing, but they were also designed for legibility. They are commonly used in headlines, signs, and video applications.

=== Classifications ===
* Square sans (Japanese: &quot;kaku goshikku&quot;; ), the classic sans-serif style in which the lines of the characters have squared ends.
** Overlapping square sans () - This style is similar to the square sans, but in places where strokes overlap, a margin is inserted between the strokes to distinguish the strokes.
** Square new book () - Uses narrow horizontal and thick vertical strokes, similar to typefaces such as Optima.
* Round sans (Japanese: &quot;maru goshikku&quot;, , Korean: &quot;gullimche&quot;), has rounded ends and corners to the lines of the characters. In some cases, short protruding stroke ends at intersections are eliminated to make glyphs look rounder. This is the style of typeface used for Japanese road signs.
** Overlapping round sans () - This is similar to the round sans, but in places where strokes overlap, a margin is inserted between the strokes to distinguish the strokes.
** Rounded new book () - Uses narrow horizontal and thick vertical strokes, along with rounded line ends and corners.
* Mixed art () - Curved strokes are replaced by angled strokes with sharp or round corners.

== Sans-serif typefaces in computing ==

Sans serif typefaces, especially for default system fonts, are common in Japanese computing. Also, many Korean computing environments use Gulim which includes soft curves but is a sans-serif typeface.

In Chinese, versions of Microsoft Windows XP and older, the default interface typefaces have serifs (MingLiU and SimSun), which deviates from the sans serif styling use in most other (including East Asian) regions of the product. Starting in Windows Vista, the default interface typefaces in all regions were changed to sans-serif styles, using Microsoft JhengHei in Traditional Chinese environments and Microsoft YaHei in Simplified Chinese environments.

<doc id="926879" wikidata="Q2617545" url="?curid=926879" title="Ermac">
<text>Ermac is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. Debuting as an unlockable character in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), he is an amalgam of the souls of deceased warriors and possesses telekinetic abilities.

The character originated from rumors alleging he appeared in the original 1992 game as a glitch, which were perpetuated by video game magazine &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;). His name was derived from a diagnostics menu in the first game that displayed the text &quot;error macro&quot; as &quot;ERMACS&quot;. Although the rumors were false, growing interest led to him becoming an official playable character.

Ermac has additionally appeared in alternate series media including the animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; and the web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;. He has received positive reception for his special abilities, character development, and Fatality finishing moves, while his origins are considered among the most memorable legends of video gaming.

==History and conception==
In the diagnostics menu of the 1992 original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game, an audits screen displayed a macro created by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator and programmer Ed Boon in order to log coding errors. This practice was employed by series developer Midway Games since their 1990 arcade release &quot;Smash TV&quot;. It was spelled as &quot;ERMACS&quot;—a pluralized contraction of &quot;error macro&quot;—as in the number of times the program would execute. In early revisions of the game, it appeared on the audits screen beneath the counter &quot;Shang Tsung Beaten&quot; (in reference to the game&#x27;s final boss fight). After Boon added the hidden character Reptile to the third revision, &quot;ERMACS&quot; was now listed below the counters &quot;Reptile Appearances&quot; and &quot;Reptile Battles&quot;, which provoked players into searching for a second secret character called Ermac.

Midway removed the &quot;ERMACS&quot; listing from the game&#x27;s fifth and final update in March 1993, but speculation about the character intensified after &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (EGM) published a submitted screenshot from the game and a letter from &quot;Tony Casey&quot; that claimed he had played against a red ninja named Ermac and taken a Polaroid of the screen as evidence. Unbeknownst to the magazine, the photo was a doctored image of yellow ninja character Scorpion in the &quot;Warrior Shrine&quot; stage from the Super Nintendo version of the game that was tinted red with the added caption &quot;Ermac Wins&quot;. Reader responses contained varied complex instructions for accessing the character. With the still-nonexistent Ermac now visualized as a red ninja, players then claimed sightings of a random glitch that would cause the game&#x27;s ninja characters&#x27; graphics to flash red, with &quot;Error Macro&quot; or &quot;Ermac&quot; replacing their name in their energy bar, but such an occurrence was not possible as the macro counter could not increase in the event of a genuine glitch while no red palette for the character existed.

A scrambled message was included in the ending of the 1993 sequel &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; that read &quot;Ermac does not exist&quot;, but neither Boon nor Midway marketing director Roger Sharpe denied outright the character&#x27;s presence in the game. In October 1995, two years after the &quot;EGM&quot; incident, Ermac was added to the selectable roster of &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (an expansion of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;), as the developers felt that he had transformed from myth to urban legend and therefore warranted his inclusion in the series. In 2011, Boon clarified the rumors on Twitter, and said he had kept the meaning of the &quot;ERMACS&quot; listing secret in hopes of stirring up fan speculation about the character.

Midway alluded to the rumors and &quot;EGM&quot; hoax in subsequent &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games and related media. Ermac appeared on one panel in a &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; comic book prequel that was written and illustrated by series co-creator John Tobias. &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&#x27;s&quot; training mode contained a message that read, &quot;It is a little-known fact that &#x27;Ermac&#x27; is short for &#x27;Error Macro&#x27;&quot;, an homage to his origins that was revived in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; for a pre-match introduction sequence between Ermac and series newcomer Takeda. He was an Easter egg boss hidden at the Warrior Shrine level in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks,&quot; a 2005 beat &#x27;em up spinoff title that spans the events of &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;. Skarlet, a nonexistent female ninja character from &quot;MKII&quot; with a similar background, was included by NetherRealm Studios (formerly Midway Games) as a playable character in the 2011 reboot game in what the company considered a second instance of turning fan rumors into reality. In 2024, following Ermac&#x27;s playable release for &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Boon commented, &quot;We never would have guessed this red ninja with a ridiculous name would end up such a big part of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;″s history and still be kicking over 30 years later ... he has a full story [and] history and is part of the &quot;MK&quot; lore.&quot;

==Design and portrayals==
Ermac debuted in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; as one of three hidden unlockable characters, and was the only character who had not appeared in any previous series games. As a palette-swapped character, he was physically identical to the game&#x27;s other male ninjas save for his red coloring and darker skin tone, while he shared their special moves and in-game poses. For his return in the three-dimensional title &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, Ermac was given a distinct redesign by Steve Beran, the series&#x27; lead character designer and art director. Beran explained that the &quot;challenge&quot; of revamping old characters was to give them a fresh look from their previous incarnations while retaining elements that still made them recognizable to players. Ermac&#x27;s main fighting style in &quot;MK: Deception&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; is Choy Lay Fut, a martial art that specializes, as depicted in his &quot;Deception&quot; ending, in warding off multiple attackers. His &quot;Deception&quot; design was maintained for the 2011 reboot game but with an increased black palette. 

For &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot;, Ermac was designed with a more emaciated appearance with his mask exposing more of his face and revealing decaying skin as the result of his losing control of the souls inside his body, with a metal talisman modeled after his &quot;Deception&quot; design affixed to his chest in order to keep his physical form intact. The talisman initially covered his face, &quot;securely nailed deep into the skull&quot;, in concept artwork by character artist Justin Murray. Early designs by Murray had Ermac unmasked with a stockier figure and solid black palette. His play style was split into three fighting variations along with the game&#x27;s other playable characters. His &quot;Inner Workings&quot; Fatality (a finishing move that executes defeated opponents) in the game has him levitate his opponent, break their spine in midair, and then extract their gastrointestinal tract from their mouth. The finisher was conceived by lead game designer John Edwards: &quot;People were like, &#x27;That&#x27;s hilarious and disgusting.&#x27; I&#x27;m pretty proud of it.&quot; The sound effects used to depict the graphic violence of his finishers were created with slime and a plunger. Ermac first appeared in &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; as a non-playable character in the game&#x27;s story mode upon its September 2023 release, and then made available to players in April 2024 as part of a &quot;Kombat Pack&quot; of downloadable characters. His design retained his black-and-red palette and ashen skin complexion from &quot;MKX&quot;, but with minimal armor and no mask, while he was unmasked throughout the story mode. A mask and other costume enhancements were added to his design for his playable release. 

Ermac&#x27;s signature gameplay attribute throughout his series tenure is his telekinesis, which is visualized onscreen through his spiritual powers. The &quot;Telekinetic Slam&quot; (later renamed &quot;Force Lift&quot;) has him levitate his opponents and then throw them onto the ground. Ed Boon considered Ermac one of the strongest characters in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; based on the move, which he considered one of his overall favorites in the series. In a feature published on &quot;Xbox Wire&quot;, NetherRealm Studios design manager Nick Nicastro said that the improved software capabilities available for &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; since Ermac&#x27;s last appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; enabled the developers to enhance the visual effects of his soul powers and special moves, which he described as &quot;leaning heavily into certain horror inspirations&quot; in that the character &quot;has been haunted by unique souls he has captured throughout his existence&quot;.

Ermac was played by actor John Turk in the digitized games &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; and the 1996 compilation title &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;. He was voiced by Michael McConnohie in the 2011 reboot, and by Jamieson Price in &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
Introduced in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), Ermac was created to serve as an enforcer for Shao Kahn, the tyrannical ruler of the otherworldly dimension of Outworld. A hybrid entity created from the souls of deceased warriors, he possesses telekinesis and uses plural pronouns. Following his creation, he takes part in Shao Kahn&#x27;s invasion of Earth and the eponymous Mortal Kombat tournament.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), following Shao Kahn&#x27;s apparent death at the hands of the titular alliance of evil sorcerers Shang Tsung and Quan Chi, Ermac aimlessly wanders Outworld without orders until he encounters the blind swordsman Kenshi, who frees Ermac from Kahn&#x27;s control, and Ermac hones Kenshi&#x27;s telekinetic power in return. In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), Ermac reforms to atone for his work with Kahn by aiding the spirit of the deceased Liu Kang in successfully freeing the latter&#x27;s friends from their enslavement by the Dragon King Onaga. He is not in the storyline of the compilation title &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006), but in the game&#x27;s opening sequence, he joins Earth’s warriors in participating in a battle to claim the elemental Blaze&#x27;s godlike power.

After Earth defender Raiden alters the timeline to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot; in the reboot title &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Ermac returns to being Shao Kahn&#x27;s enforcer, and is defeated in the first Mortal Kombat tournament by eventual champion Liu Kang. He obliterates Jax&#x27;s arms, causing Jax to receive bionic implants. His ending reveals that one of the souls trapped inside his being is that of King Jerrod, Kitana&#x27;s father and former ruler of Edenia. In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), following Shao Kahn&#x27;s death, Ermac initially serves the former&#x27;s successor, Mileena, before defecting to Kotal Kahn due to Mileena not being Shao Kahn&#x27;s biological daughter. He joins Reptile, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr in serving Kotal Kahn as they conflict with Cassie Cage&#x27;s Special Forces unit in their attempt to protect their home realm of Outworld from Shinnok&#x27;s forces. Ermac was omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; (2019), but makes a brief appearance in the game&#x27;s &quot;Krypt&quot; feature.

In the rebooted storyline of &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), Ermac is again an assimilation of souls, now created by Quan Chi. He overpowers a group of Earth defenders upon his completion but is weakened after Kenshi absorbs several of the souls into his sword to unleash its power, leading to his defeat by Ashrah. His later defeat in combat by Mileena enables Jerrod&#x27;s soul to assume control of Ermac&#x27;s body, and he reunites with his former queen Sindel and family before joining the fight to protect Earth and Outworld. After Sindel is slain during battle with Shang Tsung&#x27;s forces, Jerrod absorbs her soul and appoints his daughter Mileena as the new Outworld empress.

===Other appearances===
Ermac appeared in two episodes of the 1996 animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;. He has a minor role as one of Shao Kahn’s henchmen in the 1997 feature film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, played by assistant stunt coordinator John Medlen and identified only in the closing credits. Although the script and print media publications mentioned his telekinetic powers, they were omitted from the film. 

His association with Kenshi in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; was loosely adapted for the 2013 second season of the web series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot;, in which he is a decaying, hooded demon who guards the &quot;sword of Sento&quot; under Shao Kahn&#x27;s orders and strikes Kenshi blind as the latter takes the sword. Ermac then battles Kenshi in the Mortal Kombat tournament in an attempt to repossess the sword before Kenshi kills him with it. He was played by stuntman and martial artist Kim Do Nguyen, with his makeup designed by Christien Tinsley.

Ermac appears in the &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; novelization, and in DC Comics&#x27; 2015 &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic miniseries. The character has been licensed for action figures, a life-sized standee, and an eighteen-inch limited-edition polystone statue.

==Reception==
Ermac&#x27;s origins as a glitch and rumored character are considered a memorable urban legend in video games. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; executive editor Eric Bratcher credited the &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; hoax with Ermac&#x27;s addition to the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series. Rudie Obias of &quot;Mental Floss&quot; and Yannick LeJacq of &quot;Kotaku&quot; considered it the result of fans&#x27; enthusiasm for the character. Steve Watts of &quot;1Up.com&quot; commented that supposed video-game glitches like Ermac &quot;go on to live as legends until the creators have no choice but to make it a reality.&quot; The staff of &quot;GameTrailers&quot; unsuccessfully attempted to access Ermac in the first game, per the reader instructions published in &quot;EGM&quot;, in an episode of their &quot;PopFiction&quot; web series that premiered at PAX Prime 2012. In his study &quot;Immersion and Worldbuilding in Videogames&quot;, Edin Omeragiċ of the University of Osijek stated that Ermac&#x27;s inclusion was &quot;especially immersive for the way it includes end users into the process, with developers seemingly relinquishing control over their world for a moment and making their fans feel as if they also had a hand in its creation.&quot;

Critical reaction to Ermac&#x27;s series debut was negative. While he and &quot;Mortal Kombat&#x27;s&quot; digitized ninjas made &quot;GamePro&quot;″s selection of the best palette-swapped video game characters, &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Dan Ryckert stated that he did not want these characters, aside from Scorpion and Sub-Zero, in future series installments. Journalist Jeff Gerstmann called the unlocking of Ermac in &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot; &quot;a hassle&quot;. Author David Church noted the &quot;poorly balanced&quot; gameplay of Ermac and other hidden characters who became playable in &quot;completist&quot; titles like &quot;UMK3&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Trilogy&quot;, while &quot;their backstories seem[ed] tacked onto the increasingly sprawling story world.&quot; 

Following his redesigns and roles in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; and thereafter, Ermac received positive reception for his development, and was rated by gaming media outlets among the top series characters. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; commented, &quot;This red-clad ninja might not be as iconic as Sub-Zero or Scorpion, but it&#x27;s hard not to love Ermac for his ... supernatural, Sith-like powers of telekinesis.&quot; Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; noted the character&#x27;s transformation from &quot;just an altered Scorpion/Sub-Zero sprite&quot; to &quot;a floating phantom, surrounded by souls and completely unpredictable.&quot; Jasper additionally commented on Ermac&#x27;s growth in &quot;Deception&quot;, &quot;where he broke the bonds of [Shao] Kahn&quot; and successfully battled multiple characters in his ending. Sociology professor Ricardo Cortez Lopes studied the modifications of Ermac&#x27;s &quot;Deception&quot; design in player-created &quot;Mugen&quot; game adaptations, theorizing that they influenced NetherRealm Studios&#x27; future iterations of the character.

Ermac&#x27;s initial &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; design received heavy fan criticism for the omission of his mask, which resulted in NetherRealm adding it to his redesign for his playable release. &quot;Game Rant&quot;″s Joseph Andress praised the subplot therein of Jerrod controlling Ermac&#x27;s body as &quot;humaniz[ing] the character like never before.&quot; Renaldo Matadeen of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; commented that it opened up future storyline possibilities &quot;that will add nuance, depth, and intricate layers to someone who was just another ninja palette&quot;. However, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Jason Fanelli felt the &quot;head scratcher&quot; subplot occurred &quot;out of nowhere with little explanation&quot; and &quot;erases everything that was cool about him&quot;.

His finishing moves have met with critical praise, particularly his &quot;Pest Control&quot; Fatality from the 2011 reboot game, in which he shrinks his opponent and crushes them underfoot. When NetherRealm Studios posted a trailer of &quot;Inner Workings&quot; from &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; on YouTube in March 2015, it accumulated over 850,000 views in less than a month, and was noted for its graphic content. &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; spotlighted it in an article titled &quot;Has &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; Finally Gone Too Far?&quot;, describing it as &quot;an act of medieval torture as imagined by Tolkien.&quot; Justin Clark of &quot;GameSpot&quot; remarked that the finisher &quot;might actually be the most shocking, gory, and disgusting act of surreal horror to ever happen in a video game, let alone the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series&quot;.

Response to Ermac&#x27;s alternate-media incarnations has been negative. Nathan Birch of &quot;Uproxx&quot; described him in &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot; as a &quot;forgettable red Scorpion clone&quot; and his fight scene with Sonya in the film as &quot;nondescript&quot;. In his review of &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy II&quot;, Carl Lyon of Fearnet censured Ermac&#x27;s design and what he believed was the character&#x27;s poorly developed role of an opponent to be quickly killed off. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; praised his fight scene with Kenshi but was also critical of his role in the story.

<doc id="926889" wikidata="Q2103830" url="?curid=926889" title="Pontiac Aztek">
<text>The Pontiac Aztek is a mid-size crossover SUV marketed by General Motors introduced in 2000 for the model years 2001 through 2005. As a four-door crossover with front-wheel drive and optional all-wheel drive, the Aztek featured a four-speed automatic transmission with a V6 engine. Marketed by Pontiac as a &quot;sport recreational vehicle,&quot; the Aztek used a shortened platform shared with GM&#x27;s minivans (e.g., the Pontiac Montana) featuring 94 cubic feet of cargo room with its rear seats removed. The design employed conventional rear outswing doors rather than sliding doors, and a split rear tailgate, the lower section formed with seat indentations and cupholders. Other features included a front center console that doubled as a removable cooler, optional rear stereo controls in the cargo area, optional sliding cargo floor with grocery compartments, and optional camping package with an attachable tent and air mattress.

The Aztek was noted for its controversial styling. Pulitzer Prize–winning automotive journalist Dan Neil, in naming it one of the 50 worst cars of all time, said the Aztek &quot;violate[d] one of the principal rules of car design: we like cars that look like us. With its multiple eyes and supernumerary nostrils, the Aztek looks deformed and scary, something that dogs bark at and cathedrals employ to ring bells. The shame is, under all that ugliness, there was a useful, competent crossover.&quot;

==Original concept==
First shown to the public in 1999, the Pontiac Aztek concept car was well received. It featured &quot;Xtreme&quot; futuristic styling and promised maximum versatility in support of a young and active lifestyle for its intended &quot;Generation X&quot; buyer demographic.

The Aztek went on sale in summer 2000 as a 2001 model.

The production edition of the Aztek was launched with the tagline &quot;Quite possibly the most versatile vehicle on the planet&quot; in conjunction with CBS&#x27;s hit reality show &quot;Survivor&quot; in 2000.

==Styling==
The Aztek was styled under the direction of Tom Peters, who would later design the Chevrolet Corvette (C7). According to an analysis in 2000, &quot;BusinessWeek&quot; said the Aztek was to signal a design renaissance for GM, and to &quot;make a statement about breaking from GM&#x27;s instinct for caution.&quot; One designer said that during the design process, the Aztek was made &quot;aggressive for the sake of being aggressive.&quot; Peters, the Chief Designer said &quot;we wanted to do a bold, in-your-face vehicle that wasn&#x27;t for everybody.&quot; The 2000 Business Week study said the Aztek was &quot;the first awkward step toward innovation by a company that has avoided that path,&quot; likening &quot;the debacle to Ford&#x27;s remodeling of its 1996 Taurus sedan.&quot;

Ultimately, the Aztek was criticized for its styling. Mickey Kaus described the Aztek as having &quot;awkwardly empty and square front wheel wells&quot; and a &quot;gratuitous, fierce animalistic snout, which may have been what prompted incoming GM executive Bob Lutz to famously say that many of the company&#x27;s products looked like &#x27;angry kitchen appliances. James Hall, vice-president at AutoPacific Inc, ranked the Aztek as one of the ten ugliest cars of all time, while Karl Brauer, CEO and editor-in-chief of TotalCarScore.com, said the Aztek featured &quot;atrocious proportions wrapped in plastic body cladding,&quot; and &quot;looked like a station wagon stretched out by a car bomb.&quot;

A poll in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in August 2008 placed the Aztek at number one of the &quot;100 ugliest cars&quot; of all time. An article by Edmunds.com placed the car first of the &quot;100 Worst Cars of All Time&quot; not only because of its styling but also because it &quot;destroyed an 84-year-old automaker.&quot; &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 2007 named the Aztek one of the 50 worst cars of all time (adding that underneath &quot;was a useful, competent crossover&quot;), and again in 2010 as one of the 50 worst inventions of all time.

==Technology and notable features==
The Aztek was produced at General Motors&#x27; Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, assembly plant, where it shared an assembly line with the Buick Rendezvous. In Canada, it filled the gap left since the Sunrunner&#x27;s discontinuation in 1997, while in the U.S. and Mexico, it was the first Pontiac-badged SUV ever sold. At launch, the Aztek was initially available with front-wheel drive, but later in the 2001 model year, a full-time, fully automatic all-wheel-drive system dubbed Versatrak was made available. The all-wheel-drive system provided traction in the snow or rain and could handle moderately rough off-road surfaces, thanks to its hydraulic gerotor pumps and multi-plate clutch packs, instead of the typically used viscous couplings. Versatrak models were equipped with a fully independent rear suspension with aluminum-alloy control arms and crossmember, as well as rear solid disc brakes, instead of the rear beam axle and drum brakes on front-wheel-drive models. The Versatrak system was supplied by Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG, under license from McLaren Traction Technologies. 

The Aztek was one of the first automobiles to be designed entirely using computerized rapid-prototyping/rapid-visualization tools. The dashboard was designed by Johnson Controls, and featured Pontiac&#x27;s trademark red lighting scheme along with an optional head-up display.

The Aztek was able to carry within its interior a standard sheet of plywood and was available with two rear cargo area options: a pull-out cargo tray that held up to that rolled on built-in wheels when removed from the vehicle, or a versatile cargo net system that held up to and could be configured (a claimed) 22 different ways. Options included a center console that doubled as a removable cooler and a tent/inflatable mattress package that, along with a built-in air compressor, allowed the Aztek to double as a camper. Extending this image was a seat-back mounted backpack, and a number of specialty racks for bicycles, canoes, snowboards, and other such items. An optional ten-speaker Pioneer stereo system provided a set of controls located at the rear of the vehicle for tailgate parties as well as an unusual two-piece tailgate with built-in cup-holders and contoured seating area for added comfort.

==Safety==
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) gave the Aztek a &quot;Marginal&quot; overall score in the frontal offset test. However, it did not conduct a side-impact test.

2004 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) Crash Test Ratings:

*Frontal Driver: 
*Frontal Passenger: 
*Side Driver: 
*Side Rear Passenger: 

==Sales==
==Reception==
GM forecast sales of up to 75,000 Azteks per year and needed to produce 30,000 annually to break even. Just 27,793 were sold in 2002, which was the model&#x27;s best-selling year.

Pricing of the Aztek was also an issue at launch: the vehicle was too expensive for its intended &quot;Generation X&quot; audience and was priced significantly higher than competing vehicles. After the 2001 model year, the GT model was dropped and pricing was slashed, in addition to extremely generous rebates and cut-rate financing instituted by GM in the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001.

The Aztek had among the highest CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) scores in its class, and won the appellation of &quot;Most Appealing Entry Sport Utility Vehicle&quot; in 2001 from J.D. Power and Associates, an independent consumer survey organization which noted: &quot;The Aztek scores highest or second highest in every APEAL component measure except exterior styling.&quot;

Matthew DeBord of &quot;The Big Money&quot; argued that despite its poor reviews and sales, the Aztek was the car that, in the long run, could save GM. He praised GM for being daring and trying to create an entirely new market in vehicles, rather than simply copying successful formulas. He argued that the Aztek&#x27;s failure is similar to the failure of Apple&#x27;s Newton and Macintosh Portable, both of which revolutionized the computer industry and became the basis for later successful products made by Apple.

The car was featured through a tie-in in the sci-fi show &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in 2000–02. Walter White, the lead character of the 2008 crime TV show &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, drove an Aztek. &quot;Jalopnik&quot; called it &quot;one of the perfect examples of car casting in TV&quot; and noted that the show had White&#x27;s Aztek repainted in a unique &quot;gray-beige-green tone&quot; to match White&#x27;s character&#x27;s original job as a mild-mannered high school chemistry teacher. In 2015, Edmunds ranked the Aztek sixth among U.S. used car buyers aged 18 to 34, crediting the &quot;&quot;Breaking Bad&quot; Effect&quot; for making the car cool.

The Aztek&#x27;s &quot;Design by Committee&quot; was criticized in Steve McConnell&#x27;s software design book, &quot;Code Complete 2&quot;.

==Year to year changes==

<doc id="926891" wikidata="Q611063" url="?curid=926891" title="Yohannes III">
<text>Yohannes III (c. 1797 – c. 1873) was Emperor of Ethiopia intermittently between 1840 and 1851, and a member of Solomonic dynasty. He was the son of Tekle Giyorgis. He was largely a figurehead, with real power in the hands of the &quot;Enderase&quot; or Regent, &quot;Ras&quot; Ali II a princeling of the Yejju Dynasty. &quot;Ras&quot; Ali&#x27;s mother was the Empress Menen Liben Amede.

==Life==
During the various wars between &quot;Ras&quot; Ali and his leading rival for power, &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wube Haile Maryam of Semien, Emperor Yohannes was deposed and restored several times between 30 August 1840 and 1851, alternating with his cousin Sahle Dengel. Yohannes was deposed the first time (October 1841) for showing himself a friend to &quot;Dejazmach&quot; Wube; he was restored briefly in 1845, then restored once again &quot;by some unknown means&quot; in 1850, according to E. A. Wallis Budge.

Budge portrays Yohannes as a contemptible character, &quot;only tolerated because he belonged to the Solomonic line. He was a glutton and a wine bibber, and was usually drunk, and when he was not in his banquet hall he was in his harim.&quot; On the other hand, according to Donald Crummey, he came under the influence of Catholic missionaries working with bishop Justin de Jacobis, converting to Roman Catholicism in 1851.

His ultimate fate is unclear—as well as many of the details of his reign. He is said to have been ruling as Emperor 18 June 1847 when Empress Mennen was defeated in combat near the northern shores of Lake Tana by Kassa of Qwara (the future Tewodros II), who captured Yohannes and Mennen and traded them to &quot;Ras&quot; Ali for the title of &quot;Dejazmach&quot; and the territories of the deceased &quot;Ras&quot; Kinfu in Gojjam. Another source states that when Kassa finally usurped the Imperial throne, Yohannes agreed to step down from the throne on the condition that the new Emperor guarantee that he would not ever be made to reunite with his much hated wife, Empress Mennen.

After this, Yohannes lived as a commoner. In 1856, the Catholics in Ethiopia tried to interest him in returning to the throne, but he was far more interested in undertaking a pilgrimage to Jerusalem; two years later he joined the court of Emperor Tewodros and returned to the Ethiopian Church. He was still part of Tewodros&#x27; court in April 1866, when Hormuzd Rassam mentions meeting &quot;the puppet Emperor, Hatse Yuhannes, who was sick and could come to the assembly&quot;. One of his letters survives, written 11 June 1869, in which he asks Napoleon III for financial relief. According to a letter written by his nephew, Tesemma Zerubabel, to Antoine d&#x27;Abbadie and dated 25 September 1875, Yohannes died &quot;two years previously&quot;, which would be 1873.

<doc id="926895" wikidata="Q1071487" url="?curid=926895" title="Ming typefaces">
<text>Ming or Song is a category of typefaces used to display Chinese characters, which are used in the Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages. They are currently the most common style of type in print for Chinese and Japanese. For Japanese and Korean text, they are commonly called Mincho and Myeongjo typefaces respectively.

== Name ==
The names &quot;Song&quot; (or &quot;Sung&quot;) and &quot;Ming&quot; correspond to the Song dynasty when a distinctive printed style of regular script was developed, and the Ming dynasty during which that style developed into the Ming typeface style. In Mainland China, the most common name is &quot;Song&quot; (the Mainland Chinese standardized Ming typeface in Microsoft Windows being named &quot;SimSun&quot;). In Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan and Korea, &quot;Ming&quot; is prevalent. In Hong Kong and Taiwan, &quot;&quot;Song&quot; typeface&quot; () has been traditionally used, but &quot;&quot;Ming&quot; typeface&quot; () has gained popularity since the advent of desktop publishing (the Traditional Chinese standardized Ming typeface in Microsoft Windows being named &quot;MingLiU&quot;). Some type foundries use &quot;Song&quot; to refer to this style of typeface that follows a standard such as the Standard Form of National Characters, and &quot;Ming&quot; to refer to typefaces that resemble forms found in the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot;.

== Characteristics ==
Characteristics of Ming typefaces include the following:
* The basic structure of regular script
* Thick vertical strokes contrasted with thin horizontal strokes
* Triangles at the end of single horizontal strokes, called (, literally &quot;fish scales&quot;) in Japanese, comparable to serifs. These are a print analog of the slight dot caused by pausing one&#x27;s brush ( ), the &quot;pause technique&quot;, used to reinforce the beginning or ending of a stroke, which is characteristic of regular script.
* Overall geometrical regularity

Possessing variable line weight and characteristic decorations at the end of lines similar to serifs, this type style is comparable to Western serif typefaces, as opposed to East Asian gothic typefaces which are comparable to Western sans-serif.

=== Variations ===
Often there are different ways to write the same Chinese character; these are collectively referred to as variant Chinese characters. Some of the differences are caused by character simplification, while others are purely orthographic differences such as stroke styling. The styling of the strokes used in old Ming typefaces came from the style used in the &quot;Kangxi Dictionary&quot;. 

In mainland China, the modern standardized character forms are specified in the &quot;List of Commonly Used Characters in Modern Chinese&quot;. Some characters in the list differ from the Kangxi forms solely because they are Simplified while others differ because they use a different variant or orthography.

In Taiwan, the Standard Form of National Characters specifies the modern standardized forms. Unlike the mainland standard, the Taiwan standard uses mostly preexisting character forms but reference back to the style of regular script and reform Ming typefaces based on regular script style extensively, which had attracted criticism from many peoples.

After the postwar kanji reforms in Japan, most of the Kangxi style characters were called (old style), while the reformed characters were called , causing newer dictionaries to either incorporate both styles or omit the Kangxi styles. In Korea, most typefaces use the Kangxi forms.

There are differences between print and script forms of many Chinese characters, just as there are differences between copperplate and most people&#x27;s handwriting. Some of these differences are persistent and specific to a style, but others may be no more significant than variations between individual typefaces. None of these variations usually hinder reading.

== History ==

===China===
The printing industry from the Tang dynasty reached an apex in the Song dynasty, during which there were three major areas of production:
*Zhejiang, where publications imitated the regular script of Ouyang Xun
*Sichuan, where publications imitated the regular script of Yan Zhenqing
*Fujian, where publications imitated the regular script of Liu Gongquan

When Song lost control of northern China to the Jin (金) dynasty, its capital was moved to Lin&#x27;an (modern Hangzhou), where there was a revival of printing, especially literature from Tang left in what was conquered by the Jin dynasty. Many publishers were established in Lin&#x27;an, including &quot;Chén zhái shūjí pù&quot; () established by Chen Qi (), from which publications used a distinct style of regular script with orderly, straight strokes. Modern typefaces of this style are classified as imitation Song typefaces (). In the Ming dynasty, the straightening of strokes in a reprint of a publication from Lin&#x27;an started a shift to what became the basis of the Ming style.
=== Japan ===

 are the most commonly used style in print in Japan. There are several variations in use, such as the textbook style and the newspaper style.

The creator of modern Japanese movable-type printing, Motoki Shōzō (or Motogi), modeled his sets of type after those prevailing in China, having learned an electrolytic method of type manufacturing from the American William Gamble in 1869. Motoki then created, based on Gamble&#x27;s frequency studies of characters in the Chinese Bible, a full set of type with added Japanese characters; in addition to Chinese and Latin characters, Japanese text uses the syllabaries hiragana and katakana.

=== Korea ===
In Korean, a similar category of typefaces for the Korean alphabet hangul was called &quot;myeongjo&quot; (the Korean reading for the same Chinese characters &quot;&quot;) until recently, influenced by the Japanese term. A Ministry of Culture-sponsored standardization of typography terms in 1993 replaced &quot;myeongjo&quot; with &quot;batang&quot; (&quot;&quot;), the Korean word for &quot;foundation&quot; or &quot;ground&quot; (as opposed to &quot;figure&quot;), and is the current term for the typeface.
== Ming typefaces in computing ==

Technically, only Chinese characters can be printed in a Ming typeface. However, most modern typefaces (that is, digital typefaces) often also include kana glyphs in a matching style, usually in a precise style resembling handwriting with a brush. Modern Ming typefaces also incorporate Roman type glyphs for Latin characters, letterlike symbols, and numbers. In its modern role comparable to that of western serif typefaces, both kana and Latin characters are usually part of a complete typeface.

Ming typefaces are used officially by the governments of China, Japan, and Korea.

<text>A Question of Sport (known as Question of Sport from 2021 until 2023) is a British television sports quiz show produced and broadcast by the BBC. It was the &quot;world&#x27;s longest running TV sports quiz&quot;. Following a pilot episode in December 1968, broadcast only in the north of England, the series ran from 1970 (except in 1973 and 1978) until production ceased in 2023. The final presenter was Paddy McGuinness, with team captains Sam Quek and Ugo Monye.

The show&#x27;s viewing figures slumped from around 4 million in 2021 to around 800,000 in 2023 following an overhaul of the staff.

==History==
===First edition===
The first edition of &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; was broadcast on 5 January 1970. Presenter David Vine was joined by captains Henry Cooper and Cliff Morgan. The teams were composed of George Best, Lillian Board, Tom Finney and Ray Illingworth.

===40th anniversary===
On 8 January 2010, the BBC broadcast a 40th-anniversary special. Joining presenter Sue Barker and captains Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell were Pat Cash, David Coulthard, Laura Davies and Michael Johnson.

===2012 Summer Olympics specials===
Following the 2012 Summer Olympics, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; aired two special editions featuring champions from the aforementioned Olympics.

====Gold Medal Winners special====
On 1 September 2012, Katherine Grainger and Jason Kenny were among the gold medal winners featured.

====2012 Olympics special====
On 29 September 2012, Tim Baillie, Jade Jones, Laura Kenny, Greg Rutherford and Etienne Stott partook.

===1,000th episode===
On 4 March 2013, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; marked its 1,000th episode. Each captain was joined by two former captains. Dawson was joined by Willie Carson and John Parrott, while Tufnell was joined by Bill Beaumont and Ally McCoist. Tufnell&#x27;s team won.

===2016 Summer Olympics specials===
Shortly after the 2016 Summer Olympics, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; held two special editions featuring champions from the above-mentioned Olympics.

====The Olympic Champions special====
On 7 September 2016, the Olympic Champions special featured gold medal winners, including Callum Skinner.

====Gold Rush special====
On 14 September 2016, for a Gold Rush special, &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; were joined by Maddie Hinch, Jason Kenny, Laura Kenny and Sam Quek.

===50th anniversary===
====&quot;A Question of Sport at 50&quot;====
On 27 December 2019, the BBC aired a documentary that looked back on the programme&#x27;s history. As well as looking back through the archives, &quot;A Question of Sport at 50&quot; saw a number of sportspeople recount their memories, these included: Jessica Ennis-Hill, Colin Jackson, and Denise Lewis. Sue Barker, Matt Dawson and Phil Tufnell also shared their experiences.

====50 Not Out====
On 3 January 2020, Sue Barker presented a 50th-anniversary special. Matt Dawson captained a team composed of Laura Davies and Beth Tweddle, while Phil Tufnell led Ally McCoist and Martin Offiah. Dawson&#x27;s team won, the 1,255th episode, by 19 points to 16.

===Theme tune===
There have been four theme tunes over the years. The current theme was introduced in the mid-1980s and has been remixed and updated several times since that time, most recently in 2021.

===Cancellation===
Following the programme producers&#x27; decision in 2021 to &quot;refresh&quot; the Question of Sport by introducing a new host (Paddy McGuiness) and revising the structure of the quiz there was an ensuing drop-off in audience figures and, in December 2023, after two series of the revamped production, the BBC announced a decision to &quot;shelve&quot; the programme citing &quot;inflation and funding challenges&quot;. The BBC did not rule out a future return of the programme.

==Rounds==
The rounds regularly played during series 48, include:

===Picture Board===
Twelve numbered squares each reveal a sportsperson to be identified during this one-minute round.

===One Minute Round===
Each team is asked nine questions in 60 seconds.

===Sports Action===
Contestants are asked questions about a montage of sporting action.

===Observation Round===
Sports action is shown and contestants are asked questions about details of what they have just seen, e.g. &quot;What colour hat was a certain person wearing?&quot; or &quot;How many balls were there?&quot;

===Mystery Guest===
Each team tries to identify a sportsperson in unfamiliar circumstances and using unconventional camera angles.

===Home or Away===
Each contestant can answer a one-point &quot;home question&quot; on the sport they participate or participated in or can answer an &quot;away question&quot; on a different sport for up to three points—away questions require three answers, a point per correct answer.

===Buzzer Round===
The teams play head-to-head, answering as many questions as possible in 60 seconds. At this point, the round immediately ends, even if each presenter is halfway through asking a question.

===Sprint Finish===
The captains have 60 seconds to act out up to ten sporting terms for the remaining members of the team to guess.

==Presenters and captains==

===Presenters===
The 1968 pilot episode, broadcast only in the north of England, was hosted by Stuart Hall. The first series was broadcast nationally from January 1970, with David Vine at the helm for the first five series. David Coleman succeeded Vine, and remained as presenter until 1997. Vine returned to the series as a guest host in 1989, presenting the final five episodes of series 18 in Coleman&#x27;s absence. Sue Barker presented &quot;A Question of Sport&quot; from 1997 until 2021. She won the 1976 French Open tennis tournament and reached a World Ranking of 3. The final presenter was Paddy McGuinness, who took over in 2021.

===Captains===
&quot;A Question of Sport&quot;″s first captains were boxer Henry Cooper and rugby union player Cliff Morgan. Over the history of the show, some captains have had long tenures: these include rugby union player Bill Beaumont making 319 appearances and footballer Ally McCoist making 363 appearances. The show&#x27;s longest-serving captain is Matt Dawson, who appeared on the show for 17 years from 2004 to 2021.

The final team captains, who began on the show in 2021, were Ugo Monye and Sam Quek. Monye is a former rugby union international, who won 14 caps for England; he played club rugby for Harlequins and also played for the British &amp; Irish Lions. Quek is a former hockey international, who won gold as part of the Great Britain women&#x27;s national field hockey team at the 2016 Summer Olympics; she was the first female team captain on &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;.

*&quot;A Question of Pop&quot;, presented by Jamie Theakston, 2000–01, which used the same graphics and set as the &quot;Sport&quot; version but different colours. Noddy Holder (Tony Hadley in episode 1) and Suggs were the team captains.

*&quot;A Question of TV&quot;, presented by Gaby Roslin, 2001; Lorraine Kelly and Rowland Rivron were the team captains.

*&quot;A Question of Sport: Super Saturday&quot; with Jason Manford in 2014 on BBC One

Roslin also hosted a one-off special, &quot;A Question of EastEnders&quot;, in 2000. Another one-off special, &quot;A Question of Comedy&quot;, was to have been aired on 16 March 2007 as a part of Comic Relief 2007, but after a scandal involving contestant Jade Goody it was replaced with a special edition of &quot;Top Gear&quot; titled &quot;Top Gear of the Pops&quot;.

&quot;A Question of Spit&quot; was a short segment aired in 1988 as part of the inaugural Red Nose Day telethon, featuring Daley Thompson, Barry McGuigan and Mike Gatting forming a team, with their opponents being their own Spitting Image puppets, captained by an Emlyn Hughes puppet. The quiz was hosted by the Spitting Image puppet of David Coleman, with the real Coleman and the puppet Steve Davis also making an appearance.

On 21 March 2012, One Media Radio&#x27;s Final Whistle produced a one-off end-of-year special titled &quot;Final Quizzle: Final Whistle does A Question of Sport&quot;. Presented by Barry Landy, the show featured two teams consisting of Stuart Hodge, Rory Wilde, Phil Peacock, Steve Sanders, Ben Mouncer and Lewis Davies and included rounds such as &#x27;Tiger&#x27;s Eighteen Holes&#x27; and &#x27;Whelan or Fortune&#x27;.

In November 2012, One Media Radio&#x27;s Head of Sport Edmund Doc Crosthwaite confirmed that &quot;Final Quizzle&quot; would return for a one-off Christmas special on 12 December 2012.

&quot;A Question of Sport Relief&quot; is a special version of the show usually presented by a guest presenter on Sport Relief night since 2002. The 2002, 2004 and 2006 versions were hosted by Stephen Fry. 2008&#x27;s version was hosted by Jimmy Carr after Fry had to withdraw, having broken his arm.

BBC One Scotland aired a one-off &quot;A Question of Scotland&quot; as part of &quot;Children in Need 2008&quot;, with Jackie Bird as quizmaster.

The CBBC programme &quot;Dick and Dom in da Bungalow&quot; made a parody called &quot;A Question of Muck&quot; as part of the &#x27;creamy muck muck&#x27; grand finale game.

The CBBC programme &quot; The Saturday Show&quot; did a segment called &quot;A Question of Busted&quot;. Featuring the band Busted answering questions about themselves, it was presented by Fearne Cotton who in each segment was dressed as Sue Barker.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;What Happened Next?&quot; round was spoofed in an episode of &quot;A Bit of Fry &amp; Laurie&quot; as David Coleman (Fry) asks Emlyn Hughes (Laurie) to guess what happened after the action stopped in the previous sketch. The host&#x27;s refusal to confirm whether the given answer is correct then leads into another round of the game, with the question of what happened following the original What Happened Next? sketch.

The show was one of many British TV shows reinterpreted by &quot;Chanel 9&quot;, a recurring sketch on &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, where it was titled &quot;Questo Sporta&quot; and featured the mystery guest round.

<text>Michael Thomas Richter (born September 22, 1966) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender. He played his entire National Hockey League career, from 1989 to 2002, with the New York Rangers organization, and led the team to the Stanley Cup in 1994. He also represented the United States in international play on several occasions. Richter was named to the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame, alongside his former Rangers and U.S. teammate Brian Leetch, in 2008.

==Playing career==
Richter grew up in Flourtown, Pennsylvania, near Philadelphia, and idolized Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Bernie Parent. He attended and played for Germantown Academy in Fort Washington, Pennsylvania, and then Northwood School in Lake Placid, New York, graduating in 1985. He also played at the Wissahickon Skating Club. After playing for the United States in the World Junior Championships in 1985, Richter played for the University of Wisconsin–Madison from 1985 to 1987, and the Rangers made him the 28th overall pick in the 1985 NHL Entry Draft. He again represented the US in the 1986 World Junior Championships, as well as the World Championships and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, before making his NHL debut in the 1989 playoffs. Though he lost the one game in which he played, he was soon a regular member of the Rangers, posting 12 wins against 5 losses in his rookie season as the club&#x27;s backup goaltender. Over the next two seasons, Richter split goaltending duties with the Rangers&#x27; veteran starter, John Vanbiesbrouck, and was selected to play for the U.S. in the 1991 Canada Cup tournament.

Vanbiesbrouck was traded to the Vancouver Canucks prior to being selected by the Florida Panthers in the 1993-94 NHL expansion draft. Richter then had his first campaign as the team&#x27;s number one goaltender. He posted a career best 42 wins and 2.57 goals against average as the Rangers won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy as the league&#x27;s top regular season team for the second time in three years. He was also named Most Valuable Player of the NHL All-Star Game, which the Rangers hosted at Madison Square Garden. In the playoffs, he ramped up his play, becoming the eighth goaltender to post four shutouts in one playoff season. The Rangers reached the Stanley Cup Finals against the Canucks, and Richter earned a career highlight in Game 4, famously stopping Vancouver sniper Pavel Bure on a penalty shot. The Rangers defeated the Canucks in seven games to win their first Stanley Cup since 1940.

Over the next few years, Richter would be consistently ranked among the world&#x27;s top goaltenders. He led the United States to victory in the 1996 World Cup of Hockey, with his efforts earning him tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Injuries plagued much of his career, including MCL sprains, ACL sprains, and concussions.

Richter&#x27;s style of play was very acrobatic and quick. For a small goalie he made himself look big by using his lightning quick reflexes to make saves. He was rarely out of position and always square to his shooters. He was known for making plenty of desperation saves using his focus, flexibility, and athleticism. Longtime teammate and Hall of Fame Ranger defenseman Brian Leetch once said about Richter: &quot;I have never seen anyone more focused than he was. As the game got tougher, he got better. If a goal was ever scored on him I was always surprised.&quot;

His last appearance in the Stanley Cup playoffs would be 1997, as a series of knee injuries and a string of mediocre Ranger teams saw his personal statistics suffer. Nevertheless, he was selected as the top goalie for Team USA in the 1998 and 2002 Olympics, winning a silver medal in the 2002 Games.

Richter was selected by the Nashville Predators in the 1998 NHL Expansion Draft, but as a UFA chose to eventually return to the Rangers that summer.

On June 30, 2002, Richter&#x27;s rights were traded to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for future considerations. The Oilers were unable to sign Richter, and he returned to the Rangers on a new contract a few days later on July 4. A year later a skull fracture and concussion forced him to retire, but not until after he became the first Ranger to record 300 wins. He finished his career as the Rangers all-time leader in wins, later surpassed by Henrik Lundqvist.

Richter&#x27;s jersey (#35) became the third number retired by the Rangers at Madison Square Garden on February 4, 2004. Though he played his entire career for the Rangers, he twice changed teams between seasons due to a quirk in the NHL rules of free agency, returning to the Rangers each time.

==Post-retirement==
Richter is currently the President of Brightcore Energy. 

In 2007 and 2009, Richter stated that he would be interested in running for Congress as a Democrat in either Connecticut&#x27;s 4th congressional district or New York&#x27;s 20th congressional district special election, 2009.

After retiring from the NHL, Richter enrolled in Yale University, entering through the highly competitive Eli Whitney Students Program, Yale College&#x27;s admissions program for non-traditional students. He received his degree in Ethics, Politics, and Economics with a concentration in Environmental Policy (EP&amp;E).

He was previously a founding partner at Healthy Planet Partners, a sustainable power finance and consulting group, and Environmental Capital Partners, a $100 million private equity fund focusing on resource efficiency. Richter serves on the Board of Trustees for the Adirondack Nature Conservancy, and sits as a member of the National Advisory Council for the Sierra Club. He recently began collaborating with the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) in their effort to bring the best ecological practices to the sports industry. He also launched Athletes for a Healthy Planet, an organization dedicated to fostering an understanding of the connections between environmental issues, human health, economy, social justice, and well-being.

Richter, together with other retired NHL players, played in a UN Environment Programme-sponsored hockey game near the North Pole in April 2019. The idea for the game was conceived by Russian hockey legend Viacheslav Fetisov, and was intended to raise awareness of receding ice in polar regions due to climate change.

Richter has three sons, all of whom grew up playing ice hockey in their hometown of Greenwich, Connecticut.

<text>Jason Michael Johnson (born October 27, 1973) is an American former Major League Baseball pitcher. He throws and bats right-handed.

==Career==
Johnson graduated from Conner High School in Hebron, Kentucky. He did not enter college, but was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an undrafted free agent in . He made his major league debut with the Pirates in 1997, appearing in only three games. Following the season, he was selected in the 1997 Expansion Draft by the newly created franchise, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In his lone season in Tampa Bay, Johnson went 2–5 in 13 starts. He was traded to the Baltimore Orioles before the 1999 season. From 1999 to 2003, Johnson was with the Baltimore Orioles, 2001 being his best season of his career, going 10–12 with a career low 4.09 ERA. In , he received the Tony Conigliaro Award. 

Johnson signed a two-year deal with the Detroit Tigers prior to the 2004 season. In his first season with Detroit, Johnson posted his worst season as a full-time starter, going 8–15 with an ERA of 5.13 in 196+ innings. On June 8, , Johnson became the first Tigers pitcher to hit a home run in a regular season game since Les Cain in . The homer came against Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Jeff Weaver, at Dodger Stadium. Despite finishing the season 8–13, Johnson lowered his ERA from the previous season and pitched in a career high 210 innings while posting his lowest K/9 of his career, striking out just 93 while inducing 49 walks.

Johnson signed with Cleveland prior to the season. He fared no better there, going 3–8 with a 5.96 ERA. He was designated for assignment on June 22, 2006. Before he decided whether or not to accept the assignment, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox for cash. In Boston, his time as a member of the Red Sox was disastrous, going 0–4 with a 7.36 ERA. On August 18, 2006, Johnson was designated for assignment by the Red Sox. He quickly signed a minor league contract with the Cincinnati Reds.

He signed an incentive-laden, one-year, $3 million contract with the Seibu Lions for the season. He pitched one season in Japan, then on February 7, , signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the Los Angeles Dodgers. He failed to make the Dodgers opening day roster and was assigned to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s. On July 18 the Dodgers added him to the 25-man roster. He finished the season with them, going 1–2 with an ERA of 5.22. On January 6, , he signed a minor league contract with an invitation to spring training with the New York Yankees, where he was expected to compete for the final spot in the starting rotation. However, before reporting to spring training, Johnson was diagnosed with choroidal melanoma in his right retina. He began the season in Triple-A Scranton, but suffered a labrum tear in his shoulder. On August 10, 2009, he was released by the Yankees.

He last played for the Amarillo Sox in the American Association of Independent Professional Baseball in 2013.

Johnson has type 1 diabetes and was the first Major League Baseball player to get permission to wear an insulin pump on the field. He wore the pump on his belt on the left side of his lower back, in order to minimize the chance of it being hit by a bat or thrown ball.

<doc id="926921" wikidata="Q3433743" url="?curid=926921" title="Meduxnekeag River">
<text>The Meduxnekeag River ( ) is a tributary of the Saint John River. It is about long. The North Branch Meduxnekeag River rises from the outlet of a small pond () in Maine and runs to its confluence with the Meduxnekeag in Wakefield, New Brunswick. The South Branch Meduxnekeag River rises from the outflow of Johnson Pond () in Linneus, and runs to its confluence with the Meduxnekeag River two miles upstream from Houlton, Maine. The Meduxnekeag joins the Saint John in Woodstock, New Brunswick.

The earliest mention of the name is in the narrative of John Gyles. He states that in 1689 he visited a branch of the St. John river about ten miles to a branch called Medeockseenecasis. The suffix &quot;asis&quot; is a diminutive so it is possible that the name is a form of Little Meductic. The current spelling was first seen in 1840.

In New Brunswick, the watershed of the Meduxnekeag is home to the richest, most diverse, and highest concentration of remnant sites of mature Appalachian Hardwood Forest in Atlantic Canada, containing many understorey plants rare or uncommon in the province. These include black raspberry, wild ginger, maidenhair fern, showy orchis, wild coffee, and numerous others. The non-profit Meduxnekeag River Association Inc., based in Woodstock, has purchased, since 1998, approximately 2.25 square kilometres (500 acres) of forest, with more than of undeveloped shoreline. This Meduxnekeag Valley Nature Preserve has more than of well-marked, low impact walking trails.

Animals commonly found in the watershed include the moose, white-tailed deer, black bear, eastern coyote, red fox, raccoon, beaver, eastern chipmunk, striped skunk, red squirrel, snowshoe hare, mink, weasels, porcupine, and various mice, voles, and shrews.

Significant sections of the Meduxnekeag are easy to canoe or kayak in high or medium water conditions (generally in May and June, and in September and October; also in July/August in wet summers). Annual canoe races are held in both Maine and New Brunswick in May. Recreational canoeists traditionally put in just below the bridge on the North Branch (just above the confluence) and take out in downtown Woodstock, a half-day canoe depending on lingering time, passing through scenic, mostly forested country. The final 2 km before Woodstock is through an extensive wetland.

The intervales and islands of the Meduxnekeag are locally celebrated for the edible fiddlehead ostrich fern, harvested in May.

<text>The Man-Thing (Dr. Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Sallis) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writers Stan Lee, Roy Thomas, and Gerry Conway and artist Gray Morrow, the character first appeared in &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #1 (May 1971), and went on to be featured in various titles and in his own series, including &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot;. Steve Gerber&#x27;s 39-issue run on the series is considered to be a cult classic.

The Man-Thing is a large, slow-moving, empathic, humanoid swamp monster living in the Florida Everglades near a Seminole reservation and the fictional town of Citrusville in Cypress County (also fictional), Florida.

The character made its live-action debut in the film &quot;Man-Thing&quot; (2005), played by Conan Stevens. He later appeared in the Marvel Cinematic Universe television special &quot;Werewolf by Night&quot; (2022), motion-captured by Carey Jones and with Jeffrey Ford providing additional vocalizations.

==Publication history==
As described in the text featurette &quot;The Story Behind the Scenes&quot; in &quot;Savage Tales&quot; #1 (cover-dated May 1971), the black-and-white adventure fantasy magazine in which the character debuted in an 11-page origin story, the Man-Thing was conceived in discussions between Marvel Comics editor Stan Lee and writer Roy Thomas. Together they created five possible origins for the character. Lee provided the name, which had previously been used for unrelated creatures in Marvel&#x27;s early science-fiction/fantasy anthology &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot; #7 (January 1960) and #81 (September 1966), as well as the concept of the man losing sentience.

As Thomas recalled in 2002:
Thomas worked out a detailed plot and gave it to Gerry Conway to script. Thomas and Conway are credited as writers, with Gray Morrow as artist. A second story, written by Len Wein and drawn by Neal Adams, was prepared at that time, but, upon &quot;Savage Tales&quot;&#x27; cancellation after that single issue, &quot;took a year or two to see print&quot;, according to Thomas. That occurred in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #12 (June 1972), in which the seven-page story was integrated in its entirety within the 21-page feature &quot;Ka-Zar&quot;, starring Marvel&#x27;s jungle-lord hero. This black-and-white interlude (with yellow highlighting) segued to the Man-Thing&#x27;s introduction to color comics as Ka-Zar&#x27;s antagonist-turned-ally in this and the following issue (both written by Thomas, with the first penciled by John Buscema and the second by Buscema and Rich Buckler).

The Wein-written Man-Thing story appeared in between Wein&#x27;s first and second version of his DC Comics character the Swamp Thing. Wein was Conway&#x27;s roommate at the time and as Thomas recalled in 2008,

The Man-Thing received his own 10-page feature, again by Conway (with Morrow inking pencils by Howard Chaykin), in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #10 (Oct. 1972), sharing that anthology title with reprinted 1950s horror/fantasy stories. Steve Gerber, who would become the Man-Thing&#x27;s signature writer, succeeded Conway the following issue, with art by Rich Buckler (Mayerik began with issue #13). The feature expanded to 15 pages with #12 (art by Jim Starlin), became 16 pages two issues later and reached the then-standard 19-page length of Marvel superhero comics with issue #15, at which point the series also went from bi-monthly to monthly. In &quot;Fear&quot; #11 (Dec. 1972), p. 11, Gerber created the series&#x27; narrative tagline, used in captions: &quot;Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing&#x27;s touch!&quot;
After issue #19 (Dec. 1973), the Man-Thing received a solo title &quot;The Man-Thing&quot;, which ran 22 issues (Jan. 1974–Oct. 1975). Following Morrow, the main series&#x27; primary pencillers were, successively, Val Mayerik, Mike Ploog, John Buscema, and Jim Mooney.

 A sister publication was the larger, quarterly &quot;Giant-Size Man-Thing&quot; #1-5 (Aug. 1974–Aug. 1975), which featured 1950s horror-fantasy and 1960s science fiction/monster reprints as back-up stories, with a two-part Howard the Duck co-feature added in the final two issues. The unintentional double entendre in this sister series&#x27; title has become a recurring joke among comics readers.

In the final issue (#22), writer Gerber appeared as a character in the story, claiming that he had not been inventing the Man-Thing&#x27;s adventures but simply reporting on them and that he had decided to move on. Gerber continued to write Man-Thing guest appearances in other Marvel titles, as well as the serialized, eight-page Man-Thing feature in the omnibus series &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #1-12 (Sept. 1988–Feb. 1989), and a supporting role in &quot;The Evolutionary War&quot;, coming to the aid of Spider-Man. Gerber also wrote a graphic novel that Kevin Nowlan spent many years illustrating, but he did not live to see it published.

A second &quot;Man-Thing&quot; series ran 11 issues (Nov. 1979–Jan. 1981). Writer Michael Fleisher and penciller Mooney teamed for the first three issues, with the letters page of #3 noting that Fleisher&#x27;s work had received a great deal of negative criticism and that he had been taken off the book. He was succeeded by, primarily, writer Chris Claremont and illustrators Don Perlin (breakdowns) and Bob Wiacek (finished pencils). Claremont&#x27;s stories introduced the Man-Thing and Jennifer Kale to Doctor Strange (whose series he was concurrently writing), after which his material focused on two new supporting characters: John Daltry, Citrusville&#x27;s new sheriff, and Bobbie Bannister, a formerly wealthy girl who is the only survivor when her parents&#x27; yacht is attacked. These characters&#x27; stories he resolved by tying them to a resolution for his own &quot;War is Hell&quot; series.

Black and white Man-Thing stories, and some color covers, also appeared in the Marvel magazine &quot;Monsters Unleashed&quot; as well.

Simon Jowett provided a Man-Thing story in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #164–168 (Early Oct.–Late Nov. 1994). The story was set soon after Sallis&#x27; transformation, yet depicted Sallis using a standard personal computer with up-to-date graphics rather than hard-copy files, an example of the floating timeline effect.

J.M. DeMatteis began writing the character in a backup story in &quot;Man-Thing&quot; vol. 2 #9 (March 1981), which opened with a fill-in by Dickie McKenzie. DeMatteis would go on to write Man-Thing stories in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot;, &quot;The Defenders&quot;, &quot;Marvel Fanfare&quot;, and the miniseries &quot;Daydreamers&quot;, as well as &quot;Man-Thing&quot; vol. 3 #1-8 (Dec. 1997–July 1998), illustrated by Liam Sharp. The two would re-team for the Man-Thing feature in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 4 #1-2 (Sept.–Oct. 1998). Four issues were written, but #3 and 4 were never published. Their stories were summarized briefly in &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man Annual &#x27;99&quot;, also by DeMatteis, with art by Sharp and others.

In the 2000s, the Man-Thing has starred in a handful of stories appearing in one-shots and miniseries, including &quot;Marvel Knights Double Shot&quot; #2 (July 2002) by Ted McKeever, and &quot;Legion of Monsters: Man-Thing&quot; #1 (May 2007) by Charlie Huston and Klaus Janson.

In 2008, writer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa retold Man-Thing&#x27;s origin in &quot;Dead of Night featuring the Man-Thing&quot; #1-4 (April–July 2008), from the Marvel MAX imprint. This was followed by an eight-page story in &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; (vol. 2) #12 (Oct. 2008), by writer Jai Nitz and artist Ben Stenbeck.

The Man-Thing appeared regularly during The Punisher&#x27;s &quot;Franken-Castle&quot; story arc and became a regular member of &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; with issue #144. The series was retitled &quot;Dark Avengers&quot; with #175, and the Man-Thing continued to appear as a regular character until issue #183. Steve Gerber&#x27;s posthumous Man-Thing story &quot;The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man&quot;, with art by Kevin Nowlan, originally planned as a 1980s graphic novel before being left uncompleted by the artist, was revived in the 2010s and appeared as a three-issue miniseries cover-titled &quot;The Infernal Man-Thing&quot; (Early Sept.-Oct. 2012). The story was a sequel to Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man&quot; in &quot;Man-Thing&quot; #12 (Dec. 1974).

Author R.L. Stine made his comics debut with a five-issue &quot;Man-Thing&quot; miniseries in 2017.

==Fictional character biography==
Young biochemist Dr. Theodore &quot;Ted&quot; Sallis, a native of Omaha, Nebraska, is working in the Everglades as part of Dr. Wilma Calvin&#x27;s Project: Gladiator team, which includes Dr. Barbara Morse and her fiancé Dr. Paul Allen, and an assistant named Jim. A Dr. Wendell is later cited as being on the staff after Dr. Calvin is shot. The group is attempting to recreate the Super-Soldier Serum that had created Captain America. &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; vol. 2 #6 revealed that Sallis at one point treated and worked alongside Dr. Curtis Connors shortly after Connors&#x27; arm was amputated, driving the research that would eventually transform Connors into the Lizard.

Though warned that the technological terrorist group Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.) has been operating in the area, Sallis breaches security by bringing with him his lover, Ellen Brandt (referred to here as &quot;Miss Brandt&quot;, but later retconned to be his wife). He destroys his notes to his formula, which he has memorized. Later, he is ambushed by two thugs and learns that Brandt has betrayed him. Fleeing with the only sample of his serum, he injects himself with it in hopes of saving himself. However, he crashes his car into the swamp where scientific and, as &quot;Man-Thing&quot; #1 later explained, magical forces combine to instantly transform him into a slow-moving plant-matter creature with large, solid red eyes. Unable to speak, and with dim memories, he attacks the ambushers and Brandt, burning and scarring part of her face with an acid that he now secretes in the presence of negative emotions. The Man-Thing then wanders away into the swamp.

Sallis&#x27; mind was extinguished, although on rare occasions he could briefly return to consciousness within his monstrous form, as in &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; vol. 2 #41 (June 1980), &quot;The Defenders&quot; #98 (Aug. 1981), and &quot;Peter Parker: Spider-Man&quot; Annual &#x27;99, and even to his human form, as in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #13 (April 1973), &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #1 (Jan. 1974), &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; #164 (Oct. 1994), and &quot;Man-Thing&quot; vol. 3 #5 and 7-8 (April 1998, June–July 1998).

Under writer Steve Gerber, the Man-Thing encounters the sorceress Jennifer Kale, with whom he briefly shared a psychic link and who knew his true identity, in a story arc in &quot;Fear&quot; #11-13 – the final issue of which established that the swamp had mystical properties as the Nexus of Realities. Through an interdimensional portal in &quot;Fear&quot; #19, he meets Howard the Duck, who becomes stranded in this reality. The Man-Thing became the guardian of the Nexus, and found himself facing demons, ghosts and time-traveling warriors, while continuing to encounter such non-supernatural antagonists as rapacious land developers, fascist vigilantes and common criminals. He formed a bond with young radio DJ Richard Rory and nurse Ruth Hart. Issue #12&#x27;s &quot;Song-Cry of the Living Dead Man&quot;, about a crazed writer named Brian Lazarus, spawned Gerber&#x27;s posthumously published 2012 sequel, &quot;The Screenplay of the Living Dead Man&quot;, in the three-issue miniseries &quot;The Infernal Man-Thing&quot;.

In &quot;Man-Thing&quot; vol. 2 #1-11 (Nov. 1979–July 1981), writer Chris Claremont introduced himself as a character in the final issue, as Gerber had in the finale of the first series. Additionally, Claremont temporarily &quot;became&quot; the Man-Thing after being stabbed to death. His and other characters&#x27; deaths were later resolved with the intervention of the &quot;War Is Hell&quot; series lead, John Kowalski, now an aspect of Marvel Comics&#x27; manifestation of Death. In &quot;Man-Thing&quot; vol. 3 #1-8 (Dec. 1997–July 1998), Ellen Brandt Sallis returns to the Citrusville area and encounters a little boy, Job Burke, who is actually the Sallises&#x27; son, who had been put up for adoption. Following this series, the story continued in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; vol. 4 #1-2, and was projected to continue in the unpublished issues #3-4. Summaries based on DeMatteis&#x27; unillustrated scripts appear on the K&#x27;Ad-mon and Ellen Brandt pages in &quot;Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe&quot;.

During the &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, two S.H.I.E.L.D. agents unsuccessfully attempt to register the Man-Thing under the Superhuman Registration Act.

The Man-Thing later appears as a member of the Legion of Monsters alongside Morbius, the Werewolf by Night, the Manphibian, and N&#x27;Kantu, the Living Mummy. He later gains the ability to speak comprehensibly through the use of the &quot;Universal Language&quot;. Phil Coulson subsequently recruits the Man-Thing for his incarnation of the Howling Commandos.

As part of the All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, the Man-Thing appears as a member of S.T.A.K.E.&#x27;s Howling Commandos.

During the &quot;Empyre&quot; storyline, Man-Thing falls under the control of the Cotati led by Ventri that were operating in the Savage Land. Doctor Voodoo takes control of Man-Thing to free Matthew and Black Knight. As Matthew and Black Knight fight the Cotati, a Doctor Voodoo-controlled Man-Thing fights the Cotati&#x27;s control and defeats Ventri. As Doctor Voodoo exits Man-Thing to assist Scarlet Witch after Ka-Zar was stabbed by a Cotati using Black Knight&#x27;s Ebony Blade, Man-Thing continued the fight against the Cotati. When the Cotati were defeated, Man-Thing takes his leave after being thanked by Black Knight. Ventri claims that what they learned from Man-Thing&#x27;s energy has been sent to Quoi to fuel the Cotati&#x27;s invasion.

Harriet Brome, an agent of the self-proclaimed eco-warriors the Hordeculture, adopts the name &quot;Harrower&quot; and attempts to use Man-Thing to perform a mass culling of humanity, intending to purge the human race and let another species take over. To this end, she attacks and skins the Man-Thing and uses his corpse to produce seedling spores that will emerge in all major cities across the world and burn their victims. When the Avengers respond, Captain America is briefly absorbed by one of the spores, where he meets the remnants of Ted Sallis, who explains that he never truly cracked the super-soldier serum. He attempts to get Cap to contact Connors for help, but when Connors affirms that he can&#x27;t help, Spider-Man convinces Sallis to take responsibility for his past. After Sallis&#x27;s essence creates a new body for Man-Thing, Man-Thing returns to Sallis&#x27;s old office, where it is revealed that Sallis made a deal with the demon Belasco to crack the formula. When he performs the ritual again, he summons Magik, the new ruler of Limbo, who offers to release Sallis from his current state. Understanding that his freedom would leave Man-Thing an uncontrolled creature of instinct, Sallis agrees to remain and joins Magik&#x27;s strike team in attacking Harrower. After banishing Harrower to another dimension and destroying her spore-plants, Magik later summons Belasco so that Sallis can properly punish the demon for his role in Sallis&#x27;s fate.

Man-Thing appeared as a teacher at Strange Academy where he teaches Care for Magical Plants.

==Powers and abilities==

Though the beast now lacks a normal human intellect and has shed any desire to communicate with human society, it nevertheless often becomes an accidental hero as it stumbles upon various crime and horror scenarios.

In the pages of &quot;The Thunderbolts&quot;, Hank Pym has expressed the view that the Man-Thing is sentient, though difficult to communicate with. For example, he once rescued an infant and left the child with a doctor (which would require an understanding of the function of a doctor and the ability to navigate to a specific address). He is shown to understand concepts such as how to ring a doorbell, how to put an arm in a sling, and even how to flip an auto-destruct switch. The change in the Man-Thing&#x27;s intellect can partly be explained by fact that its brain, sensory organs, and central nervous system are now organized in a completely different fashion than a human&#x27;s; for instance, the Man-Thing&#x27;s auditory receptors are in his forehead. Regardless of what level of humanity the creature still possesses, it can discern when a person&#x27;s motivations are evil, which causes it pain and motivates it to lash out.

The Man-Thing possesses a variety of superhuman powers that are derived from the combined interaction of the scientific formula created by Ted Sallis and the mystical energies of the Nexus of All Realities.

It can sense human emotions, and is enraged by fear and automatically secretes a powerful corrosive; anyone feeling fear and clutched by the Man-Thing is prone to be burned (either chemically or mystically), hence the series&#x27; tagline: &quot;Whatever knows fear burns at the Man-Thing&#x27;s touch!&quot;. Though fear is understandably most people&#x27;s response to the creature, both for his monstrous appearance and the physical danger of his touch, typically only villains end up meeting an immolating death at its hands. Many survive being burned, notably Ellen Brandt, Nightcrawler, and Mongu, either due to intervention or dissipation. Unusual psychic and mystical forces react in what passes as the &quot;brain&quot; cells located throughout his body. These unique forces render the Man-Thing extremely sensitive to emotions. Emotions that are mild and generally considered positive arouse curiosity and the Man-Thing will sometimes observe from a distance. However, emotions that are often viewed as negative, such as violent emotions like anger, hatred, and fear, cause the Man-Thing great discomfort and might provoke him to attack. Once provoked into violent actions, his body secretes highly concentrated acid that can burn human beings to ashes within a matter of seconds. Even individuals that have high levels of superhuman durability have proven unable to withstand the acid. While the Man-Thing is devoid of violent emotions, his body produces mucus that neutralizes the acid.

Although the Man-Thing&#x27;s superhuman strength, speed, intelligence, durability, and immortality, give the monster his powers it is his spiritual ability that makes him immune to any other disease, it has been established that the creature possesses physical stamina beyond the limitations of any human athlete. Initially, the Man-Thing is only slightly stronger than Captain America, but in later appearances, the Man-Thing possesses sufficient superhuman strength to stand toe-to-toe with much stronger villains. He can lift a automobile when sufficiently motivated.

The Man-Thing&#x27;s body is practically invulnerable to harm. Because his body is not entirely solid, but composed of the muck and vegetative matter of the swamp, fists, bullets, knives, energy blasts, etc. will either pass entirely through him or will harmlessly be lodged within his body. Even if a vast portion of the Man-Thing&#x27;s body were to be ripped away or incinerated, he would be able to reorganize himself by drawing the necessary material from the surrounding vegetation. The Devil-Slayer once sliced him nearly in half, and he has survived being incinerated by a Celestial, although his healing from the latter has been the longest and most complex in his lifetime.

Due to the construction of his body, the Man-Thing can ooze his body through openings or around barriers that would seem too small for him to pass through. The smaller the opening, the longer it will take for him to reorganize his mass upon reaching the other side. This ability can be defeated mystically.

The Man-Thing was once dependent upon the swamp he inhabits for his continued survival; his body would slowly weaken and eventually lapse into dormancy if not returned to the swamp or would be greatly damaged if exposed to clean water. His exposure to the Citrusville waste treatment plant greatly enhanced his ability to leave the swamp, as he became a self-contained ecosystem, feeding off of his own waste products. He generally leaves the swamp of his own accord only if he senses a mystical disturbance. The Man-Thing has also demonstrated himself susceptible to possession by other entities.

The Man-Thing and a host of alternate counterparts have undergone a couple of changes in form, like having the ability to control and alternate plant matter both from its own person and the surrounding area. The Man-Thing also has trans-reality shifting abilities due in part to his nature as a living extra-dimensional crossroads; he can open portals to and from alternate realities, interact with different dimensional counterparts and even alternate the physical appearances of said doppelgangers with those of their prime universe iterations. Through his empathic abilities, the Man-Thing can grow more powerful by feeding on the fear of others, increasing his size and mass to titanic proportions during &quot;Fear Itself&quot;.

Although the Man-Thing lacks a normal human intellect, in his life as Ted Sallis, he possessed a Ph.D. in biochemistry. Sallis is legally dead, but his identity is known to numerous living people, including Wilma Calvin, Ellen Brandt, Stephen Strange, Owen Reece, Ben Grimm, Thog the Nether-Spawn, Jennifer Kale, and anyone they may have told or written to about it. His identity as the Man-Thing could not be considered secret, but his existence is generally believed to be a hoax, and an obscure one at that. In-universe, knowledge of his existence is rarely tied to the experiments of Sallis, as are speculations as to any human identity he may have had. Despite having appeared in Citrusville many times, many there still believe him to be a rumor.

==Other known Man-Things==
There were other known Man-Things in the comics besides Ted Sallis that appear in order of appearance:

===Savage Land&#x27;s Man-Thing===
In the pages of &quot;Savage Wolverine&quot; as part of the &quot;Marvel NOW!&quot; branding, a different Man-Thing appeared where it resided on a mysterious island somewhere in the Savage Land. Amadeus Cho confirmed that this Man-Thing is not Ted Sallis as it has been rooted on the island for a long time. The Neanderthals on the island used the blood of this Man-Thing to resurrect Shanna the She-Devil.

===Weirdworld&#x27;s Man-Things===
During the &quot;Secret Wars&quot; storyline, a bunch of Man-Things reside on the Battleworld domain of Weirdworld where they are found in the Forest of the Man-Things. The Man-Things encounter Arkon and Skull the Slayer after they fell into their area. The Man-Things are ruled over by the Swamp Queen of the Man-Things (the Earth-11234 version of Jennifer Kale) who is behind the rebellion against the Witch Queen Morgan le Fay.

One Man-Thing that was nicknamed &quot;Mossy&quot; had mated with a Crystal Warrior named Blythir. They had a hybrid son named Toth who is a student at the Strange Academy.

===She-Man-Thing===
&quot;Deadpool&#x27;s Secret Secret Wars&quot; revealed the existence of the She-Man-Thing, a character that fought on the Grandmaster&#x27;s team in a bonus round of the Contest of Champions.

===Roxxon&#x27;s Man-Thing===
Roxxon Energy Corporation had created a spawn of the Man-Thing as Dario Agger has its abilities enhanced with the DNA of Groot. When Weapon H is in the Redwood National Forest, Dario orders Dr. Baines to unleash the spawn. Roxxon&#x27;s Man-Thing attacks Clayton, who transforms into Weapon H. Eventually, Weapon H sets off the Man-Thing&#x27;s immolation ability enough to start a forest fire. When in the presence of Sonia Sung and Dr. Ella Sterling, Weapon H used his power clap to defeat Roxxon&#x27;s Man-Thing enough to put out the forest fire. This same Man-Thing was held in a cage with the Brood-infected human Blake in a Roxxon facility as they are freed by Weapon H. When it was revealed that Roxxon had opened a portal to Weirdworld, the Man-Thing took his leave, as Blake claims that he will find a pond to settle in. When the Skrullduggers emerge from the portal and start attacking the nearby humans, the Man-Thing and Blake assist Weapon H in fighting them until it was discovered that the Skrullduggers are shapeshifters. After the Man-Thing secures the defeated Skrullduggers, he is later sent with Blake to keep more Skrullduggers from emerging from the portal. When Weapon H and Dario later check up on them, it was discovered that they had some help in defeating the Skrullduggers from Korg. When the Man-Thing agreed to help in fighting the Skrullduggers, Blake asked him if he had a human form, which the Man-Thing does not respond to. As Weapon H leads the mission to Weirdworld, they are attacked by a tribe of blue-skinned humanoids called the Inaku, who blame them for breaking the Earth and allowing the Skrullduggers to take their queen. After Weapon H got free and Titania knocked Protector Hara into the protective dome enough to damage it, the Man-Thing helps to fortify it as Korg and Titania are assigned to help the Man-Thing protect the Inaku village. When the Skrullduggers attack, the Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania assist the Inaku in defending their fortified village from the Skrullduggers, until they suddenly go in one direction. The Man-Thing, Korg, and Titania find Weapon H with the Skrullduggers under Morgan le Fay&#x27;s control, so they attack the Inaku village, as they recognize Morgan le Fay of Earth-15238 as their queen. When Morgan le Fay orders Protector Hara to assist Weapon H and the Skrullduggers in attacking those who were sent by Roxxon, the Man-Thing goes on the defense to protect his allies. As the Minotaur fights Morgan le Fay, the Man-Thing is among those who are evacuated through the portal. After Dario pays them the terms of their contract, Titania takes Blake, Korg, and the Man-Thing out to a burger joint down the street.

===Boy-Thing===
Xarus got a piece of the original Man-Thing to grow his own similar creature called the Boy-Thing. Boy-Thing spent all of his time on Xarus&#x27; shoulder as he supplied him with sticks to use against the vampires. After Xarus was killed by Blade, the latter took Boy-Thing as his own.

==Comic book character spin-offs==
Dr. Barbara &quot;Bobbi&quot; Morse was introduced in the second Man-Thing story by Len Wein/Neal Adams, although because of publication delays, she was introduced in &quot;Astonishing Tales&quot; #6, with the Wein/Adams story presented as flashback. Morse became the costumed hero Mockingbird in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #95 and went on to become a prominent member of Avengers West Coast, eventually sacrificing her life to save her husband, Clint &quot;Hawkeye&quot; Barton, from Mephisto. Until recently, her spirit fought alongside Daimon Hellstrom to eliminate demons from his version of Hell; however, she has appeared alive during the &quot;Secret Invasion&quot; crossover event. At the end of &quot;Secret Invasion&quot;, Mockingbird was revealed to be alive and had been one of the early captures of the Skrulls. Morse has joined the New Avengers and has had adventures alongside Hawkeye.

Jennifer Kale debuted in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #11, which was the first story Steve Gerber wrote for Marvel after his initial tryout. She went on to appear in two team books, &quot;The Legion of Night&quot;, created and written by Gerber and partially composed of several other Gerber-created supporting cast members such as Martin Gold and Dr. Katherine Reynolds, and Bronwyn Carlton and Bryan Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Witches&quot; in which she teamed with Satana the Devil&#x27;s Daughter and Topaz under the tutelage of Doctor Strange.

Gerber introduced Howard the Duck in a Man-Thing story in &quot;Adventure into Fear&quot; #19. Howard, who was displaced from Duckworld, an alternate Earth of anthropomorphic ducks in another dimension, via the swamp&#x27;s Nexus of Realities, later acquired his own series, which was written by Gerber for the first 27 issues.

The Foolkiller, a vigilante who used a ray-gun to disintegrate not only criminals but anyone that he considered foolish, was introduced in issue #3 of this series, bent on slaying disc jockey Richard Rory, introduced in the previous issue. When Rory was serving time for trumped-up kidnapping charges, he accidentally created another Foolkiller when he revealed too much detail about the previous incarnation and the whereabouts of his gear. This Foolkiller became an occasional villain in other Marvel comics. Both Rory and this second Foolkiller, along with nurse Ruth Hart (who appeared in &quot;Man-Thing&quot; (vol. 1) #2-7) were supporting characters in Gerber&#x27;s &quot;Omega the Unknown&quot;, while David Anthony Kraft made Rory a potential love interest for the She-Hulk. A third version of the character, who was in Internet communication with the second, starred in Gerber&#x27;s 1990 &quot;Foolkiller&quot; miniseries. A second series by Greg Hurwitz, featuring a fourth Foolkiller, appeared in 2008.

==Other versions==
===&quot;Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe&quot;===
The Man-Thing appears in the last issue and appears to be standing guard over all creation. It ultimately accepts Deadpool&#x27;s plan and kills the Taskmaster.

===Earth-91===
On Earth-91, everyone in that reality is a Man-Thing. The Multiversal Masters of Evil arrive on Earth-91 where they massacre this reality&#x27;s Prehistoric Avengers. Unbeknownst to the Multiversal Masters of Evil, Doom Supreme secretly saved a Man-Thing variation of Doctor Doom called Doom-Thing where it swore its allegiance to him alongside the other variations of Doctor Doom.

===Earth-691===
&quot;Amazing Adventures&quot; (vol. 2) #38 tells the story of what happened when Killraven stumbled across the Miami Museum of Cultural Development and became caught up in the projected dreams of an astronaut from the &quot;Mars launch in 1999&quot;. During the hallucination, Killraven encountered distorted versions of numerous Marvel characters. Rather ambiguously, the awakened astronaut later described the figures as &quot;all the heroes from my youth&quot; but he also often referred to them as &quot;myths&quot;. The only Marvel character that is definitely &quot;real&quot; in the projected nightmare is the Man-Thing, who appears as part of an actual memory of an encounter that the astronaut had with the creature in the Florida Everglades.

===Earth-11234===
The Champions encounter a Man-Thing that lives in Mbali, Tanzania. During their mission to Weirdworld, it is revealed that this Man-Thing is a version of Ted Sallis who came from Earth-11234 and that he was part of the Swamp Queen Alliance led by his world&#x27;s version of Jennifer Kale.

===&quot;Marvel Super Hero Squad&quot;===
The Man-Thing appears in issue #10 of &quot;Marvel Super Hero Squad&quot;.

===&quot;Mutant X&quot;===
The &quot;Mutant X&quot; comic book series depicts a Marvel Universe in which characters&#x27; counterparts are vastly different. In the &quot;Mutant X Annual &#x27;99&quot; (1999), Doctor Strange, the sorcerer supreme of Earth, reveals himself to be the Man-Thing. He returns in &quot;Mutant X Annual &#x27;01&quot; (2001), and &quot;Mutant X&quot; #32 (June 2001).

===&quot;The Adventures of the X-Men&quot;===
In &quot;The Adventures of the X-Men&quot;, which is based on the &quot;X-Men&quot; animated series, Storm and Jean Grey are inadvertently teleported to the Man-Thing&#x27;s swamp from the Mojoverse. The three battle D&#x27;Spayre, who appears as a fake preacher trying to lead people up a suicide tower that is drawing energy out of the Nexus of All Realities. D&#x27;Spayre, working for the Dweller-in-Darkness, is burned by the Man-Thing when he fears failure. After their defeat of D&#x27;Spayre, Jean makes a psychic link with the Man-Thing (which she had done earlier to learn his origin) and is imparted information that she believes is the most important thing in the world. Jean is forced to become the Phoenix once more, using the information obtained from the Man-Thing, destroys the M&#x27;Kraan Crystal, and in doing so, ends the universe. However, one survivor is sent into the universe to come, Galactus, thereby implying that the animation continuity takes place eons before the mainstream Marvel continuity.

===&quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot;===
The &quot;Ultimate Marvel&quot; incarnation of Man-Thing is similar to his traditional counterpart in mainstream continuity. In his first appearance, he teamed with Spider-Man in &quot;Ultimate Marvel Team Up&quot; #10, unwittingly saving the superhero from the Lizard.

Additionally, in &quot;Ultimate Fantastic Four&quot; #7 during a flashback that transformed Reed Richards and his colleagues into the Fantastic Four, the Man-Thing is shown for a moment.

===&quot;What If&quot;===
Man-Thing was seen in different issues of &quot;What If&quot;:

In the story, an alligator that Dr. Oheimer was working on became the new Man-Thing while Sallis self-immolated at his own fear while fighting it.

* &quot;What If&quot; (vol. 2) #11 (March 1990) featured the Fantastic Four in four scenarios written and pencilled by Jim Valentino, showing what might have happened if the team-members had all had the same powers as one another.

<text>The Pontiac Trans Sport is a minivan that was marketed by Pontiac from the 1990 to 1999 model years. The first minivan marketed by the division, the Trans Sport marked the beginning of a wider transition of moving away from sedans and station wagons as family-oriented vehicles. Marketed between the Chevrolet Lumina APV (the first front-wheel drive Chevrolet minivan) and the Oldsmobile Silhouette (like the Trans Sport, the first minivan by the brand) took its name from a similar 1986 concept vehicle. 

The first-generation Trans Sport took on a &quot;Dustbuster&quot; nickname for its controversial front body styling (with a long front overhang); the second-generation version, much like several other model lines, marked an industry shift towards adopting a form factor similar to that used by the Chrysler minivans. Officially designated a U-platform vehicle, both generations of the Trans Sport share mechanical commonality and shared componentry with the W platform Pontiac Grand Prix. 

The Trans Sport was initially assembled at North Tarrytown Assembly (Tarrytown/Sleepy Hollow, New York), shifting production to Doraville Assembly (Doraville, Georgia) for its second generation. For the 1998 model year, Pontiac renamed the Trans Sport the Pontiac Montana, after an exterior trim package introduced in 1997. 

==Background==
Following the 1984 model-year release of the Chrysler minivans, General Motors responded with the release of the Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari for the 1985 model year. Though initially comparable to the Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager in length and wheelbase, the Astro/Safari were heavier-duty vehicles, sharing components with compact pickup trucks and full-size cars. Though the GM minivans were widely accepted in the marketplace (alongside the competitive Ford Aerostar, both passenger and cargo van variants were marketed), the Astro/Safari did not secure as wide of market share as the initial Chrysler model lines. 

To compete more closely against the Caravan/Voyager, General Motors began development of a front-wheel drive minivan for the 1990s. Prior to the 1986 debut of the concept car (see below), General Motors approved the design of what would become the APV minivans, with the Trans Sport (loosely deriving its name from the Trans Am Firebird) targeting sport- and style-oriented buyers, while the Chevrolet Lumina APV serving as the value-based offering, and the Oldsmobile Silhouette targeting premium markets. 

=== 1986 concept car ===

At the 1986 Chicago Auto show, General Motors released the Pontiac Trans Sport concept vehicle. Derived from the chassis of the mid-size Pontiac 6000, the Trans Sport concept was nearly 6 inches lower than the Plymouth Voyager of the time. To give the vehicle a far more contemporary exterior, the Trans Sport was styled with blacked-out A-pillars and upswept B-pillars (giving the front row the look of a wraparound windshield). In place of a traditional curbside sliding door, the concept car was designed with a right-side gull-wing door (the driver-side window line was fitted with wraparound glass from the B-pillar to the liftgate). Much of the roof was glass; at its widest point, the headliner was only 36 inches wide. Though highly unlikely for production, the Trans Sport was designed with multifunction taillamps; in addition to traditional red brake lamps and white/clear reverse lamps, the units added amber for deceleration. 

The interior of the Trans Sport previewed the 1990s integration of technology into GM vehicles (including multiple Pontiacs), featuring a windshield heads-up display, a multifunction steering wheel, and a primitive form of what later would become OnStar; along with a digital rearview mirror and electronic transmission shifter, and a Nintendo Entertainment System was integrated for the rear passenger compartment. 

Though deriving its chassis from the 6000 sedan/wagon, the Trans Sport concept car was fitted with a 235hp turbocharged 2.9L V6 (intended for a stillborn version of the Pontiac Fiero), paired with a 3-speed automatic. 17-inch wheels (the same diameter as the later Corvette ZR-1) were used, much larger than any other non-Firebird Pontiac vehicle of the time.

==First generation (1990-1996)==

Introduced for the 1990 model year, the Pontiac Trans Sport was introduced as the first Pontiac minivan; alongside the newly introduced Grand Prix four-door, the Trans Sport was phased in to replace the mid-size 6000.

Similar to the Ford Aerostar and Toyota Previa, the Trans Sport used a &quot;single-box&quot; body design, with the hood blending into the slope of the windshield. The long front overhang (resulting from the front-wheel drive chassis) of the body was poorly received, leading to the minivan being referred to as the &quot;Dustbuster&quot; (after the handheld vacuum cleaner). This status was carried over to two other minivans manufactured by different brands.

The last Trans Sport of this generation rolled off the assembly line on June 27, 1996, coinciding with the closure of the North Tarrytown Assembly plant shortly afterwards.

=== Chassis ===

The first-generation Trans Sport is a GM U platform vehicle, with GM moving to a specific GMT199 platform code. In contrast to the 1986 concept vehicle (which used a lengthened A-body chassis), the GMT199 architecture employed a galvanized steel space frame, similar in concept to the Pontiac Fiero and the Saturn SL/SW/SC. 

Anti-lock brakes (ABS) was added as a standard feature in 1992. For 1994, traction control was added as an option on 3.8 L vehicles. 

==== Powertrain details ====
In contrast to the turbocharged 2.9 L V6 engine of the 1986 Trans Sport concept, the production Trans Sport was fitted with a naturally-aspirated 3.1 L V6 producing , shared with the 6000 and Grand Prix; a three-speed automatic was the sole transmission offered. For 1992, a 3.8 L 3800 V6 with a 4-speed Hydra-Matic 4T60 transmission (adding an overdrive gear) was introduced. For 1996, Both the 3.1 L and 3.8 L V6 engines were replaced by a 3.4 L V6; the 3-speed transmission was retired.

=== Body ===
Though sharing nearly all exterior body panels, each GMT199 minivan was distinguished by its roofline styling. The Chevrolet Lumina APV debuted with a black roof forward of the B-pillar and a body-color rear roof; the Oldsmobile Silhouette, a blacked-out B-pillar with a body-color A-pillar and roofline. The Trans Sport was fitted with a largely black roof, with a body-color B-pillar; the extensive lower body cladding was a feature adopted from the 1986 concept car (and as part of Pontiac model tradition).

In following with its spaceframe construction, only the roof panel of the Trans Sport is made of steel, with all exterior vertical side body panels made from polymer plastic (similar to Saturns). In line with the concept car, the production Trans Sport has a large amount of slotted body cladding (to protect the body from dents). Though toned down extensively from its 1986 namesake concept, the production vehicle retained an upswept B-pillars, widely curved glass (used on all windows) with blacked-out window pillars. Along with the adoption of a full-width metal roof and the use of a sliding door, the largest styling change from the concept car saw a different set of taillamps, moving to a vertically-oriented design integrated in the D-pillars. For 1991, a sunroof became a new option; a year later, the external radio antenna was deleted (replaced by a design integrated between the roof and headliner). For 1992, the sideview mirrors were redesigned; along with growing in size, the units now were able to fold inward. 

Though the production Trans Sport interior did not adopt many of the high-technology features of the 1986 concept car, the model line debuted a modular set of rear seats. In place of the typical two full-length rear bench seats, the rear interior of Trans Sport could be configured in multiple ways to accommodate passengers and cargo, as the rear was fitted with five individual rear bucket seats. Three configurations were offered: five seats (2-3), six seats (2-2-2), and seven seats (2-3-2). 

For 1991, the dashboard was revised slightly, as non-reflective carpeted cloth was placed on the portion below the windshield (to reduce glare). In 1992, the Trans Sport adopted an interior feature from its namesake concept car, with steering-wheel radio controls becoming an option. 

==== 1994 revision ====
For 1994, all three GMT199 minivans underwent a mid-cycle revision, largely in response towards the negative critical response towards their exterior design. To further visually shorten the exterior from the three inches removed from the body length, designers installed a new hood (sharing headlights with the Pontiac Bonneville), restyled lower body cladding, and a new front bumper (with a larger, vertical front grille). The rear side glass received a darker tint (visually lengthening the vehicle from the side). As a market first, the Trans Sport (alongside its APV minivan counterparts) introduced a power-operated sliding door; originally slated for 1993 but was postponed until 1994 in order to fix quality-control issues related to the design. 

Coinciding with the addition of a driver-side airbag in the steering wheel (inherited from the Pontiac Grand Prix), the Trans Sport saw revisions to the dashboard; to make the forward edge of the windshield seem closer to the instrument panel, a ridged finishing panel was added. The rear seats were revised, with second-row seats receiving integrated child safety seats as an option. Air conditioning was made as standard equipment in 1996.

=== Trim ===

At its 1990 launch, the Pontiac Trans Sport was introduced in base Trans Sport trim (distinguished by silver lower body cladding) and the Trans Sport SE trim (body-color lower trim). For 1992, the trims were revised, as the base Trans Sport was discontinued and the sportier Trans Sport GT was introduced (with the 3.8L V6 standard); as part of the change, all Trans Sports became monochromatic. The GT also became the second APV minivan (besides the Oldsmobile Silhouette) available with leather seating (as an option). 

In 1993, the Trans Sport GT was dropped after a single year, with all examples becoming Trans Sport SEs for the rest of the generation (with body-color badging); the SE was offered with any content from the GT as an option. As a stand-alone exterior option, a gold-color exterior trim package was offered; with certain colors, gold wheels, badging, and lower body cladding was paired with a body-color upper roof. 

During 1995, the black-color roof that was standard (body-color was a no-cost option) was discontinued, bringing it closer in line with its GM counterparts and other minivans.

==Second generation (1997-1999)==
For the 1997 model year, Pontiac released the second-generation Trans Sport. In response to the controversial reception of the previous generation, GM redesigned its front-wheel drive minivans with a form factor closely matching the third-generation Chrysler minivans (released a year before), with the Trans Sport matched against the Dodge (Grand) Caravan. In contrast to the Ford Windstar, the second-generation Trans Sport was offered with two wheelbases, with single or dual sliding doors, and was offered through multiple brands. 

Again serving as the mid-range GM minivan, the Trans Sport was slotted between the Chevrolet Venture (replacing the Lumina APV) and the Oldsmobile Silhouette. The model line introduced a Trans Sport Montana appearance package (see below); its popularity led Pontiac to rename its minivan line as the Pontiac Montana for 1999 (2000 in Canada). 

Following the closure of the North Tarrytown Assembly plant in late June 1996, assembly of the model line was shifted to the Doraville Assembly plant in Georgia; the facility closed on September 26, 2008.

=== Chassis ===
Considered a U-body vehicle by its VIN designation, the second-generation Trans Sport used the official GMT200 platform designation. The innovative chassis construction from the previous generation was abandoned, largely benchmarking the NS-generation Caravan/Voyager, moving to a more conventional steel unibody with steel body panels. Growing significantly in size, the Trans Sport was now offered in a standard 112-inch wheelbase (2.2 inches longer) and a 120-inch extended-wheelbase chassis (between the Ford Aerostar and the Ford Windstar as the longest-wheelbase minivan).

The suspension used front MacPherson struts along with rear coil springs. As with the previous generation, the Trans Sport was fitted with front disc brakes and rear drum brakes.

==== Powertrain details ====
The second-generation Trans Sport carried over the 3.4 L V6 engine from the previous-generation 1996 Trans Sport, with a 4-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment.

=== Body ===

Moving away from the controversial &quot;Dustbuster&quot; profile of the previous generation, the second-generation Trans Sport was designed with a two-box form factor similar (if not more conservative) than the Dodge Caravan it competed most closely against. 

As with the previous generation, the Trans Sport was distinguished from its divisional counterparts by Pontiac lower body cladding (dependent on trim, either in a contrasting or matching color). The traditional Pontiac split grille was enlarged and relocated between the headlamps (a change made for all GMT200 vehicles). The Trans Sport adopted a blacked-out B-pillar (shared with the Chevrolet Venture) for a blacked-out window line. 

Reflecting the closer-coupled windshield angle (with a conventional A-pillar taking the place of fixed quarter glass), the interior featured a more conservative dashboard layout, with reduced surface area between the instrument panel and windshield edge. The Trans Sport shared its steering wheel and various switchgear from the Grand Prix (itself redesigned for 1997), with the minivan having its own instrument cluster. 

Though the seats were completely redesigned, the modular seating feature of the previous generation made its return in two different configurations: eight passengers (2-3-3) and seven passengers (2-2-3, 2-3-2). In addition, the Trans Sport was available with rear bench seats (split or full-length) in a 2-2-3 configuration. 

The GMT200 minivans adopted dual front airbags on the dashboard, with front-seat side airbags introduced in 1998 as a standard feature. As an option, the 1998 Trans Sport was the first minivan (alongside its divisional counterparts) to feature the OnStar telecommunications service (a modernized version of the system previewed in the 1986 concept car). 

=== Trim ===
The Pontiac Trans Sport was initially offered in short wheelbase and long wheelbase versions and either one or two sliding doors; in 1998, two sliding doors became standard on all extended-wheelbase versions. The standard trim was simply named as the Pontiac Trans Sport, distinguished primarily by monochrome exteriors (or light-color body cladding). The Pontiac Trans Sport Montana was the flagship trim, styled for a more rugged look. In addition to using exclusive gray/tan body cladding and standard alloy wheels (with white-letter tires), the Montana was specified with &quot;sport&quot; suspension tuning, and load-leveling suspension (adding a rear-mounted air inflator).

The Montana trim level quickly became the most popular version of the Trans Sport line, accounting for over 80% of total Trans Sport sales. In 1998, Pontiac renamed its minivan as the Pontiac Montana in the United States (1999 in Canada).

===Safety criticism===

In 1996, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tested a 1997 Pontiac Trans Sport among other minivans of the time. The minivan suffered extreme damage to the vehicle in the moderate overlap crash test, which has resulted in some criticism by contemporary reviewers. The minivan received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating and was ranked as the &quot;Worst Performing Vehicle&quot; by the institute as a result. This status was also applied to the Chevrolet Venture and the Oldsmobile Silhouette as they both use the same chassis and body design, including the later first-generation Pontiac Montana.

Some comments made by the IIHS after the first test in 1996 were:
* Major collapse of the occupant compartment left little survival space for the driver.
* Extreme steering wheel movement snapped the dummy&#x27;s head backward.
* The unnatural position of the dummy&#x27;s left foot indicates that an occupant&#x27;s left leg would have been seriously injured in a real-world crash of this severity.
* The forces on the left lower leg were so high that the dummy&#x27;s metal foot broke off at the ankle.

In a semi-related event, the Trans Sport/Montana&#x27;s European equivalent, the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra, also fared badly in Euro NCAP&#x27;s frontal impact crash test on a 1998 model year minivan, made worse by the steering wheel (and airbag) breaking off from the dashboard (a phenomenon that was not present in the IIHS test). Despite performing well in the side impact test, it rated 2.5 stars as a result.

The safety issues of the Trans Sport/Montana and its U-body siblings were later addressed with the Montana SV6 (and the related Uplander), which earned the highest rating of &quot;Good&quot; given by the institute in the moderate overlap crash test.

The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration gave the van 4 stars for driver protection and 3 stars for passenger protection in the frontal impact test. In the side impact test, it received 5 stars for front passenger protection, and 5 stars rear passenger protection. This applies to all other second-generation U-body minivans.

== Export versions ==
From 1990 to 2007, GM Europe imported two generations of US-produced minivans under the Trans Sport nameplate. The GMT199 Trans Sport was based on its American-market namesake (and the Oldsmobile Silhouette) and the GMT200 Trans Sport was a Chevrolet-brand vehicle based on the Pontiac Trans Sport (though adopting the body of the later Pontiac Montana, the nameplate was not used in Europe). 

===First generation (Pontiac/Oldsmobile)===

For European export, the Pontiac Trans Sport was the sole GMT199 minivan, sold primarily through Opel dealers. Several modifications were made to the design to bring the model line in compliance with European lighting regulations, with the rear lighting clusters receiving amber turn signals; the liftgate was fitted with rear foglamps and enlarged reverse lights, along with mounting for wider European license plates. For 1990 and 1991, the European Trans Sport was fitted with exposed quad headlamps (from the R/V Suburban), with amber turn signal repeaters housed in the clear turn signal lenses. For 1992, the American-style composite headlamp housing were introduced (with glass lenses), with the turn signal repeaters moved behind the front wheels. The export version also was fitted with four bumper-mounted headlamp washers (for both high and low beams), replaced by two for 1994. 

With the mid-cycle revision of the model line for 1994, the European Trans Sport largely became a Pontiac-badged version of the Oldsmobile Silhouette (retaining the previous hoodline and headlamps). Though the new Trans Sport retained its roofline styling, the model had lost nearly all its lower body cladding and its Pontiac grille (adopting an Oldsmobile-style split grille above the license plate). After the 1996 model year, the export Trans Sport moved to the GMT200 generation (shared with the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra) and was rebranded as a Chevrolet. 

The export Trans Sport was initially offered with a 2.3L Quad 4 (LD2) I4 engine paired with a 5-speed manual transmission (a combination never offered in North America); from 1992, the 3800 3.8L V6 and 4T60 4-speed automatic transmission was offered as an option. 


===Second generation (Chevrolet)===
The GMT200 generation of the Pontiac Trans Sport was introduced in Europe for 1997, branded as the Chevrolet Trans Sport. With the exception of badging and wheels (from the Chevrolet Venture), the Chevrolet Trans Sport was trimmed identically to its Pontiac namesake. As with the previous generation, the export model line differed from its American-market counterpart primarily in changes related to compliance with ECE regulations, requiring different front headlamps, turn signal repeaters, amber turn signals, and rear foglamps; different seat belts are required, along with multiple other safety-related items. 

On the GMT200 platform, both the Chevrolet and Pontiac Trans Sport (later Pontiac Montana) were designed alongside the Opel/Vauxhall Sintra (the first/only Opels built in the United States). Following the 1999 discontinuation of the Sintra in Europe, the Trans Sport largely served as its replacement. After GMT200 production ended after 2005, sales of European dealer stock continued through 2007. Despite limited sales in most of Europe, the Chevrolet Trans Sport was particularly successful in Sweden where it was the best selling minivan for a while.

<text>The 9th Infantry Division (nicknamed &quot;Old Reliables&quot;) is an inactive infantry division of the United States Army. It was formed as the 9th Division during World War I, but never deployed overseas. In later years it was an important unit of the U.S. Army during World War II and the Vietnam War. It was also activated as a peacetime readiness unit from 1947 to 1962 at Fort Dix, New Jersey as a Training Division, West Germany, and Fort Carson, Colorado as a Full Combat Status Division, and from 1972 to 1991 as an active-duty infantry division at Fort Lewis, Washington. The division was inactivated in December 1991.

==Insignia==
The shoulder sleeve insignia is an octofoil resembling a heraldic design given to the ninth son of a family. This represents the son as a circle in the middle with eight brothers around him. The blue represents the infantry, the red the artillery, with the white completing the colors of the flag of the United States of America.

==World War I==

The 9th Division was part of a group of six divisions (9th-14th) that the War Department directed to be formed in mid-1918 from Regular Army troops augmented by draftees. It was anticipated that the divisions&#x27; training would take four months, to be completed by the end of November 1918. 

The 9th Division was organized from July to September 1918 at Camp Sheridan, near Montgomery, Alabama. At the end of July, the strength of the division was approximately 8,000 officers and men, while during August, draftees sent from Camp Hancock, Georgia, Camp Meade, Maryland, Camp Zachary Taylor and Fort Thomas, Kentucky, Camp Upton and Fort Slocum, New York, Camp Travis, Texas, and other stations brought the strength to about 22,000. Peak strength was reached during September, with 25,000 officers and men. Systematic training began during August. On 28 October 1918, the division&#x27;s advance detachment moved to Camp Mills, New York, preparatory to movement overseas. After the signing of the armistice with Germany, all training was suspended and the advance detachment returned to Camp Sheridan. Demobilization of all emergency period personnel and units except the 45th and 46th Infantry was ordered on 17 January 1919. Demobilization was completed on 15 February 1919.

The division was commanded by Colonel Charles C. Clark (July 1918 - September 1918), Maj. Gen. Willard A. Holbrook (September 1918 - October 1918), Brig. Gen. James A. Ryan (October 1918 - November 1918) acting, Maj. Gen. Willard A. Holbrook (November 1918 - February 1919)

==Interwar period==

The 9th Division was reconstituted on 24 March 1923, allotted to the First Corps Area for mobilization responsibility, and assigned to the I Corps. Camp Devens, Massachusetts, was designated as the mobilization and training station for the division upon reactivation. The 18th Infantry Brigade and additional active and inactive elements were assigned to the division on 24 March 1923. The division’s inactive units were assigned to active associate units for mobilization purposes. During the period 1923–39, the 9th Division was represented in the active Army by the 18th Infantry Brigade and other assorted divisional elements that formed the base force from which the remainder of the division would be reactivated in the event of war. The division headquarters was organized on 28 July 1926 as a Regular Army Inactive (RAI) unit with Organized Reserve personnel at the Army Base, Boston, Massachusetts. In 1926-27, the active associate concept was abandoned and many of the division’s inactive elements were organized as RAI units by mid-1927 in the First and Second Corps Areas. The active elements of the division maintained habitual training relationships with divisional RAI units, as well as those of the I Corps, XI Corps, and the 76th, 94th, and 97th Divisions. The RAI and Reserve units often trained with the active elements of the division during summer training camps usually conducted at Camp Devens and Fort McKinley, Maine. 

The 18th Infantry Brigade&#x27;s 5th and 13th Infantry Regiments additionally supported the Reserve units’ conduct of the Citizens’ Military Training Camps also held at Camp Devens and Fort McKinley. When funds were available, the 18th Infantry Brigade and the division’s other active elements, which included the 9th Tank Company, 9th Ordnance Company, 9th Quartermaster Regiment, and 25th Field Artillery Regiment, held maneuvers and command post exercises at Camp Devens, during which the division headquarters was occasionally formed in a provisional status. The division headquarters was also provisionally formed in 1939 for the First Army maneuvers in upstate New York. Under the new “triangular” tables of organization, the 9th Division was reactivated, less Reserve personnel, on 1 August 1940 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and assigned to the I Corps. The division participated in the Carolina Maneuvers from September–November 1941.

=== Combat chronicle ===
The 9th Infantry Division was among the first U.S. combat units to engage in offensive ground operations during World War II. (The others were the 32nd and the 41st in the Pacific on New Guinea, Carlson&#x27;s Raiders on Makin Island, the 1st Marine, and the
Americal on Guadalcanal, and, alongside the 9th in North Africa, were the 1st Infantry, 3rd Infantry, 34th Infantry and the 2nd Armored Divisions.) The 9th saw its first combat on 8 November 1942, when its elements landed at Algiers, Safi, and Port Lyautey, with the taking of Safi by the 3rd Battalion of the 47th Infantry Regiment standing as the first liberation of a city from Axis control in World War II.

With the collapse of French resistance on 11 November 1942, the division patrolled the Spanish Moroccan border. The 9th returned to Tunisia in February and engaged in small defensive actions and patrol activity. On 28 March 1943 it launched an attack in southern Tunisia and fought its way north into Bizerte, 7 May. In August, the 9th landed at Palermo, Sicily, and took part in the capture of Randazzo and Messina.

Sent to England for further training, the division landed on Utah Beach on 10 June 1944 (D-day plus 4), cut off the Cotentin Peninsula, drove on to Cherbourg Harbour and penetrated the port&#x27;s heavy defenses.

Following a brief rest in July, the division took part in the St. Lo break-through and in August helped close the Falaise Gap. Turning east, the 9th crossed the Marne, 28 August, swept through Saarlautern, and in November and December held defensive positions from Monschau to Losheim.

Moving north to Bergrath, Germany, it launched an attack toward the Roer river, 10 December, taking Echtz and Schlich. From mid-December through January 1945, the division held defensive positions from Kalterherberg to Elsenborn. On 30 January the division jumped off from Monschau in a drive across the Roer and to the Rhine, crossing at Remagen, 7 March.

After breaking out of the Remagen bridgehead, the 9th assisted in the sealing and clearing of the Ruhr Pocket, then moved 150 miles (240 km) east to Nordhausen, where it assisted in the liberation of the Mittelbau-Dora concentration camp, and attacked in the Harz Mountains, 14–20 April. On 21 April the Division relieved the 3d Armored Division along the Mulde River, near Dessau, and held that line until VE-day.

After the war, the Division moved south to Ingolstadt. The Division assumed control of the Dachau Concentration Camp in early July.

== Vietnam War ==
The 9th Division was reactivated on 1 February 1966, and arrived in South Vietnam on 16 December 1966 from Fort Riley, Kansas. On deployment the division was assigned to the III Corps Tactical Zone of Vietnam where it commenced operations in Dinh Tuong and Long An Provinces (6 January-31 May 1967) in Operation Palm Beach. Its area of operations was in the rivers and canals of the Mekong Delta from 1967 to 1972. Operating deep within the Viet Cong (VC)–controlled Delta, the Division was charged with protecting the area and its population against VC insurgents and ensuring the success of the South Vietnamese government&#x27;s pacification program. Faced with unrelenting physical hardships, a tenacious enemy and the region&#x27;s rugged terrain, the Division established strategies and quantifiable goals for completing their mission.

Division commanding generals were: Maj. Gen. George S. Eckhardt (February 1966 - June 1967), Maj. Gen. George G. O&#x27;Connor (June 1967 - February 1968), Maj. Gen. Julian Ewell (February 1968 - April 1969), Maj. Gen. Harris W. Hollis (April 1969 - August 1969)

The infantry units that served with the 9th Infantry Division were:

One of the experimental units serving with the division was the 39th Cavalry Platoon (Air Cushion Vehicle) which used three of the specially designed hovercraft to patrol marshy terrain like the Plain of Reeds along the south Vietnamese/Cambodian border. Other experimental units were the 1st and 2nd Airboat Platoons, which operated Hurricane Aircat airboats.
From 1967 on, the 2d Brigade of the division was the Army contingent of the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF). This brigade lived on the ships of Navy Task Force 117, and were transported on their infantry missions throughout the Mekong Delta on Tango boats (converted landing craft) supported by various other armored boats. The MRF was often anchored near the South Vietnamese city of Mỹ Tho, or near the Division&#x27;s Đồng Tâm Base Camp and they conducted operations in coordination with the Navy SEAL teams, the South Vietnamese Marines, units of the ARVN 7th Division and River Assault Groups. Following the Tet offensive in 1968, General Westmoreland stated that the Division and the MRF saved the Delta region from falling to the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam forces. In 1969, the division also operated throughout IV Corps.

Chuck Hagel, later Secretary of Defense, served in the 9th ID from 1967 to 1968 as a sergeant (E-5), serving as an infantry squad leader. Hagel served in the same infantry squad as his younger brother Tom; they are believed to be the only American siblings to serve together during the Vietnam War.

The Division&#x27;s major units departed from South Vietnam on 27 August 1969 (HHC &amp; 1st Brigade) to Hawaii; 27 August 1969 (2nd Brigade) to Fort Lewis, Washington; 12 October 1970 (3rd Brigade) to Fort Lewis.

== Post-Vietnam ==
=== 9th Infantry Division ===
Following the Vietnam War the division was stationed at Fort Lewis. The formal activation ceremony was held on 26 May 1972. Initially the division was organized under the army&#x27;s Reorganization Objective Army Division system.

=== 9th Infantry Division (Motorized) ===
From 1983 the division served as the High-Technology Test-Bed (HTTB) for the army. This led the division to develop the concept of &quot;motorized infantry&quot; from 1983. The motorized infantry division was to be equipped with enhanced technology to give it deployability and fire power and fill the gap between light and heavy divisions. The idea was to create a lighter version of the armored and mechanized divisions, which could be deployed easily by aircraft, while providing more firepower than a light infantry division.

Initially the vision was to create three motorized brigades with three new types of infantry battalion:
* Light Attack Battalion
* Combined Arms Battalion Light
* Combined Arms Battalion Heavy

The light attack battalions utilized the Fast Attack Vehicles (FAV - later re-designated the Desert Patrol Vehicle), essentially a Volkswagen-engined dune buggy with either a 40 mm Mk 19 grenade launcher or 12.7 mm M2 Browning machine gun. The FAV was designed to provide highly mobile firepower that could attack the flanks of heavier mechanized units. Some variants also mounted TOW missiles. All of these weapons systems were attached to the FAV by a mount designed to break away if the vehicle rolled over, which they were prone to do. The FAVs were problematic at best and were eventually replaced by various versions of the Humvee/HMMWV light truck.

The combined arms battalions were organized as a mix of assault gun companies and light motorized infantry companies, with the heavy battalions fielding two assault gun companies and one light motorized infantry company, while the ratio was reversed in the light battalions. The assault gun companies were to be equipped with the Armored Gun System (AGS), but because of delays in the AGS program they were initially equipped with M901 ITVs Improved Tow Vehicles, then M551 Sheridan light tanks and later with Humvees with TOW missiles or Mk 19 grenade launchers. Light motorized infantry companies were equipped with Humvees mounting a Mk 19 grenade launcher. Each combined arms battalion also fielded a combat support company equipped with mortars, scouts, and an anti-armor platoon slated to be equipped with Humvees mounting a ground version of the Hellfire missile. As this Hellfire version never entered service, the platoons were later also equipped with Humvees with TOW missiles.

The division&#x27;s first and third brigade were to field one of each of the three new battalions, while the second brigade would field three combined arms battalions heavy. The third brigade was to field one light and one heavy combined arms battalion and the 9th Cavalry Brigade two attack helicopter battalions, one combat support aviation battalion, and one cavalry reconnaissance squadron. The division artillery would consist of three battalions equipped with M198 155 mm towed howitzers, one light artillery rocket battalion with M102 105 mm towed howitzers and M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems, and one target acquisition battery. The division support command would field three forward support, one cavalry support and one main support battalion. However, because of the delay of the Armored Gun System the division did only activate four of the envisioned five combined arms battalions heavy and retained the 2nd Battalion, 77th Armor instead.

Parts of the division were organized at the end of the 1980s as follows:
** 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Attack)
*** 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry
*** 9th Aviation Battalion
*** 268th Attack Helicopter Battalion
*** Company A, 214th Aviation Battalion
** Division Artillery
*** 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery
*** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery
*** 3rd Battalion, 34th Field Artillery
*** 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery
*** Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery
** Division Support Command
*** 1st Support Battalion (Forward)
*** 2nd Support Battalion (Forward)
*** 3rd Support Battalion (Forward)
*** 4th Support Battalion (Aviation)
*** 5th Support Battalion (Main)
** 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery
** 9th Signal Battalion
** 15th Engineer Battalion
** 109th Military Intelligence Battalion
** 9th Chemical Company
** 9th Military Police Company
** 9th Division Band

In case of war with Warsaw Pact forces the division would have reinforced the Allied Forces Baltic Approaches Command defending Denmark. By 1984 the 9th Cavalry Brigade (Air Attack) was testing motorcycles for reconnaissance work in its reconnaissance squadron, the 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry Regiment. And the 9th Infantry Division (MTZ) tested motorized infantry doctrine at the Yakima Firing Center in Eastern Washington, at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin California and in Korea during the annual Team Spirit exercise. While the motorized units performed well, they were vulnerable to heavier mechanized forces, particularly if forced to stand and fight. They were also extremely vulnerable to indirect artillery fire.

On 1 April 1984, Echo Company of the 15th Engineer Battalion reorganized to form the 73rd Engineer Company (Assault Ribbon Bridge), which was assigned to I Corps, which in turn attached it as separate company to the 15th Engineer Battalion. With the switch from Combat Arms Regimental System to the United States Army Regimental System the division saw a few of its units reflagged or inactivated:

* 15 September 1986: Company A, 214th Aviation Battalion inactivated
* 2 October 1986: 2nd Battalion, 4th Field Artillery to 3rd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery
* 2 October 1986: 3rd Battalion, 34th Field Artillery to 6th Battalion, 11th Field Artillery
* 16 March 1987: 3rd Squadron, 5th Cavalry to 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry
* 16 April 1987: 2nd Battalion, 77th Armor to 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor
* 1987: 9th Aviation Battalion to 1st Battalion, 9th Aviation
* 1987: 268th Attack Helicopter Battalion to 2nd Battalion, 9th Aviation
* 16 March 1988: 1st Battalion, 67th Air Defense Artillery to 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery
* unknown date:
** 1st Support Battalion (Forward) to 99th Support Battalion
** 2nd Support Battalion (Forward) to 109th Support Battalion
** 3rd Support Battalion (Forward) to 209th Support Battalion
** 4th Support Battalion (Aviation) to 3rd Battalion, 9th Aviation
** 5th Support Battalion (Main) to 709th Support Battalion (Main)

During fiscal year 1987 the army decided to inactivate the division&#x27;s 2nd brigade, which would be replaced by the 81st Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) of the Washington Army National Guard. The 2nd brigade was inactivated on 15 August 1988 along with the following units:

* 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 47th Infantry
* 3rd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 60th Infantry
* 6th Battalion, 11th Field Artillery (inactivated 15 September 1988)
* 209th Support Battalion

On the same date the 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, which until then had been attached to the division, was assigned to the division. With the inactivation of the 2nd brigade the remaining units were reassigned among the remaining brigades: 1st brigade now consisted of 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 2nd Infantry, 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor, and 4th Combined Arms Battalion Light, 23rd Infantry. 3rd brigade consisted of 2nd Light Attack Battalion, 1st Infantry, 3rd Combined Arms Battalion Light, 47th Infantry, and 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 60th Infantry. The 2nd Combined Arms Battalion Heavy, 23rd Infantry was assigned to the 9th Cavalry Brigade.

In fiscal year 1989 Chief of Staff of the United States Army General Carl E. Vuono approved the conversion of the division&#x27;s two combined arms battalions light to standard mechanized infantry battalions.

== Inactivation ==
The division was the first to undergo full inactivation following the end of the Cold War. Army leadership at first decided that inactivating units would turn in all of their equipment at &quot;10/20&quot; standard, i.e. in ready and reusable condition. The division struggled to meet this standard, which required both extensive work by the division&#x27;s soldiers and high costs for repair parts. While the remaining 9th ID soldiers were ultimately successful, later inactivating units were not required to attain this goal.

The inactivation of the division began on 28 September 1990 with the inactivation of the 1st Brigade, 2nd Battalion, 23rd Infantry, and 4th Battalion, 23rd Infantry. The 1st Battalion, 84th Field Artillery inactivated on 15 January 1991. As inactivation proceeded, elements and individual soldiers from the division were detached and deployed for service in the Gulf War.

On 16 February 1991 the 3rd Brigade was reflagged as 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized) with the following units:

* 199th Infantry Brigade (Motorized), Fort Lewis
** Headquarters &amp; Headquarters Company
** 1st Battalion, 33rd Armor
** 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry
** 3rd Battalion, 47th Infantry
** 1st Battalion, 11th Field Artillery
** 99th Support Battalion (Forward)
** Troop A, 9th Cavalry (rest of 1st Squadron, 9th Cavalry disbanded on the same date)
** 102nd Engineer Company (Company D, 15th Engineer Battalion)
** 9th Chemical Company
** Battery E, 44th Air Defense Artillery (rest of 1st Battalion, 44th Air Defense Artillery disbanded on the same date)

The remainder of the division&#x27;s units inactivated on the following dates:

* 15 February 1991: 2nd Battalion, 60th Infantry
* 15 April 1991: 15th Engineer Battalion
* 15 May 1991: 2nd Battalion, 2nd Infantry
* 15 July 1991: 9th Signal Battalion and Battery E, 333rd Field Artillery
* 15 September 1991: 109th Military Intelligence Battalion

With the support and aviation units also inactivating. The divisional headquarters remained active until 15 December 1991. The 3rd Battalion, 11th Field Artillery became a General Support battalion of I Corps Artillery.

The division was identified as the second-highest priority inactive division in the United States Army Center of Military History&#x27;s lineage scheme due to its numerous accolades and long history. All of the division&#x27;s flags and heraldic items were moved to the National Infantry Museum at Fort Benning, Georgia following its inactivation. Should the U.S. Army decide to activate more divisions in the future, the center stated its activation recommendations would be the 9th Infantry Division, then the 24th Infantry Division, the 5th Infantry Division, and the 2nd Armored Division. The 7th Infantry Division, previously inactivated, resumed service as an administrative headquarters at Joint Base Lewis–McChord in 2012.

<text>Menen Asfaw (baptismal name: Walatta Giyorgis; 25 March 1889 – 15 February 1962) was Empress of Ethiopia as the wife of Emperor Haile Selassie.

==Family==
Menen Asfaw was born in Ambassel, located in Wollo Province of Ethiopian Empire on 25 March 1889. She was the daughter of Asfaw, Jantirar of Ambassel and Woizero Sehin Michael. Her mother was the daughter of the King Mikael of Wollo and her half-uncle was Lij Iyasu.

According to both published and unpublished reports, the then Woizero Menen Asfaw was first given in marriage by her family to the prominent Wollo nobleman, Dejazmach Ali Mohammed of Cherecha at a very young age, as was the prevailing custom. They had two children, a daughter, Woizero Belaynesh Ali, and a son, Jantirar Asfaw Ali. This first marriage ended in divorce, and her natal family then arranged for Woizero Menen to marry Dejazmach Amede Ali Aba-Deyas, another very prominent nobleman of Wollo. She bore her second husband two children as well, a daughter, Woizero Desta Amede, and a son, Jantirar Gebregziabiher Amede. Following the sudden death of her second husband, Woizero Menen&#x27;s grandfather, &quot;Negus&quot; Mikael arranged her marriage to Ras Leulseged Atnaf Seged, a prominent Shewan nobleman, who was considerably older than Woizero Menen in late 1909 or early 1910. It is unclear whether Woizero Menen was married to the aged nobleman (and secured a divorce shortly afterwards to marry her royal groom) or whether there was only an engagement between them which was broken without ado.

Woizero Menen probably met Dejazmach Tafari Makonnen (later the Emperor Haile Selassie) at the home of her half-uncle, Lij Iyasu. The rapport between the two may have inspired Lij Iyasu to attempt to bind Dejazmach Tafari to him more firmly through marriage ties. He therefore terminated the arrangement (whether marriage or engagement) between Woizero Menen and Ras Leulseged, and sent her to Harar to marry Dejazmach Tafari Makonnen. Ras Leulseged apparently did not hold a grudge against Dejazmach Tafari for this circumstance, blaming it entirely on Lij Iyasu who had ordered it. Indeed, he was among the leaders who fought on the side of Dejazmach Tafari Makonnen in the Battle of Segale, and died in that battle.

==Empress==

The account given in the Autobiography of the Emperor, &quot;My Life and Ethiopia&#x27;s Progress&quot;, mentions no previous marriage or children of Empress Menen and no such order by Iyasu, but states only that at the age of 20, they were married by their own mutual consent, and describes her as &quot;a woman without any malice whatsoever&quot;. When Tafari Makonnen became Emperor of Ethiopia as Haile Selassie I, Menen Asfaw was crowned as Empress at his side. Empress Menen had no children by Ras Leulseged.
Empress Menen was active in promoting women&#x27;s issues in Ethiopia, was Patroness of the Ethiopian Red Cross, and the Ethiopian Women&#x27;s Charitable Organization. She was also patroness of the Jerusalem Society that arranged for pilgrimages to the Holy Land. She founded the Empress Menen School for Girls in Addis Ababa, the first all-girls school which had both boarding and day students. Girls from all over the Empire were brought to the school to receive a modern education, encouraged by the Empress who visited it often and presided over its graduation ceremonies. The Empress gave generously, as well as sponsored programs for poor, ill and disabled people. She was also a devoutly religious woman who did much to support the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church. She built, renovated and endowed numerous churches in Ethiopia and in the Holy Land. Prominent among these are the St. Raguel Church in Addis Ababa&#x27;s Merkato district, the Kidane Mehret (Our Lady Covenant of Mercy) Church on Mount Entoto, and the Holy Trinity Monastery on the banks of the River Jordan in the Holy Land. She gave generously from her personal funds towards the building of the new Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion at Axum, but did not live to see it completed and dedicated.

When the Empress was exiled from Ethiopia during the Italian occupation from 1936 to 1941, she made a pledge to the Virgin Mary at the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, promising to give her crown to the church if Ethiopia were liberated from occupation. The Empress made numerous pilgrimages to Holy Sites in then British-ruled Palestine, in Syria and in Lebanon, during her exile to pray for her occupied homeland. Following the return of Emperor Haile Selassie I and his family to Ethiopia in 1941, a replica of the crown was made for future Empresses, but the original crown that Empress Menen was crowned with at her husband&#x27;s side in 1930 was sent to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. Empress Menen, although often seen wearing a tiara at public events that called for it, would never again wear a full crown.

Empress Menen performed perfectly in the role of empress consort. In her public role she combined religious piety, concern for social causes, and support for development schemes with the majesty of her Imperial status. Outwardly she was the dutiful wife, visiting schools, churches, exhibitions and model farms, attending public and state events at her husband&#x27;s side or by herself. She took no public stand on political or policy issues. Behind the scenes however, she was the Emperor&#x27;s most trusted advisor, quietly offering advice on a whole range of issues. She avoided the publicly political role that her predecessor as Empress-consort, Empress Taytu Betul, had taken, which had caused deep resentment in government circles during the reign of Menelik II.

The Empress and some of her family were placed under house arrest briefly during the 1960 Imperial Guard coup attempt against her husband at her villa outside the Guenete Leul Palace grounds in northern Addis Ababa. Following the return of the Emperor and the crushing of the coup attempt, there was much speculation as to the conduct of the Crown Prince, who had been proclaimed monarch by the coup leaders. It was noted that the Crown Prince had accompanied his mother in a drive through the palace grounds, making stops at Imperial Guard posts to exchange pleasantries with the guards, on the night before the coup was launched. The ailing Empress had been urged to visit the posts by security officials, who were concerned about the soldiers&#x27; morale, and perhaps had an idea that something was brewing. The appearance of the Empress with the Crown Prince at her side may have been used by coup leaders as an indication to their followers that the Empress might sympathise with a movement that brought her favored son to the throne. It is extremely unlikely that either the Empress or the Prince had any idea of what was being plotted. However, a cloud of suspicion never left the Crown Prince, and the Empress was deeply saddened by this.

Following her death in 1962, the Empress was buried in the crypt of Holy Trinity Cathedral in Addis Ababa among the tombs of her children. Prime Minister Aklilu Habte-Wold delivered her eulogy paying tribute to her charity, her piety, and her role as advisor and helpmate to the Emperor, as well as her personal kindness and goodness. On the third day memorial and commemoration after the funeral, the Emperor himself paid tribute to his wife by saying that although the Prime Minister had aptly described what kind of person his late wife had been, he wanted to say that during their five decades of marriage, not once had it been necessary to have a third party mediate between him and his wife, and that their marriage had been one of peace and mutual support.

Later, the Emperor built a pair of grand sarcophagi in the north transept of Holy Trinity Cathedral&#x27;s nave, in order to transfer his wife&#x27;s remains there and eventually be buried at her side himself. But due to the revolution, the Emperor was not buried there after his death, and the Empress remained in her original tomb in the crypt. During the ceremonial burial of her husband&#x27;s remains in November 2000, the remains of Empress Menen were also disinterred from the crypt tomb, and placed in the sarcophagus next to her husband in the nave of the cathedral, as he had originally intended.

As the consort of Emperor Haile Selassie, Empress Menen is highly venerated by members of the Rastafari movement. One name Rastas bestow on the Empress is &quot;Queen Omega&quot; which complements one of the names they give to the Emperor &quot;King Alpha&quot; (as in &quot;Alpha and Omega&quot;). The later name is used to refer to the emperor in the original version of the reggae song &quot;Rivers of Babylon&quot; by The Melodians but all mention of him was removed from the more popular version by Boney M.

==Descendants==

Empress Menen and Emperor Haile Selassie were the parents of six children: Princess Tenagnework, Crown Prince Asfaw Wossen, Princess Tsehai, Princess Zenebework, Prince Makonnen, and Prince Sahle Selassie.

Empress Mene was step-mother to the Emperor&#x27;s eldest child Princess Romanework. Princess Romanework was the daughter of a previous union of the emperor with Woizero Woinitu Amede (also known as Woizero Altayech). The emperor&#x27;s own autobiography mentions that his joy in 1941 following Ethiopia&#x27;s liberation from Fascist Occupation was tempered by the grief of learning that his eldest child, Princess Romanework, had died under detention in Italy. Princess Romanework had been imprisoned along with her four sons, two of whom also died in Italy. The remaining two, Dejazmatch Samson Beyene Merid, and Dejazmatch Merid Beyene Merid, were repatriated from Italy after the war and were raised by the Emperor and Empress.

Prince Asfaw Wossen was first married to Princess Wolete Israel Seyoum and then following their divorce to Princess Medferiashwork Abebe. Prince Makonnen was married to Princess Sara Gizaw. Prince Sahle Selassie was married to Princess Mahisente Habte Mariam. Princess Romanework married Dejazmatch Beyene Merid. Princess Tenagnework first married Ras Desta Damtew, and after she was widowed later married Ras Andargachew Messai. Princess Zenebework married Dejazmatch Haile Selassie Gugsa. Princess Tsehai married Lt. General Abiye Abebe.

<text>Xanten (, Low Rhenish: &quot;Santen&quot;) is a town in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located in the district of Wesel.

Xanten is known for the Archaeological Park, one of the largest archaeological open air museums in the world, built at the site of the Roman settlements &quot;Colonia Ulpia Traiana&quot;. Other attractions include the medieval town centre with Xanten Cathedral, many museums and large man-made lakes for various watersport activities. Xanten is visited by approximately one million tourists a year. It is also the only German town with a name that begins with &quot;X&quot;.

==Geography==
Xanten is made up of three boroughs (&quot;Ortsteile&quot;): &quot;Hochbruch&quot;, &quot;Niederbruch&quot;, and the &quot;town centre&quot;. Other localities (&quot;Bezirke&quot;) belonging to the town of Xanten include &quot;Birten&quot;, &quot;Lüttingen&quot;, &quot;Marienbaum&quot;, &quot;Vynen&quot;, &quot;Obermörmter&quot;, &quot;Wardt&quot;, &quot;Mörmter&quot;, &quot;Willich&quot;, &quot;Beek&quot; and &quot;Ursel&quot;. Parts of a nature reserve called &quot;Bislicher Insel&quot; are located in the municipality as well.

The town borders the Lower Rhine and the town of Rees to the north, the town of Wesel to the east, the municipalities of Alpen and Sonsbeck to the south, and the towns of Uedem and Kalkar to the west.

The closest international airport is Weeze Airport (also called Niederrhein Airport; Ryanair hub) in Weeze (25 km); the closest intercontinental airport is Düsseldorf Airport (60 km). It has a station on the Rheinhausen–Kleve railway, which connects to Duisburg via Moers.

==History==

===Antiquity===


The first settlements by isolated tribes can be dated to around the year 2000 BC. Around 15 BC the Roman &quot;castrum&quot; or camp &quot;Vetera&quot; was created on the Fürstenberg near modern-day Birten. It was intended as a base for campaigns into Germania and until its destruction during the Revolt of the Batavi in 70 AD it was occupied by 8,000 to 10,000 legionaries, and was the main base of the Classis germanica.

After the destruction of &quot;Vetera&quot; a second camp was established at the Bislicher Insel, named &quot;Castra Vetera II&quot;, which became the base camp of Legio VI Victrix. A nearby created settlement, which was inhabited by 10,000 to 15,000 former legionaries and others, was given the rights of a colonia in 110 AD by the Roman emperor Marcus Ulpius Traianus, who renamed the town &quot;Colonia Ulpia Traiana&quot;. The colonia was a completely new town with a town wall and other buildings like an amphitheatre. For this town the old settlement was completely destroyed. The colonia became the second most important commercial post in the province of Germania Inferior, surpassed only by &quot;Colonia Agrippinensis&quot; (today&#x27;s Cologne). In 122, &quot;Vetera II&quot; became the camp of Legio XXX Ulpia Victrix, replacing VI Victrix which had moved to Britannia.

In 275, the colonia was almost destroyed by Germanic tribes. Subsequently, in 310 in the area of the colonia a new town was established, named &quot;Tricensimae&quot; (&quot;of the Thirtieth&quot;), which was built on the nine central &quot;insula&quot; of the former colonia but fortified and more easily defended. At the beginning of the 5th century, assaults by Germanic tribes rapidly increased, with the result that &quot;Tricensimae&quot; was finally given up.

Around 300, Viktor of Xanten is named among the Theban Legion executed for refusing to sacrifice to the Roman gods. Venerated as a martyr and a saint by the Catholic as well as the Eastern Orthodox Church, Viktor of Xanten is commemorated in Xanten Cathedral, where his relics are kept in a shrine embedded in the high altar.

===Middle Ages===
In the 5th century the Franks began to settle in the area of today&#x27;s Xanten, but no urban settlements have been found from this time as the Franks did not build in stone, unlike the Romans. Only graves from this time have been discovered.

According to the legend of the Nibelungs, the mythical Siegfried of Xanten was born &quot;ze Santen an dem Rhîne&quot;.

In the second half of the 8th century a church was built on the grounds of an old cemetery of the ancient Roman colony and called &quot;Sanctos (super Rhenum)&quot; (also mentioned as &quot;ad Sanctum&quot;). The name of &quot;place of saints&quot; was derived from the assumed grave of the martyr Viktor of Xanten and is the source of today&#x27;s municipal name of &quot;Xanten&quot;. After the establishment of a convent to the south, what became today&#x27;s town centre grew into existence.

In 939 troops under Otto I, King of Germany defeated rebellious Franconian, Saxon and Lotharingian troops under Eberhard of Franconia in the Battle of Birten near Xanten. Following the Battle of Andernach the same year the Rhineland was reaffirmed to the kingdom of Otto I.

While Xanten, with its rich &quot;Viktor Convent&quot;, was still being besieged by Norsemen in 863, in 1122 the place already appears as part of a trading network at the Lower Rhine. On 15 July 1228, Xanten was given town rights by the Archbishop of Cologne, Heinrich of Molenark.

Xanten had a Jewish community in early medieval times. Two massacres of Jews occurred during the First Crusade, on (1 and 27 June 1096). On the latter occasion some Jews committed suicide in order to escape the fury of the Crusaders.

In 1263 the foundation stone for the Gothic St. Victor cathedral was laid. After 281 years of construction it was finally completed in 1544. By the end of the 14th century, Xanten was surrounded by a town wall.

In 1392 the northern part of the town came into the possession of the Dukes of Cleves, while the southern part remained with the Archbishopric of Cologne. The division of Xanten was a cause of a conflict between Cleves and Cologne, which ended when the whole of Xanten was awarded to the Duchy of Cleves in 1444.

===Early Modern period===
After being taken by the Dukes of Cleves, in the wake of war and crop failure, the number of inhabitants slumped from 5,000 at the beginning of the 16th century to approximately 2,500 by the end of the 18th century. The Rhine had been a basis of Xanten&#x27;s status as a trading town until the river bed shifted away from the town, causing its economic situation to deteriorate. The river even flooded and destroyed the locality of Birten several times.

The borough Marienbaum, however, became the main place of pilgrimage on the Lower Rhine between 1430 and 1441. In 1460 a monastery of the Bridgettines was established, with an abbey church called &quot;St. Mariä Himmelfahrt&quot; (Assumption of Mary) which nowadays serves as a parish church.

In the 17th century Xanten was (along with Cleves) inherited by the Margraviate of Brandenburg. Protestantism was placed on an equal footing with the Roman Catholic Church, as confirmed by the &quot;Treaty of Xanten&quot; on 12 November 1614. Thereupon a church was built at the &quot;Großer Markt&quot; (Great Marketplace), which was expanded with a spire in 1622. Nevertheless, at the beginning of the 20th century only 5% of the population were of Protestant denomination. By the beginning of the 21st century, the Protestant share of the population had increased to some 20%.

===19th and early 20th century===
In 1802, the Viktor-convent was secularized by Napoléon Bonaparte, and the libraries of closed monasteries and the convent library were merged. After that, the economic situation deteriorated more rapidly. A town gate called the &quot;Marstor&quot; was torn down in 1821, and the &quot;Scharntor&quot; and parts of the town walls were removed in 1825. The removal of the &quot;Klever Tor&quot; and a mill called &quot;Kriemhildmühle&quot; was prevented by a town councillor in 1843. At the same time, the ruins of the &quot;Colonia Ulpia Traiana&quot;, which had been used as a quarry since the Roman settlement was given up, aroused the interest of archaeologists.

Xanten was administered within the Prussian Rhine Province from 1822 to 1945. Between 1819 and 1844, excavations were carried out at the Roman ruins. In September 1927, the Catholic Church municipality celebrated its 1,600th anniversary; in 1937 Pope Pius XI granted the right for the cathedral of &quot;St. Viktor&quot; to be called a basilica minor.

In the later part of the 19th century, there was a high-profile case of alleged ritual murder, also known as blood libel. On 29 June 1891, Johann Hegemann, the five-year-old son of a local cabinet maker, was found dead in a neighbour&#x27;s barn, with his throat cut from ear to ear. Anti-Semitic agitation connected the Jewish butcher and former shoḥeṭ Adolf Buschoff with this crime, and the local priest, Father Bresser, lent support to this rumour by publishing articles on ritual murder in the paper &quot;Bote für Stadt und Land&quot;, which he edited. The agitation in the anti-Semitic press, as well as at anti-semitic meetings, where it was insinuated that the Jews had bribed or intimidated the authorities in order to prevent the discovery of the truth, compelled the government to arrest Buschoff and his family (14 October 1891). The evidence against the man, who had always borne a good reputation, was so flimsy, however, that he was discharged (20 December). This action aroused the anti-Semites to still stronger agitation, which culminated in a heated debate in the Prussian Diet. In the course of this argument, Stoecker, the ex-court chaplain, repeated the accusation of ritual murder, and hinted at Jewish influence as the cause of the failure to find the murderer (7 February 1892). Under pressure from this agitation, Buschoff was rearrested (8 February), and tried before a jury at Cleves (4–14 July 1892). During this trial, it was found that the accusations were based on mere hearsay, and contained impossible assertions. The prosecuting attorney himself moved for the dismissal of the charge, and the jury rendered its verdict accordingly. The real murderer was never discovered, and the possibility that the death of the child was due to an accident was not entirely disproved. The agitation had the effect of reducing the Jewish population of the town, and Buschoff himself had to leave. In 1905, Xanten had about thirty Jews out of a total population of 3,770.

===Nazi Germany===
In 1933, mayor Heinrich Wagner was locked up in a tower called the &quot;Meerturm&quot;, accused of alleged nepotism in the loan business. His successor was Friedrich Karl Schöneborn, while the post of deputy mayor was given to Heinrich Prang junior. Prang had already created a local group of the NSDAP in 1925. As the local council of the &quot;Deutsche Zentrumspartei&quot; was dissolved, three of formerly eight town council members were group members of the NSDAP. The remaining opposition consisted of communists and liberal politicians lacking a clear political mandate.

The following years saw harassment of the Jewish population of Xanten. This included the destruction of the local prayer room and the devastation of several dwellings of Jewish inhabitants on &quot;Reichskristallnacht&quot; of 9 November 1938. After these events, the entire Jewish population fled Xanten. In May 1940, the German 256th infantry division was transferred to Xanten to take part in the forthcoming invasion of the Netherlands. During the Second World War an ammunition factory of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was established in a small forest close to the town, called &quot;Die Hees&quot;. While citizens of Xanten worked there at the beginning of the war, women and children, and especially foreigners were forced to perform hard labour at the plant as the war progressed. Incidents in the area of the factory occurred in November 1942 and October 1944, causing the explosion of a portion of the stored ammunition, which cost several workers&#x27; lives.

When Allied troops reached Xanten in February 1945, mayor Schöneborn left the town. With him fled almost the entire town administration to areas to the east. In the same month the bombardment of the town had begun, killing civilians and destroying parts of Xanten. In addition, the cathedral was hit by Allied bombs and damaged heavily. On 8 March, Xanten was finally taken by Canadian troops. The Canadian military lost, according to their own data, 400 soldiers in the fight against the defending &quot;Fallschirmjäger&quot; (paratroops) under the command of Eugen Meindl. Thereupon the town, 85% of which had already been destroyed, was occupied by British troops while the population was evacuated to Bedburg-Hau in preparation for the crossing of the Rhine near the town of Wesel. Artillery projectiles fired by German soldiers from the right bank of the Rhine further devastated Xanten at this time. When the crossing of the Rhine finally succeeded on 24 March, the Second World War was over for Xanten.

===Post-World War II===

The reconstruction of the town and the cathedral was influenced particularly by the archaeologist and monument conservationist Walter Bader, and lasted until 1966. Expellees from East Prussia were resettled in Xanten and caused the population to rise by almost 40%. In the course of the local re-organization in 1969, the localities &quot;Birten&quot;, &quot;Lüttingen&quot;, &quot;Marienbaum&quot;, &quot;Obermörmter&quot;, &quot;Vynen&quot; and &quot;Wardt&quot; were integrated into Xanten, so that around 16,000 inhabitants lived within the town boundaries. The area of the town increased from 8 km2 to 72 km2.

In 1975, the &quot;Archäologischer Park Xanten&quot; (Xanten Archaeological Park), a partial reconstruction of the &quot;Roman Colonia Ulpia Traiana&quot;, was established and opened for tourism.

On 28 November 1988, Xanten was granted the title of a &quot;Staatlich anerkannter Erholungsort&quot; (state-recognized leisure town) as the first such town in the region of Düsseldorf. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of inhabitants rose from 16,930 to about 22,000.

==Attractions==
The &quot;Archäologischer Park Xanten&quot; is built on the site of the Roman town, and it is one of the most frequently visited parks in Germany. In 2012, the Archaeological Park was expanded to nearly the whole area of the Roman colonia after Bundesstraße 57 was moved away from the area.

Historical buildings in the town centre have been restored. At the &quot;Xantener Südsee&quot; and &quot;Xantener Nordsee&quot;, two lakes connected by a channel close to the localities Wardt and Vynen, the &quot;Freizeitzentrum Xanten&quot; (Xanten Leisure Center) was established in 1982. Today, it is a popular destination for sailors.

==Culture==
Big events include the &quot;Xantener Sommerfestspiele&quot; (a prestigious classical music festival lasting two weeks every summer from 1993 to 2012), the annual &quot;KleinMontMartre&quot; where artists from all over the world show their latest works as well as the annual German sandcastle-building championship.

==Education==
Among other schools there is one gymnasium (grammar school), the &quot;Stiftsgymnasium Xanten&quot;, and a private school for girls, the &quot;Marienschule&quot;, in Xanten.

<doc id="926929" wikidata="Q6540896" url="?curid=926929" title="Liberalism in Cuba">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Cuba]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ means a reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Introduction==
From the founding of the Republic in 1902 to the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the Cuban Liberal Party held the presidency on numerous occasions.

Since the triumph of the Cuban Revolution of 1959, there have been three liberal parties in existence. Those parties are: the Liberal Democratic Party (&quot;Partido Liberal Democrático&quot;, observer LI), the Democratic Solidarity Party (&quot;Partido Solidaridad Democrática&quot;, observer LI) and the illegal Cuban Liberal Movement (&quot;Movimiento Liberal Cubano&quot;). In exile the Cuban Liberal Union (&quot;Unión Liberal Cubana&quot;, member LI) is active.

==The timeline==
===Cuban Revolutionary Party (PRC)===
*1892: Left-wing classical liberals formed the Cuban Revolutionary Party (&quot;Partido Revolucionario Cubano&quot;), to fight for Cuban independence and liberal democracy.
*1902: The PRC is dissolved.

===Liberal Party===
*1902: The Liberal Party of Cuba was founded by many of those who had formerly been members of the PRC.
*1908: The Independent Colored Party is formed, fighting for agrarian reform, democratic nationalism, and the civil rights of Black Cubans.
*1925: The Liberal Party wins the elections with Gerardo Machado as their candidate.
*1929: Machado runs for a second term by altering the Constitution, and is fraudulently elected. The Liberal Party splits between &quot;machadistas&quot; and those against Machado.
*1933: The Revolution takes place, in which a group of students, the FEU, led by Ramón Grau San Martín, a Professor of Physiology at the University of Havana, seek to overthrow Machado, and later, the US backed provisional government of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes. Allying themselves with a group of soldiers led by Fulgencio Batista, the provisional government is overthrown and Grau is made President.

===The Second Cuban Revolutionary Party (PRC), the Party of the Cuban People (PPC) and the Liberal Party===
*1934: After Grau&#x27;s removal from the presidency by Batista, a group of former students, Grau, and several former members of the Liberal Party form the new Authentic Cuban Revolutionary Party, or PRC (Partido Revolucionario Cubano- Autentico) to fight for their beliefs. The PRC begins to compete with the traditional Liberal Party, which was stained by its support of Machado.
*1940: Fulgencio Batista is elected President of Cuba with the support of the Liberal Party. The new Constitution is promulgated later that year, with Carlos Márquez Sterling as President of the Convention.
*1944: Ramón Grau San Martín is elected President of Cuba, with the support of several former Liberal Party members, as the PRC wins its first elections.
*1947: Eduardo Chibas breaks off from the PRC to protest the corruption of the Grau government and forms the Partido del Pueblo Cubano-Ortodoxo (PPC) or the Party of Cuban People-Orthodox. Several former PRC and Liberal Party members, including Márquez Sterling, join.
*1948: Carlos Prío Socarrás of the PRC is elected President of Cuba.
*1951: Eduardo Chibas dies from an accidental suicide. Had he survived, the PPC would most likely not have fragmented as it did during the 1950s.

===Batista&#x27;s coup and second government===
*1952: The Liberal Party of Cuba supports Batista&#x27;s coup of 1952 and joins the provisional government, and later Batista&#x27;s second government. By now the Liberal Party is a shell of its former self, controlled by Batista.
*1952–1958: The PRC and PPC split between those who argue for revolution and support Castro, and those who seek compromise with Batista and support free and fair general elections.
*1958: The General Elections of 1958 fail, as Batista rigs the elections to ensure the victory of the government candidate Andrés Rivero Agüero and a member of the Liberal Party, against Carlos Márquez Sterling running for the Partido del Pueblo Libre.
*1959: Castro takes power and outlaws all political parties except the Communist Party. The traditional Liberal Party, PRC, and PPC legally cease to exist. The Liberal Party continues underground and extralegally.

==Liberal leaders==
*José Martí, founder of the PRC and leading Cuban intellectual
*Martín Morúa Delgado, Afro-Cuban and President of the Cuban Senate
*Juan Gualberto Gómez, Afro-Cuban revolutionary leader, close collaborator of Martí&#x27;s, served as part of the committee of consultations that drafted and amended the Constitution of 1901, and as a Representative and Senator
*José Miguel Gómez, the first member of the Liberal Party elected to the presidency of Cuba
*Gerardo Machado, a president of Cuba elected under the Liberal Party
*Orestes Ferrara, a professor at the University of Havana, Cuban Secretary of State and delegate to the Constitutional Convention
*Carlos Márquez Sterling, a leading member of the Liberal Party during the 1930s and 1940s and President of the Constitutional Convention in 1940. He later served in the first government of Fulgencio Batista.

<text>The 6th Infantry Division was an infantry division of the United States Army active in World War I, World War II, and the last years of the Cold War. Known as &quot;Red Star&quot;, it was previously called the &quot;Sight Seein&#x27; Sixth&quot;. When it was suspected that the division may deploy to Vietnam, it was given the derogatory nickname of the “Commie Jew Division”. When the 1st Battalion, 501st Infantry Regiment was attached in the 1990s, the division was known as the other derogatory nickname the “Jumpin’ Jews”.

==World War I==
On 17 November 1917, the War Department directed that the 6th Division be organized with a cadre from Regular Army units stationed at Camp Forrest, Georgia, Forts Leavenworth and Riley, Kansas, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and other posts. The division headquarters was established at Camp McClellan, Alabama. Division units commenced training at their respective posts; the 11th and 12th Infantry Brigades and the division trains at Camp Forrest, while the division artillery moved to the training center at Camp Doniphan, Oklahoma, in April. In May and June, the division headquarters, 12th Infantry Brigade, 16th and 17th Machine Gun Battalions, 6th Field Signal Battalion, and 6th Train Headquarters and Military Police moved to Camp Wadsworth, South Carolina. In May and June 1918, 15,000 Selective Service men arrived from Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Wisconsin to complete the division.

Casualties totalled 386 (KIA: 38; WIA: 348). Separately, the 11th Field Artillery became engaged earlier in the Meuse-Argonne offensive and fought from 19 October until the Armistice.

===Commanders===
==Interwar period==

The 6th Division arrived at Camp Mills, New York, on 10 June 1919 after completing 6 months of training at Aignay-le-Duc, France, and occupation duty near and in Bad Bertrich, Germany. On arrival, emergency period personnel were discharged from the service at Camp Mills. The division proceeded to Camp Grant, Illinois, arrived 17 June, and remained there until September 1921. As a part of the War Department&#x27;s decision to maintain only three fully-active stateside infantry divisions, The 6th Division was inactivated, less the 12th Infantry Brigade and several smaller units, on 30 September 1921 at Camp Grant. Concurrently, the inactivated units were assigned active associate units for mobilization purposes. The 6th Division was allotted to the Sixth Corps Area for mobilization responsibility and assigned to the VI Corps. Camp Grant was designated as the mobilization and training station for the division upon reactivation. During the period 1921–39, the active elements of the 6th Division consisted of the 12th Infantry Brigade and other assorted divisional elements that formed the base force from which the remainder of the division would be reactivated in the event of war. The division headquarters was organized on 17 April 1926 with Organized Reserve personnel as a “Regular Army Inactive” (RAI) unit at Chicago, Illinois. Additionally, most of the division&#x27;s inactive elements were also organized in the Chicago area by mid-1927 as RAI units. The active elements of the division maintained habitual training relationships with divisional RAI units, as well as those of the VI Corps, XVI Corps, and the 85th, 86th, and 101st Divisions. The RAI and Reserve units often trained with the active elements of the division during summer training camps which were usually conducted at Camp Custer, Michigan, Fort Sheridan, Illinois, and at the regimental home stations of the 2nd and 6th Infantry Regiments. These two regiments also supported the Reserve units’ conduct of the Citizens&#x27; Military Training Camps held at Fort Sheridan and Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. 

The 12th Infantry Brigade, reinforced by the active elements of the 6th Tank Company, 6th Field Artillery Brigade, 3rd and 14th Field Artillery Regiments, and the 6th Quartermaster Regiment, held maneuvers at Camp Custer in those years when funds were available. During these maneuvers, the 6th Division headquarters was often formed in a provisional status to train Regular and Reserve officers in division-level command and control procedures. The division was also provisionally formed for the August 1936 Second Army maneuvers at Camp Custer and near Allegan, Michigan. For that maneuver, the division (12th Infantry Brigade as the nucleus) was reinforced by the Illinois National Guard&#x27;s 8th Infantry (Colored), in addition to the other active divisional elements. Under the new “triangular” tables of organization, the 6th Division was reactivated 10 October 1939 at Fort Lewis, Washington. It was transferred to Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 9 November 1939, relieved from the VI Corps, and attached to the IV Corps. After maneuvers in Louisiana in May 1940, the division was transferred to Fort Snelling, Minnesota, and assigned to the Second Army. The division participated in the Second Army maneuvers at Camp Ripley, Minnesota, in August 1940, in the Second Army maneuvers in Arkansas in August 1941, and in the GHQ maneuvers in Louisiana in September–October 1941. After the GHQ maneuvers, the 6th Division was moved to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for permanent station and arrived there 10 October 1941.

==World War II combat chronicle==
The division moved to Hawaii in July and August 1943 to assume defensive positions on Oahu, training meanwhile in jungle warfare. It moved to Milne Bay, New Guinea, 31 January 1944, and trained until early June 1944. The division first saw combat in the Toem-Wakde area of Dutch New Guinea, engaging in active patrolling 14–18 June, after taking up positions 6–14 June. Moving west of Toem, it fought the bloody Battle of Lone Tree Hill, 21–30 June, and secured the Maffin Bay area by 12 July.

After a brief rest, the division made an assault landing at Sansapor, 30 July, on the Vogelkop Peninsula. The 6th secured the coast from Cape Waimak to the Mega River and garrisoned the area until December 1944.

The division landed at Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, in the Philippines on D-day, 9 January 1945, and pursued the Japanese into the Cabanatuan hills, 17–21 January, capturing Muñoz on 7 February. On 27 January, Special Operations units also attached to the Sixth United States Army took part in the Raid at Cabanatuan. The division then drove northeast to Dingalan Bay and Baler Bay, 13 February, isolating enemy forces in southern Luzon. The U.S. 1st Infantry Regiment operated on Bataan together with the Philippine Commonwealth forces, 14–21 February, cutting the peninsula from Abucay to Bagac.

The division then took part in the Battle of Manila, shifting to the Shimbu Line northeast of Manila, on 24 February to take part in the longest continuous combat operation of the division in the Battle of Wawa Dam. The 6th Division faced a tough seesaw battle versus the Shimbu Group as the Japanese Shimbu Group created network of tunnels, artillery positions, and machine gun nests in the hill country of Antipolo, San Mateo, and Montalban in Rizal Province. The terrain is formed by sharp hills and deep valleys, where direct assaults could be made in a day, and the next day units would be forced to retreat. The 6th Division took Mount Mataba on 17 April, Mount Pacawagan on 29 April,Bolog on 29 June, Lane&#x27;s Ridge of Mount Santo Domingo on 10 July, and Kiangan, 12 July. The 6th remained with the Philippine Military forces in the Cagayan Valley and the Cordillera Mountains until VJ-day.

After the war, the division moved to Korea and controlled the southern half of the United States zone of occupation until inactivated.
===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 2,370
*Killed in action: 410
*Wounded in action: 1,957

===Commanders===

==Post World War==
===Cold War era===
The 6th Division was reactivated 4 October 1950 at Fort Ord, California. There the division remained throughout the Korean War, training troops and providing personnel for combat, but was never deployed overseas as an entity itself and was again inactivated on 3 April 1956.

In the American build-up during the Vietnam War the Division was reactivated in 1967 at Fort Campbell, Kentucky, and later a forward brigade was located in Hawaii. There was sentiment against sending the Division to Vietnam because its shoulder sleeve insignia (a red six-pointed star) invited a derisive nickname (&quot;Commie Jew Division&quot;) that General Westmoreland, cognizant of troop morale problems, considered too offensive, and the decision was made instead to form the Americal Division (23rd Infantry Division), with less offensive insignia, in Vietnam itself. During June 1968 the US Joint Chiefs of Staff also declared the Division unsuitable for combatant deployment because it failed its readiness report and shortly thereafter the Division was inactivated on 25 July 1968.

The Division never received its full TO&amp;E equipment and most of its personnel were Vietnam returnees. The purpose for activating the division was to obtain military hardware which would eventually be turned over to the South Vietnamese.

The last incarnation of the Division came on 16 April 1986 under the command of Major General Johnnie H. Corns at Fort Richardson, Alaska when the assets of the 172nd Infantry Brigade were used to reactivate the 6th Infantry Division (Light). Over the next seven years the 6th was the U.S. Army&#x27;s primary Arctic warfare division.

==== Organization 1989 ====
The planned activation of two additional light infantry battalions for the division, one at Fort Richardson in October 1988, and one at Fort Wainwright in May 1989, was cancelled with the Fiscal Year 1988 budget. To round-out the division the 6th Battalion, 297th Infantry, of the Alaska Army National Guard was activated on 1 September 1989.

At the end of the Cold War parts of the division were organized as follows:

* 6th Infantry Division (Light), Fort Richardson, Alaska

In 1988 the airborne companies (Charlie Airborne) of 1-17 Infantry, 2-17 Infantry and 4-9 Infantry were consolidated in 2-17 Infantry, giving the 6th ID an airborne battalion. Notable operational deployments included an eight-month deployment to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt by 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, in 1990 as part of the Multinational Force and Observers. The deployment began as a six-month rotation but was extended in August 1990 due to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait which precipitated Operation Desert Shield and delayed the arrival of their relieving unit. The division headquarters was moved from Fort Richardson to Fort Wainwright (near Fairbanks) in 1990. Commanders during the Arctic activation included Maj. Gen. Johnnie H. Corns (1986–1988), Maj. Gen. Samuel E. Ebbesen (1990–1992) and Maj. Gen. David A. Bramlett (1992–1994). The division had two active maneuver brigades and the Army Reserve&#x27;s 205th Infantry Brigade (Light) was assigned as the division&#x27;s roundout force. The 1st Battalion, 188th Air Defense Artillery of the North Dakota Army National Guard served as the division&#x27;s roundout Air Defense Artillery. They were the only National Guard Air Defense battalion to ever roundout an active duty division.

===Inactivation===
The division was inactivated most recently on 6 July 1994, and reduced to a single brigade, the 1st Brigade, 6th Infantry Division. In reality, the 6th no longer existed as a division and command of the brigade fell under the 10th Mountain Division (Light Infantry) at Fort Drum, NY. In April 1998, 1st Brigade was reflagged back to the separate 172nd Infantry Brigade from which the division had been reestablished in 1986. The 172nd Brigade was then reflagged as the 1st Brigade Combat Team (Stryker), 25th Infantry Division on 16 December 2006.

On 16 October 2008 the division&#x27;s HHC 6th Engineer Battalion was reactivated as a non-divisional unit in Alaska. In this new role it is configured as an Airborne unit with two subordinate engineer companies: the 23d Engineer Company and the 84th Engineer Company.
