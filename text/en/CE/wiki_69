<text>Arthur Baysting (17 April 1947 – 3 December 2019) was a New Zealand writer, producer and children&#x27;s advocate. He lived in Auckland with his partner, artist Jean Clarkson. They had two grown children.

==Early career==
Baysting was born in Blenheim, and grew up in Nelson. From the 1990s onward, Baysting became well known for his advocacy of NZ music. Before this he worked as a journalist, scriptwriter and stand-up comedian.

In Australia, his children&#x27;s songs, co-written with Peter Dasent, have become popular through the ABC show &quot;Play School&quot; and recordings by the singer and its host Justine Clarke.

Early in his writing career, Baysting was a journalist with the magazine &quot;NZ Listener&quot; and published &quot;Young New Zealand Poets&quot; (1973), an anthology of poetry.

In 1977, Baysting (with Ian Mune) wrote the screenplay for Roger Donaldson&#x27;s feature film &quot;Sleeping Dogs&quot;, a film credited with kick-starting the modern NZ film industry. He also collaborated with Donaldson on the series, &quot;Winners and Losers&quot;, and with Mune, on the children&#x27;s television serial, &quot;The Mad Dog Gang&quot;.

==Career==
===1970s–1980s===
Baysting and his partner became members of the alternative theatre group Red Mole for their seven-month season at Wellington&#x27;s Carmen&#x27;s Balcony. Baysting was the cabaret&#x27;s MC and his character, Neville Purvis, became one of New Zealand&#x27;s early stand-up comedians. Purvis later starred in his own television series, &quot;The Neville Purvis Family Show&quot;.

This ended controversially in 1979 with Purvis apologising for the bad language in the series and adding, &quot;at least we never said f**k,&quot; thereby becoming the first person to say the forbidden word on NZ television. Following complaints to the police, and media publicity around this event, free-lance work was scarce, and in 1980 Baysting and Clarkson moved to Sydney. While in Australia he was signed to Mushroom Music Publishing, later shifting administration of his repertoire to Origin Music.

The couple moved back to NZ in 1985 where Baysting wrote scripts for the production company The Gibson Group, including the satirical sketch series &quot;Public Eye&quot; and the tele-feature &quot;Undercover&quot; (featuring a very young Cliff Curtis). He contributed to the soundtrack of Peter Jackson&#x27;s feature &quot;Meet The Feebles&quot; (1989).

He worked for several years at the Auckland Medical School, with Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) and through this met Labour back-bencher Helen Clark and became her electorate press secretary. Later (with Dyan Campbell and Margaret Dagg) he edited &quot;Making Policy Not Tea&quot; (Oxford University Press), a book of interviews with women MPs.

===1990s===
For two years in the early 1990s, Baysting was President of the NZ Writers Guild and in 1992, he was elected NZ Writer/Director on the Board of the Australasian Performing Right Association (APRA), the body run by songwriters to license music and distribute music royalties.

Over the next 18 years, as APRA director, Baysting became involved in a number of cultural initiatives, notably the Green Ribbon campaign. This brought together industry groups such as SPADA, APRA, the Writers Guild, the Director&#x27;s Guild, WIFT, the Technicians Guild and others to collectively lobby politicians for better access for NZ programming. The 1999 Endangered Species conference bought in experts from Ireland and Australia and put the issue of local radio and television content on to the political agenda.

Green Ribbon lobbied for more local content on television, for a 20% quota for NZ music on commercial radio, for a Music Commission and for a non-commercial national radio network for young people. They were successful with the first three objectives (although the 20% music quota is a &quot;voluntary target&quot;). The youth radio initiative was vigorously opposed by commercial radio and never eventuated.

===2000s===
In 2001, for his work with the Green Ribbon campaign, Baysting received the inaugural SPADA/On Film Industry Champion award. The campaign found an ally in Helen Clark who went on to become the first NZ Prime Minister to hold the arts portfolio and who ushered in a remarkable period in New Zealand&#x27;s cultural growth. In the same year Baysting and Mike Chunn produced the &quot;Nature&#x27;s Best&quot; collection of the top 30 songs voted for by APRA members and other music luminaries. Released by Sony Music, it became the largest-selling NZ compilation and was followed by several successful follow-up releases.

In 2001 Baysting became co-director, with Cath Andersen, of the newly established Music Industry Commission. He later moved into the role of Project Director before leaving the NZMIC in 2006.

In 2008, Baysting and his family travelled to Tahiti, where his partner Jean Clarkson was part of a group exhibition by women descendants of the Tahitians who sailed to Pitcairn Island with the Bounty mutineers. He made a documentary of this Tahiti visit, called &quot;The &#x27;Ahu Sistas&quot;, which told the women&#x27;s side of this famous story. He also co-wrote songs with Pitcairn Islander Meralda Warren for the CD &quot;Pitcairn Island Songs.&quot;

In 2008, Baysting helped set up the annual APRA Children&#x27;s Music Awards and in 2005/06 he was on the originating committee for the first New Zealand Ukulele Festival, now a popular annual event featuring over 3,000 young ukulele players.

===2010s===
In 2012, Penguin/Viking Australia published the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Gobbledygook is Eating a Book&quot;, written by Baysting and Justine Clarke. This was shortlisted for Best Children&#x27;s Book in the Australian book awards and has since been translated and published in France.

Baysting became a respected songwriter working with many collaborators in a variety of genres. Artists who have recorded his songs include Al Hunter, Alex Papps, Anne Kirkpatrick, Bamboo, Beaver, Boh Runga, the Cafe at the Gate of Salvation, Che Fu, the Crocodiles, Chanelle Davis, Dragon, Fane Flaws, Forbidden Joe, Glenn Moffat, Hot Cafe, I Am Joe&#x27;s Music, Jenny Morris (1980, &quot;Tears&quot;), King Kapisi, Kokomo, Linn Lorkin, the Living Hamsters, Marg Layton, Midge Marsden, Neville Purvis, Tony Backhouse and the Umbrellas. With his long-time collaborator Bill Lake he has written for the Pelicans and the Windy City Strugglers, Lake&#x27;s country blues band, who have twice won Best Folk Album in the NZ music awards. Formed in 1968 the Strugglers were the subject of the 2008 Costa Botes documentary &quot;Struggle No More&quot;.

In 2011, he and Strugglers&#x27; bass player Nick Bollinger produced &quot;Shoebox Love Songs&quot;, a CD of traditional Rarotongan love songs by Will Crummer, featuring his daughter Annie. In 2013 and 2014 he was a part-time carer for his friend, stroke survivor Chris Knox.

At the 2013 Silver Scroll Awards, Lorde&#x27;s producer and co-writer Joel Little paid tribute to Baysting for helping at various stages in his career beginning with a songwriting workshop at his school when Little was 10 years old.

In 2013, Justine Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Little Day Out&quot;, featuring his songs, won Best Children&#x27;s Album at the Australian ARIA music industry awards. In 2014 he received a platinum record for 70,000 sales of Clarke&#x27;s CD &quot;I Like to Sing&quot;.

He was a full-time songwriter and often did group songwriting workshops and mentoring with teachers and young musicians.

In October 2018 he was presented with the Nostalgia Award from the Variety Artists Club of New Zealand for his contribution to New Zealand entertainment.

Baysting died on 3 December 2019 after a period of illness. He reportedly had continued to write songs until the end of his life.

<text>WIL-FM (92.3 MHz) is a commercial radio station in St. Louis, Missouri. It airs a country music format and is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting. The studios are on Olive Boulevard, near Interstate 270 in Creve Coeur (with a St. Louis address).

WIL-FM is a Class C station. It has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for most stations. The transmitter is on Butler Hill Road near Keller Road in St. Louis, amid the towers for other local FM and TV stations. WIL-FM uses HD Radio technology. Its HD2 subchannel plays Americana music, known as &quot;Second Fiddle.&quot; The HD3 subchannel plays oldies and feeds FM translator W232CR at 94.3 MHz.

==Format==
WIL-FM plays a variety of country music, concentrating on the hits from the current charts and the last 25 years. WIL-FM personalities include Kasey and Marty Brooks. WIL-FM is programmed by Tommy Mattern and the music director is Marty Brooks. WIL-FM primarily competes with iHeartMedia&#x27;s KSD-FM for country listeners in St. Louis.

==History==
WIL-FM signed on the air on , as the FM sister station to WIL (1430 AM). In its first decade, it mostly simulcast the AM station, which aired a Top 40 format, and were owned by WIL, Inc., a subsidiary of Balaban Stations. At the time, their studios were in Broadcasting House in St. Louis. WIL-FM was only powered at 30,000 watts, a fraction of its current output.

WIL-FM took the call sign KFMS on March 30, 1973. After a year, it returned to WIL-FM, effective September 1, 1974. In the 1970s, WIL had switched to a personality country format, while the FM aired a more music-intensive country format, with less chatter and fewer commercials.

Over time, as more people tuned to the FM band for music listening, WIL-FM became the dominant station. Eventually, the AM station changed its call letters to KZQZ and is now dark. WIL-FM was later acquired by Salt Lake City-based Bonneville International.

Bonneville announced its sale of WIL-FM (and 16 other stations) to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011.

On January 30, 2017, WIL-FM re-branded as &quot;New Country 92.3&quot;. On October 6, 2020, the station dropped the &quot;New Country 92.3&quot; branding and returned to using its call letters in its branding as &quot;92.3 WIL&quot;.

==HD Radio==
Starting in 2012, WIL-FM&#x27;s HD2 digital subchannel began airing Americana music, calling itself &quot;Second Fiddle&quot;. Previously, WIL-FM-HD2 was branded as &quot;Kerosene Country&quot;, and largely had the same playlist as WIL-FM.

On February 18, 2020, WIL-FM signed on a third subchannel, and began airing an oldies format, branded as &quot;My Mix 94.3.&quot; The subchannel feeds FM translator W232CR at 94.3 MHz in Alton, Illinois.

<doc id="925724" wikidata="Q5354685" url="?curid=925724" title="Elections in Georgia (country)">
<text>The single-chamber Parliament of Georgia has 150 members, elected for a four-year term through elections. The last presidential elections were held in October 2018 due to constitutional changes taking effect in 2024, after which the president will be elected for a five-year term by a parliamentary college of electors. The series of constitutional changes, initiated in 2017, stipulated a one-time transitional presidential term of six years for 2018–2024. Other major systemic changes included a move to a fully proportional system by 2024 with a 5% threshold.

==Background==

At the time of the 2017 constitutional change, the 150-seat Georgian parliament was elected through a mixed system of 77 seats by proportional representation (5% threshold) and 73 single-seat majoritarian constituencies. The pressure for a change to a more proportional system started after the 2016 parliamentary election when ruling Georgian Dream garnered 115 out of 150 seats, clearing the constitutional majority of 75%, while it had an overall vote share of 48.7%. Their parliamentary supermajority was driven by winning 71 out of 73 majoritarian constituencies. Ruling Georgian Dream MPs, parliamentary and extra-parliamentary opposition, legal experts and civil society organizations became member of the State Commission at the end of 2016, which was tasked with drafting constitutional reform.

The reforms proposed a change to a fully proportional system for 2020, among other things, but during the process in 2017 ruling Georgian Dream unilaterally changed the constitutional proposals by postponing the electoral transition an election cycle to 2024, inciting national and international criticism. This remained a divisive issue in the following years. In summer 2019 protests in Georgia demanded once more a change to a fully proportional system for the 2020 Georgian parliamentary election which secured a promise from Georgian Dream party leader Bidzina Ivanishvili to do so. In November 2019, however, individual members of parliament voted against a bill to change the electoral system, sparking renewed protests. This eventually led to a political crisis in which EU and U.S. mediated.

Ultimately, the election code was changed for the 2020 elections to a mixed system of 120 proportional (1% threshold, lowered from a one-off 3%) and 30 single-seat majoritarian constituencies. It also barred any party to claim a majority of seats in the Parliament if they receive less than 40% of votes. The 2020 elections were swiftly won by ruling Georgian Dream, under strong protest of the opposition which claimed the elections were rigged, sparking yet another political crisis. The opposition MPs refused to take up their parliamentary mandates. European mediation efforts eventually led in April 2021 to an agreement between opposition and governing parties, which most importantly stipulated snap elections if the ruling Georgian Dream party would garner less than 43% of the vote in the October 2021 local elections, among other electoral reforms and power-sharing conditions. Most parties signed the agreement, and elected opposition MPs took up their parliamentary mandate, which they had refused until then. Ruling Georgian Dream however withdrew from the agreement two months before the October 2021 local elections.

The 2024 Georgian presidential election will be the first indirect election of the President of Georgia by electoral college following changes to the Constitution of Georgia in 2017.

==Statistics==
Since 1990, there have been 33 elections conducted in Georgia, of which eight have been presidential, ten have been parliamentary, eight have been Supreme Council of Adjara, and seven have been local; there has also been one referendum and one plebiscite. The highest recorded number of eligible voters (3,594,810) participated in the presidential elections held on May 26, 1991; on the same occasion, the highest numeric turnout was recorded with 2,978,247 voters. The largest number of observers (1848 international and 13,195 local organizations) were registered by the CEC for parliamentary elections on May 21, 2008.

===First multiparty elections ===
The first independent multiparty elections in Georgia were held on October 28, 1990. Still the Soviet Republic, Georgia was firmly on its way to independence. The Soviet dictate, with its harsh rule, was about to end, illustrated by the first time multiparty elections were conducted.

Fourteen political parties registered for these elections, which were held with a mixed system. The Supreme Council elected 250 (125 proportional, 125 majoritarian) MPs for five years. The total number of voters was 3444 thousand, 67% participated in these elections. Only four parties crossed the threshold and only two parties received mandates under the proportional system:

# &quot;Round Table-Free Georgia&quot; (81 MPs)
# The Communist Party of Georgia (44 MPs)
In the majoritarian system, the places were distributed as follows:
# &quot;Round Table-Free Georgia&quot; (43 MPs)
# Competition (17 MPs)
# People&#x27;s Front (11 MPs)
# &quot;Democratic Georgia&quot; (2 MPs)
# Rustaveli Society (1 MP)

As a result of the advice, &quot;Round Table – Free Georgia&quot; came to power. Electoral commissions of political unions, public associations and organizations, labor collectives, secondary special and higher education institutions of citizens of the Republic of Georgia contributed to the elections. The rest of the rules of holding the parliamentary elections were determined by the law of the Republic of Georgia.

===First presidential elections===

On April 14, 1991, the presidential regime was introduced into Georgia. The elections were deemed to be conducted in case of participation of the majority of total number of voters. Candidates who were supported by more than 50% of the total number of voters were deemed elected. Six candidates participated in these elections:
# Zviad Gamsakhurdia – 2,565,362 votes.
# Valerian Advadze – 240,243 votes.
# Jemal Mikeladze – 51,717 votes.
# Nodar Natadze – 36,266 votes.
# Irakli Shengelia – 26,886 votes.
# Tamaz Kvachantiradze – 8,553 votes

Zviad Gamsakhurdia became the first president of independent Georgia. The total number of voters was recorded at 3,594,810. The number of voters who participated in the elections was recorded at 2,978,247.

<text>At a national level, Greece holds elections for its legislature, the Hellenic Parliament.

== Election of the legislature ==
The Greek Parliament (&quot;Voulí ton Ellínon&quot;) has 300 members, elected for a four-year term by a system of &quot;reinforced&quot; proportional representation. Of the 300 seats, 285 are allocated to 59 constituencies, 50 of which are multi-seat and 9 single-seat. The remaining 15 MPs are elected from nationwide party lists, of which 3 are required to represent the Greek diaspora. Seat allocation to individual parties is done on the basis of their nationwide vote share, provided they have reached the electoral threshold of 3%. In each constituency, voters may select the candidate or candidates of their choice by marking their name on the party ballot.

In 2016, the previous parliament, under a left-wing majority, abolished the reinforced proportionality system, which had been in effect since 2004. The previous system had been boosting the first party&#x27;s seat count with 50 &quot;bonus&quot; seats, in order to facilitate single-party absolute majorities in parliament. It was replaced by a party-list proportional representation system, under which single-party parliamentary majorities, commonly achieved by first parties under previous electoral systems, could now only be achieved with a vote share of at least 45%, effectively making coalition governments the norm. On those grounds, and arguing that proportional representation would cause political instability, the new law was strongly contested by the conservative opposition and failed to get the two thirds supermajority required by the constitution for a new electoral system to be immediately applied in the next election. Hence, the previous system was still applied in the 2019 election, which the opposition won, whereas the new system was applied in the 2023 election for the first time.

In 2020, parliament, under its new conservative majority, repealed party-list proportional representation and reverted the system to a sliding scale majority bonus system. The new system is similar to the pre-2016 reinforced majority system, with the only difference being that the size of the majority bonus is now tied to the largest party&#x27;s national vote share, ranging from a minimum of 20 seats for a vote share of 25% to a maximum of 50 seats for vote shares of 40% and above; no majority bonus is awarded to the first party if its vote share is below 25%. Under normal circumstances, an absolute majority can be achieved by the first party with 38% of the vote. However, as was the case with the proportional representation system voted by the previous parliament in 2016, the two thirds supermajority required by the constitution for a new electoral system to be immediately applied in the next election (in May 2023) was not met, and, therefore, the new system only started to be applied to the next election after that, which was held a month later in June 2023.

Greek citizens aged 17 and over on the year of the election are eligible to vote, and at the age of 25 and over are also eligible to be elected to Parliament. Women&#x27;s suffrage was adopted in 1952.

=== Constituencies ===
Constituencies in Greece have traditionally been multi-seat, and they mostly coincide with prefectures. The number of seats is adjusted once every ten years, following the decennial population census. Prefecture constituencies may not be deprived of representation, nor may they be merged with another prefecture; they may however be split into smaller constituencies if their population increases disproportionately: this was the case with the Athens B constituency which was split into three smaller constituencies in 2019. Population changes have left nine (Kefalonia, Lefkas, Eurytania, Grevena, Samos, Thesprotia, Kastoria, Phocis and Zakynthos) prefectures with a single parliamentary seat each, whereas some urban or suburban constituencies have seen large increases in their seat allotment over the years.

Following the census of 2021, the largest constituencies can be found in the metropolitan areas of Athens and Thessaloniki. These are Athens B3 (19 seats), Thessaloniki A (17 seats), Athens B1 (16 seats), Athens A (13 seats), Athens B2 (12 seats) and East Attica (12 seats). The remaining constituencies elect single-digit numbers of MPs. The largest constituency outside Athens and Thessaloniki is Achaea which has 9 seats.

=== Voting ===
Polling takes place in school buildings on a Sunday, a festive occasion for students who are then given a four-day weekend off. The procedure is run by a presiding judge or attorney-at-law appointed by the local Bar association, and secretarially assisted by local citizens selected by lot in a process resembling jury duty. Local party representatives are allowed to monitor tallying; their theoretical role is to ensure transparency.

Police presence varies as police officers might be allocated to stand guard at an individual polling centre or supervise-that is, to patrol the general vicinity of-more than one polling centre (especially in the countryside). Up until 1998, the responsibility of guarding polling stations was shared between the Hellenic Armed Forces and the Hellenic Police, while there was no provision for laissez faire supervision of multiple polling centres. During the 2019 European Parliament and local elections, police officers on guard received orders not to be armed only during the morning and afternoon shift of the day of the election, something in sharp contrast with past practices, while police unionists noted that the duty of guarding a polling centre should not fall on a single officer per shift. In 2021, the mention of the past presence of armed Hellenic Army soldiers in polling centres by a New Democracy MP in parliament was decried by Avgi.

=== Electoral system ===


The Greek electoral system was codified for the first time by Presidential Decree in 2012; prior to that date it was made up of various pieces of legislation passed at different times. The current system is called &quot;reinforced proportionality&quot; in Greece (ενισχυμένη αναλογική), and is a form of semi-proportional representation with a 50-seat majority bonus for the party that wins a plurality of the vote. There is also an electoral threshold of 3% which all parties and individuals need to pass on a national level before being awarded any seats. These provisions are aimed at helping the largest party secure an absolute majority of parliamentary seats (151 out of 300), enhancing governmental stability. The majority bonus of 50 seats was abolished in 2016, but was still applied at the 2019 Greek legislative election because the new electoral law did not receive a supermajority in Parliament, and can thus not be enforced in the next election.

The May 2023 election saw the electoral system change to a fully proportional representation system, as the majority bonus was abolished by the Syriza government in 2016. The June 2023 election reverted to semi-proportional representation with a sliding scale bonus after it was passed in parliament in 2020.

The 50-seat majority bonus system was used for the first time in the May 2012 election; it reserves 50 parliamentary seats for the party emerges as the largest by total votes cast on a national level. The remaining 250 seats are divided proportionally in parliamentary constituencies according to each party&#x27;s total &quot;valid&quot; vote percentage; this is slightly higher than the raw percentage reported, as there is always a small number of invalidated or &quot;blank&quot; votes (usually less than 1%), as well as the percentage of smaller parties that fail to surpass the 3% threshold, all of which are disregarded for the purpose of seat allotment. The previous law (used in the 2009 legislative elections) was less favorable for the plurality party, as only 40 additional seats were reserved for them.

Articles 99 and 100 of the codified electoral law lay out the way in which parties are allocated seats in accordance with the percentage of votes they received in a legislative election. The introduction of the majority bonus makes seat allocation especially complex, but the steps followed for the allocation of seats are as follows:

* The number of seats a party is entitled to is first determined by dividing the total number of valid votes cast for parties which have surpassed the 3% national threshold and dividing it by 250 (99§2); this is later used to &#x27;correct&#x27; the proportional results in the constituencies, ensuring that 50 seats always remain empty for the majority bonus.
* The 12 seats elected through national-wide party-list are awarded by first determining a quota by taking the total number of valid votes for parties which have surpassed the 3% electoral threshold on a national level and dividing it by 12 (100§1). The total number of valid votes cast for each party is then divided by the quota, and the sum is rounded down, disregarding decimals, to produce the number of seats the party is awarded (100§2), so that a sum of 5.6 for example awards 5 seats to that party. If any of the 12 seats left empty in this step, a seat is awarded to each party in descending order of leftover decimals until all seats have been allocated in this manner (100§3).
* The 7 seats elected through first-past-the-post in single-seat constituencies are awarded to the party which has the most votes in each of the constituencies in question, provided that that party has surpassed the 3% electoral threshold on a national level (100§5).
* The 231 seats elected proportionally in constituencies are awarded by first determining a quota by taking the total number of valid votes cast for all parties in the constituency, regardless of if they have surpassed the 3% electoral threshold on a national level, and dividing it by the total number of seats in the constituency (100§4). The total number of valid votes cast for each party is then divided by the quota, and the rounded down sum corresponds to the number of seats each party is awarded in that constituency (100§4), so that again a sum of 5.6 would be awarded 5 seats. Any party which is entitled to more seats than it had candidates on the ballot paper can only be awarded a number of seats equal to the number of candidates it fielded (100§5). Any leftover seats are then awarded by calculating the difference between the total number of seats a party has received on a national level so far and the seats a party is entitled to according to the first step (100§6). The same procedure is then followed on all constituencies except single-member ones (100§6), to determine which constituencies each party is over- or under-represented in. This sum is used to award one seat, in descending order of sums, to that party which has the highest leftover sum in each of the two-member and three-member constituencies until all seats have been awarded (100§7). If any party has been awarded more seats on a national level than it is entitled to, the extra seats are removed from three-member (or, if necessary, two-member) constituencies in which that party has the lowest leftover sums (100§7). If there are still empty seats, those constituencies are ranked in descending order by leftover sums of parties which have surpassed the 3% electoral threshold on a national level, and one seat is awarded in each constituency to the smallest party by total number of valid votes above the 3% threshold, until that party has been awarded the total number of seats it is entitled to according to the first step (100§8). If there are still seats available, the last step is followed again and seats awarded to each party in ascending order of valid votes received, until all seats have been awarded.
*The 50 seats of the majority bonus elected in constituencies are awarded after the above steps have been completed, ensuring that 50 seats remain available for the largest party (99§3a). A coalition can also be awarded the 50 seats provided that the average percentage of votes for each party in the coalition is larger than the percentage of votes received by the largest party on a national level, and in that case it is the Supreme Civil and Criminal Court of Greece that decides on whether a coalition qualifies for the allocation of the 50 seats (99§3b).

A rather complicated set of rules deals with rounding decimal results up or down, and ensures that the smaller a constituency is, the more strictly proportional its parliamentary representation will be. Another set of rules apportions the 50 seat premium for the largest-tallying party among constituencies. Individual seats are apportioned by &quot;cross of preference&quot;. Voters mark a cross next to the name of the candidate or candidates they prefer, the number of crosses varying from one to five depending on constituency size. Ballots with no crosses or more crosses than allowed, count for only the party but not the individual candidates.

Tallying is done manually in the presence of representatives of all contesting parties. Party tallying, which is easier, is done first so that returns may be announced quickly. Individual candidate tallying is done next and can take several days. Once the number of seats per party and constituency is determined, the seats are filled on a top-down basis from the individual cross-of-preference tallies. Party heads and acting or past Prime Ministers are exempt from cross-of-preference voting: they are automatically placed at the top of their party list and are elected, provided their party achieves at least one seat in the particular constituency.

By constitutional provision, the electoral law can be changed by simple parliamentary majority, but a law so changed comes into effect in the next-but-one election, unless a two-thirds parliamentary supermajority (200 or more votes) is achieved. Only in the latter case is the new electoral law effective at the next election. A case in point is the current electoral law, which was passed in 2020. Because this law was passed by a simple majority, it was not used for the subsequent May 2023 election, but could be used in the June 2023 election.

=== Electorate ===
All Greek citizens aged 17 or over in the year of the election are eligible to vote, provided they are on the electoral register, unless:
* they are imprisoned for a criminal offence &quot;and&quot; they have been expressly deprived of the right to vote by judicial decision (this happens only in the rare cases of high treason or mutiny). Incarcerated persons vote in polling stations specially set up inside prisons
* they are mentally incapable of making a reasoned judgement, according to a judicial decision. In practice, this applies only to a percentage of institutionalised mental patients

According to Presidential Decree 26/2012(as amended by law 4648/2019), article 4, 1 January is-for electoral purposes-considered the birthday of all citizens turning 17 in that year. As such, citizens are able to vote in elections before their actual birthday, provided that they turn 17 in the year.

In the past, citizens who reached adulthood had to register and were issued an &quot;election booklet&quot; with which they voted. Nowadays, registration for voters is not needed: it is done automatically each year by municipal authorities; catalogues of to-be voters (coming of age the next year) are composed during November of the previous year. They do not become part of electoral catalogues, till 1 January. Identity is proved by state-issued ID cards or passport. Special registration is necessary only for absentee voting, which is done at the place of a voter&#x27;s temporary residence on election day. Many Greeks choose to retain their voting rights in their family&#x27;s original home, sometimes by reason of tradition, sometimes by reason of patronage.

Since the abolition of Electoral Booklets in 2001, each and every voter is provided with a 13-digit Special Electoral Number. This number is used solely for proving the uniqueness of the voter and excluding any possibility of double voting. Any other use of the number is deemed illegal and carries a penalty of at least a year in prison and fine from €2934.70 up to €29,347.03, unless other acts have taken place. 
This number consists of:
* a four-digit code corresponding to a Municipality or Community(0101-Agia Varvara to 5410-Psara) 
* the last three digits of the voter&#x27;s birth year (999 for 1999, et cetera)
* a five-digit code that reflects the ranking of each new voter, in relation to his year of birth, which is unique per Municipality or Community and is allocated to the basis of first available number
* a number (or letter) in relation to the aforementioned codes used for the verification of the correct registration of all the 12-digit sequence.
The Special Electoral Number remains the same, even if the voter chooses to transfer his voting rights to another constituency.

The Constitution provides, following the amendment of 2001, for the right of Greek citizens living abroad to vote for the legislative elections and the law implementing this constitutional provision was passed in 2019.

Compulsory voting is the law in Greece but is not enforced. In the past a citizen had to present an up-to-date election booklet to be issued a driver licence or a passport, or else justify why they did not vote (e.g. because of absence, infirmity, or advanced old age). Nowadays the civic duty of voting is still considered &quot;mandatory&quot; but there are no sanctions for failing to vote.

Turnout at national elections is low: a mere 61.8% at the 2023 election.

=== Political culture ===


Before 1910, Greece lacked a coherent party system in accordance with the traits of the modern representative democracy. The political formations of the 19th century lacked a steady organizational structure and a clear ideological orientation. Sometimes, they constituted just the incoherent and ephemeral escort of a prominent politician.

The first Greek parties with an ideological background, conforming to the modern conception of a political party, appeared after 1910, when Eleftherios Venizelos rose to predominance in Greek political life and founded his Liberal Party. The liberal wave of Venizelism resulted soon in the reaction of the &quot;old-system&quot; political leaders, who formed the core of an opposing conservative movement, which used the monarchy as its main rallying banner. Thereby, the two biggest ideological movements, the republican centrist-liberal and the monarchist conservative, emerged and formed massive political organizations.

The centrist and the conservative parties bitterly confronted each other in the ensuing legislative elections for many decades, until metapolitefsi. After the &quot;metapolitefsi&quot; of 1974, the leftist-socialist movement supplanted the centrists and took the main part of their electorate. A smaller part of erstwhile centrists, along with most conservatives, affiliated themselves with the centre-right New Democracy party, which self-defined as a liberal party and drafted the republican Constitution of 1975.

Until recently, Greece has had a two-party system dominated by the liberal-conservative New Democracy (ND) and the center-left Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). Other parties won far fewer seats. Beginning in the May and June 2012 legislative elections, SYRIZA (the Coalition of the Radical Left) overtook PASOK as the main force of the left wing. After almost three years of opposition to the ND-PASOK coalition government, SYRIZA took the most votes in the January 2015 elections and formed government, while PASOK just barely crossed the threshold.

Currently, the left is represented in Parliament by the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), SYRIZA, PASOK-KINAL, Course of Freedom and the New Left. To the right of ND, lies Kyriakos Velopoulos&#x27; Greek Solution, Niki and the Spartans.

=== 2023 election ===


== Election of the President of the Republic ==
The head of state – the President of the Hellenic Republic – is elected by Parliament for a five-year term, and a maximum of two terms in office. Eligible for President is any person who:
* has had Greek citizenship for at least five years,
* has a father or a mother of Greek origin,
* is 40 years old or more, 
* is eligible to vote.
When a presidential term expires, Parliament votes to elect the new president. In the first two votes, a 2/3 majority (200 votes) is necessary. The third vote requires a 3/5 (180 votes) majority. The fourth vote requires an absolute majority (151 votes). The fifth vote requires a plurality; in case of a split vote, the candidate who collected most votes in the first vote is elected president.

Before the 2019 constitutional amendment, if the third vote was fruitless, Parliament was dissolved and elections were proclaimed by the outgoing president within the next 30 days. In the new Parliament, the election for president was repeated immediately with a 3/5 majority required for the initial vote, an absolute majority (151 votes) for the second one and a ballot between the two persons with the highest number of votes in the second election for the third and final This occurred twice before the amendment of the provision for the dissolution of the parliament: in the 1990 and 2015 elections.

=== Elected presidents of the Third Hellenic Republic (1974–present) ===


== European Parliament elections ==
Greece has had a delegation of Members of the European Parliament in the European Parliament since Greek accession to the EU in 1984. Originally, the Greek delegation numbered 25, but after 2004 that was reduced to 24 (due to the increase of the EU member countries). In 2009, it was further reduced to 22, and in 2014 to 21 MEPs.

=== Electoral system ===
In the European elections, the whole country forms a single constituency and an electoral threshold is set at 3% of the vote. Members of the government and elected members of the Hellenic Parliament may only stand for election after having resigned from office.

Until 2014, the MEPs were elected on the basis of a party-list proportional representation system. Starting with the 2014 European Parliament election, candidates are elected on the basis of individual preference votes with a maximum of four preferences per voter.

== Local elections ==
Local administration in Greece recently underwent extensive reform in two phases: the first phase, implemented in 1997 and commonly called the &quot;Kapodistrias Project&quot;, consolidated the country&#x27;s numerous municipalities and communities down to approximately 1000. The second phase, initially called &quot;Kapodistrias II&quot; but eventually named the &quot;Callicrates Project&quot;, was implemented in 2010; it further consolidated municipalities down to 370, and merged the country&#x27;s 54 prefectures into 13 peripheries. The Callicratean municipalities were designed according to several guidelines; for example each island (except Crete) was formed into a single municipality, while the majority of small towns were incorporated so as to have an average municipal population of 25,000.

The first prefectural elections took place in 1994; previously, prefects were executive appointees. Municipal elections were held since the formation of the modern Greek state, in the early 19th century.

Local administrators elected in 2010, following the Callicrates reform, were to serve a &quot;rump&quot; 3.5-year term. Starting in 2014, peripheral and municipal elections were to be held every five years, concurrently with elections for the European Parliament. However, this was changed to 4 years in 2018. In all local elections, the winning candidacy list is guaranteed a minimum three-fifths majority in the respective councils.

== Referendums ==
The current Constitution provides for two kinds of referendums:
* a referendum concerning a &quot;passed law&quot;
* a referendum concerning a matter of &quot;national interest&quot;.

The latest referendum was indeed concerning a matter of &quot;national interest&quot;, in contrast to all the previous ones that concerned the form of government, specifically regarding the Greek monarchy.

=== Previous referendums ===
There were 7 referendums in Greece from 1920 to 1974. All but one had to do with the form of government, namely retention/reestablishment or abolition of the monarchy. The 1974 referendum resulted in confirming of the parliamentary republic. The only referendum not concerning only the form of government was the constitutional referendum in 1968 held by the military junta. There were no referendums in Greece between 1974 and 2014. In 2015, the Greeks voted no on the bailout proposed by the ECB and IMF, which was however rejected by the government.

<doc id="925732" wikidata="Q5073150" url="?curid=925732" title="Chapeltown, Leeds">
<text>Chapeltown is a suburb of north-east Leeds, in West Yorkshire, England. It is part of the Leeds City Council Ward of Chapel Allerton. It is approximately one mile north of Leeds city centre. 

==Location and boundaries==
Chapeltown is an informally defined neighbourhood with no official boundaries. Ordnance Survey maps place Chapeltown at around National Grid Coordinates SE430500, 437500, south of Harehills Lane (B6159) and east of Scott Hall Road (A61).

Chapeltown Road runs north through Potternewton to Harehills Lane that is it leads to Chapeltown but is not on it. A wider definition is it is in &quot;the LS7 postal region, and can be mapped through four points; where Scott Hall Road runs to north to where it intersects with Potternewton Lane, where Harehills Lane runs east and intersects with Avenue Hill, where Spencer Place runs south and intersects with Roundhay Road, to the very bottom and beginning of Chapeltown Road.&quot; The NHS Chapeltown Health Centre is at its south-east junction, the corner of Spencer Place and Leopold Street. 

The Office for National Statistics define a Chapel Allerton South &amp; Chapeltown statistical output area, which follows the LS7 postcode boundary on the east, with LS8 being Harehills. Roundhay Road could also be considered the boundary between them. However, it is widely accepted that Markham Avenue and Gathorne Terrace are the dividing line between Chapeltown and Harehills. Harehills is adjacent, and the areas are commonly considered together.

Neighbouring areas include Chapel Allerton to the north, Scott Hall to the west, Harehills to the east, Sheepscar to the south, and Potternewton either to the north or included. Taking the larger area, the main thoroughfare of Chapeltown is Chapeltown Road which passes through the centre of the area north–south for about , linking Sheepscar Interchange (at the edge of Leeds city centre) and Harehills Lane/Chapel Allerton. Spencer Place in the east is another through route, and once well known as a red light district although the area&#x27;s popularity with prostitutes has reportedly recently declined.

===Chapeltown and Potternewton===

The names &quot;Chapeltown&quot; and &quot;Potternewton&quot; have become virtually interchangeable for the same area. The civil parish that governed the area before the expansion of Leeds County Borough in 1904 was called &quot;Potter Newton&quot;, and the name is still used by the Church of England for the ecclesiastical parish of St. Martin&#x27;s Church. The Ordnance Survey also lists the name &quot;Potternewton&quot; rather than &quot;Chapeltown&quot;. Royal Mail classifies the area around Oak Road and St Marys Close as Potternewton, but does not list any road as Chapeltown. However, Leeds City Council now uses the name &quot;Chapeltown&quot; to refer to the area.

====Potternewton Park====
Potternewton Park in the north-east of the area is the venue for Europe&#x27;s oldest West Indian Carnival; Leeds Carnival. Norma Hutchinson Park, a smaller playground and sports field in the south of Chapeltown was previously named Buslingthorpe Recreation Ground and was renamed in 2009 to commemorate Jamaican-born local councillor, Norma Hutchinson, who died in 2004.
===Transport===
Chapeltown is served by First Leeds&#x27; bus services 2, 3, 3A, 36 and 48, which run directly via Chapeltown Road. The hourly service 48 does not operate in the evenings or on Sundays. Service 91 (Pudsey-Halton Moor) runs along Harehills Lane.

===Schools===

Bracken Edge Primary School is on Newton Garth adjacent to Potternewton Park. It was rebuilt and extended in 2007. Hillcrest Primary School, off Cowper Street has hosted events such as PFS (playing for success). Holy Rosary and St Annes Catholic School is on Leopold Street. Leopold Primary School, closed by 2002 because of overcrowding, became the Chapeltown Children Centre. Chapeltown Community Nursery is on Reginald Street.

==History==
The name &quot;Chapeltown&quot; is in origin a reduced form, first attested in 1427, of Chapel Allerton, and once denoted the same place. Ralph Thoresby, writing in 1715, records &quot;Chapel-Town&quot; as a common name for the township of Chapel Allerton, describing it as &quot;well situated in pure Air, upon a pleasant Ascent, which affords a Prospect of the Country ten or twelve miles&quot;. The open space to its east and north of &quot;Potter-Newton&quot; was &quot;a delicate Green commonly call&#x27;d &quot;Chapel-Town Moor&quot;&quot;.

Chapeltown Moor was in the manor of Newton (Potternewton), some , used for races, archery contests, and in 1765 one of the first cricket matches in Yorkshire, between &quot;the Gentlemen of Chapeltown and the Gentlemen of Sheffield&quot;. By 1809, it was mostly enclosed.

In the 19th century, the area was developed as a wealthy suburb, and many large terraces and villas from the period remain, though a large proportion have fallen into disuse or are divided into smaller, low-rent flats. The area remains leafy and architecturally notable. Buildings have been adapted by successive communities who have settled in the area as places of worship and for a range of social uses. The Union Chapel on Chapeltown Road became a synagogue and then a Sikh temple, although it is now disused following a period of disrepair and fire damage. Chapeltown Barracks, now demolished, were completed in 1820.

===Development===

A map made of Leeds in 1834 shows that Chapeltown was pasture land between Chapel Allerton and Potternewton and Leeds and known as Potternewton. Through the centre of the farmland, which was earmarked as a planned &quot;New Town&quot; suburb, ran the Leeds-Harrogate Turnpike Road which later became Chapeltown Road. Much of the land, called &quot;Squire&#x27;s Pastures&quot; belonged to Earl Cowper. He owned much land east of Chapeltown Road and some to the west. In the final decades of the 18th century and early decades of the 19th century legal disputes arose regarding the estates of the Barker/Ray family who had built Potternewton Hall &quot;for the widow, Mrs Barker, to retire to&quot; in the 1730s. They owned the estate, both the &quot;upper house&quot; (Potternewton Hall) and the &quot;lower house&quot; (Newton Hall) which was described by Ralph Thoresby, as a &quot;venerable old fabric, standing low and shady&quot;. In &quot;the first year of the sixteenth century&quot;, Low Hall (Newton Hall) had an estate worth 300 pounds a year. In 1837, Darnton Lupton was the Mesne lord under Earl Cowper of Potternewton Hall Estate.

Earl Cowper began selling land for development in 1825, but planning and building was slow, and the sale was not completed until 1873. The Earl also set out a Deed of Arrangement defining the residential character of any future building including the limitation of livestock, heavy industry and public houses.

By 1866 the area east of Chapeltown Road and north of Roundhay Road had acquired streets of pleasant houses intended for the growing middle class, and known as New Leeds.

Further north towards Potternewton work began in 1856 on Newton Grove where the Lupton family developed their Newton Park Estate following the designs of Charles Chorley and John Connon. The development expanded, including Sholebroke Avenue by the 1880s. 
 St Martin&#x27;s Church and shops on Chapeltown Road were built on Newton Park Estate land in the late 19th century. By the 1890s, the popularity of Chapeltown waned, in favour of areas further from the city. The remaining empty plots were filled with smaller, cheaper, terraced housing. By the start of the 20th century, the area was almost completely filled with housing. Newton Hall which had been the Lupton family residence was demolished in the 1920s. Potternewton Hall demolished c. 1935. Little building work took place in Chapeltown throughout the 20th century, unlike many other areas which were subject to slum clearances. Neighbouring Harehills was much the same. One reason that could have led to Chapeltown being left was the quality of its housing stock, although they now largely achieve low rents, the houses are generally well built as they were originally built for the influx of Leeds&#x27; new middle class brought on by the industrial revolution.

===Population===

Over time Chapeltown has been home to successive émigré communities that have each added a new dimension to the culture, religious practices and heritage of the area.

Ashkenazi Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe towards the end of the 19th century moved to Leeds and settled in the inner city area of the Leylands. Other groups of Jews also settled there, and synagogues were built. In the 20th century many of the community moved north to the more desirable area of New Leeds/Chapeltown, and so did their synagogues, at one time there were 14 in Chapeltown. Along with neighbouring Harehills, where Montague Burton established his factory, Chapeltown was an important area for tailoring and allied trades, which occupied many Jews, and is remembered by the street name Button Hill.

In 1932 the Chapeltown Road New Synagogue, a large domed Byzantine-style building, was opened. The opening was in time for the High Festivals of that year, with Rabbi Hurwitz delivering that first Shabbat Shuvah sermon. The artist David Hillman was commissioned, in 1935, to design three stained-glass windows for the shul (synagogue) in commemoration of the Silver Jubilee of King George V. They have been moved to Shadwell Lane Synagogue. In the following decades the Jewish population in Chapeltown declined as many families moved north to the Moortown area. In 1985 the synagogue closed and the building was bought by Leeds City Council. It is now home to the Northern School of Contemporary Dance.

The British African-Caribbean community in Leeds mostly came to the UK between the end of the Second World War and the early 1960s. Many of the first Jamaicans to settle in Leeds were ex-servicemen. To encourage mass immigration from the countries of the British Empire and Commonwealth to fill shortages in the labour market, the 1948 British Nationality Act gave British citizenship to all people living in Commonwealth countries, and full rights of entry and settlement in Britain. Many of the first generation of Jamaicans living in Chapeltown today immigrated during this period. The Jamaica Society was formed, with headquarters at 277 Chapeltown Road to support the needs and celebrate the contributions of the African-Caribbean population in West Yorkshire and Leeds.

===Recent history===
In May 2003, Leeds City Council designated parts of Chapeltown/Potternewton as a conservation area in recognition of its special architectural and historic interest and to protect its character from harmful change. This enlarges the St Mary&#x27;s Road (Chapeltown) conservation area on the former Newton Park Estate; this area being first designated in December 1974.

Around 2009/2010 the area became less run down with Spencer Place being prostitute free, the bus lane on Chapeltown Road being extended to serve the full length of the road, the addition of a bicycle lane, the decaying buildings getting repaired and the addition of the Reginald Centre, a joint service centre which replaces the original library in the area (similar to the Compton Centre in Harehills).

There are many innovative Co-op housing associations in Chapeltown such as Cornerstone Housing Co-operative, 301 Housing Co-operative and Chapeltown Cohousing.

==Culture and environment==
The area is home to a wide range of community and creative organisations including the Northern School of Contemporary Dance, the Chapeltown house choir, the Host Media centre, and Leeds West Indian Centre (now famous for its club nights, particularly the monthly &quot;SubDub&quot;).

Chapel Allerton Hospital is found in the area, and is one of Leeds&#x27; main hospitals, though it does not have an Accident and Emergency department.

===Carnival===

Every August bank holiday weekend the area hosts the Leeds Carnival, second only in size to London&#x27;s Notting Hill Carnival, however Leeds Carnival started in 1967 and predates that of Notting Hill.
Arthur France, a Leeds University student from Saint Kitts helped to organise the first West Indian Carnival in Britain in Leeds in 1967. That year Vicki Celto was the first Carnival Queen for Leeds in a costume titled &quot;Sun Goddess&quot;.

===Northern School of Contemporary Dance===
The NSCD is a modern conservatoire dance school with its origins in the Leeds dance education of the 1970s and 1980s. Two years after the founding of the school in 1985, it moved to its current home in Chapeltown in 1987. The Riley Theatre was built in the former synagogue, and over the next ten years a number of new dance studios were created on the site and the Brandsby Lodge was renovated. Today the school is a contemporary dance institution with nearly 200 students.

===Crime===
As a neighbourhood with a history of economic downturn, Chapeltown has been popularly associated with crime. The area has suffered social problems, including street drug dealing and gun crime in the last decade. However, Findaproperty.com states that Chapeltown&#x27;s association with crime is &quot;grossly exaggerated&quot;. The Leeds Index of Deprivation ranked Chapeltown 20th out of 108 areas of the city for problems with community safety, and it is ranked as safer than most other inner-city areas of Leeds.

In July 1981, it was one of the areas within cities that were home to race riots across England. There have been sporadic moments of social unrest since then including a riot in 1987.

The most recent riot occurred on 29 July 1991, when around 100 youths went on a spree of looting and vandalism throughout the area. Police believed that the main culprits of the riot were members of a local drugs gang.

During the 2011 England riots there were &quot;small pockets of disorder&quot; in Chapeltown after a local man was shot in the face and later died in hospital; it was later confirmed that a group of 10–15 youths caused damage to three cars in the area.

==Religion==
The changing population of the area is shown by the religious buildings, particularly along the Chapeltown Road. At the North end, by Chapel Allerton Hospital, is the 1976 Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Czestochowa &amp; St. Stanislaw Kostka, serving the Polish community. (The Warsaw Stores on Chapeltown Road was a major source of Polish food in Leeds before a proliferation of Eastern European shops.) Further down is St Martin&#x27;s Church, the original Anglican parish church of the village of Potternewton, now with a mainly West Indian congregation. Then comes the Church of God of Prophecy, a Pentecostal church with a mainly Afro-Caribbean congregation. Next door is the new Sikh Temple, the largest in Leeds. Opposite, now out of use, is a church which was originally a Union Chapel, then a Synagogue and then a Sikh Temple until the new one was constructed. Near the South end, the Holy Rosary Church was built in 1937 for the Irish Catholic community. Until 1985 the next building down was an impressive purpose-built synagogue, the largest in Leeds, which is now the Northern School of Contemporary Dance. The Roscoe Methodist Church on Francis Street (off Chapeltown Road) dates from 1974, but replaces a chapel founded in 1862.

Elsewhere, a former United Reformed Church (1906) has become the Chapeltown Community Church by Potternewton Park. The Church of the Three Hierarchs in Harehills Avenue is a former Methodist chapel reopened as a Greek Orthodox church in 1966. As late as 1993, maps showed four synagogues in the area including the main one, but these have all closed. The first mosque in Leeds was created in a house in Leopold Street in 1961. With the influx of Muslims from India and Pakistan in the 1960s and 1970s, larger buildings were acquired in 1974 and 1982 to become the main mosque in Leeds, and finally in 2001 the Central Jamia Mosque was completed on Spencer Place.

<text>Latvia elects on the national level a legislature. The Saeima has 100 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation with a 5% threshold. An unmodified Sainte-Laguë method is used to allocate seats. The parliamentary elections are held on the first Saturday of October. Locally, Latvia elects municipal councils, consisting of 7 to 60 members, depending on the size of the municipality, also by proportional representation for a four-year term.

Latvia has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

==2022 parliamentary election==
A parliamentary election was held on 1 October 2022.
==Referendums==
The Constitution of Latvia prescribes a referendum for five purposes:
* recalling of the Parliament (Article 14)
* acceding to the European Union (Article 68)
* accepting substantial changes in the terms regarding the membership in the European Union (if requested by 50% of the Parliament) (Article 68)
* accepting legislation suspended by the President (Article 72)
* amending the Constitution or adopting a law (Article 78)

One tenth of registered voters have the right to initiate a national referendum regarding recalling of the Parliament. Voter turnout needed is two thirds of the number of the voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament. The Constitution imposes several restrictions on when the recall referendum can be held. It cannot be held:
* one year after the parliamentary elections
* one year before the parliamentary elections
* six months before the presidential elections
* six months after the last recall referendum.
There has been one such referendum, the parliamentary dissolution referendum of 2011.

Substantial changes in the terms regarding Latvia&#x27;s membership of the European Union must be decided by a national referendum if such a referendum is requested by at least one-half of the members of the Parliament.

In certain cases the President or one third of members of the Parliament have the right to suspend the proclamation of a law for a period of two months. A referendum will be held on that law if in that two-month period one tenth of the electorate requests a referendum, except if the Parliament again adopts the law by three three-quarters super-majority. Voter turnout needed is 50% of the number of voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament. If no referendum is requested in the two-month period, then the law is put into effect. Such a referendum has been held on three occasions: in 1998, 1999 and 2007

The Constitution limits issues which can be submitted to a referendum. It forbids issues like budgets, taxes, military conscription, declarations of war, peace treaties, agreements with other nations, etc.

One tenth of the electorate can request amendment of the Constitution or adoption of a law. If the Parliament does not accept the amendment or the draft law, then it will be submitted to a referendum. Certain parts of the Constitution can be amended only by a referendum. An absolute majority (majority of all electors, regardless of voter turnout) is required for an amendment or a draft law to pass on such a referendum. The exception is decisions regarding Latvia&#x27;s membership of the EU or substantial changes in the terms of membership of the EU - those measures need a voter turnout of 50% of the number of voters who participated in the last elections for the Parliament. Amendments to the Constitution have been put to a referendum in 2 cases: in 2008 and 2012; the same was done for a draft law in 2008 and a European Union membership referendum was held in 2003.

There have been 13 referendums in Latvia&#x27;s history: 4 in the 1923–1934 period and 9 since 1991.

<text>Turner Classic Movies (TCM) is an American movie-oriented pay-TV network owned by Warner Bros. Discovery. Launched in 1994, Turner Classic Movies is headquartered at Turner&#x27;s Techwood broadcasting campus in the Midtown business district of Atlanta, Georgia.

The channel&#x27;s programming consists mainly of classic theatrically released feature films from the Turner Entertainment Co. film library – which comprises films from Warner Bros. (covering films released before 1950), Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (covering films released before May 1986), and the North American distribution rights to films from RKO Radio Pictures. However, Turner Classic Movies also licenses films from other studios and occasionally shows more recent films. Unlike its sister networks TBS, TNT, and TruTV, TCM does not carry any sports coverage through Turner Sports.

The channel is available in the United States, Canada, Malta (as Turner Classic Movies), Latin America, France, Greece, Cyprus, Spain, the Middle East and Africa (as TNT).

==History==
===Origins===
In 1985, nine years before the launch of Turner Classic Movies, Ted Turner announced plans to acquire the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer/United Artists film studio for $1.5 billion. On March 25, 1986, the deal was finalized, with Turner renaming the studio MGM Entertainment Co. Furthermore, Turner&#x27;s purchase of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer separated the studio from United Artists, which remained with Kirk Kerkorian, after they had merged in 1981. However, concerns over MGM and Turner Broadcasting&#x27;s corporate debt load (totaling $2 billion) resulted in Turner selling the studio back to Kerkorian, from whom Turner had purchased the studio less than a year before. 

On August 26, 1986, Turner sold MGM&#x27;s production and distribution assets for $300 million to United Artists, while MGM&#x27;s production and film laboratories were sold for $190 million to Lorimar-Telepictures. However, Turner Broadcasting still retained the MGM film library, primarily for its cable &quot;superstation&quot; WTBS. Following the exchange, Turner rebranded his organization Turner Entertainment Company. 

The film library of Turner Entertainment Co. would serve as the base form of programming for Turner Classic Movies upon the network&#x27;s launch. Before the creation of Turner Classic Movies, films from Turner&#x27;s library of movies aired on the Turner Broadcasting System&#x27;s advertiser-supported cable network TNT along with colorized versions of black-and-white classics such as &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;.

=== Launch and contributions (1994–1996) ===

Turner Classic Movies debuted on April 14, 1994, at 6 p.m. Eastern Time, with Ted Turner launching the channel at a ceremony in New York City&#x27;s Times Square district. The date and time were chosen to mark the exact centennial anniversary of the first commercial exhibition of a motion picture in the United States. &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) was the first film broadcast on TCM; it was also the same film that served as the debut broadcast of its sister channel TNT six years earlier on October 3, 1988. At the time of its launch, Turner Classic Movies was available to approximately 1 million cable television subscribers.

The network originally served as a competitor to AMC, which at the time was known as &quot;American Movie Classics&quot; and was owned by Rainbow Media (now AMC Networks), a subsidiary of the now-defunct Cablevision. AMC maintained a virtually identical format to Turner Classic Movies, as both networks largely focused on films released prior to 1970 and aired them in an uncut, uncolorized, and commercial-free format.

=== Time Warner ownership (1996–2018) ===
In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner which, besides placing Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros. Entertainment under the same corporate umbrella, also gave Turner Classic Movies access to Warner Bros.&#x27; library of films released after 1950 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the Lorimar, Saul Zaentz and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, Turner Classic Movies had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel.

In the early 2000s, AMC abandoned its commercial-free format, which led to Turner Classic Movies being the only movie-oriented basic cable channel to devote its programming entirely to classic films without commercial interruption or content editing. By 2002, AMC had broadened its film content to feature colorized and more recent films. That same year, AMC retired the American Movie Classics name due to shifting its programming. It now mainly airs dramas and documentaries.

=== TCM Movie Database (2006–2019) ===
Launched in 2006, Turner Classic Movies maintains its own comprehensive database of actors, actresses, and film crew (listing more than 1.25 million people, with 15,000 written biographies), and motion picture titles (more than 130,000 titles), not limited to the film libraries that Turner Classic Movies owns, and it includes links by which a user can request that Turner Classic Movies schedule any title for viewing.&lt;ref name=&quot;tcm.com/tcmdb&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;TCM Movie Database&quot; has lost some functionality. The portal page is now unavailable, yet database entries are still available and function. Richard B. Steiner was the creator, architect, and supervisor of &quot;TCM Movie Database&quot;. By 2013, the &quot;Watch TCM&quot; app for iOS, Android, and Blackberry had some &quot;TCM Movie Database&quot; information. Leonard Maltin&#x27;s reviews appear in the TCM Movie Database.

=== Corporate restructuring (2019–present) ===
On March 4, 2019, Time Warner&#x27;s new owner AT&amp;T (who renamed the company WarnerMedia) announced a planned reorganization to effectively dissolve the Turner Broadcasting System division, which involved Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, Turner Classic Movies, and digital media company Otter Media being transferred directly under Warner Bros. Entertainment. Aside from Otter, which was transferred to WarnerMedia Entertainment on May 31, 2019 to oversee development of HBO Max, the newly transferred properties came under a newly formed division, Warner Bros. Global Kids, Young Adults and Classics.

On September 1, 2021, Turner Classic Movies introduced a new logo and slogan, &quot;Where Then Meets Now&quot;, in the network&#x27;s first major rebranding since its launch. The rebranding was intended to give Turner Classic Movies a more modern and energetic presentation while continuing to emphasize its commitment to showcasing classic cinema; new branding elements include Technicolor-inspired color schemes, and a new stylized &quot;C&quot; in its wordmark, which resembles a camera lens and symbolizes themes of &quot;curation&quot;, &quot;context&quot;, &quot;culture&quot; and &quot;connection&quot;.

In March 2023, it was announced that TCM was marking the centennial of Warner Bros., in conjunction with The Film Foundation and the TCM Classic Film Festival. This included special airings of newly-restored Warner Bros. films: &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (introduced by Martin Scorsese), and &quot;East of Eden&quot; (introduced by Wes Anderson and Joanna Hogg).

On June 20, 2023, multiple TCM executives (including executive vice president Pola Changnon, who had been with Turner for over 25 years) were released by the channel&#x27;s current owner, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), as part of layoffs affecting its U.S. Networks division. The network was to be moved under the oversight of Cartoon Network head Michael Ouweleen, and it was reported that there were plans for more synergies and cross-promotion of TCM with the rest of the networks group. The layoffs led to concerns over the future of the channel, with filmmakers Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and Paul Thomas Anderson holding a meeting with WBD CEO David Zaslav to discuss them. They later issued a joint statement, explaining that the channel has been a &quot;precious resource of cinema, open 24 hours a day seven days a week&quot;, and had &quot;always been a profitable endeavor&quot;.

On June 23, 2023, WBD appointed the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group&#x27;s CEOs Michael De Luca and Pamela Abdy as heads of the network, reporting to head of U.S. Networks Kathleen Finch. The pair stated that &quot;We have each spent time talking to Zaslav, separately and together, and it&#x27;s clear that TCM and classic cinema are very important to him. Our primary aim is to ensure that TCM&#x27;s programming is untouched and protected.&quot; On June 28, it was announced that Scorsese, Spielberg, and Anderson would actively collaborate with De Luca and Abdy on the network&#x27;s direction; a spokesperson stated that &quot;TCM is not immune to the very real pressure on the entire linear ecosystem, but we have taken steps to ensure that we stay true to the mission of the network — bringing more titles to the air, driving content investment, and preserving and protecting the culture of cinema.&quot;

==Programming==
Turner Classic Movies essentially operates as a commercial-free service, with breaks between films usually consisting of promos for its programming, advertising for the network&#x27;s events and merchandising, and interstitial segments profiling classic film actors and actresses. In addition to this, extended breaks between features are filled with theatrically released movie trailers and classic short subjects – from series such as &quot;The Passing Parade&quot;, &quot;Crime Does Not Pay&quot;, &quot;Pete Smith Specialties&quot;, and Robert Benchley – under the banner name &quot;TCM Extras&quot; (formerly &quot;One Reel Wonders&quot;). In 2007, some of the short films featured on Turner Classic Movies were made available for streaming on Turner Classic Movies&#x27;s website. Partly to allow these interstitials, Turner Classic Movies schedules its feature films either at the top of the hour or at :15, :30 or :45 minutes past the hour, instead of in timeslots of varying five-minute increments.

Turner Classic Movies&#x27; film content has remained mostly uncut and uncolorized (with films natively filmed or post-produced in the format being those only ones presented in color), depending upon the original content of movies, particularly movies released after the 1968 implementation of the Motion Picture Association of America&#x27;s ratings system and the concurrent disestablishment of the Motion Picture Production Code. Because of this, Turner Classic Movies is formatted similarly to a premium channel with certain films – particularly those made from the 1960s onward – sometimes featuring nudity, sexual content, violence and/or strong profanity; the network also features rating bumpers prior to the start of a program (most programs on Turner Classic Movies, especially films, are rated for content using the TV Parental Guidelines, in lieu of the MPAA&#x27;s rating system).

The network&#x27;s programming season runs from March of one year until the following February of the next when a retrospective of Oscar-winning and Oscar-nominated movies is shown, called &quot;31 Days of Oscar&quot;. As a result of its devoted format to classic feature films, viewers who are interested in tracing the career development of actresses such as Barbara Stanwyck or Greta Garbo or actors like Cary Grant or Humphrey Bogart have the unique opportunity to see most of the films that were made during their careers, from beginning to end. Turner Classic Movies presents many of its features in their original aspect ratio (widescreen or full screen) whenever possible – widescreen films broadcast on Turner Classic Movies are letterboxed on the network&#x27;s standard definition feed. Turner Classic Movies also regularly presents widescreen presentations of films not available in the format on any home video release.

Occasionally, Turner Classic Movies shows restored versions of films, particularly old silent films with newly commissioned musical soundtracks. Turner Classic Movies is also a major backer of the Descriptive Video Service (created by Boston PBS member station WGBH-TV), with many of the films aired on the network offering visual description for the blind and visually impaired, which is accessible through the second audio program option through most television sets, or a cable or satellite receiver. After Turner’s merger with Time Warner, it began to air classic films made by Warner Bros., mainly those before the 1960s.

During the prime time hours, an ident for the &quot;Watch TCM&quot; app is shown after every movie. Watch TCM is Turner Classic Movies’ official mobile app. Certain titles on Turner Classic Movies are not available to streaming services, due to restrictions through this service platform, and during these scheduled times, the movie title is blocked from airing and a visual notice is provided to the viewer.

===&quot;Now Playing&quot;===
Turner Classic Movies formerly published &quot;Now Playing&quot;, a monthly program guide, originally available through a standalone subscription, which provided daily listings and descriptions for films scheduled to air on Turner Classic Movies in the coming month. The digest-size magazine highlighted a featured actor on the cover, and featured essays about the &quot;guest programmer&quot; as well as a movie-and-actor themed crossword puzzle. The May 2017 issue, following the death in March 2017 of host Robert Osborne, contained &quot;Remembering Robert Osborne&quot; by Ben Mankiewicz.

Turner Classic Movies ceased print publication of &quot;Now Playing&quot; (which had been one of the few channel-specific program guides that remained in print circulation for most of the 2000s and 2010s) with the August 2017 issue, moving it to an electronic format available via email free of charge.

===Movie library===
Turner Classic Movies&#x27; library of films spans several decades of cinema and includes thousands of film titles. Before its launch in April 1994, Turner&#x27;s film library had included pre-1986 MGM and RKO films, as well as all pre-1948 Warner Bros. films. In August 1993, TCM obtained exclusive rights to 300 films from Paramount Pictures, for a cost of $30 million. In August 1996, TCM obtained an exclusive, three-year licensing deal to 36 films from Sony Pictures Entertainment (primarily film content from Columbia Pictures and TriStar Pictures).

In April 2004, near their 10th anniversary, TCM purchased the television licensing rights to 146 titles from Universal Pictures and Columbia Pictures. In August of the same year, 20th Century Fox agreed to license several classic film titles from their library. In 2014, Walt Disney Studios agreed to license titles from their library, including episodes from their anthology television series. These were aired during their &quot;Treasures From the Disney Vault&quot; programming block, hosted by film historian Leonard Maltin. 

Turner Classic Movies includes movies in the public domain, mostly from the 1900s to 1920s. Although most movies shown are from the 1930s through the 1970s, the channel sometimes shows newer movies.

===Hosted and special programming===
====Regular features====
Most feature movies shown during the prime time and early overnight hours (8:00 p.m. to 2:30 a.m. Eastern Time) were presented by film historian Robert Osborne. He was the network&#x27;s first host since its 1994 launch until 2016, except for a five-month medical leave from July to December 2011, when guest hosts presented each night&#x27;s films. In September 2003, Ben Mankiewicz was hired as the network&#x27;s daytime weekend host. In October 2012, Osborne announced he was delegating his on-air appearances over to Mankiewicz, who assumed primetime hosting duties on Fridays by the next year. Osborne nevertheless continued hosting the &quot;Private Screenings&quot; and &quot;The Essentials&quot; series.

In January 2014, during his &quot;Noir City&quot; film festival in San Francisco, Eddie Muller announced he had been hired as an on-air host for the network. In May 2016, Tiffany Vasquez, a graduate of NYU Tisch School of the Arts, became the network&#x27;s first female host, introducing films on Saturday afternoons. She had previously won TCM&#x27;s 20th Anniversary Ultimate Fan Contest, flying to Atlanta to introduce a film of her choice on-air with Robert Osborne. In January 2018, Vasquez announced on Twitter she had taped her last introductions and her contract was not renewed. That same year, Dave Karger and Alicia Malone were jointly announced as full-time hosts for the network. In September 2019, Jacqueline Stewart was hired and became the network&#x27;s first African-American host.

=====&quot;Star of the Month&quot;=====
Turner Classic Movies regularly airs a &quot;Star of the Month&quot; throughout the year in which most, if not all, feature films from a film star are shown during that night&#x27;s schedule. August is the only month to not have a &quot;Star of the Month&quot; due to &quot;Summer Under the Stars&quot;. 

=====&quot;Silent Sunday Nights&quot;=====
&quot;Silent Sunday Nights &quot; is a weekend late-night programming block showcasing silent cinema broadcasting on Sunday midnights Eastern Time. Its first broadcast was on April 17, 1994 when it aired Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;The Cameraman&quot; (1928). In 2013, Ben Mankiewicz began hosting the block. In September 2019, Jacqueline Stewart became the current host. Two years later, in September 2021, Sibling Rivalry, a New York City-based independent creative agency, designed the latest bumper intro for the block.

=====&quot;TCM Imports&quot;=====
&quot;TCM Imports&quot; is a weekend late-night programming block showcasing international cinema. Originally broadcast on Friday nights at 2 a.m. Eastern Time, the block was moved to late Saturday nights. It currently airs on Sunday nights at 2 a.m. Eastern Time. In 2013, Mankiewicz began hosting the block. In March 2019, Alicia Malone became the current host.

The first bumper intro was designed by the animation studio Cuppa Coffee Studios, which featured several stop-motion animated men rolling a giant globe brandishing the programming logo. During the 2010s, the logo design studio Hool &amp; Co. designed a new bumper featuring a customary countdown meant to highlight several international film movements. In September 2021, Sibling Rivalry designed the latest bumper. 

=====&quot;Noir Alley&quot;=====
During its early years, TCM devoted a programming block to the &quot;film noir&quot; genre titled &quot;Darkness After Dawn&quot;. In March 2017, the program was rebranded as &quot;Noir Alley&quot;, hosted by Eddie Muller. &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941) was its first broadcast. It broadcasts on Saturday nights and repeats on Sunday mornings at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. 

In January 2013, Muller had previously hosted a four-film marathon block titled &quot;Night in Noir City&quot;. In June of the same year, he was invited back to host their &quot;Friday Night Spotlight,&quot; showcasing 16 noir films with adapted stories by crime fiction writers, including Dashiell Hammett and James M. Cain. He was invited back again for the &quot;Summer of Darkness&quot; retrospective in 2015, which proved popular with viewers.

=====&quot;Musical Matinee&quot;=====
In October 2022, TCM announced their latest programming block titled &quot;Musical Matinee&quot; broadcasting musical films, primarily from the Golden Age of Hollywood. The program is hosted by Dave Karger and broadcasts on Saturday afternoons Eastern Time. &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952) was the block&#x27;s first film broadcast on November 5, 2022. 

=====&quot;TCM Guest Programmer&quot;=====
TCM features a monthly programming block called the &quot;TCM Guest Programmer&quot;, in which one of the hosts is joined by a celebrity guest responsible for choosing that evening&#x27;s films (examples of such programmers during 2012 include Jules Feiffer, Anthony Bourdain, Debra Winger, Ellen Barkin, Spike Lee, Regis Philbin and Jim Lehrer). Since 2023, the &quot;TCM Guest Programmer&quot; block has appeared sporadically, with appearances from Martin Scorsese (during his promotional tour of his 2023 film &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;), Noah Baumbach, George Miller (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film &quot;&quot;), Kevin Costner (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film &quot;&quot;), and Ryan Reynolds (during his promotional tour of his 2024 film &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;). 

====Seasonal blocks====

Turner Classic Movies suspends its regular schedule twice each year for a special month of film marathons. &quot;31 Days of Oscar&quot; is a programming block airing each Oscar season on the network during the month of the Academy Awards. Each feature that TCM airs in this block can be either an Oscar winner or nominee. Each August, TCM airs &quot;Summer Under the Stars&quot;, featuring an entire daily schedule devoted to the filmographies of a particular actor, with programming pertaining to the star of the day. 

====Defunct programming blocks====
In the summer of 2007, the channel debuted &quot;Funday Night at the Movies&quot;, a block hosted by actor Tom Kenny (best known as the voice of SpongeBob SquarePants). This summer block featured classic feature films (such as &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Sounder&quot;, &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Robin Hood&quot;, and &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot;) aimed at introducing these movies to new generations of children, and their families. 

In 2008, &quot;Funday Night at the Movies&quot; was replaced by &quot;Essentials Jr.&quot;, a youth-oriented version of its weekly series, &quot;The Essentials&quot; (originally hosted by actors Abigail Breslin, and Chris O&#x27;Donnell, then by John Lithgow from 2009 to 2011, and then by Bill Hader, starting with the 2011 season), which included such family-themed films as &quot;National Velvet&quot;, &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;, and &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot;, as well as more eclectic selections, such as &quot;Sherlock Jr.&quot;, &quot;The Music Box&quot;, &quot;Harvey&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, and &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;.

In 2014, the channel debuted &quot;Treasures from the Disney Vault&quot;, hosted by Leonard Maltin. This block showcased a compilation of vintage Disney feature films, cartoons, documentaries, episodes of Disney&#x27;s anthology television series&quot;,&quot; and episodes of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. The last scheduled &quot;Treasures from the Disney Vault&quot; aired on September 2, 2019 due to the launch of Disney+ in November of that year.

&quot;TCM Underground&quot; debuted in October 2006 as a Saturday late night block which focused on cult film. The block was originally hosted by rocker/filmmaker Rob Zombie until December 2006; , it was the only regular film presentation block on the channel that did not have a host. &quot;TCM Underground&quot; was discontinued in February 2023 after its programmer, Millie De Chirico, was laid off from the network.

===Documentaries===
In addition to films, Turner Classic Movies also airs original content, mostly documentaries about classic movie personalities, the world of filmmaking and particularly notable films. An occasional month-long series, &quot;Race and Hollywood&quot;, showcases films by and about people of non-white races, featuring discussions of how these pictures influenced white people&#x27;s image of said races, as well as how people of those races viewed themselves. Previous installments have included &quot;Asian Images on Film&quot; in 2008, &quot;Native American Images on Film&quot; in 2010, &quot;Black Images on Film&quot; in 2006 &quot;Latino Images on Film&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Arab Images on Film&quot; in 2011. The network aired the film series &quot;Screened Out&quot; (which explored the history and depiction of homosexuality in film) in 2007 and &quot;Religion on Film&quot; (focusing on the role of religion in cinematic works) in 2005. In 2011, TCM debuted a new series entitled &quot;AFI&#x27;s Master Class: The Art of Collaboration&quot;.

===TCM Remembers===

Many films shown on Turner Classic Movies were made during the Golden Age of Hollywood, an era with few survivors. In December 1994, Turner Classic Movies debuted &quot;TCM Remembers&quot;, a tribute to recently deceased film personalities (including actors, producers, composers, directors, writers, and cinematographers) which occasionally airs during promotional breaks between films. The segments appear in two forms: individual tributes and a longer end-of-year compilation. Following the recent death of an especially famous film personality (usually an actor or filmmaker), the segment will feature a montage of select shots of the deceased&#x27;s work.

Every mid-December, a more inclusive &quot;TCM Remembers&quot; interstitial is produced, featuring a selection of clips interspersed with scenes from settings such as an abandoned drive-in (2012) or a theatre which is closing down (2013). Since 2001, most of the soundtracks for these have been introspective melodies by indie artists such as Badly Drawn Boy (2007) or Steve Earle (2009). 2015&#x27;s song, &quot;Quickly Now&quot;, was written especially for &quot;TCM Remembers&quot; by Chuck Moore and Reid Hall, and sung by Eryn McHugh.

====TCM Remembers soundtracks====
==Accolades==

Turner Classic Movies received a 2008 Peabody Award for its dedication to film preservation and &quot;a continuing, powerful commitment to a central concept—the place of film in social and cultural experience&quot;.

Turner Classic Movies received a 2013 Peabody Award for its presentation of Mark Cousins&#x27; &quot;The Story of Film: An Odyssey&quot;, a 15-episode documentary about the development and advancement of the medium of motion pictures. Drawing on its exhaustive film library, Turner Classic Movies complemented each episode with short films and feature films from the familiar to the little-seen. The Peabody Award praised Turner Classic Movies&#x27;s &quot;The Story of Film&quot; &quot;for its inclusive, uniquely annotated survey of world cinema history&quot;.

==Streaming==
In April 2016, TCM announced it had partnered with The Criterion Collection to create a subscription streaming service called FilmStruck. The service included a curated selection of more than 1,000 classic Hollywood, international, arthouse and independent films, including those from the Janus Films and Kino libraries. FilmStruck was launched on November 1, 2016, and included exclusive bonus content such as hosted introductions, interviews and rare media. In November 2018, FilmStruck was shut down by WarnerMedia, under the ownership of AT&amp;T, to streamline business operations.

Since its 2020 launch, TCM has been associated with its parent company Warner Bros. Discovery&#x27;s Max streaming service. TCM has its own category hub on the service with a curated selection of classic films.

==Merchandising and events==
===TCM Vault Collection===
The TCM Vault Collection consists of several different DVD collections of rare classic films that have been licensed, remastered and released by Turner Classic Movies (through corporate sister Warner Bros. Home Entertainment). These boxed set releases are of films by notable actors, directors or studios that were previously unreleased on DVD or VHS. The sets often include bonus discs including documentaries and shorts from the Turner Classic Movies library. The initial batch of DVDs are printed in limited quantities and subsequent batches are made-on-demand (MOD).
* &quot;Universal Collection&quot; – Featuring films licensed by Turner Classic Movies from the Universal Pictures vault. 
* &quot;The Lost RKO Collection&quot; – Featuring RKO films from the 1930s. 
* &quot;TCM Spotlight&quot; – A series of DVD box sets released by Warner Home Video featuring Charlie Chan and stars such as Esther Williams, Errol Flynn, Jean Arthur, Deanna Durbin, and Doris Day.

===TCM Wine Club===
In October 2015, Turner Classic Movies announced the launch of the TCM Wine Club, in which they teamed up with Laithwaite to provide a line of mail-order wines from famous vineyards such as famed writer-director-producer Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s winery. Wines are available in 3-month subscriptions and can be selected as reds, whites, or a mixture of both. From the wines chosen, Turner Classic Movies also includes recommended movies to watch with each, such as a &quot;True Grit&quot; wine, to be paired with the John Wayne film of the same name.

===TCM Young Composers Film Competition===
In 2000, Turner Classic Movies started an annual Young Composers Film Competition, inviting aspiring composers to participate in a judged competition that offers the winner of each year&#x27;s competition the opportunity to score a restored, feature-length silent film as a grand prize, mentored by a well-known composer, with the new work subsequently premiering on the network. As of 2006, films that have been rescored include the 1921 Rudolph Valentino film &quot;Camille&quot;, two Lon Chaney films: 1921&#x27;s &quot;The Ace of Hearts&quot; and 1928&#x27;s &quot;Laugh, Clown, Laugh&quot;, and Greta Garbo&#x27;s 1926 film &quot;The Temptress&quot;.

===TCM Classic Film Festival===
In April 2010, Turner Classic Movies launched their first Classic Film Festival, an event—now held annually—at the Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theater and the Grauman&#x27;s Egyptian Theater on Hollywood Boulevard. The Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel serves as the festival&#x27;s key venue for special events. Initially hosted by Robert Osborne, the four-day festival features celebrity appearances, special events, and screenings of around 50 classic films, including several newly-restored films by The Film Foundation, an organization devoted to preserving Hollywood&#x27;s classic film legacy. 

The Classic Film Festival was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and was moved to a virtual setting, billed as the &quot;Special Home Edition&quot;. In 2021, the festival was cancelled again as a live event, and continued its virtual setting. In 2022, the festival returned to its live setting, with its theme being &quot;All Together Now: Back to the Big Screen.&quot; A year later, the festival celebrated the centennial anniversary of Warner Bros. launching with the premiere of a newly-restored edition of &quot;Rio Bravo&quot; (1959).

===TCM Classic Cruise===
In 2011, TCM launched its inaugural Classic Cruise event, first aboard the &quot;Celebrity Millennium&quot; cruise ship traveling from Miami to Key West and Cozumel. In 2013, the Classic Cruise held its maiden voyage aboard the &quot;Disney Magic&quot; for the first time. In 2016, the cruise instead used the &quot;Disney Fantasy&quot;, which holds 4,000 passengers compared to the &quot;Magic&quot; 2,700-passenger accommodation. In 2019, the Classic Cruise returned from a three-year absence aboard the &quot;Disney Magic&quot;, sailing from New York to Bermuda.

==International versions==

Turner Classic Movies is available in many other countries around the world. In Canada, Turner Classic Movies began to be carried on Shaw Cable and satellite provider Shaw Direct in 2005. Rogers Cable started offering Turner Classic Movies in December 2006 as a free preview for subscribers of its digital cable tier, and was added to its analogue tier in February 2007. While the schedule for the Canadian feed is generally the same as that of the U.S. network, some films are replaced for broadcast in Canada due to rights issues and other reasons. Other versions of Turner Classic Movies are available in France, Greece, Canada, Spain, Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America, Nordic countries, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta. The UK version operated two channels, including a defunct spinoff called Turner Classic Movies 2. TCM UK ceased operations on 6 July 2023.

<text>Hunslet () is an inner-city area in south Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is southeast of the city centre and has an industrial past.

It is situated in the Hunslet and Riverside ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds South parliamentary constituency. The population of the previous City and Hunslet council ward at the 2011 census was 33,705.

Many engineering companies were based in Hunslet, including John Fowler &amp; Co. manufacturers of traction engines and steam rollers, the Hunslet Engine Company builders of locomotives (including those used during the construction of the Channel Tunnel), Kitson &amp; Co., Manning Wardle and Hudswell Clarke. Many railway locomotives were built in the Jack Lane area of Hunslet.

The area has a mixture of modern and 19th century industrial buildings, terraced housing and 20th century housing. It is an area that has grown up significantly around the River Aire in the early years of the 21st century, especially with the construction of modern riverside flats. It was at one point the main production site for Leeds Creamware, a type of pottery (still produced) so called because of its cream glazing. Hunslet is now prospering as it follows the trend of Leeds generally and the expansion of office and industrial sites south of Leeds city centre.

==Etymology==
Hunslet is first mentioned as &quot;Hunslet&quot; (sic, for &quot;*Hunsflet&quot;) in the Domesday Book of 1086, though twelfth-century spellings of the name such as &quot;Hunesflete&quot; seem to be more conservative: the name appears originally to have meant &#x27;Hūn&#x27;s creek&#x27;, from an Anglo-Saxon personal name &quot;Hūn&quot; (or &quot;Hūna&quot;) and the Old English word &quot;flēot&quot; &#x27;creek, inlet&#x27;, probably referring to an inlet from the River Aire (&gt; &quot;-fleet&quot; : Adlingfleet, &quot;Adelingesfluet&quot; 1086 ; Marfleet, &quot;Merefluet&quot; 1086 ; Ousefleet, &quot;Useflete&quot; 1100–1108). There are also the Old Norse personal names &quot;Húnn&quot; (Old Danish &quot;Hun&quot;) and &quot;Húni&quot;, cognates of &quot;Hūn(a)&quot;. The district of Hunslet Carr, whose name is first attested in the period 1175–89 as &quot;Kerra&quot;, includes the northern English dialect word &quot;carr&quot;, meaning &#x27;bog&#x27; (borrowed into English from Old Norse &quot;kjarr&quot;, which had the same meaning, but more commonly &quot;copsewood&quot;, &quot;brushwood&quot;, &quot;thicket&quot;). Meanwhile, Hunslet moor is first mentioned in 1588.

Notice : Hunslet is possibly related etymologically to the place-name Honfleur in Normandy, which is probably of Anglo-Scandinavian origin and mentioned as &quot;Huneflet&quot; in 1025, &quot;Hunefleth&quot; in 1082 - 87.

== History ==

At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, the manor of Hunslet belonged to the Lacys, from whom it passed to various families including the Gascoignes and the Neviles. Hunslet was the birthplace of Thomas Gascoigne, born in 1404 and later chancellor of Oxford University.

The brewers Joshua Tetley and Son set up business in Hunslet in 1822 producing beer and bitter today as part of Carlsberg Tetley group. However, in 2011 the brewery closed.

In 1823 forty working men from Hunslet raised the sum of which they sent to the radical publisher Richard Carlile who was serving a prison sentence in Dorchester gaol for the publications in which he exposed the reactionary policies of the government of Lord Liverpool. The subscription was accompanied by a noble letter written by one of the contributors, William Tillotson.

The population of Hunslet grew rapidly in the first half of the 19th century becoming an important manufacturing centre. Several large mills were built for spinning of flax including Hunslet Mill, and there were chemical works, works for the manufacture of crown and flint glass, extensive potteries for coarse earthenware and the Leeds Pottery. Hunslet Mill, created between 1832 and 1842, is a Grade II listed building.

From 1898 to 1935 it was the home of the Leeds Steel Works, with four blast furnaces, which was the site of a major industrial accident in 1913, when a boiler explosion killed nine men. Thirteen years earlier, four men had died in a very similar explosion. By 1906 Hunslet was home to Leeds’ second-largest gas works, the city&#x27;s main rail goods yards, known at the time as Midland Goods Station (now the site of Crown Point Retail Park), as well as a large number of factories.

Hunslet was home to the first free public library in Leeds when a branch library opened on evenings from October 1870 in a room at the Hunslet Mechanics Institute. It became a day branch in 1912. On 23 February 1931, the new building was opened by Arthur Greenwood MP and Minister for Health. The fixtures and fittings in the interior of the library, with an adult and junior reading room, were designed by Thomas Horsman and Co Ltd, costing . The building is now Hunslet Library and Community Hub.

Crown Point once had a large railway depot which contained Leeds&#x27; main goods station. After many decades lying derelict the area was redeveloped into the Crown Point Retail Park, though the main railway cutting into the terminus station can still be seen at the southern end. The former track beds are currently let for storage and contain timber and brickwork. Tetley&#x27;s Brewery was to the north of this area, as was the Yorkshire Chemical Works: both have now been demolished. Next to the river is Clarence Dock.

Pottery Fields is the industrial area around Kidacre Street, Leathley Road, Ivory Street, Meadow Lane and Cross Myrtle Street where Leeds City Council&#x27;s Pottery Fields Depot and the former Meadow Lane Gas Works are situated. Pottery Fields House, has the administrative and engineering functions for Northern Gas Networks. Other businesses include Merlin Gerin medium voltage electrical supplies, a scrap yard and Volkswagen auto breakers, and a motorcycle training centre. There are several disused railways crossing the roads, which brought coal from Middleton Colliery to the Meadow Lane Gas Works for the production of town gas, before conversion to North Sea natural gas.

Penny Hill surrounds Church Street. This is the old centre of Hunslet referred to as Hunslet Grange when the Leek Street Flats (1968 to 1983) were built. The Leek Street Flats developed problems with crime and condensation and were demolished fifteen years after their construction.

The area was redeveloped in the 1960s, the main feature of this being the Hunslet Grange (Leek Street flats). In the 1980s it was again redeveloped, and in the 2000s, the area around the River Aire and Clarence Dock was redeveloped.
Aire Park, a new public open space and redevelopment, is now being planned for the site surrounding The Tetley art gallery as part of the regeneration of the South Bank of Leeds.

== Governance ==
Hunslet was formerly a township in the parish of Leeds, in 1866 Hunslet became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1925 the parish was abolished and merged with Leeds. In 1921 the parish had a population of 71,626.

== Geography ==
Hunslet, in the lower Aire Valley, is bounded on the east by the River Aire and covers nearly 1,200 acres of flat land. The underlying rocks were coal measures.
Hunslet has different areas including Hunslet Moor, Hunslet Carr, Crown Point, Pottery Fields and Penny Hill.

== Economy ==
Hunslet today is still primarily based around manufacturing and heavy engineering. Newer industries have moved to the western fringes of the area in recent years with the building of new office complexes including the Leeds City Business Park which originally opened with offices for companies including O2 and British Gas. O2 have since moved to Morley. The Morrisons supermarket in the Penny Hill Centre as well as the Costco wholesale warehouse on Leathley Road are also large employers. In 2011, Aston Barclay, a car auction group, purchased the former Motor Auctions Leeds car centre on Hillidge Road to further add to the regeneration of the area.

According to an article by the Yorkshire Evening Post, 43% of the area&#x27;s population lives in poverty and it has the ninth highest child poverty rate in the country, with a reported 4,579 children having been fed by food banks between April 2019 and February 2020.

== Religion ==

A chapel dedicated to St. Mary the Virgin was built in 1636, and enlarged in 1774. It was a brick structure with a tower. It was enlarged by subscription in 1826. There were two churches built on the site. The Victorian church, of which the spire remains, is the tallest in Leeds, was built in 1864 and the new church building surrounding it was built in the 1970s but was demolished in 2019.

Other smaller less notable churches exist in the district. The area is also home to St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Club (near a St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church that was demolished in 2005 and is now part of the parish of St Margaret Clitherow).

== Hunslet Grange (Leek Street Flats) ==
Hunslet&#x27;s redevelopment in the 1960s was notable for the construction of the Hunslet Grange (usually known as &#x27;Leek Street Flats&#x27;). Construction of the 350 flats and maisonettes started in 1968 following a widespread slum clearance project in the area. The complex was commissioned by Leeds City Council and built by Shepherd Construction, in a maisonette style with so-called &#x27;streets in the sky&#x27; and overhead walkways connecting blocks. The exterior of the buildings were pale grey pebbledashed concrete. Each floor had a rubbish disposal chute leading to huge bins at street level. Hidden in the complex on the second floor were shops and a public house, &#x27;The Pioneer&#x27;. Twelve of the blocks were six storeys in height and six were of seven, with the entrance on the second floor. The estate covered a large area of Hunslet and was arranged in three clusters around a small park.

The individual flats had large windows and were spacious and light, and were very popular with their new tenants. But the popularity was short-lived; the heating systems were inadequate for the poorly insulated concrete prefabricated buildings, the interiors suffered from condensation and the exterior walls became streaked with black. In addition, the &quot;rabbit-warren&quot; layout made the estate hard to navigate and, within a few years, even harder to police.

Demolition of the complex started in 1983, less than fifteen years after the first tenants moved in, to be replaced with low-rise council housing, which was largely built around the late 1980s. Low Rise private housing was added in the 1990s and 2000s and a public space known as Hunslet Green occupies much of this space.

== Charities and voluntary organisations ==

The area is home to a number of voluntary organisations servicing the community, this includes the Hunslet Club, a youth organisation established in 1940 which provides sport, dance and drama activities for hundreds of young people in the area as well as offering vocational education courses for 14- to 16-year-olds.

Hunslet is also the home of Voluntary Action Leeds, the Council for Voluntary Service in Leeds, which provides direct support services and specialist advice to Voluntary Sector organisations across the city.

== Transport ==
The M621 and A61, two major roads, pass through the area, providing convenient access to the whole of Yorkshire and access the M62 to Manchester and Hull. The motorway was completed in 1971, and isolated a large part of Hunslet Moor.

Leeds Hunslet Lane railway station was located on the Hallam Line. It opened in 1840, but in 1846 the Midland Railway replaced it with Leeds Wellington station, and Hunslet Lane became a goods depot, which closed in 1972: the area is now occupied by the Crown Point Retail Park. There was also a passenger station on Hillidge Road: this is gone, but the Station Hotel remains. The railway yard is now used as the Leeds Vehicle Maintenance Facility for Freightliner.

==Education==
An educational hub has been formed in the north of Hunslet, with Leeds City College&#x27;s Printworks Campus using the former Alf Cooke printworks building, Leeds College of Building&#x27;s Cudbear Street site, the Ruth Gorse Academy, and University Technical College Leeds (UTC) using the former Braime&#x27;s engineering works, all in close proximity to each other.

Bewerley Street Infant School, designed by famous Leeds architect, George Corson, opened on 8 August 1873. By the 1950s, the school was for Juniors (7 – 11 Years) and the Infants had moved to a school on Hunslet Hall Road.

== Sport ==
The area has a rugby league club with historic roots in the form of Hunslet who play at the John Charles Centre for Sport formerly known as the South Leeds Stadium. 

The original Hunslet, who played at Parkside, Hunslet, were the first club in Rugby League to win &quot;All Four Cups&quot; in season 1907–08, the Challenge Cup, the RFL Championship, the Yorkshire County League Cup and the Yorkshire County Cup. Only two other clubs have achieved this feat, Huddersfield (1914–15) and Swinton (1927–28). Other local rugby league clubs include Hunslet Warriors, and Hunslet Parkside.

<doc id="925739" wikidata="Q1423142" url="?curid=925739" title="Sender ID">
<text>Sender ID is an historic anti-spoofing proposal from the former MARID IETF working group that tried to join Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Caller ID. Sender ID is defined primarily in Experimental RFC 4406, but there are additional parts in RFC 4405, RFC 4407 and RFC 4408.

== Principles of operation ==

Sender ID is heavily based on SPF, with only a few additions.

Sender ID tries to improve on SPF: SPF does not verify the header addresses (of which there can be more than one) that indicate the claimed sending party. One of these header addresses is typically displayed to the user and may be used to reply to emails. These header addresses can be different from the address that SPF tries to verify; that is, SPF verifies only the &quot;MAIL FROM&quot; address, also called the envelope sender.

However, there are many similar email header fields that all contain sending party information; therefore Sender ID defines in RFC 4407 a Purported Responsible Address (PRA) as well as a set of heuristic rules to establish this address from the many typical headers in an email.

Syntactically, Sender ID is almost identical to SPF except that codice_1 is replaced with one of:
* codice_2meaning to verify the envelope sender address just like SPF.
* codice_3 or codice_4meaning to verify both the envelope sender and the PRA.
* codice_5meaning to verify only the PRA.

The only other syntactical difference is that Sender ID offers the feature of &quot;positional&quot; modifiers not supported in SPF. In practice, so far no &quot;positional&quot; modifier has been specified in any Sender ID implementation.

In practice, the &quot;pra&quot; scheme usually only offers protection when the email is legitimate, while offering no real protection in the case of spam or phishing. The &quot;pra&quot; for most legitimate email will be either the familiar From: header field, or, in the case of mailing lists, the Sender: header field. In the case of phishing or spam, however, the &quot;pra&quot; may be based on Resent-* header fields that are often not displayed to the user. To be an effective anti-phishing tool, the MUA (Mail User Agent or Mail Client) will need to be modified to display either the &quot;pra&quot; for Sender ID, or the Return-Path: header field for SPF.

The &quot;pra&quot; tries to counter the problem of &quot;phishing&quot;, while SPF or &quot;mfrom&quot; tries to counter the problem of spam bounces and other auto-replies to forged Return-Paths. Two different problems with two different proposed solutions. However, Sender-ID and SPF yield the same result in approximately 80% of the cases, according to a billion message analysis.

==Standardization issues==
The &quot;pra&quot; has the disadvantage that forwarders and mailing lists can only support it by modifying the mail header, e.g. by inserting a codice_6 or codice_7. The latter violates RFC 2822 and can be incompatible with RFC 822.

With SPF, mailing lists continue to work as is. Forwarders wishing to support SPF only need to modify SMTP MAIL FROM and RCPT TO, not the mail. This concept is not new: with the original RFC 821 SMTP forwarders always added their host name to the reverse path in the MAIL FROM.

The most problematic point in the core Sender ID specification is its recommendation to interpret codice_1 policies like codice_3 instead of codice_2. This was never intended by all published SPF drafts since 2003, and for an unknown large number of codice_1 policies an evaluation for &quot;pra&quot; could cause bogus results for many cases where &quot;pra&quot; and &quot;mfrom&quot; are different. This problem was the basis of an appeal to the Internet Architecture Board (IAB). In response to another prior appeal the IESG already noted that Sender ID cannot advance on the IETF standards track without addressing the incompatibility with a MUST in RFC 2822.

Various surveys performed in 2012, when SPF turned from experimental to proposed standard, showed that fewer than 3% of mail domains published specific requests for using the &quot;pra&quot;, compared to some 40~50% of mail domains using SPF.

== Patents ==
The Sender ID proposal was the subject of controversy regarding licensing issues: Microsoft holds patents on key parts of Sender ID and used to license those patents under terms that were not compatible with the GNU General Public License and which were considered problematic for free software implementations in general. On October 23, 2006, Microsoft placed those patents under the Open Specification Promise, which is compatible with some free and open source licenses, but not with the most recent version of the GPL license, version 3.x.

<doc id="925740" wikidata="Q765896" url="?curid=925740" title="Elections in the Republic of Ireland">
<text>In Ireland, direct elections by universal suffrage are used for the President, the ceremonial head of state; for Dáil Éireann, the house of representatives of the Oireachtas or parliament; for the European Parliament; and for local government. All elections use proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote (PR-STV) in constituencies returning three or more members, except that the presidential election and by-elections use the single-winner analogue of STV, elsewhere called instant-runoff voting or the alternative vote. Members of Seanad Éireann, the second house of the Oireachtas, are partly nominated, partly indirectly elected, and partly elected by graduates of particular universities.

Coalition governments have been the norm since 1989. Fine Gael (or its predecessor Cumann na nGaedheal) or Fianna Fáil have led every government since independence in 1922. The current government is a coalition of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party. Traditionally, the Labour Party was the third party, although since 2016 it has been surpassed by Sinn Féin, and since 2020 by the Green Party. Smaller parties and independents exist in the Dáil and more so in local government.

Since 2023, electoral operations and oversight of electoral integrity have been carried out by an independent Electoral Commission.

==Eligibility to vote==

Entitlement to vote is based on citizenship. Residents of the state who are Irish citizens or British citizens may vote in elections to Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas (parliament). Residents who are citizens of any EU state may vote in European Parliament elections, while any resident, regardless of citizenship, may vote in local elections.

The right of Irish expatriates to vote is heavily restricted. Only members of the armed forces and diplomatic staff abroad may vote in Dáil elections, while only expatriates who are graduates of the National University of Ireland or Trinity College Dublin may vote in Seanad elections to the university constituencies.

==Early voting==
Military personnel, whether serving at home or abroad, vote by postal ballot. These votes are delivered by a courier service, usually a commercial one, but a military courier is used for ballots cast by Irish troops in Lebanon and Syria. Voters living on islands off the west coast in counties Galway, Mayo, and Donegal traditionally voted two or three days before polling day, but in 2014 the gap was narrowed, when they voted just one day beforehand. Following an amendment to electoral law in 2022, early voting on the islands is allowed only in exceptional circumstances.

==General elections==
Under the Constitution, the term of a Dáil is a maximum of seven years; statute law, currently the Electoral Act 1992, establishes a lower maximum of five years. The Taoiseach may advise the president to dissolve at any time. If a Taoiseach has ceased to retain the support of the majority of the Dáil, the president may in their absolute discretion refuse to dissolve the Dáil. To date, no president has refused to dissolve the Dáil.

Electoral law provides that the &quot;same Dáil shall not continue for a longer period than five years from the date of its first meeting&quot;. When the Dáil is dissolved, the Clerk of the Dáil must issue a writ of election to the returning officer for each constituency. The election must take place on a date set by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage 18 to 25 days (disregarding any excluded day) after the writs have been issued.

Elections are by single transferable vote (STV), with each constituency returning between three and five deputies, each called a or TD. From 1980, constituencies have been redrawn by an independent Constituency Commission after each census, which was put on a statutory basis in 1997. From 2023, these functions have been carried out by the Electoral Commission.

The erection and removal of campaign posters by candidates is governed by the Litter Pollution Act 1997 and the Electoral (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 2009. Posters may only be erected for a certain specified time period before an election. This time period is either (a) 30 days before the poll date or (b) from the date the polling day order for the election has been made, whichever provides the shorter period of time. Posters must be removed within 7 days of polling day.

==Seanad elections==
Elections to Seanad Éireann take place after the general election to the Dáil. There are sixty members of the Seanad. Of these, eleven are nominated by the Taoiseach appointed next after the dissolution of the Dáil. Six are elected by STV in university constituencies: three for the National University (by graduates) and three for Dublin University (by graduates and scholars of Trinity College Dublin). Forty-three are elected by an electorate of serving politicians (members of the incoming Dáil, the outgoing Seanad, and city and county councillors) for five vocational panels. These elections are also counted using STV, although using a different set of rules on the distribution of surpluses and the order of counts than in other elections in Ireland.

==European elections==
Elections to the European Parliament are held simultaneously across Europe every five years. In Ireland, as for Dáil elections, STV is used in constituencies returning three to five members. Ireland has 14 seats in the European Parliament.

==Local elections==
Elections to county councils, city councils and city and county councils are held every five years and by convention take place on the same day as European elections. Local electoral areas (LEAs) return between three and seven councillors by STV. Until the Local Government Reform Act 2014, elections were also held for borough and town councils. The 2014 Act abolished borough and town councils with their functions transferred to municipal districts of the county councils, comprising the county councillors from the LEA coterminous with the district.

Some members of Údarás na Gaeltachta were directly elected by Gaeltacht residents between 1980 and 2012; since then all have been appointed by the government.

==Presidential elections==
The President of Ireland is formally elected by the citizens of Ireland once in every seven years, except in the event of premature vacancy, when an election must be held within sixty days. The President is directly elected by secret ballot under the system of the instant-runoff voting (although the Constitution describes it as &quot;the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote&quot;). While both Irish and British citizens resident in the state may vote in Dáil elections, only Irish citizens, who must be at least eighteen years of age, may vote in the election of the President. The presidency is open to all citizens of the state who are at least 35. A candidate must be nominated by one of the following:

*Twenty members of the Oireachtas (Dáil or Seanad).
*Four local authorities.
*Themselves (in the case of an incumbent or former president who has served only one term).

Where only one candidate is nominated, that candidate is declared elected without a ballot. No one may serve as President for more than two terms.

==Referendums==
The Constitution of Ireland was approved by plebiscite on 1 July 1937. The Constitution recognises two types of referendums:
*On a proposed amendment to the Constitution, for which a referendum is always required, and the amendment is passed by a majority of those voting;
*An ordinary referendum, on a bill other than an amendment to the Constitution, for which a referendum is only required on petition of Oireachtas members, and the bill is passed by a majority of those to vote.

There have been 38 referendums for amendments to the Constitution of Ireland. There have been no ordinary referendums. Since 2023, the Electoral Commission provides neutral information to the public on each amendment. An organisation can register with the commission as an &quot;approved body&quot; in order to campaign publicly for or against the proposal, and to have monitors in polling stations and counting agents at count centres. From 1998 to 2019, this function was carried out by a Referendum Commission established for each referendum.

For a proposal to change the name of a place, a plebiscite is required. The current 1956 Regulations on conducting such plebiscites relate to a postal vote of ratepayers; in 2019 the relevant electorate was changed from ratepayers to local electors, but the regulations have not been updated accordingly. In a County Cork town, &quot;Charleville&quot; was chosen in a 1989 four-option plebiscite ahead of , , and &quot;Rathgoggan&quot;. The Official Languages Act 2003 prevented the plebiscite provision applying to places in the Gaeltacht, and so a 2005 plebiscite to change the name of Dingle, County Kerry was ruled invalid; in 2011, the 2003 Act was amended to remove the restriction.

Other local plebiscites include three in 2019 on whether to establish directly-elected mayors for Cork City Council, Limerick City and County Council and Waterford City and County Council, of which only that for Limerick was passed.

<text>Paul Émile Chabas (March 7, 1869 – May 10, 1937) was a French painter and illustrator and member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts.
==Biography==
Chabas was born in Nantes, and had his artistic training under William-Adolphe Bouguereau and Tony Robert-Fleury. He first exhibited at the Salon in 1890. Chabas won the Prix National at the 1899 Paris Salon with his &quot;Joyeux Ébats&quot;. He was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1900 and in 1912 received the Médaille d’honneur. His preferred subject was a nude young woman in a natural setting. He was considered to be one of Europe&#x27;s greatest painters of nudes.

His most famous painting, &quot;Matinée de Septembre&quot; (&quot;September Morn&quot;) (1912), became a &quot;succès de scandale&quot; in the United States in May, 1913, when Anthony Comstock, secretary of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, protested against the painting as supposedly immoral. Chabas was offended by the controversy over the painting. For a time he sought anonymity in the South of France. There was much publicity, and reproductions of the painting sold well for years afterwards. &quot;September Morn&quot; has often been cited as an example of kitsch. Chabas refused to identify the model who was the subject of the painting, referring to her only as &quot;Marthe&quot;. However, the controversy regarding the painting&#x27;s model refused to disappear. As late as 1935, a rumor circulated that the young woman was living in poverty and Chabas was receiving letters from people in the US who wanted to come to her aid. He also recalled how offended he was when the painting was considered indecent by some in the US more than twenty years before.

Chabas first visited the United States in 1914 for a season of painting there. Before the journey he commented on rumors that he disliked the US, as he refused to sell &quot;September Morn&quot; to a US newspaper publisher after the controversy about the painting began. Chabas said he did not originally intend to sell the painting, because it was his wife&#x27;s favorite. When he entered the painting in the Paris Salon of 1912, he set a price of $10,000, which he believed no one would pay. Leon Mantashev, son of oil magnate Alexander Mantashev, was willing to meet this price, and the painting was sold to him. Later in his life, Chabas said that he loved the painting, which some called his masterpiece. While Chabas said he supposed it was, he was certain that &quot;in it is all that I know of painting&quot;. He stated that he had made no money from the many reproductions of the painting, although many others did. Chabas remarked that those who had profited from his work were not &quot;thoughtful enough to send me even a box of cigars.&quot;

In the 1890s, Chabas illustrated books by such authors as Paul Bourget and Alfred de Musset. He also did some illustrating work for the French publisher Alphonse Lemerre. He became a member of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1921 and received the Légion d’honneur in 1928. From 1925 to 1935 he was president of the Société des Artistes Français. He died in Paris on May 10, 1937 after a long illness. Chabas, now a widower, died in a room where there was only one painting—a copy of &quot;September Morn&quot; which he had painted from memory.

During his lifetime, Paul Chabas was also a celebrated portrait painter.

<text>A record changer or autochanger is a device that plays several phonograph records in sequence without user intervention. Record changers first appeared in the late 1920s, and were common until the 1980s.

==History==

The record changer with a stepped center spindle design was invented by Eric Waterworth of Hobart, Australia, in 1925. He and his father took it to Sydney, and arranged with a company called Home Recreations to fit it into its forthcoming phonograph, the Salonola. Although this novelty was demonstrated at the 1927 Sydney Royal Easter Show, Home Recreations went into liquidation and the Salonola was never marketed. In 1928, the Waterworths traveled to London, where they sold their patent to the new Symphony Gramophone and Radio Co. Ltd.

Eric Waterworth built three prototypes of his invention, one of which was sold to Home Recreations as a model for its proposed Salonola record player as cited above, which is now reportedly in the collection of the Museum of Applied Arts &amp; Sciences in Sydney. The second prototype went to England with Eric and his father, and was sold as part of the deal with the Symphony Gramophone and Radio Company. The fate of this machine is unknown. The third prototype was never fully assembled, and lay in pieces under the Waterworths&#x27; house for something like sixty years. After Eric&#x27;s death, the family found the disassembled parts of the machine and offered them to the Sound Preservation Association of Tasmania. The offer was accepted, and an enthusiastic member began the task of reassembling the prototype. Only a few small parts were found to be missing, and enough remained to finish assembling it and restoring it to a crude working condition. This prototype record changer is now on display at the Sound Preservation Association of Tasmania resource centre in the Hobart suburb of Bellerive.

The first commercially successful record changer was the &quot;Automatic Orthophonic&quot; model by the Victor Talking Machine Company, which was launched in the United States in 1927. On a conventional gramophone or phonograph, the limited playing time of 78 rpm gramophone records (averaging a little over four minutes per 12-inch side, and a little over three per 10-inch side) meant that listeners had to get up to change records at regular intervals. The Automatic Orthophonic allowed the listener to load a stack of several records into the machine, which would then be automatically played in sequence for a much longer uninterrupted listening time.

By the late 1950s, Garrard (of Britain) and Dual (Germany) dominated the high-end record changer market in the United States. From the late 1950s through the late 1960s, VM Corporation (Voice of Music) of Benton Harbor, Michigan, US, dominated the lower-priced original equipment manufacturer (OEM) American record changer market. Most VM record changers were sold to OEM audio manufacturers such as Zenith and installed in console-sized, portable or compact low- to mid-priced stereo or mono systems. VM record changers sold to OEMs were not labeled with the Voice of Music trademark on the unit itself; only those retailed by VM Corporation, either as separate components or integral parts of VM phonographs, were labeled with the VM (Voice of Music) trademark on the changer. Outside the US, VM record-changer technology was licensed to several manufacturers. Telefunken, of then West Germany, was one such company to sign a licensing agreement with VM Corporation. By the mid to late 1960s, a British company BSR–MacDonald displaced VM as the world largest record-changer manufacturer and dominated the OEM changer market in the US as well.

Garrard, in 1960, introduced a high fidelity record changer with a professional grade balanced tonearm and heavy cast non-magnetic platter, both features previously found only on manual turntables. To distinguish it by its superior performance, it was called an &quot;automatic turntable.&quot; The name, and the improved performance, caught on and other manufacturers began producing automatic turntables with professional-grade features and performance.

Most mid-priced consumer record players of the 1950s through the 1970s were equipped with changers, but they started to decline in popularity as cassettes and compact discs replaced vinyl records in the 1980s and 1990s. Record-stacking changers eventually became rarer due to the gradually growing belief that they contributed greatly to record wear and &quot;warping,&quot; and were eventually superseded by manual turntables which served as separate parts of component systems or were integrated into compact systems that played one record at a time and were felt by some to save record wear by gentler treatment during play.

==Operation==
Record-changer mechanisms were sometimes complicated. They typically held a stack of records on an extended central spindle supported by an arm (separate from the tonearm housing the cartridge and stylus which played the records). Some units had feelers that could detect the size of each record (the three standard sizes being 7, 10 or 12 inches) and accordingly position the tone arm at the start of the disc (its outer edge). Some used a variable-size sensor which allowed sizes other than the standard three to be played. The simpler models required the record diameter to be set manually, and hence did not allow records of different sizes to be stacked together. The following automatic size detecting devices were the most popular (with examples):

Three-size sensors:

* Size-selector knobno size intermix (BSR, 1968 to 1980s).
* Size- and speed-selector knobno size intermix, so that some types couldn&#x27;t be played automatically (Garrard after 1969).
* Rising feelers in or alongside turntableno size intermix, but automatic sensing of size (PE after 1970)
* Falling record sensorrandom intermixsizes mixed in any order (BSR before 1968. Garrard Auto-Slim variants. Some RCA. Silvertone.).
* Rising and falling record sensorsintermix 10- and 12-inch records vs. separate playing of 7-inch (VM 1950 to 1970. Admiral Ensign series.).
* Unplayed stack sensorarranged intermix, large records before small (Webster Chicago 1950 to 1953)
* Unplayed stack arm tip sensorarranged intermix (Collaro/Magnavox after 1967)

Variable-size sensors:

* Pickup arm scan of unplayed stackarranged intermix, odd sizes (Collaro/Magnavox 1954 to 1967)
* Pickup arm scan of lowered recordrandom intermix, odd sizes (PE 1957 to 1969)
* Arm tip feeler wheels (feel only top record on turntable)random intermix, odd sizes (Dual 1003, 1004, 1005, 1006)
* Arm top feeler wheels (feel only bottom record on stack)random intermix, odd sizes (Miracord 9 and 90)
* Pickup arm scan of separated recordrandom intermix, odd sizes (Thorens TD-224)

Audiophiles eventually disdained record changers because of the perceived compromise in fidelity resulting from changes in tone arm angle with the height of the stack, and concerns about changers&#x27; seemingly rough treatment of discs, particularly due to slight but cumulative damage to the spindle holes as the records were dropped from a height of a few inches onto the record or stack below or the turntable platter; as well as some sliding and rubbing of the discs together, scratching the record labels in the process, because the dropped disc didn&#x27;t immediately accelerate to the rotational speed of the spindle or discs below it. Most of these fears were unfounded in changers made after 1953. More advanced changers, such as the TD-224 model from Thorens and the ADC Accutrac+6, partially addressed these problems.

==Automatic sequencing==
Numbering of the sides of the discs in many double and triple albums, and boxed sets of records (both 78s and LPs) in a certain sequence enabled them to be stacked and played on record changers. After the discs were stacked and one side of each disc had played, the entire stack would be turned over and replaced on the changer shelf. Thus, to be heard in the proper sequence, each disc of a four-disc set would contain, respectively, &quot;sides&quot; 1&amp;8, 2&amp;7, 3&amp;6 and 4&amp;5a practice known as &quot;automatic sequencing&quot;, &quot;changer sequencing&quot; or &quot;auto-coupling&quot;. In pre-LP days, classical symphonies and concertos, and later, original cast albums, would be recorded using this format.

This &quot;drop-automatic sequence&quot; was designed for record changers which simply dropped records rather than reversing the stack as it was played in sequence. Other record changers, including some made as far back as the 1930s by RCA and GE in addition to the much later Thorens TD-224, were capable of reversing the stack automatically. The RCA and GE units kept the records stacked on the turntable and slid the top record to the side after playing it. A separate sequence, the &quot;slide-automatic sequence,&quot; was made for these changers, with sides coupled 1&amp;5, 2&amp;6, 3&amp;7 and 4&amp;8.

Some record changers could play both sides of each record. Manual sequence (sides coupled 1&amp;2, 3&amp;4, 5&amp;6 and 7&amp;8) worked with these. Examples were the Markel 75, Capehart turnover, Fisher/Lincoln, Garrard RC-100, and Thorens Symphony CD50/CD53 changers.

During the late 1930s and early 1940s, Victor released 78 rpm record sets in all three sequences (with set numbers preceded by M for manual, DM for drop-automatic or AM for slide-automatic sequencing), for players of each of the three kinds it manufactured. Columbia used MM for drop-automatic sets of three or more records, X for manual and MX for two-record drop-automatic sets.

Some radio station copies were produced in &quot;relay sequence&quot; to be played by a DJ on two turntables with no break between sides, which were coupled as 1&amp;3, 2&amp;4, 5&amp;7 and 6&amp;8. The slide-automatic sequence also allowed uninterrupted play with two turntables.

<text>Grassington is a town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. The population of the parish at the 2011 Census was 1,126. Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and now in the lieutenancy area of North Yorkshire, the village is situated in Wharfedale, about north-west from Bolton Abbey, and is surrounded by limestone scenery. Nearby villages include Linton, Threshfield, Hebden, Conistone and Kilnsey.

==History==

The Domesday Book lists Grassington as part of Gamal Barn&#x27;s estate, including 7 carucates of ploughland (840 acres/350ha) including Grassington, Linton and Threshfield. The Norman conquest of England made it part of the lands of Gilbert Tison. But, by 1118, Tison had suffered a demotion and his lands returned to the king before being given to Lord Percy.

Originally spelled &quot;Gherinstone&quot; and later documented as &quot;Garsington&quot; or &quot;Gersington&quot;, Grassington&#x27;s name derives variously from Scandinavian, Anglo-Saxon and Gothic origins, meaning &#x27;town of the grassy ings&#x27; or &#x27;farmstead surrounded by grass&#x27;.

Historically part of the parish of Linton in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Grassington became a separate civil parish in 1866, and was transferred to North Yorkshire in 1974.

Though referred to as a village, Grassington was granted a Royal Charter for a market and fair in 1282 giving it market town status. The market was held regularly until about 1860. Grassington Hall is reputedly the oldest house in Yorkshire, dating from the late 13th or early 14th century. A change in land use from the early 17th century, when lead mining began to assume more importance and brought some prosperity, but Grassington&#x27;s heyday arrived during the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Grassington Town Hall was completed in 1855. The opening of the Yorkshire Dales Railway to Threshfield in 1902 brought new visitors, many of whom settled, some finding work in Skipton or in the developing limestone quarries. 

Grassington &amp; Threshfield Golf Club (now defunct) was founded in 1908. The club continued until the Second World War.

Grassington was used as the setting for the fictional town of Darrowby in the 2020 Channel 5 series &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot;, instead of Thirsk where the actual story took place; Thirsk had simply become too large for the small-town feel that the series wanted. 

Grassington worked well for filming. &quot;The nice thing was that there weren’t any modern houses in the town center ... so we didn’t have to change anything completely. What we did change were all the shop signs and the usual things like aerials, satellite dishes, alarm boxes and all of those things&quot;.

A memorial of the trade unionist Tom Mann stands in front of the cottage where he died in Grassington.

==Culture and community==

Grassington is the main residential and tourist centre in Upper Wharfedale. Centred on its small cobbled square are shops, public houses, the village museum, small cafes, restaurants and hotels. Grassington Folk Museum houses a collection which tells the story of Wharfedale. It is an independent museum run and managed by volunteers.

The area is popular with walkers; one of the most popular routes is a circular walk that includes Burnsall. Upper Wharfedale Fell Rescue Association, based in Grassington, is a voluntary mountain rescue organisation which rescues people in trouble on the surrounding fells and in caves.

Grassington Festival is a two-week-long annual event started in 1980, with music, performance and visual arts, held in a number of venues around the village.
Every September since 2011, Grassington has held a 1940s themed weekend. Events include war re-enactments, dances and a variety of military and civilian vehicles on display from the period.
In the winter Grassington holds the Dickensian Festival, with period costumes, Christmas activities and commercial selling.

A Yorkshire Dales National Park information centre is on Hebden Road.

Three miles north of Grassington, at Kilnsey, is the glacially carved overhang of Kilnsey Crag.

Grass Wood, an area of ancient woodland including the Iron-Age fort, Fort Gregory (also known as Gregory&#x27;s Fort), is situated just over north-west of Grassington.
The town was transformed into the fictional Darrowby for the filming of the 2020 television series of &quot;All Creatures Great and Small&quot; for Channel 5.

==Transport==

===Roads===
Grassington is served by the B6265, which runs between Skipton and Green Hammerton via Pateley Bridge and Boroughbridge (being a more circuitous route that the A59 road which connects Skipton and Green Hammerton). Buses connect Grassington with Ilkley and Skipton operating a moderate service to Skipton, but only a three-day a week service to Ilkley.

===Buses===

The DalesBus serves the community on certain days in summer; a report in August 2020 provided these specifics:&quot;Grassington is served by daily bus service 72 from Skipton, with minibus 72B continuing further up Wharfedale to Kilnsey, Kettlewell and Buckden on Monday to Saturday. There are buses some days to Burnsall, Bolton Abbey and Ilkley. On Sundays, additional DalesBus services operate – including double-decker DalesBus 875 from Wakefield, Leeds and Ilkley to Grassington, Kettlewell and Buckden, continuing during the summer months to Aysgarth and Hawes in Wensleydale.
===Railway===
The village used to have a railway station terminus, which was shared with Threshfield, on the Yorkshire Dales Railway. The station was located on the west side of the River Wharfe, so it was not actually in Grassington. The line opened in July 1902 but closed down in September 1930 after only 28 years of service. The station remained open to freight and railtour traffic until 1969 when the tracks were removed to a point to the south, at the limestone quarry at Swinden. Some of the quarry limestone continues to be transported by rail. The site of Grassington station is now a housing estate, but the Campaign for Better Transport have listed the Skipton to Grassington line as one which they wish to see re-opened to passenger traffic.

==Education==
Grassington has a Church of England primary school located in the village and there is another primary school in nearby Threshfield. Secondary education is either at the Upper Wharfedale School, which is a non-selective specialist sports college, or in Skipton at Ermysted&#x27;s Grammar School (boys only) and Skipton Girls High School, both of which are selective.

==Electricity generation==

In 1909 Grassington received its first electricity from a hydroelectric plant at Linton Falls, which continued to operate until 1948 when the National Grid arrived in the area. In March 2012 a new hydroelectric power plant was opened using the same but restored turbine house, which provides 500,000 kWh of electricity a year, using two Archimedean screws.

<text>John Penny (died 1520) was an English priest, successively Bishop of Bangor, 1504–1508, and Bishop of Carlisle, 1508–1520. He was also Prior to Bradley Priory 1503–1508.

==Career==

His education is uncertain, though he may have been educated at Lincoln College, Oxford, and later received his LLD from the University of Cambridge. He is first recorded as a canon of Leicester Abbey in 1477. From 1496–1509 he was Abbot of Leicester and in around 1500 built the boundary wall, Abbot Penny&#x27;s Wall, which is now named after him.

In 1520, Penny died at Leicester Abbey, where he had earlier been the abbot, and was buried at St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Leicester. The church contains his alabaster effigy, although the rest of the tomb was replaced in 1846.

<doc id="925753" wikidata="Q2131866" url="?curid=925753" title="Alwoodley">
<text>Alwoodley is a suburb and civil parish of Leeds in West Yorkshire, England. It is north of central Leeds and is one of the most affluent areas of the county. Alwoodley lies in the LS17 postcode area which was reported to contain the most expensive housing area in Yorkshire and the Humber by &quot;The Times&quot;.

The area is situated in the Alwoodley ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==

The area comprises a large part of the postcode LS17, which contains most of north Leeds and the surrounding countryside. On either side of Alwoodley is Adel, to the west, and Shadwell, to the east. Most of the housing is between Nursery Lane and Alwoodley Lane. To the south are Moor Allerton and Moortown. The area to the north is mainly countryside, including the Eccup Reservoir, two golf courses, and the Harewood Estate. 

The Harewood Estate comprises approximately 4,000 acres of land in total including Harewood House, an 18th Century country house designed by architects John Carr and Robert Adam, built for Edwin Lascelles, 1st Baron Harewood. The landscape was designed by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown and spans 1,000 acres (400 ha). The house is the family seat of the Lascelles family, and home of David Lascelles, the Eighth Earl of Harewood.

==History==

The name &quot;Alwoodley&quot; is thought to derive from Old English &quot;Æthelwald-lēah&quot;, meaning &#x27;the woodland clearing (&quot;lēah&quot;), at Æthelwald&#x27;s farm&#x27;. It appears as &quot;Aluuoldelei&quot; in the 1086 Domesday Book.

The route of the Roman road between Ilkley and Tadcaster, road 72b in Margary&#x27;s numbering, passes through Alwoodley. Part of it was excavated along Lakeland Crescent in 1994.

Alwoodley became part of the County Borough of Leeds on 1 April 1928 as a consequence of the passage of the Leeds Corporation Act 1927.

===Civil Parish===
The civil parish boundaries are from Nursery Lane on the south, following the Meanwood Valley Trail on the west, the A61 Harrogate Road on the east. The northern boundaries are in countryside between Harewood to the northeast and Arthington to the northwest. Note that Alwoodley Gates is an area to the east of the A61 inside the Harewood civil parish.

===Electoral Ward===

The Electoral Ward includes the above area, but also Alwoodley Gates to the east and southwards part of Moortown as far as the Leeds Outer Ring Road. This article will include this larger area, which includes certain institutions associated with the area but just outside the civil parish boundary.

As of 2023 the councillors for this ward (all Conservatives) are Neil Buckley, Dan Cohen and Lyn Buckley.

===Church of England Parish===

The Church of England parish of Alwoodley is based upon the church of St Barnabas, in the Diocese of Leeds. The parish boundaries extend from King Lane in the West to the A58 Wetherby Road to the East, thus including Shadwell. They also include part of Moortown south of the Ring Road around Moortown Corner.

==Housing==
The former mansion, Alwoodley Old Hall, was close to the south side of Eccup Reservoir: it was demolished in 1969, and the grounds were used for Sandmoor Golf Club, north of Alwoodley Lane.
The centre is a large open area, including Moortown Golf Club and Rugby Club and former farmland known as Alwoodley Moss. Around it are 4 regions of housing, nearly all low-rise, semi-detached or detached. In the northwest corner (junction bounded by King Lane to the west and Alwoodley Lane to the North) is housing called Alwoodley Park and includes street names such as &quot;The Avenue&quot;, &quot;The Lane&quot;, &quot;The Drive&quot; etc. reflecting the former more isolated nature of the original village. In the northeast corner (junction bounded by Alwoodley Lane on the north and Harrogate Road on the east) is the Sandmoor Estate. In the southeast corner (bounded by Nursery Lane on the south and Harrogate Road on the east) is the Primley Park area. Where Sandmoor and Primley Park join is Sandmoor Court, a block of flats. The southwest corner (bounded by Nursery Lane to the south and King Lane to the west) consists of housing on streets such as the Sunningdales, the Birkdales and the Turnberrys.

The residential areas on and around the Sandmoors, Alwoodley Lane and Wigton Lane are amongst the most exclusive in Leeds, with many large detached family homes, imposing mansions and exclusive flat developments. Some of the most valuable residential properties in Yorkshire are in Alwoodley.

==Education==
The two largest schools in the area are Allerton High School and The Grammar School at Leeds Junior &amp; Senior site. Alwoodley is served by two Jewish Faith Schools, both on the Henry Cohen Campus, Brodetsky Primary School, and a high school, Leeds Jewish Free School, which was founded in 2013 by local city councillor, Dan Cohen.

==Sport==
There are three golf clubs within the area, namely Alwoodley, Moortown and Sand Moor. Moortown hosted the 1929 Ryder Cup. Alwoodley Cricket Club dates back to 1935. There are two Rugby Union clubs in the area: Leodiensian RUFC and Moortown Rugby Club.

Alwoodley is also home to Alwoodley FC, a football team that compete in the top tier of the Yorkshire Amateur League.

<text>Bramley is a district in west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is part of the City of Leeds electoral ward of Bramley and Stanningley, which had a population of 21,334 at the 2011 census. The area is an old industrial area with much 19th century architecture and 20th century council housing in the east and private suburban housing in the west.

==Etymology==
Bramley is recorded in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Brameleia&quot; and &quot;Bramelei&quot;. The name derives from the Old English words &quot;brōm&quot; (&#x27;broom&#x27;) and &quot;lēah&quot; (&#x27;open land in a wood&#x27;). The name once meant &#x27;open land characterised by broom&#x27;.

==History==

At the time of the Domesday survey, the nucleus of the settlement was probably located at Stocks Hill, and it developed in a linear fashion along today&#x27;s Town Street. The surviving water pump and stone water trough on Stocks Hill remain from Bramley&#x27;s medieval past. A blue plaque states &quot;Stocks Hill, Bramley. This historic pump and trough are the last reminders of Bramley Village Green which was surrounded by medieval cottages and yards. The Green featured the stocks, pillory and an eight feet high pillar which commemorated the holding of Leeds Market here during the plague of 1644–45.&quot;

Bramley experienced an industrial boom and associated population increase in the 19th century, mostly because of the development of the woollen textile industry in the early part of the century, quarrying and because of the boot making and engineering industries in its later part. The antiquarian Benjamin Wilson wrote a history of Bramley, published in 1860. He donated his collection to Leeds City Museum, including a witch&#x27;s bottle found in White Coat (White Cote), Bramley in 1861.

In 1873, bishop John Gott and H. M. Gott erected a stone cross with Anglo Saxon-style carving to celebrate eight years of living and working in Bramley; it now stands in a walled garden, although in the 1980s it stood at the park entrance. Nearby, on Town Street, is the old house that dates back to 1480.

In the early 1960s, a geological survey on behalf of Leeds Corporation of land to be developed at Gamble Hill towards Farnley, discovered past workings for Elland Flags not shown on historic maps. Subsequent investigations found the area riddled with late-eighteenth century shafts and cavities. Plans for the layout of the proposed housing estate, in particular the siting of high rise blocks, had to be altered.

Mary Gawthorpe described her experience living and working at Hough Lane School in Bramley between 1905 and 1907 in her autobiography. She recalls: &quot;Bramley was an oasis of peace, and old established centre of homes and living yet within the city bounds... from our kitchen at Warrel&#x27;s Mount we looked out on open fields. The walk to school was almost rural in its calm.&quot;

Much of Bramley was redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s in an unsympathetic manner that damaged the historic integrity of the area and altered the appearance and the character of the town significantly. Bramley Shopping Centre was Leeds&#x27; second purpose-built town centre after Seacroft town centre. Unlike Seacroft, Bramley Shopping Centre replaced an existing town centre, including many shops and cottages that were dilapidated and in need of repair. From 2008, following a time of deterioration of the shopping centre, new anchor stores such as Farmfoods and Tesco took over existing premises or occupied new ones in the course of a general refit.

The redevelopment of Bramley was condemned by English Heritage as one of the least sensitive redevelopment programmes in Yorkshire. In 2008 the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot; ran an article describing the redevelopment of a &quot;once-picturesque area&quot;, and questioning the replacement of an historic Yorkshire town centre. Much of historical Bramley is now protected within the Bramley Town Conservation Area, which focuses on the area around Bramley Park across to Hough Lane.

==Governance==
Bramley was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Leeds. In 1866 Bramley became a separate civil parish, which was then abolished on 26 March 1904 to form Armley and Bramley. In 1901 the parish had a population of 17,299.

Bramley is in the Parliamentary constituency of Leeds West and Pudsey. The Member of Parliament is Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves.

==Community== 

Parks and open areas for outdoor recreation include Bramley Falls Wood, which runs beside the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and Bramley Park, which contains an underground reservoir at its highest point. At Bramley Park a fireworks display and the Bramley Carnival were held most years. The carnival stopped in 2014, and the last fireworks were in 2019.
Bramley Baths is an example of an Edwardian swimming baths. Built in 1904, and restored, it has a 25-yard pool, a gym and a Russian steam room. The baths were used for dances during its early years, when the pool was covered with a large dance floor. The baths are the only remaining example of an Edwardian era bathhouse in Leeds and have Grade II listed status. The baths were built on the site of an iron foundry and the original foundry chimney, built with more than 8,000 Kirkstall bricks, still towers over the baths and can be seen across Leeds. The four Georgian-style houses built to the right of the baths were the original homes of the iron foundry owner and his three children.

Bramley Shopping Centre is a 1960s-style concrete shopping plaza which was erected to replace the traditional stone-built village centre. Shops include charity shops, banks, bakeries, pawnbrokers, supermarkets, a post office, a dental practice, beauty salons and fast food takeaways.
Estates in Bramley which have residents&#x27; associations include Moorside and Ganners, Landseer, Rossefield, and Newlay and Whitecote. LILAC, an affordable green co-housing project, is based in Bramley.
Bramley places of worship include Baptist, Roman Catholics, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, and Methodist (Trinity Methodist Church), and two Anglican churches, St Peter&#x27;s (pictured) and St Margaret&#x27;s. St Margaret&#x27;s Church Hall is registered with Leeds City Council as an asset of community value.

==Public transport==
Bramley railway station off Stanningley Road is on the Leeds-Bradford Line between Leeds railway station and New Pudsey. Bramley bus station is in the shopping centre.

==Sport==
Bramley RLFC were founded in 1879, their earliest permanent ground was Barley Mow which hosted New Zealand on their tour of Great Britain in 1907. Bramley joined the Northern Union in 1896. The club moved to McLaren Field in 1965 where they stayed until 1995 after being forced to leave due to financial difficulties. They played at Clarence Field and Headingley Rugby Stadium before folding in 1999.

A new club, Bramley Buffaloes, was set up in 2000. Their bids to rejoin the RFLs professional ranks were denied but they were eventually entered into National League Three in 2004. In 2012 the club applied to join the newly-formed National Conference League but had their application rejected and instead entered the Yorkshire Men&#x27;s League.

Bramley Phoenix RUFC was formed in 1921 and play home games at Warrels Mount ground. They currently play in Yorkshire Counties leagues.

Bramley Juniors Football Club was established 1994 and runs with open-age teams. The club developed from one under-9s club in 1994.

<text>The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a union between Serbia and Montenegro which had existed between 1992 and 2003. It was reconstituted as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003. In 2006, the state broke up into the two independent states of Serbia and Montenegro.

==Federal Republic of Yugoslavia==

Elections on a federal level were regularly held to elect the President of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia as well as the Federal Assembly of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

==State Union of Serbia and Montenegro==

The Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro (&quot;Skupština Srbije i Crne Gore&quot;) had 126 members who served four-year terms, 91 from Serbia and 35 from Montenegro.

The first parliament was chosen in February 1993 by the members of the parliament of the former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and the members of the parliaments of Serbia and of Montenegro. The seats were divided up among political parties in proportion to the number of their seats in these two parliaments, so that each time one of the parliaments was re-elected, the composition of the federal parliament changed. The president of Serbia and Montenegro was elected by the parliament.

It was intended that direct elections for the Assembly of Serbia and Montenegro would be held in 2007, but the break-up of the state ended this possibility.

<text>Ung County (in Latin: &quot;comitatus Unghvariensis&quot;; Hungarian: &quot;Ung (vár)megye&quot;; also in Slovak: &quot;Užský komitát/ Užská župa / Užská stolica&quot;; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now mostly in western Ukraine, a smaller part in eastern Slovakia, and a very small area in Hungary.

==Geography==

Ung county shared borders with the Cisleithanian crownland Galicia (now in Poland and Ukraine) and the Hungarian counties Bereg, Szabolcs and Zemplén. It was situated between the Carpathian Mountains in the north, the rivers Tisza and Latorca (present-day Latorica) in the south, and the river Laborc (present-day Laborec) in the west. The rivers Latorca and Ung (present-day Uzh) flowed through the county. Its area was around 1910.

==Capitals==
Initially, the capital of the county was the Uzhhorod Castle (Hungarian: Ungvári vár), later the town of Ungvár (present-day Uzhhorod).

==History==
Ung is one of the oldest counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the aftermath of World War I, most of Ung county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in the 1920 Treaty of Trianon. The town of Záhony and the village of Győröcske remained in Hungary, which was merged into Szabolcs-Ung County in 1923. 

Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, all but the westernmost part of the county became part of Hungary again in November 1938, and the county was recreated. In 1939, following the annexation of the remainder of Carpathian Ruthenia after Czechoslovakia became abolished, the rest of the territories became part of Hungary again, however those were assigned to the administrative branch offices of Ung.

After World War II, as the 1920 borders were restored, the westernmost part was returned to Czechoslovakia. The rest (except Záhony and Győröcske) became part of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian SSR, Zakarpattia Oblast, while a small part remained in Hungary.

==Demographics==



Nowadays, some Romanians living in the area of Poroshkovo also inhabit the area of Ung. They are known as in Romanian.

==Subdivisions==

In the early 20th century, the subdivisions of Ung county were: 

The towns of Veľké Kapušany and Sobrance are now in Slovakia; the other towns mentioned are in Ukraine.

<doc id="925767" wikidata="Q2540467" url="?curid=925767" title="Elections in Spain">
<text>Elections in Spain encompass four different types: general elections, regional elections, local elections, and elections to the European Parliament. General elections and regional elections are typically conducted at the conclusion of the national or regional legislative mandate, which usually spans four years since the previous election. However, early elections can be called in certain circumstances. On the other hand, local council elections (including municipal and insular elections) and elections to the European Parliament follow fixed dates, although some local government bodies, such as provincial councils, are not directly elected. In most elections, a party-list proportional representation (PR) system is employed, while the Senate utilizes the plurality system.

==General elections==

General elections are elections held for the national legislature, which is called in Spain Cortes Generales (Spanish for &quot;General Courts&quot;) and consists of two chambers, the Congress of Deputies and the Senate. The Congress and Senate usually serve concurrent terms that run for a maximum of four years. However, the Prime Minister has the prerogative to dissolve both Houses at any given time either jointly or separately.

===Congress of Deputies===
The Congress is made out of 350 members directly elected by universal adult suffrage for a four-year term of office. Each one of Spain&#x27;s fifty provinces is a constituency entitled to an initial minimum of two seats; the cities of Ceuta and Melilla elect one member each. The remaining 248 seats are allocated among the fifty provinces in proportion to their populations. Parties, federations, coalitions and &quot;agrupaciones de electores&quot; (electors&#x27; groups) may present candidates or lists of candidates. The lists are closed, so electors may not choose individual candidates in, or alter the order of, such lists. Electors cast a ballot for a single list, or for a single candidate in Ceuta and Melilla.

The seats in each constituency are apportioned according to the largest average method of proportional representation (PR), conceived by the Belgian mathematician Victor d&#x27;Hondt in 1899 (d&#x27;Hondt method). However, in order to participate in the allocation of seats, a list must receive at least three percent of all valid votes cast in the constituency, including blank ballots. The single-member seats in Ceuta and Melilla are filled by the plurality or first-past-the-post method, under which the candidate obtaining the largest number of votes in the constituency is elected.

;Seat allocation in Congress

To illustrate the functioning of the system, the allocation of seats in the three provinces of the Self-Governing or Autonomous Community of Aragón - Huesca, Teruel and Zaragoza - for the June 1993 general election is presented here in detail. At the time, Zaragoza province had seven seats in Congress, while both Huesca and Teruel had three.

In Zaragoza province, only four tickets, namely the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE), the Popular Party (PP), the Aragonese Party (PAR) and the United Left (IU) won at least three percent of the valid votes cast in the election - including blank ballots - and were thus entitled to participate in the allocation of constituency seats. The tickets were sorted by number of votes from top to bottom, and the votes polled by each of these were then divided by 1, 2, 3, and so on until the number of seats to be allocated was reached, as detailed below:
Seats were then awarded to the tickets obtaining the largest quotients or averages (shown in bold). As indicated, the PSOE won three seats, the PP two, the PAR one and IU one. The seats won by each ticket were awarded to the candidates included therein, according to their ranking on the lists: therefore, the first three candidates on the PSOE list were elected to Congress, as were the first two candidates on the PP list and the candidates at the top of the PAR and IU lists, respectively.

Meanwhile, the results of the election in Huesca province were as follows:
 
The effective representation threshold in Huesca was 25,360 votes, or 19.0% of the valid vote.

Finally, the outcome of the election in Teruel was the following:
The effective representation threshold in Teruel was 18,163 votes, or 20.2% of the valid vote.

Having concluded the allocation of Congress seats in the three Aragón constituencies, the following peculiarities stand out:

# The effective representation threshold in each province was substantially larger than the three percent barrier set forth by law: in all three constituencies, the seat apportionment would have been the same regardless of the statutory threshold.
# The number of votes required to attain a seat in Zaragoza province - the largest of three constituencies - was substantially higher than the amount required to that end in Huesca or in Teruel.
# The proportional allocation of seats in each constituency appeared to favor the major parties in general and specifically the majority party.

===Senate===
The system for electing the Senate was first used in 1979, though with regard to the provinces the system is unchanged since 1977. Senators are elected directly from the provinces and indirectly from the autonomous communities; currently, there are 264 senators, 208 directly elected and 56 indirectly elected.

In the provinces, a majoritarian partial block voting system is used. All peninsular provinces elect four senators each; the insular provinces (Balearic and Canary Islands) elect one or three senators per island, and Ceuta and Melilla elect two senators each. Parties nominate three candidates; each voter has three votes (fewer in those constituencies electing fewer senators) and votes for candidates by name, the only instance of personal voting in Spanish national elections. The usual outcome is three senators for the party with the most votes, and one senator for the runner-up, except in very close races.

The autonomous communities receive one senator, plus one for each million inhabitants. They are entitled to determine how they choose their senators but are generally elected by the legislature of the respective community in proportion to its party composition.

== Electoral procedures ==
The laws regulating the conduct and administration of elections are laid out in detail in the 1985 electoral law. (Ley Orgánica del Régimen Electoral General.) Under this law, the elections are supervised by the Electoral Commission (Junta Electoral), a permanent body composed of eight Supreme Court judges and five political scientists or sociologists appointed by the Congress of Deputies. The Electoral commission is supported in its work by the Interior Ministry. On election day, polling stations are run by electoral boards which consist of groups of citizens selected by lottery.

The format of the ballot paper is designed by the Spanish state, however, the law allows political parties to produce and distribute their own ballot papers, either by mailing them to voters or by other means such as street distribution, provided that they comply with the official model. The government then covers the cost of all printed ballot papers. These must then be marked by voters, either in the polling station or outside the polling station and placed inside sealed envelopes which are then placed inside ballot boxes in the polling station. Following the close of polls, the ballots are then counted in each individual polling station in the presence of representatives of the political parties and candidates. The ballots are then immediately destroyed, with the exception of those considered invalid or challenged by the candidates&#x27; representatives, which are retained for further scrutiny. The result is that full recounts are impossible.

<text>Roundhay is a large suburb in north-east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. Roundhay had a population of 22,546 in 2011.

It sits in the Roundhay ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency.

==History==
===Etymology===
Roundhay&#x27;s name derives from Old French &quot;rond&quot; &#x27;round&#x27; and the Old English word &quot;(ge)hæg&quot; &#x27;enclosure&#x27;, denoting a round hunting enclosure or deer park. The Roundhay estate map of 1803 showed its circular shape. 

===12th century===
Roundhay does not appear in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086, but seems to have been formed soon afterwards, the first mention being in about 1153. It was formerly a hunting park for the De Lacy family of Pontefract Castle. Coal and iron ore were mined and a smelting furnace was recorded in 1295. Once these were exhausted (and woodland had been cleared for fuel) the area turned to farming.

===16th century–18th century===
Roundhay was historically a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Barwick in Elmet, except for a small area in the east around Roundhay Grange (originally a grange of Kirkstall Abbey), which was a detached part of the township of Shadwell in the parish of Thorner. Roundhay was a hamlet until 1803 when the park estate was bought by Thomas Nicholson who started a programme of landscaping and built the Mansion House. Housing was built for workers and more land sold on which other gentry built houses.

===19th century – Turnpike ===
Until 1810, Gipton Wood was Gibton Forest separating Leeds from Roundhay Park and a turnpike road was constructed &quot;from Sheepscar to Roundhay Bridge&quot;. After the road was built the population increased from 84 in 1801 to 186 in 1822, mainly in grand houses for wealthier citizens of Leeds.
In 1826, St John&#x27;s Church was established to serve the population of Roundhay, Shadwell and Seacroft, a combined population of about 1100, who would otherwise have had to travel up to three miles to worship. This made the area more attractive, the population rose to 300 in the 1830s in the form of a &quot;township and genteel village&quot; with &quot;elegant villas, walks and plantations&quot;.

In 1866, Roundhay and Shadwell both became separate civil parishes.

===City of Leeds===
In 1872, Roundhay Park estate was purchased by the City of Leeds and opened as a public park by His Royal Highness Prince Arthur on 19 September 1872. At the time, there was much opposition as many considered the park was too far out of Leeds for the majority of the population to enjoy, and the park had just one access road and led to the park being dubbed a &#x27;white elephant&#x27; in its early years.
However, there was interest in developing housing, and a suburb began to develop around Lidgett Park. Development was accelerated in 1884 by the provision of a horse-drawn public omnibus service between Leeds and Roundhay Park, then a horse-drawn tram and, on 11 November 1891, the first public electric tram service, which by 1894 provided a quarter-hourly service from 6 a.m. The city sold surplus land, but placed restrictions in its use, stipulating stone for building and the prohibition of offensive trades.

The area acquired a Post Office in 1868 and by the start of the 20th century some parts were lit by electricity. Brick-built detached and semi-detached housing was created along new roads such as The Avenue.

===Pioneer movie footage===
On 14 October 1888, Louis le Prince recorded his short film &quot;Roundhay Garden Scene&quot;, in the garden of &quot;Oakwood Grange&quot;, the home of his parents-in-law, Joseph and Sarah Whitley, (the parents of John Robinson Whitley). This is believed to be the oldest surviving film in existence. (See External links)

===20th century===
In 1901, a second Anglican Church and in 1902 a Congregational Church were established to provide worship within walking distance for the new working class population. Lidgett Park Wesleyan Church followed in 1906.

===Lido===
In June 1907, an open-air swimming pool or &#x27;lido&#x27; opened, at a cost of just over £1,600, built mainly by unemployed citizens. During the 1950s and 1960s, about 100,000 people a year visited the Roundhay &#x27;swimming baths&#x27;. On 9 November 1912, the civil parishes of Roundhay and Shadwell were abolished, and Roundhay became part of Leeds. In 1911 the parish had a population of 2594.

===First World War===
During the First World War, Roundhay was used as a gathering place for soldiers, hence land by Prince&#x27;s Avenue is known as Soldiers Field. After the war, new estates were built to the south and west of the park. Roundhay School for Boys was opened in 1926, and the School for Girls in 1932. After the Second World War housing filled available spaces, with smaller residences built in the grounds of larger ones, and large converted to flats.

==Mansion House and large houses==

In 1811, John Clarke (died 1857) of York, architect of the Commercial Buildings in Leeds city centre, was commissioned by Thomas Nicholson to design the Mansion House. Formally known as Roundhay Park Mansion, the large mansion was built in ashlar stone in classical Georgian style; of two storeys with seven bays, the centre three set behind an iron portico. Thomas&#x27;s son, Stephen Nicholson Esq., inherited the house and became the Lord of the Manor of Roundhay. Roundhay township&#x27;s 1,467 acres were recorded in 1842 as being &quot;mostly the property of Stephen Nicholson&quot;.

The Mansion House was unused for many years after the departure of catering firm, Gilpin&#x27;s. Events and catering company &#x27;Dine&#x27; was appointed by Leeds City Council to run the Mansion, and in 2009, after refurbishment and gaining a civil ceremony licence, the Mansion re-opened to the public. The venue contains a restaurant and cafe, and hosts private functions.

From the early 1800s, a number of farming estates with large houses were built in Roundhay and some houses are now grade II listed; The Mansion at Roundhay Park (c. 1811), Elmete Hall (1865) and Beechwood (c. 1820). Scottish architect George Corson designed a large wing known today as Corson House at Roundhay&#x27;s Beechwood Estate and in 1873, he won a competition to design a number of substantial villas along Park Avenue, &quot;the jewel in Leed&#x27;s crown&quot;, and West Avenue on the fringe of Roundhay Park. The villas were built on plots of an acre or more with separate coach houses, stables and servants&#x27; quarters at the back so as not to be seen from the park. Woodlands Hall (known originally as Roundhay Mount and later as Carr Head), Parc Mont and several other mansions along Park Avenue are architecturally significant.

==Roundhay Park==
Roundhay Park (2.8 km2), is a Victorian park, the second largest city park in Europe after the Englischer Garten (3.7 km2), in Munich, Germany.

Roundhay Park comprises more than of parkland, lakes and woodland. The park has scented gardens for the blind, National Plant Collections, Canal Gardens, the Monet and Alhambra Gardens and Tropical World which attracts visitors all year round. In 2005 the Friends&#x27; Garden was opened, alongside Canal Gardens and the Rainbow Garden.

Woodpeckers, common warblers in spring and summer, mute swans, visiting whooper swans, great-crested grebes and herons can be found at the park. The Upper Lake is maintained as a wildlife area, and the larger Waterloo Lake is used for fishing. Roundhay Park provides the venue for special events including sporting events, flower and animal shows, music festivals and a bonfire and firework display on 5 November, (Guy Fawkes Night).

Facilities include tennis courts, skateboard ramps, sports pitches, bowling greens, a sports arena, a golf course and fishing. A cafe overlooking Waterloo Lake was damaged by fire in 2007 but restored and re-opened in 2008.

Roundhay Park was the first location an aircraft landed in Leeds, after a flight from Amsterdam in the Netherlands. The Park late had an aerodrome with one of the earliest air passenger services comprising regular flights every half hour to Bradford. Aircraft were manufactured at the nearby Olympia aircraft works opened by Robert Blackburn in 1914. The aerodrome operated until 1920. The factory continued until the 1960s, the previous factory site now being occupied by a large Tesco supermarket.

Tropical World is located to the west of the park and contains many rare birds and butterflies.

The park has hosted numerous outdoor concerts including Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, U2, Robbie Williams and Ed Sheeran.

==Sport and culture==
The Leeds Tykes rugby union club was founded after the merger of the Headingley and Roundhay clubs. Roundhegians RFC was the old boys&#x27; association of Roundhay School but now operates as a rugby club for the whole of Roundhay. The club plays at Chelwood Drive at the west end of Roundhay, near Moortown. Leeds Golf Club &quot;Cobble Hall&quot; as it is more affectionately known locally is situated on the edge of Roundhay park it has The Leeds Cup - The Oldest Trophy in Professional Golf Worldwide. The famous golf architect Doctor Alastair MacKenzie was a member of Leeds Golf Club between 1900 and 1910. There is also Roundhay Golf Club within Roundhay Park which is reputably designed by Dr MacKenzie and has a restaurant (&quot;Del Verde&quot;).

==Amenities==
The area is served by First West Yorkshire circular services 2 (via Chapel Allerton) and 12 (via Harehills) from Leeds city centre. These operate at a 10-minute frequency during the daytime on weekdays and Saturdays, and 30 minute frequency on evenings. Daytime frequency on Sundays is 20 minutes. The closest main line rail station is Leeds (approx 4.5 miles).

== Housing ==

Roundhay has a wide variety of housing. There is a mixture of Victorian through terraces, villas and 20th-century detached and semi detached housing. Because there has never been any mass house building in Roundhay at any one time, there is no consistent style throughout the area. There are many Victorian villas and flats adjacent to the park and along the northern edge of Roundhay.

==Religion==

According to the 2011 census 22,546 people were counted, of whom 46.64% gave their religion as Christian, 25.60% as No religion, 7.40% religion not stated, 12.58% Muslim, 1.89% Jewish, 3.40% Sikh, 1.78% Hindu, 0.34% Buddhist, 0.35% Others.

The first post-Reformation Catholic church in Leeds was the Roundhay Mission.

The Rev. Thomas Davis, a Church of England hymn-writer, was Vicar of Roundhay in the mid 19th century.

<text>Adapalene, sold under the brand name Differin among others, is a third-generation topical retinoid primarily used in the treatment of mild-moderate acne, and is also used off-label to treat keratosis pilaris as well as other skin conditions. Studies have found adapalene is as effective as other retinoids, while causing less irritation. It also has several advantages over other retinoids. The adapalene molecule is more stable compared to tretinoin and tazarotene, which leads to less concern for photodegradation. It is also chemically more stable compared to the other two retinoids, allowing it to be used in combination with benzoyl peroxide. Due to its effects on keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, adapalene is superior to tretinoin for the treatment of comedonal acne and is often used as a first-line agent. The Swiss company Galderma developed adapalene.

==Medical uses==
Per the recommendations of the Global Alliance on Improving Outcomes of Acne, retinoids such as adapalene are considered first-line therapy in acne treatment and are to be used either independently or in conjunction with benzoyl peroxide and/or an antimicrobial agent, like clindamycin, for maximum efficacy. An adapalene/benzoyl peroxide combination medication is also available. Furthermore, adapalene, like other retinoids, increases the efficacy and penetration of other topical acne medications that are used in conjunction with topical retinoids as well as hastens the improvement of the postinflammatory hyperpigmentation caused by acne. In the long term, it can be used as maintenance therapy.

===Off-label uses===
Adapalene has the unique ability to inhibit keratinocyte differentiation and decrease keratin deposition. This property makes adapalene an effective treatment for keratosis pilaris and callus. Other non-FDA approved indications that have been reported in the literature include treatment of warts, molluscum contagiosum, Darier&#x27;s disease, photoaging, pigmentary disorders, actinic keratoses and alopecia areata.

==Side effects==
Of the three topical retinoids, adapalene is often regarded as the best tolerated. It can cause mild adverse effects such as photosensitivity, irritation, redness, dryness, itching, and burning, and 1% to 10% of users experience a brief sensation of warmth or stinging, as well as dry skin, peeling and redness during the first two to four weeks using the medication. These effects are considered mild and usually decrease over time. Serious allergic reactions are rare.

===Pregnancy &amp; lactation===
Use of topical adapalene in pregnancy has not been well studied but has a theoretical risk of retinoid embryopathy. Thus far, there is no evidence that the cream causes problems in the baby if used during pregnancy.

Topical adapalene has poor systemic absorption and results in low blood levels (less than 0.025 mcg/L) even after long term use, suggesting that there is low risk of harm for a nursing infant.

== Interactions ==

Adapalene has been shown to enhance the efficacy of topical clindamycin, although adverse effects are also increased. Application of adapalene gel to the skin 3–5 minutes before application of clindamycin enhances penetration of clindamycin into the skin, which may enhance the overall efficacy of the treatment as compared to clindamycin alone.

== Pharmacology ==
Unlike the retinoid tretinoin (Retin-A), adapalene has also been shown to retain its efficacy when applied at the same time as benzoyl peroxide due to its more stable chemical structure. Furthermore, photodegradation of the molecule is less of a concern in comparison to tretinoin and tazarotene.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Absorption of adapalene through the skin is low. A study with six acne patients treated once daily for five days with two grams of adapalene cream applied to of skin found no quantifiable amounts, or less than 0.35 ng/mL of the drug, in the patients&#x27; blood plasma. Controlled trials of chronic users of adapalene have found drug levels in the patients&#x27; plasma to be 0.25 ng/mL.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
Adapalene is highly lipophilic. When applied topically, it readily penetrates hair follicles and absorption occurs five minutes after topical application. After penetration into the follicle, adapalene binds to nuclear retinoic acid receptors (namely retinoic acid receptor beta and gamma). These complexes then bind to the retinoid X receptor which induces gene transcription by binding to specific DNA sites, thus modulating downstream keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation. This results in normalization of keratinocyte differentiation, allowing for decreased microcomedone formation, decreased clogging of pores, and increased exfoliation by increasing cell turnover. Adapalene is also regarded as an anti-inflammatory agent, as it suppresses the inflammatory response stimulated by the presence of &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;, and inhibits both lipoxygenase activity and the oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins.

Adapalene selectively targets retinoic acid receptor beta and retinoic acid receptor gamma when applied to epithelial cells such as those found in the skin. Its agonism of the gamma subtype is largely responsible for adapalene&#x27;s observed effects. In fact, when adapalene is applied in conjunction with a retinoic acid receptor gamma antagonist, adapalene loses clinical efficacy.

Retinization is a common temporary phenomenon reported by patients when initiating use of retinoids. Within the initial period of treatment, skin can become red, irritated, dry and may burn or itch from retinoid application; however, this tends to resolve within four weeks with once a day use.

=== Metabolism ===
Extensive information regarding adapalene metabolism in humans is unavailable, although it is known to accumulate in the liver and GI-tract. In human, mouse, rat, rabbit, and dog cultured hepatocytes, metabolism appears to affect the methoxybenzene moiety but remains incompletely characterized. The major products of metabolism are glucuronides. Approximately 25% of the drug is metabolized; the rest is excreted as parent drug

== History ==
Adapalene was a research product of the Swiss company Galderma. Adapalene was approved in 1996 by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the treatment of acne.

== Research ==
A study has concluded that adapalene can be used to treat plantar warts and may help clear lesions faster than cryotherapy. A computational study claims that adapalene can be used as a potential entry inhibitor for Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2.

<text>Yordan Yovchev Yovchev (; born February 24, 1973), also spelled Jordan Jovtchev, is a retired Bulgarian gymnast. He took part in six consecutive Olympic Games, more than any other Bulgarian athlete in Olympic history. He is president of the Bulgarian Gymnastics Federation and also serves as a sports commentator.

==Biography==

Yovchev was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria. He won silver in the men&#x27;s rings at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a score of 9.850. In the same Olympic Games, Yovchev won bronze in the men&#x27;s floor exercise with a score of 9.775. In the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia, he won the bronze on both floor exercise and still rings with 9.787 and 9.762 respectively. He also won two World Championship Bronze medals in the all around (1999, 2001).

Yovchev made his fifth Olympic team for the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and qualified again for the Rings exercise. He qualified second with a score of 16.275 under the new scoring system, but missed a handstand and finished the final in last place with a score of 15.525.

He has competed in many SASUKE tournaments, reaching the final stage in the 8th competition; he did not pass the spider climb in the first 15 seconds, so the walls spread apart and he fell. He is the only competitor to not pass the spider climb in this version of the final stage, other than Shingo Yamamoto who did not complete it due to injury, but his early failure could be attributed to the heavy rain during the entire competition. Since then he has not passed the third stage.

He, Krasimir Dunev, and Ivan Ivankov moved to the United States after the 1996 Summer Olympics, staying in Detroit, Michigan as they wanted to compete professionally in the United States. During his career, he turned down proposals to change his sporting allegiance and compete for the United States.

He coached and trained in Norman, Oklahoma, and Houston, Texas, before moving back to Bulgaria in 2007. He and his wife, Boriana, have a son, Yordan Jr.

In 2009, he was elected president of the Bulgarian Gymnastics Federation.

Yordan Yovchev qualified and participated in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, which was his 6th appearance at the Olympic Games, a record at that time for a gymnast, along with Oksana Chusovitina who also made her 6th Olympic appearance in 2012 (she now holds the record alone, having competed in her 8th Olympics in 2021). He was also his country&#x27;s flagbearer during the opening ceremony. Yovchev officially retired from the sport in February 2013.

In 2016, he was inducted in the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame.

==Results on SASUKE==
*8th competition (59): Failed Spider Climb - Final Stage
*12th competition (99): Failed Cliff Hanger Kai - Third Stage
*14th competition (91): Failed Cliff Hanger Kai - Third Stage
*15th competition (97): Failed Warped Wall - First Stage
*16th competition (95): Failed Cliff Hanger Kai - Third Stage
*20th competition (1993)*: Failed Warped Wall - First Stage
*23rd competition (79): Failed Rope Ladder - First Stage
* *In the 20th competition, the numbering system for the contestants ran from 1901–2000 to indicate that 2000 competitors have attempted SASUKE. Instead of being number 93, Yovchev&#x27;s number was 1993.

<doc id="925777" wikidata="Q1150514" url="?curid=925777" title="IFC (American TV channel)">
<text>IFC is an American basic cable channel owned by AMC Networks. Launched in 1994 as the Independent Film Channel, a spin-off of former sister channel Bravo, IFC originally operated as a commercial-free service, devoted to showing independent films without interruption. Starting in the late 2000s, the channel gradually moved its programming from independent films into comedy, horror, and cult television shows and films. IFC became an ad-supported service in 2010, and officially retired its full name in 2014. 

AMC Networks operates a subsidiary known as IFC Films, the film offshoot of the channel that operates the IFC Center. In September 2018, it was estimated that approximately 75,295,000 American households (63% of households with television) received IFC. By December 2023, that number would drop to 56,185,000 households.

==History==

The channel debuted on September 1, 1994, under the ownership of Rainbow Media, a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation. IFC originated as a spin-off of then-sibling channel Bravo, which focused at that time on a wider variety of programming, including shows related to fine arts. In 2000, IFC launched a motion picture division. 

In 2005, IFC expanded into its first non-television venture and opened the IFC Center, a movie theater for independent film in New York City. In 2008, IFC launched its Media Lab Studios, a section of its website on which users can enter IFC-sponsored film contests, and can view others&#x27; films. In 2008, Rainbow Media acquired IFC&#x27;s rival network, Sundance Channel, from Robert Redford and Showtime Networks.


Towards the end of the decade, IFC began to expand its programming beyond independent films, producing original series and acquiring cult television series. In March 2010, IFC unveiled a new slogan, &quot;Always on. Slightly off.&quot;, reflecting the channel&#x27;s new focus on comedy programming. On December 8, IFC began airing commercials within its programming, a move that sparked controversy among its viewers, and would also begin to censor its programming. 

IFC eventually reversed its censorship practices and started to air its programming uncut; publicly trumpeting this fact in 2012 by releasing ads featuring showings of back-to-back blocks of movies like the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; film series, highlighting the nudity and gore. On July 1, 2011, Rainbow Media was spun off from Cablevision into a separate company, which was renamed AMC Networks.

=== 2012 Dish Network carriage dispute ===
On May 4, 2012, Dish Network announced that it would no longer carry the AMC Networks family of cable channels upon the expiration of the satellite provider&#x27;s distribution agreement with the company at the end of June 2012, citing that AMC Networks charged an excessive amount in retransmission consent payments from the service for their carriage and low audience viewership for the channels.

AMC Networks responded to Dish Network&#x27;s announcement of its pending removal of the channels as being related to a 2008 breach of contract lawsuit against Dish Network by the company&#x27;s former Voom HD Networks subsidiary (under the company&#x27;s previous Rainbow Media Holdings brand) (which is pending trial in the New York State Supreme Court), in which it is seeking more than $2.5 billion in damages against Dish Network for improperly terminating its carriage contract; Voom&#x27;s high-definition channels were carried on the provider from May 1, 2005, until May 12, 2008, when Dish removed ten of Voom&#x27;s fifteen channels from its lineup and the five remaining channels the following day. Dish Network stated that the lawsuit is unrelated to the decision to remove the AMC Networks channels and that it ended the carriage agreement on its own terms.

On May 20, 2012, Dish Network removed Sundance Channel from its channel lineup. Two weeks later on June 4, 2012, Dish relocated AMC, WEtv, and IFC to higher channel positions with AMC being split into two separate standard definition and high definition channel feeds (AMC moved from channel 130 to channel 9609 for the SD feed and 9610 for the HD feed, WEtv moved from channel 128 to channel 9608 and IFC was moved from channel 393 to channel 9607); the former channel lineup spaces occupied by the three channels were respectively replaced with HDNet, Style and MoviePlex multiplex channel Indieplex. The move is believed to be in response to an ad run during a June 3 airing of an episode of &quot;Mad Men&quot; urging Dish Network customers to inform the company to keep the three AMC Networks channels on the satellite provider, with Dish Network stating that the relocated channel positions better reflect the channels&#x27; ratings.

On July 1, 2012, Dish Network dropped AMC, WEtv, and IFC from the channel line-up altogether.

On October 21, 2012, AMC Networks announced a settlement was reached between them, Cablevision and Dish in which Dish was forced to pay up to $700 million in damages to Cablevision for damages from removing Voom owned channels off the Dish lineup back in 2008, and in return Dish signed a new agreement to bring the AMC Networks owned channels back on the Dish lineup with AMC returning October 21 and the rest on November 1.

=== Recent history ===

On January 9, 2014, it was announced that the channel&#x27;s full name had been retired, and that the name IFC would officially have no meaning. On November 15, 2016, AMC Networks acquired a minority stake in comedy video website and film and television production company Funny or Die, with plans to integrate it with IFC. On April 27, 2018, the company later acquired a majority stake in comedy venue operator Levity Live.

==Programming==

IFC primarily airs comedy and horror-genre programming, including both original and acquired series and films. Original programming produced for the channel over the years include &quot;Documentary Now!&quot;, &quot;Sherman&#x27;s Showcase&quot;, and British co-production &quot;Year of the Rabbit&quot;.

==International version==
===Canada===

The Canadian version of the Independent Film Channel launched on August 15, 2001, under the ownership of Salter Street Films, under a brand licensing agreement with Rainbow Media. Alliance Atlantis acquired the channel in December 2001, through its purchase of Salter Street Films. On January 18, 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media, acquired control of IFC through its purchase of Alliance Atlantis&#x27; broadcasting assets, which were placed in a trust in August 2007.

On October 27, 2010, IFC Canada&#x27;s ownership changed again through Shaw Communications&#x27; acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs&#x27; interest in CW Media. As with its U.S. namesake, the channel originally focused almost exclusively on smaller independent films. However, IFC Canada broadened its programming focus to include more mainstream films from large production studios, as the U.S. channel has done. It also de-emphasized the use of the full &quot;Independent Film Channel&quot; name, possibly due to the decrease in the number of independent films on its schedule.

None of IFC&#x27;s original programming aired on IFC Canada during its run. Rival broadcaster Bell Media currently owns exclusive rights to their shows and has aired them on their various networks, including Crave and Much. The channel ceased broadcasting on September 30, 2019.

<doc id="925782" wikidata="Q2559131" url="?curid=925782" title="San Bernardino Tunnel">
<text>The San Bernardino road tunnel is a road tunnel in the canton of Graubünden in south-eastern Switzerland. It runs under the San Bernardino Pass between the town of San Bernardino and the town of Hinterrhein, and forms part of the A13 motorway and the European route E43. The tunnel was completed in 1967 and is long. Since the opening of the tunnel, the Val Mesolcina, one of the Italian-speaking southern valleys of Graubünden, is now connected all-year round with the rest of the canton.

The San Bernardino Tunnel is part of the A13 as a single-carriageway freeway and therefore passes through one bore without a central physical structure. As there is only one lane per direction, overtaking (passing other vehicles) inside the tunnel is not permitted. The speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) is enforced by means of speed-check cameras. This road tunnel is considerably less prone to traffic jams than the St. Gotthard Tunnel.

The old name &quot;Vogelberg&quot; may refer to the migratory birds who pass by here every year in large flocks. These have now also discovered the tunnel as a &quot;shortcut&quot;. Sometimes, the traffic must be stopped so that the birds find their way undisturbed.

==History==
In 1967, the long San Bernardino Tunnel was opened as part of the National Road N13 (today A13), between the villages of Hinterrhein and San Bernardino. The tunnel connected Eastern Switzerland with the Canton of Ticino, and is the second most important after the Gotthard Alpine crossing for freight and private transport in Switzerland. At the time of planning the current traffic density was not yet clear. From today&#x27;s perspective, the roadway is very tight, and the ventilation systems did not meet modern requirements. Separate emergency escape tunnels did not exist. The San Bernardino route served the international area as an escape route to the A2 (particularly after the accidental, temporary closure of the Gotthard tunnel in 2001), although the road leading to the tunnel climbs to 8% and has tight bends, as well as a narrow tunnel unsuitable for heavy vehicles. A major refurbishment of the tunnel started in 1991, and was completed in 2006. The following modifications were made:

* lowering the bottom of the centre channel;
* renovation of the drainage system (separate system) and the line channels;
* renewal of electromechanical equipment;
* operational and fire ventilation adapted to contemporary needs;
* creating an emergency escape tunnel;
* demolition and reconstruction of the roadway construction;
* renewal of cladding panels;
* repair, while maintaining the traffic flow.

The total construction costs amounted to approximately CHF 236 million (approximately 148 million euros).

The Mont Blanc tunnel fire between France and Italy in 1999 triggered a general safety review of road tunnels in several countries, including Switzerland. In September 2007, the San Bernardino Tunnel saw the completion of a major safety upgrade. Lighting has been increased and becomes more evenly diffused, with a corresponding improvement in visibility. Particular care has been taken with the visibility of access points to the reworked escape tunnel, minimizing the risk of escape routes becoming obscured by smoke in the event of a major conflagration.

<doc id="925789" wikidata="Q1477952" url="?curid=925789" title="Changing Places">
<text>Changing Places (1975) is the first &quot;campus novel&quot; by British novelist David Lodge. The subtitle is &quot;A Tale of Two Campuses&quot;, and thus a literary allusion to Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Tale of Two Cities&quot;. It is the first novel in a trilogy, followed by &quot;Small World&quot; (1984) and &quot;Nice Work&quot; (1988), in which several of the same characters reappear.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Changing Places&quot; is a comic novel with serious undercurrents. It tells the story of the six-month academic exchange between fictional universities in Rummidge (modelled on Birmingham in England) and Plotinus, in the state of Euphoria (modelled on Berkeley in California). The two academics taking part in the exchange are both aged 40, but appear at first to otherwise have little in common, mainly because of the differing academic systems of their native countries.

The English participant, Philip Swallow, is a very conventional and conformist British academic and somewhat in awe of the American way of life. By contrast the American, Morris Zapp, is a top-ranking American professor who only agrees to go to Rummidge because his wife agrees to postpone long-threatened divorce proceedings on condition that he move out of the marital home for six months. Zapp is at first both contemptuous of, and amused by, what he perceives as the amateurism of British academe.

As the exchange progresses, Swallow and Zapp find that they begin to fit in surprisingly well to their new environments. In the course of the story, each man has an affair with the other&#x27;s wife. Before that, Swallow sleeps with Zapp&#x27;s daughter Melanie, without realising who she is. She takes up with a former undergraduate student of his, Charles Boon.

Swallow and Zapp even consider remaining permanently. The book ends with the two couples convened in a New York hotel room to decide their fates. The novel ends without a clear-cut decision, though the sequel &quot;Small World: An Academic Romance&quot;, reveals that Swallow and Zapp returned to their home countries and domestic situations.

==Biographical basis==
David Lodge has stated that the character of Morris Zapp was inspired by the literary critic Stanley Fish.

<doc id="925795" wikidata="Q56424" url="?curid=925795" title="Camiling">
<text>Camiling, officially the Municipality of Camiling, (; ; ), is a municipality in the province of Tarlac in the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 87,319 people.

Camiling is one of the fastest-growing towns of Tarlac when it comes to income and economy. It is also considered one of the richest when it comes to cultural heritage in the entire province. The town is also dubbed to be the &quot;Old Lady in the Northwestern province of Tarlac&quot;, because it is one of the oldest municipalities created by the Spanish government under the province of Pangasinan where it previously included the former barrio of Mayantoc, San Clemente, and Santa Ignacia. The municipality also features cultural antiquity such as its churches, ancestral houses, and ruins. However, the baroque church of Camiling has yet to be restored after 20 years since a fire burned its interior. The inside of the church, one of the only two Spanish churches left in Tarlac, has become a cesspool for human waste, while the facade (front) and buttresses (side supports) have been occupied by business establishments. One buttress has been converted by a business store into a toilet. Heritage advocates and Camiling locals have been campaigning for the restoration of the church after the reports came out in March 2018.

Camiling is the major municipality in north-western Tarlac. It is the commercial center of an area composed of about eight towns, and borders the province of Pangasinan. It is the gateway to central and western Pangasinan through the Romulo Highway (formerly Highway 13). It is also known for its famous &quot; Camiling&quot; and its green native rice cake called .

== History ==

Camiling began its history as a settlement located near the Camiling River.

During the classical era, the area used to be lush in tropical rainforest and was used mainly by the local Pangasinense people. When the polity of Caboloan was established in 1406, the area was incorporated as part of the kingdom. It was ruled by a series of native huangs (kings/queens), namely, Urduja, Kamayin, Taymey, and Liyu. Majority of its rulers are unnamed as no document of them were properly recorded. For a short period, an emperor in China became an honorary ruler as well.

In 1575, the Chinese pirate Limahong attacked the polity and declared himself as ruler of the Caboloan realms. The kingdom was eventually abolished in 1576, when the Spanish attacked and ransacked the kingdom&#x27;s capital of Binalatongan (present-day San Carlos, Pangasinan). It was later on incorporated into the Spanish Empire.

Early in the 18th century, the community was a sitio of Paniqui; before and after, Paniqui was also part of Bayambang. The town&#x27;s name is derived from &quot; or &quot;camiling&quot;&quot;, the Pangasinan name for the &quot;Semecarpus cuneiformis&quot; tree, which at that time grew abundantly in the wilderness.

The community was originally a vast area of Cogon growth interposed with thick forestalls areas stretching into the Zambales mountain ranges. A wide river cut through it. The early inhabitants of the place were the Aetas who make a living by gathering fruit from fruit trees, hunting, and fishing. With the coming first of the Pangasinenses and later the Ilocanos from the north, the Aetas who used to roam freely in the wilderness obliged themselves to move into the interior.

The new settlers first occupied the swampy land, now known as &quot;Cacamilingan&quot; on the right side of the river. In time, these settlers began moving to the left opposite shore because of more frequent disastrous floods. To this new location, the residents therein built a small church with Saint Michael as the patron saint.

Camiling became a District Commission from 1834 to 1837 founded by Don Francisco Soriano, the then Cabeza de Barangay who became the town&#x27;s first District Commissioner. In 1838, Camiling became an independent town, formally separated from the mother town of Paniqui and with Don Vicente Galsim, as the first Gobernadorcillo. Thirty-eight others followed him. Don Jose Sabado, the last to serve under the Spanish regime and the first Presidente Municipal under the Revolutionary Government by Aguinaldo.

Camiling was a first-class municipality during the 1970s but was reclassified when the Local Government Code went into effect in the early 1990s. It became again a first-class municipality again on November 20, 2001, by virtue of the Latest Income Class Classification (L.I.C.C.) initiated by the Department of Finance; the Local Government Unit of Camiling was reclassified from a second class municipality to a first-class municipality, having attained an annual income of 50,942,508.51 pesos. In 2008, Camiling&#x27;s income was more than 72,463,893,00 pesos with average growth of more than 5.164% per year (2001–2008).

===Cultural representations===
The town of San Diego in Jose Rizal&#x27;s 1887 novel, &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot;, is the municipality of Camiling in real life. The old Saint Michael the Archangel Parish Church of Camiling and Leonor Rivera were all real-life inspiration to the novel.

== Geography ==
Camiling is north-north-west of Manila, and from provincial capital Tarlac City. It borders San Clemente on the west, Bayambang from the north, Santa Ignacia and Mayantoc to the south and Paniqui and Moncada by the east.

Mostly of plain topography but some parts are hilly to mountainous in which the barangays of Papaac, Bacsay, Birbira and Cayasan, to name a few. The deeper part of the mountains can be described as a place where wild animals live, such as deer, Toddy cat (Musang), wild boar (Baboy ramo), Monitor lizard (Bayawak).

=== Barangays ===
Camiling is politically subdivided into 61 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.

<doc id="925796" wikidata="Q1325403" url="?curid=925796" title="Beneath the Wheel">
<text>Beneath the Wheel (Unterm Rad) is a 1906 novel written by Hermann Hesse. The novel is a severe criticism of academic education that ignores students&#x27; personal development; in that respect, it is typical of Hesse&#x27;s work. A Peter Owen Publishers translation was published in 1957 as The Prodigy. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux in 1968 published as &quot;Beneath the Wheel&quot; an English translation by Michael Roloff. 

There are autobiographical elements in the story (Hesse attended and was expelled from the seminary described in the novel).

==Plot summary==
&quot;Beneath the Wheel&quot; is the story of Hans Giebenrath, a talented boy sent to a seminary in Maulbronn. His education is focused solely on increasing his knowledge, neglecting personal development. His close friendship with Hermann Heilner, a more liberal fellow student, is a source of comfort for Hans. Heilner is expelled from the seminary, and Giebenrath is sent home after his academic performance declines as symptoms of mental illness develop.

Back home, he finds coping with his situation difficult, having lost most of his childhood to scholastic study, and having never formed lasting personal relationships with anyone in his village. He is apprenticed to a mechanic, and seems to find satisfaction in the work: it is visceral and concrete, as opposed to the intellectual abstraction of scholarly pursuit. Despite some personal fulfillment in this existence, Hans never fully adjusts to his new situation, and on a pub crawl in a neighboring village he and some colleagues get drunk. Hans leaves the group to walk home early, and is later found drowned in a river.

<text>Raymond Albert Wheeler (31 July 1885 – 9 February 1974) was a lieutenant general in the United States Army Corps of Engineers and an engineer of international recognition. He fought in both World Wars, at the Marne in World War I, where he earned a Silver Star, and in the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II, where he personally accepted the Japanese surrender in Singapore. During and after the war he held key roles in major engineering projects of the 20th century, to include construction of the Ledo Road, St. Lawrence Seaway, and Missouri Basin Program, the clearing of the Suez Canal during the Suez Crisis, and the construction of tens of thousands of miles of rail and highway through Iraq and Iran during the development of Allied supply lines from Europe to Russia during World War II.

==Life and career==

He was born to Stephen and Margaret (née Maple) Wheeler in Peoria, Illinois on 31 July 1885. He attended the United States Military Academy, graduating 5th in his class in 1911, subsequently participating in the construction of the Panama Canal and working on engineering projects in Mexico with Douglas MacArthur, who was then a captain in the Corps of Engineers.

He attended the United States Army War College from 1936 to 1937.

At the time the United States entered World War II, Wheeler was developing a transportation network in the Middle East to ship munitions to the Soviet Union, which involved the extensive rebuilding of the railroads and highways of Iraq and Iran. In autumn 1943, he was appointed to the South East Asia Command (SEAC) of the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II on the staff of Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, where he served as principal administrative officer and directed construction of the Ledo Road. From February 1944, he served as Deputy Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, replacing General &quot;Vinegar Joe&quot; Stilwell, and was the United States&#x27; representative in August 1945 at the Japanese surrender in Singapore.

He served as Chief of Engineers for the United States Army Corps of Engineers from 4 October 1945 to 28 February 1949, managing major projects including the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Missouri Valley Development. Following his retirement from the Army in 1949, Wheeler joined the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as an engineering consultant; among the projects he was consulted on was a 9,000-mile survey of Indus basin water resources. He commanded the United Nations Suez Canal Clearance Operations following the 1956 Suez Crisis.

<doc id="925802" wikidata="Q2154318" url="?curid=925802" title="Ruki sound law">
<text>The ruki sound law, also known as the ruki rule or iurk rule, is a historical sound change that took place in the satem branches of the Indo-European language family, namely in Balto-Slavic, Armenian, and Indo-Iranian. According to this sound law, an original changed to (a sound similar to English ⟨sh⟩) after the consonants , , , and the semi-vowels (*u̯) and (*i̯), as well as the syllabic allophones , , and :

: &gt; / _

Specifically, the initial stage involves the retraction of the coronal sibilant after semi-vowels, , or a velar consonant , or . In the second stage, leveling of the sibilant system resulted in retroflexion (cf. Sanskrit ष and Proto-Slavic), and later retraction to velar in Slavic and some Middle Indic languages. This rule was first formulated by Holger Pedersen, and it is sometimes known as &quot;Pedersen&#x27;s law&quot;, although this term is also applied to another sound law concerning stress in the Balto-Slavic languages.

The name &quot;ruki&quot; comes from the sounds (r, u, K, i) which triggered the sound change. The law is stated as a mnemonic rule because the word руки means &#x27;hands, arms&#x27; in Russian, or is the genitive singular form (&#x27;of the hand&#x27;) of (compare &quot;rule of thumb&quot;).

==Applications to language groups==
The rule was originally formulated for Sanskrit. It was later proposed to be valid in some degree for all satem languages, and exceptionless for the Indo-Iranian languages. (There appears to be one exception at least in some Nuristani languages, however.) In Baltic and Albanian, it is limited or affected to a greater or lesser extent by other sound laws. Nevertheless, it has to have been universal in these branches of the IE languages, and the lack of Slavic reflexes before consonants is due rather to their merger with the reflexes of other sibilants.

===Exceptions in Slavic languages===
In Slavic languages the process is regular before a vowel, but it does not take place before consonants. The final result is the voiceless velar fricative , which is even more retracted than the . This velar fricative changed back into before a front vowel or the palatal approximant .

===Exceptions in Indo-Iranian languages===
In Indo-Iranian *&quot;r&quot; and *&quot;l&quot; merged, and the change worked even after the new sound; e.g. Avestan &quot;karš-&quot;, Sanskrit &quot;kárṣati&quot; &#x27;to plough&#x27; &lt; PIE . This has been cited as evidence by many scholars as an argument for the later influence of Iranian languages on Proto-Slavic. There are obvious drawbacks in the theory. First, the two sounds must have been very close (&quot;r&quot;/&quot;l&quot;), so that both could have triggered the change in Indo-Iranian. Second, there are no real examples of this change working in Slavic, and it is also doubtful that only this change (ruki) and no other such change of sibilants (e.g. &gt; &quot;h&quot;) was borrowed into Slavic.

The syllabic laryngeal *H̥ becomes *i in Proto-Indo-Iranian, and this also triggered RUKI.

A later extension of RUKI was particular to the Iranian languages: *s, *z shift to *š, *ž also after the labial stops *p, *b, including even secondary *s from Proto-Indo-Iranian *ć &lt; PIE *ḱ.

====Nuristani====
The Ruki rule also displays a rather different behavior in Nuristani, conditioned by the following factors:

* The reflex of the Proto-Indo-European sequence *ḱs is Nuristani *ć (pronounced [t͡s]), the same as that of plain *ḱ, thus in this context there is no evidence of the operation of RUKI. For example, the word for &quot;bear&quot;, reflecting Proto-Indo-European *h₂ŕ̥tḱos (Sanskrit &quot;ṛ́kṣa&quot; &quot;bear&quot;, Avestan &quot;arṣ̌a&quot;) shows a dental affricate in most Nuristani languages, such as Ashkun and Katë &quot;ić, and Nuristani Kalasha &quot;oć.
* Proto-Indo-European sequences *ks and *kʷs appears to have become Nuristani *c̣. Thus Proto-Indo-European *ksurós &quot;razor&quot; is reflected as &quot;kṣurá&quot; in Sanskrit, but &quot;c̣uři&quot; &quot;sickle&quot; in the Southeastern Katë dialect.
* Various cases where RUKI failed to operate after *i and *u in Nuristani exist. Hegedűs notes that these all seem to trace back to PIE etyma where the *us and *is sequences were earlier *uHs and *iHs, meaning the laryngeals seem to have blocked the operation of RUKI. For example, PIE *múh₂s &quot;mouse&quot; &gt; Sanskrit &quot;mū́ṣ&quot;, Avestan &quot;mūš&quot;, but Southeastern Katë &quot;musë&quot;, Prasun &quot;mǖsu&quot;, while Nuristani Kalasha &quot;pusa&quot; is of dubious etymology on account of the different initial consonant, and Ashkun &quot;moṣ&quot; shows the Indo-Aryan reflex, probably due to influence or borrowing from Indo-Aryan.
* Proto-Indo-European *rs and *ls merge into Nuristani *ṣ, thus after *r we do actually see proper RUKI-like behavior in Nuristani, such as Proto-Indo-European *kʷels- yielding Southeastern Katë &quot;kṣō-&quot; &quot;to pull&quot;.

===Albanian===
According to Orel (2000: 62), Albanian shows a limited RUKI-like development, where &quot;*s&quot; becomes &quot;sh&quot; only after PIE *y, *w (including their vocalic counterparts &quot;*i, *u&quot;). E.g.
* &quot;lesh&quot; &#x27;wool, fleece, hair&#x27; &lt; *laysa, cf. Slavic &#x27;leaf&#x27; &lt; *leys-to-
* &quot;dash&quot; &#x27;ram&#x27; &lt; *dawsa, cf. Germanic &lt; *dʰews-om
* &quot;pishë&quot; &#x27;pine&#x27; &lt; *pisā, cf. Latin &quot;pīnus&quot; &#x27;pine&#x27; &lt; *pi(t)snos
* &quot;prush&quot; &#x27;ember&#x27; &lt; *prusa, cf. Latin &quot;prūna&quot; &#x27;ember&#x27; &lt; *prusnā; Sanskrit &quot;ploṣati&quot; &#x27;to burn&#x27; &lt; 
This differs from the development of &quot;*rs&quot;, &quot;*ks&quot;, and of &quot;*s&quot; after other vowels, e.g.
* &quot;djerr&quot; &#x27;fallow land&#x27; &lt; *dersa, cf. Greek &quot;χέρσος&quot; &#x27;dry land&#x27; &lt; *ǵʰers-
* &quot;hirrë&quot; &#x27;whey&#x27; &lt; *ksirā, cf. Sanskrit क्षीर / &quot;kṣīrá&quot; &#x27;milk&#x27;
* &quot;kohë&quot; &#x27;time&#x27; &lt; *kāsā, cf. Slavic &#x27;time&#x27; &lt; *kʷeh₁s-eh₂

However, this view of Albanian is controversial. Firstly, the words in question that Orel bases this theory on have shaky etymologies. &quot;Dash&quot; has a disputed etymology, with rival versions attributing the word not to Proto-Indo-European *dʰews-om but instead *dʰeh₁-l-, or *demh₂ from *dmh₂ &quot;to tame&quot;. &quot;Pishë&quot; meanwhile is argued to not be inherited from Proto-Indo-European at all; rather it and its soundalikes in Greek and Latin are in fact substrate vocabulary. &quot;Lesh&quot; is alternatively attributed instead to *h₂welh₁- &quot;wool&quot;, making it cognate to Latin &quot;vellus&quot;.

Meanwhile, no RUKI-like rule is included in other studies of Proto-Albanian diachrony. Michiel de Vaan (2015) instead has a Proto-Albanian *ʃ emerging from different means, which barely resemble a RUKI law: Indo-European *ks shares the fate of simple *s in becoming *ʃ before *t (as occurred for &quot;jashtë&quot; &quot;outside&quot; and &quot;gjashtë&quot; &quot;six&quot;, but not other cases with *ks where *t did not follow), with *t as the conditioning factor, rather than the prior *k. Meanwhile, the development of *s itself is highly disputed, but in contrast to Orel&#x27;s view that it was conditioned on a RUKI-like phenomenon, De Vaan prefers Kortlandt&#x27;s view that *s became *ʃ when either followed by an unstressed vowel or intervocalically, regardless of the quality of nearby vowels.

<doc id="925806" wikidata="Q4634823" url="?curid=925806" title="31st Division (United Kingdom)">
<text>The 31st Division was an infantry division of the British Army. It was raised in the Great War by volunteers from Kitchener&#x27;s Army and formed in April 1915 as part of the K4 Army Group and taken over by the War Office on 10 August 1915. Comprising mainly infantry battalions from Yorkshire and Lancashire, the division was sent to Egypt in December 1915 before moving to France in March 1916 and spent the remainder of the First World War in action on the Western Front. The 31st Division was the quintessential New Army division, being made up entirely of Pals battalions.

The 31st Division&#x27;s first major action was on the first day on the Somme (1 July 1916). The division suffered 3,600 casualties and failed to reach any of its objectives. Later it served at the Battle of the Ancre and at Oppy Wood. It took part in the defence against the German spring offensive in early 1918, and finally in the victorious battles of the Hundred Days Offensive.

==Recruitment==

On 6 August 1914, less than 48 hours after Britain&#x27;s declaration of war, Parliament sanctioned an increase of 500,000 men for the Regular Army, and on 11 August the newly-appointed Secretary of State for War, Field Marshal Earl Kitchener of Khartoum, issued his famous call to arms: &#x27;Your King and Country Need You&#x27;, urging the first 100,000 volunteers to come forward. This group of six divisions with supporting arms became known as Kitchener&#x27;s First New Army, or &#x27;K1&#x27;. The flood of volunteers overwhelmed the ability of the army to absorb and organise them, and by the time the Fifth New Army (K5) was authorised, many of its constituent units were being organised as &#x27;Pals battalions&#x27; under the auspices of mayors and corporations of towns up and down the country.

==Training==
In late May and early June 1915 the units of the 31st Division began to assemble at South Camp, Ripon, where brigade training began in earnest. Musketry training was finally begun in August, and in September the division moved to Hurdcott Camp at Fovant where the division received SMLE service rifles and carried out final intensive battle training in the Salisbury Plain Training Area.

==Service==
===Egypt===
On 29 November 1915 the division received warning orders to join the British Expeditionary Force in France, and advance parties set out for the embarkation ports of Folkestone and Southampton. At the last minute, the destination was changed to Egypt, the advance parties were recalled, and on 7 December the troops embarked at Devonport.

The division reached Port Said between 24 December and 23 January 1916 and went into the Suez Canal defences at Qantara. On 26 February orders arrived to reverse the process and on 1 March the division began re-embarking at Port Said. It unloaded at Marseille between 6 and 16 March and then concentrated in the Somme area as part of the BEF. It remained on the Western Front for the rest of the war.

===Somme===
The division was introduced to trench warfare in March in front of Beaumont-Hamel and Y Ravine. Although this was a quiet sector of the line, the troops suffered their first casualties during this short tour, mainly from German &quot;Minenwerfer&quot;s (trench mortars). Shortly afterwards the 31st Division formed its own light trench mortar batteries (TMBs). It also provided working parties to assist the 252nd Tunnelling Company, Royal Engineers, digging the Hawthorn Ridge mine that was to be exploded to launch the forthcoming Battle of the Somme. Over the following weeks the battalions took their turns in the routine of trench holding, working parties, patrolling and trench raiding, with a constant drain on manpower from shelling and snipers.

The 92nd Brigade held the front line trenches during the British bombardment in the days leading up to the battle, suffering significant casualties from the German counter-bombardment. The night before the battle, working parties from the 92nd Brigade were out in No man&#x27;s land cutting lanes through the British barbed wire for the assaulting troops to pass through. It then withdrew into the support trenches, to hold the front line while the other two brigades attacked on 1 July. Despite all the preparation and high hopes, the First day on the Somme was a disaster for 31st Division. 93 and 94 Brigades went &#x27;over the top&#x27; at 07.30 on 1 July, 10 minutes after the explosion of the nearby Hawthorn Ridge mine had alerted the enemy. Their objective was the village of Serre. The advancing lines were almost annihilated by German machine guns and shellfire, and only a few parties got into the enemy front line, where they remained pinned down. The division was unable to get any support to them across the fire-swept No man&#x27;s land for the rest of the day.

On 2 July the shattered division was pulled out of the line and sent north to a quiet sector for rest and refit, though there was the usual trickle of casualties associated with trench holding and raiding.
===Ancre===
The Somme Offensive was still going on at the end of October when the 31st Division returned to the sector for the Battle of the Ancre, which was to be the last big operation of the year. Serre had still not been taken, and the 92nd Brigade was assigned to the attack alongside 3rd Division (the rest of 31st Division was still too shattered to take part). A 48-hour preliminary bombardment began on 11 November, and the brigade moved into the trenches on the night of 12/13, along communication trenches clogged with mud. Zero hour was 05.30 on 13 November, and fog, light rain and a smokescreen reduced visibility to a few yards, so that the leading battalions initially had little difficulty, but the 3rd Division on their right made no progress. Small-scale fighting went on all day, and Private John Cunningham of the 12th East Yorks won a Victoria Cross (VC) for fighting on alone when all the rest of his team of bombers became casualties. At the end of the day the brigade had been driven back to its starting positions and suffered over 800 casualties.

The Division remained on the Ancre through the winter of 1916–17, following up the Germans when they retired to the Hindenburg Line in the Spring of 1917.

===Oppy Wood===
On 8 April 1917, the division left the Ancre and moved to the Arras sector for the Arras Offensive. After a period of training and trench-holding, the division moved into assembly trenches opposite Oppy during the night of 2/3 May, under shellfire. The British creeping barrage started at 03.45 and the 92nd and 93rd Brigades set off, in the dark and mist, into severe machine gun fire from Oppy Wood. 92 Brigade was held up in No man&#x27;s land and suffered severe casualties. 2nd Lieutenant Jack Harrison of the 11th East Yorks was awarded a posthumous VC.
Casualties in the 12th East Yorks had been so severe that it was temporarily reduced to two composite companies attached to the 10th and 11th Battalions respectively. A fresh attack on Oppy Wood was arranged for 28 June. This time the attack was to be made by the 94th Brigade with the 92nd Brigade in support. The attack was made in the evening of 28 June and successfully took the trenches, completing the Capture of Oppy Wood.
The 31st Division was not committed to the Third Ypres Offensive, which culminated in the dreadful Battle of Passchendaele, possibly because it was not considered to have recovered from its ordeal on the Somme a year before. By the beginning of 1918 the BEF was suffering a severe manpower crisis: brigades were reorganised on a three-battalion basis in February, with the surplus men being drafted to bring other units up to strength. In the 31st Division, however, this process was even more severe, with the whole of the 94th Brigade disappearing, to be replaced temporarily by the 4th Guards Brigade, and later by a reformed 94th Brigade composed of Yeomanry units recalled from Palestine.

===Ervillers and Ayette===
When the German spring offensive opened on 21 March 1918, 31st Division was in reserve until it was sent up on 23 March; even then the 92nd Brigade remained in reserve at Ervillers, improving the defences. Ervillers was attacked on the evening of 24 March, the defence being confused by British troops retreating from the forward defences. There was fighting in the village streets, but the next day the combined fire of 92nd Brigade and part of 42nd (East Lancashire) Division stopped the German advance. However, events elsewhere meant that the 31st and 42nd Divisions were ordered to retire on the morning of 27 March. 92 Brigade then defended Ayette aerodrome against repeated attacks until, with both flanks &#x27;in the air&#x27;, it pulled back to the partly-dug &#x27;Purple Line&#x27; in front of Ayette village. 2nd Lieutenant Basil Horsfall of the 11th East Lancs was awarded a posthumous VC. During the night, a composite battalion of troops from the 92nd Brigade&#x27;s quartermaster details arrived to take over part of the Purple Line. The division was relieved on 31 March.

===Hazebrouck===
While resting in the Monchy-Breton area the division received large numbers of reinforcements, mainly under the age of 19. The bombardment for the second phase of the German offensive (the Battles of the Lys) opened on 7 April, and on 11 April the division had been called forward in ex-London buses to form a defensive line near Estaires through which retreating British and Portuguese troops could withdraw. Next day the Germans threw in all their reserves to try to take Hazebrouck. Over successive days confused fighting went on, units fighting rearguards often finding their flanks left in the air and being forced to retire until on 14 April the division withdrew through a new line held by fresh Australian and British troops, who defeated the attacks and ensured the safety of Hazebrouck. A temporary 92nd Composite Battalion was formed from the 92nd Brigade to assist the Australians.

===La Becque and Ploegsteert===
Once out of the line the division began training for offensive operations. 31st Division took part in Operation Borderland, a limited attack on La Becque and other fortified farms in front of the Forest of Nieppe on 28 June, in what was described as &#x27;a model operation&#x27; for artillery cooperation. Individual units continued to make small advances through aggressive patrolling and seizing strongpoints (so-called &#x27;peaceful penetration&#x27;) until the Allies began a coordinated offensive in August. The division captured Vieux-Berquin on 13 August 1918 and pushed forward until running into serious opposition south of Ploegsteert on 21 August, where fighting continued into September.

A formal attack was arranged for the morning of 28 September (the opening day of the Fifth Battle of Ypres). Although suffering heavy casualties, the 92nd Brigade and a battalion from the 93rd Brigade took their objectives, though they were shelled out part of Ploegsteert Wood. The rest of the 93rd Brigade then crossed the Douve stream accompanied by artillery and engineers, the 94th (Yeomanry) Brigade was held up the rear). The general retirement of the Germans along the whole line then allowed the division to push on through Ploegsteert Wood and advance up to the River Lys on 3 October.

===Pursuit===
Returning to the line on 12 October, patrols from the 92nd Brigade slipped across the Lys on a raft during the night of 14/15 October and established posts on the far bank. The following afternoon further parties crossed and advanced under a barrage to the Deûlémont–Warneton road. The brigade continued the advance on 16 and 17 October, liberating several villages. By 18 October the battalions were advancing in company columns screened by XV Corps cyclist battalion, leap-frogging forward to liberate Tourcoing. Pressure was kept up through 19 and 20 October, until the brigade was squeezed out of the advancing line between Second Army and Fifth Army and went into support, while the 93rd Brigade held the junction between the two armies and continued up to the Scheldt.

The division was back in the line from 28 October, with the 92nd Brigade in the lead continuing to advance slowly against machine gun and shell fire, from rearguards who &#x27;did not appear disposed to give ground&#x27;. The division then made an attack at Tieghem on 31 October 1918 that was so successful that the 92 Brigade in reserve was not required while the 94th (Yeomanry) Brigade drove the enemy behind the Scheldt.

The 31st Division returned to the line on the night of 6/7 November, crossing the Scheldt and sending forward the 11th East Yorks as part of a pursuit force including a field artillery battery and companies from the divisional machine gun battalion, the Motor Machine Gun Corps and XIX Corps cyclists. When the Armistice with Germany came into force on 11 November, the 11th East Lancs were leading the division, and scouts reported that there were no enemy in front.

==Disbandment==
The division began to pull back on 13 November, and by the end of the month was established in camps south of St-Omer and engaged in road repair. Demobilisation (chiefly of coal miners) began on 11 December and proceeded at a steadily increasing rate during January 1919. On 29 January the two East Yorks Battalions were sent by rail to Calais to deal with possible riots by men working in the Ordnance depot. Demobilisation accelerated in February and by April the battalions had been reduced to cadres, which left for England on 22 May. During the war the division&#x27;s casualties amounted to 30,091 killed, wounded, and missing.

* 31st (Hull) Divisional Ammunition Column, RFA
* 124th (2nd Hull) Heavy Battery, Royal Garrison Artillery

When 31st Division embarked for Egypt, the divisional artillery (DA) did not accompany it. Instead, 32nd Division Artillery was attached to 31st Division, and served with it for the rest of the war. (31st DA later joined 32nd Division in France). The 2nd County Palatine Artillery was originally raised in Lancashire by the Earl of Derby:
* CLXV (2nd County Palatine) Brigade, RFA – A, B, C, D Batteries and BAC
* CLXIX (2nd County Palatine) Brigade, RFA – A, B, C, D Batteries and BAC
* CLXX (2nd County Palatine) Brigade, RFA – A, B, C, D Batteries and BAC

* 32nd Divisional Ammunition Column, RFA – &quot;formed at Heytesbury 10 September 1915&quot;

On arrival in France the divisional artillery was reorganised:
* CLXV – D Bty left and A (H)/CLXXI Bty became D (H) Bty on 2 May 1916
* CLXIX – D Bty left and B (H)/CLXXI Bty became D (H) Bty on 2 May 1916
* CLXX – D Bty left and C (H)/CLXXI Bty became D (H) Bty on 2 May 1916
* CLXXI – D/CLXV, D/CLXIX, and D/CLXX Btys joined and became A, B, and C; D (H) Bty remained
* V.31 Heavy Trench Mortar Bty joined 4 June 1916 
* X.31, Y.31 and Z.31 Medium Trench Mortar Btys formed 31 March 1916
The BACs were absorbed by the DAC on 2 May 1916

Further reorganisation of 31st DA occurred in August 1916 when CLXXI Brigade was broken up and the 18-pounder batteries were brought up to six guns:
* CLXV – A + 1 section A/CLXXI, B + 1 section A/CLXXI, C + 1 Section B/CLXXI, D (H) remained 4 howitzers
* CLXIX – A + 1 section C, B + 1 section C, D (H)/CLXXI joined as C (H), D (H) remained 4 howitzers; 517 (H) Bty (4 howitzers) joined from UK on 20 November 
* CLXX – A + 1 section C/CLXXI, B + 1 section C/CLXXI, C + 1 section B/CLXXI, D (H) remained 4 howitzers

CLXIX Brigade was broken up in January 1917: sections of D (H) Bty brought D (H)/CLXV and D (H)/CLXX up to six howitzers each, the remainder was distributed to various Army field brigades. V.31 Heavy and Z.31 Medium TMBs were broken up in February 1918.

==Battle Insignia==
The practice of wearing battalion specific insignia (often called battle patches) in the B.E.F. began in mid 1915 with the arrival of units of Kitchener&#x27;s Armies and was widespread after the Somme Battles of 1916. The patches shown were adopted by the division during late 1917, and were designed to a brigade scheme including a brigade sign worn by all ranks on the back, below the collar. Those signs for the 92nd and 93rd brigades indicated the battalion seniority, all brigades wore their battalion, M.G. company and T.M. battery signs at the top of both sleeves.

The Scott Hall estate is made up largely of 1930s council housing on both sides of Scott Hall Road (and streets beyond) from Buslingthorpe Lane in the south to Potternewton Lane in the north. 

==Location and facilities==
The A61 road between Leeds and Harrogate is the main thoroughfare known as Scott Hall Road, served by First buses 7/7A/7S. On this road, just north of Potternewton Lane in Miles Hill there are shops and the Scott Hall Leisure (sports) Centre which was refurbished at a cost of £500,000 in 2009. Scott Hall Church, formerly Scott Hall Christian Fellowship and Hope Hall, is an Evangelical fellowship. There is a guided bus route along Scott Hall Road, which has given rise to some controversy. Scott Hall Oval is used by the Caribbean Cricket Club. Part of the Leeds Half Marathon course goes through Scott Hall Road.

==History==
The sports field at the junction between Scott Hall Road and Potternewton Lane used to be part of Scott Hall Farm. The farmhouse itself, on Scott Hall Street, is a Grade II listed building but was on the Heritage at Risk list, being described as &quot;vulnerable through neglect and decay&quot; in 2009. Bronte House (now flats) is a large building originally for single women, built in the 1930s at the junction of Buslingthorpe Lane and Scott Hall Drive. The PHAB club, which assists disabled people to enjoy life alongside able-bodied friends, started at the Prince Philip Centre in Scott Hall Avenue in 1970.

Two of the Yorkshire Ripper&#x27;s victims lived just a few doors from each other in Scott Hall Avenue. They were his first victim, Wilma McCann, and his fifth, Jayne MacDonald.

<doc id="925810" wikidata="Q340742" url="?curid=925810" title="Axial Age">
<text>Axial Age (also Axis Age, from the German ) is a term coined by the German philosopher Karl Jaspers. It refers to broad changes in religious and philosophical thought that occurred in a variety of locations from about the 8th to the 3rd century BCE.

According to Jaspers, during this period, universalizing modes of thought appeared in Persia, India, China, the Levant, and the Greco-Roman world, in a striking parallel development, without any obvious admixture between these disparate cultures. Jaspers identified key thinkers from this age who had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. 

The historical validity of the Axial Age is disputed. Some criticisms of Jaspers include the lack of a demonstrable common denominator between the intellectual developments that are supposed to have emerged in unison across ancient Greece, the Levant, India, and China; lack of any radical discontinuity with &quot;preaxial&quot; and &quot;postaxial&quot; periods; and exclusion of pivotal figures that do not fit the definition (for example, Jesus, Muhammad, and Akhenaten). 

Despite these criticisms, the Axial Age continues to be an influential idea, with many scholars accepting that profound changes in religious and philosophical discourse did indeed take place but disagreeing as to the underlying reasons. To quote Robert Bellah and Hans Joas, &quot;The notion that in significant parts of Eurasia the middle centuries of the first millennium BCE mark a significant transition in human cultural history, and that this period can be referred to as the Axial Age, has become widely, but not universally, accepted.&quot;

==Origin of the idea of Axial Age==
Jaspers introduced the concept of an Axial Age in his book (&quot;The Origin and Goal of History&quot;), published in 1949. The simultaneous appearance of thinkers and philosophers in different areas of the world had been remarked by numerous authors since the 18th century, notably by the French Indologist Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron. Jaspers explicitly cited some of these authors, including Victor von Strauß (1859) and Ernst von Lasaulx (1870). He was unaware of the first fully nuanced theory from 1873 by John Stuart Stuart-Glennie, forgotten by Jaspers&#x27; time, and which Stuart-Glennie termed &quot;the moral revolution&quot;. Stuart-Glennie and Jaspers both claimed that the Axial Age should be viewed as an objective empirical fact of history, independently of religious considerations. Jaspers argued that during the Axial Age, &quot;the spiritual foundations of humanity were laid simultaneously and independently in China, India, Persia, Judea, and Greece. And these are the foundations upon which humanity still subsists today.&quot;

Jaspers identified a number of key thinkers as having had a profound influence on future philosophies and religions, and identified characteristics common to each area from which those thinkers emerged. Jaspers held up this age as unique and one to which the rest of the history of human thought might be compared.

==Characteristics==
Jaspers presented his first outline of the Axial age by a series of examples:

Jaspers described the Axial Age as &quot;an interregnum between two ages of great empire, a pause for liberty, a deep breath bringing the most lucid consciousness&quot;. It has also been suggested that the Axial Age was a historically liminal period, when &quot;old certainties had lost their validity and new ones were still not ready&quot;.

Jaspers had a particular interest in the similarities in circumstance and thought of its figures. Similarities included an engagement in the quest for human meaning and the rise of a new élite class of religious leaders and thinkers in China, India and the Mediterranean.

Individual thinkers each laid spiritual foundations within a framework of a changing social environment. Jaspers argues that the characteristics appeared under similar political circumstances: China, India, the Middle East and the Occident each comprised multiple small states engaged in internal and external struggles. The three regions all gave birth to, and then institutionalized, a tradition of travelling scholars,
who roamed from city to city to exchange ideas. After the Spring and Autumn period (8th to 5th centuries BCE) and the Warring States period (5th to 3rd centuries BCE), Taoism and Confucianism emerged in China. In other regions, the scholars largely developed extant religious traditions; in India, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism; in Persia, Zoroastrianism; in the Levant, Judaism; and in Greece, Sophism and other classical philosophies.

Many of the cultures of the Axial Age have been considered second-generation societies because they developed on the basis of societies which preceded them.

==Thinkers and movements==
In China, the Hundred Schools of Thought (c. 6th century BCE) were in contention and Confucianism and Taoism arose during this era, and in this area it remains a profound influence on social and religious life.

Zoroastrianism, another of Jaspers&#x27; examples, is one of the first monotheistic religions. William W. Malandra and R. C. Zaehner, suggest that Zoroaster may indeed have been an early contemporary of Cyrus the Great living around 550 BCE. Mary Boyce and other leading scholars who once supported much earlier dates for Zarathustra/Zoroaster have recently changed their position on when he likely lived, so that there is an emerging consensus regarding him as a contemporary or near-contemporary of Cyrus the Great.

Jainism propagated the religion of sramanas (previous Tirthankaras) and influenced Indian philosophy by propounding the principles of ahimsa (non-violence), karma, samsara, and asceticism. Mahavira (24th Tirthankara in the 5th century BCE), known as a fordmaker of Jainism and a contemporary with the Buddha, lived during this age.

Buddhism, also of the sramana tradition of India, was another of the world&#x27;s most influential philosophies, founded by Siddhartha Gautama, or the Buddha, who lived c. 5th century BCE; its spread was aided by Ashoka, who lived late in the period.

Rabbinic Judaism accounts for its hard shift away from idolatry/polytheism (which was more common among Biblical Israelites) by mythologizing the eradication of the Evil Inclination for idolatry which was said to occur in the early Second Temple period. It has been argued that this development in monotheism relates to the axial shifts described by Jaspers. 

Jaspers&#x27; axial shifts included the rise of Platonism (c. 4th century BCE) and Neoplatonism (3rd century AD), which would later become a major influence on the Western world through both Christianity and secular thought throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance.

==Reception==
In addition to Jaspers, the philosopher Eric Voegelin referred to this age as &quot;The Great Leap of Being&quot;, constituting a new spiritual awakening and a shift of perception from societal to individual values. Thinkers and teachers like the Buddha, Pythagoras, Heraclitus, Parmenides, and Anaxagoras contributed to such awakenings which Plato would later call &quot;anamnesis&quot;, or a remembering of things forgotten.

David Christian notes that the first &quot;universal religions&quot; appeared in the age of the first universal empires and of the first all-encompassing trading networks. 

Anthropologist David Graeber has pointed out that &quot;the core period of Jasper&#x27;s Axial age ... corresponds almost exactly to the period in which coinage was invented. What&#x27;s more, the three parts of the world where coins were first invented were also the very parts of the world where those sages lived; in fact, they became the epicenters of Axial Age religious and philosophical creativity.&quot; Drawing on the work of classicist Richard Seaford and literary theorist Marc Shell on the relation between coinage and early Greek thought, Graeber argues that an understanding of the rise of markets is necessary to grasp the context in which the religious and philosophical insights of the Axial Age arose. The ultimate effect of the introduction of coinage was, he argues, an &quot;ideal division of spheres of human activity that endures to this day: on the one hand the market, on the other, religion&quot;.

German sociologist Max Weber played an important role in Jaspers&#x27; thinking. Shmuel Eisenstadt argues in the introduction to &quot;The Origins and Diversity of Axial Age Civilizations&quot; that Weber&#x27;s work in his &quot;The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism&quot;, &quot;The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism&quot; and &quot;Ancient Judaism&quot; provided a background for the importance of the period, and notes parallels with Eric Voegelin&#x27;s &quot;Order and History&quot;. In the same book, Shmuel Eisenstadt analyses economic circumstances relating to the coming of the Axial Age in Greece.

Wider acknowledgement of Jaspers&#x27; work came after it was presented at a conference and published in &quot;Daedalus&quot; in 1975, and Jaspers&#x27; suggestion that the period was uniquely transformative generated important discussion among other scholars, such as Johann Arnason. Religious historian Karen Armstrong explored the period in her book &quot;The Great Transformation&quot;, and the theory has been the focus of numerous academic conferences. In literature, Gore Vidal in his novel &quot;Creation&quot; covers much of this Axial Age through the fictional perspective of a Persian adventurer.

Usage of the term has expanded beyond Jaspers&#x27; original formulation. Yves Lambert argues that the Enlightenment was a Second Axial Age, including thinkers such as Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein, wherein relationships between religion, secularism, and traditional thought are changing. A collective &quot;History of the Axial Age&quot; has been published in 2019: generally the authors contested the existence of an &quot;identifiable Axial Age confined to a few Eurasian hotspots in the last millennium BCE&quot; but tended to accept “axiality” as a cluster of traits emerging time and again whenever societies reached a certain threshold of scale and level of complexity.

Besides time, usage of the term has expanded beyond the original field. A philosopher, Jaspers focused on philosophical development of the Age. Historians Hermann Kulke and Max Ostrovsky demonstrated that the Age is even more Axial in historical and geopolitical senses. Jaspers, in fact, noted the tip of the iceberg. Pre-Axial cultures, he wrote, were dominated by the river valley civilizations while by the end of the Axial Age rose universal empires which dominated history for centuries since. With the researches of Kulke and Ostrovsky the whole iceberg emerged. Universal empires did not come by the end of the Axial Age. The first of them, Persia came at the peak of the Axial Age and conquered Mesopotamia and Egypt. Both ceased to be civilizations in themselves and became provinces in a completely new form of imperial system which stretched from India to Greece. Thus the Bronze Age civilizations were succeeded by Axial civilizations with their universal empires. Before forming another universal empire, the Chinese civilization expanded at the peak of the Axial Age, turning the original core into &quot;Country in the Middle&quot; (Chung-kuo). The new geopolitical setting of China changed less in the following two millennia than it did in the Axial Age. The Axial Age formed two major geopolitical systems, a wider China and a much vaster Indo-Mediterranean system. The two were separated from each other by Tibet which limited their political and military contacts but both systems were linked by the Silk Road creating a trans-Eurasian trade belt stretching from the Pacific to the Atlantic. 

Several scholars supposed ecological prime trigger for the rise of this Axial belt Stephen Sanderson researched religious evolution in the Axial Age, arguing that religions and religious change in general are essentially biosocial adaptations to changing environments. Ostrovsky suggests increased fertility in the rainy zones of the Eurasian temperate belt. He regards the Axial belt of civilizations as the embryo of the present Global North. It shifted northward during the Middle Ages due to climatic change and after the Seafaring Revolution penetrated to the temperate North America. &quot;But from historical point of view, it is the same imperial belt which first appeared in the Axial Age.&quot;

The validity of the concept has been called into question. In 2006 Diarmaid MacCulloch called the Jaspers thesis &quot;a baggy monster, which tries to bundle up all sorts of diversities over four very different civilisations, only two of which had much contact with each other during the six centuries that (after adjustments) he eventually singled out, between 800 and 200 BCE&quot;. Jaspers himself had already noted this on page 2 of &quot;The Origin and Goal of History&quot;, where he says that one of the puzzles of the Axial Age is precisely that of a similar phenomenon simultaneously occurring in three civilizations which had no contact with each other. In 2013, another comprehensive critique appears in Iain Provan&#x27;s book &quot;Convenient Myths: The Axial Age, Dark Green Religion, and the World That Never Was&quot;.

<text>Gipton is a suburb of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, between the A58 to the north and the A64 to the south.

It is in the Gipton and Harehills ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds East parliamentary constituency. The separate area and woodland of Gipton Wood is in Oakwood, north of Harehills and part of the Roundhay ward. Gipton’s residents are known as Giptonites. 

==Etymology==
The name of Gipton comes from Old English, and is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086 in the forms &quot;Chipetun&quot;, &quot;Cipetun&quot; and &quot;Chiperton&quot;. The first element is a personal name, &quot;Gippe&quot;, and the second is the word &quot;tūn&quot; (&#x27;village, estate, farm&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;Gippe&#x27;s estate&#x27;.

The name &quot;Coldcotes&quot; appears in many street names in the area and derives from the ancient Anglo-Saxon settlement of the same name that was likely destroyed in the Harrying of the North.

The estate has been light-heartedly referred to by people in Leeds as &quot;Corned Beef Island&quot;.

==History==
The 1817 village was west of the place now called Gipton and contained the Gipton Spa, a bathhouse in what is now Gledhow Valley Woods.

=== Gipton Pit ===
The area of east Leeds from Burmantofts and Harehills to Killingbeck, Seacroft, Manston and Crossgates has a history of mining for coal, ironstone and fireclay, with a large number of pits. Gipton Pit and the railway serving it opened around 1891/92. It was owned by the Low Moor Coal and Iron Company of Bradford who held extensive mineral leases in the Harehills area. The original lease was for 40 years and covered the extraction of coal and ironstone under land at Potter Newton and Coldcotes. In 1896, the lease was renewed for another 40 years. The pit was sunk in wooded farmland between Harehills Lane and Oakwood Lane. The Low Moor Colliery Railway that linked Gipton Pit with the coal staithes on Harehills Lane can be traced for much of its original length. At the eastern end of the railway, the pit head buildings, with winding gear, two shafts and railway sidings were just north of where Thorn Mount and Thorn Walk meet. The pit was taken over by the Harehills Colliery Company in circa 1898 and closed in 1921. Much of the spoil heaps have been removed. The only remaining heap has recently been levelled and a new housing estate built.

=== Gipton Estate ===

The creation of the Gipton housing estate can be traced to the work of Charles Jenkinson, the vicar of Holbeck, a poor city-centre parish. Jenkinson was familiar with the poor housing conditions of his parishioners and was determined to alleviate them. His chance came in 1933 after the Labour Party won the municipal elections and set up a Housing Committee to oversee his programme and appointed him chair. Work began on the Gipton estate in April 1934 and involved the construction of a &quot;garden suburb&quot; for the working classes with 2,750 houses with accommodation for around 13,000 people. The project took two years including two roads, one 150 feet wide and the other 125 feet wide with tram tracks in the centre and grass verges at the side. The tracks linked the estate to the city centre. A shopping centre with 40 shops was at the heart of the estate and secondary shopping centres were built at other points. Sites were reserved for churches, schools, playing fields, medical practitioners, dentists, and other public facilities. The scheme would cost £12 million. When complete the estate took on a character which, while not specific to the final plan, remains fundamentally unchanged today.

===Redevelopment===
In the 2000s houses in some areas were demolished and replaced by a mixture of private and public housing. These included parts of the north of the estate around Amberton Road, Amberton Terrace and Amberton Close as well as parts of the south of the estate around Brander Road and Greenview Mount. The streets to the south of the estate to be demolished had suffered from vacation, neglect and arson prior to demolition.

==Religious architecture==

=== Church of the Epiphany ===
The Church of the Epiphany at the junction of Amberton Road and Beech Lane was constructed in 1936–38 with plans that were prepared by N.F. Cachemaille-Day, and is a Grade I listed building. The Epiphany was built by Armitage Hodgson of Leeds, with the foundation stone being laid on 12 July 1937. The church was consecrated by Geoffrey Lunt, Bishop of Ripon, on 14 May 1938 in the presence of Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood. The full title of the church is &quot;The Bishop Burroughs (of Ripon) Memorial Church&quot;, but it is never used.

=== Church of St Nicholas ===

Work began on the Church hall in 1938 when 10 acres of land was purchased from Leeds Corporation at the cost of £6,766. 11s.7d by Holdright. The hall hosted dances, whist drives, parties, meetings and jumble sales. They were staged to raise funds to provide St Nicholas&#x27; Church and school. Holdright moved to St Stephen&#x27;s, Skipton and was succeeded as parish priest by Herbert Backhouse who pursued the same course. Their efforts were realised when the third parish priest, Frank O&#x27;Driscoll, was given the &quot;go-ahead&quot;. The £74,000 church was opened on 26 July 1961 by George Dwyer, Bishop of Leeds. The church seats 550 and the opening was marked by the celebration of Pontifical High Mass. The fabric cost £58,000 and the furnishings £16,000. There is a high campanile over the baptistery. On top is an illuminated cross which can be seen from the surrounding hillsides. The church is part of Blessed Edmund Sykes parish.

=== Gipton Methodist Church ===

Gipton Methodist Church was a small urban church on the edge of housing estates, which has now closed: its final service took place on 27 March 2022. An earlier church had been opened in May 1936: members of the church had transferred from the former Lady Lane Church in central Leeds and retained the name of &quot;Lady Lane Methodist Church&quot;.

Gipton Methodist Church was part of a local Anglican-Methodist Covenant arrangement with the Church of the Epiphany, which held shared joint Lent and Advent groups and services and Songs of Praise services, together with parishioners from St Nicholas RC Church.

<text>AZN Television (formerly called International Channel) was a cable TV channel which promoted itself as &quot;the network for Asian America&quot;. It was run by International Networks, a wholly owned subsidiary of Comcast Corporation. The channel&#x27;s programming targeted the fast-growing, young, affluent, English-speaking Asian-American community. Genres included the most popular Asian films, dramas, documentaries and music as well as a diverse slate of original programming. It competed in certain markets with ImaginAsian Television.

==History==
The channel was launched as the International Channel in 1990, and was initially owned by a joint venture of Liberty Media (which had a 90% stake) and JJS II Communications, LLC (which had the remaining 10% stake). In 1996, the two companies founded the International Cable Channels Partnership, Ltd., which oversaw the channel. The channel was sold to Comcast when it purchased its parent company, International Networks (now International Media Distribution) in July 2004.
In March 2005, Comcast rebranded and refocused the International Channel to AZN Television, which now focused purely on Asian and Asian-American culture.
In late 2005, news of mass layoffs at the network prompted fears that Comcast would shut down AZN. However, the network remained on the air and continued to sponsor the annual Asian Excellence Awards, which highlights Asian American achievement in film and television. In January 2008, Comcast announced it would be shutting down AZN and moving the Asian Excellence Awards show to E! The channel went off the air on April 9, 2008, at noon. The network was shut down as foreign language tiers with international networks, which have their own charges and feature content on networks International Channel struggled to balance onto a 168-hour weekly schedule, became much more popular, cost-effective, and had better quality controls, and more importantly, had programming originated on their own domestic networks.

<text>Békés (; ; ) is a town in Békés County, Hungary. It lies about north of Békéscsaba and east of Budapest.

== History ==
The area of the present town has been inhabited since ancient times, due to its good soil and proximity to rivers. After the Hungarians conquered the area, Békés and its surroundings were the property of the &quot;Csolt&quot; clan. Békés (the name means &#x27;peaceful&#x27;) was originally the name of the castle which gave its name to the comitatus, and, like many castles, was possibly named after its first steward. Many documents from the 13th century prove that Békés was the county seat. After 1403, when the area became the estate of the Maróthi family, Békés slowly lost its importance and the role of the centre of the comitatus was gradually taken over by Gyula.

In 1566, the castle of Gyula was occupied by the Ottoman army, and Békés fell under Ottoman rule too. The Ottomans built a motte castle in the town, but it was destroyed in 1595 when the Ottomans had to defend Gyula against the Hungarians who tried to reclaim it. The area became deserted. It was only exactly 100 years later, in 1695, that Békés was freed from Ottoman rule.

During the freedom fight led by Prince Francis II Rákóczi in the early 18th century the area of Békés was deserted again, for the last time. In 1720 John George Harruckern was granted Békés county via Royal Deed. He gave privileges to the serfs of the area, and gradually the population grew.

By the end of the 18th century, the town already had its present five districts and the Protestant, Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches and the Jewish synagogue. The buildings of the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches and the Jewish Synagogue are all located within close proximity of each other. The annual floods of the Körös river meant a significant problem until the 1850s when the river was controlled.

In 1872, Békés was re-classified as a village. It was not until a hundred years later that it got its town status back.
Around the start of the 20th century, Békés was rapidly developing and several new buildings were built. During the World Wars, there were no significant battles in the area. Békés was freed from the Nazis on October 6, 1944. After the war, industrialization quickened. On April 15, 1973, Békés was granted town status.

Today, Békés is made of several ethnic groups, including Hungarians, Roma, and with its near proximity to the Romanian border, Romanians who constitute approximately 5% of the population.

<doc id="925826" wikidata="Q7582200" url="?curid=925826" title="Squealer (Animal Farm)">
<text>Squealer is a fictional character, a pig, in George Orwell&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. He serves as second-in-command to Napoleon and is the farm&#x27;s minister of propaganda. He is described in the book as an effective and very convincing orator and a fat porker. In the 1954 film, he is a pink Large White pig, whereas in the 1999 film, he is a Tamworth pig who wears a monocle.

== Squealer&#x27;s argument ==
Throughout the novel Squealer is very skilled at making speeches to the animals. He is also one of the leaders of the new farm. Under the rule of Napoleon, Squealer does things to manipulate all of the animals. Squealer takes the central role in making announcements to the animals, as Napoleon keeps appearing less and less often as the book progresses. Near the start of the book, it is said that he was very convincing and could turn &quot;black into white&quot;. This foreshadows several euphemisms he uses to maintain the control of the barn through difficult times. He is Napoleon&#x27;s key to propaganda for the farm.

== Breaking the commandments and telling lies ==
Throughout the book, Napoleon and Squealer broke the Seven Commandments, the tenets on which governance of the farm is based. To prevent the animals from suspecting them, Squealer preys on the animals&#x27; confusion and alters the Commandments from time to time as the need arises. Squealer falls off a ladder while trying to change one of the commandments in the night. A few days later it is discovered that Squealer was altering the commandment regarding alcohol; which suggests that he fell off the ladder because he was drunk. Orwell uses Squealer mainly to show how the increasingly totalitarian and corrupt regime uses propaganda and deceit to get its ideas accepted and implemented by the people. In the end, Squealer reduces the Seven Commandments to one commandment: &quot;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&quot;.

A point is made by Napoleon dismissing the education of the mature animals as a lost cause while Snowball attempts to educate them all (he &quot;does&quot; focus on the key ideas of Animalism, nevertheless) and starting many committees which are apparently for the good of the entire Farm — Napoleon is explicitly stated to have &#x27;no interest&#x27; in these committees, instead snatching up newborn dogs to educate them in seclusion. He takes advantage of their malleable minds and moulds them to his liking — the dogs show up later as military enforcers or secret police. As the newer generations are brought up with propaganda and the old generations are ignored, Squealer begins making changes to the Seven Commandments. The animals experience a vague feeling of unease, and when Clover and Muriel ponder the changes, they are told that they have simply forgotten. They accept this easily, helped along by the growling dogs that accompany the pigs everywhere. Benjamin alone appears to understand what is happening, though he never acts. If asked, he says that donkeys live a long time, and that &quot;none of you has ever seen a dead donkey&quot;. True to his cynical nature, he continues to believe that life never gets better. He is briefly outraged by Boxer&#x27;s death but becomes ever more cynical when Squealer again convinces the denizens of the Farm that Boxer was only taken to a hospital.

In the end, this works out to Squealer&#x27;s advantage. Terror and silver-tongued oration fool nearly everyone, and the sole animal who sees through these fronts, Benjamin, is simply too cynical to do anything.

This reflected Orwell&#x27;s view that events in Russia following the Revolution of 1917 had followed an unwelcome path, and that the egalitarian socialism he believed in had there become a brutal dictatorship built around a cult of personality and enforced by terror and lies. Orwell wrote: &quot;All people who are morally sound have known since about 1931 that the Russian régime stinks&quot;. Squealer, as the chief propagandist of the regime, is prominent in the story and Orwell defines the path down which small lies lead to bigger lies. Orwell regarded propaganda as a feature of all modern governments but especially prominent in totalitarian regimes, which depended on it. In &quot;The Prevention of Literature&quot; (1946) he described &quot;organized lying&quot; as a crucial element of totalitarian states.

<doc id="925835" wikidata="Q884563" url="?curid=925835" title="Blizzard of 1977">
<text>The blizzard of 1977 hit Western New York, Central NY, Northern NY, and Southern Ontario from January 28 to February 1 of that year. Daily peak wind gusts ranging from were recorded by the National Weather Service in Buffalo, with snowfall as high as recorded in areas, and the high winds blew this into drifts of . There were 23 total storm-related deaths in Western New York, with five more in northern New York.

Certain pre-existing weather conditions exacerbated the blizzard&#x27;s effects. November, December and January average temperatures were severely below normal. Lake Erie froze over by December 14, 1976; when this occurs, lake-effect snow does not occur because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake&#x27;s surface, convert the moisture to snow, and then dump it when the winds reach shore.

Lake Erie was covered by a deep, powdery snow; January&#x27;s unusually cold conditions limited the usual thawing and refreezing, so the snow on the frozen lake remained powdery. The drifted snow on roadways was difficult to clear because the strong wind packed the snow into a solid state. In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds and blowing snow.

In the hardest-struck areas, snowmobiles became the only viable method of transportation. In Western New York and Southern Ontario&#x27;s Niagara Peninsula, snow which was accumulated on frozen Lake Erie and snow on the ground at the start of the blizzard provided ample material for the high winds to blow into huge drifts. The combination of bitter cold, high winds, and blowing snow paralyzed areas affected by the storm. Lake Ontario rarely freezes over, which meant northern New York had to deal with considerable lake-effect snow. Coupled with the existing snow cover and wind, this had a similar effect.

==Winter of 1976–1977==
Weather conditions during the months leading up to the blizzard contributed to the disastrous storm. A high-amplitude planetary wave pattern set up, which was very persistent from October 1976 through January 1977, and involved a ridge over western North America and a trough over eastern North America. In January 1977, this pattern persisted, with the pressure of the strong ridge over western North America being more than two standard deviations from the mean, while the strong trough centered over eastern North America was more than three standard deviations from the mean.

A strong blocking high developed over the Arctic Ocean during January, and this moved the polar vortex to southern Canada, south of its normal location. Strong northwest flow between the ridge and the trough resulted in a strong northwest flow in between, which ushered Arctic air into the central and eastern United States. The circulation helped cause record cold for the winter over many portions of the eastern United States, with the Ohio Valley averaging more than below normal. The severe winter was not limited to the northeastern United States; snow was observed in Miami, Florida, on January 20, and snow mixed with rain occurred in the Bahamas. In contrast, Alaska was exceptionally mild: Anchorage averaged above normal and was in fact warmer for the month than Atlanta half the distance from the equator, whilst it was the warmest January since at least 1937 for the whole state except the North Slope and the Aleutian Islands. The Pacific Northwest, located under the strong ridge, experienced unprecedented drought, with all 29 climatic divisions of Washington, Oregon and Idaho experiencing their driest October to February period on record.

==In western New York==

===Antecedent weather===
During June through September, the Buffalo National Weather Service (NWS) office recorded of rain, which is wetter than the 1961–1990 average of . In western New York the previously described pattern resulted in snowy and cold weather in the months leading up to the blizzard. Buffalo was a city of about 463,000 people with about 1.5 million in the metropolitan area, the second most populated city in New York State.

The first trace of snow of the winter at the Buffalo NWS weather station in Cheektowaga, New York, occurred on October 9, while the first accumulating snow was on October 21. Elsewhere in western New York, lake effect snow was observed in two periods, with up to on October 17–18 and up to on October 21–22 (O&#x27;Connell 1977). By the last day of October, Lake Erie was , the coldest it had been on that date.

November&#x27;s air temperature in Buffalo was the coldest in nearly 100 years (since 1880), with an average temperature of . November&#x27;s average temperature was about below normal. The first three weeks of November were quite dry in Buffalo – only of precipitation – and November as a whole was drier than normal. During late November, some heavy snow occurred, including on November 30 – up to in southern Erie County, Buffalo&#x27;s county. The total November snowfall was recorded as in Buffalo.

December was cold and snowy, with an average temperature of . Like November, December&#x27;s average temperature was also about below normal. December&#x27;s snowfall was . Daily snow depth readings varied from , with a maximum measured snow depth of at 3:40 p.m. on December 2.

Lake Erie froze over by December 14; this was a record. An ice-covered Lake Erie usually puts an end to lake effect snowstorms, because the wind cannot pick up moisture from the lake&#x27;s surface, convert the moisture to snow and then dump it when the winds reach shore.

The wintry weather continued in January, with the monthly average temperature being , the coldest on record (records began in 1870 in Buffalo). January&#x27;s average temperature was below normal. It never rose to freezing in Buffalo that month, the first January that had occurred.

Prior to January 28, the day the blizzard started, it had snowed almost every day since just after Christmas. By January 27, Buffalo&#x27;s snow depth was . There was continuous snow cover from November 29 until the day of the blizzard, and of snow had fallen that winter prior to the blizzard – in January alone – well above normal even for a city that averages about of snowfall per year. This resulted in a snow depth of on the day the blizzard started.

Low pressure crossed Lake Erie on January 27 and moved to James Bay; it became stalled east of James Bay. Then the storm moved back west over James Bay before finally moving east to the Canadian Maritimes.

===Prelude===
Even before the blizzard hit, the Niagara Mohawk Power Company (which is now National Grid) had warned that snow was reaching the power lines in some areas of western New York. Also, on Thursday, January 27, severe natural gas shortages forced industries and schools to either curtail activities or to close. The governors of Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had also declared energy emergencies.

Early in the week of the blizzard, James Lindner, Commissioner of Street Sanitation for the City of Buffalo, estimated approximately 20% of cars in the city of Buffalo were illegally parked or abandoned, limiting the ability of snowplows to clear side streets and making many of them impassable. A concentrated effort to plow (and tow as necessary) – called the &quot;Snow Blitz&quot; by the press – managed to make significant progress on Tuesday, January 25, and Wednesday, January 26, with the help of 960 tickets and 140 tows. Even so, one source notes the side streets in Buffalo were &quot;practically impassable&quot; on Wednesday, January 26.

On Wednesday evening, snow squalls and high winds hit Wyoming, Cattaraugus, Allegany and Erie counties in western New York. This snowstorm closed the Buffalo Skyway, Fuhrmann Boulevard – a major route to the suburbs south of the city – and many other roads, and forced snow removal crews to focus on the major and secondary roads Wednesday night and Thursday. Many motorists were stranded on Fuhrmann Boulevard and were rescued by police and firefighters overnight Wednesday. The clearing of snow from this storm was made difficult by winds, which in one case on Thursday, January 27, transformed a clear road to one with drifts in less than an hour. The Greater Buffalo International Airport closed Thursday, January 27.

By late January, snow removal was hampered; 33 of the city&#x27;s 79 snow plows were in for repairs. On the afternoon of Thursday, January 27, the National Guard had been called to the region with equipment to help clear the streets of snow.

===Onset===

====Friday morning====
On Thursday, January 27, an Arctic front had swept southward through the northern Great Plains to the Midwest. Between 6:00 and 7:00 am on Friday, January 28, a wall of snow accompanied the cold front&#x27;s passage through Indianapolis, Indiana, along with a temperature drop of almost . Between 7:00 and 8:00 am, Columbus, Ohio, reported similar situations. Toledo and Cleveland, Ohio, as well as Erie, Pennsylvania, were also hit strongly by the cold front. The NWS office in Erie warned &quot;travel might be disastrous&quot;; and there were more than 500 accidents in the area that morning.

From midnight to 11:00 am, the temperature at the Buffalo airport rose from . Snow began around 5:00 am, with about of new snow prior to the beginning of the blizzard. At 4:00 am, the Buffalo NWS office indicated &quot;very strong winds will once again produce near blizzard conditions beginning late this afternoon and continuing tonight&quot;. At 11:00 am, a blizzard warning was issued, which was the first time the Buffalo NWS office had done this.

That morning observers on the 16th floor of the M&amp;T Bank Building in Buffalo watched as a gray wall covered the city; it appeared white as it came closer. A blast of wind hit the building that caused the floor to move and the glass window to creak, and then the wall of white enveloped the building. It was 11:10 am.

On the previous day, the governor of New York had decided to use the National Guard and the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) to help clean up snow in Buffalo, not knowing a blizzard would hit. Some NYSDOT equipment had arrived in Buffalo while the National Guard was not yet mobilized, but a meeting was being held at the Buffalo city garage that morning to coordinate the efforts. Before the meeting finished, Buffalo city plows started to return to the garage due to a lack of visibility; they reported they were unable to see even their own plow blades. By 11:30 am, most workers in the city of Buffalo had been released early, but few made it home. At 11:35 am, lightning was seen in the darkening sky.

The white wall of snow reached the airport around 11:30 am. associated with the cold front. Winds increased to , gusting to , with visibility dropping from to 0 where it stayed until 12:50 am the next day.

Three airplanes on the tarmac at the Greater Buffalo International Airport in Cheektowaga were waiting to take off when the blizzard hit. One of them idled for five minutes due to the blizzard hitting; this resulted in the nose wheel freezing and preventing it from turning around. It took several hours to bring the three airplanes back to the terminal since they had to do this via radio communication. The limited visibility prevented the pilots from seeing the men on the ground who would normally guide the airplane.

====Friday afternoon====

During the four hours after the blizzard hit, the temperature at the Buffalo airport (where the Buffalo office of the NWS is) fell from .

Snow built up rapidly, with bumper-high snow being reported by 1:00 pm and high drifts by nightfall in the City of Buffalo. The depth of snow quickly caused many roads to become impassable (within 30 minutes in the part of Buffalo nearest Lake Erie), and the blowing snow caused extremely low visibilities, making travel nearly impossible.

In addition to the roads becoming impassable, motorists also had to deal with vehicles breaking down due to the combination of very cold temperatures, very high winds, and blowing snow. For example, a maintenance pickup truck at the Buffalo airport had snow blasted into the engine compartment that then melted, saturated the spark plugs, and stalled the engine. A report from Welland, Ontario, (see section below for a description of the blizzard in Canada) indicated many cars overheated when snow got under the radiator, melted, and then refroze, interfering with the fan.

Those attempting to travel by foot also found travel very difficult with the high winds, low visibility, deep snow, and very low wind chills. Visibility had dropped from ; winds had increased to , with gusts up to . Pedestrians were knocked down by the wind in city streets and struggled to regain footing, so pairs of policemen pulled them into buildings. People formed human chains from the Memorial Auditorium to people stranded in cars so the motorists would not get lost trying to find shelter.

Locations west of Buffalo that were hit by the cold front only were affected for two to three hours, and western New York was thought to be the same. By 1:30 pm, Buffalo radar indicated almost no snow, and it became clear snow was being blown off frozen Lake Erie. Since the lake had frozen in December, the snow that fell had built up on the lake [recall the Buffalo airport reported of snow in January prior to the blizzard]. Lake Erie was reported to be covered by &#x27;deep, powdery snow&#x27; at the beginning of the blizzard. During January, the unusually cold conditions limited thawing and freezing, and thus the snow on the ground (and frozen lake) did not consolidate into a form that would limit drifting.

The new snow associated with the cold front and the snow that had accumulated on land and frozen Lake Erie were all blown by the strong winds and created drifts of over in metropolitan Buffalo. During the blizzard, about of &quot;new&quot; snow fell, and much of this was thought to be from snow that had been in the snowpack on Lake Erie.

The drifted snow from the blizzard was difficult to clear for reasons illuminated by NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker: &quot;The wind was so strong that it packed the snow. It broke the snow crystals up so they really packed in solidly, almost like a form of cement&quot;. As discussed later in this article, normal snow clearing methods could not be used in many cases due to the height of the drifts and the tight packing of the snow.

====Friday evening====

The worst conditions of the blizzard in Buffalo occurred during the late afternoon of Friday, January 28, as winds averaged and gusted to 60 knots [] with wind chills of (NWS pre-2001 wind chill calculation method).

That night people stayed in whatever shelter they could find, with 700 people staying in the Donovan State Office Building, 200 in the Rath Building, 300 in the Memorial Auditorium, etc. Authorities estimated 13,000 people were stranded Friday night in downtown Buffalo and that many in the surrounding areas as well — e.g. 1,700 at Bell Aerosystems in Wheatfield, 2,500 at Harrison Radiator Company in Lockport.

With many roads becoming impassable, the City of Buffalo police were almost immobile by Friday evening. Through radio and television, citizens were asked to loan snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles to the Buffalo police; police used them to answer calls. Looting broke out and items stolen included radios and firefighters&#x27; clothing from fire trucks, as well as more than $1,500 in medical supplies from a stuck ambulance. Cigarettes, liquor, beer, coffee, meat and refrigerators were stolen from abandoned semi-trailer trucks. There was also looting from factories, stores (including two jewelry stores and a furniture/appliance store) and homes. Nearly 100 people were arrested for looting.

A fire broke out at Whitney Place and Virginia Street, in the City of Buffalo, on Friday evening. Fire trucks rammed through stalled cars in an attempt to get to the scene and fire hoses were stretched two to three blocks to reach the fire, as that is as far as the fire trucks were able to make it. The National Guard assisted in taking firemen to the scene in four-wheel drive vehicles.

Not only did the weather frustrate efforts to reach the scene, but also it hampered the ability to fight the fire. Attempts to disconnect hoses to move them resulted in the water freezing and bursting the hoses. Since the street drains were blocked with snow, runoff water from the fire rose to the running boards on the fire department&#x27;s pumpers. When this water froze, it required jackhammers to extricate the pumpers. Hoses also had to be removed with jackhammers. Some fire truck pumpers stalled in the snow when wind blew into the engines or they ran out of fuel. Since their design necessitated the use of water instead of antifreeze as a coolant, the water in the pumper froze and ruined them.

The fire was eventually extinguished, but not before six or seven houses were destroyed and 50 people left homeless. Virginia Street and Whitney Place were closed for more than two weeks following the fire due to vehicles stuck in the ice. Firemen used snowmobiles to rescue trapped people, and to transport nurses and doctors to the hospitals; they also used four-wheel drive vehicles to deliver medicine.

On Friday, volunteers on four-wheel drive vehicles and snowmobiles delivered food (a few thousand dollars worth every 45 minutes) for the Salvation Army from their Buffalo headquarters. The Red Cross opened eight shelters in Erie County, New York, on Friday, and snowmobile clubs provided volunteers to deliver food, blood and medicine. Snowmobiles were also used to rescue people from the Skyway, as well as from another expressway.

===Duration and cleanup===

====Saturday, January 29====

By midnight Friday, an estimated 2,000 cars were stranded on Main Street and about 8,000 on other streets in the City of Buffalo. By Saturday morning, visibility improved and the City sent their plows back out. The many abandoned cars made their job more difficult. By 6:00 am, Buffalo&#x27;s Commissioner of Street Sanitation had 30 private tow trucks removing vehicles; later in the day, the number would rise to 50. Saturday afternoon, dump trucks and payloaders dumped snow into the Niagara River.

On Saturday, blizzard conditions prevailed and the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; did not publish for the first time in its 143-year history, and &quot;The Buffalo Evening News&quot; published only 10,000 copies. On Friday, January 28, New York State Governor Hugh L. Carey requested that portions of New York State be declared a major disaster area; on Saturday, President Jimmy Carter declared an &quot;emergency&quot; for all of New York and Pennsylvania that resulted in a declaration of emergency specifically for the western New York counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, and Niagara. At 11:10 am, during a short break in the storm, a National Guard C-130 was able to land at the Buffalo Airport.

A record low for the date, was set, breaking the old record set in 1885, and a peak wind gust of was recorded. During midafternoon, the lull in the storm ended and the winds once again blew strong, causing new drifting. The storm continued; the low-pressure center with which the cold front was associated stalled east of James Bay and then &quot;moved back west over James Bay before finally moving east to the Canadian Maritimes&quot;.

====Sunday, January 30====

Early Sunday morning, the wind and snow decreased somewhat and the sun was seen at times. Buffalo city plows and NYSDOT equipment were able to open several major roads (Main, Broadway, Michigan, Sycamore, Walden, Fillmore, Ohio, and much of South Park and Delaware).

President Carter appointed Federal Disaster Assistance Administration Region II (Northeast) Director, Thomas Casey, as the federal coordinating officer in charge of the U.S. federal government response to the blizzard; Casey arrived with New York Governor Hugh Carey at the Buffalo airport in a C-130 at noon Sunday. With the weather clearing and single lanes cleared on some roads, many sightseers drove into Buffalo. At 3:00 pm, the wind increased and blowing snow once again decreased visibility such that driving became treacherous. Hundreds were stranded anew and their abandoned cars blocked roads that had been cleared. A peak gust of was recorded at the Buffalo airport (NWS Buffalo Office 2006a) and that night the wind chill fell to (NWS pre-2001 wind chill calculation method).

At 8:00 pm, the National Guardsmen, in their cold-weather gear, began assisting the City of Buffalo Street Sanitation Department with clearing roads to Buffalo hospitals. Since Friday afternoon, walking multiple blocks had been necessary to reach most hospitals. Before the end of the storm, over 500 National Guardsmen were helping in the disaster.

By evening, some areas of western New York had, along with banning traffic, also banned snowmobiles; a snowmobiler was injured in a collision with a chimney on top of a house, and others had come dangerously close to power lines due to the high drifts. In Newstead approximately drifts led to the suspension of even emergency snowmobile traffic due to the power line danger.

====Monday, January 31====

Many towns in western New York banned unnecessary travel for several days. Driving bans during the storm were imposed in the cities of Niagara Falls and Buffalo, Niagara County, and many other locations. Most roads in Cheektowaga were closed by snow overnight Sunday, and the fire department was &quot;checking houses snow-covered to their roofs to make sure nobody was freezing or suffocating&quot;. The supervisor of the Town of Clarence, in addition to ordering all motorists ticketed, authorized the fire department to seize gasoline to prevent driving, if necessary. In Lancaster, only two north–south routes were open. An early Sunday morning helicopter tour by Erie County Sheriff Ken Braun had revealed about 125 cars and trucks almost totally buried in the Lancaster area, as well as a young man leaning against a street light strung across an intersection. Some towns were using metal detectors to locate buried cars before using heavy equipment to clear the snow.

Light snow fell throughout Monday, with variable winds gusting at times to more than with a peak gust of at the Buffalo airport. Only 20 of the usual 400 Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority buses were running, and those were reserved for necessary travel. From when the blizzard struck Friday until Monday, there were no intercity bus, Amtrak train and commercial air services to Buffalo. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) had been brought in by the Federal Disaster Assistance Administration to assist in the cleanup effort; they received a mission statement on Sunday for emergency snow removal. The USACE named their effort &quot;Operation Snow Go 1977&quot;, and got their first contractor to start clearing snow on Monday. Three hundred U.S. Army soldiers from an engineer battalion at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, joined the effort.

During Monday night, police continued searching vehicles stranded since Friday, and the wind increased again to .

====Next seven days====

On Tuesday, February 1, Buffalo Mayor Makowski declared a state of emergency that prohibited nonessential travel. Violation of the travel ban could potentially result in a US$500 fine and 90 days in jail, which was sufficient to limit the number of people ticketed to 97. Following a Monday request by New York Governor Carey, on Tuesday, Tom Casey added Orleans, Genesee, and Wyoming counties in western New York and Jefferson and Lewis counties in northern New York to the emergency declaration. On Tuesday afternoon, the winds diminished to about , and the sun came out.

On Wednesday, February 2, there was also occasional sun. Mail service resumed in the City of Buffalo with the help of six four-wheel drive trucks brought in from Rochester, the first mail delivery since the previous Friday. Fuhrmann Boulevard was cleared, allowing workers trapped at the Freezer Queen plant since Friday to leave, and freeing Coast Guard personnel trapped behind drifts at the end of the road, who had been stranded by the snow the night before the blizzard (Thursday, January 27). In addition, many major roads in the city were completely cleared Wednesday, including South Park Avenue, Delaware and Tupper.

Thursday morning, February 3, Mayor Makowski lifted the travel ban without consulting state or federal officials, and many people drove into Buffalo. They found the parking lots were not cleared, so left their cars in the roads. This turned many four-lane roads into two-lane roads. The NWS had forecast snow for Thursday, and the new snow arrived accompanied by winds, resulting in near-zero visibility and some areas claiming worse conditions than the previous Friday when the blizzard initially struck. A state of emergency continued or was declared in additional areas, including Alden, Brant, Evans, Lancaster, Newstead, North Collins, Wales, and West Seneca. Many roads in southern Erie County, as well as Niagara, Chautauqua, and Wyoming counties, were drifted shut. At midnight Thursday, Buffalo&#x27;s driving ban was put back in place.

Under pressure from many levels of elected government officials to declare blizzard-affected regions major disaster areas, President Carter sent his son, James Earl (Chip) Carter, and special presidential advisor, Margaret Costanza, to survey the situation on Friday, February 4; the visit included traveling to Buffalo, Lancaster and Cheektowaga.

On Saturday, President Carter declared the counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming in western New York, and the counties of Jefferson and Lewis in northern New York, a major disaster area; this is the first time a snowstorm was declared a federal disaster area. The previous emergency declaration had resulted in the federal government only assisting in snow removal, whereas the major disaster declaration caused the federal government assistance to be &quot;expanded to include everything to protect life and property and to provide whatever materials and equipment that were required to relieve the emergency and restore the area to normalcy&quot;. The declaration also allowed the local governments to deal directly with private contractors and be reimbursed by the federal government instead of the USACE employing private contractors.

On Friday morning, February 4, the NWS had forecast that early Saturday a storm would hit with about ) of new snow accompanied by strong winds, but the storm did not strike Buffalo. That weekend the Winter Carnival in Buffalo was postponed for the third time due to the too-wintry weather.

On Monday, February 7, the driving ban that had been in place since February 3 was lifted at midnight. Cars were required to have at least three people in them and a citywide speed limit of was enacted. That Monday, at least 100 residents of Concord (Erie County), New York were still isolated Many colleges and schools in western New York reopened that day, after having been closed since Thursday, January 27, seven consecutive snow days.

Since the local governments were now able to be directly reimbursed by the federal government for contracting with companies for snow removal, the USACE was not assigned further work as of February 8; they finished work in progress and completed their contracting efforts on February 13. The coordinator of the federal disaster relief, Casey, pulled out the Fort Bragg troops on February 8. By February 9, the City of Buffalo had signed agreements with private firms to finish the snow removal, a task that would take nine more days.

The temperature rose above freezing for the first time since Christmas on February 9, with a high of . The Buffalo mayor also lifted the rule requiring at least three people per car between the hours of 7:00 pm and 6:00 am. The next day, it rose to and then made it to about the next three days. On February 11, Mayor Makowski lifted the driving ban at noon, but the citywide speed limit remained in effect. Buffalo city schools reopened on February 14, after more than 10 consecutive snow days. One school remained open through the blizzard. The Gow School, a residential school in South Wales, NY. Food supplies began to dwindle by Monday, January 31, and so the school&#x27;s food services had to negotiate with the army for helicopter delivery since the school&#x27;s own trucks were immobilized by the storm.

===Aftermath===
The high winds of the blizzard packed the snow so tightly and high, drifts reached in places; normal snow removal equipment was ineffective, and earth-moving equipment, such as front-end loaders, had to be used. Colonel Daniel Ludwig of the USACE stated the &quot;snow was very densely packed and that snow plows would be virtually useless on most of the roads&quot;. NWS meteorologist Ben Kolker noted on one of the roads near the NWS forecast office, high lifts were used &quot;to dig away at it and break it up like big hunks of rock&quot;. In Depew, a suburb of Buffalo, volunteer firemen used a trenching machine to get people out of a house that had been drifted shut. The long cleanup period included the railroads, who used front-end loaders to clear snow from the rail yard into open-bodied rail cars and shipped it east by Conrail.

Sixteen of 25 towns in Erie County, as well as the City of Buffalo, declared states of emergency and banned all nonessential traffic at some time during the storm. The USACE normal work force, plus personnel from other USACE installations, resulted in a total of 353 USACE personnel working on the recovery effort. The USACE Buffalo District overall effort (including both western and northern New York) reported $6.8 million used in paying 216 private contractors to plow 3,186 miles of road in 9 counties using about 1,000 pieces of equipment and US$700,000 of in-house costs. Other military assistance included 500 National Guard troops, 320 U. S. Army Airborne troops, the 20th Engineer Brigade from Fort Bragg, 65–70 U.S. Marines, as well as assistance from the U.S. Air Force. The National Guard operation was entitled &quot;Task Force Western&quot;, with headquarters at the Connecticut Street Armory in Buffalo, and included providing 9–10 Army-type ambulances along with operators for use in the City of Buffalo when almost no normal ambulances were able to operate.

The Salvation Army fed between 67,000 and 176,000 people, provided clothing for about 4,500, and housed 851, for a cost of US$75,000 to US$150,000, using 1,000 volunteers and over 400 snowmobiles. A Salvation Army official noted the disaster was unique in that &quot;it covered 9 counties and nobody could get in&quot;. The American Red Cross distributed 5 tons (4500 kg) of food at 84–92 locations, feeding about 50,000 people.

The total snowfall for Buffalo during the storm was only (Port Colborne in Ontario received . The blizzard was made unique by the sustained winds, gusting up to , which picked up the snowdrifts piled on the frozen Lake Erie and dumped that snow load in western New York and southern Ontario. The winds were accompanied by Arctic-cold temperatures, making it feel like outside Whiteout conditions had trapped people at work, in cars and in homes; some had to stay for a day, while others had to stay for the storm&#x27;s duration. At the Buffalo zoo, drifts allowed three reindeer to walk over their fence and wander about the city; also, over 20 animals died during the storm.

There were 23 total storm-related deaths in western New York, with 11 in the City of Buffalo, plus seven more in the rest of Erie County, three in Wyoming County, and one each in both Niagara and Orleans counties. At least nine were found buried in cars, while others involved heart attacks while shoveling snow, and car accidents. The above-stated death tolls are listed in the USACE report on cleanup efforts in the storm, while a slightly different death toll is listed by the NWS on their Blizzard of 1977 webpage, which indicates 29 deaths resulted from the storm. The Buffalo Area Chamber of Commerce estimated a total economic loss for Erie and Niagara counties combined of US$221,490,000 for the 5.5-day period starting on January 28, with 175,000 people losing wages of US$36,250,000. An estimated $20 million or more was spent removing snow, with USACE alone spending over $6 million on contractors in western New York. Total damage reached $300 million. For 11 days, national media showed images of a city covered in snow up to roofs of houses.

Equipment from Colorado, New York City and Toronto, among others, was used in the cleanup of snow. Abandoned vehicles were towed to designated parking areas, and the snow was hauled to dump areas where some remained until early May. Although March was 8 °F (4.5 °C) above normal, the snow melted gradually, so there were no significant flooding problems.

==Southern Ontario==
The entire Niagara Peninsula of Southern Ontario was significantly impacted by the blizzard, although the southern parts of the Peninsula across the Niagara River from Buffalo and extending westward along the northern edge of the frozen, snow-covered Lake Erie were hit the hardest. This was indicated by reports that the worst conditions were limited to closer to the lakeshore than in western New York. For example, compare reports in that conditions were much better inland and reports in from a military commander noting an airborne view made it clear the worst was right along the shore, with reports from western New York with snow near street-light level in well-inland Lancaster. The hardest hit coastal communities included Fort Erie, Port Colborne and Wainfleet. Areas of Southern Ontario as far away as London to the west, Kitchener to the northwest, and Toronto to the northeast also experienced high winds and blowing snow, particularly on January 28.

As with western New York, the southern Niagara Peninsula had experienced a significant amount of snowfall prior to the blizzard commencing on Friday, January 28. Port Colborne had received since Christmas and Fort Erie had gotten since Christmas, with and of Fort Erie&#x27;s amount having fallen on January 26 and 27, and and of Port Colborne&#x27;s having arrived those days.

As stated previously, the storm, with consistent winds of 70 km/h and gusts of 100 to 120 km/h, struck suddenly late in the morning Friday, January 28. The resultant blowing snow causing zero visibility and drifting snow making roads impassable causing many vehicles becoming stuck in the snow, causing their occupants to abandon them. That day of additional snow fell in the Port Colborne-Wainfleet area. That night, 250 people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne. Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight on January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students total were stranded in the Niagara region altogether). On Saturday, January 29, more snow was deposited in Port Colbourne-Wainfleet area and the high winds continued to cause blizzard conditions and high drifts of snow. That night, at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne. On Sunday, a day when the winds decreased until the mid-afternoon but an additional of snow fell, the remaining students were taken from the schools with the help of the militia; some students were housed in nearby houses. In some areas, buses had become stranded trying to take children home from school Friday, so bus drivers had taken the children to nearby houses. On Monday, January 31 a further of snow fell in Port Colborne and windy conditions caused more blowing snow and higher snow drifts. Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported.

The Long Beach and the Lowbanks areas of Wainfleet were very strongly affected by the storm. In Wainfleet, one resident reported early in the storm the wind broke a window facing the lake and snow rapidly began drifting in the house, which caused significant damage. In the Lowbanks area, a resident reported the storm smashed in windows and collapsed doors; they had lost power and heat and were burning furniture in the fireplace to keep warm. Ontario Hydro noted some power outages lasted 72 hours; it took an average of 24 hours to get power restored for some larger customers. The depth of drifts in the hardest hit areas was extreme. Snowmobilers reported passing over vehicles, as well as onto the roof of a house, without knowing it, and snowmobiling over the top of a school bus without being able to see its roof. In the Long Beach area, snow reached the power lines, with people stepping over and rolling under them, and only the chimneys of houses were visible above the snow. Along the lakeshore in Wainfleet, the mayor reported drifts up to , and in Lowbanks, a military officer reported drifts of with only the steeple of a church visible. One drift estimated at remained until June 1, while snow banks reportedly lasted until the first week of June in the Cedar Bay area.

Snowmobiles were widely used to deliver aid and provide transportation. Niagara Regional Police Service enlisted the help of 60 snowmobiles and 15 four-wheel drive vehicles for use for regular police calls, as well as to deliver food and medication. Snowmobiles were also used to transport doctors and nurses, and Ontario Hydro workers. In Fort Erie, where the storm deposited , , and of snow on the four days, snowmobiles were being dispatched from all six fire halls to provide aid. Citizens band (CB) radio operators were used by the Niagara Regional Police for communication. The radio station CHOW facilitated communication by allowing people to call in and air needs on the radio, a role confirmed via a plaque from the Port Colborne Chamber of Commerce and scrolls from the Welland Chamber of Commerce.

The Canadian Forces assisted in the situation under police direction. For example, the mayor of Port Colborne requested military assistance from the Emergency Measures Organization in St. Catharines that resulted in an Army Reserve Battalion being sent and militia assisting in searching for stranded motorists. In a deployment headquartered at the Regional Police Station in Niagara Falls and stationed at the Lake Street Armoury in St. Catharines and the Niagara Falls Armoury in Niagara Falls, 156 reserves militia and 9 regular force soldiers helped in disaster relief. Regional authorities requested military assistance in the afternoon of January 29, and the first unit was called at 3:30 pm, with 130 employed in the operation by the next morning. Their initial priorities were to &quot;preserve life, clear main arteries into the communities of Port Colborne and Fort Erie, and try to open Highway 3 between Port Colborne and Fort Erie&quot;.

Farmers in Wainfleet dumped milk since it could not be transported out, and they also had trouble getting feed to their animals. The snow was difficult to plow; one road, near the lakeshore, could not be opened with a big front-end loader or a large bulldozer; instead, a small bulldozer with a bucket took 2.5 days to clear about of road. One resident noted they were snowed in for 19 days before being plowed out on February 14. One effect of the prolonged confinement at home many people experienced in the fall of that year was a marked increase in births at local hospitals (almost 18% in Regional Niagara in Canada).

Other cities on the Niagara Peninsula, such as St. Catharines Thorold, Niagara Falls, Welland and Dunnville were significantly impacted, while Hamilton was not hit as badly by the storm. Dunnville, 20 km west of Wainfleet, experienced piercing snow from the late morning onward, resulting in the schools closing before lunchtime; the cars of some teachers who stayed for a couple hours to ensure all the students were picked up, got stuck in snow drifts not far from the school so they were stranded overnight. Snowmobile services were set up at certain locations around the town and the Ontario Provincial Police transported the teachers and other stranded people home one-by-one by snowmobile Saturday night and Sunday. The airport closest to Dunnville, in Simcoe 50 km to the west, recorded consistent winds of 50 km/h and blizzard conditions (blowing snow and visibility of 0.2 km or less) for the whole afternoon of January 28, and very low visibility for much of January 29 (0.4 km to 0.8 km) and for most of January 31 (about 0.6 km).

St. Catharines, situated on the north side of the Niagara Peninsula on the shore of Lake Ontario, had winds between 50 and 70 km/h with blowing snow causing low visibility/almost blizzard conditions (0.4 km visibility) the entire afternoon of January 28, and had winds between 40 and 60 km/h and reduced visibility (approximately 0.8 km) most of January 29, and variable reduced visibility (ranging from 0.4 km to 1.2 km) for much of January 31, before the winds and blowing snow curtailed on February 1. Winds gust were as high as 98 km/h on January 28 and 93 km/h on January 31 leading to wind chill temperatures of -16.9 C and -14.6 C on those days, while 8.8 cm of snow was distributed on the city on January 28 and with lower amounts between 0.5 and 1.5 cm on the other days of the blizzard. Hamilton had blizzard conditions of blowing snow and visibility between 0 and 0.4 km from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. and semi-blizzard conditions (visibility about 0.8 km) for most of the evening on January 28 with total snow of 4.5 cm and peak wind gusts of 89 km/h.

London, Ontario, experienced consistent winds of about 50 km/h which caused blowing snow and near zero visibility (0.2 km or less) for the entire afternoon of January 28 even though only of new snow was deposited that day. Consistent winds of 35 to 40 km/h continued over three of the next four days, resulting in drifting and blowing snow causing reduced visibility (between 1 and 1.6 km) for almost all of January 29, low visibility (between 0.6 and 1.2 km) for almost all of January 31, and reduced visibility (between 1.2 and 1.6 km) for several hours on February 1, although only additional snow fell over the four days. The military, with reserves plus a 900-man infantry battalion, was called in to assist clearing snow drifts and stranded people in the London area, but conditions there were not as serious as the southern Niagara Region, with four wheel-drive vehicles being generally sufficient for transportation.

Kitchener had 3 hours of blizzard conditions (0 to 0.4 km visibility) the afternoon of January 28 with wind gusts up to 81 Km/h even though its total snow was only 5.7 cm that day.

==Northern New York==
Portions of northern New York state, particularly Jefferson and Lewis counties, were also hard hit. At 3:10 pm, on Friday, January 28, Watertown reported zero visibility and wind gusting to as the cold front that had moved through southern Ontario and Western New York advanced through northern New York. The Watertown region received of snow with the cold front, but unfrozen Lake Ontario (in contrast to frozen Lake Erie), along with atmospheric conditions favorable for lake effect snow, allowed snow bands to form that resulted in storm totals of in Watertown, in Mansville, Fort Drum, and more than in areas southeast of Watertown. The snow, along with the winds, resulted in drifts of , and stranded of more than 1,000 motorists.

After beginning with the cold-front passage at 3:10 pm on January 28 at Watertown, the blizzard&#x27;s winds peaked at at 7:00 pm. That night, about 150 people were stranded at the Chesebrough-Pond factory in Watertown. Three radio announcers at radio station 1410 AM WOTT in Watertown were stranded without food, and each of them worked 8-hour shifts to keep the station on 24 hours per day, playing music and taking hundreds of calls from North Country residents in need of services, such as fuel, food or reassurance. Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies brought the announcers provisions via snowmobile on the fifth day of their entrapment. Oddly enough, though the snow was piled up over the roof of the studios on Gifford Road, the morning announcer&#x27;s VW Bug parked next to the building was totally clear of snow, thanks to prevailing winds. It took him over 5 hours to travel the to his home in Brownville, as only one lane was clear on several of the roads he traveled.

During the storm, a Radio Emergency Associated Communication Teams (REACT) CB team set up at the plant to coordinate help for those needing things such as medical assistance, The Red Cross also set up at the factory, and snowmobiles and four-wheel drive vehicles were dispatched. After a lull at Watertown, the storm restarted at 2:30 am on January 29, and lasted until 10:00 pm. This portion of the storm included gusts to and heavy snow. The storm then abated at Watertown, but at 2:00 pm on Sunday, visibility returned to zero. By midnight Sunday, of new snow had fallen since Friday, January 28, at 7:00 am. The blizzard continued throughout Monday, January 31, with an additional of new snow before the snow stopped around 8:00 am on February 1.

Due to the lower wind speeds than those that occurred in western New York, the snow in northern New York was not as hard packed according to Ben Kolker of the NWS office in Buffalo. Northern New York did have significant snowfall, though, along with significant drifting. On February 1, Jefferson and Lewis counties were among the counties added to the initial federal emergency declaration, and on February 5, were among the counties declared major disaster areas. The New York District of the USACE assisted with snow clearing by having contractors clear a total of of roadway in Jefferson and Lewis counties. U.S. Marines were at Camp Drum (near Watertown) for cold-weather training, and some of them assisted in Jefferson and Lewis counties with fourteen 25-ton Amtrack vehicles, The National Guard assisted with track vehicles; U.S. Army troops from Camp Drum also helped with disaster relief.

Since food and supplies were in short supply in the area by the end of the storm, on February 1, the travel ban was lifted from 7:00 am until noon so 1,900 stranded travelers could leave the area. Agricultural interests were adversely affected by the storm, with the dairy industry hardest hit due to farmers&#x27; inability to get milk to market. In Jefferson County alone, about 85% of dairy farmers were forced to dump milk because tank trucks could not reach farms. This contributed to $8 million in agricultural losses. Other problems included barns collapsing from the snow (seven in Jefferson County), feed and grain shortages, disposal of manure, and farmers being unable to reach barns to feed cattle. Five deaths were reported in northern New York as a result of the storm, all due to heart attacks (four occurring while shoveling snow and another in his car).

At the end of the blizzard period on February 1, a National Weather Service spotter at Barnes Corners, Lewis County, measured a snow depth of 108&quot; on the level. Anecdotal reports from eastern sections of the Tow of Lorraine, Jefferson County, which was close to the area of heaviest snowfall, estimated snow depths of ten feet. 

On February 9, about a week after the storm ended, the average snow depth in the Black River basin (about ) which include Jefferson, Lewis and other counties was , having a liquid equivalent of that raised flooding concerns. Sears Pond, about southeast of Watertown, recorded a snow depth of with a liquid equivalent of .

===Music===

The alternative rock band Nada Surf recorded a song in 2002 titled &quot;Blizzard of &#x27;77&quot;, which opens with the following lyrics: &quot;In the blizzard of &#x27;77 / The cars were just lumps on the snow.&quot;

Canadian post-hardcore band Alexisonfire released their third studio album, &quot;Crisis&quot; in 2006, which had a victim of the blizzard with frostbitten hands as the cover art and the title song, and contains many lyrics directly referring to the blizzard, including the repeated lyrics &quot;One nine seven seven.&quot;

Jimmy Buffett&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Son of a Son of a Sailor&quot; included the song &quot;Mañana&quot;, which lyrics include: &quot;Yeah, they&#x27;re freezin&#x27; up in Buffalo stuck in their cars...&quot;

===Literature===

Two books have been written about it, &quot;The Blizzard&quot; by Robert Bahr and &quot;White Death – The Blizzard of &#x27;77&quot;, which is a compilation by Erno Rossi of accounts of the blizzard from both southern Ontario and western New York (Rossi 1999; note the original edition of the book was entitled &quot;White Death – Blizzard of &#x27;77&quot; and published in 1978).

===Other===

A board game, called &quot;The Blizzard of &#x27;77 Travel Game&quot; was created after the storm. In it, the players drive around the board, trying to collect goods, such as groceries, bank, work, drug store, and hardware with 2 safe spots of home and gasoline, before the storm hits. Once the storm hits, the board is flipped over to the &quot;Blizzard&quot; side and the players must continue in blizzard conditions.

A set of six glasses was sold by the &quot;Buffalo Courier-Express&quot; newspaper with reproductions of newspaper articles about the storm on them.

<doc id="925841" wikidata="Q3234114" url="?curid=925841" title="Most Haunted">
<text>Most Haunted is a British paranormal reality television series.

&quot;Most Haunted&quot; was first shown on Living TV between 2002 and 2010. However, it has since been revived on TV and online, via an official mobile app and YouTube Channel. Presented by Yvette Fielding, the programme investigates purported paranormal activity in a range of locations, mainly within the United Kingdom. The series was produced by Antix Productions.

After four years off-air, Fielding and Karl Beattie, the producer of the programme, confirmed that, following a successful online episode, &quot;Most Haunted&quot; would be returning to screens in August 2014, aired by Really.

In July 2019, Beattie announced that Really TV would no longer be making new episodes of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. However, repeats of previous series on Really TV will continue to air occasionally on the channel. &quot;Most Haunted&quot; new episodes, live events, and new extra content, including outtakes and behind the scenes material, will continue to be produced, and these will now air on the official Most Haunted YouTube channel to an international audience. A new channel is being sought by Antix Productions to air the new series. However, until this channel is found, all new material from &quot;Most Haunted&quot; will now be available on its YouTube channel.

Over 300 episodes of the programme have been broadcast to date.

== Cancellation and revival ==
On 12 August 2011 it was announced that Sky Living had officially axed &quot;Most Haunted&quot; and had returned the rights to the show to Yvette Fielding and Karl Beattie.

In 2012, it was revealed that Antix Productions partnered with Lionsgate to redevelop &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

In July 2013, Karl Beattie began scouting new locations for a new series of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

In April 2014, Yvette Fielding confirmed in an interview with Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Brunch&quot; that &quot;Most Haunted&quot; would be returning to television in late 2014; this was later confirmed on 4 June 2014. It was later confirmed that Really would be the new home of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

Really ended its partnership with &quot;Most Haunted&quot; in the summer of 2019, with the new owners of Really, Discovery, Inc. deciding to concentrate on importing American paranormal programming rather than the British-based &quot;Most Haunted&quot;.

Most Haunted moved its new content onto its new YouTube channel, which aired new &quot;Most Haunted&quot; material, shorter &quot;Most Haunted&quot; episodes, weekly live streams with Karl, Yvette, and Mary Beattie, and also live events at Halloween and other times. Contrary to opening captions on broadcast versions of the programme, current episodes now display opening wording stressing the &quot;Most Haunted&quot; team stand by the findings of their investigations (as YouTube have no rules or regulations on the legitimacy of paranormal content on the platform, unlike OFCOM).

== Production ==
The &quot;Most Haunted&quot; team has travelled not only in the United Kingdom but also Ireland, the Netherlands, Romania, the United States, Italy, and the Czech Republic, investigating paranormal activity for 24 hours at a time.

=== Photography ===
The photographic style of the series has changed considerably since Series 1. In the first series, many elaborate shots were set up in an almost &quot;theatrical&quot; style, with illuminated windows and dry ice. Locations were often illuminated outside at night with blue and green lights. There was a high emphasis on quality production. From series 1–3, there was extensive use of the Steadicam, which provided gliding shots during Yvette&#x27;s ghostly tales or for general views. In series 8, the team introduced a camera crane, or &#x27;jib&#x27; system, for elaborate aerial shots of both Yvette and the locations. Most of the photography in &quot;Most Haunted&quot; focuses on &quot;general views,&quot; also known as &quot;GV&#x27;s,&quot; of a location and its surroundings.

&quot;Most Haunted&quot; was filmed with both broadcast Sony DSR-570WSP &amp; DSR-PD170P DVCAM cameras and Sony DCR-PC9E miniDV cameras. A thermal imaging camera was also used to detect and highlight cold and warm spots. The style of the series changed somewhat after series five, losing its &quot;Most Haunted&quot; grungy look as it became more mainstream.

=== Music ===
&quot;Most Haunted&quot;&#x27;s music was originally composed for the picture by Alan Clark, using his own original sounds and samples and including some from the Spectrasonics sample libraries: Distorted Reality, Metamorphosis, and Biazzare Guitar. As of series 12, Clark&#x27;s music has been supplemented with additional stock music, which was also used on the now defunct &quot;Unexplained Channel&quot; programme, &quot;Rest in Peace&quot;. Living TV also released a CD featuring Clark&#x27;s music remixed and original material written and produced by composer and producer Steve Deakin-Davies (The Official Most Haunted Soundtrack Vol 1: The Ambition Company/Solo MH104)

== On-screen team ==

Between series 1 and series 15, &quot;Most Haunted&quot; featured a main presenter, a historian, a psychic medium, and a parapsychologist.

Essentially, the latter two are intended to create an even balance between paranormal and scientific explanations for the various phenomena that occur. Any information provided by the medium from claimed interactions with spirits is then analyzed by the historian to see if it can be verified. The core investigation team are supported by some of the production crew, who appear in the show and are generally involved with the investigation whilst performing their normal crew role. Most of these on-screen crew members also take part in séances.

From series 16, Antix Productions decided to remove psychic mediums from the format of the show.

Some episodes have also included at least one celebrity. So far, the celebrity guests have included Vic Reeves, Nancy Sorrell, Gaby Roslin, Scott Mills, Mark Chapman, Simon Gregson, Sue Cleaver, Carol Thatcher, Paul O&#x27;Grady, and Lee Ryan. For the series 10 episode from Coalhouse Fort, the team were joined by Scottish paranormal investigator Ryan O&#x27;Neill, and series 15 saw Bullet for My Valentine join the team on an investigation.

=== Former mediums ===
Between series 1 and series 14, a medium accompanied the team on their investigations. The mediums were as follows: 
* Derek Acorah (Series 1–6: 2001–2005)
* David Wells (Series 4–8 &amp; 9: 2004–2007)
* Gordon Smith (Series 7, 8: 2005–2006)
* Brian Shepherd (Series 4, 5: Series 10–13: 2008)
* Chris Conway (Series 14, 15: 2009)
The show has also featured guest mediums. So far, these have been Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito, Israeli-born Uri Geller, Rochford&#x27;s clairvoyant Kevin Wade, American-born Johnnie Fiori, Barrie John, Liverpool native Billy Roberts, and American-born Patrick Mathews.

It was decided for series 15 onwards that psychic mediums would not be used in the format.

=== Series 1–3 (2002–2003) ===
Known as &quot;Most Haunted with Yvette Fielding and Derek Acorah&quot; (This title was used until series 6)
The first series began on 25 May 2002. Each episode had a duration of 30 minutes. However, reruns of these episodes have been re-edited to the full hour and titled &quot;Most Haunted Unseen&quot;. Added footage in these episodes is shown with a caption in the corner to distinguish it from the original version. The series concluded with an investigation of Michelham Priory on 17 September 2002, which was coincidentally the first episode to be produced. In the eighth series the team revisited this location to mark the 100th episode. During the break in series, the team aired three live investigations, the third of which led into the second series on 8 April 2003. From this point onwards episodes were accompanied by a supplemental &quot;Most Haunted Extra&quot;. At this point, &quot;Extra&quot; was available as a ten-minute feature after the main show, accessible to viewers via the red button. For Series two and three, Phil Whyman joined the show as a paranormal investigator, replacing the original investigator Jason Karl, as well as guest investigators David Scanlan and Vicki Purewal, who left at the end of the first series. The show remained unchanged at this point until Series 4.

=== Series 4–6 (Derek Acorah departure and revamp) ===
The fourth series commenced on 23 March 2004 with an investigation of Owlpen Manor. &quot;Most Haunted Extra&quot; became a 30-minute programme, broadcast for half an hour after the main show on LivingTV. This series was the first series in which guest mediums joined the team during the investigations. This took some of the pressure off Derek Acorah who had been the only medium in the first three series. The main guest mediums involved during this series were Salisbury native Brian Shepherd, David Wells and Scunthorpe&#x27;s Ian Lawman.

Series five commenced on 14 September 2004. It was preceded by a 3 night &quot;Most Haunted Live!&quot; investigation advertised as a countdown to the series. Phil Whyman was replaced with (although he recently returned on the Live shows as a studio expert), then semi-regular, Ciarán O&#x27;Keeffe. Originally O&#x27;Keeffe viewed the footage recorded during the investigations and analysed it, putting forward his own views and opinions, which usually included suggestions as to other possible causes for the phenomena encountered. He shared this role with his colleague Matthew Smith who frequently attended the early &quot;Most Haunted Live&quot; events. Following the departure of Phil Whyman after Series 4, O&#x27;Keeffe began to join the team on location. Yvette&#x27;s brother Rick Fielding also left the show at the end of Series 4.

At the end of Series 5, Antix Productions began editing the series in-house at their own production offices. Prior to this, post-production had been completed at 422 Manchester. As a result, the series lost its original editor who had worked on &quot;Most Haunted&quot; since the first episode and all of the vintage film composite effects which resulted in a considerable change to the editing style and look of the programme.

For series six, beginning on 22 March 2005 with an investigation of Bodmin Gaol, David Wells became one of the main mediums alongside Derek Acorah appearing in every episode. 
This was Derek Acorah&#x27;s last &quot;Most Haunted&quot; series owing to the controversy he was involved in during its production which cast doubt on his ability to perform his role. As such he did not appear in the final episode at Sinai House. The number of episodes for Series 6 was originally intended to be 18, with the last 11 being part of Series 7. Due to Acorah&#x27;s departure, the series was extended. This was the first series in which the team conducted 24-hour investigations over in the USA. Acorah didn&#x27;t return for the show&#x27;s finale at Sinai House when David Wells was the main medium.

=== Series 7–9 (Spin-offs and cast changes) ===
The seventh series began on 1 November 2005 yet only ran for six weeks, shortened from an intended nine. Two of the final three episodes (at Bamburgh Castle and Chambercombe Manor) were broadcast at the end of Series 8 and the last, at Spitbank Fort, was broadcast as special on Boxing Day 2006.
Parapsychologist Louie Savva a regular on the &quot;Most Haunted Live!&quot; events joined the team for a few of the investigations in this series covering shows which O&#x27;Keeffe was unable to take part in.

Series eight began on 27 June 2006 with the 100th investigation and a revisit to Michelham Priory. It marked the last appearance of Richard Felix as the resident historian. He was not replaced until the tenth series. This series featured guest mediums Gordon Smith, Ian Lawman, Ian Shillito of Braintree, Essex and Kevin Wade.

An investigation of South Stack Lighthouse began the ninth series on 2 January 2007. Four episodes into the series, new episodes became known as &quot;New Most Haunted&quot; in television listings and on-screen. This is the last series of &quot;Most Haunted&quot; where &quot;Most Haunted Extra&quot; accompanied each episode. After the first few episodes, &quot;Extra&quot; was moved to Living2. &quot;Most Haunted Extra&quot; last appeared accompanying &quot;Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders&quot;. This was the last series to feature David Wells as a regular medium on the show.

=== Series 10: Midsummer Murders ===
The 10th series was given the tagline Midsummer Murders and was an eight-part series where Most Haunted investigators attempted to solve murder mysteries in normal English villages. It was hosted by Most Haunted historian Lesley Smith. The series commenced on a weekly broadcast from 19 June 2007 to 31 July 2007 and the team visited (in order of broadcast) Stoney Middleton, Nantwich, Castleton, Pluckley, Ruthin, Tutbury, Tarvin, and Bakewell. An episode, shot in Lymm Village, saw the team investigate a suspect of Jack the Ripper. This episode was not aired on television. Most Haunted: Midsummer Murders was never released on DVD.

=== Series 11 (The new investigator years) ===
The 11th series of &quot;Most Haunted&quot; began on 19 February 2008 and came to a close at the end of April. This series featured three psychic mediums: Johnnie Fiori, Nottingham native Barrie John and Brian Shepherd. Lesley Smith replaced Richard Felix as the resident historian on the recorded shows and travelled with the team to each location. The team were also joined by Scottish paranormal investigator Ryan O&#x27;Neill, a guest on episodes 1&amp;2 of series 10 at Coalhouse Fort. In the Coalhouse Fort episodes of the show, an American psychic joined the team and claimed to have encountered the spirits of a bespectacled old man and his &quot;gawky&quot; son in the museum of the fort, who had been responsible for compiling the collection. The team allegedly picked up the voice and moaning from the old man later in the night. The psychic also claimed that there were spirits of animals in the fort, perhaps from horses who had been involved in its construction and claimed to have encountered the spirit of a pilot named Jeff and other air force men around the fort who had been there during World War I. She also claimed that in one area of the fort she picked up macabre images of debauchery and sodomy where sexual favours were performed in return for food and money, also from World War I. The team also apparently picked up countless examples of poltergeist activity in the fort with the unexplained throwing of stones, knocking and the occasional moaning, responses from taunts by the team for the ghosts to make their presence known.

=== Series 12, 13 (Most Haunted USA) &amp; 14 ===
Alternating between series 12 and 13, Living broadcast on an episode from series 12 followed the following week with an episode from Season 13 also known as Most Haunted USA. Series 14 aired in 2010 featuring 10 episodes with the opening episode at Speke Hall.

=== Series 15 (Final series on Living) ===
Series 15 started on 12 May 2010, with an investigation into Berkeley Castle and continue to show every Wednesday on Living at 22:00 BST. The series ended on Wednesday 21 July 2010. The series was made up of 10 episodes concluding with a two-parter at Weald &amp; Downland Museum, Singleton, West Sussex.

=== DVD - Exclusive DVD episode, 2011 (stand alone investigation) ===
A new episode of &quot;Most Haunted&quot; was released exclusively to DVD on 12 December 2011. This investigation was based at The Rifles Museum in Salisbury, England

=== No new episodes (2011 - 2014) ===
&quot;Most Haunted&quot; ended in 2010, with the showing of repeats by LivingTV ending in 2011. In 2010, Freeview channel &quot;Sky 3&quot; (later &quot;Pick TV&quot;, now Pick) began showing the repeats. This continued until 2016.

Following the initial axing by LivingTV, Karl Beattie began a fan campaign to get the show back on the air. &quot;Most Haunted&quot; returned with a Christmas DVD special from The Rifles Museum in Salisbury. Later, three episodes from The Royal Court Theatre, Bacup, England produced and aired initially online then sold to Really TV as a single episode..

=== Series 16 (Revival on Really, new set up 2014) ===
It was announced on 4 June, that &quot;Most Haunted&quot; would return to TV in August 2014 with a new 10 part series to air on the Freeview channel, Really. Yvette Fielding returned to the show along with Karl Beattie. Former team members Stuart Torevell and Fred Batt also returned. Welsh heavy metal band Bullet for My Valentine appeared in an episode of the show.

Yvette Fielding was interviewed on the James Whale Show, discussing the current show and her reasons for not using mediums in the new series of &quot;Most Haunted.&quot;

== Spin Offs ==

=== Most Haunted Live! ===
=== Most Haunted: Recurring Nightmares ===
In Most Haunted: Recurring Nightmares, the presenters recall their most frightening visits.

=== Most Haunted USA ===
&quot;Most Haunted USA&quot; was an eight-part mini-series that aired on the American Travel Channel from 12 December 2008 to 30 January 2009. The series has also aired in the UK and includes the team&#x27;s investigation at the famous Waverly Hills Sanitorium in Kentucky. It aired as part of Series 11 in the UK.

=== Most Haunted: The Live Series ===
In January 2010, &quot;Most Haunted&quot; returned for a spin-off of the live shows. These episodes differed from the previous live shows in that they were more like a series investigation, but broadcast live. The series was broadcast every Saturday night and ran for 8 weeks, with each episode lasting two hours.

=== Most Haunted: Top Ten Scariest Moments ===
&quot;Top Ten Scariest Moments&quot; was a part-mini series that consists of 10 45-minute episodes, that was broadcast on Really and is still available to watch through UKTV Play, Really&#x27;s on demand service. The series features Yvette recalling her scariest moments from past series. A slightly shortened edit of the episode from which that moment was from is then shown. Included in the online series was 10-minute discussion featuring Yvette and Glen Hunt, the resident sceptic, on &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; after the investigation at the Wentworth Woodhouse Stable Block as to whether the footage of the &#x27;Wentworth Ghost&#x27; was faked.

== Controversy ==
On several occasions the former spiritualist medium Derek Acorah was supposedly possessed by an entity, sometimes evil or sometimes &quot;lost and confused&quot;. Two such cases exposed Acorah. Before the filming, Acorah had been fed misinformation twice about the non-existent ghosts of Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles by the show parapsychologist Ciarán O&#x27;Keeffe. During the investigations, later broadcast, Acorah presented the information as fact and even behaved as though being possessed by the fictional ghosts. O&#x27;Keeffe later revealed in the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; that Kreed Kafer and Rik Eedles were anagrams of &#x27;Derek Faker&#x27; and &#x27;Derek Lies&#x27;. Even though O&#x27;Keeffe exposed Acorah, the paper also claimed that O&#x27;Keeffe had exposed the rest of the &quot;Most Haunted&quot; team. O&#x27;Keeffe later reported that he had been grossly misquoted and misrepresented in the article, and produced a response outlining his version of the show based on his observations and findings, saying he had exposed Derek Acorah and not the entirety of &quot;Most Haunted&quot;. The show&#x27;s presenter, Yvette Fielding, said in an interview that she believes it was a fake possession.

The show was reported in 2005 to Ofcom relating to Derek Acorah. Ofcom described the show as one &quot;where techniques are used which mean the audience is not necessarily in full possession of the facts&quot;. Ofcom ruled that this was not fraud because &quot;Most Haunted&quot; is an entertainment show, not a legitimate investigation into the paranormal, and should not be taken seriously.

Although not mentioned by O&#x27;Keeffe, the &quot;Mirror&quot; article also brought into question unedited footage which appeared to show Yvette Fielding and Karl Beattie faking &#x27;paranormal&#x27; occurrences such as ghostly bumps and knocks. Fielding denied these claims; Beattie did not comment.

<text>The Buffalo Blizzard was a soccer club that existed from 1992 to 2001 in Buffalo, New York.

==History==
The team was originally owned by the Knox brothers who owned the Buffalo Sabres at the time, and additionally by the Riches who owned the minor league baseball Buffalo Bisons. During their last five years of existence, the team was owned by John Bellanti who had previously owned the Buffalo Stallions of the original Major Indoor Soccer League.

The team&#x27;s attendance was always in the top five of the league until its last season, and they had their record high attendance year in 1993–1994 season with an average attendance of 8,435 fans. The major stars of the team were the Pikuzinski brothers, Rudy and Randy, who rank sixth and ninth on the all-time points list. The team colors were blue, purple, black, and white, and the team mascot was a dog Spyke who rode a four-wheeler. The team never won a playoff series.

The NPSL ceased operation in 2001 and several of its remaining teams formed the Major Indoor Soccer League, but the Blizzard declined to participate and folded at that time.

<doc id="925845" wikidata="Q63106" url="?curid=925845" title="Alexander von Keyserling">
<text>Alexander Friedrich Michael Lebrecht Nikolaus Arthur Graf von Keyserling (15 August 1815 – 8 May 1891) was a Baltic German geologist and paleontologist from the Keyserlingk family of Baltic German nobility.

==Career==
Alexander von Keyserling was born on at the Kabillen Manor, , Courland Governorate (in present-day Kabile, Kuldīga Municipality, Latvia), then part of the Russian Empire. His father was Count Heinrich Diedrich Wilhelm von Keyserling, 3rd Count of Rautenburg, was a spokesman, and in Courland, his mother was Baroness Anna Amalie Benigna . His family was of Westphalian origin and was originated in Herford, they were considered part of the &quot;Uradel&quot;, or old nobility. The first ever mentioned member was Albert Keserlink (1443-1467 or 1468), the mayor of Herford. Alexander belonged to the &quot;House of Rautenburg-Telsen-Paddern&quot;, which was a subdivided branch of the Prussian comital branch. The branch&#x27;s founder Dietrich II von Keyserling, Herr auf und , was elevated to count in 1786. Dietrich&#x27;s father Heinrich Christian also inherited the title of &quot;Count of Rautenburg&quot;, although Alexander didn&#x27;t inherit the title since he was the 10th child in the family, his elder brother Otto Ulrich Johann inherited the title.

Alexander studied at the Humboldt University of Berlin, here he met with future German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck and John Lothrop Motley, with whom he became lifelong friends.

Alexander is considered to be one of the founders of Russian geology. He made many expeditions on behalf of Nicholas I of Russia in Estonia, northern Russia, and the Urals (1839-1846).

He was also a botanist and zoologist who wrote &quot;Die wirbelthiere Europa&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;Vertebrates of Europe&quot;) with Johann Heinrich Blasius. This work was published in 1840.

Alexander&#x27;s nephews include diplomat Heinrich von Keyserlingk and writer Eduard von Keyserling. Archibald von Keyserling, the first leader of the Latvian Navy, was his brother Eduard Ernst Hermann von Keyserling&#x27;s grandson. Philosopher Hermann von Keyserling was his grandson.

==Evolution==
Keyserling was an advocate of the transmutation of species. In 1853, he wrote an article which suggested that species arose from the activity of &quot;alien molecules&quot; acting on the embryo. He believed that such molecules were transported by miasma. In the third edition of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; published in 1861, Charles Darwin added a &quot;Historical Sketch&quot; that acknowledged the ideas of Keyserling.

Darwin sent a copy of his book to Keyserling who was skeptical about the role of natural selection in evolution. By 1886, however, he embraced most of Darwin&#x27;s ideas claiming &quot;I renounced my views which contradicted Darwin&#x27;s theory, and I consider that the changes of the embryo arise not by means of external action of certain molecules but by the influence of selection and heredity.&quot;

==Legacy==
Keyserling is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of gecko, &quot;Teratoscincus keyserlingii&quot;.

<doc id="925848" wikidata="Q16259521" url="?curid=925848" title="Seat belt legislation">
<text>Seat belt legislation requires the fitting of seat belts to motor vehicles and the wearing of seat belts by motor vehicle occupants to be mandatory. Laws requiring the fitting of seat belts to cars have in some cases been followed by laws mandating their use, with the effect that thousands of deaths on the road have been prevented. Different laws apply in different countries to the wearing of seat belts.

==National comparisons==

===Australia===
In Australia, after the introduction of mandatory front outboard mounting points in 1964, the use of seat belts by all vehicle passengers was made compulsory in the states of Victoria and South Australia in 1970 and 1971, respectively. By 1973, the use of fitted seat belts by vehicle occupants was made compulsory for the rest of Australia and some other countries during the 1970s and 1980s. The subsequent dramatic decline in road deaths is generally because of seat belt laws and subsequent road safety campaigns. Seat belts are not required for bus occupants unless fitted, reversing drivers, and those driving some slow-moving vehicles. The laws for these differ depending on the state or territory with jurisdiction.

=== Canada ===

All provinces in Canada have primary enforcement seat belt laws. In 1976, Ontario was the first province to pass a law which required vehicle occupants to wear seat belts.

=== United Kingdom ===
In the United Kingdom, seat belts must be worn at all times, by all passengers, if they are fitted to a vehicle unless reversing. Passengers may be exempt from wearing a seat belt for various exceptions, such as medical reasons. Since September 18, 2006, children travelling in the UK must also use an appropriate child seat in addition to the standard seat belt, unless they are 12 years old or have reached at least in height, whichever is first.

In the UK, a requirement for anchorage points was introduced in 1965, followed by the requirement in 1968 to fit three-point belts in the front outboard positions on all new cars and all existing cars back to 1965. Successive UK governments proposed, but failed to deliver, seat belt legislation throughout the 1970s. Front seat belts were compulsory equipment on all new cars registered in the UK from 1968, although it did not become compulsory for them to be worn until 1983. Rear seat belts were compulsory equipment from 1986 and it became compulsory for them to be worn in 1991. However, it has never been a legal requirement for cars registered before those dates to be fitted with seat belts. In one such attempt in 1979 similar claims for potential lives and injuries saved were advanced. William Rodgers, then Secretary of State for Transport in the Callaghan Labour Government (1976–1979), stated: &quot;On the best available evidence of accidents in this country – evidence which has not been seriously contested – compulsion could save up to 1000 lives and 10,000 injuries a year.&quot;

=== United States ===
In the United States, seat belt legislation varies by state. The state of Wisconsin introduced legislation in 1961 requiring seat belts to be fitted to the front outboard seat positions of cars. Seat belts have been mandatory equipment since the 1968 model year per Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208.
New York State passed the first law in the US mandating the use of seat belts in 1984 under the leadership of John D. States, an orthopedic surgeon who dedicated his career to improving automotive safety. Depending on which state a driver is in, not wearing a seat belt in the front seat is either a primary offense or a secondary offense, with the exception of New Hampshire, which does not have a law requiring people over age 18 to wear a seat belt. In the front seat, the driver and each passenger must wear a seat belt, one person per belt. In some states, such as New Hampshire, Michigan, Arkansas, and Missouri, belts in the rear seats are not mandatory for people over the age of 16. 
A primary offense means that a police officer can pull a driver over for the seat belt law violation alone, and secondary offense indicates that one can be punished for a seat belt law violation only if they are already pulled over for another reason. By January 2007 25 states and the District of Columbia had primary seat belt laws, 24 had secondary seat belt laws, and New Hampshire had no laws. Some states determine whether to enforce failure to wear a seat belt as a primary or secondary offense depending on whether the unrestrained person is in the front or back of the car. Kansas, Maryland, and New Jersey enforce failure to wear a seat belt as a driver or front-seat passenger as a primary offense and failure to wear a seat belt as a rear seat passenger as a secondary offense. 
In 2009, Public Health Law Research published several evidence briefs summarizing the research assessing the effect of a specific law or policy on public health. One stated, &quot;Safety belt laws work, but there is strong evidence to support that primary enforcement safety belt laws are more effective than secondary enforcement laws in increasing seat belt use and reducing crash injuries.&quot;

Another found that &quot;there is strong evidence that enhanced seat belt enforcement interventions can substantially increase seat belt use and its associated benefits.&quot;

===European Union===
In the European Union, seat belts were only mandatory in vehicles under 3.5 tonnes until a 2003 directive made them mandatory in all vehicles in 2006. The directive also clarifies that seat belts are to be used for children and makes it mandatory to deactivate airbags for the use of rear-facing child restraints. Some exemptions exist for five members states — Belgium, Denmark, France, Sweden, and Spain.

===Developing countries===

In many developing countries, pedestrians, cyclists, rickshaw operators and moped users represent the majority of road users.

In India, all cars manufactured after March 25, 1994, are equipped with front seat belts. The rule was extended for rear seats in 2002. The usage of seat belts is to be implemented by the respective states, with most states making seat belt usage for front seat passengers mandatory in 2002. Older vehicles that did not originally have seat belts were exempted. However, enforcement is weak in most parts of the country.

In Indonesia, belts are only mandatory for front seats. Many low-entry car models are not equipped with rear seat belts.

In Malaysia, the first stage of safety belt laws was implemented in 1979. This was expanded in January 2009 to include rear passengers. Passenger vehicles registered prior to January 1, 1995, and those weighing more than 3.5 tons are exempted from this rule. The third and fourth stages, which will deal with baby and child seats and the number of passengers in a vehicle, have not taken effect.

In the Philippines, a seat belt law, Republic Act No. 8750, was approved on August 5, 1999. The law took effect in 2000 and requires all public and private vehicles, except motorcycles and tricycles, to have their front seats equipped with seat belts. Front seats as defined by the law includes the first row of seats behind the driver for public utility buses. Those below the age of six are prohibited to occupy the front seats of motor vehicles even if wearing a seat belt. Jeepneys are only required to have lap belts for the front seat passengers and the driver.

== Overview of seat belt legislation by country ==
The table below gives an overview of when seat belt legislation was first introduced in different countries. It includes both regional and national legislation.

* - actually only vehicles registered after 15 June 1976; in previous registered vehicles fitting is optional
† - required by the law, but no penalty for violation at the time
‡ - required by the law, but low enforcement
♣ - definitely introduced by this date, possibly earlier

== Effects ==
Studies by road safety authorities conclude that seat belt legislation has reduced the number of casualties in road accidents.

Experiments using both crash test dummies and human cadavers also indicated that wearing seat belts should lead to reduced risk of death and injury in car crashes.

Studies of accident outcomes suggest that fatality rates among car occupants are reduced by between 30 and 50 percent if seat belts are worn. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that death risks for a driver wearing a lap-shoulder seat belt are reduced by 48 percent. The same study indicated that in 2007, an estimated 15,147 lives were saved by seat belts in the United States and that if seat belt use were increased to 100 percent, an additional 5024 lives would have been saved.

An earlier statistical analysis by the NHTSA claimed that seat belts save over 10,000 lives every year in the US.

According to a more recent fact sheet produced by the NHTSA:
:&quot;In 2012, seat belts saved an estimated 12,174 lives among passenger vehicle occupants 5 and older. [...] Research has found that lap/shoulder seat belts, when used, reduce the risk of fatal injury to front-seat passenger car occupants by 45% and the risk of moderate-to-critical injury by 50%. [...] Research on the effectiveness of child safety seats has found them to reduce the risk of fatal injury by 71% for infants (younger than 1 year old) and by 54% for toddlers (1 to 4 years old) in passenger cars.&quot; 

By 2009, despite large increases in population and the number of vehicles, road deaths in Victoria had fallen below 300, less than a third of the 1970 level, the lowest since records were kept, and far below the per capita rate in jurisdictions such as the United States. This reduction was generally attributed to aggressive road safety campaigns beginning with the seat belt laws.

A 2008 study in the &quot;Journal of Health Economics&quot; found that mandatory seat belt laws in the U.S. &quot;significantly increased seatbelt use among high school age youths by 45-80%&quot; and &quot;significantly reduced traffic fatalities and serious injuries resulting from fatal crashes by 8 and 9%, respectively.&quot; The authors note that these &quot;results suggest that if all states had primary enforcement seatbelt laws then regular youth seatbelt use would be nearly universal and youth fatalities would fall by about 120 per year.&quot;

==Regulations==

Unece has some regulations on seat belt.

== Opposition ==

A number of groups and individuals are opposed to seat belt legislation. The most common grounds for opposition are:

* The view that laws requiring the wearing of seat belts are an infringement of individual liberty.
* Claims that official estimates of the number of lives saved by seat belts are overstated or fail to take into account additional risks for other road users.

=== Risk compensation and other theories ===

The most common basis for disputing estimates of the benefits of seat belts is risk compensation and risk homeostasis, advanced by researchers John Adams and Gerald Wilde. The idea of this theory is that, if the risk of death or injury from a car crash is reduced by the wearing of seat belts, drivers will respond by reducing the precautions they take against crashes. Adams accepts the hypothesis that wearing seat belts improves a vehicle occupant&#x27;s chances of surviving a crash. In order to explain the disparity between the agreed improvement in crash survival and the observed results, Adams and Wilde argue that protecting someone from the consequences of risky behaviour may tend to encourage greater risk taking. Wilde states, &quot;to compel a person to use protection from the consequences of hazardous driving, as seat belt laws do, is to encourage hazardous driving. A fine for non-compliance will encourage seat belt use, but the fact that the law fails to increase people&#x27;s desire to be safe encourages compensatory behaviour.&quot;

Studies and experiments have been carried out to examine the risk compensation theory. In one experiment subjects were asked to drive go-karts around a track under various conditions. It was found that subjects who started driving belted did not drive any slower when subsequently unbelted, but those who started driving unbelted did drive consistently faster when subsequently belted. A study of habitual non-seat belt wearers driving in freeway conditions found evidence that they had adapted to seat belt use by adopting higher driving speeds and closer following distances. In another study, taxi drivers who were habitual non-wearers were timed over a route with passengers who did, and others who did not, insist on the driver wearing a belt. They completed the route faster when belted.

In addition to risk compensation, Adams has suggested other mechanisms that may lead to inaccurate or unsupportable predictions of positive benefits from seat belt legislation.

* Case-control studies based on voluntary use of safety aids can attribute to the aid benefits that actually come from the risk-averse nature of those likely to use them voluntarily (confounding), particularly early adopters.
* Fatality rates are subject to considerable stochastic noise, and comparison of single years or short periods can be misleading.

However, after introduction of seat belt laws in many European and American countries, safety agencies did not validate the compensation theory:

A 2007 study based on data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that between 1985 and 2002 there were &quot;significant reductions in fatality rates for occupants and motorcyclists after the implementation of belt use laws&quot;, and that &quot;seatbelt use rate is significantly related to lower fatality rates for the total, pedestrian, and all non-occupant models even when controlling for the presence of other state traffic safety policies and a variety of demographic factors&quot;. A comprehensive 2003 US study also did &quot;not find any evidence that higher seat belt usage has a significant effect on driving behavior.&quot; Their results showed that &quot;overall, mandatory seat belt laws unambiguously reduce traffic fatalities.&quot;

===Individual liberty===

Opponents have objected to the laws on libertarian principles. Some do so on the grounds that seat belt laws infringe on their civil liberties. For example, in a 1986 letter to the editor of the &quot;New York Times&quot;, a writer argued that seat belt legislation was &quot;coercive&quot; and that &quot;a mandatory-seat-belt law violates the right to bodily privacy and self-control&quot;.

A counterpoint to the libertarian view is that by reducing death and serious injury, mandatory seat belt use and enforcement of seat belt laws results in substantial social benefits. For example, an analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that in 2010 non-fatal injuries to motor vehicle occupants cost the United States $48 billion in medical expenses and lost work. An example is an unbelted driver who kills or injures another road user because he/she slides out of proper seating position and cannot regain control of the vehicle during slippery conditions. Another notable scenario is of rear-seated passengers being forced forward in a crash and thus inadvertently harming the driver or front passenger. A University of Wisconsin study demonstrated that car accident victims who had not worn seat belts cost the hospital (and the state, in the case of the uninsured) on average 25% more.

=== Side-effects of seat belts ===
Neck injuries can be caused by the deceleration from a high speed. The passengers head continues to move forward while the body is restrained, potentially causing paralyzing injuries. A study of such injuries notes, &quot;Seatbelts save lives. However, they may cause injury to adjacent structures and when they malfunction can cause injury to the abdominal viscera, bony skeleton and vascular structures. The motor industry has attempted to reduce these injuries by modification of vehicle design and safety equipment.&quot;

===Airbag and cost===

In 1985, some manufacturers believed mandatory cheaper seat belts could stop airbag development, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

<doc id="925861" wikidata="Q5225685" url="?curid=925861" title="Dartmouth College Marching Band">
<text>The Dartmouth College Marching Band (abbr. DCMB) is an organization of Dartmouth College. There are a little under 60 members.

==About the DCMB==
The Dartmouth College Marching Band was formed during the 1889 football season., making it the oldest in the Ivy League. Since the 1960s, the DCMB has been a &quot;scatter band&quot; like every Ivy League marching band except Cornell&#x27;s band.

During the fall, the band attends all home football games and one away game. For the pre-game and halftime of each game, the band writes a script, intended to be humorous, which is read over the loudspeaker as the band scrambles into a formation which relates to the jokes in the script. During the football game, the band plays during offensive first downs, defensive third downs, and after any points are scored, and supplies various chants and songs.

Once football season is over, the DCMB remains active by acting as a pep band at hockey and basketball games, as well as by playing at various special events on campus such as Winter Carnival. The band also performs &quot;Bandygrams&quot; for Valentine&#x27;s Day, allowing other students to request romantic songs be played at their friends, lovers, or enemies around campus.

Historically, the band included a kazoo section as well as a &quot;liquid percussion&quot; section, in which kegs and jugs were used as percussion instruments.

While the band does have official faculty representatives, the organization is primarily student-run. The &quot;Big 4&quot; of the band consist of the President, Vice President, Drum Major, and Assistant Drum Major. In addition, other members of the &quot;Directorate&quot; deal with equipment management, show writing, publicity, social life, supplying music, maintaining lists, and other various necessary tasks. Positions are filled by election at the end of Fall term, with the exception of the Drum Major. Drum Major auditions are held winter term, and are used to select an assistant Drum Major who will aid the current Drum Major and prepare to take over the following winter. By DCMB tradition, the Governor of Hawaii is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of directorate, and supreme authority rests with the Coke Machine. The coke machine in Morton Hall was elected to the directorate in November 1988 when Tor Blaisdell ran for president unopposed. Mr. Blaisdell was elected as president, while the Coke Machine became a member of the DCMB directorate.

==Traditions and history==
The band continues to play the old fight songs that have been played at football games for nearly a century. These songs include &quot;Dartmouth&#x27;s in Town Again,&quot; &quot;Come Stand Up Men,&quot; &quot;As the Backs Go Tearing By,&quot; and &quot;Glory to Dartmouth&quot; – collectively known as the &quot;Dartmouth Tunes&quot; or &quot;DT&#x27;s&quot;. The conclusion of each game is cause to play the Alma Mater, to which the football team and audience members sing, followed by an arrangement of &quot;Hey Baby&quot; from the &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot; soundtrack. Before home football games, the band marches through Hanover, New Hampshire&#x27;s Main Street, playing a drum cadence and the Dartmouth Tunes.

In the week before classes begin, the members of the DCMB flock to campus for band camp where members refresh their musical abilities, as well as marching abilities since the band needs to look its best when marching on and off the field and around town in order to not distract from the ensemble&#x27;s impeccable playing and scrumptious comedy.

Every Dartmouth Night Weekend, the band doubles in size as alumni return wearing sweaters knitted by the Faculty Advisor&#x27;s wife, and march with the band. Some alumni have come back for more than 50 homecomings. The band demonstrates its only fancy marching during the halftime show, as band members march directly into a &quot;D&quot; formation.

For the senior game, DCMB senior members do a pants-less run across the field and perform the rest of the halftime show without pants.

===Song repertoire===
The song repertoire consists primarily of pop and classic rock as well as some TV and movie theme music, though new additions are constantly being added by students. Some of the band&#x27;s most played songs include:
*Dartmouth Tunes (DT&#x27;s):
**&quot;Dartmouth&#x27;s in Town Again&quot;
**&quot;Come Stand Up Men&quot;
**&quot;As the Backs Go Tearing By&quot;
**&quot;Glory to Dartmouth&quot;
*&quot;Alma Mater&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Men of Dartmouth&quot;)
*The Mighty Mighty Bosstones - &quot;The Impression That I Get&quot;
*Walk the Moon - &quot;Shut Up and Dance&quot;
*Smash Mouth - &quot;All Star&quot;
*Bruce Channel - &quot;Hey! Baby&quot; (from &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;)
*Richard O&#x27;Brien - &quot;Time Warp&quot; (from &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot;)
*The Foundations - &quot;Build Me Up Buttercup&quot;
*Cascada - &quot;Everytime We Touch&quot;
*Wilson Pickett - &quot;Land of 1000 Dances&quot;

<doc id="925867" wikidata="Q12060638" url="?curid=925867" title="Hyde Park, Leeds">
<text>Hyde Park is an inner-city residential area of north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, situated between the University of Leeds and Headingley. It sits in the Headingley and Hyde Park ward of Leeds City Council.

The area is in the centre of the city&#x27;s student community, being next to Headingley, another large student community. There are also many full-time, long-term, non-student families and single people, and a sizable South Asian community.

Before the dense speculative developments of red brick terraced housing in the late Victorian era, the area was the site of the Leeds Royal Park pleasure ground, quarries, and fields in the estate of the Earl of Cardigan. The Hyde Park name was extended to the new neighbourhoods from Hyde Park Corner on the A660, with that nucleus historically being known as Wrangthorn.

==Toponymy==

The area surrounding Hyde Park Corner was originally known as Wrangthorn, a name still used in the Church of England parish Woodhouse and Wrangthorn, and at St Augustine&#x27;s Church, Wrangthorn. The name &quot;Hyde Park&quot; seems to have been extended to the present area from the name of the road junction Hyde Park Corner, itself apparently named in the nineteenth century on the inspiration of Hyde Park, London. According to J. Landfear Lucas, writing in 1914,

Two suggested explanations have been offered. The first is to the effect that, in the year 1800, a farmhouse was built on the site of the present Wrangthorn Church, by Nathaniel Atkinson, whose son John carried on the farm after his father&#x27;s death, the land extending from the Cardigan estate to the slopes of Woodhouse Ridge, John Atkinson and a friend or two took coach to London, and on their safe return had a meeting in the farmhouse, and over a bowl of punch solemnly gave the district the name of &quot;Hyde Park Corner&quot; to commemorate their pleasant visit to London. The present &quot;Hyde Park&quot; Hotel at Leeds was then called the &quot;Red Lion,&quot; but its name was soon afterwards changed ... The second suggested explanation is that the builder and proprietor of certain houses which formed the nucleus of the present Hyde Park Road in Leeds had named a new street &quot;Henrietta&quot; after a beloved daughter. Subsequently, however, he took a journey to London, where, to his annoyance, he found that a Henrietta Street bore an evil repute. On the other hand, Hyde Park had pleased him mightily, and on his return he substituted that appellation, and reserved &quot;Henrietta&quot; exclusively for his daughter.

==Community==
The community is ethnically diverse, including a large Pakistani population.

In July 2005, Hyde Park became the focus of international attention as police carried out a raid connected to the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Officers used a controlled explosion to enter a property at 28 Alexandra Grove, situated roughly where the Hyde Park and Burley areas meet. Hundreds of local residents were evacuated as police searched the house, one of six in West Yorkshire to be raided that day. Despite media speculation that the house had allegedly been used as a &#x27;bomb factory&#x27; by the suicide bombers, police later said they found no explosives in the property.

In July 1995 the area suffered serious rioting after the taking over of a local pub, The Newlands, by the police to be used in surveillance. The local community rallied and created Unity Day, a popular community festival started by the Hyde Park Residents Association held on the adjacent Woodhouse Moor, usually in August. The non-student community is vibrant, artsy and centres around Unity Day, Friends of Woodhouse Moor, Royal Park Community Consortium and other groups.

==Amenities==
The area is home to many places of worship; Three mosques, namely Makkah Masjid, the Al Madinah Masjid, and the Leeds Grand Mosque, the latter being the largest in Leeds, one Hindu temple, two Anglican churches, namely All Hallows Church and St Augustine&#x27;s Wrangthorn, and a catholic church named Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church. Alongside outlets primarily catering for the student population there remain a number of smaller shops selling largely traditional South Asian goods. This arguably lessens the impact of studentification, though some community groups do consider this to be a problem and tension exists.

Cultural facilities include the Hyde Park Picture House, an historic independent art house cinema. The Royal Park, on Queen&#x27;s Road, is a large public house with a downstairs gig venue, popular with the student population, and next door stands the Brudenell Social Club, a members&#x27; club which is a venue for local and underground music.

There are also a number of cafes and shops at Hyde Park Corner, including a vintage and antiques store and a Greek cafe. The area has many local or independent shops, such as DIY stores, takeaways, fruit and vegetable shops, two Sainsbury&#x27;s stores, a Coop and two independent mini supermarkets, a pharmacy, a laundrette, and three vintage clothes stores.

The area is close to Burley Park railway station and benefits from good bus links into the city centre and North Leeds, which makes the area popular with young professionals.

Woodhouse Moor, which sits between Hyde Park, Woodhouse and the University campus is one of the most used parks in the city.

==Housing==
The majority of residential properties in the area are late Victorian and Edwardian back-to-back brick terraces or face onto wide streets with communal access alleyways at the rear. A small area of 1980s council housing lies between Hyde Park Road and Woodsley Road, these replaced terrace housing demolished due to slum clearance. Main roads are cambered and some still retain original Yorkstone pavements and iron guttering. However, Leeds City Council has been removing much of the stone paving and granite kerbs to be replaced by modern tarmac and concrete. A large number of houses in Hyde Park are owned by private landlords who rent to students.

<text>Rathfarnham Castle () is a 16th-century fortified house in Rathfarnham, South Dublin, Ireland. Originally a semi-fortified and battlemented structure it underwent extensive alterations in the 18th century. It is in State care, has been restored and is open to the public.

==History==
===Early stages===
An earlier Irish castle on the site was occupied by the Harold family, who held it as tenants of the le Bret family. It was replaced by the present building, built on lands confiscated from the Eustace family of Baltinglass, to whom it had passed, because of their involvement in the Second Desmond Rebellion. The Geraldines defended the Pale from the Irish clans in the nearby Wicklow Mountains. Rathfarnham was described as a &quot;waste village&quot; when Adam Loftus bought it. It is believed the present castle was built around 1583 for then-Archbishop Loftus. The castle was not long built when in 1600 it had to withstand an attack by the Wicklow clans during the Nine Years&#x27; War.

===English Civil war===

Archbishop Loftus left the castle to his son, Dudley and it then passed in turn to his son Adam in 1616. During Adam&#x27;s ownership, the castle came under siege in the 1641 rebellion. It was able to hold out against the Confederate army when the surrounding country was overrun. Adam Loftus opposed the treaty of cessation in order to stop the fighting between the Irish Confederates and the English Royalists. Consequently, he was imprisoned in Dublin Castle.

During the subsequent Irish Confederate Wars (1641–53), the castle changed hands several times. From 1641 to 1647, it was garrisoned by English Royalist troops. In 1647, Ormonde, commander of the Royalists in Ireland, surrendered Dublin to the English Parliament and Parliamentary troops were stationed at the castle until 1649 when a few days before the Battle of Rathmines, the castle was stormed and taken without a fight by the Royalists as part of the Siege of Dublin. However, the Roundheads re-occupied it after their victory at the Battle of Rathmines. It has also been reported that Oliver Cromwell held a council there during his campaign in Ireland before going south to besiege Wexford. Adam Loftus, who recovered his castle and lands under Cromwell, sided with the Parliamentarians and was killed at the Siege of Limerick in 1651.

After the English Civil War, the Loftus family retained ownership of the castle. In 1659, Dr. Dudley Loftus, great-grandson of Archbishop Loftus, took over the castle. During his lifetime, Dudley held the posts of Commissioner of Revenue, Judge of the Court of Admiralty, Master in Chancery, representative for Kildare &amp; Wicklow in the Protectorate Parliament and MP for Naas, Bannow and Fethard (Co Wexford). His body is interred at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

===The eighteenth century===
The property then passed by marriage to Philip Wharton. The young man lost his money in the South Sea Bubble and in 1723 the castle was sold for £62,000 to the Right Hon William Conolly, speaker of the Irish House of Commons. In 1742, its leasehold was sold to Dr. Hoadly, Archbishop of Armagh, and on his death four years later it passed to his son-in-law Bellingham Boyle. In 1767, Boyle sold his interest in the property to Nicholas Hume-Loftus, second Earl of Ely, a descendant of Adam Loftus, the original builder of the castle; a small head rent to the Conolly family remained.

Nicholas died within a few years, probably as an indirect result of great hardships which he had suffered in his youth, and the estate passed to his uncle, Hon. Henry Loftus, who was created Earl of Ely in 1771. Henry Loftus, Earl of Ely, was responsible for much of the work of converting the medieval fortified house into a Georgian mansion, and employed renowned architects Sir William Chambers and James &#x27;Athenian&#x27; Stuart to carry out these works. The mullioned windows were enlarged and the battlements replaced by a coping with ornamental urns. A semi-circular extension was added to the east side and an entrance porch approached by steps, on the north. The interior was decorated in accordance with the tastes of the period and leading artists, including Angelica Kauffman were employed in the work. Writers of the period who visited the house have left extravagant descriptions of its splendour.

Henry died in 1783 and was succeeded by his nephew Charles Tottenham, who subsequently became Marquess of Ely as a reward for his vote at the time of the Union.

===The nineteenth and twentieth centuries===
In 1812, the family leased the estate to the Ropers and removed their valuable possessions to Loftus Hall in County Wexford. The lands and castle were then used for dairy farming and fell into disrepair. To quote a contemporary account from 1838:

&quot;Crossing the Dodder by a ford, and proceeding along its southern bank towards Rathfarnham, a splendid gateway at left, accounted among the best productions of that species of architecture in Ireland, invites the tourist to explore the once beautiful grounds of Rathfarnham Castle, but they are now all eloquently waste, the undulating hills covered with rank herbage, the rivulet stagnant and sedgy, the walks scarce traceable, the ice-houses open to the prying sun, the fish-pond clogged with weeds, while the mouldering architecture of the castle, and the crumbling, unsightly offices in its immediate vicinity,…The castle, so long the residence of the Loftus family, and still the property of the Marquis of Ely, subject, however, to a small chief rent to Mr. Conolly, is an extensive fabric...The great hall is entered from a terrace, by a portico of eight Doric columns, which support a dome, painted in fresco with the signs of the Zodiac and other devices. This room was ornamented with antique and modern busts, placed on pedestals of variegated marble, and has three windows of stained gloss, in one of which is an escutcheon of the Loftus arms, with quarterings finely executed. Several other apartments exhibited considerable splendour of arrangement, and contained, until lately, numerous family portraits, and a valuable collection of paintings by ancient masters. But, when it is mentioned, that this structure has been for years a public dairy, and the grounds to the extent of converted to its uses, some notion may be formed of their altered condition.&quot;
In 1852, the estate was bought by the Lord Chancellor, Francis Blackburne, whose family resided there for three generations. 

===Division of the estate===
The property developers Bailey &amp; Gibson acquired the castle in 1912 and divided up the estate. The eastern part became the Castle Golf Club, the castle and the southwestern portion were bought in 1913 by the Jesuit Order and the northwestern part was devoted to housing.

An auction of the contents of the house occurred on the 2nd of April 1913 and was conducted by Battersby and Company. The Jesuits acquired a number of the contents.

One of the Jesuits, Father O&#x27;Leary S.J. constructed a seismograph. This machine could detect earth tremors and earthquakes from anywhere in the world and for a time, Rathfarnham Castle became a source of earthquake information for the national media. Jesuits would spend part of their religious formation, the Tertianship, at Rathfarnham.

In 1986, the Jesuits sold Rathfarnham Castle but before leaving, they removed the stained glass windows, designed by Harry Clarke, from the chapel and donated some to Tullamore Catholic Church, which had been destroyed by fire in 1983. Other windows were donated to Our Lady&#x27;s Hospice in Harold&#x27;s Cross, and Temple Street Children&#x27;s Hospital in Dublin.

===Preservation===
The castle was sold to Delaware Properties in 1985 and it was feared that it was facing demolition. After immense public pressure to save the building, in 1987 it was purchased by the State and declared a National Monument. the Office of Public Works carried out extensive refurbishment throughout the castle, while keeping it open to the public during the summer months (5 May - 12 October), allowing visitors to observe conservation work, and aspects of the castle&#x27;s earlier existence uncovered during the process.

==Structures==
===Castle===
The castle consisted of a square building four stories high with a projecting tower at each corner, the walls of which were an average of thick. On the ground level are two vaulted apartments divided by a wall nearly thick which rises to the full height of the castle. On a level with the entrance hall are the 18th-century reception rooms and above this floor, the former ballroom, later converted into a chapel.

===Ely&#x27;s Arch===
In commemoration of regaining ownership and of Henry being made Earl of Ely in 1771, the Loftus family constructed another entrance for the castle in the form of a Roman Triumphal Arch.

Now usually referred to Ely&#x27;s arch, the triumphal entrance gate was constructed around 1769-1779 and appears on a 1779 map of Dublin when it is referred to as &#x27;the new gate&#x27;. Various architects have been proposed as the designer although evidence of a definitive architect is scant. It is based loosely on the Porta Portese in Rome and is made of Irish granite with a coade stone keystone.

===Palladian temple===
Not far from the Golf Club&#x27;s clubhouse was a small Palladian temple with a surrounding colonnade built of granite and brick, another relic of Lord Ely&#x27;s occupation of Rathfarnham and likely constructed in the last quarter of the 18th century. It was in disrepair but could have been restored; however, by decision of the club committee, it was demolished in 1979.

===Cromwell&#x27;s Court===
To the north of the castle was a long vaulted chamber formerly known as &quot;Cromwell&quot;&quot;’s Court&quot; or &quot;Fort&quot;. This was apparently a barn or storehouse erected as part of the castle farm and had narrow loopholes in its thick walls. In 1922, it was incorporated into a new retreat house, of which it formed the ground storey, and its character was concealed from the outside by a uniform covering of cement plaster.

<doc id="925873" wikidata="Q1432605" url="?curid=925873" title="St Stephen's Green">
<text>St Stephen&#x27;s Green () is a garden square and public park located in the city centre of Dublin, Ireland. The current landscape of the park was designed by William Sheppard. It was officially re-opened to the public on Tuesday, 27 July 1880 by Lord Ardilaun. The square is adjacent to one of Dublin&#x27;s main shopping streets, Grafton Street, and to a shopping centre named after it, while on its surrounding streets are the offices of a number of public bodies as well as a stop on one of Dublin&#x27;s Luas tram lines. It is often informally called Stephen&#x27;s Green. At , it is the largest of the parks in Dublin&#x27;s main Georgian garden squares. Others include nearby Merrion Square and Fitzwilliam Square.

The park is rectangular, surrounded by streets that once formed major traffic arteries through Dublin city centre, although traffic management changes implemented in 2004 during the course of the Luas works have greatly reduced the volume of traffic. These four bordering streets are called, respectively, St Stephen&#x27;s Green North, St Stephen&#x27;s Green South, St Stephen&#x27;s Green East and St Stephen&#x27;s Green West.

==History==

The association with St Stephen has its origins in a medieval leper hospital, now Mercer&#x27;s Hospital, dedicated to Saint Stephen on nearby Stephen Street. Until 1663, St Stephen&#x27;s Green was a marshy common on the edge of Dublin of approximately 60 acres, used for grazing. In that year Dublin Corporation, seeing an opportunity to raise much-needed revenue, decided to enclose the centre of the common and to sell land around the perimeter for building. The area was surveyed by Robert Newcomen, with the land divided into 96 plots with a green of 27 acres in the centre. The park was enclosed with a wall in 1664. Early tenants built simple two-storey houses, with much of it undeveloped on the 1728 map. By the time of John Roque&#x27;s map in 1756, the pace of building had accelerated rapidly. The houses built around the Green were rapidly replaced by new buildings in the Georgian style and by the end of the eighteenth century the Green was a place of resort for the better-off of the city. Most of the present-day landscape of the square comprises townhouses from the 18th and 19th centuries.


In 1814 control of St Stephen&#x27;s Green passed to commissioners for the local householders, who redesigned its layout and replaced the walls with railings.

After the death of Prince Albert, Queen Victoria suggested that St Stephen&#x27;s Green be renamed Albert Green and have a statue of Albert at its centre, a suggestion rejected with indignation by the Dublin Corporation and the people of the city, to the Queen&#x27;s chagrin.

Access to the Green was restricted to local residents, until 1877, when Parliament passed an Act to reopen St Stephen&#x27;s Green to the public, at the initiative of Sir A.E. Guinness, a member of the Guinness brewing family who lived at St Anne&#x27;s Park, Raheny and at Ashford Castle. He later paid for the laying out of the Green in approximately its current form, which took place in 1880, and gave it to the Corporation, as representatives of the people. By way of thanks, the city commissioned a statue of him, which faces the College of Surgeons. His brother Edward lived at Iveagh House, which his descendants gave in 1939 to the Department of External Affairs (now the Department of Foreign Affairs).

During the Easter Rising of 1916, a group of rebels made up mainly of members of the Irish Citizen Army, under the command of Commandant Michael Mallin, his second-in-command Kit Poole, and Constance Markievicz, established a position in St Stephen&#x27;s Green. They numbered between 200 and 250. They confiscated motor vehicles to establish roadblocks on the streets that surround the park, and dug defensive positions in the park itself. This approach differed from that of taking up positions in buildings, adopted elsewhere in the city. It proved to have been unwise when elements of the British Army took up positions in the Shelbourne Hotel, at the northeastern corner of St Stephen&#x27;s Green, overlooking the park, from which they could shoot down into the entrenchments. Finding themselves in a weak position, the Volunteers withdrew to the Royal College of Surgeons on the west side of the Green. During the Rising, gunfire was temporarily halted to allow the park&#x27;s groundsman to feed the local ducks.

A statue of Archibald Montgomerie, 13th Earl of Eglinton by Patrick MacDowell was erected on the North side of the green in 1866. It was destroyed in an explosion by the IRA which injured gardaí and civilians in 1958 and the remains were dismantled.

The park is now operated by the Office of Public Works (OPW) on behalf of the Irish state.

==Park==
=== Evolution of design ===

The landscaping of the park has undergone three major changes since its inception. Its first major change occurred in 1670: two rows of lime trees were planted around the perimeter, functioning as its first enclosure. The marshy ground was drained using a ditch at the perimeter. At this time, the park was only accessible to the wealthy residents who owned plots around the park. In 1815 the park was redesigned by the Dublin city surveyor Arthur Neville. In his redesign, he added winding pathways and iron fences. At this time, the park was still closed to the public.

During the 1860s, the campaign to make the park publicly accessible was underway, and the city engineer, George W. Hemans, proposed a new design to make the park as walkable and as functionally practical as possible. This included creating four gates at each corner of the park that would be linked by the extant pathways designed by Neville. This plan was eventually abandoned, most likely due to the fact that Hemans was employed by Dublin Corporation. However, many of Hemans&#x27; designs, like the addition of the gates and connecting pathways, were included in the final plans submitted by William Sheppard, the principal designer responsible for the landscape of the park as we know it today, and engineer A.L. Cousins, sponsored by Lord Ardilaun. Ardilaun also played a significant role in the planning and importing of the exotic trees and plants that would be installed in the park.

===Layout===

While the central park of St Stephen&#x27;s Green is one of three ancient commons in the city, its current layout owes much to the restorations of the 19th century. Architectural history professor Christine Casey states that this restoration obscures what would have been its most impressive feature to 18th-century visitors, its large size. The grounds are roughly rectangular, measuring (approximately) 550 by 450 metres, and are centred on a formal garden.

By 1758, the tree-lined walks around the park had been named, Beaux Walk to the north, Leeson&#x27;s Walk to the south, Monck&#x27;s Walk to the east, and French Walk to the west.
One of the more unusual aspects of the park lies on the northwest corner of this central area, a garden for the blind with scented plants, which can withstand handling, and are labelled in Braille.

Further north again (and spanning much of the length of the park) is a large lake. Home to ducks and other water fowl, the lake is fed by an artificial waterfall, spanned by O&#x27;Connell bridge, and fronted by an ornamental gazebo. The lakes in the park are fed from the Grand Canal at Portobello.

To the south side of the main garden circle is more open heath surrounding a bandstand, and often frequented by lunching students, workers and shoppers on Dublin&#x27;s sunnier days.

There is also a playground (separated into junior and senior areas) which was refurbished in 2010.

The park once featured a statue of King George II on horseback by John van Nost, erected in 1758, until it was blown up in 1937 by Irish Republicans, the day after the coronation of George VI.

Other features include:
* the Fusiliers&#x27; Arch at the Grafton Street corner which commemorates the Royal Dublin Fusiliers who died in the Second Boer War.
* a fountain representing the Three Fates inside the Leeson Street gate. The statue was designed by Joseph Wackerle in bronze in 1956. It was a gift from the German people in thanks for Irish help to refugee children following World War II. Up to five hundred children found foster homes in Ireland in a project named Operation Shamrock.
* a seated statue of Lord Ardilaun on the western side, the man who gave the Green to the city, facing the Royal College of Surgeons which he also sponsored (again, see &quot;History&quot; above)
* the W. B. Yeats memorial garden with a sculpture by Henry Moore
* a bust of James Joyce facing his former university at Newman House
* a memorial to the Fenian leader Jeremiah O&#x27;Donovan Rossa near the Grafton Street entrance
* a bronze statue at the Merrion Row corner of Theobald Wolfe Tone, the leader of the 1798 rebellion.
* a memorial to the Great Famine of 1845–1850 by Edward Delaney
* a bust of Countess Constance Markievicz on the south of the central garden (see &quot;History&quot; above)
* a statue of Robert Emmet standing opposite his birthplace (now demolished) at No 124.
* a memorial bust of war poet Thomas Kettle, who was killed in action while serving in the Royal Dublin Fusiliers during the Battle of Ginchy in September 1916. As Irish republicanism traditionally viewed Irishmen who served in the British armed forces during World War I as traitors, the placement of a commemorative bust of Kettle was beset by controversy until it was finally placed in 1937, without an official unveiling, in the centre section.
* a bust of Bengal Renaissance poet Rabindranath Tagore was erected in the park in 2011.

==Architecture==

Some of the earliest houses still survive on the south and north sides of the Green. These are identifiable by their lower height and narrow fronts, illustrating how plots were subdivided. Later buildings on the east side show a dramatic change in scale, with much larger and grander houses, many by Gustavus Hume.

&quot;Iveagh House&quot; on the south side was created from the joining of two earlier houses (numbers 80 and 81) by Benjamin Guinness in the 1860s. It was donated to the Irish State by the Guinness family in 1939, and now houses the main offices of the Department of Foreign Affairs.

Also on the south side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green are &quot;Newman House&quot; (numbers 85 and 86, after John Henry Newman) and &quot;University Church&quot;. These are home to the Catholic University of Ireland, which was founded in the 19th century. It is linked with University College Dublin, but is no longer active educationally in its own right.

The &quot;Unitarian Church&quot;, Dublin, built in the Gothic revival style, is located on the West side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green.

Also on the west side is the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (number 123), home to the oldest of the Republic of Ireland&#x27;s six medical schools.

On the west side, at the top of Grafton Street, is the Stephen&#x27;s Green Shopping Centre, built in October 1988. It was, at the time, Ireland&#x27;s largest shopping centre. Its style was intended to represent a conservatory on the side facing the Green and to mirror the brickwork design of the opposing Gaiety Theatre on South King Street.

On the north side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green, there were four houses which are now two clubs (originally gentlemen&#x27;s clubs): the &quot;Hibernian United Services Club&quot; (number 8, closed in 2002), the &quot;Stephen&#x27;s Green Hibernian Club&quot; (number 9, originally the Stephen&#x27;s Green Club, prior to its merger with the Hibernian United Services Club), the &quot;Friendly Brothers of St Patrick&quot; (number 22, now closed) and the &quot;Kildare Street and University Club&quot; (number 17). This side of the Green also has the historic &quot;Shelbourne Hotel&quot;, Dublin&#x27;s only surviving Victorian hotel. The Little Museum of Dublin, which is housed in a restored Georgian townhouse can be found in number 15.

Also on the north side, Heritage House at 23 St Stephen&#x27;s Green, was the location of a tearoom which hosted the first public Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in Ireland, on 25 November 1946.
&quot;Loreto College, St Stephen&#x27;s Green&quot;, one of Ireland&#x27;s best-known fee-paying schools for girls, is located at number 53, on the East side of the Green.

&quot;St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, now located in a suburb on the south side of Dublin, was formerly located in buildings on the East side of St Stephen&#x27;s Green and on Leeson Street. It is now the headquarters of bank PTSB.

During the mid 20th century, a number of the Georgian buildings on the Green were demolished in favour of modern office blocks. Most of the east side of the square is modern reproduction terraces in front of offices. Among the buildings that were lost was No. 21, the former St Andrew&#x27;s College, which was demolished by Irish Life in February 1969 and a new office block, Stephen Court, designed by Andrew Devane was constructed in its place. This building is deemed one of the more successful modern interventions on the Green.

==Transport==
Dublin Bus routes 7b, 7d, 11, 37, 40, 46a, 84x, 145, and 155 all have stops along the east side of the square. Routes 44, 44D, 61, X31, and X32 stop on neighbouring Earlsfort Terrace; routes 38/A/B/D, 39/A/X, 46E, 70, 116, 118, X25, X26, X27, X28, X30 stop on Leeson Street (as well as the northbound stops for routes stopping on St. Stephen&#x27;s Green East). Routes 38/A/B/D, 39/A, and 70 also have their southbound stops on Merrion Row.

The Dublin tramways once had several routes serving St. Stephen&#x27;s Green, including routes 10, 11, 12, 16, 17 and 20, but these were shut down over the 1930s and 1940s. In the 2000s, trams returned to Dublin and the Green line of the Luas tram system stops at the St Stephen&#x27;s Green stop on the western side of the park, with Luas Cross City services continuing to Broombridge station in Cabra.

A DublinBikes docking point is also located on St. Stephen&#x27;s Green East.

Toscani was born in Milan, and took up photography following in the footsteps of his father, Fedele Toscani, famous Italian photographer, founder with Vincenzo Carrese of the Publifoto photographic agency, then of his own photographic agency (Rotofoto), then photo reporter for the newspaper . After obtaining his diploma at the Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich, he started working with different magazines, including &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Uomo Vogue&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot;.

== Career ==
In 1982, Toscani started working as Art Director for the Benetton Group. One of his most famous campaigns included a photo (by Therese Frare) of David Kirby dying of AIDS, lying in a Columbus, Ohio, hospital bed, surrounded by his grieving relatives. The picture was controversial due to its similarity to a pietà painting and because critics of the ad thought the use of this image to sell clothing was exploiting the victim, though the Kirby family stated that they authorized the use and that it helped increase AIDS awareness. Other advertisements included references to racism (notably one with three almost identical human hearts, which were actually pig hearts, with the words &#x27;white&#x27;, &#x27;black&#x27;, and &#x27;yellow&#x27; as captions), war, religion and even capital punishment.

In the early 1990s, Toscani co-founded the magazine &quot;Colors&quot; (also owned by Benetton) with American graphic designer Tibor Kalman (1949-1999). With the tagline &quot;a magazine about the rest of the world&quot;, &quot;Colors&quot; built on the multiculturalism prevalent at that time and in Benetton&#x27;s ad campaigns, while remaining editorially independent from the group. Toscani left Benetton in 2000.
A long-term Tuscany resident, in 2003 he created in collaboration with Regione Toscana a new research facility for modern communication called &#x27;La Sterpaia&#x27;. In 2005, Toscani sparked controversy again with his photographs for an advertising campaign for the men&#x27;s clothing brand &#x27;Ra-Re&#x27;. Their portrayals of men participating in homosexual behaviour angered groups such as the Catholic parents&#x27; association &quot;Movimento Italiano Genitori&quot;, who called the pictures &#x27;vulgar&#x27;. The campaign came amidst ongoing debate in Italy about gay rights.

Toscani unsuccessfully stood as a candidate for parliament for the new Rose in the Fist party in the Italian general election held on 9 and 10 April 2006. In September 2007, a new campaign against anorexia was again controversial due to his shocking photography of an emaciated woman (Isabelle Caro).

When Luciano Benetton returned as executive director of the Benetton Group in January 2018, he brought along Toscani.

In 2018, Toscani became a member of Italy&#x27;s Democratic Party (PD).

In 2020, Toscani was let go from Benetton Group after he controversially said of the 2018 Ponte Morandi collapse, &quot;Who cares about a bridge collapse?&quot;. He was responding to an outcry over a photograph of founding members of a political protest movement alongside key members of the Benetton family. He later apologized for the statement.

== Illness and death ==
Toscani suffered from amyloidosis. He was hospitalised on 10 January 2025 at the Cecina Hospital, where he died on 13 January, at the age of 82.

<text>Gledhow is a suburb of north-east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, east of Chapel Allerton and west of Roundhay. It sits in the Roundhay ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds North East parliamentary constituency.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Gledhow&quot; is first attested the period 1334–37 as &quot;Gledhou&quot;. Its etymology is uncertain. The &quot;gled-&quot; element could plausibly come from the Old English words &quot;gleoda&quot; (&#x27;kite, bird of prey&#x27;) or &quot;glēd&quot; (&#x27;embers, burning coals&#x27;). The second element could be from Old English &quot;hōh&quot; (&#x27;ridge, escarpment&#x27;) or Old Norse &quot;haugr&quot; (&#x27;hill&#x27;). It has been suggested (in relation to similar names like &quot;Gledhill&quot;) that a &quot;gled-&quot; element may alternatively be based on the Old Norse ‘å glede’ (to please, or be glad about a subject) giving a translation of &quot;Pleasant Hill&quot;.

==Description and history==

Well into the 19th century, Gledhow was known as a picturesque area of woodland near Leeds. It had become a suburb of Leeds by the late 19th century. Gledhow Valley is a strip of mixed deciduous woodland on either side of a beck and lake. Gipton Spa, a bathhouse dating from 1671, is in the woods. Passing through the valley is Gledhow Valley Road, built in 1926.

Gledhow Lane crosses Gledhow Valley Road and on the eastern side is a steep road up from the valley. A residential area near the top has been referred to as &quot;Little Switzerland&quot;, although a Leeds City Council website refers to this as a &quot;former&quot; name.

==Notable people==
*Arthur Louis Aaron, Leeds&#x27; only Second World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Gledhow.
*Sir Edmund Beckett, 4th Baronet (1787–1874), railway promoter and politician, was born at Gledhow Hall.
*Albert Johanneson, professional footballer (Leeds United) lived in Gledhow Towers.
*James Kitson, 1st Baron Airedale, industrialist and MP.
*Albert Kitson, 2nd Baron Airedale, &quot;inter alia&quot; a director of Midland Bank and British peer.

==Parks and green spaces==

The Green is a small park located on the junction Gledhow Lane, Lidgett Lane and Gledhow Wood Road. It is identified in the Gledhow Valley Conservation Area Appraisal as an important green space that has been harmed by visually unsympathetic highway works.

<text>Jason Wolkow Epstein (August 25, 1928 – February 4, 2022) was an American editor and publisher. He was the editorial director of Random House from 1976 to 1995. He also co-founded &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; in 1963.

==Early life and education==
Epstein was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on August 25, 1928. His father, Robert, worked as a partner in the family textile business; his mother, Gladys (Shapiro), was a housewife. His family was Jewish. An only child, he attended public schools in Milton, Massachusetts, completing high school at age 15. He studied English literature at Columbia University, where he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1949, before obtaining a Master of Arts the following year.

==Career==
After graduating, Epstein joined Doubleday and Company as an editorial trainee, earning $45 a week. While working there, he saw the need for inexpensive, well-made paperbacks of the kinds of books that his classmates, many of them veterans studying on the GI Bill, were reading but could not afford to own in their hardcover editions. With the support of Ken McCormick, Doubleday&#x27;s chief editor, he launched Anchor Books in 1953. This was the first so-called Quality Paperbacks, which quickly became the dominant paperback format. In 1954 Anchor Books won the Carey–Thomas Award.

Epstein left Doubleday in 1958, frustrated at the company&#x27;s refusal to publish Vladimir Nabokov&#x27;s controversial novel, &quot;Lolita.&quot; He joined Random House publishers, and eventually became editorial director in 1976, serving in that capacity until 1995. At Random House, he edited such writers as Jane Jacobs, Norman Mailer, Philip Roth, Gore Vidal, Vladimir Nabokov, E. L. Doctorow, Michael Korda, Benzion Netanyahu, Peter Matthiessen, and Paul Kennedy. He also worked with Ted Geisel, better known as Dr Seuss, who arrived with storyboards to recite &quot;&quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;.&quot; He acquired a reputation of being rude and ridiculing other editors&#x27; suggestions. He admitted that he was a &quot;disagreeable presence&quot; as he had little patience with other people. Nevertheless, he continued to edit the company&#x27;s most valuable authors after being relieved of his post as editorial director in 1984.

During the New York newspaper strike of 1963, Epstein, his wife Barbara, and their friends Robert Lowell and Elizabeth Hardwick created &quot;The New York Review of Books.&quot; As he was working for Random House, he couldn&#x27;t be an editor for this as well. So they turned to their friend Robert Silvers to be its editor along with Epstein&#x27;s wife, Barbara. The New York Review of Books was a journal dedicated to serious reviewing of books. He had his list of distribution contacts from Anchor Books, and Robert Lowell invested $4,000 from his trust fund to get the company started. The first issue came out on February 1, 1963. It sold out and 2,000 letters arrived urging them to continue. Although he retired in 1999, he continued to be affiliated with the publisher and edited books into his eighties.

In 1979, Epstein took up and forwarded the critic Edmund Wilson&#x27;s concept for the Library of America, well-made, reliable editions of important American writers similar to the French Pleiade editions. With the support of the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities, the first volumes were published in 1982. He later published &quot;The Reader&#x27;s Catalogue&quot; of 40,000 titles available by mail order, an analog precursor of online book selling. In 2004, he co-founded On Demand Books, marketer of the Espresso Book Machine, which reproduces a paperback book from a digital file in a few minutes. Epstein predicted that the Espresso Book Machine will supplant the 500-year-old Gutenberg printing press technology.

== Awards ==
Epstein was the inaugural recipient of the National Book Award for Distinguished Service to American Letters in 1988. He was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award of the National Book Critics Circle in 2001, before being conferred the Philolexian Award for Distinguished Literary Achievement six years later. He also received the Curtis Benjamin Award of the Association of American Publishers for Creative Publishing.

== Publications ==

His essays and reviews have appeared in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, and &quot;Condé Nast Traveler&quot;, among other publications. He is the author of the following books:
* &quot;Book Business: Publishing Past, Present and Future&quot;. W. W. Norton &amp; Company (2001) 
* &quot;Eating: A Memoir&quot;. A. A. Knopf (2010) 
* &quot;East Hampton: A History and Guide&quot; (with Elizabeth Barlow) Random House (1985) 
* &quot;The Great Conspiracy Trial: An Essay on Law, Liberty, and the Constitution&quot;. Random House (1970) 

In his book, &quot;Book Business: Publishing Past, Present, and Future&quot;, Epstein writes about working in the New York offices of Random House. He tells of: W. H. Auden delivering the manuscript of &quot;The Dyer&#x27;s Hand&quot; in a torn overcoat and slippers; Dr. Seuss reciting &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; to the staff; Terry Southern writing scenes for &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; on a wooden table in the basement; a diffident Andy Warhol bowing and scraping to Epstein; John O&#x27;Hare showing off his Rolls-Royce in the courtyard; and Ralph Ellison smoking a cigar in Epstein&#x27;s office and using his hands to explain &quot;how Thelonious Monk developed his chords.&quot;

E.L. Doctorow&#x27;s Billy Bathgate was decidated to Epstein.

== Personal life==
Epstein married Barbara Zimmerman in 1954. They met while working at Doubleday, and their fathers knew each other. Together, they had two children: Jacob and Helen. The couple divorced in 1990. Three years later, he married Judith Miller, a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and daughter of impresario Bill Miller. They remained married until his death.

Epstein died on February 4, 2022, at his home in Sag Harbor, New York. He was 93, and suffered from congestive heart failure prior to his death.

<text>Aššur-etil-ilāni, also spelled Ashur-etel-ilani&#x27; andAshuretillilani(, meaning &quot;[[Ashur (god)|Ashur]] is the lord of the Tree&quot;),&#x27; was the king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from 631 BC to 627 BC. Aššur-etil-ilāni is an obscure figure with a brief reign from which few inscriptions survive. Because of this lack of sources, very little concrete information about the king and his reign can be deduced.

It is possible that Aššur-etil-ilāni was a weak ruler as there are no records of the king ever undertaking a military campaign or going on a hunt, activities previous Assyrian kings would famously do very often; this, in turn, may have helped to entice some of Assyria&#x27;s vassals, such as the Kingdom of Judah, to break free from Assyrian control and begin to act independently. Aššur-etil-ilāni was succeeded by his brother Sîn-šar-iškun under uncertain, though not necessarily violent, circumstances.

== Background and chronology ==
There is a distinct lack of available sources in regards to the last few years of Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign and the reign of Aššur-etil-ilāni. The annals of Ashurbanipal, the primary sources for his reign, go no further than 636 BC.&quot;&quot; Although Ashurbanipal&#x27;s final year is often repeated as 627 BC,&#x27; this follows an inscription at Harran made by the mother of the Neo-Babylonian king Nabonidus nearly a century later. The final contemporary evidence for Ashurbanipal being alive and reigning as king is a contract from the city of Nippur made in 631 BC.&#x27; To get the attested lengths of the reigns of his successors to match, most scholars agree that Ashurbanipal either died, abdicated or was deposed in 631 BC. Of the three options, a death in 631 BC is the most accepted. If Ashurbanipal&#x27;s reign would have ended in 627 BC, the inscriptions of his successors Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun in Babylon, covering several years, would have been impossible since the city was seized by the Neo-Babylonian king Nabopolassar in 626 BC to never again fall into Assyrian hands.

Ashurbanipal had named his successor as early as 660 BC, when documents referencing a crown prince were written. He had been the father of at least one son, and probably two, early on in his reign. These early sons were likely Aššur-etil-ilāni and Sîn-šar-iškun. The common assumption that Aššur-etil-ilāni came to the throne at a young age is based on the phrase &quot;my father did not rear me&quot; (&quot;rear&quot; meaning to care for someone until they&#x27;re fully grown), found in one of his inscriptions. However, the same phrase appears in a prayer by Ashurbanipal and Aššur-etil-ilāni is unlikely to have been very young as he is attested to have had male children during his reign.&quot;&quot;

== Reign ==
Aššur-etil-ilāni ascended the throne after the death of his father Ashurbanipal in 631 BC.&#x27; A land grant from Aššur-etil-ilāni to his (a general serving him since he was a young boy) Sîn-šumu-līšir suggests that Ashurbanipal died a natural death.&#x27; As in many other successions in Assyrian history, Aššur-etil-ilāni&#x27;s rise to the Assyrian throne was initially met with opposition and unrest.&#x27; The same land grant to Sîn-šumu-līšir references the actions of an Assyrian official called Nabu-riḫtu-uṣur who with the help of another official, Sîn-šar-ibni, attempted to usurp the Assyrian throne. Sin-shum-lishir probably assisted the king with stopping Nabu-riḫtu-uṣur and Sîn-šar-ibni.&#x27; As no sources indicate the opposite, the conspiracy appears to have been crushed relatively quickly.&#x27; Excavations at Nineveh from the time around Ashurbanipal&#x27;s death show fire damage, indicating that the plot perhaps resulted in some violence and unrest within the capital itself.&#x27;

The spread of inscriptions by Aššur-etil-ilāni in Babylonia suggest that he exercised the same amount of control in the southern provinces as his father Ashurbanipal had, having a vassal king (Kandalanu) but exercising actual political and military power there himself. His inscriptions are known from all the major cities, including Babylon, Dilbat, Sippar and Nippur.&#x27; Too few inscriptions of Aššur-etil-ilāni survive to make any certain assumptions about his character. Excavations of his palace at Kalhu, one of the more important cities in the empire and a former capital, may indicate that he was less boastful than his father as it had no reliefs or statues similar to those that his predecessors had used to illustrate their strength and success.&#x27; The lack of such depictions may partly be because there are no records of Aššur-etil-ilāni ever conducting a military campaign or going on a hunt. His Kalhu palace was quite small with unusually small rooms by Assyrian royal standards.&#x27; It is possible that some of Assyria&#x27;s vassals used the reign of what they perceived to be a weak ruler to break free of Assyrian control and even attack Assyrian outposts. In 628 BC, Josiah, ostensibly an Assyrian vassal and the king of Judah in the Levant, extended his land so that it reached the coast, capturing the city of Ashdod and settling some of his own people there.&#x27;

It is frequently assumed, without any supporting evidence, that Aššur-etil-ilāni&#x27;s brother Sîn-šar-iškun fought with him for the throne.&#x27; Although the exact circumstances of Aššur-etil-ilāni&#x27;s death and the rise of his brother Sîn-šar-iškun to the throne are unknown, there is no evidence to suggest that Aššur-etil-ilāni was deposed and/or killed in a coup.&#x27;

<doc id="925887" wikidata="Q467383" url="?curid=925887" title="Peter Withe">
<text>Peter Withe (; born 30 August 1951) is an English former football manager and striker who played between 1971 and 1990. At Nottingham Forest he won the Anglo-Scottish Cup and Second Division promotion in 1976–77, First Division and the Football League Cup in 1977–78, and the 1978 FA Charity Shield. After a spell at Newcastle it was back to more success at Aston Villa with whom he won the First Division 1980–81, going on to score the only goal in the 1982 European Cup final and also win the 1982 European Super Cup. He played for England 11 times, scoring once, and was a squad member at the 1982 FIFA World Cup.

After his playing career, Withe worked as a manager, predominantly in Southeast Asia.

==Playing career==
===Style of play===
Withe was a big, tall, strong, powerful and imposing centre-forward. Dangerous in the air, his ability to shield the ball was also an asset to teammates. His biggest successes were when paired with a sharp, quick strike partner.

===Club career===
====Early career====
He began his career at Southport but left in 1971 after a handful of appearances. Late that year he made an appearance for the reserve team of Preston North End but soon moved on to Barrow for whom he made one appearance (against his former club Southport on 1 January 1972). After this he played in South Africa.

Withe played for Wolverhampton Wanderers in two seasons from 1973. In 17 league games he scored three goals.

During the summer of 1975, Withe spent one season in the United States as a member of the expansion Portland Timbers of the North American Soccer League (NASL). He scored 17 goals and added 7 assists in 22 games, leading the Timbers to first place in their division, and tied for the best record in the league at 16–6. Withe&#x27;s goals that summer made him a Timbers fan favourite, who nicknamed him &quot;The Mad Header&quot; and &quot;The Wizard of Nod&quot;. In August the Timbers played two home play-off games in front of more than 30,000 fans each, numbers unheard of for US soccer at the time. They advanced to Soccer Bowl &#x27;75, the League Championship final, in San Jose, California on 24 August, where they lost to the Tampa Bay Rowdies 2–0.

Withe returned to the West Midlands to join Birmingham City in 1975. He scored nine goals in 35 league games in just over a season before departing early in the 1976/77 season.

====Nottingham Forest====
Brian Clough joined Nottingham Forest as manager in January 1975. In the summer of 1976 he was joined by Peter Taylor, who had been his assistant at Derby County in winning the 1971–72 Football League. From Taylor&#x27;s arrival Forest immediately went into upswing. Forest signed the 25-year-old Withe to make his debut for the club on 25 September 1976. He scored on his debut in a 5–1 Football League Second Division home win v Carlisle United with strike partner John O&#x27;Hare also scoring. Withe was given a new strike partner on 3 November 1976 in an Anglo-Scottish Cup 2–0 win at Ayr United. Tony Woodcock was recalled to the first team, bringing speed and anticipation to the front two to complement Withe&#x27;s height, strength and power. Withe and Woodcock both scored at Ayr. Withe ended the season as the club top scorer with 19 goals and Woodcock second with 17 and Forest&#x27;s Player of the Year despite his November seasonal debut. Forest&#x27;s first trophy of the Clough and Taylor regime was in December that season beating Orient over two legs in the Anglo-Scottish Cup final. Withe played in the 1–1 first leg away draw on 13 December 1976 but then spent two weeks out the side missing the 4–0 second leg win. Forest won promotion at the end of the season to the top tier from finishing third in Division Two.

Withe and Woodcock won the 1977–78 Football League First Division and 1977–78 Football League Cup with Forest. They ended the season as Forest&#x27;s joint top scorers with 19 goals each. Withe scored in the 1978 FA Charity Shield 5–0 win against Ipswich Town on 12 August 1978. After playing in the 1–1 league home draw the week after against Tottenham Hotspur, Forest agreed to sell him for £225,000 just before his 27th birthday at the end of that month. Withe scored 39 goals in 99 competitive first team games for Forest. This included 28 goals in 75 league games. His place in the next three games was given to league debutant Steve Elliott; all of them ended goalless. The number 9 jersey was then given to 22-year-old Garry Birtles who promptly became a regular first choice, winning the European Cup with Forest in this season and the following one.

====Newcastle United====
Withe joined Newcastle United then in the Second Division for a transfer fee of £225,000. He debuted in a 1–1 home draw v Luton Town In just under two seasons he scored 25 goals in 76 league games.

====Aston Villa====
Ron Saunders took him to Aston Villa on the eve of the 1980–81 season when the Birmingham club paid £500,000 for the club&#x27;s record signing at the time. He was 29 at the end of the month that league season started. Withe was paired with Gary Shaw whose pace and anticipation gave Withe a strike partner with playing similarities to Tony Woodcock when Withe was at Forest. Withe won a trophy in each of his first three seasons at Villa Park. Withe scored 20 times in 36 games to finish joint-top scorer in the league with Tottenham Hotspur&#x27;s Steve Archibald in that first season as Aston Villa won the Football League title. Withe and Spurs&#x27; Mark Falco both scored twice sharing the 1981 FA Charity Shield from a 2–2 draw.

Withe scored the only goal in the 1982 European Cup final win against Bayern Munich. The season after Withe played in the 1982 European Super Cup 3–1 aggregate win against FC Barcelona.

He scored 90 goals in over 200 games for Villa. After five years he eventually moved on in what he later described as &quot;the biggest wrench of my career.&quot;

====Later career====
He joined Sheffield United scoring 18 goals in 74 league games in three seasons from 1985 to 1988. In his last season there he scored twice in eight league games on loan back at ex-club, Birmingham City. He ended his senior playing days scoring once in 38 league games at Huddersfield Town between 1988 and 1990.

===International===
His England debut was in a 1–0 home friendly defeat by Brazil on 12 May 1981. His first four England caps were all without victory with a draw with Wales and defeats by Scotland and Norway. Capped by England 11 times, Withe scored once, and was the first Aston Villa player to be selected in an England World Cup Finals squad (in Spain 1982). His goal was against Hungary on 27 April 1983 in his 7th cap. His last cap was on 14 November 1984 when Turkey were beaten 8–0. Withe ended his international career with 5 wins, 3 draws and 3 defeats.

==Managerial career==
Withe returned to Aston Villa in a coaching capacity in January 1991. During this time, he also made one playing appearance for Villa&#x27;s reserve team.

Withe had a brief spell as manager of Wimbledon, being brought in from the position of reserve team coach at Aston Villa in October 1991 following Ray Harford&#x27;s resignation. Withe&#x27;s time in charge was not at all successful, winning only one game out of thirteen in the league, and after many players expressed their dislike of his methods, he was dismissed after just 105 days at the helm and replaced by the club&#x27;s youth team coach Joe Kinnear.

Withe went into management and, after propelling the Thailand national team towards some success, managed Indonesia until 18 January 2007. He was sacked due to his side&#x27;s inability to go past the first round of the ASEAN Football Championship, the tournament which he previously won with Thailand in 2000 and 2002, then finished as the runner-up with Indonesia in 2004. He was given a brief touchline ban as manager of Thailand for wearing shorts during an international match against the United Arab Emirates. The head of the Thai Football Association said he should be wearing a suit.

He managed English non-league club Stockport Sports from April to November 2012.

==Family==
His brother, Chris, played for Bradford City.
Withe&#x27;s son, Jason, also became a footballer, coach and manager.

<doc id="925890" wikidata="Q5167166" url="?curid=925890" title="Cookridge">
<text>Cookridge is a suburb of north-west Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, north of the Leeds Outer Ring Road. In 1715 Ralph Thoresby described it as a village four miles from Leeds and three from Otley, dating from 1540.

A mixture of suburban and council owned properties on the border with Holt Park and Tinshill, the area sits in both the Adel &amp; Wharfedale ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds North West parliamentary constituency. Before 2004, the area sat within Cookridge ward, named after the area.

Nearby places include Adel, Holt Park, Tinshill, Horsforth, Bramhope, Moor Grange and Ireland Wood.

Cookridge is one of the highest points in Leeds, with the elevation rising to above sea level close to the water tower on the eastern edge of the suburb.

Cookridge holds an annual scarecrow festival hosted by the Leeds Modernians.

== Geography ==
Cookridge is located in the foothills of the eastern Pennines. Elevation ranges from above sea level close to Moseley Beck behind Horsforth railway station to above sea level by the water tower. Because of its higher elevation it experiences a cooler, windier and wetter climate compared to many other parts of Leeds, and is very exposed to easterly winds. The Beast from the East in February/March 2018 brought heavy snowfall and severe drifting to the area.

==Etymology==
The name of Cookridge is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Cucheric&quot;. The second element of the name is agreed to come from an Old English word *&quot;ric&quot; (&#x27;narrow strip of land&#x27;), attested only in place-names. The origin of the first element is less certain: it could perhaps be from an otherwise unattested personal name, inferred to have been *&quot;Cuca&quot;, or from a variant of the attested word &quot;cwica&quot; (&#x27;quickset hedge, hedge grown from (hawthorn) cuttings&#x27;). Thus the name might once have meant &#x27;Cuca&#x27;s narrow strip of land&#x27; and &#x27;narrow strip of land demarcated by a quickset hedge&#x27;).

==History and buildings==
The area had the natural geographic boundaries of the Moseley Beck on the West and South, the Marsh Beck to the North, and the old trackway to the East, running roughly North-South along the line of Spen Lane. A Roman road passing East-West was excavated in 1966 going through Golden Acre Park, south of Marsh Beck. The area later became part of the Kingdom of Elmet, being conquered by the Angles in the 7th century, leading to the Old English name that survives to the present. It was the Danes in the 9th century who named the nearby hill &quot;Tyndr&#x27;s Hill&quot;, now Tinshill.

In the Domesday Book it was listed as the manor of Cucheric, with farmland enough for two ploughs and woodland of 9 square furlongs (36 hectares). In the 12th century, the lands were granted to the monks of Kirkstall Abbey, and in the 13th century the manor became a &quot;vill&quot; or township, part of Cugerig and Adel. The monastery lands were confiscated by Henry VIII and sold off from 1540; this included Cookridge Grange, the site of the present Cookridge Hall.

==Cookridge Hall==
Early buildings on the Cookridge Hall estate were of wood, thatch, wattle etc., but in the 17th century substantial stone buildings, several which are still in existence, began to be constructed including Cookridge Hall itself. In the early 20th century James Arthur Paul – later of Bramhope Hall – was living with his father, William Paul at Cookridge Hall.
===Middleton family===
James Paul&#x27;s daughter, Muriel Winifred Middleton &quot;née&quot; Paul (1904–1979), had married Major Arthur Daryl Middleton in 1933. A large pond named Paul&#x27;s Pond remains on the Cookridge Estate, having been named after the grandfather of Muriel Winifred Middleton, William Paul, who had purchased the hall and some of the estate land in 1890. 

The builders of Cookridge Hall used &quot;rough rock&quot; or boulders which still are still found in the landscape or quarried in fields known as &quot;quarrels&quot;. In the 18th century, Cookridge Hall was substantially remodelled, and many other buildings were improved, with stone replacing thatch. At this time the road through Cookridge became busier with coaches from 1754 and earned money as a turnpike. Milestones and mounting stones from the period still survive. There were also more mills along Moseley Beck, notably the Silk Mill (demolished 1978) which gave its name to modern housing estate. The Hall, which dates from , along with its flanking screen walls, gate piers and gates, is a Grade II listed building. It was a home for people with epilepsy from 1955 to 1990 and in 1997 was opened by the Lord Mayor of Leeds as a leisure club with a golf course.

In the 19th century a new road was constructed (now the A660 Otley Road), and the Bramhope Tunnel dug by Moseley farm for a rail line going north from Leeds to Harrogate. A large house called Cookridge Lodge and a tower added. It was demolished in 1970 to make way for an estate, but the gatepost and some outbuildings survive. The Cookridge Estate was bought by Richard Wormald in 1820 and land was sold in portions by his descendant Francis Wormald in the 1920s. In 1926 Cookridge became part of Leeds and the building of Cookridge village began in 1927 with a triangle of houses between Cookridge Lane, Moseley Wood Lane and Green Lane. This was largely under the direction of architect Cecil Crowther and his builder brothers, taking advantage of subsidies from the Housing Acts of 1923–1925. Mavis Lane and Mavis Avenue are named after Cecil Crowther&#x27;s daughter. Crowther acted as estate agent and produced a 1930 brochure entitled &quot;Cookridge – Village of Youth&quot; extolling its virtues for newly-weds. This included a map showing 135 plots of an area largely bounded by Cookridge Lane to the east, Moseley Wood Lane to the south, and Cookridge Avenue to the north-west. There were six firms of builders, with different styles. Sporadic building continued, but it was after the Second World War that the majority of the estates were constructed, starting with 1948 Iveson and Ireland Wood; 1952 Tinshill, Silkmill and Woodnook; 1957 Moseley Wood; 1973 Holt Park; 1980 Spring Wood. As the names suggest, these made major encroachments into woodland.

The water-tower was built in 1929 to supply Cookridge village on one of the highest points in Leeds at 198m (650 feet) above sea level. Near the water-tower is Tinshill BT Tower (also known as Cookridge Tower), a prominent landmark.

==Sport==
Cookridge has three sports clubs: Cookridge Cricket Club, 
Cookridge Hall Golf Club, and the Leeds Modernians Sports Club 
which has football, rugby and cricket teams. Bannatyne Group acquired Cookridge Hall in 2019.

==Cookridge Hospital==
Cookridge Hospital opened in 1869 as a &#x27;Hospital for the Convalescent Poor in Leeds&#x27;. It was built in a secluded area by clearing away part of Ireland Wood, with a new road, Hospital Lane from Otley Old Road. The main building and the lodge, designed by Norman Shaw in 1868, are Grade II listed buildings. A further wing was added in 1893, the &quot;Edward Jackson Memorial Ward&quot;. In 1888 a second set of buildings were opened, the &quot;Ida Hospital&quot;, named in memory of Ida North, by her father John North. A further similar set of buildings were opened in 1905 named after the benefactor as &quot;Robert Arthington Hospital&quot;.

The buildings mainly functioned as longer-term convalescent facilities for patients treated in other Leeds hospitals, and were used for the care of wounded servicemen during both World Wars. The whole complex was taken over by the Government in 1939 and part used as a maternity hospital until 1942. In 1952 it became part of the NHS. A &#x27;High Energy Radiation Centre&#x27;, providing treatment of tumours opened in 1956. From then on it developed into a major regional centre for radiotherapy, with the Ida and Robert Arthington Hospitals becoming home to the Yorkshire Regional Cancer Organization in 1994.

In 2007 it closed and all facilities were transferred to the St James&#x27;s Oncology Unit (Bexley Wing) of Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust.
Much of the site was used for housing from 2010, with the listed building being retained for future development. The Robert Arthington Hospital was refurbished and opened in 2015 as the Lighthouse School for pupils with autistic spectrum conditions.

==Religion==
The Church of England parish church was formerly that of St John the Baptist Church, Adel until Holy Trinity, a brick building on Green Lane, was constructed in 1961. Cookridge Methodist Church is a brick building on the junction of Tinshill Road and Otley Old Road. Grace Community Church meets at Cookridge Village Hall.
==Education==
The main primary schools in Cookridge are Holy Trinity Church of England (Aided) Primary School and Cookridge Primary School.

==Notable people==
* Nick Hodgson, former drummer of the Kaiser Chiefs, was born here.

<doc id="925894" wikidata="Q4937018" url="?curid=925894" title="Bodymoor Heath">
<text>Bodymoor Heath is a small village in the North Warwickshire district of the county of Warwickshire in England, situated on, and with a bridge over, the Birmingham and Fazeley Canal close to the much larger village of Kingsbury.

== History ==
Bodymoor Heath was originally a separate village but later became inclosed as a part of the parish of Kingsbury. Bodymoor Heath was the centre of a High Court of Chancery case of &quot;Barker v. Barker&quot; where it was held that the husband of a daughter who had inherited her father&#x27;s lands in Bodymoor Heath, was not entitled to any dividend just through curtesy. The village later came into the ownership of the twice Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel along with the surrounding Kingsbury parish. The village is located near the planned route of the High Speed 2 railway line. The route passes through the Bodymoor Heath Training Ground, which necessitated Aston Villa to relocate a number of their facilities and pitches away from the planned route. Bodymoor Heath has a pub. The pub is called the Dog and Doublet. It was constructed in 1786 but did not become a pub until 1835. The pub was granted grade II listed status in 1981 by English Heritage. It also has a grade II listed bridge.

== Aston Villa ==

Bodymoor Heath is also the home of Aston Villa Football Club&#x27;s Bodymoor Heath Training Ground. The land it was built on was purchased in the 1970s by Aston Villa&#x27;s chairman Doug Ellis from a local farmer. It was redeveloped in the 1990s after criticism of under-investment by the Villa manager John Gregory.

<doc id="925895" wikidata="Q5643625" url="?curid=925895" title="Halton, Leeds">
<text>Halton is a district of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, situated between Cross Gates to the north, Halton Moor to the west, Colton to the east and Whitkirk to the South. Temple Newsam lies directly south of the estate.

The area falls into the Temple Newsam ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds East parliamentary constituency.

==Etymology==
The name of Halton is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the forms &quot;Halletun&quot; and &quot;Halletune&quot;. The name comes from the Old English words &quot;halh&quot; (&#x27;nook, corner of land&#x27;) and &quot;tūn&quot; (&#x27;farm, estate&#x27;), and thus once meant &#x27;estate in a corner of land&#x27;.

The parish also contains Halton Deans, first attested in the period 1170–90 in Latin or French form, as &quot;denam de Haleton&quot;, and in English form in the same century as &quot;Haletun dene&quot; and variants thereof. The &quot;deans&quot; element here comes from the Old English word &quot;denu&quot; (&#x27;valley&#x27;); the &quot;-s&quot; appears to have been added after the medieval period.

==History==

Halton was originally developed as a village on the main road linking Leeds and Selby. Development immediately before and after the Second World War, saw Halton grow substantially into a suburb of Leeds.

St Wilfrid&#x27;s Church in Halton is a grade II* listed church built in 1939 at a cost of £11,700 and designed by A. Randall Wells. The church is in the Arts and Crafts style and still has many of the original fittings designed by Wells as well as contemporary art by Eric Gill.

==Demographics==
Halton is a suburban area of mainly owner-occupied housing of which almost three-quarters is semi detached or detached. The area compares favourably with Leeds as a whole in relation to indicators of deprivation, with relatively low levels of crime and anti-social behaviour, low levels of households in receipt of means-tested and out-of-work benefits and high levels of educational attainment. The area has a low level of people from BME backgrounds.

==Local facilities and attractions==

The main Public Houses of Halton were the Irwin Arms (now demolished), The Travellers Rest (now demolished) and The Woodman.

There is a Lidl, Tesco Express and Fultons supermarkets.

The local Primary School is named Templenewsam Halton Primary School, with Whitkirk Primary also being within the local area.

The area is to the east of Leeds city centre and is close to the A63 dual carriageway.

<text>Gold Mountain Records was a record label based in New York. It was distributed by A&amp;M Records between 1983 and 1985. After 1985, the distributor was MCA Records.

In 1985, the president of the label was Danny Goldberg. Goldberg founded an anti-censorship group called the Musical Majority to counter the call for rock and roll records with explicit lyrics to have warning labels.

Notable releases include Bruce Cockburn&#x27;s &quot;Stealing Fire&quot;, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; by Keel, and The Textones&#x27; &quot;Midnight Mission&quot;.

Gold Mountain Records changed its name in 1987 to Gold Castle Records.

<text>Gold Castle Records was an American record label. It was co-owned by music industry veteran Danny Goldberg and Julian Schlossberg (co-producer/co-director of the live music film &quot;No Nukes&quot;). The label&#x27;s name is formed from the first halves of each of the co-founders&#x27; surnames: &quot;Gold&quot; from Goldberg and &quot;Castle&quot; from Schlossberg, Schloss being the German word for castle. The general manager of Gold Castle was Paula Jeffries, a former executive at Windham Hill.

Its records were distributed by PolyGram, then CEMA of EMI. The label&#x27;s roster included Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Peter, Paul and Mary, Eliza Gilkyson, and Eric Andersen. Most of them were without record deals before signing to Gold Castle. Don McLean had two albums on the label in 1989 and 1990. Although most of the artists were established, the roster also included Greenwich Village 1980s folk act, the Washington Squares, who released two records, as well as Darius Degher (aka Darius), who released one album.

<doc id="925910" wikidata="Q7993677" url="?curid=925910" title="Whinmoor">
<text>Whinmoor is a residential area of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England.

It is 5 miles (8 km) to the north-east of the city centre and adjacent to Swarcliffe and Seacroft in the LS14 Leeds postcode area.

Historically, the area was within the Tadcaster Rural District until 1974. It is today situated in the Leeds City Council ward of Cross Gates and Whinmoor and Leeds East parliamentary constituency.

==History==
In November 655 AD (or perhaps in 654, according to one interpretation of the chronology), the Battle of the Winwaed took place around the Whinmoor/Cock Beck/Swarcliffe area, with the Christian King Oswiu of Bernicia&#x27;s army defeating the pagan army of King Penda of Mercia, although historians admit that few details are available. A road to the south of Whinmoor was later named Penda&#x27;s Way.

In addition, during the First English Civil War, the Battle of Seacroft Moor, 30 March 1643, was fought over the two moors of Winn Moor and Bramham Moor, near Leeds. There is no exact records of Army positions, due to the amount of movement during the battle. As Sir Thomas Fairfax was instructed to capture Tadcaster, the Royalist Northern major-general, Sir William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne planned to intercept the smaller opposition. He sent his Lieutenant-General, Lord George Goring to do so; leading a large force of Horse. Fairfax had a problem, due to having a force made up of mainly clubmen (Locally recruited soldiers) and only three troops of Cavalry; this was going to be a &#x27;wake-up-call&#x27; for the Parliamentary forces in the North. He was literally &#x27;thrashed&#x27; by Goring, beaten back over the moor, with many casualties. Fairfax escaped with just some of his surviving Horse to Leeds, mainly because of bad communication in the ranks. Fairfax quoted that it was &quot;the greatest loss we ever received&quot;.

==Crime==
Crime in Whinmoor has slowly decreased, although there are still reported crimes of drug dealing and car theft.

In October 2022, 322 Crimes reported, of which Whinmoor Way, Baildon Close and Farndale Garth had the highest crime reported on streets, with 19, 12 and 11 crimes committed respectively.

==Other information==

Whinmoor was often mistaken as a part of Seacroft. Since the development came in the early 1970s, the name was adopted and entered formal use. It formerly had a large proportion of council housing, of which most are now privately owned.

Until 2010, the area was part of the Elmet constituency. Colin Burgon served as the Member of Parliament for the area for 13 years having defeated the long-serving Conservative MP, Spencer Batiste, in 1997. It now sits within the Leeds East constituency, which includes Cross Gates, Whinmoor, Seacroft, Gipton, Harehills, Killingbeck, Temple Newsam, Halton Moor, Halton, Whitkirk, Colton and Austhorpe. The current MP is Labour&#x27;s Richard Burgon.

Whinmoor was also the eastern terminus for First Leeds’ “overground” St. James’ Line: 16, 16a and 56 running to Whinmoor bus terminus.

Unilever Leeds is on Coal Road joined with the larger Seacroft Industrial Estate going from the Ramshead and Monskwood areas of Seacroft to the Naburn area of Whinmoor, with the B6902 (formerly the A6120 Ring Road) running through the middle.

Leeds City Council purchased Whinmoor from the Tadcaster Rural District Council to build homes as an extension of the Seacroft housing development. In the early 1960s the council had planned to build 5,000 dwellings, a small shopping centre and other amenities with a pedestrian link to Seacroft.

New homes have been built off of the A64 York Road, near the now closed Old Red Lion, by Strata proving 2-5 bedroomed affordable housing for Leeds’ growing housing demand. As well as a new houses built on the old Unilever car park, adjacent to the Seacroft Industrial Estate, between the B6902 and Coal Road built by Redrow.

The new construction of the East Leeds Orbital Road and road improvements to the old Ring Road (B902) will provide more change in the coming years, bringing an additional 52,000 new homes across East Leeds, and up to 18,000 new homes in Whinmoor alone as a part of the Whinmoor Fields area (Northern Quadrant of the East Leeds Extension).

<text>Coastal Transport Limited (Coastal Transport) is a ferry company operating in eastern Canada on the Bay of Fundy with headquarters in Saint John, New Brunswick. The company began as a wholly owned subsidiary of Marine Atlantic Incorporated (MAI), and in April 1997 was sold to Murray O. Ryder, the former MAI Vice President of Operations.

Coastal Transport is a member of the Tourism Industry Association of New Brunswick (TIANB).

==Operations==

The vessels Coastal Transport operates and manages are owned by the New Brunswick Department of Transportation and Infrastructure.

Coastal Transport operates a year-round ferry service in Atlantic Canada which include:

* Blacks Harbour to Grand Manan Island Ferry - The Grand Manan Adventure (2011–present), and the Grand Manan V (1990–present) currently being used on this route. The route runs between Blacks Harbour on the mainland to North Head on Grand Manan Island. The ferry crosses the Bay of Fundy, linking Mainland New Brunswick in West Isles Parish in Blacks Harbour at the southern terminus of New Brunswick Route 176 to the largest island in New Brunswick at the northern terminus of New Brunswick Route 776 in the neighbourhood of North Head on the east side of Grand Manan Island. The crossing is in length, takes 1.5 hours, and is priced based per vehicle and persons. The two ferries provide service on the route, carrying up to 82 cars at a time. Service is provided year-round, with ferries operating at least hourly between 0600 and 2200, and half-hourly for most of the day. The service is operated by the New Brunswick Department of Transportation, and during the winter months provides the only public route access to Grand Manan Island.
* Grand Manan Island to White Head Island Ferry - The William Frankland is currently being used for this route. The route runs between Ingalls Head on Grand Manan Island and White Head Island.
*L&#x27;Etete to Deer Island Ferry - The Deer Island Princess II and the John E. Rigby are currently being used for this route. The route runs between L&#x27;Etete on the mainland and Deer Island. The ferry crosses Passamaquoddy Bay, linking Mainland New Brunswick in Saint George Parish south of L&#x27;Etete at the southern terminus of New Brunswick Route 172 to the largest island of the West Isles Parish, New Brunswick at the northern terminus of New Brunswick Route 772 north of Stuart Cove on the east side of Deer Island . The crossing is in length, takes 20 minutes, and is free of tolls. The two ferries provide service on the route, carrying up to 24 cars at a time. Service is provided year-round, with ferries operating at least hourly between 0600 and 2200, and half-hourly for most of the day. The service is operated by the New Brunswick Department of Transportation, and during the winter months provides the only road access to Deer Island.

==Staff==

Murray Ryder is the President of the company and his son, Gregg, is the General Manager. Murray was formerly the vice-president (Fundy and PEI region) for Marine Atlantic (1990-1996) before purchasing Coastal Transport from them in 1997. Both the Ryders have been very active in the Canadian Ferry Operators Association (CFOA). Murray has held various positions including Vice-President (1997-1999), Secretary-Treasurer (2006), and Treasurer (2007–2008). In 2009 he was replaced by his son, Gregg, who continues to serve as an Executive Member as Treasurer (2009-2014), and as a Member-At-Large. In 2012, he spoke at the CFOA annual conference on the topic &quot;Strategic Infrastructure Investments: Fundy Islands Ferry Services.&quot;

In 2011, despite having an annual budget of close to $10 million, Gregg (then being referred to as the Director of Finance) denied that the business was very profitable. In an interview with &quot;Canadian Sailings&quot;, he stated: &quot;There is not a lot of money to be made... We are basically paid a management fee to operate the vessels for the government.&quot;

Blacks Harbour Branch Manager Morris Harris became a minor Maritime internet celebrity when his custom outhouse was stolen from his hunting camp. The company was also in the news in December 2015, when staff helped a passenger delivery a baby during the voyage.

==Fleet==
&quot;MS Grand Manan Adventure&quot; has a car capacity of 82, a passenger capacity of 360, a gross tonnage of 6580 and a net tonnage of 1974. First registered in 2011, she is in length, in breadth and in depth. &quot;MS Grand Manan V&quot; has a car capacity of 65, a passenger capacity of 300, a gross tonnage of 3833 and a net tonnage of 2935. First registered in 1990, she is in length, in breadth and in depth. The two ferries are both propeller driven.

&quot;Deer Island Princess II&quot; has a car capacity of 24, a passenger capacity of 99, a gross tonnage of 335 and a net tonnage of 95. First registered in 2001, she is in length, in breadth and in depth. &quot;John E. Rigby&quot; has a car capacity of 17, a passenger capacity of 30, a gross tonnage of 231 and a net tonnage of 227. First registered in 1976, she is in length, in breadth and in depth. The two ferries are both propeller driven.

==The Grand Manan Adventure==

In 2009, the Government of New Brunswick announced a plan to replace the Grand Manan V. The Transportation Minister at the time, Denis Landry, stated that four shipyards submitted five proposals. The Panama, Florida-based Eastern Shipbuilding Group Inc. won a $65 million contract to build the vessel, an 82-car ferry. Grand Manan residents were invited to participate in a contest to name the new vessel, and a panel of local residents reviewed the entries and made the selection. The winning name was the Grand Manan Adventure, and was submitted by Deborah Avery. For submitting the winning entry, she was also awarded a spot for herself and three guests on the vessel&#x27;s maiden voyage, along with certificates and a plaque. The Adventure is a 281-foot, single-ended roll-on, roll-off ferry that can accommodate 82 cars or 10 full-size tractor trailers in four vehicle lanes, and a maximum of 380 people. The vessel, one of the largest ferries to be constructed by Eastern Shipbuilding, was to delivered in July 2011. The Adventure&#x27;s maiden voyage was on August 11, 2011. It departed Black&#x27;s Harbour at 11 a.m. with about 200 invited guests aboard, including then-Premier David Alward.

However, the new vessel has been plagued with problems from the outset:
*On July 26, 2011, during sea trials in Florida, the ferry overheated due to a pipe failure; subsequent repairs delayed the intended delivery date by several weeks.
*On August 15, 2011, four days after its maiden voyage, the ferry began experiencing electrical issues, which manifested themselves in the failure of the bow thrusters, one after the other, following docking. It was returned to service on August 18, but was returned to dry dock on September 11 for 10 days of additional repairs. These repairs were covered by warranty.
*On October 5, 2011 (shortly after being returned to service), the ferry experienced further engine problems, forcing it to dock on October 6, 2011. A broken bolt caused problems with one of the cylinders, requiring extensive repairs. It remained out of service until October 25.
*On March 31, 2012, the ferry broke down due to a faulty seal and remained out of service for nine days.
*On July 22, 2013, the ferry experienced mechanical difficulties and went out of service. The problem turned out to be a broken turbocharger, which was not fully repaired until July 26, causing the vessel to miss eight scheduled crossings.
*On March 3, 2014, the vessel&#x27;s engine developed an internal problem, a crack in the lube oil distribution system, which caused the engine to overheat. As the vessel&#x27;s warranty had expired, Coastal Transport was on the hook for repair costs. Company president Murray Ryder defended himself against accusations that the vessel was a lemon, and stated that it was simply continuing to have &quot;teething problems.&quot;
*On April 4, 2014, the ferry experienced mechanical difficulties and was company was forced to cancel all its crossings. The engine&#x27;s turbocharger overheated, and ultimately had to be replaced. The replacement turbocharger had to be ordered from Illinois, and did not ship until April 21. The ferry finally resumed service on May 2.
*On March 25, 2015, the ferry was taken off its regular run due to engine problems. The problems began on March 24, when the crews could not get the engines running. On Wednesday morning, they sailed to the mainland on one engine in hopes of getting help. The ferry resumed service late afternoon on March 26.
*On April 7, 2015, the ferry&#x27;s 3:30pm and 5:30pm crossings were cancelled due to mechanical difficulties; it returned to service the following day.
*On May 14, 2015, the ferry&#x27;s 9:00pm crossing was cancelled, ostensibly for &quot;routine maintenance.&quot;
*On August 9, 2015, a number of crossings were cancelled, likely due to mechanical issues. It returned to service on August 11.

On August 11, 2015, the provincial government announced they had a plan to study the chronic problems the vessel had been having, in order to determine their cause. The Department of Transportation and Infrastructure stated they planned to engage an independent team from Newfoundland to assess the situation. Early speculation from locals has focused on how many of the problems have originated on the port side of the vessel. Frustration among the local population has been mounting. When interviewed by the CBC, former MLA Eric Allaby said: &quot;there&#x27;s something dreadfully wrong with some of the mechanics of this ferry.&quot; Local resident Tammy Worthen stated that the boat was now &quot;affectionately known as the &#x27;Misadventure.&#x27;&quot; 

Once the report was released, (a redacted copy is available on the Province of New Brunswick&#x27;s website), the company announced in August 2016 they were replacing both the engines aboard the vessel, at a cost of $400,000.

Former vessels in the fleet include the Grand Manan (1965-2011) and the Lady White Head.

==Fees Controversy==

In August 2010, in the period leading up to the New Brunswick provincial election, David Alward, the leader of the New Brunswick provincial Conservative Party pledged to remove the toll on the ferry to Grand Manan if they won the election. Alward claimed that the ferry service was unique in the province in that it charged a toll, and that it was unfair to island residents. He promised that Coastal Transport would be fully subsidized to compensate, and that the schedule would remain the same. These changes, he argued, would make it more attractive for people to work, live, and operate businesses on Grand Manan, and that it would prove a boon for tourism. But the suggestion itself was decried by the incumbent MLA and the Mayor of Grand Manan. Mayor Dennis Greene stated that businesses, council, the tourism sector, and the island&#x27;s transportation committee were not consulted prior to the announcement. The cost of eliminating the fees was estimated to be $1.7 million.

On September 27, 2010, Alward and the Conservatives won the provincial election. The following August, Alward stated that he would keep his election promise to eliminate the fees, and that although it wouldn&#x27;t happen by the end of 2011, it would by the end of his mandate. Gregg Ryder spoke on the issue in December 2011: &quot;There is a reason most ferry operations are associated with government fiscally and legally for subsidies. The population density is not there at this end of the country to the extent it is for B.C. Ferries.&quot; He added, &quot;Coastal Transport simply collects the fares on behalf of the province. If the province chooses to remove the fares, they are in effect eliminating one of their revenue streams. But many Grand Mananers have long held the view that they pay the only tolls in the province. They reject the comparison with the Princess of Acadia since it is interprovincial, as well as the now-defunct Yarmouth, N.S.-Bar Harbor run. With high fuel and labour costs, very few Canadian ferry operations are sustainable without government subsidy. We are no exception to this.&quot;

In March 2012 the fees still remained in place. The Village of Grand Manan then held a plebiscite, asking: &quot;Should the Council of the Village of Grand Manan ask the Government of New Brunswick to remove the fare to travel on the ferry to and from the mainland?&quot; The plebiscite subsequently passed by a narrow margin, 556 for and 511 against, with a voter turnout of 67 per cent. Alward responded by saying: &quot;I certainly respect the people of Grand Manan and have full intention to respect our commitments. I do appreciate the decision that the people have made where they are recommending to government to see the ferry fees removed. That is great for the economy of Grand Manan in the long term, and I have full intention to respect their wishes.&quot; By September 2012, the fees were still in place and although many politicians expected the Alward government to live up to its promise, they assumed it would be done towards the end of his four-year mandate.

In April 2013, Alward&#x27;s government announced their intention to reduce the amount of ferry crossings by one run daily, and that this would result in savings of $1 million per year. This move was met with a wave of opposition and a petition against it. However, these cuts did not materialize.

In perhaps his final public remarks on the matter, made during the reopening ceremony of The Algonquin Resort in June 2014, Alward said: &quot;I guess we haven&#x27;t come to a final decision on it. There hadn&#x27;t been a clean mandate or majority from the community in terms of the support on that. If we look at the ferry when it was built, it was built with a lot more capacity than was really needed and so we looked at changing some of the runs so what the community said at the time is, &#x27;why don&#x27;t you look at keeping the runs going the way it is because we believe it&#x27;s important to the economy of the island and also to the movement of people?&#x27; So that&#x27;s where we&#x27;ve been at. We thought that was the most important priority at the time so that&#x27;s where we have focused. We haven&#x27;t made a final decision where we&#x27;re going to land on the other part.&quot;

That same month, Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Claude Williams reiterated that the fares would remain. Many islanders felt that the government had reneged on its promise, and that the matter would become an election issue. The impact of this is unclear, but Alward&#x27;s mandate ended in 2014 with the fees still in place, and his Conservatives were defeated at the polls by the Liberal Party, led by Brian Gallant.

==Service to Deer Island==

In 2012, Coastal Transport won a 15-year contract, valued at $13.8 million per year, to operate the L&#x27;Etete to Deer Island Ferry, the Grand Manan Ferry service as well as the White head ferry service. .

<text>Papel volante is a Portuguese name that designates a form of popular literature that may include popular prints. They date from the seventeenth to twentieth centuries, and are usually in an eight-page quarto format. They were at their height in the eighteenth century. They are similar to the French literature of colportage, English chapbooks or to the Spanish &quot;pliegos&quot;, &quot;papeles volantes&quot; or &quot;hojas volanderas&quot;. They are also known as &quot;literatura de cordel&quot; (string literature), particularly in the northeast of Brazil.

Two of the most famous authors of &quot;papéis volantes&quot; are Baltasar Dias (17th century) and José Daniel Rodrigues da Costa (18th century), who wrote misogynous texts. Baltasar Dias&#x27;s &quot;Malícia das Mulheres&quot; (Malice of Women) had more than eighteen editions from 1640 until the twentieth century.

<text>Thomas Oliver (January 5, 1733/34 – November 20, 1815) was the last royal lieutenant-governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay.

==Biography==
Born in Antigua to a wealthy plantation owner, Thomas Oliver graduated from Harvard College in 1753. In 1760 he married Elizabeth Vassall, who was from another family of West Indies plantation owners that had settled in Massachusetts. The Vassalls were also connected by marriage to the politically powerful Phips family. Oliver was active in the militia but did not involve himself in politics. In 1766 he commissioned the mansion to be built by John Nutting (loyalist) now at 33 Elmwood Avenue, Cambridge, later called Elmwood, for his growing family.

When the provincial lieutenant governor, Andrew Oliver died in 1774, Oliver was appointed his successor by King George III and his government ministers, who may have believed him to be a brother or other relative of Andrew Oliver. On September 2, 1774, Oliver saw a crowd of four thousand angry citizens entering Cambridge and traveled to Boston to advise General Thomas Gage not to send troops against them. On his return, the crowd, defying the advice of their political leaders, surrounded Oliver&#x27;s house and forced him to sign a resignation. Oliver fled to Boston, remaining there for over a year. He chaired one meeting of the Massachusetts Council after Gage&#x27;s departure. When the British troops sailed to Halifax in March 1776, Oliver went with them, going on to England. He was proscribed under the Massachusetts Banishment Act in 1778, and his estate confiscated. The Continental Army had already used his house as a hospital during the Siege of Boston.

Oliver&#x27;s wife died after their flight to England, and he married Harriet Freeman in Antigua in 1781. Two years later in 1783, Oliver was recorded as owning 11 slaves: Buff, Cato, Jerry, Jeoffry, Samuel, Mira, Jude, Sarah, Violet, Jenny, and &quot;Young Jerry&quot;. He had six children by his first wife, and two with his second. He died in Bristol in 1815, and was buried at St Paul&#x27;s Church, Bristol. The British government continued to recognize him as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts and pay his salary until he died.

<text>The Eastern Mediterranean University (EMU; ) is a public university in Northern Cyprus, was established in 1979, led by Onay Fadıl Demirciler, who was then the Undersecretary of the Ministry of Education. Initially founded as a technology-focused higher-education institution for Turkish Cypriots, it was granted state university status in 1986. The university&#x27;s campus is situated within the city of Famagusta.

The university boasts 141 programs across 12 Faculties and 4 Schools, offering a range of undergraduate and postgraduate degrees, supported by substantial research infrastructure. Instruction is provided in both Turkish and English, with an English Preparatory School available to help students enhance their English proficiency.

==Campus==
=== Library ===
===Sports===
The campus boasts a variety of sports facilities, including tennis and basketball courts, AstroTurf football pitches, and an outdoor athletics stadium. Additionally, the Lala Mustafa Pasha indoor sports center, another key facility on campus, hosts major sporting and cultural events.

===Social activities===
University owns a radio station on 106.5 FM called &quot;Radio EMU&quot; broadcasting to whole island.

==International outreach ==
The university is a full member of both the European University Association and the International Association of Universities. It has gained accreditation for Turkish students from the Council of Higher Education and the Turkish Cypriot higher education organization, while maintaining its independent status through its non-profit foundation. The university is a member of the Caucasus University Association.

Also QS World University Rankings evaluated EMU within the 611-620 band among 1,500 universities from 105 countries.
== Controversies ==

A North Cypriot Newspaper, &quot;Cyprus Today&quot;, published two articles in 2008, featuring allegations of mobbing and bullying at the school, particularly against foreign faculty.

In the first article, the newspaper quoted the allegations of an ex-faculty member who claimed that he was forced to resign after he was harassed, professionally sabotaged, and the victim of false allegations (of which he was later exonerated after appealing to international organizations). The School administration denied the allegations and stated that the allegations were &quot;Utterly false and that no such thing has occurred and nothing can be substantiated&quot;. A spokesman for the Worker&#x27;s union said they were not aware of that particular faculty member&#x27;s situation, but had experienced similar problems concerning other faculty members.

In the second article, the newspaper reported about the penalizing of a British Faculty member, who was removed from the position of department chair for undisclosed reasons. The faculty member declined to comment, as did the university administration.

On 9 September 2009, Eastern Mediterranean University&#x27;s rector was dismissed by the University Senate. The university&#x27;s board of trusties unanimously ratified the decision on 11 September. No reason was ever given publicly for the dismissal, as the rector was replaced by Abdullah Y. Öztoprak. The rector&#x27;s dismissal was finally declared illegal by the Supreme Administrative Court on 14 July 2010. On 13 March 2011, The Upper Supreme Administrative Court rejected the decision of the lower Supreme Administrative Court and decided that the rector of Eastern Mediterranean University is Abdullah Y. Öztoprak.

<doc id="925926" wikidata="Q2162582" url="?curid=925926" title="Beeston, Leeds">
<text>Beeston is a suburb of Leeds, West Yorkshire, England located on a hill about 2 miles (3 km) south of the city centre.

The origins of Beeston can be traced back to the medieval period. It remained a small settlement until the latter part of the Victorian era when it became a primarily residential area for people working in Leeds and surrounding industrial areas like Holbeck and Hunslet.

At the time of the 2011 Census, Beeston had a population of 22,187 (which included Holbeck). Some parts of the area, around Cross Flatts Park, suffer from relatively high levels of deprivation, while areas to the centre and south are generally considered more affluent. Beeston is home to the Leeds United football club stadium on Elland Road and Hunslet rugby league club.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Beeston&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book, in the form &quot;Bestone&quot;. The name seems to come from Old English *&quot;bēos&quot; &#x27;bent-grass&#x27; (L. Agrostis) and &quot;tūn&quot; &#x27;estate, village&#x27;. Thus it once meant &#x27;estate characterised by bent-grass&#x27;.

The northern area of Beeston, situated on a hillside facing north to the centre of Leeds, came in the nineteenth century to be called Beeston Hill. This area was formerly called Cat Beeston (and variant spellings), a name first attested in 1398 as &quot;Catbeston&quot; and &quot;Cattbeston&quot;. The &quot;Cat&quot; element is also found in a local field-name, &quot;Cadtheweit&quot; (whose second element comes from Old Norse &quot;þveit&quot;, meaning &#x27;clearing&#x27;), attested in 1202. The &quot;Cat&quot; element could come from the Old English word &quot;catt&quot; (&#x27;cat, wild-cat&#x27;) or from a personal name &quot;Cada&quot;. Recent scholarship prefers the latter interpretation, in which case &quot;Cat Beeston&quot; once meant &#x27;Cada&#x27;s estate characterised by bent-gress&#x27;, while &quot;Cadtheweit&quot; meant &#x27;Cada&#x27;s clearing&#x27;.

To the west of Beeston lies Beeston Royds, whose name is first attested (as &quot;Beyston Royds&quot;) in 1633. The &quot;royds&quot; element comes from the Old English word &quot;rod&quot; (&#x27;clearing&#x27;).

Another district of Beeston is the Cross Flatts area. This name is first attested in 1636, as &quot;Crossflatts&quot; and other spellings. The Middle English word &quot;flat&quot; meant &#x27;piece of level ground, field&#x27;, but the precise significance of &#x27;cross&#x27; is unclear. It is thought to refer to some cross-shaped pattern of field divisions.

==History==

The origin of the settlement is likely to be Anglo-Saxon. Beeston is first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday Book, when it had recently been granted to Ilbert de Lacy (1045–93); in 1066 it had been worth 40 shillings (£2), but in 1086 it was considered waste, presumably because of the Harrying of the North. It was one of the ten &#x27;out-townships&#x27; of the Parish of Leeds until the parish was broken up in the 1840s-50s.

In the medieval period, Beeston was associated with sheep-farming: the monks of Kirkstall Abbey grazed 240 sheep there. Founding Drax Priory in the 1130s, William Paynel granted it land in Beeston. A small hospital seems to have been founded in the township around 1233, and a chapel dedicated to St Mary the Virgin may also have been founded in the 13th century.

The oldest buildings in Beeston today date to the 15th century. Cad Beeston (also Cad-Beeston, Cat Beeston, Cat-Beeston) manor house has been dated by dendrochronology to about 1420, and is a grade II* listed building; recently used as private offices, it is now a private dwelling, with no public access. Parts of Stank Hall Barn, a grade II* listed scheduled ancient monument originally built for the storage of crops, have been dated to between 1448 and 1490.

By the early 17th century the area had a reputation for manufacturing bone lace, and by the middle of the century, coal-mining was underway in the area. According to David Thornton,
in December 1688 rumours abounded in the town [of Leeds] that an army of Roman Catholics were ravaging the surrounding area. Ralph Thoresby recorded, &#x27;Beeston is actually burnt, and only some escaped to bring the doleful tidings! The drums beat, the bells rang backward, the women shrieked, and some doleful consternation seized upon all persons ... (B)lessed be God! The terror disappeared, it being a false alarm, taken from some drunken people.&#x27;

Between 1740 and 1820, the Leeds-Elland and Dewsbury-Leeds turnpike roads were built through Beeston; nationalised in the 1870s these roads remain as Elland Road and Dewsbury Road respectively. By 1822, Beeston had a population of 1,670. 

Until the 19th century, Beeston had been a small mining village situated on a hill overlooking Leeds. However, during the Industrial Revolution, land that had been occupied by open pits, as well as land formerly utilised for farming, was snapped up for high density residential development. By 1872, Beeston is recorded as having a population of 2,547 with 537 houses, a railway station and a post office, and &#x27;by the end of the 19th century Beeston was predominantly a working class community living in back-to-backs&#x27;. Beeston was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Leeds, in 1866 Beeston became a separate civil parish, on 26 March 1904 the parish was abolished and merged with Holbeck and became part of Leeds in 1925. In 1901 the parish had a population of 3323.

On the night of 14 March and early hours of 15 March 1941, during the Second World War, Leeds received its worst night of German aerial bombing. Beeston had more bombs dropped on it than any other district of the city and although Flaxton Terrace was damaged during the night time air raid, escaped with the less damage than most other areas of Leeds with nearly all the other bombs landing on Cross Flatts Park. In his 2005 poem &quot;Shrapnel&quot;, Tony Harrison, who was in Beeston on the night of the raid, speculates whether this was an act of heroism by the German pilot, a theory that has been explored ever since the raid. Holbeck Cemetery, in Beeston, also features prominently in Harrison&#x27;s 1985 poem &quot;V&quot;.

Beeston was formerly home to card and board game manufacturer Waddingtons, though the factory was vacated in the 1990s, and is now home to Nampak Cartons.

In 2006, the district was the setting for much of the film &quot;Mischief Night&quot;.

== Geography and demographics ==
Beeston is an inner-city area located close to Leeds city centre. It is severed from the areas to the north by the M621 motorway, separated from Middleton by Middleton Park and from Cottingley by the Leeds Outer Ring Road.

Beeston can be described as three distinct areas. Beeston - Parkside and Cross Flatts area and Beeston Hill are separated by Cross Flatts Park which runs between Dewsbury Road and Town Street: Beeston Hill to the east, and Parkside and Cross Flatts to the west. The distinction between these two areas has probably existed since medieval times when they were two separate manors. Beeston - Elland Road and Millshaw is primarily industrial and centred on Elland Road to the west of the area.

===Beeston - Parkside and Cross Flatts area===
The Parkside and Cross Flatts area of Beeston, sometimes locally known as Beeston Village, is centred on a shopping centre comprising a Nisa food store and a number of smaller shops. Housing in this part of Beeston is made up of almost equal proportions of late Victorian and early-20th-century terraced housing to the east of Old Lane, and newer semi-detached family and housing association properties to the west. To the south side of Dewsbury Road, there are significant areas of industrial premises.

Indicators for health, economic activity and community safety in this area are broadly consistent with averages for the City of Leeds as a whole.

===Beeston Hill area===

Beeston Hill is largely made up of areas of older Victoria terraces and newer social housing, which comprises around a third of the housing stock in the area. In April 2008, a £93 million PFI scheme to build 700 private and housing association dwellings and regenerate some existing stock was announced. As a particularly deprived area, Beeston Hill along with Holbeck was the beneficiary of Objective 2 European funding. Beeston Hill has a relatively high level of empty housing as well as a number of significant unoccupied commercial premises. Beeston Hill has a significant ethnic minority population, with around 40% of the population from BME Communities.

The area suffers from a high level of deprivation, with indicators for health, economic activity and community safety substantially worse than for the City of Leeds as a whole.

===Beeston - Elland Road and Millshaw Area===
The west of Beeston around Elland Road has significant amounts of industrial estates, with a substantial amount of mainly semi-detached and terraced housing to the western edge of the Parkside and Cross Flatts area. This also forms much of the Old Village side of Beeston, as can be seen in many of the houses along Town Street/Milshaw.

== Transport ==
===Railway===
Beeston has a main-line railway line running along its western edge along which all services between Leeds and London King&#x27;s Cross and London St Pancras run; however, there are no stations along it, as Beeston station closed to passengers in 1953. 

The nearest railway station is Cottingley, which is just under a mile away from the Town Street end of Beeston. Services between Leeds and Huddersfield are operated by TransPennine Express, stopping at Morley, Batley, Dewsbury, Ravensthorpe, Mirfield and Deighton.

===Buses===
Beeston is served by a number of bus services along Dewsbury Road, Elland Road and Town Street, operated primarily by First Leeds and Arriva Yorkshire; these include:
* A Park and Ride site to Leeds has been built opposite Elland Road police station 
* First services 2, 12, 75 and 86 link much of Beeston with Middleton, Belle Isle and Hunslet
* Service 65 links much of Beeston with Morley and Gildersome
* Services 51 and 52 link areas close to Elland Road with Morley
* Services 200 and 201 link the Dewsbury Road/White Rose side of Beeston to Morley
* The frequent No. 1 bus service largely follows the route of the former Leeds Tramway route 5 through Beeston; it continues beyond Leeds to Lawnswood/West Park.

===Roads===
Beeston Hill and Beeston are severed from Leeds by the M621 and therefore benefit from very good links with the M621 motorway, as well as the M62 which runs close to Beeston to the south of Morley.

== Economy ==
Much of Beeston&#x27;s traditional heavy industry and fabrication works have closed throughout the last forty years. However, there are substantial areas of industrial and commercial development around Elland Road and to the south of Dewsbury Road and Beeston is surrounded by areas which have become popular with businesses, such as Leeds city centre, Tingley and many of the business districts along the south side of the River Aire. The neighbouring White Rose Shopping Centre employs thousands of full- and part-time staff.

== Education ==
Beeston is home to the Beeston Centre of the Leeds City College (formerly Joseph Priestley College) and Elliott Hudson College. Beeston has one secondary school, Cockburn School which is a specialist arts college. 

Matthew Murray High School situated between Beeston and Holbeck closed down in 2004 and was merged with Merlyn Rees High School in Belle Isle, to form South Leeds High School in Belle Isle. In September 2009 South Leeds High School was reopened as the South Leeds Academy. 

In September 2017, South Leeds Academy was renamed and rebranded as Cockburn John Charles Academy, as the Cockburn MAT opened a new school. There are seven primary schools in the area.

==Local facilities and attractions==

Beeston has a range of facilities. It has two large health centres, Elland Road stadium and the John Charles Centre for Sport. Leeds city centre is a short distance away and the M1 and M62 motorways are easily accessed. Cross Flatts Park has many facilities, which include 5-a-side football pitches, tennis courts, two separate play areas one for older children and one for younger children and a bowling green.

===Stadiums===
Beeston is home to two stadiums: 
*Elland Road, home of Leeds United AFC, has a 39,640 capacity, all-seater stadium on Elland Road, adjacent to the M621 in the north of Beeston. 
* The South Leeds Stadium, part of the John Charles Centre for Sport is situated on Middleton Grove (off Dewsbury Road) on the southern edge of Beeston. This is home to Hunslet rugby league club, as well as hosting athletics and aquatic sports in the new Aquatic Centre (the replacement for the Leeds International Swimming Pool); this opened in October 2008 and provides an Olympic standard swimming pool and diving pool. The centre also has indoor bowling, indoor Tennis Centre, athletics stadium, 5-a-side football pitches, rugby pitches and outdoor gym equipment.

===Cross Flatts Park===
Cross Flatts Park covers an area of 44 acres (17.8 hectares) in the centre of Beeston. While the park formerly suffered from neglect and had a high crime rate, through the work of the Council and community groups such as Friends of Cross Flatts Park and Beeston in Bloom the park has been cleaned up and made safer and more welcoming.

The park has a large multi-use games area which includes five-a-side football pitches, basketball courts and tennis courts, while the park boasts an artificial cricket pitch, a children&#x27;s play area and outdoor gym equipment. The park is the venue for the Beeston Festival which takes place annually in June, and in summer and school holidays is host to numerous activities for young people.
The park hosts a weekly 5 km Parkrun every Saturday morning at 9am, over 1,000 runners have taken part in the event since it began on 30 March 2013.

===Holbeck Cemetery===

Holbeck Cemetery in Beeston opened in 1857 and closed to general burials in the 1940s. During the period it was operational, thousands of people were buried there with many in &#x27;guinea graves&#x27; with several unrelated people buried in the same plot. The graves were so called for the shared headstones on which a single-line inscription cost one guinea (21 shillings).

Henry Rowland Marsden, the Victorian industrialist and former mayor of Leeds, is buried in Holbeck Cemetery where his family grave is marked by a Grade II-listed memorial.

The poem &quot;V&quot; by Tony Harrison, published in 1985, describes a visit to Holbeck Cemetery and his reaction to finding his parents&#x27; tombstones vandalised.

===Greenhouse===

In 2008 Shaftesbury House, a working men&#x27;s hostel designed for the council by George C. Robb in 1936, was converted by Citu to the Greenhouse, an eco-friendly housing project. The building had been empty for a number of years and had previously been earmarked for demolition.

The development, which includes 172 homes, office space and other facilities, is one of the UK&#x27;s first low-carbon housing developments and incorporates wind turbines, solar panels and ground source heating as well as energy efficient materials and rainwater and greywater recycling. The development has won a large number of awards, including, in 2011, the Regeneration and Renewal Magazine Regeneration Award for Sustainability, with judges praising the holistic way it addressed sustainability and provides real regeneration benefits to a deprived area. Robb Street and Avenue are likely named after its architect George C Robb, who was chief housing architect for RAH Livett, Leeds Housing Director and later City Architect.

==Religious sites==

Beeston has at least ten churches of several denominations including Church of England, Roman Catholic, Methodist and Baptist. The Anglican churches of St Mary on Town Street and St Luke on Malvern Road were constructed in the 1870s, though the former is on the site of a much older church. The more modern church of St David Waincliffe on Dewsbury Road, constructed in the 1960s was designed by Geoffrey Davy and won a Hoffman Wood (Leeds) Gold Medal for Architecture.

There are three mosques in Beeston, all located within the Beeston Hill area. There is also a Sikh Gurdwara.

==Governance==

Most parts of Beeston are located within the Beeston and Holbeck ward of Leeds City Council, which has since its creation in 2004 consistently been represented by Labour councillors.

Parts of Beeston Hill to the north of Cross Flatts Park are located within the Hunslet and Riverside ward. This was created in 2018, and largely corresponds to its predecessor City and Hunslet, created in 2004. This was too has invariably returned Labour councillors since 2004.

Hilary Benn (Labour) has been MP since 1999 when he won the seat following the death of Derek Fatchett who had been MP for Leeds Central since 1983. Before the 1997 general election, Beeston was part of the Morley and Leeds South constituency, represented from its creation in 1983 to 1992 by Merlyn Rees and from 1992 to 1997 by John Gunnell. Before the creation of the Morley and South Leeds constituency the area was part of the Leeds South constituency represented until 1963 by Hugh Gaitskell, leader of the Labour Party from 1955 to his death in 1963, after whom a primary school in the area is named.

==Notable people==
The playwright Willis Hall attended Cockburn High School in Beeston as did the academic and author of &quot;The Uses of Literacy&quot;, Richard Hoggart. The poet Tony Harrison was brought up on Tempest Road and went to what was then Cross Flatts county primary school. More recently, the actress Holly Kenny who starred in the BBC drama serial &quot;Waterloo Road&quot; was a pupil at the school.

The musician and bandleader Ivy Benson grew up in Beeston, where her former house on Cemetery Road is marked with a blue plaque.

Former England and Leeds United footballer Paul Madeley was born in Beeston.

Former international rugby league and rugby union star Jason Robinson went to Cross Flatts Park Middle School and Matthew Murray High School, and began his Rugby League career with Hunslet Hawks.

Leigh Francis, famous for his character Keith Lemon, was born in Beeston.

==London bombings==

Beeston was the focus of press attention following 7 July 2005 London bombings when it was revealed that two of the four bombers had lived in the area. On 12 July, two properties in Beeston were raided by police in connection with the attacks. According to West Yorkshire Police, a significant amount of explosive material was found in the raids and a controlled explosion was carried out at one of the properties.

===After-effects===
The link between 7 July bombings and Beeston became known several days after the event took place. When news began to emerge of the Beeston link to the attacks, community and religious groups from across Beeston came together to condemn the atrocities. There was a significant pulling together of people across the community with two &quot;Beeston Together for Peace&quot; marches being held. Each were joined by hundreds of people, some as the procession passed. The second procession ended at Millennium Square in Leeds city centre, uniting with people from other parts of Leeds for an interfaith vigil.

===Beeston in the press===
Following the London press, Beeston was thrust into the local, regional, national and international press, with journalists from as far away as North America and Japan arriving in the area to cover the reaction to the events of the previous week. The tone of the reporting was mixed, some sympathetic to the area, many even describing Beeston as a &#x27;leafy suburb&#x27;, whereas others painted a less salubrious picture of Beeston.

The Guardian

Writing a year after the bombings, a journalist from &quot;The Guardian&quot; visited Beeston with the aim of going &quot;beyond the stereotypical pictures of veiled women and bearded men strolling past dilapidated buildings.&quot; The article reported that the community in Beeston had on the whole condemned the attacks.

NBC

American news network NBC described Beeston as &quot;a drab and derelict neighbourhood in Leeds, three hours north of London, where three of the four London suicide bombers were born and raised&quot;. The article later stated, &quot;Beeston, a poor racially mixed community, is lined with small row houses built in another era to house the factory workers who were one of the cornerstones of the British industry. The neighbourhood has long accommodated immigrant communities — from Asia in the 1960s to Eastern Europe and Africa today. Reportedly, almost half the households now are on some sort of state assistance.&quot;

Los Angeles Times

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described Beeston as an &quot;ethnically mixed, downtrodden suburb&quot;. Setting the scene, it also said &quot;Peeping from lacy curtains in red-brick rowhouses, tattooed white men, turbaned Sikhs and olive-skinned women in gauzy headscarves shared what they knew.&quot;

International Herald Tribune

One year after the London Bombings, the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; described Beeston as a &quot;grim northern neighbourhood&quot;. The paper also said &quot;It is a poor and racially mixed neighbourhood of back-to-back row houses with a population of just a few thousand where successive waves of immigrants from Asia in the 1960s, and now from East Europe and Africa, have spread a tangled overlay on a cityscape forged in Victorian Britain. The bright pink and turquoise saris of Asian women offer chromatic relief from drab brick homes&quot;.

Socialist Worker

The &quot;Socialist Worker&quot; focused on Beeston&#x27;s positive aspect and reported on the &#x27;Beeston United for Peace&#x27; vigil, organised by Beeston members of the Stop the War Coalition. The 150 strong march from Hyde Park was also covered.

<text>This is a list of battleships of Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.

==Pre-Dreadnoughts==
===&quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot;===
&quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Black Sea Fleet. She joined the fleet in mid-1893, but was not fully ready for service until 1894. &quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot; participated in the failed attempt to recapture the mutinous battleship in 1905. Decommissioned and disarmed in 1911, the ship became an immobile submarine depot ship the following year. &quot;Dvenadsat Apostolov&quot; was captured by the Germans in 1918 in Sevastopol and was handed over to the Allies in December. Lying immobile in Sevastopol, she was captured by both sides in the Russian Civil War before she was abandoned when the White Russians evacuated the Crimea in 1920. The ship was used as a stand-in for the title ship during the filming of &quot;The Battleship Potemkin&quot; and was finally scrapped in 1931.

===&quot;Navarin&quot;===
&quot;Navarin&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Baltic Fleet in the late 1880s and early 1890s. The ship spent the early part of her career deployed in the Mediterranean and in the Far East. She participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900 before returning to the Baltic Fleet in 1901. Several months after the beginning of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, she was assigned to the 2nd Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur. During the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905, she was sunk by Japanese destroyers which spread twenty-four linked mines across her path during the night. &quot;Navarin&quot; struck two of these mines and capsized with the loss of most of her crew.

===&quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot;===
&quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Black Sea Fleet. She was flagship of the forces pursuing the mutinous battleship in June 1905. During World War I the ship encountered the German battlecruiser (formally &quot;Yavuz Sultan Selim&quot;) twice, but never hit the German ship, nor was she damaged by her. From 1915 onward she was relegated to the coast bombardment role as she was the oldest battleship in the Black Sea Fleet. &quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; was refitting in Sevastopol when the February Revolution of 1917 began and she was never operational afterwards.

&quot;Tri Sviatitelia&quot; was captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and was turned over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Her engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using her against the White Russians. She was abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and was scrapped in 1923.

===&quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot;===
&quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Baltic Fleet in the 1890s. The ship&#x27;s construction was marred by organizational, logistical and engineering problems and dragged on for more than five years. She was commissioned in October 1896 with an appalling number of design and construction faults, and only a few of them were fixed during her lifetime. Immediately after sea trials, &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; sailed to the Mediterranean to enforce the naval blockade of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War. In 1897 she suffered a devastating explosion of the aft gun turret that killed 21 men. After nine months in the docks of Toulon for repairs, the ship sailed to the Far East to reinforce the Russian presence there. In the summer of 1900, &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; supported the international campaign against the Boxer Rebellion in China. Sailors from &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; and &quot;Navarin&quot; participated in the defence of the International Legations in Beijing for more than two months.

In 1902 the ship returned to Kronstadt for repairs, but very little was achieved until the early losses of the Russo-Japanese War caused the formation of the Second Pacific Squadron to relieve the Russian forces blockaded in Port Arthur. &quot;Sissoi Veliky&quot; sailed for the Far East with the rest of the Baltic battleships and participated in the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. She survived the daytime artillery duel with Admiral Heihachirō Tōgō&#x27;s ships, but was badly damaged and taking on water. During the night Japanese destroyers scored a torpedo hit on the ship that damaged her steering. The next morning the ship was unable to maintain speed because of flooding, and her crew surrendered to Japanese armed merchant cruisers. The ship capsized later that morning with the loss of 47 crewmen.

===&quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; class===

The &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; class, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Poltava&quot; class, was a class of three pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy during the 1890s. They were transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur before the start of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. All three ships participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on the second day of the war. sank two months after the war began after striking one or more mines laid by the Japanese. The remaining two ships participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea in August 1904 and were sunk or scuttled during the final stages of the Siege of Port Arthur.

 was salvaged after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy. The ship, renamed in Japanese service, participated in the Battle of Tsingtao in late 1914, during World War I. She was sold back to the Russians in 1916 and renamed as her original name was in use by another battleship. The ship became the flagship of the Russian Arctic Flotilla in 1917 and her crew supported the Bolsheviks later that year. She was seized by the British in early 1918 when they intervened in the Russian Civil War, abandoned by them when they withdrew and scrapped by the Soviets in 1924.

===&quot;Rostislav&quot;===
&quot;Rostislav&quot; was a pre-dreadnought battleship built for the Black Sea Fleet in the 1890s. She was conceived as a small, inexpensive coastal defence ship, but the Navy abandoned the concept in favor of a compact, seagoing battleship with a displacement of . Poor design and construction practices increased her actual displacement by more than . &quot;Rostislav&quot; became the world&#x27;s first capital ship to burn fuel oil, rather than coal. Her combat ability was compromised by the use of main guns instead of the de facto Russian standard of 12 inches.

Her hull was launched in September 1896, but non-delivery of the ship&#x27;s main guns delayed her maiden voyage until 1899 and her completion until 1900. In May 1899 &quot;Rostislav&quot; became the first ship of the Imperial Navy to be commanded by a member of the House of Romanov, Captain Alexander Mikhailovich. From 1903 to 1912 the ship was the flagship of the second-in-command of the Black Sea Fleet. During the 1905 Russian Revolution her crew was on the verge of mutiny but remained loyal to the regime, and actively suppressed the mutiny of the cruiser .

&quot;Rostislav&quot; was actively engaged in World War I until the collapse of the Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to fire upon enemy targets on land during World War I, the first Russian ship to be hit by a German airstrike, and the first one to destroy a submarine, albeit a Russian one. In April 1918 the fleeing Bolsheviks abandoned &quot;Rostislav&quot; in Sevastopol. One year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White forces repurposed the ship as a towed floating battery, then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.

===&quot;Peresvet&quot; class===
The &quot;Peresvet&quot; class was a class of three pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Imperial Russian Navy around the end of the 19th century. and were transferred to the Pacific Squadron upon completion and based at Port Arthur from 1901 and 1903. All three ships were lost by the Russians in the Russo-Japanese War; &quot;Peresvet&quot; and &quot;Pobeda&quot; participated in the Battles of Port Arthur and the Yellow Sea and were sunk during the Siege of Port Arthur. , the third ship, was sunk at the Battle of Tsushima with the loss of over half her crew. &quot;Peresvet&quot; and &quot;Pobeda&quot; were salvaged after the Japanese captured Port Arthur and incorporated into the Imperial Japanese Navy. &quot;Peresvet&quot; was sold back to the Russians during World War I and sank after hitting German mines in the Mediterranean in early 1917 while &quot;Pobeda&quot;, renamed , participated in the Battle of Tsingtao in late 1914. She became a gunnery training ship in 1917 until she was disarmed and hulked in 1922–1923. The ship was scrapped after the end of World War II.

===&quot;Potemkin&quot;===

 («Князь Потёмкин-Таврический», 1900 BSF) – Renamed («Пантелеймон») 1905, renamed («Потёмкин-Таврический) 1917, («Борец за Свободу») 1917, destroyed by British troops at Sevastopol 1919


===&quot;Retvizan&quot;===

&quot;Retvizan&quot; () was a pre-dreadnought battleship built before the Russo-Japanese War for the Imperial Russian Navy in the United States. She was built by the William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company of Philadelphia, although the armament was made at the Obukhov works in Saint Petersburg and shipped to America for installation.

&quot;Retvizan&quot; was torpedoed during the Japanese surprise attack on Port Arthur during the night of 8–9 February 1904 and grounded in the harbor entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside as her draft had significantly deepened from all of the water she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was eventually refloated and repaired by mid-June. She joined the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok though the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them in the Battle of the Yellow Sea and forced most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after killing the squadron commander and damaging his flagship. She was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese had gained control of the heights around the harbor.

The Japanese raised her after the surrender of Port Arthur in January 1905 and repaired her. She was commissioned in the Imperial Japanese Navy as in 1908. In Sasebo when the Japanese declared war on Germany in 1914 she was sent to reinforce the weak British squadron in British Columbia, but was diverted to Hawaii when reports of the arrival of a German gunboat there were received. She was sent to search for other German ships after the Americans interned the German ship in November, but did not encounter any. After World War I she supported the Japanese intervention in the Russian Civil War, but was disarmed in 1922 in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty. She was sunk as a gunnery target in 1924.

===&quot;Tsesarevich&quot;===

&quot;Tsesarevich&quot; () was a pre-dreadnought built in France for the Pacific Squadron. She participated in the Russo-Japanese War, and was the flagship of Admiral Wilgelm Vitgeft in the Battle of the Yellow Sea. Her design was the basis of the s which were built in Russia.

===&quot;Borodino&quot; class===
The five &quot;Borodino&quot;-class battleships (also known as the &quot;Suvorov&quot; class) were pre-dreadnoughts built between 1899 and 1905 for the Pacific Squadron. Three of the class were sunk and one captured by the Imperial Japanese Navy during the Battle of Tsushima.

Historically, the &quot;Borodino&quot;-class battleships established two records; under Russian Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky riding in his flagship, , he led the Russian battleship fleet on the longest coal powered journey ever conducted by a steel battleship fleet during wartime, a voyage of over one way. Secondly, although sunk in battle, the &quot;Borodino&quot;s participated in the only decisive battleship fleet action ever fought. Lastly, what may be the most distinctive item of interest for the future, is the fact that the ships were constructed with tumblehome hulls, seemingly wider at the bottom then narrower towards the top. As a lesson from Tsushima, tumblehome construction was discarded in warship design, as they were regarded as unstable under combat conditions.

===&quot;Evstafi&quot; class===

The &quot;Evstafi&quot; class were the last pre-dreadnought battleships built for the Black Sea Fleet. They were slightly enlarged versions of the , with increased armour and more guns. Numerous alterations were made as a result of experience in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 that seriously delayed the completion of the two ships.

They were the most modern ships in the Black Sea Fleet when World War I began and formed the core of the fleet for the first year of the war, before the newer dreadnoughts entered service. They forced the German battlecruiser to disengage during the Battle of Cape Sarych shortly after Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire in late 1914. Both ships covered several bombardments of the Bosporus fortifications in early 1915, including one where they were attacked by &quot;Goeben&quot;, but they managed to drive her off. Later, and were relegated to secondary roles after the first dreadnought entered service in late 1915, and were subsequently put into reserve in 1918 in Sevastopol.

Both ships were captured when the Germans took the city in May 1918 and were turned over to the Allies after the Armistice in November 1918. Their engines were destroyed in 1919 by the British when they withdrew from Sevastopol to prevent the advancing Bolsheviks from using them against the White Russians. They were abandoned when the Whites evacuated the Crimea in 1920 and were scrapped in 1922–1923.

===&quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; class===
The &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; class were the last predreadnought battleships built for the Baltic Fleet. They were conceived by the Naval Technical Committee in 1903 as an incremental development of the s with increased displacement and heavier secondary armament. Work on the lead ship, (Saint Andrew), commenced at the New Admiralty, Saint Petersburg in March 1904; trailed by six months.

The disastrous experiences of the Russo-Japanese War led to countless redesigns, change orders and delays in construction. After the completion of &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; its builders identified seventeen distinct stages of her design. &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; was launched in October 1906 but subsequent alterations delayed completion until 1911. Almost all of her hull was armored, albeit thinly; redesign and refinement of protective armor continued until 1912. The ship&#x27;s armament mixed novel quick-firing, long-range, 8-inch guns with obsolescent 12-inch 40-caliber main guns. The &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot;-class battleships became the only battleships of the Old World fitted with lattice masts, which were replaced with conventional masts at the beginning of World War I. The imposing ships, the largest in the Russian Navy until the completion of , were dated from the start: by the time of their sea trials the Royal Navy had already launched the super-dreadnoughts.

In the first year of World War I, &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; and &quot;Imperator Pavel I&quot; comprised the battle core of the Baltic Fleet. For most of the war they remained moored in the safety of Sveaborg and Helsingfors. Idle, demoralized enlisted men subscribed to Bolshevik ideology and on took control of the ships in a violent mutiny. The battleships survived the Ice Cruise of 1918, and &quot;Andrei Pervozvanny&quot; later ruthlessly gunned down the Krasnaya Gorka fort mutiny of 1919. After the Kronstadt rebellion the Bolshevik government lost interest in maintaining the battleships, and they were laid up in November–December 1923.

==Dreadnoughts==
===&quot;Gangut&quot; class===

The &quot;Gangut&quot;-class battleships were the first dreadnoughts built for the Imperial Russian Navy, begun before World War I. Their role was to defend the mouth of the Gulf of Finland against the Germans, who never tried to enter, so the ships spent their time training and providing cover for minelaying operations. Their crews participated in the general mutiny of the Baltic Fleet after the February Revolution in 1917, and joined the Bolsheviks the following year. The Russians were forced to evacuate their naval base at Helsinki after Finland became independent in December 1917. The &quot;Gangut&quot;-class ships led the first contingent of ships to Kronstadt even though the Gulf of Finland was still frozen.

All of the dreadnoughts except for were laid up in October–November 1918 for lack of manpower. was severely damaged by a fire while laid up in 1919. &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; was retained in commission to defend Kronstadt and Leningrad against the British forces supporting the White Russians although she also helped to suppress a mutiny by the garrison of Fort Krasnaya Gorka in 1919. Her crew, and that of , joined the Kronstadt rebellion of March 1921. After it was bloodily crushed, those ships were given proper &#x27;revolutionary&#x27; names. , the former &quot;Sevastopol&quot;, was modified in 1928 to improve her sea-keeping abilities so that she could be transferred to the Black Sea Fleet which had nothing heavier than a light cruiser available. This proved to be the first of a series of modernizations where each ship of the class was progressively reconstructed and improved. A number of proposals were made in the 1930s to rebuild , ex-&quot;Poltava&quot;, to match her sisters or even as a battlecruiser by removing one turret, but these came to naught and she was hulked preparatory to scrapping.

The two ships of the Baltic Fleet did not play a prominent role in the Winter War, but did have their anti-aircraft guns significantly increased before Operation Barbarossa in 1941. However this did not help either ship as they attempted to provide fire support for the defenders of Leningrad. had her bow blown off and was badly damaged by multiple bomb hits in September. The former was sunk, but later raised and became a floating battery for the duration of the Siege of Leningrad while the latter spent over a year under repair, although this was lengthened by subsequent bomb hits while in the hands of the shipyard. Both ships bombarded German and Finnish troops so long as they remained within reach, but &quot;Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya&quot; did not venture away from Kronstadt for the duration of the war. &quot;Parizhskaya Kommuna&quot; remained in Sevastopol until forced to evacuate by advancing German troops. She made one trip to besieged Sevastopol in December 1941 and made a number of bombardments in support of the Kerch Offensive during January–March 1942. She was withdrawn from combat in April as German aerial supremacy had made it too risky to risk such a large target.

&quot;Sevastopol&quot; and &quot;Oktyabrskaya Revolyutsiya&quot; remained on the active list after the end of the war although little is known of their activities. Both were reclassified as &#x27;school battleships&#x27; (&quot;uchebnyi lineinyi korabl&quot;) in 1954 and stricken in 1956 after which they were slowly scrapped. There were several plans (Project 27) to reconstruct &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot; using the bow of &quot;Frunze&quot;, but they were not accepted and were formally cancelled on 29 June 1948. She was renamed &quot;Volkhov&quot; in 1950 and served as a stationary training ship until stricken in 1953 and subsequently broken up. &quot;Frunze&quot; was finally scrapped beginning in 1949.

===&quot;Imperatritsa Mariya&quot; class===
The &quot;Imperatritsa Mariya&quot;-class ships were the first dreadnoughts built for the Black Sea Fleet. All three ships were built in Nikolayev during World War I. Two ships were delivered in 1915 and saw some combat against ex-German warships that had been &#x27;gifted&#x27; to the Ottoman Empire, but the third was not completed until 1917 and saw no combat due to the disorder in the navy after the February Revolution earlier that year.

 was sunk by a magazine explosion in Sevastopol harbor in 1916. , having been renamed in 1917, was scuttled in Novorossiysk harbor in 1918 to prevent her from being turned over to the Germans as required by the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. The crew of , as had been renamed in 1917, voted to turn her over to the Germans. They were only able to make one training cruise before they had to turn her over to the victorious Allies in 1918 as part of the armistice terms. The British took control of her, but turned her over to the White Russians in 1920 who renamed her . She only had one operable gun turret by this time and she provided some fire support for the Whites, but it was not enough. They were forced to evacuate the Crimea later that year and sailed for Bizerte where she was interned by the French. She was eventually scrapped there during the 1930s to pay her docking fees.

===&quot;Imperator Nikolai I&quot;===
&quot;Imperator Nikolai I&quot; ( or Emperor Nikolai I) was built during World War I for service in the Black Sea. She was designed to counter the multiple Ottoman orders for dreadnoughts which raised the possibility that the Russian dreadnoughts being built for the Black Sea Fleet could be out-numbered. The ship used the same main armament as the preceding , but was larger and more heavily armored. &quot;Imperator Nikolai I&quot; was launched in 1916, but construction was suspended on 24 October 1917. The Soviets considered completing her in 1923, but rejected the idea. She was towed to Sevastopol in 1927 and scrapped.

===&quot;Sovetsky Soyuz&quot; class===
The &quot;Sovetsky Soyuz&quot;-class battleships (Project 23, ), also known as &quot;Stalin&#x27;s Republics&quot;, were a class of battleships begun by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s but never brought into service. They were designed in response to the battleships being built by Germany. Only four hulls of the sixteen originally planned had been laid down by 1940, when the decision was made to cut the program to only three ships to divert resources to an expanded army rearmament program.

These ships would have rivaled the Imperial Japanese in size if any had been completed, although with significantly weaker firepower: guns compared to the guns of the Japanese ships. The failure of the Soviet armor plate industry to build cemented armor plates thicker than would have negated any advantages from the &quot;Sovetsky Soyuz&quot; class&#x27;s thicker armor in combat.

Construction of the first four ships was plagued with difficulties as the Soviet shipbuilding and related industries were not prepared to build such large ships. One battleship, &quot;Sovetskaya Belorussiya&quot;, was cancelled on 19 October 1940 after serious construction flaws were found. Construction of the other three ships was suspended shortly after Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, and never resumed. All three of the surviving hulls were scrapped in the late 1940s.

==Foreign-built ships==

===&quot;Arkhangelsk&quot;===

 was loaned by the Royal Navy in 1944 in lieu of reparations from Italy. She was assigned to the Northern Fleet with the name of &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; and used to escort convoys during the war. Returned to Britain in poor condition in 1949 when the USSR received the and sold for scrap.

===&quot;Novorossiysk&quot;===

The Italian battleship &quot;Giulio Cesare&quot; was turned over to the Soviet Union by Italy in 1948 as war reparations. Renamed &quot;Novorossiysk&quot;, she was assigned to the Black Sea Fleet. Sunk with 608 deaths following explosion in 1955; probably due to striking a leftover German mine.

<text>Aspley is a suburb in the City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. In the , Aspley had a population of 12,871 people.

== Geography ==
Aspley is located about north and about a half-hour drive north of the Brisbane central business district. It is positioned on flat ground south of Cabbage Tree Creek, centred on Little Cabbage Tree Creek and on the surrounding hills to the east and south.

== History ==
Prior to European settlement, Australian aborigines of the Duke of York clan lived in the local area, though their main camping ground was further south in the suburb now known as Herston. The Duke of York clan was part of the Turrbal tribe who occupied the area north from Logan River, south of the North Pine River, east of Moggill Creek to Moreton Bay.

Soon after Brisbane was declared a free settlement in 1842, Europeans began exploring the lands north of Brisbane City. The suburb was originally known as North Chermside until the mid 1970s. A northern route followed aboriginal tracks through what is now Kelvin Grove, Enoggera, Everton Hills, Albany Creek onto North Pine.

After the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859, subsequent subdivisions were much smaller.

Originally known as &quot;Soldiers Flat&quot; and then &quot;Little Cabbage Tree Creek&quot;, the area became officially called &quot;Aspley&quot; in 1897. The name is believed to refer to the Aspley Orangery and Aspley Vineyard owned by John Morris in 1860s. Morris came from Nottinghamshire in England where there was an Aspley Hall.

In the following five years, land parcels south of Zillmere Road/Graham Road in what is now recognised as Aspley began. In 1865, subdivisions west of what is now Maundrell Terrace were sold at the Brisbane Land Sales. In 1866, subdivisions between what is now Gympie Road, Maundrell Terrace and Webster Road were auctioned. The subdivisions were named &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Flat&quot;. Initially, the area was known as &quot;Little Cabbage Tree Creek District&quot;. The immigrants were primarily of English and German ancestry.

In late October 1867, gold was discovered in Gympie, Queensland. By this time, a road from Brisbane City to Kedron Brook had been completed with the Bowen Bridge opened in 1860, permitting the northern track along Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road to be used as an alternate route to the Old Northern Road. However, neither road was of good quality. On 8 May 1868 the Government announced that it had allocated 2700 pounds to construct a trafficable, more direct, road to the Gympie goldfields. The new road came through Kedron Brook, Downfall Creek, Little Cabbage Tree Creek before heading to Bald Hills and North Pine. This road is now known as Gympie Road and travels a route very different from the original aboriginal track.

With increased traffic on Gympie Road, the Royal Exchange Hotel was established in 1875 opposite the intersection of Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road. It also operated as a general store for a while with Cobb and Co coaches passing on their way to the Gympie goldfields. In 1934, a second building was built south of the original hotel. The new building was called the &quot;Aspley Hotel&quot;.

In the early 1870s, a vineyard was established by the Morris family on their property bounded by Maundrell Terrace, Gympie Road and Terrence Street. It was named the &quot;Aspley Vineyard&quot;, after &quot;Aspley Hall&quot; in Nottingham, England. The vineyard operated for over twenty years. In 1897, Little Cabbage Tree Creek District was renamed Aspley.

From 1879, all northern districts of Brisbane were within the local government area of Nundah Division. In 1883, Toombul Division separated. In 1886, the Nundah Division was subdivided into three smaller local government area. In 1903, Nundah Division become the Shire of Kedron as it was no longer based in Nundah. On 1 October 1925, the Shire of Kedron was integrated into Greater Brisbane.

Little Cabbage-tree Creek State School opened on 6 August 1890. Before it was built, students would infrequently attend classes at the schools in Bald Hills or Zillmere. Initial sites for the new school were not approved by the Government before finally accepting the location on the corner of Maundrell Terrace and Horn Road. In 1897 the school was renamed Aspley State School.

In the latter part of the 19th century, Aspley was essentially a farming district. Additional industries were established to support the farming industry. In the 1880s, John Smith Booth established a bone mill and sawmill on Little Cabbage Tree Creek and Albany Creek Road. It later relocated to the current location of the former Aspley Acres Caravan Park and finally closed in 1932. In 1888, Huttons Pty Ltd established a meat processing plant in nearby suburb Zillmere. It contributed greatly to the local economy of Aspley, providing an alternative employment for farmers during poor seasons. A blacksmith operated on the northern corner of Gympie Road and Albany Creek Road until the 1920s. Several slaughter houses operated along Little Cabbage Tree Creek.In 1912 the Kedron Omnibus company was formed by locals and ran local services to Wooloowin Station after previous services were cancelled as an aftermath of the 1912 transport strike.

Before and during World War I, the land now known as Marchant Park was variously used as the home of artillery and light horse units. On 9 September 1921 the land was donated by its owner, soft drink manufacturer George Marchant to create Marchant Park.

After World War I and into the 1920s, Aspley experienced some growth in the number of businesses present in the district. Griffiths Sweet Factory operated on Gympie Road between 1930 and 1950 after shifting from Windsor. Hedges Dripping Factory operated near the reservoir on Lawrence Road. A brickworks was established by the Granville family on Brickfield Road during the 1930s.

In 1918 the Aspley Assembly Hall (a local community hall) was built on Gympie Road. A year later, movies were presented inside the hall. In 1950 the hall was sold to become St Paul&#x27;s Anglican Church. The church was dedicated by Bishop Administrator John Hudson on 10 March 1963. It closed on 24 October 1981 as the land was resumed for road purposes.

The Methodist services were held in the Aspley Assembly Hall from 1918. In 1932 the congregation acquired one acre of land on Robinson Road for a church. on 8 October 1932 the foundation stone laid and the church was erected for £350. A hall was opened on 23 November 1958 and its extension on 25 October 1964. With the creation of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, the church became the Aspley Uniting Church. In 1984 the former St Philip&#x27;s Presbyterian Church in Aspley (which also became part of the Uniting Church) officially merged with the Aspley Uniting Church and St Philip&#x27;s was closed. The foundation stone for the current church was laid on 14 October 1984 by the Reverend Rolland Busch, the President of the Uniting Church in Australia with the new church officially opening on 24 November 1985.

On Sunday 25 June 1933, Archbishop James Duhig laid the foundation stone for St Dympna&#x27;s Catholic Church. Duhig returned on Sunday 17 September 1933 to officially open the church. This church was demolished and replaced by a new church in 1974 called Aspley Catholic War Memorial Church of Our Lady and St Dympna.

By the 1960s, the suburban development of the local area necessitated building additional school and churches.

St Philip&#x27;s Presbyterian Church was officially opened on 7 February 1960 by the Right Reverend Robert McCann Park, Moderator of the Presbyterian State Assembly. It was located on the corner of Petanne Street and Summerfield Street (approx ). Following the creation of the Uniting Church in Australia in 1977, St Philip&#x27;s became a Uniting Church. As the former Aspley Methodist Church also became a Uniting Church, it was decided to merge the congregations and close St Philip&#x27;s with a final service in St Philip&#x27;s on 1 February 1984.

St Dympna&#x27;s Catholic Primary School was established by the Sisters of St Joseph, opening on 24 January 1963.

Aspley East State School opened on 29 January 1963. It became one of the largest and most popular primary schools on Brisbane&#x27;s north side, drawing students from a wide area. In 2013, Aspley East State School celebrated its 50th anniversary.

Aspley State High School opened on 29 January 1963. It was originally to be called Zillmere State High School but was renamed on 17 January 1963.

Aspley Special School opened on 6 November 1973.

== Transport ==
Aspley is primarily accessed by Gympie Road, the primary artery in Brisbane&#x27;s northern suburbs. Other primary roads are Albany Creek Road to the west and Robinson Road to the east.

Public transport is provided by buses operated by Transport for Brisbane, Translink, Hornibrook Bus Lines. Brisbane&#x27;s tram network originally terminated just south of Aspley on Gympie Road at Chermside. The closest railway stations are Geebung and Zillmere.

In the 1961 Brisbane City Council Town Plan, the concept of a northern suburbs&#x27; expressway between Bowen Hills and Aspley was first proposed. The expressway would travel along the eastern side of Lutwyche Road to Park Road at Kedron, take a northerly route to Chermside and through the eastern side of Aspley, before heading north-westerly through Carseldine to connect with the Bruce Highway north of Bald Hills.
The freeway system was to be constructed between 1965 and 1985 in four five-year stages. However, by 1972, opposition was voicing concerns about inadequate compensation for resumed properties, the housing crisis at the time, and neglected public transport. By 1975 the freeway plan had been abandoned due to community opposition and funding issues.

Land planning in the 1980s has protected the land corridor of the original Northwest Freeway between Alderley and Carseldine. The corridor is most obvious in the suburb running parallel to Trouts Road in the suburb&#x27;s west. It is referred to as the Northwest Transport Corridor and remains in current planning standards as a four-lane median-divided road . There is speculation that the corridor may form part of a western bypass road which will link the Western Freeway with the Bruce Highway. Another proposal has been for a light-rail system to connect Caboolture and Ferny Grove lines.

<text>The Daihatsu Midget is a single-seater mini-truck, later a microvan/kei truck made by Japanese automaker Daihatsu. Several distinct vehicles have borne the Midget name over the years, but all have had in common a single or two-seat utilitarian design, with an enclosed or semi-enclosed cab.

== First generation (DK/DS/MP; 1957–1972) ==

=== DK/DS series ===

In August 1957 the original DKA Midget was introduced. It featured three wheels, a single seat, a doorless cab, and handlebar steering. The engine was an air-cooled two-stroke single-cylinder design of 250 cc (ZA) which produced . Beginning in August 1959 it was replaced by the more comfortable DSA, which has doors and a more powerful version of the ZA engine. Maximum cargo capacity was also increased, from . A DK model appears in &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; (1988).

There was also a rare two-seat version (DSAP), with the passenger seat offset to the left behind the driver. This required a longer passenger compartment, which encroached on the cargo area. There was also the DSV, a panel van version.

=== MP series ===
In October 1959 the MP2 Midget was introduced in Japan - updated with such features as a steering wheel, doors, and seating for two. This model had already been sold in the United States since April 1959, as the MPA, although it was marketed as the &quot;Daihatsu Trimobile&quot;. Companies such as Boeing and Lockheed used these little vehicles inside of their plants, for instance. The engine was the same (ZA) air-cooled two-stroke one-cylinder design with but an extra made for a sluggish vehicle. The DSA continued to be built alongside the more expensive MP variants into the early sixties. There was again a panel van version also available.

Subsequent revisions to the MP design were soon made, resulting in the model MP3 which has the larger &quot;ZD&quot; engine of 305 cc which produced . In May 1960 the longer MP4 arrived, featuring roll-up door windows. In August 1961 the doors were modified, now incorporating a triangular vent window and a chromed side strip. In September 1962 the final iteration, the MP5, arrived. It was again somewhat larger than the earlier MP4, with maximum length up to and cargo space increased by , to a total of . As a matter of fact, nearly all body panels were altered in some way, with new marker lights installed, redesigned doors, a blunter and more rounded front, bigger vent openings in front of the doors&#x27; leading edge, and finally a solid metal roof rather than the earlier fabric-covered opening. The MP5 also gained more chrome trim, around the headlamps and elsewhere. April 1963 saw the introduction of automatic oil mixing for the two-stroke engine. In August 1969 new safety regulations required certain lighting changes, a driver&#x27;s side headrest, and seatbelts. The MP5 remained in production until December 1971, and on sale into 1972.

By 1972, after 336,534 units had been produced, production was terminated because of the falling popularity of three-wheeled models in favor of more modern four-wheeled models.

The Midget I has also been sold outside Japan as the &quot;Bajaj&quot;, &quot;Tri-Mobile&quot;, or &quot;Bemo&quot; (Bemos in Indonesia are used as autorickshaw share taxis). It is one of the first cars manufactured by the Japanese automaker Daihatsu, known for its low cost, practical vehicles. Thai production began in 1959, with Indonesia, Pakistan, and many other countries soon following. Almost exclusively used as an autorickshaw (or &#x27;tuk-tuk&#x27;) the Midget was also a well known icon of public transportation in South Asia. Not meant for performance, this narrow vehicle does weave through larger traffic well, despite the fact that it only has three wheels. These original tuk-tuks are a little harder to find in modern times.

In Thailand the Midget MP4 is still in production as a Chinnaraje Midget in Chiang Mai and as a TukTuk Midget MP4 in Bangkok. The facelifted version, known as &quot;MP5&quot; is also still manufactured by the &quot;TukTuk (Thailand) Co., Ltd.&quot; in Bangkok.

== Second generation (K100; 1996–2001) ==

From 1996 to 2001, Daihatsu manufactured a four-wheeled kei Midget with rear and four-wheel drive as well as air conditioning as options. As Kei cars, they were equipped with 660 cc engines.

The Midget II was introduced as a concept at the 1993 Tokyo Motor Show. There are two types of engine available, differentiated by the injection type, one being electronic. Both are identical in width and height, but the EFI (Electronic Fuel Injection) version is shorter by 75 mm. They are available in either one- or two-seater configurations, with automatic and manual transmissions available. The Midget is often used by owners of bars in Japan, as they are a perfect size to haul around kegs. The design of the Midget is somewhat unusual with the spare tire mounted on the front.

<text>Peacock Records was an American record label, founded in 1949 by Don Robey in Houston, Texas, United States.

==History==
Robey established the record label in 1949 after two years of being blues singer Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown&#x27;s manager, and Brown not finding commercial success with Aladdin Records. Named after Robey&#x27;s Houston nightclub, the Bronze Peacock, the record label&#x27;s roster expanded to include such notable rhythm and blues artists as Marie Adams, James Booker, Clarence &quot;Gatemouth&quot; Brown, Little Richard, Memphis Slim, and former gospel singer Jackie Verdell. In 1953, Big Mama Thornton&#x27;s &quot;Hound Dog&quot; (later covered by Elvis Presley) was a hit for Peacock. The label also dabbled in jazz, releasing albums by vocalist Betty Carter and saxophonist Sonny Criss.

In 1952, Robey gained control of the Duke Records label of Memphis, Tennessee, and formed Duke-Peacock Records.

Peacock also had a very successful gospel music division, which released music from such notable gospel artists as the Dixie Hummingbirds, the Mighty Clouds of Joy, the Sensational Nightingales, the Five Blind Boys of Mississippi, Reverend Cleophus Robinson, the Gospelaires, the Pilgrim Jubilee Singers, the Loving Sisters, and gospel/jazz group Together (1975), which included saxophonist Felix &quot;Top Cat&quot; Dixon.

At the end of 1963, the label launched the gospel subsidiary label Song Bird Records which featured Inez Andrews. In the later 1960s, Peacock again began to issue secular soul singles by artists such as Jackie Verdell, the Inspirations, Little Frankie Lee, Al &#x27;TNT&#x27; Bragg and Bud Harper. This later Peacock label featured a bright multi-colored peacock tail on an otherwise blue label background, and it is these later records which are often sought by Northern soul collectors.

The Duke-Peacock family of labels (which also included Back Beat and Sure Shot) was sold to ABC Dunhill Records of Los Angeles on May 23, 1973, with label founder Don Robey staying with ABC as a consultant until his death in 1975. The label name was changed to ABC/Peacock in 1974.

After ABC was sold to MCA Records in 1979, MCA briefly operated an MCA/Songbird label with new signings including Little Anthony (of Little Anthony and the Imperials) and Dan Peek (formerly of the group America). The previous rosters of both ABC-Peacock and ABC-Songbird were dropped (MCA later reissued several Peacock and Song Bird albums at budget price). MCA briefly revived the Peacock name for a series of CD reissues (&quot;Peacock Gospel Classics&quot;) in the late 1990s. Along with the MCA back catalog, the Peacock and Song Bird masters are now controlled by the Geffen Records unit of Universal Music Group.

<text>The Kromme Rijn (; &quot;Crooked Rhine&quot;, for its many bends) is a river in the central Netherlands.

In Roman times, this northernmost branch of the Rhine delta was the main distributary of this major European river. Along its banks the Romans built their frontier castella part of the &quot;Limes Germanicus&quot;.

Since the Middle Ages, however, the stream lost its importance as it silted up, and eventually it is nearly cut off from the Nederrijn-Lek main artery. Yet it retained the name &quot;Rhine&quot;.

The Kromme Rijn splits off the Nederrijn-Lek main artery at the old town of Wijk bij Duurstede (called Dorestad in the early medieval period), after which it twists and turns through the province of Utrecht, past the towns of Cothen, Werkhoven, Odijk and Bunnik, and ends in the moat of the city of Utrecht.

Originally, the city of Utrecht was built by the Romans at a ford near the place where the Kromme Rijn forks into rivers Vecht (north) and Leidse Rijn (west); the last stretch within the city walls, however, was channelised to form the Oudegracht canal. Rivers Leidse Rijn and Vecht extend from the city moat and are the continuation of the Kromme Rijn.</text><links>

<doc id="925949" wikidata="Q671682" url="?curid=925949" title="Arthur De Greef (composer)">
<text>Arthur De Greef (10 October 186229 August 1940) was a Belgian classical pianist and composer of the romantic era.

==Life and career==
Born in Louvain, he won first prize in a local music competition at the age of 11 and subsequently enrolled at the Brussels Conservatoire. His main teacher there was Louis Brassin, a former pupil of Ignaz Moscheles, although he also took lessons from other staffers at the institution, including Joseph Dupont, François-Auguste Gevaert and Fernand Kufferath.

After graduating with high distinction from the Conservatoire at the age of 17, De Greef went to Weimar to complete his studies under Franz Liszt. He was a pupil of Liszt for two years.

Following the Weimar sojourn, De Greef embarked on a career as a concert pianist, travelling widely. He was a friend of Edvard Grieg, whose Piano Concerto he had played publicly in 1898, and who called him &quot;the best performer of my music I have met with&quot;. In addition, he enjoyed the endorsement of Camille Saint-Saëns. British critic Jonathan Woolf has written: &quot;De Greef was, in all respects, an intensely musical, non-sensationalist, eloquent and impressive musician and whilst not being averse to some of the interventionist tactics of his contemporaries (retouching of the score) remained sympathetically self-effacing&quot;.

De Greef composed a sizeable quantity of music, virtually all of which is now unknown. Among his works are two piano concertos. He was a devoted teacher, and taught piano at the Brussels Conservatoire for many years.

<doc id="925951" wikidata="Q5021551" url="?curid=925951" title="Call Me Bwana">
<text>Call Me Bwana is a 1963 British Technicolor farce film starring Bob Hope and Anita Ekberg and directed by Gordon Douglas.

Largely set in Africa, it was the only film made by Eon Productions not about the fictional MI6 agent James Bond until the 2014 film &quot;The Silent Storm&quot;. It was made by most of the same crew as &quot;Dr. No&quot;.

==Plot==
Bob Hope plays Matt Merriwether, a New York writer who has passed off his uncle&#x27;s memoirs of explorations in Africa as his own. Merriwether lives his false reputation as a great white hunter to the point of living in a Manhattan apartment furnished to look like an African safari lodge complete with sound effects records of African fauna. Based on his false reputation as an &quot;Africa Expert&quot;, he is recruited by the United States Government and NASA to locate a missing secret space probe before it can be located by hostile forces.

Hope&#x27;s co-stars include Edie Adams and Anita Ekberg playing secret agents. Golfer Arnold Palmer also makes a brief cameo, playing a crazy round of golf with Hope—a scene revisited in the film &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; where Hope makes a cameo appearance and plays golf through a tent. A scene involving an unseen President John F. Kennedy in his famous rocking chair is parodied with his Russian counterpart Nikita Khrushchev rocking in a chair that squeaks loudly.

==Cast==
* Bob Hope as Matt Merriwether
* Anita Ekberg as Luba (Anita Ekberg&#x27;s spoken dialogue was dubbed by voice actress Nikki van der Zyl)
* Edie Adams as Frederica
* Lionel Jeffries as Ezra Mungo
* Arnold Palmer as himself
* Orlando Martins as Tribal chief
* Percy Herbert as First Henchman
* Paul Carpenter as Col. Spencer
* Al Mulock as Second Henchman
* Bari Jonson as Uta
* Peter Dyneley as Williams
* Mai Ling as Hyacinth
* Mark Heath as Koba
* Robert Nichols as American Major
* Neville Monroe as Reporter
* Mike Moyer as Reporter

==Production==
According to Albert R. Broccoli&#x27;s autobiography &quot;When the Snow Melts&quot;, Eon Productions was originally contracted by United Artists to make two films a year for them: one &quot;James Bond&quot; film and one non-&quot;Bond&quot; film. Many original suggestions were meant to showcase Sean Connery, who turned them all down, as he did not want his career totally in the hands of Eon.

When asked by journalist and close Broccoli affiliate Donald Zec if they had any ideas for their non-&quot;Bond&quot; film, Harry Saltzman, who had previously made &quot;The Iron Petticoat&quot; with Hope, suggested a Bob Hope movie. Zec replied that he had seen a British rock and roll group called The Beatles that had sellout crowds and thought about featuring them in a film. Saltzman laughed and asked why he would want to make a film about four young long-haired kids from Liverpool when he had Bob Hope. United Artists made the Beatles film with Walter Shenson and &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot; was more successful than &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot;.

The film was originally intended to be shot entirely on location in Kenya but the problems of the Mau Mau Uprising led the producers to only have second unit cinematography led by John Coquillon.

Edie Adams thought that she was actually going to Africa and had painful inoculations. She remembered that the film seemed to be written as it went along; initially her character was a nuclear scientist, then a big-game hunter. One day on the set, she met a stuntwoman dressed like her character, throwing a male stuntman in a jiu jitsu throw; Adams realised that now her character was a secret agent. Adams&#x27; original role was given to Anita Ekberg, but as Hope had promised Adams a role, the script was rewritten to add a new female character.

In fact, the film was indeed being written during shooting. In October 1962, after being in production for two weeks, producer Broccoli hired novelist Paul Jarrico to do a &quot;fast rewrite.&quot; Six writers had already worked on the script, &quot;hundreds of jokes had been written about a bumbling explorer and a CIA agent searching for a U.S. space capsule in Africa, but no filmable story had emerged.&quot; Jarrico believed the script needed logic. Broccoli subsequently paid Jarrico $2,500 for four weeks&#x27; uncredited work.

Production director Syd Cain recalled that originally wild African animals from British zoos were to be released onto the golf course sequence but the idea was shelved when they caused expensive damage.

Spoofing a scene from &quot;Dr. No&quot;, Hope&#x27;s character is asleep in a tent when a tarantula begins crawling up his leg. A similar thing had happened to James Bond in the first 007 film, played seriously, rather than for laughs.

&quot;Call Me Bwana&quot; is &quot;plugged&quot; in Eon Productions&#x27; 1963 &quot;Bond&quot; film &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; during a sequence where Ali Kerim Bey assassinates the Russian agent Krilencu with a sniper rifle. Krilencu attempts to escape through a window, which is situated in Anita Ekberg&#x27;s mouth, on the wall-sized poster: &quot;She should have kept her mouth shut,&quot; Bond says. In the original novel by Ian Fleming, published in 1957, the scene happens in a trapdoor situated in Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s mouth on a poster for &quot;Niagara&quot;. Production of &quot;From Russia with Love&quot; actually began three days prior to the UK release of &quot;Call Me Bwana&quot;.

The next non-Bond Eon Productions release would not be until the 2014 film &quot;The Silent Storm&quot;, followed by &quot;Film Stars Don&#x27;t Die in Liverpool&quot; in 2017.

==Soundtrack==
The film was scored by Monty Norman. John Barry claimed that Norman contacted him to orchestrate his theme &quot;The Big Safari,&quot; but the film&#x27;s orchestration was eventually credited to Muir Mathieson. Barry released a recording of &quot;The Big Safari&quot; as well as another United Artists comedy &quot;The Mouse on the Moon&quot; under a pseudonym of &quot;The Countdowns&quot;. Bob Hope sang the title song over the end credits.
