<text>Michael &quot;Doc&quot; Emrick (born August 1, 1946) is an American former network television play-by-play sportscaster and commentator noted mostly for his work in ice hockey. He was the lead announcer for National Hockey League national telecasts on both NBC and NBCSN. Among the many awards Emrick has received is the NHL&#x27;s Lester Patrick Award in 2004, making him the first of only six to have received the award for media work, and the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award by the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2008. He has also won nine national Emmy Awards for excellence in sports broadcasting, the only hockey broadcaster to be honored with even one. On December 12, 2011, Emrick became the first member of the media to be inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In 2017, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listed Emrick as the sportscaster of the year.

==Biography==

===Background===
Emrick had his sights set on being a baseball announcer before attending his first hockey game on December 10, 1960, at Fort Wayne&#x27;s Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, when the Fort Wayne Komets hosted the Muskegon Zephyrs. He soon began to call Komets games into a tape recorder, and was mentored by longtime broadcaster Bob Chase. Emrick graduated from Southwood Junior-Senior High School in Wabash, Indiana, in 1964. He earned a B.Sc. in speech from Manchester University in 1968 and a M.A. in radio/television from Miami University in 1969. He then received a Ph.D. in communications (radio/television/film) from Bowling Green State University in 1976, hence his nickname, &quot;Doc&quot;.

Emrick taught speech and broadcasting at Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania from 1969 to 1971 and got his first experience of the NHL covering the Pittsburgh Penguins as an unpaid correspondent for &quot;The Beaver County Times&quot; newspaper.

===Broadcasting career===
Emrick began sportscasting professionally in 1973 when he was hired by Port Huron Flags&#x27; GM Morris Snider to do play-by-play on WHLS radio and public relations for the IHL team. In 1977, he took on the same two roles with the first year AHL Maine Mariners for three seasons (broadcasting that club&#x27;s Calder Cup championships in both 1978 and 1979). Emrick then served as the New Jersey Devils&#x27; first voice after moving to the state, arriving for the 1982–83 NHL season, and stayed there until 1986.

Emrick wore several hats in the 1980s working for the Philadelphia Flyers. He was a spot announcer for Flyers home broadcasts from 1983 to 1986, then was an in-studio analyst between 1986-88 when not covering national games. Emrick was promoted to the lead play-by-play slot for both local TV and cable for the team in 1988, remaining with the Flyers until the end of the 1992–93 season. He was paired with former NHLer and national hockey broadcaster Bill Clement for four years.

In 1993, he returned to the Devils to replace Gary Thorne and continued to be the Devils&#x27; voice until July 2011. He announced the Devils&#x27; 1995 Stanley Cup victory alongside color commentator John Davidson for the national United States broadcast on Fox.

====National work====
Emrick has also done play-by-play for CBS, NBC (and its cable network subsidiary NBC Sports Network, formerly OLN and Versus), ABC, TNT, ESPN, Fox, CSTV, SportsChannel America, SportsChannel Philadelphia, PRISM, Fox Sports Net, and others.

He was the lead play-by-play announcer for &quot;The NHL on ESPN&quot; from 1986 to 1988 alongside lead color commentator Bill Clement. His first national over-the-air television work came in 1992 doing ice hockey at the XVI Winter Olympic Games at Albertville, France, for CBS. Emrick became the lead play-by-play announcer for the &quot;NHL on Fox&quot;, calling regular-season games and Stanley Cup Finals from 1995 to 1999. After Fox relinquished the NHL broadcast rights to ABC, he became a regional announcer for &quot;NHL on ABC&quot; from 2000 to 2004. He only called select playoff games at the time, but he did file reports for ABC Sports and ESPN&#x27;s Stanley Cup Finals coverage.

Before the 2005–06 NHL season, he was named the lead play-by-play announcer for the &quot;NHL on Versus&quot; (previously &quot;The NHL on OLN&quot;) and the &quot;NHL on NBC&quot;, and since 2008, has served as an overall host of the telecast. He called the top Conference Final, and the entire Stanley Cup Finals for both networks. He has called games in 22 Stanley Cup Finals on TV (for NBC, ESPN, Fox, Versus and OLN), more than any other American broadcaster. He has also called 14 NHL All-Star Games for NBC, Fox, OLN, VERSUS, and ESPN. Therefore, he is considered a hockey wizard.

Emrick called the 1996 World Cup of Hockey for the Prime Network and the 2004 World Cup of Hockey for ESPN.

Emrick has worked five Olympic Games for NBC. He has also worked during the Olympics, twice for CBS and once for TNT. For NBC, he called water polo in the 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ice hockey at the 2006, 2010 and the 2014 Winter Olympics alongside Eddie Olczyk and &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Pierre McGuire.

With CBS, he called some National Football League and men&#x27;s NCAA basketball tournament games. One notable assignment for Emrick was the first game for Brett Favre as a member of the Green Bay Packers, including the first pass Favre ever threw as a Packer, which ended up being to himself. Emrick also called the National Lacrosse League All-Star Game and Championship Game while at NBC.

On July 21, 2011, Emrick announced that he was leaving the New Jersey Devils to work exclusively for NBC Sports. Starting in the 2011–12 season, Steve Cangialosi replaced him for play-by-play duties for the Devils.

On May 5, 2014, EA Sports announced that Emrick would provide play-by-play commentary for &quot;NHL 15&quot; along color commentator Eddie Olczyk and &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Ray Ferraro. The trio provided commentary for five years until James Cybulski replaced him in &quot;NHL 20&quot;. From 2018 to 2020, &quot;Inside-the-Glass&quot; reporter Brian Boucher joined the lead duo for national games.

====Retirement====
On October 19, 2020, following a playoff run calling hockey games remotely from his home in Michigan due to restrictions imposed by the national outbreak of coronavirus disease, Emrick announced his retirement from broadcasting. At the time of his retirement, Emrick released a video essay in which he declared:

Kenny Albert succeeded Emrick for what would ultimately become NBC&#x27;s final season broadcasting the NHL before the American national television rights moved over to ABC/ESPN and Turner Sports. On February 21, NBC Sports presented a documentary about him. NBC&#x27;s final NHL telecast was Game 5 of the 2021 Stanley Cup Finals on July 7. Following the end of the subsequent postgame coverage on NBCSN, the network aired a 13-minute video montage, narrated by Emrick (who had taken the role as a contributor in the final &quot;NHL on NBC&quot; season), discussing various innovations that NBC had brought to their NHL coverage over the past 15 seasons as well as highlights and human interest stories that had occurred along the way as well. At the end of the video, Emrick signed off for NBC&#x27;s coverage with the following:

====National Football League====
As previously mentioned, Emrick called a handful of NFL games for CBS in 1992 and 1993. Emrick was paired on commentary with Matt Millen in 1992 and Hank Stram in 1993 and Week 5 of the 1992 season. Notably, Emrick was the announcer for Brett Favre&#x27;s first NFL start in 1992 (Packers/Buccaneers), wherein Favre&#x27;s first completed pass was deflected to himself.

==Style==
The Devils&#x27; broadcasting pair of Emrick and color commentator Glenn &quot;Chico&quot; Resch were noted for their ability to break the tension of a hockey game through various types of humor, many times improvised and unintentional. For example, in a game during the 2008–09 NHL season, Resch was discussing a rebound that came off Devils netminder Scott Clemmensen:

Other recurring comedic bits arise during games. After Emrick or Resch analyzes the play of a goaltender, if Emrick feels that Resch is sympathizing towards the goalie due to his former play at the same position, Emrick will add a sarcastic comment which talks about the glory of goaltending and how they are &quot;by far&quot; the most important players in the game. Another comedic bit that is shared between Emrick and Resch is when Emrick will ask Resch where a particular town or city in Canada is located when they talk about a player&#x27;s home town. In the event of an odd play or bounce of the puck, Emrick has cited &quot;the unseen hand&quot;, as the culprit, which always gets a laugh from Resch. However, Emrick&#x27;s most famous and unique saying is &quot;my goodness&quot; usually being said when there is a remarkable save by a goaltender or when there is a sequence of plays having high amounts of &quot;energy&quot; on the ice.

Emrick&#x27;s knowledge of the game of hockey has been deemed &quot;encyclopedic&quot;, and he is known for his eloquent vocabulary. He employs an unusual vocabulary to describe play-by-play action, referring to a goaltender&#x27;s equipment as &quot;paraphernalia&quot;, for instance. Often, during line changes or zone clearings, Emrick will discuss interesting facts about a player&#x27;s personal life, hockey records, or contributions to sports. In addition, sportswriter Peter King has praised Emrick by saying &quot;Doc Emrick is one hell of a hockey announcer. If hockey were big in this country, he&#x27;d be what Jack Buck used to be.&quot;

==Miscellaneous==
Emrick is a founding member, and still president, of the NHL Pronunciation Guide, which is used as a guide for all NHL broadcasters for some of hockey&#x27;s most difficult names. He is Vice President of the NHL Broadcaster&#x27;s Association, and he is also a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame Selection Committee. Emrick also hosted a weekly podcast on iTunes called &quot;Emrick&#x27;s Angle&quot; which offers his current thoughts on the NHL.

Emrick is an avid Pittsburgh Pirates fan. He grew up listening to Bob Prince on KDKA Radio. He attended a game in which Garrett Jones became the first Pirates player to hit a home run into the Allegheny River on the fly. On June 11, 2014, he was interviewed on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; by Melissa Block discussing his career and style. In 2016, Emrick attended Pirates spring training in Bradenton, Florida and called a few innings of one game on television and radio with Pirates broadcasters Greg Brown and John Wehner. On July 8, 2016, Emrick called his first MLB regular-season game at PNC Park, when the Pirates hosted the Chicago Cubs for MLB Network. The Pirates won the game, 8–4, with Emrick calling some of the action with Bob Costas.

When his NBC broadcast schedule permitted, Emrick travelled to Hershey, Pennsylvania, each year to announce the Hershey Bears&#x27; Hall of Fame inductees. He has also voiced the narration for the American Hockey League Hall of Fame&#x27;s induction videos, and returned to Hershey in 2011 to serve as TV play-by-play voice for the AHL All-Star Game.

Emrick&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Off Mike: How a Kid from Basketball-Crazy Indiana Became America&#x27;s NHL Voice&quot; was released the day after his retirement announcement in October 2020.

==Personal life==

Doc lives in St. Clair, Michigan with his wife Joyce. They have no children, but they spend time with their dogs and six horses. Emrick is a Christian.

Emrick is a cancer survivor, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer in 1991.

<doc id="912670" wikidata="Q2602780" url="?curid=912670" title="Alice in Wonderland (1966 TV play)">
<text>Alice in Wonderland is a 1966 BBC television play, shot on film, based on Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. It was adapted, produced and directed by Jonathan Miller, then best known for his appearance in the satirical revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s production is unique among live-action &quot;Alice&quot; films in that he consciously avoided the standard Tenniel-inspired costume design and &quot;florid&quot; production values. Most of the Wonderland characters are played by actors in standard Victorian dress, with a real cat used to represent the Cheshire Cat. Miller justified his approach as an attempt to return to what he perceived as the essence of the story: &quot;Once you take the animal heads off, you begin to see what it&#x27;s all about. A small child, surrounded by hurrying, worried people, thinking &#x27;Is that what being grown up is like?&#x27;&quot;

Unlike many 1960s BBC productions, the play survived destruction, and was issued onto DVD by both the BFI and the BBC themselves.

==Cast==
* John Gielgud as the Mock Turtle
* Peter Cook as the Mad Hatter
* Leo McKern as the Ugly Duchess

==Production==
Interiors were filmed at Netley Hospital, a mid-19th-century building that was demolished not long after the film was made. Also known as the Royal Victoria Military Hospital, Netley Hospital was the world&#x27;s longest building at the time it was completed. Beach scenes with the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle were filmed at Pett Level in East Sussex. The courtroom scene was recorded at the BBC&#x27;s Ealing Studios and involved the building of the largest set that Stage 2 at Ealing had ever seen.

In July 1966 the BBC spent three days at Donington Hall filming the &#x27;Pool of Tears&#x27; and the &#x27;Caucus Race&#x27; scenes for Jonathan Miller&#x27;s production. The Caucus Race was filmed in the cellars.

<text>The I Airborne Corps was an airborne forces corps raised by the British Army during the Second World War. Together with the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps it was part of the First Allied Airborne Army.

==Formation==
Under the command of Lieutenant-General Frederick Arthur Montague Browning, &quot;I Airborne Corps&quot; was formed in 1943, with the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions under command. The Corps also contained the Special Air Service&#x27;s SAS Brigade. In August 1944, the corps became part of the First Allied Airborne Army, alongside U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps.

Later in the war, as well as the 1st and 6th Airborne Divisions, the corps had the 1st Special Service Brigade, the Polish 1st Parachute Brigade and the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division an air-transportable division under corps command. Other units assigned to the corps were the American 82nd, and 101st Airborne Divisions during Operation Market Garden in September 1944. Lieutenant-General Richard Nelson Gale, who had previously commanded the 6th Airborne Division during the Battle of Normandy, took command of the corps in December 1944.

Komando refers to herself on her web page as &quot;America&#x27;s Digital Goddess&quot;. , her website, Komando.com, serves 2.7 million unique visitors each month and she sends 500 million newsletters per year to subscribers.

Komando and her husband own Phoenix-based WestStar TalkRadio Network, which distributes the Komando radio program.

Komando has appeared on CNN, CBS, MSNBC, ABC, BBC, and Fox News, and her syndicated columns appear in &quot;USA Today&quot; and other newspapers. She has been a columnist for &quot;USA Today&quot; since February 2002. She won the Gracie Award from the Alliance for Women in Media for Outstanding Program Host in 2007 and in April 2016 was the keynote speaker at the NAB Show Radio Luncheon to an audience of industry leaders. In January 2017, she was appointed to Forbes Magazine Tech Council. On October 9, 2019, she presented a keynote speech about cybersecurity at the John Glenn NASA Research Center in Cleveland that was broadcast to all 60,000 NASA employees. In 2020, she was nominated to the National Radio Hall of Fame. In 2021, Kim was nominated again and this time inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Komando was raised in Watchung, New Jersey.

Her father, Richard Paul &quot;Dick&quot; Komando, served in the Army during the Korean War and was a management employee for United Airlines. Her mother, Virginia, was a senior systems analyst with Bell Laboratories. Kim is the youngest of four, with a brother and two sisters.

Kim says in her profile that she first used a computer at nine years of age. She graduated eighth grade from Watchung&#x27;s Valley View School in 1978. She attended the nearby Catholic private high school for girls, Mount St. Mary Academy, where she was elected to the McAuley Chapter of the National Honor Society in 1981. After graduating from high school in 1981, one year ahead of schedule as a junior, and having skipped a grade, she attended Arizona State University. While in school, she started her own business to train people how to use their computers. She graduated from Arizona State University&#x27;s W. P. Carey School of Business in 1985, at the age of 19, with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Information Systems.

She is frequently asked if &quot;Kim Komando&quot; is her real name, which it is. The name &quot;Komando&quot; is Russian-Ukrainian.

== Career ==
Kim Komando started out in sales, working for IBM, AT&amp;T and Unisys. At Unisys, she sold mainframe systems. She sold Honeywell a Unisys system valued at $11 million. Komando wrote a column about computers for the &quot;Arizona Business Gazette&quot; while hosting a call-in talk show on computers. It aired late at night on KFYI in Phoenix, Arizona.

In 1992, she formed &quot;The Komando Corporation&quot; with herself as President/CEO and her mother as Secretary. She quit sales at Unisys to focus on her syndicated newspaper column and radio show. However, she was only earning $60 a week from the column and show combined. Komando developed computer training tapes that she wrote, hosted, and called &quot;Komputer Tutor&quot;, which she sold via an infomercial. Over 150,000 tapes were sold for $80 to $120 each. The second generation of tapes included Prodigy. America Online was included with the third generation of tapes. Kim Komando negotiated a role running the computer section on AOL&#x27;s site. The domain Komando.com hosted &quot;Kim Komando&#x27;s Komputer Klinic&quot; for several years.

Komando was the Technology Editor of Popular Mechanics Magazine from 1995 to 1998. She has been a weekly columnist for USA Today since February 2002. She has written 12 books on computers and technology.

Through her charitable trust, she sponsors a scholarship for students on her path, female CIS students at her alma mater, W. P. Carey School of Business at ASU.

===Radio broadcasting===

In the mid-1990s, Komando started the WestStar TalkRadio Network (now WestStar Multimedia) with her husband. They built their first studio in 1994. In 1994, ABC and CBS Radio passed on the show, saying a national radio show on the subject would be unsuccessful, as computers and the Internet were a fad.

In 2015, the staff of WestStar moved into a $7.5 million, 24,000-square-foot multimedia facility with radio studios and production facilities for TV shows and podcasts.

In 2016, Komando was the Keynote Speaker at the National Association of Broadcasters convention in Las Vegas.

In 2017, Komando was nominated for the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Marconi Radio Award in the Network/Syndicated Personality of the Year category.

In 2021, Komando was nominated and inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame. She had previously been nominated in 2018, 2019 and 2020.

The Kim Komando radio show airs on more than 435 radio stations in the U.S. and in 177 countries on Armed Forces Radio. The Kim Komando television show premiered globally on Bloomberg TV on January 5, 2019.

WestStar&#x27;s radio offerings diversified into a number of other radio formats, among them: &quot;Your Weekend&quot;, an adult contemporary music program hosted by pianist Jim Brickman; &quot;Quiet Music&quot;, a smooth jazz program hosted by Nick Francis; &quot;Goddard&#x27;s Gold&quot; and &quot;The &#x27;70s&quot;, classic hits/oldies programs hosted by Phoenix-area disc jockey Steve Goddard; and &quot;The Other Side with Steve Godfrey&quot;, a call-in talk show in which the title host attempted to communicate with spirits. As of 2020, WestStar continues to distribute Komando&#x27;s two daily national radio shows and the weekend show and &quot;An American Christmas&quot;, an annual Christmas special produced by Mannheim Steamroller.

== Personal life ==
Komando is married to Barry Young, who is her business partner and former host of &quot;The Nearly Famous Barry Young Show&quot;, a local radio show on KFYI in Phoenix until November 2014. They have one son. She is a practicing Catholic.

Komando splits her time between her homes in Phoenix, Santa Barbara, and Beverly Hills. She has full broadcast studios in all locations. She is an avid car collector and owns a Ferrari F8 Tributo, Ferrari F12 Berlinetta, Porsche 911 Turbo S, Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, Mercedes-AMG GTR Roadster, Mercedes-AMG SL63, Mercedes-AMG G63 Edition 1, three other Mercedes-AMG G63s, Tesla Model S Plaid, Chevrolet Corvette (C8), 1946 Chevrolet Truck, 1961 Corvette, 1964 Jaguar E-Type, 1964 Ford Mustang, 1966 Custom Corvette, and a 1967 Corvette that was used in the movie Con Air.

<text>A mesh network is a local area network topology in which the infrastructure nodes (i.e. bridges, switches, and other infrastructure devices) connect directly, dynamically and non-hierarchically to as many other nodes as possible and cooperate with one another to efficiently route data to and from clients. 

This lack of dependency on one node allows for every node to participate in the relay of information. Mesh networks dynamically self-organize and self-configure, which can reduce installation overhead. The ability to self-configure enables dynamic distribution of workloads, particularly in the event a few nodes should fail. This in turn contributes to fault-tolerance and reduced maintenance costs.

Mesh topology may be contrasted with conventional star/tree local network topologies in which the bridges/switches are directly linked to only a small subset of other bridges/switches, and the links between these infrastructure neighbours are hierarchical. While star-and-tree topologies are very well established, highly standardized and vendor-neutral, vendors of mesh network devices have not yet all agreed on common standards, and interoperability between devices from different vendors is not yet assured.

== Basic principles ==
Mesh networks can relay messages using either a &quot;flooding&quot; or a &quot;routing&quot; technique, which makes them different from non-mesh networks. A routed message is propagated along a path by &quot;hopping&quot; from node to node until it reaches its destination. To ensure that all its paths are available, the network must allow for continuous connections and must reconfigure itself around broken paths, using &quot;self-healing&quot; algorithms such as Shortest Path Bridging and TRILL (Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links). Self-healing allows a routing-based network to operate when a node breaks down or when a connection becomes unreliable. The network is typically quite reliable, as there is often more than one path between a source and a destination in the network. Although mostly used in wireless situations, this concept can also apply to wired networks and to software interaction.

A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Fully connected wired networks are more secure and reliable: problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it. In such networks, however, the number of cables, and therefore the cost, goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases.

==Types==

=== Wired mesh ===
Shortest path bridging and TRILL each allow Ethernet switches to be connected in a mesh topology and allow for all paths to be active. IP routing supports multiple paths from source to destination.

===Wireless mesh===
A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It can also be a form of wireless ad hoc network.

<text>The Bay of Campeche (), or Campeche Sound, is a bight in the southern area of the Gulf of Mexico, forming the north side of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. It is surrounded on three sides by the Mexican states of Campeche, Tabasco and Veracruz. The area of the bay is and maximum depth of the bay is approximately . It was named by Francisco Hernández de Córdoba and Antón de Alaminos during their expedition in 1517.

==Oil resources==
The Cantarell Complex of five oil fields lies beneath the Bay of Campeche. In 2003, it was the second most productive oil field in the world, then supplying about two thirds of Mexico&#x27;s crude oil output, but it went into a steep decline soon thereafter.

On June 3, 1979, &quot;Ixtoc I&quot;, an exploratory oil well located in the bay, suffered a blowout that caused a catastrophic explosion, resulting in what has been ranked as the third largest unintentional oil spill in history.

==Climate==
During the months of June and July, the Bay of Campeche is considered one of the &quot;hot&quot; breeding spots for Atlantic hurricanes. 

It experiences strong winds from the north from November into February along its western edge, with the winds ultimately funneling between the mountains and out into the Pacific near Salina Cruz.

On the other hand, the bay is also known for being a hurricane &quot;graveyard&quot;, with unusually weak steering currents in the area causing hurricanes to slow down and meander, starving themselves (for example, Hurricane Roxanne in 1995). The bay is also considered the eastern border on the main migration routes for birds in the Americas.

<text>Woodland Park is a public park in Seattle&#x27;s Phinney Ridge and Green Lake neighborhoods that originated as the estate of Guy C. Phinney, lumber mill owner and real estate developer. Phinney died in 1893, and in 1902, the Olmsted Brothers firm of Boston was hired to design the city&#x27;s parks, including Woodland Park.

The park is split in half by Aurora Avenue N. (State Route 99). Its western half is mostly given over to the Woodland Park Zoo and also has a baseball field and children&#x27;s playground. Its eastern half, which is connected to the zoo by arched bridges over the highway and often called Lower Woodland Park, consists of trails, an off-leash dog park, a picnic area, ballfields, a pitch and putt golf course, horseshoe pits, skate park, and lawn bowling, and is contiguous with Green Lake Park.

==Wildlife in the park==
The park is home to many species of birds and mammals as well as a few reptile and amphibian species. The most notable species are the western coyote, rabbit, barred owl, and Red-eared slider (released turtle).

The most common bird species are: American crow, American goldfinch, American robin, Anna&#x27;s hummingbird, bald eagle, barn owl, barred owl, Bewick&#x27;s wren, black-capped chickadee, bushtit, European starling, house finch, hairy and downy woodpeckers, northern flicker, Oregon junco, rock dove, spotted towhee, Steller&#x27;s jay, various gulls, various sparrows, various swallows, and various waterfowl. The most common mammal species are: coyotes, coypus, feral rabbits, brown rats, western gray squirrels, mountain beavers, and North American beavers. The most common reptile and amphibian species are: red eared sliders, spring peepers and garter snakes.

==Warren G. Harding memorial==
In 1925, a memorial was erected in the park to commemorate the July 27, 1923 speech delivered by President Warren G. Harding before a crowd of over 30,000 Boy Scouts who were gathered at Woodland for a national jamboree. It was one of the last speeches the president would give; he died six days later in San Francisco.

The memorial was demolished in 1977, and the site now lies buried beneath the Woodland Park Zoo&#x27;s African Savanna exhibit. The memorial&#x27;s only surviving elements—two life-sized bronze statues of Boy Scouts that once saluted the image of Harding—were relocated to the headquarters of the Chief Seattle Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

<text>Kate Lockley is a fictional character created by Joss Whedon for &quot;Angel&quot;. She is portrayed by Elisabeth Röhm. Lockley first appears in the episode &quot;Lonely Heart&quot; as a young, skeptical detective for the Los Angeles Police Department. Gradually, she becomes more hardened as she learns of the supernatural world.

==Characterization and storylines==
Kate Lockley is a young police detective working for the LAPD, initially unaware of the supernatural. She first appears in &quot;Lonely Heart&quot;, investigating a case involving the brutal murders of several patrons of D&#x27;Oblique, a popular singles bar. After encountering Angel as he leaves the site of another murder, she instantly suspects him to be the killer, unaware that Angel had actually been attempting to stop the real killer. Angel escapes, and Kate becomes obsessed with finding him to the point that she searches the Angel Investigations offices without a warrant. After she is attacked by the real killer and saved by Angel, she helps him to bring the killer down. Kate subsequently clears Angel of all charges, and Angel offers his services to her whenever she needs them.

Kate&#x27;s subsequent encounters with Angel lead her to trust him as a helpful stranger, and she in turn, assists him, using her position on the police force to provide him with information.

Kate was raised by her widowed father, Trevor, who is also a police officer and taught her to put her emotions aside and to take care of herself at all costs. Through her father, she develops a complete devotion to her occupation, later on saying that being a cop is all she&#x27;s ever known and that she wouldn&#x27;t know what else to do. When she discovers that Angel is really a vampire and subsequently discovers his past as Angelus before his soul is restored, her black and white view of the world is shaken, and she delves into the darker side of Los Angeles. On one such investigation, Kate finds her father&#x27;s lifeless body—completely drained of blood by vampires.

After her father&#x27;s death, Kate&#x27;s relationship with Angel becomes strained and eventually adversarial. She becomes obsessed with ridding the city of vampires and other demons. Kate is the first to investigate any calls matching the &quot;otherworldly&quot; profile, even if it is out of her jurisdiction. She has an intense dislike for Wolfram &amp; Hart and the clients the law firm represents.

When a resurrected Darla frames Angel for murder and goes on a killing spree with Drusilla, Kate shows up as his arresting officer and lets him go as she believes he is the only one who can stop them. Although Angel catches them, he allows them to murder 13 lawyers, which causes Kate to distrust him again after she figures out that he not only let them murder but facilitated them by locking the doors.

Her obsession with supernatural cases becomes her own undoing: after Angel attacks a police captain who had brought back deceased police officers as zombies in an attempt to cut down on crime, along with her increasingly erratic and obsessive behavior, she is fired from the LAPD. Kate calls Angel and blames him for ruining her life, then attempts suicide by taking prescription pills with hard liquor. Angel hears her call and later goes to Kate&#x27;s apartment. When she does not respond to his energetic knocks, he breaks down her door, finds her lifeless body on the floor, picks her up and holds her under a cold shower to resuscitate her. After her life is saved, she thanks him and then tells him to leave. That evening, Kate and Angel talk and she forgives him, believing there is a higher power at work and they are not alone in the never-ending battle against the forces of darkness. When Angel asks her why, she replies that she never invited him into her apartment, yet he was able to break in and save her.

She never appears on the series again, due to Elisabeth Röhm joining the cast of &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;. However, she is mentioned again in &quot;Dead End&quot; soon after her last appearance-Angel mentions to his friends that they no longer have a friend in the LAPD.

Kate reappears in the seventh issue of &quot;&quot;, saving Connor from a group of demons, unaware that Connor is Angel&#x27;s son. She establishes an antiquities business after her departure from the LAPD, and uses her business connections to learn more about the supernatural and the occult. She stocks her hideout with an arsenal of ancient to modern weapons. She is seen leaving to blow up a demon army. This actual event takes place the same night as &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;. Some time later, after LA was restored to normal, she once again encounters Angel and reopens Angel Investigations. However, there are several difficulties due to Angel&#x27;s new fame status (since many clients are actually fans and admirers rather than people who need help), plus an upheaval in demonic activity. The current Angel Investigations consists of Angel, Kate, Connor and Gwen.

In the &quot;Angel &amp; Faith&quot; series, it is briefly mentioned by Gunn that Kate is back with the LAPD leading their new supernatural investigations unit, as the existence of the mystical world has since become public knowledge following the events of &quot;Chosen&quot; and &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;.

==Writing and acting==

* Kate was originally conceived as a much darker character. In the unproduced episode &quot;Corrupt,&quot; she was a detective deep undercover as a prostitute and addicted to drugs.
*Elisabeth Röhm said &quot;I thought Kate was this incredibly powerful young woman who is fantastic at what she does, but at the same time, just a girl. There&#x27;s a great line in &quot;Notting Hill&quot; when Julia Roberts says, &#x27;I&#x27;m just a girl wanting a boy to love me.&#x27; I think that&#x27;s a part of Kate and a part of everyone who is really great at what they do. They&#x27;re actually just the girl or boy who&#x27;s real and has the same problems as everybody else. She&#x27;s this tough, smart cookie, but she just wants to be loved and she doesn&#x27;t know how to do it.&quot;
*Röhm on the relationship between Kate and Angel: &quot;I think that Kate and Angel are kind of meant for each other but in a way, you can see them become best friends.&quot;
* Röhm on her character&#x27;s departure from &quot;Angel&quot;: &quot;Well, I was the first season of the show, I was part of the original cast and loved doing it, but by the second season, I had my own show on TNT called &quot;Bull&quot; so I had to go back &amp; forth between my show &amp; recurring on &quot;Angel&quot;, and then after that I was offered &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; and Joss &amp; I decided it would be impossible for me to go from New York (where I was a regular on &quot;Law &amp; Order)&quot; to Los Angeles for &quot;Angel&quot; and we had a great opportunity for it to end dramatically, and it was very satisfying for both of us.&quot;

<text>Holy Diver is the debut studio album by the American heavy metal band Dio, released in 1983. The album was acclaimed by the music press and is the band&#x27;s most successful album.

==History==
Released on May 25, 1983, the album has been hailed by critics as Dio&#x27;s best work and a classic staple in the heavy metal genre. The album was certified gold in the US on September 12, 1984, and platinum on March 21, 1989.
In the UK it attained Silver certification (60,000 units sold) by the British Phonographic Industry, achieving this in January 1986, at the same time as &quot;The Last in Line&quot;.

The original vinyl release had a photomontage LP-liner, with images from both Rainbow and Black Sabbath days.

The album was remastered and re-released by Rock Candy Records in 2005. The only notable addition to the original album is an audio interview with Ronnie James Dio. Tracks 10–19 on the 2005 edition are Dio&#x27;s answers to various questions about the album. The questions are not posed during the interview itself, but can be found inside the CD&#x27;s booklet instead. The album, along with &quot;The Last in Line&quot; and &quot;Sacred Heart&quot;, were released in a new two-CD deluxe edition on March 19, 2012 through Universal for worldwide distribution outside the U.S.

&quot;Caught in the Middle&quot; shares the main guitar riff with Campbell&#x27;s previous band Sweet Savage&#x27;s song &quot;Straight Through the Heart&quot; (1983), whose title was used for another song in this album.

===Album art===
The album art is illustrated by Randy Berrett. It features the band&#x27;s mascot Murray, a demonic creature, pulling or whipping a snapped metal chain and a man wearing a Catholic priest&#x27;s attire flailing and splashing around in a body of water, wrapped up and locked in the other end of the broken chain. Dio was quick to argue that appearances are misleading, that it could just as easily be a priest killing a devil, wanting people not to &quot;judge a book by its cover&quot;.

Murray is featured on several other Dio albums.

==Themes==
Around the time of making the album, a rise of heroic adventure elements in popular culture (such as J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; books and role-playing games &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;) were having influence. &quot;Much of heavy metal took place on similar turf, a realm of dark towers and impenetrable wilderness populated by battles and adversity.&quot; When Ronnie James Dio had been with Black Sabbath, &quot;He reverently refurbished and reinvented the band&#x27;s stately doom with grandiose concepts...Dio found a fertile fantasy framework for the big Sabbath themes of madness and desolation&quot;. Dio, who had read Sir Walter Scott, Arthurian tales, and science fiction growing up, had previously used fantasy lyrics in his early 1970s band Elf. He explained the influence of his youthful reading to an interviewer, saying, &quot;When I became a songwriter, I thought what better thing to do than do what no one else is doing...to tell fantasy tales. Smartest thing I ever did.&quot;

==Reception==

AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia praises the album, stating that &quot;aside from Ronnie&#x27;s unquestionably stellar songwriting, &quot;Holy Diver&quot;″s stunning quality and consistency owed much to his carefully chosen bandmates, including powerhouse drummer and fellow [Black] Sabbath survivor Vinny Appice, veteran bassist Jimmy Bain, and a phenomenal find in young Irish guitarist Vivian Campbell, whose tastefully pyrotechnic leads helped make this the definitive Dio lineup. &quot;Holy Diver&quot; remains the undisputed highlight of Dio&#x27;s career...and, indeed, one of the finest pure heavy metal albums of the 1980s.&quot; Canadian reviewer Martin Popoff describes the album as &quot;quintessential traditional metal&quot;, with Ronnie James Dio &quot;almost single-handedly reinventing gothic hard rock for the &#x27;80s, incorporating strong melodic hooks and more than the genre&#x27;s usual share of velvety, classical-based pyrotechnics.&quot; &quot;Kerrang!&quot; gave the album a positive review in 1983 and &quot;Holy Diver&quot; ended up at no. 5 in the British magazine&#x27;s End of Year list of best releases. Today, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; still considers it a &quot;perfect melodic metal album&quot; and an &quot;essential purchase&quot;.

The rock historian Ian Christe relates that for the post-Sabbath solo career &quot;Dio simplified his stories substantially for a younger heavy metal audience. The 1983 debut &quot;Holy Diver&quot;, by his band Dio, reduced lush moral landscapes to simple good-versus-evil conflicts, using the lyrical duality of &#x27;Rainbow in the Dark&#x27; and &#x27;Holy Diver&#x27; to raise questions about deceit and hypocrisy in romance and religion. In the sharp contrasts of Dio&#x27;s imagery, there was always a built-in contradiction that fed adolescent revolt: a black side to every white light, and a hidden secret behind every loud proclamation of truth. In a similar way, Dio&#x27;s music balanced torrents of rage with brief acoustic interludes.&quot;

On IGN&#x27;s list of &quot;Top 25 Metal Albums&quot;, &quot;Holy Diver&quot; is at number 8, and this statement followed, &quot;In all his bands, in all his roles, in all his musical vagabond choices, Ronnie James Dio has been fortunate enough to be associated with some of heavy metal&#x27;s best -- Sabbath, Rainbow, and his own band Dio. To best represent his tenure in the genre, one must look no farther than &quot;Holy Diver&quot;. His first album with his new band was also his best. It is one of metal&#x27;s best albums, and it spawned two of the greatest metal songs of the &#x27;80s: &#x27;Holy Diver&#x27; and &#x27;Rainbow in the Dark&#x27;. Featuring the underrated Vivian Campbell on guitar, this album showed that Dio could do it on his own.&quot; In 2017, it was ranked 16th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of &quot;100 Greatest Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.

<doc id="912719" wikidata="Q72671" url="?curid=912719" title="Günter Rexrodt">
<text>Günter Rexrodt (; 12 September 194119 August 2004) was a German politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) who served as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs in the fourth and fifth governments of Chancellor Helmut Kohl from 1993 to 1998. He lived in Berlin.

==Early life and education==
After the Abitur in 1960 in Arnstadt, Thuringia and an extra year in West Berlin, Rexrodt graduated with a Diplom in business studies from the Free University Berlin where he also received his doctorate (&quot;Dr. rer. pol&quot;) in 1971. 

==Career in the public sector==
From 1968 to 1979 Rexroth worked for the chamber of commerce in Berlin. From 1979 to 1982 he worked as a ressort manager at &quot;Office for Economy of the Federal State of Berlin&quot;.

In 1980, Rexrodt became a member of the FDP. From 1983 to 1987 – under the leadership of Walter Rasch – as well as from 1989 to 1994 – under Carola von Braun – he served as the alternate chair of the party in Berlin.

From 1982 to 1985 Rexrodt served as the State Secretary in the State Administration for Economic Affairs under Elmar Pieroth. From 1985 to 1989 he was the State Minister (&quot;Senator&quot;) for Economic Affairs of the federal state of Berlin, which was led by Governing Mayor Eberhard Diepgen.

==Career in the private sector==
From April 1989 Rexrodt worked for Citibank in New York City and from January 1990 to August 1991 he was a member of the board of directors at Citibank&#x27;s Germany business, based in Frankfurt. 

Already in September 1991, Rexrodt moved to the Treuhand in Germany, where he was a member of the board of directors until January 1993. Reportedly, Chancellor Kohl personally phoned John S. Reed, chairman of Citibank in New York, to ask that Rexrodt be let out of his contract to assume a seat on the board of the Treuhandanstalt. During his time at the Treuhandanstalt, he was in charge of privatizing Eastern Germany&#x27;s textiles and agricultural sectors. He also disposed of the property of the former Socialist Unity Party of Germany, including publishers and real estate interests.

==Return to politics==
===Career in national politics===
From 1991 Rexrodt was a member of the FDP national leadership under the party&#x27;s chair Otto Graf Lambsdorff. That same year, he was Lambsdorff&#x27;s nominee to succeed Helmut Haussmann as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs; however, he eventually lost an internal vote against Jürgen Möllemann.

From the 1994 elections, Rexrodt was a member of the German Bundestag. He was returned to the Bundestag from the Berlin list.

===Minister for Economic Affairs, 1993–1998===
On January 21, 1993, Rexrodt was appointed as Federal Minister for Economic Affairs by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, after the resignation of his predecessor Jürgen Möllemann. The appointment was made following a nomination submitted by the FDP; the Free Democratic members of Parliament and the entire national leadership picked him by secret ballot, with 57 out of 97 votes cast.

During his time in office, Rexrodt was considered far less influential in formulating economic policy than Minister of Finance Theo Waigel. In 1995, he was rumoured to be replaced amid a cabinet reshuffle but ended up keeping his position due to internal infighting within the FDP.

Under Rexrodt&#x27;s leadership, the government liberalized Germany&#x27;s highly regulated shop hours in 1996, permitting stores to remain open later, until 8 P.M. on weekdays and part of Saturday afternoons. 

Also in 1996, Rexrodt resisted U.S. diplomatic efforts to enlist Germany&#x27;s help in pursuing democratic reform in Cuba, arguing that the Helms–Burton Act&#x27;s threat of extraterritorial sanctions against non-U.S. firms were the wrong way to promote democratization.

In 1997, Rexrodt – jointly with the European Commission – convened government ministers from about 30 European nations and business leaders for the Bonn Conference on Global Information Networks to define a common strategy for fostering electronic commerce in Europe.

After the 1998 national elections, Rexrodt joined the Budget Committee and became his parliamentary group&#x27;s spokesperson on the annual budget. 

===Return to state politics===
From 2000 to 2004, Rexrodt served as chairman of the FDP in Berlin. In Berlin&#x27;s 2001 state elections, he was the lead candidate of the FDP. Under his leadership, the FDP returned to the State Parliament with a final voting result of 9.9%. When negotiations over a coalition government with the Social Democrats and Alliance 90/The Greens failed, he resigned his seat in the State Parliament after only two months in early 2002.

From 2001, Rexrodt served as the federal treasurer of the FDP under the leadership of chairman Guido Westerwelle. In this capacity, he was later involved in the investigation of the &quot;flyer affair&quot; surrounding Möllemann.

In 2003, Rexrodt announced his intention to resign as chair of the FDP in Berlin the following year. In 2004, he failed to win sufficient support for his plan to lead his party&#x27;s Berlin campaign for the national elections again. 

==Other activities==
===Corporate boards===
* WMP EuroCom, Member of the Board (from 2000) 
* Gerling Group, Member of the Advisory Board
* Skandia, Member of the Board of Directors
* AWD, Member of the Supervisory Board
===Non-profit organizations===
* Ghorfa Arab-German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, President
* Global Panel Foundation, Member of the Supervisory Board

==Personal life==
Rexrodt&#x27;s father Wilhelm was managing director of the German Democratic Party until 1933. Wilhelm was after 1945 the co-founder of the Liberal Democratic Party of Germany.

Rexrodt was married to Ingrid Hoyermann and had a son from that marriage. 

During an official trip to South Africa and Zimbabwe in 1996, Rexrodt was infected with malaria and spent three weeks in a coma. In May 2004 he had to undergo a complicated surgery for cancer on the neck and died shortly after from cardiac arrest.

<text>Willie Wilbert Herenton (born April 23, 1940) is an American politician from Memphis, Tennessee. He was elected as the first elected African-American Mayor of Memphis, Tennessee. He was elected to five consecutive terms and abruptly resigned the position mid-way through his fifth term in 2009.

==Early life and education==
Willie Wilbert Herenton was born to Ruby Lee Harris in Memphis, Tennessee. Raised by a single mother, Herenton was encouraged at a young age to pursue his dreams of becoming a Golden Gloves boxer. Herenton graduated from Le Moyne-Owen College with a bachelors of science in Elementary Education and from the University of Memphis (formerly Memphis State University) with a masters in Educational Administration. However, segregation forced Herenton to leave Memphis to attain his doctorate in education at Southern Illinois University.

== Memphis City Schools ==
After graduating from Le Moyne-Owen, Herenton began working at Memphis City Schools as a fifth-grade teacher in Memphis. During the 1968 Memphis Sanitation Strike, Herenton marched in solidarity with the sanitation workers; however, the choice to march with Martin Luther King, Jr. and wear the sign declaring &quot;I AM A MAN&quot; resulted in threats of termination and ostracism from school district leadership and fellow teachers. But in 1969 Herenton was appointed principal of Bethel Grove Elementary and at 28 became the youngest principal ever hired in Memphis. Three years later, he completed his Ph.D. degree at Southern Illinois University. A year after returning from the Rockefeller Foundation Superintendent Training Program, Herenton became the Deputy Superintendent of Memphis City Schools. In 1979, Herenton became the first African-American superintendent of Memphis City Schools. During Herenton&#x27;s 12-year tenure as MCS superintendent, ambitious programs aimed at creating opportunities and services to disadvantaged youth, as well as expanding teacher freedoms, were implemented. However, he was mired in controversy after accusations of sexual harassment from a female teacher surfaced in 1988, leading to his divorce, an admission of an affair, and an out-of-court settlement. Further criticism of his performance as superintendent, as well as an impending mayoral campaign, led him to resign in 1991.

== Mayor of Memphis==

===Elections===
In April 1991, more than 3000 predominantly African-American citizens of Memphis gathered in the Mid-South Coliseum and selected Herenton as the consensus candidate for the 1991 mayoral election. On October 3, Herenton became the first African-American to be elected mayor of Memphis (J.O. Patterson, Jr. served as interim mayor in 1982). Herenton won his first term by defeating incumbent mayor Richard Hackett in 1991 by 146 votes.

Herenton went on to win five consecutive mayoral elections. He was elected to his fifth term in office on October 4, 2007.

===Tenure===
During his tenure, some critics referred to him as &quot;King Willie&quot;, after he was televised saying he didn&#x27;t care whether Memphians voted for him or not. Another scandal ensued when he started a second chance program for first time offenders, allegedly connected to his relationship to a female felon.

Herenton was praised for putting the city on solid financial footing and presiding over the redevelopment of downtown Memphis, an influx of private capital investment, and the arrival of two professional sports teams: the Memphis Grizzlies and Memphis Redbirds.

Herenton was long-listed for the 2008 World Mayor award; however, he was not selected for this honor.

On March 20, 2008, Herenton announced that he would be stepping down from his position as Memphis&#x27; mayor, effective July 31, 2008. This move angered many politicians in the city, including Councilwoman Carol Chumney, who had run for mayor of Memphis in the October 2007 election. He made this announcement just over 90 days after his fifth re-election. Herenton stated that he was departing office in order to seek the position of superintendent of Memphis City Schools, amidst speculation that he was stepping down in advance of a run for Congress or because of impending legal troubles from an ongoing criminal investigation at City Hall. He later stated that he would not leave the office of mayor unless he got the position as the superintendent of schools. Herenton said that he only ran for re-election in 2007 to protect the city of Memphis from the other main candidates, Herman Morris and Councilwoman Carol Chumney. When the stated day came, Herenton failed to step down as Mayor and said he would serve out his term until 2011.

In April 2009, Herenton formed an exploratory committee to run in the 2010 US Congressional Election for the 9th District of Tennessee, presumably intending to challenge incumbent Steve Cohen in the Democratic primary. On June 25, 2009, Herenton announced his resignation as Mayor, effective July 10. On July 6, he announced that he would delay his retirement until July 30.

He resigned from office on July 30, 2009. Memphis City Council Chairman Myron Lowery was appointed as mayor pro tempore. Lowery served for three months before losing to A.C. Wharton in a special election to serve out the remainder of Herenton’s term.

==2010 congressional campaign==
In 2010, Herenton announced that he would run against Congressman Steve Cohen in the Democratic Primary for Tennessee&#x27;s 9th congressional district—a majority African-American and heavily Democratic-leaning district.

In September 2009, Herenton attracted controversy with his statement in a radio interview that Congressman Steve Cohen &quot;really does not think very much of African-Americans&quot; and that &quot;[Cohen]&#x27;s played the black community well.&quot; Herenton&#x27;s campaign manager, Sidney Chism, who is African American, told the &quot;New York Times&quot; that the Memphis-area congressional seat held by Cohen, who is Jewish, &quot;was set aside for people who look like me. It wasn&#x27;t set aside for a Jew or a Christian. It was set aside so that blacks could have representation.&quot; The National Jewish Democratic Council (NJDC) criticized Herenton for these remarks, stating that his comments were &quot;unacceptable in a Democratic primary or anywhere in our political discourse.&quot;

Despite Herenton&#x27;s attempts to isolate Cohen from the African-American voters, Cohen received endorsements from both President Barack Obama and the Congressional Black Caucus. Cohen won the Democratic primary election, with Herenton taking 20% of the vote.

== 2019 and 2023 Mayoral Campaigns ==
On April 5, 2018, Herenton announced his intention to run for mayor of Memphis for a 6th term, challenging the incumbent Jim Strickland in the 2019 Memphis mayoral election. Strickland won the election, and Herenton conceded to Strickland on the night of the election.

On February 6, 2023, Herenton joined the race to succeed Strickland. Herenton placed third with 22% of the vote, behind Shelby County Sheriff Floyd Bonner and CEO of the Downtown Memphis Commission, Paul Young, who was elected mayor.

==Personal life==
Herenton has four children; he and his first wife are divorced. His grandson Willie played college basketball at Miami (Florida).

<doc id="912751" wikidata="Q580107" url="?curid=912751" title="Bajiquan">
<text>Bajiquan () is a traditional Chinese martial art that features explosive, short-range power in close combat and is well-known for its rapid elbow and shoulder strikes. Its full name is kaimen bajiquan ().

The &quot;eight extremities&quot; in Bajiquan refers to the eight distalmost parts of the body to strike the opponent. This includes the fist, forearm, elbow, shoulder, hip, thigh, knee, and foot to deliver a powerful blow in close range. Bajiquan is also known as the &quot;bodyguard style&quot;, as this was the pugilism style taught and used by personal bodyguards for Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-shek, and Puyi (the last Qing dynasty emperor).

&quot;Bajiquan&quot; is now popular in northern China and Taiwan. Later, it was introduced to Japan, South Korea, and other countries; such as the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, among others.

==Etymology== 
According to most common etymology, &quot;bajiquan&quot; was originally called &quot;baziquan&quot; () because the fists, held loosely and slightly open, are used to strike downwards in a rake-like fashion. The name was considered to be rather crude, so it was changed to &quot;bajiquan&quot;. The term &quot;baji&quot; comes from the &quot;I Ching&quot; and signifies an &quot;extension of all directions&quot;. In this case, it means &quot;including everything&quot; or &quot;the universe&quot;.

However, this etymology is not universally accepted.

== History ==
Little is known about the origin of the style. Information before the Republican era of China is extremely rare, with clearest documentation beginning circa 1920s-1930s.

The first practitioner clearly identified in written history was a man named Wu Zhong (; 1712–1802), a member of the Hui minority and from the Wu family clan of the Mengcun region of Cangzhou, Hebei.

According to the genealogical records of the Wu family, Wu Zhong&#x27;s great-grandfather left the family stronghold to settle about 50 km away in the isolated hamlet of Houzhuangke (后庄科) in the neighboring province of Shandong. Wu Zhong is said to have been born in Houzhuangke before returning to settle with the main branch of his family in the village of Mengcun, Hebei province. Little is known of Wu Zhong, except that he quickly reached an unparalleled level in the practice of martial arts. His prowess earned him the nickname &quot;god of the spear&quot;, as well as being recruited to serve as an instructor at the imperial court under Prince Xun. When he was about 60 years old, Wu Zhong returned to Mengcun where he devoted the last thirty years of his life to transmitting his fighting art, and the village became the source of the development of &quot;bajiquan&quot;.

The origin of the mastery acquired by Wu Zhong remains unknown to this day, it is currently the subject of many controversies between the different branches of &quot;bajiquan&quot;. Historical documents contain two versions of the origins of &quot;bajiquan&quot;:
* The Cang County annals, the &quot;baji&quot; manual of the Wu family, and the Pobei manuscript indicate that an itinerant Taoist monk by the name of Lai () and his disciple Pi () would have stayed in Mengcun to teach &quot;bajiquan&quot; as well as the handling of the great spear to Wu Zhong. By the admission of the Wu family of Mengcun, this reference is probably to be considered as a legend.; 
* The other is Zhang Yueshan, a monk from Yueshan Temple in Henan Province (either Zhengzhou or Jiaozuo), who was returning to secular life and traveling around. It is said that he taught the great spear method.
* Besides those two theories, there is also speculation that the martial art originates from Shaolin Temple in Henan, unrelated to Zhang Yueshan.

In any case, all sources agree on the fact that Wu Zhong traveled a lot, and that it was only at the end of his life that he devoted himself to teaching &quot;bajiquan&quot;. It is presumed that the legend of Lai and Pi simply symbolizes the martial knowledge that Wu Zhong was able to acquire throughout his life, probably from the study of the other styles of the region, and that he crystallized it in the form of &quot;bajiquan&quot;.

The first historical reference to &quot;bajiquan&quot; appears in military treaty called Jixiao Xinshu written by general Qi Jiguang (1528–1588). It is inferred that &quot;bajiquan&quot; may have been a well-established martial art during the 16th Century.

Wu Zhong had only one child, his daughter Wu Rong (), who at the age of 30 married an expert in Changquan and stopped practicing &quot;bajiquan&quot; after a few years. To avoid remaining childless and ensure the continuity of his art, Wu Zhong adopted Wu Ying (), a distant nephew of the Wu family of Mengcun. Wu Zhong transmitted all his knowledge to Wu Ying, as well as to Wu Zhongyu (), another distant nephew of the Wu family of Mengcun. In 1790, at the request of his master, Wu Ying officially introduced the name &quot;bajiquan&quot; and he wrote the first martial manual of the Wu family to ensure the transmission of the family art among generations to come. Thus, &quot;bajiquan&quot; was transmitted within the Wu family who also ensured the dissemination of the style to other families in Mengcun and the surrounding villages.

At first, &quot;bajiquan&quot; was transmitted mainly to the Hui people of Meng Village, but it was also transmitted to Luohan, an area where many Han people live. Eventually, it came to be divided into the Hui lineage of Mencun and the Han lineage of Luo.

===Contemporary history of &quot;bajiquan&quot;===
Li Shuwen (1860–1934) was considered one of the most important movers of the martial art during Qing dynasty. He was from Cangzhou (), Hebei, and acquired the nickname &quot;God of Spear Li&quot;. A Beijing opera &quot;Wu Shen&quot; (martial male character) by training, he was also an expert fighter. His most famous quote is, &quot;I do not know what it&#x27;s like to hit a man twice.&quot; Li Shuwen&#x27;s students included Huo Dian Ge () (bodyguard to Puyi, the last Emperor of China), Li Chenwu (bodyguard to Mao Zedong), and Liu Yunqiao () (secret agent for the nationalist Kuomintang and instructor of the Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s bodyguards). &quot;Bajiquan&quot; has since acquired a reputation as the &quot;bodyguard style&quot;. Ma Fengtu () and Ma Yintu () introduced &quot;bajiquan&quot; into the Central Guoshu Institute (Nanjing Guoshu Guan ) where it is required for all students.

The impetus that set the spread of &quot;bajiquan&quot; throughout China was that of the Central Guoshu Institute, as a regular course common to the two training courses &quot;Shaolin Gate&quot; and &quot;Wudang Gate&quot;. It all started with the establishment of &quot;&quot;bajiquan&quot; teaching materials for group training&quot; (団体訓練用八極拳教材). As the branch of Central Guoshu Institute expanded, &quot;bajiquan&quot; became more popular and popularized.

===Relation to &quot;piguaquan&quot;===
In the tradition of Ma brothers, &quot;bajiquan&quot; is believed to share roots with another Hebei martial art, &quot;piguaquan&quot;. It is said that Wu Zhong, the oldest traceable master in the &quot;bajiquan&quot; lineage, taught both arts together as an integrated fighting system. The legend has it that they eventually split apart, only to be recombined by Li Shuwen in the late 18th to early 19th century. As a testament to the complementary nature of these two styles, a proverb states: &quot;When &quot;pigua&quot; is added to &quot;baji&quot;, gods and demons will all be terrified. When &quot;baji&quot; is added to &quot;pigua&quot;, heroes will sigh knowing they are no match against it.&quot; ()

No historical proofs supporting this version, however, were found.

== Branches and lineages ==
Prominent branches and lineages of the art survived to modern times, including Han-style, Huo-style, Ji-style, Li-style, Ma-style, Qiang-style, Wu-style (from Wu Xiefeng), Wutan-style, and yin yang-style &quot;bajiquan&quot;. Each has a unique element while sharing core practices. Some lineages are more common or only exist in China, while others have spread to Western countries.

=== Mengcun &quot;bajiquan&quot; ===
Meng Village (Mengcun) is said to be the original birthplace of &quot;bajiquan&quot;, or at least the modern versions of the art. &quot;Baji&quot; is still widely practiced there.

=== Nanjing &quot;bajiquan&quot; ===
&quot;Bajiquan&quot; of Nanjing was introduced to the Guoshu Institute by students of Zhang Jingxing, Han Huiqing, and Ma Yingtu. Han had a great influence on the spread of &quot;baji&quot; in southern China, to the point that there was a saying &quot;bei li nan han&quot; meaning &quot;Li [Shuwen] in the north and Han [Huachen] in the south&quot;.

=== Wu Xiufeng ===
Wu Xiufeng (1908–1976) is the &quot;grandfather&quot; of many modern &quot;baji&quot; lineages. The following lineages descend from him.

==== Tian-style ====
Tian-style is a branch which has mutual influences from Jingang Bashi—the second art practiced by Tian Jinzhong. Practitioners include Wu Xiufeng, Tian Jinzhong, and Shen Jiarui » Zhou Jingxuan Tian-style is practiced in China and abroad.

==== Yin Yang-style====
Yin Yang-style was created by Zhao Fujiang, who combined his knowledge of &quot;baji&quot;, &quot;xingyiquan&quot; and &quot;yiquan&quot; to create a new art form. Yin-Yang is primarily practiced in China.

=== Wutan-style &quot;baji&quot; ===
Wutan-style &quot;baji&quot; is the most common lineage in the West today. Originally from Taiwan, where its founder, Liu Yunqiao, lived. This lineage includes additional arts that are taught alongside &quot;baji&quot;, such as &quot;piguaquan&quot; and &quot;baguazhang&quot;.

Jian Diansheng » Li Shuwen » Liu Yunqiao » Adam Hsu, Su Yuchang, and Tony Yang » Many students in Taiwan and abroad (taught by one or more of them).

== Features ==

=== Tactics and strategy ===
&quot;Bajiquan&quot; opens the opponent&#x27;s arms forcibly (&quot;qiang kai men&quot;; ) and mount attacks at high, mid, and low levels of the body (&quot;san pan lian ji&quot;; ). It is most useful in close combat, as it focuses on elbow, knee, shoulder and hip strikes. When blocking an attack or nearing an opponent, &quot;bajiquan&quot; techniques emphasize striking major points of vulnerability, namely the thorax (trunk of the body), legs and neck.
The &quot;six big ways of opening&quot; (&quot;liu da kai&quot;; ) are:

* &quot;Ding&quot; (): using the fist, elbow or shoulder to push forward and upward.
* &quot;Bao&quot; (): putting arms together as if hugging someone. It is usually followed by &quot;pi&quot; (splitting).
* &quot;Ti&quot; (): elevating the knee to hit the thigh of the opponent, or elevating the foot to hit the shin of the opponent, etc.
* &quot;Dan&quot; (): using a single move.
* &quot;Kua&quot; (): using the hip.
* &quot;Chan&quot; (): entanglement with rotation around the wrist, elbow and shoulder.

=== Stepping and body methods ===
Footwork in &quot;bajiquan&quot; has three special features:
* &quot;Zhenjiao&quot;
* &quot;Nianbu&quot;
* &quot;Chuangbu&quot;

These striking techniques are related to traditional Chinese medicine, which states that all parts of the body are connected, either physically or spiritually.

=== Forms ===
The forms of &quot;baji&quot; are divided into armed and unarmed routines. There are twenty fist forms, which include twelve &quot;baji&quot; Small Structure Fists, &quot;baji&quot; Black Tiger Fist, &quot;baji danzhai&quot;, &quot;baji danda&quot;/&quot;duida&quot;, &quot;baji luohan gong&quot;, and &quot;baji si lang kuan&quot;. There are eight weapons forms, including &quot;liuheda qiang&quot; (spear), &quot;chun yang jian&quot; (sword), &quot;san yin dao&quot; (sabre), &quot;xing zhe bang&quot; (staff), &quot;pudao&quot;, and &quot;chun qiu dadao&quot; (a long two-handed heavy blade, used by Generals sitting on their horses).

Most schools focus on a much smaller curriculum. Standard across almost all groups are &quot;xiaobaji&quot; and &quot;dabaji&quot;; two weapons forms, the sabre and the spear; a two-man training routine called &quot;baji duijie&quot; or &quot;baji duida&quot; and a series of 8 short attacking methods called the &quot;bashi&quot; (Eight Postures), which are derived from the art of Shaolin &quot;jingang bashi&quot;.

=== Power generation and expression ===
The major features of &quot;baji&quot; include elbow strikes, arm/fist punches, hip checks and strikes with the shoulder. All techniques are executed with a short power, developed through training; among Chinese martial artists, &quot;baji&quot; is known for its fast movements. &quot;Baji&quot; focuses on infighting, entering from a longer range with a distinctive charging step (&quot;zhenjiao&quot;).

The essence of &quot;bajiquan&quot; lies in &quot;jin&quot;, or power-issuing methods, particularly &quot;fa jin&quot; (explosive power). The style contains six types of &quot;jin&quot;, eight different ways to hit and several principles of power usage. Most of &quot;bajiquan&quot;&#x27;s moves utilize a one-hit push-strike method from very close range. The bulk of the damage is dealt through the momentary acceleration that travels up from the waist to the limb and further magnified by the charging step known as &quot;zhenjiao&quot;.

The mechanics of &quot;jin&quot; are developed through many years of practice and &quot;bajiquan&quot; is known for its strenuous lower-body training and its emphasis on the horse stance. Its horse stance is higher than that of typical &quot;changquan&quot; styles. Like other styles, there is also &quot;the arrow-bow stance&quot;, &quot;the one-leg stance&quot;, &quot;the empty stance&quot; (), &quot;the drop stance&quot; (), etc. There are eight different hand poses, in addition to different types of breathing and &quot;zhenjiao&quot;.

== Influences ==
&quot;Baji&quot; focuses on being more direct, culminating in powerful, fast strikes that will render an opponent unable to continue. Even so, there are some styles that are derived from &quot;baji&quot;&#x27;s main principles or concepts on how to hit the opponent:
* Eight postures (&quot;Bashi&quot;)
* Eight movements method (&quot;Bashi gong&quot;)
* Eight movements method (&quot;Bashi chui&quot;)
* Double Eight Postures (&quot;Shuang bashi&quot;)
* Eight postures of the dragon style (&quot;Longxing bashi&quot;)

Many of these forms are also based or mixed with &quot;luohanquan&quot;, a Shaolin style. The term &quot;bashi&quot; may also refer to &quot;baji&quot;. The term is also used in &quot;xingyiquan&quot;.

===Japan===
&quot;Bajiquan&quot; has hugely impacted the Japanese pop culture. In Japanese, it is known as &quot;hakkyokuken&quot;, a Japanese reading of the Chinese characters used to write &quot;bajiquan&quot;. &quot;Bajiquan&quot;&#x27;s impact would begin with Kenji (manga), a manga series written by Ryuchi Matsuda and illustrated by Yoshihide Fujiwara. It follows a teenage practitioner of &quot;Bajiquan&quot; and is supposedly based on Ryuichi Matsuda&#x27;s own journey in Chinese martial arts.

In 1993, Yu Suzuki - who got interested in martial arts because of the manga, Kenji - would direct Virtua Fighter, a groundbreaking 3D fighting game. The game was hugely successful in Japan and amongst the roster was a &quot;bajiquan&quot; practitioner Akira Yuki, solidifying &quot;bajiquan&quot;&#x27;s stay in Japanese pop-culture. &quot;Bajiquan&quot; is also central to Yu Suzuki&#x27;s Shenmue, a &quot;sister&quot; game to Virtua Fighter series.

&quot;Bajiquan&quot; is featured in many manga/anime series, including &quot;Air Master&quot;, &quot;Gantz&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Fist of the Blue Sky&quot;, &quot;Undead Unluck&quot;, &quot;Love Hina&quot;, &quot;Negima! Magister Negi Magi&quot;, &quot;Beelzebub&quot; and &quot;Garōden&quot; 

In Japanese video games, it is featured in:
* &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; series by Sega, used by Akira Yuki
* &quot;Tekken&quot; by Namco, mainly used by Leo Kliesen and secondarily by Michelle Chang and Julia Chang
* &quot;Street Fighter&quot; by Capcom, twins Yun and Yang as well as by Karin Kanzuki
* &quot;Rival Schools&quot; also by Capcom, used by Akira Kazama who also guest stars in Street Fighter V as a DLC character

<doc id="912759" wikidata="Q277647" url="?curid=912759" title="Luhya people">
<text>The Luhya (also known as &quot;Abaluyia&quot; or Luyia) are a Bantu people and the second largest ethnic group in Kenya. The Luhya belong to the larger linguistic stock known as the Bantu. The Luhya are located in western Kenya and Uganda. They are divided into 20 (or 21, when the Suba are included) culturally and linguistically united clans. Once known as the Kavirondo, multiple small tribes in North Nyanza came together under the new name Baluhya between 1950 and 1960. The Bukusu are the largest Luhya subtribe and account for almost 30% of the entire Luhya population.

The Luhya culture is similar to the Great Lakes region Bantu speakers. During a wave of expansion that began 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, Bantu-speaking populations – as of 2023, some 310 million people – gradually left their original homeland of West-Central Africa and traveled to the eastern and southern regions of the continent. Using data from a vast genomic analysis of more than 2,000 samples taken from individuals in 57 populations throughout Sub-Saharan Africa, scientists from the Institut Pasteur and the CNRS, together with a broad international consortium, have retraced the migratory routes of these populations, previously a source of debate.

&quot;Luhya&quot; today refers to both the 20 Luhya clans and their respective Luhya dialects. There are 20 clans that make up the Luhya. The Luhya belong to the larger linguistic stock known as the Bantu. The Luhya comprise several subgroups with different but mutually understood linguistic dialects. The word “Luhya&quot; or “Luyia&quot; in some of the dialects means &quot;the north.” There is no single Luhya language. Rather, there are several mutually understood dialects that are principally Bantu. Perhaps the most identifying linguistic feature of the various Luhya dialects is the use of the prefix aba- or ava-, meaning &quot;of&quot; or &quot;belonging to.&quot; Thus, for example, &quot;Abaluhya (Abaluyia)&quot; means &quot;people from the north.&quot; Other translations are &quot;those of the same hearth.”

The 21 clans are the Bukusu (&quot;Aba-Bukusu&quot;), Idakho (&quot;Av-Idakho&quot;), Isukha (&quot;Av-Isukha&quot;), Kabras (&quot;Aba-Kabras&quot;), Khayo (&quot;Aba-Khayo&quot;), Kisa (&quot;Aba-Kisa&quot;), Marachi (&quot;Aba-Marachi&quot;), Maragoli (&quot;Aba-Logoli&quot;), Marama (&quot;Aba-Marama&quot;), Nyala (&quot;Aba-Nyala&quot;), Nyole (&quot;Aba-Nyole&quot;), Samia (&quot;Aba-Samia&quot;), Tiriki (&quot;Aba-Tiriki&quot;), Tsotso (&quot;Abatsotso&quot;), Wanga (&quot;Aba-Wanga&quot;), and Batura (&quot;Abatura&quot;) and the Abasiaya. They are closely related to the Masaba (or Gisu), Basamia and Banyole of Uganda, whose language is mutually intelligible with Luhya.

The principal traditional settlement area of the Luhya is in what was formerly the Western province. A substantial number of them permanently settled in the Kitale and Kapsabet areas of the former Rift Valley province. The Luhya people make their home mainly in the western part of Kenya. Administratively, they occupy mostly Western province, and the west-central part of Rift Valley province. Luhya migration into the Rift Valley is relatively recent, only dating back to the first few years after independence in 1963, when farms formerly occupied by colonial white settlers were bought by, or given to Africans. Western Kenya is one of the most densely populated parts of Kenya. Migration to their present Luhyaland (a term of endearment referring to the Luhya&#x27;s primary place of settlement in Kenya after the Bantu expansion) dates back to as early as the 7 BC.

Immigrants into present-day Luhyaland came mainly from eastern and western Uganda and trace their ancestry mainly to several Bantu groups, and to other non-Bantu groups such as the Kalenjin, Luo, and Maasai. By 1850, migration into Luhyaland was largely complete, and only minor internal movements occurred after that due to diseases, droughts, domestic conflicts and effects of British colonialism.

Multiple West African populations, including the Luhya, inherited genes from an archaic human ancestor population that diverged before modern humans and Neanderthals, split. Researchers found that a lineage splitting 624,000 years ago and introgressing into the African population 50,000 years ago is able to explain the genes present in the modern Luhya population.

===Overview===
Anthropologists, geneticists, and linguists have evidenced that the progenitors of the Luhya were part of the great Bantu expansion out of Central Africa. During a wave of expansion that began 4,000 to 5,000 years ago, Bantu-speaking populations – as of 2023, some 310 million people – gradually left their original homeland of West-Central Africa and traveled to the eastern and southern regions of the continent. However, the majority of the other Luhya tribe are mostly from present-day Uganda.

===Pre-colonial period===

Early migration was probably motivated by a search for more and better land, and to escape local conflicts, tsetse flies, and mosquitoes. By about 1850, migration into Luhyaland was largely complete, and only minor internal movements took place after that due to food shortages, disease, and violent domestic conflicts. Luhya migration into the Rift Valley is relatively recent, only dating back to the first few years after independence in 1963, when farms formerly occupied by colonial white settlers were bought by, or given to Africans. 

One of the oldest maps of Western Kenya indicate Luyialand as Usaba region, meaning: area occupied by masaba speaking people, this name is still used by Gisu of Uganda. The name Masaba, means North in Luluyia language. This territory neighboured the Baganda, Basoga and Bagisu of present-day Uganda, and the Luo, Teso, and Nandi of present-day Kenya. The territory occupied by the Bantu around Lake Victoria and to the north of Lake Victoria was known as Kavirondo &quot;Bantu Kavirondo&quot; previously used to refer to the Luhya and other Bantu communities in the area.

The British explorer Henry Morton Stanley made a voyage around Lake Victoria, and Joseph Thomson, the Scottish geologist, passed through Luhya territory around 1883. Thomson met Nabongo Mumia and influenced British relations with the Wanga Kingdom in the region. 

As all the land in Kenya, west of Naivasha was mapped within the Uganda Protectorate, the Luhya people and other Kenyan communities were included in the Ugandan territory. In 1902, the boundaries were remapped and the Luhya peoples including the Wanga kingdom and their neighbouring communities which were on the eastern part of Uganda, were annexed to Kenya.

===Colonial period===
The first European the Luhya had contact with was probably Henry Morton Stanley as he voyaged around Lake Victoria. In 1883, Joseph Thomson was the first European known to pass through Luhya territory on foot, and was influential in opening the region to Europeans after his meeting with King Nabongo Mumia of the Wanga Kingdom.

Significant numbers of the Luhya fought for the British in the Second World War, many as volunteers in the Kenya African Rifles (KAR). As with many African societies, the Luhya also named their children after significant events. Consequently, many Luhya people born around the time of the Second World War were named &quot;Keyah&quot;, a transliteration of &quot;KAR&quot;, the acronym for the King&#x27;s African Rifles. 

Other famous chiefs during the colonial time included Ndombi wa Namusia, Sudi Namachanja, Namutala and Ongoma Laurende. 

==Luhya Clans and Subclans==

1. The Bukusu speak Lubukusu and occupy Bungoma, Mount Elgon district and Trans Nzoia. The sub-clans of the Bukusu include the Bamutilu, Babuya, Batura, Bamalaba, Bamwale, Bakikayi, Basirikwa, Baechale, Baechalo, Bakibeti, Bakhisa, Bamwayi Bamwaya, Bang&#x27;oma, Basakali, Bakiabi, Baliuli, Bamuki, Bakhona, Bakoi, Bameme, Basombi, Bakwangwa, Babutu (descendants of Mubutu also found in Congo), Bakhoone, Baengele (originally Banyala), Balonja, Batukwika, Baboya, Baala, Balako, Basaba, Babuya, Barefu, Bamusomi, Batecho, Baafu, Babichachi, Bamula, Balunda, Babulo, Bafumo, Bayemba, Baemba, Bayaya, Baleyi, Baembo, Bamukongi, Babeti, Baunga, Bakuta, Balisa, Balukulu, Balwonja, Bamalicha, Bamukoya, Bamuna, Bamutiru, Bayonga, Bamang&#x27;ali, Basefu, Basekese, Basenya, Basime, Basimisi, Basibanjo, Basonge, Batakhwe, Batecho, Bachemayi, Bachemwile, Bauma, Baumbu, Bakhoma, Bakhonjo, Bakhwami, Bakhulaluwa, Baundo, Bayundo, Bachemuluku, Bafisi, Bakobolo, Bamatiri, Bamakhuli, Bameywa, Bahongo, Basamo, Basang&#x27;alo, Basianaga, Basioya, Bachambayi, Bangachi, Babiya, Baande, Bakhone, Bakimwei, Batilu, Bakhurarwa, Bakamukong&#x27;i, Baluleti, Babasaba, Bakikai, Bhakitang&#x27;a, Bhatemlani, Bhasakha, Bhatasama, Bhakiyabi, Banywaka, Banyangali, Baumba etc.

3. The Khayo speak Lukhayo and occupy Nambale District and Matayos Division of Busia County, Kenya. Khayo sub-clans include the Abaguuri, Abasota, Abakhabi.

4. The Marachi speak Lumarachi and occupy Butula District in Busia county. Marachi sub-clans include Ababere, Abafofoyo, Abamuchama, Abatula, Abamurono, Abang&#x27;ayo, Ababule, Abamulembo, Abatelia, Abapwati, Abasumia, Abarano, Abasimalwa, Abakwera, Abamutu, Abamalele, Abakolwe, Ababonwe, Abamucheka, Abaliba, Ababirang&#x27;u, Abakolwe, Abade. Abasubo. The name Marachi is derived from Ng&#x27;ono Mwami&#x27;s father who was called Marachi son of Musebe, the son of Sirikwa. So all the Marachi sub-clans owed their allegiance to Ng&#x27;ono Mwami from whose lineage of Ababere sub-clan they were founded. The name Marachi was given further impetus by the war-like lifestyle of the descendants of Ng&#x27;ono who ruthlessly fought off the Luo expansion of the Jok Omollo a Nilotic group that sought to control the Nzoia and Sio Rivers in the area and the fishing grounds around the gulf of Erukala and Ebusijo-modern Port Victoria and Sio Port respectively.

5. The Nyala speak Lunyala and occupy Busia District. Other Nyala (Abanyala ba Kakamega) occupy the northwestern part of Kakamega District. The Banyala of Kakamega are said to have migrated from Busia with a leader known as Mukhamba. They speak the same dialect as the Banyala of Busia, save for minor differences in pronunciation. The Abanyala ba Kakamega are also known as Abanyala ba Ndombi.
They reside in Navakholo Division North of Kakamega forest. Their one-time powerful colonial chief was Ndombi wa Namusia. Chief Ndombi was succeeded by his son, Andrea.

Andrea was succeeded by Paulo Udoto, Mukopi, Wanjala, Barasa Ongeti, Matayo Oyalo and Muterwa in that order.

The sub-clans of the Banyala include Abahafu, Ababenge, Abachimba, Abadavani, Abaengere, Abakangala, Abakhubichi, Abakoye, Abakwangwachi, Abalanda, Abalecha, Abalindo, Abamani, Abalindavyoki, Abamisoho, Abamuchuu, Abamugi, Abamulembo, Abasinyama, Abamwaya, Abanyekera, Abaokho, Abasaacha, Abasakwa, Abasaya, Abasenya, Abasia, Abasiloli, Abasonge (also found among Kabras), Abasumba, Abasuu, Abatecho (also found among Bukusu), Abaucha, Abauma, Abaumwo, Abacharia, Abayaya, Abayirifuma (also found among Tachoni), Abayisa, Abayundo and Abasiondo, Abachende.

The Banyala do not intermarry with someone from the same sub-clan.

6. The Kabras speak Lukabarasi and occupy the northern part of Kakamega district. The Kabras were originally Banyala. They reside principally in Malava, in Kabras Division of Kakamega district. The Kabras (or Kabarasi, Kavalasi and Kabalasi) are sandwiched by the Isukha, Banyala and the Tachoni.

The name &quot;Kabras&quot; comes from &quot;Avalasi&quot; which means &#x27;Warriors&#x27; or &#x27;Mighty Hunters.&#x27; They were fierce warriors who fought with the neighbouring Nandi for cattle and were known to be fearless. This explains why they are generally fewer in number compared to other Luhya clans such as the Maragoli and Bukusu.

The Kabras dialect sounds like the Tachoni dialect. Kabras sub-clans include the Abasira, Abamutama, Basonje, Abakhusia, Bamachina, Abashu, Abamutsembi, Baluu, Batobo, Bachetsi and Bamakangala. They were named after the heads of the families. 

The Kabras were under the rulership of Nabongo Mumia of the Wanga and were represented by an elder in his Council of Elders. The last known elder was Soita Libukana Samaramarami of Lwichi village, Central Kabras, near Chegulo market. When the Quaker missionaries spread to Kabras they established the Friends Church (Quakers) through a missionary by the name of Arthur Chilson, who had started the church in Kaimosi, in Tiriki. He earned a local name, Shikanga, and his children learned to speak Kabras as they lived and interacted with the local children.

Although Trans Nzoia is in the Rift Valley province, substantial Luhya populations have settled in the Kitale area.

==Population and politics==

In Kenyan politics, the Luhya population, commonly referred to as the &quot;Luhya vote&quot; in an election year, was usually a deciding factor in the outcome of an election. The community was known to unite and vote as a block usually for a specific political candidate without division of mind and regardless of political differences. However, since the March 2013 general elections, this was proved wrong. They are now known to accept different ideologies. Politicians scramble for the Luhya vote since it is the most democratic voter in Kenya. Given their high population numbers, a political candidate who enjoys Luhya support is almost always poised to win the country&#x27;s general elections, barring incidents of fraud. The community is thereafter &quot;rewarded&quot; politically, by one of their own being appointed vice president or to a high-profile political office by the winning candidate. In the 2002 general elections of Kenya, the Luhya proved this point when outgoing president Daniel Arap Moi appointed Musalia Mudavadi as vice president in an attempt to lure Luhyas to vote for Uhuru Kenyatta, his choice of successor with Musalia as running mate. The Luhyas remained adamant in their support for the opposition then led by Mwai Kibaki who also had a Luhya, Michael Kijana Wamalwa as running mate. The Luhyas dealt a severe blow to Moi&#x27;s candidate by voting en masse for Kibaki who thereafter won the election with Wamalwa as his vice president. Of the eleven vice presidents of Kenya since independence, three have been Luhyas. 

Others who have held high-profile political offices include, Musalia Mudavadi, current deputy Prime Minister formerly 7th Vice President (Sept. 2002 – Dec 2002), Michael Wamalwa Kijana, 8th Vice President of Kenya (January 2003 – August 2003), Moody Awori, 9th Vice President of Kenya (September 2003 – January 2008), Amos Wako, longest-serving Attorney General of Kenya - 19 years in office, Kenneth Marende, Speaker of the National Assembly and Zachaias Chesoni, late former Chief Justice of Kenya.

==Culture==

Luhya culture is comparable to most Bantu cultural practices. Polygamy was a common practice in the past. Today, with the influence of Christianity, it is practiced by only a few people, usually, if the man marries under traditional African law or Muslim law. Civil marriages (conducted by government authorities) and Christian marriages preclude the possibility of polygamy.

About 10 to 15 families traditionally made up a village, headed by a village headman (&quot;Omukasa&quot;). Oweliguru is a title for a village leader coined from the English word &quot;Crew.&quot; Within a family, the man of the home was the ultimate authority, followed by his first-born son. In a polygamous family, the first wife held the most prestigious position among women.

The first-born son of the first wife was usually the main heir to his father, even if he happened to be younger than his half-brothers from his father&#x27;s other wives. Daughters had no permanent position in Luhya families as they would eventually become other men&#x27;s wives. They did not inherit property and were excluded from decision-making meetings within the family. Today, girls are allowed to inherit property, in accordance with Kenyan law.

Children are named after the sub-clan&#x27;s ancestors, usually after their grandparents, and after acts of nature like the weather etc. The paternal grandparents take precedence so that the first-born son will usually be named after his paternal grandfather (Kuka or &#x27;Guga&#x27; in Maragoli) while the first-born daughter will be named after her paternal grandmother (&#x27;Kukhu&#x27; or &#x27;Guku&#x27; in Maragoli.) 

Subsequent children may be named after maternal grandparents, after significant events, such as the weather at the time of birth, seasons, etc. The name Wafula, for example, is given to a boy born during the rainy season (&quot;ifula&quot; or &quot;efula&quot;). Wanjala is given to one born during famine (&quot;injala&quot; or &quot;enjala&quot; to mean &#x27;hunger&#x27;). 

Traditionally, they practiced arranged marriages. The parents of a boy would approach the parents of a girl to ask for her hand in marriage. If the girl agreed, negotiations for dowry would begin. Typically, this would be 12 cattle and similar numbers of sheep or goats, to be paid by the groom&#x27;s parents to the bride&#x27;s family. Once the dowry was delivered, the girl was fetched by the groom&#x27;s sisters to begin her new life as a wife. 

Instances of eloping were and are still common. Young men would elope with willing girls, with negotiations for a dowry to be conducted later. In such cases, the young man would also pay a fine to the parents of the girl. Abductions are normal. From December 2019 through June 2020, Human Rights Watch interviewed 37 people about the kidnappings, including 28 female survivors of sexual violence, 5 of whom were children at the time of the abuse. As polygamy is allowed, a middle-aged man will typically have two to three wives.

When a man got very old and handed over the running of his homestead to his sons, the sons would sometimes find a young woman for the old man to marry . Such girls were normally those who could not find men to marry them, usually because they had children out of wedlock. Wife inheritance was and is still, though rare, practiced. 

A widow would normally be inherited by her husband&#x27;s brother or cousin. In some cases, the eldest son would inherit his father&#x27;s widows (though not his own mother) . Modern-day Luhyas do not practice some of the traditional customs as most have adopted a Christian way of life. Many Luhyas live in towns and cities for most of their lives and only return to settle in the rural areas after retirement or the death of parents.

They had extensive customs surrounding death. There would be a great celebration at the home of the deceased, with mourning lasting up to forty days . If the deceased was a wealthy or influential man, a big tree would be uprooted and the deceased would be buried there. After the burial, another tree Mutoto, Mukhuyu or Mukumu would be planted. (This was a sacred tree and is found along most Luhya migration paths it could only be planted by a righteous lady mostly a virgin or a very old lady.)

Nowadays, mourning takes less time (about one week) and the celebrations are held at the time of burial. &quot;Obukoko&quot; and &quot;Lisabo&quot; are post-burial ceremonies held to complete mourning rites.

Animal sacrifices were traditionally practiced. There was great fear of the &quot;Abalosi&quot; or &quot;Avaloji&quot; (witches) and &quot;Babini&quot; (wizards). These were &quot;night-runners&quot; who prowled in the nude running from one house to another casting spells.

===Religious Conversion===
Most modern-day Luhyas are Christians; for some (if not all) the word for God is Nyasaye or Nyasae (Were Khakaba).

The word Nyasae when translated into English roughly corresponds with &quot;Nya&quot; (of) and &quot;Asae/ Asaye/ Sae/ Saye&quot; (Prayer). The Luhya traditionally worshiped an ancient &#x27;god&#x27; of the same name (commonly known as Isis, or Were Khakaba. When Christianity was re-introduced to the Luhya in the early 1900s by Christian missionaries from Europe and America, the Luhya peoples took the name of their traditional god, Nyasae, and gave that name to the Living Abrahamic God.

The first Luhyas who were converted to Christianity took words, names, their perceptions of what Christian missionaries told them about the Christian God, and other aspects of their indigenous religious traditions, and applied them to their interpretations of Christ and God.

The Friends Church (Quakers) opened a mission at Kaimosi and the Church of God took over the mission in Bunyore. During the same period, the Catholic order Mill Hill Brothers came to the area of Mumias. The Church of God of Anderson, Indiana, US, arrived in 1905 and began work at Kima in Bunyore. Other Christian groups such as the Anglicans (CMS) came in 1906. In 1924 the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada began their work in Nyan&#x27;gori. The Salvation Army came to Malakisi in 1936. The Baptists came to western Kenya in the early 1960s.

The first Bible translation in a Luyia language was produced by Nicholas Stamp in the Wanga language. Osundwa says he did this translation in Mumias, the former capital of the Wanga kingdom of Mumia.

A religious sect known as Dini ya Msambwa was founded by Elijah Masinde in 1948. They worship &quot;Were,&quot; the Bukusu god of Mt. Elgon, while at the same time using portions of the Bible to teach their converts. They also practice traditional arts referred to by some as witchcraft. This movement originally arose as part of an anti-colonial resistance.

Various sources estimate that 75%-90% profess Christianity.

===Initiation===

With the smugglers of the Marama and Saamia, male circumcision was practised. A few sub-ethnic groups practiced clitoridectomy but, even in those, it was limited to a few instances and was not as widespread as it was among the Agikuyu. The Maragoli did not practice it at all. Outlawing of the practice by the government led to its end, even though it can occur among the Tachoni.

Traditionally, circumcision was part of a period of training for adult responsibilities for the youth. Among those in Kakamega, the initiation was carried out every four or five years, depending on the clan. This resulted in various age sets notably, Kolongolo, Kananachi, Kikwameti, Kinyikeu, Nyange, Maina, and Sawa in that order.

The Abanyala in Navakholo initiate boys every other year and notably on even years. The initiates are about 8 to 13 years old, and the ceremony was followed by a period of seclusion for the initiates. On their coming out of seclusion, there would be a feast in the village, followed by a period of counselling by a group of elders.

The newly initiated youths would then build bachelor-huts for each other, where they would stay until they were old enough to become warriors. This kind of initiation is no longer practiced among the Kakamega Luhya, with the exception of the Tiriki.

Nowadays, the initiates are usually circumcised in hospital, and there is no seclusion period. On healing, a party is held for the initiate — who then usually goes back to school to continue with his studies.

Among the Bukusu, the Tachoni and (to a much lesser extent) the Nyala and the Kabras, the traditional methods of initiation persist. Circumcision is held every even year in August and December (the latter only among the Tachoni and the Kabras), and the initiates are typically 11 to 15 years old.

==Economic activities==

===Food and agriculture===
The main food for the Luhya people like most Kenyans is ugali (made from maize flour/cornmeal) served with vegetables and meat of cattle, goat, fish or chicken; hence food production in the region is targeted to meet this need. The lower counties of Vihiga, Kakamega and Busia grow substance crops of maize on their low acreage plots, they raise chicken and keep cattle. The Upper parts of Bungoma and the Kitale grow large scale maize and produce milk from dairy cows. Fish farming is becoming very prevalent thus producing farm-raised tilapia for consumption. Busia, Mumias and lower Bungoma produce cassava and millet. There is normally a maize supply deficit in the production seasons of the year and a surplus supply during the harvest months resulting in much lower prices to producers during harvest and very high prices to consumers during production months. The producer and consumer may be the same person in different months. The largest sugar production facilities in Kenya are located in the western region where the Luhya people predominantly live. Mumias Sugar Company, Kabras Sugar Company and Nzoia Sugar Company have their contract production zones in the Luhya peoples region, hence sugarcane production is a key commercial enterprise. In Vihiga and some areas of Kakamega, tea bushes are very visible, making tea another key commercial crop grown in this region.

Chicken is a delicacy among the Luhya people, and it is a small leap from raising subsistence chickens to commercial chicken.

While everyone speaks their language, food and commercial farming are very unifying endeavors, the language or dialect people speak do not define what they grow or raise – economics and proximity to market determine that.

===Economy===
The Luhya people mainly live in the following districts;

In Kenya,

Kakamega- HQ Kakamega town, sugarcane is the main farming activity.

Bungoma- HQ Bungoma town, the main economy is dependent on grains and sugar.

Vihiga- HQ Mbale town Tea farming and grain farming is the main income for locals.

Busia- HQ Busia Town, Fishing and grain farming is the main local activity.

Trans Nzoia- HQ Kitale, Maize farming is the most economic activity.

Busia- HQ Busia town, just like Kenya Samia people are. Both farmers and Fishermen.

Mbale- HQ Mbale town, The Masaba or Gishu people are predominantly Coffee and tea farmers. As they occupy the slopes of My.Elgon. Mbale district of Uganda is considered the most populous rural district with 257 persons per KM square. Mbale town is in the process of being made the second city in Uganda second to Kampala city.

Luhya peoples also live in Southern and Eastern Uganda, as well as northern Tanzania.

<text>Nidia Guenard (born March 12, 1979) is an American retired professional wrestler. She is best known for her time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) under her first name, where she is known for co-winning the inaugural season of Tough Enough alongside Maven in 2001. She was with the company until 2004.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001-2004)===

====&quot;Tough Enough&quot; (2001)====
Guenard began her professional wrestling career in 2001 upon being selected to participate in the inaugural season of &quot;Tough Enough&quot;, a reality television show meant both to be a semi-documentary of the difficulties of being a trainee professional wrestler and used by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to find new WWF stars. Ultimately, Guenard would become the co-winner of the competition alongside Maven.

====Ohio Valley Wrestling (2001–2002)====
Guenard made a few appearances on WWF episodes in 2001 before being sent to the Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) promotion, with whom WWE had a talent-development agreement. While in OVW she feuded with Victoria.

====SmackDown! (2002–2004)====

Guenard debuted on the SmackDown! brand on the June 6, 2002 episode, in a backstage segment with The Hurricane (who was her on-screen ex-boyfriend) and Jamie Noble. Noble and Guenard then became an on-screen couple in a &quot;trailer trash&quot; gimmick. They were both playing as heels, with Nidia leading Noble to several wins, due to interference during the matches. At the King of the Ring she led Noble to winning the Cruiserweight Championship from The Hurricane. She then began to feud with SmackDown! Diva Torrie Wilson leading to many solo and mixed tag team matches with Guenard and Noble against Wilson and various other cruiserweights, including Funaki, Billy Kidman, Rey Mysterio, and Brian Kendrick.

On the October 16, 2003 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; Guenard was blinded by Tajiri during a match between Tajiri and Noble, after which Tajiri spewed his &quot;Black mist&quot; onto her face (this version of the mist was only ever seen in this instance). Storyline-wise, this encounter resulted in a physical &#x27;injury&#x27; to Guenard. After recovering, Guenard started appearing at ringside with sunglasses on, to &#x27;sell&#x27; the aftereffects of her injuries. During this time, Noble would throw Guenard in front of various opponents at a match&#x27;s climax, to both save himself and let him later accuse them of &quot;hitting a woman&quot;, etc. Later in this storyline, Rey Mysterio revealed to Guenard that Noble was exploiting her in the aforementioned manner, resulting in Guenard turning against Noble and becoming a fan favorite in the process. The two feuded, culminating in a match at No Way Out in which Noble had to wear a blindfold. True to character, Noble cheated to win as he removed his blindfold during the match.

====Raw (2004)====
Guenard was drafted to the Raw Brand on March 22, 2004. She became a face and claimed to be excited that she was drafted to Raw, where she can compete for the WWE Women&#x27;s Championship. She made her debut match on the March 29, 2004 episode of &quot;Raw&quot;, defeating Molly Holly. She then tag teamed regularly with Stacy Keibler and Victoria against heels Trish Stratus, Gail Kim, Molly Holly and Jazz. With the shift to &quot;Raw&quot; also came a change in character, as Guenard&#x27;s Hispanic heritage was played up; to this effect, she was no longer billed as being from the South but instead she was billed as being from Puerto Rico and she no longer spoke English during promos, instead speaking Spanish in a quick and angry fashion. Guenard was released from her WWE contract on November 3, 2004 along with several other performers, in a routine purge of talent.

=== Independent circuit (2004–2005)===
Guenard worked several wrestling matches post-WWE, including versus Gail Kim for Mexico&#x27;s Toryumon and for Australia&#x27;s World Series Wrestling. In addition, she worked for TNA overseas &quot;a few times.&quot; In a ClubWWI.com interview, she said they were fun to work for, but she liked her freedom from wrestling, in general. She also wrestled for Northeast Wrestling (NWE), where she feuded with Jackie Gayda.

In 2016, she made a rare appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony.

==Personal life==
Guenard and her husband David Krichmar have two children. In February 2010, she began training at the Culinary Institute Lenôtre in Houston, Texas.

<text>Health Net, LLC, a subsidiary of Centene, is an American health care insurance provider. Health Net and its subsidiaries provide health plans for individuals, families, businesses and people with Medicare and Medicaid, as well as commercial, small business, and affordable care insurance.

In 2016, Centene acquired Health Net for $6.8 billion.

== History ==
Health Net was established as the nonprofit Health Net of California in 1977 by Blue Cross. In 1992, a California order permitted the company to convert from a nonprofit to a for-profit company. Under the terms of the California Department of Corporations&#x27; conversion order, the California Wellness Foundation, the successor charity to its nonprofit status, received $300 million plus 80 percent of the equity of Health Net&#x27;s parent holding company.

In August 1993, Health Net merged with Qualmed to form Health Systems International. In April 1997, Health Systems International merged with Foundation Health Corporation to form Foundation Health Systems. Also in 1997, Foundation Health Systems acquired PACC Health Plans and Physicians Health Services.

In November 2000, Foundation Health Systems changed its name to Health Net, Inc. when the company started trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol HNT.

In July 2009, UnitedHealth Group bought Health Net&#x27;s northeastern licensed subsidiaries for $510 million, and its Medicare and Medicaid businesses for $60 million. In November 2009, Connecticut&#x27;s attorney general office investigated a lost, unencrypted hard drive with customer data. Health Net offered two years of free credit protection from a company called Debix to affected customers.

In November 2010, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) suspended Health Net for marketing and enrolling new members for compliance issues. The sanctions were lifted in August 2011. In January 2012, the company agreed to sell its Medicare Prescription Drug Plan (PDP) business to CVS Caremark Corp. (CVS) for approximately $160 million in cash. Health Net continued to providing prescription drug plans as part of its Medicare Advantage plans.

=== Mergers and Acquisitions ===
On July 2, 2015, Centene Corporation announced it would acquire Health Net for $6.8 billion. The acquisition was completed in March 2016 and combined headquarters were established in St. Louis, Missouri. The acquisition resulted in Health Net Federal Services (HNFS) becoming a separate subsidiary of Centene.

In 2018, Health Net in Arizona was merged into other Centene holdings to form Arizona Complete Health, and Martha Smith was named as its Plan President and CEO. Separately, in September 2019, Brian Ternan was appointed CEO of Health Net in California, leading operations in that state.

== Legal cases ==
In 2007, a California patient sued Health Net claiming that the company wrongfully terminated her care during chemotherapy treatments. During the case, a company employee performance review revealed that a manager had tied bonuses for an analyst in charge of rescission reviews to the rate of enrollees whose coverage was discontinued. Health Net claimed that the patient withheld health information, including a heart problem, that would have disqualified her from coverage. She replied that the insurance broker had filled out the form for her. In February 2008, the court ruled in Bates&#x27; favor and ordered Health Net to over $9 million in damages.

In 2008, Health Net agreed to pay $215M to settle allegations that it had unfairly reimbursed out-of-network providers between 1995 and 2007.

In September 2012, the Los Angeles County Medical Association and two patients sued Health Net for denying medically necessary treatment, including cancer care. The lawsuit alleged that Health Net denied claims based on its own definition of &quot;medical necessity&quot; rather than standards set forth by California law. A judge ruled in Health Net&#x27;s favor in July 2013.

In 2016, Health Net Federal Services became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centene, ending its time as a publicly traded company. In 2021, Health Net&#x27;s former subsidiary, Health Net Federal Services, agreed to pay $97M to settle allegations that it had duplicated or inflated claims submitted to the Department of Veterans Affairs between 2013 and 2019.

<text>HSBC Bank Canada (), formerly the Hongkong Bank of Canada (HBC), was a British-Canadian chartered bank and the former Canadian subsidiary of British multinational banking and financial services company HSBC.

It was the seventh largest bank in Canada, with offices in every province except Prince Edward Island, and was the largest foreign-owned bank in the country. The corporate headquarters were located at the HSBC Canada Building in downtown Vancouver, British Columbia.

On March 28, 2024, the Royal Bank of Canada closed their acquisition of HSBC Canada. Its Institution Number (or bank number) was 016.

==History==

In 1979, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation bought a Vancouver-based acceptance company that financed machinery and equipment for small companies operating in British Columbia. In 1981, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation incorporated Hongkong Bank of Canada (HBC), in Vancouver as a chartered bank effective July 1, 1981, under the Bank Act of Canada using the acceptance company as a base for the new bank. HBC had a few retail branches primarily focused on Asian-Canadians whose primary business centred on commercial enterprises. HBC opened branches in major cities in western Canada and in Toronto and Montreal but growth was slow. HBC sought to grow by acquisition, but the first three attempts to buy an existing institution were unsuccessful. HBC acquired the assets of Bank of British Columbia on November 27, 1986, which had essentially failed. This acquisition gave HBC an additional $2.6 billion in assets and 41 branches in British Columbia and Alberta propelling it overnight from the 20th largest to 9th largest bank in Canada.

On May 20, 1988, HBC amalgamated with Midland Bank Canada, gaining many new corporate banking relationships, combined assets of $472 million, and expanding to Eastern Canada. It acquired Lloyds Bank Canada on May 29, 1990, thereby adding another $4.4 billion in assets and 53 branches. Lloyds Bank had acquired Continental Bank of Canada in 1986. Continental Bank began in 1973 as Niagara Finance Company, later became IAC Limited, and then Continental Bank.

By October 31, 1990, HBC&#x27;s assets were $10.2 billion and its branch network had doubled with most of its newly acquired branches located in Ontario and Quebec. The acquisition of Lloyds also made the company Canada&#x27;s largest foreign bank and a bilingual operation with branches in eight Quebec communities. On April 30, 1993, HBC acquired ANZ Canada consisting of one office in Toronto, which it combined with the existing HBC branch at 70 York Street. ANZ had acquired Grindlays Bank Canada with its 1984 acquisition of Grindlays Bank, but management sold the component to HBC to focus on expansion in the Asia-Pacific area. The purchase of ANZ made HBC the seventh largest bank in Canada with branches in every province except Prince Edward Island. HBC acquired the single-office Metropolitan Trust Company of Canada on August 1, 1995.

HBC acquired Barclays Bank Canada on August 31, 1996. Barclays had re-entered Canada in 1979 and developed a diversified but modest range of activities. In 1985, Barclays bought the assets of Wells Fargo Bank (Canada), consisting of its operations in Alberta and Florida, so that Wells Fargo could re-focus on its home market. In 1993, Barclays Bank Canada closed its Edmonton branch and the following year, it closed six additional branches in Vancouver, Calgary, Winnipeg, London, Montreal and Halifax, retaining only its head office. Barclays&#x27; Canadian operations lost approximately $120-million between 1992 and 1996.

In response to the growing north-south trade occasioned by the adoption of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), HBC acquired the Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon branches of Marine Midland Bank in 1996. This move into the United States seemed a natural expansion that followed the business interests of many of the bank&#x27;s customers. HBC acquired National Westminster Bank of Canada on May 1, 1998, which had assets of Can$844.5 million. NatWest had entered Canada in 1982. On June 21, 1999, HBC changed its name to HSBC Bank Canada, consistent with the HSBC Group&#x27;s strategy of creating the global brand, HSBC. On December 3 of that year, it acquired Prenor Trust Company of Canada.

In 2000, HSBC Bank Canada acquired Republic National Bank of New York (Canada) after HSBC acquired the parent bank. Republic had entered Canada in 1982, and was an amalgamation of several banks. Republic&#x27;s purchases included Bank Leumi Le Israel (Canada) in 1993; Israel-based Bank Hapoalim (Canada) in 1994; and Israel Discount Bank of Canada&#x27;s in 1996.

On April 1, 2001, HSBC Canada acquired CCF Canada after HSBC Holdings acquired CCF Canada&#x27;s parent company, Crédit Commercial de France (CCF). CCF had just acquired Crédit Lyonnais Canada. Credit Commercial de France (Canada) had entered Canada in 1982 when it established an office in Montreal. Société Générale (Canada) acquired it in 1990. CCF had returned to Canada in 2000.

In 2002, HSBC Holdings merged its Canadian and US operations to create a North American transnational bank. HSBC Bank USA of New York, with assets of US$87 billion, and HSBC Canada, with assets of Can$34 billion, share some operating resources but remain separate units. On June 1, 2004, HSBC Bank Canada completed its acquisition of Intesa Bank&#x27;s Canadian unit, which had 11 branches and total assets of Can$1.1 billion.

On September 20, 2011, HSBC Canada sold its full-service brokerage division, HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc., to National Bank Financial Group for Can$208 million. In June 2015, Sandra Stuart was named president and CEO, becoming the first woman to head a Canadian chartered bank.

=== Merger with RBC ===

In November 2022, HSBC announced the exit of the Canadian market. Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) will acquire 100% of the common shares of HSBC Canada for an all-cash purchase price of $13.5 billion, which is a multiple of 9.4 times HSBC Canada&#x27;s estimated 2024 earnings. Completion of the transaction is expected by late 2023, subject to regulatory approvals. HSBC has been under pressure to cut costs and divest non-Asian businesses. 

The acquisition was completed on March 28, 2024. All HSBC Canada branches closed at midday on March 28. Twenty-five of these branches, most in close proximity to existing RBC branches, closed permanently with the sale; the others reopened as RBC branches on April 1, 2024.

Effective March 15, 2010, BMO Bank of Montreal ceased accepting deposits at its ATMs from HSBC customers and resumed charging a convenience fee after five years of an ATM sharing agreement with HSBC Bank Canada. HSBC continues as a member of The Exchange Network. This was a decision HSBC took as part of a restructuring of its personal banking strategy. Instead, HSBC will rebate the convenience fee charged to its HSBC Premier qualified customers to a maximum of $2.00 per instance for using any ATM in Canada.

<text>Hoogwoud (; West Frisian: &quot;Hougwoud&quot;) is a small city in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Opmeer, and lies about northeast of Heerhugowaard.

== History ==

<text>Carcross, originally known as Caribou Crossing, () is an unincorporated community in Yukon, Canada, on Bennett Lake and Nares Lake. It is home to the Carcross/Tagish First Nation.

It is south-southeast by the Alaska Highway and the Klondike Highway from Whitehorse. The south end of the Tagish Road is in Carcross. Carcross is also on the White Pass and Yukon Route railway.

Carcross is mainly known for its world class mountain biking on the near-by Montana Mountain, and for the nearby Carcross Desert, often referred to as the &quot;world&#x27;s smallest desert.&quot;

==History==
Caribou Crossing was a fishing and hunting camp for Inland Tlingit and Tagish people. 4,500-year-old artifacts from First Nations people living in the area have been found in the region.

Originally known as &quot;Naataase Heen&quot; (Tagish for ‘water running through the narrows’), Caribou Crossing was named after the migration of huge numbers of caribou across the natural land bridge between Lake Bennett and Nares Lake. That caribou herd was decimated during the Klondike Gold Rush, but a recovery program raised the number of animals to about 450.
The modern village began in 1896, during the Klondike Gold Rush. At the time, Caribou Crossing was a popular stopping place for prospectors going to and from the gold fields of Dawson City.

Caribou Crossing was also a station for the Royal Mail and the Dominion Telegraph Line, and it served as a communications point on the Yukon River.

In 1904, Caribou Crossing was renamed Carcross as a result of some mail mix-ups with the Cariboo Regional District in nearby British Columbia.

Silver mining was promoted nearby in Conrad, Yukon in the early 1900s, but there was little to be found and mining efforts soon ended. Mineral exploration continues today, but tourism is far more important to the economy of the community.

In 2016, Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge visited Carcross for a day trip.

Popular with road traffic including tour buses and RVs, in 2007 the White Pass railway also resumed service to Carcross railway station.

Just north of the town is the Carcross Desert, often referred to as the &quot;world&#x27;s smallest desert.&quot; There are two small airports located in the area, Carcross Airport is adjacent to the town and Carcross Water Aerodrome located on Tagish Lake.

<text>Barsingerhorn (West Frisian: &quot;Barregórre&quot;) is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon, and lies about north of Heerhugowaard. It received city rights in 1415.

== History ==
The settlement was first mentioned in 1289 as Bersincshorne, and means &quot;corner (in the dike) of the people of Barse (person)&quot;. Barsingerhorn developed in the 12th century on the sea dike. Together with Haringhuizen, it received city rights in 1415.

The former town hall was built in 1622. It has a landing stairs with wooden bell tower and balustrade. There is a little jail in the cellar. A Dutch Reformed church was built in 1574, but has been demolished in 1968, because it was in a bad shape. Barsingerhorn has a modest Mennonite church from 1862. It was decommissioned in 1972 and has become private property.

Barsingerhorn was home to 926 people in 1840. It was an independent municipality until 1990 when it was merged into Niedorp. In 2012, it became part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon.

<doc id="912798" wikidata="Q2533584" url="?curid=912798" title="Jackie Gayda">
<text>Jacquelyn Suzanne Gayda (born November 3, 1981) is an American retired professional wrestler and valet, best known for her work in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). She was awarded a contract with WWE after co-winning the second series of the reality television show &quot;Tough Enough&quot; with Linda Miles.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Entertainment (2002-2005)===

====&quot;Tough Enough&quot; and debut (2002–2003)====
As soon as Gayda was awarded the &quot;Tough Enough&quot; II contract, she worked several matches on the Raw and SmackDown! brands. Gayda turned villainous on an episode of &quot;WWE Velocity&quot; by pushing her co-winner Linda Miles off the top rope, causing her to lose her match against Ivory. Five days later on &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Gayda teamed up with Ivory in a losing effort against Miles and Trish Stratus in a tag team match. In another one of her first television matches (a tag team match with Christopher Nowinski against Trish Stratus and Bradshaw on the July 8, 2002 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, that became known by wrestling fans as &quot;that Jackie Gayda match&quot;), Gayda botched multiple moves, the most infamous of which was a second-rope-bulldog by Stratus, which she sold too late. Commentator Jim Ross exclaimed that &quot;mercifully, it&#x27;s over&quot; at the end of the match, expressing relief that the poor wrestling attempts had ceased.

She was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling for further training. While in OVW, she joined the stable known as &quot;The Revolution&quot;, in addition to managing The Basham Brothers and Chris Kanyon. On June 16, 2003, she returned to WWE as Miss Jackie, managing Rico. She would later turn face after Rico&#x27;s face turn.

====Various feuds and SmackDown! (2004–2005)====

In early 2004, Gayda teamed up with Stacy Keibler, with the duo proclaiming themselves to be the WWE&#x27;s hottest divas and thought they deserved to grace the cover of Playboy magazine. This provoked a feud with &quot;SmackDown!&quot; divas and the Playboy co-cover girls Sable and Torrie Wilson. At WrestleMania XX, Gayda and Keibler were defeated by Sable and Wilson in a Playboy evening gown match.

In the second WWE Draft, Gayda and Rico were traded to &quot;SmackDown!&quot; brand, where they eventually teamed up with Charlie Haas. In September 2004, Haas and Gayda were engaged, and their relationship was eventually incorporated into their on-screen characters. Dawn Marie announced the engagement of Gayda and Haas on the September 30 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, implying in the process that she and Haas were &quot;more than just friends.&quot; This led to a catfight between Gayda and Dawn, which in turn led to an intergender tag match at No Mercy pitting Gayda, Haas, and Rico against Dawn and the Dudley Boyz. Gayda&#x27;s team won the bout, yet Dawn Marie predicted that the relationship would not last very long. From that moment onwards, Dawn Marie tried her hardest to split the couple up. On the October 7 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, Gayda found herself on the receiving end of Billy Kidman&#x27;s BK Bomb. She sold her injuries through the October tour of Europe by wearing a neckbrace, only returning to action on the October 28 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot; in Omaha, Nebraska, which saw Gayda hit the ring during a Halloween costume contest between Dawn and Torrie Wilson, spearing Dawn and tearing the clothes from her body. A vengeful Dawn then screamed to Gayda that it was not over. Dawn gained her revenge during an arm wrestling contest on the November 4 episode of &quot;SmackDown!&quot;, headbutting Gayda and catfighting with her until Haas made the save. Dawn&#x27;s ally Heidenreich then decimated Haas, dismissing Gayda&#x27;s attempts to protect Haas by shoving her to the mat. On November 25, Gayda tried to gain revenge in a &quot;Pilgrim versus Indian&quot; match, but both women were disqualified for ignoring the referee&#x27;s instructions. The two divas fought once again on December 2, this time while wearing Christmas outfits. General Manager Theodore Long finally announced a final encounter at Armageddon, appointing Haas as the referee. Gayda lost the match, and her fiancé, as the relationship was broken when Haas revealed he had an affair with Dawn Marie. He then rejected Marie afterward, saying he did not want either woman.

Gayda began wrestling as a singles performer. She appeared in numerous vignettes with the other divas until she and Haas were released from WWE on July 5, 2005, along with many other WWE wrestlers.

===Independent circuit (2005–2006)===
Gayda began working for several independent promotions, including Ballpark Brawl, where Gayda was referred to as Just Jackie and defeated Traci Brooks, Nattie Neidhart, Jamie D, and April Hunter on August 13, 2005. She also teamed with Hunter in a loss to Neidhart on August 14, 2005.

===Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005–2006)===
On the November 26, 2005 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Gayda made her debut lashing out at Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett was shocked and frightened by Gayda&#x27;s unexpected appearance and soon ordered her backstage. He was heard saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not what you think.&quot; After being pushed by Jarrett, Gayda slapped him and then went after his valet, Gail Kim. The following week, Gayda came out again to confront Jarrett. After pushing and slapping, the two had to be pulled apart by officials. At Turning Point, the same thing happened in the main event match, but officials restrained Gayda. On the December 31 show, Don West tracked down Gayda for an interview. She said her being there had nothing to do with a love affair, but rather that Jarrett had promised her a spot on the TNA Roster, but while she was stuck at home, she turned on the television to see Kim in her place. She said she had a big secret about Jarrett that TNA Management would love to hear but did not reveal what it was.

Gayda won TNA&#x27;s Knockout of the Year 2005 on the January 14, 2006 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;. At Final Resolution, she ran into Raven after he lost his match. She told him that they had something in common, they were both being screwed by TNA Management. On the January 28 episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, Gayda came down to ringside during a Jarrett versus Jay Lethal match to hand an audiotape to Kim. She then left, with a confused Kim soon following.

Jarrett then hired Alex Shelley to videotape Gayda at her home for blackmail. Shelley complied, returning a week later with a videotape. On the February 18, 2006, episode of &quot;Impact!&quot;, she told Jarrett that he had won and that she would leave. Jarrett refused to comply and used the tape Shelley compiled of Gayda as blackmail to get her to join his stable. Jackie became the manager of Planet Jarrett. She feuded with Gail Kim in mid-2006. At Sacrifice Jackie announced that she was pregnant, so Kim kayfabe fired her. She was later released from her contract and retired.

===Return to wrestling (2009–2011)===

In April 2009, Gayda returned to WWE for one-night-only as a part of the 25 Diva battle royal at WrestleMania XXV.

On August 30, 2010, Mexican promotion Perros del Mal Producciones announced that Gayda, under the ring name Miss Jackie, would wrestle for the promotion on September 16, on the same card as her husband Charlie Haas. At the event Jackie and Celestial defeated Jennifer Blake and Mini Chessman in a tag team match. She appeared again on February 11, 2011, on the Viva La Lucha PPV, teaming with NY Knockout Nikki to take on Christina Von Eerie and Jennifer Blake (a match that she won for her team, via crossbody into a pin). On August 20, 2011, Haas became her husband&#x27;s manager where he became the inaugural Family Wrestling Entertainment (FWE) Heavyweight Champion by defeating Jay Lethal and Eric Young. He held the championship for four months before losing it to Young on December 17, the same night Jackie made her in-ring debut for FWE in a loss to Winter.

== Personal life ==
Gayda married fellow professional wrestler Charlie Haas in 2005. The couple have four children: Kayla (born 2006), Taylor (born 2008), Thomas (born 2010), and Charles (born 2012). In December 2020, Haas announced that he and Gayda are divorced.

In 2008, Haas and Gayda opened the &quot;Custom Muscle Nutrition and Smoothie Shop&quot;, a nutritional store, in Frisco, Texas.

<text>Wilsum is a small city in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is located in the municipality of Kampen, about 4 km southeast of that city.

== History ==
The city was first mentioned in 1213 as Wilsem, and means &quot;settlement of Willa (person)&quot;. Wilsum developed on the dike along the IJssel River. Wilsum received city rights in 1331. 

The Dutch Reformed church was built in the middle of the 11 century. The spire dates from 1837. The tower probably served as a place of refuge as well, because the top can only be reached by a ladder. Thanks to several restorations (the last one being between 1980 and 1983) the church is still in a very good state.

In 1527, a sconce was built near the city, however it was destroyed the next year. Wilsum was home to 435 people in 1840.

Wilsum was a separate municipality until 1937, when it became a part of IJsselmuiden.

<doc id="912824" wikidata="Q58456" url="?curid=912824" title="Schalksmühle">
<text>Schalksmühle is a municipality in district Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is the town with the highest rate of millionaires relating to the population in North Rhine-Westphalia (2004).

==Geography==
Schalksmühle is located in the hills of the Sauerland, and the altitude of the 38.2 km² area varies between 183 m (Pulvermühle) and 502 m (east of Sonnenscheid) above sea level. 45% of the area is covered by forest, another 35% is used for agricultural purposes. The main river is the Volme, a tributary of the Ruhr.

==History==
The oldest written documents on the municipality date back to 1350, when the farmers of Hülscheid formed a free duchy. The largest extent of the &quot;Freigrafschaft Hülscheid&quot; was in 1478, when it contained not only the &quot;Kirchspiel Hülscheid&quot;, but also the northwestern part of the &quot;Kirchspiel Lüdenscheid&quot;.

Schalksmühle itself was first mentioned on May 1, 1407 in a document by archbishop Friedrich of Cologne, when Gerwin of Altenbreckerfeld, a merchant, donated an altar to the church of Breckerfeld. One of the villages leased by Gerwin was &quot;Schalksmollen in parrochia Halvere&quot; (Schalksmühle in the parish Halver).

The municipality in its modern boundaries was created during the communal reforms of 1969/70. Becoming effective on January 1, 1969 the municipality Schalksmühle was merged with the municipality Hülscheid (previously in the &quot;Amt Lüdenscheid&quot;). On January 1, 1970 the municipality Dahlerbrück (previously in the &quot;Amt Breckerfeld&quot;, district Ennepe-Ruhr) was also added to it.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combined the symbols of the two municipalities merged in 1969. The top part shows the upper half of a black mill wheel (&quot;Mühle&quot; is German for mill), the symbol for Schalksmühle. In the bottom are three leaves of European Holly (&quot;Ilex aquifolium&quot;), which was taken from the coat of arms of the municipality Hülscheid. As no traditional symbols were found for Hülscheid a &quot;talking symbol&quot; was chosen - &quot;Hülsebusch&quot; is one of several traditional German names of the Ilex. The two symbols are separated by a red-and-white chequered bordure as the symbol of the counts of the Mark. The coat of arms was granted on July 21, 1970.

Before 1969 the coat of arms of the municipality was very similar to the current one, except that the bottom part of the shield was a simple golden field. That coat of arms was granted on March 29, 1935. The coat of arms of the municipality of Hülscheid had the Ilex leaves instead of the mill wheel in top. That coat of arms was granted on January 16, 1935. Both were designed by Otto Hupp, based on an idea of Fritz Thomée, former Landrat of the district Altena.

== Economy ==
The economy of Schalkmühle is determined by companies of the electrical business: Berker GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Rutenbeck Fernmeldetechnik (Gebäude-Kommunikationstechnik), Albrecht Jung GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Lumberg GmbH &amp; Co. KG, Günther Spelsberg GmbH + Co.KG, Kaiser GmbH &amp; Co. KG and Busch-Jaeger Elektro GmbH &amp; Co. KG.

==Twin towns==
Schalksmühle is twinned with two towns. Since July 1987 it has had a partnership with Ruhla in Thuringia (at that time in East Germany). Since 1970 it has had a partnership with the English district of Wansbeck in Northumberland. This originated when a young man (Klaus Floeren) from Iserlohn worked for some time in the town of Bedlington and met his future wife (Muriel Binks) there.

After moving to Schalksmühle with their young son Rolf, the couple suggested a partnership between the two communities. When Bedlington town council was merged with Ashington and Newbiggin-by-the-Sea to form the district of Wansbeck, the partnership was continued by the new district council.

One of the roads in Bedlington is named Schalksmühle road

<doc id="912825" wikidata="Q1975075" url="?curid=912825" title="Parallel curve">
<text>A parallel of a curve is the envelope of a family of congruent circles centered on the curve. 
It generalises the concept of &quot;parallel (straight) lines&quot;. It can also be defined as a curve whose points are at a constant &quot;normal distance&quot; from a given curve. 
These two definitions are not entirely equivalent as the latter assumes smoothness, whereas the former does not.

In computer-aided design the preferred term for a parallel curve is offset curve. (In other geometric contexts, the term offset can also refer to translation.) Offset curves are important, for example, in numerically controlled machining, where they describe, for example, the shape of the cut made by a round cutting tool of a two-axis machine. The shape of the cut is offset from the trajectory of the cutter by a constant distance in the direction normal to the cutter trajectory at every point.

In the area of 2D computer graphics known as vector graphics, the (approximate) computation of parallel curves is involved in one of the fundamental drawing operations, called stroking, which is typically applied to polylines or polybeziers (themselves called paths) in that field.

Except in the case of a line or circle, the parallel curves have a more complicated mathematical structure than the progenitor curve. For example, even if the progenitor curve is smooth, its offsets may not be so; this property is illustrated in the top figure, using a sine curve as progenitor curve. In general, even if a curve is rational, its offsets may not be so. For example, the offsets of a parabola are rational curves, but the offsets of an ellipse or of a hyperbola are not rational, even though these progenitor curves themselves are rational.

The notion also generalizes to 3D surfaces, where it is called an offset surface or parallel surface. Increasing a solid volume by a (constant) distance offset is sometimes called &quot;dilation&quot;. The opposite operation is sometimes called &quot;shelling&quot;. Offset surfaces are important in numerically controlled machining, where they describe the shape of the cut made by a ball nose end mill of a three-axis machine. Other shapes of cutting bits can be modelled mathematically by general offset surfaces.

== Parallel curve of a parametrically given curve ==
If there is a regular parametric representation formula_1 of the given curve available, the second definition of a parallel curve (s. above) leads to the following parametric representation of the parallel curve with distance formula_2:

:formula_3 with the unit normal formula_4.
In cartesian coordinates:
:formula_5
:formula_6

The distance parameter formula_7 may be negative. In this case, one gets a parallel curve on the opposite side of the curve (see diagram on the parallel curves of a circle). One can easily check that a parallel curve of a line is a parallel line in the common sense, and the parallel curve of a circle is a concentric circle.

===Geometric properties:===
*formula_8 that means: the tangent vectors for a fixed parameter are parallel.
*formula_9 with formula_10 the curvature of the given curve and formula_11 the curvature of the parallel curve for parameter formula_12.
*formula_13 with formula_14 the radius of curvature of the given curve and formula_15 the radius of curvature of the parallel curve for parameter formula_12.
* When they exist, the osculating circles to parallel curves at corresponding points are concentric. 
*As for parallel lines, a normal line to a curve is also normal to its parallels.
*When parallel curves are constructed they will have cusps when the distance from the curve matches the radius of curvature. These are the points where the curve touches the evolute.
*If the progenitor curve is a boundary of a planar set and its parallel curve is without self-intersections, then the latter is the boundary of the Minkowski sum of the planar set and the disk of the given radius.

If the given curve is polynomial (meaning that formula_17 and formula_18 are polynomials), then the parallel curves are usually not polynomial. In CAD area this is a drawback, because CAD systems use polynomials or rational curves. In order to get at least rational curves, the square root of the representation of the parallel curve has to be solvable. Such curves are called &quot;pythagorean hodograph curves&quot; and were investigated by R.T. Farouki.

== Parallel curves of an implicit curve ==

Generally the analytic representation of a parallel curve of an implicit curve is not possible. Only for the simple cases of lines and circles the parallel curves can be described easily.
For example:
: &quot;Line&quot; formula_19 → distance function: formula_20 (Hesse normalform)
: &quot;Circle&quot; formula_21 → distance function: formula_22

In general, presuming certain conditions, one can prove the existence of an oriented distance function formula_23. In practice one has to treat it numerically. Considering parallel curves the following is true:
* The parallel curve for distance d is the level set formula_24 of the corresponding oriented distance function formula_25.

===Properties of the distance function:===
*formula_26
* formula_27
*formula_28

Example:
The diagram shows parallel curves of the implicit curve with equation formula_29 
&quot;Remark:&quot;
The curves formula_30 are not parallel curves, because formula_31 is not true in the area of interest.

== Further examples ==

*The involutes of a given curve are a set of parallel curves. For example: the involutes of a circle are parallel spirals (see diagram).

And:
* A parabola has as (two-sided) offsets rational curves of degree 6.
* A hyperbola or an ellipse has as (two-sided) offsets an algebraic curve of degree 8.
* A Bézier curve of degree has as (two-sided) offsets algebraic curves of degree . In particular, a cubic Bézier curve has as (two-sided) offsets algebraic curves of degree 10.

==Parallel curve to a curve with a corner==

When determining the cutting path of part with a sharp corner for machining, you must define the parallel (offset) curve to a given curve that has a discontinuous normal at the corner. Even though the given curve is not smooth at the sharp corner, its parallel curve may be smooth with a continuous normal, or it may have cusps when the distance from the curve matches the radius of curvature at the sharp corner.

===Normal fans===
As described above, the parametric representation of a parallel curve, formula_32, to a given curver, formula_33, with distance formula_34 is:

:formula_35 with the unit normal formula_4.

At a sharp corner (formula_37), the normal to formula_38 given by formula_39 is discontinuous, meaning the one-sided limit of the normal from the left formula_40 is unequal to the limit from the right formula_41. Mathematically,
:formula_42.
However, we can define a normal fan formula_43 that provides an interpolant between formula_40 and formula_41, and use formula_43 in place of formula_39 at the sharp corner:
:formula_48where formula_49.

The resulting definition of the parallel curve formula_32 provides the desired behavior:
:formula_51

== Algorithms ==
In general, the parallel curve of a Bézier curve is not another Bézier curve, a result proved by Tiller and Hanson in 1984. Thus, in practice, approximation techniques are used. Any desired level of accuracy is possible by repeatedly subdividing the curve, though better techniques require fewer subdivisions to attain the same level of accuracy. A 1997 survey by Elber, Lee and Kim is widely cited, though better techniques have been proposed more recently. A modern technique based on curve fitting, with references and comparisons to other algorithms, as well as open source JavaScript source code, was published in a blog post in September 2022.

Another efficient algorithm for offsetting is the level approach described by
Kimmel and Bruckstein (1993).

== Parallel (offset) surfaces ==

Offset surfaces are important in numerically controlled machining, where they describe the shape of the cut made by a ball nose end mill of a three-axis mill. If there is a regular parametric representation formula_52 of the given surface available, the second definition of a parallel curve (see above) generalizes to the following parametric representation of the parallel surface with distance formula_2:

:formula_54 with the unit normal formula_55.

Distance parameter formula_7 may be negative, too. In this case one gets a parallel surface on the opposite side of the surface (see similar diagram on the parallel curves of a circle). One easily checks: a parallel surface of a plane is a parallel plane in the common sense and the parallel surface of a sphere is a concentric sphere.

===Geometric properties:===
*formula_57 that means: the tangent vectors for fixed parameters are parallel.
*formula_58 that means: the normal vectors for fixed parameters match direction.
*formula_59 where formula_60 and formula_61 are the shape operators for formula_62 and formula_63, respectively.
:The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace.
*formula_64 where formula_65 and formula_66 are the inverses of the shape operators for formula_62 and formula_63, respectively.
:The principal radii of curvature are the eigenvalues of the inverse of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean radius of curvature is half its trace.
Note the similarity to the geometric properties of parallel curves.

== Generalizations ==
The problem generalizes fairly obviously to higher dimensions e.g. to offset surfaces, and slightly less trivially to pipe surfaces. Note that the terminology for the higher-dimensional versions varies even more widely than in the planar case, e.g. other authors speak of parallel fibers, ribbons, and tubes. For curves embedded in 3D surfaces the offset may be taken along a geodesic.

Another way to generalize it is (even in 2D) to consider a variable distance, e.g. parametrized by another curve. One can for example stroke (envelope) with an ellipse instead of circle as it is possible for example in METAFONT.

More recently Adobe Illustrator has added somewhat similar facility in version CS5, although the control points for the variable width are visually specified. In contexts where it&#x27;s important to distinguish between constant and variable distance offsetting the acronyms CDO and VDO are sometimes used.

===General offset curves===
Assume you have a regular parametric representation of a curve, formula_69, and you have a second curve that can be parameterized by its unit normal, formula_70, where the normal of formula_71 (this parameterization by normal exists for curves whose curvature is strictly positive or negative, and thus convex, smooth, and not straight). The parametric representation of the general offset curve of formula_33 offset by formula_70 is:

:formula_74 where formula_4 is the unit normal of formula_33.
Note that the trival offset, formula_77, gives you ordinary parallel (aka, offset) curves.

====Geometric properties:====
*formula_8 that means: the tangent vectors for a fixed parameter are parallel.
*As for parallel lines, a normal to a curve is also normal to its general offsets.
*formula_79 with formula_11 the curvature of the general offset curve, formula_10 the curvature of formula_33, and formula_83 the curvature of formula_84 for parameter formula_12.
*formula_86 with formula_15 the radius of curvature of the general offset curve, formula_14 the radius of curvature of formula_33, and formula_90 the radius of curvature of formula_84 for parameter formula_12.
*When general offset curves are constructed they will have cusps when the curvature of the curve matches curvature of the offset. These are the points where the curve touches the evolute.

===General offset surfaces===
General offset surfaces describe the shape of cuts made by a variety of cutting bits used by three-axis end mills in numerically controlled machining. Assume you have a regular parametric representation of a surface, formula_52, and you have a second surface that can be parameterized by its unit normal, formula_70, where the normal of formula_71 (this parameterization by normal exists for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is strictly positive, and thus convex, smooth, and not flat). The parametric representation of the general offset surface of formula_33 offset by formula_70 is:

:formula_98 where formula_99 is the unit normal of formula_100.
Note that the trival offset, formula_77, gives you ordinary parallel (aka, offset) surfaces.

====Geometric properties:====
*As for parallel lines, the tangent plane of a surface is parallel to the tangent plane of its general offsets.
*As for parallel lines, a normal to a surface is also normal to its general offsets.
*formula_102 where formula_103 and formula_104 are the shape operators for formula_105 and formula_106, respectively.
:The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace.
*formula_107 where formula_108 and formula_109 are the inverses of the shape operators for formula_105 and formula_106, respectively.
:The principal radii of curvature are the eigenvalues of the inverse of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the reciprocal of the Gaussian curvature is its determinant, and the mean radius of curvature is half its trace.
Note the similarity to the geometric properties of general offset curves.

===Derivation of geometric properties for general offsets===
The geometric properties listed above for general offset curves and surfaces can be derived for offsets of arbitrary dimension. Assume you have a regular parametric representation of an n-dimensional surface, formula_112, where the dimension of formula_113 is n-1. Also assume you have a second n-dimensional surface that can be parameterized by its unit normal, formula_70, where the normal of formula_71 (this parameterization by normal exists for surfaces whose Gaussian curvature is strictly positive, and thus convex, smooth, and not flat). The parametric representation of the general offset surface of formula_116 offset by formula_70 is:

:formula_118 where formula_119 is the unit normal of formula_116. (The trival offset, formula_77, gives you ordinary parallel surfaces.)

First, notice that the normal of formula_122 the normal of formula_123 by definition. Now, we&#x27;ll apply the differential w.r.t. formula_113 to formula_62, which gives us its tangent vectors spanning its tangent plane.
:formula_126
Notice, the tangent vectors for formula_62 are the sum of tangent vectors for formula_116 and its offset formula_70, which share the same unit normal. Thus, the general offset surface shares the same tangent plane and normal with formula_116 and formula_131. That aligns with the nature of envelopes.

We now consider the Weingarten equations for the shape operator, which can be written as formula_132. If formula_61 is invertable, formula_134. Recall that the principal curvatures of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace. The inverse of the shape operator holds these same values for the radii of curvature.

Substituting into the equation for the differential of formula_62, we get:
:formula_136 where formula_104 is the shape operator for formula_131.

Next, we use the Weingarten equations again to replace formula_139:
:formula_140 where formula_61 is the shape operator for formula_116.

Then, we solve for formula_143 and multiple both sides by formula_144 to get back to the Weingarten equations, this time for formula_145:
:formula_146
:formula_147

Thus, formula_148, and inverting both sides gives us, formula_149.

<text>The Banque Canadienne Nationale (; ) was a Canadian bank that existed from 1873 to 1979. The bank was founded in Montreal in 1873 as the Banque d&#x27;Hochelaga and began operations the following year. In 1924, the bank renamed itself the Banque Canadienne Nationale after it took over the Banque nationale. In 1979, it merged with the Provincial Bank of Canada to form the National Bank of Canada.

==History==

In 1859, several prominent Quebecers founded the Banque Nationale in Quebec City as a banking institution controlled by French-speaking businessmen.

In 1924, the Banque Nationale, which was struggling financially while caught-up in a serious recession, merged with the Banque d&#x27;Hochelaga (founded in Montreal in 1874) to create the Banque Canadienne Nationale (BCN, Canadian National Bank). The Quebec provincial government, under Alexandre Taschereau, issued $15 million in bonds to facilitate the merger.

Like the other Canadian chartered banks, BCN issued its own paper currency until the Bank of Canada Act of 1934 created the Bank of Canada and it relinquished this right.

In 1968, Banque Canadienne Nationale was one of the four original banks to form CHARGEX Ltd. through a licence from BankAmericard, providing Canada with its first interbank credit card.

In 1979, Banque Canadienne Nationale and the Provincial Bank of Canada (Banque provinciale du Canada), another Quebec-based bank, joined to form the National Bank of Canada.

<text>The Home Bank of Canada was a Canadian bank that was incorporated July 10, 1903, in Toronto but did not receive a Treasury Board certificate to operate as a chartered bank until the next year.

It succeeded the earlier Toronto Savings Bank, which had been founded in 1854 by Bishop Armand-François-Marie de Charbonnel and the local chapter of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and later Home Savings and Loans in 1871. The failure of Home Bank on August 18, 1923, was the subject of a Canadian Royal Commission initiated by Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in 1924.

Founded with the support of the Roman Catholic Church, James Mason and Henry Pellatt represented a benign board of directors including E.G. Gooderham, Claude Macdonnell and three other directors from Winnipeg, Manitoba, affiliated with the United Grain Growers.

==Early controversies==

Early in its history a number of questionable loans were advanced, including one to A.C. Frost Company to buy timber rights in British Columbia, and another to the New Orleans Gouther and Grand Isle Railway secured by a rolling stock of dilapidated rail cars. In 1912 it undertook a campaign of expanding into Quebec and eastern Canada, to the chagrin of the western Canadian Directors who were seeing much of the bank&#x27;s capital unavailable for western loans. At the same time, many of the large loans went unpaid and the accrued interest, through a form of bank fraud, was recapitalized onto the principal of the loans.

William Machaffie, Manager of the Winnipeg Branch and a banker since 1882, told the western directors as early as 1914 that the &quot;cooking of the books&quot; through the adding of unpaid interest to the principal and then calculating the interest as profit to pay dividends to major shareholders and directors was wrong. Machaffie wanted to tell the minister of finance at the time, Thomas White, but the western directors were not so sure.

The federal government of the day was not prepared to deal with a bank crisis during wartime. After a leave of absence in 1917 Machaffie returned to his desk to find his position was gone. He wrote a letter to the Minister of Finance which outlined issues regarding bad loans, capitalization of unpaid interest, and accounting malpractice at head office, and stated the only hope for the bank&#x27;s survival was a merger. He decided not to send the letter to the minister but instead to the Board to &quot;stir things up a bit&quot;. He was fired. On August 29, 1918, he drafted a new letter and this time sent it to the Minister of Finance outlining his concerns and a litany of delinquent and non-arm&#x27;s length loans and issues related to serious flaws in the Home Bank&#x27;s internal auditing process.

==Collapse==

The post-war period brought prosperity and the inflationary boom gave Home Bank its share of the Canadian penchant for saving money. The bank opened 28 new branches (for a total of 82) between 1921 and 1923. Though this period, under greater government scrutiny and with the death of Senator James Mason in 1918, the new president of the bank, Herbert Daly was challenged to &quot;keep all the balls in the air at the same time&quot;.

On 17 August 1923 the bank&#x27;s main branch did not open and would remain closed indefinitely. The provincial and federal government appointed a liquidator, Geoffrey Teignmouth Clarkson of Clarkson Gordon to untangle the mess and seek recovery for the thousands of depositors who had lost millions of dollars in the collapse. Clarkson was highly experienced in liquidating banks, having served as liquidator in at least three prior. After thoroughly reviewing the affairs of the bank he wrote that “Never at any time in its career, was an experienced and trained banker at the head of the bank and in control of its affairs. It can be said that the [bank management] utterly failed to pay regard to or impose elementary safeguards in protection of the business of the bank.”
The major chartered banks intervened in 1920 to control rising prices by raising interest rates. Demand for credit fell and the resulting recession drove prices down dramatically, making assets worth less than the money loaned to acquire them. During this time, and with the dust storms of the 1922–1923 drought, many farmers lost their land and livelihood.

The indifference of the Eastern banking community led to the success of populist parties in Western Canada and Ontario. In 1922 the United Grain Growers, whose officers comprised the western bank board members, sold all of their shares in the bank. At the same time the Western Canada Pulp and Paper Company had defaulted and, in the spring of 1923 the bank asked Mackenzie King&#x27;s government for help, which was refused. The stock plummeted and depositors withdrew money in ever-swelling streams. On the August civic-holiday, J. Cooper Mason, son of the founder and a director, retired to his study and committed suicide.

The Canadian National Railway, whose director Richard F. Gough was also a member of the bank&#x27;s board, withdrew $1 million just before the collapse. The bank closed for good August 17, 1923. Ten officials from Home Bank were arrested on charges ranging from concurring with false returns to fraud on October 4, 1923, at a time when the bank&#x27;s assets were estimated at $2.7 million and liabilities at $15.5 million. 60,000 prairie farmers and a substantial portion of Toronto&#x27;s Catholic community lost their savings. In the panic that followed the bank&#x27;s closure, the Ontario Government shored up the Dominion Bank with $1.5 million to stop a deposit run. Herbert Daly, the Home Bank president, was unable to testify after a nervous breakdown and he died on October 22, 1923. However, liquidator GT Clarkson was extensively called to testify to better understand the situation. 

Cabinet secrecy rules protected politicians from any liability in the matter and, in a precedent setting bailout, the federal government agreed to pay $5,450,000 to depositors (deposit insurance was not enacted until 1967 in Canada), providing some settlement to the thousands who lost money as a result of the failure which, had the bank been liquidated or merged in 1916 or 1918 would have been without any loss to depositors.

<text>Double Arch is a close-set pair of natural arches in Arches National Park in southern Grand County, Utah, United States, that is one of the better known features of the park.

==Description==
Double Arch was formed differently from most of the arches in the park. It is what is known as a pothole arch, formed by water erosion from above rather than more typical erosion from the side. The larger opening has a span of and a height of . These dimensions give the arch the tallest opening and second-longest span in the park.

The area was used as a backdrop for the opening scene of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, in which the arches are briefly visible. However, the cave shown in the movie does not exist.

From the Double Arch parking area it is a round trip to the arches that may be wheelchair accessible, with assistance. No guardrails or fences prevent visitors from exploring directly beneath and through the arches.

<doc id="912847" wikidata="Q927604" url="?curid=912847" title="Bronkhorst">
<text>Bronkhorst is a city in the municipality of Bronckhorst, Gelderland, the Netherlands and, with only 157 inhabitants (2010), one of the smallest cities in the Netherlands (after Staverden, Eembrugge and Sint Anna ter Muiden).

== Early history ==
The early history of Bronkhorst is, as is common for Dutch towns, largely unknown. It is possible that in the 7th century farmers settled on and around the hill on which a castle would be built later. The hill formed a refuge amidst the low-lying, fertile clay in the area, which is close to the river IJssel.

=== Lords of Bronkhorst ===

Bronkhorst used to be a lordship. The earliest known lord of Bronkhorst was Gijsbert of Bronkhorst (1140), son of Adam of Bronkhorst, first mentioned in 1127. He and some of his descendants played an important role in the politics of the time. The last Bronkhorst, Joost, died in 1553, after which the domain fell to the widow of Georg of Limburg.

== Castle ==
In the Middle Ages, a castle was erected on the aforementioned hill. It is first mentioned in a 14th-century document.
It consisted of a keep and associated buildings and was surrounded by a thick wall and a wide moat. It was sieged several times, most notably in 1582, when after nine months Dutch troops captured the castle, which was occupied by the Spanish during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The castle changed hands many times, until its last owner, a merchant, had it demolished in 1828.

== Town ==
In a document dated 13 March 1482, Gijsbert VII granted city rights to the inhabitants of the village Bronkhorst, which was right next to the castle. Concretely this meant, among other things, that they were given limited self-government and were allowed to administer the law to some extent.

== Culture ==
Bronkhorst is known for its picturesque buildings, and housed a museum dedicated to Charles Dickens which also contained items purchased from the former Dickens museum at Eastgate House in Rochester, Kent.

<doc id="912851" wikidata="Q612989" url="?curid=912851" title="Seaside, Florida">
<text>Seaside is an unincorporated master-planned community on the Florida Panhandle in Walton County, between Panama City Beach and Destin. One of the first communities in America designed on the principles of New Urbanism, the town has become the topic of slide lectures in architectural schools and in housing-industry magazines, and is visited by design professionals from all over the United States. 

==History==
The community was first constructed in 1981.

The idea behind Seaside came in 1946, when the grandfather of future founder Robert S. Davis bought of land along the shore of Northwest Florida as a summer retreat for his family.

In 1978, Davis inherited the parcel from his grandfather, and aimed to transform it into an old-fashioned beach town, with traditional wood-framed cottages of the Florida Panhandle. Davis, his wife Daryl and, the architectural partners and Driehaus Prize winners, Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk of Duany Plater-Zyberk &amp; Company toured the south studying small towns as a basis for planning Seaside. The final plan was complete around 1985.

The town was used as the main filming location of the 1998 film &quot;The Truman Show&quot;.

==Location==

Seaside is located along County Road 30A immediately adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico. Via County Road 30A, Rosemary Beach is 8 mi (13 km) to the southeast, and Miramar Beach is 16 mi (26 km) to the northwest (via County Road 30A to US 98).

== Design ==
Seaside is one of three planned communities on Florida&#x27;s Gulf coast designed by Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk. The other two are Rosemary Beach and Alys Beach. The three are examples of a style of urban planning known as New Urbanism.
As Seaside is privately owned, no other municipal governments had planning jurisdiction over Seaside, and therefore the developers were able to write their own zoning codes.

Individual housing units in Seaside are required to be different from other buildings, with designs ranging from styles such as Victorian, New Classical, Modern, Postmodern, and Deconstructivism. Seaside includes buildings by architects such as Léon Krier, Robert A. M. Stern, Steven Holl, Machado and Silvetti Associates, Deborah Berke, Gordon Burns &amp; Associates, Thomas Christ, Walter Chatham, Daniel Solomon, Ronnie Holstead, Jeff Margaretten, Alex Gorlin, Aldo Rossi, Michael McDonough, Samuel Mockbee, David Mohney, Steve Badanes, Walker Candler, and David Coleman. Another Driehaus Prize winner, the architect Scott Merrill designed the Seaside Chapel, an interfaith chapel and local landmark.

Seaside has no private front lawns, and only native plants are used in front yards.

==Events==

During the Annual 30A Songwriters Festival, produced by the Cultural Arts Association of Walton County, singer-songwriters from all over the U.S. perform in venues along Scenic Highway 30A and at a few venues in Seaside itself.

The Seaside Half Marathon and 5K Race is held each year in March, and attracts runners from all across the U.S. This is quickly becoming one of the region&#x27;s premier running events. The 5K Run is limited to the first 800 people that register and the Half Marathon is limited to the first 2200 that register. The top three runners from each age group receive a prize, and every runner in the half marathon receives a medal upon completing the race. Participants are allowed to walk in either race.

The Seaside Central Square offers a variety of events including movie nights at the Central Square Cinema. Other events include the Seeing Red Wine Festival, a dance festival, a farmers market, and holiday events such as an annual production of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

==Organizations and institutions==

=== Escape to Create ===
Escape to Create aims to celebrate artists and serve the community through Multi-Disciplinary Artist Residencies, Visiting Artists and Scholars, Arts and Cultural Programs, and Educational outreach.

===Seaside Farmers Market===
On Saturday mornings the Seaside Farmers Market offers fresh local produce, dairy products, baked goods, and native plants. Demonstrations in cooking and gardening are also held on a regular basis.

===Repertory Theater===
The Repertory Theater (REP) was founded in the spring of 2001, and serves more than 25,000 people every year. 
The plays are performed by the only professional theater company on the Emerald Coast, and includes everything from family shows to sophisticated adult content shows. 
High school students who live in the area can intern at the Seaside Repertory Theater. The program is intended to teach practical knowledge by working with the staff and get to be in charge of their own production.

===SEASIDE Institute===

The SEASIDE Institute is a 501c3 non-profit organization located in Seaside, Florida. The organization hosts educational programs throughout the year centered around sustainability, connectivity, and adaptability.

===Seaside Neighborhood School===
In 1995 a group of parents and other community members from towns in Walton County, met and discussed how they could improve education within the county. Their discussions focused on making a densely populated school with grades five to eight. In 1996 Seaside Neighborhood School was established. It was Florida&#x27;s first charter school. The school initially consisted of 50 students and one classroom. In 1998, architect Richard Gibbs designed three white buildings which became the school&#x27;s site. In order to maintain the small enrollment of children that attend the school, a limited number of students are accepted into each grade. If enrollment exceeds the limit, students names are drawn randomly from a lottery. After the limit has been reached, they continue to pull out names which then creates a school year waiting list. If someone withdraws from the school then the first on the waiting list will be accepted. Children of employees, Board Members, or siblings of current attendees of the school are automatically admitted. In 2013, Seaside Neighborhood School founded a collegiate high school, called Seacoast Collegiate High School. In its inaugural year, it served 80 students in grades 9 and 10. Grade 11 was added in 2014 and grade 12 was added in the fall of 2015. In August 2014, Seaside Neighborhood School also introduced a fifth grade class.

<text>Herbert Reinecker (24 December 1914 – 27 January 2007) was a German novelist, dramatist and screenwriter.

==Career==
Born in Hagen, Westphalia, Reinecker began to write short stories already as a high school student. In 1936, he moved to Berlin, where he became editor-in-chief of a youth magazine, &quot;Jungvolk&quot;. In the same year, he also co-authored a book, &quot;Jugend in Waffen&quot; (&quot;Armed Youth&quot;). This was a time when the Nazis had already been in power for three years and when the media had long been &quot;nazified&quot;. In 1943, he joined the Nazi Party and worked as the editor-in-chief of a book entitled &quot;Der Pimpf&quot; about the training system of the Hitler Youth. Reinecker served in a propaganda company of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; during World War II.

In the early 1940s, Reinecker also wrote a number of plays, among them &quot;Das Dorf bei Odessa&quot;, and the novel &quot;Der Mann mit der Geige&quot;. In 1944, he wrote an award-winning screenplay, &quot;Junge Adler&quot; (&quot;Young Eagles&quot;).

After the war, he started working for radio and television. At the same time, he wrote screenplays for the series of German feature films of the 1960s that were loosely based on Edgar Wallace&#x27;s novels as well as TV adaptations of Francis Durbridge novels and plays.

In the late 1960s, Reinecker and producer Helmut Ringelmann wanted to create a truly German police detective. At first tentatively conceived as a &quot;German Maigret&quot;, Reinecker&#x27;s Kommissar Keller soon metamorphosed into a full-fledged character. Erik Ode was chosen to play Keller in the TV series, &quot;Der Kommissar&quot;, which was finally launched in 1969 and which became a huge success. In 1974, Reinecker and Ringelmann started a new, similar series, &quot;Derrick&quot; which was in production until 1998 with major international success.

==Personal life==
In 1938 Herbert Reinecker married Angela Schmikowski, with whom he had two children – daughter Rita (also a writer/author), 1941, and Hilmar (1944–2001). Divorced in 1954, he married Brunhilde (Holly) Schubert in 1959.

Reinecker is reported to have stopped writing due to macular degeneration. He was nearly blind when he died on 27 January 2007, aged 92.

<text>Frost Bank is an American bank based in San Antonio that is chartered in Texas, with 155 branches and 1,700 automated teller machines in the state. It is the primary subsidiary of Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., a bank holding company. It is one of the 60 largest banks of the country by total assets.

==History==
===Early years===
Frost Bank was founded in 1868 as a mercantile partnership in San Antonio by Thomas Claiborne Frost, who had served as a lieutenant colonel in the Confederate States Army. In February 1899, it was chartered as a national banking association. That year, the bank also reached $1 million in deposits (worth about $35 million in 2022 dollars). The bank survived the Panic of 1907 with the aid of an association of local banks and by 1921, sold shares to outside investors for the first time. Frost continued to grow with the construction of a 12-story building in 1921, which was one of the tallest buildings in Texas at the time. By 1926, Joseph Hardin Frost, brother of T.C. Frost Jr., took over as president of the company.

===Growth===
Over the years, Frost has grown both organically and through the acquisition of other banks, beginning in 1928 with the purchase of Lockwood National Bank. In 1977, the company merged with Cullen Bankers, Inc. of Houston forming Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc. and its stock began trading on the NASDAQ.

In 1982, Cullen/Frost Bankers and United States National Bancshares, Inc. (USNB) of Galveston, Texas merged, but Frost operated USNB separately for nearly two decades. As new financial services legislation allowed banks to broaden the services they offered customers, Cullen/Frost folded the USNB charter into Frost&#x27;s in 2000. With this action, the last bank using the federally forbidden &quot;United States National Bank&quot; title ceased to exist.

In 1983, the bank announced it intended to merge with First City Bancorp of Houston, Texas, however the merger was never completed. First City was subsequently rescued by the FDIC in 1988 and ultimately bankrupted in 1992 and was absorbed by other banks, primarily Texas Commerce Bank (now Chase).

In 1999, Frost Bank acquired Commerce Financial Corp. and Frost Insurance Agency, a subsidiary of the bank acquired Professional Insurance Agents Inc.

In 2005-2006, the company acquired Alamo Bank of Texas, Horizon Capital Bank, Summit Bancshares Inc., and Texas Community Bank. In 2014, it acquired Western National Bank.

===Industry changes===

During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the bank did not accept government assistance via the Troubled Asset Relief Program, but faced with changes in the financial services industry, the bank converted its 113-year-old federal charter into a state charter in June 2012.

<text>Kenneth Jon Barwise (; June 29, 1942 – March 5, 2000) was an American mathematician, philosopher and logician who proposed some fundamental revisions to the way that logic is understood and used.

==Education and career==
He was born in Independence, Missouri, to Kenneth T. and Evelyn Barwise.

A pupil of Solomon Feferman at Stanford University, Barwise started his research in infinitary logic. After positions as assistant professor at Yale University and the University of Wisconsin, during which time his interests turned to natural language, he returned to Stanford in 1983 to direct the Center for the Study of Language and Information (CSLI). He began teaching at Indiana University in 1990. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999.

In his last year, Barwise was invited to give the 2000 Gödel Lecture; he died prior to the lecture.

==Philosophical and logical work==

Barwise contended that, by being explicit about the context in which a proposition is made, the &quot;situation&quot;, many problems in the application of logic can be eliminated. He sought &quot;... to understand meaning and inference within a general theory of information, one that takes us outside the realm of sentences and relations between sentences of any language, natural or formal.&quot; In particular, he claimed that such an approach resolved the liar paradox. He made use of Peter Aczel&#x27;s non-well-founded set theory in understanding &quot;vicious circles&quot; of reasoning.

Barwise, along with his former colleague at Stanford John Etchemendy, was the author of the popular logic textbook &quot;Language, Proof and Logic&quot;. Unlike the &quot;Handbook of Mathematical Logic&quot;, which was a survey of the state of the art of mathematical logic circa 1975, and of which he was the editor, this work targeted elementary logic. The text is notable for including computer-aided homework problems, some of which provide visual representations of logical problems. During his time at Stanford, he was also the first Director of the Symbolic Systems Program, an interdepartmental degree program focusing on the relationships between cognition, language, logic, and computation. The K. Jon Barwise Award for Distinguished Contributions to the Symbolic Systems Program has been given periodically since 2001.

<text>Terborg is a small city in the Dutch province of Gelderland, in the Achterhoek region in the east of the Netherlands. It is located in the municipality of Oude IJsselstreek. The city lies about 7 km southeast of Doetinchem. The population is about 4600 inhabitants.

Terborg is situated on the river the Oude IJssel. In the centre of the little city lies Castle Wisch, founded in the 13th century (hence the name &quot;Terborg&quot; which means &quot;by the castle&quot;). In the southeast of the city, near Silvolde lies a small nature reserve called the Paasberg (&quot;Easter Mountain&quot;). Terborg has a train station on the train route Arnhem - Winterswijk, and trains call here twice every hour.

Terborg received city rights in 1419. The patron saint of the city is Saint George. Its coat of arms still is Saint George on a horse, killing a dragon.

Until 1813, Terborg was part of the fiefdom Wisch, together with the villages Silvolde en Varsseveld. Terborg was a separate municipality until 1818 when it was merged with Varsseveld into municipality Wisch (equal to the ancient fiefdom). In 2005 it formed municipality Oude IJsselstreek with municipality Gendringen.

In 1945, the town&#x27;s &quot;Chasdei Enosh&quot; synagogue was blown up and destroyed by Nazis. An exact replica of the historic building opened on 7 June 2018 in Mevo Horon Israel, inaugurated by Israeli descendants of Dutch Jews. The old synagogue, on the Silvoldeseweg, was built in 1901.

<text>Blokzijl is a small city located southwest of Steenwijk in the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands. The city is a major tourist destination near the De Weerribben-Wieden National Park and attracts many water sports enthusiasts.

Blokzijl was founded in the 1580s as a trading post for peat. After the Siege of Steenwijk (1580–81) in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, the Dutch built a fortified lock or in local dialect &quot;zijl&quot; or &quot;siel&quot;. The monumental houses around the picturesque harbour were built during 17th century. Blokzijl received city rights in 1672, but was stripped of them a few years later. Until 1973, it was a separate municipality, when it became a component of the new municipality Brederwiede; it is now part of Steenwijkerland.

One the interesting sights of the city is an old cannon, located on the harbour quay. This cannon was not used for defense purposes, but as a warning device during storm and high tide. Flooding was a real danger before the Noordoostpolder and the Afsluitdijk were constructed in the 1930-40&#x27;s. One residential building shows the height the water reached during a flood in 1825. In 1926, a fire destroyed part of the centre and damaged the church.

<doc id="912871" wikidata="Q519022" url="?curid=912871" title="False color">
<text>False colors and pseudo colors respectively refers to a group of color rendering methods used to display images in colors which were recorded in the visible or non-visible parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. A false-color image is an image that depicts an object in colors that differ from those a photograph (a true-color image) would show. In this image, colors have been assigned to three different wavelengths that human eyes cannot normally see.

In addition, variants of &quot;false colors&quot; such as pseudocolors, density slicing, and choropleths are used for information visualization of either data gathered by a single grayscale channel or data not depicting parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (e.g. elevation in relief maps or tissue types in magnetic resonance imaging).

== Types of color renderings ==
=== True color ===
The concept behind true color can help in understanding false color. An image is called a &quot;true-color&quot; image when it offers a natural color rendition, or when it comes close to it. This means that the colors of an object in an image appear to a human observer the same way as if this same observer were to directly view the object: A green tree appears green in the image, a red apple red, a blue sky blue, and so on. 

Absolute true-color rendering is impossible. There are three major sources of color error (metameric failure):
* Different spectral sensitivities of the human eye and of an image capture device (e.g. a camera).
* Different spectral emissions / reflections of the object and of the image render process (e.g. a printer or monitor).
* Differences in spectral irradiance in the case of reflective images (e.g. photo prints) or reflective objects – see color rendering index (CRI) for details.
The result of a metameric failure would be for example an image of a green tree which shows a different shade of green than the tree itself, a different shade of red for a red apple, a different shade of blue for the blue sky, and so on. Color management (e.g. with ICC profiles) can be used to mitigate this problem within the physical constraints.

Approximate true-color images gathered by spacecraft are an example where images have a certain amount of metameric failure, as the spectral bands of a spacecraft&#x27;s camera are chosen to gather information on the physical properties of the object under investigation, and are not chosen to capture true-color images.

=== False color ===

In contrast to a true-color image, a false-color image sacrifices natural color rendition in order to ease the detection of features that are not readily discernible otherwise – for example the use of near infrared for the detection of vegetation in satellite images. While a false-color image can be created using solely the visual spectrum (e.g. to accentuate color differences), typically some or all data used is from electromagnetic radiation (EM) outside the visual spectrum (e.g. infrared, ultraviolet or X-ray). The choice of spectral bands is governed by the physical properties of the object under investigation.

As the human eye uses three spectral bands (see trichromacy for details), three spectral bands are commonly combined into a false-color image. At least two spectral bands are needed for a false-color encoding, and it is possible to combine more bands into the three visual RGB bands – with the eye&#x27;s ability to discern three channels being the limiting factor. In contrast, a &quot;color&quot; image made from one spectral band, or an image made from data consisting of non-EM data (e.g. elevation, temperature, tissue type) is a &quot;pseudocolor image&quot; (see below).

For true color, the RGB channels (red &quot;R&quot;, green &quot;G&quot; and blue &quot;B&quot;) from the camera are mapped to the corresponding RGB channels of the image, yielding a &quot;RGB→RGB&quot; mapping. For false color this relationship is changed. The simplest false-color encoding is to take an RGB image in the visible spectrum, but map it differently, e.g. &quot;GBR→RGB&quot;. For traditional false-color satellite images of Earth a &quot;NRG→RGB&quot; mapping is used, with &quot;N&quot; being the near-infrared spectral band (and the blue spectral band being unused) – this yields the typical &quot;vegetation in red&quot; false-color images.

False color is used (among others) for satellite and space images: Examples are remote sensing satellites (e.g. Landsat, see example above), space telescopes (e.g. the Hubble Space Telescope) or space probes (e.g. &quot;Cassini-Huygens&quot;). Some spacecraft, with rovers (e.g. the Mars Science Laboratory &quot;Curiosity&quot;) being the most prominent examples, have the ability to capture approximate true-color images as well. Weather satellites produce, in contrast to the spacecraft mentioned previously, grayscale images from the visible or infrared spectrum.

False color has a range of scientific applications. Spacecraft often employ false-color methods to help understand the composition of structures in the universe such as nebula and galaxies. The frequency of light emitted by different ions in space are assigned contrasting colors, allowing the chemical composition of complex structures to be better separated and visualised. The image of the Eagle Nebula above is a typical example of this; the Hydrogen and Oxygen ions have been assigned green and blue respectively. The large amounts of green and blue in the image show that there is a large amount of Hydrogen and Oxygen in the nebula.

On 26 October 2004, the NASA/ESA Cassini-Huygens spacecraft captured a false-color image of Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon. The image was captured in Ultraviolet and Infrared wavelengths, both invisible to the human eye. In order to provide a visual representation, false color techniques were used. The infrared data was mapped to red and green colors, and ultraviolet mapped to blue.

===Pseudocolor===
A pseudocolor image (sometimes styled pseudo-color or pseudo color) is derived from a grayscale image by mapping each intensity value to a color according to a table or function. Pseudo color is typically used when a single channel of data is available (e.g. temperature, elevation, soil composition, tissue type, and so on), in contrast to false color which is commonly used to display three channels of data.

Pseudocoloring can make some details more visible, as the perceived difference in color space is bigger than between successive gray levels alone. On the other hand, the color mapping function should be chosen to make sure the lightness of the color is still monotonic, or the uneven change would make it hard to interpret levels, for both normal and colorblind viewers. One offender is the commonly-used &quot;rainbow&quot; palette, with a back-and-forth change in lightness. (See also .)

A typical example for the use of pseudo color is thermography (thermal imaging), where infrared cameras feature only one spectral band and show their grayscale images in pseudo color.
Another familiar example of pseudo color is the encoding of elevation using hypsometric tints in physical relief maps, where negative values (below sea level) are usually represented by shades of blue, and positive values by greens and browns.
Depending on the table or function used and the choice of data sources, pseudocoloring may increase the information contents of the original image, for example adding geographic information, combining information obtained from infrared or ultra-violet light, or other sources like MRI scans.

A further application of pseudocoloring is to store the results of image elaboration; that is, changing the colors in order to ease understanding an image.

===Density slicing===

Density slicing, a variation of pseudo color, divides an image into a few colored bands and is (among others) used in the analysis of remote sensing images. For density slicing the range of grayscale levels is divided into intervals, with each interval assigned to one of a few discrete colors – this is in contrast to pseudo color, which uses a continuous color scale. For example, in a grayscale thermal image the temperature values in the image can be split into bands of 2 °C, and each band represented by one color – as a result the temperature of one spot in the thermograph can be easier acquired by the user, because the discernible differences between the discrete colors are greater than those of images with continuous grayscale or continuous pseudo color.
===Choropleth===
A choropleth is an image or map in which areas are colored or patterned proportionally to the category or value of one or more variables being represented. The variables are mapped to a few colors; each area contributes one data point and receives one color from these selected colors. Basically, it is density slicing applied to a pseudocolor overlay. A choropleth map of a geographic area is thus an extreme form of false color.
==False color in the arts==
While artistic rendition lends to subjective expression of color, Andy Warhol (1928–1987) has become a culturally significant figure of the modern art movement by creating false-color paintings with screen printing techniques. Some of Warhol&#x27;s most recognizable prints include a replication of Marilyn Monroe, her image based on a film frame from the movie &quot;Niagara&quot;. The subject was a sex symbol and film noir starlet whose death in 1962 influenced the artist. A series of prints were made with endearment but expose her persona as an illusion through his assembly line style of art production which are non-erotic and slightly grotesque. Using various ink color palettes, Warhol immersed himself in a process of repetition that serves to compare personas and everyday objects to the qualities of mass production and consumerism. The colors of ink were selected through experimentation of aesthetics and do not correlate to false-color rendering of the electromagnetic spectrum employed in remote sensing image processing. For years the artist continued screen printing false-color images of Marilyn Monroe, perhaps his most referenced work being &quot;Turquoise Marilyn&quot; which was bought in May 2007 by a private collector for 80 million US dollars.

<text>Forgotten Freshness is a rarities album by American hip hop group Insane Clown Posse. Released in 1995, the album features unreleased and &quot;lost&quot; tracks that are harder to find elsewhere.

This album features some samples that were not cleared for national distribution; therefore, this album was only released in the Detroit area and the mid-west and in limited copies. In 1998, the group released &quot;Forgotten Freshness Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;. &quot;Ghetto Zone&quot;, &quot;Life At Risk&quot;, and &quot;Ask You Somethin&quot; were not featured on the re-release, with &quot;Ask You Somethin&quot; not appearing on any other release until the 2020 reissue of the Dog Beats EP. The edits of &quot;Southwest Strangla&quot; and &quot;3 Rings&quot; are also exclusive to this compilation, the former featuring an intro that would later become part of &quot;12&quot; from the Riddle Box album and the latter featuring an answering machine message. It is the group&#x27;s first installment in the &quot;Forgotten Freshness album series&quot;, their 1st compilation album, and their 6th overall release.

==Music and lyrics==
The song &quot;Southwest Strangla&quot; was planned to be released on Shaggy 2 Dope&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Shaggs The Clown&quot;, but the entire project was scrapped. In the beginning of the song, a news brief is played about the actual looting of Northwest Airlines Flight 255 which crashed on I-94 in Detroit in 1987. With a change in beat and lyrics, the song &quot;Hey, Vato&quot; became &quot;Wagon Wagon&quot; found on the &quot;Ringmaster&quot; album. Some lyrics from the song are also found on the song &quot;Who Asked You&quot;, also on the Ringmaster.

The song &quot;Fat Sweaty Betty&quot; was originally intended for &quot;Riddle Box&quot;. It was eventually given away as a single at the group&#x27;s two &quot;Mental Warp&quot; shows. &quot;Ask You Somethin&quot; is a cover of Clarence Carter&#x27;s song &quot;Strokin&quot; and was originally intended for Carnival of Carnage. The song &quot;3 Rings&quot; was later released on the album &quot;Riddle Box&quot; with slightly altered lyrics. &quot;Dead Pumpkins&quot; was the first Hallowicked single given away in 1994.

<text>The Imperial Bank of Canada was a Canadian bank that operated from 1873 to 1961. In 1961, Imperial merged with the Canadian Bank of Commerce to become the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

==History==

It was founded in 1873 as the Imperial Bank in Toronto by Henry Stark Howland, former vice president of the Canadian Bank of Commerce. The bank became the Imperial Bank of Canada in 1874.

In 1875, the president of the Imperial Bank of Canada was H.S. Howland, founder of the original Imperial Bank. The bank had a capital of $1,000,000 and the head office was located on Wellington Street in Toronto, Ontario.

The Imperial Bank of Canada branches expanded beyond Toronto and were found in St. Catharines, Ingersoll, Welland, Prince Albert, Saskatchewan and Port Colborne.

In 1875, it amalgamated with the Niagara District Bank, which had been chartered on May 19, 1855, in Montreal.

Although George Albertus Cox became the bank&#x27;s president in 1890, Howland stayed at the bank until his death in 1902. Cox remained president until 1906. Daniel Robert Wilkie succeeded Cox as president of the Imperial Bank of Canada and died as president in 1914.

The bank acquired Weyburn Security Bank in 1931 and Barclays Bank (Canada) in 1956.

It merged with the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1961 to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

<text>Harry Cohn (July 23, 1891 – February 27, 1958) was a co-founder, president, and production director of Columbia Pictures Corporation.

==Life and career==
Cohn was born to a working-class Jewish family in New York City. His father, Joseph Cohn, was a tailor from Germany, and his mother, Bella Joseph, was from the Pale of Settlement, Russian Empire. He left school early and had a variety of jobs, including chorus boy, fur salesman, pool hustler, shipping clerk, streetcar conductor and song plugger for a sheet music printer. He also appeared in a vaudeville act with Harry Ruby.

He entered the film industry when he got a job with Independent Moving Pictures (which had recently merged to become part of Universal Film Manufacturing Company), where his elder brother, Jack Cohn, was already employed. The brothers made their first film there, &quot;Traffic in Souls&quot;. Cohn became personal secretary to Universal president, Carl Laemmle.

In 1919, Cohn joined his brother and fellow IMP employee Joe Brandt, to found CBC Film Sales Corporation. The initials officially stood for Cohn, Brandt, and Cohn, but Hollywood wags noted the company&#x27;s low-budget, low-class efforts and nicknamed CBC &quot;Corned Beef and Cabbage.&quot; Harry Cohn managed the company&#x27;s film production in Hollywood, while his brother managed its finances from New York. The relationship between the two brothers was not always good, and Brandt, finding the partnership stressful, eventually sold his third of the company to Harry, who took over as president, by which time the firm had been renamed Columbia Pictures Corporation.
Most of Columbia&#x27;s early work was action fare starring rock-jawed leading man Jack Holt. Columbia was unable to shake off its stigma as a Poverty Row studio until 1934, when director Frank Capra&#x27;s Columbia comedy &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; swept the Academy Awards. Exhibitors who formerly wouldn&#x27;t touch Columbia products became steady customers. As a horizontally integrated company that only controlled production and distribution, Columbia had been at the mercy of theater owners. Columbia expanded its scope to offer moviegoers a regular program of economically made features, short subjects, serials, travelogues, sports reels, and cartoons. Columbia released a few &quot;class&quot; productions each year (&quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, &quot;Holiday&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;, &quot;The Jolson Story&quot;, &quot;Gilda&quot;, &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot;, etc.), but depended on its popular &quot;budget&quot; productions to keep the company solvent. During Cohn&#x27;s tenure, the studio always turned a profit.

Cohn did not build a stable of movie stars like other studios. Instead, he generally signed actors who usually worked for more expensive studios (Wheeler &amp; Woolsey, Cary Grant, Katharine Hepburn, Mae West, Humphrey Bogart, Dorothy Lamour, Mickey Rooney, Chester Morris, Warren William, Warner Baxter, Sabu, Gloria Jean, Margaret O&#x27;Brien, etc.) to attract a pre-sold audience. Columbia&#x27;s own stars generally rose from the ranks of small-part actors and featured players (Jean Arthur, Rita Hayworth, Larry Parks, Julie Bishop, Lloyd Bridges, Bruce Bennett, Jock Mahoney, etc.). Some of Columbia&#x27;s producers and directors also graduated from lesser positions as actors, writers, musicians, and assistant directors.

Cohn was known for his autocratic and intimidating management style. When he took over as Columbia&#x27;s president, he remained production chief as well, thus concentrating enormous power in his hands. He respected talent above any personal attribute, but he made sure his employees knew who was boss. Writer Ben Hecht referred to him as &quot;White Fang&quot;. An employee of Columbia called him &quot;as absolute a monarch as Hollywood ever knew.&quot; It was said &quot;he had listening devices on all sound stages and could tune in any conversation on the set, then boom in over a loudspeaker if he heard anything that displeased him.&quot; Throughout his tenure, his most popular moniker was &quot;King Cohn.&quot;

Moe Howard of the Three Stooges recalled that Cohn was &quot;a real Jekyll-and-Hyde-type guy... socially, he could be very charming.&quot; Cohn was known to scream and curse at actors and directors in his office all afternoon, and greet them cordially at a dinner party that evening. There is some suggestion that Cohn deliberately cultivated his reputation as a tyrant, either to motivate his employees or simply because it increased his control of the studio. Cohn is said to have kept a signed photograph of Benito Mussolini, whom he met in Italy in 1933, on his desk until the beginning of World War II. (Columbia produced the documentary &quot;Mussolini Speaks&quot; in 1933, narrated by Lowell Thomas.) Cohn also had a number of ties to organized crime. He had a long-standing friendship with Chicago mobster John Roselli, and New Jersey mob boss Abner Zwillman was the source of the loan that allowed Cohn to buy out his partner Brandt. Cohn&#x27;s brash, loud, intimidating style has become Hollywood legend and was reportedly portrayed in various movies. The characters played by Broderick Crawford in &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949) and &quot;Born Yesterday&quot; (1950), both Columbia pictures, are allegedly based on Cohn, as is Jack Woltz, a movie mogul who appears in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) as well as Rod Steiger in &quot;The Big Knife&quot;.

In his own way, Harry Cohn was sentimental about certain professional matters. During his early years as a producer he had signed comedian Billy West for a series of comedies, but failed to fulfill West&#x27;s contract; 12 years later, when West was a struggling bit player, Cohn not only kept him working as an actor but made him an assistant director, and then allowed Mr. and Mrs. West to operate the Columbia Grill, a restaurant concession on the studio premises. Cohn remembered the valuable contributions of Jack Holt during Columbia&#x27;s struggling years, and kept him under contract until 1941. Cohn hired the Three Stooges in 1934 and, according to Stooge Larry Fine, &quot;he thought we brought him luck.&quot; Cohn kept the Stooges on his payroll until the end of 1957. Cohn was fond of what he termed &quot;those lousy little &#x27;B&#x27; pictures&quot;, and kept making them, along with two-reel comedies and serials, after other studios had abandoned them.

Cohn could also hold grudges. He was responsible for the abrupt end to Hazel Scott&#x27;s film career after Scott protested the degrading costumes black women were scripted to wear on Mae West&#x27;s 1943 film &quot;The Heat&#x27;s On&quot;. Cohn eventually relented, but made good on his vow that Hazel Scott would never set foot on a Hollywood studio as long as he lived. After David Niven playfully sent Cohn a lawyer&#x27;s letter claiming Cohn&#x27;s yacht as salvage, Cohn failed to see the joke and barred Niven from the Columbia lot; Niven would be hired by Columbia only after Harry Cohn&#x27;s death. Cohn also resented Loretta Young having a dress redesigned expensively, which he regarded as overcharging him for her wardrobe, and wouldn&#x27;t speak to her for many years until she apologized to him in person.

==Personal life==
Cohn was married to Rose Barker from 1923 to 1941, and to actress Joan Perry (1911–1996) from July 1941 until his death in 1958.

His brothers all worked at Columbia. As well as co-founder Jack, the eldest brother Maxwell was a shorts subject producer and Nathan was the New York division manager. Cohn&#x27;s nephew, Ralph, one of Jack Cohn&#x27;s three sons, founded Screen Gems. Another of Jack&#x27;s sons, Robert, was also a Columbia executive. Maxwell&#x27;s daughter was Leonore &quot;Lee&quot; Cohn Annenberg, the wife of billionaire publishing magnate Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia.

===Sexual harassment allegations===
Various accounts have claimed that Cohn asked for and expected sex from female stars in exchange for employment. According to writer Joseph McBride, Jean Arthur quit the film industry when her Columbia Pictures&#x27; contract expired in 1944 because Cohn was known to harass actresses. When Joan Crawford was subjected to Cohn&#x27;s advances after signing a three-picture contract with Columbia, she quickly stopped him by saying &quot;Keep it in your pants, Harry. I&#x27;m having lunch with Joan [his wife] and the boys [his children] tomorrow.&quot;

Rita Hayworth&#x27;s relationship with Cohn was fraught with aggravation. Her biography, &quot;If This Was Happiness&quot;, describes how Cohn was angered when she refused his demands to have sex with him. However, he kept her under contract because she made him money. During these Columbia years, each did their best to irritate the other despite their successful working relationship. Cohn tried to groom Mary Castle as Hayworth&#x27;s successor.

===Accusations of mob connections===
Cohn has been accused of having ties with organized crime. In 1957, mobsters threatened Sammy Davis Jr. with violence because the performer was involved with actress Kim Novak, who was under contract with Columbia Pictures. There are several accounts of what happened, but most agree that the organized crime figures that threatened Davis were close to Cohn; according to these accounts, as Novak was white, Cohn was worried a backlash against the interracial relationship would hurt the studio. According to one account, Cohn called racketeer John Roselli, who was told to inform Davis that he must stop seeing Novak. To try to scare Davis, Roselli had him kidnapped for a few hours. Another account relates that the threat was conveyed to Davis&#x27;s father by mobster Mickey Cohen. Davis was threatened with the loss of his other eye or a broken leg if he did not marry a black woman within two days. Davis in turn sought the protection of Chicago mobster Sam Giancana, who said that he could protect him in Chicago and Las Vegas but not California.

Cohn was one of the influences (as well as Louis B. Mayer) for the character of studio boss Jack Woltz in the 1972 crime film &quot;The Godfather&quot;.

==Death==
Cohn had been suffering from an enlarged heart when he had a heart attack while flying back from New York in December 1957. He was told to slow down. In February 1958, he suffered another heart attack at the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix, Arizona, shortly after he had finished dinner. Cohn died in an ambulance en route to St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital.

Practically the entire Hollywood community attended Cohn&#x27;s extravagant funeral on stage 12 at the Columbia studios where Red Skelton made the famous (possibly apocryphal) quote: &quot;It proves what Harry always said: Give the public what they want and they&#x27;ll come out for it.&quot; Cohn is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood.

==Media portrayal==
Cohn was portrayed by Michael Lerner in the 1983 TV film &quot;Rita Hayworth: The Love Goddess&quot;, Linal Haft in &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; bio drama in 2000, and Eric Roberts in the 2018 film &quot;Frank &amp; Ava&quot;.

<text>The Dominion Bank was a Canadian bank that was chartered in 1869 and based in Toronto, Ontario. On February 1, 1955, it merged with the Bank of Toronto to form the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

==History==
The Dominion Bank&#x27;s charter received royal assent on 22 June 1869. In 1871, the Dominion Bank was launched by entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of James Austin with the opening of its first branch on King Street in Toronto, Ontario. They were dedicated to creating a new institution “conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country.” The Dominion Bank was a cautious institution, “selecting its customers carefully, serving them well, and duly prospering with them” (in the words of the official history). It too created a network of branches, and in 1872 became the first Canadian bank to have two branches in one city – Toronto.

With the maturing of the Canadian economy and the opening of northern Ontario and the West in 1880s and 1890s, the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries, utilities, and manufacturing. In 1897, the Dominion Bank opened its first western branch in Winnipeg. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the bank rapidly expanded their branch networks in central Canada and across the west.

To mark its rise as a significant national institution, the Dominion Bank moved to a landmark head office at King and Yonge Street in 1879.

The First World War brought new challenges for the bank when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public. Half the staff of the bank served in the armed forces.

Except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought, the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion. Both banks weathered the storm of Great Depression in the 1930s without great difficulty, despite a decline in earnings. Like all Canadian banks, they endured criticism of its credit policies and resisted the introduction of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy. Ultimately the Bank of Canada was established and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency.

The coming of the Second World War involved the banks, once again, in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange, rationing, and other financial war measures. Approximately 500 staff, or almost half the total, entered the armed forces.

The Dominion Bank emerged from the war in 1945 stronger than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom, they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. The bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place it in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the post-war economy.

==Amalgamation==
In 1954, negotiations began between the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank, and by the end of the year, an amalgamation agreement was reached. In their brief to the Minister of Finance, the banks stated: “It is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank, with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger banks.”

On November 1, 1954, Canada&#x27;s minister of finance announced that the amalgamation was accepted, and shareholders were asked for their approval. This was forthcoming in December, and on February 1, 1955, the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank became the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

<text>American State Bank was a financial service company operating 37 locations in 21 communities across Texas, mainly in West Texas.

American State Bank first opened on May 20, 1948, in Lubbock. American State Bank had unusual continuity of management - there were only three presidents since its inception. The first president, Jack Payne, had a term lasting from the banks first opening until 1974.

American State Bank did not accept any bailout funds from the federal government.

On February 27, 2012, Houston-based Prosperity Bancshares, the parent company of Prosperity Bank, announced that it had signed a merger agreement with ASB, whereby ASB will merge into Prosperity Bank subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. The merger became final effective July 1, 2012. Prosperity Bancshares ultimately paid over 500 million dollars, through a combination of cash and common stock, to acquire American State Bank.

<text>Canadian Commercial Bank (CCB) was a bank based in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, which failed in 1985. It received its parliamentary charter in 1975 and established its head office in Edmonton. The bank was privately owned and operated as a wholesale commercial bank.

==History==

The Canadian Commercial Bank officially began operations in July 1976, with CDN$22 million of capital. From 1976 to 1982, it operated profitably—usually in the top quartile of Canadian banking. It built a new headquarters in Edmonton, the Canadian Commercial Bank Tower in 1982.

In early 1985, after investing heavily in real estate and energy sector companies, the bank became insolvent during a period of rising interest rates and a falling Canadian dollar. The federal government arranged a $255 million bailout ($ billion today) in an effort to keep the failing institution afloat. In spite of this, the bank ceased operations on September 3, 1985. It was the largest bank failure in Canadian history and the first in Canada in 60 years, though followed shortly that year by the failure of the Northland Bank.

Following the failures, the government weathered calls for the resignation of the governor of the Central Bank, Gerald Bouey. The failures of both banks were the subject of a Commission of Inquiry headed by Supreme Court of Canada Justice Willard Estey, who issued his report in 1986.

<text>The Canadian Bank of Commerce was a Canadian bank that operated from 1867 to 1961. It merged in 1961 with the Imperial Bank of Canada to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, which today is one of Canada&#x27;s Big Five banks.

==History==

In 1866 a group of businessmen, including William McMaster, purchased a charter from the defunct Bank of Canada, which had folded in 1858. 
The Canadian Bank of Commerce was founded the following year, issued stock, and opened its headquarters in Toronto, Ontario.

The bank soon opened branches in London, St. Catharines and Barrie. During the following years, the bank opened more branches in Ontario, and took over the business of the local Gore Bank, before expanding across Canada through the acquisition of the Bank of British Columbia in 1901 and the Halifax Banking Company in 1903.

By 1907 the Canadian Bank of Commerce had 172 branches. By the beginning of World War II, this had expanded to 379 branches, including a large building by Darling and Pearson in Winnipeg, Manitoba, built in 1910 in beaux-arts classic style.

During World War I, 1,701 staff from the Canadian Bank of Commerce enlisted in the war effort. A memorial on the East and West Memorial Buildings in Ottawa, Ontario is dedicated to the memory of 1701 Men of the Canadian Bank of Commerce who served in the First World War A War Memorial at Commerce Court in Toronto, Ontario commemorates their service.

In 1931, the Toronto headquarters of the bank, designed by architects John Pearson and Frank Darling, was completed. At 34 stories, for many years it was the tallest building in the British Empire.

Once again, during World War II, 2,300 staff members enlisted in the armed forces.

The Canadian Bank of Commerce merged with the Imperial Bank of Canada in 1961 to form the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC), now one of the Big Five Canadian banks.

<doc id="912904" wikidata="Q356235" url="?curid=912904" title="Flow control valve">
<text>A flow control valve regulates the flow or pressure of a fluid. Control valves normally respond to signals generated by independent devices such as flow meters or temperature gauges.

==Operation==
Control valves are normally fitted with actuators and positioners. Pneumatically-actuated globe valves and diaphragm valves are widely used for control purposes in many industries, although quarter-turn types such as (modified) ball and butterfly valves are also used.

Control valves can also work with hydraulic actuators (also known as hydraulic pilots). These types of valves are also known as automatic control valves. The hydraulic actuators respond to changes of pressure or flow and will open or close the valve. Automatic control valves do not require an external power source, meaning that the fluid pressure is enough to open and close them.

Flow control valves, a type of automatic control valve, regulate fluid flow by maintaining a predetermined flow rate, independent of variations in system pressure. These valves achieve this using pressure-compensated mechanisms, which automatically adjust the valve opening to ensure a steady flow rate. Some designs incorporate a dual-chamber configuration that enhances regulation at lower pressures, improving stability in applications such as irrigation, industrial water systems, and municipal water distribution.

Additionally, pilot-operated flow control valves are used in more advanced systems to provide precise flow adjustments while optimizing energy efficiency. These configurations allow the valve to respond dynamically to changing conditions, ensuring efficient fluid management.

Automatic control valves include pressure reducing valves, flow control valves, back-pressure sustaining valves, altitude valves, and relief valves.

==Application==
Process plants consist of hundreds, or even thousands, of control loops all networked together to produce a product to be offered for sale. Each of these control loops is designed to keep some important process variable, such as pressure, flow, level, or temperature, within a required operating range to ensure the quality of the end product. Each loop receives and internally creates disturbances that detrimentally affect the process variable, and interaction from other loops in the network provides disturbances that influence the process variable.

To reduce the effect of these load disturbances, sensors and transmitters collect information about the process variable and its relationship to some desired set point. A controller then processes this information and decides what must be done to get the process variable back to where it should be after a load disturbance occurs. When all the measuring, comparing, and calculating are done, some type of final control element must implement the strategy selected by the controller. The most common final control element in the process control industries is the control valve. The control valve manipulates a flowing fluid, such as gas, steam, water, or chemical compounds, to compensate for the load disturbance and keep the regulated process variable as close as possible to the desired set point.

<doc id="912906" wikidata="Q4856191" url="?curid=912906" title="Bank of Toronto">
<text>The Bank of Toronto was a Canadian bank that was founded in 1855 by a group of grain dealers and flour millers. On February 1, 1955, it merged with the Dominion Bank to form the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Its first president was James Grant Chewett, whose support was sought by financier Thomas Clarkson.

==History==
In July 1856, the Bank of Toronto opened its offices at 78 Church Street, Toronto, with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches. Thomas Clarkson, a major participant in the growing Toronto commerce, served as one of the first directors from 1856 through to 1858, steering the Bank through the depression of 1857. In 1860, it opened its first branch outside of Ontario (then as Canada West), in Montreal, Canada East.

The Bank of Toronto established itself as an efficient, profitable, but essentially conservative bank through the 19th century. It maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in Canada. Growth was very slow and deliberate, with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres. Core customers remained farmers, merchants, and processors of farm products (millers, brewers, distillers).

With the maturing of the Canadian economy and the opening of northern Ontario and the West in the 1880s and 1890s, the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries, utilities, and manufacturing. In 1899, the Bank of Toronto opened a branch in the British Columbia mining town of Rossland. In the first decade of the twentieth century, the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central Canada and across the west.

To mark their rise as significant national institutions, the Bank of Toronto moved into a large new head office building at the corner of King and Bay Streets in Toronto in 1913.

World War I brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public. Half of the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces.
Except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought, the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion. The bank weathered the storm of depression in the 1930s without great difficulty, despite a decline in earnings. Like all Canadian banks, they endured criticism of its credit policies and resisted the introduction of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy. Ultimately the Bank of Canada was established and the banks relinquished their right to issue their own currency.

The coming of the Second World War involved the banks, once again, in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange, rationing, and other financial war measures. Approximately 500 staff, or almost half the total, entered the armed forces.

The Bank of Toronto emerged from the war in 1945 stronger than ever, with assets more than doubled since 1939. With the post-war boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets. However, they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize. Neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow, but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the post-war economy.

==Architecture==

The Bank of Toronto in Winnipeg, Manitoba erected in 1905-06 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto at 205 Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario built in 1905 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Building in Victoria, British Columbia built in 1951 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Building in Chaplin, Saskatchewan built in 1915 is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada. The Bank of Toronto Vault in Turtle Mountain, Manitoba, completed in 1919, is on the Registry of Historical Places of Canada.
Andrew Taylor designed the Bank of Toronto at St. James Street &amp; McGill Street, which was erected in 1893-94.

==Amalgamation==

In 1954, negotiations began between the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank, and by the end of the year, an amalgamation agreement was reached. In their brief to the Minister of Finance, the banks stated: &quot;It is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank, with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger banks.&quot;

On November 1, 1954, Canada&#x27;s minister of finance announced that the amalgamation was accepted and shareholders were asked for their approval. This was forthcoming in December and on February 1, 1955, the Bank of Toronto and the Dominion Bank became the Toronto-Dominion Bank.

The building at 78 Church Street was listed on the City of Toronto Heritage Property Inventory on August 14, 1991, in hopes of preserving some of its historical physical attributes.

<doc id="912908" wikidata="Q4856060" url="?curid=912908" title="Bank of British Columbia">
<text>Two Canadian banks have been named the Bank of British Columbia.

==The first bank: 1862–1901 ==
The first one was established by Royal Charter in 1862, with its head office in London. Between 1862 and 1871, it issued dollar banknotes. By 1885, branches operated in San Francisco, Portland (est. 1866), Victoria (est. 1862) and New Westminster (est. 1862). In 1889, a branch was established in Seattle. In 1901, it merged with the Canadian Bank of Commerce. At the time of the merger, branches existed in Vancouver (est. 1886), Victoria, Kamloops, Nanaimo, Nelson, New Westminster, Rossland, Sandon, San Francisco, Portland, and London.

===Banknotes===
There remains $48,797 in outstanding banknotes from the bank of British Columbia, in $1, $5, $10, $20 and $50 denominations. The bills were issued from 1863 to 1894 and in the 1970s they brought anywhere from $500 to $1,500 per bill on the collector&#x27;s market.

===Architecture===
In British Columbia, the Victoria branch was built in 1885 and was designated as a heritage site by the City of Victoria in 1975. The Vancouver branch was built in 1889 to 1891 and was added to Vancouver&#x27;s Community Heritage Register in 1986.

===Further reading===

==The second bank: 1966–1986==
The second bank was chartered in 1966 with headquarters in Vancouver and was the creation of W.A.C. Bennett, the Premier of British Columbia. Bennett, a businessman, wanted to end Central Canada&#x27;s control over the banking industry, which obliged all but the smaller loans for companies in British Columbia to receive authorization from head offices in either Montreal or Toronto.

In 1986, the bank had 1,410 employees, 41 branches in BC and Alberta, and offices in the Cayman Islands, the US, and Hong Kong. Assets in 1986 were CAD$2.7 billion, which put the bank 27th among banks and financial institutions in Canada. Revenue in 1986 was $324 million.

Following financial difficulties arising from the decline of the western oil economy, the collapses of Canadian Commercial Bank and Northland Bank had a serious impact on other institutions that depended on wholesale deposit funding. Like the many Trust Companies and Credit Union amalgamations in 1986, the Canadian government permitted the Hongkong Bank of Canada (HSBC) to rescue it.

<doc id="912912" wikidata="Q3301505" url="?curid=912912" title="Maurice Vellacott">
<text>Maurice Vellacott (born September 29, 1955) is a former Canadian politician from Saskatchewan. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1997 to 2015 as the member of Parliament (MP) for the riding of Saskatoon—Wanuskewin from 1997 to 2015 (prior to 2000, known simply as Wanuskewin), variously as a member of the Reform Party, the Canadian Alliance, and the Conservative Party. Vellacott was known as an outspoken social conservative, particularly in opposing same-sex marriage and abortion rights.

==Early life and career==
Vellacott was born in Wadena, Saskatchewan, and was raised in Quill Lake. He obtained a Bachelor&#x27;s degree from Briercrest College, a Christian educational institution located in Caronport, Saskatchewan, and later earned a Master of Divinity at the Canadian Theological Seminary (affiliated with the University of Regina) and a Doctor of Ministry from Trinity International University, which is an evangelical Christian university in Deerfield, Illinois. Before entering political life, he was a pastor and personal care worker at a nursing home in Rosthern, Saskatchewan. He joined the Reform Party of Canada in 1990.

Vellacott campaigned in the 1995 Saskatchewan provincial election as a Liberal and lost to New Democratic Party candidate Eric Cline in Saskatoon Mount Royal. He later argued that running as a Liberal was consistent with his political ideology, in that the provincial Liberal platform of 1995 contained several policies advocated by the Reform Party, which did not have provincial affiliates.

Vellacott was elected for Ward Two on the Saskatoon District Health Board in 1995, and served on the board for two years before his election to the House of Commons. He wrote an editorial piece about Canada&#x27;s health care system in 1996, defending the public model as far superior to the &quot;fragmented&quot; American system in combating administrative waste, but also arguing that the system was in need of renewal and an infusion of funds. Vellacott suggested that Saskatoon District Health could impose a surcharge on American health insurers for certain medical procedures given to American patients, &quot;and in the process make money to inject back into the public system for the people of Saskatchewan.&quot;

In early 1997, Vellacott opposed a request by Saskatoon&#x27;s Gay and Lesbian Health Services (GLHS) for health board funding. Gens Hellquist of GLHS had argued that homophobic intolerance was responsible for higher levels of depression in the LGBT community in relation to society as a whole, and that community-specific funding would address these and other concerns. Vellacott responded by suggesting that many homosexuals were inappropriately blaming their personal difficulties on homophobia.

Vellacott called for the removal of video lottery terminals from the city, blaming them for an increase in health costs related to gambling addiction. His motion for a plebiscite was defeated in May 1997.

Vellacott is a social and economic conservative. His community involvement has included the Canadian Club, Canadian Palliative Care, the Saskatchewan Pro-Life Association, the Saskatchewan Landlords Association, the Saskatchewan Taxpayers Federation, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, the Chamber of Commerce, the North Saskatoon Business Association and Toastmasters International. He is a founding Board Member of Real Choices Crisis Pregnancy Centre in Saskatoon. In Parliament, he was a member of the Reform Party&#x27;s Family Caucus and a co-chair of the non-partisan Parliamentary Pro-Life Caucus.

==Political career==
===Reform MP===
In early 1997, Vellacott defeated Sam Dyck and Fred Wesolowski to win the Reform Party&#x27;s nomination for the new Saskatoon-area electoral district of Wanuskewin. Dyck later ran as an independent candidate against Vellacott in the 1997 federal election, arguing that Vellacott would try to &quot;legislate morality&quot; if victorious. Vellacott was nonetheless elected, amid a general gain for Reform in Saskatchewan. The Liberal Party of Canada won a second consecutive majority government, and Vellacott served as a member of the Official Opposition.

Shortly after his election, Vellacott announced that he would introduce a private member&#x27;s bill to eliminate the national Court Challenges Program, which provides funding for groups that bring human rights cases before the Canadian courts. He argued that &quot;some zealots&quot; were &quot;using our important tax dollars&quot; for dubious ends via the program, and singled out an effort by Saskatoon resident Ailsa Watkinson to prohibit corporal punishment against children. Vellacott wrote an editorial piece in early 1998 describing Watkinson as a &quot;social engineer&quot; promoting an &quot;extremist agenda&quot;, and accusing Canada&#x27;s &quot;unelected judges&quot; of &quot;judicial imperialism&quot; in their interpretations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. A supporter of Watkinson responded that Vellacott&#x27;s piece was a &quot;mixture of invective and innuendo&quot;, and argued that his defence of corporal punishment was based on flawed logic.

Vellacott supported other socially conservative initiatives. In late 1998, he brought forward a &quot;conscience rights&quot; bill to prevent nurses and doctors from being forced to perform abortions. He wrote an editorial against same-sex marriage the following year, arguing that marriage should be restricted to heterosexual couples because of its traditional role in the procreation and nurturing of children. He wrote that &quot;homosexuals already have the right to marry, providing that -- like everybody else -- they marry someone of the opposite sex.&quot; He opposed granting spousal benefits for same-sex couples, describing supporters of the initiative as &quot;activist liberal judges and a small but aggressive homosexual lobby.&quot;

In 1999, he criticized the Saskatchewan government&#x27;s decision to force thirteen-year-old Tyrell Dueck into cancer treatment. Dueck&#x27;s parents objected to continued cancer treatment at the Saskatoon cancer centre on the grounds that it did not appear to be working and instead sought to access a more experimental treatment in Mexico. Vellacott supported parental discretion in such matters.

Vellacott also called for full compensation to Hepatitis C victims during his first term in Parliament, arguing that the government could overcome complicated legal issues around liability by issuing &quot;ex gratia&quot; payments.

Vellacott confirmed his support for Preston Manning&#x27;s leadership of the Reform Party in 1998, after two other Saskatchewan Reform MPs called for a leadership review. He originally voted against the 1999 United Alternative initiative which led to the creation of the Canadian Alliance, but later changed his mind and supported it. In March 2000, he became the first Reform MP to endorse Stockwell Day&#x27;s ultimately successful bid for the Canadian Alliance leadership. Vellacott said that he supported Day&#x27;s &quot;respect for life and his recognition of the family as the basic building block of society.&quot; He also defended the socially conservative Campaign Life Coalition during the campaign, after that organization was criticized for drawing attention to homosexual supporters of rival candidate Tom Long.

===Canadian Alliance MP===
Vellacott was re-elected by an increased majority in the 2000 election, as a candidate of the Canadian Alliance.

In January 2001, he argued that Governor General Adrienne Clarkson had abused her office by sending a &quot;best wishes&quot; message to a newly married same-sex couple in Toronto, Ontario. Clarkson&#x27;s office responded that the letter was a personal courtesy, and was not a political statement.

Stockwell Day&#x27;s leadership of the Canadian Alliance came under increased scrutiny in the summer of 2001, and several MPs called for his resignation. Vellacott remained a Day supporter, and described the critics as &quot;backstabbers, hijackers (and) guerrillas.&quot; Day resigned late in the year, and declared that he would campaign to succeed himself in the following leadership contest. Vellacott again supported his candidacy. Supporters of rival candidate Stephen Harper, who would go on to win the contest, criticized Vellacott for mailing out endorsements of Day through his constituency office at public expense.

Vellacott continued to support socially conservative causes as a Canadian Alliance MP, and was a vocal opponent of embryonic stem-cell research in 2002, although he supported adult stem cell research. In the same year, he mailed out a controversial pamphlet opposing the addition of sexual orientation as a protected category under Canada&#x27;s hate crimes legislation. Vellacott claimed the policy change &quot;substantially interferes with the right of religious and education leaders to communicate essential matters of faith.&quot;

Also in 2002, Vellacott was the only MP to speak against a parliamentary motion recognizing an Armenian genocide as having occurred in 1915. He was quoted as saying:

:What the Turks so strenuously object to is the Armenian activists&#x27; one-sided portrayal of the tragic events to the world community and labelling them as genocide, using, in some cases, distortion or exaggeration of facts to further their political agenda of obtaining money and land from Turkey. While doing so, Armenians ignore the death and massacre of more than twice as many Turks at the hands of the Armenian revolutionary bands and the Russians whom they were helping during the First World War.

His comments were commended by some Turkish Canadian groups, and criticized by some Armenian Canadians.

The Canadian Alliance merged with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003–04 to create the Conservative Party of Canada. Vellacott supported the merger, and endorsed Stephen Harper&#x27;s successful campaign for the new party&#x27;s leadership.

===Conservative MP===
Vellacott won the Conservative nomination for Saskatoon—Wanuskewin in early 2004, defeating former Progressive Conservative Nick Bakker with 85% support. He faced a difficult challenge in the 2004 federal election from Chris Axworthy, a former federal New Democratic Party (NDP) MP and provincial NDP cabinet minister now running for the Liberals. Vellacott was elected as the Liberals won a minority government nationally.

After the election, Vellacott called for the trial of Saskatoon police officers Ken Munson and Dan Hatchen to be reopened. Munson and Hatchen had been convicted of abandoning an Indigenous man near a power station during freezing weather. Vellacott said new evidence had been found, indicating that the officers dropped the man off within a short walking distance of where he told the officers he lived. He later established a defence fund for the officers. The case was not re-opened.

When the Saskatchewan judicial system approved same-sex marriages in 2004, Vellacott said it was &quot;unfortunate that the Saskatchewan court has followed in the activist footsteps of other courts in this country.&quot; He later argued that marriage commissioners should have &quot;conscience rights&quot; to refuse to marry same-sex couples. During a 2005 rally, he said, &quot;there is no such thing as a right to same-sex marriage.&quot;

Also in 2005, Vellacott called for legislation making it illegal to harm or kill the unborn children of mothers not planning to have abortions (such that killing a pregnant woman would constitute a double-murder). The suggestion won support from some, while others argued that it could eventually lead to restrictions on abortion.

When Belinda Stronach crossed the floor from the Conservatives to the Liberals in mid-2005, Vellacott suggested that she was prostituting herself for power and had &quot;sold out for a cabinet position.&quot; This was criticized as sexist, and Vellacott issued a &quot;statement of regret&quot; for his choice of words.

Vellacott was re-elected over Chris Axworthy a second time in the 2006 federal election, in a contest that was marked by extreme bitterness and controversy. During a live televised debate late in the campaign, a caller falsely suggested that Vellacott had been forced to leave North Park Church in Saskatoon after being accused of sexual assault on a church secretary. The call was subsequently traced to Axworthy&#x27;s campaign headquarters. Axworthy described the allegations as &quot;deplorable&quot;, and apologized to Vellacott for the situation. He denied that anyone in his office was put up to making the call, and suggested that a &quot;mischief-maker&quot; may have entered the office. Former long-term pastor Jerold Gliege indicated that Vellacott never served at or attended the church in question, which has been defunct since 1979. Vellacott&#x27;s campaign later produced an affidavit from Saskatchewan politician Tom Hengen, in which he &quot;to the best of [his] knowledge and belief&quot; named Axworthy campaign worker George Laliberte as the caller. Axworthy spoke to Laliberte and reported that he vehemently denied making the call. Vellacott&#x27;s lawyer later filed a defamation suit against Laliberte on March 22, 2006, in the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench in Saskatoon. Vellacott won the lawsuit and was awarded $5,000 in damages.

The national Conservative campaign accused the Liberals of a coverup and called for Axworthy to withdraw from the contest. Axworthy declined, denying that he was responsible for any wrongdoing. Vellacott was re-elected with an increased margin of victory.

===Government backbench===
The Conservatives won a minority government in the 2006 election, making Vellacott a government backbencher. In March 2006, he wrote an open letter supporting restrictions on abortion and calling for pregnant women to be informed of possible risks associated with abortion.

In April 2006, Vellacott attracted negative attention when he claimed that Indigenous people would travel to the outskirts of Saskatoon to drink in a shack around the same time that allegations surfaced that Saskatoon police were dropping off Indigenous people on &quot;moonlight riders.&quot; Vellacott would admit that he never saw the existence of a drinking shack.

He was appointed to serve as chairman of the Commons&#x27; Aboriginal Affairs Committee in April 2006. He attracted controversy one month later, after suggesting that Canadian judges consider themselves to have &quot;god-like powers&quot; when rendering their decisions. Vellacott claimed Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin said that &quot;when they step into this role [of supreme court justice] that suddenly there&#x27;s some kind of mystical power that comes over them, which everything that they&#x27;ve ever decreed is not to be questioned.&quot; McLachlin, through a spokesperson, denied having made that comment. Vellacott later issued an apology, indicating that he did not intend to imply McLachlin had actually used the phrase &quot;god-like powers.&quot; He added that he was alluding to comments made by McLachlin at a Lord Cooke Lecture, given on December 1, 2005, at the University of Victoria in Wellington, New Zealand. Journalists noted that the &quot;mystical power&quot; quote does not appear in McLachlin&#x27;s speech. Vellacott also informed reporters that he regarded judicial independence as a &quot;fundamental aspect of a free and democratic society.&quot;

Vellacott resigned from his role as committee chairman following significant opposition from other parties. He then served as a member of the House of Commons Standing Committee on the Environment, and called for the Canadian government to intervene against state-sponsored violence in the Darfur province of Sudan.

During his time in parliament, Vellacott served as deputy critic for health, Human Resources Development Canada, and Indian Affairs. He had involvement with several organizations, including the Canadian Club and the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, and supported Focus on the Family. He received the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002, the Commemorative Medal for the Centennial of Saskatchewan in March 2006 and a Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012; all were automatic by virtue of being an elected Member of Parliament.

Vellacott was re-elected in 2008 and 2011.

In 2013, Vellacott introduced Bill C-560, an Act to Amend the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; and make shared parenting for children with separated parents the default outcome in courts, barring extraordinary circumstances. The bill was defeated at second reading.

Vellacott decided not to run for re-election in the 2015 federal election. After Stephen Harper&#x27;s resignation as Conservative leader, Vellacott endorsed Saskatoon MP Brad Trost for the 2017 Conservative Party of Canada leadership election. Vellacott identified Trost as a champion of social conservatism and warned Conservative members against supporting eventual winner Andrew Scheer.

==Controversies==
In 2012, Vellacott nominated and awarded Queen&#x27;s Jubilee medals to Linda Gibbons and Mary Wagner, who had both been convicted of criminal offences related to their anti-abortion activism. Gibbons was arrested for repeated violations of injunctions against protesting in front of women&#x27;s health clinics. Mary Wagner was serving time in jail for mischief and violating court orders regarding women&#x27;s health clinics when she received her medal. When asked to comment on his decision to recognize these two women, Vellacott released a statement that referred to them as &quot;heroines of humanity&quot;, and justified his decision by stating: &quot;It&#x27;s a pretty upside down world when we honour abortionists like Henry Morgentaler for killing over 5,000 babies and imprison precious women, like Mary Wagner and Linda Gibbons, who try to save babies from such savagery. They are the real heroes of humanity!&quot; Vellacott&#x27;s decision to bestow the Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal on Gibbon and Wagner has been praised by pro-life groups such as the Campaign Life Coalition and the &quot;Catholic Register&quot;. Interim Liberal leader Bob Rae criticized Vellacott&#x27;s statements as inciting anti-abortion activists to break the law, which is itself a criminal offence in Canada.

In 2022, Vellacott was named as one of at least three Saskatoon politicians for whom students at the local Legacy Christian Academy school (then Christian Centre Academy) were coerced into campaigning, along with former mayor Don Atchison and sitting City Council member Randy Donauer. This was revealed as former students of the school launched a class action lawsuit against former staff of the school and affiliated church for child abuse. Vellacott confirmed that students worked on his campaigns but denied that they were coerced into doing so. He stated that such work &quot;was a good education for them,&quot; and that he found it &quot;quite invigorating, exhilarating because there were so many young people involved.&quot;

<doc id="912923" wikidata="Q279793" url="?curid=912923" title="DiSEqC">
<text>DiSEqC (; short for Digital Satellite Equipment Control) is a special communication protocol for use between a satellite receiver and a device such as a multi-dish switch or a small dish antenna rotor. DiSEqC was developed by European satellite provider Eutelsat, which now acts as the standards agency for the protocol.

==History==
Eutelsat apparently developed the system to allow satellite users in Continental Europe to switch between the more popular SES Astra satellites at 19.2° east and Eutelsat&#x27;s own Hot Bird system at 13° east. As a result, the vast majority of European satellite receivers support DiSEqC 1.0 or higher, with the exception of all set top boxes manufactured under the Sky Digibox name. All supporting receivers have received certification to carry a logo specifying which variation of DiSEqC they support.

==Protocol==
DiSEqC relies only upon a coaxial cable to transmit both bidirectional data/signals and power. DiSEqC is commonly used to control switches and motors, and is more flexible than 13/18 Volt and 22 kHz tone or ToneBurst/MiniDiSEqC techniques. DiSEqC is also compatible with the actuators used to rotate large C band dishes if used with a DiSEqC positioner. DiSEqC uses a pulsed (tone-burst) 22 kHz sine-wave at 0.65 V (± 0.25 V) peak to peak.

The &quot;Di&quot; (digital) part of the name refers to the digital nature of the signals used by the protocol and does not imply anything about the transmission that the dish is used to receive; DiSEqC may be used with both digital and analogue satellite systems.

==Versions and compatibility==
A number of versions of DiSEqC exist:
* DiSEqC 1.0, which allows switching between up to 4 satellite sources
* DiSEqC 1.1, which allows switching between up to 16 sources
* DiSEqC 1.2, which allows switching between up to 16 sources, and control of a single axis satellite motor
* DiSEqC 2.0, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.0
* DiSEqC 2.1, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.1
* DiSEqC 2.2, which adds bi-directional communications to DiSEqC 1.2
* DiSEqC 3.0, which adds remote management of receivers to DiSEqC 2.2 to enable broadcast house uses 

First four variations were standardized by February 1998, prior to general use of digital satellite television. The later versions are backwards compatible with the lower revisions, but the lower revisions are, as might be expected, not forwards compatible with the higher revision numbers. 1.x and 2.x versions are both backwards and forwards compatible.

The terms DiSEqC 1.3 and 2.3 are also often used by manufacturers and retailers to refer to the use of DiSEqC with other protocols. For example, 1.3 usually refers to a receiver which uses USALS in conjunction with the DiSEqC 1.2 protocol. Such terminology has not been authorised by Eutelsat.

The following table shows compatibility between the various DiSEqC versions:

NOTE: a 1.x receiver will not be able to receive communication from a switch or motor. Usually this is not important, as the switch or motor can be controlled by the receiver without problems.

<text>A sensor array is a group of sensors, usually deployed in a certain geometry pattern, used for collecting and processing electromagnetic or acoustic signals. The advantage of using a sensor array over using a single sensor lies in the fact that an array adds new dimensions to the observation, helping to estimate more parameters and improve the estimation performance.
For example an array of radio antenna elements used for beamforming can increase antenna gain in the direction of the signal while decreasing the gain in other directions, i.e., increasing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by amplifying the signal coherently. Another example of sensor array application is to estimate the direction of arrival of impinging electromagnetic waves. 
The related processing method is called array signal processing. A third examples includes chemical sensor arrays, which utilize multiple chemical sensors for fingerprint detection in complex mixtures or sensing environments. Application examples of array signal processing include radar/sonar, wireless communications, seismology, machine condition monitoring, astronomical observations fault diagnosis, etc.

Using array signal processing, the temporal and spatial properties (or parameters) of the impinging signals interfered by noise and hidden in the data collected by the sensor array can be estimated and revealed. This is known as parameter estimation.

== Plane wave, time domain beamforming ==
Figure 1 illustrates a six-element uniform linear array (ULA). In this example, the sensor array is assumed to be in the far-field of a signal source so that it can be treated as planar wave.

Parameter estimation takes advantage of the fact that the distance from the source to each antenna in the array is different, which means that the input data at each antenna will be phase-shifted replicas of each other. Eq. (1) shows the calculation for the extra time it takes to reach each antenna in the array relative to the first one, where &quot;c&quot; is the velocity of the wave.

formula_1

Each sensor is associated with a different delay. The delays are small but not trivial. In frequency domain, they are displayed as phase shift among the signals received by the sensors. The delays are closely related to the incident angle and the geometry of the sensor array. Given the geometry of the array, the delays or phase differences can be used to estimate the incident angle. Eq. (1) is the mathematical basis behind array signal processing. Simply summing the signals received by the sensors and calculating the mean value give the result

formula_2 .

Because the received signals are out of phase, this mean value does not give an enhanced signal compared with the original source. Heuristically, if we can find delays of each of the received signals and remove them prior to the summation, the mean value

formula_3

will result in an enhanced signal. The process of time-shifting signals using a well selected set of delays for each channel of the sensor array so that the signal is added constructively is called beamforming.
In addition to the delay-and-sum approach described above, a number of spectral based (non-parametric) approaches and parametric approaches exist which improve various performance metrics. These beamforming algorithms are briefly described as follows

== Array design ==
Sensor arrays have different geometrical designs, including linear, circular, planar, cylindrical and spherical arrays. There are sensor arrays with arbitrary array configuration, which require more complex signal processing techniques for parameter estimation. In uniform linear array (ULA) the phase of the incoming signal formula_4 should be limited to formula_5 to avoid grating waves. It means that for angle of arrival formula_6 in the interval formula_7 sensor spacing should be smaller than half the wavelength formula_8. However, the width of the main beam, i.e., the resolution or directivity of the array, is determined by the length of the array compared to the wavelength. In order to have a decent directional resolution the length of the array should be several times larger than the radio wavelength.

== Types of sensor arrays ==

=== Antenna array ===
*Antenna array (electromagnetic), a geometrical arrangement of antenna elements with a deliberate relationship between their currents, forming a single antenna usually to achieve a desired radiation pattern
*Directional array, an antenna array optimized for directionality 
*Phased array, An antenna array where the phase shifts (and amplitudes) applied to the elements are modified electronically, typically in order to steer the antenna system&#x27;s directional pattern, without the use of moving parts
*Smart antenna, a phased array in which a signal processor computes phase shifts to optimize reception and/or transmission to a receiver on the fly, such as is performed by cellular telephone towers
*Digital antenna array, this is smart antenna with multi channels &quot;digital beamforming&quot;, usually by using FFT.
*Interferometric array of radio telescopes or optical telescopes, used to achieve high resolution through interferometric correlation
*Watson-Watt / Adcock antenna array, using the Watson-Watt technique whereby two Adcock antenna pairs are used to perform an amplitude comparison on the incoming signal

=== Acoustic arrays ===
*Microphone array is used in acoustic measurement and beamforming
*Loudspeaker array is used in acoustic measurement and beamforming

=== Other arrays ===
*Geophone array used in Reflection seismology
*Sonar array is an array of hydrophones used in underwater imaging
*Image sensors for digital cameras

== Delay-and-sum beamforming ==

If a time delay is added to the recorded signal from each microphone that is equal and opposite of the delay caused by the additional travel time, it will result in signals that are perfectly in-phase with each other. Summing these in-phase signals will result in constructive interference that will amplify the SNR by the number of antennas in the array. This is known as delay-and-sum beamforming. For direction of arrival (DOA) estimation, one can iteratively test time delays for all possible directions. If the guess is wrong, the signal will be interfered destructively, resulting in a diminished output signal, but the correct guess will result in the signal amplification described above.

The problem is, before the incident angle is estimated, how could it be possible to know the time delay that is &#x27;equal&#x27; and opposite of the delay caused by the extra travel time? It is impossible. The solution is to try a series of angles formula_9 at sufficiently high resolution, and calculate the resulting mean output signal of the array using Eq. (3). The trial angle that maximizes the mean output is an estimation of DOA given by the delay-and-sum beamformer.
Adding an opposite delay to the input signals is equivalent to rotating the sensor array physically. Therefore, it is also known as beam steering.

== Spectrum-based beamforming ==

Delay and sum beamforming is a time domain approach. It is simple to implement, but it may poorly estimate direction of arrival (DOA). The solution to this is a frequency domain approach. The Fourier transform transforms the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. This converts the time delay between adjacent sensors into a phase shift. Thus, the array output vector at any time &quot;t&quot; can be denoted as formula_10, where formula_11 stands for the signal received by the first sensor. Frequency domain beamforming algorithms use the spatial covariance matrix, represented by formula_12. This &quot;M&quot; by &quot;M&quot; matrix carries the spatial and spectral information of the incoming signals. Assuming zero-mean Gaussian white noise, the basic model of the spatial covariance matrix is given by

formula_13

where formula_14 is the variance of the white noise, formula_15 is the identity matrix and formula_16 is the array manifold vector formula_17 with formula_18. This model is of central importance in frequency domain beamforming algorithms.

Some spectrum-based beamforming approaches are listed below.

=== Conventional (Bartlett) beamformer ===

The Bartlett beamformer is a natural extension of conventional spectral analysis (spectrogram) to the sensor array. Its spectral power is represented by

formula_19.

The angle that maximizes this power is an estimation of the angle of arrival.

=== MVDR (Capon) beamformer ===

The Minimum Variance Distortionless Response beamformer, also known as the Capon beamforming algorithm, has a power given by

formula_20.

Though the MVDR/Capon beamformer can achieve better resolution than the conventional (Bartlett) approach, this algorithm has higher complexity due to the full-rank matrix inversion. Technical advances in GPU computing have begun to narrow this gap and make real-time Capon beamforming possible.

=== MUSIC beamformer ===

MUSIC (MUltiple SIgnal Classification) beamforming algorithm starts with decomposing the covariance matrix as given by Eq. (4) for both the signal part and the noise part. The eigen-decomposition is represented by

formula_21.

MUSIC uses the noise sub-space of the spatial covariance matrix in the denominator of the Capon algorithm

formula_22.

Therefore MUSIC beamformer is also known as subspace beamformer. Compared to the Capon beamformer, it gives much better DOA estimation.

=== SAMV beamformer ===

SAMV beamforming algorithm is a sparse signal reconstruction based algorithm which explicitly exploits the time invariant statistical characteristic of the covariance matrix. It achieves superresolution and robust to highly correlated signals.

== Parametric beamformers ==

One of the major advantages of the spectrum based beamformers is a lower computational complexity, but they may not give accurate DOA estimation if the signals are correlated or coherent. An alternative approach are parametric beamformers, also known as maximum likelihood (ML) beamformers. One example of a maximum likelihood method commonly used in engineering is the least squares method. In the least square approach, a quadratic penalty function is used. To get the minimum value (or least squared error) of the quadratic penalty function (or objective function), take its derivative (which is linear), let it equal zero and solve a system of linear equations.

In ML beamformers the quadratic penalty function is used to the spatial covariance matrix and the signal model. One example of ML beamformer penalty function is

formula_23 ,

where formula_24 is the Frobenius norm. It can be seen in Eq. (4) that the penalty function of Eq. (9) is minimized by approximating the signal model to the sample covariance matrix as accurate as possible. In other words, the maximum likelihood beamformer is to find the DOA formula_6, the independent variable of matrix formula_26, so that the penalty function in Eq. (9) is minimized. In practice, the penalty function may look different, depending on the signal and noise model. For this reason, there are two major categories of maximum likelihood beamformers: Deterministic ML beamformers and stochastic ML beamformers, corresponding to a deterministic and a stochastic model, respectively.

Another idea to change the former penalty equation is the consideration of simplifying the minimization by differentiation of the penalty function. In order to simplify the optimization algorithm, logarithmic operations and the probability density function (PDF) of the observations may be used in some ML beamformers.

The optimizing problem is solved by finding the roots of the derivative of the penalty function after equating it with zero. Because the equation is non-linear a numerical searching approach such as Newton–Raphson method is usually employed. The Newton–Raphson method is an iterative root search method with the iteration

formula_27.

The search starts from an initial guess formula_28. If the Newton-Raphson search method is employed to minimize the beamforming penalty function, the resulting beamformer is called Newton ML beamformer. Several well-known ML beamformers are described below without providing further details due to the complexity of the expressions.

;Deterministic maximum likelihood beamformer
:In deterministic maximum likelihood beamformer (DML), the noise is modeled as a stationary Gaussian white random processes while the signal waveform as deterministic (but arbitrary) and unknown.

;Stochastic maximum likelihood beamformer
:In stochastic maximum likelihood beamformer (SML), the noise is modeled as stationary Gaussian white random processes (the same as in DML) whereas the signal waveform as Gaussian random processes.

;Method of direction estimation
:Method of direction estimation (MODE) is subspace maximum likelihood beamformer, just as MUSIC, is the subspace spectral based beamformer. Subspace ML beamforming is obtained by eigen-decomposition of the sample covariance matrix.

<text>Westwoud is a village in the Netherlands. It is located in the region of West Friesland in North Holland, about 4 kilometers northeast of Hoorn. The town is part of the municipality of Drechterland and has a population of 1,785.

Westwoud received city rights in 1414, along with the villages of Westerblokker and Oosterblokker. This mainly meant it could form its own judicial district, which was abolished in 1811. It was a separate municipality between 1817 and 1979, when it merged with Hoogkarspel and Oosterblokker to form the municipality Bangert, which was changed to Drechterland in 1980.

<doc id="912933" wikidata="Q414496" url="?curid=912933" title="Phytoestrogen">
<text>A phytoestrogen is a plant-derived xenoestrogen (a type of estrogen produced by organisms other than humans) not generated within the endocrine system, but consumed by eating plants or manufactured foods. Also called a &quot;dietary estrogen&quot;, it is a diverse group of naturally occurring nonsteroidal plant compounds that, because of its structural similarity to estradiol (17-β-estradiol), have the ability to cause estrogenic or antiestrogenic effects. Phytoestrogens are not essential nutrients because their absence from the diet does not cause a disease, nor are they known to participate in any normal biological function. Common foods containing phytoestrogens are soy protein, beans, oats, barley, rice, coffee, apples, carrots (see Food Sources section below for bigger list).

Its name comes from the Greek &quot;phyto&quot; (&quot;plant&quot;) and &quot;estrogen&quot;, the hormone which gives fertility to female mammals. The word &quot;estrus&quot; (Greek οίστρος) means &quot;sexual desire&quot;, and &quot;gene&quot; (Greek γόνο) is &quot;to generate&quot;. It has been hypothesized that plants use a phytoestrogen as part of their natural defense against the overpopulation of herbivore animals by controlling female fertility.

The similarities, at molecular level, of an estrogen and a phytoestrogen allow them to mildly mimic and sometimes act as an antagonist of estrogen. Phytoestrogens were first observed in 1926, but it was unknown if they could have any effect in human or animal metabolism. In the 1940s and early 1950s, it was noticed that some pastures of subterranean clover and red clover (phytoestrogen-rich plants) had adverse effects on the fecundity of grazing sheep.

== Structure ==

Phytoestrogens mainly belong to a large group of substituted natural phenolic compounds: the coumestans, prenylflavonoids and isoflavones are three of the most active in estrogenic effects in this class. The best-researched are isoflavones, which are commonly found in soy and red clover. Lignans have also been identified as phytoestrogens, although they are not flavonoids. Mycoestrogens have similar structures and effects, but are not components of plants; these are mold metabolites of &quot;Fusarium&quot;, especially common on cereal grains, but also occurring elsewhere, e.g. on various forages. Although mycoestrogens are rarely taken into account in discussions about phytoestrogens, these are the compounds that initially generated the interest on the topic.

== Mechanism of action ==
Phytoestrogens exert their effects primarily through binding to estrogen receptors (ER). There are two variants of the estrogen receptor, alpha (ER-α) and beta (ER-β) and many phytoestrogens display somewhat higher affinity for ER-β compared to ER-α.

The key structural elements that enable phytoestrogens to bind with high affinity to estrogen receptors and display estradiol-like effects are:
* The phenolic ring that is indispensable for binding to estrogen receptor
* The ring of isoflavones mimicking a ring of estrogens at the receptors binding site
* Low molecular weight similar to estrogens (MW=272)
* Distance between two hydroxyl groups at the isoflavones nucleus similar to that occurring in estradiol
* Optimal hydroxylation pattern

In addition to interaction with ERs, phytoestrogens may also modulate the concentration of endogenous estrogens by binding or inactivating some enzymes, and may affect the bioavailability of sex hormones by depressing or stimulating the synthesis of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).

Emerging evidence shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which is higher than the activation level of ERs. At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (&gt;1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of genistein are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.

== Ecology ==

Phytoestrogens are involved in the synthesis of antifungal benzofurans and phytoalexins, such as medicarpin (common in legumes), and sesquiterpenes, such as capsidiol in tobacco. Soybeans naturally produce isoflavones, and are therefore a dietary source for isoflavones.

Phytoestrogens are ancient naturally occurring substances, and as dietary phytochemicals they are considered to have coevolved with mammals. In the human diet, phytoestrogens are not the only source of exogenous estrogens. Xenoestrogens (novel, man-made), are found as food additives and ingredients, and also in cosmetics, plastics, and insecticides. Environmentally, they have similar effects as phytoestrogens, making it difficult to clearly separate the action of these two kind of agents in studies.

==Avian studies==
The consumption of plants with unusual content of phytoestrogens, under drought conditions, has been shown to decrease fertility in quail. Parrot food as available in nature has shown only weak estrogenic activity. Studies have been conducted on screening methods for environmental estrogens present in manufactured supplementary food, with the purpose of aiding reproduction of endangered species.

According to one study of nine common phytoestrogens in a Western diet, foods with the highest relative phytoestrogen content were nuts and oilseeds, followed by soy products, cereals and breads, legumes, meat products, and other processed foods that may contain soy, vegetables, fruits, alcoholic, and nonalcoholic beverages. Flax seed and other oilseeds contained the highest total phytoestrogen content, followed by soybeans and tofu. The highest concentrations of isoflavones are found in soybeans and soybean products followed by legumes, whereas lignans are the primary source of phytoestrogens found in nuts and oilseeds (e.g. flax) and also found in cereals, legumes, fruits and vegetables. Phytoestrogen content varies in different foods, and may vary significantly within the same group of foods (e.g. soy beverages, tofu) depending on processing mechanisms and type of soybean used. Legumes (in particular soybeans), whole grain cereals, and some seeds are high in phytoestrogens.

A more comprehensive list of foods known to contain phytoestrogens includes:

* Soybeans and soy products
* Tempeh
* Linseed (flax)
* Sesame seeds
* Wheat berries
* Fenugreek (contains diosgenin, but also used to make Testofen, a compound taken by men to increase testosterone)
* Oats
* Barley
* Beans
* Lentils
* Yams
* Rice
* Alfalfa
* Mung beans
* Apples
* Carrots
* Pomegranates
* Wheat germ
* Rice bran
* Lupin
* Kudzu
* Coffee
* Licorice root
* Mint
* Ginseng
* Hops
* Bourbon whiskey
* Beer
* Fennel
* Anise
* Red clover (sometimes a constituent of green manure)
* Spinach
* Lavender.
Food content of phytoestrogens is very variable and accurate estimates of intake are therefore difficult and depends on the databases used. Data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition found intakes between 1 mg/d in Mediterranean Countries and more than 20 mg/d in the United Kingdom. The high intake in the UK is partly explained by the use of soy in the Chorleywood bread process. A 2001 epidemiological study of women in the United States found that the dietary intake of phytoestrogens in healthy post-menopausal Caucasian women is less than one milligram daily.

== Effects on humans ==
In humans, phytoestrogens are digested in the small intestine, poorly absorbed into the circulatory system, circulate in plasma, and are excreted in the urine. Metabolic influence is different from that of grazing animals due to the differences between ruminant versus monogastric digestive systems.

As of 2020, there is insufficient clinical evidence to determine that phytoestrogens have effects in humans.

=== Females ===

It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on the cause or prevention of cancer in women. Some epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect against breast cancer. Additionally, other epidemiological studies found that consumption of soy estrogens is safe for patients with breast cancer, and that it may decrease mortality and recurrence rates. It remains unclear if phytoestrogens can minimize some of the deleterious effects of low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism) resulting from oophorectomy, menopause, or other causes. A Cochrane review of the use of phytoestrogens to relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause (hot flashes) stated that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any benefit to their use, although genistein effects should be further investigated.

=== Males ===

It is unclear if phytoestrogens have any effect on male physiology, with conflicting results about the potential effects of isoflavones originating from soy. Some studies showed that isoflavone supplementation had a positive effect on sperm concentration, count, or motility, and increased ejaculate volume. Sperm count decline and increasing rate of testicular cancers in the West may be linked to a higher presence of isoflavone phytoestrogens in the diet while in utero, but such a link has not been definitively proven. Furthermore, while there is some evidence that phytoestrogens may affect male fertility, more recent reviews of available studies found no link, and instead suggests that healthier diets such as the Mediterranean diet might have a positive effect on male fertility. Neither isoflavones nor soy have been shown to affect male reproductive hormones in healthy individuals.

=== Infant formula ===

Some studies have found that some concentrations of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells. At low doses, genistein acted as a weak estrogen and stimulated cell growth; at high doses, it inhibited proliferation and altered cell cycle dynamics. This biphasic response correlates with how genistein is thought to exert its effects.
Some reviews express the opinion that more research is needed to answer the question of what effect phytoestrogens may have on infants, but their authors did not find any adverse effects. Studies conclude there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula compared to conventional cow-milk formula. The American Academy of Pediatrics states: &quot;although isolated soy protein-based formulas may be used to provide nutrition for normal growth and development, there are few indications for their use in place of cow milk-based formula. These indications include (a) for infants with galactosemia and hereditary lactase deficiency (rare) and (b) in situations in which a vegetarian diet is preferred.&quot;

==Ethnopharmacology==

In some countries, phytoestrogenic plants have been used for centuries in the treatment of menstrual and menopausal problems, as well as for fertility problems. Plants used that have been shown to contain phytoestrogens include &quot;Pueraria mirifica&quot; and its close relative kudzu, Angelica, fennel, and anise.
In a rigorous study, the use of one such source of phytoestrogen, red clover, has been shown to be safe, but ineffective in relieving menopausal symptoms (black cohosh is also used for menopausal symptoms, but does not contain phytoestrogens).

<text>Irving Caesar (born Isidor Keiser, July 4, 1895 – December 17, 1996) was an American lyricist and theater composer who wrote lyrics for numerous song standards, including &quot;Swanee&quot;, &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;m Happy&quot;, &quot;Crazy Rhythm&quot;, and &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, one of the most frequently recorded tunes ever written. In 1972, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.

==Biography==
Caesar, the son of Morris Keiser, a Romanian Jewish lawyer and socialist, was born in New York City, United States. His older brother Arthur Caesar was a successful Hollywood screenwriter. Around 1901, Caesar composed his first poem—which can be ascribed to his exposure to literature in the environment of his father&#x27;s bookstore. The Caesar brothers spent their childhood and teen years in Yorkville, the same Manhattan neighborhood where the Marx Brothers were raised. Caesar knew the Marx Brothers during his childhood. He was educated at Chappaqua Mountain Institute in Chappaqua, New York.

In his career, Caesar collaborated with a wide variety of composers and songwriters, including Rudolf Friml, George Gershwin, Sigmund Romberg, Victor Herbert, Ted Koehler and Ray Henderson. Two of his best known numbers, &quot;I Want to Be Happy&quot; and &quot;Tea for Two&quot;, were written with Vincent Youmans for the 1925 musical &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;. Another of his biggest hits, &quot;Animal Crackers in My Soup&quot;, was popularized by Shirley Temple in her 1935 film &quot;Curly Top.&quot; &quot;Just a Gigolo&quot;, his 1929 adaptation of an Austrian song, was a hit for Louis Prima in the 1950s and again for David Lee Roth in the 1980s.

In the late 1930s, along with composer Gerald Marks, he wrote a famous series of children&#x27;s songs focusing on safety. Caesar made hundreds of appearances in schools performing the &quot;Sing a Song of Safety,&quot; &quot;Sing a Song of Friendship&quot; (a United Nations-inspired series focusing on world peace, racial tolerance and friendship) and &quot;Songs of Health&quot; collections.

Caesar served on the songwriters&#x27; performance-rights organization ASCAP board of directors from 1930 to 1946 and again from 1949 to 1966. He was a founder of the Songwriters Guild of America. He died, aged 101, in New York on December 18, 1996, at which point he had been married to Christina Ballestros—a caretaker of his—for two years.

<doc id="912957" wikidata="Q2735908" url="?curid=912957" title="Philippine, Netherlands">
<text>Philippine is a small city in the province of Zeeland, the Netherlands. It lies about southeast of Vlissingen. It is located on the border with Belgium, southwest of the city of Terneuzen. It received city rights in 1506.

== History ==
The landlord, Hieronymus Lauweryn, who founded the town in 1505, named it after Philip I. A fortress was built with a triangular market square. In 1599, a harbour was constructed, and the economy became based on fishing. Philippine was captured by the Dutch Republic in 1633.

The new Assumption of Mary Church was built in 1924 to replace the older church, which has now become a supermarket. It is a domed church with a square tower on the side. The church was destroyed during World War II in 1944 and rebuilt in 1954.

Philippine has gained some renown for its mussel restaurants. In the village square, there is a fountain in the shape of a mussel. It became the centre of the mussel fishing after 1939 due to the influx of fishermen from the Belgian village whose river started to silt.

Philippine was a separate municipality until 1970 when it was merged with Sas van Gent. In 2003, it became part of the municipality of Terneuzen.

<doc id="912959" wikidata="Q5506545" url="?curid=912959" title="Fry's Electronics">
<text>Fry&#x27;s Electronics was an American big-box store chain. It was headquartered in San Jose, California, in Silicon Valley. Fry&#x27;s retailed software, consumer electronics, household appliances, cosmetics, tools, toys, accessories, magazines, technical books, snack foods, electronic components, and computer hardware, in addition to offering in-store computer repair and custom computer building services.

Fry&#x27;s began with one store in Sunnyvale, California, and expanded to 34 stores in nine states at its peak in 2019.

On February 24, 2021, Fry&#x27;s announced the immediate and permanent closure of all of its stores. A statement posted on its website cited &quot;changes in the retail industry and the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic&quot;.

==History==


In 1972, Charles Fry sold the Fry&#x27;s Supermarkets chain based in California for US$14 million to Dillons. He gave a portion of the proceeds, around $1 million, to each of his sons, John (who had worked as the IT manager for the supermarket chain), W. Randolph (who goes by the nickname &quot;Randy&quot;), and David, none of whom had much interest in grocery store retailing. Instead, on May 17, 1985, they joined together with a fourth partner, John&#x27;s former girlfriend Kathryn Kolder, to open the first Fry&#x27;s Electronics store at a site in Sunnyvale, California. Today, Fry&#x27;s Food and Drug stores are owned and operated by Kroger, and are not affiliated with Fry&#x27;s Electronics, although they have similar logos.

John&#x27;s idea was to use the model of grocery retailing, with which the brothers were familiar, to sell computer and electronics supplies. The original Sunnyvale store (located near the intersection of Oakmead Parkway and Lakeside Drive) stocked numerous high-tech supplies such as integrated circuits, test and measurement equipment, and computer components, as well as software and various other types of consumer electronics. The store was one of the few retail outlets in the country that sold off-the-shelf microprocessors, such as the Intel 80286. The store also sold T-shirts, technical books, potato chips, and magazines, including &quot;Playboy&quot;. At first, roughly half the store was stocked with groceries, including fresh produce, but the groceries section quickly diminished to displays of soft drinks and snack foods. The store billed itself as &quot;The One-Stop Shop for the Silicon Valley Professional&quot;, as one could buy both electronics and groceries (computer chips and potato chips) at the same time. Most components from most OEMs were available for purchase.

As the business expanded, the original Sunnyvale store closed, and a newer, larger store was opened across Lawrence Expressway on Kern Avenue. The second Sunnyvale store was designed to look like the interior of a giant computer; the walls were adorned with simulated circuit components, and the floor resembled a giant printed circuit board. The exterior was painted to mimic a huge DIP integrated circuit, and the door handles imitated the ENTER and ESC keys on a computer keyboard; since 2005, this store has housed a Sports Basement store (which still bore some of the door-handle keys until sometime between 2009 and 2013). Fry&#x27;s moved again to its final Sunnyvale location at 1077 E Arques Ave, the former site of a facility of the Link Flight Simulation Division of the Singer Corporation. Each of the three Sunnyvale store locations was located within of the others.

Because Fry&#x27;s stores were enormous, stocking a wide range of each product category, they were popular with electronics and computer hobbyists and professionals. One of the few stores to challenge Fry&#x27;s in all dimensions (production selection and store-wide themes) was Incredible Universe, a series of Tandy (Radio Shack) superstores, which were established in 1992, bought out, and converted into Fry&#x27;s in 1996. Historically, Circuit City and CompUSA were major competitors in the computer space, but they collapsed during the late-2000s recession, leaving Micro Center and Newegg as Fry&#x27;s main competitors.

In August 2014, Fry&#x27;s Electronics operated 34 brick-and-mortar stores in 9 U.S. states: California (17), Texas (8), Arizona (2), Georgia (2), and one each in Illinois, Indiana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington.

In August 2019, Fry&#x27;s announced that it would close its oldest extant location in Palo Alto, by January 2020; the company said its lease at the location would not be renewed. On September 10, 2019, &quot;The Mercury News&quot; reported that customers were finding barren shelves in most stores, speculating that the chain was about to fold; Fry&#x27;s responded by stating the company was changing to a consignment model with its vendors and was not planning to close any store other than Palo Alto. However, on January 7, 2020, &quot;The Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; reported that the Fry&#x27;s location in Duluth, Georgia, was shuttered without advance notice during the 2019 holiday season. On February 25, 2020, Fry&#x27;s announced that they would close their Anaheim location by March 2, 2020. On November 10, 2020, Fry&#x27;s closed its Campbell location permanently without notice.

===Closure===

On the evening of February 23, 2021, several internet sources began claiming employees were given notice that all remaining stores would close to the public nationwide, with the Frys.com website scheduled to go offline at 12:00 am PST. The company deleted its Facebook page, and set the company Twitter account to protected, hiding all activity. Bay Area broadcaster KRON-TV confirmed the closure later that evening.

The Fry&#x27;s website closed in the early hours of February 24, only showing a letter informing of its closure. According to the letter, the company would implement the shutdown through an orderly wind-down process that it believed would be in the best interests of the company, its creditors, and other stakeholders to maximize the value of the company&#x27;s assets for its creditors and other stakeholders. The company said those waiting for repairs will be notified how to claim their equipment.

Fry&#x27;s officially entered general assignment on April 2, 2021, and began to liquidate all remaining assets, including owned real estate with Hilco Global.

==Criticism==
In 1997, &quot;Forbes&quot; reported on a series of issues about Fry&#x27;s customer service and unorthodox business practices. Among the allegations was that the company had an internal policy, identified as &quot;the double H&quot; or &quot;hoops and hurdles&quot;, to delay or prevent customers from obtaining refunds.

In 1998, &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot; reported that many customers had become frustrated with poor customer service at Fry&#x27;s stores.

In 2003, actors Denzel Washington, Bruce Willis, and California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger sued Fry&#x27;s for $10 million each for posting their images on television sets on their print ads and flyers without permission.

On Black Friday 2007, customers at the Renton, Washington location complained that Fry&#x27;s employees were offering to let people cut in front of a long line for a fee. After complaints in the media, Fry&#x27;s management offered anyone who paid the fee their money back.

In 2008, the Federal Communications Commission found Fry&#x27;s failed to place the required &quot;analog-only tuner&quot; consumer-alert label on analog televisions, fining them $384,000 (~$ in ).

In 2008, Fry&#x27;s vice president of merchandising and operations, Ausaf Umar Siddiqui, was charged by federal prosecutors in a kickback scheme involving Fry&#x27;s vendors, fueling sales with mail-in rebates. The alleged scheme was designed to defraud the company. Siddiqui used the funds to (among other things) feed his gambling habit in Las Vegas, where he lost about $162 million.

In September 2012, Fry&#x27;s Electronics agreed to pay $2.3 million (~$ in ), and to implement preventive measures, to settle a sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit brought by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The settlement was in relation to allegations that an assistant store manager at the Renton store harassed a 20-year-old sales associate by frequently sending her sexually charged text messages and inviting her to his house to drink. After her direct supervisor reported the harassment to Fry&#x27;s legal department, the company allegedly fired the female salesperson and fired her supervisor for standing up for her.

In 2017, a store in Webster, Texas made headlines when a manager set up a display to demonstrate indoor grow lights for sale and used realistic looking but ultimately fake marijuana plants. This was considered unacceptable by the local community considering marijuana was illegal in the state of Texas.

In 2019, rumors about the chain folding spread rapidly, mainly because shelves were empty for long periods of time and stores seemed to emphasize makeup and fragrances over electronics. Fry&#x27;s responded by stating they were simply switching to a consignment model, not closing down entirely. From when Fry&#x27;s put out this statement until early 2021, four additional stores closed (three were in California, and one in Duluth, Georgia), which further led many to believe that the company would soon go out of business.

==Online sales operation==
Fry&#x27;s Electronics was late in establishing an online sales presence. They began offering low-cost Internet access in 2000 through their original website &quot;Frys.com&quot;. The company later bought e-commerce site Cyberian Outpost in November 2001, and started online sales with a different URL (Outpost.com), which confused customers who did not associate the online name with the brick-and-mortar store. For a time in the mid-2000s, the website identified itself as &quot;Fry&#x27;s Electronics Outpost.com&quot;, using dual branding in an attempt to create a connection in visitors&#x27; minds. In October 2006, a grand reopening of Frys.com introduced the online store with the same name as the retail outlets. The outpost.com URL later began redirecting to the Fry&#x27;s online store.

==Domain name acquisitions==
In 1997, David Peter (or David Peter Burlini), who manufactured and sold French fry vending machines under the business name &quot;Frenchy Frys&quot;, owned the domain name &quot;frys.com&quot;, and was also involved in another dispute over the domain &quot;newricochet.com&quot; with Ricochet Networks. David Burlini attended Santa Clara University around the same time that the Fry Brothers were attending. Fry&#x27;s Electronics brought suit against him that year, alleging trademark infringement, and ultimately prevailed in a default judgment.

Fry&#x27;s Electronics aggressively tried to defend its trademark and domain names. In 2001, it threatened to sue Garret Maki for scanning and posting the company&#x27;s print ads on the internet using the domain &quot;frysad.com&quot;. In 2007, Fry&#x27;s Electronics lost a domain dispute against Prophet Partners Inc., an online advertising company with thousands of generic and descriptive domain names. The arbitrator dismissed the complaint, which requested transfer of the &quot;Frys.us&quot; domain, ruling that Fry&#x27;s Electronics did not have any more right to use the &quot;Fry&#x27;s&quot; mark than other entities with a similar surname or commercial use of the word.

==Store themes==
Various Fry&#x27;s locations were decorated in elaborate themes. For example, the Burbank store, which opened in 1995, carried a theme of 1950s and 1970s science-fiction movies, and featured huge statues of popular characters such as the robot Gort from &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and Darth Vader from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; movie series. In addition, giant ants (from the movie &quot;Them!&quot;) hung from the ceiling, and the bodies of 1957 Chevys and Buicks served as dining tables in the cafe. A flying saucer protruded above the entrance.

Since Fry&#x27;s acquired seven stores from the Incredible Universe chain of stores, the company had reduced the elaborateness of its themes. With the opening of the store in Fishers, Indiana, Fry&#x27;s made a &quot;race track&quot; theme with various hanging displays, including &quot;stop&quot; and &quot;go&quot; signs, as well as many photos of what life looked like in the late 1800s and early 1900s in Indianapolis.

Of the chain&#x27;s 34 stores, 30 of them closed on February 24, 2021. Four stores were closed earlier:
* The Duluth location closed on December 3, 2019.
* The Palo Alto location closed on December 27, 2019.
* The Anaheim location closed on March 2, 2020.
* The Campbell location closed on November 10, 2020.

==In media==
Fry&#x27;s Electronics is prominently featured in the 2022 film &quot;Nope&quot;, which filmed at the Burbank location following its closure.

The Phoenix, Arizona location is also featured in Season 2, Episode 12 of &quot;Mr. Robot&quot;.

<text>Womanism is a feminist movement, primarily championed by Black feminists, originating in the work of African American author Alice Walker in her 1983 book &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens&quot;. Walker coined the term &quot;womanist&quot; in the short story &quot;Coming Apart&quot; in 1979. Her initial use of the term evolved to envelop a spectrum of issues and perspectives facing black women and others. Walker defined &quot;womanism&quot; as embracing the courage, audacity, and self-assured demeanor of Black women, alongside their love for other women, themselves, and all of humanity. Since its inception by Walker, womanism has expanded to encompass various domains, giving rise to concepts such as Africana womanism and womanist theology or spirituality.

Womanism can be applied as a social theory based on the history and everyday experiences of Black women. According to womanist scholar Layli Maparyan (Phillips), womanist theory seeks to &quot;restore the balance between people and the environment/nature and reconcil[e] human life with the spiritual dimension.&quot;

== Theory ==
Womanist theory, while diverse, holds at its core that mainstream feminism is a movement led by white women to serve white women&#x27;s goals and can often be indifferent to, or even in opposition to, the needs of Black women. Feminism does not inherently render white women non-racist, while womanism places anti-racism at its core. Both the empowerment of women and the upholding of Black cultural values are seen as important to Black women&#x27;s existence. In this view, the very definition of &quot;the feminine&quot; and &quot;femininity&quot; must be re-examined and contextualized. While third-wave feminism shares this concern with the more recently coined term, intersectionality, the two concepts differ in the valuation they place on intersectionality within their respective theoretical frameworks. Womanism supports the idea that the culture of the woman, which in this case is the focal point of intersection as opposed to class or some other characteristic, is not an element of her identity but rather is the lens through which her identity exists. As such, a woman&#x27;s Blackness is not a component of her feminism. Instead, her Blackness is the lens through which she understands her feminist/womanist identity.

Womanist theory grew in large part out of the perceived indifference of the feminist movement towards the concerns of Black women. Early feminist activism around suffrage (first-wave feminism) in the United States largely excluded non-white women, as non-white women were not seen as feminine/female in the same ways as white women and therefore did not merit full inclusion.

The rise of second-wave feminism brought greater inclusivity of non-white women within the movement. However, white feminists equated this inclusion with &quot;colorblindness&quot; and preferred to deemphasize racial issues in favor of focusing exclusively on gender concerns. An inability to reconcile this division ultimately hampered the ability of white and non-white feminists to create a functional interracial movement. As a result of this disconnect between the groups, a third-wave feminism began that incorporated the concepts of intersectionality and womanism.

The historic exclusion of Black women from the broader feminist movement has resulted in two interpretations of womanism. Some womanists believe that the experience of Black women will not be validated by feminists to be equal to the experience of white women because of the problematic way in which some feminists treated Blackness throughout history. As such, womanists do not see womanism as an extension of feminism, but rather as a theoretical framework which exists independent of feminist theory. This is a departure from the thinking of Black feminists who have carved their own space in feminism through academia and activism.

However, not all womanists hold this view of womanism as distinct from feminism. The earliest conception of womanism is expressed in Alice Walker&#x27;s statement &quot;womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender&quot;. Under this rubric, the theories appear intimately tied, with womanism as the broad umbrella under which feminism falls.

==Phases of the theory==
===Womanist (1979)===
Author and poet Alice Walker first used the term &quot;womanist&quot; in her short story &quot;Coming Apart&quot;, in 1979, and later in&quot; In Search of our Mothers&#x27; Gardens: Womanist Prose&quot; (1983). Walker defined a &quot;womanist&quot; as a Black feminist or feminist of color. The term comes from the Black folk expression of mothers to female children, &#x27;You acting womanish&#x27;, referring to grown-up behavior. The womanish girl exhibits willful, courageous, and outrageous behavior that is considered to be beyond the scope of societal norms. She goes on to say that a womanist is also:

According to Walker, while feminism is incorporated into womanism, it is also instinctively pro-humankind; womanism is a broader category that includes feminism as a subtype. The focus of the theory is not on gender inequality, but race- and class-based oppression. She sees womanism as a theory/movement for the survival of the Black race; a theory that takes into consideration the experiences of Black women, Black culture, Black myths, spiritual life, and orality. Walker&#x27;s much cited phrase, &quot;womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender&quot;, suggests that feminism is a component beneath the much larger ideological umbrella of womanism.

Walker&#x27;s definition also holds that womanists are universalists. This philosophy is further invoked by her metaphor of a garden where all flowers bloom equally. A womanist is committed to the survival of both males and females and desires a world where men and women can coexist, while maintaining their cultural distinctiveness. This inclusion of men provides Black women with an opportunity to address gender oppression without directly attacking men.

A third definition provided by Walker pertains to the sexuality of the women portrayed in her review of &quot;Gifts of Power: The Writings of Rebecca Jackson&quot;. Here, she argues that the best term to describe Rebecca Jackson, a Black Shaker who leaves her husband and goes on to live with her white Shaker companion, would be a womanist, because it is a word that affirms the connection to the world, regardless of sexuality. The seemingly contrasting interpretations of womanism given by Walker validate the experiences of African-American women, while promoting a visionary perspective for the world based on said experiences.

Much of Alice Walker&#x27;s progeny admit that while she is the creator of the term, Walker fails to consistently define the term and often contradicts herself. At some points she portrays womanism as a more inclusive revision of Black feminism as it is not limited to Black women and focuses on the woman as a whole. Later in life, she appears to begin to regret this peace-seeking and inclusive form of womanism due to the constant and consistent prejudice inflicted upon Black women, specifically those whose voices had yet to be validated by both white women and Black men.

===Womanism (1985)===
Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi is a Nigerian literary critic who, in 1985, published the article &quot;Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English&quot; which described her interpretation of womanism. She asserts that the womanist vision is to answer the ultimate question of how to equitably share power among the races and between the sexes. She arrived at her interpretation of the term independently of Alice Walker&#x27;s definition, yet there are several overlaps between the two ideologies. In alignment with Walker&#x27;s definition focusing on Blackness and womanhood, Ogunyemi writes, &quot;black womanism is a philosophy that celebrates black roots, the ideals of black life, while giving a balanced presentation of black womandom&quot;.

Rather than citing gender inequality as the source of Black oppression, Ogunyemi takes a separatist stance much like Hudson-Weems, and dismisses the possibility of reconciliation of white feminists and Black feminists on the grounds of the intractability of racism. She uses a few examples of how feminists write about Blackness and African Blackness specifically to make salient the need for an African conception of womanism. These critiques include the use of Blackness as a tool to forward feminist ideals without also forwarding ideals related to Blackness, the thought that Western feminism is a tool which would work in African nations without acknowledging cultural norms and differences, and a co-opting of things that African women have been doing for centuries before the western notion of feminism into Western feminism.

Ogunyemi finds her conception of womanism&#x27;s relationship with men at the cross roads of Walker&#x27;s and Hudson-Weems&#x27;. Walker&#x27;s expresses a communal opportunity for men while acknowledging how they can be dangerous to the womanist community. Hudson-Weems&#x27; conception refuses to see the Africana man as an enemy, disregarding the harm that Africana men have imparted on to the community.

===Africana womanism (1995)===
Clenora Hudson-Weems is credited with coining the term Africana womanism. In 1995, the publication of her book, &quot;Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves&quot; sent shock waves through the Black nationalism community and established her as an independent thinker. Hudson-Weems rejects feminism as the theology of Africana women, that is to say women of the African diaspora, because it is philosophically rooted in Eurocentric ideals. Hudson-Weems identifies further differences between womanism and feminism being; womanism is &quot;family-oriented&quot; and focuses on race, class, and gender, while feminism is &quot;female-oriented&quot; and strictly focuses on biological sex-related issues women and girls face, globally.

She further asserts that it is impossible to incorporate the cultural perspectives of African women into the feminism ideal due to the history of slavery and racism in America. Furthermore, Weems rejects feminism&#x27;s characterization of the man as the enemy. She claims that this does not connect with Africana women as they do not see Africana men as the enemy. Instead the enemy is the oppressive force that subjugates the Africana man, woman, and child. She claims that feminism&#x27;s masculine-feminine binary comes from a lack of additional hardship placed on women by their circumstances (i.e. race and socio-economic) as feminism was founded to appeal to upper-class white women.

She also distances the Africana woman from Black feminism by demarcating the latter as distinctly African-American which is in turn distinctly Western. She also critiques Black feminism as a subset of feminism needing the validation of white feminists for their voices to be heard. She claims that feminism will never truly accept Black feminists, but instead relegate them to the fringes of the feminist movement.

She ultimately claims that the matriarchs of the Black feminist movement will never be put into the same conversation as the matriarchs of the feminist movement. A large part of her work mirrors separatist Black Nationalist discourse, because of the focus on the collective rather than the individual as the forefront of her ideology. Hudson-Weems refutes Africana womanism as an addendum to feminism, and asserts that her ideology differs from Black feminism and Walker&#x27;s womanism.

==Ideologies==
In the context of womanist theory, ideologies refer to the overarching belief systems, worldviews, and frameworks of thought that underpin and guide the perspectives, actions, and principles of womanists. These ideologies are integral to understanding womanism as a social and philosophical movement that centers the experiences of Black women, as well as the broader struggles for justice, equity, and empowerment. 

Womanism has various definitions and interpretations. At its broadest definition, it is a universalist ideology for all women, regardless of color. A womanist is, according to Walker&#x27;s 1979 story &quot;Coming Apart&quot;, an African-American heterosexual woman willing to utilize wisdom from African-American lesbians about how to improve sexual relationships and avoid being sexually objectified. In the context of men&#x27;s destructive use of pornography and their exploitation of Black women as pornographic objects, a womanist is also committed to &quot;the survival and wholeness of an entire people, male and female&quot; through confronting oppressive forces.

Walker&#x27;s much cited phrase, &quot;womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender&quot;, suggests that Walker considers feminism as a component of the wider ideological umbrella of womanism. It focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of not just Black women, but all women of color in addition to critically addressing the dynamics of the conflict between the mainstream feminist, the Black feminist, the African feminist, and the Africana womanist movement. However, there is Black nationalist discourse prevalent within womanist work and for this reason scholars are divided between associating womanism with other similar ideologies such as Black feminism and Africana womanism or taking the stance that the three are inherently incompatible.

===Black feminism===
The Black feminist movement was formed in response to the needs of women who were racially underrepresented by the Women&#x27;s Movement and sexually oppressed by the Black Liberation Movement. Black feminist scholars assert that African-American women are doubly disadvantaged in the social, economic, and political sphere, because they face discrimination on the basis of both race and gender. Black women felt that their needs were being ignored by both movements and they struggled to identify with either based on race or gender. African-American women who use the term Black feminism attach a variety of interpretations to it.

One such interpretation is that Black feminism addresses the needs of African-American women that the feminism movement largely ignores. Feminism, as Black feminist theorist Pearl Cleage defines it, is &quot;the belief that women are full human beings capable of participation and leadership in the full range of human activities—intellectual, political, social, sexual, spiritual, and economic&quot;. With this definition, the feminist agenda can be said to encompass different issues ranging from political rights to educational opportunities within a global context. The Black feminist agenda seeks to streamline these issues and focuses on those that are the most applicable to African-American women.

===Africana womanism===
Clenora Hudson-Weems&#x27;s Africana womanism arose from a nationalist Africana studies concept. In &quot;Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves&quot;, Hudson-Weems explores the limitations of feminist theory and explains the ideas and activism of different African women who have contributed to womanist theory. At its core, Africana womanism rejects feminism because it is set up in a way as to promote the issues of white women over the issues of Black women. Hudson-Weems argues that feminism will never be okay for Black women due to the implications of slavery and prejudice.

Weems professes womanism is separate from other feminism in that it has a different agenda, different priorities, and &quot;focuses on the unique experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of Africana women.&quot; She further asserts that the relationship between a Black man and a Black woman is significantly different from the relationship between a white man and a white woman, because the white woman battles the white man for subjugating her, but the black woman battles all oppressive forces that subjugate her, her children, and the black man.

She further asserts that racism forced African-American men and African-American women to assume unconventional gender roles. In this context, the desire of mainstream feminism to dismantle traditional gender roles becomes inapplicable to the Black experience. Unlike womanism, though closely related, Africana womanism is an ideology designed specifically with women of African descent in mind. It is grounded in African culture and focuses on the unique struggles, needs, and desires of African women. Based on this reasoning, Africana womanism posits race- and class-based oppression as far more significant than gender-based oppression.

==Womanist identifications==
Identity and identifications are related concepts, but they have distinct meanings in the context of social and cultural studies. &quot;Identity&quot; represents the deeper, multifaceted understanding of who a person or group is, while &quot;identifications&quot; are the specific labels or categories that are applied to express or communicate aspects of that identity. Identifications can be one of the ways people express and define their identities, but they do not capture the entirety of a person&#x27;s or group&#x27;s identity. Womanist identifications have been a source of discussion and debate, particularly when individuals or groups feel that the labels assigned to them do not fully represent their complex identities.

In her introduction to &quot;The Womanist Reader&quot;, Layli Phillips contends that despite womanism&#x27;s characterization, its main concern is not the Black woman per se but rather the Black woman is the point of origin for womanism. The basic tenets of womanism includes a strong, self-authored spirit of activism that is especially evident in literature. Womanism has been such a polarizing movement for women that it has managed to step outside of the Black community and extend itself into non-white communities. &quot;Purple is to Lavender&quot; is applied to non-Black contexts by professors Dimpal Jain (California State University, Northridge) and Caroline Sotello Viernes Turner (Mary Lou Fulton Teachers College, Arizona State University).

Some scholars view womanism as a subcategory of feminism while others argue that it is actually the other way around. Purple is to Lavender explores the concept that womanism is to feminism as purple is to lavender, that feminism falls under the umbrella of womanism. In &quot;Purple is to Lavender&quot;, Dimpal Jain and Caroline Turner discuss their experiences as non-white women in faculty. They experienced a great deal of discrimination because they were minorities. Jain is South Asian, while Caroline identifies as Filipino.

They go on to describe the concept of &quot;The Politics of Naming&quot; which shapes the reason for why they prefer womanism as opposed to feminism Jain states: &quot;I knew that the term feminism was contested and that I did not like how it fit in my mouth. It was uncomfortable and scratchy, almost like a foreign substance that I was being forced to consume as the white women continued to smile with comforting looks of familiarity and pride&quot;

Here, Turner makes it well known that she feels as though feminism is something that is forced upon her. She feels that she cannot completely identify with feminism. It is also important to note Jain&#x27;s statement that &quot;The crux of the politics of naming is that names serve as identifiers and are not neutral when attached to social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Naming and labeling become politicized acts when they serve to determine any type of membership at a group level.&quot;

This statement illustrates that if an individual identifies with feminism they may do so for particular reasons. However, those reasons may not be evident to the general public because of the connotation that the word feminism brings with it in terms of social movements, ideas, and groups of people. Individuals want something to identify with that expresses and supports their beliefs holistically. They want something that they can embrace to the fullest without any hint of regret. Similarly, Alice Walker even states: &quot;I don&#x27;t choose womanism because it is &#x27;better&#x27; than feminism ... I choose it because I prefer the sound, the feel, the fit of it... because I share the old ethnic-American habit of offering society a new word when the old word it is using fails to describe behavior and change that only a new word can help it more fully see&quot;

For a majority of Black women feminism has failed to accurately and holistically describe them as individuals to the world that surrounds them. They feel as though it takes something new that is not already bound to a predetermined master in order to capture this new movement. Womanism is something that Alice Walker can completely identify with without having second thoughts; it feels natural to her. Feminism does not. When distinguishing between feminism and womanism it is important to remember that many women find womanism easier to identify with. In addition, a key component of a womanist discourse is the role that spirituality and ethics has on ending the interlocking oppression of race, gender, and class that circumscribes the lives of African-American women.

===Literature and activism===
Womanist literature and activism are two areas that are largely interrelated, with each having a considerable effect on the other. A major tenet of womanist literature and activism is the idea that Black activists and Black authors should separate themselves from the feminist ideology. This stems from assertions by Kalenda Eaton, Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, and numerous other womanist theologians that the goal of a womanist should be to promote the issues affecting not just Black women, but Black men and other groups that have been subjected to discrimination or impotence. In the words of Chikwenye Okonjo Ogunyemi, a white woman writer may be a feminist, but a Black woman writer is likely to be a womanist. That is, she recognizes that along with battling for sexual equality, she must also incorporate race, economics, culture, and politics within her philosophy.

In Kalenda Eaton&#x27;s, &quot;Womanism, Literature and the Transformation of the Black Community&quot;, Black women writers are portrayed as both activists and visionaries for change in the Black Community following the Civil Rights Movement. She interweaves the historical events of African-American history with the development of Afro-Politico womanism in a bid to create a haven for Black female activism within the Black community. This Afro-Politico womanism veers from the traditional feminist goal of gender equality within a group and rather seeks to fight for the men and women whose civil rights are infringed upon. While Eaton takes the stance that Black women were largely excluded from the more prominent positions within the Black Movement, she argues that Black women activists had the greatest effect in small-scale grassroots protests within their communities.

Using various characters from Toni Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, Alice Walker&#x27;s &quot;Meridian&quot;, Toni Cade Bambara&#x27;s &quot;The Salt Eaters&quot;, and Paule Marshall&#x27;s &quot;The Chosen Place, the Timeless People&quot; as symbols of the various political agendas and issues that were prevalent within The Black Movement, Eaton draws upon the actions of the protagonists to illustrate solutions to the problems of disgruntlement and disorganization within the movement. Often the main task of these literary activists was to empower the impoverished masses—defined by Eaton as mainly Southern African-Americans, and they used the Black middle class as a model for the possibility of social mobility within the African-American community. A common theme within womanist literature is the failure of Black women writers to identify with feminist thought. Womanism becomes the concept that binds these novelists together.

Audre Lorde in &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot; criticizes second-wave feminism, arguing that women were taught to ignore their differences, or alternately to let their differences divide them. Lorde never used the word &quot;womanist&quot; or &quot;womanism&quot; in her writing or in descriptions of herself, but her work has helped to further the concept. As she pointed out, traditional second-wave feminism often focused too narrowly on the concerns of white, heterosexual women, with the concerns of Black women and lesbians often being ignored.

===Spirituality and womanist theology===
Womanist spirituality has six identifying characteristics—it is eclectic, synthetic, holistic, personal, visionary, and pragmatic. It draws from its resources and uses the summation of said resources to create a whole from multiple parts. Although it is ultimately defined by self, womanist spirituality envisions the larger picture and exists to solve problems and end injustice. Emilie Townes, a womanist theologian, further asserts that womanist spirituality grows out of individual and communal reflection on African-American faith and life. She explains that it is not grounded in the notion that spirituality is a force but rather a practice separate from who we are moment by moment.

One of the main characteristics of womanism is its religious aspect, commonly thought of as Christian. This connotation portrays spiritual Black womanists as &quot;church going&quot; women who play a vital role in the operation of the church. In William&#x27;s article &quot;Womanist Spirituality Defined&quot; she discusses how womanist spirituality is directly connected to an individual&#x27;s experiences with God. For instance, Williams declares that &quot;the use of the term spirituality in this paper speaks of the everyday experiences of life and the way in which we relate to and interpret God at work in those experiences&quot;.

This connotation is disputed in Monica Coleman&#x27;s Roundtable Discussion: &quot;Must I Be a Womanist?&quot; where she focuses on the shortcomings of womanism that result from how individuals have historically described womanism. This holistic discussion of womanism is the result of a roundtable discussion. Coleman, who initiated the discussion, describes her thoughts on why she prefers Black feminism as opposed to womanism, and she also discusses the limited scope that womanist religious scholarship embodies. Coleman offers deep insight into the spiritual aspect of womanism when she declares that, &quot;Intentionally or not, womanists have created a Christian hegemonic discourse within the field&quot;.

Here Coleman argues that the majority of womanists have defined womanist spirituality as Christian. A specific example of this occurs in Walker&#x27;s &quot;Everyday Use&quot;, when the mother suddenly gains the courage to take a stand against her spoiled daughter as she declares, &quot;When I looked at her like that something hit me in the top of my head and ran down to the soles of my feet. Just like when I&#x27;m in church and the spirit of God touches me and I get happy and shout&quot;.

However, Coleman provides a counter example to this assumption, writing: &quot;How, for example, might a womanist interpret the strength Tina Turner finds in Buddhism and the role her faith played in helping her to leave a violent relationship?&quot; Coleman believes that the assumption of Christianity as the default in womanism is a limited view. She asserts that Womanist religious scholarship has the ability to spread across a variety of paradigms and traditions, and can represent and support a radical womanist spirituality.

==== Ethics ====
Ethics is a branch of philosophy. Philosophy is a broad field of study that explores fundamental questions about knowledge, existence, reality, and values. Within philosophy, ethics is the specific branch that focuses on questions related to moral principles, values, and the rightness or wrongness of human actions. Ethical philosophy delves into topics such as moral theories, ethical dilemmas, moral reasoning, and the nature of morality itself. It seeks to provide a rational and systematic framework for understanding and evaluating ethical questions and decisions.

Womanist ethics is a religious discipline that examines the ethical theories concerning human agency, action, and relationship. At the same time, it rejects social constructions that have neglected the existence of a group of women that have bared the brunt of injustice and oppression. Its perspective is shaped by the theological experiences of African-American women. With the use of analytic tools, the effect of race, class, gender, and sexuality on the individual and communal perspective is examined. Womanist ethic provides an alternative to Christian and other religious ethics while utilizing the elements of critique, description, and construction to assess the power imbalance and patriarchy that has been used to oppress women of color and their communities.

Katie Cannon&#x27;s &quot;The Emergence of Black Feminist Consciousness&quot; was the first publication to speak directly about womanist ethics. In this article, Cannon argues that the perspectives of Black women are largely ignored in various religious and academic discourses. Jacquelyn Grant expands on this point by asserting that Black women concurrently experience the three oppressive forces of racism, sexism, and classism. Black feminist theory has been used by womanist ethics to explain the lack of participation of African-American women and men in academic discourse. Patricia Collins credits this phenomenon to prevalence of white men determining what should or should not be considered valid discourse and urges for an alternative mode of producing knowledge that includes the core themes of Black female consciousness.

==Critiques==
A major ongoing critique about womanist scholarship is the failure of many scholars to critically address homosexuality within the Black community. Walker&#x27;s protagonist in &quot;Coming Apart&quot; uses writings from two African-American womanists, Audre Lorde and Luisah Teish, to support her argument that her husband should stop consuming pornography, and posts quotes from lesbian poet Lorde above her kitchen sink. &quot;In Search of Our Mothers&#x27; Gardens&quot; states that a womanist is &quot;a woman who loves another woman, sexually and/or non-sexually&quot;, yet despite &quot;Coming Apart&quot; and &quot;In Search of Our Mother&#x27;s Gardens&quot;, there is very little literature linking womanism to lesbian or bisexual issues. Womanist theologian Renee Hill cites Christian influences as a source of this heterosexism and homophobia.

Rev. Kelly Brown Douglas also sees the influence of the Black church, and its male leadership, as a reason for the community at large having little regard for queer women of color. Black feminist critic Barbara Smith blames this lack of support on the Black community&#x27;s reluctance to come to terms with homosexuality. On the other hand, there is also an increase in the criticism of heterosexism within womanist scholarship. Christian womanist theologian Pamela R. Lightsey, in her book &quot;Our Lives Matter: A Womanist Queer Theology&quot; (2015), writes, &quot;To many people, we are still &quot;perverts&quot;. To many, the black pervert is the most dangerous threat to the American ideal. Because the black conservative bourgeoisie has joined the attack on our personhood, black LGBTQ persons cannot allow the discourse to be controlled such that our existence within the black community is denied or made invisible.&quot;

An additional critique lies within the ambivalence of womanism. In African womanism, the term is associated with Black nationalist discourse and the separatist movement. Patricia Collins argues that this exaggerates racial differences by promoting homogeneous identity. This is a sharp contrast to the universalist model of womanism that is championed by Walker. The continued controversy and dissidence within the various ideologies of womanism serves only to draw attention away from the goal of ending race and gender-based oppression.

<doc id="912962" wikidata="Q332934" url="?curid=912962" title="Butterfly valve">
<text>A butterfly valve is a valve that isolates or regulates the flow of a fluid. The closing mechanism is a disk that rotates.

==Principle of operation==
Operation is similar to that of a ball valve, which allows for quick shut off. Butterfly valves are generally favored because they cost less than other valve designs, and are lighter weight so they need less support. The disc is positioned in the center of the pipe. A rod passes through the disc to an actuator on the outside of the valve. Rotating the actuator turns the disc either parallel or perpendicular to the flow. Unlike a ball valve, the disc is always present within the flow, so it induces a pressure drop, even when open.

A butterfly valve is from a family of valves called quarter-turn valves. In operation, the valve is fully open or closed when the disc is rotated a quarter turn. The &quot;butterfly&quot; is a metal disc mounted on a rod. When the valve is closed, the disc is turned so that it completely blocks off the passageway. When the valve is fully open, the disc is rotated a quarter turn so that it allows an almost unrestricted passage of the fluid. The valve may also be opened incrementally to throttle flow.

There are different kinds of butterfly valves, each adapted for different pressures and different usage. The zero-offset butterfly valve, which uses the flexibility of rubber, has the lowest pressure rating. The high-performance double offset butterfly valve, used in slightly higher-pressure systems, is offset from the center line of the disc seat and body seal (offset one), and the center line of the bore (offset two). This creates a cam action during operation to lift the seat out of the seal resulting in less friction than is created in the zero offset design and decreases its tendency to wear. The valve best suited for high-pressure systems is the triple offset butterfly valve. In this valve, the disc seat contact axis is offset, which acts to virtually eliminate sliding contact between disc and seat. In the case of triple offset valves the seat is made of metal so that it can be machined such as to achieve a bubble-tight shut-off when in contact with the disc.

== Types ==
# Concentric butterfly valves – this type of valve has a resilient rubber seat with a metal disc. 
# Doubly-eccentric butterfly valves (high-performance butterfly valves or double-offset butterfly valves) – different type of materials is used for seat and disc. 
# Triply-eccentric butterfly valves (triple-offset butterfly valves) – the seats are either laminated or solid metal seat design.
# Butterfly valve with actuator electric valve - An electrically actuated butterfly valve is a quarter-turn valve controlled by an electric motor. It offers fast and precise flow regulation, remote operation, and versatility for various applications.

=== Wafer-style butterfly valve ===
The wafer style butterfly valve is designed to maintain a seal against bi-directional pressure differential to prevent any backflow in systems designed for unidirectional flow. It accomplishes this with a tightly fitting seal; i.e., gasket, precision machined, and a flat valve face on the upstream and downstream sides of the valve.the drawback is that wafer butterfly valves only have a small flow control range. The pressure drop across wafer butterfly valves may be greater. Wafer butterfly valves are prone to clogging due to their design.

=== Lug-style butterfly valve ===
Lug-style valves have threaded inserts at both sides of the valve body. This allows them to be installed into a system using two sets of bolts and no nuts. The valve is installed between two flanges using a separate set of bolts for each flange. This setup permits either side of the piping system to be disconnected without disturbing the other side.

A lug-style butterfly valve used in dead end service generally has a reduced pressure rating. For example, a lug-style butterfly valve mounted between two flanges has a pressure rating. The same valve mounted with one flange, in dead end service, has a rating. Lugged valves are extremely resistant to chemicals and solvents and can handle temperatures up to 200 °C, which makes it a versatile solution.

=== Rotary valve ===
Rotary valves constitute a derivation of the general butterfly valves and are used mainly in powder processing industries. Instead of being flat, the butterfly is equipped with pockets. When closed, it acts exactly like a butterfly valve and is tight. But when it is in the rotation, the pockets allow dropping a defined amount of solids,&quot;&quot; which makes the valve suitable for dosing bulk product by gravity. Such valves are usually of small size (less than 300 mm), pneumatically activated and rotate 180 degrees back and forth.

== Use in industry ==
In the pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries, a butterfly valve is used to interrupt product flow (solid, liquid, gas) within the process. The valves used in these industries are usually manufactured according to cGMP guidelines (current good manufacturing practice). Butterfly valves generally replaced ball valves in many industries, particularly petroleum, due to lower cost and ease of installation, but pipelines containing butterfly valves cannot be &#x27;pigged&#x27; for cleaning.

== History ==
The butterfly valve has been in use since the late 18th century. James Watt used a butterfly valve in his steam engine prototypes. With advances in material manufacturing and technology, butterfly valves could be made smaller and withstand more-extreme temperatures. After World War II, synthetic rubbers were used in the sealer members, allowing the butterfly valve to be used in many more industries. In 1969 James E. Hemphill patented an improvement to the butterfly valve, reducing the hydrodynamic torque needed to change the output of the valve.

<text>The Victor Harbor Horse Drawn Tram is located on the shores of the city of Victor Harbor, South Australia, Australia. A tramway links the city&#x27;s visitor information centre with the nearby Granite Island. Much of its route is over a causeway.

The tramway is one of the very few horse-drawn tram routes remaining in public transit service anywhere in the world. It operates every day throughout the year except Christmas Day. Up to three double-decker tramcars are each hauled by a Clydesdale horse. The line is built to broad gauge, as were many of the early railways of South Australia.

In October 2018, the Victor Harbor Horse Tram Authority was established as a subsidiary of the City of Victor Harbor to oversee the operations, business development and marketing of the service.

==History==
The South Australian Railways (SAR) reached Victor Harbor in 1864, when a pier adjacent to the railway station was constructed. In 1867 the pier was extended to reach Granite Island, the resulting link becoming known as a causeway, and a railway track was laid on it. The track continued on to and around the northern edge of the island to where a jetty was constructed. Although railway goods vehicles were routinely horse-hauled on this line, no passenger service operated until 1894. By then, increasing numbers of visitors and holiday makers were turning the causeway into a local attraction. The SAR decided to utilise a surplus double-deck horse-drawn tram to offer a passenger service. Subsequently, others followed.

From the beginning of the 1900s George Honeyman contracted with the SAR to operate the passenger service. From 1940 his younger brother, Frank, took over until the line was closed in 1955 when the old working jetty and remnants of the Victoria Pier were being demolished by the Harbours Board. To strengthen the causeway for operation of the tram would have cost £3,000 but funds were not forthcoming and in 1954 the causeway was reconstructed without rails. The service continued to operate on Granite Island itself until 1956, when the cars were disposed of. Between 1956 and 1986 two rubber-tyred trailers towed by a small Ferguson tractor, later by a Land Rover with cladding to imitate the outline of a steam locomotive, provided a service with half the 32-person seating capacity of the tram cars.

The 150th jubilee of South Australia was celebrated in 1986, and a fund was established for special projects to mark it. Reinstatement of the horse tramway was one such project. Four replica tram cars, each to carry 52 passengers, were built with tubular steel, timber cladding and roller bearings. Tracks were relaid and the service recommenced on 14 June 1986. In the 1990s rubber matting was installed on the causeway to assist the horses, of which there are 14 that each rotate on two three-hour shifts (of 3–4 trips) per week. One tram normally operates; two at busy times and at Easter, and three over the Christmas/New Year holiday period.

In 2019, operations of the tram were suspended on New Year&#x27;s Day after a pylon broke off the causeway and fell into the sea. After an urgent engineering assessment, major concerns were raised over the ageing causeway&#x27;s ability to support the weight of the tramcars, and tram operations were again suspended on 23 January. The Horse Tram recommenced operation on 23 June 2019.

<text>Mohiniyattam is an Indian classical dance form originating from the state of Kerala. The dance gets its name from Mohini – the female enchantress avatar of the Hindu deity Vishnu, who helps the devas prevail over the asuras using her feminine charm.

&quot;Mohiniyattam&quot;&#x27;s roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; – the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performance arts. However, it follows the Lasya style described in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine. It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training, though men also perform the dance in the contemporary period. The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style, singing and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or the dancer themselves. The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam.

The earliest mention of the word is found in the 16th-century legal text &quot;Vyavahāramālā&quot;, but the likely roots of the dance are older. The dance was systematized in the 18th century, was ridiculed as a Devadasi prostitution system during the colonial British Raj, banned by a series of laws from 1931 through 1938, a ban that was protested and partially repealed in 1940. The socio-political conflict ultimately led to renewed interest, revival and reconstruction of Mohiniyattam by the people of Kerala, particularly the poet Vallathol Narayana Menon.

Principles Of Mohiniyattam

Lasya: Lasya is the feminine aspect of dance. It is characterized by its soft, graceful movements. Mohiniyattam is a lasya-dominant dance form. This means that it emphasizes feminine grace and beauty.

Trisama: Trisama is the coordination of the three elements of dance: nritta (pure dance), nritya (expressive dance), and natya (drama). Mohiniyattam dancers must be able to coordinate all three elements of dance. This is to create a harmonious and expressive performance.

Abhinaya: Abhinaya is the art of facial expression and hand gestures in Indian classical dance. Mohiniyattam dancers use abhinaya to convey the emotions and meaning of the dance.

Mudra: Mudras are hand gestures that are used to convey specific meanings in Indian classical dance. Mohiniyattam dancers use a variety of mudras to tell stories and express emotions.

Tala and Laya: Tala (rhythm) and laya (tempo) are essential elements of Indian classical dance. Mohiniyattam dancers must have a strong sense of rhythm. They should be able to maintain the tempo of the dance throughout the performance.

== Etymology ==
Mohiniyattam, also referred to as Mohini-attam, is derived from &quot;Mohini&quot; – a famous female avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu in Indian mythology.

Mohini refers to a divine enchantress or a supreme seductress. She appears in Hindu mythologies during a battle between Devas (good) and Asuras (evil), after the evil had won control of &quot;Amrita&quot; (nectar of immortality). Appearing in her youthful bloom, dressed rapturously she uses her charms to seduce the Asuras, who seeking her favors, give her the &quot;Amrita&quot; to distribute among the evil forces. Mohini after gaining the &quot;Amrita&quot; gives it to the good instead, depriving the evil from gaining immortality.

The details of the Mohini story varies by the Purana and region, but she is consistently an enchantress avatar of the supreme in Vaishnavism. &quot;Aattam&quot; is a Malayalam language word, and means rhythmic motion or dance. &quot;Mohiniyattam&quot; thus connotes &quot;a dance of an enchantress, a beautiful woman&quot;.

==History==
Mohiniyattam is a classical Indian dance, which by definition traces its repertoire to the foundational text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. The &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; text is attributed to the ancient scholar Bharata Muni. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The text describes the basic elements and the structure of two types of dance: the vigorous, high energy Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva) and the gentle, calmingly graceful Lāsyā dance (Parvati, Shiva&#x27;s lover). Mohiniyāttam follows the structure and aims of the Lāsyā dance in &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;.

According to Reginald Massey, Mohiniyattam&#x27;s history is unclear. Kerala, the region where this dance genre developed and is popular, has a long tradition of &quot;lasya&quot; style dances whose basics and structure may be at the root. The earliest evidence of Mohiniyattam, or a Mohiniyattam-like dance tradition is found in temple sculpture of Kerala. The 11th century Vishnu temple at Trikodithanam, and the Kidangur Subramanya temple, have several sculptures of female dancers in Mohiniyattam pose. The textual evidence from 12th century onwards suggest that Malayalam poets and playwrights included Lāsyā themes. The 16th century &quot;Vyavaharamala&quot; by Nambootiri contains the first known mention of the term Mohiniyattam, in the context of a payment to be made to a Mohiniyattam dancer. Another text, &quot;Gosha Yatra&quot;, from the 17th century too mentions the term. The 18th century &quot;Balarama Bharatam&quot;, a major secondary work on &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; composed in Kerala, mentions many dance styles including &quot;Mohini Natana&quot;.

In the 18th and 19th century, Mohiniyattam grew as dance arts received patronage of competing princely states. In particular, the early 19th century sponsorship and building of a joint Mohiniyattam and Bharatanatyam team of artists by the Hindu king, poet and music composer Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma contributed to the growth and systematization of modern Mohiniyattam.

In the late 19th and early 20th century, Mohiniyattam was performed by women in the Hindu community, a community in central Kerala. According to Justine Lemos, Mohiniyattam &quot;was a celebration of eroticism, fertility, wealth and hospitality&quot;.

===Colonial era===
With the spread of colonial British rule in the 19th century India, all classical dance forms of India were ridiculed and discouraged, leading to their severe decline. This was in part the result of the Victorian morality of sexual repressiveness along with Anglican missionaries who criticized Hinduism.
The seductive gestures and facial expressions during temple dances were caricatured in &quot;The Wrongs of Indian Womanhood&quot;, published at the start of the 20th century, as evidence of &quot;harlots, debased erotic culture, slavery to idols and priests&quot; tradition, and Christian missionaries demanded that this must be stopped, launching the &quot;anti-dance movement&quot; or &quot;anti-nautch movement&quot; in 1892. This movement affected all classical dances in India and contributed to their decline, including the stigmatization of Mohiniyattam in the princely states of Travancore and Cochin in the British Empire.

According to Justine Lemos, the conventional stereotype has been to label the temple dancers as prostitutes and that Mohiniyattam was banned by the Maharaja under pressure from the British rule and his citizens, but an examination of historical evidence suggests that neither did any law or proclamation ban Mohiniyattam nor is there any evidence that dancing girls of Mohiniyattam were devadasis, temple prostitutes or even menial servants of the temple. However, adds Lemos, there is evidence of rewards being given, scholarship being sponsored, and payments being made to the dancers of Mohiniyattam, as well as laws enacted between 1931 and 1938 that – without naming Mohiniyattam – banned devadasis, banned all forms of &quot;lewd dance or theatre&quot;, and banned dancing in temples while the princely states of Kerala were part of the British Empire, in a manner similar to bans on Hindu performance arts in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta Presidencies enacted earlier. In 1940, the ban was partially repealed, by allowing &quot;voluntary dances in temples&quot;. In 1941, a new law clarified that voluntary dance was permitted, but the dancers should never be paid. This led to protests, public riots and demands by dancers that performance art is a form of economic activity and religious freedom, that Mohiniyattam artists should be paid by the state or the audience, but the state did not pay them.

Some women continued to dance Mohiniyattam in Hindu temples, regardless of the historic politics during the 1940s.

===Modern era===
The ridicule and bans enacted during the British colonial era contributed to nationalist sentiments, and impacted all Hindu performance arts including Mohiniyattam. It too was revived and reconstructed, particularly in the 1930s by the nationalist Malayalam poet Vallathol Narayana Menon, who helped repeal the ban on temple dancing in Kerala, as well as established the Kerala Kalamandalam dance school and encouraged Mohiniattam studies, training and practice.

Other significant champions of Mohiniyattam in the 20th century have been Mukundraja, Appiradeth Krishna Panicker, Harichand and guys from Vishnavam, Thankamony, as well as the guru and dancer Kalamandalam Kalyanikutty Amma.

Kalamandalam is a very known institution for teaching and learning the art form Mohiniyattam, but notorious for the discriminations faced by the artists and students based on their caste and colour. Adding spice to this, Kalamandalam Sathyabhama Jr entered the media scope recently with racist and gender slam statement against male and coloured artists earning their space in the art form gala of Mohiniyattam.

==Repertoire==
Mohiniyattam is a &quot;lasya&quot; subgenre of dance, performed in the &quot;Kaisiki vritti&quot; (graceful style), as discussed in ancient Indian performance arts texts such as the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. More specifically, it is a dance that excels in &quot;Ekaharya Abhinaya&quot; form, that is a solo expressive dance performance aided by singing and music. The dance includes &quot;nritta&quot; (pure dance, solo), &quot;nritya&quot; (expressive dance, solo) and modern productions sometimes include &quot;natya&quot; (play, group dance):

* The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is abstract, rhythmic aspect of the dance that appears early and at the end of the dance repertoire. The viewer is presented with pure movement, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story.
* The &quot;Nritya&quot; is the expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate a storyline, with emotions and feelings, with spiritual themes. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the dance-acting (&quot;Abhinaya&quot;, &quot;Vaittari&quot;) expands to include silent expression of words through hand and facial gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The dancer articulates a legend or a spiritual message, aiming to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.

The basic posture of Mohiniyattam is parted feet, knees bent outwards, an erect upper torso, gentle 8-shape side to side swaying of body along with hips (&quot;Ati Bhanga&quot;). The footwork is soft, sliding and synchronous with the musical beat and acting. The body movement is sometimes described in terms of calming images of nature as the swinging of the palm leaves, and the gentle undulating of ocean waves.

The basic dance units in Mohiniattam are known as &quot;atavus&quot; or &quot;atavukal&quot;, and these are grouped into four: &quot;Taganam&quot;, &quot;Jaganam&quot;, &quot;Dhaganam&quot; and &quot;Sammisram&quot;. The hand and facial gestures of the dance follow the classical text of &quot;Hastha Lakshanadeepika&quot;, which has elaborate description of mudras.

===Sequence===
The repertoire sequence of Mohiniyattam is similar to that of Bharatanatyam, so of contains seven items that are performed to a structure described in classical dance texts: Cholkettu (invocation, but starts with offering reverence to a goddess Bhagavati and ends with a prayer to Shiva), Jatisvaram or more precisely &quot;Swarajeti&quot;, Varnam (a play wherein she embeds a mimicry for distraction while communicating the underlying story or message), Padam (song), Tillana (dancer&#x27;s interpretation of melody the musician create), Shlokam and Saptam.

===Costumes===
The costume includes plain white or off-white such as ivory or cream colored sari embroidered with bright golden or gold laced colored brocade (similar to a ceremonial &quot;Kasavu&quot; saree). She wears a fitted &quot;choli&quot; (blouse) matching the sari, below which at the waist is a golden belt which tucks in the end of the sari, and highlights the waist. In front of the saree, below the belt is pleated sheet with concentric bands in gold or saffron colors, which allow freedom of movement and assist in visually communicating the mudra to distant audience.

The dancer wears relatively simple jewelry and no masks, in contrast to the other major classical dance of Kerala called Kathakali. Her jewelry typically includes items on fingers, wrists, neck and ears (which may have bells). The face makeup is natural, but lips are brilliant red, she has the Hindu tikka (&quot;Gobi&quot;) on her forehead and her eyes are lined to help prominently highlight the eye movements during the dance. Her ankles are adorned with leather straps with bells (&quot;chilanka&quot;), feet and fingers colored red with natural dyes. Her hairdo is gathered and tied into a smooth tight round chignon on one side of her head (typically left) and the bun then ringed with fragrant flowers (typically jasmine &quot;mulla&quot;).

For male dancers, they typically wear a dhoti (called the &quot;muti&quot;). Like women, his ankles are also adorned with chilankas, feet and fingers colored red with natural dyes. Like women, he also has the Hindu tikka (Gobi) on his forehead and his eyes are lined.

===Music and instruments===
The vocals (music) of Mohiniyattam involves various rhythms. There are numerous compositions for a Mohiniyattam repertoire, most of whose lyrics are in Manipravalam, a mixture of Sanskrit, Tamil and Malayalam.

The musical instruments usually used in Mohiniyattam are Mridangam or Madhalam (barrel drum), Idakka (hour glass drum), flute, Veena, and Kuzhitalam (cymbals). The ragas (melody) are rendered in the &quot;sopana&quot; (steps) style, which is a slow melodic style with roots in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;.

<text>Old Wives Lake is a shallow endorheic salt lake in south central Saskatchewan, Canada, about south-west of Moose Jaw. The lake is fed by the Wood River but seasonal water relatively flattened the terrain, and as such results in significant mudflats. A Migratory Bird Sanctuary was established at the lake on March 9, 1925. This lake, in conjunction with Reed Lake and Chaplin Lake, forms a site of hemispheric importance in the Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network. It was designated in April 1997, and is &quot;one of the most important inland sites for migratory birds in North America&quot;. At the north-eastern part of the lake is the Isle of Bays Wildlife Refuge (). The wildlife refuge encompasses the entirety of Isle of Bays.

At various times during the lake&#x27;s human history, it has attracted interest from several First Nations tribes, duck hunters, military trainers, sodium sulfate producers, conservationists, and birdwatchers.

Nearby communities include Old Wives and Mossbank. Access to the lake is from Highway 363. The Old Wives Lake is a popular destination for birdwatchers; a walking trail has been constructed along the lake&#x27;s south shore, along with viewing and picnic areas.

== Name ==
A variety of First Nations oral traditions explain the origin of the lake&#x27;s name. According to a Cree tradition, recounted by Métis guides accompanying the North-West Mounted Police in 1874, sometime around 1840 a band of Cree hunters followed a herd of bison into Blackfoot territory and made camp near the lake. Blackfoot scouts discovered this band and attacked. Although the Cree were able to defend themselves, they anticipated an attack by a larger Blackfoot war party the next morning. The older women volunteered to stay behind to tend the fires through the night in the hope of fooling the Blackfoot into believing that they were not abandoning their camp to escape. Using this diversion as cover, the rest of the Cree successfully fled back to their home territory in the Qu&#x27;Appelle valley. When the Blackfoot arrived that morning they found only the old women, whom the Blackfoot killed in vengeance. This commonly recited version of the lake&#x27;s naming has been commemorated by a historical marker situated beside Highway 2 near the lake. A variant telling of this narrative states that the Blackfoot warriors were so impressed by the women&#x27;s courage that they left them alone and allowed them to rejoin their own people. Another First Nations oral tradition describes how a band of Assiniboine fleeing from pursuing Blackfoot warriors abandoned the old women in their band who could not keep pace with everyone else. The women continued their effort to escape by wading across the lake. However, they misjudged the water&#x27;s depth and drowned. An Assiniboine tradition associates the name with a battle which occurred at the lake around the beginning of the 19th century in which Assiniboines vanquished their Blackfoot enemies. According to some First Nations traditions, the spirits of the dead women continue to haunt a small island in the lake from which their voices can be heard at night.

Some early accounts describing the region state that the name &quot;Old Wives Lake&quot; was originally applied to both the lake that currently bears that name and to nearby Chaplin Lake. In 1861, the British politicians Sir Frederick Johnstone and Henry Chaplin visited the area to hunt bison, antelope, and elk for sport. Explorer John Rae, who accompanied the expedition, named area lakes in honour of its members: The lake now called Old Wives Lake became Johnstone Lake and Chaplin Lake received the name by which it is still known. Although the Canadian government officially adopted the designation &quot;Johnstone Lake&quot; in 1886, the First Nations peoples along with early ranchers and homesteaders in the area continued to refer to it as Old Wives Lake. In response to a petition by area residents to restore its traditional name, the Canadian board on geographical names formally renamed it Old Wives Lake in 1953.

== History ==
Teepee rings and other artifacts discovered near Old Wives Lake attest to a First Nations presence in the area long predating their contact with Europeans. With the arrival of European settlers, ranchers and homesteaders occupied the area surrounding the lake. Until hunting was prohibited in the Old Wives Lake bird sanctuary, duck hunters gathered at the lake in the autumn to hunt the plentiful wild ducks and geese. During World War II a bombing and gunnery air training school established under the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan operated near the lake&#x27;s shoreline, three miles east of Mossbank. Throughout the war, part of the lake and its surroundings were incorporated into a 23-mile bombing range used by trainee pilots. For some decades in the 20th century, especially during the 1950s and 1960s, sodium sulfate was harvested from the lake by diverting water into nearby Frederick Lake for evaporation. The sodium sulfate plant operated until 1977. In 1975, two Canadian Forces military training aircraft were involved in a mid-air collision over the lake which caused one of the aircraft to crash into it. The two pilots in this aircraft were able to parachute out and inflate emergency rubber dinghies enabling them to remain afloat until their rescue by a helicopter based out of CFB Moose Jaw.

Drought conditions caused the lake to dry up completely in 1937, and 1988. In certain years, including 1951, 1959, 1980 and 1997, large numbers of ducks were found dead at the lake due to outbreaks of botulism.

== Old Wives-Frederick Lakes IBA ==

The Old Wives-Frederick Lakes (SK 031) Important Bird Area (IBA) of Canada is a protected area for birds that encompasses Old Wives and Frederick Lakes. The total area covered by the IBA is . Frederick Lake is a shallow basin adjacent to the south-western shore of Old Wives Lake. The site is home to numerous different bird species, including the endangered piping plover. The most commonly found birds include sanderlings and Baird&#x27;s sandpipers. Other species include American white pelicans, Semipalmated sandpipers, stilt sandpipers, American avocets, double-crested cormorants, Franklin&#x27;s gulls, ring-billed gulls, California gulls, common terns, mallards, and canvasbacks.

<text>In theoretical physics, Euclidean quantum gravity is a version of quantum gravity. It seeks to use the Wick rotation to describe the force of gravity according to the principles of quantum mechanics.

== Introduction in layperson&#x27;s terms ==

===The Wick rotation===

In physics, a Wick rotation, named after Gian-Carlo Wick, is a method of finding a solution to dynamics problems in formula_1 dimensions, by transposing their descriptions in formula_2 dimensions, by trading one dimension of space for one dimension of time. More precisely, it substitutes a mathematical problem in Minkowski space into a related problem in Euclidean space by means of a transformation that substitutes an imaginary-number variable for a real-number variable. 

It is called a &quot;rotation&quot; because when complex numbers are represented as a plane, the multiplication of a complex number by formula_3 is equivalent to rotating the vector representing that number by an angle of formula_4 radians about the origin.

For example, a Wick rotation could be used to relate a macroscopic event temperature diffusion (like in a bath) to the underlying thermal movements of molecules. If we attempt to model the bath volume with the different gradients of temperature we would have to subdivide this volume into infinitesimal volumes and see how they interact. We know such infinitesimal volumes are in fact water molecules. If we represent all molecules in the bath by only one molecule in an attempt to simplify the problem, this unique molecule should walk along all possible paths that the real molecules might follow. The path integral formulation is the conceptual tool used to describe the movements of this unique molecule, and Wick rotation is one of the mathematical tools that are very useful to analyse a path integral problem.

===Application in quantum mechanics===
In a somewhat similar manner, the motion of a quantum object as described by quantum mechanics implies that it can exist simultaneously in different positions and have different speeds. It differs clearly to the movement of a classical object (e.g. a billiard ball), since in this case a single path with precise position and speed can be described. A quantum object does not move from A to B with a single path, but moves from A to B by all ways possible at the same time. According to the Feynman path-integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the path of the quantum object is described mathematically as a weighted average of all those possible paths. In 1966 an explicitly gauge invariant functional-integral algorithm was found by DeWitt, which extended Feynman&#x27;s new rules to all orders. What is appealing in this new approach is its lack of singularities when they are unavoidable in general relativity.

Another operational problem with general relativity is the computational difficulty, because of the complexity of the mathematical tools used. Path integrals in contrast have been used in mechanics since the end of the nineteenth century and is well known. In addition, the path-integral formalism is used both in classical and quantum physics so it might be a good starting point for unifying general relativity and quantum theories. For example, the quantum-mechanical Schrödinger equation and the classical heat equation are related by Wick rotation. So the Wick relation is a good tool to relate a classical phenomenon to a quantum phenomenon. The ambition of Euclidean quantum gravity is to use the Wick rotation to find connections between a macroscopic phenomenon, gravity, and something more microscopic.

== More rigorous treatment==
Euclidean quantum gravity refers to a Wick rotated version of quantum gravity, formulated as a quantum field theory. The manifolds that are used in this formulation are 4-dimensional Riemannian manifolds instead of pseudo Riemannian manifolds. It is also assumed that the manifolds are compact, connected and boundaryless (i.e. no singularities). Following the usual quantum field-theoretic formulation, the vacuum to vacuum amplitude is written as a functional integral over the metric tensor, which is now the quantum field under consideration.

:formula_5

where φ denotes all the matter fields. See Einstein–Hilbert action.

==Relation to ADM formalism==
Euclidean Quantum Gravity does relate back to ADM formalism used in canonical quantum gravity and recovers the Wheeler–DeWitt equation under various circumstances. If we have some matter field formula_6, then the path integral reads

:formula_7

where integration over formula_8 includes an integration over the three-metric, the lapse function formula_9, and shift vector formula_10. But we demand that formula_11 be independent of the lapse function and shift vector at the boundaries, so we obtain

:formula_12

where formula_13 is the three-dimensional boundary. Observe that this expression vanishes implies the functional derivative vanishes, giving us the Wheeler–DeWitt equation. A similar statement may be made for the diffeomorphism constraint (take functional derivative with respect to the shift functions instead).

<text>The Tektronix 4010 series was a family of text-and-graphics computer terminals based on storage-tube technology created by Tektronix. Several members of the family were introduced during the 1970s, the best known being the 11-inch 4010 and 19-inch 4014, along with the less popular 25-inch 4016. They were widely used in the computer-aided design market in the 1970s and early 1980s.

The 4000 series were much less expensive than earlier graphics terminals, such as the IBM 2250, because no additional electronics were needed to maintain the display on the storage-tube screen; images drawn to the screen remained there until deliberately erased. This eliminated the need for computer memory to store the images, which was expensive in the 1970s.

The display series remained popular until the introduction of inexpensive graphics workstations in the 1980s. These new graphics workstations used raster displays and dedicated screen buffers that became more affordable as solid-state memory chips became markedly cheaper.

==History==

The Tektronix direct-view bistable storage tube was first used in the Tektronix 564 oscilloscope in 1963, and was first used for non-oscilloscope applications in the 601 monitor in 1968. A number of graphics terminals based on this tube and others from the 600-series were developed, including the Advanced Remote Display Station from MIT&#x27;s Project MAC, and the KV8I (later, KV8E) from Digital Equipment Corporation using the 11-inch diagonal 611. These displays consisted of just the CRT and related basic electronics; it was up to software on the host computer to produce a display by driving the CRT signals directly.

Tektronix decided to enter the computer terminal market themselves, introducing the 4002 in 1969, and the updated 4002A in 1971. The latter sold for , and required a host adaptor. These were similar to the earlier third-party terminals, essentially combining one of their storage tubes with the circuitry needed to decode instructions from the host and turn those into control inputs. However, the 4002 had the unique feature that only a portion of the screen was a storage tube, with a small section set aside for normal refresh-based drawing. This area was used for status messages and entering commands. As they did not include raster scan hardware or any form of memory, refreshing this area rapidly enough to reduce flicker was up to the host computer.

Starting in 1972, the 4002 was first supplanted and then replaced by the 4010. A number of changes and simplifications allowed these to be far less expensive, initially released at and another for a host adaptor. Other models in the 4010 series included the 4012 which added lower case characters, and the 4013 with an APL character set. These were implemented using plug-in boards that could be added to the base-model 4010 as well. In the 1980s, a version using a built-in RS-232 port and a number of missing features was released as the 4006, which was small enough to fit on a desk, selling for .

The 4014 joined the line at , introducing a larger 19-inch screen as well as a more an ergonomic layout. It had a wide range of new features as well, which made it much more effective in many contexts and became especially common in computer-aided design (CAD) use. The upgraded features became so widely-used that the 4014 series is sometimes considered to be a separate line from the 4010, or alternatively the canonical model for the entire family. The 4015 was a 4014 with the APL character set card from the 4013. The 4016, introduced in 1979, was a version with a 25-inch screen and a somewhat different mechanical layout to provide room for the much larger tube. It was much more expensive, with the base model selling for .

A wide variety of peripherals were available that worked on some or all of these models. The first line, introduced with the 4010, included the 4610 Hard Copy Unit, an early graphics printer. This used a system in the monitor to scan the display line-by-line, which sent signals to the printer where a one-line-tall CRT duplicated the image on thermal paper. Normally selling for , a version allowed the printer to be shared among four terminals. The printer adaptor could be pre-installed in the 4010, making it the 4010-1, and it came pre-installed on both the 4012 and 4013 which do not appear to have used the -1 notation to indicate this. The 4631 was a version of the 4610 with a sheet feeder and higher speed.

A properly equipped 4014 could also drive a pen plotter through an expansion card, including the GPIB-based 4662 Interactive Digital Plotter and 4663 C-sized version. Plotters offered color graphical output via colored pen selection, which could be embedded in the graphics data.

For storage, the systems could write out the data stream of characters as they were received from the host, allowing them to be played back locally to recreate the display. Storage options included the 4911 punch tape, the 4912 using cassette tapes based on a Sykes TT120 mechanism, and later added the 4923 based on the 3M DC300 digital tape system.

Other devices in the lineup included the 4901 and 4903 Interactive Graphic Unit, which drew crosshairs on the 4002 (this capability was built into the later models), and the 4951 Joystick. This hardware allowed the user to select any point on a display, and to input its coordinates to a computer, allowing support of a CAD system.

The 4010 series was also used as the basis for two self-hosted systems. The Tektronix 4050 series used the 4010 or 4014 with internal processors and a DC300 tape unit to produce a simple desktop unit. There were three models: the original 4010-based 4051 with an 8-bit processor, the 4052 with a 16-bit processor, and the 4054 which combined the 4014 screen with the 4052 logic. The 4081 was a version with an Interdata 7/16 minicomputer built into an office desk, which saw limited use. Tektronix continued selling the basic storage tubes to OEMs, the 19-inch version as the GMA101 and 102 (the former offering roughly twice the drawing speed) and the 25-inch as the GMA125.

Tektronix also sold a set of graphics software routines in FORTRAN known as PLOT10 that converted simple inputs like lists of numbers into a graphic display such as a chart. Another common solution was the DISSPLA software system, which was adapted to run on the 4010.

The command format for sending graphics to the terminals was very simple, and was soon copied by a number of other terminal vendors. This de facto standard for encoding graphical information was later ported to traditional video terminals using raster scan displays, although these generally offered lower resolution, perhaps half that of the 4010. A number of these emulations also understood the color codes from the Tektronix 4105 raster scan terminal, which added color to the original 4010 command set. This graphical data standard continues to be emulated by newer terminals to this day; NCSA Telnet and xterm can emulate the 4014 (codice_1).

==Principles of operation==

Conventional modern video displays consist of a series of images, or &quot;frames&quot;, representing single snapshots in time. When the frames are updated rapidly enough, changes in those images provide the illusion of continuous motion. Computer displays, where the image is generally static for extended periods of time (for example, a page of text), required a stationary, more-precise, flicker-free image, as compared to television displays available at the time. A modern solution is to use additional hardware and computer memory to store the image between each update, a section of memory known as a framebuffer.

In the 1960s, memory based on core was extremely expensive, generally priced in dollars or cents per bit. Solid-state memory was even more expensive, and could only be used for a handful of high-speed working storage registers in data processing hardware.

If one wanted to store a screen of text at 80 columns by 25 lines and using 7-bit ASCII, one would require 8025 = , making the price of the terminal prohibitive. The cost would be even more if the terminal needed to display graphics. For instance, a graphics terminal supporting 1-bit points (on/off) at resolution would require 1024768 = of memory, likely more than the cost of the computer it connected to. One solution to reduce the amount of memory required was to represent the image not as dots, but straight-line &quot;vectors&quot;. In this case, only the endpoints have to be stored in memory, and additional hardware draws between them to produce the display. A coordinate within that same 1,024 resolution space requires (210), so if a display can hold 1000 vectors in total, it requires per end = . The IBM 2250 graphics terminal used this solution, and sold for .

Tektronix had originally developed their storage tubes in the late 1950s as a way to store images on oscilloscope displays for study, although the same system had already been used in radar displays. The basic concept used a conventional CRT layout, but with two sets of electron guns. One, the &quot;flood gun&quot;, provided a constant flow of low-energy electrons covering the entire screen, causing it to glow faintly. The second source, the &quot;write gun&quot;, resembled the normal gun of a black and white TV, and its beam was moved about on the display surface in the conventional fashion by using electromagnetic coils.

However, this write gun was set to a higher than normal energy. When its beam struck the screen, it caused an effect known as photoemission that expelled electrons from the light-emitting phosphors and towards the front of the display, where they were drained away by a thin transparent electrode. The &quot;written&quot; patch of the phosphor now contained fewer electrons than normal, giving it a positive charge relative to its surroundings. This caused more of the electrons from the flood gun to be continuously attracted to that spot, which kept it emitting an intermediate intensity of light. Thus, a complex image could be &quot;stored&quot; in the same light-emitting phosphors which made the image visible to the user.

==Display capabilities and limitations==

A display using this technique was instantly recognizable by the bright flash of the high-energy write gun beam as it rapidly moved about the display, &quot;painting&quot; the screen with complex lines and patterns. The stored image glowed brighter than the characteristic faint background glow of the entire display screen. The display was always monochrome, in three different brightnesses of &quot;CRT green&quot;.

The storage tube technology was vulnerable to screen burn-in, as the continuous flow of electrons illuminating a stored image gradually degraded the light-emitting phosphors over a long period of time. To reduce the rate of display degradation, the hardware was designed to blank the electron beams after a period of inactivity on the screen. Software screensaver programs were not useful in protecting storage tube display screens from burn-in of images.

Also, complex and precise images would gradually become more diffused and blurry, as the stored charges on the phosphors slowly migrated and diffused away from their original locations. The only way to correct this gradual blurring was to erase and redraw the entire screen.

Because the display tube itself stored the image, there was no need for any sort of auxiliary graphics memory, greatly lowering the cost of the terminal. The 4010 cost $3,950, almost two orders of magnitude less expensive than IBM&#x27;s competing graphics displays. This made very complex and detailed computer graphics practical for a much wider audience. The Tektronix approach also had the advantage that there was no limit to the number of vectors that can be displayed; one could simply keep adding them to a complex image, whereas a solution like the IBM terminal had a limited number of vectors it could refresh on its display. Early CAD systems made by companies such as Computervision took full advantage of the graphic storage capability, and were able to display arbitrarily complex designs without annoying flicker.

The main disadvantage of storage tubes was that once an image was stored, it could only be removed by erasing the entire image. This made such screens unsuitable for working with scrolling text, animation, or any other display where portions of the image were continuously changing. Some early CAD workstations employed both a video terminal to display frequently changing text, and a Tektronix display showing complex graphics images.

Tektronix introduced the &quot;write through&quot; concept for non-stored vectors, but with the terminal itself lacking any memory, the data had to be continually refreshed from the host computer. The communications speed of the connection between the terminal and host limited the number of refreshed objects that could be supported, and was often in the range of a few dozen graphic elements. Another disadvantage is that it required a brief interval for the image to &quot;store&quot; on the display screen, which limited the maximum speed with which the image could be drawn. Tektronix referred to this as the &quot;stored writing speed&quot;, and measured it in terms of vector-inches-per-second, with ratings between 1500 and 4000 being typical for their displays.

==Technical description==

===Mechanical layout===
The 401x series physically consisted of a large CRT display sitting on top of a wheeled cart. The cart held most of the electronics in a vertical case at the back, which could be opened from the front to access various switches and jumpers, as well as providing access to the expansion cards. Inside the enclosure, expansion cards were connected via the Tektronix proprietary &quot;Minibus&quot; system, using a 36-pin card connector with an 8-bit data bus. In addition to the communications card and various enhancements, an optional &quot;Desk-Top Mounting Kit&quot; allowed the CRT to be placed on a desk, while the electronics cart was connected to it using a cable up to away. The overall build quality of the Tektronix 4010 was excellent, with gold-plated boards of high-quality epoxy fiberglass material. 

===Interfacing===
The 4010 used a Minibus card to handle communications with the host computer, and a wide variety of host interfaces were available. The 4014 terminal was normally shipped with the standard Communications Interface installed, offering an RS-232 connection, although only the most important connector pins were supported. Setup configuration was handled entirely by electrical jumpers, so there was no way for the terminal to change these settings while connected. As an alternative to the Communications Interface, the TTY Interface allowed the terminal to be connected to a 20-mA current-loop teletype interface, which was still widely used by mainframe computers of that era. Direct interfaces using proprietary serial or parallel connections were also available for most mainframe systems.

===Text display===
In &quot;alpha mode&quot;, the 4010 displayed 35 lines of 74 characters. The terminal was &quot;dumb&quot; by standards of the day, lacking various smart terminal features like addressable cursor positioning. The terminal also lacked any significant data buffering, and many slower operations could lead to data loss. For example, the carriage return took about 100 to 200 μs, and a screen clear operation much longer than that, on the order of a second. It was up to the host computer to delay further data to avoid it being lost during these refractory periods.

One peculiar feature was a second margin at the 35th character, allowing lines to be limited between the left side of the screen and that midpoint for margin 0, or that midpoint and the right side of the screen for margin 1. This was useful for mixing graphics and text, or displaying two columns of text. Switching between the columns was accomplished by moving to the very last line in any given column and pressing line feed on the keyboard. The cursor would then reappear at the top of the next column. There was no attempt to limit drawing to within these borders, so it was up to the host software to ensure that lines remained within the margins by inserting CR/LF characters at appropriate points. Text lines writing to margin 0 would extend the full length of the screen if CR/LF was not sent to wrap before the 35th character, although any data in the margin 1 area on the same line, being written later, would be drawn on top.

The terminals also optionally supported a second character set via plug-in circuit boards, selecting between them with the ASCII and characters. This was required for the APL language, which used a large number of special characters.

===Graphics protocol===
The 4010 was not a raster display and thus had an effectively unlimited resolution, but the command decoding circuitry limited this to 1,024 by 1,024. Because the screen had a 4:3 geometry, only 780 points were visible vertically. The origin was in the lower left.

Encoding values from 0 to 1,023 required 10 bits; 2^10 = 1024. These values were encoded in ASCII, using 5 bits per character, and thus requiring two characters per value, or 4 characters for a complete X,Y coordinate. The encoding scheme was designed to make the coordinate characters safely sent over serial links by assigning each value from the set of ASCII printable characters. X values were assigned the 32 characters between 64 and 95 decimal, mostly the uppercase letters. The Y coordinates are given a similar range from 96 to 127, mostly the lowercase letters. To convert location to an ASCII character code, one added 64 to the X value, and 96 to the Y value. High-order bits for either were the same, from the range 32 to 63, mostly numerals and punctuation.

So the complete formula for calculating the points from the characters was:

 X = 32 x (high X character ASCII value - 32) + (low X character ASCII value - 64)
 Y = 32 x (high Y character ASCII value - 32) + (low Y character ASCII value - 96)

Although the manuals always showed the calculation for X before Y, and low-order character before high-order, the four characters actually had to be transmitted in the opposite order, starting with the high Y, then low Y, high X and finally low X. For instance, consider the coordinate (23, 142). The X coordinate falls within the range 0 to 31, so no shifting is required. Adding 23 to 64 gives 87, which is ASCII character , and since no shift is required the &quot;shift character&quot; is . For the Y coordinate 142, one would need to shift the number back to the range 0 to 31, which could be done by subtracting 128. Doing so leaves 14. Adding 14 to 96 to get the first character gives 110, or . This requires shifting by 128, which is 4 x 32, so the shift character is the fifth in the sequence (the first is zero shift, the space), or . Now the characters are ordered shift-Y, Y, shift-X, X, so the complete coordinate (23, 142) would be encoded as .

Each of these four coordinate characters is stored in a buffer in the terminal, which holds them until the complete coordinate is received and then drawn. The drawing process is triggered by the reception of the low-X character, which the terminal looks for by waiting for a bit pattern that indicates it is in the proper decimal range. This allows a short-cut way to send points that share a Y coordinate by sending only the X coordinates, even just the low-X if the high-X has not changed. This can greatly reduce the total number of characters sent to the terminal if the programmer arranges the data to minimize changes in Y over a given set of coordinates, and even more if they group together points that change only in low-X and low-Y. The overall effect can roughly halve the amount of data sent to the terminal.

Graphics are drawn by entering &quot;graph mode&quot; by sending the ASCII Group Separator (GS) character (). After that every set of four characters (or less) received by the terminal are used to define an X,Y coordinate. The first four following the GS position the graphic cursor, every point after that draws a vector on the display. The system is returned to text mode (&quot;alpha mode&quot; in their documents) using a number of commands, typically Unit Separator (US, ), but a number of other sequences also have the same effect, including a .

Because the system draws vectors from point to point while in graphics mode, in order to draw separated lines the commands had to enter and exit graphics mode repeatedly. A single point is drawn by entering graph mode at the desired coordinate, drawing a zero length vector to the same coordinate.

===Graphics input===
For graphics input, the terminal used a pair of thumb wheels on the keyboard to control the position of a cursor. The cursor was displayed using a lower intensity of the electron beam that had insufficient energy to cause the storage system to trigger. The cursor was dynamically refreshed by the electronics of the terminal. The cursor was turned on with () (which also turned off graphic mode if it was on), and then (). The position was sent back to the computer using the same X,Y encoding as the graphics commands. This could be done interactively by sending the and then pressing a key on the keyboard, or immediately by the host sending .

===Changes in 4014 model===
The 4014 series had a number of minor changes and some more major improvements.

In alpha mode, the font could be scaled to produce a number of different line sizes. The original 4010-style 35 lines by 74 characters was the default, or could be selected specifically with . drew smaller glyphs to produce 38 lines of 81 characters, for 58 by 121, and for 64 by 133. All of these could be mixed on-screen.

In the 4010, the cursor and graphic crosshairs were interactive and used &quot;dark mode&quot; to move about the screen without writing to memory. This was accomplished by writing with less energy in the beam, just enough to be seen but not enough to store it. The 4014 added escape codes to allow the user to select this mode deliberately by sending any of the sequences from through . This was especially useful in graph mode, as it allowed the system to draw movable objects, although at the cost of having to continually refresh them over the serial link at about 30 times a second in order to avoid flicker.

This capability could be used, for instance, by drawing the outline of a gauge and its scale markers normally to cause them to store, and then drawing the needle interactively using dark mode. It could also be used to move the graphics cursor to a new location without having to exit and re-enter graphics mode, which previously was the only way to accomplish this. Sending through set the terminal to &quot;defocussed mode&quot; which drew at reduced intensity by making the beam slightly wider and spreading the displayed line over a wider area. Finally, through returned the terminal to the normal storage mode.

The 4014 made a change to the way graphics points were entered by adding an &quot;execution character&quot; which denoted that a particular coordinate was complete. This allowed, for instance, the X or Y coordinate to be changed without changing the previously stored location for the other. This was useful for drawing boxes or especially a series of lines like an axis, or drawing a point on the screen by sending in the same address as the one last stored or moved to using dark mode. Since the X and Y coordinates used separate characters, the terminal would still notice a sequence of coordinates being sent in the older 4010 format, and draw them as they arrived, providing backward compatibility.

With the Enhanced Graphic Module installed, an additional set of features were available. Primary among these was the addition of &quot;12-bit addressing&quot; which increased the resolution to 4096 by 4096, again with the upper section of the Y axis above 3120 being unseen. Any address could be sent in 12-bit mode simply by sending in an &quot;extra byte&quot; between the high and low Y characters, using the same character range as the low-order Y addresses. On a 4010 series terminal or 4014 without the Enhanced Graphic Module, this extra byte would then immediately be overwritten by the actual low-order address that arrived as the next character, and thus have no effect. With the Enhanced Graphic Module, the terminal would use bits 1 and 2 to add to the front of the normally 5-bit high-order X address, and bits 3 and 4 to add to the high-order Y address.

Another feature of the Enhanced Graphic Module was circuitry that periodically interrupted the beam as it was drawing a vector, allowing the creation of dashed lines. There were five patterns in total; lines, dots, dash-dot and short and long dashes. These were useful for drawing axes and scales, especially when combined with the defocussed mode to lower the intensity, and using the change-one-coordinate feature to quickly draw them. These were selected using the same escape characters as the drawing mode selection of the normal 4014, the range through . For instance, without the Enhanced Graphics installed, sending any character from to selected normal line drawing mode, while with the module installed was normal drawing, was normal with dotted lines, and so on.

Incremental plot, entered with the ASCII Record Separator (RS) character, replaced the normal coordinates with single-character directions. For instance, sending moved up (&quot;north&quot;). This was especially useful for drawing control needles and similar moving displays, and greatly reduces the amount of information that has to be sent to the terminal over time.

The Enhanced Graphic Module introduced two point plotting modes. Entering the normal &quot;point plot&quot; mode with the ASCII File Separator (FS), instead of RS for graph mode, plotted only the points at the coordinates being sent, not the vectors between them. &quot;Special point plot&quot;, entered with , added an &quot;intensity character&quot; to the coordinate that allowed the points to have various brightnesses and optionally defocus the beam.

==Criticisms==
Predecessors of some technical components origin from Tektronix&#x27; measurement equipment. For example, the module cards are relatively small in relation to the large pedestal housing. Possibly this is also the reason for surprisingly different design concepts for similar functions. On one hand, the bell sound appears to be overengineered: It is all-digital, generating an audio frequency from the main crystal-controlled divider chain. While this provides much more precision and stability than necessary, some may perceive the sound as rather dull and non-bell-like. On the other hand, the serial clock for the daisy-chained teletype is generated with an analog circuit. It uses an unijunction RC oscillator, which had to be manually tuned to 110 baud. This is not very stable: After a few hours, heat buildup could cause the frequency to drift enough to cause serial line timing errors. So in this case, a derivation from the divider chain might have served the purpose much better.

<text>A spokestoon is an established cartoon character who is hired to endorse a product.

When the United States entered World War II, well-known celebrities already highly placed in American popular culture, such as Donald Duck and Bugs Bunny, joined the war effort, donating their highly visible images for patriotic and informative cartoons. Bambi, loaned by Walt Disney during 1943 to the US Forest Service, was the precursor of the purposely-created Smokey.

Spokestoons have also lent their celebrity status to individual events, such as Pogo for Earth Day in 1970, or The Smurfs to UNICEF in 2005.

Since then, many high-profile cartoon characters have turned their skills to corporate product placement. Though fast food franchises have used gimmicks to tie-in temporarily with current releases of animated features since the 1950s, a few cartoons have become more permanently associated with a product or service offered by corporate culture, similar to that of a mascot, and may be considered genuine spokestoons.

Early recorded usages of the term &quot;spokestoon&quot; include a March 25, 1995, feature in the Portland, Maine &quot;Press Herald&quot;, noting &quot;Buster Brown, the comic strip character who became the &#x27;spokestoon&#x27; for the children&#x27;s shoe line&quot;, and an October 1995 article about the Disney Corporation&#x27;s use of characters from &quot;The Lion King&quot; to promote good nutrition in children.

Some examples of spokestoons and the products they are identified with include:

*Dennis the Menace for Dairy Queen until 2002
*Donald Duck for Donald Duck orange juice
*Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble for Winston cigarettes, Post&#x27;s Pebbles, and Flintstones vitamins
*Little Lulu for Kleenex
*Bugs Bunny for Tang, Kool-Aid, and Weetabix
*Gumby for Cheerios
*&quot;Peanuts&quot; characters for the Ford Falcon car, Dolly Madison snacks, and Metropolitan Life Insurance
*Mickey Mouse for Disney Mickey&#x27;s Magix breakfast cereal
*The Pink Panther for Owens Corning fiberglass thermal insulation, and Sweet&#x27;n Low artificial sweetener
*The Road Runner for Charter Communications&#x27;s Road Runner (now Spectrum) internet service and AutoNation
*&quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; characters for Family Fun Center, General Mills, and Taco Bell
*&quot;The Simpsons&quot; characters for Nestlé&#x27;s Butterfinger candy bars and Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Vizir laundry detergent 
*&quot;Underdog&quot; characters for Family Fun Center
*&quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; characters for Disney Hunny B&#x27;s Honey-Graham breakfast cereal
*&quot;Yogi Bear&quot; characters for Yogi Bear Toastee Tarts
*&quot;Huey, Dewey and Louie&quot; for Nestle&#x27;s Trio

<doc id="912995" wikidata="Q802262" url="?curid=912995" title="Klondike Highway">
<text>The Klondike Highway is a highway that runs from the Alaska Panhandle through the province of British Columbia and the territory of Yukon in Canada, linking the coastal town of Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson City, Yukon. Its route somewhat parallels the route used by prospectors in the 1898 Klondike Gold Rush.

In both British Columbia and Yukon, the highway is marked as Yukon Highway 2. In Alaska, the Highway is marked as Alaska Route 98 (as in &quot;route of 1898&quot;). Until 1978, the unopened section between the Yukon–BC border and Carcross had no official highway number, while the section north of Carcross to the Alaska Highway was Highway 5, and the section from Stewart Crossing to Dawson was Highway 3. The BC section is now maintained by the Yukon government as a natural extension of Highway 2.

==Route description==

The Klondike Highway winds in the state of Alaska for , up through the White Pass in the Coast Mountains where it crosses the Canada–US border to British Columbia (BC) for , then enters Yukon where it reaches the Alaska Highway near Whitehorse and shares a short section with that highway until north of Whitehorse, where it diverges once more to Dawson City. The highway is long.

==History==
===South Klondike Highway===
The original section known locally as the Carcross Road was actually made into a part of the Alaska Highway in 1942, until the Marsh Lake route was opened the next year. As Yukon Highway 5, it formed a loop road with Highway 6, the Tagish Road (now numbered as 8). It was renumbered as Highway 2 in 1978, being incorporated into the Klondike Highway designation. The road underwent alignment improvements during the 1980s. Residents living as far south as from the Alaska Highway still give their residential addresses as historic mile measurements that start at zero at the Alaska Highway, even though the distances are no longer accurate, and kilometre posts count distance from Skagway&#x27;s ferry terminal.

Construction of the &quot;Carcross-Skagway Road&quot; began in the 1950s, was abandoned partway up a mountain from Skagway, and resumed in 1976-1977 when the Captain William Moore Bridge was constructed. The entire road was completed between Skagway and Carcross in August 1978. It was only open for a few weeks before seasonal closure. The first full summer season of use was in 1979.

The highway originally was built for tourist traffic, but in 1986 became important as a commercial transportation route, coincident with what seemed to be inevitable abandonment of the White Pass and Yukon Route railway (WP&amp;YR). The new owners of the Faro mine secured government agreement to open the highway for trucking. The last winter closure ended in the spring of 1986.

The Carcross-Skagway Road portion of the highway underwent substantial rerouting, widening and (cold mix) paving in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Mining ore trucks and fuel tankers are the primary current (2013) commercial users of the highway, which also remains a popular tourist route (cars, RVs, buses), and provides a means for the WP&amp;YR to offer economically-priced train excursions connecting at Fraser to buses based at Skagway for the cruise ship industry, or to/from Carcross and Whitehorse to the north.

===North Klondike Highway===
The quality of roads from Whitehorse to Dawson City prior to 1950 was poor and only for the hardiest of travelers and motorized vehicles. The &quot;Whitehorse-Mayo Road,&quot; Yukon&#x27;s original Highway 2, extended along today&#x27;s route from Whitehorse to Stewart Crossing, then turned northeast to Mayo, Elsa and Keno City. The last of three bridges was finished in 1960 to replace ferries at Carmacks, Pelly Crossing and Stewart Crossing.

Yukon&#x27;s original Highway 3, the Dawson-Mayo Road, was opened in September 1955 between Stewart Crossing and Dawson City. The Dawson-Mayo Road became part of Highway 2 in 1978 and was named the Klondike Highway, while the road northeast from Stewart Crossing became Highway 11, and was later named the Silver Trail.

Even as of 1979, the entire Klondike Highway was gravel, but by 1982, some paving had been laid down as far north as Carmacks. Rebuilding and some rerouting was completed in the late 1980s.

Approximately, the first of the North Klondike Highway are still often known as the Mayo Road to the residents of Whitehorse. Although kilometric distance markers have been in place since the early 1980s, residents in this area still identify their residential address as a mile measurement along the Mayo Road.

<doc id="912999" wikidata="Q1890066" url="?curid=912999" title="N (video game)">
<text>N (stylized as n) is a freeware video game developed by Metanet Software. It was inspired in part by &quot;Lode Runner&quot;, &quot;Soldat&quot;, and other side-scrolling games. It was the first of the &quot;N&quot; series, followed by &quot;N+&quot; and &quot;N++&quot;. &quot;N&quot; won the audience choice award in the downloadables category of the 2005 Independent Games Festival.

== Gameplay ==

In &quot;N&quot;, the player controls a ninja who navigates tile-based levels while simultaneously avoiding hazards, collecting gold, and eventually opening an exit door which completes the level. Gameplay involves four keys—a move-left key (default left arrow), a move-right key (default right arrow), jumping (default shift key, though z key is a common alternative), and suicide (default k key). Combinations of moving and jumping on various types of terrain allow the ninja to perform a variety of movements, such as jumping from wall to wall, climbing up vertical inclines, and sliding down steep surfaces.

Version 1.4 of &quot;N&quot; contains 100 episodes (numbered 00 to 99), while version 2.0 contains 120 episodes (due to two bonus columns being unlockable after the completion of the main game episodes). Each episode in all iterations of the game features five levels (numbered 0 to 4). &quot;N&quot; also supports user-made levels. This is done through a built-in level editor called &quot;NEd&quot;, or the &quot;N Editor&quot;. Levels can be added into a game by modifying a text file accompanying the game that contains user level data.

&quot;N 1.4&quot; has a total of 500 maps, 450 of which are made by Metanet Software; &quot;2.0&quot; contains 600 levels, 500 of which are made by Metanet Software. The remaining 50 levels in &quot;1.4&quot; are aforementioned user levels that were hand-picked by Metanet in 2005, while the remaining 100 levels in &quot;2.0&quot; were user-made levels selected by a panel of fans in late 2012 and were finalized by Metanet Software in 2013. (The team behind the shortlist selection were listed in the game&#x27;s credits under their respective aliases.) The goal of each level is to trigger the switch and exit through the door it opens within the time limit. Some levels have more than one exit and associated switch, giving the player more freedom to decide their route and method of completing the map. Each episode is given a cumulative time limit. At the beginning of level 0, the player is given 90 seconds to complete the next five levels. The episode&#x27;s time limit can be increased by collecting gold, which adds two seconds per piece. The time left at the end of each level carries over to the next level. The only exception is the final level, in which the time left becomes that episode&#x27;s score.

== Development ==
Five years after &quot;N 1.4&quot; release, on June 1, 2010, Metanet Software announced on the forums and on the Metablog that they were going to definitely start with &quot;N 1.5&quot;. They created some threads in the forums that discussed every new aspect of the new version of &quot;N&quot;, asking for the players feedback, and asking the players their opinions. In December 2011, a demo of the &quot;N v2.0&quot; beta was released in the form of a &quot;contesque&quot;. Players who ranked highly in each section were awarded with prize packs, including T-shirts, &quot;N+&quot; download codes, stickers, buttons and more. On January 1, 2013, version 2.0 was released as a full beta, complete with a new physics engine written in ActionScript 3.0. The official release added new episodes, bonus content and minor bug fixes; it is also the final free release for PC. 

==Sequels==
&quot;N+&quot; was released on the Xbox Live Arcade, Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in 2008, featuring multiplayer modes, and map editing and sharing.

&quot;N++&quot; was released on PlayStation 4 in 2015; it has since been released on Windows, OS X, Linux, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.

<text>1 Squadron SAAF was an air force squadron of the South African Air Force and was formed at Air Force Station Swartkop in February 1920, equipped with De Havilland DH.9s part of the Imperial Gift donation to South Africa by Britain. On 31 August 1939 the squadron was re-designated as 1 Bomber/Fighter Squadron and this was then changed to 11 (Bomber) Squadron in December 1939. The squadron was resurrected in February 1940 by the renumbering of 6 Squadron, equipped with four Hurricane Mk 1s and six Furies.

1 Squadron saw active service in East Africa in 1940, the Western Desert, Malta, and Sicily, and ended their war service in Italy in 1945. In 1950 the squadron&#x27;s Spitfires were replaced with Vampires, and these in turn were replaced by Sabre Mk6s in 1956. In 1976 the squadron received Mirage F1AZ attack aircraft and it was disbanded when the F1AZs were retired on 25 November 1997.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
There had been no official squadron designations in the South African Air Force (SAAF) from its inception in 1920 until the early 1938 when 1 and 2 Transvaal Air Squadrons were formed as training units based at Waterkloof Air Station which had been opened earlier that year. Each squadron comprised 18 aircraft, divided into 3 flights each, plus a headquarters or administrative flight per squadron. Each flight was structured to form the working nucleus of a squadron. A flight of SE5s was to be the cadre of a fighting/ground strafing squadron; Avro 504Ks of a training and artillery spotter squadron, and DH9s were to form the cadre of a long-distance communication, photographic, bombing, and reconnaissance squadron.

=== World War II ===
On 31 August 1939, 1 Transvaal Air Squadron was re-designated as 1 (Fighter-Bomber) Squadron, and the original aircraft were replaced with Hawker Hartebeest. It took until May 1940 for the squadron to be trained and brought up to strength, by when it had been equipped with four Hurricanes and six Furies and was officially titled &quot;1 (Fighter) Squadron,&quot; commanded by Maj. N.G. Niblock-Stuart. The squadron was the first SAAF squadron to deploy in support of the Allied war effort, when a group of pilots and support staff were ferried to Egypt on 13 May 1940 by 50 Squadron. Once they had arrived in Egypt, they were equipped with 18 Gloster Gladiators.

At the same time, the Hurricanes were ferried north from Pretoria on 22 and 24 May, accompanied by a Ju86 carrying the maintenance crews and arrived in Nairobi at the end of May. The squadron&#x27;s Fury aircraft were flown from Pretoria to Durban for crating and were then shipped to Mombasa on SS Takliwa, embarking on 26 May and arriving in East Africa on 1 June 1940 where the Furies were un-crated and re-assembled. By early June the pilots from Egypt had married up with their aircraft in East Africa and were declared operational.

==== East Africa ====
The squadron&#x27;s first operational mission was an attack on the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; air base at Yavello in Abyssinia, on 17 June 1940. The task of the two Hurricanes was to escort three Junkers Ju 86 bombers from 12 Sqn in the attack on the airfield. The attack destroyed airport infrastructure as well as six Caproni Ca 133s on the ground. But a couple of Fiat CR.32s from 412ª &quot;Squadriglia&quot; had scrambled as soon as the South Africans had been spotted. The two Italian pilots severely damaged one of the Ju 86s, then shot down one of the Hurricanes Capt St E. Truter, in the second Hurricane, reacted: he attacked and chased away the CR.32 flown by &quot;Tenente&quot; Aldo Meoli, that flipped over when it landed.

The squadron&#x27;s Hurricanes, Gladiators and Hartbeest aircraft continued to provide fighter cover but by late 1940 the Hartbeest were proving to be no longer a match for the Italian Fiat CR.42 Falcos and one flight consisting of Hartbeest and Gladiators was split off from the squadron to form the nucleus of 2 Fighter Bomber Squadron. The squadron then continued operating with the remaining Gladiators and Hurricanes from airfields in Abyssinia and Sudan until the fall of Addis Ababa on 5 April 1941. Although the East African campaign continued until November 1941, the absence of Italian fighters permitted the squadron to be moved to the Middle East on 8 April 1941.

From June 1940 to April 1941 the squadron operated from Kenya, Abyssinia, Sudan (Azzoza and Port Sudan), and Eritrea.

==== Western Desert ====

The squadron arrived in April 1941 and scored its first kill on 16 May when Lt. Talbot shot down a Ju 87. The first large-scale deployment was in support of &quot;Operation Brevity&quot; and later in support of &quot;Operation Battleaxe&quot; when Lt. Talbot – the squadron&#x27;s highest scoring ace, with 10 kills at that stage – was shot down and killed. By this stage, the squadron was only flying Hurricanes. During &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; the squadron forced down a German Bf109F, capturing it intact – for which they were congratulated by Air Chief Marshal Tedder for capturing the first of this type of aircraft.

By the time of Operation Crusader the squadron was part of No. 258 Wing RAF, under the direct command of Air Headquarters Western Desert.

On 3 July 1942, the squadron was intercepting a German raid on the Alamein area while No. 272 Squadron RAF was providing them with top cover. The formation came across 15 Junkers Ju 87s escorted by 7 Bf109s; 274 Sqn attacked the Bf109s whilst 1 Sqn went after the Ju 87s. In what was later to become known as the &quot;1 Squadron Stuka Party&quot; the squadron destroyed 14 Ju 87s, damaged two, and shot down one of the Bf109s for the loss of just one aircraft (Lt Ray Connell, who crash-landed at Burgh-el-Arab after a rear gunner destroyed his oil pump) in a forty-five-minute engagement.

During the second Battle of El Alamein, the squadron was tasked with protecting the allied armour in their advance across the start line during the break-out phase, where squadron Hurricanes destroyed a number of Ju 87 Stukas during this phase of the battle. After the Battle of Alamein, the squadron received Spitfires as replacements for their Hawker Hurricanes.

During April 1943, German transport aircraft were freighting supplies to the beleaguered Africa Korps in Tunisia after Allied air and sea interdiction had stopped most of their shipborne supplies coming from Italy. On the 22nd, the squadron Spitfires joined by Kittyhawks from SAAF 2, 4 and 5 Squadrons intercepted 21 huge Me323&#x27;s attempting to bring in fuel (each aircraft carried 10 tons of fuel) to Tunisia. They destroyed 16 Me323s and two of their fighter escorts (one MC.202 and one Re.2001). After this successful intercept, Goering forbade all transport flights to Africa. The decision was overturned two days later after protests from Kesselring, on condition that all future flights were made by night.

During the fighting in the Western Desert in 1941 (while operating under the 6 Squadron designation) they acquired their nickname &quot;The Billy Boys&quot; because whenever successful in combat, the South African pilots would shout &quot;Jou Bielie!&quot; over the radio (roughly translated into British English as &quot;You clever chap!&quot; and into American English as &quot;You Hoss!&quot;).

==== Italy ====
By July 1943, 1 Sqn had ceased operations in North Africa and were then tasked with patrolling the beaches where the landings for the invasion of Sicily were to take place. After the successful landings of &quot;Operation Husky&quot; and the subsequent exploitation, the squadron moved to Sicily on 14 July. After 38 days in Sicily, the squadron again provided cover for the British landings in Italy on 3 September 1943 to be followed by them providing fighter cover at the Anzio landings on 22 January 1944. The squadron then moved to Italy and supported the assault on Rome, claiming 16 enemy aircraft destroyed during this battle. 1 Squadron remained in Italy for the rest of the war operating as a fighter squadron but also flying ground attack sorties towards the end of the Italian campaign. In June 1945 the squadron began to convert to the North American Mustangs, but by July 1945, when the squadron&#x27;s personnel started to return to South Africa, only a few Mustangs had been delivered.

=== Postwar to disbandment ===

After the end of the war, the number of SAAF aircraft were greatly reduced, many being scrapped or sold at nominal prices. By June 1946, the squadron was assigned to 7 Wing SAAF based at AFB Waterkloof, flying Harvards but still retaining the Spitfires. In 1947 the concept of the Active Citizen Force was introduced whereby permanent force pilots would fly the squadron aircraft in the week and citizen force pilot officers would pilot the same Harvards and Spitfires over the weekends. Because of the Citizen Force association with the squadron, its name was changed to 1 &quot;City of Pretoria&quot; Squadron.

By 1954 all of the squadron&#x27;s Spitfires were retired and replaced by Sabre Mk6s in 1956. Additional new aircraft types were procured and by 1957 the squadron had 16 Sabres, 12 Vampires and 12 Harvards on strength.

The squadron was later reequipped with the Impala Mk. I and then the Mirage F1AZ, operating from Hoedspruit until its disbandment on 25 November 1997. It saw combat during the South African Border War in SWA/Angola.

<doc id="913005" wikidata="Q5079897" url="?curid=913005" title="Charles Kushner">
<text>Charles Kushner (born May 16, 1954) is a convicted felon, disbarred attorney and American real estate developer who founded Kushner Companies in 1985. In 2024, he was nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as United States Ambassador to France during his second administration.

In 2005, Kushner was convicted of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering, and was sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment, which he served in the Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery. As a convicted felon, he was also disbarred in three states. He later received a pardon issued by his son&#x27;s father-in-law President Donald Trump on December 23, 2020. Kushner has donated significant amounts to Trump&#x27;s campaigns. Previously, he was a major Democratic party donor.

His elder son Jared is the husband of Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the President of the United States Donald Trump, during whose first presidential administration he served as senior advisor from 2017 to 2021. He has three other children, including his younger son Joshua, a venture capitalist who is married to the supermodel Karlie Kloss. 

In November 2024, Trump stated his intention to nominate Kushner as the United States ambassador to France for his second term.

== Early life==
Charles Kushner was born on May 16, 1954, to Joseph Berkowitz and Rae Kushner, Jewish Holocaust survivors born in eastern Poland who came to America from the USSR in 1949. At birth, he was named Chanan, after a maternal uncle who died in a concentration camp during the Holocaust. He grew up in Elizabeth, New Jersey, with his elder brother Murray Kushner and sister Esther Schulder. His father worked as a construction worker, builder, and real estate investor. Kushner graduated from the Hofstra University School of Law in 1979.

== Career ==
=== Kushner Companies ===
In 1985, Kushner began managing his father&#x27;s portfolio of 4,000 New Jersey apartments. He founded Kushner Companies – headquartered in Florham Park, New Jersey – and became its chairman. In 1999, he won the Ernst &amp; Young New Jersey Entrepreneur of the Year award. At the time, Kushner Companies had grown to more than 10,000 residential apartments, a homebuilding business, commercial and industrial properties, and a community bank.

===Criminal conviction and pardon ===
On June 30, 2004, Kushner was fined $508,900 by the Federal Election Commission for contributing to Democratic political campaigns in the names of his partnerships when he lacked authorization to do so. In 2005, following an investigation by United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey Chris Christie negotiated a plea agreement with him, under which Kushner pleaded guilty to 18 counts of illegal campaign contributions, tax evasion, and witness tampering. The witness tampering charge arose from Kushner&#x27;s retaliation against William Schulder, his sister Esther&#x27;s husband, who was cooperating with federal investigators against Kushner. Kushner hired a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law, arranging to record a sexual encounter between the two and send the tape to his sister. He was sentenced to two years in prison and served 14 months at Federal Prison Camp, Montgomery in Alabama before being sent to a halfway house in Newark, New Jersey, to complete his sentence. He was released from prison on August 25, 2006.

As a convicted felon, Charles Kushner was also disbarred and prohibited from practicing law in New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania. Republican Chris Christie, who chaired Trump’s first transition team, said Kushner committed &quot;one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes&quot; he prosecuted.
On December 23, 2020, President Trump issued a full and unconditional pardon to Kushner, his daughter&#x27;s father-in-law, citing his record of &quot;reform&quot; and &quot;charity&quot;.

===New York City real estate===
After being released from prison, Kushner shifted his business activities from New Jersey to New York City. In early 2007, Kushner Companies bought the 666 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan for $1.8 billion. In August 2018, Brookfield Properties signed a 99-year lease for the property, paying $1.286 billion and effectively taking full ownership of the building.

As of the end of 2016, Kushner and his family were estimated to have a net worth of $1.8 billion. He has employed two fellow inmates with whom he became acquainted in prison.

===Donations===
Kushner met personally with Harvard University&#x27;s president and in 1998 donated $2.5 million to Harvard. His son, Jared, was then beginning his senior year of high school, where he was not a particularly good student with test scores below Ivy League standards. Jared was admitted to the Harvard freshman class of 1999.

Before 2016, Kushner was a donor to the Democratic Party. He is on the boards of Touro College, Stern College for Women, Rabbinical College of America, and the United Jewish Communities. Kushner has made other donations to Harvard, Stern College, and United Cerebral Palsy. He donated to the Seryl and Charles Kushner Maternity Unit at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, New Jersey. He contributed to the funding of two schools, Joseph Kushner Hebrew Academy and Rae Kushner Yeshiva High School, also in Livingston, and named them after his parents. Kushner Hall is a building that is named after him on the Hofstra University campus. The campus of Jerusalem&#x27;s Shaare Zedek Medical Center is named the &quot;Seryl and Charles Kushner Campus&quot; in honor of their donation of $20 million.

In August 2015, Kushner donated $100,000 to Donald Trump&#x27;s Make America Great Again PAC, a super PAC supporting Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign for the presidency. Kushner and his wife also hosted a reception for Trump at their Jersey Shore seaside mansion in Long Branch. In 2023, he was one of the largest donors to a Trump super PAC, donating $1 million.

===Nomination as U.S. ambassador to France===
On November 30, 2024, president-elect Trump announced through a social media post that he would nominate Kushner to be the United States ambassador to France in his second term. On February 12, 2025, his nomination was sent to the Senate. His nomination is pending before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<text>Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks (The Saga of Hervör and Heidrek) is a legendary saga from the 13th century combining matter from several older sagas in Germanic heroic legend. It tells of wars between the Goths and the Huns during the 4th century. The final part of the saga, which was likely composed separately from and later than the rest, is a source for Swedish medieval history.

The saga may be most appreciated for its memorable imagery, as seen in a quotation from one of its translators, Nora Kershaw Chadwick, on the invasion of the Huns:

The text contains several poetic sections: the &quot;Hervararkviða&quot;, on Hervor&#x27;s visit to her father&#x27;s grave and her retrieval of the sword Tyrfing; another, the &quot;Hlöðskviða&quot;, on the battle between Goths and Huns; and a third, containing the riddles of Gestumblindi.

It has inspired later writers and derivative works, such as J. R. R. Tolkien when shaping his legends of Middle-earth. His son, Christopher Tolkien translated the work into English as &quot;The Saga of King Heidrek the Wise&quot;.

== Manuscripts ==

There are three medieval recensions of the saga, each of which is an independent witness to its lost archetype, and which together are the basis for all post-medieval manuscripts of the saga. These are known as versions &quot;R&quot;, &quot;H&quot;, and &quot;U&quot;. The saga continued to be copied in manuscript into the nineteenth century, and the relationships of the surviving manuscripts and the ways in which they vary has been studied in detail.

R is the version found in the fifteenth-century parchment manuscript Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, MS 2845, formerly held in the Danish Royal Library at Copenhagen. The manuscript is fragmentary, today containing the saga only into chapter 12, that is within the poem on the battle of Goths and Huns. R is in most respects closest witness to the lost archetype of &quot;Heiðreks saga&quot;.

U is the version best attested in a seventeenth-century paper manuscript, Uppsala, University Library, R 715. Another early witness to parts of this version is the seventeenth-century paper manuscript Copenhagen, Den Arnamagnæanske Samling, AM 203 fol. This contains a copy of R, but where R breaks off it then continues with text from a common ancestor with R 715. The version dramatically reworks the saga, adding a new opening chapter and including alterations sourced from other sagas, including from the &quot;Rímur&quot; reworking of the same tale, the &quot;Hervarar Rímur&quot;.

H (Hauksbók: Reykjavík, Stofnun Árna Magnússonar, AM 544), dates to 1325. This parchment manuscript is today fragmentary, containing the story up to the end of Gestumblindi&#x27;s second riddle, but two early copies (AM 281 4to) and (AM 597b) record parts of H now lost. H is a conflation of an early version of the saga similar to that preserved in R, and the U-version of the saga. Thus although it is found in the earliest surviving manuscript, H is the third known recension of the saga.

There are many other paper manuscripts of the saga that were copied in the seventeenth century from the manuscripts mentioned above. These include AM 192, AM 193, AM 202 k, AM 354 4to, AM 355 4to, and AM 359 a 4to.

==Synopsis==
All the different manuscripts of the saga tell a similar story, though with many variations of detail (in particular, the U- and H-versions open with a mythic tale of Guðmundr of Glæsisvellir).

The saga deals with the sword Tyrfingr and how it was forged and cursed by the dwarfs Dvalinn and Durin for king Svafrlami. Later, Svafrlami loses it to the berserker Arngrímr of Bolmsö. The sword provides a common link throughout the saga, being passed down through the generations in Arngrímr&#x27;s family, particularly the saga&#x27;s main protagonists, Hervör and her son Heiðrekr. This magical sword shares a common property with other mythological weapons such as Dáinsleif and Bödvar Bjarki&#x27;s sword in &quot;Hrolf Kraki&#x27;s Saga&quot; that, once it has been drawn, it cannot be sheathed until it has drawn blood.

Arngrímr passes Tyrfingr to his son Angantýr. Angantýr dies during a &quot;holmganga&quot; (duel) on Samsø against the Swedish hero Hjálmarr, whose friend Örvar-Oddr buries the cursed sword in a barrow with Angantýr&#x27;s body.

Tyrfingr is retrieved from the barrow by Angantýr&#x27;s daughter, the shieldmaiden Hervör, who summons her dead father to claim her inheritance. This section mixes prose with extensive quotations from a poem known today as &quot;Hervarakviða&quot;, which largely comprises dialogue between Hervör and her father.

Then the saga relates how Hervör marries and has a son Heiðrekr, who becomes king of Reiðgotaland. Heiðrekr spends his youth systematically contravening the good advice given to him by his father and fathering sons on several different women. Eventually, he settles down and becomes a wise king. At this point in the saga, Heiðrekr is killed after a riddle contest with Óðinn (who is disguised as Gestumblindi). The riddles of &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; are all in verse and constitute the main surviving evidence for medieval Scandinavian riddling.

After Heiðrekr&#x27;s death, his sons Angantýr and Hlöðr wage a great battle over their father&#x27;s inheritance. Hlöðr is aided by the Huns, to whom his mother belonged, but nonetheless Angantýr defeats and kills him. This section of the saga too quotes extensively from a poem describing this battle between the Huns and Goths.

The end of the saga is only preserved in the U-recension. This version relates that Angantýr had a son, , who was king of Reiðgotaland for a long time. Heiðrekr&#x27;s daughter Hildr was the mother of Hálfdanr the Valiant, who was the father of Ívarr Víðfaðmi. After Ívarr, there follows a list of Swedish kings, both real and semi-legendary, ending with Philip Halstensson. However, this king-list was probably composed separately from the rest of the saga and integrated into it in later redactions.

== Origins and development ==
The saga tells the history of the family of Hervör and Heidrek over several generations. Then, the story turns to the sons of Arngrim, a Viking Age tale also told in the &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;. Next, the tale tells of Hervör, daughter of Angantyr; then of Heidrek son of Hervör. At this point, the setting of the tale changes from the Kingdom of the Goths to somewhere in Eastern Europe ( 4th–5th century); finally, the tale returns to the historically later date. Kershaw considers that the latter part of the tale involving the Huns and Goths has an origin separate from that of the earlier parts and, in chronological time, is actually taking place several centuries earlier.

In addition to attempts to understand the relationship between the events in the saga and real-world historical characters, events, and places (see § Historicity), the manuscripts and contents are also useful to research into the attitudes and cultures of the periods in which they were composed or written down. Hall thinks the text derives ultimately from oral tradition, not from the invention of an author.

Hall believes the poem &quot;Hervararkviða&quot; (or &#x27;The Waking of Angantýr&#x27;) was composed specifically for a narrative closely akin to the tale told in &quot;Heiðreks saga&quot;, as it is consistent in style and forms a consistent narrative link between the events in the tale. Tolkien considers it unequivocally older than the saga itself. The exact nature of the original underlying narrative for the poem is a matter of scholarly debate. Some passages of the poetry in &quot;Heiðreks saga&quot; also appear in variant forms in &quot;Örvar-Odd&#x27;s saga&quot; (lines 97–9, 103-6), and the outline story of the duel between Arngrímr and Hjálmarr also appears in books 5 and 6 of the &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. There are also elemental plot similarities between the saga and &quot;Sturlaugs saga starfsama&quot; up to the point that a protagonist receives the magic sword from a female figure; Hall surmises that the two may share a narrative origin.

The section of the saga concerning Heiðrekr&#x27;s disregard for his father&#x27;s advice is common to a widely known family of tales (called by Knut Liestøl &quot;The Good Counsels of the Father&quot;). In general there are three counsels; in the saga, a set of three (1st, 2nd, and 6th) fit together. Tolkien proposes that after the counsels were introduced into the work, further counsels were added, further extending that theme through the saga.

The poem &quot;Hlöðskviða&quot; (or &quot;Battle of the Goths and Huns&quot;) has numerous analogues that overlap in topical coverage. The oldest of these is thought to be the Old English poem &quot;Widsith&quot;. Several of the characters who appear in the battle of the Goths and Huns appear are mentioned in this poem: Heiðrekr (Heaþoric), Sifka (Sifeca), Hlǫðr (Hliðe), and Angantýr (Incgenþeow). Tolkien considers that the poem, though seemingly considerably altered over time, once formed part of a continuous poetic narrative that gave a complete description of the Goth-Hun conflict and existed as a separate work.

===Historicity of &quot;The Battle of the Goths and Huns&quot;===

In the 17th century, when the Norse sagas became a subject of interest to scholars, they were initially taken as reasonably accurate depictions of historical events. Later, in the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars realized that they were not completely historically accurate.

Carl Christian Rafn considered that the battle between Goths and Huns was a legendary retelling of the battle between the Gothic king Ostrogotha and the Gepid king Fastida, which was described by Jordanes in Ch. 17 of his history of the Goths. Richard Heinzel , in his analysis &quot;Über die Hervararsaga&quot;, suggested the battle described was the same as the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains (451 CE), identifying Angantyr as the Roman general Aetius and Hlothr as the Frankish Chlodio, with the incorporation of parts of the general Litorius, whereas the Vandal Geiseric is the prototype for Gizurr Grytingalithi. proposed alternative attributions for the battles. One, recorded by Paul the Deacon, took place between the Langobards and the &quot;Vulgares&quot; Bulgars; in that battle, &quot;Agelmundus&quot; (Agelmund) was killed, and his sister (conflated with Hervor) is taken prisoner. In the other battle, the new Langobardian king Lamissio is victorious; Much conflates this battle with that of the Goths and Huns. He also identifies the battlefields to be north of the River Danube in the Carpathian Mountains, near modern-day Kraków.

In the latter half of the 19th century, Heinzel&#x27;s theory was predominant and widely accepted. Later, Gustav Neckel and Gudmund Schütte further analyzed the textual and historical information. Neckel placed the events after the death of Attila (d. 453 CE) during the later Gepid-Hun conflicts, whereas Schütte identified either Heithrekr or Heathoric as transformations of the name of the Gepid king Ardaric. In the early 1900s, Henrik Schück and Richard Constant Boer both rejected Heinzel&#x27;s attribution and the link with Attila. Schück split the legend of the strife between brothers from that of the Goth-Hun war, as well as their geographic locations, and identified both sites as being in southern Russia. Boer associated the Dunheithr with the Daugava River but placed the battle further north in central European Russia, in the Valdai Hills.

Further scholarship in the 20th century added more name and place attributions, with Otto von Friesen and Arwid Johannson returning to the western end of the Carpathians; Hermann Schneider placing the Goths in the Black Sea area (Crimean Goths); and Niels Clausen Lukman reanalyzing the tale, not in the context of Jordanes&#x27; history but in that of Ammianus Marcellinus. Lukman shifted the date to 386 CE, when a mass migration of peoples under Odotheus (conflated with Hlothr) was destroyed by the Romans on the Danube; in his reconstruction Heithrekr is the visigothic Athanaric. In an analysis of parts of the tale, identifies the place where Angantyr revenges his father&#x27;s (Heithrekr) killing by slaves as being at the foot of the Carpathians, using linguistic analysis based on consonant shifts (see Grimm&#x27;s Law) in the term &quot;Harvath Mountains&quot;. The place &quot;Árheimar&quot; in &quot;Danparstathir&quot; mentioned in association is unidentified, though &quot;Danpar-&quot; has been assumed to be some form of the river Dnieper. Similarities with the Battle of Nedao (454 CE) have also been noted.

It is a testimony to its great age that names appear in genuinely Germanic forms and not in any form remotely influenced by Latin. Names for Goths appear that ceased to be used after 390 CE, such as &quot;Grýting&quot; (cf. the Latin form &quot;Greutungi&quot;) and &quot;Tyrfing&quot; (cf. the Latin form &quot;Tervingi&quot;). The events take place where the Goths lived during the wars with the Huns. The Gothic capital Árheimar is located on the Dniepr (&quot;...á Danparstöðum á þeim bæ, er Árheimar heita...&quot;), King Heidrek dies in the Carpathians (...&quot;und Harvaða fjöllum&quot;), and the battle with the Huns takes place on the plains of the Danube (...&quot;á vígvöll á Dúnheiði í Dylgjudölum&quot;). The mythical &quot;Myrkviðr&quot; [Mirkwood] that separates the Goths from the Huns appears to correspond to the Maeotian marshes.

==Influence, legacy, and adaptions==
===Old Icelandic literature===
&quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot; was one source for the fifteenth-century Icelandic poem &quot;Ormars rímur&quot; (probably via a now-lost prose saga), in which the hero Ormarr visits his father&#x27;s burial mound to convince his dead father to give him his sword.

=== Other Scandinavian literature ===
Traditions appearing in the saga have also been preserved in several Scandinavian medieval ballads and &quot;rímur&quot;, i.e. the Danish &quot;Angelfyr og Helmer kamp&quot;, the Faroese &quot;Hjálmar og Angantýr&quot;, &quot;Arngrims synir&quot;, &quot;Gátu rima&quot;, and in the Swedish &quot;Kung Speleman&quot;. The Faroese ballad, &quot;Gátu ríma&quot; (&#x27;riddle poem&#x27;) was collected in the 19th century; it is thought by some scholars to derive from the riddle-contest in the saga.

===Hickes&#x27; &quot;The Waking of Angantyr&quot;===
At the beginning of the 18th century, George Hickes published a translation of the &quot;Hervararkviða&quot; in his &quot;Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archæologicus&quot;. Working from Verelius&#x27;s 1671 translations , with the aid of a Swedish scholar, he presented the entire poem in half-line verse similar to that used in Old English poetry (see Old English metre). It was the first full Icelandic poem translated into English, and it aroused interest in England in such works. The work was reprinted in Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Poetical Miscellanies&quot; (1716) and by Thomas Percy in amended form as &quot;The Incantation of Hervor&quot; in his &quot;Five Pieces of Runic Poetry&quot; (1763).

Hickes&#x27;s publication inspired various &quot;Gothic&quot; and &quot;Runic odes&quot; based on the poem, of varying quality and faithfulness to the original. states &quot;[T]he cult of the ubiquitous eighteenth-century poem known as &#x27;The Waking of Angantyr&#x27; can be traced directly to its door.&quot;

===Other adaptions===
The &quot;Hervararkviða&quot; poem was translated fairly closely into verse by Beatrice Barmby and included in her &quot;Gísli Súrsson: a Drama&quot; (1900); and into a more &quot;Old English&quot; style by in &quot;The Norse King&#x27;s Bridal&quot;. &quot;Hjálmar&#x27;s Death-Song&quot; was translated by W. Herbert in his &quot;Select Icelandic Poetry&quot;.

The French poet Charles-Marie-René Leconte de Lisle adapted the &quot;Hervararkviða&quot; in the poem &quot;L’Épée d’Angantyr&quot; [&quot;Angantyr&#x27;s Sword&quot;] in his &quot;Poèmes barbares&quot;.

Swedish composer Wilhelm Stenhammar wrote the opera &quot;Tirfing&quot; as an adaptation of the Hervor-section of the saga using her as the opera&#x27;s lead protagonist.

===J. R. R. Tolkien===
There is much in this saga that readers of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s work will recognize, most importantly the riddle contest. There are, for instance, warriors similar to the Rohirrim, brave shieldmaidens, Mirkwood, haunted barrows yielding enchanted swords (see Barrow-downs), an epic battle, and two dwarfs named Dwalin and Durin.

<doc id="913013" wikidata="Q2356799" url="?curid=913013" title="Roland's Breach">
<text>Roland&#x27;s Breach (; ; ; ; ) is the name of a natural gap, 40 m across and 100 m high, at an elevation of 2,804 m in the Pyrenees on the border of Aragón, northern Spain, and Hautes-Pyrénées, southwestern France.

The gap is situated in the Ordesa y Monte Perdido National Park on the Franco-Spanish border, close to the steep cliffs of the Cirque de Gavarnie.

According to one legend, Roland&#x27;s Breach was cut by Count Roland with his sword Durendal in an attempt to destroy the sword, after being defeated during the Battle of Roncesvalles in 778. In a variant of one of the legends associated with Salto de Roldán, a rock formation about north of Huesca, Roland (), the foremost of Charlemagne&#x27;s paladins, was being hotly pursued by Saracens, the Muslim Arab occupiers of Spain. Cornered at Salto de Roldán, he escaped by leaping the chasm on horseback from one of the crags to the other; the horse died in the attempt. Roland continued northward on foot, and smote the Pyrenees with his sword to create Roland&#x27;s Breach, so that he could see France one last time before he died.

The provenance of this myth is unclear as the Cirque du Gavarnie is approximately 150 km East South East from the Roncesvaux Pass where the legend of Roland is based.

The gap can be reached from the &quot;Refugio Sarradets&quot;, a nearby mountain shelter, in about an hour&#x27;s climb.

<text>James Arthur Ross (8 December 1893 – 1 April 1958) was a Manitoba politician. He served in the House of Commons of Canada for thirteen years, and was a candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1953.

Ross was born in Lyleton, Manitoba, the son of John Alexander Ross and Jessie Mary Sellar, and was educated in Melita and at the Manitoba Agricultural College. He enlisted as a soldier in World War I, served in France, and was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. After the war, he worked as a farmer and served as reeve of Arthur municipality for twelve years. He was also an active Freemason. In 1930, Ross married Hilda Morrison.

Ross ran as a candidate of the Manitoba Conservative Party in the southwestern riding of Arthur for the provincial elections of 1927, 1932 and 1936. He was defeated on all three occasions by candidates of the governing Progressive Party (known after 1932 as the &quot;Liberal-Progressive Party&quot;).

In 1940, Ross was elected to the House of Commons of Canada for the riding of Souris, narrowly defeating Liberal candidate George William McDonald. He was re-elected by a wider margin in 1945, and once again by a narrow margin in 1949. He remained an MP until 1953, serving for the entire time in the opposition Progressive Conservative caucus. Ross retired from federal politics in 1953, after his riding was eliminated by redistribution.

Ross returned to provincial politics for the 1953 provincial election, and was elected for Arthur on his fourth attempt. He defeated John R. Pitt, who had also been his opponent in 1936.

The Conservatives had been led since 1936 by Errick Willis, a figure from the party&#x27;s rural base who was a prominent cabinet minister in the coalition years. Willis had been an ineffective campaigner in the 1953 election, and many Conservatives (including Ross) believed that new leadership would be needed for an electoral breakthrough. In October 1953, Willis bowed to internal pressure and called a leadership convention for the following year. Willis announced that he would stand for re-election; Ross and Dufferin Roblin also declared themselves as candidates.

Ross was unskilled at province-wide campaigning, and was unable to develop an organization comparable with those of Willis and Roblin. He was also damaged by reports that he and other MLAs were preparing to start a new party if Willis was re-elected.

Ross finished third on the first ballot, with 55 votes. Most of his supporters went to Roblin, who won on the second ballot.

Ross died in Melita just before the election of 1958.

<text>Raymonde de Laroche (22 August 1882 – 18 July 1919) was a French pilot, thought to be the first woman to pilot a plane. She became the world&#x27;s first licensed female pilot on 8 March 1910.

She received the 36th aeroplane pilot&#x27;s licence issued by the Aeroclub de France, the world&#x27;s first organization to issue pilot licences. At the time, pilot licences were only required for pilots operating aircraft for commercial purposes.

==Early life==
Born on 22 August 1882 in Paris, France, as Elise Raymonde Deroche, Raymonde De Laroche was the daughter of a plumber. She had a fondness for sports as a child, as well as for motorcycles and automobiles when she was older. As a young woman she became an actress and used the stage name &quot;Raymonde de Laroche&quot;. She was inspired by Wilbur Wright&#x27;s 1908 demonstrations of powered flight in Paris and was personally acquainted with several aviators, including artist-turned-aviator Léon Delagrange, who was reputed to be the father of her son André. Due to all of these inspirations De Laroche was determined to take up flying for herself.

==Achievements in aviation==

In October 1909, de Laroche appealed to her friend, aviator and aeroplane builder Charles Voisin to instruct her in how to fly. On 22 October 1909, de Laroche went to the Voisin brothers&#x27; base of operations at Chalons, east of Paris. Voisin&#x27;s aircraft could seat only one person, so she operated the plane by herself while he stood on the ground and gave instructions. After she mastered taxiing around the airfield, she lifted off and flew . De Laroche&#x27;s flight is often cited as the first by a woman in a powered heavier-than-air craft; there is evidence that two other women, P. Van Pottelsberghe and Thérèse Peltier, had flown the previous year with Henri Farman and Delagrange respectively as passengers but not as pilots.

Decades later, aviation journalist Harry Harper wrote that until de Laroche made her celebrated flight on the Voisin, she had only flown once, for a short hop, as a passenger. When she first took the controls, Charles Voisin expressly forbade her to attempt a flight; after taxiing twice across the airfield, she took off, flying &quot;ten or fifteen feet high&quot; and handling the controls with &quot;cool, quick precision&quot;.
Although Gabriel Voisin wrote, &quot;... my brother [was] entirely under her thumb&quot;, the story of de Laroche as a headstrong woman making the flight after scant preparation and against Voisin&#x27;s orders almost certainly romanticises what took place. &quot;Flight&quot; magazine, a week after the flight, reported: &quot;For some time the Baroness has been taking lessons from M. Chateau, the Voisin instructor, at Chalons, and on Friday of last week she was able to take the wheel for the first time. This initial voyage into the air was only a very short one, and &quot;terra firma&quot; was regained after .&quot; &quot;Flight&quot; was also responsible for bestowing the title &quot;Baroness&quot; upon de Laroche, as she was not of noble birth. &quot;Flight&quot; added that on the following day she circled the flying field twice, &quot;the turnings being made with consummate ease. During this flight of about four miles (6 km) there was a strong gusty wind blowing, but after the first two turnings the Baroness said that it did not bother her, as she had the machine completely under control.&quot;

On 8 March 1910, de Laroche became the first woman in the world to receive a pilot licence when the Aero-Club of France issued her licence #36 of the &quot;Fédération Aéronautique Internationale&quot; (International Aeronautics Federation or F.A.I.).

De Laroche participated in aviation meetings at Heliopolis in Egypt as well as Saint Petersburg, Budapest and Rouen. During the show in St. Petersburg, she was personally congratulated by Tsar Nicholas II. There, she was presented once again as &quot;Baroness&quot; de Laroche. Thereafter, the title became commonly used.

De Laroche&#x27;s efforts were not trouble-free. &quot;La Petite Gironde&quot; reported on her activities on 5 January 1910. Calling her the first woman to fly, &quot;La Petite Gironde&quot; reported that during a flight around the field at Chalons, with clear skies and light wind, her plane had flown 4 or 5 meters above ground but suddenly crashed. Unconscious at first, de Laroche awoke complaining about internal pains, the result of a shoulder injury. In July 1910, de Laroche was participating in the week-long airshow at Reims in France. On 8 July, her aeroplane crashed, and she suffered such severe injuries that her recovery was in doubt, but two years later, she was fit again and had returned to flying. On 26 September 1912, she and Charles Voisin were involved in an automobile crash. Voisin was killed, and she was severely injured.

On 25 November 1913, de Laroche won the Aero-Club of France&#x27;s Femina Cup for a non-stop long-distance flight of over 4 hours duration.

During World War I, as flying was considered too dangerous for women, she served as a military driver, chauffeuring officers from the rear zones to the front under fire.

In June 1919, de Laroche set two women&#x27;s altitude records, one at ; and also the women&#x27;s distance record, at .

==Death and legacy==
On 18 July 1919, de Laroche, who was a talented engineer, went to the airfield at Le Crotoy as part of her plan to become the first female test pilot. She co-piloted an experimental aircraft (whether she flew this is not known); on its landing approach the aeroplane went into a dive and crashed, killing both de Laroche and the co-pilot.

There is a statue of de Laroche at Paris–Le Bourget Airport in France.

From 6 to 12 March 2010, to celebrate the Centennial of Licensed Women Pilots, women pilots from eight countries on three continents used 20 types of aircraft to establish a new world record: 310 girls and women introduced to piloting by women pilots in one week.

Women of Aviation Worldwide Week is held annually during the week that includes 8 March, which marks the anniversary of Raymonde de Laroche&#x27;s pilot licence.

<doc id="913026" wikidata="Q2178318" url="?curid=913026" title="Take Back the Night (organization)">
<text>Take Back the Night is an international event and non-profit organization with the mission of ending sexual, relationship, and domestic violence in all forms. Hundreds of events are held in over 30 countries annually. Events often include marches, rallies and vigils intended as a protest and direct action against rape and other forms of sexual, relationship and domestic violence. In 2001, a group of women who had participated in the earliest Take Back the Night marches, came together to form the Take Back the Night Foundation in support of the events throughout the United States and the world.

==History==
Take Back the Night Foundation&#x27;s Board members have participated in Take Back the Night marches and events from the 1970s to the present day. One of the first &quot;Take Back the Night&quot; marches was held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in October 1975, after the murder of a microbiologist, Susan Alexander Speeth, who was stabbed to death while walking home alone. The first Take Back the Night event included a protest in San Francisco against pornography in 1978, and was part of a Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media conference, the first national conference on pornography.

&quot;Take Back the Night&quot; was used as the title of a 1977 memorial read by Anne Pride at an anti-violence rally in Pittsburgh.

==Events==
Events typically consist of a rally followed by a march and often a speak-out or candlelight vigil on violence against women. Early marches were often deliberately women-only in order to symbolize women&#x27;s individual walk through darkness and to demonstrate that women united can resist fear and violence. (Most marches in the present day include men; the organization differs as each event is organized locally.) The women-only policies caused controversy on some campuses; activists argued that male allies and sexual assault survivors should be allowed to march in support of women and male victims of sexual violence.

In current practice, Take Back the Night events are not only inclusive of men, but include men as survivors, bystanders, and supporters. Many colleges, such as Wesleyan University in Connecticut, allow men to participate in speaking on their own experiences with sexual assault. Bowdoin College in Maine organizes a similar candlelight vigil and walk that encourages students of all genders to show solidarity for survivors on campus and in this nation. Michigan State University&#x27;s Take Back the Night event includes a list of demands to the university community to end sexual violence.

While the march began as a way to protest the violence that women experienced while walking in public at night, the purpose of these marches was to speak out against this violence and raise community awareness as a preventive measure against future violence. The mission of Take Back the Night has since grown to encompass all forms of violence against all persons, though sexual violence against women is still the top focus. The word &quot;night&quot; was originally meant to be taken literally to express the fear that many women feel during the night but has since changed to symbolize a fear of
violence in general. This helps the movement incorporate other feminist concerns such as domestic violence and sexual abuse within the home. Take Back the Night events occur on college campuses, in major metropolitan areas, in small towns, on military bases, and even in high schools. International events have been documented in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Bermuda, Canada, Italy, Poland, Germany, Hungary, India, England and many other countries. The common purpose is to advocate for the right of everyone to feel safe from sexual violence.

On November 7, 2009, the first Take the Back the Night annual conference took place at Columbia University.

==Controversy and debate==
While some Take Back the Night marches encourage men to participate, others still refuse to allow men to be involved under the claim of creating a safe space for women. Several critics have argued that this ignores the struggles of male victims and fails to provide them male role models, as well as implying the need to &quot;take back the night&quot; from all men, not just those who are perpetrators of sexual violence. Advocacy for having a broad coalition of participants including men, women, and transgender individuals alike has come from many different commentators in a variety of publications.

The specific focus of some Take Back the Night events on sexual assaults from strangers and the lack of focus on date rape, child sexual abuse, parental incest, and other such forms of victimization has attracted criticism from a broad group of commentators such as Megan Greenwell of &quot;Good Magazine&quot;. Greenwell has remarked that the use of the &quot;righteous rape&quot; trope by Take Back the Night participants, to refer to sexual assault in the open by strangers as being somehow inherently morally different to other types of assault, is belittling and wrong.

In the higher-education context, the policy of some institutions to make Take Back the Night events mandatory for students, compelling them to attend regardless of whether they want to or not, has come under criticism by some women&#x27;s rights activists as being hypocritical and inherently self-defeating. After a 2015 controversy at Virginia Tech emerged in which a mandatory event had some football players in the audience laugh at accounts of sexual assault, try to leave early, and otherwise disrupt the process, &#x27;Womanspace&#x27; Co-President Malavika Sahai remarked, &quot;Requiring people to go to an event encroaches on that safe space... [i]f you don&#x27;t want to be there, you really shouldn&#x27;t be there.&quot;

<text>Victor Howard Metcalf (October 10, 1853 – February 20, 1936) was an American politician; he served in President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s cabinet as Secretary of Commerce and Labor, and then as Secretary of the Navy.

==Early life and education ==

Born in Utica, New York, on October 10, 1853, to William and Sarah P. (Howard) Metcalf. He attended the Utica public schools, Utica Free Academy, and Russell&#x27;s Military Institute at New Haven, Connecticut. In 1872, he entered Yale College where he was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity (Phi chapter); he left in his junior year to attend Yale Law School. He graduated in 1876 and was admitted to the Connecticut bar. In 1877, he continued his legal education at Hamilton College, and was admitted to the New York bar.

== Early career ==
He practiced in Utica in 1877, and then moved to Oakland, California in 1879. His law practice in California handled real property and commercial cases.

== Family ==
He married Emily Corinne Nicholson in 1881; they had two sons, one of them being educated at the Annapolis Naval Academy, the other becoming a businessman in California.

== Political career ==
=== Congress ===
He was elected as a Republican to the 56th, 57th and 58th United States Congresses, serving from 1899 until 1904. In congress he served on the Naval Affairs and the Ways and Means committees. Metcalf&#x27;s legislation for reclamation of arid lands put him in touch with President Theodore Roosevelt.

=== Roosevelt cabinet ===
President Roosevelt appointed him, on July 1, 1904, Secretary of Commerce and Labor. As Secretary of Commerce, Roosevelt sent Metcalf to San Francisco in 1905 as an intermediator between the San Francisco school board and 91 Japanese students who were refused entry to public schools. A compromise was reached where the students would be permitted into the public schools while Japan would stop issuing passports to laborers. As President Roosevelt&#x27;s personal representative, Secretary Metcalf traveled to San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake and fire to survey the damage. He served until December 12, 1906, when he was appointed Secretary of the Navy. During his term, he oversaw the world cruise of the Great White Fleet. The pressures of office took a toll on his health and he resigned as navy secretary November 13, 1908.
== Retirement and death ==
After leaving Roosevelt&#x27;s Cabinet he returned to Oakland and resumed his practice of law, and engaged in the banking business. Little more than a month after his wife Emily died, Metcalf died in Oakland, February 20, 1936.

He is buried at Mountain View Cemetery, Oakland, Calif.

<text>Sögubrot af nokkrum fornkonungum (Fragment of a Saga about Certain Ancient Kings) is a fragmentary Icelandic text dealing with some legendary Swedish and Danish kings. It is thought to be based on the lost &quot;Skjöldunga saga&quot; and perhaps represents a late state of that work.

The fragment begins in the middle of the story of Ívarr inn víðfaðmi, &#x27;&quot;Ivar the Widely Embracing&quot;, describing how he won the realm of Zealand through trickery, and how he committed suicide under strange circumstances while on an invasion of the realm of Ráðbarðr, who had married his daughter Auðr the Deep-Minded without his permission. The fragment then recounts the early life of Harald Wartooth but breaks off; it resumes with the arrival of Sigurd Hring, Harald&#x27;s old age, and the colossal Battle of Brávellir. It breaks off again towards the end of Sigurd&#x27;s life.

<text>, short: KptLt/in lists: KL, ( or &quot;lieutenant captain&quot;) is an officer grade of the captains&#x27; military hierarchy group () of the modern German . The rank is rated OF-2 in NATO, and equivalent to in the Heer and Luftwaffe. It is grade A11 or A12 in the pay rules of the Federal Ministry of Defence.

The rank first appeared in the German Empire and continued in use through the Weimar Republic and into the Third Reich.

==Address==
In line with ZDv 10/8, the formal manner of addressing people with the rank is &quot;&quot;Herr/Frau Kapitänleutnant&quot;. However, in German tradition and in line with seamen&#x27;s language, the title is abbreviated to &quot;Herr/Frau Kaleu&quot; in verbal communication (contemporary usage). Historically, in the Wehrmacht, the abbreviation spoken was &quot;Herr Kaleun&quot;&quot;.

==Rank and assignment==

The United States Navy&#x27;s rank of lieutenant is equal to in NATO&#x27;s military hierarchy (classed as OF-2). However, German Navy might be assigned to the so-called &quot;line officer career&quot; (de: Truppendienstlaufbahn or Truppendienstoffizier) or &quot;officer specialist career&quot; (de: Fachdienstlaufbahn or Fachdienstoffizier, officially: Offizier des militärfachlichen Dienstes).

Its rank insignia, worn on the sleeves and shoulders, are one golden five-pointed star above two golden stripes with one half stripes between them (without the star when rank loops are worn).

===Line Officer career===
A (line officer) may command smaller ships (e.g. submarine class 206A, minehunter class 332) or serve as principal warfare officer on larger warships, giving the rank responsibilities more along those of a Lieutenant commander in the U.S. or Royal navies.

The sequence of ranks (top-down approach) in that particular group is as follows:
*OF-5: Kapitän zur See / Oberst
*OF-4: / Oberstleutnant
*OF-3: Korvettenkapitän / Major
*OF-2: / 

===Officer Specialist career===
 might be a senior officer specialist rank, comparable to US warrant officer, however, junior to .
Military people of the &quot;line officer career&quot; skip over the rank , by regular promotion from (OF-2) to Korvettenkapitän (OF-3).
The sequence of ranks (top-down approach) in that particular group is as follows:
*OF-2a: / Stabshauptmann
*OF-2b: / 
*OF-1a: / 
*OF-1b: Leutnant zur See / Leutnant

<doc id="913048" wikidata="Q862725" url="?curid=913048" title="Valley of Elah">
<text>The Valley of Elah, Ella Valley (&quot;the valley of the terebinth&quot;; from the &quot;Emek HaElah&quot;), or Wadi es-Sunt (), is a long, shallow valley in the Shephelah area of Israel, best known from the Hebrew Bible as the place where David defeated Goliath (; ). It is home to several important archaeological sites, including those identified as the ancient towns of Azekah and Socho (). Rising up from the valley on its extreme southeast end lies the hilltop ruin Adullam, and on its north lie the ruins of the ancient fortress city of Khirbet Qeiyafa, which is identified with the ancient town of Sha&#x27;araim ().

The valley is named after its indigenous trees - in Hebrew after the large and shady terebinth trees (&quot;Pistacia atlantica&quot;, &quot;elah&quot;), and in Arabic after the white acacia trees (&quot;Acacia albida&quot;, &quot;sunt&quot;). On the west side of the valley, near Socho, there is a very large and ancient terebinth tree, in height with a trunk in circumference and a canopy at least in diameter. This tree is notable for being one of the largest terebinths in the area, and marks the upper end of the valley.

Since the early 1970s, the valley has also contained a large satellite relay station, with an antenna farm containing some 120 satellite dishes of various sizes. From 2010 to 2014, the region around the valley was believed to be threatened by shale oil extraction through the CCR ground-heating process, with the Green Zionist Alliance and the grassroots group Save Adullam, among others, working to stop exploitation of the region. The plan was ultimately blocked in 2014 by a zoning committee decision. In July 2019, the Elah Valley came under the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, owing largely to its historical importance and the desire to curtail the encroaching city limits of Beit Shemesh to its north.

==History==
In 2009, Professor Yosef Garfinkel discovered a fortified city from the Iron Age II dated sometime between 1050 and 915 BC at Khirbet Qeiyafa, southwest of Jerusalem in the Elah Valley. The fortifications have been said to support the biblical account of the United Monarchy, the theory that Israel in the time of King David at the beginning of Iron Age II was more than simply a tribal chiefdom. Others are skeptical and suggest it might represent either a Judahite or Canaanite fortress.
In the late 19th century, Claude Conder and Herbert Kitchener described the Elah Valley as being &quot;one of the most fertile districts in Palestine. It is an open flat vale about half a mile across, and covered with corn; a narrow trench runs down the center full of white pebbles worn by the water in winter. Here and there large terebinths grow along its course (&quot;Butmet Wâdy es Sûr&quot;), and solitary oak trees (&quot;Ballûtet Kŭssis&quot;). On either side rise the stony hills covered with brushwood and wild growth.&quot;
==Flora and fauna==

Numerous plant species are native to the Elah Valley, including:

* Terebinth (&quot;Pistacia terebinthus&quot;)
* Kermes oak (&quot;Quercus calliprinos&quot;)
* Buckthorn (&quot;Rhamnus lycioides&quot;)
* Carob (&quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;)

* Sage (&quot;Salvia fruticosa&quot;)
* Toothpick (&quot;Ammi visnaga&quot;)
* Florence fennel (&quot;Foeniculum vulgare&quot;)
* Anemone (&quot;Anemone coronaria&quot;)
* Cyclamen (&quot;Cyclamen persicum&quot;)
* Lupine (&quot;Lupinus pilosus&quot;)
* Daisy (&quot;Glebionis coronaria&quot;)
* Syrian cornflower-thistle (&quot;Centaurea cyanoides&quot;) – rare
* Mallow (&quot;Malva nicaeensis&quot;)
* Asparagus (&quot;Asparagus palaestinus&quot;)
* Chicory (&quot;Cichorium pumilum&quot;; syn. &quot;Cichorium endivia&quot;)

<text>Alpha Chi Alpha () is a fraternity at the American Ivy League university of Dartmouth College. Alpha Chi Alpha is a member of Dartmouth&#x27;s Greek system, which currently has fourteen fraternities, nine sororities, and three co-ed undergraduate houses that fall under the umbrella of the Greek system.

Alpha Chi Alpha is referred to among Dartmouth students as simply Alpha Chi.

The house, which is located at 13 Webster Avenue on the Dartmouth College campus, is a college-owned fraternity, meaning that the brothers do not own the land or house. This also means that Dartmouth College paid for $1.3 million in renovations (done during the summer of 2004), which included the razing of the &quot;Barn&quot; structure that was used as social space by the brothers of Alpha Chi to make way for a newly expanded basement and main floor area which were to act as a new social space for the fraternity.

The house is nicknamed the &quot;Magic Green Cottage&quot; and the &quot;Cheese Lodge&quot; by its members and has the unique location on fraternity row directly across from the President&#x27;s house. The green-shingled structure includes a sand volleyball court adjacent to the house. Its perennial pledges are easily recognized by their &quot;sirens&quot; (red, baseball cap-like headwear), which they wear for the duration of their pledge term.The house was begun in March 1917, when twelve Dartmouth men founded the Epsilon Kappa Alpha fraternity. In 1919, this lodge became the &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of the national fraternity, Alpha Chi Rho. The house was located in the back of the present White Church.

Alpha Chi Rho flourished at Dartmouth for about ten years. In the early 1930s, however, the number of brothers declined drastically due to several new fraternities on campus and general financial difficulties caused by the Depression. It was at that time when Alpha Chi Rho, along with Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Alpha Sigma Phi, who were each having difficulties of their own, joined to create a new fraternity, Gamma Delta Chi. This house is still active today.
==History==


On March 9, 1957, twenty-four undergraduates bonded together and broke away from Gamma Delta Chi, which they thought was inadequate and misdirected. They reactivated the &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Rho. The brotherhood moved to the present house on Webster Avenue, bought and repaired by the college. In this way, the fraternity was established. Tim Ryerson &#x27;59 was the first president of the reactivated chapter.

Early in the spring of 1963, a committee met and recommended a break from the national. On May 21, 1963, the chapter voted to discontinue its ties with the national affiliation. It was determined that the brotherhood had no meaningful ties with the nation. The national chapter required brothers to &quot;accept Jesus as their lord and savior,&quot; a tenet that brothers at the &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; strongly disagreed with. The ritual was meaningless to the brothers because of their general dislike for the national, and because they found such a requirement to be ridiculous. An overburdening financial obligation to the national may have been an additional consideration. The brotherhood voted to name the disaffiliated fraternity Alpha Chi Alpha and it has been in continual operation ever since.

==Chapter house==

The building was built at 13 Webster Avenue in 1898. Professor Fred Emery purchased the vacant lot on May 5, 1896. Later owners sold the house to the college in March 1957, and it has been leased by the brotherhood ever since. The college, as the fraternity&#x27;s landlord, takes care of all major structural repairs.

Improvements have been made to the building from term to term, including a series of major renovations. The living room and the second floor above it were added in May 1963. The entire third floor is the result of the efforts of Bob Ceplikas &#x27;78. During the summer of 1985, the college spent over $180,000 on major renovations.

The most recent renovations occurred in the summer and fall terms of 2004. Costing $1.3 million, the renovations involved the razing of a structure that was once known as the &#x27;Emory Barn,&#x27; but was soon referred to as simply &#x27;the Barn&#x27;. A concrete hallway called &#x27;the Slide,&#x27; was constructed at some point, adjoining the fraternity&#x27;s physical plant and the Barn. The Barn was one of the most distinctive social atmospheres on Dartmouth&#x27;s campus and was cherished by the brotherhood. The second floor of the Barn, known as the Upstairs Barn, housed three brothers each term, and it became well known among the brotherhood as a unique melting-pot bonding experience. The basement, along with the new main floor area and recently refurbished tube room, have replaced the Barn and the old front room as the primary social spaces for the fraternity. Presently, since construction was completed in the fall 2004, the newest reincarnation of Alpha Chi Alpha can house 21 brothers and host over 600 guests for the Beach Party that the brothers put on each winter during Winter Carnival, and also for a Pigstick BBQ each spring on the first Saturday in May.

<text>Ravi Coltrane (born August 6, 1965) is an American jazz saxophonist. Co-owner of the record label RKM Music, he has produced music for pianist Luis Perdomo, guitarist David Gilmore, and trumpeter Ralph Alessi.

== Biography ==
Ravi Coltrane is the son of saxophonist John Coltrane and jazz harpist Alice Coltrane. He is the second born of John and Alice Coltrane&#x27;s three children; his siblings are John Jr. and Oran. Alice had a daughter Michelle prior to her union with John Coltrane. He is a first cousin once removed of experimental music producer Steven Ellison, aka Flying Lotus. He was raised in Los Angeles, California, and was named after sitar player Ravi Shankar. Ravi Coltrane was less than two years old in 1967 when his father died.

He is a 1983 graduate of El Camino Real High School in Woodland Hills, California. In 1986, he studied music, concentrating on saxophone at the California Institute of the Arts. He has worked often with Steve Coleman, a significant influence on Coltrane&#x27;s musical conception. Coltrane has also played with Geri Allen, Kenny Barron, McCoy Tyner, Pharoah Sanders, Herbie Hancock, Carlos Santana, Stanley Clarke, Chick Corea, and Branford Marsalis.

In 1997, after performing on over thirty recordings as a sideman, Coltrane recorded &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, his first album as leader, working with drummer Jeff &quot;Tain&quot; Watts, bassist Lonnie Plaxico, and pianist Michael Cain. This led to touring with his working band, featuring Andy Milne on piano, drummer Steve Hass, and bassist Lonnie Plaxico. Coltrane&#x27;s second album, &quot;From the Round Box&quot; (2000), was recorded with pianist Geri Allen, trumpeter Ralph Alessi, bassist James Genus, and drummer Eric Harland. &quot;Mad 6&quot; (2002), Coltrane&#x27;s first album for Sony, featured drummer Steve Hass, pianist George Colligan, and bassist James Genus. &quot;In Flux&quot; (2005) included bassist Drew Gress, pianist Luis Perdomo, and drummer E. J. Strickland.

In January 2005, Coltrane performed in India for the first time as part of a delegation of American jazz musicians sent on a State Department tour to promote HIV/AIDS awareness. Also participating were vocalist Al Jarreau, guitarist Earl Klugh, and pianist George Duke. Performances included a January 16 concert in Mumbai (Bombay), a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. in Delhi on January 17, and a music festival in Delhi on January 18 organized by violinist L. Subramaniam. Also on January 18, Coltrane performed at the Coltrane Shankar Centre, where Coltrane met with the man he was named after. Picking up a clarinet to engage in an unplanned jam session with a pair of shehnai players, Coltrane said, &quot;I&#x27;m a little nervous with the master here.&quot;

The Coltrane Quartet played at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 2001 and 2013, the Montreux Jazz Festival and the Newport Jazz Festival in 2004, and the Vienna Jazz Festival in 2005.

In 2008, Coltrane became part of the Blue Note 7, a septet formed that year in honor of the 70th anniversary of Blue Note Records. The group recorded an album in 2008 entitled &quot;&quot;, which was released in 2009 by Blue Note/EMI, and toured the United States to promote the album from January to April 2009. The group plays the music of Blue Note Records from various artists, with arrangements by members of the band and Renee Rosnes.

In 2013, he performed at the Village Vanguard. In 2016 he traveled to Australia to play at the opening of Bird&#x27;s Basement, the first international section of Birdland. The following year he would return to Australia during September to play at The Basement in Sydney and again at Bird&#x27;s Basement in Melbourne. During his second visit, the quartet consisted of himself, Johnathan Blake, Glenn Zaleski, and Dezron Douglas.

== Personal life ==
Ravi Coltrane was born on August 6, 1965, on Long Island, New York and was named after the Indian sitarist and composer Ravi Shankar. After the death of John Coltrane in 1967, Alice Coltrane moved the family to Los Angeles. At a young age Ravi was sensitive and shy. He took an interest in photography and film and sought to pursue a career in one of the two. He started playing clarinet but switched to the saxophone in high school.

Tragedy struck the family again in 1982 when his older brother John Coltrane Jr. died in a car accident at the age of 17. This event had a profound effect on Ravi and he dropped out of school. Despite the trauma his brother&#x27;s death caused him, it led him to rediscover his musical origins and influenced his decision to study music. He went on to enroll at the California Institute of the Arts in 1986 where he continued to study music. While struggling to play, he graduated and then moved to an apartment with rehearsal space adjacent to a commercial space in Queens in 1991. From there he collaborated as an apprentice with Elvin Jones, Jack DeJohnette, Wallace Roney, Joanne Brackeen, and Steve Coleman.

In 1991 while playing with Elvin Jones, Coltrane met Kathleen Hennessy, manager of the Regattabar. They married in 1999 and have two sons, William and Aaron.

Coltrane lives in Brooklyn, New York and is the Chairman of The Coltrane Home, an organization dedicated to preserving the museum and research center based in John and Alice Coltrane&#x27;s home in Dix Hills, Long Island.

<doc id="913091" wikidata="Q1144501" url="?curid=913091" title="Gwichʼin">
<text>The Gwichʼin (or Kutchin or Loucheux) are an Athabaskan-speaking First Nations people of Canada and an Alaska Native people. They live in the northwestern part of North America, mostly north of the Arctic Circle.
Gwichʼin are well-known for their crafting of snowshoes, birchbark canoes, and the two-way sled. They are renowned for their intricate and ornate beadwork. They also continue to make traditional caribou-skin clothing and porcupine quillwork embroidery, both of which are highly regarded among Gwichʼin. Today, the Gwich’in economy consists mostly of hunting, fishing, and seasonal wage-paying employment.

==Name==
Their name is sometimes spelled &quot;Kutchin&quot; or &quot;Gwitchin&quot; and translates as &quot;one who dwells&quot; or &quot;resident of [a region].&quot; Historically, the French called the Gwichʼin &quot;Loucheux&quot; (&quot;squinters&quot;), as well as &quot;Tukudh&quot; or &quot;Takudh&quot;, a term also used by Anglican missionaries. Sometimes, these terms may refer (explicitly or implicitly) to particular dialects of the Gwichʼin language (or to the communities that speak them).

Gwichʼin often refer to themselves by the term &quot;Dinjii Zhuu&quot; instead of &quot;Gwichʼin&quot;. &quot;Dinjii Zhuu&quot; literally translates as &quot;Small People,&quot; but figuratively it refers to all First Nations, not just Gwichʼin.

==Gwichʼin language==
The Gwichʼin language, part of the Athabaskan language family, has two main dialects, eastern and western, which are delineated roughly at the United States-Canada border. Each village has unique dialect differences, idioms, and expressions. The Old Crow people in the northern Yukon have approximately the same dialect as those bands living in Venetie and Arctic Village, Alaska.

Approximately 300 Alaskan Gwichʼin speak their language, according to the Alaska Native Language Center. However, according to the UNESCO &quot;Interactive Atlas of the World&#x27;s Languages in Danger,&quot; Gwichʼin is now a &quot;severely endangered&quot; language, with fewer than 150 fluent speakers in Alaska and another 250 in northwest Canada.

Innovative language revitalization projects are underway to document the language and to enhance the writing and translation skills of younger Gwichʼin speakers. In one project lead research associate and fluent speaker Gwichʼin elder, Kenneth Frank, works with linguists which include young Gwichʼin speakers affiliated with the Alaska Native Language Center at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks, to document traditional knowledge of caribou anatomy.

Analysis of the traditional place names indicate that the Gwich’in have an ancient history in this region, likely since the early Holocene (~8,000 years).

==Gwichʼin tribes and clans==
The many different bands or tribes of Gwichʼin include but are not limited to: &quot;Deenduu&quot;, &quot;Draanjik&quot;, &quot;Di’haii&quot;, &quot;Gwichyaa&quot;, &quot;Kʼiitlʼit&quot;, &quot;Neetsaii&quot; or &quot;Neetsʼit&quot;, &quot;Ehdiitat&quot;, &quot;Danzhit Hanlaii&quot;, &quot;Teetlʼit&quot;, and &quot;Vuntut&quot; or &quot;Vantee&quot;.

Three major clans survive from antiquity across Gwichʼin lands. People are expected to marry outside their clans. Two are primary clans and the third has a lower/secondary status. The first clan are the &quot;Nantsaii&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;First on the land&quot;; the second clan are the &quot;Chitsʼyaa&quot; which translates as &quot;The helpers&quot; (second on the land). 

The last clan is called the &quot;Tenjeraatsaii&quot;, which translates as &quot;In the middle&quot; or &quot;independents&quot;. This last clan is reserved for people who marry within their own clan, which is considered incestuous. To a lesser degree, it is for children of people who are outside of the clan system.

==Location and population==

Over 6,000 Gwichʼin live in 15 small communities in northern parts of the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Territory of Canada, and in northern Alaska. The Gwichʼin communities are:

*Alaska
**Arctic Village (Dihai-kutchin and Neetsaii Gwichʼin)

==Oral history==
The Gwichʼin have a strong oral tradition of storytelling that has only recently begun to be written in the modern orthography. Gwichʼin folk stories include the &quot;Vazaagiitsak cycle&quot; (literally, &quot;His Younger Brother Became Snagged&quot;), which focuses on the comical adventures of a Gwichʼin misfit who, among other things, battles lice on a giant&#x27;s head, plays the fool to the cunning fox, and eats the scab from his own anus unknowingly. Gwichʼin comedies often contain bawdy humor. Other major characters from the Gwichʼin oral tradition include: Googhwaii, Ool Ti’, Tł’oo Thal, K’aiheenjik, K’iizhazhal, and Shaanyaati’.

Numerous folk tales about prehistoric times all begin with the phrase &quot;Deenaadai’&quot;, which translates roughly as &quot;In the ancient days&quot;. This is usually followed with the admission that this was &quot;when all of the people could talk to the animals, and all of the animals could speak with the people&quot;. These stories are often parables, which suggest a proper protocol, or code of behavior for Gwichʼin. Equality, generosity, hard work, kindness, mercy, cooperation for mutual success, and just revenge are often the themes of stories such as: &quot;Tsyaa Too Oozhrii Gwizhit&quot; (The Boy In The Moon), &quot;Zhoh Ts’à Nahtryaa&quot; (The Wolf and the Wolverine), &quot;Vadzaih Luk Hàa&quot; (The Caribou and the Fish).

==Traditional beliefs==
In recent times, important figures in who have represented traditional belief structures are: Johnny and Sarah Frank, Sahneuti, and Ch’eegwalti’.

Caribou are an integral part of First Nations and Inuit oral histories and legends, and are integral to their survival. The Gwichʼin creation story tells that the Gwichʼin people and the caribou separated from a single entity. There is a stable population of woodland caribou throughout a large portion of the Gwichʼin Settlement Area, and such woodland caribou are an important food source for Gwichʼin. They harvest other caribou at a higher rate. 

Gwichʼin living in Inuvik, Aklavik, Fort McPherson, and Tsiigehtchic harvest woodland caribou but not as much as other caribou. The Gwichʼin prefer to hunt Porcupine caribou or the barren-ground Blue Nose herd, which travel in large herds, when they are available. Many hunters claimed that woodland caribou, which form very small groups, are wilder, both hard to see and hard to hunt. They are very smart, cunning, and elusive.

==Caribou as cultural symbol==
The caribou &quot;vadzaih&quot; is the cultural symbol and a keystone subsistence species of the Gwichʼin, just as the buffalo is to the Plains Indians. In Rick Bass&#x27;s book entitled &quot;Caribou Rising: Defending the Porcupine Herd, Gwich-&#x27;in Culture, and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge&quot;, he quotes Sarah James as saying, &quot;We are the caribou people. Caribou are not just what we eat; they are who we are. They are in our stories and songs and the whole way we see the world. Caribou are our life. Without caribou we wouldn&#x27;t exist.&quot; Traditionally, their tents and most of their clothing were made out of caribou skin, and they lived &quot;mostly on caribou and all other wild meats.&quot; Caribou fur skins were placed on top of spruce branches as bedding and flooring. Soap was made from boiled poplar tree ashes mixed with caribou fat. Drums were made of caribou hide. Overalls were made from &quot;really good white tanned caribou skin&quot;.

Elders have identified at least 150 descriptive Gwichʼin names for all of the bones, organs, and tissues. &quot;Associated with the caribou&#x27;s anatomy are not just descriptive Gwichʼin names for all of the body parts including bones, organs, and tissues as well as &quot;an encyclopedia of stories, songs, games, toys, ceremonies, traditional tools, skin clothing, personal names and surnames, and a highly developed ethnic cuisine.&quot;

== Tattooing ==
Yidįįłtoo are the traditional face tattoos of the Hän Gwich’in.

==Ethnobotany==
In 2002, Gwichʼin Social and Cultural Institute, the Aurora Research Institute, and Parks Canada co-published a book entitled &quot;Gwichʼin Ethnobotany: Plants Used by the Gwichʼin for Food, Medicine, Shelter and Tools&quot; in collaboration with elders, in which they described dozens of trees, shrubs, woody plants, berry plants, vascular plants, mosses and lichens, and fungi that the Gwichʼin used. Examples included black spruce &quot;Picea mariana&quot; and white spruce &quot;Picea glauca&quot;, &quot;Ts’iivii&quot; which was used as &quot;food, medicine, shelter, fuel and tools.&quot; Boiled cones and branches were used to prevent and to treat colds.

==Christianity==

The introduction of Christianity in the 1840s throughout Gwichʼin territory produced spiritual changes that are still widely in effect today. Widespread conversion to Christianity, as influenced by Anglican and Catholic missionaries, led to these as the two dominant Christian sects among the Gwichʼin. Notable figures in the missionary movement among the Gwichʼin are Archdeacon Hudson Stuck, William West Kirkby, Robert McDonald, Deacon William Loola, and Deacon Albert Tritt. The Traditional Chief, an honorary and lifetime title, of one Gwichʼin village is also an Episcopal priest: the Rev. Traditional Chief Trimble Gilbert of Arctic Village. Chief Gilbert is recognized as the Second Traditional Chief of all of the Athabascan tribes in Interior Alaska through the non-profit Tanana Chiefs Conference.

The Takudh Bible is a translation of the entire King James Bible into Gwichʼin. The Takudh Bible is in a century-old orthography that is not very accurate, and thus hard to read. In the 1960s Richard Mueller designed a new orthography for Gwichʼin, which has now become standard.

==Recognition==
On 4 April 1975, Canada Post issued two stamps in the Indians of Canada, Indians of the Subarctic series both designed by Georges Beaupré. One was &quot;Ceremonial Dress&quot; based on a painting by Lewis Parker of &quot;a ceremonial costume of the Kutchin tribe&quot; (Gwichʼin people). The other, &quot;Dance of the Kutcha-Kutchin&quot; was based on a painting by Alexander Hunter Murray The 8¢ stamps are perforated 12.5 and 13.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited and the Canadian Bank Note Company.

==Current politics==

Caribou is traditionally a major component of their diet. Many Gwichʼin people are dependent on the Porcupine caribou which herd calves on the coastal plain in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). Gwichʼin people have been very active in protesting and lobbying against the possibility of oil drilling in ANWR, due to fears that oil drilling will deplete the population of the Porcupine Caribou herd.

Bobbi Jo Greenland Morgan, who is head of the Gwichʼin Tribal Council, along with the Canadian government, the Yukon and Northwest territories and other First Nations, expressed concerns to the United States about the proposed lease sale in the calving grounds of a large cross-border Porcupine caribou herd to energy drilling, despite international agreements to protect it.&quot; In December, the United States &quot;released a draft environmental impact study proposal for the lease sale with a public comment period until February 11, 2019. Environment Canada wrote in a letter to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM) Alaska office, that &quot;Canada is concerned about the potential transboundary impacts of oil and gas exploration and development planned for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge Coastal Plain.&quot;

For similar reasons, Gwichʼin also actively protested the development of oil in the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, and a proposed land trade from the United States National Wildlife Refuge System and Doyon, Limited.

<text>Zlatyu Georgiev Boyadzhiev (; 22 October 1903 – 2 February 1976) was a Bulgarian painter. He is known for his portraits and landscapes, depicting mainly the Old Town of Plovdiv, Bulgaria&#x27;s second largest city, and village life in the region.

==Life==
Born in the village of Brezovo, Boyadzhiev graduated in painting from the Academy of Fine Arts in Sofia in 1932. His work is generally divided into two main periods: until 1951, when he suffered a stroke and temporarily gave up painting, and from his partial recovery a few years later until his death in 1976. After the stroke, he worked with his left hand and in a completely different manner.

The first period is characterized by neoclassical style in composing scenes with scenes of rural life. In the second period of the artist&#x27;s style changed radically in the direction of grotesque imagery, the inclusion of dozens of shapes in compositions and expressive color.

He was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labor, Winner of the Union of Bulgarian Artists &quot;Vladimir Dimitrov - the Master.&quot; Among his most famous works are &quot;Village of Brezovo,&quot; &quot;On the table&quot; and &quot;Two weddings.&quot; Many of his paintings are displayed in a house museum in Plovdiv.

<text>The Tagish or Tagish Khwáan (Tagish: ; ) are a First Nations people of the Athabaskan-speaking ethnolinguistic group that lived around Tagish Lake and Marsh Lake, in Yukon of Canada. The Tagish intermarried heavily with Tlingit from the coast and the Tagish language became extinct in 2008. Today Tagish people live mainly in Carcross or Whitehorse and are members of the Carcross/Tagish First Nation or the Kwanlin Dün First Nation.

Members of the Tagish First Nation made the gold discovery that led to the Klondike Gold Rush: Keish (Skookum Jim Mason), Shaaw Tláa (Kate Carmack)] and Káa goox (Dawson Charlie).

The word &quot;Tagish&quot; also refers to the Tagish language, an Athabaskan language spoken by the ancestors of these people.

&quot;Tagish&quot; means &quot;it (spring ice) is breaking up&quot; and also gave its name to Tagish Lake.

<doc id="913115" wikidata="Q1665781" url="?curid=913115" title="Moon Patrol">
<text>is a 1982 arcade video game developed and released by Irem. It was licensed to Williams for distribution in North America. The player controls a Moon buggy which can jump over and shoot obstacles on a horizontally scrolling landscape as well as shoot aerial attackers. Designed by Takashi Nishiyama, &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; is often credited with the introduction of full parallax scrolling in side-scrolling games. Cabinet art for the Williams version was done by Larry Day. Most of the home ports were from Atari, Inc., sometimes under the Atarisoft label.

==Gameplay==
As a Luna City police officer assigned to Sector Nine, the home of the &quot;toughest thugs in the galaxy&quot;, the player controls a Moon buggy that travels to the right over the horizontally scrolling surface of the Moon. Craters, mines, and other obstacles on the ground must be shot or jumped over. Three types of flying UFOs attack from above and must be shot down. One of the flying enemies has a weapon which creates a crater when it hits the ground.

Gameplay takes place on two courses, each divided into 26 checkpoints identified with letters of the English alphabet. Of these, the five major checkpoints—&quot;E&quot;, &quot;J&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;T&quot; and, &quot;Z&quot;—denote a new &quot;stage&quot; with a new background and theme; for example, the third stage starts at J and introduces mines. The top portion of the screen shows a timeline-style map of the course, with the major checkpoints marked. Above the map is an indicator of the current checkpoint, the time spent in the stage, and three indicator lights: the top light indicates upcoming enemy aerial attacks, the middle one indicates an upcoming minefield, and the bottom one indicates enemies approaching from behind.

At the end of a stage, that time spent is compared to the average, and bonus points are awarded accordingly, at 1,000 plus 100 per second bettered; completing an entire course gives an additional 5,000 points plus 100 per second bettered. There are two unique courses: the &quot;Beginner Course&quot; and the &quot;Champion Course&quot;. The Champion Course &quot;loops&quot; forever, and each loop is numbered for convenience, up to three.

Extra lives are given at 10,000, 30,000, and 50,000 points; thereafter, no more lives are given. The game ends when the last patrol car is destroyed. The game can be continued, but points scored from one game do not carry over. 999,990 points is the maximum high score that can be achieved; players can exceed this score, but it &quot;turns over&quot; if they do.

==Ports==
Atari, Inc. released &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit computers, Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari ST, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a self-booting disk), and TI-99/4A. The versions for non-Atari systems were published under the Atarisoft label. The MSX conversion was published by Irem.

==Reception==
&quot;Moon Patrol&quot; was among the five top-grossing arcade games on North America&#x27;s monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; charts by January 1983.

&quot;Moon Patrol&quot; received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Science Fiction/ Fantasy Video Game&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. &quot;Arcade Express&quot; reviewed the arcade version in January 1983 and scored it 8 out of 10.

Scott Mace of &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; for the Commodore 64 was his favorite Atarisoft game, making good use of the computer&#x27;s sound. &quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine called the Commodore 64 conversion a &quot;very good&quot; shoot &#x27;em up and the &quot;thinking man&#x27;s killing game&quot; while noting it has a continue feature like &quot;Vanguard&quot;. They later gave the home computer conversions a B− rating. In March 1985, &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; rated the Atari 800 version 33 out of 40 and listed it as the third best game of the month. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked the arcade version 86th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot; list.

==Legacy==
&quot;Moon Patrol&quot; was included in the retro compilations &quot;Arcade Hits: Moon Patrol &amp; Spy Hunter&quot; for Game Boy Color and &quot;Midway Presents Arcade&#x27;s Greatest Hits: The Midway Collection 2&quot; for Dreamcast, PlayStation, and Microsoft Windows. In 2006 Bandai released an enhanced version as &quot;Moon Patrol EX&quot; for cell phones. &quot;Lunar Patrol J2ME&quot; was released in 2012 by &quot;GRP Software&quot; (Java ME and Symbian) with enhanced physics and playability. &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch by Hamster in March 2018 as part of the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; series. 

===Clones===
A bootleg version called &quot;Moon Ranger&quot; was released in the arcades the same year as &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;.

Home clones include &quot;Desert Patrol&quot; for the TRS-80 Color Computer (1983), &quot;Gas Hog&quot; for the Atari 2600 (1983), &quot;Lunar Rover Patrol&quot; for the Dragon 32 (1983), &quot;Moon Buggy&quot; for the Commodore 64 (1983), &quot;Moon Alert&quot; for the ZX Spectrum (1984), &quot;Luna Rover&quot; for the ZX Spectrum (1985), &quot;Moon Control&quot; for the Amstrad CPC (1985), &quot;Moonrider&quot; for MSX (1986), and &quot;Overlander&quot; for the Amiga (1993). &quot;Battle Through Time&quot; (1984) for the Commodore 64 re-themed the gameplay to be about major wars of the 20th century. A contemporaneous review for &quot;B.C.&#x27;s Quest for Tires&quot; (1983) remarked on the game&#x27;s similarity to &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;.

Open-source clones named &quot;moon-buggy&quot; and &quot;ASCII Patrol&quot; run in Unix-like terminals.

===Impact===
&quot;Moon Patrol&quot; introduced full parallax scrolling. The arcade video game &quot;Jump Bug&quot; (1981) had previously used a limited form of parallax scrolling, with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and clouds move slowly. &quot;Moon Patrol&quot; has three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the distance between them. Taito&#x27;s &quot;Jungle King&quot;, also with parallax scrolling, was released a month after &quot;Moon Patrol&quot;.

The game&#x27;s designer Takashi Nishiyama went on to create the beat &#x27;em up game &quot;Kung-Fu Master&quot; (1984).
