<text>Anto Đapić (born 22 August 1958) is a Croatian far right politician and the former president of the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP). He served as a representative in the Croatian Parliament, a post he was elected to at the 1992, 1995, 2000, 2003 and 2007 elections.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Đapić was born in Čaprazlije, Livno municipality, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, Yugoslavia (now in Bosnia and Herzegovina). The Đapić family had a history of supporting the old Croatian Party of Rights, and later the Ustaše regime. His father and uncles chose to go to West Germany on permanent work instead of living in Yugoslavia, but Anto, his mother and brother lived in Osijek since 1962. Đapić considers Osijek to be his hometown. Đapić lost his mother in a car crash when he was a teenager, so he had to do manual labour while studying law at Osijek University. Đapić obtained a law degree in 1989.

===Political career===
In 1989, Đapić first joined Franjo Tuđman&#x27;s Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ). He was one of the party&#x27;s organizers in Osijek, but he was expelled after a short time for using the &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; salute. In 1991, he joined the Croatian Party of Rights (HSP), which was renewed a year earlier. After the assassination of Ante Paradžik, he was named the party&#x27;s Vice President. Đapić was also, for a short period of time, a commander of paramilitary units called HOS (Hrvatske Obrambene Snage - Croatian Defence Forces), which were organized by Croatian Party of Rights. Later the HOS was merged with the Croatian Army (in Croatia) and the Croatian Defense Council (in Bosnia).

In 1992, Đapić was elected to the Croatian Parliament. In 1993, he was named the vice-president of HSP. The previous president Dobroslav Paraga claimed Đapić was elected illegally, and he later formed the new party Croatian Party of Right 1861, which has failed at each parliamentary election since 1993.

In the 1995 election, HSP won 4.8% of the vote, but after a recount, 5.01% was claimed to be the official result, which meant that HSP remained represented in the Parliament. With the war being over, the party took more and more criticism for its neo-Ustaša views. However, HSP led by Đapić maintained small but solid support among the voters. In 2000, this time in coalition with Croatian Christian Democratic Union (HKDU), HSP kept four Parliament seats. Đapić led a presidential campaign the same year, finishing a distant fifth. Since then, he and his party endeavoured to change their perception among voters. HSP continues to oppose the existence of the Hague War Crimes Tribunal, to hold eurosceptic views and is socially very conservative. Đapić likened the possible legal recognition of same-sex marriages to &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah&quot;.

In June 2005, Đapić became mayor of Osijek, but he lost this position in 2009. In late 2009, the HSP split yet again. A new party, Croatian Party of Rights Dr. Ante Starčević, with Ruža Tomašić as party leader was formed. The party&#x27;s leadership accused Đapić for the weakening of HSP&#x27;s standing in the Sabor. Đapić was replaced as the president of the party at the November 2009 convention by Daniel Srb.

In December 2011 Đapić announced his retirement from politics. In 2013, he briefly returned to active politics by announcing his intention to run for the mayor of Osijek again, but was expelled from the HSP shortly thereafter.

He ran for president in 2019 but was eliminated in the first round, winning 4,001 or 0.21% of the vote, and finishing 10th out of 11 candidates. His best result was in Osijek-Baranja County where he obtained 0.38% of the vote.

==Family==
Đapić is married with one daughter.

<text>The Ciboney, or Siboney, were a Taíno people of Cuba, Jamaica, and the Tiburon Peninsula of Haiti. A Western Taíno group living in Cuba during the 15th and 16th centuries, they had a dialect and culture distinct from the Classic Taíno in the eastern part of the island, though much of the Ciboney territory was under the control of the eastern chiefs. Confusion in the historical sources led 20th-century scholars to apply the name &quot;Ciboney&quot; to the non-Taíno Guanahatabey of western Cuba and various archaic cultures around the Caribbean, but this is deprecated.

==History==
At the time of Spanish colonization, the Ciboney were the most populous group in Cuba. They inhabited the central part of the island, between western Pinar del Río Province and eastern Oriente Province. Bartolomé de las Casas, who lived among the Ciboney in the early 16th century, related that their dialect and culture was similar to that of the Lucayans of the present-day Bahamas. As such, scholars classify the Ciboney as a Western Taíno group, associating them with the peoples of the Bahamas, Jamaica, and westernmost Hispaniola, while distinguishing them from the Classic Taíno of eastern Cuba, most of Hispaniola, and Puerto Rico. In addition to the Classic Taíno in eastern Cuba, the Ciboney shared the island with the Guanahatabey, an archaic people inhabiting western Pinar del Río Province. The Ciboney spoke a dialect of the Taíno language conventionally known as Ciboney Taíno; it was distinct from, but mutually intelligible with, Classic Taíno.

The Ciboney were the dominant population in Cuba until around 1450. Las Casas states that unlike the highly organized Classic Taíno to the east, the Ciboney had no integrated chiefdoms or wider political structure. In the mid-15th century, Classic Taíno from Hispaniola began migrating into eastern Cuba, overcoming the native Ciboney. These &quot;Cuban Taíno&quot; established chiefdoms concentrated in Oriente Province, though they established settlements as far west as Havana Province. However, the Cuban Taíno never established an island-wide political structure as existed in Hispaniola and Puerto Rico. Classic Taíno migration from Hispaniola to Cuba increased after Spanish contact, with many Taíno leaving to escape the Spanish incursion. Notably, Hispaniola Taíno chief Hatuey fled to Cuba with most of his people; he remained there until the Spanish captured and executed him. Following the Spanish conquest of Cuba in 1511 under Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the population of all native groups declined precipitously until they had disappeared as distinct groups by the end of the century.

==Confusion with the Guanahatabey==
In the 20th century, misreadings of the historical record led scholars to confuse the Ciboney with both a neighbouring group, the Guanahatabey, and with archaic-level populations around the Caribbean. Las Casas referred to both the Ciboney and the Guanahatabey, but he was clear they were different: the Guanahatabey were a primitive society of hunter-gatherers in western Cuba, and they spoke a separate language distinct from Taíno. A confusion of the sources led archaeologists to use the term &quot;Ciboney&quot; for the aceramic (lacking pottery) archaeological sites found on various Caribbean islands. As many of these were found in the former Guanahatabey territory, the term became associated with the historical non-Taíno Guanahatabey. Scholars recognized the error in the 1980s and have restored the name &quot;Ciboney&quot; to the Western Taíno people of Cuba.

<doc id="915917" wikidata="Q717313" url="?curid=915917" title="Armies of the Imperial Japanese Army">
<text>was a term in the Imperial Japanese Army used in different ways to designate a variety of large military formations that corresponded to the army group, field army, and corps in the militaries of Western nations.

==General Armies==

The was the highest level in the organizational structure of the Imperial Japanese Army. It corresponded to the army group in western military terminology. Intended to be self-sufficient for indefinite periods, the general armies were commanded by either a field marshal or a full general.

The initial General Army was the Japanese Manchurian Army, formed from 1904 to 1905 during the Russo-Japanese War as a temporary command structure to coordinate the efforts of several Japanese armies in the campaign against Imperial Russia.

In terms of a permanent standing organization, the Japanese Army created the &quot;Kantōgun&quot;, usually known in English as the Kwantung Army, to manage its overseas deployment in the Kwantung Territory and Manchukuo from 1906.

Subsequent general armies were created in response to the needs of the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II, in which increased overseas deployment called for an organizational structure that could respond quickly and autonomously from the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff in Tokyo. As a result, Japanese forces were re-organized into three separate overseas operational commands: (Manchuria, China and Southeast Asia), with the Japanese home islands forming a fourth.

Towards the end of World War II, the home island command (i.e. the General Defense Command) was restructured geographically into the First General Army in the east, Second General Army in the west, and the Air General Army in charge of military aviation.

With the official Japanese surrender in September 1945, all of the general armies were dissolved, except for the First General Army, which continued to exist until November 30, 1945, as the 1st Demobilization Headquarters.

==Area Armies==
 in Japanese military terminology were equivalent to field armies in western militaries. Area Armies were normally commanded by a general or lieutenant general. There is much confusion between the similarly numbered Area Armies and Armies in historical records, as many writers often did not make a clear distinction when describing the units involved.

==Armies==
The Japanese corresponded to an army corps in American or British military terminology. It was usually commanded by a lieutenant general.

<text>The Harvard Independent colloquially known as “The Indy” is a weekly newspaper produced by undergraduate students at Harvard University.

==Origin and history==
The &quot;Independent&quot; was founded in 1969 by students and alumni who felt the campus needed an alternative to &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. The &quot;Crimson&quot; at the time reflected the left-wing turn of student organizations throughout the nation in the 1960s, and the founders of the &quot;Independent&quot; felt politically alienated from &quot;Crimson&quot; editors.

As the decades passed, the weekly newspaper, released every Thursday and distributed both on the Internet and to Harvard College student dormitories, the format morphed to that of an alternative weekly rather than a standard newspaper, with illustrated covers and four main sections: News, Sports, Arts, and the Forum (Op-Ed) section. In addition, the &quot;Independent&quot; also has several themed issues each year, including the annual The Game issue for the Harvard-Yale game, the literary issue, and the Sex Issue, featuring the results of a campus-wide anonymous survey on sexual practices and opinions at Harvard.

The &quot;Independent&quot; no longer has any political affiliation.

==Notable alumni ==
* President and Editor-in-Chief of Reuters, Stephen J. Adler
* Political blogger Matthew Yglesias
* Staples founder, Thomas G. Stemberg
* Former Executive Editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Jill Abramson
* Ben Mezrich, author of The Accidental Billionaires
* Scott Stossel, editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine
* Richard Tofel, general manager of ProPublica
* Trevor Potter, former chairman of the Federal Election Commission and founder of the Campaign Legal Center
* Amy Finkelstein, winner of the John Bates Clark Medal
* Kannon Shanmugam, Supreme Court litigator

<text>Eric Charles Radcliffe (often credited as E.C. Radcliffe, born 3 December 1950) is an English recording engineer and producer who worked with new wave and synthpop bands in the early 1980s in Basildon, England. He later became owner of Blackwing Studios.

==Background==
Eric Radcliffe is believed to have had a huge part in the success of Yazoo (Yaz in the USA). In March 1984 Radcliffe gave an interview to &quot;Electronics and Music Maker&quot; in which he mentioned how he got into the business:

When I was about fifteen the group I was in was booked into a four-track studio to do some demos, and I got a taste for recording then. I got an Akai reel-to-reel at home and I built a studio in the front room, with multi-core cable running into my bedroom which acted as the control room... it snowballed... eventually I was able to afford an eight-track TEAC and it was with that machine that I came up to London and set-up the studio here, which I called Blackwing and it took off in earnest...

And a snippet on his contribution to the Yazoo sound:

We often combine more than one [device] to create a sound. One particular one that sticks in my memory is the snare-drum sound on Yazoo&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Go&quot;, I did that using the Lexicon 224 and 224x [reverbs] ganged together. We came across that sound entirely by accident, but then again, in the final analysis I think you discover almost everything by accident, just by fiddling around.

After Yazoo, Radcliffe and Yazoo-songwriter Vince Clarke continued to work together. As the Assembly they released the single &quot;Never Never&quot; with singer Feargal Sharkey in the autumn of 1983. Clarke and Radcliffe also founded the record company Reset Records, and released singles with Robert Marlow, Peter Hewson, Hardware and Absolute, until 1987 when the label shut down.

Eric Radcliffe now lives in Gravesend in Kent, with his three daughters Kai, Fay and Mae. In the documentary video accompanying Yazoo&#x27;s 25th anniversary release &quot;In Your Room&quot;, Eric Radcliffe delivers the following message:

I count myself fortunate and privileged to have worked with such a talented team. I remember that we had to build a studio in my house (in about ten days) to complete the recording of &quot;Upstairs at Eric&#x27;s&quot; because Blackwing Studios London was fully booked. My mother provided us all with her famous &quot;egg and chips&quot; and also appeared on the record. Wonderful days!
:Best regards

<text>Afognak (Alutiiq: &quot;Agw’aneq&quot;; ) is an island in the Kodiak Archipelago north of Kodiak Island in the U.S. state of Alaska. It is long from east to west and wide from north to south and has a land area of , making it the 18th largest island in the United States. The coast is split by many long, narrow bays. The highest point is .

The dense spruce forests of Afognak are home to Kodiak bears, Roosevelt elk, and Sitka black-tailed deer. Many people visit the island recreationally for hunting and fishing.

==History==
The United States Census of 1890 noted a series of settlements along the beachline near the Alutiiq village of &quot;Ag’waneq&quot; (also called Afognak), including Rutkovsky village, inhabited by a group of retired employees of the Russian-American Company.

Ag’waneq was abandoned after the 1964 Good Friday earthquake devastated the island. The descendants of the Alaska Native inhabitants of the island are officially recognized as the Native Village of Afognak. Most of them now live in Port Lions or Kodiak.

In the early 21st century, there are a few small logging camps and fishing lodges on the island. A community of Russian Old Believers live at Aleneva. The economy is based on subsistence and logging. Transportation is provided by float plane from Kodiak to various areas around the island. The 2000 census reported a population of 169 persons.

<text>The Vienna Game is an opening in chess that begins with the moves:
:1. 
:2. 

White&#x27;s second move is less common than 2.Nf3, and is also more recent.

The original idea behind the Vienna Game was to play a delayed King&#x27;s Gambit with f4 (the Vienna Gambit), but in modern play White often plays more (for example, by fianchettoing their king&#x27;s bishop with g3 and Bg2). Black most often continues with . The opening can also lead to the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation.

Weaver W. Adams famously claimed that the Vienna Game led to a for White. Nick de Firmian concludes in the 15th edition of &quot;Modern Chess Openings&quot;, however, that the opening leads to with by both sides.
==Falkbeer Variation: 2...Nf6 ==
After 2...Nf6, the Falkbeer Variation, White has three main options: 3.f4, 3.Bc4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3 transposes to the Petrov&#x27;s Three Knights Game, which after 3...Nc6 leads to the Four Knights Game.

===3.f4===

At grandmaster level, the gambit move 3.f4 is considered too risky an opening. It is best met by 3...d5, striking back in the center.

Lines other than 3...d5 give White at least an edge, however, making this a good choice for aggressive play at lower levels, where opponents are unlikely to know that 3...d5 is best.

The gambit should not be accepted, since 3...exf4 4.e5 Qe7 5.Qe2 forces Black&#x27;s knight to retreat with 5...Ng8, and after 6.Nf3, Black must be careful not to lose on the spot, for example after 6...d6? 7.Nd5!, when the dual ideas of Nxc7 and exd6 will win the game quickly. Retreating immediately with 4...Ng8 is better, but after 5.Nf3 with the idea of d4 followed by Bxf4, White has a nice game.

Other lines for Black include 3...d6 4.Nf3 Nc6 5.Bb5 Bd7 6.d3, when the threat of Bxc6 followed by taking on e5 induces 6...exf4 7.Bxf4, leaving White with a pleasant position; and also 3...Nc6? 4.fxe5! Nxe5 5.d4, when both 5...Nc6 and 5...Ng6 are met by 6.e5 with a winning advantage to White. Material is not as important as the attack in this position, so White should not be afraid to sacrifice.

===3.Bc4===

The move 3.Bc4 leads to a position which can also be reached from the Bishop&#x27;s Opening (1.e4 e5 2.Bc4). Black has several choices here; 3...Bc5 can transpose to the King&#x27;s Gambit Declined after 4.d3 d6 5.f4 Nc6 6.Nf3; 3...Nc6 4.d3, 4...Na5, 4...Bc5 or 4...d6 are all playable; 3...Bb4 4.f4 Nxe4 5.Qh5 0-0 leads to wild but probably equal play, according to de Firmian in &quot;MCO-15&quot;. 

3...Nxe4, 4.Qh5 (threatening Qxf7#) 4...Nd6 5.Bb3 when Black can either go for the relatively quiet waters of 5...Be7 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.Nxe5 g6 8.Qe2 (or 8.Nxc6 dxc6 9.Qe5 0-0) Nd4 9.Qd3 Nxb3 10.axb3 Nf5 11.0-0 d6, which led to equality in Anand–Ivanchuk, Roquebrune 1992. Or the complexities of 5...Nc6 6.Nb5 g6 7.Qf3 f5 8.Qd5 Qe7 9.Nxc7+ Kd8 10.Nxa8 b6, which the Irish correspondence chess player and theorist Tim Harding extravagantly dubbed &quot;the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation&quot;.
4.Nxe4 d5 forks bishop and knight is fine for Black. 4.Bxf7+ is weak; after 4...Kxf7 5.Nxe4 d5 (inferior is 5...Nc6 6.Qf3+, when Black cannot play 6...Kg8 because of 7.Ng5! Davids–Diggle, London Banks League 1949, while 6...Ke8 leaves the king awkwardly placed in the center) 6.Qf3+ (6.Qh5+ g6 7.Qxe5 Bh6! wins for Black) Kg8 7.Ng5 (hoping for 7...Qxg5?? 8.Qxd5+ and mate the next move, Schottlaender–Ed. Lasker, simultaneous exhibition, Breslau c. 1902) Qd7!, with a large advantage for Black in view of his and pawn center.

===Mieses Variation: 3.g3 ===

The move 3.g3, the Mieses Variation, is a quiet continuation in which White fianchettoes his king&#x27;s bishop, a line played by Vasily Smyslov on a few occasions, most notably in a win over Lev Polugaevsky in the 1961 USSR Championship. That game continued 3...d5 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Bg2 Be6 6.Nf3 Nc6 7.0-0 Be7 8.Re1 Bf6 9.Ne4 0-0 10.d3 Be7 11.a3 Nb6 12.b4, resulting in a position which the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings&quot; assesses as slightly better for White. The main line today, however, is considered to be 5...Nxc3 6.bxc3 Bd6 7.Nf3 0-0 8.0-0. A major alternative for Black is 3...Bc5 (3...Nc6 normally transposes into one of the other lines).

===3.a3===
In addition to these lines, the late American master Ariel Mengarini advocated the whimsical 3.a3, sometimes called Mengarini&#x27;s Opening. It is not a serious try for advantage, but is essentially a useful waiting move that gives White an improved version of Black&#x27;s position after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6. First, the &quot;Reversed Ruy Lopez&quot; with 3...Bb4 is ruled out. Second, after 3...d5, 4.exd5 Nxd5 5.Qh5!? gives White an improved version of the Steinitz Variation of the Scotch Game, since Black can never play ...Nb4, an important idea for White in the mirror-image position. Third, after 3...Bc5, 4.Nf3 gives a reversed Two Knights Defense. Then the typical 4...Ng4 may be met by 5.d4 exd4 6.Na4, when 6...Bb4+, White&#x27;s usual move in the mirror-image position, is impossible. After 4...Ng4, White may also play improved versions of the Ulvestad Variation (6.b4 in the above line) and Fritz Variation (6.Nd5 c6 7.b4), since when White plays b4 his pawn is protected, unlike in the mirror-image position. If Black plays more quietly with 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 Nc6, then 5.Nxe5! Nxe5 6.d4 gives White some advantage. The best line for Black may be 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d5 5.exd5 0-0 (better than 5...e4 6.d4, when the normal 6...Bb4 is impossible), and if 6.Nxe5, 6...Re8 7.d4 Bxd4! 8.Qxd4 Nc6, as in the mirror-image line. Also possible is 3...Bc5 4.Nf3 d6, when Black stands well after 5.Bc4 Be6, while 5.d4 cxd4 6.Nxd4 gives White little or no advantage.

==Max Lange Defence: 2...Nc6 ==
After 2...Nc6, the Max Lange Defence, White again has three main options, 3.Bc4, 3.f4, and 3.g3. Note that 3.Nf3 transposes to the Three Knights Game, which after 3...Nf6 leads to the Four Knights Game.

===Vienna Gambit: 3.f4 ===
In the Vienna Gambit, defined by the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4, White sacrifices a pawn to gain control of the center. The Vienna Gambit must be played near-perfectly by Black or they can find themselves quickly grasping for central control that may never come. With optimal play, Black refuses White&#x27;s Gambit of the f-pawn and plays 3. ...d5, striking back in the center. Play continues 4. fxe5 Nxe4 when White has an array of options to choose from for their next move. A popular move—one that includes a potential trap for your opponent—is 5. d3, at which point Black should exchange Knights and both players will have a comfortable game; White will attempt to play along the b-file and maintain their strong center, while Black will try and undermine White&#x27;s central advantage. 

Comparatively, if Black plays 5. ...Qh4+ White may calmly play 6. g3 which will likely be followed by 6. ...Nxg3 6. Nf3 Qh5 7. Nxd5!! and while the position is technically still equal, White has an easier position to play and will likely prove comfortable later on. 

====Hamppe–Muzio Gambit ====
The Hamppe–Muzio Gambit (or Vienna Hamppe–Muzio Gambit) is characterised by the continuation 3...exf4 4.Nf3 g5 5.Bc4 g4 6.0-0 gxf3 7.Qxf3 (see diagram).

As with its close relative, the sharp Muzio Gambit, White sacrifices the knight on f3 in return for a powerful attack against the black king. It is named after Austrian theoretician Carl Hamppe and classified under &quot;ECO&quot; code C25. The Dubois Variation continues 7...Ne5 8.Qxf4 Qf6.

6.d4 is the Pierce Gambit.

====Steinitz Gambit====

The Steinitz Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.f4 exf4 4.d4, was a favourite of Wilhelm Steinitz, the first World Champion. White allows Black to misplace White&#x27;s king with 4...Qh4+ 5.Ke2 (see diagram), hoping to prove that White&#x27;s pawn center and the exposed position of Black&#x27;s queen are more significant factors. Unlike Steinitz, who famously opined that, &quot;The King is a fighting piece!&quot;, few modern players are willing to expose their king this way. The Steinitz Gambit is thus rarely seen today.
===Paulsen Variation: 3.g3 ===
Louis Paulsen played 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 four times with the white pieces – games against Meitner, Rosenthal, Gelbfuhs, and Bird in the Vienna 1873 chess tournament. Three wins with the variation 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Nc6 3.g3 named the &quot;Paulsen Variation&quot; of the Vienna Game, and the fourth win after 1.e4 e5 2.Nc3 Bc5 3.Nf3 vs. Henry Bird.

===3.Bc4===
Most often, White plays 3.Bc4, when the solid 3...Nf6 transposes to the 2...Nf6 3.Bc4 Nc6 line. Weaker is 3.Bc4 Bc5, when 4.Qg4! is awkward to meet. 4...Kf8 and 4...g6 are thought the best moves, but neither is too appealing for Black. The natural 4...Qf6?? loses to 5.Nd5! Qxf2+ 6.Kd1, when White&#x27;s king is in no real danger, and White has multiple threats: 7.Qxg7; 7.Nxc7+; and 7.Nh3 Qd4 8.d3 threatening to trap Black&#x27;s queen with 9.c3.
==2...Bc5==

This is an offbeat but alternative, as played (for example) by former world champion José Raúl Capablanca against Ilya Kan at Moscow 1936. Some possible moves are 3.Bc4, 3.Nf3, and 3.f4. With move 3.Bc4, ...Nf6 and ...Nc6 can be found above, or Black can play ...d6.

White can continue with 3.Nf3, and if the move 3...Nc6 (transposing to the Three Knights Game) 4.Nxe5! Nxe5 5.d4 Bd6 6.dxe5 Bxe5 7.Bd3 leads to a large advantage for White. Stronger is 3...d6! Then 4.Na4 Nd7 5.d3 Ngf6 6.Be2 0-0 7.0-0 c6 8.Nxc5 Nxc5 9.Ne1 Ne6 10.c3 d5 is about even. The main line runs 4.d4 exd4 5.Nxd4 Nf6 6.Bg5 (6.Be2 d5 7.e5 Ne4 8.0-0 Nxc3 leads to equality) h6 7.Bh4 0-0 8.Nb3 and now de Firmian in &quot;MCO-15&quot; gives 8...Bb4 9.Bd3 Re8 10.0-0 Bxc3 11.bxc3 g5! 12.Bg3 Nxe4, when Black&#x27;s &quot;chances are at least equal&quot;.

After 3.f4, ...d6 leads to the King&#x27;s Gambit Declined. Weak is 3.Qg4 Nf6! 4.Qxg7 Rg8 5.Qh6 Bxf2+ when Black had a large advantage in Tsikhelashvili–Karpov, USSR 1968, since 6.Kxf2?? Ng4+ would win White&#x27;s queen. Another offbeat possibility is 3.Na4, the Hamppe Variation, when 3...Bxf2+! 4.Kxf2 Qh4+ 5.Ke3 Qf4+ 6.Kd3 d5 leads to wild complications favouring Black, as in the famous Immortal Draw game Hamppe–Meitner, Vienna 1872. The quiet 3...Be7, however, leaves Black with a good game.

<doc id="915942" wikidata="Q1668640" url="?curid=915942" title="Shelikof Strait">
<text>Shelikof Strait () is a strait on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Alaska between the Alaska mainland to the west and Kodiak and Afognak islands to the east.

Shelikof Strait separates the mainland coastal strip of the Kodiak Island Borough from its Kodiak Island portion and is about 150 statute miles (240 kilometers) long and 25 to 30 statute miles (40 to 48 kilometers) wide. Cook Inlet is at its northern end. The strait is well known for its extreme tidal flow due to its close proximity to Cook Inlet, which can have maximum tidal variances of up to .

The strait is named after Grigory Shelikhov (1747–1795), also spelled &quot;Shelikof&quot;, the Russian fur trader who founded the first Russian settlement in what is now Alaska at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island in 1784.

The United States Navy seaplane tender USS &quot;Shelikof&quot;, in commission from 1944 to 1947 and from 1952 to 1954, was named for Shelikof Strait.

<text>Kirsty Leigh Coventry Seward (née Coventry; born 16 September 1983) is a Zimbabwean swimmer and politician currently serving as the Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation in the Cabinet of Zimbabwe since September 2018. A former Olympic swimmer and world record holder, she is the most decorated Olympian from Africa. She is a member of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), and was elected the Chairperson of the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission, the body that represents all Olympic athletes worldwide in early 2018.

Born in Harare, Coventry attended and swam competitively for Auburn University in Alabama, in the United States. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, in Athens, Greece, Coventry won three Olympic medals: a gold, a silver, and a bronze, while in the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing she won four medals: a gold and three silver. She was subsequently described by Paul Chingoka, head of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee, as &quot;our national treasure&quot;.

Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe called her &quot;a golden girl,&quot; and personally awarded her US$100,000 in cash for her 2008 Olympic performance. In 2016, Coventry retired from swimming after her fifth Olympics, having won the joint-most individual medals in women&#x27;s swimming in Olympic history.

==Swimming career==

=== 2000 Olympics ===
In 2000, while still in high school, Coventry became the first Zimbabwean swimmer to reach the semifinals at the Olympics and was named Zimbabwe&#x27;s Sports Woman of the Year.

=== 2004 Olympics ===
At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Coventry won three medals, including a gold medal in the 200 meter backstroke.

=== College career ===
As a student at Auburn University, Coventry helped lead the Tigers to National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Championships in 2003 and 2004. In 2005, she was the top individual scorer at the NCAA Championships and captured three individual titles including the 200-yard and 400 y individual medley (IM), and the 200 y backstroke for the second consecutive season. She was named the College Swimming Coaches Association Swimmer of the Meet for her efforts. Other awards include 2005 Southeastern Conference (SEC) Swimmer of the Year, and the 2004–05 SEC Female Athlete of the Year. She was also the recipient of the 2004–05 Honda Sports Award for Swimming and Diving, recognizing her as the outstanding college female swimmer of the year.

=== 2005 World Championships ===
At the 2005 World Championships in Montreal, Coventry improved on her 2004 Olympic medal count by winning gold in both the 100 m and 200 m backstroke and silver in the 200 m and the 400 m IM. She bettered her Olympic gold-winning 200 m backstroke time with a performance of 2:08.52. She was one of just two swimmers from Zimbabwe along with rising junior Warren Paynter. Her performance allowed her country to rank third in the medal count by nation. In addition, she picked up the female swimmer of the meet honors.

=== 2007 World Championships ===
In Melbourne at the 2007 World Championships, Coventry won silver medals in the 200 m backstroke and 200 m IM. She was disqualified in the 400 m IM when finishing second to eventual winner Katie Hoff in her heat. Coventry finished in a disappointing 14th place in the 100 m backstroke in a time of 1:01.73, failing to qualify for the final. She continued her good form of 2007 by winning four gold medals at the International Swim Meet in Narashino, Japan. She led the way in the 200 m and 400 m IM as well as the 100 m and 200 m backstroke.

=== 2008 ===
In 2008, Coventry broke her first world record in the 200 m backstroke at the Missouri Grand Prix. She bettered the mark set by Krisztina Egerszegi in August 1991, the second oldest swimming world record. Her new record was 2:06:39. Coventry continued her winning streak at the meet by winning the 100 m backstroke and the 200 m IM. Coventry is the third woman in history to break the 1:00 minute barrier in the 100 m backstroke, and the second to break the 59-second barrier.

At the 2008 Manchester Short Course World Championships, Coventry broke her second world record, setting a time, whilst winning the gold medal, of 4:26:52 in the 400 m IM. The following day saw Coventry win her second gold medal of the championships in the 100 m backstroke. Her time of 57:10 was a new championship record and the second fastest time in history in the event. Only Natalie Coughlin has swum faster (56:51). Day three of the championships saw Coventry break another championship record in qualifying fastest for the final of the 200 m backstroke. Her time of 2:03:69 was a mere four tenths of a second outside the current world record set by Reiko Nakamura in Tokyo in 2008. Coventry then bettered this time to take her second world record of the championships by winning the final in a time of 2:00:91. She then went on to shatter the short course World Record in winning the 200 m individual medley in 2:06:13. Due to her performances at the World Championships, Coventry was named as the FINA Female Swimmer of the Championships.

Coventry represented Zimbabwe at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Coventry won the silver medal in the 400 m individual medley on 10 August 2008, becoming the second woman to swim the medley in less than 4:30, the first being Stephanie Rice who won the gold in the same event. Coventry beat the world record by just under two seconds, and was only just beaten by Rice to a new world record. Coventry, in the second semi-final of the 100 m Backstroke, set a new world record of 58.77 seconds. However, in the final of that event she was beaten to the gold medal by Natalie Coughlin. Coventry was again beaten by Stephanie Rice in the 200 m individual medley, despite swimming under the old world record. Coventry did defend her Olympic title in the 200 m backstroke, winning gold in a world record time of 2:05.24.

Awarded US$100,000 by President Mugabe for her success at the Olympics, Coventry gave that money to charity.

=== 2009 World Championships ===

At the 2009 World Championships in Rome, Coventry won a gold and a silver. She won the 200 m backstroke world title with a world record time and came second in the 400 m individual medley. She came fourth in the 200 m individual medley final and eighth in the 100 m backstroke final.

=== 2012 and 2016 Olympics ===

At the 2012 Olympics in London, Coventry finished third in her semifinal heat of the 200 m individual medley, just edging her into the final, where she placed 6th with a time of 2:11.13. In the 200 m backstroke, she finished outside the medals in sixth place with a time of 2:08.18.

Her fifth and final Olympic appearance came at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where she repeated her 6th-place performance in the 200 meter backstroke from 2012, with a time of 2:08.80. She also finished 11th in the 100 meter backstroke. She retired after the 2016 Olympics.

==International Olympic Committee==
In 2012, she was elected to the International Olympic Committee Athletes&#x27; Commission. She is serving as an IOC member for eight years. In 2023, she became an elected member of the IOC Executive Committee. In September 2024, she was announced as one of seven candidates in the running to succeed Thomas Bach as IOC president.

==Political career==
On 7 September 2019, eight days shy of her 35th birthday, Coventry was appointed Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation in Zimbabwe&#x27;s 20-member Cabinet under President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

Her tenure has received criticism from the arts community and others due to perceived inaction and lack of support.

Coventry was accused of having been misallocated farmland by Robert Zhuwao, former President Robert Mugabe&#x27;s nephew, but was cleared after it was revealed in court that she received a completely different subdivision of the farm in question and that Zhuwao had abandoned his unrelated subdivision.

In September 2023, Kirsty Coventry was re-appointed as Zimbabwe’s Minister for Sports, Art and Recreation by the country’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa.

==Personal life==
Coventry attended Dominican Convent High School, Harare, in Zimbabwe until 1999.

On 10 August 2013, Coventry married Tyrone Seward who had been her manager since 2010.
In May 2019, she gave birth to her first child.

==Swimming results==
With seven Olympic medals, Coventry is the most decorated Olympian from Africa. At the time of her retirement, she had tied with Krisztina Egerszegi for having won the most individual Olympic medals in women&#x27;s swimming. This feat has since been equaled by Katie Ledecky. Coventry competed at five Olympics, from 2000–2016. She won all but one of Zimbabwe&#x27;s Olympic medals.

<text>Rodel () is a village on the south-eastern coast of Harris, an island in the Scottish Outer Hebrides. Rodel is situated in the parish of Harris. It was historically the capital of Harris, and the main port, before Tarbert took the title.

St Clement&#x27;s Church (Eaglais Chliamhain) is a 16th-century church which was founded by the 8th Chief of MacLeod and is dedicated to Pope Clement I. The church was built using local Lewisian gneiss rock. It overlooks Loch Rodel. This well-preserved church is currently under the responsibility of Historic Scotland.

Located near the harbour is Rodel Hotel. This was built in 1781 and was originally home to Captain Alexander MacLeod of Berneray who had bought the Isle of Harris in 1779. It was restored in 2001, and then sold to Anderson Bakewell and his wife Francine Stone in 2016.

<text>Bunim/Murray Productions is an American entertainment production company based out of Glendale, California and owned by French television media conglomerate Banijay Entertainment since 25 March 2010. Considered as a pioneer in the reality television genre with local hit programs like &quot;The Real World&quot;, &quot;Road Rules&quot; and &quot;Bad Girls Club&quot;, it was founded in 1987 by Mary-Ellis Bunim and Jonathan Murray after an agent named Mark Itkin of the William Morris Agency put the two together to develop a scripted soap opera for MTV. When that was too expensive, they decided to try an unscripted soap and &quot;The Real World&quot; was born. &quot;We knew within 20 minutes of shooting that we had a show,&quot; Bunim said. The company has expanded into music management, managing the pop punk/emo band A Cursive Memory. 

The company&#x27;s initial success was on the creation of &quot;The Real World&quot;. Attempts at scripted series, including &quot;Jam Bay&quot;, a show that would have co-produced with Universal Television for ABC, never went past the pilot stage. On June 28, 1999, the company attempted to enter into the syndication business, by planning on to partner with Columbia TriStar Television Distribution to launch a reality strip &quot;Love Hurts&quot;. In 2001, Bunim/Murray partnered with Artists Television Group, on the unaired WB television show &quot;Lost in the USA&quot;, but it was cancelled and it was hit with a $1 million lawsuit. On December 16, 2002, the company announced that they would partner with film studio New Line Cinema on the company&#x27;s only theatrical project, &quot;The Real Cancun&quot;.

==Sexual assault controversy==
In October 2011, two years after &quot;Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Ruins&quot; aired, contestant Tonya Cooley filed a lawsuit against fellow contestants Kenny Santucci and Evan Starkman, MTV, and Bunim/Murray Productions, claiming that she was sexually assaulted during filming. Cooley claimed in the lawsuit that Santucci and Starkman inserted a toothbrush into her vaginal canal while she was passed out from heavy drinking, and stated that she was subjected to an environment in which degrading and harassing behavior was directed at female contestants, including bathing suits stripped off their bodies. A representative for Bunim/Murray said that &quot;after a thorough investigation, we have found Tonya Cooley’s claims to be completely baseless.&quot; Cooley also alleged that the show&#x27;s producers encouraged and rewarded such behavior, and that when she raised concerns she was told to &quot;just deal with it.&quot; A representative for Viacom blamed Cooley for the alleged assault against her, stating in court that &quot;in addition to failing to avail herself of VMN&#x27;s policies and complaint procedures, Plaintiff failed to avoid the injuries of which she complains. For example, while she was a contestant on &quot;The Ruins&quot;, Plaintiff was frequently intoxicated (to an extent far greater than other contestants), rowdy, combative, flirtatious and on multiple occasions intentionally exposed her bare breasts and genitalia to other contestants.&quot; The lawsuit was settled out of court one year later.

<doc id="915972" wikidata="Q1045925" url="?curid=915972" title="Aramaic original New Testament theory">
<text>The Aramaic original New Testament theory is the belief that the Christian New Testament was originally written in Aramaic.

There are several versions of the New Testament in Aramaic languages:

#the &quot;Vetus Syra&quot; (Old Syriac), a translation from Greek into early Classical Syriac, containing most—but not all—of the text of the 4 Gospels, and represented in the Curetonian Gospels and the Sinaitic Palimpsest
#the Christian Palestinian Aramaic Lectionary fragments represented in such manuscripts as Codex Climaci Rescriptus, Codex Sinaiticus Rescriptus, and later lectionary codices (Vatican sir. 19 [A]; St Catherine&#x27;s Monastery B, C, D)
#the Classical Syriac Peshitta, a rendering in Aramaic of the Hebrew (and some Aramaic, e.g. in Daniel and Ezra) Old Testament, plus the New Testament purportedly in its original Aramaic, and still the standard in most Syriac churches
#the Harklean, a strictly literal translation by Thomas of Harqel into Classical Syriac from Greek
#the Assyrian Modern Version, a new translation into Assyrian Neo-Aramaic from the Greek published in 1997 and mainly in use among Protestants
#and a number of other scattered versions in various dialects

The traditional New Testament of the Peshitta has 22 books, lacking the Second Epistle of John, the Third Epistle of John, the Second Epistle of Peter, the Epistle of Jude and the Book of Revelation, which are books of the Antilegomena. Closure of the Church of the East&#x27;s New Testament Canon occurred before the &#x27;Western Five&#x27; books could be incorporated. Its Gospels text also lacks the verses known as Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (John 7:53–8:11) and Luke 22:17–18, but does have the &#x27;long ending of Mark.&#x27;

==Greek original New Testament hypothesis==

The consensus of modern scholars is that the New Testament was written in Greek and that an Aramaic source text was used for portions of the New Testament, especially the gospels. They hypothesize that many individual sayings of Jesus as found in the Greek Gospels may be translations from an Aramaic source referred to as &quot;Q source&quot; (from the German word &quot;Quelle&quot;, meaning &quot;source&quot;), but hold that the Gospels&#x27; text in its current form was composed in Greek, and so were the other New Testament writings. Scholars of all stripes have acknowledged the presence of scattered Aramaic expressions, written phonetically and then translated, in the Greek New Testament.

In an 1887 book, John Hancock Pettingell says &quot;The common impression that the entire New Testament was first written in Greek, and that all the copies we now have, in whatever tongue, are copies, or translations of the original manuscripts, when seriously examined, is found to have no certain foundation. And yet this has been taken almost universally for granted. It is probable, that this is true with respect to some, possibly a majority of these books. But it is more than probable, if not certain, that some portions of the New Testament, such as the Gospel of Matthew, the Epistles to the Hebrews, and others, which will hereafter be mentioned, were first written in the vernacular Syriac of the Jews, and were afterward translated into Greek; and that other portions, perhaps most of the books, were duplicated, at the time they were written, by their authors, or under their direction,—one copy being furnished to those who were familiar with the Greek, and another to those who knew only the Syriac.&quot;

An example of how mainstream scholars have dealt with Aramaic influences within an overall view of the Gospels&#x27; original Greek-language development may be found in Martin Hengel&#x27;s synthesis of studies of the linguistic situation in Palestine during the time of Jesus and the Gospels:
Since non-literary, simple Greek knowledge or competency in multiple languages was relatively widespread in Jewish Palestine including Galilee, and a Greek-speaking community had already developed in Jerusalem shortly after Easter, one can assume that this linguistic transformation [from &quot;the Aramaic native language of Jesus&quot; to &quot;the Greek Gospels&quot;] began very early. ... [M]issionaries, above all &#x27;Hellenists&#x27; driven out of Jerusalem, soon preached their message in the Greek language. We find them in Damascus as early as 32 or 33. A certain percentage of Jesus&#x27; earliest followers were presumably bilingual and could therefore report, at least in simple Greek, what had been heard and seen. This probably applies to Cephas/Peter, Andrew, Philip or John. Mark, too, who was better educated in Jerusalem than the Galilean fishermen, belonged to this milieu. The great number of phonetically correct Aramaisms and his knowledge of the conditions in Jewish Palestine compel us to assume a Palestinian Jewish-Christian author. Also, the author&#x27;s Aramaic native language is still discernible in the Marcan style.

==Aramaic original New Testament hypothesis==
Although physical evidence has yet to be found, J.S. Assemane in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; stated that a Syriac Gospel dated 78 A.D. was found in Mesopotamia.

The hypothesis that the New Testament text that was read by the Apostles would have preserved the life and sayings of Jesus (as he spoke them in Aramaic – the language of Jesus) before it was translated for those not among them who spoke Greek is not held by the majority of scholars.

Syrian churches say that their history includes compilation of their canon (which lacked the &#x27;Western Five&#x27;) extremely early. Comments John Hancock Pettingell, &quot;There is no question, but that scattered manuscripts of the several books of the New Testament, in Greek, were in existence very early, for the Fathers quote from them,—but there is no evidence that any attempt was made to collect them into one code, or canon, till after the Second or Third Century. But it is certain, on the other hand, that the Syrian Churches had their canon long before this collection was made; tradition says, between the years 55 and 60, and that this was done by the Apostle Jude. This canon is known to have contained all the books now included in our New Testament, excepting the Apocalypse, and the brief Epistles of 2d Peter, 2d and 3d John, and Jude. This tradition is strongly corroborated by the fact that these closing portions of our present canon were not then written; and this is a good and sufficient reason why they were not included in the first collection. The abrupt closing of the Book of Acts—for it was evidently written at about that time—that it might be ready for inclusion in this collection, goes to confirm the tradition as to the date of this collection. The Apocalypse and the four short Epistles which were not in readiness to be included at that early date, were afterward received into the Syriac Canon, but not till the sixth century.&quot;

The most noteworthy advocate of the &quot;Peshitta-original&quot; hypothesis in the West was George Lamsa of the Aramaic Bible Center. A tiny minority of more recent scholars are backers of the Peshitta-original theory today, whereas the overwhelming majority of scholars consider the Peshitta New Testament to be a translation from a Greek original. For instance Sebastian Brock wrote:

(Lamsa and Bauscher did not translate the Old Testament Peshitta&#x27;s deuterocanonical books, but did translate the remainder of the Peshitta Old Testament, plus the New Testament. Gorgias Press has published translations of many Peshitta Old Testament books, and of the entire Peshitta New Testament.)

E. Jan Wilson writes, &quot;I believe firmly that both Matthew and Luke were derived from Aramaic originals.&quot;

Some advocates of the &quot;Peshitta-original&quot; theory also use the term &quot;Aramaic primacy&quot;, though this is not used in academic sources. The expression &quot;Aramaic primacy&quot; was used by L. I. Levine, but only as a general expression used to denote the primacy of Aramaic over Hebrew and Greek in Jerusalem during the Second Temple period (i.e. roughly 200 BC – 70 AD). The earliest appearance of the phrase in print is in David Bauscher.

Charles Cutler Torrey, while teaching at Yale, wrote a series of books that presented detailed manuscripturial evidence supporting the Aramaic New Testament, starting with &quot;The Translations Made from the Original Aramaic Gospels&quot;, and including the widely known &quot;Our Translated Gospels&quot;.

==History==
George Lamsa&#x27;s translation of the Peshitta New Testament from Syriac into English brought the claims for primacy of the Aramaic New Testament to the West. However, his translation is poorly regarded by most scholars in the field. The Old Syriac Texts, the Sinai palimpsest and the Curetonian Gospels, have also influenced scholars concerning original Aramaic passages. Diatessaronic texts such as the Liege Dutch Harmony, the Pepysian Gospel Harmony, Codex Fuldensis, the Persian Harmony, the Arabic Diatessaron, and the Commentary on the Diatessaron by Ephrem the Syrian have provided recent insights into Aramaic origins. The Coptic Gospel of Thomas and the various versions of the medieval Hebrew Gospel of Matthew also have provided clues to Aramaic foundations in the New Testament especially the gospels. Many 19th Century scholars (H. Holtzmann, Wendt, Jülicher, Wernle, Soden, Wellhausen, Harnack, B. Weiss, Nicolardot, W. Allen, Montefiore, Plummer, and Stanton) theorized that portions of the gospels, especially Matthew, were derived from an Aramaic source normally referred to as Q.

===Argument using the Arabic Diatessaron for the old age of the Peshitta===

Tatian died in A.D. 175. Reasoning and textual evidence suggest that Tatian started with the 4 Gospels in the Aramaic Peshitta, and interwove Gospel passages into one consolidated harmonized narrative to get his Diatesseron, in the process quoting three-fourths of the 4 Gospels. We presently lack Tatian&#x27;s Diatessaron in its original Aramaic, but do have it in translation in Arabic, a language related to Aramaic. A large number of parallels exist between the Peshitta&#x27;s 4 Gospels and what is in the &#x27;Arabic Diatessaron.&#x27; Paul Younan says,
&quot;It makes perfect sense that a harmony of the Gospels would necessarily require that the distinct 4 Gospels actually existed prior to the harmony. This is common sense. It makes ever more sense that an &quot;Aramaic&quot; harmony of the Gospels, which Tatian&#x27;s Diatesseron was, was woven together from the 4 distinct &quot;Aramaic&quot; Gospels. ... Since the Arabic translation by Ibn al-Tayyib is the only one we know for sure was made directly from the Aramaic, and since it reads like the Peshitta..., and since we know that a harmony necessitates a base of 4 distinct Gospels from which it must be drawn – I submit that Tatian&#x27;s Aramaic Diatesseron was a harmony of the distinct Gospels in Aramaic we currently find today in the canon of scripture we know as the Peshitta.
Occam&#x27;s Razor is a logical principle which states that one should not increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything. In other words, the simplest explanation is usually the best. The simplest explanation is that Tatian created a harmony of the Peshitta gospels. This harmony existed in Persia until at least the 11th century, when it was translated into Arabic. ...if we are to believe the textual evidence in the Arabic translation... the Peshitta Gospels were the base of the Diatesseron which history attributes to Tatian. And this places the Peshitta Gospels at or before 175 A.D.&quot;

The Arabic Diatessaron has been translated into English, Latin, French, and German.

===Argument from geographical details for the old age of the Peshitta===

Advocates of the Aramaic being written first, and then translated into Greek, have pointed out the geographical details present in the Peshitta, but lacking in Greek mss.; those advocates ask what&#x27;s the best explanation for the presence of those geographical details in the Peshitta, but lacking in Greek mss.

Johann David Michaelis states:

William Norton states:

===Argument from bad Greek grammar in Revelation to it not being originally Greek===
Torrey opines that Revelation was originally in Aramaic, and points to grammatical monstrosities as evidence that it was not originally written in Greek:

===Historical criticism===
An argument that at least one of the Greek books of the New Testament have been translated out of the Aramaic comes from a textual analysis of those attributed to the Apostle John. Their variation in writing style is so considerable, that it would preclude them having been written in Greek by the same author. St Dionysius of Alexandria lent support to this argument, when pointing out how John&#x27;s style of writing differs so markedly between his Gospel and Revelation. He concluded that the sophisticated writer of the former could not have written the clumsy Greek of the latter. Thus, the only way for John to have been the author of Revelation is for it to have been penned by a translator. However, Dionysius himself left open the possibility that it was written in Greek &quot;by a holy and inspired writer&quot; other than John.

Some have argued that the Aramaic gospels are older than the Greek gospels, and that the Aramaic NT wasn&#x27;t derived from the Greek NT. William Norton commented in 1889:

Norton later adds (on p. xlvii):

Norton mentions (on lix–lx) additional scholars who had high regard for the Aramaic, and gives a fuller exposition of Michaelis:

===Mistranslations===
Writing in 1936, Charles Cutler Torrey explains that the mistranslation at Jn 14:2 arose from an erroneous vocalization.

<text>Cornelia Pfohl (born 23 February 1971) is a German archer who contested four consecutive Summer Olympic Games from 1992 to 2004. She is a two-time Olympic medalist in the women&#x27;s team event, winning silver medal in 1996 and bronze medal in 2000. She attracted attention at both the 2000 and 2004 Olympics for competing while pregnant with her first and second child respectively.

==Career==
===Olympic career===
;1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics
Pfohl made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, finishing forty-fourth overall in the women&#x27;s individual event. She was also a member of the German team that finished the women&#x27;s team competition in tenth place.

At the 1996 Summer Olympics Pfohl reached the final of the women&#x27;s team event. With Germany leading their opponents South Korea by a single point with nine of the match&#x27;s twenty-seven arrows left, Pfohl shot into the outermost ring of the target, scoring just one point and allowing South Korea to pull ahead to win their third consecutive team gold medal.

;2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics
Pfohl competed in the 2000 Summer Olympics while in the early stages of pregnancy with her daughter Mara. She won her second Olympic medal with bronze in the women&#x27;s team event, and concluded the women&#x27;s individual event in twenty-fourth place. She was awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by Federal President Johannes Rau for winning bronze.

Pfohl&#x27;s qualification for her fourth Olympic Games in 2004 was unexpected, and caused her to delay her plans to get married. Her participation in Athens came while she was pregnant again, this time at 30 weeks with her second child. She placed eighteenth in the ranking round for the women&#x27;s individual competition. In the first round of elimination, she faced 47th-ranked Marie-Pier Beaudet of Canada. Pfohl defeated Beaudet, winning 146–128 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced Margarita Galinovskaya of Russia, losing to the 15th-ranked archer 158–156 in the regulation 18 arrows.

<doc id="915974" wikidata="Q442386" url="?curid=915974" title="Seth (cartoonist)">
<text>Gregory Gallant (born September 16, 1962), better known by his pen name Seth, is a Canadian cartoonist. He is best known for his series &quot;Palookaville&quot; and his mock-autobiographical graphic novel &quot;It&#x27;s a Good Life, If You Don&#x27;t Weaken&quot; (1996).

Seth draws in a style influenced by the classic cartoonists of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. His work is highly nostalgic, especially for the early-to-mid-20th century period, and of Southern Ontario. His work also shows a great depth and breadth of knowledge of the history of comics and cartooning.

==Early life and education==
Seth was born Gregory Gallant on September 16, 1962, in Clinton, Ontario, Canada. His parents were John
Henry Gallant and the English-born Violet Daisy Gallant ( Wilkinson); he was the youngest of their five children. His family moved frequently but considers Strathroy, Ontario his home town. He was inward, unathletic, and had few friends, and took to comic books and drawing at a young age.

Seth attended the Ontario College of Art in Toronto from 1980 to 1983. He became involved with the punk subculture and began wearing outlandish clothing, bleaching his hair, wearing makeup, and frequenting nightclubs. He took on the pen name &quot;Seth&quot; in 1982.

==Career==
Seth, then living in Toronto, first drew attention to his work in 1985 when he took over art duties from the Hernandez brothers for Dean Motter&#x27;s &quot;Mister X&quot; from Toronto publisher Vortex Comics. His run covered issues (1985–88), after which he did commercial artwork for publications including &quot;Saturday Night&quot; and &quot;Fashion&quot;. In 1986 he met fellow Toronto-based Vortex artist Chester Brown, and in 1991 Toronto-based American cartoonist Joe Matt. The three became noted for doing confessional autobio comics in the early 1990s, and for depicting each other in their works.

In April 1991 he launched his own comic book, &quot;Palookaville&quot;, with Montreal publisher Drawn &amp; Quarterly. By this time, Seth&#x27;s artwork had evolved to a style inspired by &quot;The New Yorker&quot; cartoons of the 1930s and 1940s.
He is also a magazine illustrator and book designer, perhaps best known for his work designing the complete collection of Charles M. Schulz&#x27;s classic comic strip &quot;Peanuts&quot;. The books, released by Fantagraphics Books in 25 separate volumes (so far) combine Seth&#x27;s signature aesthetic with Schulz&#x27;s minimalistic comic creation. Similarly, he is designing the &quot;Collected Doug Wright&quot;, and the John Stanley Library.

Seth&#x27;s illustration work includes the cover artwork for Aimee Mann&#x27;s album &quot;Lost in Space&quot; (2001) and the jacket and French flaps for the Penguin Classics &quot;Portable Dorothy Parker&quot; (2006).

&quot;Clyde Fans&quot;, the story of two brothers whose trade in electric fans suffers and eventually goes out of business from the failure to adapt to the rise of air conditioning, was serialized in &quot;Palooka-ville&quot;. Seth&#x27;s short graphic novel &quot;Wimbledon Green&quot;, about an eccentric comic-book collector, was published in November 2005.

==Graphic novels==
From September 2006 to March 25, 2007, Seth serialized a graphic novel titled &quot;George Sprott (1894–1975)&quot;, for the Funny Pages section of &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. Selections from &quot;George Sprott&quot; were featured in &quot;Best American Comics 2009&quot;. In the liner notes of that publication, Seth announced he was expanding &quot;Sprott&quot; into a book, filling in gaps that were cut to meet the restraints given by &quot;NYTM&quot;. The book was published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly in May 2009.

Seth&#x27;s affection for early- and mid-20th century popular culture and his relative disdain for pop culture since then is a recurrent theme in his work, both in terms of the characters (who are often nostalgic for the period) and his artistic style. 

Seth&#x27;s artwork has landed on the cover of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; three times, which he said was a professional milestone he was happy to achieve.

Seth collaborated with children&#x27;s novelist Lemony Snicket on his four-part series &quot;All the Wrong Questions&quot;, starting with &quot;Who Could That Be at This Hour?&quot; released on October 23, 2012 and ending with &quot;Why Is This Night Different From All Other Nights?&quot; released on September 29, 2015. He also designed a series of book covers for the MIT Press&#x27;s early 20th century science-fiction series Radium Age.

==Model buildings==
 A selection of Seth&#x27;s original models (studies for his fictional city, Dominion) has been exhibited extensively, most notably at the Phoenix Art Museum in 2007 and the Art Gallery of Ontario in 2005 and 2017.

In 2008, Seth collaborated with the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery and RENDER (now the University of Waterloo Art Gallery), on an exhibition titled &quot;The North Star Talking Picture House&quot;. For this exhibition one of the buildings from Seth&#x27;s Dominion City project was re-built at the Kitchener-Waterloo Art Gallery as a walk-in theatre wherein visitors could sit and watch a program of black and white documentary shorts that had been produced by the National Film Board of Canada. 

Seth is the subject of the 2014 documentary film &quot;Seth&#x27;s Dominion&quot;, which received the grand prize for best animated feature at the Ottawa International Animation Film Festival.

==Personal life==
As of 2004, Seth lived in Guelph, Ontario, with his wife Tania Van Spyk, whom he married in 2002.

==Awards==
Seth has won a number of industry awards throughout his career, and in 2011 was honoured by being the first cartoonist to win the literary Harbourfront Festival Prize. In 2020, &quot;Clyde Fans&quot; became the first graphic novel ever to receive a Giller Prize nomination. On June 17, 2022 Seth was awarded the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government.

In 2024, Seth (and &quot;Clyde Fans&quot;) appeared in a stamp series honouring Canadian graphic novelists. He was joined there by Chester Brown (&quot;Louis Riel&quot;) and Michel Rabagliati (&quot;Paul à Québec&quot;).

<doc id="915975" wikidata="Q1191800" url="?curid=915975" title="Para Para Paradise">
<text>is an arcade and PlayStation 2 dance game made by the Japanese company Konami and released under the Bemani moniker following the Para Para fad.

Konami would later release &quot;Dance Evolution&quot; for the Xbox 360, a game that shares many similarities with &quot;Para Para Paradise&quot;.

==Music==
The music used in Para Para Paradise is exclusively fast-paced Eurobeat. The majority of tracks are &quot;true&quot; Para Para tracks from the Avex Trax record label, such as &quot;Velfarre 2000&quot;, &quot;Anniversary&quot; and &quot;Boom Boom Fire&quot;. A portion of the songs are Eurobeat remixes of other Bemani tracks such as &quot;CAN&#x27;T STOP FALLIN&#x27; IN LOVE&quot;. There are also two songs that are J-EURO remixes, remixes of J-pop songs (&quot;Aishiattemasu&quot; and &quot;Deluxe&quot;, both by Key-A-Kiss).

==Korean version==

A Korean version of ParaParaParadise, called ParaParaDancing was also released. The songlist was changed to feature more Korean music, including a song by S.E.S. Songs by Korean artists, H.O.T. &quot;Hold On Me&quot;, sung in Korean, was originally in Japanese. ParaParaDancing also features the ability to play on the reverse side of the stage by setting the machine to sense on the rear 5 out of the total 8 sensors, facing the spectators instead.

==Emulation and simulation==
The developers of MAME have been working on a way to emulate the arcade machine on a computer.

Since then, 14 other FireBeat games have been dumped, although they still remain marked as not working in MAME. The open-source music game &quot;StepMania&quot; also has support for ParaParaParadise, and CVS versions of version 4.0 support the PS2 version&#x27;s controller, although actual simfiles for the game are few.

==Reception==
On release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine scored the PlayStation 2 version of the game a 31 out of 40.

<text>Finland competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Finnish athletes have competed at every Olympic Games since its debut in 1908. The Finnish Olympic Committee (, &quot;SOK&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest ever team to the Games after the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. A total of 53 athletes, 36 men and 17 women, competed only in 12 sports; the nation&#x27;s team size was roughly denser from Sydney by a quarter of the athletes.

The Finnish team featured three returning Olympic medalists from Sydney: Greco-Roman wrestler Marko Yli-Hannuksela, rifle shooter Juha Hirvi, who won a silver in the men&#x27;s rifle three positions, and competed at his fifth Olympic Games, and open skiff sailor and defending Olympic champion Thomas Johanson, who was appointed by the committee to carry the Finnish flag in the opening ceremony. Other notable Finnish athletes included swimmers Hanna-Maria Seppälä and 1996 Olympic silver medalist Jani Sievinen, professional tennis player Jarkko Nieminen, javelin thrower and top medal contender Tero Pitkämäki, and hammer thrower Olli-Pekka Karjalainen.

Finland left Athens with their worst athletic performance, as the Finns failed to pick up a single gold for the first time in the entire Olympic history. Two silver medals were awarded to the Finnish team for skeet shooter Marko Kemppainen, and Greco-Roman wrestler Marko Yli-Hannuksela, who had previously won a bronze from Sydney in the men&#x27;s 74 kg category.

<text>The Simpsons Sing the Blues is the first album released as an offshoot of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. The album contains originally recorded music not featured in the series save for the first verse of the track &quot;Moaning Lisa Blues&quot; which was first featured in the episode &quot;Moaning Lisa&quot;, which aired in the United States on February 11, 1990. The album was released on December 4, 1990, and peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

An early musical number, &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, leads the album as the first track and the first single released. It was an international success, including being the United Kingdom number one single on February 16, 1991, staying there for a further two weeks being certified gold after selling over 400,000 copies. The second single released, &quot;Deep, Deep Trouble&quot; also did well in the UK, reaching number 7. &quot;Do the Bartman&quot; and &quot;Deep, Deep Trouble&quot; were released as music videos in 1990 and 1991.

Different cast members lent their voices to the album with both new material and cover songs. There were a number of notable musicians who appeared on the album, including B.B. King, DJ Jazzy Jeff, Dr. John, and Marcy Levy.

==Background==
David Geffen, founder of Geffen Records, had the idea to record an album based on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, to be released in time for Christmas 1990. According to series creator Matt Groening, &quot;James L. Brooks walked into the office one day and said &#x27;The Simpsons Sing The Blues&#x27;...Then we spent a lot of time deciding what the blues was...&quot;. The writers wrote humorous lyrics for the actors to perform over blues and hip hop. The voice actors for the series recorded the album in September 1990. The album was difficult to produce in between production for the second season of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, which was due to premiere just two weeks later. The album&#x27;s title was penned by producer James L. Brooks. &quot;We plundered a number of different styles for the record&quot;, admitted creator Matt Groening in a 1990 interview. The disc contains an eclectic mix of old blues tunes such as Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;God Bless the Child&quot; and original songs such as &quot;Deep, Deep Trouble&quot;, which was produced by DJ Jazzy Jeff and written by Groening. Noticing how Bart had been embraced by the African-American communities of America, Matt Groening sought to write Bart a hip hop number.

By September 28, 1990, the vocal cast had been recording for around a month, and had completed two rough cuts of songs in between recording for the TV show. At this point, the album was due out in November. Fox had ordered around a dozen camera crews to interview and tape the voice cast, though instead of recording tracks the actors mostly pretended to sing for the cameras.

==Release==
The album faced great publicity before its release, with several details leaking out. Fox attempted to keep the record under wraps until negotiations with performers such as Michael Jackson were nailed down. One particular element that was highly publicized was Jackson&#x27;s involvement, which was denied around the time of the album&#x27;s release. &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s so frustrating,&quot; lamented Groening in a 1990 interview. &quot;I said to a reporter a while ago that I would like to have this happen and it was printed as if it was true.&quot; Early published reports attributed Jackson as the composer of &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, which led to James L. Brooks issuing a press release apologizing for any misunderstanding about who actually wrote the song, instead revealing that Bryan Loren wrote the song. Fox also organized a media event around the album, pulling in nearly a half-dozen camera crews to interview and tape the would-be recording stars in action.

&quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; was released on December 4, 1990, and was a success, peaking at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the highest charting &quot;Simpsons&quot; album. The album was also a success in the United Kingdom, where it peaked at #6 on the albums chart and was eventually certified gold. The lead single from the album, &quot;Do the Bartman&quot;, was released on November 20, 1990, followed by the unveiling of animated music video after the &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart the Daredevil&quot; on December 6. After the Fox network premiere, the video was exclusive to MTV. The song wasn&#x27;t actually released as a physical single in the US, which perhaps helped sales of the album. The music video for &quot;Deep, Deep Trouble&quot; debuted after &quot;Bart&#x27;s Dog Gets an &quot;F&quot; on March 7, 1991.

On December 14, 1990, the album was certified platinum, having sold over 1 million copies in its first week of release. Within a matter of weeks, the record was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, on February 13, 1991, for sales of over 2 million copies.

On July 22, 2013 the album was certified Gold by the British Phonographic Industry in the UK.

==Reception==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; placed the album on their list of worst albums of the year in 1990, stating that &quot;The television series was at least mildly subversive, not to mention funny; the album mangles old songs and takes no chances with bland new ones&quot; People described it as a &quot;slick, supercommercial novelty act&quot;, and that it seemed the producer&#x27;s main goal was money rather than comedy or drama. &quot;Florida Flambeau&quot; expressed relief that the album wasn&#x27;t a Christmas record, although felt that it was &quot;mostly pointless&quot; without being paired with the funny visuals of the show, and wished more songs had been written specifically for the characters. &quot;Thrust&quot; magazine expressed disdain that such a popular album was created by fictional recording artists, noting &quot;Most people have to die before they sell so many records, but The Simpsons will never die. They don&#x27;t exist&quot;. &quot;Commoner&quot; found it as an example of the rampant commercialization of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; in the early 1990s.

&quot;Hatchet&quot; negatively compared it to the 1997 television series soundtrack album &quot;Songs in the Key of Springfield&quot;, noting that the latter is &quot;actually funny&quot;. &quot;Lambda&quot; felt the new album would be a &quot;nice change&quot; from the former, whose single “Do the Bartman” had become tiring.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; is today regarded as a novelty from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;″ early popularity. Shortly after the record&#x27;s release and success, record companies rushed to fashion music stars out of animated characters. In January 1991, Mattel announced plans to record a Barbie rock album titled &quot;The Look&quot;. At the same time, MCA Records was finishing work on based on the Mario Bros. characters. SBK and Geffen also enjoyed huge success with albums based on the film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and &quot;The Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot;. The record soon became the fastest-selling album to emerge from a television show since the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; soundtrack in 1985. Disney also issued of Caribbean songs sung by &quot;The Little Mermaid&#x27;s&quot; Sebastian as well as an album of songs sung by the cast of &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, a series often compared to &quot;The Simpsons&quot; during its run. &quot;Do the Bartman&quot; inspired a dance, &quot;The Bartman&quot;, that was popular in early 1991.

<text>Three Saints Bay (, &quot;Bukhta Tryokh Svyatitelyej&quot;) is a 9-mile (14-kilometer)-long inlet on the southeast side of Kodiak Island, Alaska, north of Sitkalidak Strait. It is southwest of Kodiak. The Three Saints Bay Site is an archaeological site, the location of the first Russian settlement in Alaska, Three Saints Harbor (, &quot;Gavan’ Tryokh Svyatitelyej&quot;). The settlement was founded in 1784 by Grigory Shelikhov. The main settlement was moved in 1792 to &quot;Pavlovskaya Gavan&quot; (Павловская гавань – Paul&#x27;s Harbor), now known as the city of Kodiak. The Three Saints Bay Site was declared a National Historic Landmark by the United States in 1978.

== History ==

Although Russian fur hunters had established temporary shore stations in Alaska earlier, they intended the Three Saints site to be a permanent colonial settlement. The site was poorly chosen, for the hillside above the shore area was too steep to build on, and the shore area was too small for a substantial settlement. When it was visited in 1790, it was described as a cluster of small structures (probably barabaras), with a population of about fifty men and a small number of women. The site was harmed by subsidence and a probable tsunami in the wake of a 1788 earthquake. In 1791, Alexander Baranov began moving the main Russian settlement to the site of present-day Kodiak.

This original Russian site continued to be occupied as a smaller station of lesser importance until roughly the mid-19th century, at which time it was relocated to a site about away.

Only a few remnants of the Russian occupation remain on the surface. These are mainly pits and rectangular depressions, indications of where structures were located, and some plants that are evidence of the small-scale agriculture which was practiced there. The settlement&#x27;s cemetery was located to its southeast. Excavation at the site yielded evidence that it was built on the site of an older native settlement, dating to c. 100 BCE.

The Russian settlement site was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places in 1972, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1978.

== Etymology ==
The bay was named for the harbor, in turn named after one of Shelikhov&#x27;s ships. It was named for the Three Holy Hierarchs. It was reported by Petroff in the 10th Census in 1880.

The same area was later called Lyakhik Bay (&quot;Zaliv Lyakhik&quot;) by Captain Tebenkov. This was based on its Aleut name &quot;Liakik&quot;, probably from &quot;liak&quot; (&quot;black-footed goose&quot;).

<text>An autobiographical comic (also autobio, graphic memoir, or autobiocomic) is an autobiography in the form of comic books or comic strips. The form first became popular in the underground comix movement and has since become more widespread. It is currently most popular in Canadian, American and French comics; all artists listed below are from the U.S. unless otherwise specified.

Autobiographical comics are a form of biographical comics (also known as biocomics).

==1880s==
* Rafael Bordalo Pinheiro (1846–1905) &quot;made an attempt of an autobiographical comics exercise&quot; in his 1881 graphic reportage book &quot;No Lazareto de Lisboa&quot; (&quot;The Lazaretto of Lisbon&quot;), by including himself and personal thoughts. Some of Bordalo Pinheiro&#x27;s panels and strips were also autobiographical, such as self-caricatures of personal anecdotes from his travel in Brazil.

==1910s==
* Fay King (1910s–1930s newspaper cartoonist) drew herself as a character later used as Olive Oyl in autobiographical strips portraying her reportages, opinions, and personal life.
*Hinko Smrekar (1883–1942, Slovenian painter, newspaper cartoonist) drew and wrote a 24-page booklet &quot;&quot; about his experience in the army and army prisons. This self-ironical proto comic has been published in 1919 – two years after he finished it. All of the pages have up to four illustrations, some include typical comic book balloons. The complete text was handwritten.

==1920s==
* Carlos Botelho (1899–1982) had a weekly comic page in a &quot;style that mixed up chronicle, autobiography, journalism, and satire&quot; running from 1928 to 1950 in the Portuguese magazine &quot;Sempre Fixe&quot;.

==1930s==
* Henry (Yoshitaka) Kiyama&#x27;s &quot;The Four Immigrants Manga&quot; (drawn 1924–1927, exhibited 1927 in San Francisco, self-published 1931). These 52 two-page strips drew from the experiences of Kiyama and three friends, mostly as Japanese student immigrants to San Francisco between 1904 and 1907, plus material up to 1924.

==1940s==
* The artist Taro Yashima (born Atsushi Iwamatsu) published his autobiographical graphic works &quot;The New Sun&quot; in 1943 and &quot;The New Horizon&quot; in 1947 (both written in English). The first book describes his early life as well his as his wife Mitsu Yashima&#x27;s imprisonment and brutalization by the Tokkō (special higher police) in response to their antiwar, anti-Imperialist, and anti-militarist stance in the 1930s. The second book describes their post-prison life in Japan under militarist rule up until the time they emigrated to the United States in 1939.
* Miné Okubo published &quot;Citizen 13660&quot;, a collection of 198 drawings and accompanying text chronicling the author&#x27;s experiences in Japanese American internment camps during World War II. Named after the number assigned to her family unit, the book contains almost two hundred of Okubo&#x27;s pen-and-ink sketches accompanied by explanatory text. Published in 1946, the book has been in print for more than 75 years.

==1960s==
=== 1960s in Japan ===
* Shinji Nagashima created &quot;Mangaka Zankoku Monogatari&quot; (&quot;Cruel Tale of a Cartoonist&quot;) in 1961.
* Yoshiharu Tsuge published in 1966 his autobiographical story &quot;Chiko&quot; (&quot;Chiko, the Java sparrow&quot;), depicting his daily life as a struggling manga artist living with a bar hostess making most of their money. Published in the seminal magazine &quot;Garo&quot;, it started the movement of &quot;Watakushi manga&quot; (&quot;I manga&quot;, or &quot;comics about me&quot;). These short graphic nonfictions (including memoirs, chronicles, travel or dream diaries) were also represented by Yu Takita, Tadao Tsuge, and Shinichi Abe (see below).
* Yu Takita (1932–1990) started in 1968 his &quot;Terajima-cho&quot; stories (&quot;Terajima neighborhood mystery tales&quot;). They were series of vignettes about 1930s life in this Tokyo district where his parents ran a tavern.
* Tadao Tsuge started in 1968 his personal stories, later collected in &quot;Trash Market&quot;.
=== USA ===
* Justin Green In 1969, Justin Green published his first autobiographical comic strip in Gothic Blimp Works #3 titled, &quot;When I Was Sixteen &#x27;Twas a Very Bad Year.&quot;

==1970s==
* Justin Green, &quot;Binky Brown Makes Up His Own Puberty Rites&quot; published in Yellow Dog #17, March 1970
* Sam Glanzman started in April 1970 his &quot;U.S.S. Stevens&quot; autobio stories (1970–1977) about his war service, as 4-pagers in DC Comics&#x27;s title &quot;Our Army at War&quot;. Beside memoirs of war actions he witnessed, many are personal vignettes of embarrassing moments, including as an artist. As comics historian John B. Cooke noted, those &quot;autobiographical tales about the sometimes mundane, frequently horrifying experiences aboard a &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class U.S. navy destroyer during World War II were beginning to appear regularly, debuting two years before &quot;Binky Brown&quot;.&quot;
* Shinichi Abe (born 1950) started in 1971 his autobiographical series &quot;Miyoko Asagaya kibun&quot; (&quot;The Miyoko Asagaya feeling&quot; or &quot;Miyoko, Asagaya&#x27;s feeling&quot;) for &quot;Garo&quot; magazine. It chronicled his 1970s bohemian life with his model girlfriend Miyoko in the Asagaya district of Tokyo. (The manga was adapted into the 2009 film &quot;Miyoko&quot;.)
* Justin Green, though not the first author of autobio comics, is generally acknowledged to have pioneered the confessional genre in English-language comics, because of the immediate influence of his &quot;highly personal autobiographical comics&quot; on other creators (Kominski, Crumb, Spiegelman, Pekar, see below). This was done through the veiled autobio of his alter ego&#x27;s &quot;Binky Brown&quot; stories, notably the March 1972 comic book &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, an extremely personal work dealing with Green&#x27;s Catholic and Jewish background and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Binky Brown continued his adventures in &quot;Sacred and Profane&quot; with a story called &quot;Sweet Void of Youth&quot;.
* In October 1972, Japanese manga artist Keiji Nakazawa created the 48-page story &quot;I Saw It&quot; (&quot;Ore wa Mita&quot;), which told of his firsthand experience of the bombing of Hiroshima. (This was followed by the longer, fictionalized work &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; (&quot;Hadashi no Gen&quot;), later adapted into three films.)
* Aline Kominsky followed Green in November 1972 with her veiled autobio 5-pager &quot;Goldie, a Neurotic Woman&quot; (in &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; #1).
* Art Spiegelman followed Green in 1973 with his 4-page &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot; (in &quot;Short Order Comix&quot; #1), about his feelings after the suicide of his Holocaust-survivor mother (a strip later included in &quot;Maus&quot;, see below).
* Robert Crumb and Aline Kominsky released in 1974 &quot;Dirty Laundry Comics&quot; #1, a joint confessional comic book documenting their budding romance, though depicted aboard a fantasy spaceship.
* In 1976, Harvey Pekar began his long-running self-published series &quot;American Splendor&quot;, which collected short stories written by Pekar, usually about his daily life as a file clerk, and illustrated by a variety of artists. The series led to Pekar meeting his wife Joyce Brabner, who later co-wrote their graphic novel &quot;Our Cancer Year&quot; (1994) about his battle with lymphoma.
* In 1977, the Italian magazine &quot;Alter Alter&quot; starts publishing Andrea Pazienza&#x27;s &quot;Le straordinarie avventure di Pentothal&quot; (Pentothal&#x27;s Extraordinary Adventures), in which the author details in a stream of consciousness his own experiences with drugs, arts, politics, counterculture, and the Movement of 1977, through a thinly veiled alter ego.
* In 1978, Eddie Campbell started his autobio strip &quot;In the Days of the Ace Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Club&quot; (March 1978 – March 1979). (This led to his &quot;Alec&quot; stories, see below.)
* In 1979, Malaysian cartoonist Lat published his childhood memoir &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; (drawn 1977–1978).
* In the late 1970s, Jim Valentino began his career with some autobio minicomics, released in the early 1980s. In 1985, he published his autobio series &quot;Valentino&quot; (later collected in &quot;Vignettes&quot;). In 1997, he created the semi-autobio series &quot;A Touch of Silver&quot; about a boy coming of age in the 1960s. In 2007, he revisited autobio with &quot;Drawings from Life&quot; (also collected in &quot;Vignettes&quot;).
* Throughout the 1970s, autobiographical writing was prominent in the work of many female underground cartoonists, in anthologies such as &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot;, ranging from comical anecdotes to feminist commentary based on the artists&#x27; lives.

==1980s==
* In 1980, Art Spiegelman combined biography and autobiography in his Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;Maus&quot; (serialized 1980–1991), about his father&#x27;s Holocaust experiences, his own relationship with his father, and the process of interviewing him for the book. This work had a major effect on the reception of comics in general upon the world of mainstream prose literature, awakening many to the potential of comics as a medium for stories other than adventure fantasy.
* In 1982, Eddie Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Alec&quot; stories started with the Scottish/Australian artist as a young man drifting through life with his friends, and followed him through marriage, parenthood, and a successful artistic career. (They were later collected in &quot;The King Canute Crowd&quot;, &quot;Three Piece Suit&quot;, and other books.)
* Campbell&#x27;s English colleague Glenn Dakin created the &quot;Abraham Rat&quot; stories (collected in &quot;Abe: Wrong for All the Right Reasons&quot;), which began as fantasy and became more contemplative and autobiographical.
* Spain Rodriguez drew a number of stories, collected in &quot;My True Story&quot;, about being a motorcycle gang member in the 1950s.
*In the mid 1980s, Carol Tyler shifted from making paintings to autobiographical comics. Her first published comics piece appeared in &quot;Weirdo&quot; in 1986. 
* Underground legend Robert Crumb focused increasingly on autobiography in his 1980s stories in &quot;Weirdo&quot; magazine. Many other autobiographical shorts would appear in &quot;Weirdo&quot; by other artists, including his wife, Aline Kominsky-Crumb, Carol Tyler, Phoebe Gloeckner (see below in 1990s section), and Dori Seda.
* In 1987, Sam Glanzman released his WWII graphic memoir &quot;A Sailor&#x27;s Story&quot; (Marvel Comics), a more personal extension of his 1970s &quot;U.S.S. Stevens&quot; war stories.
*In 1988, Andrea Pazienza releases &quot;Pompeo&quot;, his last graphic novel, depicting the gradual downfall of a heroin addict (a largely autobiographical character), up to his eventual suicide.
* Jim Woodring&#x27;s unusual &quot;autojournal&quot; &quot;Jim&quot; combined dream art with occasional episodes of realistic autobiography.
* David Collier, a Canadian ex-soldier, published autobiographical and historical comics in &quot;Weirdo&quot; and later in his series &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;.
* In 1987, DC Comics&#x27; anthology &quot;Wasteland&quot; (1987–1989) featured, unusually for a mainstream title, as well as more conventional forms of black comedy and horror, semi-autobiographical stories based on the life of co-writer Del Close. One of the stories also parodied the autobiographical stories of Harvey Pekar, portraying a version of Pekar&#x27;s famous appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, in which Pekar&#x27;s vehement critique of General Electric had earned him a longtime ban from the program.
* In 1989, John Porcellino started in his long-running autobio series &quot;King-Cat Comics&quot; (still ongoing).

==1990s==
Autobiographical work took the English-speaking alternative comics scene by storm during this period, becoming a &quot;signature genre&quot; in much the way that superhero stories dominated American mainstream comic books. (The stereotypical example of an alternative autobiographical comic recounted the awkward moment which followed when, the cartoonist sitting alone in a coffee shop, their ex-girlfriend walks in.) Slice of life comics and comics strips gained popularity during this period as well. However, many artists pursued broader themes.

* Maltese-American Joe Sacco appeared as a character in his journalistic comics, beginning with &quot;Yahoo&quot; (collected in &quot;Notes from a Defeatist&quot;) and &quot;Palestine&quot;.
* In the anthology series &quot;Real Stuff&quot;, Dennis Eichhorn followed Pekar&#x27;s example of writing true stories for others to illustrate, but unlike Pekar, emphasized unlikely tales of sex and violence. Many of the &quot;Real Stuff&quot; stories took place in Eichhorn&#x27;s native state of Idaho. In 1993, Eichhorn received an Eisner Award nomination for Best Writer and his &quot;Real Stuff&quot; series received nominations for both Best Continuing Series and Best Anthology. In 1994, &quot;Real Stuff&quot; again received an Eisner Award nomination for Best Anthology.
* One of the most popular self-published mini-comics of the 1990s in America, &quot;Silly Daddy&quot;, depicted Joe Chiappetta&#x27;s parenthood and divorce, sometimes realistically and sometimes in a parallel fantasy story. The story continued in trade paperbacks and as a webcomic.
*&quot;The Job Thing&quot;, 1993. Carol Tyler details her troubles with low paying jobs. A collection of stories originally published in Street Music Magazine. 
* Julie Doucet&#x27;s series &quot;Dirty Plotte&quot; (1991–1998), from Canada, began as a mix of outlandish fantasy and dream comics, but moved toward autobiography in what was later collected as &quot;My New York Diary&quot;.
* A trio of Canadian friends, Seth &quot;(Palookaville)&quot;, Chester Brown &quot;(Yummy Fur, The Playboy, I Never Liked You)&quot;, and Joe Matt (&quot;Peepshow&quot;), gained rapid renown in North America for their different approaches to autobiography. Brown and Matt were also notorious for depicting embarrassing personal moments such as masturbation and nose picking. Seth created some controversy by presenting realistic fictional stories as if they had actually happened, not as a ploy to fool writers but as a literary technique. However some readers did get fooled.
* Keith Knight&#x27;s weekly comic strip &quot;The K Chronicles&quot; began in the early 1990s, exploring themes relevant to Knight&#x27;s racial heritage, as well as current events, both personal to Knight and general to the world.
* Howard Cruse&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;Stuck Rubber Baby&quot; (1995) told a fictionalized version of Cruse&#x27;s young adulthood as a gay man in the South during civil rights conflicts.
* Phoebe Gloeckner created a series of semi-autobiographical stories drawing on her adolescent experiences with sex and drugs in San Francisco, collected in &quot;A Child&#x27;s Life and Other Stories&quot;. She later revisited similar material in her 2004 illustrated novel &quot;The Diary of a Teenage Girl: An Account in Words and Pictures&quot;.
* &quot;Seven Miles a Second&quot;, written by painter David Wojnarowicz and illustrated by James Romberger and Marguerite Van Cook, was based on Wojnarowicz&#x27;s life and his response to the AIDS epidemic.
* The graphic novel &quot;David Chelsea in Love&quot; described the eponymous author&#x27;s romantic difficulties in New York City and Portland.
* Rick Veitch told the story of his twenties entirely through a dream diary in the &quot;Crypto Zoo&quot; volume of &quot;Rare Bit Fiends&quot;.
* Ariel Schrag&#x27;s tetralogy &quot;Awkward&quot;, &quot;Definition&quot;, &quot;Potential&quot;, and &quot;Likewise&quot;, about discovering her sexual identity in high school, was unusual in having been mostly completed &quot;while&quot; in high school.
* Jim Valentino&#x27;s &quot;A Touch of Silver&quot; (Image Comics, 1997) portrayed his unhappy youth in the 1960s.
* English artist Raymond Briggs, best known for his children&#x27;s books, told the story of his parents&#x27; marriage in &quot;Ethel &amp; Ernest&quot; (1998).
* James Kochalka started to turn his daily life into a daily four-panel strip starting in 1998, collected in &quot;Sketchbook Diaries&quot;, and later in the webcomic &quot;American Elf&quot;.
* Swedish cartoonist Martin Kellerman launched the autobiographical comic strip &quot;Rocky&quot; in 1998, focusing on an anthropomorphic dog and his friends in their everyday life in Stockholm. &quot;Rocky&quot; is based on Kellerman&#x27;s own life. The comic has since been translated into Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Serbian, English, Spanish, and French, either as a running strip or collected in book form.
* &quot;Bread and Wine: An Erotic Tale of New York&quot; (1999), written by Samuel R. Delaney and illustrated by Mia Wolff, is an autobiographical graphic novel about a gay science-fiction writer (Delaney) meeting a homeless man who becomes his partner.
* Brian Michael Bendis&#x27; three-issue American comic book limited series &quot;Fortune and Glory&quot; (Oni Press, 1999–2000) is the story of the author&#x27;s attempts to break into Hollywood by writing screenplays for his hardboiled comics (such as &quot;Jinx&quot;, &quot;A.K.A. Goldfish&quot;, and &quot;Torso&quot;). The series was nominated for Eisner Awards in three categories.

===1990s in France===
This period also saw a rapid expansion of the French small-press comics scene, including a new emphasis on autobiographical work:

* Fabrice Neaud&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;Journal&quot; was the first lengthy autobiographical series in French comics.
* David B., another artist who had first published fantasy comics stories, produced the graphic novel &quot;L&#x27;ascension du haut mal&quot; (published in English as &quot;Epileptic&quot;) applied B.&#x27;s distinctive non-realistic style to the story of his equally unusual upbringing, in which his family moved to a macrobiotic commune and sought many other cure&#x27;s for B.&#x27;s brother&#x27;s &quot; grand mal&quot; seizures.
* Lewis Trondheim portrayed himself and his friends, albeit with animal heads, in &quot;Approximative continuum comics&quot;, some of which was later published in English as &quot;The Nimrod&quot;.
* Much of Edmond Baudoin&#x27;s later work is based on his personal and family history.
* Dupuy and Berberain&#x27;s &quot;Journal d&#x27;un album&quot; and Jean-Christophe Menu&#x27;s &quot;Livre de Phamille&quot; also had a significant influence on the French autobiographic graphic novel scene.

* Lynda Barry&#x27;s &quot;One! Hundred! Demons!&quot; (2002) features Barry wrestling with the &quot;demons&quot; of regret, abusive relationships, self-consciousness, the prohibition against feeling hate, and her response to the results of the 2000 United States presidential election.

<text>L&#x27;Ascension du Haut Mal (&quot;The Ascension of Great Suffering&quot;), published in English as Epileptic, is an autobiographical graphic novel by David Beauchard (more commonly known as David B.).

==Publication history==
It was originally published in French by L&#x27;Association in six volumes from 1996 to 2003:

* &quot;Tome 1&quot;, 1996, 52 pp. ()
* &quot;Tome 2&quot;, 1997, 60 pp. ()
* &quot;Tome 3&quot;, 1998, 52 pp. ()
* &quot;Tome 4&quot;, 1999, 52 pp. () 
* &quot;Tome 5&quot;, 2000, 60 pp. ()
* &quot;Tome 6&quot;, 2003, 86 pp. ()

The first half of the series was published in English by Fantagraphics in one volume in 2002 (); a complete edition was released by Pantheon in 2005 ().

==Plot==
The book tells the story of the author&#x27;s early childhood and adolescence, focusing on his relationship with his older brother and younger sister. His brother develops severe and intractable epilepsy, causing the family to seek a variety of solutions from alternative medicine, most dramatically by moving to a commune based on macrobiotic principles. As the epileptic brother loses control of his own life, the artist develops solitary obsessions with cartoons, mythology and war. The book&#x27;s graphic style becomes increasingly elaborate as the children&#x27;s fantasy life takes over, with their dreams and fears (including epilepsy itself) appearing as living creatures. In brief interludes, the children appear as adults when the artist begins the process of writing the story.

==Translation==
The French title proved difficult to translate, as it contains several meanings: &quot;haut mal&quot; is an archaic term for epilepsy meaning literally &quot;great sickness&quot; (formerly used as a medical term in English, now replaced by &quot;grand mal&quot;), and &quot;ascension&quot; can mean either rise or climbing, as seen in a recurring image of the family climbing a steep slope into unknown terrain.

==Reception==
The English translation of the book received very good reviews from critics. The review aggregator Metacritic reported the book had an average score of 92 out of 100, based on 15 reviews. In &quot;Bookmarks&quot; May/June 2005 issue, a magazine that aggregates critic reviews of books, the book received a (4.5 out of 5) with the summary stating, &quot;&quot;Epileptic&quot;, noted the Houston Chronicle, &quot;is a different beast, bigger, broader and better than any graphic entry in recent memory&quot;. The original French version was also generally well-received.

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; has called it &quot;one of the greatest graphic novels ever published.&quot;

==Awards==
The fourth volume won the 2000 Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario. David B. won the 2005 Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist for his work on the series.

<text>The Allais effect is the alleged anomalous behavior of pendulums or gravimeters which is sometimes purportedly observed during a solar eclipse. The effect was first reported as an anomalous precession of the plane of oscillation of a Foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of June 30, 1954 by Maurice Allais, a French polymath who later won the Nobel Prize in Economics. Allais reported another observation of the effect during the solar eclipse of October 2, 1959 using the paraconical pendulum he invented. This study earned him the 1959 Galabert Prize of the French Astronautical Society and made him a laureate of the U.S. Gravity Research Foundation for his 1959 memoir on gravity. The veracity of the Allais effect remains controversial among the scientific community, as its testing has frequently met with inconsistent or ambiguous results over more than five decades of observation.

== Experimental observations ==

Maurice Allais emphasized the &quot;dynamic character&quot; of the effects he observed:
Besides Allais&#x27;s own experiments, related research about a possible effect of the Moon&#x27;s shielding, absorption or bending of the Sun&#x27;s gravitational field during a solar eclipse have been conducted by scientists around the world. Some observations have yielded positive results, seemingly confirming that minute but detectable variations in the expected behavior of devices dependent on gravity do indeed occur within the umbra of an eclipse, but others have failed to detect any noticeable effect.

=== Anomalous results ===

Romanian physicist Gheorghe Jeverdan &quot;et al.&quot; observed the Allais effect and the so-called &quot;Jeverdan-Rusu-Antonescu effect&quot; or &quot;Jeverdan effect&quot; (i.e. the change in the oscillation period of a pendulum during an eclipse) while monitoring a Foucault pendulum during the solar eclipse of February 15, 1961. The authors made two hypotheses regarding their observation: during an eclipse, the Moon exerts a screening effect on the gravitational attraction of the Sun so that the attraction of the Earth is indirectly increased, a phenomenon that could also be studied with tides. If the hypothesis of the screening effect is wrong, another explanation could be that the variation of the Earth&#x27;s gravity might be considered as a result of the diffraction of gravitational waves. Erwin Saxl and Mildred Allen similarly reported strong anomalous changes in the period of a torsion pendulum during the solar eclipse of March 7, 1970 and concluded that &quot;gravitational theory needs to be modified&quot;.

Dr. Leonid Savrov of the Sternberg Astronomical Institute built a dedicated paraconical pendulum to test the Allais effect during the solar eclipse of July 11, 1991 in Mexico and the eclipse of November 3, 1994 in Brazil. While he could not observe Allais&#x27;s claim that there is a diurnal periodicity in the motion of a paraconical pendulum, he did, however, write: &quot;The most interesting result of the Mexico and Brazil experiments is the increase of rotational velocity of the pendulum oscillation plane in the direction of the Foucault effect during the eclipse. It seems that we have some kind of special effect.&quot;

Various other experiments using atomic clocks and gravimeters instead of pendulums also recorded significant anomalous gravitational effects which can neither be caused by a tidal effect or drift of the gravimeters, nor by high-frequency noise which has special patterns. These experiments were set up by different teams during solar eclipses in China in 1992, India in 1995, and China in 1997.

Results reporting the observation of the Allais and Jeverdan-Rusu-Antonescu effects during the annular solar eclipse of September 22, 2006 were presented the following year by a Romanian team, with a quantization of the behavior of the paraconical pendulum. During the solar eclipse of August 1, 2008, a Ukrainian team and two Romanian teams worked together hundreds of kilometers apart with different apparatuses: five independent miniature torsion balances for the Ukrainian team, two independent short ball-borne pendulums for a Romanian team and a long Foucault pendulum for the third team. All three teams detected unexplained and mutually correlated disturbances. The same teams repeated a dual experiment during the annular solar eclipse of January 26, 2009, this time outside of the umbra, with the same significant correlation between the behavior of light torsion balances and a Foucault pendulum. They also registered similar anomalies using a Foucault pendulum and a very light torsion balance, both located underground in a disused salt mine with minimal interference, during the partial solar eclipse of June 1, 2011.

=== Inconclusive or negative results ===

Louis B. Slichter, using a gravimeter during the solar eclipse of February 15, 1961 in Florence, Italy, failed to detect an associated gravitational signal.

During the solar eclipse of July 22, 1990, no anomalous period increase of a torsion pendulum was detected independently by a team in Finland and another team in Belomorsk, USSR.

The total solar eclipse of August 11, 1999 had been a good opportunity to solve a 45-year mystery, thanks to an international collaboration. NASA&#x27;s Marshall Space Flight Center first inquired about experimental protocols to Maurice Allais, in order to coordinate ahead of the event a worldwide effort to test the Allais effect between observatories and universities over seven countries (United States, Austria, Germany, Italy, Australia, England and four sites in the United Arab Emirates). The lead supervisor then stated: &quot;The initial interpretation of the record points to three possibilities: a systematic error, a local effect, or the unexplored. To eliminate the first two possibilities, we and several other observers will use different kinds of measuring instruments in a distributed global network of observing stations.&quot; However, after the eclipse, Allais criticized the experiments in his final NASA report, writing the period of observation was &quot;much too short […] to detect anomalies properly&quot;. Moreover, the lead supervisor left NASA shortly thereafter with the gathered data and the NASA study has never been published.

Further observations conducted by the team led by Xin-She Yang appear to have yielded much weaker evidence of anomalies than their first 1997 study. The authors first posited a more conventional explanation based on temperature changes causing ground tilting, but later suggested that this explanation was unlikely. A possible yet controversial explanation was finally proposed by the same author and Tom Van Flandern which conjectured that the anomaly is due to the gravitational effect of an increased air density spot in the upper atmosphere created by cooling winds during the solar eclipse. They conclude there have been &quot;no unambiguous detections [of an Allais effect] within the past 30 years when consciousness of the importance of [experimental] controls was more widespread.&quot; They point out that &quot;the gravitation anomaly discussed here is about a factor of 100,000 too small to explain the Allais excess pendulum precession […] during eclipses&quot; and from this conclude that the original Allais anomaly was merely due to poor controls.

Eight gravimeters and two pendulums were deployed across six monitoring sites in China for the solar eclipse of July 22, 2009. Although one of the scientists involved described in an interview having observed the Allais effect, no result has been published in any academic journal. An automated Foucault pendulum was also used during the solar eclipse of July 11, 2010 in Argentina, with no evidence of a precession change of the pendulum&#x27;s oscillation plane (&lt; 0.3 degree per hour).

== Aether hypothesis ==
Maurice Allais states that the eclipse effect is related to a gravitational anomaly that is inexplicable in the framework of the currently admitted theory of gravitation, without giving any explanation of his own. Allais&#x27;s explanation for another anomaly (the lunisolar periodicity in variations of the azimuth of a pendulum) is that space evinces certain anisotropic characteristics, which he ascribes to motion through an aether which is partially entrained by planetary bodies.

His hypothesis leads to a speed of light dependent on the moving direction with respect to a terrestrial observer, since the Earth moves within the aether but the rotation of the Moon induces a &quot;wind&quot; of about 8 km/s. Thus Allais rejects Einstein&#x27;s interpretation of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the subsequent verification experiments of Dayton Miller.

In particular, the Michelson–Morley experiment did not give a zero speed difference, but at most 8 km/s, without being able to detect any regularity. This difference was therefore interpreted as due to measurement uncertainties. Similarly, Miller&#x27;s experiments corroborated these results over a long period of time, but Miller could not explain the source of the irregularities. At the time, temperature problems were invoked to explain the cause, as concluded by Robert S. Shankland. By re-analyzing the data from this experiment, Allais reported a periodicity using sidereal time rather than civil time used by Miller (daytime sidereal variation of the speed of light over a period of 23 hours 56 minutes with an amplitude of about 8 km/s).

Applying the Titius–Bode law to the Earth–Moon system, which he generalizes to aether, Allais calculates a &quot;wind&quot; of 7.95 km/s, which is comparable to the values found by the experiments of Michelson and Miller. Hence Allais deduces that the aether turns with the stars, as proposed by the aether drag hypothesis, and is not fixed as Hendrik Lorentz thought when inventing his famous transformation and his ether theory. But the majority of scientists at the end of the 19th century imagined that such an aether crossed the Earth so that the rotation of the Earth around the Sun would cause an important variation of 30 km/s. Consequently, since the third postulate on which special relativity is based is the constancy of the speed of light in vacuum, Allais considers it unfounded. In order to measure a change in the speed of light, one would have to get back to the definition of the 1960 meter, since confidence in the theory of relativity nowadays is such that current metrology uses constancy of the speed of light as an axiom.

Allais summarized his experimental work in English in his 1999 memoir on behalf of NASA. He detailed his aether hypothesis in the books &quot;L&#x27;Anisotropie de l&#x27;Espace&quot;, published in 1997, and &quot;L&#x27;Effondrement de la Théorie de la Relativité&quot;, published in 2004. A book on Allais&#x27;s scientific legacy has been edited in English in 2011, yet his aether hypothesis has not gained significant traction among mainstream scientists. Nevertheless, after Allais&#x27;s death in 2010, experiments on the Allais effect continue.

<text>Market Forces is a science fiction thriller novel by British writer Richard Morgan. Set in 2049, the story follows Chris Faulkner as he starts his new job as a junior executive at Shorn Associates, working in their Conflict Investment division where the company supports foreign governments in exchange for a percentage of the country&#x27;s gross domestic product. Contracts are awarded, and promotions are given to employees, through driving duels in which combatants race vehicles on empty roads and often kill their opponents. With the Shorn-supported Colombian dictator Echevarria expected to transfer power to his son, who is supported by a competing firm, Chris allies Shorn with a rebel group to overthrow the government, though other executives attempt to sabotage his plans.

First published in 2004 by Victor Gollancz Ltd, the book is Morgan&#x27;s third novel, the first two being part of the Takeshi Kovacs series. &quot;Market Forces&quot; satirises corporate practices and globalisation and carries the theme of competition throughout the story. Violence is used as a metaphor for the mechanisms underlying capitalism and assumptions about haves and have-nots are challenged. It won the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and was nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award. Though book reviewers gave it a mixed reception, Morgan&#x27;s descriptive writing and action sequences received praise.

==Background==
&quot;Market Forces&quot; was science fiction author Richard K. Morgan&#x27;s third novel. His first two novels, &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Broken Angels&quot; (2003), were the first two parts of a trilogy later completed with &quot;Woken Furies&quot; (2005). That Takeshi Kovacs trilogy, hardboiled detective fiction set in the 25th century, gave Morgan a reputation for writing excellent action sequences along with a Philip K. Dick Award. Before the third part of the trilogy was published, Morgan worked on his idea for &quot;Market Forces&quot;, which he conceived of as a short story, then developed as a film script, then as a novel. At the time, Morgan was 38 years old living in Glasgow, Scotland. He has sold the filming rights to &quot;Altered Carbon&quot; to Warner Bros. (he would also sell the rights to &quot;Market Forces&quot; to Warner Bros.) allowing him to leave his job as an English teacher at the University of Strathclyde to focus on his writing career.

==Plot==
In 2049, Chris Faulkner is recruited by Shorn Associates, an investment firm in London. There he befriends
Mike Bryant, a fellow junior executive in the &quot;Conflict Investment&quot; division. Conflict Investment provides resources to incumbent or rebel factions in exchange for promised share of the nation&#x27;s gross domestic product. CI members often toast to continued &quot;small wars&quot; as their primary source of income for themselves and their investors.

Executive advancement in 2049 is not based on merit or politics alone, rather executives can issue challenges to each other which are held on highways emptied of cars and usually fought to the death, in a fashion similar to &quot;Mad Max&quot;, a source cited as inspiration by the author in the acknowledgements of the book. Chris Faulkner gains recognition and small celebrity for a particularly brutal win over a much older and more seasoned member of his firm, from which he is head-hunted by Shorn to join their team. Within the media landscape, business executives have fame on the order of sports stars or movie actors and their driving duels are analysed and covered as sporting events. Chris&#x27; wife Carla is also his mechanic, a vital role where an executive&#x27;s car is the difference between promotion and death. She is not a fan of the way he makes his living, but they have an initially strong relationship.

During a night out in one of the Zones – the cordoned off zone of decaying ghettos surrounding the City of London – Mike introduces Chris to journalist Liz Linshaw, who is also Mike&#x27;s former mistress. Before they leave the Zones, Mike brutally executes several gang members who attempt to steal his car. Back at work, Mike brings Chris in to use contacts and analysis from his prior firm to assist into a project regarding propping up the ageing Colombian dictator General Hernan Echevarria. With Shorn&#x27;s contract due for renewal they are challenged by competing agencies Nakamura and Acropolitic. The challenge is settled by a driving duel in which the Shorn team eliminates the two competing teams. Chris&#x27; profile is greatly increased with this victory, including appearances on TV and magazines as the latest star from a line of Shorn executives. As Chris becomes famous for his driving performance, he begins an affair with Liz Linshaw. With Echevarria&#x27;s son, Francisco, who is aligned with a competing American firm, preparing to take over, Chris believes that a long-time rebel leader might be a better option than Francisco. Vincente Barranco, the rebel leader chosen by Chris, is signed to a contract with Shorn and brought to London to shop for arms to bring his small force the resources they need to overthrow Hernan before Francisco takes over. However, other Shorn executives sabotage Chris&#x27;s efforts by arranging for Barranco to overhear a Shorn executive negotiate with the Echevarrias. When challenged by Barranco that he is not truly committed to his cause, Chris reacts by spontaneously beating Hernan to death in a conference room. Shorn concocts a coverup and pins Hernan&#x27;s death on an otherwise unknown terrorist group. The killing is also concealed from most of Shorn&#x27;s employees, but the senior partner of CI agrees that while a completely unorthodox act, it&#x27;s the sort of rule bending which is sometimes needed to return the maximum for their clients. While his actions convince Barranco that he is in fact committed to his side, Chris is removed from the Colombia job which is handed over to a senior partner, Hamilton, who takes a more pragmatic view and moves to align with Hernan&#x27;s son.

As it is clear that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes increasingly uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN&#x27;s mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN&#x27;s authority and run roughshod over them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris&#x27; conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.

As the conflict in Colombia tilts in favour of the son, Hamilton goes outside of the normal chain of command to plan the execution of Barranco and the elimination of the local Shorn representative in a gladiatorial duel. Faulkner finds out about this and barges into a video conference Hamilton is having with Francisco, telling him that he in fact killed his father with his bare hands. He then beats Hamilton and breaks his neck. He is duly captured and placed in a Corporation operated jail. In jail, Chris is offered a choice: be convicted of murder and have his organs harvested after being subject to capital punishment or participate in face-saving (for Shorn) farce by saying he had legally issued a challenge to Hamilton for his position in the firm. Conditions of this agreement are steep however as he must drive against Mike Bryant, who he had grown to be truly close with, but who is now completely done with him with revelation of Chris&#x27; affair with Liz Linshaw and Chris&#x27; brutal killings outside of the bounds of the challenge process. The night prior to the challenge, the UN representative returns with the chance for Chris to escape and reunite with his estranged wife, who has left the country. He declines. Mike is the superior driver but using a creative interpretation of challenge rules, Chris forces Mike to drive off a bridge and into the Zones. Chris finds the badly injured Mike and kills him just before a gang, who had watched the duel on television, finds them. The gang beats Chris but he survives when the gang is gunned down by Driver Control authorities, the sanctioning body for duels. The story ends with Chris, as the new senior executive, giving the new dictator Francisco Echevarria 48 hours to flee his country in favour of installing Barranco.

==Style and themes==
&quot;Market Forces&quot; is a science fiction thriller set nearly fifty years after its writing featuring a protagonist who fights lethal battles to win contracts for his company and to retain his position within the company. While the story is fictional, the author included a bibliography section that informed the story&#x27;s satire of globalisation and modern corporate practices. Morgan extrapolates trends in free market capitalism out fifty years to a point where corporations are unfettered by domestic governments. It is a dystopian vision where large corporations constantly battle to rule entire countries using humans as pawns. The protagonist, Chris Faulkner, can be viewed as a personification of the story&#x27;s take on the development of its economic system; the character is written to be likeable but becomes increasing brutal as he invests himself deeper into the corporate culture.

The review in &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the corporate culture and market mechanisms that led to the Enron scandal with the fictional background of the novel. The same reviewer compared &quot;Market Forces&quot; to Robert Stone&#x27;s &quot;A Flag for Sunrise&quot; which also concerns political and social issues but in a fictional Central American country. The story&#x27;s use of social commentary is similar to the works of science fiction authors Frederik Pohl and Cyril M. Kornbluth in the 1950s. Book reviewer Nisi Shawl wrote that this story could be part of a subgenre of stories using life-in-a-corporation as a background, along with Eileen Gunn&#x27;s &quot;Stable Strategies for Middle Management&quot;, Kelley Eskridge&#x27;s &quot;Solitaire&quot;, and Charles Stross&#x27; &quot;Accelerando&quot;. Morgan&#x27;s use of action sequences and car chases led to several comparisons to similar movie sequences, and specifically to Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay movies.

===Competition===
The physical violence in the story is a metaphor for the mechanisms behind capitalism. Morgan uses competition as theme throughout novel, punctuated by the &quot;portrayal of a society governed by extreme violence, ruthlessness and with no account for law, morals or humanity&quot;. Violent competition, where the losers die, is the norm and comes in the form of businesses competing for contracts, employees competing for promotions, foreign governments fighting insurgents, and other stand-offs between characters. Non-violent competition is viewed as a novelty or ineffective, like playing chess or publishing opinion essays. The existence of winners and losers and the duality of &quot;haves and the have-nots&quot; are contrasted. By illustrating how the First World exploits the Third World and the corporate executive&#x27;s use of the ghetto areas, the novel challenges the idea that the have-nots are there by choice or that they competed and lost.

==Publication and reception==
&quot;Market Forces&quot; was published by Gollancz in United Kingdom and Del Rey Books in North America. The hardcover was released simultaneously in 2004 along with the ebook and audiobook versions. The audiobook, read unabridged by Simon Vance was published by Tantor Media in CD and mp3 formats. A tradepaperback version was released by the same publishers in 2007. The book was awarded the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 2005 and nominated for the Arthur C. Clarke Award for best science fiction novel first published in the United Kingdom.

Numerous reviewers commented on the action sequences and violence with several noting they were better suited to a theatrical version rather than literature. While reviewers variously called it a &quot;high-octane, stomach-churning terror ride&quot; and &quot;turbo-injected with moral ambiguity&quot;, others noted that the action eventually grows tiresome. Reviewers also noted that the &quot;action sequences [are used to] keep the critique from becoming preachy&quot; or otherwise too serious. In &quot;The San Diego Union-Tribune&quot;, the reviewer wrote &quot;As a motorhead, I liked a lot of elements in this novel. On the other hand, I found a lot of the corporate and corp-rat behavior ranged from disturbing to disgusting.&quot; The reviewer in &quot;The Mercury&quot; concluded, &quot;This is not comfortable or enjoyable bedtime reading. The inventive language, punk dialogue and feverish action create sustained tension throughout...It&#x27;s hell-on-wheels fiction—entertainment that will appeal to many, particularly those who are hot car enthusiasts.&quot;

Numerous reviewers commented on Morgan&#x27;s writing and story. In &quot;The Seattle Times&quot;, journalist and science fiction author Nisi Shawl tied the writing quality to the action scenes, &quot;Morgan&#x27;s talent for tension-building is matched by the clarity with which he describes the sideswiping, rubber-burning, rear-end-ramming, full-contact racing scenes. And both these skills are quietly eclipsed by his word-for-word writing ability. Apt metaphors and similes abound.&quot; However, science fiction critic Robert K. J. Killheffer, in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, wrote &quot;it&#x27;s not his best – it lacks the dense and evocative background of his Takeshi Kovacs books, and Morgan is not as sure-handed with near-future situations and characters – but it takes chances and largely succeeds.&quot; Likewise, in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; the reviewer wrote &quot;In its present form, the novel feels bloated and obvious, despite the sharpness of the descriptive writing and a couple of first-rate fight sequences. With the right artist, &quot;Market Forces&quot; might still make a compelling—and necessarily shorter—graphic novel.&quot; The &quot;Library Journal&quot; review ended with a recommendation: &quot;Morgan&#x27;s sf suspense belongs in most sf collections.&quot; The reviewer in &quot;Booklist&quot; concluded &quot;It&#x27;s not a particularly pleasant future, but Morgan paints it in broad strokes, drawing us into his future world and making it feel like a natural outgrowth of today&#x27;s corporate chicanery. The novel might have been unremittingly bleak if it weren&#x27;t for the moral center provided by Faulkner, who is a genuinely likable guy. Fans of Morgan&#x27;s gritty, noirish brand of sf will flock to this one.&quot;

<doc id="916009" wikidata="Q2252882" url="?curid=916009" title="Lord Soth">
<text>Lord Soth, the Knight of the Black Rose, is a fictional character appearing in the fantasy realms of &quot;Dragonlance&quot; and later &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. He is depicted as a death knight and fallen Knight of Solamnia from the world of Krynn.

==Development==
According to Tracy Hickman, he needed a powerful character for the Heroes of the Lance to fight at the High Clerist&#x27;s Tower, and Lord Soth suddenly came into his mind with a complete history and personality. The popularity of Lord Soth as a character has defined what a death knight means to the writers of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game over the years. Soth was also named as one of the greatest villains in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; history in the final print issue of &quot;Dragon&quot;.

===Debate===
Soth&#x27;s tenure in Ravenloft is a topic of debate. After Soth died in &quot;World of Krynn&quot; (1988), the character &quot;then made the jump to &quot;&quot;, and was quickly lined up as the star of the second &quot;Ravenloft&quot; novel. The original writer for the novel fell through. Tracy Hickman was offered a shot at the novel and declined because he and TSR were on the outs at the time. Other authors wrote proposals, but they all suggested significant changes to Soth&#x27;s character, which &quot;Ravenloft&quot; fiction line editor Jim Lowder refused, because he wanted to be able to hand Soth back to Krynn intact when Ravenloft was done with him. In the end, James Lowder himself was commissioned to write &quot;Knight of the Black Rose&quot; (1991), which more fully introduced Soth to the demiplane of Ravenloft&quot;. In this book, the Mists of Ravenloft plucked Soth and Caradoc from Krynn while the two battled and eventually Soth was given the domain Sithicus.

By Soth&#x27;s third appearance in Ravenloft, in the adventure &quot;When Black Roses Bloom&quot; (1995), the character had become &quot;a bit of a political hot potato. Tracy Hickman and Margaret Weis had returned to the company to write new &quot;Dragonlance&quot; novels, and they were unhappy with Soth&#x27;s use in &quot;Ravenloft&quot;. Reports say that as far as they were concerned, Soth had never gone to Ravenloft, and he even appeared in a cameo in &quot;Dragons of Summer Flame&quot; (1995) … which just confused the matter — though Wizards of the Coast has made it clear that Soth&#x27;s sojourn to &quot;Ravenloft&quot; is a canon part of D&amp;D lore&quot;. Soth had one more Ravenloft focused novel, &quot;Spectre of the Black Rose&quot; (1999) by Lowder and Voronica Whitney-Robinson, which returned Soth to the Dragonlance setting as the Hickmans wanted.

Wizards of the Coast has been vague on the subject but the last official word was that Soth did indeed enter Ravenloft but that the Mists returned him to Krynn at the very instant he was removed. While Lowder had additional unpublished fiction about Soth and the domain of Sithicus, a short story and a third novel, Wizards of the Coast cancelled the &quot;Ravenloft&quot; fiction line. Lowder then pitched it to White Wolf in the 3rd Edition era (2001-2005), however, that didn&#x27;t pan out. Soth was killed off by the Hickmans in the novel &quot;Dragons of a Vanished Moon&quot; (2002).

It is also mentioned in an article in &quot;Dragon&quot; #351 that the new dark lord of Sithicus is plagued by a mockery of Lord Soth. This &quot;White Knight&quot; version of Soth shows how anyone can be redeemed and is an anathema to that Dark Lord&#x27;s corrupting influence on the land.

Wes Schneider, lead designer &quot;Van Richten&#x27;s Guide to Ravenloft&quot; (2021), confirmed that Soth is not included in the 5th Edition sourcebook to respect the canon history of the character. However, the sourcebook contains &quot;several references and some easter eggs&quot; to the character.

== Fictional attributes ==
Soth stands 6&#x27;5&quot; or taller, wearing a full suit of Solamnic plate mail of ancient design. Damage from many battles mars the delicate ornamentation on his armor, obscuring its intricate carvings of kingfishers and roses, leaving only a charred black rose on the breastplate, which became Soth&#x27;s symbol. A long purple cloak hangs heavily on his shoulders, draped behind him almost to his knees. A tassel of long black hair tops his helm, as worn and ancient as the rest of his armor. A sword black with the blood of countless victims hangs sheathed on his hip. Of the death knight himself, only two flaming dots red as blood shine from the eye slits on the helm. His voice seems an echo from the depth of a bottomless cavern. Like all death knights, there is always an aura of freezing unearthly cold around Soth, the demeanor so terrifying that even kender have been known to be frightened.

Under his armor, he is a corpse of some sort, with very dark gray to almost black skin, when he pulls off one of his gauntlets, and also when he was able to take off his helmet and drink the water from the lake of Sounds, in the novel &quot;Spectre of the Black Rose&quot;.

When traveling, Soth is usually mounted on a nightmare, a demonic steed with ebony skin and flaming hooves.

===Combat===
Although evil and filled with an intense hatred for all living creatures, most of the time Soth retains a semblance of the pride he held as a Solamnic knight, and fights honorably. He will never ambush an opponent from behind, nor does he strike before his enemy can ready his weapon. Aside from these facts, however, Soth is a terrible enemy. An undead abomination, Soth has inhuman strength, which is further enhanced by his skill with the sword; something that he learned as a former Knight of the Rose. Soth also can cast various type of spells, including huge fireballs, magical words which stun or kill enemies, ice walls, cone of cold, etc. With a single word, Soth can snuff the life out of a red dragon (thus &quot;Power Word: Kill&quot;), or shatter the great city gate of Palanthas, which was formerly known as the &quot;Unconquered City&quot;.

== Fictional character biography ==

===Life as a knight===
Soth was a Knight of the Rose, the most esteemed rank of knight in the Knights of Solamnia, and married. While on a trip he encountered a band of ogres attacking elven priestesses; Soth fell in love with the fairest priestess, the Silvanesti Elf Isolde Denissa, and eventually managed to seduce her, bringing her back to Dargaard Keep as a friend in the eyes of both the public and his wife. Soth&#x27;s wife Korrine and her lady-in-waiting then visited a witch to help her conceive a child; the witch agreed, but warned that the child would be a representation of Soth&#x27;s soul. Korrine eventually gave birth to an abomination, and Soth, thinking his wife consorted with some kind of demon, killed her and their child. Korrine&#x27;s lady-in-waiting revealed to Soth&#x27;s superior that Isolde was pregnant with his bastard child and he was brought before the Court of High Justice at Palanthas. Soth&#x27;s lie about his wife and child passing in childbirth was corroborated by Istvan the healer, who was later compelled by the court to tell the truth about Soth&#x27;s crime. Before he could be executed, Soth escaped back to Dargaard Keep.

===Undead curse===
Besieged by the other knights, Soth&#x27;s mood turned black, and he even struck his new wife, Isolde, on one occasion. When he realized what he had become, he prayed to Paladine and his wife prayed to Mishakal. Mishakal showed her the future and the destruction that the arrogant Kingpriest of Istar was about to call upon Krynn. She was told that Soth could stop the Cataclysm, but he would die in the attempt. Isolde told Soth about her vision and he set out to redeem himself. On the way to Istar he encountered a group of three elf-maids. They poisoned Soth&#x27;s mind with lies about his wife&#x27;s infidelity. Enraged, Soth turned from his quest and confronted his wife just as the Cataclysm began. A chandelier fell upon his wife and newborn son, setting her aflame. His wife begged for him to save their child, but Soth stopped himself from doing so, to prevent his own son from growing up as he had. As her life ended she cursed him, saying &quot;you shall live the lifetime of every soul that you have caused death today&quot;, and upon pronunciation of the curse the fire engulfed the entire keep, seemingly slaying Soth, his retainers, and the rest of the keep&#x27;s inhabitants. Soth became a death knight and his followers became skeleton warriors. The three elf-maids became banshees, cursed to remind him of his folly every night.

===War of the Lance===
Several centuries later, the evil goddess Takhisis launched the War of the Lance to conquer Krynn and wanted Lord Soth to assist her armies. Soth informed Takhisis he would only be willing to serve the Dragon Highlord (Takhisis&#x27;s top generals) with enough courage and strength to survive one night in Dargaard Keep. Only the Dragon Highlord known as the Blue Lady, Kitiara Uth Matar, accepted this challenge. Kitiara survived the night, winning Soth&#x27;s service.

Lord Soth would soon prove an invaluable ally to Kitiara. It was Soth that prevented Emperor Ariakas from executing Kitiara for the defeats she suffered in the Vingaard Campaign, and it was Soth who effected the successful kidnapping of Laurana, the Golden General of the Good Armies (who also happened to be Kitiara&#x27;s romantic rival for the heart of Tanis Half-Elven.)

Soth became obsessed with Laurana, whose radiant elven beauty reminded him so much of Isolde, so he entered into a conspiracy with Kitiara where he would help her obtain the Crown of Power from Ariakas in exchange for her having Takhisis grant him the soul of Laurana, who would then suffer in undeath with him for all eternity. Thus at the Council of Highlords in Neraka, Soth personally carried the captive Laurana, who had been tightly wrapped into a cocoon of winding cloth, to Kitiara. The Dragon Highlord then cut Laurana out of the cocoon, offered her up as a gift to Takhisis and received Takhisis&#x27;s blessing for the elfmaid&#x27;s soul to be granted to Lord Soth.

However, Soth&#x27;s desire would be frustrated when Tanis Half-Elven assassinated Emperor Ariakas and then Laurana escaped as the Dragonarmies began fighting amongst themselves. Soth eliminated the Green and Black Dragon Highlords, Kitiara&#x27;s potential rivals for the Crown of Power, during this fighting but failed to obtain Laurana&#x27;s soul, as Kitiara allowed Tanis and Laurana to escape. Soth mocked Kitiara for this apparent act of mercy, but Kitiara then told the death knight she did it only so she would always live in Tanis&#x27; heart, which would forever taint his relationship with Laurana. Soth accepted this answer and then presented Kitiara with the Crown of Power while vowing his undying service to her.

===Blue Lady&#x27;s War===
Several years after the end of the War of the Lance, Lord Soth would again assist Kitiara during the Blue Lady&#x27;s War. Under his command, a great number of undead creatures (including his skeletal warriors and banshees with wyvern-carried chariots) breached Palanthas the Unconquered City. However, Soth had his own motivations. He had become completely obsessed with Kitiara (whose self-serving nature and survival-instinct had somehow rekindled his undead heart), and decided to make her become his eternal consort. Thus Soth waited until the dark elf wizard, Dalamar, struck Kitiara down during the fighting and then claimed Kitiara&#x27;s body. Once Soth had Kitiara&#x27;s body, he had his forces withdraw from Palanthas. Without their undead allies, the rest of Kitiara&#x27;s forces were soon defeated by the Palanthians. However, due to the treachery of one of Soth&#x27;s servants, Caradoc, his plan to obtain Kitiara&#x27;s soul failed. The role-playing video game &quot;Death Knights of Krynn&quot;, in which Soth was featured, also happened during this era.

===Ravenloft===
The Mists of Ravenloft plucked Soth and Caradoc from Krynn while the two battled. His soul was brought to the domain of Barovia; wanting to return to Krynn, Soth sought out Strahd von Zarovich, the ruler of the domain, in the hope Strahd would help him. Strahd tried to use Soth to his advantage but this only cost him a red dragon which was one of his castle guardians. After a series of adventures with the Vistani girl, Magda, and the were-badger Azrael Dak, Soth had found out that Strahd was hiding Caradoc from him. Soth attacked Strahd unceasingly and the vampire had no choice but to release Caradoc in order to keep his domain in one piece. Soth then pursued Caradoc until he finally caught him at the edge of the mists.

Soth was then given the domain Sithicus (&quot;land of spectres&quot; in the elven tongue) in Ravenloft by the Mists after he exacted his vengeance on Caradoc&#x27;s ghost. His new castle, Nedargaard Keep (Solamnic, meaning: &quot;not Dargaard&quot;), was made as mockery of Dargaard in Krynn with a continually changing form so Soth could not maintain the military order he was accustomed to. During the Grand Conjunction he briefly returned to his Krynn body.

Soth&#x27;s experiences in Sithicus had changed him only slightly. Throughout his time in the Dread Realm, Soth found himself entering mirror worlds, each which contained a portion of his past. Through these he lived in worlds of fantasy, ignoring the world beyond his keep. It is believed that his refusal to face his past sins and his willingness to suffer his curse led to his release from the Mists; Soth simply withdrew and ignored Sithicus until he was released.

The story of his ascension is told in &quot;Knight of the Black Rose&quot;, the story of his temporary release is told in &quot;World of Krynn&quot;, and the story of his final release is told in &quot;Spectre of the Black Rose&quot;.

===War of Souls===
In the 2002 book &quot;Dragon of a Vanished Moon&quot;, upon his return to Krynn, Mina, Chosen of Takhisis, attempted to recruit Soth to lead the Dark Queen&#x27;s armies. Soth had dwelt too long in solitude. This was time enough for him to come to peace with himself; to know how he had wronged his wife and child. He refused the goddess&#x27; invitation. In retaliation for this insult, Takhisis ironically delivered Lord Soth one final blessing: she restored his mortality. The Dark Queen then destroyed his keep, crushing him to death beneath its rubble. The fallen knight perished with a measure of his honor restored, vowing that he would forever search for the elf maid and his son in the afterlife. He hoped, that in this search, he would be redeemed.

==Reception==
Lauren Davis of io9 commented that &quot;Lord Soth is one of those great, classically styled villains. The undead man in a suit of armor is nothing new, but Soth is played to nicely creepy effect, and he comes with a horrific backstory straight out of a dark fairytale, one filled with wife murder and lost honor. That he&#x27;s not even the main villain of the piece speaks to Weis and Hickman&#x27;s ability to balance a host of powerful and terrible characters.&quot;

Lord Soth was #10 on &quot;Game Rant&quot;&#x27;s 2020 &quot;10 Must-Have NPCs In Dungeons &amp; Dragons Lore To Make Your Campaigns Awesome&quot; list — the article states that &quot;As an NPC, Lord Soth can prove to be a formidable opponent against an adventuring party. Lord Soth not only has a skeletal army serving him, he can also simply point at living thing and kill them by uttering &quot;Die.&quot;&quot;

Lord Soth appeared on the 2018 &quot;Screen Rant&quot; top list at #12 on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The 15 Most Powerful Villains, Ranked&quot;, and Scott Baird highlighted that &quot;Lord Soth was a death knight from the Dragonlance setting, who later became one of the Darklords of &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, before returning to his homeland.&quot;

==Other media==

===Video games===
Lord Soth was the main antagonist in &quot;Death Knights of Krynn&quot;. In a review of the game in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;, Soth is described as a &quot;necrophiliac&quot; who enjoys nothing as much as &quot;animating some hapless corpse and sending it out to wreak grave consequences on the world.&quot;

Lord Soth also appears as a non-playable character in the video game &quot;Iron &amp; Blood: Warriors of Ravenloft&quot;.

<doc id="916019" wikidata="Q233243" url="?curid=916019" title="Natasha Zvereva">
<text>Natalya &quot;Natasha&quot; Maratovna Zvereva (born 16 April 1971) is a former professional tennis player from Belarus. She was the first major athlete in the Soviet Union to demand publicly that she should be able to keep her tournament earnings. Zvereva and her main doubles partner Gigi Fernández are the most successful women&#x27;s doubles team (measured by WTA Tour and major titles) since Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver.

On 12 July 2010, Zvereva was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame alongside Fernández.

==Personal life==
Zvereva was born as Natalya Maratovna Zvereva in Minsk, Belarus to parents Marat Nikolayevich Zverev and Nina Grigoryevna Zvereva. She started tennis at the age of seven at the encouragement of her parents, who were both tennis instructors in the Soviet Union. While her name is sometimes spelled Zverava, in 1994 she officially changed her name to Natasha Zvereva. At 18, answering the question about her personal symbol of success, she famously replied the following: &quot;A red Mercedes-Benz, a big one&quot;.

==Career==
As a junior, Zvereva won the Wimbledon girls&#x27; singles title in 1986, defeating Leila Meskhi in the final 2–6, 6–2, 9–7. In 1987, Zvereva won the Wimbledon girls&#x27; singles title again, as well as the US Open and French Open girls&#x27; singles titles, making her one of only 2 players to win 4 or more junior titles and one of only 2 players to win 3 or more junior singles titles in a calendar year.

After turning pro, Zvereva won four WTA Tour singles titles and 80 WTA Tour doubles titles, 18 of them in Grand Slam tournaments: five at Wimbledon, four at the US Open, five at the French Open, and four at the Australian Open. She won those Grand Slam doubles titles with four different partners: Gigi Fernández, Martina Hingis, Pam Shriver, and Larisa Savchenko Neiland. She achieved non-calendar year Grand Slams twice: in 1992–93 with Fernández and in 1996–97 with Fernández (three tournaments) and Hingis (Australia).

In addition to her Grand Slam doubles titles, Zvereva teamed with Meskhi to win a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.

Although Zvereva was a highly accomplished doubles player, and considered by some to be one of the best doubles players of all time, she had limited success in singles. Nevertheless, in 1988, at the age of 17, she made her sole Grand Slam singles final at the French Open beating Martina Navratilova en route. In a highly publicized final, she lost to Steffi Graf 6-0, 6-0 in only 34 minutes. The official time of the match given on the scoresheet was 34 minutes, however just 32 minutes of that was spent on the court, as a rain break split the match into two periods of play, of nine and 23 minutes. This was the shortest and most one-sided Grand Slam final in the Open Era. (Graf went on to win all four Grand Slam singles titles and an Olympic gold medal that year.)

Zvereva is one of the few players to have beaten both Graf and Monica Seles, both former world number ones, in the same Grand Slam singles tournament. Ten years later at Wimbledon in 1998, Zvereva defeated the fourth-seeded Graf in the third round 6–4, 7–5 and the sixth-seeded Seles in a quarterfinal 7–6, 6–2. This was also notable because it was Zvereva&#x27;s sole win over Graf in 21 career singles matches. She lost in the semifinals to Nathalie Tauziat which was to be her second best career Grand Slam singles result. Starting with the French Open in 1987 and extending through Wimbledon in 2000, Zvereva played in 51 of the 54 Grand Slam singles tournaments held, reaching the quarterfinals or better eight times.

In addition to her Grand Slam women&#x27;s doubles titles, Zvereva twice won the mixed-doubles title at the Australian Open. She partnered with Jim Pugh to win the title in 1990 and with Rick Leach in 1995.

Zvereva retired from professional tennis in 2003. Her last appearance in a Grand Slam tournament was in Wimbledon 2002, where she lost in the first round to Marlene Weingärtner 6–4, 3–6, 2–6.

==Playing style==
Zvereva used a baseline, counter-punching style centered around topspin and her double-handed backhand. She had great hands, used a variety of spins, and was willing to rush the net and volley. Though Zvereva&#x27;s talent was never in doubt, she often suffered from lapses in concentration during matches and in her confidence as a singles player.

<text>William Wesley &quot;Bill&quot; Hiltz (2 November 1872 – 26 February 1936) was Mayor of Toronto from January 1924 – January 1925. During his term, he introduced time clocks for Toronto city workers. He was also a member of the Orange Order in Canada. He had a son and grandson, with the same names.

==Ancestry==
Hiltz descended from the Hilts families that immigrated to the New World around 1710 presumably from the Palatinate region of Germany because of the wars and famine. The family farmed on the Burnetsfield Patent in Herkimer County, New York. During the American Revolution in 1779, Joseph Hilts was brought as a small child by his grandfather, Joseph Petrie, who was forced to flee to the Province of Quebec, settling in the Niagara Peninsula in Louth Township. Joseph Hilts&#x27; sons later received land grants, with William Hilts receiving one in Esquesing Township, and Edward Thompson Hilts receiving one in Erin Township.

==Early life==
Hiltz was born and raised in Erin at Ballinafad, attending Georgetown District High School in Georgetown, Ontario and Brampton High School in Brampton. He married Annie Laidlaw on Christmas Day in 1899.

He began his career as a teacher, eventually becoming principal of Weston Collegiate Institute in 1899, and in 1901 assistant principal of the Hamilton Street School (now known as Queen Alexandra Middle School). Around that time, he became a building contractor and real estate developer, and quit teaching in 1906 to go into business full-time. During this transition, he had been known to take his students out to the construction sites to dig foundations by shovel. After developing and building over 400 stores and houses east of the Don River by 1920, his real estate properties made him the second-highest taxpayer in Toronto behind Timothy Eaton, the founder of Eaton&#x27;s.

Hiltz was the Danforth Methodist Church superintendent of the largest Methodist Sunday School in Canada. He was also a leading advocate of the temperance movement and was a member of the Loyal Orange Lodge.

==Political career==

During his term as mayor, he actively opposed Adam Beck&#x27;s plans for a network of Hydro radial lines and instead, he was instrumental in getting plans approved for the construction of an elevated railway viaduct in the downtown core -which assured the final opening of the new Union Station. Hiltz&#x27;s opposition to Hydro radial lines led to their rejection and also to his defeat in the following mayoral election.

Hiltz died in 1936 at age 63.

<doc id="916034" wikidata="Q2197061" url="?curid=916034" title="Michael Whelan">
<text>Michael Whelan (born June 29, 1950) is an American artist of imaginative realism. For more than 30 years, he worked as an illustrator, specializing in science fiction and fantasy cover art. Since the mid-1990s, he has pursued a fine art career, selling non-commissioned paintings through galleries in the United States and through his website.

The Science Fiction Hall of Fame inducted Whelan in June 2009, the first living artist so honored. According to his Hall of Fame citation

His paintings have appeared on the covers of more than 350 books and magazines, including many Stephen King novels, most of the Del Rey editions of Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s &quot;Dragonriders of Pern&quot; series, Piers Anthony&#x27;s &quot;Incarnations of Immortality&quot; series, the Del Rey edition of Edgar Rice Burroughs&#x27; &quot;Mars&quot; series, Melanie Rawn&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Prince and Dragon Star&quot; series, the Del Rey editions of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s short story collections, the Grand Master edition of Ray Bradbury&#x27;s fix-up novel &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;, DAW editions of Michael Moorcock&#x27;s Elric of Melniboné books, numerous DAW editions of C. J. Cherryh&#x27;s work, many of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novels including &quot;Friday&quot; and &quot;The Cat Who Walks Through Walls&quot;, the Ace editions of H. Beam Piper&#x27;s Fuzzy novels, and Tad Williams&#x27;s &quot;Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn&quot;, &quot;Otherland&quot;, and &quot;Shadowmarch&quot; series and Brandon Sanderson&#x27;s &quot;The Stormlight Archive&quot;. Whelan provided covers and interior illustrations for Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Gunslinger&quot; and &quot;The Dark Tower&quot;, the first and last of his &quot;Dark Tower&quot; books.

Cover art by Michael Whelan has graced many music record albums. These include Demolition Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Epidemic of Violence&quot;, The Jacksons&#x27; &quot;Victory&quot;; Sepultura&#x27;s &quot;Beneath the Remains&quot;, &quot;Arise&quot;, &quot;Chaos A.D.&quot; and &quot;Roots&quot;; Soulfly&#x27;s &quot;Dark Ages&quot;; Obituary&#x27;s &quot;Cause of Death&quot;; and every album by the Elric-influenced metal band Cirith Ungol. He painted original works for the covers of Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot; and &quot;The Very Best of Meat Loaf&quot; albums and several of his older paintings illustrate the liner notes of the former. In 2009, he painted the cover art for thrash metal band Evile&#x27;s album &quot;Infected Nations&quot;.

== Biography ==
Michael Whelan was born in Culver City, California, the son of William and Nancy Whelan. As a child, he had a nomadic existence, moving nearly every other year, as the family followed his father&#x27;s career in the aerospace industry. So he attended eight elementary schools, three junior high schools and four high schools, and often lived for a summer in other locations. He grew up in Colorado, several cities along the California coast, and in New Mexico, near the White Sands Missile Range. Whelan&#x27;s time near White Sands and Vandenberg Air Force Base proved a lasting influence; in a 2000 interview, he noted that &quot;living near to missile launching sites and Air Force bases had an impact. It was always thrilling to watch them go up ... and sometimes blow up.&quot;

By the time he was a sophomore in high school, his family had moved to Denver, Colorado. There he began formal training in art, taking summer classes at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design when he was 15.

Whelan continued school as a pre-medical biology major at San José State University, initially. There he worked in the Anatomy and Physiology Department, gaining a first-hand knowledge of human anatomy. He says that his job &quot;involved all sorts of tasks related to the anatomy department, such as preparing cadavers for the classes, stringing bones together to make complete skeletons, making models of body parts, some medical illustration, etc.&quot;

After graduating from San José State University in 1973 with a BA in Painting (as a &quot;President&#x27;s Scholar&quot;), Whelan studied at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California for nine months from 1973 to 1974. In 1974, Whelan exhibited his work at the World Science Fiction Convention in Washington, D.C., where it was seen by Thomas Schlück, who first discovered his work and contracted to use it in European publications shortly afterwards. Donald A. Wollheim of DAW Books gave him his first American professional assignment—the cover painting and frontispiece drawing for Lin Carter&#x27;s fantasy novel, &quot;The Enchantress of World&#x27;s End&quot; (May 1975).

Shortly after arriving on the East Coast he exhibited some of his student work in the Lunacon convention art show in New York, where it was seen by Harlan Ellison. Ellison obtained the first magazine assignment for him, illustrating Ellison&#x27;s story &quot;Croatoan&quot; which appeared in &quot;Gallery&quot; magazine in June 1975. At Lunacon Michael also met Rick Bryant, who subsequently introduced him to Neal Adams. Adams called the art director of Ace Books and paved the way for his first assignment at Ace. In 1975, Whelan painted the cover illustrations for ten books, eight from DAW and two Ace reprints of early Darkover novels by Marion Zimmer Bradley.

Whelan soon gained a reputation as a talented, imaginative, and dependable cover artist, working for science fiction and fantasy publishers such as DAW, Del Rey, and Ace. Whelan credits the 1978 publication of Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s best-selling &quot;The White Dragon&quot; featuring his cover art as a turning point in his career. The SF Hall of Fame agrees.

Whelan won his first Hugo Award for Best Professional Artist in 1980 at the World Science Fiction Convention in Boston. He went on to win the next Hugos, and at the 50th Worldcon in 1992 was voted the best professional artist of the last 50 years. As of 2010, he has won fifteen Hugo Awards.

When commissioned, Whelan made a practice of reading the entire book that he sought to illustrate, usually twice. &quot;I try to let the book I&#x27;m illustrating determine the approach and subject matter,&quot; he stated. Fantasist Michael Moorcock wrote of Whelan, &quot;I am more than usually grateful for an artist who not only depicts him [Elric] as I imagine (and describe him) but who also manages to capture some of the appropriate atmosphere&quot; (&quot;Wonderworks&quot;, p. 36). Science fiction writer Anne McCaffrey praised him, declaring, &quot;Fortunate indeed is the author who has Michael Whelan for an illustrator&quot; (&quot;Wonderworks&quot;, p. 55).

Whelan illustrated the cover for Meat Loaf&#x27;s 1993 album &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;. He also provided several illustrations for the insert booklet, which were also used for the single releases such as &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything for Love (But I Won&#x27;t Do That)&quot;. Larger versions of his artwork were featured in the album&#x27;s 2002 special edition release. He has since gone on to paint album cover artwork for many other recording artists, from Michael Jackson to Sepultura to Jonn Serrie.

In the early 1990s, Whelan devoted his time to personal visions and gallery works. In 1997, he held his first one-man art show at Tree&#x27;s Place in Orleans, Massachusetts. Its success led to another in 1999 and his eventual semi-retirement from illustration. Over the past two decades, many of Whelan&#x27;s gallery pieces found their way into published projects, including the SPECTRUM art annuals.

Whelan has returned to illustrate several major book covers during his semi-retirement, including the last book of Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;Dark Tower&quot; series, the final volume of Robert Jordan&#x27;s &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot;, covers for &quot;The Last King of Osten Ard&quot; series by Tad Williams, and the first arc of &quot;The Stormlight Archive&quot; by Brandon Sanderson. In 2015, &quot;The Stephen King Companion: Four Decades of Fear from the Master of Horror&quot;, which feature Whelan&#x27;s illustrations, was published by St. Martin&#x27;s Press.

In 2024, Whelan announced in an interview that the cover for &quot;Wind and Truth&quot; would be the last assignment of his illustration career.

Whelan has two children, including Adrian Price-Whelan.

<text>Tetyana Mykolayivna Berezhna (; born 13 November 1982) is an archer from Ukraine.

Berezhna represented Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 14th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 640. In the first round of elimination, she faced 51st-ranked Fotini Vavatsi of Greece. Berezhna defeated Vavatsi, winning 160-156 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced Jennifer Nichols of the United States, losing to the 19th-ranked archer 163-160 in the regulation 18 arrows. Berezhna finished 18th in women&#x27;s individual archery. Berezhna was also a member of the 6th-place Ukrainian team in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Berezhna finished her ranking round with a total of 627 points. This gave her the 38th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Zhang Juanjuan in the first round.

<text>The Karluk River is a stream, long, on Kodiak Island in the U.S. state of Alaska. It begins at Karluk Lake in the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge and flows north and then northwest through Karluk Lagoon to the Shelikof Strait at Karluk.

Sportfishing is popular in this river basin, &quot;the largest and most productive&quot; on Kodiak Island. It has significant runs of sockeye salmon, Coho, pink, Chinook, and chum salmon, and steelhead, and Dolly Varden trout are also prevalent. The entire main stem, rated Class I (easy) on the International Scale of River Difficulty, is floatable by raft or kayak.

<text>In additive combinatorics, the sumset (also called the Minkowski sum) of two subsets formula_1 and formula_2 of an abelian group formula_3 (written additively) is defined to be the set of all sums of an element from formula_1 with an element from formula_2. That is,

:formula_6

The formula_7-fold iterated sumset of formula_1 is

:formula_9

where there are formula_7 summands.

Many of the questions and results of additive combinatorics and additive number theory can be phrased in terms of sumsets. For example, Lagrange&#x27;s four-square theorem can be written succinctly in the form

:formula_11

where formula_12 is the set of square numbers. A subject that has received a fair amount of study is that of sets with &quot;small doubling&quot;, where the size of the set formula_13 is small (compared to the size of formula_1); see for example Freiman&#x27;s theorem.

<text>Clifford Brooks Stevens (June 7, 1911 – January 4, 1995) was an American industrial designer of home furnishings, appliances, automobiles, passenger railroad cars, and motorcycles, as well as a graphic designer and stylist. Stevens founded Brooks Stevens, Inc., headquartered in Allenton, Wisconsin.

In 1944, along with Raymond Loewy and eight others, Stevens formed the Industrial Designers Society of America. Upon his death in 1995, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called Stevens &quot;a major force in industrial design&quot;.

==Background and personal life==
Stevens was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on June 7, 1911. Stricken with polio as a child, he was encouraged by his father to practice drawing while confined to his bed, perhaps motivating his career in design. He studied architecture at Cornell University from 1929 to 1933, and established his own home-furnishings design firm in 1934 in Milwaukee. His son, Kipp Stevens, ran the Brooks Stevens Design Associates until late 2008, when he stepped down.

In 1959, Stevens opened a 12,500sf automotive museum in Mequon, Wisconsin, which became a repository for his own designs as well as others—and became a production facility in the late 1980s for the Wienermobile fleet. The museum closed in 1999, four years after his death.

Stevens died on January 4, 1995, in Milwaukee. He was survived by his wife Alice, children and grandchildren.

==Design==


Stevens is credited with styling the late 1940s Modern Hygiene cannister vacuum cleaners, and designed Harley-Davidson motorcycles including the 1949 Hydra-Glide Harley, one of his first, helping create the new suspension forks in the front, bucket headlight, and the streamlined design. All Harleys since, including models in production now, are based on Stevens&#x27;s body designs.

His designs in home and kitchen appliances were popular, and he is recognized as the originator of the robin&#x27;s-egg-blue phase of 1950s kitchen appliances, as well as the iconic Skylark laminate design popularized by Formica. He also practiced architectural design and graphic design. Of note is his design of the Miller Brewing logo and he is also credited with convincing the company to switch from traditional brown bottles to clear bottles.

As an automobile designer round about 1954 Stevens shaped the &quot;Die Valkyrie&quot; based on the Cadillac Eldorado of the same year. The car had a V-shaped bumper. He redesigned the 1962 Studebaker Gran Turismo Hawk on a minuscule budget. The fast, elegant GT remained until the end of American production. According to Hendry, Stevens also styled &quot;three innovative products for family car use for the 1964-66 period&quot; (which were never manufactured).

He designed the Jeep Wagoneer, which was introduced for 1963 by Willys-Jeep. This model was so popular that it was offered in basically the same form by Jeep&#x27;s subsequent owners, including Kaiser Jeep, AMC, and finally Chrysler, until 1991.

Stevens updated the design of the Oscar Mayer Wienermobile, an American pop-culture icon, using modern fiberglass methods to &quot;put the wiener in the bun&quot; in 1958. He designed engines for Briggs and Stratton. He also designed the university logo for the Milwaukee School of Engineering (MSOE) in 1978 as a part of &quot;The Diamond Jubilee&quot; celebration. The logo remains in use today.

Stevens designed the post-war Skytop Lounge observation cars for the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pacific Railroad&#x27;s Hiawatha passenger trains.

He also designed a series of Excalibur sport cars for Studebaker. Originally intended as a halo car for Studebaker. Studebaker opted out of the program in December 1963 after shuttering US car production. Stevens continued development of the Excalibur and would introduce the car at the New York Auto show in April 1964. In the mid-1960s he and his sons began production of the retro-styled Excalibur, modeled on the 1920s-era Mercedes-Benz SSK roadsters.

Stevens modernized the Aero-Willys sedans that were offered in Brazil in the 1960s, and there is a very Studebaker Hawk-ish look to the body of these cars.

Stevens&#x27;s design contributions to the recreational boating industry included collaborations with Outboard Marine Corp. to style the Evinrude Lark and Johnson Javelin outboard motor series. He also designed the Evinrude Lark concept boat, eventually produced as the Cadillac Sea Lark. Together with Bob Hammond&#x27;s 1956 Lone Star Meteor, these designs may be credited with introducing post-world war automotive styling to leisure craft. Other work in the marine industry include designs for Owens Yacht Company and Cutter Boats as well as a line of stainless steel marine hardware for the Vollrath Company.

Stevens is credited with restyling the front end of the Volkswagen 411, marketed as the &quot;412&quot;.

==Planned obsolescence==
Though he is often cited with inventing the concept of planned obsolescence (the practice of artificially shortening product lifecycle to influence the buying patterns of consumers in favor of manufacturers), he did not invent it but rather popularized the term. Stevens defined it as &quot;instilling in the buyer the desire to own something a little newer, a little better, a little sooner than is necessary&quot;. His view was to always make the consumer want something new, rather than create poor products that would need replacing. There is some debate over his role in this controversial business practice.

<text>Tonsley railway station is located on the Flinders line in the south-western Adelaide suburb of Tonsley, 12.2 kilometres from Adelaide station. The original station was 13 kilometres from Adelaide and was the terminus of the line from its opening in 1966 until the station&#x27;s closure in 2019; the station was then relocated to its current position and opened in 2020.

==History==

The original station opened on 1 July 1966 when the Tonsley line opened. Trains operated between 07:00 and 19:00 on weekdays, with no weekend services.

To allow for extension of the railway to Flinders, Tonsley station closed on 28 June 2019 and was later demolished. The site of the former station is now occupied by the start of a viaduct that continues the railway over Sturt Road and Main South Road to terminate at Flinders station, adjacent to the Flinders Medical Centre. It was built concurrently with the associated Darlington Upgrade Project.

The replacement of Tonsley station with Flinders station was contested by local residents, who submitted a petition to keep Tonsley station. The Department of Planning, Transport &amp; Infrastructure published a revised plan which would see a new Tonsley station built concurrently with the Flinders extension; located immediately south of Alawoona Avenue before the elevated section of track, the new Tonsley station replaces Clovelly Park station in serving the Tonsley Development Precinct and associated housing development. The new Tonsley railway station opened on 29 December 2020.

==Platforms and services==
Flinders has one side platform and is serviced by Adelaide Metro. Trains are scheduled every 30 minutes, with additional services in the morning and evening peak on weekdays.

<doc id="916083" wikidata="Q2418484" url="?curid=916083" title="Tolkāppiyam">
<text>Tolkāppiyam, also romanised as Tholkaappiyam ( , &quot;lit.&quot; &quot;ancient poem&quot;), is the most ancient extant Tamil grammar text and the oldest extant long work of Tamil literature. It is the earliest Tamil text mentioning Gods, perhaps linked to Hindu deities. 

There is no firm evidence to assign the authorship of this treatise to any one author. There is a tradition of belief that it was written by a single author named Tolkappiyar, a disciple of Vedic sage Agastya mentioned in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (1500–1200 BCE).

The surviving manuscripts of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; consists of three books (&quot;atikaram&quot;), each with nine chapters (&quot;iyal&quot;), with a cumulative total of 1,610 (483+463+664) &quot;sutras&quot; in the &quot;nūṛpā&quot; meter. It is a comprehensive text on grammar, and includes &quot;sutras&quot; on orthography, phonology, etymology, morphology, semantics, prosody, sentence structure and the significance of context in language. Mayyon as (Vishnu), Seyyon as (Skanda), Vendhan as (Indra), Varuna as (Varuna) and Kotṟavai as (Devi or Bagavathi) are the gods mentioned. 

The &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; is difficult to date. Some in the Tamil tradition place the text in the mythical second sangam, variously in 1st millennium BCE or earlier. Scholars place the text much later and believe the text evolved and expanded over a period of time. According to Nadarajah Devapoopathy the earliest layer of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; was likely composed between the 2nd and 1st century BCE, and the extant manuscript versions fixed by about the 5th century CE. The &quot;Tolkappiyam Ur-text&quot; likely relied on some unknown even older literature. The Tolkappiyam belongs to second Sangam period.

Iravatham Mahadevan dates the Tolkappiyam to no earlier than the 2nd century CE, as it mentions the &quot;puḷḷi&quot; being an integral part of Tamil script. The &quot;puḷḷi&quot; (a diacritical mark to distinguish pure consonants from consonants with inherent vowels) only became prevalent in Tamil epigraphs after the 2nd century CE.
According to linguist S. Agesthialingam, Tolkappiyam contains many later interpolations, and the language shows many deviations consistent with late old Tamil (similar to Cilappatikaram), rather than the early Tamil poems of Eṭṭuttokai and Pattuppāṭṭu.

The &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; contains aphoristic verses arranged into three books – the &quot;Eluttatikaram&quot; (&quot;Eluttu&quot; meaning &quot;letter, phoneme&quot;), the &quot;Sollatikaram&quot; (&quot;Sol&quot; meaning &quot;Sound, word&quot;) and the &quot;Porulatikaram&quot; (&quot;Porul&quot; meaning &quot;subject matter&quot;, i.e. prosody, rhetoric, poetics). The &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; includes examples to explain its rules, and these examples provide indirect information about the ancient Tamil culture, sociology, and linguistic geography. It is first mentioned by name in Iraiyanar&#x27;s &quot;Akapporul&quot; – a 7th- or 8th-century text – as an authoritative reference, and the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; remains the authoritative text on Tamil grammar.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Tolkāppiyam&quot; is a attribute-based composite word, with &quot;tol&quot; meaning &quot;ancient, old&quot;, and &quot;kappiyam&quot; meaning &quot;book, text, poem, kavya&quot;; together, the title has been translated as &quot;ancient book&quot;, &quot;ancient poem&quot;, or &quot;old poem&quot;. The word &#x27;kappiyam&#x27; is from the Sanskrit &quot;Kavya&quot;.

According to Kamil Zvelebil – a Tamil literature and history scholar, Tamil purists tend to reject this Sanskrit-style etymology and offer &quot;curious&quot; alternatives. One of these breaks it into three &quot;tol-kappu-iyanratu&quot;, meaning &quot;ancient protection [of language]&quot;. An alternate etymology that has been proposed by a few purists is that the name of the work derives from the author&#x27;s name Tolkāppiyan, but this is a disputed assumption because neither the author(s) nor centuries in which this masterpiece was composed are known.

== Date ==
The dating of the Tolkappiyam is difficult, much debated, and it remains contested and uncertain. Proposals range between 5,320 BCE and the 8th century CE.

The tradition and some Indian scholars favor an early date for its composition, before the common era, and state that it is the work of one person associated with sage Agastya. Other Indian scholars, and non-Indian scholars such as Kamil Zvelebil, prefer to date it not as a single entity but in parts or layers. The Tolkappiyam manuscript versions that have survived into the modern age were fixed by about the 5th century CE, according to Zvelebil. Scholars reject traditional datings based on three sangams and the myth of great floods because there is no verifiable evidence in its favor, and the available evidence based on linguistics, epigraphy, Sangam literature and other Indian texts suggest a much later date. The disagreements now center around divergent dates between the 3rd century BCE and 8th century CE.

The datings proposed by contemporary scholars is based on a combination of evidence such as:
*comparison of grammar taught in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; versus the grammar found in the oldest known Tamil-Brahmi and old-Tamil inscriptions
*comparison of grammar taught in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; versus the grammar found in the oldest known Tamil texts (Sangam era); this evidence covers items such as phonemic shapes, palatals, and the evolution in the use of compounds
*comparison of grammar taught in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; versus the grammar taught and found in the oldest known Sanskrit texts; this includes tracing verses and phrases found in the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; that borrow, translate or closely paraphrase verses and phrases found in the works of ancient and influential Sanskrit scholars such as Panini, Patanjali, Manu, Kautilya, Bharata and Vatsyayana.
*comparison of poetry and prose rules taught in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; versus the actual early Tamil poetry and prose
*Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words (&quot;vadacol&quot;), and inconsistencies between the sutras of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;

=== Dates proposed ===
*In his book published in 1925, T. R. Sesha Iyengar – a scholar of Dravidian literature and history, states that the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; while explaining grammar, uses terms for various forms of marriage in the &quot;Kalaviyal&quot; chapter. Elsewhere it mentions terms related to caste. Such ideas about different weddings and caste, states Iyengar, must be the influence of Sanskrit and Indo-Aryan ideologies. He disagrees with those European scholars who refuse to &quot;concede high antiquity to the Dravidian civilization&quot;, and as a compromise suggests the Tolkappiyam was composed &quot;before the Christian era&quot;.
* In post-Independence India, the Tamil scholar Gift Siromoney states that the Tolkappiyam should be dated based on the chronology of TALBI-P system based inscriptions, which is difficult to date. He suggests that this could be around the time of Ashoka, or centuries later.
* Iravatham Mahadevan dates the Tolkappiyam to no earlier than the 2nd century CE, as it mentions the &quot;puḷḷi&quot; being an integral part of Tamil script. The &quot;puḷḷi&quot; a diacritical mark to distinguish pure consonants from consonants with inherent vowels only became prevalent in Tamil epigraphs after the 2nd century CE.
* V. S. Rajam, a linguist specialised in Old Tamil, in her book &quot;A Reference Grammar of Classical Tamil Poetry&quot; dates it to pre-fifth century CE.
* Vaiyapuri Pillai, the author of the Tamil lexicon, dated Tolkappiyam to not earlier than the 5th or 6th century CE.
* Kamil V. Zvelebil dates the earliest layer, the core &quot;Ur-text&quot; of the Tolkappiyam to 150 BCE or later. In his 1974 review, Zvelebil places Book 1 and 2 of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; in the 100 BCE to 250 CE period. Rest of the sections and sutras of the text to centuries between 3rd and 5th century CE. The extant manuscripts of Tolkappiyam are based on the &quot;final redaction&quot; of the 5th century, states Zvelebil.
* Takanobu Takahashi, a Japanese Indologist, states that the Tolkappiyam has several layers with the oldest dating to 1st or 2nd century CE, and the newest and the final redaction dating to the 5th or 6th century CE.
* A C Burnell, a 19th-century Indologist who contributed to the study of Dravidian languages was of the view that the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; could not be dated to &quot;much later than the eighth century.&quot;
* Herman Tieken, a Dutch scholar, states that the Tolkappiyam dates from the 9th century CE at the earliest. He arrives at this conclusion by treating the Tolkappiyam and the anthologies of Sangam literature as part of a 9th-century Pandyan project to raise the prestige of Tamil as a classical language equal to Sanskrit, and assigning new dates to the traditionally accepted dates for a vast section of divergent literature (Sangam literature, post-Sangam literature and Bhakti literature like Tevaram). Hermen Tieken&#x27;s work has, however, been criticised on fundamental, methodological, and other grounds by G.E. Ferro-Luzzi, George Hart and Anne Monius.

== Author ==
There is no firm evidence to assign the authorship of this treatise to any one author. &quot;Tholkapiyam&quot;, some traditionally believe, was written by a single author named Tolkappiyar, a disciple of Vedic sage Agastya mentioned in the &quot;Rigveda&quot; (1500–1200 BCE). According to the traditional legend, the original grammar was called Agathiam written down by sage Agastya, but it went missing after a great deluge. His student Tolkappiyar was asked to compile Tamil grammar, which is &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;. In Tamil historical sources such as the 14th-century influential commentary on &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; by Naccinarkkiniyar, the author is stated to be Tiranatumakkini (alternate name for Tolkappiyan), the son of a Brahmin &quot;rishi&quot; named Camatakkini. The earliest mention of Agastya-related Akattiyam legends are found in texts approximately dated to the 8th or 9th century.

According to Kamil Zvelebil, the earliest &quot;sutras&quot; of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; were composed by author(s) who lived before the &quot;majority of extant&quot; Sangam literature, who clearly knew Pāṇini and followed Patanjali works on Sanskrit grammar because some verses of Tolkappiyam – such as &quot;T-Col 419&quot; and&quot;T-Elutt 83&quot; – seem to be borrowed and exact translation of verses of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot; and ideas credited to more ancient Panini. Further, the author(s) lived after Patanjali, because various sections of &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; show the same ideas for grammatically structuring a language and it uses borrowed Indo-European words found in Panini and Patanjali works to explain its ideas. According to Hartmut Scharfe and other scholars, the phonetic and phonemic sections of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; shows considerable influence of Vedic &quot;Pratishakhyas&quot;, while its rules for nominal compounds follow those in Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Mahābhāṣya&quot;, though there is also evidence of innovations. The author(s) had access and expertise of the ancient Sanskrit works on grammar and language.

According to Zvelebil, another Tamil tradition believes that the earliest layer by its author(s) – Tolkappiyan – may have been a Jaina scholar, who knew &quot;aintiram&quot; (pre-Paninian grammatical system) and lived in south Kerala, but &quot;we do not know of any definite data concerning the original author or authors&quot;. This traditional belief, according to Vaiyapuri Pillai, is supported by a few Jaina Prakrit words such as &quot;patimaiyon&quot; found in the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;.

==Content==
The &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; deals with &quot;ilakkanam&quot; (grammar) in three books (&quot;atikaram&quot;), each with nine chapters (&quot;iyal&quot;) of different sizes. The text has a cumulative total of 1,610 (Eluttatikaram 483 + Sollatikaram 463 + Porulatikaram 664) &quot;sutras&quot; in the &quot;nūṛpā&quot; meter, though some versions of its surviving manuscripts have a few less. The &quot;sutra&quot; format provides a distilled summary of the rules, one that is not easy to read or understand; commentaries are necessary for the proper interpretation and understanding of &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;.

;Book 1: &quot;Eluttatikaram&quot;

&quot;Eluttu&quot; means &quot;sound, letter, phoneme&quot;, and this book of the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; covers the sounds of the Tamil language, how they are produced (phonology). It includes &quot;punarcci&quot; (&quot;lit.&quot; &quot;joining, copulation&quot;) which is combination of sounds, orthography, graphemic and phonetics with sounds as they are produced and listened to. The phonemic inventory it includes consists of 5 long vowels, 5 short vowels, and 17 consonants. The articulatory descriptions in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; are incomplete, indicative of a proto-language. It does not, for example, distinguish between retroflex and non-retroflex consonants, states Thomas Lehmann. The phonetic and phonemic sections of the first book show the influence of Vedic Pratisakhyas, states Hartmut Scharfe, but with some differences. For example, unlike the Pratisakhyas and the later Tamil, the first book of &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; does not treat /ṭ/ and /ṇ/ as retroflex.

;Book 2: &quot;Sollatikaram&quot;

&quot;Sol&quot; meaning &quot;word&quot;, and the second book deals with &quot;etymology, morphology, semantics and syntax&quot;, states Zvelebil. The &quot;sutras&quot; cover compounds, some semantic and lexical issues. It also mentions the twelve dialectical regions of Tamil speaking people, which suggests the author(s) had a keen sense of observation and inclusiveness for Old Tamil&#x27;s linguistic geography. According to Peter Scharf, the &quot;sutras&quot; here are inspired by the work on Sanskrit grammar by Panini, but it uses Tamil terminology and adds technical innovations. Verb forms and the classification of nominal compounds in the second book show the influence of Patanjali&#x27;s &quot;Mahabhasya&quot;.

;Book 3: &quot;Porulatikaram&quot;

&quot;Porul&quot; meaning &quot;subject matter&quot;, and this book deals with the prosody (&quot;yappu&quot;) and rhetoric (&quot;ani&quot;) of Old Tamil. It is here, that the book covers the two genres found in classical Tamil literature: &quot;akam&quot; (love, erotics, interior world) and &quot;puram&quot; (war, society, exterior world). The &quot;akam&quot; is subdivided into &quot;kalavu&quot; (premarital love) and &quot;karpu&quot; (marital love). It also deals with dramaturgy, simile, prosody and tradition. According to Zvelebil, this arrangement suggests that the entire &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; was likely a guide for bardic poets, where the first two books led to this third on how to compose their songs. The third book&#x27;s linking of literature (&quot;ilakkiyam&quot;) to the grammatical rules of the first and the second book (&quot;ilakkanam&quot;) created a symbiotic relationship between the two. The literary theory of &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;, according to Peter Scharf, borrows from Sanskrit literary theory texts.

Epigraphical studies, such as those by Mahadevan, show that ancient Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions found in South India and dated to between 3rd century BCE and 4th century CE had three different grammatical form. Only one of them is assumed in the &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;. The language of the Sangam literature is same as the one described in &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot;, except in some minor respects.

=== Commentaries ===
The &quot;Tolkappiyam&quot; is a collection of aphoristic verses in the &quot;nūṛpā&quot; meter. It is unintelligible without a commentary. Tamil scholars have written commentaries on it, over the centuries:
The commentary by Ilampuranar dated to the 11th or 12th century CE is the most comprehensive and probably the best, states Zvelebil. The commentary by Senavaraiyar deals only with the second book &quot;Sollathikaram&quot;. The commentary by Perasiriyar, which is heavily indebted to the &quot;Nannūl&quot;, frequently quotes from the &quot;Dandiyalankaram&quot; and &quot;Yapparunkalam&quot;, the former being a standard medieval rhetorica and the latter being a detailed treatise on Tamil prosody. Naccinarkiniyar&#x27;s commentary, being a scholar of both Tamil and Sanskrit, quotes from Parimelalakar&#x27;s works.

== Reception ==

Alexander Dubyanskiy, veteran Tamil scholar from Moscow State University stated, &quot;I am sure that Tolkappiyam is a work which demanded not only vast knowledge and a lot of thinking but a considerable creative skill from its composer.&quot; Dubyanskiy also said that the authority of the text was undeniable: &quot;It is a literary and cultural monument of great importance.&quot;

<doc id="916094" wikidata="Q353869" url="?curid=916094" title="Donald Barthelme">
<text>Donald Barthelme Jr. (pronounced &quot;BAR-thəl-mee&quot; or &quot;BAR-təl-mee&quot;; April 7, 1931 – July 23, 1989) was an American short story writer and novelist known for his playful, postmodernist style of short fiction. Barthelme also worked as a newspaper reporter for the &quot;Houston Post&quot;, was managing editor of &quot;Location&quot; magazine, director of the Contemporary Arts Museum in Houston (1961–1962), co-founder of &quot;Fiction&quot; (with Mark Mirsky and the assistance of Max and Marianne Frisch), and a professor at various universities. He also was one of the original founders of the University of Houston Creative Writing Program.

==Early life==
Donald Barthelme was born in Philadelphia in 1931. His father and mother were fellow students at the University of Pennsylvania. The family moved to Texas two years later and Barthelme&#x27;s father became a professor of architecture at the University of Houston, where Barthelme would later study journalism. Barthelme won a Scholastic Writing Award in Short Story in 1949, while a student at Lamar High School in Houston. (Barthelme also attended St. Thomas Catholic High School in Houston.)

In 1951, as a student, he wrote his first articles for the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. Two years later, Barthelme was drafted into the U.S. Army, arriving in Korea on July 27, 1953, the day of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement, which ended the Korean War. Assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division, he served briefly as the editor of an Army newspaper and the Public Information Office of the Eighth Army before returning to the United States and his job at the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. 

Once back, he continued his studies at the University of Houston studying philosophy. While at the university, he started up a literary journal called &quot;Forum&quot;, which published many future &quot;big names&quot;, including Norman Mailer, Walker Percy, Marshall McLuhan, and William H. Gass. Although Barthelme continued to take classes until 1957, he never received a degree. He spent much of his free time in Houston&#x27;s Black jazz clubs, listening to musical innovators such as Lionel Hampton and Peck Kelley, an experience that influenced his later writing.

==Career==
Barthelme went on to teach for brief periods at Boston University, University at Buffalo, and the City College of New York, where he served as distinguished visiting professor from 1974 to 1975.

===Writing===
In 1961 he became director of the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston; he published his first short story the same year. His &quot;New Yorker&quot; publication, &quot;L&#x27;Lapse&quot;, a parody of Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;L&#x27;Eclisse&quot; (&quot;The Eclipse&quot;), followed in 1963. The magazine would go on to publish much of Barthelme&#x27;s early output, including such now-famous stories as &quot;Me and Miss Mandible&quot;, the tale of a 35-year-old sent to elementary school by either a clerical error, failing at his job as an insurance adjuster, or failing in his marriage. Written in October 1960, it was the first of his stories to be published. &quot;A Shower of Gold&quot;, another early short story, portrays a sculptor who agrees to appear on the existentialist game show &quot;Who Am I?&quot;. In 1964, Barthelme collected his early stories in &quot;Come Back, Dr. Caligari&quot;, for which he received considerable critical acclaim as an innovator of the short story form. His style—fictional and popular figures in absurd situations, e.g., the Batman-inspired &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Greatest Triumph&quot;—spawned a number of imitators and would help to define the next several decades of short fiction.

Barthelme continued his success in the short story form with &quot;Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts&quot; (1968). One widely anthologized story from this collection, &quot;The Balloon&quot;, appears to reflect on Barthelme&#x27;s intentions as an artist. The narrator inflates a giant, irregular balloon over most of Manhattan, causing widely divergent reactions in the populace. Children play across its top, enjoying it literally on a surface level; adults attempt to read meaning into it but are baffled by its ever-changing shape; the authorities attempt to destroy it but fail. In the final paragraph, the reader learns that the narrator has inflated the balloon for purely personal reasons, and he sees no intrinsic meaning in the balloon itself. Other notable stories from this collection include &quot;The Indian Uprising&quot;, a mad collage of a Comanche attack on a modern city, and &quot;Robert Kennedy Saved From Drowning&quot;, a series of vignettes showing the difficulties of truly knowing a public figure. The latter story appeared in print only two months before Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1968 assassination.

Barthelme would go on to write over a hundred more short stories, first collected in &quot;City Life&quot; (1970), &quot;Sadness&quot; (1972), &quot;Amateurs&quot; (1976), &quot;Great Days&quot; (1979), and &quot;Overnight to Many Distant Cities&quot; (1983). Many of these stories were later reprinted and slightly revised for the collections &quot;Sixty Stories&quot; (1981), &quot;Forty Stories&quot; (1987), and posthumously, &quot;Flying to America&quot; (2007). Though primarily known for these stories, Barthelme also produced four novels: &quot;Snow White&quot; (1967), &quot;The Dead Father&quot; (1975), &quot;Paradise&quot; (1986), and &quot;The King&quot; (1990, posthumous).

Barthelme also wrote the non-fiction book &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot; (1974). His other writings have been posthumously gathered into two collections, &quot;The Teachings of Don B.: Satires, Parodies, Fables, Illustrated Stories, and Plays of Donald Barthelme&quot; (1992) and &quot;Not-Knowing: The Essays and Interviews&quot; (1997). With his daughter, he wrote the children&#x27;s book &quot;The Slightly Irregular Fire Engine&quot;, which received the 1972 National Book Award in category Children&#x27;s Books. He was also a director of PEN, the Authors Guild, and a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

==Personal life==
Barthelme&#x27;s relationship with his father was a struggle between a rebellious son and a demanding father. In later years they would have tremendous arguments about the kinds of literature in which Barthelme was interested and which he wrote. While in many ways his father was avant-garde in art and aesthetics, he did not approve of the postmodern and deconstruction schools.

His brothers Frederick (born 1943) and Steven (born 1947) are also respected fiction writers.

He married four times. His second wife, Helen Moore Barthelme, later wrote a biography entitled &quot;Donald Barthelme: The Genesis of a Cool Sound&quot;, published in 2001. With his third wife Birgit, a Dane, he had his first child, a daughter named Anne, and near the end of his life, he married Marion Knox Barthelme, with whom he had his second daughter, Katharine. Marion and Donald remained married until his death in 1989. Marion died in 2011.

==Death==
Barthelme died of throat cancer in 1989.

==Style and legacy==

Barthelme&#x27;s fiction was hailed by some for being profoundly disciplined and derided by others as being meaningless, academic postmodernism. Barthelme&#x27;s thoughts and work were largely the result of 20th-century angst as he read extensively, for example in Pascal, Husserl, Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Ionesco, Beckett, Sartre, and Camus.

Barthelme&#x27;s stories typically avoid traditional plot structures, relying instead on a steady accumulation of seemingly unrelated detail. By subverting the reader&#x27;s expectations through constant non-sequiturs, Barthelme creates a fragmented verbal collage reminiscent of such modernist works as T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; and James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;, whose linguistic experiments he often challenged. However, Barthelme&#x27;s fundamental skepticism and irony distanced him from the modernists&#x27; belief in the power of art to reconstruct society, leading most critics to class him as a postmodernist writer. Literary critics have noted that Barthelme, like Stéphane Mallarmé, whom he admired, plays with the meanings of words, relying on poetic intuition to spark new connections of ideas buried in the expressions and conventional responses. The critic George Wicks called Barthelme &quot;the leading American practitioner of surrealism today... whose fiction continues the investigations of consciousness and experiments in expression that began with Dada and surrealism a half-century ago.&quot; Another critic, Jacob M. Appel, described him as &quot;the most influential unread author in United States history&quot;.

The great bulk of his work was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (where fiction editor Roger Angell was his champion). In 1964, he began to publish short stories collections beginning with &quot;Come Back, Dr. Caligari&quot; in 1964, followed by &quot;Unspeakable Practices, Unnatural Acts&quot; (1968) and &quot;City Life&quot; (1970). &quot;Time&quot; magazine named &quot;City Life&quot; one of the best books of the year and described the collection as written with &quot;Kafka&#x27;s purity of language and some of Beckett&#x27;s grim humor&quot;. His formal originality can be seen in his fresh handling of the parodic dramatic monologue in &quot;The School&quot; or a list of one hundred numbered sentences and fragments in &quot;The Glass Mountain&quot;. Joyce Carol Oates commented on this sense of fragmentation in &quot;Whose Side Are You On?&quot;, a 1972 &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; essay. She writes, &quot;This from a writer of arguable genius whose works reflect what he himself must feel, in book after book, that his brain is all fragments... just like everything else.&quot; Perhaps, the most discrete reference to this fragment comes from &quot;See the Moon?&quot; from &quot;Unspeakable Practices&quot;. The narrator states and repeats the phrase, &quot;Fragments are the only forms I trust.&quot; It is important, however, to not conflate the quote&#x27;s sentiment with Barthelme&#x27;s personal philosophy, as he expressed irritation over the &quot;fragments&quot; quote being attributed so frequently to him rather than his narrator.

Another Barthelme device was breaking up a tale with illustrations culled from mostly popular 19th-century publications, collaged, and appended with ironic captions. Barthelme called his cutting up and pasting together pictures &quot;a secret vice gone public&quot;. One of the pieces in the collection &quot;Guilty Pleasures&quot;, &quot;The Expedition&quot;, featured a full-page illustration of a collision between ships, with the caption &quot;Not our fault!&quot;

Barthelme&#x27;s legacy as an educator lives on at the University of Houston, where he was one of the founders of the prestigious Creative Writing Program. At the University of Houston, Barthelme became known as a sensitive, creative, and encouraging mentor to young creative writing students even as he continued his own writings. Thomas Cobb, one of his students, published his doctoral dissertation &quot;Crazy Heart&quot; in 1987 partly basing the main character on Barthelme.

==Influences==
In a 1971–1972 interview with Jerome Klinkowitz (now collected in &quot;Not-Knowing&quot;), Barthelme provides a list of favorite writers, both influential figures from the past and contemporary writers he admired. Throughout other interviews in the same collection, Barthelme reiterates a number of the same names and also mentions several others, occasionally expanding on why these writers were important for him. In a 1975 interview for Pacifica Radio, Barthelme stresses that, for him, Beckett is foremost among his literary predecessors, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m enormously impressed by Beckett. I&#x27;m just overwhelmed by Beckett, as Beckett was, I speculate, by Joyce&quot;. What follows is a partial list gleaned from the interviews.

*François Rabelais
*Arthur Rimbaud
*Heinrich von Kleist
*Franz Kafka
*Gertrude Stein
*Flann O&#x27;Brien

*Samuel Beckett
*William H. Gass
*Rafael Sabatini
*S. J. Perelman
*Ann Beattie
*Walker Percy

*Gabriel García Márquez
*John Barth
*Thomas Pynchon
*Kenneth Koch
*John Ashbery
*Grace Paley
*Machado de Assis
Barthelme was also quite interested in and influenced by a number of contemporary artists, particularly the &quot;found object&quot; collage techniques of Robert Rauschenberg.

<text>Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao Sr. (; born December17, 1978) is a Filipino politician, businessman, and former professional boxer. Nicknamed &quot;PacMan&quot;, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional boxers of all time. He previously served as a senator of the Philippines from 2016 to 2022.

Pacquiao is the only eight-division world champion in the history of boxing and has won twelve major world titles. He won the lineal championship in four different weight classes (flyweight, featherweight, super featherweight, super lightweight), the first boxer to win major world titles in four of the eight &quot;glamour divisions&quot; (flyweight, featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight), and is the only boxer to hold world championships across four decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s). In July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight world champion in history at the age of 40, and the first boxer in history to become a recognized four-time welterweight champion after defeating Keith Thurman to win the WBA (Super) welterweight title. As of 2015, Pacquiao&#x27;s fights had generated $1.2 billion in revenue from his 25 pay-per-view bouts. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked him the second highest paid athlete in the world in 2012 and 2015, and the eighth highest paid athlete of the 2010s. In 2024, ESPN ranked Pacquiao as the greatest Asian athlete of the 21st century.

Pacquiao entered politics in 2010 when he was elected as the representative of Sarangani. He held this post for six years until he was elected and assumed office as a senator in 2016. He became the leader of then-ruling PDP–Laban party in 2020 (which is disputed since 2021). On September 19, 2021, Pacquiao officially declared his candidacy for President of the Philippines in the 2022 Philippine presidential election; he ended up losing to Bongbong Marcos.

Outside of boxing and politics, Pacquiao was the head coach and a player for the Philippine Basketball Association team Kia/Mahindra for three seasons from 2014 to 2017, before founding the semi-professional Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League. He has also starred in films and has presented television shows. In music, he has released multiple PARI-certified platinum albums and songs; his cover of &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot; peaked at 19 in the United States on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary chart after a performance on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; He is an Evangelical Christian preacher, philanthropist, and entrepreneur.

== Early life and education ==
Manny Pacquiao was born as Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao in Kibawe, Bukidnon, and raised in General Santos, Philippines. He is the son of Rosalio Pacquiao and actress Dionisia Dapidran. His parents separated when he was in sixth grade, after his father had an affair. He is the fourth of six siblings, one of whom, Alberto &quot;Bobby&quot; Pacquiao, is also a politician and former professional boxer.

At the age of 14, Pacquiao moved to Manila and lived on the streets, worked as a construction worker and had to pick between eating or sending money to his mother. Pacquiao completed his elementary education at Saavedra Saway Elementary School in General Santos, but dropped out of high school due to extreme and abject poverty.

In February 2007, Pacquiao took and passed a high school equivalency exam, and was awarded with a high school diploma by the Department of Education.

== Boxing career ==
=== Overview ===
Manny Pacquiao has an amateur record of 60–4 and a record of 62–8–2 as a professional, with 39 wins by knockout. Boxing historian Bert Sugar ranked Pacquiao as the greatest southpaw fighter of all time. In 2021, he ranked number 1 in DAZN&#x27;s list of the top 10 boxers of the last 30 years.

Pacquiao made history by being the first boxer ever to win world titles in eight weight divisions, having won twelve major world titles, as well as being the first boxer to win the lineal championship in five different weight classes. Pacquiao is also the first boxer in history to win major world titles in four of the original eight weight classes of boxing, also known as the &quot;glamour divisions&quot; (flyweight, featherweight, lightweight and welterweight), and the first boxer ever to become a four-decade world champion, winning world championships across four decades (1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s).

Pacquiao was long rated as the best active boxer in the world, pound for pound, by most sporting news and boxing websites, including ESPN, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, Yahoo! Sports, About.com, BoxRec and &quot;The Ring&quot;, beginning from his climb to lightweight until his losses in 2012. He is also the longest reigning top-ten active boxer on &quot;The Ring&quot;&#x27;s pound for pound list from 2003 to 2016.

Pacquiao has generated approximately 20.4 million in pay-per-view (PPV) buys and $1.3 billion in revenue from 26 PPV-bouts. Per Forbes, he was the world&#x27;s second highest paid athlete in 2015.

Pacquiao signed with Bob Arum&#x27;s Top Rank from 2015 to 2017 and Al Haymon&#x27;s Premier Boxing Champions (PBC) promotion on 2018 alongside Paradigm Sports Management on 2020.

On September 29, 2021, Pacquiao announced his retirement from boxing, in a post on social media.

On July 28, 2024, Pacquiao made his debut on Super RIZIN 3 in an exhibition featherweight bout against kickboxer Rukiya Anpo in a boxing match under Rizin Special standing bout rules. As there was no judge&#x27;s decision, the bout ended in a draw.

=== Early years ===
Pacquiao was introduced to boxing at the age of 12 by his maternal uncle Sardo Mejia. According to his autobiography, Pacquiao said watching Mike Tyson&#x27;s defeat of James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas in 1990 with his Uncle Sardo as an experience that, &quot;changed my life forever&quot;. Mejia began training his nephew in a makeshift home gym. After 6 months of training, Pacquiao began boxing in a park in General Santos, eventually traveling to other cities to fight higher-ranked opponents. By age 15, he was considered the best junior boxer in the southern Philippines and he moved to Manila. In January 1995, at the age of 16, he made his professional boxing debut as a junior flyweight.

Pacquiao stated of his early years, &quot;&quot;Many of you know me as a legendary boxer, and I&#x27;m proud of that. However, that journey was not always easy. When I was younger, I became a fighter because I had to survive. I had nothing. I had no one to depend on except myself. I realized that boxing was something I was good at, and I trained hard so that I could keep myself and my family alive&quot;.&quot;

On December 4, 1998, at the age of 19, he won his first major title, the World Boxing Council (WBC) flyweight title.
=== Notable fights ===
Over the course of his decorated career, Pacquiao has defeated 22 world champions: Chatchai Sasakul, Lehlohonolo Ledwaba, Jorge Eliécer Julio, Marco Antonio Barrera (twice), Érik Morales (twice), Óscar Larios, Jorge Solís, Juan Manuel Márquez (twice), David Díaz, Oscar De La Hoya, Ricky Hatton, Miguel Cotto, Joshua Clottey, Antonio Margarito, Shane Mosley, Brandon Ríos, Timothy Bradley (twice), Chris Algieri, Jessie Vargas, Lucas Matthysse, Adrien Broner and Keith Thurman.

Pacquiao&#x27;s most recent bout was against Yordenis Ugás in August 2021.

Pacquiao also participated in an exhibition match against former world champion Jesus Salud in August 2002 which he won.

==== Ranking and awards ====
Pacquiao was named &quot;Fighter of the Decade&quot; for the 2000s by the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA), World Boxing Council (WBC), World Boxing Organization (WBO) and Home Box Office (HBO). In 2006, 2008, and 2009, he was awarded &quot;Ring&quot; magazine, &quot;ESPN&quot; and BWAA&#x27;s Fighter of the Year, and in 2009 and 2011 he won the Best Fighter ESPY Award. BoxRec ranks him as the greatest Asian fighter of all time. In 2016, Pacquiao ranked No. 2 on ESPN&#x27;s list of top pound for pound boxers of the past 25 years and he ranks No.4 in BoxRec&#x27;s ranking of the greatest pound for pound boxers of all time. As of 2022, Pacquiao was ranked ninth in The Ring&#x27;s list of the top 100 boxers of all time.

Manny Pacquiao is a holder of six Guinness Book World Records. He has the most consecutive boxing world title fight victories at different weights at 15, between 2005 and 2011; he is named the oldest welterweight boxing world champion when he claimed the WBA Welterweight title aged 40 years 215 days on July 20, 2019; he has the most boxing world titles won in different weight divisions with eight, when he defeated Antonio Margarito (USA) to win the WBC Super Welterweight title on November 13, 2010. He has also held sanctioned belts in the WBC Flyweight, Super Featherweight and Lightweight divisions, plus The Ring Featherweight, IBF Super Bantamweight, IBO and The Ring Light Welterweight and WBO Welterweight. He recorded the highest selling pay-per-view boxing match in a Welterweight title fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on May 2, 2015, and the highest revenue earned from ticket sales for a boxing match from ticket sales title fight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA, on May 2, 2015.

===Olympics===
Pacquaio has never competed in the Summer Olympics. However, he would participate in the parade of nations of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony as the Philippine delegation&#x27;s flag bearer; the first-ever non-participant to serve as the country&#x27;s flagbearer. Swimmer Miguel Molina, 2005 Southeast Asian Games&#x27; Best Male Athlete, yielded the role to Pacquiao, upon the request of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to national sports officials.

He had the opportunity to compete in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, when professional boxers under the age of 40 were allowed to compete in the games for the first time. However Pacquiao, decided not to compete. Pacquiao would signify his interest to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics in France. The Philippine Olympic Committee would make a failed petition to the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Now 45-years old, Pacquiao was disallowed to participate after the IOC decide to uphold the 40-year-old age limit.

===Earnings===
&quot;Forbes&quot; listed Pacquiao as the world&#x27;s equal sixth highest paid athlete, with a total of $40 million or ₱2 billion pesos from the second half of 2008 to the first half of 2009. Tied with him on the sixth spot was NBA player LeBron James and golfer Phil Mickelson. Pacquiao was again included in &quot;Forbes&quot;&#x27; list of highest paid athletes from the second half of 2009 to the first half of 2010; he was ranked eighth with an income of $42 million. Pacquiao also won the 2009 ESPY Awards for the Best Fighter category, beating fellow boxer Shane Mosley and Brazilian mixed martial arts fighters Lyoto Machida and Anderson Silva. ESPN Magazine reported that Pacquiao was one of the two top earning athletes for 2010, alongside American Major League Baseball player Alex Rodriguez. According to the magazine&#x27;s annual salary report of athletes, Pacquiao earned $32 million (approximately PhP 1.38 billion) for his two 2010 boxing matches against Clottey and Margarito.

==Basketball career==

On April 17, 2014, Pacquiao, a passionate basketball fan, announced his intention to join the Philippine Basketball Association as the playing coach of Kia Motors Basketball team, an incoming expansion team for the PBA&#x27;s 2014–15 season. As the team&#x27;s head coach, he asked other teams to not draft him before Kia, and picked himself 11th overall in the first round of the 2014 PBA draft, being the oldest rookie to be ever drafted in the league&#x27;s history. Pacquiao played basketball as part of his training before his matches and prior to his PBA stint, Pacquiao was named an honorary member of the Boston Celtics and established friendships with Steph Curry and basketball Hall of Famers Kobe Bryant, Kevin Garnett, and Ray Allen. NBA player Karl-Anthony Towns cites Pacquiao as a &quot;legend&quot; &amp; visited him along with Klay Thompson at training.

On September 4, 2014, Pacquiao trained with the Golden State Warriors at their training facility in preparation for his PBA stint.

On February 18, 2015, Pacquiao played briefly and scored one point when the Sorento pulled a 95–84 upset against Purefoods, which had tapped former NBA player Daniel Orton as their import for the conference. When asked about playing against him, Orton said that &quot;[Pacquiao playing] is a joke...Professional boxer? Yeah. Congressman? All right. But professional basketball player? Seriously? It&#x27;s a joke.&quot; Orton was fined by PBA commissioner Chito Salud and was replaced after a few days. He later became one of the Pilipinas MX3 Kings owners in the Asean Basketball League.

On October 25, 2015, Pacquiao made his first field goal in the PBA in a 108–94 loss against the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters. On August 21, 2016, Pacquiao scored a career-high four points in a 97–88 victory against the Blackwater Elite, also sinking the first three-point field goal in his career. 

In 2017, Pacquiao founded the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, initially a semi-professional league. The MPBL turned professional in 2022. In 2018, although being rumored to transfer to Blackwater, Pacquiao officially announced his retirement from the league after playing just ten games in three seasons and scoring less than fifteen career points.

In 2019, he announced that he is &quot;planning to own an NBA team&quot; after boxing retirement.

==Political career==

=== House of Representatives (2010–2016) ===
On February 12, 2007, Pacquiao announced his campaign for a seat in the Philippine House of Representatives to represent the 1st District of South Cotabato province running as a candidate of the Liberal Party faction under Manila mayor Lito Atienza. Pacquiao, said he was persuaded to run by the local officials of General Santos, hoping he would act as a bridge between their interests and the national government. Ultimately Pacquiao was forced to run under the Kabalikat ng Malayang Pilipino (KAMPI), a pro-Arroyo political party by the courts. Pacquiao was defeated in the election by incumbent Rep. Darlene Antonino-Custodio of the Nationalist People&#x27;s Coalition (NPC), who said, &quot;More than anything, I think, people weren&#x27;t prepared to lose him as their boxing icon.&quot;

In preparation for his political career in the Filipino House of Representatives, Pacquiao enrolled in the Certificate Course in Development, Legislation, and Governance at the Development Academy of the Philippines – Graduate School of Public and Development Management (DAP-GSPDM).
On November 21, 2009, Pacquiao announced that he would run again for a congressional seat, but this time in Sarangani province, the hometown of his wife Jinkee. In May 2010, Pacquiao was elected to the House of Representatives in the 15th Congress of the Philippines, representing the province of Sarangani. He scored a landslide victory over the wealthy and politically well-entrenched Chiongbian clan that had been in power in the province for more than thirty years. Pacquiao got 120,052 votes while his opponent for the seat, Roy Chiongbian, got 60,899 votes.
In 2010, Pacquiao made a speech on human trafficking that earned praise. However, he also received criticism for coming out as uninformed during a discussion of the contentious reproductive health bill that same year.

In 2013, he was re-elected to the 16th Congress of the Philippines. He ran unopposed. Additionally, his wife, Jinkee, was also elected as vice-governor of Sarangani, while his younger brother, Rogelio lost his bid as congressman.

Because of other commitments, Pacquiao only attended one Congress session on the congress&#x27; final leg and was criticized for being the top absentee among lawmakers. Pacquiao filed a total of less than 20 bills in six years, with zero of them passing beyond committee.

=== Senate (2016–2022) ===

On October 5, 2015, Pacquiao formally declared that he was running for senator under the United Nationalist Alliance (UNA) party of vice-president Jejomar Binay. On May 19, 2016, Pacquiao was formally elected as a senator by the Commission on Elections. Pacquiao garnered over 16 million votes, landing at 7th place.

Pacquiao earlier aligned himself with the Duterte government. He facilitated on September 18, 2016, the ouster of Leila de Lima (a Duterte critic) from the chairmanship of the Senate Justice committee and criticized de Lima&#x27;s presentation three days later of an alleged member of the Davao Death Squad.

In another Senate hearing, Pacquiao defended then-Davao City Vice Mayor Paolo Duterte from allegations of having a part, along with the vice mayor&#x27;s alleged drinking buddy Charlie Tan and Kenneth Dong, in a 2017 seized ₱6.4-billion shipment of illegal drugs from Xiamen, China, into the Philippines.

As of 2018, Pacquiao has filed a total of 31 Senate bills during the 17th Congress. And in a bill filed alongside Senator Bato dela Rosa and Bong Go, he backed the return of capital punishment.

In June 2019, the Philippine Senate released a data showing Pacquiao as having the worst attendance record among all senators in the 17th Congress, reflecting a struggle Pacquiao had since he was a congressman. Despite the poor attendance, he still managed to enact four laws from the bills he filed.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Pacquiao worked with Alibaba Group co-founder Jack Ma to help bring to the Philippines 50,000 COVID-19 test kits through their respective charity foundations.

In December 2020, Pacquiao became acting party president of PDP–Laban, the ruling political party, when Koko Pimentel resigned. However, the position will eventually become disputed between Pacquiao and Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi. Alfonso Cusi&#x27;s faction through a vote decided that Pacquiao is no longer party president of PDP–Laban on July 17. Melvin Matibag, the deputy secretary-general of PDP–Laban, defended the vote, saying it was organized because the term limits of the party&#x27;s officials had already expired. Pacquiao is still regarded by his faction as party president.

In May 2021, Senator Pacquiao filed a bill proposing to create the Philippine Boxing and Combat Sports Commission. The move, however, was lambasted by Senator Pia Cayetano who criticized the timing of the proposal in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. Pacquiao earlier already tried filing the bill during the 17th Congress when Pacquiao and Senator Franklin Drilon made headlines after Pacquiao called out the latter and senior legislator to use his &quot;common sense&quot; during an interpellation about the topic while Pacquiao was apparently being coached by his advisers after struggling to answer Drilon.

In May 2022, Pacquiao called for the &quot;speedy release&quot; of fellow Senator Leila De Lima, who had been detained for five years, after witnesses against De Lima retracted their testimony. Pacquiao had earlier been vocal about De Lima&#x27;s supposed links to a purported drug lord, Kerwin Espinosa, an allegation that led to De Lima&#x27;s arrest and detention.

===2022 presidential campaign===

As early as June 2020, Pacquiao&#x27;s former promoter Bob Arum declared that the senator expressed that he will run in 2022 in a conversation with him uttering &quot;Bob, I&#x27;m gonna run in 2022 and, when I win, I want you there at my inauguration.&#x27;&quot; Speculations quickly spread around a possible Pacquiao run for president, backed by his own expression of interest in a presidential bid.

In June 2021, he expressed belief that Duterte&#x27;s response towards China&#x27;s claims in the South China Sea was lacking. Duterte rebuked Pacquiao for the statement, saying the latter lacked knowledge in foreign policy. The President also responded to a claim attributed to Pacquiao that the Duterte administration is more corrupt than those by his predecessors; Duterte challenged Pacquiao to name certain individuals or agencies, otherwise he will launch a negative campaign against the senator in the 2022 elections.

A month after being asked about the possibility of him running in the postgame interview after losing his final boxing match against Yordenis Ugas, Pacquiao officially announced his presidential bid on September 19, 2021, during the National Assembly of the PDP–Laban, organized by his faction. On October 1, he formally registered his candidacy under the Cebu-based party PROMDI. This was in accordance with the &quot;MP3 Alliance&quot; established by PDP Laban under Pacquiao&#x27;s faction with PROMDI, and the People&#x27;s Champ Movement. Cusi in response to Pacquiao&#x27;s filing of candidacy under PROMDI decided that he is no longer a member of PDP-Laban.

His platforms include solving corruption and a promise of nationwide housing projects for the poor. Since the campaign period started in February, he had struggled in the presidential surveys with low ratings ranking fourth to fifth among the candidates, dropping to as low as 1.8 percent on the March 2022 poll by Publicus Asia and 8 percent on Pulse Asia with his disapproval rating going up.

In March 2022, amid recent news about frontrunner Bongbong Marcos&#x27; unsettled estate tax dues amounting to 200 billion pesos, Pacquiao openly challenged Marcos to a one-on-one debate and made remarks against critics saying &quot;he&#x27;s not intelligent enough to be president&quot; saying that &quot;the most dumb in this country are those who are going to vote for a plunderer&quot;. Pacquiao only placed third in the election with roughly four million votes and later conceded to Marcos, who won by a landslide.

==Entertainment career==
===Acting and hosting career===

With growing fame, Pacquiao became a celebrity and was obligated to start his acting and hosting career with guest appearances on ABS-CBN shows. He signed a contract as an actor &amp; host with ABS-CBN short-after.

In December 2005, Pacquiao took his first lead role in Violett Films&#x27; &quot;Lisensyadong Kamao&quot; (Licensed Fist). The film is titled so because (according to director Tony Bernal), being a boxer, Pacquiao is licensed to use his hands.

Upon the expiration of his contract with ABS-CBN, Pacquiao signed with GMA Network as an actor and host in September 2007. A few months after, he taped his first episode of the network&#x27;s infotainment show &quot;Pinoy Records&quot;. His other projects with the network included &quot;Totoy Bato&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Show Me Da Manny&quot;, where he appeared as Marian Rivera&#x27;s onscreen loveteam, and in which his mother, Dionisia, also appeared. He also hosted his own game show Manny Many Prizes where he gave out prizes to his audience.

In 2008, Pacquiao starred with Ara Mina and Valerie Concepcion in &quot;Anak ng Kumander&quot; (Child of a Commander). The movie was not a commercial success and was panned by critics.

Pacquiao starred in the superhero/comedy film entitled &quot;Wapakman&quot;, which was released on December 25, 2009, as an entry to the 2009 Metro Manila Film Festival. Like his previous films, &quot;Wapakman&quot; was not commercially successful.

In 2020, he was cast to portray General Miguel Malvar in the upcoming biopic film &quot;&quot; about the Philippine hero, which gained mixed reactions from the Malvar family. Gabriel, grandson of General Malvar&#x27;s youngest child Pablo, worries that Pacquiao&#x27;s fame might overshadow his movie character. While Villegas, son of Malvar&#x27;s daughter Isabel, supports the casting.

===Music career===
Pacquiao recorded songs to use as entrance music for his fights and released them on two albums that were certified platinum locally in the Philippines. Most of the Tagalog songs of Pacquiao were composed by Lito Camo who wrote Pacquiao&#x27;s biggest hit and primarily known song &quot;Para Sayo ang Laban Na &#x27;To&quot;.

On November 3, 2009, Pacquiao covered &quot;Sometimes When We Touch&quot;, originally by Dan Hill, on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, marking his first singing performance on American TV. He went back to the late-night talk show on March 3, 2010, to cover another song, &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Gonna Change My Love for You&quot;. He would later record Dan Hill&#x27;s hit in April 2011 as a single which reached number 19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Adult Contemporary chart. It made Pacquiao one of the few Southeast Asians to enter a US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. He also appeared with Will Ferrell and sang a version of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Imagine&quot; for his third guesting on the show. His appearances on the show led to Canadian rapper Drake impersonating him and making fun of his singing by creating a parody, Pacquiao responded by posting another video of himself singing. In 2015, he released an extended play that featured his own recorded entrance song for his fight against Floyd Mayweather Jr. and shortly announced his retirement from music, being quoted saying &quot;I love music, but music is not for me&quot;.

The following are Manny Pacquiao&#x27;s albums from 2006 to 2015:

*&quot;Laban Nating Lahat Ito&quot; (2006), Star
*&quot;Pac-Man Punch&quot; (2007), MCA

==In popular culture==


A film based on Pacquiao&#x27;s life, &quot;&quot;, was released on June 21, 2006, featuring Filipino actor Jericho Rosales as Manny Pacquiao and was directed by Joel Lamangan. The film flopped at the box office, grossing a total of only P4,812,191 (approximately US$99,322), as confirmed by Lamangan.

Another film, based on Pacquiao&#x27;s early life in boxing, &quot;Kid Kulafu&quot;, was released on April 15, 2015, featuring young actor Robert &quot;Buboy&quot; Villar as Emmanuel &quot;Manny&quot; Pacquiao. The film dramatizes the life of the Filipino boxing superstar during his childhood.

A documentary entitled &quot;Manny&quot;, which featured Pacquiao&#x27;s early life as well as his boxing and political career, was released with Liam Neeson as the narrator.

Pacquiao has featured in the &quot;Fight Night&quot; boxing video game franchise as a playable character. The playable character Paquito, in the mobile game, &quot;Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&quot; was also inspired from Pacquiao. A skin was also made available for Paquito which changes the character&#x27;s appearance to that of the real life boxer. Filipino game developer Ranida Games announced in 2021 that a mobile game revolving around Pacquiao&#x27;s boxing career &quot;Fighting Pride: The Manny Pacquiao Saga&quot; is in the works.

Pacquiao was one of &quot;Time&#x27;s&quot; 100 most influential people for the year 2009, for his exploits in boxing and his influence among the Filipino people. Pacquiao was also included by &quot;Forbes&quot; in its annual Celebrity 100 list for the year 2009, joining Hollywood actress Angelina Jolie and fellow athletes Woods and Bryant.

Pacquiao has also appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine Asia for their November 16, 2009 issue. According to their five-page feature story, &quot;(Pacquiao is) a fighter with enough charisma, intelligence and backstory to help rescue a sport lost in the labyrinth of pay-per-view. Global brands like Nike want him in their ads.&quot; They also added, &quot;Pacquiao has a myth of origin equal to that of any Greek or Roman hero. He leaves the Philippines to make it even bigger, conquering the world again and again to bring back riches to his family and friends.&quot; Pacquiao became the eighth Filipino to grace the cover of the prestigious magazine, after former Philippine presidents Manuel L. Quezon, Ramon Magsaysay, Ferdinand Marcos, Corazon Aquino, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, Benigno &quot;Noynoy&quot; Aquino III and Filipino actress and environmentalist Chin Chin Gutierrez. Pacquiao was also featured on the cover of Reader&#x27;s Digest Asia, where a seven-page story was written about the Filipino boxing superstar. The issue came out in November 2008, before Pacquiao&#x27;s fight against De La Hoya.

Pacquiao is also mentioned in some hip hop tracks including Kool A.D.&#x27;s song entitled &quot;Manny Pacquiao&quot; on his mixtape, &quot;51&quot;. A few notable ones are Pitbull&#x27;s &quot;Get It Started&quot;, A$AP Rocky&#x27;s &quot;Phoenix&quot;, Bad Meets Evil and Bruno Mars&#x27; &quot;Lighters&quot;, Eminem and Skylar Grey&#x27;s &quot;Asshole&quot;, Future&#x27;s &quot;Never Gon&#x27; Lose&quot;, Migos&#x27; &quot;Chinatown&quot;, Nicki Minaj and Ciara&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Legit&quot; and Rick Ross&#x27;s &quot;High Definition&quot;, Jelo Acosta&#x27;s &quot;Just Like Manny P,&quot; and Yung Gravy&#x27;s &quot;Betty&quot; to name a few.

Pacquiao became the first Filipino athlete to appear on a postage stamp.

A video clip of Pacquiao greeting his followers for New Year&#x27;s Eve was used as a meme in the Internet.

==Controversies==
=== Taxation issues ===
On November 26, 2013, a few days after Pacquiao&#x27;s victory over Brandon Ríos, the Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) issued a freeze order on all of Pacquiao&#x27;s Philippine bank accounts due to his alleged failure to pay ₱2.2 billion in taxes for earnings he made in his fights in the United States from 2008 to 2009. A day after the bank account freeze, the BIR also issued an order to freeze all of Pacquiao&#x27;s Philippine properties, whereupon Pacquiao presented documents to the press showing the income tax for non-resident alien payment by his promoter to the BIR&#x27;s US counterpart, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), as well as a letter from Bob Arum. In April 2017, Pacquiao, now a senator, approached Philippine authorities in an attempt to settle the case. The BIR had maintained that taxes were due even if all taxes had been paid to the IRS in the first place.

=== Homosexuality comments ===
In February 2016, Pacquiao, in a video statement posted by TV5, made a comment on the issue of same-sex marriage. Pacquiao, in vernacular, described people in same-sex marriages as behaving worse than animals because, he said, animals generally do not have same-sex mating. LGBT celebrities criticized the statements of the senatorial candidate. Pacquiao later apologized and stated that while, as a Christian, he is still against same-sex marriage, which he said is against Biblical teachings, he did not condemn gay people themselves. Nike ended their longtime partnership with Pacquiao, stating his comments against gay people were abhorrent. The Grove at Farmers Market in Los Angeles also banned Pacquiao from the shopping mall.

Towards the end of the video, Pacquiao clarified that he is not condemning gay people.

===Paradigm Sports Management contract dispute===
In 2021, Paradigm Sports Management – the company Pacquaio signed an exclusive management deal with a year prior – filed a lawsuit against him, alleging he in bad faith breached the contract having two management companies negotiating simultaneously for boxing matches.

In early May 2023, Orange County Superior Court ruled the lawsuit in favor of Paradigm Sports Management, ordering Pacquiao to pay $5.1 million plus at least $2 million in attorney fees, both with 10 percent annual interest. In August 2024, the verdict was overturned and vacated. The court found evidence, that when signing the contract to represent Pacquiao, Audie Attar did not hold a management license, which is required under California law.

== Personal life ==

Pacquiao married Jinkee Jamora on May 10, 1999. Together, they have five children, Emmanuel Jr. (Jimuel), Michael Stephen, Mary Divine Grace (Princess), Queen Elizabeth (Queenie) and Israel. In 2006, Joanna Rose Bacosa, a KTV receptionist, disclosed the existence of her child with Manny named as Emmanuel Bacosa.

His love child, Eman, followed his footsteps and made his boxing debut on September 23, 2023, which ends with a draw. He dedicated his bout against Noel Pangantao last December 15, 2023 for his father. He won the fight and immediately rushed off-ring to Manny after and gave him a hug and a kiss.

Pacquiao resides in his hometown of General Santos, South Cotabato, Philippines. As the congressman representing the lone district of Sarangani from 2010 to 2016, he officially resided in Kiamba, Sarangani, the hometown of his wife. Upon his election to the Senate of the Philippines, he returned his official residence to General Santos, as senators are elected on a nationwide basis, rather than by district.

Pacquiao has a YouTube channel with 990,000 subscribers as of August 2023. The Pacquiao family constantly posts content about their activities together in their own separate YouTube channels. His daughter, Mary and his wife Jinkee both have more than one million subscribers and his sons Jimuel and Michael each have fewer than 600,000.

On June 25, 2010, Pacquiao completed a 10-day crash course on Development Legislation and Governance at the Graduate School of Public and Development Management of the Development Academy of the Philippines (DAP).

Pacquiao was officially enrolled for two semesters at Notre Dame of Dadiangas University (NDDU) in the Academic Year 2007-2008 under the bachelor&#x27;s degree of business administration major in marketing management program, however, Pacquiao was not able to finish the program and NDDU did not grant him a college degree.

From June 8 to 17, 2016, Pacquiao underwent another 9-day Executive Coaching Program crash course conducted by the Development Academy of the Philippines, the Ateneo School of Government, the Asian Institute of Management, and the Philippine Public Safety College after he won a senate seat in 2016.

On December 11, 2019, Pacquiao controversially graduated from the University of Makati with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science; majoring in local government administration through the Expanded Tertiary Education Equivalency and Accreditation Program (ETEEAP) of the Philippine Councilors League-Legislative Academy (PCCLA) which allows qualified Filipinos to complete a collegiate-level education via informal education system. Pacquiao reportedly completed the degree in one year, contrary to earlier reports of three months.

Raised Catholic, Pacquiao is currently practicing and preaching Evangelical Protestantism. Pacquiao said he once had a dream where he saw a pair of angels and heard the voice of Godthis dream convinced him to become a devout believer.

Pacquiao enlisted as a military reservist and was promoted with the rank of colonel in the Reserve Force of the Philippine Army. Prior to being promoted to full colonel after finishing his General Staff Course (GSC) schooling, he held the rank of lieutenant colonel for being a member of the Philippine Congress as per the AFP&#x27;s regulations for reservist officers. He first entered the army&#x27;s reserve force on April 27, 2006, as a sergeant. Later, he rose to Technical Sergeant on December 1 of the same year. On October 7, 2007, he became a Master Sergeant, the highest rank for enlisted personnel. On May 4, 2009, he was given the special rank of Senior Master Sergeant and was also designated as the Command Sergeant Major of the 15th Ready Reserve Division.

In 2022, Pacquiao graduated from Philippine Christian University, with a master&#x27;s degree in management, majoring in public administration.

<doc id="916101" wikidata="Q3336009" url="?curid=916101" title="River Nar">
<text>The River Nar is a river in England, a tributary of the River Great Ouse. It rises at Mileham near Litcham in Norfolk and flows 15 miles west through Castle Acre and Narborough (the latter giving the Nar its name), joining the Ouse at King&#x27;s Lynn. It has had a variety of alternative names, such as the Setch, the Sandringham, and Lynn Flu, though these are rarely, if ever, used today. In 2011 the Nar was recognised by the Environment Agency as one of the top ten most improved rivers in England and Wales.

The final section of the river near its mouth was diverted northwards when the Great Ouse was re-routed to a new outfall at King&#x27;s Lynn after the thirteenth century. The river was made navigable from its mouth to Narborough and probably to West Acre as a result of an Act of Parliament obtained in 1751. Ten single-gate sluices and a pen sluice (or pound lock) were used to handle the change in level. The use of the river declined rapidly after the opening of a railway from King&#x27;s Lynn to Dereham between 1846 and 1848. In 1884, the river was taken over by the River Nar Drainage Board, and closed to navigation, when an un-navigable sluice was constructed to the south of a Manure Factory in King&#x27;s Lynn. A new sluice very close to the junction with the Great Ouse has been built more recently.

The river has been used to power a number of mills over the centuries. The buildings or remains of five are still visible, and some still contain original machinery. Narborough Bone Mill had no road access, and bones from the whaling industry and from cemeteries in Hamburg were delivered by barge, to be ground into bone meal. The mill closed when the river was taken over, and just the mill wheel remains on the bank.

The river is a long biological Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Route==
The river rises from springs on the chalk uplands close to the contour to the south-west of Tittleshall. It initially flows to the east and then to the south to cross under the B1145 Litcham Road to the west of Mileham. Turning to the west, it passes through the south of Litcham and enters a series of lakes at Lexham Hall, where it is joined by Broad Water. Lexham Hall is a large grade I listed mansion, which was built around 1700. During the Second World War, the estate was occupied by the army, and the grounds and house were severely damaged. It was bought by William Foster in 1946, who gradually restored it, assisted by the architect Jim Fletcher Watson. The gardens are open to the public on selected weekends during the year, although the house is not. Continuing westwards, the river reaches the lakes of West Lexham Hall. It is joined by a stream flowing northwards from Little Dunham before it crosses under the A1065 road and flows through Emanuel&#x27;s Common. The disused Newton water mill is passed before the river reaches the village of Newton. By the time it reaches Castle Acre it is below the contour.

The river is now wider and starts to form meanders. It passes more lakes at South Acre Hall, a large farmhouse parts of which date from the sixteenth century, and then crosses Castle Acre Common, and there are several lakes in Big Wood. A mill was located at the end of the wood. The main channel and the mill bypass both cross a minor road at fords. At West Acre the river passes the remains of an Augustinian priory and then Narford Lake, by Narford Hall. The remains of the priory are grade II listed and a scheduled ancient monument. The Hall is grade I listed, and was built between 1690 and 1704 by Andrew Fountaine of Salle in Norfolk. It was enlarged in the 1830s. The river passes to the north of Narborough, where there are lakes and a fish farm. The A47 Narborough Bypass crosses, as does the original main road to Narborough, beside which is a former water mill, built in the eighteenth century and repaired in the late twentieth, which still contains much of the milling machinery. The Lynn and Dereham Railway line used to cross to the west of Narborough, but it is now dismantled. The Nar Valley Way, a long-distance footpath which has been following the valley for most of the length of the river now runs along the river bank. Numerous drainage ditches are associated with the next stretch of the river, and after passing Abbey Farm, where there are the remains of another Augustinian Priory, the river is embanked, with flood banks on both sides. The Nar Valley Way crosses from the south bank to the north at the start of the embanking.

Some large lakes are located to the north of the channel, which were formerly a sand and gravel pit. High Bridge carries the road from Blackborough End to Wormegay over the river, and Setchey Bridge carries the A10 road at Setchey. A little to the west, the channel turns to the north, where it is crossed by the railway line from Downham Market to King&#x27;s Lynn. The A47 road, the A148 road and another minor road cross at South Lynn, and the river then joins the River Great Ouse at a sluice.

==Hydrology==

There is a gauging station at Marham, which records river data by measuring the flow over a flume. The catchment area of the river above this point is and the area receives an average of of rain each year. This results in an average daily flow of 22 million gallons (100 Megalitres (Ml)), although flows reached nearly twice this value in February 1977. The geology of the upper river consists of chalk covered by a layer of boulder clay, making it one of only a few remaining fenland chalk streams. At its source, the river is formed by surface runoff from the clay soils, but this is soon supplemented by springs in the chalk aquifer to the east of Litcham, which create a rapidly flowing chalk river. Rainfall is purified as it passes through the chalk, and the spring water, which is crystal clear, alkaline, and always cool, gives the river its chalk stream characteristic. For this reason, the whole of the river is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest, one of only ten chalk streams which have been designated in this way in the United Kingdom.

In 2011 the Nar was recognised by the Environment Agency as one of the top ten most improved rivers in England and Wales, and was ranked seventh in the list. Historically, the engineering of the channel, to make it straighter, deeper and wider, first for navigation and later for land drainage, took no account of the destruction of habitat which such action causes. Some improvement has been made by setting the flood banks further back from the channel, and creating artificial meanders within the resultant flood plain. Structures which inhibit the passage of animal life, such as weirs, have also been removed where possible. Other improvements have been achieved through the Catchment Sensitive Farming (CSF) scheme, which helps farmers to reduce the runoff of pesticides and fertiliser into watercourses. The river provides habitat for sea trout, which are quite rare in East Anglia, while its banks are frequented by water voles and otters. 78 different types of river plants have been identified growing in or along it, which includes the southern marsh orchid, while insects found include 12 different species of dragonfly. Grey wagtails, kingfishers, reed warblers and willow and marsh tits are some of the constituents of the bird population.

==History==

While most of the river channel follows its historic route, the section near the mouth has been altered. Below Setchey, it formerly flowed further west to Wiggenhall, where it turned to the north and was joined by the waters of the Gaywood River. However, the waters of the River Great Ouse and the River Cam, which once flowed to Wisbech, were diverted northwards to King&#x27;s Lynn in the thirteenth century, and the Nar was also re-routed to join the new channel near King&#x27;s Lynn. Although the precise date of the diversion is not known, there is a tradition that it was in 1236 after floods occurred in Littleport.

Powers to improve the river for navigation were obtained in 1751, when the people of King&#x27;s Lynn, Narford, Narborough, Swaffham, and Castle Acre petitioned parliament and were granted an Act of Parliament to authorise the work. There was no opposition to the plans, which were intended to make the river navigable as far as West Acre. Commissioners were appointed, any nine of whom could agree to improve the river by constructing locks, removing annoyances, and creating towing paths. Tolls were specified, which could only be charged on goods travelling more than above the bridge at Setchey, and pleasure boats were also exempt from tolls. The carriage of guns and nets to catch wildfowl and fish was prohibited, and the commissioners could borrow money to finance the work, with the toll revenue acting as security.

There was an initial burst of activity, with the commissioners asking John Aram and Langley Edwards to produce a survey and estimate the cost of the work in June 1751, which was duly produced. The men recommended canalising some stretches of the river, and suggested that seven staunches and a pen sluice would be needed. A large basin would be constructed close to West Acre bridge. No further action was taken until 1757, when a treasurer was appointed. He advertised for subscribers, who would receive the toll revenues, and Langley Edwards was appointed to carry out the work. The navigation would be suitable for lighters holding 10 tonnes, and the locks would be large enough to hold a single lighter.

Edwards estimated that the cost would be £2,500, with staunches costing £50 each. Edward Everard, a merchant from King&#x27;s Lynn, and Robert Crow, a gentleman from Swaffham, advanced £2,600 to fund the work, and Edwards was given the contract. It began at the end of September 1757, and he had just one year to complete it. He would not be paid until the work was completed. A year passed, and although £1,900 had been spent, the work was nowhere near complete. The completion date was moved to 1 January 1759, and then 15 February, after which Edwards would suffer a penalty of £20 per week until the work was completed. Two extra staunches were required, which the commissioners felt should be paid for by Edwards. He appealed, and was given until 3 August to complete the work, present his accounts, and justify his appeal. The works were finished by this date, but it is unclear who paid for the two staunches.

===Operation===
The Commissioners considered applying for a new Act of Parliament in 1760, to create a new cut linking the river at Setchey to the Great Ouse by the shortest route. Tolls for the half year ending in March 1761 amounted to £59 and yielded a profit of £26. The tolls were increased to the maximum allowed by the original act, and the clerk was asked to look at letting the tolls out, so that they did not have to finance their collection. At this point, the Commissioners appear to lose interest, and no further meetings were recorded. The Revd Henry Spelman purchased the interest in the navigation some time before 1770, and became the sole representative of the proprietors and subscribers. He stated that the commissioners had borrowed £3,500, and that with interest, the debt due to him had risen to £4,718. The navigation was unusable in parts, and believed that the commissioners had failed in their duties. He obtained a second Act of Parliament, under which £800 would be spent on improvements. He loaned the navigation £1,345 to cover the cost of the work and of obtaining the act, to be added to his existing debt, all of which would accrue interest at five per cent.

Although the act stated that the locks would be fitted with upper and lower gates, making them into pound locks, only Edwards&#x27; pen sluice, located beneath the A47 at Narborough, was constructed in this way. The ten staunches in the upper raised the level by . Nine consisted of a single guillotine gate, while that at Upper Bonemill was fitted with mitre gates. The sluices were a little over wide, and although no evidence of any construction above Narborough has been found, it appears likely that it reached West Acre bridge. It also appears likely that branches at Wormegay and Blackborough Priory were navigable.

Records for the wharf at Narborough indicate that the main cargoes carried were coal, corn, malt and timber. Another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1815, in connection with draining and improving the parishes near Wormegay. This made provision for making the Nar deeper, wider and straighter. The locks were to be supervised by a civil engineer, with repair work to be carried out using oak timber, rather than fir. There was also provision for compensation for tolls lost as a result of the work.

===Decline===
By the middle of the nineteenth century, the Marriott brothers, who owned a wharf at Narborough, and whose business included malting and selling coal and corn, also controlled the navigation. They formed an association, with some local landowners, to resist the construction of the Lynn and Dereham Railway line from King&#x27;s Lynn to Dereham. Their cause was not successful, and the line opened from King&#x27;s Lynn to Narborough on 1846, and onwards to Dereham in 1848, after which trade on the river declined. An Act of Parliament for the Nar Valley Drainage scheme, obtained in 1881, included a clause to remove the need to maintain the river for navigation, and navigation to Narborough ceased in 1884, when construction of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented boats from accessing the river at King&#x27;s Lynn.

The final stretch of the river, called Friars Fleet, was used by steam tugs and barges delivering gas water from Cambridge Gas Works to the West Norfolk Farmers Manure Works until 1932. To the south of the factory, the tidal doors of the Old Nar Tidal Sluice prevented the tide passing further upstream. A wharf called Boal Quay was served by coasters, and fishing boats moored in the channel. With the removal of the Kings Lynn Harbour Branch railway line which crossed a large loop on this section, the river was diverted to a new sluice close to the Ouse, although two-thirds of the loop remains as a tidal inlet. To mitigate against flood risks, a flood diversion channel was constructed between the Nar and the Ouse Flood Relief Channel in 2001, at the point at which they are closest. A sluice was constructed in the flood bank, which is controlled by electric motors, and the new channel joins the Flood Relief Channel upstream from Saddlebow Bridge.

==Proposals==
There were plans to make the final part of the river navigable again, as part of a scheme to create a non-tidal route from King&#x27;s Lynn to the Great Ouse, which included a marina at Boal Quay and a sea lock near the final sluice. It would have been part of a much larger regeneration project for the south of the town, and the river would have been linked to the Great Ouse Flood Relief Channel, which currently terminates at a sluice a little to the south of the A47 road. Various routes for the connecting link were considered, but the preferred route was to utilise the flood diversion channel, constructed in 2001. This would have been enlarged, and the two bridges, located on Thiefgate Lane and the bank of the Flood Relief Channel, would have been rebuilt to provide more headroom. However, the non-tidal link was eventually abandoned, as there were concerns over environmental issues, the channel was thought to be too narrow to accommodate boats travelling in opposite directions, and some of the bridges would not have provided sufficient headroom. The scheme was modified to include a lock from the end of the flood relief channel back into the Ouse, with the sea lock and marina being retained. These plans have since been deferred, due to the change in the financial situation and the collapse of land values.

==Drainage==
Most of the river is classified as a main river, and is therefore the responsibility of the Environment Agency. Below Narborough, the river acts as a highland carrier, as it is constrained by flood banks and the water level may be above the level of the surrounding land. Drainage from that land into the river is not, therefore, possible by gravity, and an area of is managed by the East of Ouse, Polver and Nar Internal Drainage Board (IDB), who maintain drainage channels and pumping stations to mitigate the risk of flooding. Their area of responsibility, of which 87 percent is agricultural land, includes most of the Nar Valley. The catchment that supplies this area is much larger, at , as water flows from the higher ground around its edges. As the area is low-lying, a network of drainage ditches feeds into larger drains, and the IDB maintains seven pumping stations to discharge water into the main rivers. Six of these are at Polver, Nar Valley, Mill Fen, Mow Fen, Chain Bridge and Saddlebow. The Puny Drain formerly ran to a gravity outfall sluice in King&#x27;s Lynn, but has been re-routed to discharge into the Ouse Relief Channel.

The Polver Drain runs along the south side of the river, and continues to the Ouse Relief Channel, where there is a pumping station. The Puny Drain runs to the north of the river, and turns to the north near Setchey. It formerly ran to a syphon which carried it under the Nar just upstream of the 1884 sluice, and ended at a gravity outlet on the bank of the Ouse. As part of the redevelopment of the area to the south of King&#x27;s Lynn, the drain was re-routed to a new outfall some further upstream. This involved the construction of a new channel from West Winch Common to near Saddlebow Bridge. The route had to cross the main railway line into King&#x27;s Lynn and the River Nar. To accommodate this, syphons were constructed under both. For the railway, a shaft was constructed on each side of the track to a depth of , and two pipes connected the shafts, running around below the level of the tracks. A culvert in diameter was constructed beneath the Nar, at a depth of around , and below the bed of the river. A new pumping station, consisting of three pumps and located at the inland end of the syphons, is capable of pumping 76M gallons (345 Ml) per day. The design uses syphon breaking valves to reduce the size of the pumps required, and hence the power consumption.

The scheme cost £5.5 million, and was achieved over an 18-month period starting in September 2006, after two years of negotiation with Railtrack to get the design for the tunnel under the railway approved. Around of new drain were constructed and of the existing drain were regraded. The project was complicated by the fact that much of the site it within the River Nar Site of Special Scientific Interest, and had to be approved by Natural England. The work was done in small sections to mitigate the impact on badgers, water voles and other wildlife. The final section of the original route, from the syphon under the River Nar to the Great Ouse, has since been filled in as it ran through the Nar Ouse Regeneration Area, and the first building to be built on the reclaimed land was St Michael&#x27;s Primary School.

The construction of the flood diversion channel in 2001, to discharge excess water into the Ouse Flood Relief Channel, was part of a larger scheme, which included the raising of flood banks further upstream, and the provision of a flood storage area. To allow for the drainage of surface water from the Nar Ouse Regeneration Area, the channel below the bridge on Wisbech Road has been enlarged. Part of Blubberhouse Creek has been re-excavated, to create a flood relief basin. Although it will not normally contain any water, in storm conditions where high water levels in the Ouse prevent the discharge of water from the Nar, the basin may be filled to a depth of up to , and will drain back into the river once tide levels fall, normally after 5 to 6 hours. This work was completed in April 2011.

==Mills==

The river has provided the power for several mills over many centuries. Working downstream from the source, the first mill was at Newton by Castle Acre. The site was mentioned in the Domesday Book. The present mill was built in brick with a pantiled roof, and a mill house, built with stone from a ruined priory, was attached. The mill was then enlarged, resulting in it having a different roof line to the house. It was used for kibbling corn in the 1930s. By 1972, when the mill was restored, the mill house was just a shell with no roof, and it had been demolished by 1977. A new mill house was built in the 1990s by a Norfolk historian, in a similar style to the original. Most of the machinery, including the wheel, were still in place in 2003, although not operational.

West Acre mill was a four-storey building, with a brick-built ground floor and the upper storeys built in weatherboarded timber. It had a pantiled roof, with a mill house attached. The ground floor of the mill dated from the 15th century, and appeared to be built from material obtained from West Acre Abbey. The water wheel drove four pairs of grinding stones, although only two were used in later years. The four-level stone driving frame, which allowed all four wheels to be operated at once, was noted as an outstanding example of milling machinery in the 1950s, when the building was surveyed, but it was demolished in 1959, as it was deemed to be unsafe. The mill house remains.

Narborough Mill was a large three-storey building built in 1780. Charles Tyssen added an extension in 1845, but failed to provide adequate foundations, and the addition gradually sank until the roof collapsed in 1980. In 1887, there was an engine house on the front of the mill, but this then became a house for the miller. After the collapse of the extension, thirteen piles were used to stabilise the rest of the building before restoration began. A water wheel drove a horizontal shaft, which powered four sets of millstones, later extended to six. Although the mill ceased to operate in the early 1950s, most of the machinery remains intact.

Narborough Bone Mill was further downstream, and did not have any road access, as bones were delivered by boat, and the ground bonemeal was taken away by boat. It was built in the early nineteenth century, and was used to grind bones from local slaughterhouses, whalebones from the King&#x27;s Lynn whaling industry, and bones from cemeteries in Hamburg. The mill ceased to work in 1884 or soon afterwards, when the Nar Valley Drainage Board built a sluice near the mouth of the river, preventing use of the river by boats. Despite this, the wheel remains as a prominent feature on the bank opposite the towpath.

The final mill was at Pentney, and it was originally owned by the nearby priory. After the demise of the priory, the village gradually moved towards Narborough, leaving the mill isolated, and it ceased to be used in the 19th century. The remains show that it was built of white brick, and trade directories from the 19th century show that it was used as a pub once it ceased to be a mill.

==Water quality==
The Environment Agency measure the water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the River Nar system was as follows in 2019.
The reasons for the quality being less than good include physical modification of the channels, and in the case of Middleton Stop Drain, naturally occurring nickel and its compounds. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) and mercury compounds, neither of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>Ingrid Jonker (19 September 1933 – 19 July 1965) was a South African poet and one of the founders of modern Afrikaans literature. Her poems have been widely translated into other languages.

Born into an Afrikaner family with four hundred year old roots in South Africa, Ingrid Jonker grew up in a broken home. After the death of her mother, she and her sister Anna moved in with their estranged father, where they faced secret and escalating emotional abuse from their step mother before both moving out.

During the 1950s and 1960s, which saw the Sharpeville massacre, the increasingly draconian enforcement of Apartheid laws, and escalating terrorism committed both by Government security forces and by the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress, Jonker chose to affiliate herself with Cape Town&#x27;s racially mixed literary bohemia, which gathered around her fellow Afrikaner poet and literary mentor Uys Krige in the beach-side suburb of Clifton. In both her poems and in newspaper interviews, Jonker denounced the ruling National Party&#x27;s racial policies and the increasing censorship of literature and the media. This brought her into open conflict with her father, a widely respected Member of Parliament for the ruling Party. In 1965, Jonker&#x27;s childhood trauma, recent failed marriage, and her disastrous relationships with several different men led to her major depression and finally suicide by drowning. Even so, Jonker has reached iconic status in post-Apartheid South Africa and is often compared with Sylvia Plath and Marilyn Monroe.

==Family origins==
On both sides of the family, the ancestors of Ingrid Jonker had lived in South Africa for centuries. Her forefather on her father&#x27;s side, Adolph Jonker, was the son of a plantation owner from Macassar, in the Dutch East Indies, and had emigrated to the Cape Colony during the early 18th century. Adolph Jonker became the schoolteacher and warden of the Dutch Reformed congregation at Drakenstein. In 1740, he married Maria Petronella Langeveld, the daughter of Jacobus Langveld and an unknown woman from the Cape.

Ingrid&#x27;s father (1905–1966), was born on 22 April 1905 on the Kalkfontein farm, in the Boshoff district of the former Orange Free State. In 1910, Abraham lost his older sister to drowning. As he later recalled, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t five years old yet and she drowned in the Vaal River at the age of eight, on the same day that King Edward VII died, because I still remember well how all the flags were hanging half-mast when we went to fetch the little coffin in town the following day with the hooded cart – the day my late father came to wake us at four o&#x27;clock to see Halley&#x27;s Comet that was clearly visible in the sky. We all felt so awful, because my late sister&#x27;s little body was still lying in the house.&quot;

After graduating high school in 1922, Jonker studied at the University of Stellenbosch between 1923 and 1930. He obtained a Bachelor&#x27;s Degree, majoring in Ancient Greek and Dutch and in theology. Jonker&#x27;s theological studies, were, however, more out of a desire to please his parents than out of any real interest. In 1928, Jonker was awarded the theological candidates diploma with honours.

According to a December 1966 article by Jack Cope in the &quot;London Magazine&quot;, Ingrid&#x27;s, &quot;mother, Beatrice Cilliers, came from an old Huguenot family, with generations of intellectual attainments.&quot;

While the ancestors of the Cilliers family had left France in order to continue practicing their Calvinist faith, Ingrid&#x27;s grandfather, Stephanie &quot;Swart Fanie&quot; (&quot;Black Stevie&quot;) was known for his indifference to religious practice and mockery of dignified local Dutch Reformed ministers. Ingrid&#x27;s grandmother, Annie Retief Cilliers (1873–1957), was a devoutly religious woman who enjoyed preaching to coloured people. She attended the Apostolic Church, because they were so &quot;lively and jolly&quot;, as Ingrid later wrote.

Ingrid&#x27;s sister, Anna Jonker, later wrote, &quot;The one story Ingrid always wanted to hear, was how it happened that Oupa married Ouma. Ouma had been in love with Oupa&#x27;s brother, but he had the habit of crowing like a rooster – and the Ouma would crow, to let us hear what it sounded like – so she decided to marry Swart Fanie. The story always ended with, &#x27;And I used to think he wouldn&#x27;t be that foolish!&#x27;&quot;

Also according to Anna Jonker, &quot;Swart Fanie&quot; had &quot;a fiery temperament&quot; and once &quot;tore up the documentary proof that the English had commandeered virtually all his mules and wagons during the Anglo-Boer War and hurled them back at an English officer.&quot;

Beatrice Catharina Cilliers (1905–1944), the daughter of &quot;Swart Fanie&quot; and Anna Cilliers, met Abraham Jonker while she was studying music at the University of Stellenbosch and married him in 1930.

After their marriage, Abraham Jonker first worked as a travelling organiser for the National Party before becoming a journalist in Cape Town for such publications as &quot;Burger&quot;, &quot;Die Huisgenoot&quot;, &quot;Jongspan&quot;, and &quot;Suiderstem&quot;. Jonker also obtained a doctorate with honours in Afrikaans literature. He also started his own bilingual magazine, &quot;Die Monitor&quot;, which he sold himself in order to, as he put it, dedicate himself exclusively to journalism and literature.

Abraham Jonker also published books and short story collections during the early 1930s. Louise Viljoen writes, &quot;The critical response to his literary work remained lukewarm, perhaps because of his preference for the European-inspired &quot;Nuwe Saaklikheid&quot; (&quot;Modern Objectivity&quot;) was very different from the confessional mode newly popular in Afrikaans literature at the time. Because of the sombre worldview reflected in his writing, Ingrid Jonker&#x27;s Dutch biographer Henk van Woerden typecast him as a secular Calvinist and described him as an aloof, panic-stricken Puritan.&quot; By his own admission, however, Abraham Jonker had never expected or desired immortality as a writer and always considered his own poetry substandard. Jonker admitted, however, that the greatest influence, even upon his journalistic output, and from who, &quot;I learned that clear simplicity in whatever needs to be said&quot;, was Omar Khayyam, &quot;with whom I first became acquainted at the age of twelve or thirteen and to whose work I always return, even though I have loved a great deal of the world&#x27;s poets since then.&quot;

By 1933, Abraham and Beatrice Jonker were part of a circle of Cape Town intellectuals who &quot;joined the old Cape traditions of discussing cultural, political, and social matters.&quot; Gladstone Louw later described &quot;the writer and journalist Abraham Jonker&quot; as &quot;intelligent, but surly and then already frustrated&quot;. At the same time, however, Abraham and Beatrice Jonker would often perform duets together at social gatherings. Beatrice played the piano, while Abraham performed upon the violin.

There were serious troubles, however, in the Jonkers&#x27; marriage. Ingrid&#x27;s half-brother, Koos Jonker, later recalled, &quot;Beatrice, Ingrid&#x27;s mother, suffered from hallucinations and sometimes acted irrationally – even before she left my father.&quot;

Family friend W.A. de Klerk later recalled, &quot;I would say Ingrid&#x27;s incapacity to find any happiness on a personal level should be seen in terms of her own broken home background. Her father was not an easy man. He often became violent... My wife remembers the evenings very well when Ingrid&#x27;s mother fled the house with Annatije as a small child.&quot;

==Early life==
Ingrid Jonker was born on her maternal grandfather&#x27;s farm near Douglas, Northern Cape, on 19 September 1933. Shortly before her birth, Ingrid&#x27;s mother Beatrice and her older sister Anna had left Abraham H. Jonker&#x27;s house in the Cape Town suburb of Vredehoek, after Abraham Jonker allegedly accused his wife of adultery during an argument and suggested that her unborn daughter was not his child.

Beatrice and Anna Jonker first found refuge at the home of a neighbour, J.A. Smith. Then, mother and daughter left for Beatrice&#x27;s parent&#x27;s farm, known as &quot;Swart Fanie&quot;.

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;A letter survived in which Beatrice firmly rejects Abraham&#x27;s plea that she returns to him.&quot;

Ingrid and Anna&#x27;s childhood was spent on small farms owned by their grandfather.

Ingrid later wrote, &quot;At the time my father was not with the family and my grandfather Fanie Cilliers, a top joke teller, paralyzed and bedridden for 15 years, but the wittiest person I ever knew, ruled the house in his own exuberant way.&quot;

Anna Jonker later claimed about &quot;Swart Fanie&quot;, &quot;He had been paralyzed for many years and during his last years he was completely bedridden. But there, in his large bedroom with doors leading onto the veranda, he entertained his friends until the pipe-smoke hung blue in the air. The loud laughing, the pranks, the stories attracted us children; Ingrid would crawl in behind Oupa&#x27;s back, from where Ouma would come and fetch her when the stories got too rough.&quot;

Anna further recalled, &quot;Ingrid was always Ouma&#x27;s child. Ouma Annie Retief, pretty Annie (Mooi Annie) from Paarl, a fine slender woman with eyes flecked with green, that often sparkled, but could at times look quite stern.&quot;

Jonker&#x27;s grandparents moved to a farm near Durbanville.

Anna later recalled, &quot;It was in Durbanville, I think, that Ingrid was baptised. She was three or four years old and the family was just as upset about that as about the unusual name she was given. Mamma found the name in a book and that was that; as she would always say. Mamma was always being different, the family used to say, and who has heard of a child baptised in a garden? Ingrid wore a pretty white dress and there were cakes, tea and many people. I was so jealous that I hid in the neighbours&#x27; garden and watched it all through the fence.&quot;

As girls Ingrid and Anna were often taken to visit their grandmother&#x27;s wealthy relatives, who owned vineyards in Paarl. Anna later recalled, &quot;We often went to visit the family in Paarl. The oldest people we knew were Ouma&#x27;s mother and aunt, while lived in Hillside in Paarl. We were overwhelmed by the grand house and quite taken aback by the degree of cleanliness expected of us. To us it felt as if we had to wash our hands a hundred times a day, and that just to be given some of the delicious food or at most two or three of the pretty little biscuits. Great-grandmother believed that girls should be little ladies. We sat on pouffes with our little ankles crossed, trying not to laugh at the funny name of the seat, while they solemnly proceeded to establish family ties.&quot;

Anna also recalled of her father, &quot;Abraham came to see us in Durbanville, but it upset my mother so much to see him that Oupa said he must stay away.&quot;

During the same visit, Abraham brought a red top as a gift for Ingrid, but otherwise refused to acknowledge her presence.

According to Anna, &quot;Then the gossip started in Stellenbosch. Ingrid never knew about it.&quot;

Ingrid later wrote, &quot;The house that I do remember, is the one in Durbanville, where we lived until I was about five years old. I will always remember how my laughing grandfather encouraged me to ride faster and faster on my tricycle until I fell off – and my grandmother would come and calm us down. &#x27;Oh, Fanie, is there nothing I can do about your liveliness? Look how you&#x27;re egging the child on. And she&#x27;s already like a little devil.&#x27;&quot;

In 1938, her grandfather Fanie Cilliers died, leaving the four women destitute. Ingrid later recalled, &quot;Then one morning when I woke up, my sister came to me and said, &#x27;Do you know what? Oupa is dead. His room is full of wreaths.&#x27; I heard something about his death years later from Ouma: &#x27;Babs,&#x27; (that was her nickname for me) &#x27;the night your grandfather died, he called me to his bed and said, &#x27;Annie, I love you, because you carried my burdens.&#x27;&quot;

==The Strand and Gordon&#x27;s Bay==
In the aftermath, the family moved to the Strand. Ingrid later recalled, &quot;Those days the Strand was little more than a fishing village. Now I had to go to church and to Sunday school. It didn&#x27;t take me long to learn the nicest hymns by heart. For me these songs contained the structure, rhythm, and mystery of poetry. Inspired by this and by my grandmother&#x27;s loving care, I started writing verses. My first &#x27;poetry&#x27; appeared in the school magazine. I was six then. Ouma recited them to the Coloured community that lived on the outskirts of the Strand, where she used to go and teach them Bible lessons after Sunday school. I still remember how hard it was for me to walk down that long dirt road, holding Ouma&#x27;s hand, her jokes along the way and the glimmer in her deep green eyes when she looked down at me. She could not have been more than five feet tall herself. I would stand to one side of her pulpit in front of the Coloured community, and Ouma and I and the entire congregation would end up in tears as hymn after heart-stirring hymn was sung.&quot;

Anna later recalled, &quot;Ingrid and I didn&#x27;t realize how poor we were. We knew Ouma had to be careful with money, and that her two sons, A.C. Cilliers of the University of Stellenbosch, and uncle Jacob, the attorney from Boksburg, sent her money every month. My father also sent a few pounds every month, and later Ouma got a pension – seventeen pounds a month, I remember. Mama was often ill and stayed in bed for long periods, but on a few occasions she went to work for a few months at a time. Once she worked at the SABC and we teased her because she liked Gideon Roos so much.&quot;

They moved later to Gordon&#x27;s Bay. In 1940, Ingrid began attending kindergarten.

According to Viljoen, &quot;Their mother and grandmother allowed them greater freedom and mobility than was usual for the time. During their stay in Gordon&#x27;s Bay, they often wandered off into a pine forest on their way to school, to sit and read their books. Once they stayed away from school for so long that that their teacher thought that the family had moved again. Here, they were also allowed to keep small animals and continued exploring the veld and beach. They picked fruit from plants in the veld, gathered shellfish from the rock pools, played with tadpoles in the stream behind their house and buried small objects called &#x27;secrets&#x27; in the ground. It is not surprising that Gordon&#x27;s Bay is one of the spaces that would later gain symbolic importance in Ingrid&#x27;s poetry.&quot;

Anna later recalled, &quot;Ingrid and I were playing on the carpet and Mama and Ouma were watching us. Ingrid looked up and I heard Mama say, &#x27;How could he say she isn&#x27;t his child? She has the same broken-hearted look in her eyes.&#x27; Ingrid was about six or seven. She never forgot those words; never spoke about it, but she must have started realising then why she was Ouma&#x27;s heartache child. Many years later, during her breakdown, psychiatrists determined that she was emotionally only seven years old &quot;

A further shadow was cast over this idyllic time by the increasing mental illness of Ingrid&#x27;s mother. While they lived in the flat in Gordon&#x27;s Bay, Beatrice Jonker suffered a mental breakdown. Anna later recalled of her mother, &quot;She went on loving Pa and never spoke ill of him, but she didn&#x27;t want to see him. Once we found her at the window, tugging at a piece of string and repeating over and over, &#x27;There comes Aben. There comes Aben.&#x27; She was taken to Valkenberg and given a sleep cure. All I remember about Ingrid on the day that Mama was suddenly not there anymore were her enormous, frightened eyes. But as usual, Ingrid said nothing, with her everything turned inwards.&quot;

The trauma of this experience affected Ingrid deeply and strengthened her bond with her grandmother, who was the only person with whom she could talk to about it.

Soon after her mental breakdown, Beatrice Jonker was also diagnosed with cancer. Anna Jonker later recalled, &quot;She wanted to join the war effort and she had to see a doctor first. That evening she cried bitterly and Ouma, too. Then Mama did something that upset Ouma very much, but that she couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t stop. Mama went to see the Catholic priests and often went to them to find out more about their religion.&quot; Both Ingrid and Beatrice&#x27;s mother, who had both been raised in the anti-Catholicism that was still deeply ingrained within Afrikaner Calvinism, were devastated and feared that Beatrice, &quot;would go to Hell, like all Roman Catholics.&quot; In response, Ingrid and Annie Cilliers, &quot;prayed and read&quot;, the passages from the Book of Revelation about the Scarlet Woman, whom they believed to represent the Roman Catholic Church.

As Beatrice Jonker lay dying, Ingrid and Anna visited their mother as often as possible. They often shared news with her about boys that they felt unable to discuss with their devout grandmother. After two years in hospital, Beatrice Jonker died of cancer on 6 August 1944.

Ingrid later wrote, &quot;My moeder, sterwend, was so sonnig soos &#x27;n liewenheersbesie, so geheime, so verassend, so teer.&quot; (&quot;My mother, dying, was as sunny as a ladybird, so full of secrets, so surprising, so tender.&quot;)

Anna Jonker later recalled, &quot;The four of us, Ouma, uncle A.C., Ingrid and I, buried Mama. It was raining and there were some other men in black, that Ouma said were undertakers.&quot;

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;Beatrice&#x27;s death brought an end to Ingrid&#x27;s life within the intimacy of the maternal family.&quot;

Anna Jonker later wrote, &quot;Ouma was to take care of us until Pa would fetch us at the end of 1944. To us he was a complete stranger. Before his arrival he had someone ask if there was anything we needed, and we wrote asking for Bibles. Ingrid really wanted a Bible and that, together with the spinning top when she was a baby, were the only presents she received from Pa in her childhood days. Shortly before he was to come and fetch us, I wrote secretly and said we wouldn&#x27;t be able to go, because we should rather stay with Ouma and go to school at Hottentots Holland or somewhere, because we didn&#x27;t have smart enough clothes for the Cape.&quot;

As Anna writes, however, &quot;He came at the end of 1944. We got into the car, and Ingrid wouldn&#x27;t let go of Ouma&#x27;s hand through the open window. She sat at the back and kept looking around at Ouma&#x27;s little black figure at the side of the road. The road was to lead through the grey teen years in the cold house of our stepmother, through the disillusionment of Ingrid&#x27;s adult life.&quot;

==The House in Plumstead==

Until the death of their mother, Anna and Ingrid&#x27;s contact with their father had been minimal. In the years since his divorce from Beatrice, Abraham Jonker had briefly married one Barbara Gill. His third marriage was to Lulu Brewis, an author of children&#x27;s books, in 1941.

Abraham&#x27;s son by Lulu, Adolf Jakobus &quot;Koos&quot; Jonker, recalls, &quot;My mother wasn&#x27;t always easy. When she married my father, she was a spinster of forty-one. She taught for years with a friend – and they went to England together. There they met a new friend, who came to South Africa with them. She wasn&#x27;t fond of children – and my mother herself had a similar strong streak. So we always had White governesses.&quot; He further recalls, &quot;In 1944, when my father went to fetch Anna and Ingrid, the house in Rondebosch became too small for The whole family. They lodged with people for a while...&quot;

Anna elaborates, &quot;Life in the city was not that hard. We lodged with people at Tamboerskloof for a few months and attended Jan van Riebeeck School. Ingrid was in primary school and I was in high school.&quot; From their boarding house, the Jonker girls could walk to their school, which stood on the slopes of Table Mountain.

Every Sunday, Abraham Jonker would pick his daughters up from the boarding house and bring them to spend the day with him, their step-mother Lulu, and the infant Koos. Sometimes, Lulu would join her husband and step-daughters for the evening drive back to Tamboerskloof. During the drive, Anna and Ingrid would lean up against Lulu, who would tell them stories. Anna later recalled, &quot;We were pleased that she liked us and we were quite prepared to accept her as mother. We didn&#x27;t want to call her Mamma, but decided on Mamie, and she understood our attitude.&quot;

Within six months, Abraham purchased a larger house in Plumstead and his daughters moved in with him permanently. Almost immediately, Anna and Ingrid&#x27;s relationship with Lulu changed. Anna later recalled, &quot;One of the first things that Lulu&#x27;s mother said to me was that there were very important guests coming to dinner and that Ingrid and I should eat in the kitchen. We didn&#x27;t mind, because we wouldn&#x27;t have been able to talk politics with the grownups in any case. We were quite happy to eat in the kitchen with the little ones, who at the time were still babies. But then she went up the stairs and said, &#x27;We feel – we feel- you grew up in the back streets. You will put your father to shame at the table.&#x27; Ouma lived until just before Ingrid got married, but we saw very little of her. She was coming to visit us in the big house in Plumstead, for example, shortly after we had gone to live in Cape Town. But then – the night before we were to fetch Ouma – my stepmother said no, we can&#x27;t fetch her, because her mother was also coming to Cape Town and there wouldn&#x27;t be enough space at the table!&quot;

Huibrecht Steenkamp said, &quot;I soon saw that Lulu was just the kind of stepmother I had expected her to be. They were completely deprived, those two children – Ingrid and Anna. Their father was heavily involved in politics at the time. He was a member of parliament and was often away from home. He really led a very busy life.&quot;

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;Although Abraham Jonker has been portrayed as the archetypal Apartheid politician in the minds of those who know of the political tension that existed between him and his daughter, he had a chequered political career. In the election that brought D.F. Malan&#x27;s National Party to power in 1948, he won a seat in Parliament as a member of General Smuts&#x27;s United Party. Together with other dissidents he formed the Conservative Party in 1954, but crossed the floor in 1956 to join the National Party. Many of his contemporaries spoke of him as a political opportunist and a turncoat. Whether Abraham Jonker&#x27;s changing political views were the result of careerism or inner conviction, they would bring him into open confrontation with his daughter.&quot;

According to Anna, however, &quot;Before her marriage Ingrid was a very spiritual and idealistic young girl, without strong political convictions. Because when Pa was Pro-United Party, we all helped to canvass. And the next year, we would canvass again and the people would say, &#x27;Weren&#x27;t you working for a different Party last year?&#x27; It was very embarrassing, you know.&quot;

According to psychologist L.M. van der Merwe, &quot;Anna Jonker points out that their father was happy to have his older daughters at home with him and that he tried his best to minimize the friction between them and their stepmother. But he was often away and the girls soon noticed that their complaints only led to further friction. They started keeping quiet and their father no longer enquired.&quot;

At other times, Abraham was complicit in his wife&#x27;s mistreatment of his daughters. Anna later recalled, &quot;They sat at the head of the table and we sat at the bottom, below the salt. When they had a leg of lamb, we ate mince. They had fruit, but we did not. They had sweets, but that we weren&#x27;t allowed. They would go for Sunday drives, but there wouldn&#x27;t be space for us two in the huge big car.&quot;

Steenkamp describes Ingrid as &quot;totally vulerable&quot; while Anna could &quot;stand her own ground&quot;, being the favourite. Both Anna and Ingrid were used to wandering on their own and always speaking their minds. But, according to their stepmother&#x27;s friend, Ena de Klerk, &quot;Lulu wanted to keep them at home, to protect them and shape them into a religious mold. This caused clashes between her and the girls. It was not so much that she was unfair to them, inherently Lulu Brevis was a good person. Anna and Ingrid were vagabonds, they roamed the beaches from an early age. They knew absolutely nothing about a home life.&quot;

According to Steenkamp, however, &quot;That is the kind of attitude those people had towards the children. They were raised perfectly well, for goodness sake! Their mother raised them, and she came from one of the best families in Paarl! How could they have said the children had grown up in the back streets?&quot;

While living in Plumstead, Ingrid and Anna attended Wynberg Girls&#x27; High School, where teaching was in English rather than Afrikaans. School records reveal Ingrid to have been a well behaved but average student, who preferred to devote herself only to those subjects she liked. Her writing was praised by her teachers and she began writing poetry for the school magazine.

Ingrid later recalled, &quot;By now my poems started appearing in the &quot;Jongspan&quot; and in our school magazines. My head teacher, Miss Currie, indignant about my satiric verses about the school teachers, reprimanded me, placed me in my sister&#x27;s care, washed her hands of me and was the first person to tell me, &#x27;You are undisciplined and disobedient, but my goodness you have talent!&#x27;&quot;

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;Although there was no love lost between the two girls and their stepmother, they had a good relationship with their much younger step- siblings, Koos and Suzanne.&quot;

By 1951, Ingrid wanted to move out. Anna later recalled how she travelled from Johannesburg, where she was working at the time, to help Ingrid obtain permission from their father to leave the house in Plumstead. &quot;We couldn&#x27;t speak to him at the house... so we went for a drive in his car and told him how unhappy we were there. Then he said, &#x27;But it&#x27;s such a nice large home&#x27;, and he got so angry we thought he would kill us. So we said there might be room in the house, but there&#x27;s no room in the heart. Then he agreed that Ingrid could go and live in a room in the city.&quot;

==Poet==
At the age of sixteen, Ingrid Jonker submitted her first collection of poems, &quot;Na die somer&quot; (&quot;After the summer&quot;) to &quot;Nasionale Boekhandel&quot;. After reading the collection, the company&#x27;s reader, D.J. Opperman noted, &quot;This poet is busy tuning her lyre.&quot;

Soon after, Opperman, invited Ingrid to come and discuss her poems with him over tea.

In a letter to N.P. van Wyk Louw, Opperman wrote, &quot;Abr Jonker has a daughter: Ingrid, 16 yrs old,who has some talent. I&#x27;ll be discussing her poems with her on Tuesday. Must be from the first wife? Cilliers &amp; Jonker blood?&quot;

At the time, Opperman lectured in Afrikaans at the University of Cape Town and acted as a selector of poetry anthologies for several publishers. Accordingly, Opperman was one of the foremost South African poets of his time and was a hugely influential figure in Afrikaans literature.

Ingrid, therefore, later recalled, &quot;I knew most his published poems by heart. I was excited and slightly fearful, but I was immediately made to feel at ease by his earnestness and calmness and most of all, the brilliant eyes that didn&#x27;t scoff at me.&quot;

During a genteel conversation over tea, Opperman and Jonker went through the entire book,poem by poem. Ingrid later recalled, &quot;Of course it was turned down, but he gave me very valuable advice. After that I regularly sent him poems and he would comment on them and encourage me.&quot;

On two occasions in 1951, she again sent him poems on which Opperman both commented and urged her to send more.

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;Some of these poems (for instance &quot;Skrik&quot; and &quot;Keuse&quot;) include veiled hints at romantic longing and an awakening sexuality, often reigned in by feelings of religious guilt. It is difficult to reconstruct the inner life of the adolescent Ingrid on the basis of these poems, because the expression of feeling in them is still guarded, hemmed in by schoolgirl decorum and the writerly rhetoric of a previous generation of Afrikaans poets.&quot;

Many of Ingrid&#x27;s close friends would later comment on the fact that she did not have the opportunity to attend university. Some blamed her father for this, while others believe that it was due to the influence of her stepmother, Lulu Jonker. It is known that, after she left her father&#x27;s house in Plumstead, Abraham Jonker paid for Ingrid to take a secretarial course, which enabled her to support herself and become independent.

With her secretarial skills, Ingrid obtained a job working for the Kennis publishing house at the Here XVII Building in downtown Cape Town by late in 1952. She used the money to rent a small apartment above the sea in the suburb of Clifton, which she shared with her close friend, Jean &quot;Bambi&quot; du Preez.

Ingrid&#x27;s real passion, however, was for her vocation as a poet. She later recalled, &quot;I became an office worker, but the real thing I lived for was to write.&quot;

She continued sending her poems to popular magazines like &quot;Die Huisgenoot&quot;, &quot;Naweekpos&quot;, and &quot;Rooi Rose&quot;, as well as the literary journal &quot;Standpunte&quot;. As she did so, her poems became increasingly more sophisticated and polished. She also took lessons in elocution, acting, and in sculpting from her father&#x27;s friend Florencio Cuairan.

According to Louise Viljoen, &quot;It comes as no surprise, when one listens to tape recordings of her reading her own poetry, what impresses one is the clarity of her diction and articulation. Her voice is that of a cultured woman, calm and confident. Although she gave the impression of being vulnerable and defenseless, there must also have been a measure of resilience and determination in her character to have enabled her to overcome the deprivation of her early years and develop artistically and socially after she left her father&#x27;s house.&quot;

In August 1953, she recited poems at the Cape Eisteddfod and received a Diploma for Achievement in Afrikaans.

Her first published book of poems, &quot;Ontvlugting&quot; (&quot;Escape&quot;), was published in 1956. It had originally been submitted to HAUM publishing house on Long Street in Cape Town, but was turned down. The first edition was published instead by Aat Kaptein&#x27;s newly established Culemborg Publishers and printed in the Netherlands. Upon being given a copy and told that it was dedicated to him, Abraham Jonker replied, &quot;My child, I hope its not just a cover; I hope there is something inside as well. Tonight I&#x27;ll have a look at how you&#x27;ve shamed me.&quot;

==Dissident==
Her father, already a writer, editor and National Party Member of Parliament, was appointed chairman of the parliamentary select committee responsible for censorship laws on art, publications and entertainment. To Abraham Jonker&#x27;s embarrassment, his daughter was vehemently opposed to the censorship laws he was charged with enforcing and their political differences became public. With a speech in parliament he disowned her as his daughter.

The depression caused by her father&#x27;s rejection of her forced Ingrid to enter the Valkenberg Psychiatric Hospital in 1961.

Jonker&#x27;s next collection of poems &quot;Rook en oker&quot; (&quot;Smoke and Ochre&quot;) was published in 1963 after delays caused by her publishers. While the anthology was praised by most South African writers, poets and critics, it was given a cool reception by supporters of the ruling Party.

Thereafter, Ingrid Jonker became known as one of the &quot;Die Sestigers&quot;, a group that also included Breyten Breytenbach, André Brink, Adam Small and Bartho Smit, who were challenging the extreme Afrikaner nationalism of the ruling National Party.

&quot;Rook en oker&quot; won Jonker the £1000 &quot;Afrikaanse Pers-Boekhandel&quot; (Afrikaans Press-Booksellers) Literary Award, as well as a scholarship from the Anglo American Corporation. The money helped her to realize her dream of travelling to Europe, where she went to England, the Netherlands, France, Spain and Portugal. She asked Jack Cope to accompany her, but he refused. Jonker then asked André Brink to join her. He accepted and they went to Paris and Barcelona together. During the trip Brink decided against leaving his wife for Jonker and went back to South Africa. Jonker then cut her tour short and returned to Cape Town.

Jonker had started writing a new collection of poems just before her death. A selection of these poems was published posthumously in the collection &quot;Kantelson&quot; (&quot;Toppling Sun&quot;). She then witnessed a shattering event: a black baby was shot by white soldiers and died in his mother&#x27;s arms. She underlined from Dylan Thomas: &quot;after the first death, there is no other&quot;. She wrote &quot;Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)&quot; (&quot;The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)&quot;). This is to be The Whole Truth!

==Personal life==
===Pieter Venter===
Ingrid Jonker met Pieter Venter, her future husband, at a bohemian party held at Sea Point in 1954. Venter, who was 15 years Ingrid&#x27;s senior, worked in Cape Town as the sales manager for a company that took foreign tourists on African safaris. Venter also wrote poetry in English and was a close friend of Afrikaans poet Uys Krige and Breyten Breytenbach.

After Abraham Jonker walked his daughter, who wore a white dress, down the aisle and gave her away, Piet and Ingrid Venter were married inside the Congregational Church in Paarl on 15 December 1956.

Their daughter Simone was born, allegedly with minimal labour pains, on 1 December 1957.

The couple moved to Johannesburg, but three years later they separated. Jonker and her daughter then moved back to Cape Town.

===Other relationships===
During the same time period she had relationships with two writers, Jack Cope and André Brink.

== Death ==
During the night of 19 July 1965, Ingrid Jonker went down to the beach at Three Anchor Bay in Cape Town, walked into the sea, and committed suicide by drowning.

The news of Ingrid&#x27;s death devastated, but didn&#x27;t shock, those who knew her. Jack Cope and Uys Krige were asked to identify the body. Afterwards, Cope wrote in his diary, &quot;Darling I failed you. There is only one irreparable fault – to lack faith, to lose courage, to be smaller than one&#x27;s love – I love you a million times.&quot;

Anna Jonker later recalled, &quot;When I got to Jack that morning, he was sitting at a table, surrounded by all the other writers – friends – and all the hatred was focused on him. They all blamed him.&quot;

André Brink was in Pretoria at the time and went blind for several hours from the shock of hearing the news.

According to Marjorie Wallace, &quot;Abraham Jonker was on a hunting trip when Ingrid died. When he was eventually tracked down, he said, &#x27;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, they can throw her back into the sea.&#x27;&quot;

However, Ingrid&#x27;s half brother, Koos Jonker, insists that there is no truth to this. According to Koos, &quot;My father reportedly made some heartless remark when he heard of Ingrid&#x27;s death. But at the same time I was with him on a hunting trip in the Eastern Cape and I was standing next to him when the farmer&#x27;s son came and told us that Ingrid had drowned. My father was very shocked. He didn&#x27;t say anything except that we should leave immediately. At that stage he was on a very good footing with Ingrid. She often went to visit him in St. James.&quot;

Simone was sent via aeroplane to her father and stepmother in Johannesburg and only learned of her mother&#x27;s death after she arrived.

Psychologist L.M. van der Merwe has written, &quot;Shortly before her death she underlined a verse by Dylan Thomas, &#x27;After the first death, there is no other&#x27; ... Thereby she confirmed that the farewell had taken place long before 19 July 1965. But the physical deed committed that morning makes it very difficult to maintain perspective, to judge the value of her influence, because on that day a legend was born.&quot;

Laurens van der Post later said about Ingrid, &quot;Her suicide to me is almost like the suicide of Afrikanerdom... She was rejected by her father, her people and her lover, even Uys so self-absorbed in his own emotions... I was so horrified... By the dangers of her childlike vulnerability that I wrote to Jack Cope and begged him to come over and fetch her from Europe and offered to pay his fare... But once Jack had her, he just gave her cold pieces of his cold mind in return. He was the only person... who could have saved her. Perhaps he tried, I do not know. I may be unfair...she needed, as we all do, and some of us thank God get, a loving and understanding human heart to take us in.&quot;

Ingrid&#x27;s sister Anna Jonker and her bohemian friends had originally planned a secular funeral, at which Ingrid&#x27;s poems were to be read aloud. Instead, Abraham Jonker, who was outraged by the idea, overruled his daughter Anna and took control of the arrangements. According to the newspapers, Abraham Jonker was determined to keep his daughter&#x27;s funeral from becoming a protest against the regime, but in this Jonker was almost certainly acting under orders from his Party&#x27;s Chief Whip in the South African Parliament. When the funeral took place on 22 July 1965, there was no church service, but a Dutch Reformed minister, Rev. J.L. van Rooyen, officiated at the graveside. Ingrid&#x27;s sister Anna boycotted the funeral in protest against the change to the arrangements. At the funeral, the mourners were divided. On one hand were the Jonker family, their friends, and a group of Special Branch detectives. On the other were Ingrid&#x27;s friends from Cape Town&#x27;s literary bohemia.

According to Marjorie Wallace, Lulu Jonker approached her step-daughter&#x27;s friends and told them that those under banning orders would be arrested if any of Ingrid&#x27;s poem&#x27;s were read aloud, as that would turn the funeral into a political gathering. Jack Cope sobbed uncontrollably and had to be held back from throwing himself toward the coffin as it was lowered into the ground. After the Jonker family left, Ingrid&#x27;s friends threw flowers into the grave. Cope tossed in a wreath of wild olive that he had picked on the slope above Clifton. André Brink chose not to attend the funeral, as he felt it would turn what deserved to be a private event into a public spectacle.

Following her religious funeral, Ingrid&#x27;s friends held a secular funeral for her on 25 July 1965. Before more than a hundred mourners, Uys Krige spoke about Ingrid&#x27;s poetry and Jan Rabie read some of her poems aloud. This time, Ingrid&#x27;s sister Anna attended. Jan le Roux, a high school teacher from Riviersonderend, wished to take his students, who loved Ingrid&#x27;s poetry, to the funeral. After being refused permission to attend by both the school principal and the local Dutch Reformed minister, the pupils held a private prayer service for Ingrid Jonker, at which her poems were read aloud.

After the death of his daughter, Abraham Jonker&#x27;s health went into rapid decline. In October 1965, he disinherited his daughter Anna after she refused to hand Ingrid&#x27;s letters to André Brink over to him. He began drinking alcohol heavily, though doctors had warned that it could kill him. Anna later recalled, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t allowed to drink and he was hardly sober. After Ingrid&#x27;s death he went through hell – he went through absolute hell. It was Christmas and he had thrombosis in his leg... Lulu didn&#x27;t want to allow me to see him, can you believe it?! But a nurse told me later on that Abraham was calling, &#x27;Ingrid! Ingrid!&#x27; He wouldn&#x27;t stop calling her name. Then Lulu said something and my father hit her so hard that she flew right across the ward!&quot;

Abraham Jonker died of an aneurysm in his aorta on 10 January 1966, six months after the suicide of his daughter. After his death, Koos overruled his father&#x27;s will and saw to it that Anna received the inheritance to which she was originally due, as well as their father&#x27;s violin and additional financial support.

Koos Jonker has since said of his father, &quot;My father wasn&#x27;t such a tough customer. In many ways he was quite gentle. Sometimes I wonder how someone who is seemingly so &#x27;bad&#x27; could be elected to Parliament four times. He was well respected, not only by his constituency, but by the general public. I was privileged to have had a father like Abraham Jonker.&quot;

When she was interviewed for a documentary many years later, Simone Venter acknowledged the psychological damage caused since her childhood by her mother&#x27;s suicide. Even so, she conceded, &quot;She wanted to die. It was something she had thought about very deeply. It was her choice.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Copyright and papers===
After Jonker&#x27;s death, copyrights and control of her literary estate and papers were awarded to Jack Cope by the Master of the Court. He established the Ingrid Jonker Trust. He remained a trustee of the Trust until his death in 1991. Jonker&#x27;s daughter Simone Venter is the beneficiary. Copyright is still vested in the Trust.

Jonker&#x27;s literary papers went to the National English Literary Museum (NELM) in Grahamstown. Her sister Anna Jonker borrowed these with the intention of writing a biography on her sister. November 2005.

===Literary legacy===

Jonker&#x27;s poetry has been translated from Afrikaans into English, German, French, Dutch, Polish, Hindi and Zulu, among others. She wrote a one-act play &quot;″n Seun na my Hart&quot; (&quot;A son after my heart&quot;) about a mother&#x27;s illusions about her handicapped son. Jonker also wrote several short stories.

The prestigious Ingrid Jonker Prize for the best debut work of Afrikaans or English poetry was instituted by her friends to honour her legacy after her burial in 1965. This yearly prize, consisting of R10.000 and a medal, is awarded alternately to an Afrikaans or English poet who has published a first volume in the previous two years backed by Dagbreek Uitgewers.

At the opening of the first democratically elected Parliament of South Africa on 24 May 1994, Nelson Mandela praised Jonker&#x27;s role as a critic of Apartheid and suggested that her suicide was an extreme protest against a nation that refused to hear her. Mandela then read Jonker&#x27;s poem, &quot;Die kind (wat doodgeskiet is deur soldate by Nyanga)&quot; (&quot;The child (who was shot dead by soldiers at Nyanga)&quot;) in English translation.

===In popular culture===
In 2001 a documentary about Jonker was produced for Dutch television by Saskia van Schaik: &quot;Korreltjie niks is my dood&quot;.

In 2002 the one-woman, interactive play by Ryk Hattingh, &quot;Opdrag: Ingrid Jonker&quot; (&quot;Assignment: Ingrid Jonker&quot;), was staged at the Grahamstown National Arts Festival starring Jana Cilliers. The play dealt with questions and comments on Jonker&#x27;s life, interwoven with her poems and other writing.

In April 2004 Jonker was posthumously awarded the Order of Ikhamanga by the South African government for &quot;her excellent contribution to literature and a commitment to the struggle for human rights and democracy in South Africa.&quot;

In 2007 a documentary &quot;Ingrid Jonker, her Lives and Time&quot; by Mozambique-born South African film and documentary director Helena Nogueira was released in South Africa. Hailed as the definitive work on Jonker this is the first literary documentary to receive theatrical release in South Africa.

A number of her poems have been set to music over the years, beginning with the song cycle &quot;Vyf liedere&quot; for soprano and piano by Stefans Grové (1981), and sung by such artists as Laurika Rauch, Anneli van Rooyen and Chris Chameleon.

In 2003 ddisselblom, an Afrikaans pop group, released an eponymously titled CD containing the track Falkenburg, a very well executed adaptation of Jonker&#x27;s &quot;Ontvlugting&quot;.

In 2005 Chris Chameleon (known better as the lead singer of the South African band Boo!) released the album &quot;Ek Herhaal Jou&quot; (&quot;I Repeat You&quot;), which consisted of a number of Jonker&#x27;s poems that he had set to music. The release coincided with the 40th anniversary of Jonker&#x27;s death. Some of Jonker&#x27;s poems that inspired Chameleon&#x27;s songs are &quot;Bitterbessie Dagbreek&quot; (&quot;Bitterberry Daybreak&quot;), &quot;Lied van die gebreekte Riete&quot; (&quot;Song of the Broken Reeds&quot;) and &quot;Ontvlugting&quot; (&quot;Escape&quot;).

Also, in 2007 work was already underway on a feature film about Ingrid Jonker with the working title &quot;All that Breaks&quot;. Based on a script by Helena Nogueira workshopped at Johannesburg&#x27;s Market Theatre, the film focusses on three years in the life of Jonker and the &quot;Sestigers&quot; who gathered around poet Uys Krige at Clifton in Cape Town. The film is produced by David Parfitt (&quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot;), Charles Moore (&quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;) and Shan Moodley and is directed by Nogueira.

In 2011, Dutch actress Carice van Houten played Ingrid Jonker in the biographical film &quot;Black Butterflies&quot;, directed by Paula van der Oest. The film also starred Irish actor Liam Cunningham as Jack Cope and Rutger Hauer as Abraham Jonker. Despite being a fully Dutch production about a poet who spoke and wrote in Afrikaans, &quot;Black Butterflies&quot; was filmed entirely in English.

Also in 2011, South African musician Chris Chameleon released an album of Jonker&#x27;s works, entitled &quot;As Jy Weer Skryf&quot; (&quot;If You Write Again&quot;).

In 2012, Nicola Haskins choreographed a dance drama which told the life story of Jonker for the National Arts Festival in Grahamstown and then later to be performed at various venues including the University of Pretoria.

Cape Town has the &quot;Ingrid Jonker Bridge&quot; that crosses over Woodstock, Nelson Mandela Boulevard.

===Biography===
Jonker&#x27;s biographer is Petrovna Metelerkamp, who published &quot;Ingrid Jonker – Beeld van &#x27;n digterslewe&quot; (&quot;Ingrid Jonker – Image of a Poet&#x27;s Life&quot;) in 2003. This book contains new insights into the poet&#x27;s life, and includes love letters (some unsent) and an as yet unpublished account of the night of Jonker&#x27;s death by her friend, Bonnie Davidtsz. Simone, Ingrid&#x27;s daughter received a once off payment. An English, and updated version of this biography appeared in 2012: &quot;Ingrid Jonker – A Poet&#x27;s Life&quot;. The photos and other information came mainly from the Ingrids collection which was sold in 2000 illegally by a family member to Gerrit Komrei where it was kept in Portugal since 2000. Simone has appealed to the heirs for the Komrei heirs for the return of her legacy to South Africa. An Ingrid
Jonker Center will be established in Cape Town under the FAK in collaboration with the Vootrekker Monument. Simone will act as curator of the center.

Alissa Wilkinson of &quot;Vox&quot; praised the staging and direction of the Disney+ taping as well as her performance writing writing that &quot;Goldsberry’s rapid-fire flow as Angelica Schuyler, mixed with her sideways glances and obvious pain in longing for Alexander&quot; are &quot;emotions you can see in the film far better than you can from the back row of the Richard Rodgers Theatre&quot; The following year she had a cameo appearance with her &quot;Hamilton&quot; co-star Phillipa Soo as well as Broadway legends Bernadette Peters, Andre de Shields, Bebe Neuwirth, Chita Rivera, and Joel Grey in the Lin-Manuel Miranda directed biographical musical film &quot;Tick, Tick...

Annie Levin of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote, &quot;Goldsberry, radiant with health, flies about the stage singing and dancing, wins a great victory over her enemies and has her dukedom returned to her. She does not pretend to be the elderly Prospero&quot;. She added &quot;this very Disney production lacks that kind of subtlety, as does Goldsberry’s delivery.&quot; In 2024, she debuted the documentary, &quot;Satisfied&quot;, about her life and career.

<text>David Louis Goodstein (April 5, 1939 – April 10, 2024) was an American physicist and educator. From 1988 to 2007 he served as Vice-provost of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he was also a professor of physics and applied physics, as well as (since 1995) the Frank J. Gilloon Distinguished Teaching and Service Professor.

==Life and work==
David Louis Goodstein was born on April 5, 1939. He was educated at Brooklyn College (BS, 1960) and at the University of Washington (Ph.D., 1965). He wrote several books, including &quot;States of Matter&quot; (1975) (reprinted in a Dover paperback edition) and &quot;Feynman’s Lost Lecture&quot; (1996). In the 1980s he was the director and host of &quot;The Mechanical Universe&quot;, an educational television series on physics that was adapted for high school use and translated into many other languages. The series has been broadcast on hundreds of public broadcasting stations and has garnered more than a dozen prestigious awards, including the 1987 Japan Prize for television.

In his later age, while continuing to teach and conduct research in experimental condensed matter physics, he turned his attention to issues related to science and society. In articles and speeches, he addressed conduct and misconduct in science, and issues related to fossil fuels and the climate of Planet Earth. In 2004 he published a best-selling book &quot;Out of Gas: The End of the Age of Oil&quot;.

In 1999, Goodstein was awarded the Oersted Medal of the American Association of Physics Teachers, and in 2000, the John P. McGovern Medal of the Sigma Xi Society. He served on and chaired numerous scientific and academic panels, including the National Advisory Committee to the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of the National Science Foundation. He was a founding member of the board of directors of the California Council on Science and Technology.

In 2015 he published &quot;Thermal Physics: Energy and Entropy&quot;. Goodstein died in Pasadena, California on April 10, 2024, five days after his 85th birthday.

<text>The River Ouzel , also known as the River Lovat, is a river in England, and a tributary of the River Great Ouse. It rises in the Chiltern Hills and flows north to join the Ouse at Newport Pagnell.

It is usually called the &quot;River Ouzel&quot;, except near Newport Pagnell where both names are used. The name &quot;Lovat&quot; was recorded (in the form &#x27;Lovente&#x27;) in the thirteenth century, a map of 1724 marks the river as &quot;Lowsel R&quot;, and a map surveyed in 1765 shows it as &#x27;Ouzel River&#x27;. The modern Ordnance Survey uses only the name &quot;Ouzel&quot;, except north of Willen Lake where it is marked as &#x27;River Ouzel or Lovat&#x27;.

==Course==
From springs just north of Dagnall, the river initially forms the boundary between Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire. It is joined by the Ouzel Brook from Houghton Regis, and by Whistle Brook (also known at Ivinghoe as &quot;Whizzle Brook&quot;) from Pitstone. Near Grove Lock, just south of Leighton Buzzard, it was once joined by Ledburn Brook, which has since been diverted into the Grand Junction Canal (now the Grand Union Canal). At Leighton Buzzard, the river is joined by Clipstone Brook from Milton Bryan via Hockliffe and Clipstone, and to the north of the town the excess water from the canal is released into the river at the Twelve Arches. The river then flows through Milton Keynes, where the flood risk it presents (both locally and to communities downstream on the Ouse) is managed by two large balancing lakes, Caldecotte Lake and Willen Lake. After flowing east under the M1, the river is joined by Crawley Brook from Husborne Crawley. Finally, the river flows through Newport Pagnell to its junction with the Great Ouse.

<text>Justyna Mospinek (born 8 November 1983 in Zgierz) is an athlete from Poland who competes in archery.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Mospinek represented Poland at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She placed 7th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 657. In the first round of elimination, she faced 58th-ranked Maydenia Sarduy of Cuba. Mospinek defeated Sarduy 162–145 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced Viktoriya Beloslydtseva of Kazakhstan. Mospinek won the match 163–155 in the regulation 18 arrows, advancing to the round of 16. Mospinek then lost to 10th-ranked Wu Hui Ju of Chinese Taipei (Taiwan) 160–151, finishing 14th in women&#x27;s individual archery. Mospinek was also a member of the 15th-place Polish women&#x27;s archery team.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Mospinek finished her ranking round with a total of 643 points. This gave her the 19th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Sayoko Kitabutake in the first round. Despite Kitabutake being only the 46th seed, she managed to upset Mospinek with a 103–101 win. Together with Małgorzata Ćwienczek and Iwona Marcinkiewicz, Mospinek also took part in the team event. With her 643 score from the ranking round combined with the 645 of Ćwienczek and the 620 of Marcinkiewicz the Polish team was in fourth position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter-final. There they were beaten by the French team with 218–211. The French eventually won the bronze medal.

<doc id="916132" wikidata="Q1218180" url="?curid=916132" title="Nikon">
<text>(, ; ) is a Japanese optics and photographic equipment manufacturer. Nikon&#x27;s products include cameras, camera lenses, binoculars, microscopes, ophthalmic lenses, measurement instruments, rifle scopes, spotting scopes, and equipment related to semiconductor fabrication, such as steppers used in the photolithography steps of such manufacturing. Nikon is the world&#x27;s second largest manufacturer of such equipment.

Since July 2024, Nikon has been headquartered in Nishi-Ōi, Shinagawa, Tokyo where the plant has been located since 1918. 

The company is the eighth-largest chip equipment maker as reported in 2017. Also, it has diversified into new areas like 3D printing and regenerative medicine to compensate for the shrinking digital camera market.

Among Nikon&#x27;s many notable product lines are Nikkor imaging lenses (for F-mount cameras, large format photography, photographic enlargers, and other applications), the Nikon F-series of 35 mm film SLR cameras, the Nikon D-series of digital SLR cameras, the Nikon Z-series of digital mirrorless cameras, the Coolpix series of compact digital cameras, and the Nikonos series of underwater film cameras. 

Nikon&#x27;s main competitors in camera and lens manufacturing include Canon, Sony, Fujifilm, Panasonic, Pentax, and Olympus.

Founded on July 25, 1917 as &quot;Nippon Kōgaku Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha&quot; ( &quot;Japan Optical Industries Co., Ltd.&quot;), the company was renamed to Nikon Corporation, after its cameras, in 1988. Nikon is a member of the Mitsubishi group of companies (&quot;keiretsu&quot;).

On March 7, 2024, Nikon announced its acquisition of Red Digital Cinema.

==History==
The Nikon Corporation was established on 25 July 1917 when three leading optical manufacturers merged to form a comprehensive, fully integrated optical company known as Nippon Kōgaku Tōkyō K.K. Over the next sixty years, this growing company became a manufacturer of optical lenses (including those for the first Canon cameras) and equipment used in cameras, binoculars, microscopes and inspection equipment. 

During World War II the company operated thirty factories with 2,000 employees, manufacturing binoculars, lenses, bomb sights, and periscopes for the Japanese military.

===Reception outside Japan===
After the war Nippon Kōgaku reverted to producing its civilian product range in a single factory. In 1948, the first Nikon-branded camera was released, the Nikon I. Nikon lenses were popularised by the American photojournalist David Douglas Duncan. 

Duncan was working in Tokyo when the Korean War began. Duncan had met a young Japanese photographer, Jun Miki, who introduced Duncan to Nikon lenses. From July 1950 to January 1951, Duncan covered the Korean War. Fitting Nikon optics (especially the NIKKOR-P.C 1:2 f=8,5 cm) to his Leica rangefinder cameras allowed him to produce high contrast negatives with very sharp resolution at the centre field.

===Names and brands===

Founded in 1917 as &quot;Nippon Kōgaku Kōgyō Kabushikigaisha&quot; ( &quot;Japan Optical Industries Corporation&quot;), the company was renamed &quot;Nikon Corporation&quot;, after its cameras, in 1988. The name &quot;Nikon&quot;, which dates from 1946, was originally intended only for its small-camera line, spelled as &quot;Nikkon&quot;, with an addition of the &quot;n&quot; to the &quot;Nikko&quot; brand name. The similarity to the Carl Zeiss AG brand &quot;ikon&quot;, would cause some early problems in Germany as Zeiss complained that Nikon violated its trademarked camera. From 1963 to 1968 the Nikon F in particular was therefore labeled &#x27;Nikkor&#x27;.

The &quot;Nikkor&quot; brand was introduced in 1932, a westernised rendering of an earlier version &quot;Nikkō&quot; (), an abbreviation of the company&#x27;s original full name (&quot;Nikkō&quot; also means &quot;sunlight&quot; and is the name of a famous Japanese onsen town.). &quot;Nikkor&quot; is the Nikon brand name for its lenses.

Another early brand used on microscopes was &quot;Joico&quot;, an abbreviation of &quot;Japan Optical Industries Co&quot;. Expeed is the brand Nikon uses for its image processors since 2007.

===Rise of the Nikon F series===

The Nikon SP and other 1950s and 1960s rangefinder cameras competed directly with models from Leica and Zeiss. However, the company quickly ceased developing its rangefinder line to focus its efforts on the Nikon F single-lens reflex line of cameras, which was successful upon its introduction in 1959. 

For nearly 30 years, Nikon&#x27;s F-series SLRs were the most widely used small-format cameras among professional photographers, as well as by some U.S. space program, the first in 1971 on Apollo 15 (as lighter and smaller alternative to the Hasselblad, used in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs, 12 of which are still on the Moon) and later once in 1973 on the Skylab and later again on it in 1981.

Nikon popularized many features in professional SLR photography, such as the modular camera system with interchangeable lenses, viewfinders, motor drives, and data backs; integrated light metering and lens indexing; electronic strobe flashguns instead of expendable flashbulbs; electronic shutter control; evaluative multi-zone &quot;matrix&quot; metering; and built-in motorized film advance. However, as auto focus SLRs became available from Minolta and others in the mid-1980s, Nikon&#x27;s line of manual-focus cameras began to seem out of date.

Despite introducing one of the first autofocus models, the slow and bulky F3AF, the company&#x27;s determination to maintain lens compatibility with its F-mount prevented rapid advances in autofocus technology. Canon introduced a new type of lens-camera interface with its entirely electronic Canon EOS cameras and Canon EF lens mount in 1987. 

The much faster lens performance permitted by Canon&#x27;s electronic focusing and aperture control prompted many professional photographers (especially in sports and news) to switch to the Canon system through the 1990s.

==== Post-millennium film camera production ====
Once Nikon introduced affordable consumer-level DSLRs such as the Nikon D70 in the mid-2000s, sales of its consumer and professional film cameras fell rapidly, following the general trend in the industry. In January 2006, Nikon announced it would stop making most of its film camera models and all of its large format lenses, and focus on digital models.

Nevertheless, Nikon remained the only major camera manufacturer still making film SLR cameras for a long time. The high-end Nikon F6 and the entry-level FM10 remained in production all the way up until October 2020.

=== Digital photography ===

==== Digital single-lens reflex and point and shoot cameras ====

Nikon created some of the first digital SLRs (DSLRs, Nikon NASA F4) for NASA, used in the Space Shuttle since 1991. After a 1990s partnership with Kodak to produce digital SLR cameras based on existing Nikon film bodies, Nikon released the Nikon D1 SLR under its own name in 1999. Although it used an APS-C-size light sensor only 2/3 the size of a 35 mm film frame (later called a &quot;DX sensor&quot;), the D1 was among the first digital cameras to have sufficient image quality and a low enough price for some professionals (particularly photojournalists and sports photographers) to use it as a replacement for a film SLR. The company also has a Coolpix line which grew as consumer digital photography became increasingly prevalent through the early 2000s. Nikon also never made any phones.

Through the mid-2000s, Nikon&#x27;s line of professional and enthusiast DSLRs and lenses including their back compatible AF-S lens line remained in second place behind Canon in SLR camera sales, and Canon had several years&#x27; lead in producing professional DSLRs with light sensors as large as traditional 35 mm film frames. All Nikon DSLRs from 1999 to 2007, by contrast, used the smaller DX size sensor.

Then, 2005 management changes at Nikon led to new camera designs such as the full-frame Nikon D3 in late 2007, the Nikon D700 a few months later, and mid-range SLRs. Nikon regained much of its reputation among professional and amateur enthusiast photographers as a leading innovator in the field, especially because of the speed, ergonomics, and low-light performance of its latest models. The mid-range Nikon D90, introduced in 2008, was also the first SLR camera to record video. Since then video mode has been introduced to many more of the Nikon and non-Nikon DSLR cameras including the Nikon D3S, Nikon D3100, Nikon D3200, Nikon D5100, and Nikon D7000. 

More recently, Nikon has released a photograph and video editing suite called ViewNX to browse, edit, merge and share images and videos. Despite the market growth of Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras, Nikon did not neglect their F-mount Single Lens Reflex cameras and have released some professional DSLRs like the D780, or the D6 in 2020. 

==== Mirrorless interchangeable-lens cameras ====
In reaction to the growing market for Mirrorless cameras, Nikon released their first Mirrorless Interchangeable Lens Cameras and also a new lens mount in 2011. The lens mount was called Nikon 1, and the first bodies in it were the Nikon 1 J1 and the V1. The system was built around a 1 inch (or CX) format image sensor, with a 2.7x crop factor. This format was pretty small compared to their competitors. This resulted in a loss of image quality, dynamic range and fewer possibilities for restricting depth of field depth of field range. In 2018, Nikon officially discontinued the 1 series, after three years without a new camera body. (The last one was the Nikon 1 J5).

Also in 2018, Nikon introduced a new mirrorless system in their lineup: the Nikon Z system. The first cameras in the series were the Z 6 and the Z 7, both with a Full Frame (FX) sensor format, In-Body Image Stabilization and a built-in electronic viewfinder. The Z-mount is not only for FX cameras though, as in 2019 Nikon introduced the Z 50 with a DX format sensor, without IBIS but with the compatibility to every Z-mount lens. The handling, the ergonomics and the button layout are similar to the Nikon DSLR cameras, which is friendly for those who are switching from them. This shows that Nikon is putting their focus more on their MILC line.

In 2020 Nikon updated both the Z 6 and the Z 7. The updated models are called the Z 6 II and the Z 7 II. The improvements over the original models include the new EXPEED 6 processor, an added card slot, improved video and AF features, higher burst rates, battery grip support and USB-C power delivery.

In 2021, Nikon released 2 mirrorless cameras, the Z fc and the Z 9. The Nikon Z fc is the second Z-series APS-C (DX) mirrorless camera in the line up, designed to evoke the company&#x27;s famous FM2 SLR from the &#x27;80s. It offers manual controls, including dedicated dials for shutter speed, exposure compensation and ISO. The Z 9 became Nikon&#x27;s new flagship product succeeding the D6, marking the start of a new era of Nikon cameras. It includes a 46 megapixel Full Frame (FX) format stacked CMOS sensor which is stabilized and has a very fast readout speed, making the mechanical shutter not only unneeded, but also absent from the camera. Along with the sensor, the 3.7 million dot, 760 nit EVF, the 30 fps continuous burst at full resolution with a buffer of 1000+ compressed raw photos, 4K 120 fps ProRes internal recording, the 8K 30 fps internal recording and the 120 hz subject recognition AF system make it one of the most advanced cameras on the market with its main rivals being the Canon EOS R3 and the Sony α1. (As of February 2022)

==== Mirrorless fixed-lens cameras, the cancelled release of DL series ====
Before the introduction of the Z-series, on February 23, 2016 Nikon announced its DL range of fixed-lens compact cameras. The series comprised three 20 megapixel 1&quot;-type CMOS sensor cameras with Expeed 6A image processing engines: DL18-50 f/1.8-2.8, DL24-85 f/1.8-2.8 black and silver and DL24-500 f/2.8-5.6. Nikon described the range as a premium line of compact cameras, which combines the high performance of Nikkor lenses with always-on smart device connectivity. All three cameras were showcased at CP+ 2016. One year after the initial announcement, on February 13, 2017, Nikon officially cancelled the release and sale of DL-series, which was originally planned for a June 2016 release. They cited design issues (with the integrated circuit for image processing) and profitability as main issues causing the cancellation.

===Movie camera production===
Although few models were introduced, Nikon made movie cameras as well. The R10 and R8 SUPER ZOOM Super 8 models (introduced in 1973) were the top of the line and last attempt for the amateur movie field. The cameras had a special gate and claw system to improve image steadiness and overcome a major drawback of Super 8 cartridge design. The R10 model has a high speed 10X macro zoom lens.

Contrary to other brands, Nikon never attempted to offer projectors or their accessories.

===Thai operations===
Nikon has shifted much of its manufacturing facilities to Thailand, with some production (especially of Coolpix cameras and some low-end lenses) in Indonesia. The company constructed a factory in Ayuthaya north of Bangkok in Thailand in 1991. By 2000, it had 2,000 employees. Steady growth over the next few years and an increase of floor space from the original 19,400 square meters (209,000 square feet) to 46,200 square meters (497,000 square feet) enabled the factory to produce a wider range of Nikon products. By 2004, it had more than 8,000 workers.

The range of the products produced at Nikon Thailand include plastic molding, optical parts, painting, printing, metal processing, plating, spherical lens process, aspherical lens process, prism process, electrical and electronic mounting process, silent wave motor and autofocus unit production.

As of 2009, all of Nikon&#x27;s Nikon DX format DSLR cameras and the D600, a FX camera, are produced in Thailand, while their professional and semi-professional Nikon FX format (full frame) cameras (D700, D3, D3S, D3X, D4, D800 and the retro-styled Df) are built in Japan, in the city of Sendai. The Thai facility also produces most of Nikon&#x27;s digital &quot;DX&quot; zoom lenses, as well as numerous other lenses in the Nikkor line.

===Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd.===
In 1999, Nikon and Essilor have signed a Memorandum of understanding to form a global strategic alliance in corrective lenses by forming a 50/50 joint venture in Japan to be called Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd.

The main purpose of the joint venture is to further strengthen the corrective lens business of both companies.
This will be achieved through the integrated strengths of Nikon&#x27;s strong brand backed up by advanced optical technology and strong sales network in Japanese market, coupled with the high productivity and worldwide marketing and sales network of Essilor, the world leader in this industry.

Nikon-Essilor Co. Ltd. started its business in January 2000, responsible for research, development, production and sales mainly for ophthalmic optics.

==Recent development==
Revenue from Nikon&#x27;s camera business has dropped 30% in three years prior to fiscal 2015. In 2013, it forecast the first drop in sales from interchangeable lens cameras since Nikon&#x27;s first digital SLR in 1999. The company&#x27;s net profit has fallen from a peak of 75.4 billion (fiscal 2007) to 18.2 billion for fiscal 2015. Nikon plans to reassign over 1,500 employees resulting in job cuts of 1,000, mainly in semiconductor lithography and camera business, by 2017 as the company shifts focus to medical and industrial devices business for growth.

In March 2024, it was announced Nikon had acquired the American camera manufacturer specializing in digital cinematography, Red Digital Cinema.

==Film cameras==
In January 2006, Nikon announced the discontinuation of all but two models of its film cameras, focusing its efforts on the digital camera market. It continues to sell the fully manual FM10, and still offers the high-end fully automatic F6. Nikon has also committed to service all the film cameras for a period of ten years after production ceases.

===Compact cameras===
Between 1983 and the early 2000s a broad range of compact cameras were made by Nikon. Nikon first started by naming the cameras with a series name (like the L35/L135-series, the RF/RD-series, the W35-series, the EF or the AW-series). In later production cycles, the cameras were double branded with a series-name on the one and a sales name on the other hand. Sales names were for example &quot;Zoom-Touch&quot; for cameras with a wide zoom range, &quot;Lite-Touch&quot; for ultra compact models, &quot;Fun-Touch&quot; for easy to use cameras and &quot;Sport-Touch&quot; for splash water resistance. After the late 1990s, Nikon dropped the series names and continued only with the sales name. Nikon&#x27;s APS-cameras were all named &quot;Nuvis&quot;.

The cameras came in all price ranges from entry-level fixed-lens-cameras to the top model Nikon 35Ti and 28Ti with titanium body and 3D-Matrix-Metering.

===Lenses for Nikon Z-mount===

Nikon introduced the Z-mount in 2018 for their system of digital full-frame and APS-C (DX) mirrorless cameras.

===Lenses for F-mount cameras===
The Nikon F-mount is a type of interchangeable lens mount developed by Nikon for its 35 mm Single-lens reflex cameras. The F-mount was first introduced on the Nikon F camera in 1959.
*See Nikon F-mount → Nikkor

===Other lenses for photography and imaging===

==Electronic flash units==

Nikon uses the term &quot;Speedlight&quot; for its electronic flashes. Recent models include the SB-R200, SB-300, SB-400, SB-600, SB-700, SB-800, SB-900, SB-910, SB-5000 and R1C1.

==Film scanners==

Nikon&#x27;s digital capture line also includes a successful range of dedicated scanners for a variety of formats, including Advanced Photo System (IX240), 35 mm, and 60 mm film.
* (1988) LS-3500 (4096x6144, 4000 dpi, 30 bits per pixel) HP-IB (requires a third-party NuBus card; intended for Mac platforms, for which there is a Photoshop plug-in).
* (1992) Coolscan LS-10 (2700 dpi) SCSI. First to be named &quot;Coolscan&quot; to denote LED illumination.
* (1994) LS-3510AF (4096x6144, 4000 dpi, 30 bits per pixel) Auto-focus SCSI (usually employed on Mac platforms with a Photoshop plug-in; TWAIN is available for PC platforms).
* (1995) LS-4500AF (4 x 5 inch and 120/220 formats, 1000x2000 dpi, 35mm format 3000x3000). 12bit A/D. SCSI. Fitted with auto-focus lens.

* (2003) Coolscan V LS-50 ED (4000 dpi, 14-bit, 4.2D) USB
* (2003) Super Coolscan LS-5000 ED (4000 dpi, 16bit, 4.8D) USB
* (2004) Super Coolscan LS-9000 ED (4000 dpi, 16bit, 4.8D) Firewire, multiformat

Nikon introduced its first scanner, the Nikon LS-3500 with a maximum resolution of 4096 x 6144 pixels, in 1988. Prior to the development of &#x27;cool&#x27; LED lighting this scanner used a halogen lamp (hence the name &#x27;Coolscan&#x27; for the following models). The resolution of the following LED based Coolscan model didn&#x27;t increase but the price was significantly lower. Colour depth, scan quality, imaging and hardware functionality as well as scanning speed was gradually improved with each following model. The final &#x27;top of the line&#x27; 35mm Coolscan LS-5000 ED was a device capable of archiving greater numbers of slides; 50 framed slides or 40 images on film roll. It could scan all these in one batch using special adapters. A single maximum resolution scan was performed in no more than 20 seconds as long as no post-processing was also performed. With the launch of the Coolscan 9000 ED Nikon introduced its most up-to-date film scanner which, like the Minolta DiMAGE scanners were the only film scanners that, due to a special version of Digital ICE, were able to scan Kodachrome film reliably both dust and scratch free. In late 2007 much of the software&#x27;s code had to be rewritten to make it Mac OS 10.5 compatible. Nikon announced it would discontinue supporting its Nikon Scan software for the Macintosh as well as for Windows Vista 64-bit. Third-party software solutions like SilverFast or Vuescan provide alternatives to the official Nikon drivers and scanning software, and maintain updated drivers for most current operating systems. Between 1994 and 1996 Nikon developed three flatbed scanner models named Scantouch, which couldn&#x27;t keep up with competitive flatbed products and were hence discontinued to allow Nikon to focus on its dedicated film scanners.

==Nikon Metrology==
===Overview===
Nikon Metrology, a division of Nikon, produces hardware and software products for 2D &amp; 3D measurement from nano to large scale measurement volumes. Products include Optical Laser Probes, X-ray computed tomography, Coordinate-measuring machine (CMM), Laser Radar Systems (LR), Microscopes, Portable CMMs, Large Volume Metrology, Motion Measurement and Adaptive Robotic Controls, Semiconductor Systems, Metrology Software including CMM-Manager, CAMIO Studio, Inspect-X, Focus, and Automeasure. Measurements are performed using tactile and non-contact probes, measurement data is collected in software and processed for comparison to nominal CAD (Computer-aided design) or part specification or for recreating / reverse engineering physical work pieces.

===Origins===
The origins of Nikon go back to 1917 when three Japanese optical manufacturers joined to form Nippon Kogaku KK (&#x27;Japan Optics&#x27;). In 1925 the microscope having revolving nosepiece and interchangeable objectives was produced. Significant growth for the microscopy division occurs over the next 50 years as Nikon pioneers development of polarising and stereo microscopes along with new products for measuring and inspection (Metrology) markets. These new products include devices targeted for industrial use such as optical comparators, autocollimators, profile projector and automated vision based systems. Continued effort through the next three decades yield the release of products including the Optiphot and Labophot microscopes, Diaphot microscope, the Eclipse range of infinity optics, and finally the DS camera series and the Coolscope with the advent of digital sensors. With the acquisition of Metris in 2009 the Nikon Metrology division was born. Nikon Metrology products include a full range of both 2D &amp; 3D, optical, tactile, non-contact, and X-Ray Metrology solutions ranging from nanometer resolution on microscopic samples to μm resolution in volumes large enough to house a commercial airliner.

== Lithography equipment ==
===Overview===
Nikon manufactures scanners and steppers for the manufacture of integrated circuits and flat panel displays, and semiconductor device inspection equipment. The steppers and scanners represent about one third of the income for the company as of 2008. 

Nikon developed the first lithography equipment from Japan. The equipment from Nikon enjoyed high demand from global chipmakers, the Japanese semiconductor companies and other major companies such as Intel, and Nikon was the world&#x27;s leading producer of semiconductor lithography systems from the 1980s to 2002. Nikon saw a sharp drop in its market share from less than 40 percent in early 2000s to no more than 20 percent as of 2013. The company has been losing an estimated 17 billion a year in its precision instruments unit.

In contrast, ASML, a Dutch company, has grabbed over 80 percent of the lithography systems market as of 2015 by adopting an open innovation method of product development, which includes the acquisition of US-based light source manufacturer Cymer. In 2017, Nikon announced that it would cut nearly 1,000 jobs mainly in the lithography systems business and halt its development of next-generation equipment.

===Legal disputes===
In February 2019, Nikon, ASML and Carl Zeiss AG, a leading supplier to ASML, have entered into a definitive settlement and cross-license agreement relating to multiple disputes over patents for lithography equipment that had been underway since 2001 and agreed to drop all the world-wide lawsuits regarding the issue.

By the latest settlement, ASML and Zeiss paid approximately $170 million to Nikon. The two companies had paid a total of $87 million to Nikon in 2004 for similar legal dispute.

=== Market position and products ===
As of February 2018, Nikon held 10.3 percent revenue share in the semiconductor lithography market while the share of ASML was over 80 percent.

As of 2019, Nikon develops and sells the following lithography-related equipment:

*Cutting-edge flat panel display lithography equipment (The FX series)
*i-line steppers
*KrF steppers
*ArF steppers
*ArF immersion steppers
*Inspection and alignment equipment

==Other products==
Nikon also manufactures eyeglasses, sunglasses, and glasses frames, under the brands Nikon, Niji, Nobili-Ti, Presio, and Velociti VTI. Other Nikon&#x27;s products include ophthalmic equipment, loupes, monoculars, binocular telescopes, metal 3D printers, material processing equipment, regenerative medicine contract manufacturing, cell sorting equipment, and cell culture observation systems.

Nikon no longer manufactures its own image sensors as it outsources the manufacturing to Sony.

Since 2019, Sendai Nikon, a Nikon group company, manufactures Lidar sensors for Velodyne as part of a partnership between the two companies.

==Sponsorship==
===Awards and exhibitions===

In Japan, Nikon runs the Nikon Salon exhibition spaces, the Nikkor Club for amateur photographers (to whom it distributes the series of Nikon Salon books), the Nikon Small World Photomicrography Competition and the Nikon Small World in Motion Competition, and arranges the Ina Nobuo Award, Miki Jun Award and Miki Jun Inspiration Awards.

===Others===
As of November 19, 2013, Nikon is the &quot;Official Camera&quot; of Walt Disney World Resort and Disneyland Resort.

Nikon is the official co-sponsor of Galatasaray SK Football Team.

In 2014 Nikon sponsored the Copa Sadia do Brasil 2014 and the AFC Champions League.

The company sponsors the Nikon-Walkley Press Photographer of the Year award, as well as the Nikon Photography Prizes, which are administered by the Walkley Foundation in Australia.

<text>The Nikon FM3A is an interchangeable-lens, focal-plane shutter, 35 mm film, single-lens reflex (SLR) camera. It was manufactured by Nikon Corporation in Japan, on small-volume assembly lines, from 2001 to 2006. The camera was available in two colours: all black and satin chrome. The introductory US list price for the chrome body only (no lens) was $820.

The FM3A was the successor to the renowned Nikon FM2N camera of 1984 and was the last member of the successful, semi-professional line of Nikon compact 35 mm film SLRs. The other members were the Nikon FM (released 1977), FE (1978), FM2 (1982) and FE2 (1983). They (and the Nikon FA) all used the superficially similar (but not identical) rugged copper-aluminium alloy chassis and high-quality Nikon vertical bearing-mounted metal shutter and ball-bearing mounted film advance, but with improved feature levels, minor external controls and cosmetic differences. The newer low-budget Nikon FM10 and FE10, while named similarly, are completely different introductory-level cameras manufactured by Cosina.

The major improvements in the FM3A compared to the FM2n are the hybrid electro-mechanically controlled aluminium-bladed focal plane shutter, the aperture priority auto-exposure mode, the match-needle exposure control system and provision for through-the-lens (TTL) off-the-film (OTF) electronic flash automation. In other words, the FM3A merged the robust mechanical systems of the FM2n with the proven, reliable electronic exposure controls of the FE2.

== Features ==
The FM3A is built to a high level of workmanship and material quality. It shares the advantages of the FM and the FM2n, both generally regarded as two of the most reliable cameras ever built (both in terms of operation under extreme conditions and in day-to-day reliability reports from repair shops and magazine surveys). It has an extremely strong body of copper silumin alloy. The electronics are well protected within the body and of extremely high quality, including the flexible circuits. The FM3A&#x27;S film transport consists of high-strength hardened metal gears and moving parts, mounted on clusters of ball bearings. The vertical metal shutter utilises precision tapered high-strength aluminium alloy blades and oilless self-lubricating bearings. The guide rails are made of stainless steel. The mirror is made of titanium. It is large to reduce chances of vignetting with super-telephotos of up to 800 mm, and uses the same mechanism found on Nikon&#x27;s pro F2, with some improvements designed to further reduce effects of vibration and mirror bounce.

The FM3A accepts all of the Nikkor lenses with the Nikon F bayonet mount that support the Automatic Indexing (AI) feature (AI, AIS), first introduced in 1977. The chrome FM3A was often sold in a kit that includes a color coordinated chrome finished Nikkor 45 mm f/2.8P lens. This special flat &quot;pancake&quot; lens was manually focused on the FM3A, but contained a CPU which could communicate focal distance to Nikon&#x27;s later autofocus (AF) camera bodies.

Other accessories for the FM3A include the Nikon MD-12 motor drive (automatic film advance up to 3.2 frames per second), as well as the Nikon MF-16 databack (sequential numbering, time or date stamping on the film), and the various compatible Nikon TTL flashes (SB-15, SB-16b, SB-20, etc.)

In manual mode, the camera is completely mechanical in operation, and only requires batteries for the light metering information system. In aperture priority mode, the batteries continued to power the meter, but are also utilized for shutter timing and the exposure control electronics. The FM3A&#x27;s metering information system consisted of a match-needle system using two needles pointing along a vertical shutter speed scale on the left side of the viewfinder to indicate the readings of the built-in 60/40% centerweighted silicon photodiode light meter versus the actual camera settings. This system can be traced back to the Nikkormat EL (Nikomat EL in Japan) of 1972. The viewfinder also has Nikon&#x27;s fully interchangeable bright focus screen with various options for focus.

== Design history ==
During the mid-1990s, a demand arose among some photographers for a quality manual-focus alternative to the 35 mm autofocus SLR camera. These cameras required complex computer and processing mechanisms, and especially in their amateur and consumer versions, were known for neither their ruggedness nor a long service life. Nikon owners began to demand a durable, precision-made camera with the AE electronic features and prized construction of the discontinued Nikon FE2, which had begun to skyrocket in value on the secondhand market. Nikon responded to this phenomenon with a revival of their classic FM/FE series design.

The FM3A&#x27;s expensive construction and conservative design were not intended to appeal to the consumer-level market. Nikon instead marketed the camera to serious amateur and professional photographers who were desirous of the highest possible quality and precision of control, and a service life estimated not in years, but decades.

The FM3A&#x27;s introduction coincided with a major technological revolution in photographic technology – digital imaging. Many photographers, professional and amateur alike, switched to digital, resulting in a huge decrease in film SLR sales. By 2004, annual sales of digital cameras had surpassed those of film cameras. Though FM3A sales remained steady, they were minuscule in volume compared to Nikon&#x27;s other cameras, and steadily increasing costs forced Nikon to announce the discontinuation of the FM3A on 11 January 2006, leaving only the expensive and heavily electronic Nikon F6 and the inexpensively built Nikon FM10 in Nikon&#x27;s 35mm film SLR line. Since the announcement of the FM3A&#x27;s discontinuance, value on the secondhand market of the FM3A camera (and its FM2 predecessors) appreciably increased, this is especially true of the black model. As of 2014, the price for a Mint or Near Mint FM3A are as high as the new price (around 800 - 900 Euro in 2001). This makes this camera to be one of the most price-stable 35mm SLRs.

<text>The River Tove is a river in England, a tributary of the River Great Ouse. Rising in Northamptonshire about a mile north of Greatworth, it flows for about north and east of the town of Towcester (meaning &#x27;camp on the Tove&#x27;) near Bury Mount before meeting the Ouse south-east of Cosgrove just north of Milton Keynes. Its final form part of the border between Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, running alongside the Grand Union Canal. The river ultimately flows into the North Sea.

==Etymology==
The Old English name of Towcester, which is named for the River Tove, is &quot;Tófe-ceaster&quot;, suggesting (since &quot;ceaster&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;castra&quot;, meaning &quot;camp&quot;) that the Old English name for the Tove was some form of &quot;Tófe&quot;. Bosworth and Toller give the &quot;Scandinavian proper names&quot; &quot;Tófi&quot; and &quot;Tófa&quot; for comparison.

It is thought Tófa is a shortened form of &quot;Thorfrithr&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful Thor&quot; or &quot;peace of Thor.&quot;

However, the clearest link for an older origin of the Tove name can be found in the dedication on the Sønder Vissing Runestone. The 10th century carvings describe the stone as having been raised by Tófa, in memory of her mother. The first character of her name is ᛏ, the Rune for Týr, a Northern European deity thought to be of early origins in an Indo-European Pantheon. He was a sky god, god of justice, sacrifice and war.

<text>Almudena Gallardo Vicente (born 26 March 1979 in Madrid) is a Spanish archer who competed in the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.

==Career==
Gallardo joined the Spanish national archery team in 1995 having won three consecutive national junior titles; at sixteen years old she was the team&#x27;s youngest member. She made her Olympic debut in 2000 but was eliminated in the first round of the women&#x27;s individual competition by Anna Karaseva of Belarus.

Gallardo entered the 2004 Summer Olympics as Spain&#x27;s sole representative in the women&#x27;s individual event. She began the event with a score of 631 points from a maximum of 720 in the 72-arrow ranking round, earning her the 24th seed for the subsequent elimination rounds. Victories over Georgia&#x27;s Khatuna Narimanidze and Jasmin Figueroa of the Philippines saw her advance to the last sixteen, where after a poor start she was defeated by Greece&#x27;s Evangelia Psarra by eight points over eighteen arrows. Although Spanish newspaper &quot;El País&quot; was critical of her performance, stating that she failed to live up to expectations, Gallardo afterwards expressed satisfaction with her result. In the event&#x27;s final classification, she was placed thirteenth of the sixty-four competing archers.

In 2005, Gallardo won gold medal in the women&#x27;s individual event of the 2005 Mediterranean Games, defeating Italy&#x27;s Natalia Valeeva in the final.

<doc id="916157" wikidata="Q3147827" url="?curid=916157" title="Vandermonde's identity">
<text>In combinatorics, Vandermonde&#x27;s identity (or Vandermonde&#x27;s convolution) is the following identity for binomial coefficients:

:formula_1

for any nonnegative integers &quot;r&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;. The identity is named after Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde (1772), although it was already known in 1303 by the Chinese mathematician Zhu Shijie.

There is a &quot;q&quot;-analog to this theorem called the &quot;q&quot;-Vandermonde identity.

Vandermonde&#x27;s identity can be generalized in numerous ways, including to the identity

: formula_2

== Proofs ==
=== Algebraic proof ===
In general, the product of two polynomials with degrees &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, respectively, is given by

:formula_3

where we use the convention that &quot;ai&quot; = 0 for all integers &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot; and &quot;bj&quot; = 0 for all integers &quot;j&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;. By the binomial theorem,

:formula_4

Using the binomial theorem also for the exponents &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;, and then the above formula for the product of polynomials, we obtain

:formula_5

where the above convention for the coefficients of the polynomials agrees with the definition of the binomial coefficients, because both give zero for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot; and &quot;j&quot; &gt; &quot;n&quot;, respectively.

By comparing coefficients of &quot;x&quot;&quot;r&quot;, Vandermonde&#x27;s identity follows for all integers &quot;r&quot; with 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot;. For larger integers &quot;r&quot;, both sides of Vandermonde&#x27;s identity are zero due to the definition of binomial coefficients.

=== Combinatorial proof ===
Vandermonde&#x27;s identity also admits a combinatorial double counting proof, as follows. Suppose a committee consists of &quot;m&quot; men and &quot;n&quot; women. In how many ways can a subcommittee of &quot;r&quot; members be formed? The answer is

:formula_6

The answer is also the sum over all possible values of &quot;k&quot;, of the number of subcommittees consisting of &quot;k&quot; men and &quot;r&quot; − &quot;k&quot; women:

:formula_7

=== Geometrical proof ===
Take a rectangular grid of &quot;r&quot; x (&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;) squares. There are

: formula_8

paths that start on the bottom left vertex and, moving only upwards or rightwards, end at the top right vertex (this is because &quot;r&quot; right moves and &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;-&quot;r&quot; up moves must be made (or vice versa) in any order, and the total path length is &quot;m&quot; + &quot;n&quot;). Call the bottom left vertex (0, 0).

There are formula_9 paths starting at (0, 0) that end at (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;), as &quot;k&quot; right moves and &quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot; upward moves must be made (and the path length is &quot;m&quot;). Similarly, there are formula_10 paths starting at (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;) that end at (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;), as a total of &quot;r&quot;−&quot;k&quot; right moves and (&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;) − (&quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;) upward moves must be made and the path length must be &quot;r&quot;−&quot;k&quot; + (&quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;) − (&quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;) = &quot;n&quot;. Thus there are

: formula_11

paths that start at (0, 0), end at (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;), and go through (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;). This is a subset of all paths that start at (0, 0) and end at (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;), so sum from &quot;k&quot; = 0 to &quot;k&quot; = &quot;r&quot; (as the point (&quot;k&quot;, &quot;m&quot;−&quot;k&quot;) is confined to be within the square) to obtain the total number of paths that start at (0, 0) and end at (&quot;r&quot;, &quot;m&quot;+&quot;n&quot;−&quot;r&quot;).

== Generalizations ==

=== Generalized Vandermonde&#x27;s identity ===

One can generalize Vandermonde&#x27;s identity as follows:

: formula_12

This identity can be obtained through the algebraic derivation above when more than two polynomials are used, or through a simple double counting argument.

On the one hand, one chooses formula_13 elements out of a first set of formula_14 elements; then formula_15 out of another set, and so on, through formula_16 such sets, until a total of formula_17 elements have been chosen from the formula_16 sets. One therefore chooses formula_17 elements out of formula_20 in the left-hand side, which is also exactly what is done in the right-hand side.

===Chu–Vandermonde identity===
The identity generalizes to non-integer arguments. In this case, it is known as the Chu–Vandermonde identity (see Askey 1975, pp. 59–60) and takes the form

:formula_21

for general complex-valued &quot;s&quot; and &quot;t&quot; and any non-negative integer &quot;n&quot;. It can be proved along the lines of the algebraic proof above by multiplying the binomial series for formula_22 and formula_23 and comparing terms with the binomial series for formula_24.

This identity may be rewritten in terms of the falling Pochhammer symbols as

:formula_25

in which form it is clearly recognizable as an umbral variant of the binomial theorem (for more on umbral variants of the binomial theorem, see binomial type). The Chu–Vandermonde identity can also be seen to be a special case of Gauss&#x27;s hypergeometric theorem, which states that

:formula_26

where formula_27 is the hypergeometric function and formula_28 is the gamma function. One regains the Chu–Vandermonde identity by taking &quot;a&quot; = −&quot;n&quot; and applying the identity

:formula_29

liberally.

The Rothe–Hagen identity is a further generalization of this identity.

==The hypergeometric probability distribution==
When both sides have been divided by the expression on the left, so that the sum is 1, then the terms of the sum may be interpreted as probabilities. The resulting probability distribution is the hypergeometric distribution. That is the probability distribution of the number of red marbles in &quot;r&quot; draws &quot;without replacement&quot; from an urn containing &quot;n&quot; red and &quot;m&quot; blue marbles.

<text>Lou Dobbs Tonight is an American political and financial talk program that was hosted by Lou Dobbs.

The program initially aired on CNN from its launch under the title Moneyline, as its main financial news program. The program later shifted to an opinion-based format focusing on political and economic commentary, and was likewise renamed &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;. Field correspondents provided additional reporting and occasionally served as guest anchors. During Dobbs&#x27; tenure, prominent politicians and economists were regular guests on the show.

On November 11, 2009, Lou Dobbs stepped down from CNN. On March 14, 2011, Dobbs moved to Fox Business and hosted a new incarnation of &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight.&quot; On February 5, 2021, Fox Business canceled &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; after nearly 10 years on the channel after a defamation lawsuit was filed against Fox News by Smartmatic, a voting machine vendor, over statements made by Dobbs and other Fox Business and Fox News anchors.

In January 2024, the program resumed airing as a streaming show on Lindell TV/FrankSpeech. Lou Dobbs died in July 2024.

==History==
=== CNN era ===
&quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; began with the name Moneyline with the premiere of CNN and was CNN&#x27;s main financial show for over 20 years. For a large portion of those years, it aired on CNN International as well.

In late 1997, Dobbs hired former ABC News and NBC News executive producer David Bohrman to turn the program into a more general evening newscast, which would be called &quot;The Moneyline NewsHour&quot;. The program was half financially focused and half general news. It was the first regular program at CNN to have its main control room outside of Atlanta.

As the show moved more towards general news and economic and political commentary, it was renamed Lou Dobbs Moneyline and then Lou Dobbs Tonight. The show was among CNN&#x27;s most watched.

On November 4, 2006, a taped weekend edition of &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;, entitled &quot;Lou Dobbs This Week&quot;, began airing. The weekend show, which aired every Saturday and Sunday night, discussed issues from the past week and the week ahead.

On November 11, 2009, Lou Dobbs left the network, telling viewers that the night&#x27;s episode of &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; was his last. Further, he said, &quot;Some leaders in media, politics and business have been urging me to go beyond the role here at CNN&quot;. Although he had a contract with CNN until the end of 2011, CNN agreed to release him early. It was announced that John King would host a new program in the time slot and that the transitional program &quot;CNN Tonight&quot; (initially hosted by John Roberts) would replace &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; in the meantime. John King&#x27;s new program, &quot;John King, USA&quot;, debuted in Lou Dobbs&#x27; time slot on March 22, 2010.

=== Fox Business era ===
On November 10, 2010, Fox Business Network announced that Dobbs would join the channel. On March 3, 2011, it was announced that Dobbs&#x27; program would premiere on March 14, and that it would also be known as &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight.&quot; The program became the network&#x27;s highest-rated series, especially during the first presidency of Donald Trump—whom Dobbs regularly supported on-air.

On January 4, 2021, Dobbs stated on air that &quot;everyone knows&quot; crimes were committed in the election process in several states, but he went on to state that &quot;...we still don&#x27;t have verifiable, tangible support&quot; for those alleged crimes. He added that &quot;...we have had a devil of a time finding actual proof.&quot; On February 5, 2021, Fox Business abruptly cancelled &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot;. Dobbs was one of several anchors that had been named in a defamation lawsuit against Fox News by voting machine vendor Smartmatic, which accused the parties of spreading conspiracy theories alleging that it was responsible for voter fraud during the 2020 presidential election. The program was replaced in its time slot by &quot;Fox Business Tonight&quot;, which is hosted by various Fox Business anchors.

==Regular features==
One regular feature on the show was &quot;Exporting America&quot;, in which Dobbs documented American companies that outsourced jobs to overseas facilities, as well as those businesses that took special steps to keep jobs on U.S. soil. He compiled a list of companies that had outsourced, and he posted it on the show&#x27;s website and occasionally repeated it on the air. Dobbs frequently criticized U.S. international trade policy, saying that it insufficiently protected American jobs, and advocated what many consider economic protectionism in contrast to free trade. As part of his criticism of globalization, he often noted that the United States runs trade deficits with virtually every major trading partner it has, especially China. The journalist also published a book titled &quot;Exporting America: Why Corporate Greed Is Shipping American Jobs Overseas&quot;, detailing the individuals and interests behind exporting U.S. jobs overseas.

Another regular feature was &quot;Broken Borders&quot;, which highlighted what Dobbs considered to be the problems and costs associated with illegal immigrants and the inefficiencies in the U.S. Border Patrol and immigration policies in general. Dobbs has remained consistent on this view on the Fox Business Network as well.

==Correspondents and production==
Kitty Pilgrim was a correspondent for the CNN version of the program and the most frequent substitute anchor when Dobbs was not on. Other reporters attached to CNN&#x27;s &quot;Lou Dobbs Tonight&quot; included Dana Bash, Lisa Sylvester, and Suzanne Malveaux. The show was broadcast live from CNN&#x27;s New York studios, located in the Time Warner Center. The Fox Business version of the program originated from Studio B at the News Corp. Building, then towards the end, from a home studio on Dobbs&#x27; farm in Wantage Township in Sussex County, New Jersey.

==Ratings==
The program&#x27;s highest-rated show in 2008 was the day after the presidential election—two million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research data. At Fox Business, the show maintained a multi-year lead as the top business program in its time slot and overall on television.

<doc id="916176" wikidata="Q1816351" url="?curid=916176" title="Span of control">
<text>Span of control, also called span of management, is a term used in business management, particularly human resource management. The term refers to the number of direct reports a supervisor is responsible for (the number of people the supervisor supports).

==Overview==
In simple words, span of control means the manageable number of subordinates of a superior. The bigger the number of the subordinates a manager controls, the broader is her/his span of control.

In a hierarchical business organization of some time in the past it was not uncommon to see average spans of 1-to-4 or even less, i.e. one manager supervised four employees on average. In the 1980s corporate leaders flattened many organizational structures causing average spans to move closer to 1-to-10. That was made possible primarily by the development of inexpensive information technology. As information technology was developed capable of easing many middle manager tasks – tasks like collecting, manipulating and presenting operational information – upper managers found they could hire fewer middle managers to do more work managing more subordinates for less money.

The current shift to self-directed cross-functional teams and other forms of non-hierarchical structures, have made the concept of span of control less important.

Theories about the optimum span of control go back to V. A. Graicunas. In 1933 he used assumptions about mental capacity and attention span to develop a set of practical heuristics. Lyndall Urwick (1956) developed a theory based on geographical dispersion and the need for face to face meetings. In spite of numerous attempts since then, no convincing theories have been presented. This is because the optimum span of control depends on numerous variables including organizational structure, available technology, the functions being performed, and the competencies of the manager as well as staff. An alternative view is proposed by Elliott Jaques that a manager may have up to as many immediate subordinates that they can know personally in the sense that they can assess personal effectiveness.

==Factors Considerable deciding span of Control ==
These are the factors affecting span of control:

# Geographical dispersion, if the branches of a business are widely dispersed, then the manager will find it difficult to supervise each of them, as such the span of control will be smaller.
# Capability of employees: if employees are highly capable, need little supervision, and can be left on their own, e.g., Theory Y type of people, they need not be supervised closely as they are motivated and take initiative to work; as such, the span of control may be broader.
# Capability of managers, an experienced manager with good understanding of the tasks, good knowledge of the workers and good relationships with the workers, will be able to supervise more workers
# Value-add of the manager: a manager that is adding value by training and developing new skills in the workers will need a more narrow span of control than one who is focused only on performance management (this is the reverse of the capability of workers point above)
# Similarity of task: if the tasks that the subordinates are performing are similar, then the span of control can be wider, as the manager can supervise them all at the same time.
# Volume of other tasks: if the manager has other responsibilities, such as membership of committees, involvement in other projects, liaising with stakeholders, the number of direct reports will need to be smaller
# Required administrative tasks: if the manager is required to have regular face-to-face meetings, complete appraisal and development plans, discuss remuneration benefits, write job descriptions and employment contracts, explain employment policy changes, and other administrative task:, span of control may be reduced.
# Business process streamlining, effectiveness, and efficiency can reduce the span of control.

==Theoretical considerations==
The first to develop a more general theory of management was Henry Fayol, who had gathered empirical experience during his time as general manager of a coal and steel company, the Commentary-Fourchambault Company. He was the first to add a managerial perspective to the problem of organizational governance. The rationale for defining a strict hierarchy of communication channels is found in the need for vertical integration of activities, imposed by management&#x27;s need for control and information.

However, exercising control over activities performed by subordinates and monitoring their communication would inflict information overload to the nodes at the upper hierarchical levels, since all communication to other branches of the organizational structure would be routed through them. In addition, a larger number of subordinates also requires supervisors to monitor a high number of interactions below their own level; information overload and span of control are positively correlated.

Graicunas (Gulick and Urwick, 1937) distinguished three types of interactions – direct single relationships, cross-relationships, and direct group relationships – each of them contributing to the total amount of interactions within the organization. According to Graicunas, the number of possible interactions can be computed in the following way. Let n be the number of subordinates reporting to a supervisor. Then, the number of relationships of direct single type the supervisor could possibly engage into is

: formula_1

The number of interactions between subordinates (cross relationships) that the supervisor has to monitor is

: formula_2

and the number of direct group relationships is

: formula_3

The sum of these three types of interactions is the number of potential relationships of a supervisor. Graicunas showed with these formulas that each additional subordinate increases the number of potential interactions significantly. It appears natural that no organization can afford to maintain a control structure of a dimension being required for implementing a scalar chain under the unity of command condition. Therefore, other mechanisms had to be found for dealing with the dilemma of maintaining managerial control, while keeping cost and time at a reasonable level, thus making the span of control a critical figure for the organization. Consequently, for a long time, finding the optimum span of control has been a major challenge to organization design. As Mackenzie (1978, p 121) describes it:

”One could argue that with larger spans, the costs of supervision would tend to be reduced, because a smaller percentage of the members of the organization are supervisors. On the other hand, if the span of control is too large, the supervisor may not have the capacity to supervise effectively such large numbers of immediate subordinates. Thus, there is a possible trade-off to be made in an attempt to balance these possibly opposing tendencies.”
Fayol proposed that subordinate employees should be allowed to communicate directly with each other, given that their superiors had agreed upon this procedure. This principle became known as &quot;Fayol&#x27;s Bridge.&quot;

The use of Fayol’s Bridge resulted in a number of other aspects needing to be taken into consideration. In order to put this system to work, Taylor’s functional foremanship has to be abandoned, and unity of command needs to be established. At the same time, decision power is distributed to individuals on lower levels in the organization, and only decisions that exceed the pre-defined decision scope of an employee are referred upwards. This, in turn, strengthens the co-equality of authority and responsibility. Since a Fayol Bridge is not limited to a certain functional area within the organization, but can span over functional boundaries, e.g. from purchasing to manufacturing, it can be considered as a first attempt to create a horizontal integration of related activities under a certain level of self-management, an early business process.

Mackenzie and others (Massie 1965, Pugh et al., 1972) also noted that there is no generally applicable optimum span of control. There are instead several factors influencing the balance between the desired level of control and the manageability of the organization.

Firstly, it depends on the capabilities of the organizational members, managers and workers. It was assumed, that no manager would be capable of supervising more than 5-6 direct subordinates. However, this conclusion built on the assumption that the superior must actively monitor the work of all subordinates. Later on, this statement was diversified when Davis (1951) divided managerial work into two categories, one requiring the attention to physical work, the other one requiring mental activity. Depending on the type of supervision, a span of 3-8 subordinates for managers at higher levels was considered adequate, while first level supervisors, i.e. those supervising shop floor personnel could have up to 30 subordinates.

The neoclassical theorists have developed a different solution. They assumed that a considerable amount of decisions could be delegated to organizational members at lower organizational levels. This solution would be equivalent to the application of Fayol&#x27;s Bridge combined with the principle of employee initiative that he proposed. As a result, the need for supervision would be reduced from direct control to exception handling. According to this assumption, they considered the opportunity of having access to a supervising manager would be sufficient to satisfy the need for control in standard situations. Peter Drucker refers to this principle as the span of managerial responsibility.

<text>Naomi Anne Folkard (born 18 September 1983) is a British archer who has represented Great Britain at the Olympic Games five times between 2004 and 2020. She has also represented Great Britain at the World Archery Championships and the Archery World Cup, and England at the Commonwealth Games.

Following a string of national titles in the early 2000s, Folkard won selection for the British Olympic archery team in 2004. She has since regularly competed in international recurve archery events and later participated in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 and 2020 Summer Olympics. She is also a prominent competitor in field archery, having won medals at the World Games and the World Field Archery Championships.

==Early and personal life==
Naomi Folkard was born on 18 September 1983 in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. She was introduced to archery at the age of five, first trying out the sport at a family scout camp. At twelve years old she was a member of the British junior team and progressed to the British senior team at the age of sixteen. Folkard&#x27;s parents have both competed in archery competitions at the county level, and as of 2012 her brother was a member of the British junior team.

Folkard studied music at the University of Birmingham, competing in the 2004 Summer Olympics shortly after finishing her second year examinations. She began playing the violin and the piano at a young age, and credits her early experiences with the violin for her adeptness at archery, saying &quot;it was obvious I had a greater co-ordination than most children of my age because of my music&quot;. In 2009 Folkard said had she not become an archer she would probably be a member of an orchestra.

Folkard has one daughter, who was born in 2021.

==Career==
===Early career===
Folkard was British champion in 2000, 2001, and 2003, and competed in the World Student Games in 2003. She was a reserve for Britain&#x27;s archery team for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In 2004, she won the UK Indoor Archery Championships in the women&#x27;s individual recurve category, shortly before qualifying for the Olympics in Athens later that year. Folkard emerged from the 2006 European Indoor Archery Championships a medallist, finishing second and coming away with a silver medal.

===Olympic Games===
;2004 Summer Olympics
Folkard won selection for the 2004 Summer Olympics in April 2004, joining Helen Palmer and four-time Olympian Alison Williamson as a member of Great Britain&#x27;s women&#x27;s team. Folkard concluded the 72-arrow ranking round, which determined the seedings for the subsequent elimination rounds, in seventeenth position for the women&#x27;s individual event and commented that although she had difficulty with her opening and closing arrows, &quot;the middle bit was pretty good&quot;. She progressed as far as the third round where she was defeated by the top seed Park Sung-hyun of South Korea, losing to the eventual gold medalist by twelve points over the match&#x27;s eighteen arrows. Folkard, Palmer, and Williamson fared poorly in the women&#x27;s team event where they were defeated by India in the opening elimination round.

;2008 Summer Olympics
At the 2008 Summer Olympics Folkard combined with teammates Williamson and Charlotte Burgess to take an unexpected second place for Great Britain in the ranking round for the women&#x27;s team event, trailing only defending champions South Korea. The three progressed through the elimination rounds to reach the semi-finals, where a defeat to China sent them to contest the bronze medal match against France. After a thunderstorm postponed the match for 50 minutes, Folkard and her teammates shot below expectations and lost the twenty-four-arrow contest by two points. In a profile published in 2012, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; listed failing to win a medal in Beijing as her biggest sporting disappointment.

For the women&#x27;s individual event Folkard had concluded the ranking round in eighth place with a score of 651 points from a maximum of 720. She advanced to the last sixteen of the competition but was defeated in the third round by Japan&#x27;s Nami Hayakawa after a series of poor-scoring shots.

;2012 Summer Olympics
Folkard secured her place as one of three British female archers for the 2012 Olympic Games in April 2012 at the national trials held in Lilleshall. She and teammates Williamson and Amy Oliver exited early from the women&#x27;s team event after defeat to Russia in the opening round, having finished eleventh out of twelve nations in the ranking round. Folkard entered the elimination rounds of the women&#x27;s individual event as the highest-placed Briton in forty-second place. Following a first-round victory over Russia&#x27;s Kristina Timofeeva, which was praised by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as a &quot;fitting riposte&quot; following the earlier British loss in the team event, Folkard bowed out to Mexico&#x27;s Mariana Avitia in the second round.

;2016 Summer Olympics
Folkard qualified for her fourth Olympic Games in June 2016, entering as one of two British archers contesting the 2016 Summer Olympics. She achieved a career-best Olympic performance by reaching the quarter-finals of the women&#x27;s individual competition, matching the pre-Games target set for Great Britain&#x27;s archers, where she lost to the eventual gold medalist Chang Hye-jin of South Korea. Following her defeat Folkard announced that Rio 2016 was to be her last Olympic games, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve been a full-time archer for 11 years now and I need a life&quot; and adding that she planned to become a coach.

;2020 Summer Olympics
Despite planning to retire following the 2016 Summer Olympics, Folkard continued to participate in international tournaments. Her performances earned her a place on the British Olympic team for the delayed 2020 Summer Olympics in April 2021, her fifth consecutive appearance at the Games. She and her teammates Sarah Bettles and Bryony Pitman were eliminated by Italy in the women&#x27;s team event, and Folkard was later knocked out by Wu Jiaxin in the women&#x27;s individual event.

===World Archery Championships===
At the 2007 World Archery Championships Folkard won bronze medal with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess in the women&#x27;s team recurve event, defeating Italy in the third-place match after a loss to South Korea in the semi-finals. Folkard fared less well two years later at the 2009 Championships, advancing no further than the second round in both her team and individual competitions. She would however win two further bronze medals in the late 2010s, finishing third in the mixed team recurve with Patrick Huston at the 2017 Championships in Mexico City and later in the women&#x27;s team recurve at the 2019 Championships in &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch.

Folkard won two medals each at the 2012 and 2014 World Field Archery Championships. At the 2012 Championships in Val-d&#x27;Isère in France she achieved a gold and a bronze in the women&#x27;s team and individual competitions respectively before following up with two bronze medals in the same events in 2014.

===Archery World Cup===
Folkard achieved three medals at the Archery World Cup between 2007 and 2010. At the fourth stage of the 2007 World Cup in Dover she won gold in the women&#x27;s recurve tournament with Alison Williamson and Charlotte Burgess, and in the 2008 edition combined with Williamson and Burgess to take gold in the Santo Domingo in April and bronze in Boé in June. With Edinburgh selected as the host for the final stage of the 2010 World Cup, Folkard was entered as a wildcard alongside other British athletes and won silver medal in the mixed team recurve competition with Simon Terry.

Folkard reached the final again at the 2017 World Games in Wrocław, earning the silver medal after losing to Germany&#x27;s Lisa Unruh.

Bomer&#x27;s performance was praised by a reviewer for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, who considered his acting as the highlight of the production. Matthew Gilbert of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; praised that Bomer is: &quot;quite simply, devastating in this movie, his beauty adding resonance because it begins to fade so suddenly, as his cheeks protrude and lesions gather.&quot; Gilbert also lauded the chemistry between Bomer and Ruffalo saying that: &quot;is among the movie&#x27;s strengths, too, as it provides the core of love and compassion amid all the acrimony.&quot; Bomer received his first Golden Globe Award in the Best Supporting Actor category and his first Primetime Emmy Awards nomination.

After narrating the documentary , following LGBTQ people in Russia. later that year, Bomer was cast by Murphy in &quot;Pink Cupcakes&quot;, an episode in the fourth season of &quot;American Horror Story&quot;. His participation was described by Lauren Piester of E! Online as &quot;one of the show&#x27;s most shocking moments&quot;. Bomer&#x27;s first release of 2015 was &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot;, a sequel to the popular 2012 film, again featuring Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello. &quot;Magic Mike XXL&quot; grossed $122 million worldwide. Reviewing the film for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Peter Travers noted that; &quot;the movie is just a rambling, loosey-goosey road trip, with Bomer and Manganiello getting extra time to shine.&quot; He also sang two songs for the film&#x27;s soundtrack: &quot;Heaven&quot; and &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot;. After Bomer&#x27;s participation in &quot;American Horror Story: Freak Show&quot;; Murphy put him in the main cast of the fifth season, &quot;American Horror Story: Hotel&quot;. Bomer plays the son of Iris (Kathy Bates) and the lover of the Countess (Lady Gaga).

=== 2016–present: Professional expansion, independent films and Broadway ===

Bomer appeared in two films in 2016. He played for the first time a villain in the movie &quot;The Nice Guys&quot;, as a psycho killer named John Boy. Directed by Shane Black, starring Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe. Gosling and Bomer were at the film&#x27;s premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016. &quot;The Nice Guys&quot; generated positive reviews and enjoyed moderate box office success. His next role was as Matthew Cullen in Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s Western action film &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, playing the farmer husband of Haley Bennett&#x27;s character. The film received mixed reviews from critics, although the cast and action sequences were praised, and grossed $162.4 million worldwide. He was cast as Monroe Stahr, the lead in Billy Ray&#x27;s 2016 series &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, loosely based on the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel of the same name, along with actors Kelsey Grammer, Lily Collins, and Dominique McElligott. He also made a voice-only and uncredited appearance as a narrator of a crime docuseries in Roanoke. This marked his third appearance across the American Horror Story series.

In 2017, he starred in Alex &amp; Andrew Smith&#x27;s drama &quot;Walking Out&quot;, as an estranged father to a 14-year-old son (played by Josh Wiggins). He said that he related to the character &quot;in a profound way.&quot; &quot;Walking Out&quot; was screened in the U.S. Dramatic Competition section of the 2017 Sundance Film Festival and was released on October 6, 2017. Justin Chang of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted that he &quot;steps confidently into the boots of a rugged, know-it-all mountain man whose idea of tough love can turn unexpectedly toward tenderness around a flickering campfire.&quot; David Ehrlich of &quot;IndieWire&quot; stated that Bomer fortunately plays against his &quot;pretty boy type so convincingly that you might forget where you&#x27;ve even seen him before&quot;, concluding that Bomer &quot;gives a commanding performance in a movie that fails to realize how evocative he is, the Smiths defaulting to flashbacks that show us less about cowboys and gender codes than we can glean from the wild look in its lead actor&#x27;s face. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; included his performance in the film in a list of the 17 Most Overlooked Performances of 2017.

Timothy McNeil&#x27;s drama &quot;Anything&quot; marked Bomer&#x27;s final film release of 2017 and McNeil making his feature directorial debut. Bomer was cast as Freda Von Rhenburg, a transgender sex worker who lives in Los Angeles and begins a relationship with her neighbor, Early Landry (played by John Carroll Lynch). &quot;Anything&quot; is based on McNeil&#x27;s play of the same name. He has received some criticism from the transgender community for the casting of a cisgender man, to play a transgender woman. Jon Frosch of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; felt that Bomer: &quot;gives a performance of real warmth and delicacy,&quot; saying that: &quot;rather than play Freda as a force of nature or a collection of mannerisms—the typical default modes of actors playing trans women—Bomer renders her fully dimensional: an unpredictable tangle of impulses, by turns defensive and tender.&quot; &quot;Anything&quot; had its release at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 17, 2017. Also in 2017, Bomer was a guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional.

In 2018, Bomer began working on his directorial debut on series &quot;The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story&quot;. Written by Tom Rob Smith and starring Jon Jon Briones and Darren Criss, in the roles of father and son, respectively, the episode that Bomer directs is titled &quot;Creator/Destroyer&quot;. The episode was watched by more than 1 million people. Bomer had other opportunities to direct before but always wanted to wait for the optimum chance to immerse himself in a project. He read 3,000 pages of books on directing. He found a part in a 2018 revival of the Mart Crowley play &quot;The Boys in the Band&quot;, which was staged at Booth Theatre and marked his Broadway debut. Directed by Joe Mantello, it tells the story a group of gay men who gather for a birthday party in New York City. Theater critic Michael Sommers noted that &quot;Matt Bomer tends to fade in the glare of flashier personalities, but he lends the character a watchful quality as one of those deferential souls who is content to observe others.&quot; The play won a Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play. Bomer&#x27;s first film in 2018 was Bill Oliver&#x27;s science fiction film &quot;Jonathan&quot;. His role was that of a detective who appears in only one scene of the film. &quot;Jonathan&quot; had its world premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 21, 2018.

Two of Bomer&#x27;s films in 2018 premiered at the 43rd Toronto International Film Festivalthe comedy-drama &quot;Papi Chulo&quot; and the drama &quot;Viper Club&quot;. In the former, Bomer plays Sean, a local network television weather forecaster. A reviewer for &quot;Screen Daily&quot; argued that Bomer is &quot;terrific&quot; and concluded that &quot;while he may not yet have the name recognition to act as a key selling point for this film, it&#x27;s the kind of performance which gets noticed&quot;. In &quot;Viper Club&quot;, Bomer played Sam, a journalist who helps Helen (played by Susan Sarandon), to save her son who was kidnapped by a group of terrorists. He had a guest starring role on the NBC series &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot; (2018–2019) and he also appeared as Negative Man in the DC Universe superhero series, &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; (2019).

In 2020, Bomer portrayed Jamie Burns on the USA Network anthology series &quot;The Sinner&quot;. In 2023, Bomer executive produced and portrayed Hawkins Fuller on the Showtime miniseries &quot;Fellow Travelers&quot;.

Bomer joined the cast of the Academy Award for Best Picture nominated film &quot;Maestro&quot; in March 2022 where he played the role of David Oppenheim and starred alongside Bradley Cooper and Carey Mulligan. In March 2024, Bomer joined Jonah Hill&#x27;s upcoming film &quot;Outcome&quot;, starring with Keanu Reeves, Hill, and Cameron Diaz. Filming started in the middle of that month.

In June 2024, it was announced that Max Mutchnick and David Kohan had created a &quot;Golden Girls&quot;–like TV series with Bomer cast as Betty White&#x27;s character and Nathan Lane as Bea Arthur&#x27;s character. Linda Lavin will play Lane&#x27;s mother. The series is set in Palm Springs.

Bomer had married publicist Simon Halls in 2011; the marriage became public through the media in 2014. In an interview discussing his marriage, Bomer said that his marriage to Halls was a very small event in New York City: &quot;It was very chill and very small—just our closest and dear ones. There is a security, a validity. It&#x27;s just a feeling, I think—something about saying vows in front of the people around you who love and support you. I think it was good for our family.&quot; The couple has three children through surrogacy, one born in 2005 and twins born in 2008.

Bomer has been practicing Transcendental Meditation since his early 20s; in 2013 he spoke of his support for the work of the David Lynch Foundation.

<text>James Patrick Kinnon (5 April 1911 – 9 July 1985), commonly known as Jimmy Kinnon or &quot;Jimmy K.&quot;, was one of the primary founders of Narcotics Anonymous (NA), a worldwide fellowship of recovering addicts. During his lifetime, he was usually referred to as &quot;Jimmy K.&quot; due to NA&#x27;s principle of personal anonymity on the public level. He never referred to himself as a founder of NA, although the record clearly shows that he played a founding role.

==Early life==
Kinnon was born in Paisley, Scotland on 5 April 1911, the first of seven children born to James Kinnon, of Irish Catholic descent, and Elizabeth Carrick.

When Kinnon was 7, he befriended a local alcoholic whom he referred to as Mr. Crookshank. Kinnon would often find him drunk and beaten. One day he found Crookshank badly beaten up and unresponsive. Kinnon ran for help. Over the following weeks Kinnon did not see Mr. Crookshank, and after numerous inquiries, his mother took him to see him. They went to an institution of which Mr. Crookshank was now a resident. He was incoherent and using a wheelchair. Upon leaving the facility, Kinnon told his mother that when he grew up, he was going to help people like Mr. Crookshank.

Jimmy Kinnon and his family emigrated to the United States on August 8, 1923. His family living in Philadelphia, he attended a Catholic seminary in nearby Germantown section of Philadelphia and had plans, or his parents had plans for him, of entering the priesthood, which meant six rigorous years of training. But he was progressively using paregoric, alcohol and codeine pills from late childhood until he got clean in Alcoholics Anonymous in 1950. He eventually became a roofer and painter. He met his future first wife Agnes Cragin and married her in Philadelphia in 1934. They had five children together in California where they moved in the early 1940s.

==Getting clean==
Kinnon stopped using all mood and mind-altering substances on 2 February 1950. He began attending Alcoholics Anonymous, a twelve-step program. While in Alcoholics Anonymous he met other members who had struggled with addiction to substances other than alcohol, Due to its &quot;singleness of purpose&quot; principle, Alcoholics Anonymous often discouraged members from talking about addictions other than alcohol, but never prevented attendance by anyone.
Kinnon attended meetings of another group called Habit-forming Drugs but was disappointed with it.
He also saw the need to recover from more than the symptom, i.e. substance used (alcohol, pills, etc.), by addressing the addict&#x27;s thinking and attitudes before, during and after using. This is why later on, for NA, he and the other founders would change the language of Step One of the Twelve Steps of AA from &quot;We admitted we were powerless over ALCOHOL, that our lives had become unmanageable&quot; to &quot;We admitted we were powerless over OUR ADDICTION, that our lives had become unmanageable &quot;.

==Formation of Narcotics Anonymous==
In the summer of 1953 Jimmy Kinnon and other members of Alcoholics Anonymous began holding their own separate meetings, which they called Narcotics Anonymous. They were given permission from Alcoholics Anonymous to adapt the AA Twelve Steps, and to change Step One from &quot;We admitted we were powerless over alcohol...&quot; to &quot;We admitted we were powerless over our addiction...&quot; as stated before. This was a significant change of focus from the AA program, because NA is then focused on recovery from the &quot;disease of addiction&quot; rather than from any particular substance use. Kinnon saw the substance use as a symptom of a deeper core issue, (i.e. the obsessive thinking and compulsive behavior) from which the substances are used to gain a temporary relief. Narcotics Anonymous was officially founded in July 1953 in Sun Valley, California. 
There was at the time a different organization also called Narcotics Anonymous that was previously founded in the 1940s by a recovering addict named Danny Carlsen in New York City, but it was more of a social-services organization than a Twelve Step Fellowship and it did not follow the Twelve Traditions. It was never connected to the Narcotics Anonymous Kinnon and his mates started in Sun Valley and died out in the mid-1960s.

In the book &quot;My Years with Narcotics Anonymous&quot; Bob Stone wrote about the contribution of Jimmy:
&#x27;
==Literature==
Most of Narcotics Anonymous early literature was written by Jimmy Kinnon and is still used worldwide today in over 70,000 NA meetings. He was the main contributor to the &quot;Yellow Booklet&quot; and &quot;Little White Booklet&quot; that were used throughout the 1960s and 1970s. From 1953 to 1977 Narcotics Anonymous had only a set of pamphlets and booklets as literature. From 1979 to 1982 hundreds of Narcotics Anonymous members from the &quot;new&quot; generation of drug users of the sixties and seventies expanded on this literature and created &quot;The Basic Text&quot;. Kinnon also designed &quot;the NA logo&quot;, &quot;The Group Logo&quot;, &quot;The Service Symbol&quot; and wrote the &quot;Gratitude Prayer&quot; and &quot;Fruit of the Harvest&quot; statement found in the beginning of &quot;The Basic Text&quot;. This book was the first ever known that was written by recovering addicts for recovering addicts. It was first published in 1982.
9.3 million copies of &quot;The Basic Text&quot; have been published since 1982, in 31 languages.

==Death==
Jimmy Kinnon, who had fought a battle against tuberculosis from the late fifties on, died of lung cancer on 9 July 1985, in California. Prior to his death he said, &quot;if he ever had a headstone it would read, &quot;All we did was sow some seeds and work and wrought to make this work, so that we and others could live. In Peace, in Freedom and in Love&quot;. He was clean for thirty five years at the time of his death.

<text>First Canadian Place is a skyscraper in the Financial District of Toronto, Ontario, at the northwest corner of King and Bay streets, and serves as the global operational executive office of the Bank of Montreal. At , it is the tallest building in Canada, the 34th tallest building in North America, and the 243rd tallest in the world. It is also the third tallest free-standing structure in Canada, after the CN Tower (also in Toronto) and the Inco Superstack chimney (projected to be demolished) in Sudbury, Ontario. The building is owned by Manulife Financial Corporation (50 per cent) in addition to a private consortium of investors including CPP Investments. The building is managed by Brookfield Properties.

==History and architecture==

First Canadian Place is named for Canada&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of Montreal. The main building in the complex was intended to be known as &quot;First Canadian Bank Tower.&quot; Designed by B+H Architects with Edward Durell Stone as a design consultant, construction was completed in 1975.

The tower and associated buildings occupy a block once home to two major newspapers, the &quot;Toronto Star’s&quot; Toronto Star Building and &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;″s William H. Wright Building. The site was the last of the corners at King and Bay to be redeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s, and a major bidding war began over the property. The then-little-known firm of Olympia and York eventually obtained nearly the whole city block, but the election of reformist mayor David Crombie led to new rules banning skyscrapers. It took three years of lobbying before permission for First Canadian Place was granted. When completed, the building was nearly identical in appearance to Stone&#x27;s Standard Oil Building in Chicago, Illinois; completed two years previous, the Chicago tower is of the same floor plan and clad in the same marble, the only overtly visible difference being the vertical orientation of the windows, as opposed to the horizontal run of those on First Canadian Place.

First Canadian Place was the 6th tallest building in the world to structural top (currently 103rd) and the tallest building overall outside of Chicago and New York when completed in 1975. It was also the tallest building in the Commonwealth of Nations until the completion of the Petronas Towers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1998. The Bank of Montreal &quot;M-bar&quot; logo at the top of the building was the highest sign in the world from 1975 until overtaken by the sign atop CITIC Plaza in 1997. The roof is still the location of a number of antennas used for radio and television broadcasting. The structure contains 29 elevators, and is one of only a few buildings in the world that uses the double-decked variety, and is connected to the underground PATH system.

The building was pictured on the front and rear cover of the 1981 album &quot;This Is the Ice Age&quot; by Canadian New Wave band Martha and the Muffins and also their 7&quot; single &quot;Women Around the World at Work&quot;. The album featured two photos which were taken from the same place but at different times by Muffins guitarist Mark Gane using a time-lapse camera and features the building at midday and dusk. The 7&quot; cover again features the same photo but has 9 small images taken at various times of the day and night.

===Cladding===

The same white Carrara marble used on Stone&#x27;s Aon Center (in Chicago) was employed as an exterior cladding and interior finish for First Canadian Place, with approximately 45,000 marble panels weighing around each. Foreshadowing what would take place with First Canadian Place in 2007, one of the marble slabs of Aon Center, when it was named the Standard Oil Building, detached in 1974, falling and penetrating the roof of a neighbouring building, resulting in an eventual recladding of the entire Aon Center in white granite between 1992 and 1994. This problem would surface at First Canadian Place as well, during an intense storm on the evening of 15 May 2007, a , white marble panel fell from the 60th storey of the tower&#x27;s southern face onto the 3rd-floor mezzanine roof below, causing authorities to close surrounding streets as a precaution.

In late 2009, owner Brookfield Properties announced it would follow the example of Aon Center and, over three years, replace the tower&#x27;s 45,000 marble panels with new ones in glass, those on the main expanses with a white ceramic frit and the corners in a bronze tint. Brookfield and the co-owners also launched a multi-faceted rejuvenation program, including &quot;upgrades to the building&#x27;s mechanical, electrical, and lighting systems that will redefine the standard for enhanced performance, comfort, and greening&quot;. FCP&#x27;s common areas including upper and lower level entrance and elevator lobbies, the retail concourse and Market Place were to also undergo renovation, with new natural stone flooring, fritted glass accents, brushed metal handrails, landscaping, and water features. The rejuvenation program design architects were Moed de Armas &amp; Shannon Architects and Bregman + Hamann Architects were the architects of record. The entire project, completed in 2012, cost was in excess of CA$100 million, paid by the owner. This extensive capital improvement project was intended to provide a new exterior for FCP and eliminate the maintenance costs associated with marble upkeep.

<text>Kedyw (, partial acronym of &quot;Kierownictwo Dywersji&quot; (&quot;Directorate of Sabotage&quot;) was a Polish World War II Home Army unit that conducted active and passive sabotage, propaganda and armed operations against Nazi German forces and collaborators.

==Operations==

Kedyw was created on January 22, 1943, from two pre-existing Armia Krajowa organisations: Związek Odwetu (&quot;Association of Retaliation&quot;), and Wachlarz. Initially, the units were small and town-based. Eventually, as more were formed, some moved into forested areas to begin partisan warfare. Kedyw organized weapon and munition factories, military schools, intelligence, counter-intelligence, field hospitals and a communication network. 


Most members of Kedyw were Boy Scouts from Związek Harcerstwa Polskiego and its wartime organisation, Szare Szeregi. Many of the officers were cichociemni, who were special agents trained in the United Kingdom and parachuted into occupied Poland. Selected Kedyw groups (&quot;patrole&quot;) carried out operations all over occupied Poland. Notable types of operations included:
* the sabotaging of railways, bridges and roads
** the burning of trains and fuel depots
* the destruction or damaging of weapon factories working for the Wehrmacht
* the liberation of hundreds of prisoners and hostages
** a famous such operation took place on March 26, 1943 and is known as &quot;Akcja pod Arsenałem&quot;
* executions of Nazi collaborators and traitors sentenced by an underground court
** one of them involved Igo Sym, a Polish actor who had been informing the Germans about Home Army operations
* executions of particularly-brutal individuals among the German occupation troops, Gestapo, SS and police known as Operation Heads
** those executed included SS and police General Franz Kutschera, killed on February 2, 1944, SS-Hauptscharfuhrer August Kretschmann, commandant of the Gęsiówka concentration camp, SS-Rottenführer Ewald Lange, SS-Obersturmführer Herbert Schultz, SS-Oberscharführer Franz Bürkl and many others (more than 2,000 people). Such individuals were officially sentenced to death for their crimes by the Polish Underground State court, which was delivered to those individuals. Many could not stand the pressure and returned to the Reich.
* executions of individuals from units collaborating with Nazi Germany such as Ukrainian Auxiliary Police involved in the killing of Poles
** In Lviv, in late February and March 1944, the &quot;Ukrainische Hilfspolizei&quot; arrested a number of young men of Polish nationality. Many of them were later found dead and their Identity documents stolen. The Government Delegation for Poland started negotiations with the OUN-B. When they failed, Kedyw began an action called &quot;Nieszpory&quot; (&quot;Vespers&quot;) where 11 policemen were shot in retaliation and the murders of young Poles in Lviv stopped.
* Operation Belt, targeting German border guard stations on the night of 20–21 August 1944. A prominent member of the organization and a protagonist of Aleksander Kamiński&#x27;s book &quot;Stones for the Rampart&quot;, Tadeusz Zawadzki, was killed during the operation in Sieczychy.

==Warsaw Uprising==

Prior to the Warsaw Uprising, most of the Kedyw units in the Warsaw area were moved into the city and grouped into infantry battalions. Notable among them were &quot;Zośka&quot;, &quot;Parasol&quot; and &quot;Miotła&quot;. After fighting broke out, most of the Kedyw forces joined the &quot;Radosław&quot; Group. Kedyw units were among the most successful in the Uprising. The boy scouts not only had more experience than many regular soldiers but also had managed to collect more supplies and arms.

Kedyw units first took part in seizing control of Warsaw&#x27;s Wola district. After two days of heavy fighting in the Powązki Cemetery in which all German attacks were repulsed with heavy casualties, the units withdrew overnight to the city centre and Starówka (&quot;the old town&quot;), where they regrouped and defended their sectors until the capitulation of the uprising in October 1944.

<text>Zhang Juanjuan (; born January 2, 1981, in Qingdao, Shandong, People&#x27;s Republic of China) is an archer from the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

==Early and personal life==
Zhang was born on 2 January 1982 in the Chinese city of Qingdao in Shandong Province. Before taking up archery Zhang trained in shot put, javelin and discus.

She married in 2009 and had a child in 2010. As of 2015 she worked as the deputy director of an archery centre in her native Qingdao.

==Records and world competition==

=== 2004 Summer Olympics ===
Zhang represented China at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She was placed 5th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 663. In the first round of elimination, she faced 60th-ranked Aurore Trayan of France. Zhang defeated Trayan 135-122 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 28th-ranked Polish archer Iwona Marcinkiewicz. Zhang won the match 166-157 in the regulation 18 arrows, advancing to the round of 16. She then lost to 21st-ranked and eventual bronze medalist Alison Williamson of Great Britain 165-161, finishing 10th in women&#x27;s individual archery.

===2008 Summer Olympics===
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Zhang finished her ranking round with a total of 635 points. This gave her the 27th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Tetyana Berezhna in the first round, beating the archer from Ukraine 109-97. In the second round Zhang defeated 6th seed Yuan Shu Chi 110-105, and advanced to the quarter-finals after a 110-98 victory against 11th seed Natalia Erdyniyeva. There she beat Joo Hyun-Jung 106-101. In the semi-final she upset another South Korean Yun Ok-Hee with 115-109. The 115 points matched the newly set Olympic Record by Park Sung-hyun earlier that day. Park turned out to be Zhang&#x27;s opponent in the final and in a close match, the lead switching back and forth, Zhang eventually won the gold in a 110-109 match, becoming that first non-Korean to win the event since Keto Losaberidze at the 1980 Summer Olympics.

Together with Chen Ling and Guo Dan, she also took part in the team event. With her 635 score from the ranking round combined with the 645 of Chen and the 636 of Guo the Chinese team was in third position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter-finals, where they defeated the Indian team 211-206. In the semi-final against Great Britain they scored 208 points against the British 202, securing their spot in the final. They faced South Korea, who won gold with a strong 224 points performance, and China, with 215 points, claimed silver.

===Asian Games===

She competed at the 2002 Asian Games, where she won a bronze medal in the team event, and at the 2006 Asian Games where she won a silver medal in the same event.

==2015 &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; challenge==
Zhang was invited to Nanjing as one of the seven best archers from around the world, to appear on a first-ever popular Chinese television program to feature an archery competition. The show, which aired on Jiangsu Broadcasting Corporation on 22 February 2015, was seen by 250 million Chinese viewers. Another finalist was Austrian archer, Peter O. Stecher. The challenge was to shoot arrows at falling rings. In the end, Zhang shot to a draw with Stecher, each hitting seven falling rings out of fifteen opportunities.

<text>Operation Belt () was one of the large-scale anti-Nazi Germany operations of the Armia Krajowa Kedyw during World War II.

In August 1943, the headquarters of the Armia Krajowa ordered Kedyw to prepare an armed action against German border guarding stations on the frontier between the General Government and the territories annexed by the Third Reich. By February 1944, 13 German outposts were destroyed with few losses on the Polish side. One of the Poles who died in the operation was the Boy Scout Tadeusz Zawadzki, one of the most important personalities of the Polish underground. Zawadzki was killed on 20 August 1943, during an attack on a German border station at the village of Sieczychy, near Wyszków.

Operation Belt itself took place on the night of 20–21 August, when seven German stations were destroyed. On 30 August, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski ordered to begin preparation of another armed action, Operation Chain (), which was the continuation of &quot;Belt&quot;.

During &quot;Chain&quot;, which took place in late November 1943, units of the Home Army carried out several similar attacks on German border stations in southern part of occupied Poland. In the autumn of 1943, the Home Army of the Kraków District attacked several German outposts along the border with Slovakia – among others, at Barwinek, Piwniczna, and in the area of Nowy Targ and Wadowice.

<text>Fazlur Rahman Malik ( ; ; September 21, 1919 – July 26, 1988), commonly known as Fazlur Rahman, was a modernist scholar and Islamic philosopher from present-day Pakistan. Recognized as a leading liberal reformer within Islam, he focused on educational reform and promoting independent reasoning (&quot;ijtihad&quot;). His work has attracted both significant interest and criticism in Muslim-majority countries. His reformist ideas led to protests by over a thousand clerics, faqihs, muftis, and teachers in Pakistan, ultimately resulting in his exile.

After teaching in the UK and in Canada, where he formed a close friendship with philosopher Ismail al-Faruqi, Fazlur Rahman was appointed head of Pakistan’s Central Institute of Islamic Research in 1963. While widely respected among Islamic reformers, his ideas drew strong criticism from conservative scholars who viewed his approach as excessively liberal. Political opponents of his ally, General Ayub Khan, capitalized on this dissent, ultimately leading to Fazlur Rahman’s departure from Pakistan in 1968. He relocated to the United States, where he taught at the University of California, Los Angeles and later at the University of Chicago.

== Biography ==
===Early life and education=== 
Fazlur Rahman was born in the Hazara District of the North West Frontier Province (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) of British India (now Pakistan). His father, Maulana Shihab al-Din, was a prominent scholar who had studied at Deoband and held the title of alim through his expertise in Islamic law, prophetic narrations, Quranic commentaries, logic, philosophy, and other subjects. Under his father’s influence, Fazlur Rahman was introduced to traditional Islamic sciences and completed the memorization of the Quran at the age of ten. He pursued formal studies in Arabic at Punjab University, and later completed his doctoral studies at Oxford University, where he wrote a dissertation on Ibn Sina.

===Early career=== 
After completing his studies, Fazlur Rahman began his teaching career, initially at Durham University, where he taught Persian and Islamic philosophy. He later joined McGill University, where he taught Islamic studies until 1961. During his time at McGill, he formed a close association with the Palestinian-American philosopher Ismail al-Faruqi, introduced through Wilfred Cantwell Smith, the founder of McGill’s Institute of Islamic Studies. Under Smith’s mentorship, al-Faruqi delved deeply into Christian and Jewish theological studies, with Fazlur Rahman observing that Smith&#x27;s guidance significantly shaped al-Faruqi’s comparative approach to religious studies and interfaith dialogue.

===Return to Pakistan=== 
In 1961, Fazlur Rahman returned to Pakistan at the request of President Ayub Khan to lead the Central Institute of Islamic Research in Karachi, which had been established by the Pakistani government to integrate Islamic principles into the nation’s public affairs. He also supported a two-year appointment for al-Faruqi at the Institute, where al-Faruqi served as a visiting professor. Reflecting on this period, Fazlur Rahman noted that the experience broadened al-Faruqi’s understanding of cultural diversity within Islam, ultimately shaping his approach to comparative religion and meta-religion. Despite his efforts, the political climate in Pakistan presented significant obstacles to Fazlur Rahman’s vision. Orthodox ulema opposed his modernist interpretations, and as Ayub Khan’s political influence waned, they denounced him as an apostate, calling for his death as a wajib ul qatl. He ultimately resigned from the position in September 1968 and relocated to the United States.

===Career in the United States=== 
In the United States, Fazlur Rahman resumed his teaching career, first as a visiting professor at UCLA for a year. In 1969, he joined the University of Chicago, where he became the Harold H. Swift Distinguished Service Professor of Islamic Thought. At Chicago, he played an instrumental role in building a strong Near Eastern Studies program, which continues to be highly regarded. Fazlur Rahman also advocated for reform within Islamic governance and served as an advisor to the State Department. He passed away in Chicago, Illinois on July 26, 1988, at the University of Chicago Medical Center due to complications from coronary bypass surgery. At the time of his death, he was a resident of suburban Naperville, Illinois and is buried in Arlington Cemetery, Elmhurst, Illinois.

===Legacy===
Since Fazlur Rahman’s death, his writings have remained influential among scholars of Islam and the Near East in various countries, including Pakistan, Malaysia, Indonesia, Turkey, and the Arab region. His impact at the University of Chicago endures, particularly within its programs related to Islamic and Near Eastern studies. In his honor, the Center for Middle Eastern Studies at the University of Chicago named its common area after him, recognizing his many years of service and contributions to the university. A polyglot, he mastered Urdu, Persian, Arabic, and English early in life and later learned classical Greek, Latin, German, and French to further his academic work.

== Views ==
Fazlur Rahman’s philosophy emphasized a return to the intellectual dynamism of early Islam, advocating a dynamic approach to religious interpretation. He believed in integrating philosophy, ethics, and rational thought to address contemporary issues facing the Muslim world. Fazlur Rahman criticized traditional Muslim theologies for overlooking the Quran’s moral principles, stressing that &quot;moral values&quot; endure beyond history and require constant reinterpretation. His work &quot;Islam and Modernity&quot; (1982) outline these ideas seeking to reconcile Islamic principles with modern challenges.

=== Social justice ===
Fazlur Rahman argued that Islamic tradition often prioritized judicial codes over developing a Quran-based ethical framework. Viewing historical Islamic governance models, such as the caliphate, as past solutions for societal justice, he called for a reformed understanding of justice rooted in the Quranic concept of &quot;shura&quot; (consultation). He proposed expanding shura to involve all levels of society, advocating collaboration between religious and secular scholars to address social justice issues.

=== Riba&#x27; and economic reform ===
Addressing &quot;riba&quot; (interest), Fazlur Rahman diverged from the strict prohibition stance of many Islamic revivalist movements. He contended that the Quran’s condemnation of &quot;riba&quot; referred specifically to exploitative, compounding interest in pre-Islamic Arabia, not moderate loan interest. Fazlur Rahman cited the &quot;Muwatta&quot; of Imam Malik to support his view, arguing for a nuanced interpretation that bans predatory lending while allowing interest in modern banking. This perspective directly opposed figures like Abul A&#x27;la Maududi, who advocated a total ban on interest. He wrote that “the initial interest itself was not usurious and was, therefore, not considered riba. What made it riba was the increase … that raised the principal several-fold by continued redoubling.”

=== Reform movements and intellectual revival ===
Fazlur Rahman was critical of both revivalist and modernist Islamic movements. He argued that 18th- and 19th-century revivalists stifled intellectual growth, while modernists selectively applied Islamic principles without grounding them in a robust methodology. Instead, he championed a &quot;neo-modernism&quot; rooted in a disciplined Islamic framework, advocating for a revival of rational inquiry within Islamic scholarship. His &quot;double movement theory&quot; reflects this approach by encouraging a balanced interpretation of Islamic teachings through context and present-day application, which has been highlighted as essential to fostering religious moderation.

=== Contextual interpretation of the Quran ===
Fazlur Rahman contributed significantly to the development of a contextual approach to examining the Qur’an, arguing that readers must consider both the historical context in which the text was revealed and contemporary social changes. This approach, which he described as a “twofold movement,” involves understanding the Qur’an’s teachings as specific to its time but also adaptable to modern society’s evolving needs.

Some Islamic feminist scholars, such as Amina Wadud and Sa’diyyah Shaikh, have cited Fazlur Rahman’s contextual methodology as an inspiration for their own interpretations of the Qur’an, particularly in advocating for gender equality within Islamic teachings. Scholars such as Tamara Sonn and Na’eem Jeenah have noted that his ideas align with an “Islamic Feminist Hermeneutic” approach, demonstrating the broader relevance of his methodology in modern Islamic discourse.

<doc id="916220" wikidata="Q3730774" url="?curid=916220" title="Epyx Fast Load">
<text>The Epyx Fast Load is a floppy disk fast loader cartridge made by American software company Epyx in 1984 for the Commodore 64 home computer. It was programmed by Epyx employee Scott Nelson, who was originally a programmer for Starpath and later designed the Epyx Vorpal fastloading system for the company&#x27;s games.

==Description==
Epyx Fast Load allows programs to load from the Commodore 1541 disk drive at 2,500 bytes per second, approximately five times faster than the normal speed. Since it is stored on a cartridge, and thus provides instant access without requiring any hardware modification of the C64 or the disk drive, the Fast Load quickly became a very popular peripheral among C64 users.

In addition to disk acceleration, the cartridge also provides a built-in version of the Commodore DOS Wedge. This dramatically reduces the number of keystrokes needed to load or save files or perform disk operations, and makes the cartridge even more convenient.

Epyx Fast Load incorporates a machine language monitor. Although it does not include an assembler, as most &quot;standard&quot; C64 ML monitors do, it includes a wide array of powerful debugging tools. These include disassembly, single-stepping, and an automatic machine code relocator.

A crude disk editor is also included with the cartridge, which displays raw data from floppy disks in classical hex+ASCII split screen mode. Among other things, the disk editor can be used to enter cheat codes and do the home computer equivalent of ROM hacking.

In the unusual case of software that doesn&#x27;t work with the Fast Load, the cartridge can be disabled via a menu command, thus avoiding the need to physically remove and reinsert it.

While the original 1984 version of the Fast Load will not work with the SD2IEC floppy drive emulation system, newer variants of the cartridge do support it.

==Reception==
In a review of three Commodore 64 fast loaders, &quot;Ahoy!&quot; wrote that &quot;Fast Load&quot; &quot;is surprisingly transparent to all the forms of commercial copy protection we have looked at ... In terms of greatest convenience and speed, we place our bets on&quot; it.

&quot;Commodore Microcomputers&quot; found that &quot;Fast Load&quot; did not speed up all software but was very effective when it did. The magazine recommended buying the cartridge for the DOS Wedge and fast copying, with fastloading as a bonus. A review of five fast loaders in the magazine found that &quot;&quot;Fast Load&quot; performed well during testing&quot; and approved of its ease of use and documentation. However, the table included in the article showed that the cartridge only significantly sped up loading times for four of nine applications and games, not benefiting the others.
