<text>Darren McGavin (born William Lyle Richardson; May 7, 1922 – February 25, 2006) was an American actor.

McGavin began his career working as a set painter for Columbia Pictures. In 1954, he originated roles in Broadway productions of &quot;My Three Angels&quot; and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, followed by film roles in David Lean&#x27;s &quot;Summertime&quot; and Otto Preminger&#x27;s &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (both 1955).

On television, McGavin portrayed the title character in &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot; (1958–1959), and starred in &quot;Riverboat&quot; (1959–1961) and &quot;&quot; (1974–1975). For his recurring role on the sitcom &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, he received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.

His film credits include &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot; (1976), &quot;Airport &#x27;77&quot; (1977), &quot;Hot Lead and Cold Feet&quot; (1978), &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; (1983), &quot;Happy Hell Night&quot; (1992), and &quot;Billy Madison&quot; (1995). Despite playing a significant role in the baseball film &quot;The Natural&quot; (1984), due to a contract dispute, McGavin was uncredited for his portrayal of a shady bookie, Gus Sands.

==Early life==
William Lyle Richardson was born in Spokane, Washington, to Grace Mitton ( Bogart) and Reed D. Richardson. His parents divorced when he was 11 years old, and custody was given to his father, who was employed as a traveling salesman for a chemical company. 

As an adolescent, McGavin&#x27;s father boarded him with a family at their farm on Puget Sound near Tacoma while he traveled for work. McGavin eventually ran away from the farm, and lived with a Native American family along the Nisqually River. His father was soon notified that he had fled, and McGavin temporarily dodged police and welfare workers before his father enrolled him in a Catholic boarding school.

Around age 16, McGavin left the boarding school and temporarily lived as a runaway under the wharf in San Francisco, before moving in with his mother and stepfather, William L. Maddison, at their ranch in Southern California. While attending high school in Galt, California, McGavin developed aspirations to be an architect, and after graduating, enrolled at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, California, to study architecture. He later studied theatre at the HB Studio in New York City. McGavin was rejected for military service during World War II because of bad knees.

==Career==
===Broadway, film, and television===

While attending the College of the Pacific, McGavin took a side job building scenery for a local theater group. He subsequently dropped out of college, and found work as a painter at Columbia Pictures movie studios in 1945. When an opening became available for a bit part in &quot;A Song to Remember&quot;, McGavin applied and won his first movie role. Shortly afterwards, he moved to New York City and studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse and the Actors Studio under teacher Sanford Meisner. 

In 1949, he joined the cast of a touring production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, playing Happy Lohman. He began appearing on Broadway in 1954, in productions of &quot;My Three Angels&quot; and &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (where he created the title role) opposite Geraldine Page. 

While in New York, McGavin also appeared on several live theater programs that aired on television, such as &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; and &quot;The U.S. Steel Hour&quot;.

McGavin returned to Hollywood in the early 1950s and appeared in the short film &quot;A Word to the Wives&quot; with Marsha Hunt, and had his first starring roles in the feature films &quot;Summertime&quot;, opposite Katharine Hepburn, and &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (both 1955). 

Also in 1955, McGavin appeared twice in the anthology series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, first in an episode titled &quot;Triggers in Leash&quot; and later in an episode titled &quot;The Cheney Vase&quot;, as a scheming caretaker and aspiring art thief, opposite Carolyn Jones, Patricia Collinge, and Ruta Lee. He also later appeared in an episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; titled &quot;A Matter of Murder&quot; in 1964.

Throughout his career, McGavin starred in seven different TV series and guest-starred in many more; these television roles increased in the late 1950s and early 1960s with leading parts in series such as &quot;Mickey Spillane&#x27;s Mike Hammer&quot;, in which he portrayed the title character from 1957 until 1959. He was subsequently cast as Captain Grey Holden opposite Burt Reynolds in the Western series &quot;Riverboat&quot;, which aired from 1959 until 1961; Reynolds was replaced by Noah Beery Jr. midway through the series due to disputes between Reynolds and McGavin. After his departure, Reynolds told &quot;TV Guide&quot;: &quot;Darren McGavin is going to be a very disappointed man on the first Easter after his death.&quot; Though considered by critics to be among the best actors working in television at the time, in 1960, McGavin told the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; that he disliked most television, likening it to purgatory for a working actor.

When Martin and Lewis broke up, McGavin played the role originally earmarked for Dean Martin in &quot;The Delicate Delinquent&quot;, Jerry Lewis&#x27;s first solo film. McGavin was also known for his role as Sam Parkhill in the miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;. He appeared as a fill-in regular in &quot;The Name of the Game&quot; in an episode entitled &quot;Goodbye Harry&quot; and was featured as a reporter in one of the Gene Barry segments. McGavin returned to theater in 1964, starring in a regional production of &quot;A Thousand Clowns&quot;, in which his teenaged son, York, also appeared. In 1964, McGavin appeared as Mark Troxel on &quot;The Virginian&quot; in the episode &quot;The Intruders&quot;. In 1968, he starred as David Ross on the short-lived detective series &quot;The Outsider&quot;.

In 1970, McGavin appeared in &quot;Tribes&quot;, an ABC Movie of the Week that aired to critical acclaim. &quot;Tribes&quot; was a ratings success when it first aired November 10, 1970 (which happened to be the Marine Corps&#x27; 195th birthday), &quot;Tribes&quot; was later released theatrically in Britain and Europe under the title &quot;The Soldier Who Declared Peace&quot;.

===&quot;Kolchak&quot; films and series===
McGavin was cast as the lead in the supernatural-themed television film &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; (1972). With McGavin playing a reporter who discovers the activities of a modern-day vampire on the loose in Las Vegas, the film became the highest-rated made-for-TV movie in history at that time; when the sequel &quot;The Night Strangler&quot; (1973) was also a strong success, a subsequent television series &quot;&quot; (1974) was made. In the series, McGavin played Carl Kolchak, an investigative reporter for the INS, a Chicago-based news service, who regularly stumbles upon the supernatural or occult basis for a seemingly mundane crime; although his involvement routinely assisted in dispelling of the otherworldly adversary, his evidence in the case was always destroyed or seized, usually by a public official or major social figure who sought to cover up the incident. He would write his ensuing stories in a sensational, tabloid style, which advised readers that the true story was being withheld from them. McGavin reportedly entered into a verbal agreement with Sid Sheinberg (president of MCA and Universal TV) to produce &quot;The Night Stalker&quot; as a TV series as a co-production between Universal and McGavin&#x27;s Taurean Productions. Early promises were never fulfilled, and McGavin expressed concern over script quality and lack of network commitment toward promoting the show. His concerns appeared justified, as the series drifted into camp humor and the production values declined in later episodes.

In 1973, prior to the production of &quot;Kolchak: The Night Stalker&quot;, McGavin made his directorial debut with the film &quot;Happy Mother&#x27;s Day, Love George&quot;, a mystery film starring Cloris Leachman, Ron Howard, and Bobby Darin.

===Later career and final work===

In 1973, McGavin played Oliver Spencer in the original pilot film &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot;. Between 1976 and 1978, McGavin also co-starred in several Disney movies, including 1976&#x27;s &quot;No Deposit, No Return&quot; and 1978&#x27;s &quot;Hot Lead and Cold Feet&quot;. McGavin starred in the comedy &quot;Zero to Sixty&quot; (1978), produced by his wife, Kathie Browne, in which he portrayed a divorced man attempting to sort out his life. In 1983, he starred as &quot;the Old Man&quot;, aka Mr. Parker, the narrator&#x27;s father, in Bob Clark&#x27;s seasonal comedy &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;. He portrayed a middle class father in 1940s Hohman, Indiana, who was endearing despite his use of profanity and unfortunate taste for kitsch. Blissfully unaware of his family&#x27;s embarrassment by his behavior, he took pride in his self-assessed ability to fix anything in record time, and carried on a tireless campaign against his neighbor&#x27;s rampaging bloodhounds. The film was a moderate box-office success and went on to become a classic holiday film in the years since its release.

McGavin appeared (uncredited at his own request) in 1984&#x27;s &quot;The Natural&quot; as a shady gambler, and appeared on a Christmas episode (&quot;Midnight of the Century&quot;) of &quot;Millennium&quot;, playing the long-estranged father of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen). In 1986, he took a part in John Irvin&#x27;s &quot;Raw Deal&quot;, alongside then-rising star Arnold Schwarzenegger; McGavin plays a long time FBI officer who enlists a former colleague to help him unmask a mole within the Bureau working for a Chicago mob family. He won a CableACE Award (for the 1991 TV movie &quot;Clara&quot;) and received a 1990 Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Guest Star in a Comedy Series on &quot;Murphy Brown&quot;, in which he played Murphy&#x27;s father, Bill. From 1993 to 1994, he appeared in an off-Broadway production of Tom Dudzick&#x27;s holiday comedy &quot;Greetings!&quot;, performed in numerous popular productions in regional and community theaters nationwide.

McGavin co-starred with Adam Sandler in &quot;Billy Madison&quot; (1995), playing the titular character&#x27;s hotel-magnate father. In 1998, McGavin was asked to play the role of Arthur Dales in &quot;The X-Files&quot;, and appeared in two episodes between then and 1999. McGavin also narrated a number of audiobooks, notably the Robert Ludlum Jason Bourne Trilogy and John D. MacDonald&#x27;s Travis McGee series.

==Personal life==
McGavin was married three times. He first married Anita Marie Williams in 1942. He later married Melanie York in March 1944; their marriage ended in divorce in 1969, and produced four children. His third marriage was to actress Kathie Browne in December 1969, ending with her death in 2003.

McGavin was a staunch liberal and an active Democrat.

In 1960, McGavin purchased an Alexander home in the Racquet Club Estates neighborhood of Palm Springs, California.

== Death ==
McGavin died on February 25, 2006, of cardiovascular disease in a Los Angeles hospital, aged 83. He is interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Wife Kathie Browne-McGavin is buried at another local cemetery just 6 miles away at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills) in Los Angeles County, California.

<text>Uraeotyphlus is a genus of caecilians in the family Ichthyophiidae. There are seven species in this genus, all of which are endemic to the Western Ghats of southwestern India. Previously, the genus has also been placed in its own monotypic family Uraeotyphlidae.

==Description==
&quot;Uraeotyphlus&quot; are relatively small sized caecilians ranging from to in length. Unlike the more &#x27;advanced&#x27; caecilians, members of this genus have a true tail with vertebrae, and their skull has a relatively complex structure. However, unlike the more &#x27;primitive&#x27; caecilians, the mouth is recessed below the snout, there are no tertiary annuli, and the tentacular opening are far forward of the eyes, and below the nostril.

The pattern of annulation among species of &quot;Uraeotyphlus&quot; falls into two clear types based on the differentiation of primary and higher-order annuli, and the number of annular divisions per vertebra and whether this varies along the body. This difference is reflected in the recognition of &quot;U. oxyurus&quot; group (&quot;U. interruptus, U. menoni, U. narayani, U. oxyurus&quot;) and the &quot;U. malabaricus&quot; group (&quot;U. malabaricus&quot; and &quot;U. oommeni&quot;).

==Ecology and reproduction==
They are burrowing animals, which lay eggs that hatch into free-living larvae.

==Species==
The genus contains seven species:
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus gansi&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus interruptus&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus malabaricus&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus menoni&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus narayani&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus oommeni&quot; 
* &quot;Uraeotyphlus oxyurus&quot;

<doc id="932407" wikidata="Q162458" url="?curid=932407" title="Beyond the Sea (2004 film)">
<text>Beyond the Sea is a 2004 American biographical musical drama film based on the life of singer-actor Bobby Darin. Starring in the lead role and using his own singing voice for the musical numbers, Kevin Spacey co-wrote, directed, and co-produced the film, which takes its title from Darin&#x27;s song of the same title.

&quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; depicts Darin&#x27;s rise to success in both the music and film industry during the 1950s and 1960s as well as his marriage to Sandra Dee, portrayed by Kate Bosworth.

As early as 1986, Barry Levinson intended to direct a film based on the life of Darin, and he began pre-production on the project in early 1997. When he eventually vacated the director&#x27;s position, Spacey, along with Darin&#x27;s son Dodd, acquired the film rights.

Filming for &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; took place from November 2003 to January 2004. It was released in December 2004 to mixed reviews from critics and bombed at the box office. Dodd Darin, Sandra Dee and former Darin manager Steve Blauner responded with enthusiastic feedback to Spacey&#x27;s work on the film. Despite a number of negative reviews, some critics praised Spacey&#x27;s performance, largely because of his decision to use his own singing voice. He received a Golden Globe nomination.

==Plot==
Rather than providing a straightforward biography, the film weaves fantasy sequences with scenes containing somewhat fictionalized accounts of events in Darin&#x27;s life, and throughout it, the adult singer interacts with his younger self. It chronicles his determination to rise from his working-class roots as Walden Robert Cassotto, a frail boy from The Bronx plagued by multiple bouts of rheumatic fever, who becomes a singer more famous than Frank Sinatra. To achieve that goal, he forms a band and struggles to find gigs at any nightclub that will hire him.

His agent gets Darin a recording contract with Atlantic Records, where the singer enjoys teen idol success with &quot;Splish Splash&quot;. Not wanting to limit his appeal to rock and roll audiences, he changes his niche to big band singing and recording major hits, such as &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;. To capitalize on his popularity with teenage and young adult audiences, Darin is cast in &quot;Come September&quot; opposite Sandra Dee. He falls in love with the 18-year-old actress; determined to marry her, he romantically seduces and enchants her with songs like &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; and &quot;Dream Lover&quot;.They elope, angering her mother. Darin finally realizes his own mother&#x27;s dream when he is signed to appear at the famed Copacabana nightclub in Manhattan.

As success takes him on the road and away from home, Dee begins to drink heavily, and the couple fights frequently. Eventually, they separate and later reconcile. She gives birth to a son, Dodd. To his actress wife&#x27;s chagrin, Darin is nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as a shell shocked soldier in &quot;Captain Newman, M.D.&quot;

In the late 1960s, Darin becomes involved in the campaign to elect Robert F. Kennedy for President and contemplates a political career of his own. His sister Nina, knowing his past will be investigated closely if Bobby opts to enter the political arena, shocks him with the news his beloved mother actually was his grandmother and that he is Nina&#x27;s illegitimate child, the son of a father she cannot identify.

Devastated, Darin becomes a recluse living in a trailer on the Big Sur coast in California. He finds himself out of step with changing music trends, and when he tries to adapt by incorporating folk music and protest songs into his repertoire, he finds himself rejected by the audience that once embraced him. Undaunted, he stages a show, complete with a gospel choir, at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas, and against all odds, it is a huge success.

However, his triumph is short-lived. Suffering from blood poisoning following surgery to repair his mechanical heart valve, Darin is rushed to the hospital, where he dies at the age of 37. Following his death, he meets the younger counterpart of himself once again, and the two duet with &quot;As Long as I&#x27;m Singing&quot;.

* John Goodman as Stephen Blauner, Bobby&#x27;s dedicated talent manager. Blauner later becomes a successful film producer with movies such as &quot;The King of Marvin Gardens&quot; (1972) and &quot;Drive, He Said&quot; (1971).
* Brenda Blethyn as Polly Cassotto, Bobby&#x27;s biological maternal grandmother, who teaches him music as a child.

Cathy Moriarty-Gentile and Vanessa Redgrave were originally cast in &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, but both actresses dropped out for unspecified reasons.

==Development==
===Barry Levinson===
Beginning in 1986, Barry Levinson intended to produce and direct a biopic based on the life of Darin with funding from his own production company, Baltimore Pictures. With writer Lewis Colick, Levinson pitched the idea to Warner Bros. Pictures, who agreed to co-finance &quot;The Bobby Darin Story&quot; and cover distribution duties. Producer Arthur Friedman, a fan of Darin&#x27;s work, began to laboriously negotiate for crucial music licensing rights with Darin&#x27;s ex-wife, Sandra Dee; his son, Dodd; and former manager Steve Blauner. Colick wrote the first draft in 1987 before Warner Bros. and Levinson commissioned rewrites from Paul Attanasio and Paul Schrader. Their scripts, which kept &quot;The Bobby Darin Story&quot; title, concentrated on Sandra Dee&#x27;s alcoholism and childhood molestation by her stepfather. David Gershenson, Darin&#x27;s longtime friend, publicist and manager, joined the project as a historical consultant. Tom Cruise was reportedly under consideration to portray Darin.

Meanwhile, in May 1994, Warner Bros. optioned Dodd Darin&#x27;s book, &quot;Dream Lovers&quot; (). James Toback and Lorenzo Carcaterra were hired to rewrite Attanasio&#x27;s &quot;The Bobby Darin Story&quot;, which they retitled &quot;Dreamer&quot; in an attempt to incorporate the information present in Dodd Darin&#x27;s &quot;Dream Lovers&quot;. Toback&#x27;s script heavily focused on Darin&#x27;s childhood rheumatic fever and lifelong struggle with heart disease. It also followed the previous Attanasio and Schrader scripts. Carcaterra&#x27;s detailed research included Darin&#x27;s music records, home videos, early television clips, authorized and unauthorized biographies, newspaper articles and magazine interviews. &quot;I decided to meet with a lot of real-life people associated with Bobby Darin until [Levinson] said it was taking the focus off of Bobby,&quot; Carcaterra explained. As a result, some of the writer&#x27;s favorite scenes, including a Las Vegas confrontation with Elvis Presley, were omitted from his third and final draft, which came in at a lengthy 164 pages.

Beginning in 1994, Kevin Spacey first offered his services to portray Bobby Darin, but the filmmakers believed the actor was too old. Around then, Spacey coincidentally performed the cover version of Darin&#x27;s &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; for the soundtrack of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. The actor explained that after 1994, &quot;at least three times a year, my manager would call over to Warner Bros. and say, &#x27;Hey, what&#x27;s happening with that Bobby Darin movie? You guys ever going to make it?&#x27;&quot;

With filming to originally begin in late 1997, pre-production for &quot;Dreamer&quot; was commencing, and Levinson began to discuss the film with various actors, including Johnny Depp as Bobby Darin, Drew Barrymore as Sandra Dee, Bette Midler as Darin&#x27;s birth mother Nina and Bruno Kirby as Nina&#x27;s husband/Darin&#x27;s right-hand man, Charlie Mafia. Levinson eventually vacated the director&#x27;s position in favor of &quot;Liberty Heights&quot; (1999); because he was unable to get &quot;Dreamer&quot; into production, Warner Bros. lost the music licensing rights, which reverted to the Darin estate.

===Kevin Spacey===
In March 1999, Dick Clark Productions announced their teaming with Dodd Darin on a biopic, with collaboration from producer Arthur Friedman, who had been developing both &quot;The Bobby Darin Story&quot; and &quot;Dreamer&quot; with Levinson at Warner Bros. since 1986. Shortly afterwards, Spacey was in discussions with Dodd Darin to star in the lead role. Spacey was able to acquire the film rights from Warner Bros. in early 2000. With the help of Dodd Darin, the actor also received exclusive music rights for no charge. With his Academy Award-winning performance in &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) - which featured a number of Darin&#x27;s songs, Paramount Pictures became interested in distributing/financing &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. The deal fell apart when Paramount told Spacey that he was too old for the role and instead wanted Leonardo DiCaprio. Beginning in October 2000, Spacey took vocal training lessons from Darin collaborator Roger Kellaway to give an accurate portrayal of the singer.

Spacey also kept close relations with the Darin family as a means to know he would treat the film &quot;with respect.&quot; He sent letters to that effect to Sandra Dee and son Dodd. Steve Blauner (who is portrayed by John Goodman in the film) also served as a historical consultant. Dodd originally considered Spacey&#x27;s plan to sing his father&#x27;s material a sacrilege but eventually fell into sync with Spacey&#x27;s deeply empathetic approach to Darin&#x27;s life.

Tom Epperson, who had struck up a friendship with Spacey while writing an early screenplay draft of &quot;The Shipping News&quot;, was hired to write a new draft for &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. Epperson&#x27;s script included Darin&#x27;s penchant for orgies after his divorce with Sandra Dee. Spacey, finding the Epperson script to be overtly dark and morbid, began to rewrite &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, incorporating info from the 1987 Lewis Colick script. Spacey acknowledged he portrayed Darin too sympathetically and decided not to depict the darker side of Darin&#x27;s life centrally. &quot;The other scripts made Bobby [Darin] a rather unlikable figure,&quot; he explained. &quot;I was not interested in making a conventional biopic, as you can see from the results. I was interested in making an exuberant celebration of an entertainer in a way that would be uplifting for an audience.&quot;

By making the biopic, Dodd Darin and Spacey acknowledged the similar career experiences between Darin and Spacey. &quot;A lot of people doubted my dad&#x27;s abilities, and Kevin&#x27;s had doubters and naysayers,&quot; Dodd commented. &quot;But both [men] were willing to take risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin&#x27;s career is similar.&quot; David Evanier, author of &quot;Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin&quot; (), said &quot;You can put Kevin&#x27;s obsessiveness about getting the film made right up there with Bobby&#x27;s obsessiveness. He&#x27;s also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby&#x27;s intensity and dark side. Also, there&#x27;s the connection with his mother. Bobby&#x27;s mother&#x27;s belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin&#x27;s mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother.&quot;

&quot;I think the movie is about mothers and sons,&quot; Spacey said, referring to Darin&#x27;s relationship with his mother Polly and sister Nina. Spacey&#x27;s mother, Kathleen Fowler, died of brain cancer just before production started, as such, the film is dedicated in her memory, with the text &quot;for Mom&quot;, being displayed before the credits. &quot;I made the movie for all mothers, but especially for my mother. She introduced me to Bobby Darin. When she got very ill in 2002, I stopped everything and took care of her. We constantly played Bobby Darin records, and I&#x27;d let her listen to the tracks I was recording. I&#x27;m glad she passed knowing this was the movie I was going to make.&quot; After his award-winning performances in &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;, Spacey &quot;chose to move away from dark, sarcastic characters, and instead play damaged but good-hearted men&quot; in films like &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;, &quot;K-PAX&quot; and &quot;The Shipping News&quot;. The actor was criticized for his career move; Spacey acknowledged the similarities when Darin integrated folk music and protest songs.

===Production===
In February 2003, it was announced that production for &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; was becoming fast tracked with Spacey as lead actor, co-writer, producer and director, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) agreed to cover distribution duties in North America. In August, with principal photography to begin in just weeks, MGM dropped out as distributor and main financier over scheduling conflicts. To accumulate financing of the film&#x27;s $25 million budget, which came from foreign production companies, Spacey performed six songs at the November 2003 American Film Market. Lions Gate Entertainment quickly picked up the distribution duties, and Spacey found enough investors from England and Germany to continue moving forward on production.

In addition, Spacey declined to be paid for his work as actor, director, co-writer, and producer on &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. A portion of the $25 million budget came from his own Trigger Street Productions. Producer Arthur Friedman, who had shepherded the biopic since 1987, commented that he and Spacey experienced creative differences during pre-production. Friedman remarked that he was not involved with &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; once production began in Germany. Filming was originally set to begin in June 2003 before it was pushed to November 7, 2003, lasting until late January 2004. Eighty percent of &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; was shot using sound stages at Babelsberg Studios in Germany and Pinewood Studios in England. Lulworth Cove, Dorset, South West England doubled for Darin&#x27;s setting of reclusiveness in Big Sur, California. In an attempt to convincingly portray Darin, particularly during the early stages of the singer&#x27;s life depicted in the film, Spacey hired prosthetic makeup designer Peter King from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy.

==Music==
The soundtrack album features 18 tracks performed by Kevin Spacey.

==Release==
===Marketing===
To promote &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, Spacey and Phil Ramone devised a 12-city United States concert tour titled &quot;An Evening Celebrating the Music of Bobby Darin&quot;, which consisted of Spacey performing with a 19-piece band. &quot;It&#x27;s me singing Bobby and talking about Bobby and talking a little bit about the movie,&quot; Spacey explained in June 2004. Spacey dressed in costumes from the movie for the tour, which started in San Francisco and traveled through Los Angeles, New York City, Boston, Chicago, Miami and Atlantic City before ending in the Wayne Newton Theatre at the Stardust Hotel in Las Vegas. Spacey&#x27;s performance at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel on December 11, 2004, received a standing ovation. Dodd Darin commented, &quot;It was said about my dad that he had some big brass ones. To do a film about my dad is one thing, but it&#x27;s another thing to go out and attempt to work a nightclub. Kevin&#x27;s got a lot of courage. I think he sounds good.&quot; The film was shown and promoted at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 11, 2004.

===WGA arbitration===
Beginning in October 2004, the Writers Guild of America, West conducted arbitration to determine writing credit for the scripts that had been written since Barry Levinson, who developed the film at Warner Bros. in 1987, left the project. Lewis Colick, James Toback and Tom Epperson disassociated themselves for credit by the WGA. The Guild justified credit to Colick, who wrote the first draft of &quot;The Bobby Darin Story&quot; in 1987, and Kevin Spacey. Actor-writer Jeffrey Meek believed he deserved credit; he was paid $85,000 of a promised $125,000 to settle his claim.

Spacey said Meek was &quot;not a hired writer&quot; on &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;. &quot;He turned in a draft, but it was a draft based on earlier material based on my own screenplays,&quot; Spacey said. Meek said he was hired by producer Harvey Friedman, a friend who helped connect him with Spacey, and whom supports his claim to have produced 12 drafts, including one that was reported by &quot;Variety&quot; to have been greenlighted by MGM in early 2003. &quot;He bought my material and then acted like I didn&#x27;t exist,&quot; Meek explained. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m Rembrandt, but it&#x27;s like someone buying a painting and then scratching the name off of it and putting their own there.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===

&quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Based on 147 reviews collected by &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;, 42% of the critics gave the film a positive review, with an average score of 5.2/10. Its consensus states &quot;Kevin Spacey&#x27;s bio of singer Bobby Darin is either a fearless piece of showmanship or an embarrassing vanity project, according to critics.&quot; &quot;Metacritic&quot; calculated a weighted average score of 46/100, based on 35 reviews.

Sandra Dee, Dodd Darin, Jimmy Scalia and Steve Blauner responded enthusiastically to Spacey&#x27;s work on the film. Mick LaSalle of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; felt that Spacey looked too old to portray Darin convincingly and called the film &quot;one of the most embarrassing spectacles of 2004&quot; and &quot;jaw-droppingly awful, a misbegotten and ill-conceived vanity project.&quot; Desson Thomson from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the actor&#x27;s work, but also felt Spacey did not convincingly portray Darin in his early music career. Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the storyline to be overtly clichéd, but added, &quot;Despite the choppy narrative and inappropriate casting of Spacey, &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; managed to keep me entertained.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave a largely positive review, stating, &quot;Kevin Spacey believes he was born to play Bobby Darin. I believe he was born to play more interesting characters... In his own best work, Spacey has achieved genius; he is better as an actor than Darin ever was as a singer.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt that &quot;with &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot;, Spacey crawls back from his doomed quest to be a Tom Hanks-like everyman to his niche on the underbelly of Hollywood&#x27;s pantheon. The movie&#x27;s a mess, and at 45, Spacey is far too old to play Darin. Yet the star captures his desperation, his braggadocio, and yes, his magnetism.&quot; Peter Travers, writing in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, believed Spacey could not prevent &quot;the movie from groaning under the weight of biopic clichés. But the actor forges a bond with his subject that rights all wrongs. Doing his own singing (an uncanny imitation), Spacey is a marvel.&quot;

===Box office===
The film opened in limited release in the United States on December 17, 2004, and went into wider release on December 29. It grossed $6,318,709 in the US and $2,128,906 in international markets for a total worldwide box office of $8,447,615. It was declared a box office bomb because it did not make back its $25 million budget.

===Accolades===

Spacey was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy but lost to Jamie Foxx for &quot;Ray&quot;. He and Phil Ramone were also nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, but lost to the producers of &quot;Ray&quot;.

==Home media==
On June 7, 2005, the film was released on DVD in widescreen anamorphic format for Region 1 markets. It features two Dolby Digital English audio tracks (one in 2.0 Stereo and the other in 5.1 Surround Sound), director&#x27;s commentary by Spacey, and a making-of featurette.

<text>Henana of Adiabene (died 610) was a Christian theologian, and headmaster of the School of Nisibis, the main theological center of the Church of the East (571–610).

==Biography==
Before he became headmaster, Henana of Adiabene had occupied the chair of biblical exegesis. His teacher was a certain Moses, who was probably an Eastern Orthodox Christian. Many of Henana&#x27;s ideas were close to Byzantine theology, and his appointment as head of the school might have been in line with a general uneasiness with pro-Antiochene theological discourse, previously set by the Synod of Beth Lapat (484). His predecessor headmaster was Abraham of Beth Rabban, who had worked hard to promote the Antiochene theology of Theodore of Mopsuestia.

Henana was a humble man, worked tirelessly, and stood to his convictions. Under his leadership the school initially continued to grow. He wrote extensive commentaries and other works, but only two works and a number of citations have been preserved. A speech for the commencement of the academic year from the time when Henana was director has survived, and in it Henana is described as the equal of Theodore in productivity, and with the authority to choose the best from among all traditions. However, Henana did not reconcile the teaching of Theodore with the other creeds; he tried to replace him.

===Christological dispute===
Theodore of Mopsuestia held that union of Christ′s two natures (divine and human) is manifested as a prosopic union. Henana on the other hand favored the concept of a hypostatic union of the two natures, as specified by the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Accordingly, he believed in God&#x27;s suffering on the Cross, impossible without a hypostatic union between the two natures. Those christological controversies were reflected in a debate between pro-Chalcedonian supporters of &quot;one-&quot;qnoma&quot;&quot; Christology and pro-Antiochene supporters of &quot;two-&quot;qnome&quot;&quot; Christology (qnoma, a Syriac term, translated as &quot;hypostasis&quot;). The divide between two groups was worsened by interventions on the part of West Syriac miaphysites.

Henana&#x27;s one-&quot;qnoma&quot; theology was attacked by Babai the Great, whose criticism of Henana&#x27;s views was generally accepted by the Church of the East, though Henana remained a significant influence in the Church&#x27;s subsequent tradition of interpretation.

Henana accepted the decisions of the Council of Ephesus (431), believing that the term &#x27;mother of God&#x27; was appropriate for the Virgin Mary. Theodore of Mopsuestia had taught that man was created mortal. Henana believed that Adam was initially immortal, and that he became mortal through sin. It also appears that Henana rejected Theodore&#x27;s idea that the book of Job was a book of fiction composed by a Hellenist, and rejected his commentary on Job.

Henana&#x27;s pro-Byzantine orientation was so prominent that he was accused by his opponents for possible tendencies towards Origenism, a theological position that was popular among some Byzantine monks, but disputed and finally condemned in 553. One of the more extreme positions held by the followers of Origen was the denial of the resurrection of the body of the Lord on the third day. This clashed head on with any literal interpretation of scripture, certainly with the rigorous literal interpretation of the Antiochene type.

===Growing opposition===
As Henana&#x27;s break with tradition became more open, opposition grew. In Nisibis, the Deacon Elijah established the rival school of Beth Sahde, and made a man from the school of Balad director, who had also lived on the monastery of Mt. Izla and was a disciple of Abraham the Great of Kashkar. His name was Abimelek, and his great opponent Babai the Great later glorified him in a biography of &#x27;The Priest and Martyr Abimelek&#x27;.

In 596 Sabrisho, an alumnus of the school of Nisibis, was appointed successor of Ishoʿyahb I as Catholicos. He immediately held a synod and anathematized the opponents of Theodore, though he did not mention Henana explicitly. At the same time or sometimes after, Gregory, another alumnus of the school of Nisibis, became Metropolitan of Nisibis, probably chosen by Sabrisho. Gregory first reproached and censored, later condemned the writings of Henana. Henana wrote a defense to Sabrisho that resulted in his excommunication by the other bishops.

But Henana was not without protection: Queen Shirin was a convert from the Church of the East to the Syriac Orthodox Church, and so was Gabriel of Shiggar, the influential royal physician. They supported Henana. As Babai the Great reports: &#x27;the medical science at the court had taken sides with Henana. This tilted the scales in favor of Henana and upset the carefully prepared strategy of his enemies. Of course, all this was clear to Sabrisho.&#x27;

In 601 Bishop Gregory had to leave and was ordered by the king to live in the monastery of Shahdost. The Catholicos disagreed with the excommunication and was spared the royal
wrath. But Henana&#x27;s position could not be saved. Even though he stayed head of the school, 300 souls left the same year. (There is some doubt on when exactly these events took place. 
But all sources agree that they happened under the Catholicos Sabrisho).

Some of the exiles went to the monastery of Mar Abraham on Mt. Izla, others were welcomed by Marcos, bishop of Balad, at his school. Still others went to the rival school-monastery of Beth Sahde in Nisibis itself. Only 20 persons stayed with Henana, and the school hardly struggled on.

===Legacy===
Two years after the death of Henana, the teachings of Theodore were canonized by an episcopal gathering, and the Christology of Theodore became the official doctrine of the Church.

Of the many writings of Henana very little has been preserved, and the Church of the East has
rejected him. But in order to refute him, Babai the Great clarified the Christology of the 
Church of the East, which otherwise might not have happened.

<text>The Scolecomorphidae (from , &#x27;wormlike&#x27; and , &#x27;form&#x27;) are a family of caecilians also known as tropical caecilians, buried-eyed caecilians, or African caecilians. They are found in Cameroon in West Africa, and Malawi and Tanzania in East Africa. Caecilians are legless amphibians which superficially resemble worms or snakes.

Scolecomorphids have only vestigial eyes, which are attached to the base of a pair of tentacles underneath the snout. Unlike other caecilians, they have only primary annuli; these are grooves running incompletely around the body, giving the animal a segmented appearance. All other caecilians have a complex pattern of grooves, with secondary or tertiary annuli present. Also uniquely amongst tetrapods, the scolecomorphids lack a stapes bone in the middle ear.

At least some species of scolecomorphids give birth to live young, retaining the eggs inside the females&#x27; bodies until they hatch into fully formed offspring, without the presence of a free-living larval stage.

== Taxonomy ==
Just six species of scolecomorphids are known, grouped into two genera, as follows:

Family Scolecomorphidae
* Genus Crotaphatrema Nussbaum, 1985 
** &quot;Crotaphatrema bornmuelleri&quot; , Bornmuller&#x27;s caecilian, Cameroon 
** &quot;Crotaphatrema lamottei&quot; , Mont Oku caecilian, Cameroon 
** &quot;Crotaphatrema tchabalmbaboensis&quot; , Cameroon 
* Genus Scolecomorphus Boulenger, 1883
** &quot;Scolecomorphus kirkii&quot; , Kirk&#x27;s caecilian or Lake Tanganyika caecilian, East Africa 
** &quot;Scolecomorphus uluguruensis&quot; , Uluguru black caecilian or Nyingwa caecilian, Tanzania 
** &quot;Scolecomorphus vittatus&quot; , ribbon caecilian or banded caecilian, Tanzania

<doc id="932424" wikidata="Q556933" url="?curid=932424" title="A Christmas Story">
<text>A Christmas Story is a 1983 Christmas comedy film directed by Bob Clark and based on the 1966 book &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot; by Jean Shepherd, with some elements from his 1971 book &quot;Wanda Hickey&#x27;s Night of Golden Memories and Other Disasters&quot;. It stars Melinda Dillon, Darren McGavin, and Peter Billingsley, and follows a young boy and his family&#x27;s misadventures during Christmas time in December 1940. It is the third installment in the Parker Family Saga.

&quot;A Christmas Story&quot; was released on November 18, 1983, and received positive reviews from critics. Filmed partly in Canada, the film earned two Canadian Genie Awards in 1984. Widely considered a holiday classic in the United States and Canada, it has been shown in a marathon annually on TNT since 1997 and on TBS since 2004 titled &quot;24 Hours of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;&quot;, consisting of 12 consecutive airings of the film from the evening of Christmas Eve to the evening of Christmas Day. In 2012, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film spawned three sequels. The first, &quot;My Summer Story&quot; (originally released as &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;), also directed by Clark, was released in 1994. The second, entitled &quot;A Christmas Story 2&quot;, was released straight to DVD in 2012. A third sequel, entitled &quot;A Christmas Story Christmas&quot;, was released on HBO Max in 2022 and features most of the original cast returning.

==Plot==

The film is presented in a series of vignettes, with narration provided by the adult Ralphie Parker. As a 9-year-old boy living in Northwest Indiana in December 1940, all Ralphie wants for Christmas is a Red Ryder Carbine Action 200-shot Range Model air rifle. Ralphie&#x27;s desire is continuously rejected, first by his mother, who tells him &quot;You&#x27;ll shoot your eye out.&quot; He is later assigned a theme for school about what he wants for Christmas, and he writes about the BB gun, but he gets it back with a poor grade, and the same warning. Finally, on Christmas Eve, Ralphie sees a disgruntled Santa at Higbee&#x27;s Department Store, and he expresses his desire, only to be hurriedly brushed off with the same warning.

On Christmas morning, Ralphie receives some presents that he enjoys but is disappointed not to find the rifle among them. Ralphie&#x27;s father (&quot;The Old Man&quot;) directs him to one last box hidden in the corner, which proves to contain the rifle. Ralphie eagerly hurries outside to try it out, but when he shoots at the metal target he has set up, the BB ricochets and knocks off his glasses. Ralphie accidentally steps on and breaks the glasses while trying to find them; he makes up a cover story about an icicle falling from the roof of the garage and hitting his eye, which fools his mom and keeps him from getting in trouble.

That night, Ralphie goes to sleep with the gun by his side, as his adult self reflects that it was the best Christmas present he had ever received or would ever receive.

===Other vignettes===
Interspersed with the main story are several loosely related vignettes involving the Parkers:

* The Old Man fights a never-ending battle with the malfunctioning furnace in the Parker home. His frustrations cause him to swear profusely (heard as gibberish in the film), leading Ralphie to suspect a cloud of profanity &quot;is still hanging in space over Lake Michigan&quot;. 
* Ralphie&#x27;s friends, Flick and Schwartz, argue about whether or not a tongue will stick to metal in the winter. Schwartz issues a &quot;triple dog dare&quot; for Flick to put his tongue on the schoolyard flagpole; when Flick does so, he indeed becomes stuck and has to be pulled loose by the fire department and police. Flick refuses to name who put him up to the stunt, leaving Miss Shields to give an indirect telling-off to Ralphie and Schwartz without handing down any punishment and then drop the matter.
* The Old Man is delighted when he wins a &quot;major award&quot; in a newspaper contest – a table lamp in the shape of a woman&#x27;s leg wearing a fishnet stocking. Mrs. Parker dislikes it, and the ensuing &quot;Battle of the Lamp&quot; ends with her &quot;accidentally&quot; breaking it, much to the Old Man&#x27;s fury. Unable to fix it, the Old Man quietly buries it in the backyard.
* Ralphie eagerly checks the mail each day for a secret decoder pin, which he earned through a promotion Ovaltine and the &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; radio show were running. When the pin finally arrives, Ralphie frantically decodes the secret message delivered by show announcer Pierre Andre. But he is disappointed to discover the message is merely an advertisement for Ovaltine: &quot;Be sure to drink your Ovaltine&quot;.
* While unsuccessfully helping The Old Man change a blown tire, Ralphie accidentally utters a profanity and gets his mouth washed out with Lifebuoy soap as a punishment. When his mother demands to know where he heard it, Ralphie blames Schwartz instead of admitting that he picked it up from the Old Man. That night, he fantasizes about making his parents sorry, by becoming blind from soap poisoning.
* Ralphie, his brother Randy, and Flick and Schwartz are tormented by the neighborhood bullies Scut Farkus and Grover Dill. Ralphie eventually snaps and attacks Farkus, unleashing a stream of vulgar gibberish similar to the Old Man&#x27;s. Mrs. Parker halts him mid-fight and escorts him home; Ralphie and Randy expect The Old Man to &quot;kill&quot; Ralphie when he finds out, but Mrs. Parker downplays the fight and distracts The Old Man by talking about a football game, earning Ralphie&#x27;s appreciation. 
* Ralphie is dismayed to receive an embarrassing pink bunny footed sleeper from his infantilizing Aunt Clara. Mrs. Parker forces him to try it on and thinks it&#x27;s adorable, but The Old Man calls it &quot;a pink nightmare&quot; and allows Ralphie to take it off. Mrs. Parker agrees to only have Ralphie wear it when Aunt Clara visits.
* The Old Man is frequently chased by a pack of &quot;at least 785 smelly hound dogs&quot; owned by the Bumpus family, the Parkers&#x27; hillbilly neighbors. On Christmas Day, the dogs ruin the Parkers&#x27; dinner by romping through their kitchen and eating their turkey, forcing the family to go to a Chinese restaurant to eat, where they enjoy an entertaining dinner of &quot;Chinese Turkey&quot;. The Bumpus family did live in Hammond, IN and are a real family as confirmed through Ancestory.com DNA records.

===Casting===
The basis of the screenplay is a series of monologues written and performed by Jean Shepherd on the radio. Shepherd wrote the adaptation with Bob Clark and Leigh Brown. Several subplots are incorporated into the body of the film, based on other separate short stories by Shepherd. Shepherd provides the film&#x27;s narration from the perspective of an adult Ralphie, a narrative style later used in the comedy-drama television series &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and the sitcom &quot;Young Sheldon&quot;. Shepherd, Brown, and Clark have cameo appearances in the film: Shepherd plays the man who directs Ralphie and Randy to the back of the Santa line at the department store; Brown – Shepherd&#x27;s wife in real life – plays the woman in the Santa line with Shepherd; Clark plays Swede, the neighbor the Old Man talks to outside during the Leg Lamp scene.

In the DVD commentary, director Bob Clark mentions that Jack Nicholson was considered for the role of the Old Man; Clark expresses gratitude that he ended up with Darren McGavin instead, who later appeared in several other Clark films. James Broderick, who had portrayed the role in the television films, had died the year prior. He cast Melinda Dillon on the basis of her similar role in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Some 8,000 actors auditioned for the role of Ralphie, among the 8,000 actors were Keith Coogan, Sean Astin and Wil Wheaton; &quot;He walked in, and he had us from the beginning&quot;, Clark later recalled of Peter Billingsley who was already a successful actor in commercials and from co-hosting the TV series &quot;Real People&quot;. Clark initially wanted him for the role of Ralphie but decided he was &quot;too obvious&quot; a choice and auditioned many other young actors before realizing that Billingsley was the right choice after all.

Ian Petrella was cast immediately before filming began. Tedde Moore had previously appeared in Clark&#x27;s film &quot;Murder by Decree&quot; and was the only onscreen character from &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; who was played by the same actor in the sequel, &quot;My Summer Story&quot;. Jeff Gillen was an old friend of Clark&#x27;s who had been in one of his earliest films. The schoolyard bully, Scut Farkus, was played by Zack Ward, now an actor, writer and director, who had actually been bullied himself while in elementary school. In 2017, he said he was surprised at the impact his role had over the years: &quot;I saw that I was ranked – as Christmas villains go – higher than the Grinch. That&#x27;s amazing.&quot;

==Production==
The screenplay for &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; is based on material from author Jean Shepherd&#x27;s collection of short stories, &quot;In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash&quot;. Three of the semi-autobiographical short stories on which the film is based were originally published in &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine between 1964 and 1966. Shepherd later read &quot;Duel in the Snow, or Red Ryder nails the Cleveland Street Kid&quot; and told the otherwise unpublished story &quot;Flick&#x27;s Tongue&quot; on his WOR Radio talk show, as can be heard in one of the DVD extras. Bob Clark stated on the DVD commentary that he became interested in Shepherd&#x27;s work when he heard &quot;Flick&#x27;s Tongue&quot; on the radio in 1968. Additional source material for the film, according to Clark, came from unpublished anecdotes that Shepherd told live audiences &quot;on the college circuit&quot;. While shooting scenes in Cleveland in early 1983, Clark told a reporter that it had taken him a considerable number of years to get the film into production. Shepherd envisioned his stories as &quot;Dickens&#x27;s Christmas Carol as retold by Scrooge&quot;, although Clark would soften it for the film; the two did not particularly get along, as Clark did not admire Shepherd&#x27;s attempts at trying to guide the actors with ideas about how the characters should be played, to the point where he had him barred from the set.

===Locations===
The film is set in Hohman, Indiana, a fictionalized version of Shepherd&#x27;s hometown of Hammond, the only Hoosier city to border Chicago. The name is derived from Hohman Avenue, a major street in downtown Hammond. Local references in the film include Warren G. Harding Elementary School and Cleveland Street (where Shepherd spent his childhood). Other local references include mention of a person &quot;swallowing a yo-yo&quot; in nearby Griffith, the Old Man being one of the fiercest &quot;furnace fighters in Northern Indiana&quot; and that his obscenities were &quot;hanging in space over Lake Michigan&quot;, a mention of the Indianapolis 500, and the line to Santa Claus &quot;stretching all the way to Terre Haute&quot;. The Old Man is also revealed to be a fan of the Bears (whom he jokingly calls the &quot;Chicago Chipmunks&quot;) and White Sox, consistent with living in northwest Indiana. In commemoration of the setting, the City of Hammond holds an annual exhibit regarding the film in November and December, including a statue recreating the scene where Ralphie&#x27;s friend Flick freezes his tongue to a flagpole.

Director Bob Clark reportedly sent scouts to twenty cities before selecting Cleveland for exterior filming. Cleveland was chosen because of Higbee&#x27;s Department Store in downtown Cleveland. Since Higbee&#x27;s was exclusive to northeast Ohio, the department store referred to in Shepherd&#x27;s book and the film is most likely Goldblatt&#x27;s, located in downtown Hammond (with the Cam-Lan Chinese Restaurant three doors down on Sibley Avenue). Until they connected with Higbee&#x27;s, location scouts had been unsuccessful in finding a department store that was willing to be part of the film. Higbee&#x27;s vice president Bruce Campbell agreed to take part in the project on the condition he be allowed to edit the script for cursing. Ultimately, Higbee&#x27;s was the stage for three scenes in the film:
*The opening scene in which Ralphie first spies the Red Ryder BB Gun in the store&#x27;s Christmas window display. Higbee&#x27;s was known for its elaborate, child-centered Christmas themes and decorations, with Santa Claus as the centerpiece.
*The parade scene, filmed just outside Higbee&#x27;s on Public Square. The parade was filmed late at night (3 a.m.) because during the daytime the newer Erieview Tower and Federal Building were visible from the Public Square, as was the BP Tower, which was under construction at the time.
* Ralphie and Randy&#x27;s visit to see Santa, which was filmed inside Higbee&#x27;s. The store kept the Santa slide that was made for the film and used it for several years after the film&#x27;s release. Higbee&#x27;s became Dillard&#x27;s in 1992 and closed permanently in 2002.

In addition to the scenes involving Higbee&#x27;s, the exterior shots (and select interior shots where Ralphie lived, including the opening of the leg lamp) of the house and neighborhood, were filmed in the Tremont section of Cleveland&#x27;s West Side. The house used as the Parker home in these scenes has been restored, reconfigured inside to match the soundstage interiors, and opened to the public as &quot;A Christmas Story House&quot;. Appropriately, the fictional boyhood home of Ralphie Parker is on Cleveland Street, the name of the actual street where Shepherd grew up.

Several other locations were used. The school scenes were shot at the Victoria School in St. Catharines, Ontario. The Christmas tree-purchasing scene was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, as was the sound stage filming of interior shots of the Parker home. The &quot;...only I didn&#x27;t say fudge&quot; scene was filmed at the foot of Cherry Street in Toronto; several lake freighters are visible in the background spending the winter at Toronto&#x27;s port, which lends authenticity to the time of year when the film was produced.

In 2008, two Canadian fans released a documentary that visits every location. Their film, &quot;Road Trip for Ralphie&quot;, was shot over two years and includes footage of the filmmakers saving Miss Shields&#x27; blackboard from the garbage bin on the day the old Victoria School was gutted for renovation, discovering the antique fire truck that saved Flick, locating original costumes from the film, and tracking down the location of the film&#x27;s Chop Suey Palace in Toronto.

===Red Ryder BB Gun===

The &quot;Red Ryder&quot; model BB Gun was manufactured in Plymouth, Michigan, by Daisy, beginning in 1938; it was never manufactured in the exact configuration mentioned in the film. The Daisy &quot;Buck Jones&quot; model did have a compass and a sundial in the stock, but these features were not included in the Red Ryder model. The compass and sundial were placed on Ralphie&#x27;s BB gun, but on the opposite side of the stock due to Peter Billingsley being left-handed.

===Dating the story===
Director Bob Clark stated in the film&#x27;s DVD commentary that both he and author Shepherd wished for the film to be seen as &quot;amorphously late-&#x27;30s, early-&#x27;40s&quot;. A specific year is never explicitly mentioned in the film. While the Lionel streamline model passenger train in Higbee&#x27;s window is a prewar item, the freight train in the same window is of postwar manufacture. The two songs by Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters used in the film, &quot;Jingle Bells&quot; and &quot;Santa Claus Is Comin&#x27; To Town&quot; were recorded in 1943, and the Crosby version of &quot;It&#x27;s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas&quot; also heard in the film, dates from 1951. &quot;Look&quot; magazine that Ralphie hides the Red Ryder ad in, is the December 1937 cover with Shirley Temple and Santa. Ralphie&#x27;s &quot;Little Orphan Annie&quot; Secret Society Decoder Pin bears the date 1940 (and is the real-life decoder pin released to society members that year, though by that time Ovaltine had ceased its sponsorship and Quaker was the primary sponsor of the series), the parade in front of Higbee&#x27;s features characters from MGM&#x27;s version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, which was released in 1939, a 1939 calendar is seen in one scene, and World War II, which the United States entered in December 1941, is never mentioned. The &quot;Old Man&#x27;s&quot; treasured Oldsmobile 6 is a 1937 Oldsmobile F-Series Touring Sedan. Although the director and author have said that the year has been obfuscated, some sources, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and CBS News, have dated the film to 1940 or the early 1940s.

The real Shepherd was several years older than Ralphie; Shepherd was intentionally dishonest about many of the details of his own life and regularly obscured the line between fact and fiction in his writings. A teacher called &quot;Miss Shields&quot; was Shepherd&#x27;s second-grade teacher at Warren G. Harding Elementary School in 1928. By 1939, Shepherd had already graduated from high school.

==Release==
Initially overlooked as a sleeper film, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; was released a week before Thanksgiving 1983 to moderate success, earning about $2 million in its first weekend. Film critics generally supported the film. Leonard Maltin proclaimed it &quot;a top screen comedy&quot;. Gene Siskel gave it 3 stars, calling it a &quot;delightful motion picture&quot;, with &quot;delightful characters and performances&quot;, but opined that it was &quot;doomed to box office failure&quot; for being released too early in the holiday season. Roger Ebert initially gave the film three stars out of four, but later awarded the film four stars and added the film to his &quot;Great Movies&quot; list. He suggested that the film only experienced modest success because holiday-themed films were not popular at the time. Vincent Canby&#x27;s mostly negative &quot;The New York Times&quot; review complained that &quot;the movie&#x27;s big comic pieces tend only to be exceedingly busy. Though Mr. Billingsley, Mr. Gavin [sic], Miss Dillon and the actress who plays Ralphie&#x27;s school teacher (Tedde Moore) are all very able, they are less funny than actors in a television situation comedy&quot;.

In Canada, the film would go on to win two categories in the 5th Genie Awards, for Director Bob Clark and Best Original Screenplay for the work of Leigh Brown, Bob Clark and Jean Shepherd.

By Christmas 1983, the film was no longer playing at most venues but remained in about a hundred theatres until January 1984. Gross earnings were just over $19.2 million. In December 1984, the film was re-released for a brief second theatrical run, coinciding with its home video release. Writer Glenn Lovell of &quot;Knight Ridder&quot; noted that after a year had passed, the film had &quot;caught on with critics and the public&quot;, and rather than unload the film to cable TV, MGM saw enough interest budding for a second run during the holiday season - this time much closer to and through the week of Christmas.

==Reception==
Over the years, the film&#x27;s critical reputation has grown considerably and it is regarded by some as one of the best films of 1983. By the late 1980s, it was already considered a classic. Based on 61 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall approval rating from critics of 89%, with an average score of 8.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Both warmly nostalgic and darkly humorous, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; deserves its status as a holiday perennial.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 77 out of 100, based on 16 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin awarded the film a four-star rating, calling the film &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;truly funny for kids and grown-ups alike&quot; with &quot;wonderful period flavor&quot;. In his book &quot;Have Yourself a Movie Little Christmas&quot;, critic Alonso Duralde lists &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; in his chapter of &quot;Christmas Classics&quot;.

Due to television airings and home video release, &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; has become widely popular and is now an annual Christmas special. The film was produced and released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). The rights to the film were acquired by Turner Entertainment Co. after Ted Turner&#x27;s purchase of MGM&#x27;s pre-1986 film library. Subsequently, Time Warner purchased Turner Entertainment in 1996 and currently holds rights to the film as Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD). On December 24, 2007, AOL ranked the film their #1 Christmas film of all time. IGN ranked the film the top holiday-themed film of all time. In 2012, a Marist Poll named the film the favorite holiday film in the US. In 2019, a poll commissioned by Tubitv and conducted by Onepoll also ranked the film Best Holiday Movie Ever. &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; received a nomination for Best Digital – Comedy, and won Best Digital – Animation/Family at the 2023 Golden Trailer Awards.

==Lawsuit==
In August 2011, Zack Ward, who played Scut Farkus in the film, sued Warner Bros. and Enesco over merchandising for the film after the company authorized a figure resembling his character from the film without his permission. It was revealed that when he signed on to play that character, he did not receive any merchandising rights because of a mishap with his contract. The lawsuit was dropped in January 2012 after Warner Bros. revealed that the figurine showed a &quot;generic face&quot; that has been used on them since 2006 and that the statute of limitations had run out.

In December 2012, Ward sued Warner Bros. again over his image after attending the annual &quot;Christmas Story&quot; charity fundraiser convention in Cleveland in November 2010, where a fan handed him a &quot;Christmas Story&quot; board game, playing cards, and calendar showing his face. The lawsuit was settled three days later.

==Broadcasting and home media release==
===Television===
The film first aired on television on premium cable networks The Movie Channel, HBO, and Showtime, as early as December 1985, followed by Cinemax in 1986. It was, however, reportedly rejected by the major networks NBC, CBS, and ABC for various reasons. As a result, it was instead offered to and aired by local stations in 1986–1987, and the film quickly began to attract a following. On December 16, 1987, the film premiered on SuperStation WTBS. In 1989 and 1990, TBS Superstation showed it on Thanksgiving night, while in 1991 and 1992, they aired it the night after.

Turner Broadcasting (as both an independent company and, from 1996 onward, as a subsidiary of the company presently operating as Warner Bros. Discovery) has maintained ownership of the broadcast rights, and since the mid-1990s, they have continued to air the film increasingly on both TBS and TNT throughout the holiday season annually. Turner Classic Movies has also aired the film many times, as has The CW in recent years. By 1995, it was aired on the three Turner networks a combined six times on December 24–26, and in 1996, it was aired eight times over four days, not including separate local channel airings.

The rerunning of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; on television made Shepherd wealthier than anything he had done for television, even before the day-long marathons began. He contrasted the constant reruns of the film with the ephemeral nature of his teleplays, which were seen once and then never again. He initially vowed never to work in television again once &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; became a perennial hit (both because of this phenomenon and a previous bad experience a decade prior with &quot;The Phantom of the Open Hearth&quot;); he reconsidered a few years later, noting the success of the film had allowed him more leverage to gain higher rights fees.

====24 Hours of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;====
Due to the increasing popularity of the film, in 1997, TNT began airing a 24-hour marathon dubbed &quot;24 Hours of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;&quot;, consisting of twelve consecutive showings of the film running from 8:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Christmas Eve until 8:00 p.m. on Christmas Day. This was in addition to various other airings on the network earlier in the month of December. In 2004, after TNT switched to a predominantly drama-centered programming format, sister network TBS, under its comedy-based &quot;Very Funny&quot; moniker, took over carriage of the marathon. Clark stated that, in 2002, an estimated 38.4 million people tuned into the marathon at one point or another, nearly one sixth of the country. TBS reported 45.4 million viewers in 2005, and 45.5 million in 2006. In 2007, new all-time ratings records were set, with the highest single showing (8:00 p.m. Christmas Eve) drawing 4.4 million viewers. Viewership increased again in 2008, with the 8:00 p.m. airing on Christmas Eve drawing 4.5 million viewers, the 10:00 p.m. airing drawing 4.3 million, and total viewership topping at 54.4 million. As of 2009, the film had been shown 250 times on the Turner family of networks.

In 2007, the marathon continued, and the original tradition was revived. TNT also aired the film twice the Sunday of Thanksgiving weekend (November 25). In 2009, the 24-hour marathon continued on TBS, for the 13th overall year, starting at 8:00 p.m. ET on Christmas Eve.

In 2009, the film aired on TBS during a 24-hour marathon on Christmas Eve. The first viewing at 8:00 p.m. ET on December 24 earned a 1.6 rating (18–49) and beat the major broadcast networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox). In 2010, the marathon averaged 3 million viewers, up 2% from the previous year, ranking TBS as the top cable network for the 24-hour period. The 10:00 a.m. airing on December 25 was seen by 4.4 million viewers, and the 8:00 p.m. airing on December 24 was close behind with 4.3 million viewers. The marathons in 2011 and 2012 continued to see increases in ratings.

Beginning with the 2014 edition of the marathon, Turner elected to simulcast it on both TNT and TBS, marking the first time since 2003 that TNT aired it as well as the first time the marathon was aired on multiple networks. The two networks staggered their airings one hour apart, with the TBS marathon beginning at 8:00 p.m. ET and the TNT marathon beginning at 9:00 p.m. ET. Both networks have run 24-hour marathons with the one-hour offset format from 2014 annually, making it a new tradition for both TBS and TNT networks. For 2019, a majority of the most-watched programs—13 out of the top 25—broadcast on cable Christmas Day were &quot;A Christmas Story&quot;.

In 2024, TBS aired the film in early December as part of their &quot;Dinner and a Movie&quot; series, this in addition to the marathon. Hosts Jason Biggs and Jenny Mollen were joined by Zack Ward.

===Subsequent screen adaptations and sequels===

The PBS series &quot;American Playhouse&quot; produced two subsequent television film adaptations featuring the same characters, also with Shepherd narrating: &quot;The Star-Crossed Romance of Josephine Cosnowski&quot; and &quot;Ollie Hopnoodle&#x27;s Haven of Bliss&quot;. The latter of these was set in the early 1950s with a now-teenaged Ralphie and his friends and family. Shepherd had previously created &quot;The Phantom of the Open Hearth&quot; and &quot;The Great American Fourth of July and Other Disasters&quot; for the same network.

A theatrical sequel involving Ralphie and his family, titled &quot;It Runs in the Family&quot;, was made in 1994. With the exceptions of Tedde Moore as Miss Shields (Ralphie&#x27;s teacher) and Jean Shepherd as the narrator (the voice of the adult Ralphie), it features an entirely different cast. It received a limited release before being retitled &quot;My Summer Story&quot; for home video and television release.

&quot;A Christmas Story 2&quot; is a direct sequel to the film, which ignores the references and events of &quot;My Summer Story&quot; and was released direct-to-video in 2012 and directed by Brian Levant. It was filmed in New Westminster, British Columbia, Canada.

Another sequel to the film, which ignores all previous sequels and is entitled &quot;A Christmas Story Christmas&quot;, was released in 2022. The film is directed by &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot; director Clay Kaytis and written by &quot;The Mule&quot; writer Nick Schenk (who is also executive producer of the film). Peter Billingsley reprised his role as Ralphie Parker, in addition serving as the film&#x27;s producer. The film was released via streaming on HBO Max by Warner Bros. Discovery Global Streaming &amp; Interactive Entertainment. It takes place in the 1970s following an adult Ralphie catching up with his old childhood friends. Ian Petrella, Scott Schwartz, R. D. Robb, and Zack Ward reprised their roles of Randy Parker, Flick, Schwartz, and Scut Farkus, respectively. Erinn Hayes, River Drosche, and Julianna Layne played Ralphie&#x27;s wife and his kids while Julie Hagerty played Mrs. Parker in a role originated by Melinda Dillon (who would die less than two months after the film was released in 2023) in the original film. The film is dedicated to the memory of Darren McGavin (who played &quot;The Old Man&quot; in the original film), who died on February 25, 2006.

====Stage adaptations====
In 2000, a stage play adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; was written by Philip Grecian.

In November 2012, &quot;A Christmas Story: The Musical&quot;, based on the film, opened on Broadway. Written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (music and lyrics) and Joseph Robinette (book), the musical opened to positive reviews. The run ended on December 30 the same year. The musical was directed by John Rando with choreography by Warren Carlyle and featured Dan Lauria as Jean Shepherd. The musical received Tony Award nominations for Best Musical, Best Book of a Musical (Robinette), and Best Original Score (Music or Lyrics) Written for the Theatre.

The musical was then adapted for television as the three hour &quot;A Christmas Story Live!&quot;, which aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 17, 2017. Reviews were mixed; on Rotten Tomatoes, the production received a 46% rating based on 13 critics&#x27; reviews.

<text>Dirk Jan Struik (September 30, 1894 – October 21, 2000) was a Dutch-born American (since 1934) mathematician, historian of mathematics, and Marxist theoretician who spent most of his life in the U.S.

== Early life ==
Dirk Jan Struik was born in 1894 in Rotterdam, Netherlands. His father Hendrik Jan Struik was a grammar school teacher with a passion for mathematics and history. Nearly a century later when Dirk received a Kenneth O. May Medal, he began his acceptance speech with a tribute to Hendrik for cultivating his son&#x27;s appetite for knowledge. From 1906 to 1911, Dirk attended the Hogere Burgers School in Rotterdam, where he was introduced to left-wing politics and socialism by a favorite math teacher, G. W. Ten Dam.

After entering the University of Leiden in 1912, Struik showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and physics. He was taught by the eminent professors Willem de Sitter, Hendrik Lorentz and Paul Ehrenfest. The unconventional Ehrenfest was said to have exerted the greatest influence on Struik&#x27;s thinking. 

In 1917, to help cover university expenses, Struik worked for a while as a high school math teacher. He was next hired as a research assistant to J. A. Schouten, a distinguished mathematics professor at the Technical University in Delft. During this period, Struik developed his doctoral dissertation, &quot;The Application of Tensor Methods to Riemannian Manifolds.&quot;

In 1922, Struik obtained a doctorate in mathematics from University of Leiden. He was appointed to a teaching position at University of Utrecht in 1923. That same year he married Saly Ruth Ramler, a Czech mathematician with a doctorate from the Charles University of Prague. They remained married until her death in 1993.

== Career ==
In 1924, funded by a Rockefeller fellowship, Struik traveled to Rome to collaborate with the Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita. It was in Rome that Struik started pursuing his interest in the history of mathematics. In 1925, thanks to an extension of his fellowship, he worked with Richard Courant at the University of Göttingen, where Struik got the opportunity to edit Felix Klein&#x27;s unpublished lectures on 19th century mathematics. While there, Struik made extensive use of the university library to research Renaissance mathematicians. He also rekindled interest in a mistaken claim Aristotle had made that space could be tiled with regular congruent tetrahedra. Aristotle&#x27;s error was first challenged in 1435.

In 1926, Struik was offered positions as a lecturer in mathematics at Moscow State University and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). He decided to accept the latter offer, and spent the rest of his academic career there. He was promoted to assistant professor in 1928, associate professor in 1931, and was made a full professor in 1940. While at MIT, he collaborated with Norbert Wiener on differential geometry.

In 1936, Struik co-founded &quot;Science &amp; Society&quot;. It would become the world&#x27;s longest continuously running journal of Marxist scholarship. He regularly contributed articles to &quot;Science &amp; Society&quot;, primarily on the history of science.

== Political controversy ==
Struik was a steadfast believer in Marxism. Having joined the Communist Party of the Netherlands in 1919, he remained a Party member his entire life. When asked in 1994, upon the occasion of his 100th birthday, how he managed to still author peer-reviewed journal articles at such an advanced age, Struik replied blithely that he had the &quot;3Ms&quot; a man needs to sustain himself: Marriage (although he was recently a widower at that time), Mathematics, and Marxism.

During the early 1950s McCarthy era, Struik&#x27;s Marxist opinions led to accusations of him being a spy for the Soviet Union. He was also cited as a &quot;subversive influence in the educational process&quot; in a U.S. Senate committee publication. He denied the allegations, and was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) on July 24, 1951. Struik refused to answer the more than 200 questions asked of him, repeatedly invoking the Fifth Amendment&#x27;s shield against self-incrimination. (He had planned to invoke the First Amendment, but a recent U.S. Supreme Court case struck down that option.) On September 12, 1951, Struik was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury for &quot;conspiracy to overthrow the governments of the United States and Massachusetts, and for advocating the overthrow by violence of the government of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts&quot;. He was released on $10,000 bail. Soon thereafter, the MIT faculty voted to suspend him, with full salary, until the case was resolved. In April 1953, the head of the MIT mathematics department, William Ted Martin, testified to the HUAC that he and Struik had both been members of an MIT communist cell between 1938 and 1946.

The indictment against Struik was quashed in 1956 by Judge Paul G. Kirk after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled in a different case that the federal Smith Act superseded state sedition laws. MIT lifted Struik&#x27;s suspension on May 26, 1956, and he was reinstated as a faculty member. He retired from MIT in 1960.

== Publications ==
Struik&#x27;s most celebrated work was &quot;A Concise History of Mathematics&quot;. Originally published in 1948, it went through four revised editions and was translated into eighteen languages. Among his other works that became standard references or textbooks were &quot;Yankee Science in the Making&quot; and &quot;A Source Book in Mathematics, 1200–1800&quot;.

In 1950, Struik published his &quot;Lectures on Classical Differential Geometry&quot;, which garnered praise from Ian R. Porteous:
:Of all the textbooks on elementary differential geometry published in the last fifty years the most readable is one of the earliest, namely that by D.J. Struik (1950). He is the only one to mention Allvar Gullstrand.

In 1971, Struik edited &quot;The Birth of the Communist Manifesto&quot;. He began the book with a lengthy essay, &quot;Birth of the &quot;Communist Manifesto&quot; and its Historical Significance&quot;, that explicates the intellectual and social milieu from which the 1848 &quot;Manifesto&quot; emerged. In addition to supplying the full text of the document, with his annotations, Struik included as Appendices all Prefaces by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels for the various language editions of the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, plus two early &quot;Manifesto&quot; drafts by Engels, one of which had just been found at the time Struik&#x27;s book was published.

== Later years ==
In 1972, Struik was made an honorary research associate in the History of Science Department at Harvard University. In 1975, he won a Gold Medal of Achievement from the National University of Mexico &quot;for his services to the teaching and development of mathematics in Mexico over the years.&quot; In 1989, he and Adolph P. Yushkevich were the inaugural winners of the Kenneth O. May Prize in the History of Mathematics.

On October 21, 2000, three weeks after celebrating his 106th birthday, Dirk Struik died at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts.

<doc id="932460" wikidata="Q929547" url="?curid=932460" title="Myers's theorem">
<text>Myers&#x27;s theorem, also known as the Bonnet–Myers theorem, is a celebrated, fundamental theorem in the mathematical field of Riemannian geometry. It was discovered by Sumner Byron Myers in 1941. It asserts the following:

In the special case of surfaces, this result was proved by Ossian Bonnet in 1855. For a surface, the Gauss, sectional, and Ricci curvatures are all the same, but Bonnet&#x27;s proof easily generalizes to higher dimensions if one assumes a positive lower bound on the sectional curvature. Myers&#x27; key contribution was therefore to show that a Ricci lower bound is all that is needed to reach the same conclusion. 

==Corollaries==
The conclusion of the theorem says, in particular, that the diameter of formula_1 is finite. Therefore formula_2 must be compact, as a closed (and hence compact) ball of finite radius in any tangent space is carried onto all of formula_2 by the exponential map. 

As a very particular case, this shows that any complete and noncompact smooth Einstein manifold must have nonpositive Einstein constant.

Since formula_2 is connected, there exists the smooth universal covering map formula_5 One may consider the pull-back metric on formula_6 Since formula_7 is a local isometry, Myers&#x27; theorem applies to the Riemannian manifold and hence formula_8 is compact and the covering map is finite. This implies that the fundamental group of formula_2 is finite.

==Cheng&#x27;s diameter rigidity theorem==
The conclusion of Myers&#x27; theorem says that for any formula_10 one has . In 1975, Shiu-Yuen Cheng proved:

<doc id="932462" wikidata="Q4184858" url="?curid=932462" title="Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986">
<text>The Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA or the Simpson–Mazzoli Act) was passed by the 99th United States Congress and signed into law by U.S. President Ronald Reagan on November 6, 1986.

The Immigration Reform and Control Act legalized most undocumented immigrants who had arrived in the country prior to January 1, 1984. The act altered U.S. immigration law by making it illegal to knowingly hire illegal immigrants, and establishing financial and other penalties for companies that employed illegal immigrants.

Nearly three million people applied for legalization under the IRCA. Through the update in the registry date along with the LAW and SAW programs enacted by IRCA, approximately 2.7 million people were ultimately approved for permanent residence.

==Legislative background and description==
Romano L. Mazzoli was a Democratic Representative from Kentucky and Alan K. Simpson was a Republican Senator from Wyoming who chaired their respective immigration subcommittees in Congress. Their effort was assisted by the recommendations of the bipartisan Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, then President of the University of Notre Dame.

These sanctions would apply only to employers who had more than three employees and did not make a sufficient effort to determine the legal status of their workers.

The first Simpson–Mazzoli Bill was reported out of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. The bill failed to be received by the House, but civil rights advocates were concerned over the potential for abuse and discrimination against Hispanics and growers&#x27; groups rallied for additional provisions for foreign labor; the United States Chamber of Commerce persistently opposed sanctions against employers. The second Simpson–Mazzoli Bill eventually reached both chambers in 1985 but fell down on the cost issue in the conference committee. That year was a major turning point for attempts to change. Workplace resistance to workplace fines started to subside, partially owing to the law&#x27;s &quot;affirmative protection&quot; provision, which expressly freed employers from the duty to verify the validity of workers&#x27; records.

Also, agricultural employers shifted their focus from opposition to employer sanctions to a concerted campaign to secure alternative sources of foreign labor. As opposition to employer sanctions waned and growers&#x27; lobbying efforts for extensive temporary worker programs intensified, agricultural worker programs began to outrank employer sanctions as the most controversial part of reform.

President Ronald Reagan did not make immigration a major focus of his administration. However, he came to support the package of reforms sponsored by Simpson and Mazzoli and signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act into law in November 1986. Upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly-refurbished Statue of Liberty, Reagan said, &quot;The legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows, without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society. Very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and, ultimately, if they choose, they may become Americans.&quot;

===Provisions===
The act required employers to attest to their employees&#x27; immigration status and made it illegal to hire or recruit unauthorized immigrants knowingly. The act also legalized certain seasonal agricultural undocumented migrants and undocumented migrants who entered the United States before January 1, 1982 and had resided there continuously without the penalty of a fine, back taxes due, and admission of guilt. Candidates were required to prove that they were not guilty of any crime, had been in the country before January 1, 1982, and possessed at least a minimal knowledge about U.S. history and government and the English language.

The law established financial and other penalties for those employing undocumented migrants, under the theory that low prospects for employment would reduce undocumented migration. Regulations promulgated under the Act introduced the I-9 form to ensure that all employees presented documentary proof of their legal eligibility to accept employment in the United States.

By splitting the H-2 visa category created by the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, the 1986 law created the H-2A visa and H-2B visa categories, for temporary agricultural and non-agricultural workers, respectively.

===Reagan executive action===
The Immigration Reform and Control Act did not address the status of children of undocumented migrants who were eligible for the amnesty program. In 1987, Reagan used his executive authority to legalize the status of minor children of parents granted amnesty under the immigration overhaul, announcing a blanket deferral of deportation for children under 18 who were living in a two-parent household with both parents legalizing or with a single parent who was legalizing. That action affected an estimated 100,000 families.

==Impact==
===Amnesty===
The passing of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act allowed for an update in the registry date. Registry in the United States is a stipulation within immigration law that allows undocumented immigrants to apply for permanent resident status if they entered the country before the established registry date and have remained in the country since, along with other specific requirements. This provision was enacted through the Registry Act of 1929, and it has been updated four times since. IRCA changed the registry date from June 30, 1948 to January 1, 1972, allowing for the legalization of nearly 60,000 undocumented immigrants from 1986 to 1989 alone. The registry date has not been updated since 1986, which has resulted in an exponential decrease of immigrants eligible for a path to citizenship through the registry date provision. For instance, from 2015 to 2019, only 305 individuals were granted legal status through the 1972 registry date. Several political figures and immigration activists advocate for an advance in the current entry deadline, which would allow for the legalization of millions of long-term undocumented immigrants.

In addition to the update in the registry date, the Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty to two groups of applicants. Aliens who had been unlawfully residing in the United States since before January 1, 1982 (LAWs) were legalized under Section 245A of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), while aliens employed in seasonal agricultural work for a minimum of 90 days in the year prior to May, 1986 (SAWs) were legalized under Section 210A of the INA. Nearly three million people applied for legalization under the IRCA. Through the update in the registry date along with the LAW and SAW programs enacted by IRCA, approximately 2.7 million people were ultimately approved for permanent residence.

===On labor market===
According to one study, the IRCA caused some employers to discriminate against workers who appeared foreign, resulting in a small reduction in overall Hispanic employment. There is no statistical evidence that a reduction in employment correlated to unemployment in the economy as a whole or was separate from the general unemployment population statistics. Another study stated that if employees were hired, wages were being lowered to compensate employers for the perceived risk of hiring foreigners.

The hiring process also changed as employers turned to indirect hiring through subcontractors. &quot;Under a subcontracting agreement, a U.S. citizen or resident alien contractually agrees with an employer to provide a specific number of workers for a certain period of time to undertake a defined task at a fixed rate of pay per worker.&quot; &quot;By using a subcontractor the firm is not held liable since the workers are not employees. The use of a subcontractor decreases a worker&#x27;s wages since a portion is kept by the subcontractor. This indirect hiring is imposed on everyone regardless of legality.&quot;

===On illegal immigration===

Despite the passage of the act, the population of undocumented immigrants rose from 5 million in 1986 to 11.1 million in 2013. In 1982, the Supreme Court forbade schools to deny services based on illegal immigration status in Plyler v. Doe. In 1986, Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA), which forbade hospitals from denying emergency care services based on immigration status.

Illegal immigration occurs when an individual enters the U.S. in any way without inspection from border personnel, or by overstaying a temporary visa. Researchers and immigration enforcement institutions use apprehensions data to estimate the number of undocumented immigrants present within the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) define apprehensions as, “the physical control or temporary detainment of a person who is not lawfully in the U.S. which may or may not result in an arrest”.

In the years after IRCA (1986-1989), illegal immigration decreased slightly before returning to pre-IRCA levels. Multiple studies estimate the initial decrease as a result of legalization of previously undocumented immigrants who illegally crossed back-and-forth between the U.S. and Mexico continually (known as circular immigration) now being able to do so legally, subsequently avoiding apprehension. A long-term study published in 2011 analyzed border apprehensions from 1977 to 2000 and found that the decade after the IRCA amnesty program, apprehensions along the U.S.-Mexico border slightly decreased. Multiple studies also found that neither the amnesty provided under IRCA, nor the potential for a future amnesty program, encouraged illegal immigration in the long-term.

While IRCA did not encourage illegal immigration, it failed to curb it. Some attribute this failure to a lack of focus on key determinants of immigration. A 2007 study in Hinckley Journal of Politics titled, &quot;The Ephemeral Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986: Its Formation, Failure and Future Implications,&quot; defined these determinants as, “relative US wage levels, labor market flexibility, probability and cost of crossing the border, ability to find work, demographic changes, political turmoil, demand for labor in growing sectors, existing immigration networks and family relationships”. The same study highlighted the failed attempt of employer sanctions that established criminal and civil punishments on employers for knowingly hiring or continuing to employ undocumented immigrants. These sanctions resulted in little governmental oversight and enforcement, a lack of motivation and economic incentive on the part of employers to ensure all employees legal status prior to hiring (also known as E-Verify), and in some cases an open acceptance and willingness to pay the fines imposed. While immigration policy design in the U.S. can and does have an effect on apprehensions and migratory patterns, external factors and determinants that exist outside of U.S. immigration policy also influence migratory flows and subsequent legal or illegal immigration. A study by Joshua Linder titled, &quot;The Amnesty Effect: Evidence from the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act,&quot; found that the “economic conditions in Mexico have the greatest impact on the flow of undocumented immigrants”. Others attribute IRCA&#x27;s failure to stem illegal immigration to its focus on tougher border enforcement. Border Patrol focused its efforts on common entry areas along the U.S.-Mexico border; however, this pushed migrants to more rural, less-policed areas along the border and encouraged new tactics such as the use of &quot;coyotes&quot; and underground tunnels.

===On crime===
A 2015 study found that the legalization of 3 million immigrants reduced crime by 3 to 5%, primarily property crime. Its author asserts that to be caused by greater job market opportunities for the immigrants. Contrastingly, a 2014 study in the &quot;American Economic Journal: Economic Policy&quot; found that IRCA likely caused an increase in crime, especially felony drug charges, by restricting the employment opportunities for unauthorized migrants. Its authors, in a 2015 journal article, further argue that the changes in felony charges could be motivated by the police’s shift in treatment and persecution of immigrants after IRCA was enacted. This is particularly accurate for Hispanic individuals, who accounted for approximately three-fourths of the 2.7 million immigrants that received a legal status through the LAW and SAW programs included in IRCA. Others have found a direct relation between the passing of IRCA in 1986 with the decline in arrests along the U.S-Mexico border, explained by the amnesty provided to those non-citizens eligible that would have otherwise been part of the seasonal immigration flow.

<text>Augustus Montague Summers (10 April 1880 – 10 August 1948) was an English author, clergyman, and teacher. As an independent scholar, he published many works on the English drama of the Stuart Restoration (1660–1688) and helped to organise and to promote the performance of plays from that period. He also wrote extensively on the occult and has been characterized as &quot;arguably the most seminal twentieth century purveyor of pop culture occultism.&quot;

Summers initially prepared for a career in the Church of England at Oxford and Lichfield, and was ordained as an Anglican deacon in 1908. He then converted to Roman Catholicism and began styling himself as a Catholic priest. He was, however, never under the authority of any Catholic diocese or religious order in England, and it is doubtful that he was ever actually ordained to the priesthood. While employed as a teacher of English and Latin, he pursued scholarly work on the English theatre of the 17th century. For his contributions to that field he was elected to the Royal Society of Literature in 1916.

Noted for his eccentric personality and interests, Summers became a popular figure in London high society first for his theatrical work and later for his &quot;History of Witchcraft and Demonology&quot;, published in 1926. That work was followed by other studies on witchcraft, vampires, and werewolves, in all of which he professed to believe. In 1928 he published his translation of the 15th-century witch hunter&#x27;s manual, the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, and for decades this remained the only full English translation of that historical document. Summers also produced scholarly work on Gothic fiction and published several anthologies of horror stories. He wrote some original works of fiction, none of which were published in his lifetime.

==Early life==

Montague Summers was the youngest of the seven children of Augustus William Summers, a wealthy businessman and justice of the peace in Clifton, Bristol, and his wife Ellen &quot;née&quot; Bush. Augustus was a director of Lloyds Bank, chairman of Bristol United Breweries, and the head of a firm of mineral water manufacturers. Ellen was the daughter of a manager of the Warminster Savings Bank. Montague grew up in a luxurious home located next to Clifton Down and called &quot;Tellisford House&quot;, which today is a listed building. He was educated at Clifton College. Early on, he rebelled against his father&#x27;s evangelical, low church religiosity, embracing instead a ritualistic Anglo-Catholicism. According to his biographer Brocard Sewell, there was a strain of mental illness in his mother&#x27;s side of the family.

In 1899, Summers matriculated at Trinity College, Oxford. Although an avid reader and linguist, Summers neglected his official studies. In 1904 he received a fourth-class Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in theology, promoted in 1906 to a Master of Arts (MA) degree, as per the custom of the University of Oxford. Summers continued his religious training at Lichfield Theological College with the intention of becoming a priest in the Church of England.

Summers self-published his first book, &quot;Antinous and Other Poems&quot;, in 1907. Its contents reflected the influence of the literary Decadent movement while showcasing Summers&#x27;s own preoccupations with pederasty, medievalism, Catholic liturgy, and the occult. Summers dedicated that book to the writer Jacques d&#x27;Adelswärd-Fersen, who was notorious for having been convicted years earlier by a court in Paris of &quot;inciting minors to debauchery&quot;.

Summers was ordained as deacon in 1908 by George Forrest Browne, the Bishop of Bristol. He was then appointed as curate in Bitton, near Bristol. The vicar of Bitton was the elderly Canon Ellacombe, who could provide Summers with little supervision or guidance. When a friend from Oxford, the poet J. Redwood Anderson, visited Summers at the Bitton vicarage, he found Summers &quot;in a thoroughly neurotic state and exhibiting a morbid fascination with evil&quot;. Summers&#x27;s brief curacy ended under a cloud and he never proceeded to higher orders in the Anglican Church, apparently because of rumours of his interest in Satanism and allegations of sexual impropriety with young boys.

Summers&#x27;s interest in Satanism probably derived in part from his reading of the works of the French writer Joris-Karl Huysmans, particularly the novel &quot;Là-bas&quot; (1891), which includes an account of a Black Mass. Summers himself later claimed in private conversation to have attended Black Masses in Bruges, Brighton, and London. Some of his former associates, including Redwood Anderson, claim that in his early years Summers conducted such ceremonies himself.

According to the testimonies quoted by Gerard P. O&#x27;Sullivan, Summers and another clergyman, the Rev. Austin Nelson, were accused in 1908 of attempting to seduce a choirboy in Bath. Fearing that the police might question him, Summers fled to Antwerp, in Belgium. Summers was not prosecuted and he returned to England soon thereafter.
===Conversion to Catholicism===
In 1909, Summers converted to Catholicism and began studying for the Catholic priesthood at St John&#x27;s Seminary, Wonersh, receiving the clerical tonsure on 28 December 1910. After 1913 he styled himself as the &quot;Reverend Alphonsus Joseph-Mary Augustus Montague Summers&quot; and acted as a Catholic priest, even though he was never a member of any Catholic order or diocese in England. After this time, he also consistently appeared in public in what Brocard Sewell described as &quot;clerical attire reminiscent of some exotic &quot;abbé&quot; of the time of Louis Quatorze&quot;. Whether he was actually ordained as a priest is disputed.

According to some testimonies, Summers had transferred from the seminary in Wornesh to the Diocese of Nottingham, but the local bishop refused to ordain him after receiving incriminating reports of Summers&#x27;s prior conduct. Some sources claim that Summers then travelled to Continental Europe and was ordained by Cardinal Mercier in Belgium or by Archbishop Guido Maria Conforti in Italy. It is also claimed that Summers was ordained as a priest by Ulric Vernon Herford, the self-styled &quot;Bishop of Mercia and Middlesex&quot; in the &quot;Evangelical Catholic Communion&quot;, one of several &quot;episcopi vagantes&quot; (&quot;wandering bishops&quot;) operating in Britain at the time.

Brocard Sewell argued that &quot;there is a strong probability, if not a moral certainty&quot; that Summers had been validly but perhaps illicitly ordained as a priest. Sewell gave as evidence the facts that Summers was allowed to say mass publicly when he travelled in the Continent and that Monsignor Ronald Knox, although wholly unsympathetic and opposed to Summers, regarded him as actually being a Catholic priest.

===Work as a teacher===

From 1911 to 1926 Summers found employment as a teacher of English, Latin, French, and history. He was an assistant master at Hertford Grammar School in 1911–1912, and then at the Junior School of the Central School of Arts and Crafts in Holborn in 1912–1922. During that time he also taught evening classes at London County Council schools. In 1922, he became senior English and Classics master at Brockley County School in south-east London. Despite his eccentric appearance and habits, he was apparently a successful and well-regarded teacher. Summers gave up teaching in 1926, after the success of his first book on witchcraft allowed him to adopt writing as his full-time occupation.

==Literary scholarship==
While employed as a schoolmaster and with the encouragement of Arthur Henry Bullen of the Shakespeare Head Press, Summers established himself as an independent scholar specializing on the dramatic literature of the Stuart Restoration. Summers&#x27;s first effort in this area appeared in 1914 and was a critical edition of George Villiers&#x27;s &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;. He then edited the plays of Aphra Behn, which appeared in 1915 in six volumes. That work was well received by other scholars and earned him election as fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1916.

=== Restoration drama ===

Summers helped to create a new society called &quot;The Phoenix&quot; that performed &quot;old plays&quot;, including long neglected Restoration comedies, and which operated from 1919 to 1925 under the patronage of Lady Cunard and with the support of Sir Edmund Gosse. It was succeeded by the &quot;Renaissance Theatre&quot;, which gave occasional performances until 1928. Summers wrote extensive programme notes for those productions and offered his scholarly advice during rehearsals. That work made Summers a well known and popular figure in theatrical circles. Among Summers&#x27;s associates in the London theater were actor Lewis Casson and his wife Sybil Thorndike.

With the Nonesuch Press, Summers published critical editions of the collected plays of William Congreve (1923), William Wycherley (1924), and Thomas Otway (1926). With Reginald Caton&#x27;s Fortune Press, Summers edited the works of Thomas Shadwell (1927). In 1931-32 there appeared his edition of the works of John Dryden, published by Nonesuch, which attracted considerable criticism from other scholars for what they identified as faulty editing of the texts and unacknowledged borrowing from other scholars in the notes. After that, Summers published no other critical editions of dramatists.

Several decades after his death, literary critic and historian Robert D. Hume characterized Montague Summers&#x27;s scholarship on Restoration drama as pioneering and useful, but also as marred by sloppiness, eccentricity, uncritical deference to Edmund Gosse and other similar gentlemen-amateurs, and even occasional dishonesty. Hume judged Summers&#x27;s studies on &quot;The Restoration Theatre&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Playhouse of Pepys&quot; (1935) to be particularly fruitful sources. In his own day, Summers&#x27;s credibility among university-based scholars was adversely impacted by the acrimonious public disputes in which he engaged with others working in the same field, such as Frederick S. Boas and Allardyce Nicoll.

=== Gothic fiction ===

In 1917, Summers presented a lecture on Ann Radcliffe, the pioneering Gothic novelist, before the Royal Society of Literature. That same year he lectured the Society on Jane Austen in the context of the centenary of her death. In the 1920s Summers and another scholar, Michael Sadleir, rediscovered the seven obscure Gothic novels, known as the &quot;Northanger Horrid Novels&quot;, that Austen mentioned in her Gothic parody novel &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;. Many readers had come to suppose that the lurid titles were Austen&#x27;s own invention, but Summers and Sadleir showed that they corresponded to novels published in the 1790s. Summers produced partial editions of two of those works.

Gothic fiction became the other focus of Summers&#x27;s literary scholarship, in addition to Restoration drama. In 1938, Summers published a history of the Gothic novel titled &quot;The Gothic Quest&quot;, which was later praised by the French scholar André Parreaux as &quot;a unique and valuable book, indispensable to the student of the period&quot;. A second volume of that history, to be titled &quot;The Gothic Achievement&quot;, had not been completed when Summers died in 1948. Summers&#x27;s &quot;Gothic Bibliography&quot;, published in 1940, has been characterized as &quot;flawed but useful.&quot;

Summers also compiled three anthologies of supernatural stories: &quot;The Supernatural Omnibus&quot; (1931), &quot;Victorian Ghost Stories&quot; (1933), and &quot;The Grimoire and other Supernatural Stories&quot; (1936). He has been described as &quot;the major anthologist of supernatural and Gothic fiction&quot; in the 1930s.

=== Poetry ===

Summers also edited the poetry of Richard Barnfield, a contemporary of Shakespeare. Summers&#x27; introduction to his 1936 edition of Barnfield&#x27;s poems stressed the homosexual theme of some of those works, particularly &quot;The Affectionate Shepherd&quot;. Brocard Sewell states that Summers&#x27;s introduction to &quot;The Poems of Richard Barnfield&quot; is one of the two works that Summers published on the &quot;psychology of sex&quot;, the other being his 1920 essay on the Marquis de Sade.

== The occult ==
From 1916 onwards, Summers regularly published articles in popular occult periodicals, including &quot;The Occult Review&quot; and the Spiritualist periodical &quot;Light&quot;. In 1926 his work on &quot;The History of Witchcraft and Demonology&quot; appeared as part of the series on &quot;History of Civilization&quot; published by Kegan Paul and edited by Charles Kay Ogden. In the introduction to that book, Summers wrote:

Summers expressed belief in the existence of demons, their role in possession and exorcism, and other preternatural phenomena associated with their activity. However, he also argued, based on the theological views of Augustine and Aquinas, that the magical rites of witches can do no real harm to others. He considered that the testimonies according to which witches reached the location of their &quot;sabbath&quot; by magical flight were based on some delusion and argued that the &quot;devil&quot; reported to appear at such gatherings was an ordinary man in disguise, engaged in a burlesque of the ritual of the holy mass. The basic tenet of Summers&#x27;s approach to witchcraft was Thomas Stapleton&#x27;s dictum (&quot;Heresy grows with witchcraft, and witchcraft with heresy&quot;). Summers presented modern spiritualism as a continuation of older forms of witchcraft and necromancy.

&quot;The History of Witchcraft and Demonology&quot; sold well and attracted considerable attention in the press, with many reviewers expressing surprise that a 20th-century scholar had written as if the persons accused during the historical witch hunts had really been guilty of the crimes attributed to them. The book&#x27;s success made Summers &quot;something of a social celebrity&quot; and allowed him to give up teaching and write full time. In 1927 Summers published a companion volume, &quot;The Geography of Witchcraft&quot;, also as part of Ogden&#x27;s &quot;History of Civilization&quot; series.

In 1928, Summers published the first full English translation of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (&quot;The Hammer of Witches&quot;), a Latin manual on the detection and prosecution of witches written in the 15th century by the Dominican inquisitors Heinrich Kramer and Jacob Sprenger. In his introduction, Summers insists that the reality of witchcraft is an essential part of Catholic doctrine and declares the &quot;Malleus&quot; an admirable and correct account of witchcraft and of the methods necessary to combat it. In fact, however, the Catholic authorities of the 15th century had condemned the &quot;Malleus&quot; on both ethical and legal grounds. Other Catholic scholars contemporary with Summers were also highly critical of the &quot;Malleus&quot;. For instance, the Rev. Herbert Thurston&#x27;s article on &quot;Witchcraft&quot; for the &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; of 1912, refers to the publication of the &quot;Malleus&quot; as a &quot;disastrous episode.&quot;

After his first works on witchcraft were published, Summers turned his attention to vampires, producing &quot;The Vampire: His Kith and Kin&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Vampire in Europe&quot; (1929). According to Summers&#x27;s books, his research on vampires was not exclusively bibliographical, but also drew on oral traditions that he had encountered during his travels in Greece. Summers then turned to werewolves with &quot;The Werewolf&quot; (1933).

In 1933, copies of Summers&#x27;s translations of &quot;The Confessions of Madeleine Bavent&quot; and of Ludovico Maria Sinistrari&#x27;s &quot;Demoniality&quot; were seized by the police due to their explicit accounts of sexual intercourse between humans and demons. At the ensuing trial of the publisher for obscene libel, anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard testified in defence of the scholarly value of the works in question. The publisher, Reginald Caton, was convicted and the unsold copies destroyed.

===Influence===
Summers&#x27;s work on the occult is notorious for his old-fashioned and eccentric writing style, his display of erudition, and his purported belief in the reality of some of the preternatural subjects he treats. Presented from the perspective of a highly traditionalist Catholicism, Summers&#x27;s occult scholarship has actually had its greatest influence within modern popular culture. According to historian Juliette Wood, Summers&#x27;s

According to horror genre scholar John Edgar Browning, &quot;it is because of Summers that the modern serious study of the vampire figure exists today&quot;. On the other hand, Browning also finds that, for all their erudition, Summers&#x27;s research on the occult exhibits &quot;a curious absence of any real depth&quot;, which may explain why &quot;a stigma has been attached to Summers&#x27;s writings for almost as long as they have been in print.&quot; After Christopher S. MacKay published a full translation of the &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; in 2006, historian Jonathan Seitz welcomed that new work, noting that, until then, the &quot;Malleus&quot; had &quot;been readily available in English only in the atrocious 1928 &#x27;translation&#x27; authored by Montague Summers&quot;. Seitz added that &quot;to dub Summers an eccentric would be to understate substantially his outsized personality, and his edition reflects his idiosyncrasies.&quot;

The prominent Catholic historian Jeffrey Burton Russell, a specialist in the religion of the European Middle Ages, wrote in 1972 that

According to Brian Doherty, Summers&#x27;s later writings on witchcraft, published in the 1930s and 1940s, &quot;adopted a far more paranoid and conspiracy-driven worldview&quot; than his earlier works on the subject. These later writings draw extensively from earlier conspiracy theorists such as the French counter-revolutionary Abbé Augustin Barruel and the English Fascist Nesta Helen Webster. As such, Summers&#x27;s work may have influenced the &quot;Satanic Panic&quot; of the 1980s and 1990s.

===Antisemitism===

Summers&#x27;s &quot;History of Witchcraft and Demonology&quot; (1926) gives credence to various historical accusations that European Jews kidnapped and sacrificed Christian children. Summers wrote that &quot;the evidence is quite conclusive that the body, and especially the blood of the victim, was used for magical purposes&quot;, and concluded that it was for this &quot;practice of the dark and hideous traditions of Hebrew magic&quot;—and not for the Biblical Jewish faith—that Jews had been persecuted by Christians in the Middle Ages and in the early modern period. The great majority of historians now reject the view that this &quot;blood libel&quot; against the Jews had any basis in fact. According to historian Norman Cohn, Summers&#x27;s writings on witchcraft helped to promote antisemitic tropes well after Summers&#x27;s death.

==Other pursuits==

Summers cultivated his reputation for eccentricity. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote he was &quot;in every way a &#x27;character&#x27; and in some sort a throwback to the Middle Ages.&quot; His biographer, Father Brocard Sewell, paints the following portrait:

Summers wrote works of hagiography on Catherine of Siena, Anthony Maria Zaccaria, and others, but his primary religious interest was always in the occult. While Aleister Crowley, with whom he was acquainted, adopted the persona of a modern-day sorcerer, Summers played the part of the learned Catholic witch-hunter. Despite his conservative religiosity, Summers was an active member of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, to which he contributed an essay on the Marquis de Sade in 1920.

In 1926, Summers advertised in the London &quot;Times&quot; for a secretary to assist him with his literary work. A young Cyril Connolly responded, but found Summers uncongenial and turned down the position. Connolly privately mocked Summers in blank verse as &quot;a sorcerer / a fruity unfrocked cleric of the Nineties / Like an old toad that carries in his head / The jewel of literature, a puffy satyr / That blends his Romish ritual with the filth / Scrawled on Pompeian pavement.&quot;

The posthumously published personal diaries of socialite and later Conservative politician Sir Henry Channon relate how Channon first met Summers at a dinner party in Summers&#x27;s honour given by Lady Cunard in January 1928. Channon&#x27;s diaries then describe a series of visits to Summers&#x27;s home in Richmond. Channon recounts that, on more than one occasion and at Channon&#x27;s suggestion, Summers took Channon upstairs to his private chapel after dinner and beat him over the altar. Channon characterized Summers as a &quot;lecherous priest&quot;, &quot;a madman&quot;, and &quot;as dangerous as he is brilliant&quot;, cutting off contact with him after a couple of months.

Summers lived in Oxford from 1929 to 1934, where he often worked at the Bodleian Library and attended high mass at Blackfriars. He collaborated with a number of student dramatic productions and became the object of much attention and gossip among Oxford University undergraduates, who regarded him as &quot;a kind of clerical Doctor Faustus&quot;.

The popular novelist Dennis Wheatley relates that he was introduced to Summers by the journalist and politician Tom Driberg while Wheatley was researching occultism for his novel &quot;The Devil Rides Out&quot; (1934). A weekend visit by Wheatley and his wife to Summers&#x27;s home in Alresford was cut short by the Wheatleys, who determined &quot;never to see the, perhaps not so Reverend, gentleman again&quot;. Summers and Wheatley continued to correspond on friendly terms, but Wheatley reportedly based the character of the evil Canon Copely-Syle, in his novel &quot;To the Devil – a Daughter&quot; (1953), on Montague Summers.

Montague Summers wrote several original works of fiction, but none of these were published during his lifetime. The unpublished manuscripts include two plays: &quot;William Henry: A Play in Four Acts&quot; and &quot;Piers Gaveston&quot; (whose text is now lost and whose title is sometimes listed as &quot;Edward II&quot;). A number of ghost stories and a short novel, &quot;The Bride of Christ&quot;, were found among Summers&#x27;s papers and published long after his death.

== Relations with the Catholic Church ==

Although he presented himself as an uncompromising defender of Catholic orthodoxy, the great majority of Summers&#x27;s books on religious subjects were not published with the approval of Catholic authorities (see &quot;nihil obstat&quot; and &quot;imprimatur&quot;). The exception to this was his translation of Saint Alphonsus Liguori&#x27;s &quot;The Glories of Mary&quot;, which appeared in 1938 with the &quot;imprimatur&quot; of the Archdiocese of Paris. In particular, Summers&#x27;s work on witchcraft was not sanctioned by any church authority and it attracted very negative public comment from an important Catholic scholar, the English Jesuit Herbert Thurston, who wrote in 1927 that

Father Thurston also called attention to the fact that Summers did not figure in any English register as either an Anglican or a Catholic priest, but was instead a literary figure with distinctly Decadent tastes. According to Bernard Doherty, Thurston may have been concerned that Summers&#x27;s writings on witchcraft could have been a &quot;mystification&quot; akin to the Taxil hoax of the 1890s, intended to bring ridicule upon the Catholic Church. Thurston challenged Summers to show to the public that he was really an ordained priest, which Summers failed to do. Bernard Doherty notes that, although Summers&#x27;s belief in the preternatural reality of witchcraft was at odds with the skepticism of Fr. Thurston and other Catholic commentators, it was closer to the views expressed by some prominent English Catholic intellectuals of his day, such as G. K. Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc.

According to Fr. Brocard Sewell, Summers was well known but also generally &quot;mal vu&quot; among English Dominicans in the 1920s and 1930s. In 1938 both Mons. Ronald Knox and Douglas Woodruff objected to having their own essays published in a collection on &quot;Great Catholics&quot; edited by Fr. Claude Williamson, after they learned that the book would also include an essay by Summers on John Dryden. Shortly after Summers&#x27;s death in 1948, the &quot;Catholic Herald&quot; published a statement by the Diocese of Southwark to the effect that Summers had, many years earlier, been a student for the priesthood but that, as far as was known, he had not been ordained. Fr. Sewell, although convinced that Summers had been a priest, declared that his &quot;clerical life seems to have had more in common with the strange semi-fantasy world of the &quot;episcopi vagantes&quot; than with that of a normal priest.&quot;

In the early 1930s, Summers acted as a private chaplain to Mrs. Ermengarde Greville-Nugent, the widow of Patrick Greville-Nugent, son of Anglo-Irish aristocrat and politician Lord Greville. Mrs. Greville-Nugent was a prominent neo-Jacobite and founder of the Anglican Society of King Charles the Martyr before her conversion to Roman Catholicism. Both her only daughter and her husband had died insane, and she was convicted of fraud in 1934 for obtaining money to keep up her elegant lifestyle by writing deceptive begging letters to people whose names had appeared in the newspapers as recent beneficiaries of wills. The Catholic Bishop of Southwark, Peter Amigo, excommunicated Mrs. Greville-Nugent for allowing Summers to celebrate mass in the private oratory at Kingsley Dene, her home in Dulwich.

==Death==

Montague Summers died suddenly at his home in Richmond, Surrey in August 1948. The Catholic rector of St Elizabeth of Portugal Church refused a public requiem mass, but conducted instead a private graveside ceremony. Summers&#x27;s grave in Richmond Cemetery was unmarked until the late 1980s, when Sandy Robertson and Edwin Pouncey organised the Summers Project to garner donations for a gravestone. It now bears his favoured phrase &quot;tell me strange things&quot;.

Summers bequeathed his estate and papers to his long-time personal secretary and companion Hector Stuart-Forbes. This legacy was valued at £10,000 (the equivalent of about £300,000 in 2024), but Stuart-Forbes was already seriously ill and died in 1950, aged 45, and was buried in the same unmarked plot as Summers. An autobiography of Summers was published posthumously in 1980 as &quot;The Galanty Show&quot;, though it left much unrevealed about the author&#x27;s life and dealt only with the literary side of his career. In the 2000s, many of Summers&#x27;s personal papers were re-discovered in Canada, where they had been kept by members of Stuart-Forbes&#x27;s family. A collection of Summers&#x27;s papers is now at the Georgetown University library.

<doc id="932477" wikidata="Q2778252" url="?curid=932477" title="Tuf Voyaging">
<text>Tuf Voyaging is a 1986 science fiction fix-up novel by American writer George R. R. Martin, first published in hardcover by Baen Books. It is a darkly comic meditation on environmentalism and absolute power.

This novel is a collection of related short fiction works, originally published over several years, beginning with 1976&#x27;s &quot;A Beast for Norn&quot;. The book includes a prologue and Martin&#x27;s S&#x27;uthlam storyline (published in &quot;Analog Science Fiction and Fact&quot;), adding them as bridging material, and gathering them with other Tuf stories into one episodic novel.

The novel concerns the (mis)adventures of Haviland Tuf, an exceptionally tall, bald, very pale, overweight, phlegmatic, vegetarian, cat-loving-but-otherwise solitary space trader. Tuf inadvertently becomes the master of the &quot;Ark&quot;, an ancient, &quot;seedship&quot; – a very powerful warship with advanced ecological engineering capabilities – after a deal between several of his venal and cutthroat passengers goes awry. Tuf travels the galaxy, offering his services to worlds with environmental problems, and sometimes imposing solutions of his own.

The stories in &quot;Tuf Voyaging&quot; are set in the same fictional &quot;Thousand Worlds&quot; universe as several of Martin&#x27;s other works, including &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;, &quot;Sandkings&quot;, &quot;Nightflyers&quot;, &quot;A Song for Lya&quot; and &quot;The Way of Cross and Dragon&quot;.

Martin cited fantasy fiction and science fiction Grand Master Jack Vance as having a large influence on his Tuf stories, and he emulated Vance&#x27;s writing style in most of them.

In 2006, &quot;Tuf Voyaging&quot; was nominated for a Seiun Award in Japan for translated long form novel. Several of the individual stories have also been honored. In 1982, &quot;Guardians&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Novelette 
and was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novelette. In the 1986 &quot;Analog&quot; Readers Poll in the novella/novelette category, &quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot; won and &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot; took second place.

==&quot;The Plague Star&quot;==
The story begins with four people requiring interstellar transport: Celise Waan, a scholar of anthropology; Jefri Lion, a scholar and retired soldier; Anittas, a cybertech; and Kaj Nevis, the leader of the expedition. They hire Rica Dawnstar, a mercenary bodyguard, and acquire the services of Haviland Tuf, a not-very-successful trader.

Their destination is a so-called &quot;plague star,&quot; known to inflict disease and pestilence on every third generation of a small, remote world. It turns out to be an enormous, abandoned seedship of the long-defunct Federal Empire&#x27;s Ecological Engineering Corps, developed by the Corps to rewrite genetic coding for entire planets, for good or for ill. Tuf&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Cornucopia of Excellent Goods at Low Prices&quot;, is damaged by the seedship&#x27;s automated defenses, and three of the occupants, Nevis, Anittas, and Dawnstar, board the seedship by means of pressure suits, betraying and leaving the others to await eventual death through asphyxiation. However, Tuf locates a microchip allowing him, Waan, and Lion to land the &quot;Cornucopia&quot; safely on the seedship.

Nevis, who has stolen a bulky but extremely powerful alien exoskeleton from Tuf&#x27;s ship, violently forces Anittas, a cyborg, to invade the ship&#x27;s circuits. In the process, Anittas&#x27;s suit is torn, and he contracts a plague from the air. Alarmed by this brutality and worried Nevis will use his suit&#x27;s power to subjugate her as well, Dawnstar runs away from Nevis, ultimately finding the vast seedship&#x27;s control room. Anittas, meanwhile, betrays Nevis, releasing several of the ship&#x27;s macroscopic bioweapons, including acid-spitting &quot;hellkittens&quot;; hyper-aggressive, carnivorous, bat-like creatures; spider-like, unimaginably sharp-edged organisms known as &quot;walking webs&quot;; and a T. rex. Furious at his treachery, Nevis kills the dying Anittas.

Meanwhile, Waan, Lion, and Tuf have found the armory, but have split up due to disagreements on leadership. They quickly discover that the air is poisoned with various plagues, which Waan determines using one of Tuf&#x27;s cats, Mushroom. Tuf recognizes that Mushroom is infected by the plagues and is dying, and kills him gently, preventing Mushroom&#x27;s further suffering. He discovers the cloning room of the seedship, and clones Mushroom using the ship&#x27;s equipment, naming the new cat Chaos.

Waan is found by the hellkittens, which spray her with acid and corrode her helmet, impairing her vision. Disbelieving Tuf&#x27;s warning, she takes her helmet off and contracts a plague. When the hellkittens return to eat her, she is not only weakened by illness but unprotected by her helmet. Though mostly paralyzed and dying, she manages to activate a grenade, destroying herself along with the hellkittens.

Lion, meanwhile, sets a trap for Nevis in a corridor by rigging a plasma cannon to go off only when objects of certain dimensions, such as Nevis&#x27;s battle-suit, pass in front of it. While luring Nevis toward the trap, however, he is killed and partly eaten by the bat-like creature.

Rica Dawnstar, in charge of the control room, uses reverse psychology to trick Nevis into meeting the walking web, which kills him. She then offers Tuf the chance to leave peacefully, but on his refusal, attempts to kill him with the psi-controlled T. Rex. But Tuf has discovered Lion&#x27;s plasma-cannon trap; he lures Dawnstar and the dinosaur into its line of fire, killing them. Tuf then takes control of the seedship as the only surviving claimant.

==&quot;Loaves and Fishes&quot;==
Haviland Tuf takes his newly acquired seedship, which he has named the &quot;Ark&quot;, to the world of S&#x27;uthlam (an anagram for Malthus) for extensive repairs. S&#x27;uthlam is a world on the verge of war with all of the nearby inhabited worlds, as it requires a constant flow of resources to the planet. This is due to the world&#x27;s continuing population explosion, a result of the S&#x27;uthlamese religious belief that unfettered and unchecked human reproduction will one day lead to a world of gods. This is in spite of evidence that this population explosion will lead, as it has many times in the past, to famine and S&#x27;uthlamese attempts at military conquest of adjoining star systems.

Once the S&#x27;uthlamese become aware of the &quot;Ark&quot; and its capabilities, they want to seize it for themselves to use it as both a resource to wring higher caloric production from their star system&#x27;s biology, and also as a powerful weapon of war. In an attempt to secure it, Portmaster Tolly Mune kidnaps one of Tuf&#x27;s cats. She makes a bet with Tuf – if he will solve S&#x27;uthlam&#x27;s impending famine, she will return his cat and give him monetary credits for the ship&#x27;s repairs. If he loses the bet, S&#x27;uthlam will keep the seedship.

Tuf at first reasonably proposes that the S&#x27;uthlamese simply restrict their incontinent reproductive practices, but because the S&#x27;uthlamese fixation is fanatic, it is impervious to reason. They will not control their population growth, and thus drive obsessively into a suicidal future of starvation and war.

Tuf works on the problem, and manages to find a solution whereby he uses the seedship&#x27;s capabilities to provide exotic plants and animals which can yield sustenance for the population, thus staving off starvation for a period of time. The authorities, with striking proof of the &quot;Ark&quot;&#x27;s capabilities, now begin scheming to bring it in their possession. Mune, disgusted with the politics of the situation, assists Tuf in escaping from S&#x27;uthlam, despite the fact that this places her in a precarious position. He informs her that he will return to pay off his debt.

==&quot;Guardians&quot;==
Tuf finds himself at Namor, an oceanic world where sea monsters are attacking the local population. As always, he offers to assist for a fee. Before diving into creating the creatures needed to battle the monsters, Tuf begins to study the planet in order to determine why the monsters are attacking the people of Namor. However, during this study, the Namorians grow more desperate and impatient, especially as monsters able to walk on land begin to appear. Tuf&#x27;s hand is forced, and he unleashes a barrage of other creatures to directly counteract the monsters.

This strategy, initially successful, soon fails as the monsters gain resistance to these otherworldly creatures. Tuf goes back to work, and manages to find a solution. Through his psionically enhanced cat, he discovers a previously unsuspected sapient species native to Namor: the mudpots. Sessile, aquatic bottom-dwellers (which had hitherto been considered dietary delicacies by the Namorian colonists), they are linked telepathically into a kind of hivemind, controlling the lesser species of life on the planet as skilled bio-engineers.

Tuf establishes communications with the mudpots and brokers a peace agreement whereby his human employers agree to cease eating the planet&#x27;s autochthonous intelligent species. He gives the leaders of Namor psionically enhanced kittens to facilitate their dealings with the mudpots, and departs.

==&quot;Second Helpings&quot;==
Tuf returns to S&#x27;uthlam to pay the first part of his debt. He is hailed as a hero due to the advancements in the overcrowded world&#x27;s food production, now known as &quot;Tuf&#x27;s Flowering&quot;. This is also due to &quot;Tuf and Mune&quot;, a highly inaccurate, overly-dramatized movie about Tuf&#x27;s first adventure on S&#x27;uthlam, the creation of which Mune encouraged to build public support for Tuf&#x27;s plan (and save her political skin from the fallout of helping Tuf escape with &quot;Ark&quot;).

However, paradoxically, the overpopulation crisis has become even worse due to the S&#x27;uthlamese people&#x27;s over-optimistic response to Tuf&#x27;s Flowering, increasing their reproduction rates. Tuf works on trying to provide even more-efficient crops and animals. He also insists on delivering a planet-wide speech detailing the enhancements he had in mind for S&#x27;uthlam and concluding with an explicit admonition:

This is received with predictable religious outrage, and Mune is barely able to extract Tuf from the clutches of an angry S&#x27;uthlamese mob.

==&quot;A Beast for Norn&quot;==
Tuf is approached by Herold Norn, senior beastmaster of the Norn House of Lyronica. The House of Norn requests beasts for gladiatorial fighting in Lyronica&#x27;s Bronze Arena. After seeing an example of the Arena battles (and, it is strongly implied, being appalled by its barbarity), Tuf agrees to provide a breeding stock of cobalcats (&quot;and&quot; a stock of innocuous-looking prey animals from the cobalcats&#x27; homeworld to be released into the cobalcats&#x27; new Lyronican habitat) for the House of Norn.

As the House of Norn racks up victories with their cobalcats, Tuf is approached &quot;seriatim&quot; by the other houses for ever-more-lethally-effective beasts (and compatible prey animals), until the greatest of the Houses, namely House Arneth-in-the-Gilded-Wood at last approaches him for a beast and also with a demand for him to cease all further dealings with the Houses of Lyronica. Tuf graciously accepts the offer.

Norn returns to Tuf to complain about the cobalcats not mating (and about the prey species reproducing without effective suppression and overrunning the Norn lands, making it impossible for the House of Norn to return to breeding their original Arena beasts). Tuf gets the last laugh, as the introduction of the various prey species into each House&#x27;s territory irrevocably changes the regional ecosystem such that all become incapable of sustaining the large predators upon which the gladiatorial contests had originally depended, thus leading to the (unstated) end of the Bronze Arena.

==&quot;Call Him Moses&quot;==
While peaceably eating in a restaurant, Tuf is attacked by Jaime Kreen. Kreen is convicted for the attack and bonded to Tuf as a servant in debt. Kreen explains that his society (a technologically advanced secondary colony established as an arcology on the planet Charity) has been taken over by a primitivist religious leader named Moses. Taking his cues from the Bible, Moses had unleashed plagues on the inhabitants of the arcology, driving them out of their city into the countryside to labor and suffer under Moses&#x27; back-to-nature Holy Altruistic Restoration.

Kreen had attempted to murder Tuf because he blames Moses&#x27; plagues upon Tuf, who has gained an interstellar reputation as an ecological engineer, and Tuf realizes that Moses&#x27; &quot;plagues&quot; (actually low-tech simulations easily imposed by sabotage upon the closed system of an arcology) offer him an opportunity for revenue.

Kreen is sent down to the planet to bring back the former leaders of the now-conquered and evacuated arcology for negotiations, and Tuf offers to help them against Moses for a hefty fee. Using the &quot;Ark&quot;&#x27;s technology, Tuf introduces himself to Moses as God, in the guise of a pillar of fire. He afflicts the followers of Moses with the Biblical plagues of legend, but these are widespread planetary ecological assaults instead of Moses&#x27; fraudulent localized afflictions.

After two such attacks, Tuf invites Moses aboard the &quot;Ark&quot; and shows him simulations of the increasingly horrible plagues that he could further inflict upon Moses and his followers. Moses, frightened, gives up his claim on the arcology&#x27;s population, allowing them to escape his nasty, brutish religious fanaticism and return to the comforts of modern civilization.

==&quot;Manna from Heaven&quot;==
Tuf returns to S&#x27;uthlam for the second time to pay off the last of his debt. This time, S&#x27;uthlam is on the brink of war with the allied forces of the neighboring worlds. Mune, now First Councillor or planetary leader, comes aboard the &quot;Ark&quot; to discuss with Tuf the possibility of acquiring the seedship for S&#x27;uthlam&#x27;s own purposes.

S&#x27;uthlam&#x27;s population problem remains, worse than ever, as Tuf&#x27;s innovations from his previous visit were not maximally used. Its society is beginning to break down and either a terrible war or utter social collapse seems likely. Tuf labors to find a solution, and calls a meeting of all the worlds about to clash. He presents to them his solution: an edible, mildly addictive plant called &quot;manna&quot;, which will freely grow everywhere on S&#x27;uthlam and eliminate its hunger problems. After some arm-twisting, in which Tuf threatens to use the military might of his seedship against anyone who refuses, the hostile worlds agree to an armistice. Tuf later tells a horrified Mune that the manna will indeed feed her people, but will also inhibit the libidos of the S&#x27;uthlamese and cause widespread, but not universal, infertility. He leaves Mune to make a momentous decision for S&#x27;uthlam; it is implied that she accepts the provision of manna to forestall war and famine.

==Character development==
In the beginning of the novel Tuf is an unassuming and rather inept interstellar trader, of humble and somewhat bland (on the surface) nature, with an aversion to human contact, and a love of cats. As the story progresses, Tuf&#x27;s character is revealed to be that of Piper&#x27;s self-reliant man, as the power of the &quot;Ark&quot; allows him to solve the apparently intractable problems of several worlds. Mune, in explaining why she was helping him escape with the &quot;Ark&quot; in the first of the S&#x27;uthlam stories, says that &quot;Power corrupts . . . and absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot; (an uncredited quotation of the ancient dictum by Lord Acton). Mune further says that she doesn&#x27;t think that there is such a thing as an incorruptible man, but if there is, Tuf is it. She also says that she wouldn&#x27;t trust the leaders of her world with the potentially terrible biowarfare capabilities of &quot;Ark.&quot;

Eventually this becomes a grim prediction. Finding that most of his clients&#x27; problems arise not primarily from true ecological catastrophes but rather as the result of their cupidity, stupidity, bureaucracy, religious fanaticism and bloody-mindedness, he resolves their situations by addressing their failings, beginning (in the earliest published story, 1976&#x27;s &quot;A Beast for Norn&quot;) with rendering it impossible for the Great Houses of Lyronica to continue the gladitorial animal contests of the Bronze Arena.

On Namor, he finds a solution: seeking out contact with the previously unsuspected native sapient race that had escaped the &quot;fighting guild&quot; of unthinkingly truculent Guardians to end the attacks being inflicted upon the human colonists by the planet&#x27;s mudpot hivemind. On Charity, he copes with both the incompetence of the arcology&#x27;s administrators (&quot;[Y]ou are by training a bureaucrat&quot;, says Tuf to Kreen, &quot;and thus good for virtually nothing&quot;) and the religious tyranny of Moses&#x27; Holy Altruistic Restoration.

Finally, in &quot;Manna from Heaven&quot; (1985), he provides the S&#x27;uthlamese and their enemies with an irrevocable solution that simultaneously averts both famine and war &quot;but&quot; covertly imposes birth control upon the &quot;religious crazies&quot; of S&#x27;uthlam&#x27;s Church of Life Evolving (characterized as &quot;anti-entropists, kiddie-culters, helix-humpers, genepool puddlers&quot;), forcing Mune to accept Tuf&#x27;s induced population implosion as the only alternative to social breakdown and genocide.

==Possible sequel==
In a February 2013 post, Martin wrote on his website that, from time to time, he is asked by fans about writing more Tuf stories, and said that he hopes to do so again someday. He also hinted that he thought Irish actor Conleth Hill, who plays Varys on HBO&#x27;s &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, based on his bestselling &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; fantasy series, would be a good choice to play Tuf.

<text>A full screen effect (sometimes written as fullscreen effect) is any graphics technique that is applied to the entire screen, usually after the rest of the image has been rendered. This is in contrast to effects that are applied to each element of an image—such as a three-dimensional triangle—as it is drawn. The speed of applying a full screen effect is independent of the complexity of the image.

In 3D rendering applications such as video games, common full screen effects include color filters, depth of field, and full screen bloom. A color filter, for example, may desaturate an image or convert it to grayscale. These effects are usually achieved via 
GPU shaders.</text><links>

<text>Caeciliidae is the family of common caecilians. They are found in Central and South America. Like other caecilians, they superficially resemble worms or snakes.

Although they are the most diverse of the caecilian families, the caeciliids do have a number of features in common that distinguish them from other caecilians. In particular, their skulls have relatively few bones, with those that are present being fused to form a solid ram to aid in burrowing through the soil. The mouth is recessed beneath the snout, and there is no tail.

Many caeciliids lay their eggs in moist soil. The eggs then hatch into aquatic larvae, which live in seepages in the soil, or in small streams. However, some species lack a larval stage, with the eggs hatching into juveniles with the same form as the adults, or else lack eggs and give birth to live young.

==Phylogeny==
Traditional taxonomy, which is reflected in the &quot;Scientific Classification&quot; box in this article, categorizes extant amphibia into three orders: &quot;Anura&quot; (frogs and toads), &quot;Caudata&quot; (newts and salamanders), and &quot;Gymnophiona&quot; (caecilians). However, there is considerable debate among paleontologists and molecular geneticists concerning the phylogenetic relationship between amphibians, and indeed whether &quot;Amphibia&quot; is a monophyletic clade or a polyphyletic collection of diverse evolutionary lineages.

The more limited debate (operating on the assumption that &quot;Amphibia&quot; is a monophyletic clade) is whether &quot;Caudata&quot; is more closely related to &quot;Anura&quot; (in a shared clade called &quot;Batrachia&quot; — the traditional view) or to &quot;Gymnophiona&quot; (suggested by research in 2005). The broader debate is whether &quot;Amphibia&quot; is monophyletic or polyphyletic. The latter view considers &quot;Caudata&quot; and &quot;Gymnophiona&quot; to be more closely related to amniotes (reptiles, mammals and birds) than to &quot;Anura&quot;.

<text>Fevre Dream is a 1982 vampire novel written by American author George R. R. Martin. It is set on the antebellum Mississippi River, beginning in 1857, and has been described by critics and Martin himself as &quot;Bram Stoker meets Mark Twain&quot;. About writing the novel, Martin said that &quot;It was strongly influenced by the time I spent in Dubuque, Iowa, where river steamboats were once built&quot;.

The novel was first published in the U.S. by Poseidon Press in 1982. It was later published as a mass market paperback in 1983 by Pocket Books. Both editions featured cover art by Barron Storey. The novel was also published in 1983 as a UK hardcover by Gollancz and in paperback by Sphere Books. In 2001, &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; was reprinted by Orion Books as volume 13 of their Fantasy Masterworks series. Bantam Books reprinted it as a paperback in 2004 and 2012. 

The novel was nominated in 1983 for both the Locus Award and World Fantasy Award.

==Plot==
In 1857, Abner Marsh, an unattractive but highly skilled Mississippi River captain, is grappling with a financial crisis when he is contacted by Joshua York, a rich, soft-spoken gentleman. They become unlikely business partners when Joshua promises to finance the construction of a magnificent new riverboat that will be larger, faster and more opulent than any other ever constructed.

When finally completed, the large white, blue and silver paddle steamer is christened &quot;Fevre Dream&quot;, for Abner&#x27;s previously failing company, the Fevre River Packet Company. Abner and Joshua co-captain the new vessel, with Abner being solely responsible for her actual command and navigation. Many questions are soon raised by both the crew and passengers about Joshua and his circle of unusual friends, who hardly ever venture out of their cabins during daylight hours. Abner&#x27;s own suspicions begin to grow when he finds scrapbooks in Joshua&#x27;s cabin containing newspaper clippings detailing many mysterious, unexplained deaths.

Abner confronts Joshua, who reveals that he and his friends are vampire hunters, using the &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; as their base of operations to investigate a trail of unusual deaths and disappearances along the river. Eventually he finally reveals the whole truth: He and his friends are themselves vampires, humanoid beings specialized for and dependent upon hunting humans. Joshua has developed a potion, using ancient alchemy and rudimentary chemistry, which controls the &quot;red thirst&quot; of all vampires. This has led many of his kind to consider him a kind of vampire messiah destined to free them from their bloodlust. Joshua&#x27;s companions have all submitted to his control as their lord (or &quot;bloodmaster&quot;).

The ancient and evil Damon Julian, a rival bloodmaster, soon learns of Joshua&#x27;s efforts. He boards the &quot;Fevre Dream&quot; with his own vampire followers and manages to overpower and depose Joshua, becoming the new bloodmaster of all vampires. Abner escapes and sets out to search for the &quot;Fevre Dream&quot;, which Julian now uses for his own nefarious purposes. After a failed attempt to retake the ship, Joshua convinces Abner to give up as he has already lost. 

Abner later serves as an agent of the Underground Railroad and the United States Navy during the Civil War, all the while being haunted by the memory of his lost riverboat, which he retells to others as a ghost story. Years later, in 1870, he receives a surprising letter from Joshua. He travels to New Orleans, where he learns Joshua&#x27;s mate Cynthia is pregnant, giving Joshua the will to finally depose Julian. Aboard the decaying &quot;Fevre Dream&quot;, the two vampires eventually square off. With the aid of Abner and the betrayal of Julian&#x27;s thrall Sour Billy, Joshua finally overpowers Julian and becomes the bloodmaster once again, before Abner kills Julian for good.

The novel closes many decades later by suggesting that all vampires, though still effectively immortal, were eventually freed from their blood addiction by Joshua&#x27;s potion and Abner&#x27;s brave efforts on their behalf. They make nighttime pilgrimages to Abner&#x27;s grave overlooking the river, continuing to honor his heroic contribution to their cause of freedom, Joshua most often of all.

==Graphic novel adaptation==

In 2010, Avatar Press published a 10-issue graphic novel adaptation by writer Daniel Abraham and artist Rafa Lopez. Mike Wolfer illustrated each cover for the miniseries, which was then collected and published by Avatar in 2011 as a single-volume hardcover.

<text>The Battle of the Zab (), also referred to in scholarly contexts as Battle of the Great Zāb River, took place on January 25, 750, on the banks of the Great Zab in what is now the modern country of Iraq. It spelled the end of the Umayyad Caliphate and the rise of the Abbasid Caliphate, which would last from 750 to 1517.

==Background==

In 747, a major rebellion broke out against the Umayyad Caliphate. The principal cause of the rebellion was the increasing gap between the outlying peoples of the Caliphate and the Damascus-based Umayyad government. The Umayyad-appointed governors of the Caliphate&#x27;s various provinces were corrupt and interested only with personal gains. Additionally, the Umayyads claimed no direct descent from Muhammad, while the Abbasids did (they descended from Muhammad&#x27;s uncle Abbas—a fact the latter used extensively during the revolution).

==Armies==

In 750, the army of the Umayyad caliph Marwan II fought a combined force of Abbasid, Shia, Khawarij, and Iraqi forces. Marwan&#x27;s army was, on paper at least, far larger and more formidable than that of his opponents, as it contained many veterans of earlier Umayyad campaigns against the Byzantine Empire; its support for the caliph, however, was only lukewarm. The morale of the Umayyads had been damaged by the series of defeats inflicted earlier in the rebellion, while the morale of the Abbasid armies had increased.

==Battle==

The Abbasid army formed a spear wall, a tactic they had adopted from their Umayyad opponents, presumably from witnessing it in earlier battles. This entailed standing in a battle line with their lances pointed at the enemy (similar to the stakes used by English longbowmen at Agincourt and Crécy many centuries later). The Umayyad cavalry charged, possibly believing that with their experience they could break the spear wall. This was a mistake on their part, however, and they were all but butchered. The Umayyad army fell into retreat, its morale finally shattered. Many were cut down by the zealous Abbasids or were drowned in the wintertime River Zab.

==Aftermath==

Marwan II himself escaped the battlefield and fled down the Levant, pursued relentlessly by the Abbasids, who met no serious resistance from the Syrians because the land had recently been laid waste by an earthquake and pestilence. Marwan fled at last to Abusir/Busir, which is a small town on the Egyptian Nile delta. It was there, a few months after the battle, that he was at last killed in a short battle and replaced as caliph by Saffah (), bringing to an end Umayyad rule in the Middle East.

<text>Quadra FNX Mining Ltd was a Vancouver, British Columbia-based company that produced copper, nickel, platinum, palladium, gold, cobalt, and molybdenum with operations in Nevada, Arizona, Chile, Greenland, and the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, Canada. 

Quadra FNX Mining was created by a merger of Quadra Mining Ltd. and FNX Mining Company Inc. in 2010. The company was taken over by KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. in 2012.

==Quadra history==
Quadra Resources Ltd. was incorporated in Vancouver, British Columbia on 15 May, 2002. The Company changed its name from Quadra Resources Ltd. to Quadra Mining Ltd. on 9 January, 2003. 

On 8 April, 2004, Quadra Mining Ltd. completed an initial public offering raising approximately $145 million. Quadra used a portion of the proceeds of the offering to acquire the interest in the Robinson Mine located near Ely, Nevada.

==FNX history==
FNX Mining Company Inc. was incorporated in Toronto, Ontario on 26 June, 1984. 

A former Inco geologist, Terry MacGibbon, took over the reins of FNX — then called Fort Knox Resources — in 1997 and renamed the company to FNX Mining Company Inc. 

==Merger and KGHM Takeover==
On 23 March 2010, FNX Mining Company Inc. announced that it agreed to be acquired by Vancouver-based Quadra Mining, pending ratification by the shareholders of both companies. Quadra operates the Robinson and Carlota copper mines in the US, and the Franke copper mining in Chile.

On 6 December 2011, Polish miner, KGHM Polska Miedz S.A. (World&#x27;s 9th largest producer of copper) has agreed to buy Quadra FNX Mining Ltd. for approximately C$2.9 bn. Each shareholder of Quadra FNX Mining received C$15.00 for each commonly held share. The internal funds of KGHM was used to secure the purchase with hopes of an expedient return on investment; through current project in Arizona, Nevada, Chile and Ontario, Canada. 

The takeover of Quadra by KGHM was completed on 5 March, 2012.

<text>The School of Edessa () was a Christian theological school of great importance to the Syriac-speaking world. It had been founded as long ago as the 2nd century by the kings of the Abgar dynasty. In 363, Nisibis fell to the Persians, causing St. Ephrem the Syrian, accompanied by a number of teachers, to leave the School of Nisibis. They went to Edessa, where Ephrem took over the directorship of its school. Then, its importance grew still further. There were innumerable monasteries at Edessa housing many monks. Ephrem occupied a cell there, practicing the ascetic life, interpreting Holy Scripture, composing poetry and hymns and teaching in the school, as well as instructing young girls in church music.

The first recorded director of the School of Edessa was Qiiore, in the early 5th century. He had ascetic and scholarly qualifications and an administrative ability. Occupying the Chair of Exegesis (&quot;mepasqana&quot;), he replaced the texts of Ephraim with those of Theodore of Mopsuestia. With that seminal decision, Qiiore embarked upon a course of study that was to mix the deductive principles of Aristotle with Theodore&#x27;s Dyophysite creed.

In 489, after the Nestorian Schism, the Byzantine emperor Zeno, acting on the advice of Bishop Cyrus II of Edessa, ordered the school summarily closed for its teachings of Nestorian doctrine. Its scholars moved back to the School of Nisibis.

==People==
The following people are associated with the School of Edessa:

*Barhadbshabba Arbaya, historian of the school (c.600)
*Barsauma of Nisibis, student and teacher (fl. 489)
*Elishaʿ bar Quzbaye, student (early 5th century)
*Ephrem the Syrian, teacher (360s)
*Ibas of Edessa, head (early 5th century)
*Jacob of Serugh, student (late 5th century)
*Narsai, student and head (fl. 471)

<doc id="932509" wikidata="Q3362880" url="?curid=932509" title="Fraser Papers">
<text>Fraser Papers Inc. was a Toronto, Ontario, Canada-based manufacturer of specialized printing, publishing, and converting papers, with customers in Canada and the United States. It managed more than two million acres (8,000 km2) of forest, operated a tree nursery, and sawmills. It was spun off as a public company in 2004 by parent Nexfor Inc., which became Norbord at the same time. Its stock traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange, under the symbol FPS.

==History==
Donald Fraser began his business with construction of a sawmill in 1877. Fraser sawmills at Cabano and Plaster Rock, New Brunswick were producing of spruce lumber annually through the mid-20th century. Sawmill edgings, slabs, and trimmings were converted to wood chips as a raw material for paper production.

At its nexus during the 1960s, Fraser Papers employed over 3,700 workers in several pulp and paper mills and saw mills throughout North America:

* Atholville, New Brunswick pulp mill
* Edmundston, New Brunswick pulp mill
* Madawaska, Maine paper mill
* Plaster Rock, New Brunswick saw mill
* Juniper, New Brunswick saw mill
* Thurso, Quebec pulp mill
* Cabano, Quebec saw mill (destroyed by fire in 1966)
* New Hampshire

The Edmundston-Madawaska mills are the only facilities in the world that pump pulp by pipeline over an international border.

In 2000, Nexfor Fraser Papers (as it was known at the time) was the first company to receive international certification to the Sustainable Forestry Initiative. Its operations are also certified to meet the ISO 14001 Standard for Environmental Management Systems requirements.

In June 2009, the company filed with the Canadian and American governments for bankruptcy protection so that it could re-structure. At the time Brookfield Asset Management owned a 70% share of the Fraser Papers company.

The Edmundston and Madawaska mills are still in operation but are now owned by Twin Rivers Paper Company, employing approximately 1000 workers.

<text>Hermann Hankel (14 February 1839 – 29 August 1873) was a German mathematician. Having worked on mathematical analysis during his career, he is best known for introducing the Hankel transform and the Hankel matrix.

==Biography==
Hankel was born on 14 February 1839 in Halle, Germany. His father, Wilhelm Gottlieb Hankel, was a physicist. Hankel studied at Nicolai Gymnasium in Leipzig before entering Leipzig University in 1857, where he studied with Moritz Drobisch, August Ferdinand Möbius and his father. In 1860, he started studying at University of Göttingen, where he acquired an interest in function theory under the tutelage of Bernhard Riemann. Following the publication of an award winning article, he proceeded to study under Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker in Berlin. He received his doctorate in 1862 at Leipzig University. Receiving his teaching qualifications a year after, he was promoted to an associate professor at Leipzig University in 1867. At the same year, he received his full professorship in University of Erlangen–Nuremberg and spent his last four years in University of Tübingen. He died from an illness on 29 August 1873 in Schramberg, near Tübingen. He was married to Marie Hankel.

In 1867, he published &quot;Theorie der Complexen Zahlensysteme&quot;, a treatise on complex analysis. His works on the theory of functions include 1870&#x27;s &quot;Untersuchungen über die unendlich oft oscillirenden und unstetigen functionen&quot; and his 1871 article “Grenze” for the Ersch-Gruber Encyklopädie. His work for &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot; has highlighted the importance of Bessel functions of the third kind, which were later known as Hankel functions.

His 1867 exposition on complex numbers and quaternions is particularly memorable. For example, Fischbein notes that he solved the problem of products of negative numbers by proving the following theorem: &quot;The only multiplication in R which may be considered as an extension of the usual multiplication in R+ by &quot;respecting the law of distributivity&quot; to the left and the right is that which conforms to the rule of signs.&quot;
Furthermore, Hankel draws attention to the linear algebra that Hermann Grassmann had developed in his &quot;Extension Theory&quot; in two publications. This was the first of many references later made to Grassmann&#x27;s early insights on the nature of space.

<doc id="932516" wikidata="Q825206" url="?curid=932516" title="Software Freedom Day">
<text>Software Freedom Day (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of Free Software organized by the Digital Freedom Foundation (DFF). SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.

SFD was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28 August of that year. About 12 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and while organisers anticipated more than 1,000 teams in 2010 the event has stalled at around 400+ locations over the past two years, representing a 30% decrease over 2009.

Since 2006, Software Freedom Day has been held on the third Saturday of September. In 2025, this event will be held on the 20th of September.

== Organization ==

Each event is left to local teams around the world to organize. Pre-registered teams (2 months before the date or earlier) receive free schwag sent by DFF to help with the events themselves. The SFD wiki contains individual team pages describing their plans as well as helpful information to get them up to speed. Events themselves vary between conferences explaining the virtues of Free and Open Source Software, to workshops, demonstrations, games, planting tree ceremonies, discussions and InstallFests.

=== Past events ===

Note on the figures above: it is difficult to find figures of the early years. The maps on the SFD website are only reliable after 2007, however some years such as 2009 saw extra teams from two different sources which did not &quot;officially&quot; register with DFF. There was about 80 teams from China and a hundred from the Sun community (OSUM) who heavily subsidized goodies for their teams. In the early year of SFD the map was an optional component not connected with the registration script and therefore some teams did not go through the troubles of adding themselves.

== Sponsors ==

In the past, the event has been sponsored by entities like Canonical Ltd., IBM, Sun Microsystems, DKUUG, Google, Red Hat, Linode, Nokia and MakerBot Industries.

Currently, this event is supported by Earth Cause, Linode, Mailman, Musescore, Digital Peak, FSF, FSFE, Joomla, Creative Commons, Admin Magazine, Linux Journal, Ubuntu User and Woman Tech.

Each local team can seek sponsors independently, especially local FOSS supporting organizations and often appears in local medias such as newspapers and TV.

<doc id="932529" wikidata="Q230698" url="?curid=932529" title="List of amendments to the Constitution of the United States">
<text>Thirty-three amendments to the Constitution of the United States have been proposed by the United States Congress and sent to the states for ratification since the Constitution was put into operation on March 4, 1789. Twenty-seven of those, having been ratified by the requisite number of states, are part of the Constitution. The first ten amendments were adopted and ratified simultaneously and are known collectively as the Bill of Rights. The 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments are collectively known as the Reconstruction Amendments. Six amendments adopted by Congress and sent to the states have not been ratified by the required number of states. Four of those amendments are still pending, one is closed and has failed by its own terms, and one is closed and has failed by the terms of the resolution proposing it. All 27 ratified and six unratified amendments are listed and detailed in the tables below.

== Proposal and ratification process ==
Article Five of the United States Constitution details the two-step process for amending the nation&#x27;s plan of government. Amendments must be properly &quot;proposed&quot; and &quot;ratified&quot; before becoming operative. This process was designed to strike a balance between the excesses of constant change and inflexibility.

An amendment may be proposed and sent to the states for ratification by either:

* The U.S. Congress, whenever a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives deem it necessary; or
* A national convention, called by Congress for this purpose, on the application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the states (34 since 1959). This option has never been used.

To become part of the Constitution, an amendment must be ratified by three-fourths of the states (38 since 1959) by either (as determined by Congress):

* The legislatures of three-fourths of the states; or
* State ratifying conventions in three-fourths of the states. The only amendment to be ratified through this method thus far is the Twenty-first Amendment in 1933. That amendment is also the only one that explicitly repeals an earlier one, the Eighteenth Amendment (ratified in 1919), establishing the prohibition of alcohol.

Congress has also enacted statutes governing the constitutional amendment process. When a constitutional amendment is sent to the states for ratification, the Archivist of the United States is charged with responsibility for administering the ratification process under the provisions of . Then, upon being properly ratified, the archivist issues a certificate proclaiming that an amendment has become an operative part of the Constitution.

Since the early 20th century, Congress has, on several occasions, stipulated that an amendment must be ratified by the required number of states within seven years from the date of its submission to the states in order to become part of the Constitution. Congress&#x27;s authority to set a ratification deadline was affirmed in 1939 by the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Coleman v. Miller&quot; (). In the absence of a deadline, an amendment can be pending indefinitely and ratified long after being proposed to the states.

Approximately 11,848 proposals to amend the Constitution have been introduced in Congress since 1789 (). Collectively, members of the House and Senate typically propose around 200 amendments during each two-year term of Congress. Proposals have covered numerous topics, but none made in recent decades have become part of the Constitution. Historically, most died in the congressional committees to which they were assigned. Since 1999, only about 20 proposed amendments have received a vote by either the full House or Senate. The last time a proposal gained the necessary two-thirds support in both the House and the Senate for submission to the states was the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment in 1978. Only 16 states had ratified it when the seven-year time limit expired.

<doc id="932532" wikidata="Q4787091" url="?curid=932532" title="Architecture for Humanity">
<text>Architecture for Humanity was a US-based charitable organization that sought architectural solutions to humanitarian crises and brought professional design services to clients (often communities in need). Founded in 1999, it laid off its staff and closed down at the beginning of January 2015.

Since then, the 59 US-based architecture for humanity chapters (which were already operating more or less in a self-sufficient manner even before Architecture for Humanity closed down) formed the Open Architecture Collaborative and vowed to continue. It could thus be argued that despite the closing of the main office, the movement that Architecture for Humanity represented has indeed been strengthened, and not weakened, as it has forced the chapters to operate truly self-sufficiently, and cooperate more directly with the other chapters.

==History==
The organization was founded on April 6, 1999, by Cameron Sinclair and Kate Stohr in response to the need for immediate long-term shelter for returning refugees in Kosovo after the region&#x27;s bloody conflict. After hosting a series of open design competitions, the organization began taking on a number of build projects, pairing local communities with design professionals to develop a ground-up alternative to development and reconstruction.

In 2005 it adopted an &quot;open source&quot; model and became the first organization in the world to utilize Creative Commons licensing system on a physical structure. To date it has worked in 45 countries and over 2.8 million people now live, work, learn, gather and heal in 2,348 places helped by Architecture for Humanity design fellows, chapter members and volunteer design professionals.

In 2006 the organization published &quot;Design Like You Give A Damn: Architectural Responses to Humanitarian Crises&quot;, which chronicles its early history. The second volume, &quot;DLYGAD: Building Change from the Ground Up&quot;, was published in 2012.

In 2007, Architecture for Humanity launched Open Architecture Network, allowing architects, designers, innovators and community leaders to share innovative and sustainable ideas, designs and plans.

In 2010, Architecture for Humanity acquired Worldchanging.

Stohr departed the organization in May 2013 and Sinclair followed in October 2013;. Clark Manus was made interim Executive Director before being replaced by Sam Hartwell. In 2014 former studio director Eric Cesal became Executive Director.

The staff was laid off on January 1, 2015, and the organization&#x27;s San Francisco office was closed down. Among the causes for its closure are its inability to raise adequate funds after the novelty of its mission was no longer appealing. Another factor cited is that humanitarian shelter design was not considered a fundamental human right.

After the bankruptcy of Architecture for Humanity in 2015, local chapters have formed a new organization: Open Architecture Collaborative.

In 2016, a lawsuit was filed in which the founders and board members of Architecture for Humanity were sued for $3 million for the alleged misuse of donations. The suit names 170 creditors who allege leadership used restricted monies for overhead and operational costs. In 2017, the suit was dismissed.

==Activity==
===Pro-bono design and construction===
The organization provided pro-bono design and construction management services and funding for projects around the world, including developing and building schools in West Africa and Haiti, developing long-term rebuilding efforts in Myanmar after Cyclone Nargis, and constructing sports for social change facilities in Africa and South America. Work has also included long-term reconstruction in India and Sri Lanka following the Indian Ocean tsunami, rebuilding initiatives in the United States after Hurricane Katrina, and hosting a number of international design competitions.

Architecture for Humanity promoted humanitarian and social design through partnerships, advocacy and education based programs. To that end, they have consulted with government bodies and relief organizations on a number of projects, including landmine clearance programs and playground building in the Balkans; transitional housing for IDPs in Afghanistan, Sudan and Grenada; school building in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda; and earthquake reconstruction assistance in Pakistan, Turkey and Iran. The organization also sought to foster public appreciation for the many ways that architecture and design can improve lives.

===Open Architecture Network===

As a result of the TED Prize the organization worked with Sun Microsystems and Creative Commons to develop the Open Architecture Network, the first open source system for supporting sustainable and humanitarian design and architecture. This network includes project management, file sharing, a resource database and online collaborative design tools. A beta version of the site launched on March 8, 2007, at the 2007 TED Conference. It has garnered over 27,000 members and 5,000 projects. In late 2010 a version of the network was created as a mobile application that is showcased in the Museum of Modern Art.

==Organization==
Architecture for Humanity had more than 60 chapters spanning many countries at its peak assisting many independent charities. The chapters worked primarily in their own regions. In August 2008, members of Architecture for Humanity New York were declared New Yorkers of the Week by cable news network NY1 for the chapter&#x27;s first project.

After the main office and parent organization closed in January 2015, many of the chapters formed an alliance and vowed to persevere. 59 chapters joined this federation and continued to work on pro bono projects around the world. As of September 2015, there are still 57 active chapters listed on the alliance&#x27;s website.

==Recognition==
In 2005 Architecture for Humanity received the Index Award - Design to Improve Life (community category), in 2006 it was awarded the Rave Award for Architecture by &quot;Wired&quot; magazine and the Innovation of the Year as part of the Observer Newspapers&#x27; Ethical Awards, and in 2007 it won the Center for Architecture Foundation Award. In March 2006 its co-founder Cameron Sinclair was awarded the 2006 TED Prize, which awards its recipients &quot;One wish to change the world&quot;.

In May 2008, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum awarded Architecture for Humanity the Design Patron Award, highlighting its commitment to improving communities by providing pro bono, sustainable design services.

In June 2008 the organization was profiled on &quot;Frontline&quot; as part of their series of Stories From A Small Planet. That year co-founder Cameron Sinclair was profiled as one of CNN&#x27;s Principal Voices and on the series &quot;Iconoclasts&quot; on the Sundance Channel.

==International design competitions==
Architecture for Humanity has hosted a series of open international design competitions focused on systemic issues of poverty. These have included including Siyathemba youth sports and outreach facility; Outreach - Design Ideas for Mobile Health Clinic to Combat HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa; and Transitional Housing for Kosovo&#x27;s Returning Refugees.

In 2007 the organization began hosting its competitions on the Open Architecture Network and every two years hosted its premier design competition, The Open Architecture Challenge. The year of the inaugural competition, the AMD Open Architecture Challenge, sought ideas to develop innovative off the grid technology centers. Clients included a chocolate co-operative in Ecuador, a youth center in Kenya and a medical organization in Nepal. The competition culminated in the construction of a youth community and resource center in Nairobi, Kenya.

The 2009 Open Architecture Challenge was launched on January 29 at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. With support of more than two dozen organizations it invited architects and designers to partner with schools to design cost effective and sustainable classrooms. An international jury convened in July at the 2009 Aspen Ideas festival and selected eight finalists from the tens of thousands of entries from more than 65 countries.

<doc id="932537" wikidata="Q1438987" url="?curid=932537" title="Fortis Inc.">
<text>Fortis Inc. is a St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador-based international diversified electric utility holding company. It operates in Canada, the United States, Central America, and the Caribbean. In 2015, it earned .

Fortis was formed in 1987, when shareholders of the regulated transmission and distribution utility Newfoundland Light &amp; Power Co. voted to form a separate holding company. NL&amp;P shares were exchanged for Fortis shares on a one-to-one basis, with the regulated NL&amp;P becoming a 100% owned subsidiary.

==Expansion==
The company expanded into Western Canada in 2003 with its purchase of Aquila, Inc.&#x27;s Canadian assets, formerly owned by TransAlta, Canada&#x27;s largest publicly traded utility. As a result of this acquisition, Fortis became one of Alberta&#x27;s major regulated electrical distribution companies, serving 415,000 Albertans in 2005. ATCO Electric is Alberta&#x27;s other regulated distribution company. Also as a result of the 2003 acquisition, Fortis owns regulated generation, transmission, and distribution assets in British Columbia.

In 2007, Fortis acquired Terasen Gas from Kinder Morgan, which had sold the BC gas utility as a non-strategic asset included in its 2005 acquisition of Terasen Inc.

In addition to its regulated Canadian assets, Fortis also owns unregulated assets in Ontario, British Columbia, and Newfoundland. The majority of its unregulated business consists of hydroelectric generating plants.

Fortis&#x27; interests in the Caribbean include a 67% interest in Belize Electricity Limited (BEL) and a 95% interest in Belize Electric Co. Ltd. The Belize Association of Non-Government Organisations took Fortis to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 2003 to have a new environmental assessment of the Chalillo Dam on the Macal River which was a hydroelectricity development project. Ecologists were concerned over the future of species such as the scarlet macaw, the tapir and the black howler monkey as the project would flood 10 km2 of rainforest in Belize. Celebrities such as Harrison Ford and Cameron Diaz supported a movement to stop this dam. Fortis and the Government of Belize supported the project.

On May 30, 2011, it was announced that Fortis has plans to acquire Central Vermont Public Service, an electric utility in the US state of Vermont, for US$700 million, pending stockholder and regulatory approval; this acquisition would be Fortis&#x27; first utility acquisition in the United States. Gaz Métro offered a higher price and acquired CVPS.

On February 21, 2012, CH Energy Group (a holding company for Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric, an upstate New York utility), announced a pending acquisition by Fortis valued at $1.5 billion. On June 27, 2013, Fortis Inc. closed on its acquisition of CHG.

In 2013, Fortis announced its acquisition of UNS Energy, an Arizona utility company.

On February 9, 2016, Fortis announced an agreement to acquire ITC Holdings Corp., the largest independent transmission utility in the United States, for US$11.3 billion in cash and stock.

==Operations==
Fortis currently owns the following regulated utilities:

* FortisBC, a utility in British Columbia
* FortisAlberta Inc., a holding company for assets purchased from Aquila, Inc.
* Central Hudson Gas &amp; Electric, a utility in New York
* Tucson Electric Power and UniSource Energy Services, utilities in Arizona

<doc id="932543" wikidata="Q1400022" url="?curid=932543" title="Winnipeg River">
<text>Winnipeg River is a Canadian river that flows roughly northwest from Lake of the Woods in the province of Ontario to Lake Winnipeg in Manitoba. This river is long from the Norman Dam in Kenora to its mouth at Lake Winnipeg. Its watershed is in area, mainly in Canada. About of the watershed is in northern Minnesota, United States.

The Winnipeg River watershed was the southeasternmost portion of the land granted in 1670 to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. The portion in Canada corresponds roughly to the land deeded to Canada in Treaty 3, signed in 1873 by Her Majesty&#x27;s treaty commissioners and the First Nation chiefs at Northwest Angle on the Lake of the Woods. The river&#x27;s name means &quot;murky water&quot; in Cree.

This river route was used by natives for thousands of years before European contact. French and English colonists also began to use the river in order to reach First Nations for the fur trade, with trade interactions for hundreds of years. It is the only major water route between what is now Ontario and southern Manitoba that was easily navigable by canoe. The Red River route was much farther south and had a longer portage. La Vérendrye was one of the first explorers to establish fur trade forts near the First Nations camps along the river.

The river section through Whiteshell Provincial Park has many petroforms near the Whiteshell River forks where the two rivers meet. These petroforms are an ancient reminder of the importance of the area for native travel, trade, ceremonies, harvesting, and settlements.

Since 1906 the river has been an important source of hydroelectric power to the city of Winnipeg.

== Geography ==
The Winnipeg River watershed stretches to the height of land about west of Lake Superior.

Major modern communities along the banks of the Winnipeg River include Kenora, Minaki and Whitedog in Ontario; and Lac du Bonnet, Pinawa, Powerview, and Pine Falls, all in Manitoba. Whitedog is the home of the Wabaseemoong First Nation. The Sagkeeng First Nation is located near the mouth of the Winnipeg River and Pine Falls.

In Ontario, dams were built on the Winnipeg River at Kenora, exiting Lake of the Woods, and at Whitedog Falls. Power from the dams have supplied Kenora and a local pulp and paper mill, while local Anishinaabe populations have been negatively impacted by consequent environmental degradation. In Manitoba, there are six hydroelectric dams: Pointe du Bois Generating Station at Pointe du Bois, Slave Falls a few kilometres downstream, Seven Sisters Generating Station at Seven Sisters Falls, MacArthur Falls Generating Station, Great Falls Generating Station, and Pine Falls Generating Station at Powerview, Manitoba.

Flows on the Winnipeg River are controlled through the various dams by the Lake of the Woods Control Board. It maintains a website with detailed descriptions of the river basin and water flow characteristics.

==Exploration and fur trade==

The Winnipeg River was the main route from the Great Lakes to Western Canada before the railroads were constructed in this area. After reaching Lake Winnipeg, a traveler could go by canoe as far as the Rocky Mountains, Arctic Ocean or Hudson Bay. This section covers the route from Lake Superior to Lake Winnipeg via Rainy Lake, the Rainy River, Lake of the Woods and the Winnipeg River. For the route in general, see Nelson River basin.

The area was too rocky to be good beaver country, as they needed a forested habitat. Grand Portage was the second-longest portage in Canada after Methye Portage. Once over the height of land, rivers led west to Rainy Lake and the Rainy River. Duncan M&#x27;Gillivray called the Rainy the &#x27;most beautiful river in the north&#x27;. George Simpson and many others made similar comments.

The route went up the east side of Lake of the Woods and over the Rat Portage (Kenora) to the Winnipeg. The Winnipeg River was notorious for its many portages and décharges. Three were known as the Dales, Portage de l&#x27;Isle, and La Rivière Blanche, named for its white water. This last was the scene of many deaths. Its seven portages were all visible from the same spot. After the last portage, at Manitou Rapids, the river opened out into the Bas de la Rivière and then the lake. About halfway up the river, the English River led to Fort Albany on James Bay.

In 1679 Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut, reached the western tip of Lake Superior. In 1688 Jacques de Noyon went from Kaministiquia as far as Rainy Lake and perhaps beyond. He seems to have been followed by &quot;coureurs des bois&quot;, who may have gotten as far as Lake Winnipeg. They left no records, but the English on Hudson Bay heard reports of the coureurs in 1718 if not earlier. In 1717 Zacharie Robutel de La Noue tried and failed to penetrate the area.

Opening of the land west of Lake Superior by a European is credited to La Vérendrye in 1731–1743. In 1731 his men built a post on Rainy Lake. In 1732 he built Fort Saint Charles on Lake of the Woods. In 1733 one of his sons almost reached Lake Winnipeg but was blocked by ice. In 1734 two explorers reported that they had reached the south end of Lake Winnipeg, and La Vérendrye ordered the first Fort Maurepas to be built there soon after. By 1743 the French had reached the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan rivers and had sent explorers to present-day North Dakota and, probably, Wyoming in what is now the United States.

All this drew trade away from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. After the British conquest of Canada as part of its victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War, French traders were largely replaced by &quot;pedlars&quot; (as the HBC people called them) from Montreal. The pedlars soon formed the North West Company, which was capitalized by both English and Scots. From about 1775 the HBC began building competing posts in the interior, including one on the Rainy River. Competition ended in 1821 when the two companies merged and trade was diverted to York Factory on Hudson Bay. Trade was also diverted south as population grew on the United States side. The last major use of the route was by the Wolseley Expedition in 1870. After 1885 the Canadian Pacific Railway connected eastern and western Canada with a route north of Lake Superior.

Trading posts on the route were:
*Lake Superior: 1.Fort Kaministiquia (1717), later called Fort William, Ontario (NWC, 1803) and 2. Grand Portage with Fort Charlotte;
*Rainy River: Fort Saint Pierre (1731), Fort Lac la Pluie (NWC, circa 1780), Asp House (HBC 1794), Hungry Hall (HBC 1825);
*Lake of the Woods: Fort Saint Charles (1732);
*Winnipeg River Mouth:Fort Maurepas (Canada) (c 1739), Fort Bas de la Rivière (NWC, 1792), Fort Alexander (HBC, before 1800)

<text>The Dolly Sods Wilderness (DSW, originally simply Dolly Sods) is a U.S. Wilderness Area in the Allegheny Mountains of eastern West Virginia and is part of the Monongahela National Forest of the U.S. Forest Service.

Dolly Sods is a rocky, high-altitude plateau with sweeping vistas and lifeforms normally found much farther north in Canada. To the north, the distinctive landscape of &quot;the Sods&quot; is characterized by stunted (&quot;flagged&quot;) trees, wind-carved boulders, heath barrens, grassy meadows created in the last century by logging and fires, and sphagnum bogs that are much older. To the south, a dense cove forest occupies the branched canyon incised by the North Fork of Red Creek.

The name derives from an 18th-century German homesteading family, the Dahles, and a local term for an open mountaintop meadow, a &quot;sods&quot;.

==Geography==

===Topography===
Dolly Sods is the highest plateau east of the Mississippi River with altitudes ranging from at the outlet of Red Creek to at the top of the eastern edge mountain ridge on the Allegheny Front. Much of the high plateau section lies at nearly elevation. Prominent summits within the wilderness are Coal Knob (), Breathed Mountain (), and Blackbird Knob (). The highest point in the immediate area (just outside the Dolly Sods Wilderness area in the Roaring Plains West Wilderness) is Mount Porte Crayon (). The summit area around Mount Porte Crayon is the largest flat-topped plateau in Eastern North America containing above elevation.

===Drainage===
Dolly Sods is on a ridge crest that forms part of the Eastern Continental Divide. Most of its area is drained by the North Fork of Red Creek, which is a tributary of the Dry Fork River. Via the Dry Fork, Black Fork, Cheat, Monongahela and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. South of Forest Service Route 19 is the adjoining Red Creek–Flatrock–Roaring Plains area, which is drained by the South Fork of Red Creek. Drainage on the east side of the ridge crest flows into the headwaters of the South Branch Potomac River, which is part of the Chesapeake Bay watershed.

===Boundaries===
The original Dolly Sods was a mountaintop meadow of about at the southern end of Rohrbaugh Plains, near the present Dolly Sods Picnic Area. The present-day DSW encompasses some of U.S. Forest Service land and is part of a larger area now known as &quot;Dolly Sods&quot;. The DSW is bordered by Forest Service Routes 75 and 19 on the east and south sides, respectively. (Since the early 1970s it has been common practice to include the Red Creek Plains, Flatrock Plains, and Roaring Plains areas to the south as part of the greater Dolly Sods area. Formerly, the area encompassed by these three mountaintop flats – all south of FS Rt 19 – was known locally and collectively as Huckleberry Plain.)

To the northeast, DSW is bordered by the Bear Rocks Preserve, owned by The Nature Conservancy. The surrounding area was recently added to the wilderness and is known as Dolly Sods North (the high sods). North of Dolly Sods North (and just outside the present DSW) is an area known as Dobbins Slashings—a sub-arctic bog forming the headwaters of Red Creek on Cabin Mountain. Dobbins Slashings has also been proposed for wilderness preservation. In the Canaan Valley to the west, the DSW is adjoined by the Canaan Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Almost all of DSW is in the southeast corner of Tucker County with only very small sections extending into Randolph and Grant Counties.

===Trails===
There are some of hiking trails within the DSW (see below), many situated along the courses of abandoned railroad grades and old logging roads. The premier viewpoint within the wilderness, affording a vista of the entire Red Creek drainage, is at a set of rocky crags known as Lion&#x27;s Head Rock. It is reached by an almost three-mile climb from the nearest road. The last quarter mile is an eight-foot-wide bench (an old railroad grade) in the side of an otherwise steep slope. Like the cliffs constituting the eastern edge of the DSW at Rohrbaugh Plains, Lion&#x27;s Head Rock consists of a mixture of sandstone and conglomerate. The Northland Loop Trail is a interpretive trail just south of Red Creek Campground on FS Rt 75 which accesses Alder Run Bog a typical, and much studied, northern bog or southern muskeg.

==History==

===Pre-logging===
The Dolly Sods area was first encountered by Europeans when Peter Jefferson, Thomas Lewis and others surveyed in 1746 to find the limits of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron&#x27;s land grant from the British Crown. The famous Fairfax Line grazes the northern margin of the wilderness near Bear Rocks. This area was generally avoided as too difficult to traverse until the late 19th century. David Hunter Strother wrote an early and somewhat breathless travelogue of the area, published in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Monthly&quot; magazine in 1852:

In Randolph County, Virginia, is a tract of country containing from seven to nine hundred square miles, entirely uninhabited, and so savage and inaccessible that it has rarely been penetrated even by the most adventurous. The settlers on its borders speak of it with a sort of dread, and regard it as an ill-omened region, filled with bears, panthers, impassable laurel-brakes, and dangerous precipices. Stories are told of hunters having ventured too far, becoming entangled, and perishing in its intricate labyrinths. The desire of daring the unknown dangers of this mysterious region, stimulated a party of gentlemen . . . to undertake it in June, 1851. They did actually penetrate the country as far as the Falls of the Blackwater, and returned with marvelous accounts of its savage grandeur, and the quantities of game and fish to be found there.

The name Dolly Sods derives from the family name of Johann Dahle (1749–1847), a German immigrant who settled nearby. Such early settlers used the natural open fields on mountainsides known as &quot;sods&quot;. Logged out and burned over areas produced additional good grass cover for grazing sheep and cattle. (Repeated burning, however, killed the grass and left only bracken fern, which was useless as fodder.) Locals changed the spelling of Dahle to &quot;Dolly,&quot; and thus one such area became known as Dolly Sods. The Dahle family eventually moved on, leaving behind only the Americanized version of their name.

Local historian Hu Maxwell described the Dolly Sods area in the Wheeling &quot;Intelligencer&quot; in 1886: &quot;The top of the mountain is flat, except here and there rugged ridges and huge promontories of rocks rising above the level of the plains, and giving the scene an appearance of distance and mystery that must be witnessed before it can be understood&quot;.

===Logging era===
The area surrounding Dolly Sods was formerly described as the best spruce-hemlock-black cherry forest in the world, with some enormous trees up to in diameter. The huge spruce and hemlock became accessible in 1884 when the West Virginia Central and Pittsburgh Railroad, a predecessor of the Western Maryland Railway, first arrived at nearby Davis from a junction with the B&amp;O Railroad at Piedmont. In 1899, the Parsons Pulp and Lumber Company established a sawmill at Dobbin on the North Branch Potomac River in Grant County. In 1902, a band saw mill was constructed on the main stem of Red Creek. The lumber boom town of Laneville sprang up around it with a population that peaked at over 300 people.Shay locomotives climbed the temporary railroads into the mountains and backcountry logging camps sprang up throughout the Sods. Teams of draft horses dragged the timber to the nearest tracks. When the timber was exhausted in the sector around one camp, the rails were taken up and reused elsewhere. It was into the mill at Laneville that most of the timber of the southern two thirds of the Sods disappeared.

The humus covering the ground dried up when the protective tree cover was removed. Sparks from the locomotives, saw mills and logger&#x27;s warming fires easily ignited this humus layer and the extensive slash—wood too small to be marketable, such as branches and tree crowns—left behind by loggers. Fires repeatedly ravaged the area in the 1910s, scorching everything right down to the underlying rocks. All insects, worms, salamanders, mice and other burrowing forms of life perished. The destruction was extraordinary. The complete clearcut of this ecologically fragile area, followed by extensive wildfires and overgrazing, exacerbated by the ecological stresses of the elevation, have prevented quick regeneration of the forest which has taken decades to recover. The Monongahela National Forest was created in 1915, largely motivated by a desire to mitigate the sort of wholesale destruction that had swept over the Sods. In 1916 most of Dolly Sods was purchased by the federal government. Mineral rights remained in private ownership.

The Laneville mill closed in 1920 after almost all the timber had been cut, and the local population dwindled. The last timber was felled in the Dolly Sods area in 1924. A particularly ferocious fire raged in late July 1930 in the northernmost Red Creek and southernmost Stony River watersheds (along the Grant/Tucker County line). This conflagration—known as the Dobbin Slashings Fire—consumed and killed many trees left alone as non-commercial by the loggers. An eerie landscape persisted here for years, with the stumps of these trees perched high upon jumbles of boulders. In the 1930s, the Civilian Conservation Corps made some modest attempts to remediate the damage to Dolly Sods by re-planting stands of red spruce there.

===Army use and cleanup===
In 1943-44, as part of the West Virginia Maneuver Area, the U.S. Army used the area as a practice artillery and mortar range and maneuver area before troops were sent to Europe to fight in World War II, with Cabin Mountain and Blackbird Knob serving as designated targets.

In 1997, a work crew extensively surveyed trail locations and known campsites for shells. Workers made 32,594 excavations along the trails and discovered and detonated 14 live mortar shells, most along the Fisher Spring Run Trail. All were exploded on site. Two others were inert. They also found numerous railroad spikes, iron tools and horseshoes left over from logging days. Off-trail searches proved to be impossible, so some of the artillery and mortar shells (60 mm and 81 mm rounds) shot into the area likely still remain there. (See this link for a photo of two shells found in July 2006.)

===Threat and recovery===
Dolly Sods became popular with recreationalists and conservationists in the mid-1960s at which time political agitation began to set it aside as a preserve. Local farmers also ceased allowing their livestock to graze here at this time.

Nevertheless, the area was threatened by at least four potential developments:
#sub-divisions for summer homes on Cabin Mountain,
#as a route for a proposed federal expressway (Corridor H) linking Washington, DC with the highlands,
#strip-mining of as many as six coal seams, which was already occurring within of the Sods in the north and
#flooding of a reservoir as part of the proposed Davis Power Project just to the west.

An &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee of stakeholders was convened by the MNF in 1969. It advised that a scenic or botanical area should be set aside in the North Fork Red Creek area. In October 1970, the forest superintendent announced the creation of &quot;Dolly Sods Scenic Area&quot;. The Nature Conservancy played a major role in preserving the area. By 1972, it had purchased the coal rights under the future federal wilderness () of the Sods and Roaring Plains for $15 million. Dolly Sods finally became a federally designated wilderness area in 1975 which resulted in greatly increased numbers of visitors. The area had only an estimated 500 visitors in 1965; by 1997 there were 7,499 registered (and many more unregistered) users annually.

In the 1970s and 1980s, it was not possible to propose Dolly Sods North for wilderness classification as it was all privately owned by the Western Maryland Railway Company and the Virginia Electric and Power Company and was largely outside the proclamation boundary of the MNF. Public acquisition could not go forward as the companies refused to sell. In 1993, however, the Nature Conservancy paid another $6 million to acquire in Dolly Sods North (of the total of ) from Quintana Corporation. This land was then donated to the Forest Service. Most recently, the Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 added of Dolly Sods North to the original of the wilderness to make the present total of .

==Climate and weather==
The climate of Dolly Sods is classified as humid continental, similar to portions of Canada. Daily weather can vary greatly with large extremes in temperature occurring dangerously fast. Fog can form/roll in extremely quickly, dropping visibility to dangerous, disorienting near-zero conditions. Access roads can quickly become blocked by dense fog, downed trees from high wind, and snow/snow drifts.

Summers are cool and wet. At the average afternoon maximum is around , and the average morning minimum is between . Thunderstorms are frequent during the warmer months. Frosts and freezes can occur any month of the year. Winters are typically cold, windy, and snowy. Minimum temperatures can drop to . The average seasonal snowfall is around . In exceptionally snowy winters, large drifts of up to can form, lasting in sheltered locations into May. Due to high elevation, frequently located at cloud level, spectacular rime ice is frequently seen totally coating the forest in pure white.

Despite the overall vigorous winter, the relative southern location (39th North parallel) allows for occasional intrusions of warmer, well above freezing air from the Gulf of Mexico. Thus, rain can occur during even the coldest winter months. During one of the snowiest winters in history (2009–10), about of snow is estimated to have fallen above .

This section of the Allegheny Front is one of the windiest spots east of the Mississippi. The effect of these winds can be seen in the flag-form red spruce trees; their branches grow mostly on one side (east), away from the prevailing west winds. Because of the drying influence of the winds, stunted branches are produced on the west side of the tree above the protective shrub layer. Stunted branches on the east side give the trees a twisted appearance. Where spruce are protected by a shrub layer, luxuriant webs of branches extend for a radius of a dozen feet, giving a mat-like look to vegetation.

==Ecology==

===Flora===

Dolly Sods is well known for its open expanses of sphagnum bog, heath shrubs and scattered and stunted red spruce—all creating impressions of areas much farther north. Many plant communities are indeed similar to those of sea-level eastern Canada. But the ecosystems within the Sods are remarkably varied. In recent decades, the many stages of ecologic succession throughout the Sods have made the region one of enduring interest to botanists.

====Sods (grass balds)====
The local term &quot;sods&quot; is a traditional name referring to several high-elevation meadows in the High Alleghenies. The term is virtually synonymous with the &quot;grass bald&quot; of the southern Appalachians. These grassy areas on mountain slopes or summits apparently existed by the scores in the mid-Appalachian region when first discovered. According to botanist Earl L. Core, &quot;The silvery sheen of the grass, against the dark green background of the spruce, attracted the attention of the early settlers... The dominant grass is Allegheny flyback (&quot;Danthonia compressa&quot;), a grass so light in weight that it would &quot;fly back&quot; against the scythe of the mower&quot;.

The origin of these grassy tracts has been the subject of wide-ranging speculation. Core favored a multi-factorial explanation involving a &quot;bald-susceptible zone&quot; present at mountain summits where various causes (extreme weather, fires, etc.) initially wiped out trees followed by succession by grasses that was so competitive with the new tree seedlings that the cleared areas persist for a much longer period than at lower elevations.

====Heath barrens (huckleberry plains)====
The extensive views across the tundra-like windswept open meadows in the northern section of Dolly Sods are reminiscent of Alaskan landscapes. &quot;Heath barrens&quot; is a botanical term, but the traditional local name for these unusual expanses was &quot;huckleberry plains&quot;. These upper reaches have been extensively colonized by various Ericaceae (heaths): blueberry and cranberry (&quot;Vaccinium&quot;), huckleberry (&quot;Gaylussacia&quot;), rose azalea (&quot;Rhododendron prinophyllum&quot;) and rosebay rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot;), mountain laurel (&quot;Kalmia latifolia&quot;), teaberry (or wintergreen, &quot;Gaultheria&quot;), and Allegheny menziesia (&quot;Rhododendron pilosum&quot;). Members of Rosaceae (the rose family) also abound: chokeberry, mountain ashes, serviceberry, and pin cherry (&quot;Prunus pensylvanica&quot;). Boulder fields left by the denuding topsoil fires of 80 years ago are extensive.

====Sphagnum glades (cranberry bogs)====
Spruce-edged sphagnum bogs are found in the upper sections of Red Creek and its tributaries, often in association with thickets of speckled alder. There are similar areas throughout the High Alleghenies, most famously the Cranberry Glades. The largest one at Dolly Sods is about a mile long and half a mile wide. The thick carpet of sphagnum moss and the polytrichum moss hummocks also sustain cotton grass, round leaf sundew and the lichen known as reindeer moss. In addition to the spruce, the bog margins are frequented by ferns, sedges and the occasional balsam fir. The three-toothed cinquefoil (&quot;Sibbaldiopsis tridentata&quot;) is often abundant and orchids—for example the pink lady&#x27;s slipper—are sometimes seen.

====Hardwood forests====
The more southerly section of the Dolly Sods Wilderness includes maturing spruce copses, rhododendron thickets, northern hardwoods on the ridges and cove hardwoods in the deep tributaries of Red Creek. There are patches of recovering native red spruce forest plus twisted yellow birch, sugar and red maple, eastern hemlock, and black cherry. American beech, pine and hickory can also be found. The wild onion known as the ramp (&quot;Allium tricoccum&quot;) is also present in the deeper forests.

===Fauna===

The larger megafauna which once inhabited the High Alleghenies—elk, bison, mountain lion—were all extirpated during the 19th century. They survived longer in this area, however, than in other parts of the eastern United States. Because of the high altitude the climate is cool, and some animals are more similar to ones found about farther north in Canada. Many species found here, such as the snowshoe hare, are near their southernmost range.

Beaver, which were restored to the state after a period of extirpation, continually create and refurbish their beaver ponds in these high elevation watersheds. Other animals that may be encountered include red and gray foxes, bobcats, black bears, groundhog, timber rattlers, wild turkey, and grouse. White-tailed deer were reintroduced in the 1930s and are now abundant. Currently, the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources is considering an elk restoration program in Dolly Sods and other areas. The threatened Cheat Mountain salamander is also present.

==Recreation==

Camping is allowed in Dolly Sods, but visitors are cautioned to &quot;leave no trace&quot;. All off-road motorized vehicles and any cutting of live vegetation or camping near roads (aside from Red Creek Campground) are forbidden. Hunting and fishing within state law are permitted. Dolly Sods is particularly popular during mid-summer with people who go there to pick blueberries and huckleberries. From May through late June, extensive and spectacular displays of mountain laurel in flower may be viewed. Due to severe winter weather, FS Rt 75, flanking the eastern side of Dolly Sods, is typically closed to vehicles from January 1 to April 15.

There is an extensive network of hiking trails in the wilderness totalling . Some follow old logging railroad grades, and occasionally remnants of railroad ties and metal equipment are found. Because USGS and USFS maps of the trails have been inaccurate, a 2004 mapping site provides good maps based on GPS data. Trails include:

<text>The sailfin molly (&quot;Poecilia latipinna&quot;) is a livebearer fish typically found in both freshwater and brackish waterways along the East Coast of the United States, from North Carolina south to Florida, and around the Gulf of Mexico to Texas, and south to the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Given their preference for more brackish water conditions, mollies are often found within just a few yards or miles of the ocean, inhabiting coastal estuaries, lagoons, river deltas and swamps, as well as tidal areas (such as mangrove swamps) with a regular inflow of oceanic minerals and nutrients mixing with inland freshwater sources.

==Taxonomy==
The sailfin molly was originally described in 1821 as &quot;Mollienesia latipinna&quot; by the naturalist Charles Alexandre Lesueur, who based his description upon specimens from freshwater ponds in the vicinity of New Orleans, Louisiana. However, Lesueur described other collections of the sailfin molly as &quot;Mollienesia multilineata&quot; in 1821, the same year in which he described &quot;M. latipinna&quot;. This conflict created confusion and eventually necessitated a ruling by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). In 1959, the ICZN placed precedence on the name &quot;Mollienesia latipinna&quot; Lesueur 1821. In a landmark definitive work on poeciliid fishes, Donn Rosen and Reeve Bailey (1959) noted the priority of &quot;Poecilia&quot; by Marcus Elieser Bloch and Johann Gottlob Schneider (1801) with regards to &quot;Mollienesia&quot; by Lesueur (1821), thereby relegating &quot;Mollienesia&quot; to the synonymy of &quot;Poecilia&quot;.

==Names==
Some names for the sailfin molly in other languages include &quot;Breitflossenkärpfling&quot; (German), &quot;seilfinnemolly&quot; (Norwegian), &quot;zeilvinkarper&quot; (Dutch), &quot;leveäevämolli&quot; (Finnish), &quot;molinezja szerokopłetwa&quot; (Polish), &quot;bubuntis&quot; (Tagalog), and &quot;molliénésie á voilure&quot; or simply &quot;molly voile&quot; (French).

Some confusion occurs with the Yucatan molly, &quot;P. velifera&quot;. While most names that contain a element refer to the present species, the German &quot;Segelkärpfling&quot;, the Latin &quot;velifera&quot;, and possibly others are used for the Yucatan molly. The French terms are used for both species indiscriminately. 

The sailfin molly is also commonly sold in aquarium stores under the name &quot;molly&quot;.

==Geographical distribution==
The sailfin molly is found in freshwater and brackish habitats from North Carolina to Texas and the Yucatán Peninsula of Mexico. Preferring coastal marshes fed by lowland streams, as well as mangrove swamps, deltas and estuaries, the sailfin molly is very common in peninsular Florida and around the entire Gulf of Mexico. Invasive and introduced populations have been established in New Zealand, in the western U.S., and Hawaii. Sailfin mollies introduced to California have caused a decline in populations of the federally protected and endangered desert pupfish (&quot;Cyprinodon macularius&quot;). It is also invasive to Iraq, where it thrives in the Persian Gulf waters at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates river deltas, threatening to outcompete many killifish species endemic to the region. Interestingly, the sailfin molly was introduced in the 1920s to Banff Hot Spring, in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.

==Habitat==
Sailfin mollies are most commonly observed at the shallow surface waters along the edges of marshes, lowland streams, ponds, swamps, estuaries and even ephemeral water bodies such as roadside ditches. Small to large aggregations of the species are most commonly found under floating vegetation or near structures in the water, minimizing their chances of being observed by potential predators.

The sailfin molly is a tolerant species, as it can exploit the thin film of oxygen-rich surface water with its upturned mouth, so is able to survive oxygen-depleted habitats. A euryhaline species, the sailfin molly may be found in a variety of saline environments, tolerating salinities as high as 87 ppt and breeding in brackish waters.

==Biology==

===Distinctive features===
The body of the sailfin molly is essentially oblong. The head is small and dorsally flattened, with a small, upturned mouth. The caudal peduncle is broad and the caudal fin is large, rounded, and sometimes tipped with black. The pelvic fins originate at a point anterior to the dorsal fin. In mature males, the dorsal fin is greatly enlarged (it is this feature that gives the species its common name) and the caudal fin is similarly colourful; these conspicuous secondary sexual features play a role in female mate choices. Females tend to be larger and more plainly colored, a different characteristic to the Poeciliidae. (See: Sexual selection)

It is a smaller fish than the Yucatan molly (&quot;P. velifera&quot;), though that species often does not grow to full length if bred in an aquarium. The dorsal fins are the most distinctive character: Those of the sailfin molly have less than 15 fin rays, counting where the fin meets the back, whereas the Yucatan molly has 18–19 (intermediate numbers may indicate hybrids). If a male spreads his dorsal fins in a display, in this species it forms a trapezoid, with the posterior edge being shortest. The height of the dorsal fin, measured at the posterior edge, is a bit less than the height of the tail. The male molly is more aggressive than the females.

===Coloration===
The body is generally light grey, although breeding males may be greenish-blue. Several rows of spots occur along the sides, back, and dorsal fin. Often, these spots blend together, forming stripes. Aquarists have developed many color variations in this species (variation occurs naturally in the wild), with melanistic, leucistic, albino, and speckled forms known.

====Sailfin and black mollies====

An entirely melanistic form exists called the midnight molly, or nondescriptly, &quot;black molly&quot;. The latter originally refers to melanistic breeds of &quot;Poecilia sphenops&quot;. Midnight mollies actually originated from hybrids between that and the present species.

As hybridization, like in most &quot;Poecilia&quot;, is easy between these two species and due to the more spectacular appearance of &quot;P. latipinna&quot;, such sailfin-black molly hybrids, with males&#x27; conspicuous, large, yellow-rimmed dorsal fins, are often seen.
Due to genomic recombination, F1 hybrids often display novel and bizarre fin shapes. Otherwise, hybrids can be bred among themselves, or with a higher rate of success with their parent species. They often have a somewhat decreased lifespan, but not as much (in healthy fish) as the deformed &quot;balloon&quot; molly breeds of &quot;P. sphenops.&quot;

===Size, age, and growth===
The natural lifespan of sailfin mollies is short, particularly in the case of the males, which may live less than a year after achieving sexual maturity. Depending upon environmental conditions, sailfin mollies may become reproductive in less than a year. Sailfin mollies are small fish. At one year of age, males typically range in size from SL, while mature females are likely to be inch SL. The size of adult males is directly correlated with population density. The greater the population, the smaller the average size of males. The maximum recorded size for this species is TL.

===Diet===
Sailfin mollies feed primarily upon algae and other plant materials, although they will consume a number of aquatic invertebrates, including the larvae of mosquitoes.

===Reproduction===
Fertilization is internal, and is accomplished by means of highly modified fin elements within the anal fin of males that form a structure known as the gonopodium. Sailfin mollies produce broods of 10–140 live young, depending on maturity and size, and females may store sperm long after the demise of their relatively short-lived mates. The gestation period for this species is about three to four weeks, depending upon temperature, and a single female may give birth on multiple occasions throughout the year. Although sex ratios of the broods are balanced, adult populations tend to be largely female, as males appear to suffer higher rates of mortality due to a greater susceptibility to predators and disease as a consequence of their brighter colours and a life devoted to frenzied breeding. No parental care is exhibited by this species.

==Predators==
Sailfin mollies are members of the lower end of the food chain. As such, they are prey for various animals, including aquatic insects, other fishes, reptiles, amphibians, birds and mammals. Specific examples include: giant water bugs (Belostomatidae), largemouth bass (&quot;Micropterus salmoides&quot;), American alligator (&quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot;), bullfrog (&quot;Rana catesbeiana&quot;), snowy egret (&quot;Egretta thula&quot;), and raccoon (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;).

==Parasites==
The trematode &quot;Saccocoelioides sogandaresi&quot; is a known parasite of the sailfin molly, as is the ciliated protozoan &quot;Ichthyophthirius multifiliis&quot;, which causes the disease commonly known as freshwater white spot, freshwater ich, or freshwater ick.

==Importance to humans==
The sailfin molly, in its many color varieties, is of considerable interest and value to aquarists, and many artificially selected varieties are produced and sold in pet shops. Wild sailfin mollies are also bred as feeder fish for larger carnivorous fish, though usually guppies are used for that. Naturally occurring populations control mosquito populations by feeding on the larvae and pupae of these pests.

==Conservation==
This species is listed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

<doc id="932578" wikidata="Q660004" url="?curid=932578" title="Russo-Turkish War (1672–1681)">
<text>The Russo-Turkish War of 1672–1681, a war between the Tsardom of Russia and Ottoman Empire, caused by Turkish expansionism in the second half of the 17th century.
Is the largest and one of the most important series of military campaigns before the Great Turkish War.

==Prelude==
After having captured and devastated the region of Podolia in the course of the Polish–Turkish War of 1672–1676, the Ottoman government strove to spread its rule over all of Right-bank Ukraine with the support of its vassal (since 1669), Hetman Petro Doroshenko. The latter&#x27;s pro-Turkish policy caused discontent among many Ukrainian Cossacks, which would lead to the election of Ivan Samoilovich (hetman of the Left-bank Ukraine) as the sole hetman of all Ukraine in 1674.

Despite this, Doroshenko continued to keep Chyhyryn, an important Cossack town near the Dnieper river. He cleverly maneuvered between Moscow and Warsaw and used the support of the Turkish-Tatar army. Finally, the Russian and Ukrainian forces under the command of Samoilovich and Grigory Romodanovsky besieged Chyhyryn and forced Doroshenko to surrender in 1676. Leaving a garrison in Chyhyryn, the Russian and Ukrainian armies retreated to the left bank of the Dnieper.

The supply of Ottoman forces operating in Moldavia and Wallachia was a major challenge that required well organized logistics. An army of 60,000 soldiers and 40,000 horses required a half-million kilograms of food per day. The Ottoman forces fared better than the Russians, but the expenses crippled both national treasuries. Supplies on both sides came using fixed prices, taxes, and confiscation.

==1677 Campaign==
The Ottoman Sultan Mehmed IV appointed Yuri Khmelnitsky, who had been the sultan&#x27;s prisoner at that time, hetman of Right-bank Ukraine. In July 1677, the sultan ordered his army (45,000 men) under the command of Ibrahim Pasha to advance towards Chyhyryn. On 30 July 1677, advanced detachments appeared at the fortress, and on August 3 – the main Turkish forces. Samoilovich and Grigory Romodanovsky&#x27;s army joined on August 10, and only on August 24 did they cross the Sula river on the way to Chyhyryn. On August 26–27, a skirmish between their and Ottoman troops removed Ottoman observation posts and allowed the rest of the Russian and Ukrainian forces to cross the river under the cover of artillery fire. Turkish attempts to drop back into the river at the first crossing detachment under the command of Major-General Shepelev were repulsed. Russian and Ukrainian cavalry attacked and overwhelmed the Turkish-Tatar army camp on August 28, inflicting heavy casualties. The following day, Ibrahim Pasha lifted the siege of Chyhyryn and hastily retreated to the Inhul river and beyond. Samoilovich and Grigory Romodanovsky relieved Chyhyryn on September 5. The Ottoman Army had lost 20,000 men and Ibrahim was imprisoned upon his return to Constantinople and Crimean Khan Selim I Giray lost his throne.

==1678 Campaign==
In July 1678, the Turkish army (approx. 70,000 men) of the Grand Vizier Kara Mustafa with the Crimean Tatar army (up to 50,000 men) besieged Chyhyryn once again. The Russian and Ukrainian armies (70,000–80,000) broke through the fortified position of the Turkish covering force and turned them to flight. Then they entrenched on the left bank of the Tiasmyn river opposite the fortress with the Turkish-Crimean army on the other bank. The crossings were destroyed and it was difficult to attack the Turks. The troops could freely enter Chyhyryn, but it was already surrounded by well-equipped siege positions and was heavily bombarded; its fortifications were badly damaged. When the Turks broke into the Lower Town of Chyhyryn on August 11, Romodanovsky ordered to leave the citadel and withdraw troops to the left bank. The Russian army retreated beyond the Dnieper, beating off the pursuing Turkish army, which would finally leave them in peace. Later the Turks seized Kanev and established the power of Yuri Khmelnitsky on Right-bank Ukraine, but did not go to Kiev, where the Russian troops were stationed. During the campaign 12,000–20,000 Turkish-Tatar troops were killed, while around 6,500 Cossack-Russian troops were killed or went missing during the campaign. According to other estimates, Ottomans lost over 30,000 troops.

In 1679–1680, the Russians repelled the attacks of the Crimean Tatars and signed the Bakhchisaray Peace Treaty on 3 January 1681, which would establish the Russo-Turkish border by the Dnieper.

==Result of the war==
The result of the war, which was ended by the Treaty of Bakhchisarai, is disputed. Some historians mention it was an Ottoman victory, while another historian contends that it was a Russian victory. While some historians state the war was indecisive (stalemate).

<doc id="932581" wikidata="Q473943" url="?curid=932581" title="Amon G. Carter Stadium">
<text>Amon G. Carter Stadium is an open-air football stadium on the campus of Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas. It is the home stadium of the TCU Horned Frogs football team. It is named after Amon G. Carter, a prominent Fort Worth businessman, newspaper publisher, and city booster. Amon G. Carter stadium has several popular nicknames, the most popular being &quot;The Carter&quot; and &quot;Hell&#x27;s Half Acre&quot; (a reference to the site in Fort Worth&#x27;s Wild West past, which was located near the stadium).

Between 2010 and 2012, the stadium underwent a $164 million reconstruction project. In 2019, the stadium underwent an additional $118 million east-side expansion.

==History==

===Planning and construction===

In 1923, TCU received a private donation from Mary Couts Burnett, the widow of a wealthy and well known Texas rancher. The Burnett donation constituted the egg for TCU&#x27;s endowment. One condition of the Burnett donation was that a portion of it would be used for the construction of a new library, and it was decided to build the Mary Couts Burnett Library where the school&#x27;s athletic field, Clark Field, was then located.

The removal of Clark Field necessitated the construction of a new field for athletic competition, especially in the sport of football. TCU played its first season of football in 1896, and since then had built a reputation of excellence garnering national attention, and joined the Southwest Conference in 1923.

In 1928, the school received a private financial donation from Amon G. Carter, publisher of the &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; and a fervent civic booster of Fort Worth in general. Carter asked Andrew Poyar, one of the designers of Shields-Watkins Field (now Neyland Stadium) at the University of Tennessee, to create the blueprints for the structure.

Amon Carter stadium was constructed from 1929 to 1930 with an original seating capacity of 22,000. The stadium hosted its first football game on October 11, 1930, when TCU defeated the University of Arkansas.
In the 1930s under head coach Dutch Meyer, the Horned Frogs won national championships in 1935 and 1938.

===Expansion===

The first expansion of the stadium took place in 1948, with construction raising the capacity by 8,500 to a total of 30,500. In 1951 and 1953, 2,500 and 4,000 more seats were added which raised capacity to 37,000 seats. An upper deck, topped by a two-story press box and highlighted with a large stylized &quot;TCU&quot;, was added in 1956. This brought the stadium&#x27;s capacity to 46,083.

In 1985 and 1991, improvements were made to the seating. This involved replacing the old seats in the lower bowl with aluminum bleachers. The upper-deck seats were later replaced in the same way. This reduced the stadium capacity to 44,008 spectators.

In 1992, the artificial turf, which had been in place since 1973, was replaced with natural grass. In 2002, the David E. Bloxom, Sr. Foundation helped install a new scoreboard and videoboard.

New club seats and luxury suites were added prior to the 2008 season, increasing capacity to 44,358, and again in 2020.

===Renovation/Reconstruction===

In August 2010, TCU announced a $105 million renovation of the west side and north end zone of Amon G. Carter Stadium to better enhance football fans&#x27; experience, upgrade amenities, and transform the historic Fort Worth icon into the &quot;Camden Yards&quot; of collegiate football stadiums.

The planned renovation quickly expanded into a rebuild of the entire stadium above ground level, and partially below. Only the below-ground-level playing field and lower seating bowl were retained. Everything else, including much of the subterranean infrastructure, was rebuilt. The West-side stands were imploded on December 5, 2010, and the East-side stands were demolished during the early winter 2011. The stadium reconstruction was funded completely by donor support (no bonds or debt). The project was fully completed in 2012 at a total cost of $164 million.

In 2019 the stadium underwent an additional $118 million East side expansion.

==Features==

===Attendance===
The highest ever recorded attendance at Amon G. Carter was 53,294, which occurred in the 2023 season opener against Colorado.

The 2012 home season was the first time an entire season was sold out at Amon G. Carter Stadium.

===Largest Crowds===
===Playing surface===
Since 2003, the stadium&#x27;s playing surface has been named W.A. &quot;Monty &amp; Tex&quot; Moncrief Field, usually shortened to Moncrief Field, after W. A. &quot;Tex&quot; Moncrief Jr. and his father W. A. &quot;Monty&quot; Moncrief Sr. The naming came following a $3 million donation by Tex to the football program.

==Usage==

===Armed Forces Bowl===
The Armed Forces Bowl, previously the Fort Worth Bowl, has been played annually at Amon Carter Stadium since 2003. The bowl game was temporarily moved, however, to SMU&#x27;s Gerald Ford Stadium in Dallas for the 2010 and 2011 bowl seasons due to the reconstruction.

An earlier bowl game, the Fort Worth Classic, was played in Fort Worth at the predecessor to Amon Carter Stadium in 1921.

===TCU Horned Frogs===
Located on the TCU campus, Amon Carter Stadium is the home field of the TCU Horned Frogs football team and marching band.

===COVID-19 Vaccinations===
In February 2021, the parking lots of the stadium were used to stage a drive-through COVID-19 vaccination site. The operation is a collaboration between TCU, Baylor Scott &amp; White Health and Tarrant County Public Health, with doses being administered in part by faculty and students from both the TCU/UNT Health Science Center and TCU&#x27;s Harris College of Nursing. Over the course of twelve weeks, more than 19,000 vaccine doses were administered at the site.

<text>Louis Pierre Mouillard (September 30, 1834 – September 20, 1897) was a French artist and innovator who worked on human mechanical flight in the second half of the 19th century. He based much of his work on the investigation of birds in Algeria and Cairo. Around the early 1900s he was considered the &quot;father of aviation&quot;.

Mouillard&#x27;s most famous work, &quot;L&#x27;Empire de l&#x27;Air&quot;, in which he proposed fixed-wing gliders, was published in France in 1881 and soon became a widely recognized classic. It was translated into English by the Smithsonian Institution in their annual report of 1892 and reprinted in 1893 as &quot;The Empire Of The Air&quot;.

==Biography==
Mouillard studied at the School of Fine Arts at Lyon and Paris but settled in Algeria at Mitidja after the death of his father. Here he constructed several gliders before returning to France in 1865. Around this time he managed to glide 138 feet at about 30 feet height. He also described the use of a screw to provide lift and propulsion to a glider in 1890. He was appointed a professor of drawing at the Cairo Polytechnic in 1866 during which time he took a lot of interest in the flight of vultures. He studied the requirements of gliding flight in birds. In 1897 his design was patented in the United States of America by Octave Chanute. His biographer Arthur Henry Couannier posthumously published a book on gliding flight in 1912 titled &quot;Le vol sans battement&quot; (flight without flapping). He foresaw the use of aluminium as the metal of choice for aircraft and was possibly the first - with the possible exception of British engineer M.P.W. Boulton in 1868 - to introduce control surfaces to the wing.

Mouillard realized the importance of wings, gliding and the future of aviation at a time when balloons were considered the only practical way to carry humans and flapping machines had failed. He inspired the work of many others including Octave Chanute and Otto Lilienthal. Mouillard was described by Wilbur Wright as one of the greatest missionaries of the flying cause. Mouillard believed that flight would unify the world, that the empire of the air would be for all humanity to own and that it would eliminate the need for boundaries and armies. He has been termed as a utopian:

Mouillard died, largely unrecognized and in poverty, at Cairo in 1897. In February 1912 a statue was erected in Cairo to his memory. The statue was made by Guillaume Laplagne and was erected on a black basalt base and was located near the Heliopolis Grand Hotel but this no longer exists. The base of the pedestal bears the word &quot;Oser!&quot; meaning &quot;dare&quot; which he had printed on the cover of his book. The vulture in front of the pedestal is based on his illustration used in his 1881 book. Rue Pierre-Mouillard is a Paris street named in his honour.

<doc id="932619" wikidata="Q2332494" url="?curid=932619" title="30th Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 30th Infantry Division was a United States Army unit of the National Guard that served in World War I and World War II. It was nicknamed the &quot;Old Hickory&quot; division, in honor of President Andrew Jackson. The Germans nicknamed this division &quot;Roosevelt&#x27;s SS&quot;. The 30th Infantry Division, involved in 282 days of intense combat over a period from June 1944 through April 1945, was regarded by a team of historians led by S.L.A. Marshall as the American infantry division that had &quot;performed the most efficient and consistent battle services&quot; in the European Theater of Operations (ETO). In the present day, the division&#x27;s lineage continues as 30th Armored Brigade Combat Team, part of the North Carolina National Guard. The unit&#x27;s most recent combat deployment was in 2019.

== World War I ==
The division was originally activated as the 9th Division (drawing units from the National Guard of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee) under a 1917 force plan, but changed designation to the 30th Division after the American entry into World War I in April 1917. From August 28, 1917 to May 1. 1918, the 30th Division trained at Camp Sevier in Taylors, South Carolina. It was formally activated under its new title in October 1917.

In May 1918, the division was sent to Europe and arrived in England, where it departed for the Western Front soon after. The division, along with the 27th Division, was assigned to the U.S. II Corps but did not serve with the main American Expeditionary Force (AEF) and was instead attached to the Second Army of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), trading American equipment for British equipment.

The major operations the 30th Division took part in were the Ypres-Lys, and the Somme offensive, in which it was one of the two American divisions assigned to the Fourth British Army that broke the Hindenburg Line on September 29, 1918. The Thirtieth Division broke through on its entire front, taking Bellicourt and part of Nauroy by noon of the 29th. The Australian 5th Division, coming up at this time, continued the attack with elements of the 30th division. The division had, in three months, from July until October 1918, sustained 1,237 officers and men killed in action (KIA), with a further 7,178 wounded in action (WIA) or missing in action (MIA).

== Interwar period ==

The 30th Division headquarters arrived at the port of Charleston, South Carolina, aboard the USS Madawaska on 2 April 1919 after 11 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 7 May 1919 at Camp Jackson, South Carolina. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the states of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee, and assigned to the IV Corps. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized 24 August 1926 at 121 Capitol Square, Atlanta, Georgia. The division headquarters was relocated on 20 September 1932 to Macon, Georgia. The designated mobilization training center for the “Old Hickory” Division was Camp Jackson, where much of the division&#x27;s training activities occurred between the wars. For most years, the division&#x27;s subordinate units held separate summer camps at locations usually within their respective states: Tybee Island or St. Simons Island for Georgia units; Camp Glenn near Morehead City for North Carolina units; Camp Jackson for South Carolina units; Camp Peay near Tullahoma or Camp John Sevier near Greenville, South Carolina for Tennessee units. The division staff, composed of personnel from all four states, came together to conduct joint training for several summers before World War II. The division staff usually assembled at Camp Jackson most summers, but conducted their training at Tybee Island for at least one camp. The division also participated in several corps area and army-level command post exercises.

The first opportunity that the division&#x27;s units had to operate together came in 1928 when the entire “Old Hickory” Division was assembled at Camp Jackson from 8–22 July under a War Department experimental program designed to bring together multistate National Guard divisions for joint training. The experiment was declared a success, but due to budget constraints, the program was never fully implemented. The division was assembled again for the 1932 camp, but units were staggered over a 6-week period, so no large-scale training was conducted. The next opportunity came in August 1938 when the division was assembled at the DeSoto National Forest in Mississippi for the Fourth Corps Area concentration of the Third Army maneuvers. In that maneuver, the “Old Hickory” Division operated as part of the provisional IV Corps. The division&#x27;s final training event before induction came in August 1940 when the 30th Division participated in the Third Army maneuvers in the Kisatchie National Forest near Alexandria, Louisiana. For that maneuver, the division again operated as part of the IV Corps against the provisional VIII Corps. The division was inducted into active federal service at home stations on 16 September 1940, assigned to the IV Corps, and ordered to move to Camp Jackson, where it arrived about 20 September 1940. After the division&#x27;s initial train-up period, it participated in the VII Corps Tennessee Maneuvers in May–June 1941, and in the Carolina Maneuvers as part of the I Corps near Cheraw-Chesterfield, South Carolina, in November 1941 At this time, the 121st Infantry Regiment was relieved from the division and reassigned to the 8th Infantry Division. In late 1941, the division lost approximately 6,000 men when one-year enlistments in the Army of the United States expired and other men were released from active duty for hardship to their dependents as stipulated by Congress.

== World War II ==

=== Early years ===
In the spring of 1942, the division was reorganized from a four-regiment &quot;square&quot; organization into a three-regiment &quot;triangular&quot; organization. During the summer of 1942, the division was then used as a source of personnel for new units. Volunteers for United States Army Air Forces training and officer candidate school quotas also contributed to the division&#x27;s decline from 12,400 officers and men in June to only 3,000 in August. In the fall of 1942, the 119th Infantry Regiment and 197th Field Artillery Battalion were activated and assigned to the division to replace the 118th Infantry Regiment and 115th Field Artillery Battalion, which had been sent as a task force to England. The 30th Infantry Division, &quot;having lost within a year the equivalent of a full division in both officers and men&quot; was then moved to Camp Blanding, Florida, to restart training in December, with &quot;two-thirds of its enlisted personnel fresh from the reception center.&quot; It stayed at Blanding from October 1942 to May 1943, then moved to Camp Forrest, Tennessee in May 1943, and finally Camp Atterbury, Indiana, from 10 November 1943 to 26 January 1944.

=== Combat chronicle ===
After training in the United States for just over two years, the 30th Infantry Division, under the command of Major General Leland Hobbs, arrived in England, 22 February 1944, and trained for the Allied invasion of Normandy until June.

It landed at Omaha Beach, Normandy, on 11 June 1944, five days after the initial D-Day landings of 6 June 1944, secured the Vire-et-Taute Canal, crossed the Vire River on 7 July. Beginning on 25 July, the 30th Division spearheaded the Saint-Lô break-through of Operation Cobra, which was intended to break out of the Normandy beachhead, thus ending the stalemate that had occurred.

During the operation, on both 24 and 25 July, the 30th Division encountered a devastating friendly fire incident. As part of the effort to break out of the Normandy hedgerows, US Army Air Forces (USAAF) bombers from England were sent to carpet bomb a one-by-three-mile corridor of the German defenses opposite the American line. However, USAAF planners, in complete disregard or lack of understanding of their role in supporting the ground attack, loaded the heavy B-24 Liberator and B-17 Flying Fortress bombers with 500-pound bombs, destroying roads and bridges and complicating movement through the corridor, instead of lighter 100-pound bombs intended as antipersonnel devices against German defenders. Air planners switched the approach of attack by 90 degrees without informing ground commanders, thus a landmark road to guide the bombers to the bombing zone was miscommunicated as the point to begin the bombing run. Start point confusion was further compounded by red smoke signals that suddenly blew in the wrong direction, and bombs began falling on the heads of the American soldiers. There were over 100 friendly fire casualties over the two days, including Lieutenant General Lesley J. McNair, commander of Army Ground Forces under Malisau.

The division relieved the veteran 1st Infantry Division near Mortain on 6 August. The German drive to Avranches began shortly after. The 30th Division clashed with the elite 1st SS Panzer Division, and fierce fighting in place with all available personnel broke out. The division frustrated enemy plans and broke the spearhead of the enemy assault in a violent struggle from 7–12 August. After the liberation of Paris, the division drove east through Belgium, crossing the Meuse River at Visé and Liège on 10 September. Elements of the division entered the Netherlands on 12 September, and Maastricht fell the next day. Moving into Germany and taking up positions along the Wurm River, the 30th Division launched its attack on the heavily defended city of Aachen on 2 October 1944, and succeeded in contacting the 1st Division on 16 October, resulting in the encirclement and takeover of Aachen.

After a rest period, the 30th Division eliminated an enemy salient northeast of Aachen on 16 November, pushed through Alsdorf to the Inde River on 28 November, and then moved to rest areas. On 17 December the division rushed south to the Malmedy-Stavelot area to help block the powerful enemy drive in the Battle of the Bulge—the Germans&#x27;s last attempt to win a decisive victory over the Western Allies. Again the division met the 1st SS Division, and again broke the spearhead of their assault. The 30th Division launched a counterattack on 13 January 1945 and reached a point 2 miles south of St. Vith, Belgium on 26 January, before leaving the battle and moving to an assembly area near Lierneux on 27 January, and to another near Aachen to prepare for attack deeper into the western edge of Germany at the Roer River. The Roer was crossed on 23 February 1945, near Jülich.

The 30th moved back for training and rehabilitation on 3 March, and on 24 March made its assault crossing of the Rhine. It pursued the enemy across Germany, mopping up enemy pockets of resistance, took Hamelin on 7 April, Braunschweig on 12 April, and helped to reduce Magdeburg on 17 April. As the 30th was capturing Braunschweig, elements of the Division also liberated Weferlingen, a sub-camp of Buchenwald. Approximately 2,500 prisoners were freed through the efforts of the 30th. The Russians were contacted at Grunewald on the Elbe River. The end of World War II in Europe came soon afterwards and, after a short occupation period, the 30th Division began its return to the United States, arriving on 19 August 1945. The surrender of Japan followed soon, which brought the war to an end, and the division was subsequently inactivated on 25 November 1945 at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. By its disbandment, It had spent a cumulative 282 days in combat and had participated in the campaigns and battles of Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe.

== Postwar ==
Following the war, the 30th Division was once again reactivated as a National Guard formation in 1947, split between three states. It included the 119th, 120th, and 121st Infantry Regiments.
In 1954, the division became an entirely North Carolina Army National Guard manned formation, as Tennessee&#x27;s portion became the 30th Armored Division, which was maintained with the Alabama Army National Guard. In 1968 the division was designated as the 30th Infantry Division (Mechanized). On 4 January 1974 the division was again inactivated, and the brigade in North Carolina become the 30th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) (Separate). The 2nd Brigade, 30th Infantry Division, became the 218th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) (Separate).

<text>A non-conforming loan is a loan that fails to meet bank criteria for funding.

Reasons include the loan amount is higher than the conforming loan limit (for mortgage loans), lack of sufficient credit, the unorthodox nature of the use of funds, or the collateral backing it. In many cases, non-conforming loans can be funded by hard money lenders, or private institutions/money. A large portion of real-estate loans are qualified as non-conforming because either the borrower&#x27;s financial status or the property type does not meet bank guidelines. Non-conforming loans can be either Alt-A or subprime loans.

The flexibility of private money can allow for a much broader range of deals to be funded, although a lender may require more detailed and substantive collateral and documentation.

== Selecting a non-conforming lender ==
Borrowers should select non-conforming lenders in the same careful way they would shop for any other loan. Look for good rates and especially a good customer service rating. Rates for non-conforming lenders are typically higher than those for banks, but terms are more flexible and loans more easily attainable. Many companies advertising non-conforming loans are brokers who refer the loans requests they field to lenders.

==Types of non-conforming loans ==
Commercial non-conforming loans are also known as hard money loans, and comprise a large portion of all non-conforming loans. They are used to fund industrial and retail projects like RV parks, theatre complexes, gas stations, medical centers and more. Many commercial non-conforming loans are bridge loans.

Residential non-conforming loans are strictly regulated, usually with much higher rates than banks. Some states have legal limits against non-conforming loans for residential real estate.

==See also==
*Asset-based loan: A similar type of commercial loan based on real estate, indicating the loan will be based upon a percentage of the property&#x27;s appraised value, as the key criteria

<text>The Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700 was part of the joint European effort to confront the Ottoman Empire. The larger European conflict was known as the Great Turkish War.

The Russo-Turkish War began after the Tsardom of Russia joined the European anti-Turkish coalition (Habsburg monarchy, Poland–Lithuania, Venice) in 1686, after Poland-Lithuania agreed to recognize Russian incorporation of Kiev and the left bank of Ukraine.

==War==
During the war, the Russian army organized the Crimean campaigns of 1687 and 1689 both which ended in Russian defeats. Despite these setbacks, Russia launched the Azov campaigns in 1695 and 1696, and after raising the siege in 1695 successfully occupied Azov in 1696.

==Peace treaty==
In light of preparations for the war against the Swedish Empire, Russian Tsar Peter the Great signed the Treaty of Karlowitz with the Ottoman Empire in 1699. The subsequent Treaty of Constantinople in 1700, ceded Azov, the Taganrog fortress, Pavlovsk and Mius to Russia, freed Russia from tribute payments and established a Russian ambassador in Constantinople, and secured the return of all prisoners of war. The Tsar also affirmed that his subordinates, the Cossacks, would not attack the Ottomans, while the Sultan affirmed his subordinates, the Crimean Tatars, would not attack the Russians.
Russia benefited from the peace treaty, but it did not correspond to the original plans, because until the summer of 1695 Peter the Great strongly hoped to take the Crimea, however the diplomatic collapse of the holy League prevented this and the Russians limited themselves to the Azov region, which partially satisfied their demands.

<text>A mechitza (, partition or division, pl.: , ) in Judaism is a partition, particularly one that is used to separate men and women.

The rationale in halakha (Jewish law) for a partition dividing men and women is derived from the Babylonian Talmud. A divider in the form of a balcony was established in the Temple in Jerusalem for the Simchat Beit HaShoeivah ceremony, a time of great celebration and festivity. The divider was first established to preserve modesty and attention during this time.

During the mid-20th century, a substantial number of Orthodox synagogues did not have mechitzot. However, the Orthodox Union (OU), the main body of Modern Orthodox synagogues in the United States, adopted a policy of not accepting as new members synagogues without mechitzot, and strongly encouraged existing synagogues to adopt them. Men and women are generally not separated in most Conservative synagogues, but it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism; some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have separate seating for men and women, with or without a physical partition. Reform congregations, consistent with the movement&#x27;s core value of gender equality, do not use mechitzot in their synagogues.

==Origin==
===Talmudic era===
Although the synagogue mechitza is not mentioned anywhere in Talmudic literature, there is a discussion of a barrier between men and women, used at the Sukkot festivities in the Jerusalem Temple. The Amoraic sage Rav explains that the divider originated with a statement of the prophet Zechariah regarding the mourning following the war between Gog and Magog:

Rav explained that if such a sad occasion necessitates a separation between men and women, then the Simchat Beit HaShoeivah in the Temple in Jerusalem (a very happy occasion) does as well.

Scholars have long debated the extent to which gender segregation and a mechitza between the sexes existed in synagogues during the periods of the Second Temple, the Mishnah, and the Talmud. Shmuel Safrai, through a combination of textual analysis and archaeological evidence, has argued that while women consistently attended synagogue services, there is no definitive evidence to support the existence of a partition separating the genders or the existence of a separate women&#x27;s aid (Ezrat Nashim). The archaeologist Lee Levine notes that there is no evidence in the dedicatory inscriptions found in archaeological excavations regarding the existence of mechitzas, and furthermore, no structure has been found that can be interpreted as a mechitza.

===Medieval period===
Meir of Rothenburg (13th century, Germany) is reported to have had a separate women&#x27;s section in his synagogue.

Shlomo ibn Aderet (13th century, Spain) mentions a women&#x27;s section in synagogue.

The Yu Aw Synagogue in Afghanistan, built in 1393, has a separate women&#x27;s gallery.

==Separate seating in synagogue==
A mechitza most commonly means the physical divider placed between the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sections in Orthodox synagogues and at religious celebrations. The idea behind this is twofold. First, mingling of the sexes is generally frowned upon, as this leads to frivolity, which itself may lead to promiscuity. Secondly, even if the sexes are separated, they should not be able to interact to a high degree during a religious service, lest this leads to gazing and impure thoughts. Due to these restrictions, mechitzot are usually opaque (at least looking from the men&#x27;s side to the women&#x27;s side).

In some synagogues, the mechitza divided the front and back of the synagogue. In others it divides the left and right sides of the synagogue. The latter is often seen as more equal, since the women are not farther away from the service than the men.

The women&#x27;s section of the synagogue is called the &quot;Ezrat Nashim&quot; (, women&#x27;s courtyard) after a similar area in the Temple in Jerusalem. In Ashkenazic European synagogues, the women&#x27;s section or annex was called the &quot;weibershul&quot;. Historically, the &quot;weibershul&quot; was led by a Firzogerin, a learned woman who would translate the Hebrew liturgy of the main service led by the chazzan into the vernacular. 

Orthodox Judaism is divided on whether a synagogue mechitza represents binding law or a custom. During the middle portion of the 20th century, there were a substantial number of synagogues which considered themselves Orthodox but did not have one. The influential Haredi Posek (decisor) Moshe Feinstein held that a mechitza is required as a matter of Biblical law, holding that the statement in Zechariah 12:12-14 represents not a prophecy about future circumstances but binding Sinaitic law, Halacha LeMoshe MiSinai, regarding present circumstances. He declared that Orthodox Jews are prohibited from praying in a synagogue without one. Rabbi Joseph Soloveitchik held that a separation of men and women is Biblically required, while the physical mechitza was required by Rabbinic decree. These views have gained adherence over the later portion of the 20th century.

The Orthodox Union (OU), the main body of Modern Orthodox synagogues in the United States, adopted a policy of not accepting synagogues without mechitzot as new members, and strongly encouraging existing synagogues to adopt them. In 2002, Rabbi Avi Weiss of Yeshivat Chovevei Torah, stated that &quot;As an Orthodox institution, Yeshivat Chovevei Torah requires its students to daven in synagogues with mechitzot.&quot; The &quot;Jewish Ledger&quot; reported that as of 2005, &quot;Beth Midrash Hagadol-Beth Joseph remains the only synagogue in the country affiliated with the Orthodox Union (OU) to have so-called &#x27;mixed seating. However, in 2015 this synagogue decided to leave the OU, after learning that the OU was planning to expel it from OU membership. Mixed-seating Orthodox synagogues (Conservadox), which were a prevalent minority as late as a generation ago, have now all but disappeared. The partnership minyan movement, which seeks a greater synagogue role for women within an Orthodox context, requires a mechitza.

The Union for Traditional Judaism recently published a viewpoint arguing that a mechitza is not required to have a particular height by either Biblical law or rabbinic decree.

Men and women are generally not separated in most Conservative synagogues, although it is a permissible option within Conservative Judaism and some Conservative synagogues, particularly in Canada, have one or have separate seating for men and women without a physical partition. Conservative Judaism takes the position that the &quot;Mechitza&quot; referred to in Talmud Tractate Sukkah applied only to the festival of Sukkah in the Temple and that its use to separate men and women for synagogue worship and other occasions represents a custom rather than a requirement of core Jewish law, and is subject to contemporary Rabbinic re-examination. Some Conservative synagogues (e.g. in Europe and Israel) also have a meḥitza or separate seating sections for men and women without a physical partition. At one point the synagogue in the Jewish Theological Seminary did so.

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism, consistent with their view that traditional religious law is not mandatory in modern times and a more liberal interpretation of gender roles, do not use mechitzot in their synagogues. This development is historically connected with the United States; the original German Reform retained the women&#x27;s balcony, although the &quot;curtain or lattice-work&quot; was removed. (Even in Orthodoxy there is a dispute as to whether a balcony requires a curtain.)

It has been argued that abolition of the mechitza became a symbol of Reform Judaism and that, correspondingly, opposition to its abolition became a symbol of Orthodoxy.

===Height===

There are different views on the proper height of a mechitzah separating men and women in a synagogue. According to the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, a mechitza needs to prevent men from seeing a woman who might be immodestly dressed, and hence a mechitza needs to be as tall as a man, or 6 feet (180 centimetres). However, according to Orthodox Rabbi Ahron Soloveichik, a mechitzah need only serve as a halakhic partition, and hence need only be the minimum height for such a partition, i.e. 10 &quot;tefachim&quot; (about 32 inches or 80 centimetres). Rabbi Moshe Feinstein had an intermediate view, requiring a height of 18 tefachim (about 58 inches or 145 centimetres).

To accommodate stricter interpretations while simultaneously allowing women to see the male prayer leader, many synagogues will make an opaque wall that is 3–4 feet high and add a lattice, screen, one-way glass, or other semi-transparent material above that opaque wall. The design shown at right is an example: The etched glass is semi-transparent, while the opaque wall adheres to what the synagogue requires as the minimum height requirement. The Or Torah synagogue in Skokie, Illinois has a similar design.

===Designs===
There are different styles of mechitzot, depending on the number of women the synagogue expects to attend their prayer services, how dedicated the congregation is to accommodating women who wish to pray with the congregation, and whether the congregation believes that the purpose of the mechitza is to provide a social separation or to prevent the men from seeing the women.

Any of these options can be made so that they go across the length of the room so that men and women are side-by-side or so that they go across the width of the room so that women sit behind the men. Synagogues in which women sit next to the men are generally more concerned with women&#x27;s ability to join equally in prayer with the congregation.
;Balcony: Balconies with a three-foot wall are themselves traditionally considered fitting mechitzot. In this design, women sit in the balcony and men sit below. This design was common in the 19th and early 20th century, and is common in Europe, including the Shaarei Tikva synagogue in Lisbon (opened in 1904). Examples in the United States include the Bnei Israel Synagogue in Baltimore (opened 1845), B&#x27;nai Jacob in Ottumwa, Iowa (opened 1915), Temple Beth Shalom (the Tremont Street Shul) in Cambridge, Massachusetts (opened 1925 as Temple Ashkenaz), and the Beth Efraim Bukharian Jewish Synagogue in Forest Hills, New York (70th Avenue). Some of these American examples are modeled after specific European synagogues, others are best classified as vernacular architecture. A Canadian example is the Beth Jacob Synagogue in North York, Ontario.
; Balconies with curtains or one-way glass: More strict congregations add a curtain to the balcony so that men cannot see even women&#x27;s faces.
; Central partition: A fixed-height gate or planter running down the center of the room, so that women and men both face front side by side. Often these partitions are minimal height (). In addition to the partition, sometimes the women&#x27;s section is elevated by about a foot above the men&#x27;s section. Example of a lower partition with a raised floor is in Anshe Shalom Bnei Israel synagogue in Chicago and Young Israel of Ocean Parkway in Flatbush, Brooklyn. An example of a medium-high partition () without a raised floor is the Adas Israel in Hamilton, Ontario. An example of a higher partition with a raised floor is in Mount Sinai Jewish Center of Washington Heights in Manhattan.
; Booth: Synagogues that expect very few women to attend provide a token space that can accommodate about six women comfortably. The space is demarcated by moveable, opaque partitions that are over high. Examples are in the Yeshiva University beit midrash, and the Shabbat afternoon service at Young Israel of Avenue J in Flatbush, Brooklyn. In some synagogues, the booth is a supplement to the balcony, to accommodate women who have difficulty walking up the stairs (such as at She&#x27;erith Israel Congregation, Glen Avenue, Baltimore).
; Fixed-height opaque wall: Sometimes with a non-opaque curtain, screen, glass, or other material above the wall, which can include: blinds or a curtain that can be opened during announcements or a sermon, etched glass, stained glass, a one-way screen with lights so that women can see through without being seen (e.g. Beth Jacob Shaarei Zion and Suburban Orthodox in Baltimore).
: The mechitza at the Bostoner Rebbe&#x27;s synagogue in Brookline, Massachusetts, is made entirely of panels from the Boston John Hancock Tower (which had been removed from that building due to safety concerns). The Bostoner Rebbe chose these panels because they are one-way glass so the women can see out, but men cannot see into the women&#x27;s section. Later, the Rebbe&#x27;s wife put curtains inside the women&#x27;s section, so that women could not see into the men&#x27;s section.)
; Curtain: Usually tall or higher, made of opaque or semi-opaque material, held up by poles on stands or a clothesline. This option costs less than the above fixed options and is used frequently by synagogues that wish to use their prayer halls for mixed-sex functions in addition to separate sex prayer. College Hillel Orthodox minyans may choose this option because the rooms at Hillel are all used for multiple purposes besides prayer.
; Separate room: The strictest separation has women in a separate room from the men, able to view through one-way glass or an open window from a balcony, or not view at all. Examples of this are the yeshiva Ohr Someach in the neighborhood of Maalot Dafna in Jerusalem, where the men sit in a first floor room with a two-story ceiling, and the women are on the second floor with a window overlooking the men&#x27;s prayer hall. A similar design (men first floor, women second floor) is in 770 Eastern Parkway, the main synagogue for the Chabad Lubavitch movement in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Main Belzer Shul in Jerusalem.

==Uses unrelated to gender separation==
===Eruv===

In halakhic discourse, &quot;mechitza&quot; can also refer to the boundary walls of an eruv for carrying (to carry within a given area on the Sabbath the area must be entirely enclosed). There are many specific rules for what constitutes a valid mechitza, although the mechitza does not have to be solid. (For example, there are many instances where part of an eruv may be a string run across several poles, and this could constitute a valid mechitza).

===Sukkah===
The walls of a sukkah are also referred to as a &quot;mechitza&quot; in the Talmud. These walls must be at least ten tefachim (approximately ) high for the sukkah to be valid.

<text>The Russo-Ottoman War of 1710–1711, also known as the Pruth River Campaign, was a brief military conflict between the Tsardom of Russia and the Ottoman Empire. The main battle took place during 18–22 July 1711 in the basin of the Pruth river near Stănilești after Tsar Peter I entered the Ottoman vassal Principality of Moldavia, following the Ottoman Empire’s declaration of war on Russia. The ill-prepared Russians, Cossacks, and Moldavians found themselves surrounded by the Ottoman Army under Grand Vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha. After three days of fighting and heavy casualties the Tsar and his army were allowed to withdraw after agreeing to abandon the fortress of Azov and its surrounding territory. The Ottoman victory led to the Treaty of the Pruth which was confirmed by the Treaty of Adrianople.

==Background==
The Russo-Ottoman War of 1710–1711 broke out as a result of the Great Northern War, which pitted the Swedish Empire of King Charles XII of Sweden against the Tsardom of Russia of Tsar Peter I. Charles invaded Russian-ruled Ukraine in 1708, but suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Poltava in the summer of 1709. He and his retinue fled to the Ottoman fortress of Bender, in the Ottoman vassal principality of Moldavia. Ottoman Sultan Ahmed III declined incessant Russian demands for Charles&#x27;s eviction, prompting Tsar Peter I to attack the Ottoman Empire, which in its turn declared war on Russia on 20 November 1710. Concurrently with these events, the ruler (Hospodar) Dimitrie Cantemir of Moldavia and Tsar Peter signed the Treaty of Lutsk (13 April 1711), by which Moldavia pledged to support Russia in its war against the Ottomans with troops and by allowing the Russian army to cross its territory and place garrisons in Moldavian fortresses. In the summer of 1711, Peter led his army into Moldavia and united it with Cantemir&#x27;s forces near the Moldavian capital Iași; they then advanced southwards along the Pruth river. They aimed to cross the Danube, which marked the border between Moldavia and Ottoman territory proper. Meanwhile, the Ottoman government mobilized their own army, which outnumbered the Russo-Moldavian troops significantly. Under the command of Ottoman grand vizier Baltacı Mehmet Pasha, it advanced north to confront the Russians in June 1711.

==Military actions==
Peter assigned Field Marshal Boris Sheremetev to prevent the Ottoman army from crossing the Danube. However, harassment by the forces of the Crimean Khanate, a major Ottoman vassal which supplied the Ottoman army with light cavalry, and his failure to find enough food for his troops prevented him from achieving this objective. Consequently, the Ottoman army succeeded in crossing the Danube without opposition. Meanwhile, Fyodor Apraksin held the chief command in the Black Sea during the campaign.

===Siege of Brăila===
As the Russo-Moldavian army moved along the Prut, a portion of the Russian army under General Carl Ewald von Rönne moved towards Brăila, a major port town located on the left bank of the Danube (in Wallachia) but administered directly by the Ottomans as a kaza. The Russian army met with a portion of the Wallachian army commanded by &quot;Spatharios&quot; (the second-highest military commander after the ruler) Toma Cantacuzino, who disobeyed the orders of the ruler Constantin Brâncoveanu and joined the Russians. The two armies assaulted and conquered Brăila after a two-day siege (13–14 July 1711).

===Battle of Stănilești===
Peter and Cantemir concentrated their troops on the right bank of the Prut, across the river from the Ottomans. On 19 July, Ottoman janissaries and Tatar light cavalry crossed the Prut, by swimming or by boat, driving back the Russian advance guard. This allowed the remainder of the Ottoman army to build pontoon bridges and cross the river. Peter tried to bring up the main army to relieve the advance guard, but the Ottomans repulsed his troops. He withdrew the Russo-Moldavian army into a defensive position at Stănilești, where they entrenched. The Ottoman army rapidly surrounded this position, trapping Peter&#x27;s army. The janissaries repeatedly attacked, but were repulsed, suffering about 8,000 killed. However, the Ottomans bombarded the Russo-Moldavian camp with artillery, preventing them from reaching the Prut for water. Starving and thirsty, Peter was left with no choice but to sign a peace on Ottoman terms, which he duly did on 22 July. 

===Peace treaty===
The conflict was ended on 21 July 1711 by the Treaty of the Pruth, to the disappointment of Charles XII. The treaty, reconfirmed in 1713 through the Treaty of Adrianople (1713), stipulated the return of Azov to the Ottomans; Taganrog and several Russian fortresses were to be demolished; and the Tsar pledged to stop interfering in the affairs of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.

The Ottomans also demanded that Charles XII be granted safe passage to Sweden and asked the Tsar to hand over Cantemir. Although Peter acquiesced to all demands, he refused to fulfill the latter, under the pretext that Cantemir had fled his camp.

According to legend, the bribe Baltacı Mehmed Pasha received was effective in the fact that the treaty was lighter than the victory (amount of almost 2 wheelbarrows).

==Consequences==
Alexander Mikaberidze argues that Baltacı Mehmet Pasha made an important strategic mistake by signing the treaty with relatively easy terms for the Russians. Since Peter himself was commanding the Russian army, and had Baltacı Mehmet Pasha not accepted Peter&#x27;s peace proposal and pursued to capture him as a prisoner instead, the course of history could have changed. Without Peter, Russia would have hardly become an imperial power, and the future arch-enemy of the Ottoman State in the Balkans, the Black Sea basin and the Caucasus.

Although the news of the victory was first received well in Constantinople, the dissatisfied pro-war party turned general opinion against Baltacı Mehmet Pasha, who was accused of accepting a bribe from Peter the Great. Baltacı Mehmet Pasha was then relieved from his office.

An immediate consequence of the war was the change in Ottoman policies towards the Christian vassals states of Moldavia and Wallachia. In order to consolidate the control over the two Danubian Principalities, the Ottomans would introduce (in the same year in Moldavia, and in 1716 in Wallachia) direct rule through appointed Christian rulers (the so-called Phanariotes). The ruler Cantemir of Moldavia fled to Russia accompanied by a large retinue, and the Ottomans took charge of the succession to the throne of Moldavia by appointing Nicholas Mavrocordatos as ruler. The ruler Constantin Brâncoveanu of Wallachia was accused by the Sultan of colluding with the enemy. While the Russo-Moldavian army was on the move, Brâncoveanu had gathered Wallachian troops in Urlați, near the Moldavian border, awaiting the entry of the Christian troops to storm into Wallachia and offer his services to Peter, while also readying to join the Ottoman counter-offensive in the event of a change in fortunes. When Toma Cantacuzino switched to the Russian camp, the ruler was forced to decide in favor of the Ottomans or risk becoming an enemy of his Ottoman suzerain, and he swiftly returned the gifts he had received from the Russians. After three years, the Sultan&#x27;s suspicion and hostility finally prevailed, and Brâncoveanu, his four sons, and his counselor Ianache Văcărescu, were arrested and executed in Constantinople.

Charles XII and his political pro-war ally, the Crimean khan Devlet II Giray, continued their lobbying to have the Sultan declare another war. In the spring of 1712 the pro-war party, which accused the Russians of delaying to meet the terms negotiated in the peace treaty, came close to achieving their goal. War was avoided by diplomatic means, and a second treaty was signed on 17 April 1712. A year after this new settlement, the war party succeeded, this time accusing the Russians of delaying in their retreat from Poland. Ahmed III declared another war on 30 April 1713. However, there were no significant hostilities and another peace treaty was negotiated very soon. Finally the Sultan became annoyed by the pro-war party and decided to help the Swedish king to return to his homeland. Ahmed III also deposed Devlet II Giray from the throne of the Crimean Khanate and sent him into exile to the Ottoman island of Rodos because he didn&#x27;t show enough respect to Charles XII during the campaigns against Russia (Devlet II Giray considered Charles XII a prisoner and ignored his commands). Charles XII left the Ottoman Empire for Stralsund in Swedish Pomerania, which by then was besieged by troops from Saxony, Denmark, Prussia and Russia.

<text>James Kiberd (born July 6, 1949 in Providence, Rhode Island) is an American actor.

He played Trevor Dillon on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; from 1989 to 2000. A popular character from the beginning, he was paired in relationships with the character Natalie Marlowe (Kate Collins), Laurel Banning (Felicity LaFortune) and later, Natalie&#x27;s nutty twin sister Janet Green (played also by Kate Collins, later by Robin Mattson). He was the uncle of Hayley Vaughn (Kelly Ripa); for years, Hayley lovingly called him &quot;Uncle Porkchop,&quot; while he affectionately referred to her as &quot;Tinkerbell.&quot;

&quot;The Book of Lists: The 90&#x27;s Edition &quot; by Wallace and Wallechinsky cites him as No. 11 between Tim Allen No. 10 and Steve Martin No. 12 in the &quot;15 Top Celebrity Q Scores&quot;.

His other Soap opera credits include &quot;Another World&quot; and &quot;Loving&quot;. He has been married since 1986 to soap actress Susan Keith, whom he met on the set of &quot;Loving&quot; (she played core character Shana Sloane on the show for many years).

In 2001, Kiberd filled in for Benjamin Hendrickson in the role of Hal Munson on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; while he was away on urgent family business.

Since 2001 Kiberd has performed primarily on stage and in film. Of the dozen Shakespeare roles he has performed, his &quot;Petruchio&quot; won the best actor &quot;Zoni&quot; in 2004. He stars as Elliot in the film &quot;Soldier&#x27;s Heart&quot; which had its world premier at the GI Film Festival in Washington, D.C., on May 18, 2008; winning for best narrative film.

He was awarded &quot;The Meyer Schapiro Artist Award &quot; at Augusta State University in 1999 and the publication of &quot;James Kiberd Drawings&quot; accompanied the exhibit there.

Recipient of the 1994 Danny Kaye Humanitarian Award in recognition of his visionary advocacy on behalf of children worldwide,
Kiberd was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 1995.

<text>is an adult-themed adventure game released by JAST, for the Japanese NEC PC-8801 and MSX computers in May 1985.

Set in a Japanese high school, the goal of the game is to seduce Yumiko Shiraishi (白石 由美子), the star of the tennis club. To seduce her, the protagonist will have to become acquainted and intimate with her friends by talking to them.

The gameplay is simple; the player interacts with the environment by typing in commands in Japanese or choosing commands from the list using the arrow keys.

The game had moderate success, leading to standalone sequels. One of the sequels, &quot;Tenshitachi no Gogo III Bangaihen&quot; (天使たちの午後III 番外編) has a cult following in South Korea.

<text>Charles Allen (born March 3, 1977) is a Canadian track and field athlete, specializing in hurdling and sprinting.

Born in Georgetown, Guyana, Allen emigrated to Canada, first to Brampton where he attended Turner Fenton Secondary School, and then to Malton where he went to Ascension of Our Lord Secondary School.

Allen represented Canada at the 1996 World Junior Championships in Athletics in the 100 and 200 metres. Representing the Clemson Tigers track and field team, Allen won the 1999 4 × 400 meter relay at the NCAA Division I Indoor Track and Field Championships.

He competed for Guyana in the 110 metres hurdles at the 2000 Summer Olympics, and still holds the Guyanese record in that event. By the time of the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Allen was again representing Canada.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Allen made the finals in the 110 m hurdles after setting a new personal best time in each of the qualifying rounds. He finished a respectable sixth, but in a slower time than he had hoped. He was also captain of Canada&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay team, but the team failed to pass the qualifying stages. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, however, Allen won a bronze medal with the Canadian relay team.

<doc id="932697" wikidata="Q6202933" url="?curid=932697" title="Jipi and the Paranoid Chip">
<text>&quot;Jipi and the Paranoid Chip&quot; is a science fiction short story by Neal Stephenson that appeared in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s July 7, 1997 issue. It is part of the Baroque Cycle/Cryptonomicon universe.

==Plot==
The story deals with the concepts of mindshare and evolutionary software.

Jipi, a former Pacific-rim airline flight attendant, is staying with her friend in a high-rise luxury apartment building inside Manila&#x27;s walled district of Intramuros. The fiftieth floor of a neighboring high-rise houses the Asian-Pacific headquarters of Mindshare Management, under regional supervisor Mr. Cardoza. Goto Engineering is conducting a citywide sewer replacement project which produces unpleasant gases that have hurt the city&#x27;s hospitality industry. Jipi, looking for work, is given employment by Mr. Cardoza at the Manila Hotel in order to monitor guests in the lobby for signs of having noticed the unpleasant sewer gases and having the guests distracted by Cardoza&#x27;s actors before they become aware of the construction across the street and lower the hotel&#x27;s reputation by word of stay experiences.

Mr. Cardoza explains a new job to Jipi. A California software firm, under contract with requests from law enforcement, have produced evolving software inclined to detect paranoid schizophrenics during conversations over the Internet. Eventually, several million descendent generations of software are evolved that mimics the persona of a paranoid human, thus making them ideal against a hacker trying to shut them down. Shenzhen begins to make pirated wholesale copies of the chip, which are sold to a tariff-free zone city in North Africa, leading to the manufacture of an evolved theft-deterrent - an alarm-activated car bomb. Not knowing a proper amount of explosives to use with the car alarms, one manufacturer&#x27;s particular shipment of Czech Semtex is equally divided into 48 customer deliveries, each with enough charge to level part of a city block. After one levels a mall in California, Mr. Cardoza, in Manila, is hired to track down the remaining 47 vehicles using each vehicle&#x27;s wireless internet modems. Recognizing Jipi&#x27;s charm, he recruits her to type messages in internet conversation to the next of the remaining schizoid-induced personality car alarms via satellite connection to track down clues to its location until local police can shut it down.

==Genre==

The story takes place in the same universe as &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; and &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;. Mention is made of Homer/Homa Goto, presumably a descendant of Goto Dengo, and his firm, Goto Engineering; of the Bank of Manila and Kinakuta; and of the Black Chamber, also known as the International Data Transfer Regulatory Organisation. It is presumably set in the first half of the 21st century, a generation after the events of Cryptonomicon.

<doc id="932704" wikidata="Q3070530" url="?curid=932704" title="Ocean Beach, San Diego">
<text>Ocean Beach (also known as O.B.) is a beachfront neighborhood in San Diego, California.

==Geography==
Ocean Beach lies on the Pacific Ocean at the estuary of the San Diego River, at the western terminus of Interstate 8. Located about northwest of downtown San Diego, it sits south of Mission Bay and Mission Beach and directly north of Point Loma. The O.B. community planning area comprises about 1 square mile (742 acres), bounded on the north by the San Diego River, on the west by the Pacific Ocean, on the east by Froude St., Seaside St. and West Point Loma Boulevard, and on the south by Adair Street.

==History==

Prior to European contact, the Kumeyaay people inhabited Ocean Beach and had established the fishing encampment of &quot;Hapai&quot;. The Kumeyaay visited the area to conduct fishing and food processing operations, as mussels, clams, abalone, and lobsters were harvested from the area.

The beach&#x27;s initial name was Mussel Beach, for the mussels available there. Its current name, Ocean Beach, was given in 1887 by developers Billy Carlson and Albert E. Higgins.

The pair built the Cliff House, a resort hotel, and subdivided the area into lots. To promote their subdivision, Carlson and Higgins organized various activities, including mussel roasts and concerts. Despite their efforts, the development did not do well, because it was two and a half hours by carriage from downtown San Diego. They rented a locomotive, but by that time, the boom ended and the development was put on hold. The Ocean Beach Railroad, launched in April 1888, was a casualty of the economic decline. Passengers could take a ferry from San Diego to Roseville in Point Loma to ride the train to the Cliff House. Later, Higgins committed suicide, and a fire started by a fallen chandelier burnt down the Cliff House in 1898. Carlson sold the Ocean Beach tract to an Eastern financier, delaying its development for 20 years.

Carlson and Higgins were not the first to file a subdivision map in Ocean Beach. They filed with the city on May 28, 1887, but on April 22 of that year J.M. DePuy filed &quot;DePuy&#x27;s Subdivision&quot; on 15 blocks in the northern portion of O.B.

One of the earliest residents of Ocean Beach was D. C. Collier, who bought oceanfront property there in 1887 when he was just 16. He later became one of the &quot;fathers&quot; of Ocean Beach, laying out streets, promoting sales, and building the Point Loma Railroad in 1909 to connect Ocean Beach with the rest of San Diego. By 1910 there were 100 houses in Ocean Beach, compared to just 18 two years earlier. According to historian Ruth Held, Collier&#x27;s rail line &quot;made OB possible.&quot; He also built Ocean Beach Elementary School (a two-room school) and donated park land to the city. Most of that land became Cleator Community Park (a ballfield), Correia Middle School (originally named Collier Junior High School), a YMCA and a church; a small remnant at Greene and Soto streets is still called Collier Park.

The northern end of Ocean Beach was dominated in the early 20th century by the Wonderland Amusement Park, which opened on July 4, 1913 and was constructed on eight oceanfront acres at Voltaire and Abbott streets. It boasted a large roller coaster, dance pavilion, menagerie, roller skating rink, merry-go-round, children&#x27;s playground, a petting zoo with a variety of animals including 500 monkeys, and 22,000 lights outlining the buildings. However, Wonderland went bankrupt in 1915 due to competition from the Panama–California Exposition in Balboa Park and was sold at auction. It closed in 1916 after winter storms damaged the roller coaster. The name &quot;Wonderland&quot; lives on in some Ocean Beach business names as well as the title of a documentary series on KPBS television hosted by Ocean Beach native Noah Tafolla.

In 1915, John D. Spreckels and his Bayshore Railway Company built a wooden bridge connecting Ocean Beach with Mission Beach. The company used the bridge for a trolley, part of the San Diego Class 1 Streetcars, which connected OB with downtown San Diego and encouraged the development of both Ocean Beach and Mission Beach. The bridge was demolished in January 1951, thereby cutting off through traffic to Ocean Beach from the Mission Beach and Pacific Beach communities.

The small cottages, bungalows, single-family homes and two-storied apartments in the residential areas, were filled with college students from several local colleges, joined by a good number of sailors, retirees and middle-class families. Some of the bungalows built as tourist accommodations atop the cliffs on either side of Niagara Avenue are still in use as businesses and homes.

With the dredging and development of Mission Bay and the dismantling of the Ocean Beach-Mission Beach bridge, O.B. became geographically isolated from the rest of San Diego and the other beach communities, until the construction of Interstate 8 in 1967. The westernmost segment of I-8 from Interstate 5 to the terminus in Ocean Beach is officially labeled the &quot;Ocean Beach Freeway&quot;.

Surfing was introduced to San Diego at Ocean Beach in 1916 when a local lifeguard borrowed a board from Duke Kahanamoku (although it&#x27;s possible that George Freeth surfed there between 1907 and 1909). By 1966, the sport was sufficiently established that the World Surfing Championship was held in O.B. Nat Young won the event and was named world surfing champion.

The Prohibition Law was set in the 1920’s and banned selling alcohol. The 18th Amendment was in effect to stop selling alcohol and became illegal. Many believed it was the “America&#x27;s National Curse,” and having this law will strengthen families but didn&#x27;t last long. “Thousands of jobs were eliminated when breweries, distilleries, and saloons were shut down.” Their goal was to strengthen families to end up ruining the economy. The only way there was access to alcohol were speakeasies. Tijuana was the one of the main places with speakeasies that was still selling alcohol while people went through the border and back. Before the Ocean Beach Tavern was designed as a prohibition roadhouse to conceal alcohol behind for customers. One of the main speakeasies in Ocean Beach that is still open to now, Tony&#x27;s did the same. In addition to Tony’s speakeasies, there are well known historic restaurants that lasted a while.

Ocean Beach was once known as the Haight-Ashbury of San Diego. The community became an attraction for hippies, who eventually became accepted by many local business establishments. The Black headshop opened on Newport Avenue, as well as the Ocean Beach People&#x27;s Organic Food Market.

Beginning in the early 1970s, local development and land interests pressed for the development of Ocean Beach&#x27;s oceanfront, with plans for tourist-oriented resorts, hotels and a marina outlined in the Ocean Beach Precise Plan. With the passage of a height limit in 1972 and the re-writing of the Precise Plan, the development plans for the waterfront were abandoned.

== Architecture ==

===Historic district===
Ocean Beach contains the Ocean Beach Cottage Emerging Historic District consisting of various Craftsman bungalows, cottages and other structures built from 1887 to 1931.

There are a number of other individual San Diego Historic Landmarks in Ocean Beach. Designated city historic landmark buildings are the Ocean Beach Library and Strand Theater.

===Strand Theater===
The historic single-screen movie house, the Strand Theater, opened in November 1925. In the late 1970s, the Strand survived with midnight showings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show on Friday and Saturday nights. By the early 1980s it was running pornographic films. Community reaction forced it to change back to regular films. It closed in the 1990s and was converted into a clothing store after several failed attempts to preserve it as a theater. The theater was designated a historic building by the San Diego Historical Resources Board in December 2002.

===Pier===
The , built in 1966, was the longest concrete pier in the world and the second longest ocean pier in California. The pier was closed in January 2021 due to storm damage. It was partially reopened in May of that year, but its long-term future was uncertain; a 2019 report said the pier had suffered significant deterioration and reached &quot;the end of its useful life&quot;. It did reopen for several months in the summer of 2023. That winter it suffered severe damage during a storm and the city subsequently announced plans to demolish and replace it with a new design based on community input. A concrete walkway spans part of the length of the beach.

== Economy ==

The economy of Ocean Beach is dominated by small, independent retail businesses, including the clothing brand Seedless Clothing. Newport Avenue, the main business street, featured family-owned businesses from the 1930s through the 1960s, such as a bakery, drug stores, a book and novelty shop, a shoe store, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s apparel shops, and a family-owned pet store. In the 1960s and 1970s, larger stores and shopping malls elsewhere in the city gradually ran the small local stores out of business. Many of the storefronts were then turned into antique stores, and the area is now known as the Ocean Beach Antique District. Also on Newport are restaurants, head shops, tattoo and piercing shops, coffee houses, bars, bike and surf shops, and an international youth hostel. In 1969, Hodad&#x27;s opened on Newport, gaining national attention in 2007 after appearing on &quot;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives&quot;. There are several small independent hotels in O.B., but no nationally franchised hotels.

The community has actively opposed chain businesses opening in Ocean Beach, and only a few exist there. In the 1970s, community protests led a chain of donut stores to drop its plans to open a store in O.B. In 2000 an Exxon station abandoned its attempt to open a gas station there. In 2001, an organized grassroots effort attempted unsuccessfully to block Starbucks from opening a coffee shop in Ocean Beach. In 2019, a similar grassroots effort was unsuccessful in stopping Target from moving in on Newport Avenue.

==Community==

Residents of Ocean Beach often refer to themselves as &quot;OBceans&quot; or &quot;OBecians,&quot; which is pronounced &quot;oh-BEE-shun&quot; (although the proper spelling is a matter of dispute).

Ocean Beach has two schools: Ocean Beach Elementary (a K-4 public school) and Warren-Walker (a K-8 private school). The community also features multiple churches, a public library, a U.S. post office, and a vegetarian food co-op. Recreational facilities include the Ocean Beach Recreation Center, Dusty Rhodes Park, and the Robb Field athletic fields and skate park.

Local events include the Ocean Beach Street Fair and Chili Cookoff in late June, a jazz festival at the foot of Newport in late September, the Ocean Beach Christmas Parade in early December, the Ocean Beach Kite Festival on the third Saturday of May, and the Ocean Beach Canine Carnival on the third Saturday in October. On Wednesday afternoons two blocks of Newport Avenue are closed for a farmers&#x27; market.

The northern end of O.B.&#x27;s waterfront is known as Dog Beach. It&#x27;s open 24 hours a day for leash-free dogs and was one of the first such beaches in the United States (founded in 1972).

Ocean Beach and adjacent Point Loma are home to a sizable population of feral parrots and their offspring. The sub-tropical climate is nearly ideal for parrots. The parrots, mostly Amazons, are most active and vocal at sunrise and sunset.

Santa Cruz Ave. is a street in Ocean Beach that begins at a cul-de-sac by Catalina Blvd. and ends at a cliffside that has access to stairs that lead to the beach below. At the bottom is a small cove named Santa Cruz Cove, hidden from other parts of the beach. The cove has access from the Ocean Beach Pier but is only accessible during low tides. On multiple occasions, heavy surf at the cove has swept people out into the water, causing injuries and deaths.

<doc id="932710" wikidata="Q144352" url="?curid=932710" title="ArmSCII">
<text>ArmSCII or ARMSCII is a set of obsolete single-byte character encodings for the Armenian alphabet defined by Armenian national standard 166–9. ArmSCII is an acronym for Armenian Standard Code for Information Interchange, similar to ASCII for the American standard. It has been superseded by the Unicode standard.

However, these encodings are not widely used because the standard was published one year after the publication of international standard ISO 10585 that defined another 7-bit encoding, from which the encoding and mapping to the UCS (Universal Coded Character Set (ISO/IEC 10646) and Unicode standards) were also derived a few years after, and there was a lack of support in the computer industry for adding ArmSCII.

== Encodings defined in the ArmSCII standard ==
Very few systems support these encodings. Microsoft Windows does not support them, for example. It is usually better to use Unicode for proper interchange of Armenian text for web browsers and email, since most modern computers do not support ArmSCII by default.

The following three main variants are defined:
* ArmSCII-7 defined in AST 34.005 is a 7-bit encoding, not containing Latin characters.
* ArmSCII-8 defined in AST 34.002 is an 8-bit encoding and a superset of ASCII.
* ArmSCII-8A defined in AST 34.002 is an alternate 8-bit encoding and also a superset of ASCII.

Note that each ArmSCII encoding also has several minor variants, depending on the revision of the related Armenian standard (which was not made official before 1997, and was defined informally before that; this has caused various confusions and the mappings described below are just best practices according to the latest 1997 revision of the Armenian standard); that may change the exact mapping and usage of a few punctuation characters and symbols.

None of the ArmSCII encodings have reached international approval (unlike the ISO 10585 standard, despite the critiques sent by the official Armenian standard body to ISO/DIS JTC 1/SC 2/WG 2, working on single byte-coded character sets) because all international efforts have been made since then to work with the UCS (in Unicode and ISO 10646).

ArmSCII-8 is intended for use on Unix and Windows systems, and for information interchange on the WWW and by email. However, Microsoft wanted users to use Unicode and not introduce a plethora of new code pages, so it is not supported natively on Windows. It just consists in remapping ArmSCII-7 in the higher range above the standard US ASCII range.

ArmSCII-8A is intended for use on DOS and Mac systems. It is a rearrangement of ArmSCII-8, to work with existing DOS and Mac code that reserve a range of code values for characters not intended for text but for presentation layout, using modified fonts; it is, however, considered as a &quot;hack&quot; of the code pages over which it is applied, as neither DOS (nor Windows in the &quot;OEM&quot; compatibility codepages used by the text-only console) nor MacOS has ever supported this encoding natively, notably in their file system (but this is also true for the now deprecated ISO 10585 standard). However, this encoding cannot map all the punctuation characters normally needed for Armenian, so the missing characters must be approximated using fallbacks to ASCII punctuation (some Armenian fonts may display these ASCII punctuation using the rendering intended for the Armenian characters that are mapped to them by these fallbacks).

=== ArmSCII-7 ===
In this table, code value 21 is the eternity sign, which has, since 2013, a designated point in Unicode U+058E (LEFT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN) and another for its right-facing variant: U+058D (RIGHT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN). Some mappings incorrectly claim that it has a code point of U+0530.

Code value 20 is the regular SPACE character; code values 00–1F and 7F are not assigned to characters by AST 34.005, though they may be the same as the ASCII control characters that are located in those positions.

Code value 22 is used to encode the Armenian ligature &quot;ew&quot; (և). In some variants, it encodes the section sign (§) instead. It is strongly suggested to encode this ligature with the normal Armenian ech (&quot;yech&quot;) and yiwn (&quot;vyun&quot;) small letters pair, as various software or fonts will render it differently depending on the version of ArmSCII-7 they are assuming, and so let the renderer generate the ligature.

Code value 7F may be used sometimes as a substitution for the non-breaking space.

Note that the characters encoded at code values 2D and 7E (Armenian hyphen and apostrophe) may not be visible with all fonts supporting Armenian.

This table is simply remapped to higher codes by simple offset in ArmSCII-8 (below).
=== ArmSCII-8 ===
In this table, code value 20 is reserved for the regular SPACE character, code value A0 is reserved for the non-breaking space, and code value A1 is assigned to the eternity sign, which has, since 2013, a designated point in Unicode U+58E (LEFT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN) and another for its right-facing variant: U+58D (RIGHT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN). Some mappings incorrectly claim that it has a code point of U+0530.

Code values 00–1F and 7F–9F are not assigned to characters by AST 34.002, though they may be the same as the ISO-8859-1 control characters that are located in those positions.

The code value A2 is used to encode the Armenian ligature &quot;ew&quot; (և). In some variants it encodes the section sign (§) instead. Some Armenian fonts display this ligature at the position of the ASCII ampersand symbol, but it is strongly suggested to encode the ligature using the two standard Armenian small letters that compose it.

The code value FF may be filled with the Armenian small letter modifier apostrophe (but it has no mapping in Unicode, and shown here using the ASCII apostrophe instead, for correct rendering with Unicode fonts, it is suggested that the small letter modifier be represented using code value FE with ligature control to change its position because it only occurs after a small Armenian letter), and the Armenian apostrophe encoded at FE occurs only after a capital Armenian letter. So most implementations do not encode anything at code value FF.

This standard is the only one that makes an apparent distinction for the &quot;mirrored&quot; Armenian parentheses, because it was created by simply remapping the ArmSCII-7 standard. However, many documents will not consider this as a productive distinction, and the usual ASCII-based parenthesis punctuation are most commonly used instead of the ArmSCII-7-based mirrored parentheses, just because Armenian keyboards and editors using ArmSCII-8 generated the lower ASCII codes (whose usage is just swapped in classical Armenian). Also, the duplication of the ASCII comma at code value AB is also the result of the simple remapping of ArmSCII-7, so there is no difference with the ASCII comma that most ArmSCII-8 documents are using.

Note that the characters encoded at code values AD and FE (Armenian hyphen and apostrophe) may not be visible with all fonts supporting Armenian. FreeDOS calls this Code Page 65506.
=== ArmSCII-8A ===
In this table, code value 20 is the regular SPACE character, and code value DC is the eternity sign, which has, since 2013, a designated point in Unicode U+58E (LEFT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN) and another for its right-facing variant: U+58D (RIGHT-FACING ARMENIAN ETERNITY SIGN). Some mappings incorrectly claim that it has a code point of U+0530.

Code values 00–1F, 7F, and B0–DB are not assigned to characters by AST 34.002, though they may be the same as those used in a legacy DOS/OEM codepage 437 (box drawing characters) or Macintosh Roman.

Note that the characters encoded at code values DD and FE (Armenian hyphen and apostrophe) may not be visible with all fonts supporting Armenian. FreeDOS calls this Code Page 899 (probably an error, as IBM uses this code page number for a different encoding.
== Support for the Armenian script in other standards ==

=== ISO 10585:1996 ===
For comparison, this is the 7-bit encoding in the international standard ISO/IEC 10585 standard that was used before the revision in the Armenian standard AST34.002:1997 (ArmSCII-8).

In this standard (as well as in ISO/IEC 10646 and Unicode), there&#x27;s only one Armenian apostrophe modifier letter encoded at 0x49 when Armenian uses two modifier letter apostrophes which are cased (U+055A represents the capital apostrophe but is not considered dual-cased in Unicode and this ISO 15985 standard, the small letter apostrophe is absent but generally represented by the ASCII apostrophe U+0027 in Unicode documents).

The left half-ring punctuation (a modifier letter) and the eternity symbol are also missing, and only one double quotation mark (U+2033) is encoded in code value 7A instead of double guillemets in the three ArmSCII variants.

However, this standard maps the Armenian full stop (whose glyph looks very close to the ASCII colon) in code value 4C and the Armenian abbreviation mark (that looks very similar to an angular grave accent) in code value 4F, that are both missing from all ArmSCII code charts.

Note that the characters encoded at code values 49 and 4A (Armenian apostrophe and hyphen) may not be visible with all fonts supporting Armenian.
=== Windows Paratype code page, replaced by ArmSCII-8 by 2005 ===
This encoding is supported by FontLab Studio 5. This encoding was previously used by Paratype, but it was replaced by ARMSCII-8.
=== ISO/IEC 10646-1 and Unicode ===

For comparison, this is the Unicode code points charts for Armenian.

Its encoding since Unicode 1.1 (except the Armenian hyphen U+058A, the last character added since Unicode 3.0) was based on the previous ISO 10585 7-bit international encoding standard, rather than on ArmsCII that was missing a dozen of characters present in ISO 10585. However, non-letters were reorganized by type, and some extensions have been added for rare Armenian characters that were missing in all past 7-bit and 8-bit standards.

Capital letters are encoded in the first half of the block (terminated by modifier letters).

Lowercase letters are encoded in the second half of the block (terminated by Armenian punctuation signs).

Unlike the ArmSCII encodings, this encoding is stable and portable across systems, and contain all characters needed for Armenian (with the exception of the Armenian eternity sign). Some Unicode-encoded fonts for Armenian are mapping the eternity sign at code point U+0530. This is incorrect, as that code point has been allocated in 2013 at U+58E, and another for its right-facing variant: U+58D.

However, no distinction is kept for the Armenian (mirrored) parenthesis, so the standard ASCII/Unicode punctuation must be used according to their usual rendering. The left half-ring mark (modifier letter) is encoded here, and some other marks are unified with other scripts (notably the quotation marks, middle dot and dashes).

Note that the characters encoded at code points U+055A and U+058A (Armenian apostrophe and hyphen, like in the charts for ArmsCII and ISO 10585), and as well as U+0559 (the modifier mark for numeric, added specifically into ISO 10646-1 and Unicode), may not be visible with all fonts supporting Armenian.

Note that some transcodings are shown below between parentheses. They are only approximation fallbacks but do not map exactly the intended character.

<doc id="932711" wikidata="Q3889376" url="?curid=932711" title="Carmichael's theorem">
<text>In number theory, Carmichael&#x27;s theorem, named after the American mathematician R. D. Carmichael,
states that, for any nondegenerate Lucas sequence of the first kind &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) with relatively prime parameters &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot; and positive discriminant, an element &quot;Un&quot; with &quot;n&quot; ≠ 1, 2, 6 has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any earlier one except the 12th Fibonacci number F(12) = &quot;U&quot;12(1, −1) = 144 and its equivalent &quot;U&quot;12(−1, −1) = −144.

In particular, for &quot;n&quot; greater than 12, the &quot;n&quot;th Fibonacci number F(&quot;n&quot;) has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any earlier Fibonacci number.

Carmichael (1913, Theorem 21) proved this theorem. Recently, Yabuta (2001) gave a simple proof. Bilu, Hanrot, Voutier and Mignotte (2001) extended it to the case of negative discriminants (where it is true for all &quot;n&quot; &gt; 30).

==Statement==
Given two relatively prime integers &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, such that formula_1 and , let be the Lucas sequence of the first kind defined by
:formula_2

Then, for &quot;n&quot; ≠ 1, 2, 6, &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any &quot;Um&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) with &quot;m&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, except &quot;U&quot;12(±1, −1) = ±F(12) = ±144.
Such a prime &quot;p&quot; is called a &quot;characteristic factor&quot; or a &quot;primitive prime divisor&quot; of &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;).
Indeed, Carmichael showed a slightly stronger theorem: For &quot;n&quot; ≠ 1, 2, 6, &quot;Un&quot;(&quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;) has at least one primitive prime divisor not dividing &quot;D&quot; except &quot;U&quot;3(±1, −2) = 3, &quot;U&quot;5(±1, −1) = F(5) = 5, or &quot;U&quot;12(1, −1) = −&quot;U&quot;12(−1, −1) = F(12) = 144.

In Camicharel&#x27;s theorem, &quot;D&quot; should be greater than 0; thus the cases &quot;U&quot;13(1, 2), &quot;U&quot;18(1, 2) and &quot;U&quot;30(1, 2), etc. are not included, since in this case &quot;D&quot; = −7 &lt; 0.

==Fibonacci and Pell cases==
The only exceptions in Fibonacci case for &quot;n&quot; up to 12 are:

:F(1) = 1 and F(2) = 1, which have no prime divisors
:F(6) = 8, whose only prime divisor is 2 (which is F(3))
:F(12) = 144, whose only prime divisors are 2 (which is F(3)) and 3 (which is F(4))

The smallest primitive prime divisor of F(&quot;n&quot;) are
:1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 13, 7, 17, 11, 89, 1, 233, 29, 61, 47, 1597, 19, 37, 41, 421, 199, 28657, 23, 3001, 521, 53, 281, 514229, 31, 557, 2207, 19801, 3571, 141961, 107, 73, 9349, 135721, 2161, 2789, 211, 433494437, 43, 109441, ... 
Carmichael&#x27;s theorem says that every Fibonacci number, apart from the exceptions listed above, has at least one primitive prime divisor.

If &quot;n&quot; &gt; 1, then the &quot;n&quot;th Pell number has at least one prime divisor that does not divide any earlier Pell number. The smallest primitive prime divisor of &quot;n&quot;th Pell number are
:1, 2, 5, 3, 29, 7, 13, 17, 197, 41, 5741, 11, 33461, 239, 269, 577, 137, 199, 37, 19, 45697, 23, 229, 1153, 1549, 79, 53, 113, 44560482149, 31, 61, 665857, 52734529, 103, 1800193921, 73, 593, 9369319, 389, 241, ...

<text>Edie Arlisa Brickell (born March 10, 1966) is an American singer-songwriter widely known for 1988&#x27;s &quot;Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars&quot;, the debut album by Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians, which went to No. 4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; albums chart. She is married to singer-songwriter Paul Simon.

==Early life==
Brickell was born in the Oak Cliff neighborhood of Dallas, Texas, to Larry Jean (Sellers) Linden and Paul Edward Brickell. She was raised with her older sister, Laura Strain. She attended Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts in Dallas, and later studied at Southern Methodist University until she joined a band and decided to focus on songwriting.

== Music career ==
=== Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians ===
In 1985, Brickell was invited to sing one night with friends from her high school in a local folk rock group, New Bohemians. She joined the band as lead singer. After the band was signed to a recording contract, the label changed the group&#x27;s name to Edie Brickell &amp; New Bohemians. Their 1988 debut album, &quot;Shooting Rubberbands at the Stars&quot;, became a critical and commercial success, including the Top Ten single &quot;What I Am&quot;. The band&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Ghost of a Dog&quot; (1990), was a deliberate effort to highlight the band&#x27;s eclectic personality and move away from the pop sound of their first record.

In these first two albums and subsequent tours Brickell became known as a singer who could create lyrics on the spot. Of this talent she said, &quot;It&#x27;s nothing special...strange thoughts are always running through my head.&quot;
The band sporadically played gigs after the album &quot;Ghost of a Dog&quot; in 1990, and in 2006 released &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. In 2018 they announced their latest album, &quot;Rocket&quot;, along with dates for a US tour. The band released their fifth studio album &quot;Hunter and the Dog Star&quot; in 2021 available on CD and vinyl.

=== Solo career ===
Brickell had a role as a folk singer in the 1989 film &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot;. Her version of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;A Hard Rain&#x27;s a-Gonna Fall&quot; is featured on the film&#x27;s soundtrack. She also sang a cover version of Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; in the 1990 film &quot;Flashback&quot;.

As a solo artist, Brickell released &quot;Picture Perfect Morning&quot; (1994) and &quot;Volcano&quot; (2003). The video for &quot;Picture Perfect Morning&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Good Times&quot; was included as part of the multimedia samples featured on Microsoft&#x27;s &quot;Windows 95 Companion&quot; CD-ROM. In 1992, she worked with producer Bob Wiseman in New York and Toronto on a collection of songs, utilizing a wind ensemble, unusual keyboards, and Ron Sexsmith. The songs were rejected by the record company and remain unreleased.

=== The Gaddabouts ===
In 2010, Brickell became a founding member of new band The Gaddabouts, consisting of Steve Gadd on drums, Edie Brickell as lead vocalist and guitar, Andy Fairweather Low on electric and acoustic guitars and background vocals, Pino Palladino on bass and guitar, and featuring Dan Block, Ronnie Cuber, Joey DeFrancesco, Gil Goldstein, and Marcus Rojas. In 2011, Brickell wrote the title track, &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;, for Tamar Halpern&#x27;s film, &quot;Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life&quot;.

=== Edie Brickell and Steve Martin ===
&quot;Love Has Come for You&quot; was released on April 23, 2013. The album is a collaboration with Steve Martin. Both appeared on talk shows, such as &quot;The View&quot; and &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, to promote the album in April 2013.

Starting in May 2013, she toured with Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers throughout North America.

In 2016, the musical &quot;Bright Star&quot;to which she contributed music, lyrics, and storyopened on Broadway at the Cort Theatre.

In 2017, Brickell and Martin appeared in the documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon. They recorded &quot;The Coo Coo Bird&quot;, a traditional English folk song, live on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. The track appeared on the accompanying soundtrack, &quot;Music from The American Epic Sessions.&quot;

=== Heavy MakeUp ===
In 2023, Brickell became the founding vocalist of new band Heavy MakeUp, alongside brass player CJ Camerieri and trumpeter Trever Hagen. The band combines vocals, synth, brass, and drum machines in their music. Their self-titled debut album was released in 2023, and their sophomore album, &quot;Here It Comes&quot;, was released in 2024.

==Personal life==
Brickell married singer-songwriter Paul Simon on May 30, 1992. It was her first marriage and Simon&#x27;s third. Brickell was performing &quot;What I Am&quot; on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 5, 1988, when she noticed Simon standing in front of the cameraman. &quot;Even though I&#x27;d performed the song hundreds of times in clubs, he made me forget how the song went when I looked at him. We can show the kids the tape and say, &#x27;Look, that&#x27;s when we first laid eyes on each other. Brickell and Simon have three children, Adrian, Lulu, and Gabriel.

==Summary==
The Mahakam River is the largest river in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, with a catchment area of approximately 77,100 km2. The catchment lies between 2˚N to 1˚S latitude and 113˚E to 118˚E longitude. The river originates in Cemaru from where it flows south-eastwards, meeting the River &quot;Kedang Pahu&quot; at the city of &quot;Muara Pahu&quot;. From there, the river flows eastward through the &quot;Mahakam lakes&quot; region, which is a flat tropical lowland area surrounded by peat land. Thirty shallow lakes are situated in this area, which are connected to the Mahakam through small channels . Downstream of the connection with the Semayang and Melintang lakes, the Mahakam meets three other main tributaries – the rivers Belayan, Kedang Kepala, and &quot;Kedang Rantau&quot; – and flows south-eastwards through the Mahakam delta distributaries, to the Makassar Strait.

==Geology==
Kalimantan, where the Mahakam lies, is part of the Sunda Continental Plate. The large island has mountain ranges between Indonesia and Malaysia. As described by van Bemmelen (1949), River Mahakam rises in &quot;Cemaru&quot; () in the center of Kalimantan, and from there it cuts through the pre-tertiary axis of the island east of the &quot;Batuayan&quot; () and then reaches the tertiary basin of Kutai. Its middle course traverses a lowland plain with many marshy lakes. This intermontane depression is separated from the neighboring basin, the &quot;Barito depression&quot;, by a broad hilly tract of less than altitude. After this region, the Mahakam cuts through the Samarinda anticlinorium and reaches its alluvial delta, which spreads like a broad fan over the shelf-sea, with a base of and a radius of about .

Upstream of Long Iram (upstream part of Mahakam river basin), the river is flowing in tertiary rocks (Voss, 1983). Between &quot;Long Iram&quot; and Muara Kaman (middle Mahakam area) the river is flowing in quaternary alluvium, while in the downstream area between &quot;Muara Kaman&quot; and the coast including the Mahakam delta, tertiary rocks are again present. The presence of the large delta is explained by the formation and rejuvenation of the hilly region near Samarinda.

==Climate==
The Mahakam catchment is around the equator. The average annual rainfall in the catchment area is 3163 mm. The average runoff is around 1911 mm. According to Köppen climate classification, this area belongs to type &quot;Af&quot; (tropical rainforest) and has a minimum temperature ≥18 °C and precipitation of the driest month in normal year ≥60 mm Transfer of mass and energy in the tropical zone occurred through general air circulation known as the Hadley cell. According to &quot;Seidel et al.&quot; (2008), the precipitation pattern in this area is largely determined by this large-scale atmospheric wind pattern, which is observable in several ways throughout the atmosphere. This circulation carries moisture into the air, generating rainfall in equatorial regions, whereas the edges of the tropical belt are drier. Within this circulation, evaporation occurs intensively around the equator on the center of low pressure called the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), characterized by the accumulation of clouds in the area. The ITCZ moves following the pseudo-motion of the sun within the 23.5°N and 23.5°S zone, therefore its position always changes according to this motion.

The ITCZ drives the Indo-Australian monsoon phenomena which influence the regional climate including the Mahakam catchment. In December, January, and February (winter in the Northern Hemisphere) the concentration of high pressure in Asia and low pressure in Australia make the west wind blow in Indonesia (west monsoon). In June, July, and August concentration of low pressure in Asia (summer in the Northern Hemisphere) and a concentration of high pressure in Australia make the east wind blow in Indonesia (east monsoon). Due to the global air circulation and the regional climate mentioned above, the Mahakam catchment which is located around the equator has a bimodal rainfall pattern with two peaks of rainfall, which are generally occurred in December and May. This is because the ITCZ passes through the equator twice a year, from the Northern Hemisphere in September and from the Southern Hemisphere in March.

==Discharge==

Average discharge of the Mahakam River at Melak (Upper Mahakam), Kota Bangun (Middle Mahakam) and Loa Kulu (Lower Mahakam).
Average monthly flow (Q–m3/s). Mahakam River at Samarinda:
Average discharge:

* Minimum 375 m3/s, maximum 12,200 m3/s (record 24,156 m3/s in 2012)

==Lakes==
There are about 76 lakes spread in the Mahakam river basin and about 30 lakes are located in the middle Mahakam area including the three main lakes (&quot;Lake Jempang&quot; 15,000 Ha; &quot;Lake Semayang&quot; 13,000 Ha; &quot;Lake Melintang&quot; 11,000 Ha). The lake levels are seasonally fluctuated from 0.5 m – 1 m during the dry period to seven meters during the rainy season. The Mahakam lakes and surrounding wetlands act as water storage as well as a trap of sediment contained in the water flowing into the lakes which are now known to become shallower, presumably as a result of an imbalance between sediment input and slow subsidence.

Fishing is the primary source of livelihood in the Mahakam lakes area, most of the people around the lakes are fishermen. The middle Mahakam Lake area is an area of intensive fishing activity with a productivity of 25,000 to 35,000 metric tons per year since 1970.

==Delta==

The Mahakam delta is a mixed fluvial-tidal dominated delta. The delta covers about , consisting of mangrove areas near the shore, Nypa swamps in the central areas, and lowland forest near the apex, corresponding to the first bifurcation. Fishery development in this area has converted a vast area of mangrove into shrimp ponds (tambak). However, recent mangrove restoration efforts have taken place in the delta by replanting mangroves in abandoned shrimp ponds and encouraging silvofishery. Many areas in the Mahakam delta are already naturally recolonized by mangrove vegetation contributing to ecosystem restoration. Mangroves also function as sedimentation-enhancing strategies by capturing sediment-causing accretion.

The delta has three main distributary systems directed Northeast, Southeast, and South. The area between distributaries consists of a series of tidal channels generally unconnected to the main distributaries. The distributary channels are narrow and rectilinear with the depth ranging from and distributary channel bifurcations appear every .

This lower Mahakam area is the second most productive hydrocarbon basin of Indonesia which contains around 3 billion barrels of oil and 30 Tcf of gas reserves. Field geological investigations in this area were started in 1888 and in 1897 exploration drilling discovered oil at a shallow depth of on the Louise structure. Production started in 1898 followed by expansion of exploration to the entire Mahakam.

*Period: 1971–2000

==Ecology==

Mahakam and its floodplain is an ecologically important region. A total of 147 indigenous freshwater fish species had been identified from the Mahakam. The Mahakam hosts the freshwater dolphin Irrawaddy dolphin (&quot;Orcaella brevirostris&quot;; called Pesut by local people) a critically endangered species, which is included in CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I.

The Mahakam river basin is also important breeding and resting place for 298 bird species, among them 70 protected and five endemic species: the dusky munia, Bornean whistler, Bornean peacock-pheasant, Bornean blue-flycatcher and Bornean bristlehead. Some 160,000 ha of the delta has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International.

A research cluster (): &quot;Upsetting the balance in the Mahakam Delta: past, present and future impacts of sea level rise, climate change, upstream controls and human intervention on sediment and mangrove dynamics&quot; extensively researches the Mahakam. The cluster&#x27;s objective is to study the impact of external forcing factors such as sea-level rise, climate change, upstream sediment, as well as human interference on past, present, and future development of the Mahakam delta in different time scales.

===Pollution===
Logging and mining activities have contributed to the &quot;alarming rate&quot; of pollution of East Kalimantan&#x27;s Mahakam River. Tests of water pollutants showed levels increased sharply between 2009 and 2011. Despite the growing pollution, it is claimed that &quot;the water is still safe for consumption.&quot;

Unsafe concentrations of heavy metals have been observed in Mahakam fish. A 2015 study found lead concentrations over 1000 times safe levels along with unsafe levels of copper, zinc, and cadmium.

==Bridges==
Bridges include the Mahakam Bridge and the Kutai Kartanegara Bridge. The latter collapsed on 26 November 2011, it took 3 years of planning and one and half years more to rebuild a new bridge on the same spot. The new Kutai Kertanegara Bridge has been open for public use since 8 December 2015, after an opening ceremony held by a local regent.

==Social aspect==

The River Mahakam is an economic resource for fishermen and farmers and a freshwater source, as a waterway since ancient times until today. It is in this river basin where the Kutai kingdom evolved. The Kutai history is divided into two periods, Kutai Martadipura (around 350–400 AD) and Kutai Kartanegara period (around 1300). Kutai Martadipura, a Hindu kingdom founded by Mulawarman at Muara Kaman, is regarded as the oldest kingdom in Indonesia. Kutai Kartanegara was founded by settlers from Java at Kutai Lama near the mouth of Mahakam. In around 1565, Islam was extensively spread in Kartanegara by two Moslem preachers from Java, Tunggang Parangan and Ri Bandang.

The Dayaks are the indigenous people inhabiting Kalimantan beside the Kutais and the Banjars. Since the 1970s transmigration of people to East Kalimantan was organized by the Indonesian government, especially in areas near River Mahakam. Transmigration aims to migrate people from overpopulated Java, Bali, and Madura islands to stimulate greater agricultural productivity in the outer islands. By 1973, almost 26% of the land under cultivation in East Kalimantan was being worked by migrants.

<text>&quot;The Great Simoleon Caper&quot; is a short story by Neal Stephenson that appeared in &quot;TIME&quot; on March 1, 1995. It deals with concepts familiar to Stephenson&#x27;s readers: encryption, digital currency, and distributed republics. It appears to be set in a United States that precedes the events in Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Snow Crash&quot; (1992), using an early version of his Metaverse.

==Plot summary==
In the story, the protagonist is an underemployed mathematician who resides in the house of his brother&#x27;s family in Chicago. The brother, owner of an advertising agency, has won a large contract to create ads for &quot;Simoleons&quot;, a form of non-governmental electronic &quot;currency&quot;. To launch the product, they plan to give away 27 million Simoleons to the winners of a contest. The contest is based on the long-used format of &quot;guess the number of jelly beans in the container&quot;, with Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field and 26 other football stadiums as the containers.

The brother asks the mathematician (&quot;the hero&quot;) to do the calculations needed. The hero complies with the request, using the calculator function of the family&#x27;s advanced set-top box to speed the long math. Sometime later, while taking a rest break from his online job in the Metaverse, the hero is contacted by a representative of a group of &quot;crypto-anarchists&quot; who have formed a virtual nation called the First Distributed Republic. The FDR warns the hero that the government, which fears E-money, has stolen his calculations by compelling the cable company to tap the family&#x27;s set-top box. The government plans to give the answers to a group of planted people, who will then proceed to ruin the reputation of Simoleons through various disinformation schemes.

The hero has no actual worry about this, except that his parents are heavily invested in his brother&#x27;s advertising agency; as the agency would be liable for the loss of security on a project they have contracted for, the agency would go bankrupt, and their parents would lose their money. The FDR, on the other hand, wish to prove that not only would E-money work, but that it can circumvent government controls such as taxes. Together, the hero and the FDR create a simple scheme to foil the plot.

<doc id="932731" wikidata="Q5312732" url="?curid=932731" title="Duke Bainum">
<text>Mark Edmund &quot;Duke&quot; Bainum (July 21, 1952 – June 9, 2009) was an American politician and physician. Bainum served in the Hawaii State House of Representatives as a member of the Hawaii Democratic Party and was elected in a nonpartisan race to the Honolulu City Council and held various committee chairmanships during his tenure. In 2004, Bainum ran for Mayor of Honolulu in the state of Hawaii, but lost to former White House Aide Mufi Hannemann. Bainum was married to Jennifer Toma Bainum.

==Education and medical career==
According to a 2012 interview with Katie Sullivan, Bainum was born in Takoma Park, Maryland to Irvin C. Bainum, a banker, and Evea J. Bainum, and raised &quot;dirt poor&quot; with his older brother Timothy. His paternal uncle, Stewart W. Bainum, Sr., was the founder of Choice Hotels, a hotel chain, and HCR Manor Care, a retirement facility chain.

In 1980, he graduated from the University of Maryland School of Medicine and moved to Honolulu, Hawaii to attend the University of Hawaii Surgical Residency Program at the John A. Burns School of Medicine. While there, Bainum&#x27;s colleagues nicknamed him &quot;Duke&quot; because his Arkansas accent made him sound like John Wayne. He reportedly liked it so much that he officially made part of it his legal name in 1987. Bainum completed his internship two years later.
 After becoming a physician, Bainum treated patients in Nepal for three months, helped Kauai residents after Hurricane Iniki, and from 1987 to 2004 was an on-call doctor at the Sex Abuse Treatment Center in Honolulu.

==Politics==
Bainum entered politics when he served on the Ala Moana/Kaka&#x27;ako Neighborhood Board between 1987 and 1989. He then chaired the McCully-Mo&#x27;ili&#x27;ili Neighborhood Board from 1989 to 1990. From 1990–94, he served in the State House and was then elected to the City Council from 1995-2003. In 2004, Bainum decided to run for Honolulu mayor against Mufi Hannemann, spending nearly twice as much as Hannemann. Considered the early front-runner, he lost by a narrow margin (1,300 votes). In January 2008, Bainum again returned to the political ring and won Honolulu City Council seat District 5, running unopposed, although not without controversy, as some questioned whether he was a legal resident of Hawaii at the time.

==Religion==
Bainum attended New Hope Christian Fellowship and was an Evangelical Christian.

==Death==
Around 9:30 pm on June 9, 2009, Bainum reportedly experienced chest pains while driving. He pulled over and called 911. Paramedics took him to the Queen&#x27;s Medical Center, where he later died. The medical examiner reported the cause of death as an aortic aneurysm. A senior adviser to Bainum said that there were no other warning signs other than chest pain, that Bainum &quot;was feeling well at work&quot; and &quot;having fun chasing the kids around in the evening&quot;. Bainum&#x27;s unexpected death was the second to hit the City Council in six months (Barbara Marshall died in February).

<doc id="932743" wikidata="Q1013836" url="?curid=932743" title="Tag out">
<text>In baseball and softball, a tag out, sometimes just called a tag, is a play in which a baserunner is out because a fielder touches him with the ball or with the hand or glove holding the ball, while the ball is live and the runner is in jeopardy of being put out (usually when he is not touching a base).

A baserunner is in jeopardy when any of the following are true:

# he is not touching a base (excluding overrunning of first base or when advancing to an awarded base, such as on a base on balls)
# he is touching a base he has been forced to vacate because the batter became a baserunner (a forced runner)
# he has not tagged up on a caught fly ball
# he failed to touch a base when he last passed it, or failed to touch them in order
# he is touching a base that a preceding baserunner is also touching (excludes touching a base he was forced to advance to, in which case the preceding baserunner is in jeopardy unless also forced to advance to an awarded base)

A tag is therefore the most common way to retire baserunners who are not in danger of being forced out, though a forced runner may also be tagged out in lieu of stepping on the forced base. Additionally, a tag out can be used on an appeal play.

== Overview ==
Runners attempting to advance are sometimes thrown out, which means that a fielder throws the ball to someone covering the base, who then tags the runner before he touches the base. A runner who leads off a base (advances before the pitch is thrown) too far might be picked off; that is, the pitcher throws to a fielder covering the base, who then tags the runner out.
When a runner is tagged out, a further advanced runner who had been forced to advance no longer has to do so. For example, when a sharply hit ball is caught on one hop by the first baseman, he might immediately tag out the runner at first who is forced to advance to second, but when this is done, a runner already at second is no longer forced to advance to third base. The result of such a tag is called &quot;removing the force&quot;.

When an attempt to tag a baserunner has been initiated by a fielder in possession of the ball, then an imaginary base path is formed which is wide, extending from the runner to the base that the runner is trying to reach safely. If the runner steps outside of the base path, then they are automatically out. However, if a defensive player tags the runner with his glove and the baseball is in his other hand, or with his free hand while the baseball is in his glove, then the runner is not out. Also, if the fielder drops the ball after the tag, the runner is safe.

== History ==
In historical variations of baseball, runners could be retired if the ball was thrown directly at them while they were not on a base, a practice referred to as &quot;soaking&quot; or &quot;plugging&quot;. The 1845 Knickerbocker Rules were one of the major early codifications of baseball which banned soaking and mandated tagging instead, allowing for harder baseballs to be used.

<doc id="932745" wikidata="Q4634840" url="?curid=932745" title="31st Infantry Division (United States)">
<text>The 31st Infantry Division (&quot;Dixie&quot;) was an infantry division of the United States Army National Guard, active almost continuously from 1917 to 1968. Composed of men from Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Illinois, and Mississippi at various points in its existence, the division saw service in both World War I and World War II, and was mobilized during the Korean War, although it was not sent overseas in the latter.

Organized in 1917 during World War I from the national guardsmen of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, the division deployed to France in September 1918, arriving weeks before the Armistice of 11 November that ended the war. In France, it was reduced to a cadre and most of its troops used to provide replacements for units already in France. It returned to the United States in December and was demobilized in January 1919.

The 31st was reorganized in 1923 with national guardsmen from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi. It was mobilized in 1940 during World War II, and spent several years training in the United States. In 1944 it was sent to the South-West Pacific Area, fighting in the New Guinea campaign and in the Battle of Mindanao. After the end of the war the division was demobilized in December 1945.

In 1946, the 31st was reactivated with Alabama and Mississippi units. Mobilized during the Korean War, the division served stateside at Camp Atterbury and Camp Carson. The 31st was demobilized in 1954 and reorganized in Alabama and Mississippi. During the height of the Civil rights movement, Mississippi elements of the division were called up to restore order during the Ole Miss riot of 1962, while Alabama elements were Federalized to ensure school integration during 1963 and to keep order during the Selma to Montgomery marches of 1965. In 1968 the division was eliminated, with its units becoming part of the 30th Armored Division.

==World War I==

=== Organization and training ===
According to the 5 May 1917 organization plan of National Guard divisions, selected units from Alabama, Florida, and Georgia were to form the 10th Division, though it was not organized at the time. On 18 July, the War Department designated National Guard troops of these three states to form the 31st Division. For training, the division was directed to concentrate at Camp Wheeler, Georgia, on 3 August; the Alabama, Florida, and Georgia National Guards were drafted into federal service two days later. However, the units that were to form the 31st did not begin concentration until 25 August, when Major General Francis Joseph Kernan took command. Kernan was replaced by 56th Field Artillery Brigade commander Brigadier General John Louis Hayden, the senior brigade commander, on 18 September.

The division included the 61st and 62nd Infantry Brigades and the 56th Field Artillery Brigade by the end of the concentration period. The 61st included the 5th Georgia Infantry, separate Georgia infantry companies, and detachments of the 1st and 2nd Georgia and 1st Florida Regiments of Infantry; the 62nd included the 1st Alabama and 2nd Florida Infantry, and detachments of the 1st Florida and 1st Georgia Regiments of Infantry and of the 1st Alabama Cavalry; the 56th included detachments of the Georgia Field Artillery, the 1st Florida, 1st Georgia, and 2nd Alabama Regiments of Infantry, and of the 1st Alabama Cavalry.
On 1 September, the 31st was reorganized in accordance with the tables of organization of 8 August, which called for a square division with four infantry regiments. As a result, the 61st Brigade included the 121st and 122nd Infantry with the 117th Machine Gun Battalion, the 62nd included the 123rd and 124th Infantry with the 118th Machine Gun Battalion, and the 56th included the 116th, 117th, and 118th Field Artillery Regiments with the 106th Trench Mortar Battery. During October, the division was reinforced with 10,000 Selective Service draftees from Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, transferred from Camp Gordon, Georgia, Camp Jackson, South Carolina, and Camp Pike, Arkansas, as it began systematic training on 22 October. On 15 March 1918, Major General Francis H. French became division commander; he was replaced by Major General LeRoy Springs Lyon two months later.

However, from November 1917 to June 1918, the 31st transferred or otherwise lost almost all of its infantry privates and about half of its artillery privates, including 4,300 who were sent to Camp Merritt, New Jersey, in June for shipment overseas as replacements. In June, 9,200 men from Michigan and Illinois were transferred to the division, followed by 5,700 more from Illinois in July. By 21 July, the division fielded 24,000 men, with its officers mostly from the Organized Reserve Corps and the National Army. The 56th Field Artillery Brigade left to train at Camp Jackson on 24 July, while the 2nd Battalion, 122nd Infantry relocated to Camp Greene, North Carolina, on 20 August. During the latter month, 2,000 men, including 1,200 from Camp Travis, Texas, joined the 31st. On 28 September, the 61st Infantry Brigade commander, Brigadier General Walter Alexander Harris, took command of the division, leading it until 14 November.

=== Overseas deployment and demobilization ===

The division began its overseas movement in September, relocating via Camp Mills to the Brooklyn, Hoboken, and New York Ports of Embarkation. The 106th Engineers and Train were the first to depart from New York on 16 September, arriving in Scotland on 29 September. On the latter date, the Advance Detachment of the division sailed from Hoboken, arriving at Brest on 7 October. The division headquarters (aboard the USS &quot;Orizaba&quot;), most of the infantry, the 106th Field Signal Battalion, and the 106th Train Headquarters and Military Police sailed between 30 September and 11 October. They landed at Brest between 13 and 21 October, except for the 117th and 118th Machine Gun Battalions and the 106th Train Headquarters and Military Police, which arrived in England on 17 October. The 56th Field Artillery Brigade sailed with the remaining infantry and trains between 14 and 28 October, and landed at Brest between 25 October and 9 November, except for the 124th Infantry, which landed in England on 24 October. The troops in England spent a brief period in rest camps, then moved to Brest through Cherbourg and Le Havre.

For duty with the Services of Supply, the 106th Engineers, without Train, relocated from Le Havre to Brest on 4 October. Once in France, the 31st was planned to become the seventh depot division, a cadre formation responsible for processing replacements and forwarding them to frontline units. As six depot divisions were already operating, the American Expeditionary Forces&#x27; Chief of Staff did not believe that a seventh depot division was necessary, and on 17 October the 31st Division was instead ordered skeletonized. Two days later, the division headquarters, both infantry brigades, the 116th Machine Gun Battalion, 106th Supply Train, and 106th Train Headquarters and Military Police moved to Le Mans, with some units relocating through the Loches area, while the remaining units were detached from the division when they arrived at Brest. On 29 October, the division was ordered to be further reduced to a record cadre numbering 10 officers and 102 men, although the 56th Field Artillery Brigade was detached to Camp Coëtquidan for training. The 106th Trench Mortar Battery of the brigade relocated to Vitrey on 4 November, preceded by the 106th Field Signal Battalion, which left for the Signal Corps Replacement Depot at Cour-Cheverny on 30 October.

The division headquarters, both infantry brigades, the 116th Machine Gun Battalion, and 106th Train Headquarters and Military Police were skeletonized early in November. Most of the personnel were transferred to the 2nd Depot Division for processing and reassignment as replacements. The 106th Sanitary Train, which had remained at Brest, relocated to Camp de Souge on 25 November, and thence to the American Embarkation Center at Le Mans in December, where it was skeletonized. On 27 November, the record cadre and 56th Field Artillery Brigade (without the 106th Trench Mortar Battery) moved to Brest, from which they sailed aboard the USS &quot;Manchuria&quot; between 9 and 10 December. After arriving at Camp Merritt on 20 December, they moved to Camp Gordon on 1 January 1919, where the record cadre and 56th Brigade demobilized on 14 January.

Elements of the division remained in France for several months longer, however. The 106th Supply Train relocated to Camp de Souge on 29 November. The 106th Trench Mortar Battery and part of the 106th Sanitary Train sailed on 2 and 15 January, respectively. The 106th Field Signal Battalion departed Bordeaux on 18 April, and the last units of the division overseas, the 106th Engineers and 106th Supply Train, returned to the United States on 5 July.

== Interwar period ==

Under the National Defense Act of 1920, the 39th Division was allotted to Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, part of IV Corps, in 1921. On 1 July 1923 it was reorganized, less the Arkansas units, and renamed the 31st Division, following the recommendations of a joint board of Regular and Guard officers, due to its allocation to states which raised the 31st Division in World War I. In August 1924, the division, except for the 124th Infantry, conducted squad and platoon level training at Camp McClellan, its designated mobilization training center, due to its troops being relatively inexperienced. Its headquarters was organized and Federally recognized on 15 October of that year, stationed at St. Augustine, Florida, under the command of Major General Albert H. Blanding of Florida. During the interwar period, the division was organized in accordance with a square organization similar to its World War I structure, although medical and quartermaster regiments and a separate headquarters for special troops (the division headquarters, ordnance, signal, and light tank companies) were added and the division artillery initially lacked a 155 mm howitzer regiment.

The 141st Field Artillery (75 mm) was initially assigned to the states of Louisiana and Alabama, but was reorganized in 1926 when the Louisiana elements were reorganized as the 167th Separate Battalion, Field Artillery (Horse) and assigned to the 23rd Cavalry Division. The regiment, by this time an all-Alabama unit, was redesignated the 117th Field Artillery in 1927, taking the designation of a partially Alabama-organized unit that had served with the 31st Division in World War I. In 1932-1933, the 114th Field Artillery (155 mm howitzer) was organized in Mississippi and assigned to the division.

During the interwar period, the division did not train together in most years, as separate summer camps were held for the units of each state. Florida units trained at Camp J. Clifford R. Foster, Alabama units at Camp McClellan, Mississippi units at Camp Shelby, and Louisiana and sometimes Mississippi units at Camp Beauregard. The division staff, which included men from all four states, conducted joint summer training at Camp McClellan between 1924 and 1926 and 1929 and 1931, Camp Beauregard in 1927, Camp Foster in 1928, and Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, in addition to participation in multiple corps area and army command post exercises, including the September 1936 Third Army command post exercise at San Antonio. On 4 March 1933, the divisional headquarters was relocated to Bartow, Florida.

Elements of the 31st were called up for state duty several times during the interwar period. Its Louisiana and Mississippi units were called up to provide emergency relief due to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. Florida units provided relief in response to the 1926 Miami hurricane, the 1928 Okeechobee hurricane, and the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. They also helped to enforce the 1928–1930 Mediterranean fruit fly quarantine.

Blanding became Chief of the National Guard Bureau on 30 January 1936 and was temporarily replaced by Louisiana Brigadier General Louis F. Guerre during his tenure in that position, which lasted until 30 January 1940. In August 1938, the division was reunited for the Fourth Corps Area concentration of the Third Army Maneuver in the De Soto National Forest, during which it operated as part of the provisional IV Corps. Between 17 and 23 December 1939, the division staff conducted supplementary winter training at Jackson Barracks to prepare for the upcoming Louisiana Maneuvers. During the maneuvers, held in the Kisatchie National Forest during August 1940, the 31st operated as part of IV Corps against VIII Corps. On 10 November the division headquarters relocated to Birmingham; Blanding retired on 18 November and was replaced by Alabama Major General John C. Persons, who led the division for most of the next four years.

=== Mobilization and training ===

As a result of World War II, the division was mobilized along with the entire National Guard and inducted into federal service on 25 November 1940 at home stations. Instead of being sent to Camp McClellan, the 31st went to Camp Blanding, arriving on 22 December to discover that it was still under construction. After being brought to war strength by the assignment of Selective Service draftees from its home area of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi, the division participated in the IV Corps Louisiana Maneuvers in August 1941, the GHQ maneuvers near Good Hope Church between September and October as part of IV Corps, and the First Army Carolina Maneuvers near Ruby and Chesterfield, South Carolina during October and November as part of IV Corps, before returning to Camp Blanding. On 15 December 1941, the 124th Infantry Regiment was relieved from assignment to the 31st Division. It was used as school troops for the Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia until it was inactivated at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on 2 March 1944. 

During mid-1942, six National Guard divisions were used as &quot;virtual pools&quot; by the Army Service Forces to provide cadres and fillers for thousands of new service units not previously envisioned in the Army troop basis, many earmarked for the upcoming Allied invasion of Axis-occupied French North Africa. The 30th, 31st, and 33rd Infantry Divisions were stripped of over 50% of their strength, while the 35th, 38th, and 44th Infantry Divisions suffered losses almost as great. The 31st Infantry Division declined from a strength of 15,200 in June 1942 to 7,200 in August. In the 38 months following its federalization in November 1940, the division gave up 1,453 officers and 22,511 enlisted men, enough personnel to man two divisions&#x27; worth of officers and one-and-a-half divisions&#x27; worth of enlisted men.

The 156th Infantry Regiment of the Louisiana National Guard was separated from the 31st Division on 14 July 1942. The unit was sent to England and then to Oran, Algeria, where it was redesignated the 202nd Infantry Battalion and assigned to military police duties due to the large number of French-speaking members of the unit. Portions of the unit participated in the D-Day landings, with the entire unit being reunited on 24 June 1944. The unit was later used to guard allied headquarters and supply lines in liberated territory. The unit returned to the US on 11 March 1946. 

The 124th Infantry was temporarily replaced in the 31st Division by the 154th Infantry Regiment (a former designation of the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment from 1921-1923 until it was redesignated the 124th Infantry), which was activated 20 September 1942 in the Army of the United States. On 5 April 1944, the 154th Infantry was disbanded and its personnel and equipment used to reactivate the 124th Infantry Regiment.

===Combat chronicle===
The 31st Infantry Division arrived in Oro Bay, New Guinea, 24 April 1944, and engaged in amphibious training prior to entering combat. Alerted on 25 June 1944 for movement to Aitape, New Guinea, the 124th RCT left Oro Bay and landed at Aitape 3–6 July 1944. The combat team moved up to advanced positions and took part in the general offensive launched 13 July, including the bloody Battle of Driniumor River.

Meanwhile, the remainder of the division relieved the 6th Infantry Division in the Sarmi-Wakde island area, 18 July 1944, built bridges, roads, and docks, patrolled the area, and engaged small units of the enemy, trying not to provoke a large scale counterattack by the enemy. Over 1,000 Japanese were killed in these actions. In mid-August the division began to stage for a landing on Morotai, leaving Aitape and Maffin Bay, 11 September 1944. The division made an assault landing on Morotai, 15 September 1944, meeting only light opposition. During the occupation of Morotai, elements of the division, primarily the 167th Infantry Regiment, seized Mapia, 15–17 November, and waded ashore on the Asia Islands, 19–20 November, only to find the Japanese had already evacuated.

Other elements reverted to Sansapor, where they maintained and operated the base. On 22 April 1945, the division landed on Mindanao to take part in the liberation of the Philippines. The division was helped by the Filipino troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary units and the local organized Christian and Islamic guerrillas fight the Japanese. Moving up the Sayre Highway and driving down the Kibawe-Talomo trail, fighting in knee-deep mud and through torrential rains, the 31st forced the enemy to withdraw into the interior and blocked off other Japanese in the Davao area. With the end of hostilities on 15 August, the 31st and the Philippine Commonwealth military were accomplished the surrender of all Japanese forces remaining in Mindanao.

The division returned to the United States and was inactivated at Camp Stoneman on 21 December.

===Casualties===
*Total battle casualties: 1,733
*Killed in action: 340
*Wounded in action: 1,392
*Prisoner of war: 1

==Postwar==
The division was reorganized postwar in Alabama and Mississippi, with its Alabama part federally recognized at Birmingham on 1 November 1946, followed by the Mississippi part at Greenville on 2 December.

After the Korean War broke out in 1950, the division was called to active duty on 16 January 1951 at Birmingham. No units were deployed, but individuals representing three-fourths of the authorized strength were sent to either Korea or Japan as replacements. The 31st Infantry Division was transferred to Fort Carson, Colorado in February 1954 from Camp Atterbury. The 31st Division as an active service formation was then inactivated, with its personnel and equipment transferring to the 8th Infantry Division on 15 June. Meanwhile, in Alabama and Mississippi, units of the National Guard of the United States were organized to replace those on active duty, including a NGUS division headquarters at Birmingham on 26 June 1953.
The 31st Infantry (NGUS) Division was effectively reformed with units from Alabama and Mississippi, with its headquarters moving to Mobile on 10 December 1956 and back to Birmingham on 2 May 1959. It served as a National Guard division until its inactivation on 14 January 1968.

The division headquarters became the headquarters of the 31st Brigade, 30th Armored Division at Tuscaloosa on the next day. The headquarters company of the 2nd Brigade became the headquarters company of the new 31st Brigade.

Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 31st Brigade, 30th Armored Division was reorganized and redesignated 1 November 1973 as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 31st Armored Brigade, and relieved of assignment from the 30th Armored Division. Location changed 1 February 1979 to Northport, Alabama. In 1984-5 the 31st Armored Brigade comprised the 1st Battalion, 131st Armor Regiment, 1st-152nd Armor, 1st-167th Infantry Regiment, 1st Battalion, 117th Field Artillery, E Troop, 31st Cavalry and the 31st Engineer Company. In 2002 it started transitioning to a chemical brigade, initially designated the 122nd. In November 2002 the brigade was redesignated the 31st Chemical Brigade.

<text>The notion of the Labor army (трудовая армия, трудармия) was introduced in Soviet Russia during the Russian Civil War in 1920. Initially the term was applied to regiments of Red Army transferred from military activity to labor activity, such as logging, coal mining, firewood stocking, etc.
==History==
The first labor army (1я Трудармия, 1-я армия труда) was created after the defeat of Kolchak on the base of the 3rd Army located in the Urals region by the initiative of the army commander Mikhail Matiyasevich (командарм Михаил Степанович Матиясевич).

Leon Trotsky, acting as People&#x27;s Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic at this time, developed this idea further. He argued that the economic situation in the country required introduction of the universal labor duty. In the case of workers, this could be done with the help of trade unions, while in the case of peasantry, Trotsky argued, it was possible only through mobilization.

He argued further that &quot;army-type organization is in fact inherently Soviet type of organization&quot;.

His critics argued that this idea was leading back to the times of tsarism and slavery. Trotsky retorted that unlike old times, workers were supposed to work not for exploiters, but for their own good, for their own state, i.e., labor duty is the fulfillment of the obligations of the liberated working class with respect to their &quot;worker-peasant state&quot; in the cases of emergency.

By the end of the Russian Civil War and the introduction of New Economic Policy the idea of the labor army ended, especially after Joseph Stalin&#x27;s assumption of power and the implementation of his policies of industrialization and collectivization, which effectively solved the problem of workforce mobilization both in industry and agriculture.

Later Trotskyists such as Isaac Deutscher and Tony Cliff have been critics of this policy but Ernest Mandel asserted that a myth had been constructed around the role of Trotsky in the trade-union debate. Mandel argued this controversy had been used by liberal circles in Russia to claim that Trotsky’s proposals on the “militarization of labour” had provided the groundwork for more repressive and authoritarian policies which were later adopted by Stalin against workers. Mandel believed this view overlooked historical ascertainable facts such as the extensive unemployment, lumpenization of workers and the fact there were no examples of repressive actions taken against workers in factories during the period of labour armies. Mandel further re-iterated that Trotsky&#x27;s attitudes was driven by his concern about the need to prepare workers for key positions in factory management and he had proposed replacing war communism with the NEP a year ahead of the party leadership.

==Nazi Germany==
In Nazi Germany, the Reich Labour Service was established to help mitigate the effects of unemployment on the German economy, militarise the workforce and indoctrinate it with Nazi ideology. It was the official state labour service, divided into separate sections for men and women.

==Later Soviet Union==
During World War II certain categories of population, primarily ethnic Germans, were conscripted into NKVD labor columns, in later literature informally referred to as &quot;labor army&quot;.

Until the last days of the Soviet Union, the Soviet Army incorporated the idea of the labor army. With obligatory military duty in the state, men deemed unfit for regular military duty but not unfit for other work, as well as many able-bodied ones, were assigned to &quot;construction battalions&quot; (стройбаты). This tradition continues in a number of post-Soviet states, notably Russia, Belarus and Turkmenistan.

<text>Wills have a lengthy history.

==Ancient Greece==
The Ancient Greek practice concerning wills was not the same in all places; some states permitted men to dispose of their estates, others wholly deprived them of that privilege. According to Plutarch, Solon &quot;is much commended for his law concerning wills; for before his time no man was allowed to make any, but all the wealth of deceased persons belonged to their families; but he permitted them to bestow it on whom they pleased, esteeming friendship a stronger tie than kindred, and affection than necessity, and thus put every man&#x27;s estate in the disposal of the possessor; yet he allowed not all sorts of wills, but required the following conditions in all persons that made them:

#That they must be citizens of Athens, not slaves, or foreigners, for then their estates were confiscated for the public use.
#That they must be men who have arrived to twenty years of age, for women and men under that age were not permitted to dispose by will of more than one medimn of barley.
#That they must not be adopted; for when adopted persons died without issue, the estates they received by adoption returned to the relations of the men who adopted them.
#That they should have no male children of their own, for then their estate belonged to these. If they had only daughters, the persons to whom the inheritance was bequeathed were obliged to marry them. Yet men were allowed to appoint heirs to succeed their children, in case these happened to die under twenty years of age.
#That they should be in their right minds, because testaments extorted through the frenzy of a disease, or dotage of old age, were not in reality the wills of the persons that made them.
#That they should not be under imprisonment, or other constraint, their consent being then only forced, nor in justice to be reputed voluntary.
#That they should not be induced to it by the charms and insinuations of a wife; for (says Plutarch) the wise lawgiver with good reason thought that no difference was to be put between deceit and necessity, flattery and compulsion, since both are equally powerful to persuade a man from reason.

Wills were usually signed before several witnesses, who put seals to them for confirmation, then placed them in the hands of trustees, who were obliged to see them performed. At Athens, some of the magistrates were very often present at the making of wills. Sometimes the &quot;archons&quot; were also present. Sometimes the testator declared his will before sufficient witnesses, without committing it to writing. Thus Callias, fearing to be cut off by a wicked conspiracy, is said to have made an open declaration of his will before the popular assembly at Athens. There were several copies of wills in Diogenes Laërtius, as those of Aristotle, Lyco of Troas, and Theophrastus; whence it appears they had a common form, beginning with a wish for life and health.&quot;

==Ancient Rome==
The development of Roman law furthered the modern understanding of wills and serves as the foundation to the inheritance law of many European countries, greatly aided later by canon law.

The early Roman will differed from the modern will in important respects. It was effectual during the lifetime of the person who made it; it was made in public &quot;&quot;; all knew of the legator&#x27;s intentions, the testator declaring his will in the presence of seven witnesses; and it could not be changedthese they called nuncupative wills; but the danger of trusting the will of the deceased to the memory of the living soon abolished these; and all wills were ordered to be in writing.

The objective, as in adoption, was to secure the perpetuation of the family. This was done by securing the due vesting of the breed in a person who could be relied upon to keep up the family rites. There is much probability in the conjecture that a will was only allowed to be made when the testator had no known gentile relatives, unless they had waived their rights. The Romans were wont to set aside wills, as being &quot;inofficiosa&quot;, deficient in natural duty, if they disinherited or totally passed by (without assigning a true and sufficient reason) any of the children of the testator.

It is certain from the text of Gaius that the earliest forms of will were those made in the &quot;comitia calata&quot; and those made in &quot;procinctu&quot;, or on the eve of battle. The former were published before the &quot;comitia&quot;, as representative of the patrician genies, and were originally a legislative act. These wills were the peculiar privilege of patricians. At a later time the form of plebeian will developed (&quot;irs/amentum per aes ci libram&quot;), and the law of testamentary succession was further modified by the influence of &quot;tile practor&quot;, especially in the direction of recognition of &quot;fideicommissa&quot; similar in some respects to testamentary trusts. &quot;Codicilli&quot;, or informal wills, also came into use and were sufficient for almost every purpose except for appointing an heir.

In the time of Justinian a will founded partly on the &quot;jus civile&quot;, partly on the edict of the &quot;praetor&quot;, partly on imperial constitutions and so called &quot;testamentum tripertitum&quot;, was generally in use. The main points essential to its validity were that the testator should possess testamentary capacity, and that the will should be signed or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of seven witnesses, or published orally in open court. The witnesses must be &quot;idonei&quot;, or free from legal disability. For instance, women and slaves were not good witnesses.

The whole property of the testator could not be alienated. The rights of heirs and descendants were protected by enactments which secured to them a legal minimum, the &quot;querela inofficiosi testamenti&quot; being the remedy of those passed over. The age at which testamentary capacity began was fourteen in the case of males, twelve in the case of females. Up to 439 A.D. a will must have been in Latin; after that date Greek was allowed.

Certain persons, especially soldiers, were privileged from observing the ordinary forms. The liability of the heir to the debts of the testator varied during different periods. At first it was practically unlimited. The law was then gradually modified in favour of the heir, until in the time of Justinian the heir who duly made an inventory of the property of the deceased was liable only for the assets to which he had succeeded. This limitation of liability is generally termed by the civilians &quot;beneficium inventarii&quot;.

Something like the English probate is to be found in the rules for breaking the seals of a will in presence of the praetor. Closely connected with the will was the donatio mortis causa, the rules of which have been as a whole adopted in England (see below). An immense space in the Corpus juris is occupied with testamentary law. The whole of part v. of the Digest (books xxviii.-xxxvi.) deals with the subject, and so do a large number of constitutions in the Code and Novels.

===Influence of Christianity===
In Christian tradition, Eusebius and others have related of Noah&#x27;s testament, made in writing, and witnessed under his seal, by which he disposed of the whole world. Additionally, wills are spoken of in the Old Testament (in Genesis 48), where Jacob bequeaths to his son Joseph, a portion of his inheritance, double to that of his brethren.

The effect of Christianity upon the will was very marked. For instance, the duty of bequeathing to the Church was inculcated as early as Constantine, and heretics and monks were placed under a disability to make a will or take gifts left by will. A will was often deposited in a church. The Canon law follows the Roman law with a still greater leaning to the advantage of the Church. No Church property could be bequeathed. Manifest usurers were added to the list of those under disability. For the validity of a will it was generally necessary that it should be made in the presence of a priest and two witnesses, unless where it was made in pias causes. The witnesses, as in Roman law, must be done. Gifts to the Church were not subject to the deductions in favour of the heir and the children necessary in ordinary cases. In England, the Church succeeded in holding in its own hands for centuries jurisdiction in testamentary matters.

This is practically in accordance with the definition of Modestinus in &quot;Digest&quot; xxviu. I, 1, &quot;voluntatis nostrae justa sententia de eo quod quis post mortem suam fieri velit.&quot; &quot;Ancient Law&quot;, chap. vi. dii. ioi.

In the &quot;Leges barbarorum&quot;, where they are unaffected by Roman law, the will, if it existed at all, was of a very rudimentary character. The will is, on the other hand, recognized by Rabbinical and Islamic law.

===Roman influence on English law===
The Roman law of wills has had considerable effect upon English law. In the words of Sir Henry Maine, &quot;The English law of testamentary succession to personalty has become a modified English form of the dispensation under which the inheritances of law. Roman citizens were administered.&quot; At the same time there are some broad and striking differences which should be borne in mind. The following among others (as of 1911) may be noticed:
#A Roman testator could not, unless a soldier, die partly testate, and partly intestate. The will must stand or fall as a whole. This is not the case in England.
#There is no one in English law to whom the universitas furis of the testator descends as it did to the Roman heirs, whose appointment was essential to the validity of a formal will, and who partook of the nature of the English heir, executor, administrator, devisee and legatee.
#The disabilities of testators differed in the two systems. The disability of a slave or a heretic is peculiar to Roman law, of a youth between fourteen and twenty-one to English law.
#The whole property may be disposed of in England; but it was not so at Rome, where, except by the wills of soldiers, children could not be disinherited unless for specified acts of misconduct. During the greater part of the period of Roman law the heir must also have had his Falcidian fourth in order to induce him to accept the inheritance.
#In English law all wills must conform to certain statutory requirements; the Romans recognized from the time of Augustus an informal will called &quot;codicilli&quot;. The English codicil has little in common with this but the name. It is not an informal will, but an addition to a will, read as a part of it, and needing the same formalities of execution.
#The Roman testatum applied to both movables and immovables; in England a legacy or bequest is a gift of personalty only, a gift of real estate being called a devise.
#The Roman will spoke from the time of making; the English speaks from the time of death. This difference becomes very important in case of alteration in the position of the testator between the making of the will and his death. As a rule the Roman will could not, the English can, pass after-acquired property.

==Development of the law of wills in England==
Liberty of alienation by will is found at an early period in England. To judge from the words of a law of Canute, intestacy appears to have been the exception at that time. How far the liberty extended is uncertain; it is the opinion of some authorities that complete disposition of land and goods was allowed, of others that limited rights of wife and children were recognized. However this may be, after the Conquest a distinction, the result of feudalism, arose between real and personal property. It will be convenient to treat the history of the two kinds of will separately.

===Land===

It became the law after the Conquest, according to Sir Edward Coke, that an estate greater than for a term of years could not be disposed of by will, unless in Kent, where the custom of gavelkind prevailed, and in some manors and boroughs (especially the City of London), where the pre-Conquest law was preserved by special indulgence. The reason why devise of land was not acknowledged by law was, no doubt, partly to discourage deathbed gifts in mortmain, a view supported by Glanvill, partly because the testator could not give the devisee that seisin which was the principal element in a feudal conveyance. By means of the doctrine to uses, however, the devise of land was secured by a circuitous method, generally by conveyance to feoffees to uses in the lifetime of the feoffor to such uses as he should appoint by his will. Up to comparatively recent times a will of lands still bore traces of its origin in the conveyance to uses &quot;inter vivos&quot;. On the passing of the Statute of Uses (27 Hen. 8. c. 10) lands again became non-devisable, with a saving in the statute for the validity of wills made before 1 May 1536. The inconvenience of this state of things soon began to be felt, and was probably aggravated by the large amount of land thrown into the market after the dissolution of the monasteries. As a remedy the Statute of Wills (32 Hen. 8. c. 1) was passed in 1540, and a further explanatory act, the (34 &amp; 35 Hen. 8. c. 5).

The effect of these acts was to make lands held in fee simple devisable by will in writing, to the extent of two-thirds where the tenure was by knight service, and the whole where it was in socage. Corporations were incapacitated to receive, and married women, infants, idiots and lunatics to devise. The Tenures Abolition Act 1660 (12 Cha. 2. c. 24), by abolishing tenure by knight service, made all lands devisable, in the same vein the Statute of Frauds (29 Cha. 2. c. 3) (1677) dealt with the formalities of execution. Up to this time simple notes, even in the handwriting of another person, constituted a sufficient will, if published by the testator as such. The Statute of Frauds required, &quot;inter alia&quot;, that all devises should be in writing, signed by the testator or by some person for him in his presence and by his direction, and should also be subscribed by three or four credible witnesses. The strict interpretation by the courts of the credibility of witnesses led to the passing of the &#x27; (25 Geo. 2. c. 6), making interested witnesses sufficient for the due execution of the will, but declaring gifts to them void. The will of a man was revoked by marriage and the birth of a child, of a woman by marriage only. A will was also revoked by an alteration in circumstances, and even by a void conveyance &quot;inter vivos&quot; of land devised by the will made subsequently to the date of the will, which was presumed to be an attempt by the grantor to give legal effect to a change of intention. As in Roman law, a will spoke from the time of the making, so that it could not avail to pass after-acquired property without republication, which was equivalent to making a new will. Copyholds were not devisable before 1815, but were usually surrendered to the use of the will of the copyhold tenant; the &#x27; (55 Geo. 3. c. 192) made them devisable simply. Devises of lands have gradually been made liable to the claims of creditors by a series of statutes beginning with the year 1691.

===Personal property===


The history of wills of personalty was considerably different, but to some extent followed parallel lines. In both cases partial preceded complete power of disposition. The general opinion of the best authorities is that by the common law of England a man could only dispose of his whole personal property if he left no wife or children; if he left either wife or children he could only dispose of one-half, and one-third if he left both wife and children. The shares of wife and children were called their &quot;pars rationabilis&quot;. This &quot;pars rationabilis&quot; is expressly recognized in Magna Carta and was sued for by the writ &quot;de rationabili parte&quot;. At what period the right of disposition of the whole personalty superseded the old law is uncertain. That it did so is certain, and the places where the old rule still existed—the province of York, Wales and the City of London—were regarded as exceptions. The right of bequest in these places was not assimilated to the general law until, for York, the passing of the &#x27; for the province of York (other than the City of York) and the &#x27; , for the City of York; for Wales by the (7 &amp; 8 Will. 3. c. 38) with the final assimilation not taking place until 1 June 1725 when the City of London Elections Act 1724 (11 Geo. 1. c. 18) abolished &quot;pars rationabilis&quot; for unmarried freemen of the City of London. A will of personalty could be made by a male at fourteen, by a female at twelve. The formalities in the case of wills of personalty were not as numerous as in the case of wills of land. Up to 1838 a nuncupative or oral will was sufficient, subject, where the gift was of £30 or more, to the restrictions contained in the Statute of Frauds. The witnesses to a written will need not be &quot;credible,&quot; and it was specially enacted by Administration of Justice Act 1705 (4 &amp; 5 Ann. c. 3) that any one who could give evidence in a court of law was a good witness to a will of personalty. A will entirely in the testator&#x27;s handwriting, called a holographic will, was valid without signature. At one time the executor was entitled to the residue in default of a residuary legatee, but the Executors Act 1830 (11 Geo. 4 &amp; 1 Will. 4. c. 40) made him in such an event trustee for the next of kin.

Jurisdiction over wills of personalty was until 1858 in the ecclesiastical courts, probate being granted by the diocesan court if the goods of the deceased lay in the same diocese, in the provincial court of Canterbury (the prerogative court) or York (the chancery court) if the deceased had &quot;bona notabilia&quot;, that is, goods to the value of £5 in two dioceses. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction was of a very ancient origin. It was fully established under Henry II, as it is mentioned by Glanvill. In the city of London wills were enrolled in the Court of Hustings from 1258 to 1688 after having been proved before the ordinary. Contested cases before 1858 were tried in the provincial court with an appeal originally to the Court of Delegates, later to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. There were also a few special local jurisdictions, courts baron, the university courts, and others, probably for the most part survivals of the pre-Conquest period, when wills seem to have been published in the county court. The ecclesiastical courts had no jurisdiction over wills of land, and the common law courts were careful to keep the ecclesiastical courts within their limits by means of prohibition. No probate of a will of land was necessary, and title to real estate by will might be made by production of the will as a document of title. The liability of the executor and legatee for the debts of the testator has been gradually established by legislation. In general it is limited to the amount of the succession. Personal liability of the executor beyond this can by the Statute of Frauds only be established by contract in writing.

===Legislation===
Such were the principal stages in the history of the law as it affected wills made before 1838 or proved before 1858. The principal acts in force in the early twentieth century were the Wills Act 1837 (7 Will. 4 &amp; 1 Vict. c. 26), the Wills Act Amendment Act 1852 (15 &amp; 16 Vict. c 24), the Court of Probate Act 1857 (20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 77), the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 &amp; 37 Vict. c. 66) the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 77), and the Land Transfer Act 1897 (60 &amp; 61 Vict. c. 65). All but the acts of 1837 and 1852 deal mainly with what happens to the will after death, whether under the voluntary or contentious jurisdiction of the Probate Division.
The earliest on the statute roll is an act of Henry III, the (20 Hen. 3. c. 2), enabling a widow to bequeath the crops of her lands. Before the Wills Act 1837 uniformity in the law had been urgently recommended by the Real Property Commissioners in 1833. It appears from their report that at the time of its appearance there were ten different ways in which a will might be made under different circumstances.

The Wills Act 1837 affected both the making and the interpretation of wills. Excluding the latter for the present, its main provisions were these:
* All property, real and personal, and of whatever tenure, may be disposed of by will.
* If customary freeholds or copyholds be devised, the will must be entered on the manorial rolls.
* No will made by any person under the age of twenty-one is valid.
* Every will is to be in writing, signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator or by some person in his presence and by his direction, and such signature is to be made or acknowledged by the testator in the presence of two or more witnesses present at the same time, who are to subscribe the will in the presence of the testator. It is usual for the testator and the witnesses to sign every sheet.
* Gifts to a witness or the husband or wife of a witness are void.
* A will is revoked by a later will, or by destruction with the intention of revoking, but not by presumption arising from an alteration in circumstances.
* Alterations in a will must be executed and attested as a will.
* A will speaks from the death of the testator, unless a contrary intention appear.
* An unattested document may be, if properly identified, incorporated in a will.

Rules of interpretation or construction depend chiefly on decisions of the courts, to a smaller extent on statutory enactment. The law was gradually brought into its present condition through precedents extending back for centuries, especially decisions of the court of chancery, the court par excellence of construction, as distinguished from the court of probate. The court of probate did not deal unless incidentally with the meaning of the will; its jurisdiction was confined to seeing that it was duly executed. The present state of the law of interpretation is highly technical. Some phrases have obtained a conventional meaning which the testators who used them probably did not dream of. Many of the judicial doctrines which had gradually become established were altered by the Wills Act 1837.

Rules of interpretation founded on principles of equity independent of statute are very numerous. Some of the more important, stated in as general a form as possible, are these:
*The intention of the testator is to be observed. This rule is called by Sir Edward Coke the pole star to guide the judges.
*There is a presumption against intestacy, against double portions, against constructing merely precatory words to import a trust, etc.
*One part of the will is to be expounded by another.
*Interlineations and alterations are presumed to have been made after, not as in deeds before, execution.
*Words are supposed to be used in their strict and primary sense. Many words and phrases, however, such as &quot;money,&quot; &quot;residue,&quot; and &quot;issue&quot; and other words of relationship, have become invested with a technical meaning, but there has been a recent tendency to include illegitimate children in a gift to &quot;children.&quot;
*Evidence is admissible in certain cases to explain latent ambiguity, and parol evidence of the terms of a lost will may be given as in the famous case of &quot;Sugden v. Lord St Leonards&quot; (1876), 1 Prob. Div. 154, relating to the lost will of Edward Sugden, 1st Baron St Leonards.

A will may be void, in whole or in part, for many reasons, which may be divided into two great classes, those arising from external circumstances and those arising from the will itself. The main examples of the former class are revocation by burning, tearing, etc., by a later will, or by marriage of the testator (except as below), incapacity of the testator from insanity, infancy or legal disability (such as being a convict), undue influence and fraud, any one of which is ground for the court to refuse or revoke probate of a will. A will being ambulatory is always revocable, unless in one or two exceptional instances. Undue influence is a ground upon which frequent attempts are made to set aside wills. Its nature is well explained in a judgment of Lord Penzance&#x27;s: &quot;Pressure of whatever character, whether acting on the fears or the hopes, if so exerted as to overpower the volition without convincing the judgment, is a species of restraint under which no valid will can be made.&quot; There is nothing corresponding to the &quot;querela inofficiosi testamenti&quot;, but unnatural provisions may be evidence of mental defect.

The circumstances appearing on the face of the will which make it open to objection may either avoid it altogether or create a partial intestacy, the will remaining good as a whole. Where the will is not duly executed, e.g. if it is a forgery or if it is not signed by the testator or the proper number of witnesses, the will is not admitted to probate at all. Where it contains devises or bequests bad in law, as in general restraint of marriage, or tending to create perpetuities, or contrary to public policy, or to some particular enactment, only the illegal part is void. A remarkable instance is a well-known case in which a condition subsequent in a devise was held void as against public policy, being a gift over of the estate devised in case the first devisee, the eldest son of an earl, did not before his death obtain the lapsed title of Duke of Bridgewater.

At common law there could be no larceny of a will of lands. But by the Larceny Act 1861 (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 96) stealing, injuring or concealing a will, whether of real or personal estate, was punishable with penal servitude for life. Forgery of a will (at one time a capital crime) rendered the offender liable to the same penalty. Fraudulent concealment of a will material to the title by a vendor or mortgagor of land or chattels is, by the Law of Property Amendment Act 1859 (22 &amp; 23 Vict. c. 35), a misdemeanour punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.

==History of wills in other jurisdictions==

===United States===
In the 21st century, eighteen is the typical age of testamentary capacity. Full liberty of disposition is not universal. In particular, many states normally grant spouses the right to at least half the estate regardless of what the will says (or if no will can be found). Some require that children cannot be disinherited without good cause. In many case, children omitted in a will may still take their share. Louisiana followed French law, by which the testator can under no circumstances alienate by will more than half his property if he leave issue or ascendants. In 1911, the husband&#x27;s consent was sometimes required for a married woman&#x27;s will to be valid, but this is no longer the case. Nuncupative and holographic wills are valid in some states, but are forbidden in others. The former are confined to personality and must generally be reduced to writing within a short time after the words are spoken. In Louisiana the mystic or sealed will still existed in 1911. The number of witnesses necessary for the validity of a will of any kind is usually two. Vermont, the last state to require three witnesses, changed its law in 2006. To be valid, witnesses must not be heirs under the will. In 1911, wills of soldiers and sailors were privileged, as in England.

In modern U.S. law, wills are not required to be registered prior to death in most states, but are registered and put in the public record after the person making the will dies and the estate is probated. However, it is often still a good idea to have the signing and witnessing of a will notarized, to reduce the risk of disputes over the will&#x27;s validity after death. Wills can be used to nominate guardians for minor children, but because children are not property, the will cannot have the final word on the question. Guardianship is decided by courts, though the usual outcome is that guardianship is awarded to the other surviving parent, or, if no parents survive, to the guardian nominated in the last surviving parent&#x27;s will.

===Scotland (in 1911)===
Up to 1868, wills of immovables were not allowed under Scots law. The usual means of obtaining disposition of heritage after death was a trust disposition and settlement by deed &quot;de praesenti&quot;, under which the truster disposed the property to trustees according to the trusts of the settlement, reserving a life interest. Thus something very similar to a testamentary disposition was secured by means resembling those employed in England before the Wills Act 1540 (32 Hen. 8. c. 1) of Henry VIII. The main disadvantage of the trust disposition was that it was liable to be overthrown by the heir, who could reduce &quot;ex capite lecti&quot; all voluntary deeds made to his prejudice within sixty days of the death of his ancestor. The Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868 (31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 101) made it competent to any owner of lands to settle the succession to the same in the event of death by testamentary or &quot;mortis causa&quot; deeds or writings. In 1871 &quot;reduction ex capite lecti&quot; was abolished by the Reductions Ex Capite Lecti Abolished Act 1871 (34 &amp; 35 Vict. c. 81). A will of immovables must be executed with the formalities of a deed and registered to give title. The disability of a woman as a witness was removed by the Titles to Land Consolidation (Scotland) Act 1868. As to wills of movables, there arc several important points in which they differ from corresponding wills in England, the influence of Roman law being more marked. Males may make a will at fourteen, females at twelve. A nuncupative legacy is good to the amount of £100 Scots (£8, 6s. 8d.), and a holograph testament is good without witnesses, but it must be signed by the testator, differing in this from the old English holograph. By the Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 94) such a will is presumed to have been executed on the date which it bears. Not all movables can be left, as in England. The movable property of the deceased is subject to &quot;jus relictae&quot; and &quot;legitime&quot;. See McLaren, &quot;Wills and Succession&quot;, for the law, and &quot;Judicial Styles&quot; for styles.

===France (as of 1911)===
The law is mainly contained in art. 967–1074 of the French Civil Code. Wills in France may be of three kinds:
#holograph, which must be wholly written, dated and signed by the testator;
#notarially executed, i.e. drawn up by two notaries and signed in presence of two witnesses or by one notary before four witnesses; this form of will must be dictated by the testator and drafted by the notary, must be read over to the testator in the presence of the witnesses, and must be signed by testator and witnesses;
#mystic, which are signed by the testator, then closed and sealed and delivered by him to a notary before six witnesses; the notary then draws up an account of the proceedings on the instrument which is signed by the testator, notary and witnesses.

Beneficiaries and their blood relations to the fourth degree may not be witnesses. Nuncupative wills are not recognized. Soldiers&#x27; and sailors&#x27; wills are subject to special rules as in most other countries. Full freedom of testation only exists when the testator has no ascendants or descendants, otherwise the disposable portion of his estate is constrained by the rules of forced heirship: if the testator has one child he may only dispose of half his estate, if two only one-third, if three or more only one-fourth; if he has no descendants but ascendants in both lines he may dispose of half, if ascendants in one line only he may dispose of three-fourths. The full age of testamentary capacity is 21 years, but minors over the age of 16 may dispose by will of half of the estate of which they could dispose had they been of full age. There is no restriction against married women making wills. Will substitutes such as will contracts or a &quot;pactum successorium&quot; (aka contract concerning succession) are invalid (art. 791 FrCC).

The civil codes of southern continental Europe are in general accordance with French law.

===Germany (in 1911)===
Most of the law will be found in the German Civil Code, ss. 2064–2273. A holograph will, either single or joint, is allowed. Other wills must be notarially executed, declared before a judge, or (if outside Germany) a consul. Two witnesses are required, unless the witness is a notary or a clerk of court (court registrar), any of whom will suffice. The formalities may be relaxed in certain cases, such as imminent death, a state of siege, a prevailing epidemic, etc. Freedom of testation is constrained by the rules of forced heirship: descendants, ascendants, and the spouse are all entitled to forced shares (aka legal right shares). Forced heirs may only be disinherited for certain specified kinds of misconduct. Will contracts are invalid; however, a &quot;pactum successorium&quot; (aka contract concerning succession) made &quot;inter vivos&quot; is valid in certain cases and will operate on the death of the deceased. The two main types of &quot;pacta successoria&quot; are the contractual disclaimer of interest (&quot;Erbverzichtvertrag&quot;) and deed of variation (&quot;Erbauskaufvertrag&quot;). Revoking a will works much the same as in England, except with respect to marriage. One particular form of revocation in Germany occurs when a will is found to be inconsistent with a &quot;pactum successorium&quot;; in such an event the will is wholly or &quot;pro tanto&quot; revoked.

===International law===
There are three main directions which the opinion of jurists and the practice of courts have taken, as of 1911:
#The whole property of the testator may be subjected to the law of his domicile. To this effect is the opinion of Savigny and the German practice. Certain modifications have been made by modern law, especially by the &quot;Einführungsgesetz&quot; of 1896.
#The property may be subjected to the law of the place where it happens to be at the time of the testator&#x27;s death.
#The movable property may be subjected to the law of the domicile. The immovable (including leaseholds) to the law of the place where it is situated, the &quot;lex loci rei sitae&quot;. England and the United States follow this rule.


Testamentary capacity is generally governed by the law of the testator&#x27;s domicile at the time of his death, the form of the instrument in most countries either by the law of his domicile or the law of the place where the will was made, at his option. The old rule of English law was to allow the former alternative only. The law was altered for the United Kingdom in 1861 by the &#x27; (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 114) (also known as Lord Kingsdown&#x27;s Act), by which a will made out of the United Kingdom by a British subject is, as far as regards personal estate, good if made according to the forms required by the law of the place where it was made, or by the law of the testator&#x27;s domicile at the time of making it, or by the law of the place of his domicile of origin. Subsequent change of domicile does not avoid such a will. Another act passed on the same day, the &#x27; (24 &amp; 25 Vict. c. 121), enacted that by convention with any foreign government foreign domicile with regard to wills could not be acquired by a testator without a year&#x27;s residence and a written declaration of intention to become domiciled. By the same act foreign consuls may by convention have certain authority over the wills and property of subjects of foreign states dying in England.

In the United States some states have adopted the narrow policy of enacting by statute the old common law rule, and providing that no will is valid unless made in the form required by the law of the state of the testator&#x27;s domicile. The capacity of the testator, revocation and construction of a will, are governed by the law of the domicile of the testator at the time of his death—except in cases affected by Lord Kingsdown&#x27;s Act, as he must be supposed to have used language in consonance with that law, unless indeed he express himself in technical language of another country. A good instance is Groos&#x27; Case (1904), Prob. 269, where it was held that the will of a Dutch woman (at the time of her death domiciled in England) duly made in Holland was not revoked by her marriage, that being no ground of revocation by the law of Holland.

The persons who are to take under a will are decided by different rules according as the property is movable or immovable, the former being governed by the law of the domicile, the latter by the &quot;lex loci rei sitae&quot;. It was held, however, in 1881 by the court of appeal in England that, under the will of an Englishman domiciled in Holland, leaving personal property to children, children legitimated &quot;per subsequens matrimonium&quot; could take, as they were legitimate by the law of Holland, though not by the law of England (re Goodman&#x27;s Trusts, 17 Ch. D. 266). This principle was carried further in re Grey&#x27;s Trusts (1892), 3 Ch. 88, where it was held that a legitimated child was entitled to share in a devise of English realty. But it is to be noted that a person born out of lawful wedlock, though legitimated, could not succeed as heir to real estate in England (&quot;Birtwhistle v. Vardill&quot;, 2 Cl. and F. 895). A will duly executed abroad is generally required to be clothed with the authority of a court of the country where any property affected by the will is situate.

<text>The 33rd Infantry Division was a formation of the U.S. Army National Guard between 1917 and 1968. Originally formed for service during World War I, the division fought along the Western Front during the Battle of Amiens, the Battle of Hamel, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, at the Second Battle of the Somme, and at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel. It was re-formed during the inter-war period, and then later activated for service during World War II, seeing action against the Imperial Japanese Army in the Pacific. In the post war era, the division was reconstituted as an all-Illinois National Guard division. In the late 1960s, the division was reduced to a brigade-sized formation, and its lineage is currently perpetuated by the 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team.

=== Involvement ===
The 33rd Division served in World War I and beyond. The division was trained at Camp Logan in Houston, Texas as part of the National state guard in Illinois. The first unit went to France in 1918. The first unit to go into France was the 108th Engineers, under Colonel Henry A. Allen.

During World War I, the 33rd Division&#x27;s officers included Second Lieutenant John Allan Wyeth, who has been called the only American poet of the Great War who can stand up to comparison with British war poets Siegfried Sassoon and Wilfred Owen. Wyeth later immortalized his war experiences with the 33rd U.S. Division in the 1928 sonnet sequence &quot;This Man&#x27;s Army: A War in Fifty-Odd Sonnets&quot;.

On 20 and 21 June the division went to the Amiens sector, where there was expected to be a major German attack. The division was trained by British Army and Commonwealth soldiers – in particular the Australian Corps – and was part of some of their operations.

The first major battle in which elements of the 33rd Division took part was the Battle of Hamel on 4 July. Individual platoons from four companies from the 131st Infantry and 132nd Infantry were distributed among Australian battalions, to gain combat experience. This, however, occurred without official approval as there was controversy regarding the battlefield command of US troops by junior officers from other countries. Thus, while Hamel was a relatively minor battle by the standards of World War I, it was historically significant as the first occasion on which US Army personnel had fought alongside British Empire forces, and demonstrated that the previously inexperienced American troops could play an effective role in the war. The battle was also historically significant for the use of innovative assault tactics, devised by the Australian General John Monash, were demonstrated.

The 33rd Division was in reserve behind the British Fourth Army at the opening of the August offensive for emergencies only. With the British III Corps attack stalling at Chipilly Ridge during the Battle of Amiens, the 131st Regiment of the 33rd Division was sent to assist on 9 August, which it did with distinction. The following day the Regiment was attached to the 4th Australian Division and remained there until 12 August. From 12 August until 20 August it was combined with the 13th Australian Brigade in what was called the Liaison Force commanded by Brigadier General E. A. Wisdom. This was designed to hold the front from the Somme to the Bray-Sur-Somme to Corbie road to relieve the 4th Australian Division from the operation. After this it returned to the 33rd US Division.

On 23 August, the division was moved to the Toul sector. The 33rd Division fought in the Meuse-Argonne Campaign from 26 September 1918 to the end of the battle on 10 November 1918. The last mission in which the 33rd Division took part was on 27 December 1918.

In total, from the 33rd arriving in France to the German armistice on 11 November 1918, the division captured 13 units of heavy artillery and 87 pieces of light artillery. Also, they captured 460 machine guns and 430 light guns. In total, the entire division gained 40,300 meters of land in World War I. The 33rd Division was the only unit in the war to have machine gun barrage enemy nests while infantry turned the position. In total, the 33rd Division received 215 American decorations, 56 British decorations, and various others.

As result of its World War I service, the division remains the only US Army division that has fought as part of British Army and French Army corps.

===Order of battle===

In 1918, the 33rd Division was organized as follows:

* Headquarters, 33rd Division
* 65th Infantry Brigade
** 129th Infantry Regiment
** 130th Infantry Regiment

==Interwar Years==

The 33rd Division headquarters arrived at Hoboken, New Jersey, aboard the USS Mount Vernon on 17 May 1919 after 12 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 6 June 1919 at Camp Grant. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the state of Illinois and assigned to the VI Corps in 1921. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 13 December 1923 at 115 East Ontario Street, in Chicago. Most elements of the division were concentrated in the northern part of the state in and around Chicago. Each company of the 108th Engineer Regiment was sponsored by a major Illinois industrial or transportation concern: Company A by the Peoples Gas, Light, and Coke Company, Company B by Commonwealth Edison, Company C by the Elevated Railroad, Company D by the Illinois Central Railroad, Company E by the International Harvester Company, and Company F by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad. Regular Army officers were detailed to act as instructors for the 33rd, supervising National Guard officers who conducted the usual training. One of these officers was Colonel George C. Marshall, who served as head instructor for the 33rd Division from 1933 to 1936.

The designated mobilization training center for the “Prairie Division” was initially Camp Grant, where much of the division’s training activities occurred between the wars. The mobilization training center for the division was changed to Fort Huachuca, Arizona, in the 1939 Protective Mobilization Plan. The division, less the 58th Field Artillery Brigade, conducted summer camp most years at Camp Grant from 1922 to 1939; the 58th Field Artillery Brigade conducted most of its camps in the 1920s at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, and Camp Knox, Kentucky, so that its subordinate battalions could conduct live-fire training at the ranges located there. For at least one year, in 1937, the division’s subordinate units trained over 170 company-grade officers of the 86th Division at Camp Grant and Camp McCoy. The division staff usually conducted command post exercises (CPXs) and staff training concurrent with the subordinate unit camps. However, in May 1932 the staff participated in the Sixth Corps Area CPX held at Camp Custer, Michigan, and in the corps area CPX held in Chicago in May 1936. Additionally, the division staff participated in the Second Army CPX in August 1938 held at Fort Knox. The division’s staff was generally acknowledged as one of the best in the National Guard and performed well in these CPXs. Much of the staff’s efficiency was attributed to George C. Marshall. For the 1936 camp, the division participated in the Sixth Corps Area phase of the Second Army maneuvers at Camp Custer. During that maneuver, the 33rd Division operated against the 32nd Division in a force-on-force exercise. The “Prairie Division” also participated in the Second Army maneuvers in 1940 held at Camp McCoy. The division was relieved from the VI Corps on 30 December 1940 and assigned to the VII Corps.

During its combat operations, divisions usually had various units attached in support of it and other organic units detached. Where those attachments and detachments are well-documented for the divisions that fought in the European Theater of Operations, documentation is poorer for those divisions which fought in the Pacific.

===Initial training===

The 33rd Division was inducted into federal service on 5 March 1941. Instead of Fort Huachuca, the division proceeded to Camp Forrest, near Tullahoma, Tennessee. Camp Forrest was formerly Camp Peay, a Tennessee National Guard facility that had been taken over by the War Department after the outbreak of World War II. In April 1941, Illinois draftees sent from Camp Grant and Fort Sheridan arrived to bring the 33rd Division to full strength. After completing basic training, the division was tested by VII Corps officials before being allowed to progress; the division achieved the best aggregate score of the VII Corps&#x27; three infantry divisions on these tests, performing better than either the 27th or 35th Infantry Divisions. In August 1941, the 33rd Division was redesignated as the 33rd Infantry Division. The 33rd Infantry Division and the rest of the VII Corps subsequently participated in the major Louisiana Maneuvers held in southern Arkansas and northern Louisiana in August and September, after which the division returned to Camp Forrest. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 7 December 1941, the 33rd Infantry Division was dispersed to guard major industrial plants, dams, and railroads in Alabama and Tennessee, being recalled to Camp Forrest after one month.

===Reorganization and further training===
The 132nd Infantry Regiment was detached from the division on 14 January 1942 for service in New Caledonia with the task force that would eventually form the Americal Division.

The 33rd Infantry Division was ordered to convert from the &quot;square&quot; to the &quot;triangular&quot; organization on 21 February 1942. The 65th and 66th Infantry Brigade headquarters and the 58th Field Artillery Brigade headquarters were inactivated. The 131st Infantry Regiment was detached for non-divisional service in the continental United States and sent to Fort Brady, near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, to guard the Soo Locks. The engineer, field artillery, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reduced to battalions; the 108th Engineer (Combat) Regiment was broken up and the headquarters, Headquarters and Service Company, and Companies A, B, and C became the 108th Engineer Combat Battalion, which remained with the division. The Headquarters, 1st Battalion was inactivated on 21 February 1942 and the 2nd Battalion became the 181st Engineer Battalion (Heavy Pontoon), an engineering unit.

To maintain the 33rd Infantry Division with three regiments, the 136th Infantry Regiment, originally a Minnesota National Guard unit inactive during the interwar period, was reconstituted in the Army of the United States, activated with new recruits and personnel transferred from elsewhere in the division, and assigned to the division on 1 April 1942. In 1942, three National Guard divisions, the 30th, 31st, and 33rd, became &quot;virtual pools&quot; for the Army Service Forces in the activation of new service units. In July 1942, 2,000 personnel from all arms and services were taken from the 33rd Infantry Division and sent to Camp Edwards, Massachusetts, to form the nucleus of the Engineer Amphibian Command and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Engineer Special Brigades that were being activated there.

On 31 July 1942, the regimental headquarters, auxiliary troops, and the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 129th Infantry were detached from the 33rd Infantry Division and were sent as a task force to the Pacific Theater. The regiment was later assigned to the 37th Infantry Division. The 1st Battalion remained behind to cadre a new regiment. As a result of these rapid personnel transfers. the division declined from a strength of 13,200 to only 8,400 in August 1942. The division was then promised immunity from further stripping, and was given priority on the receipt of trained filler replacements. The 123rd Infantry Regiment (unrelated in lineage to an earlier Alabama National Guard formation of the same designation that saw service in World War I as a part of the 31st Division) was constituted in the Army of the United States on 24 August 1942 and assigned to the division on 28 September.

In September, the 33rd Infantry Division was transferred to Fort Lewis, Washington and assigned to the IX Corps. In October, November, and December, filler replacements arrived at Fort Lewis to bring the 33rd Infantry Division to full strength once again. From March to June 1943, the division participated in maneuvers in the Desert Training Center, located in the Mojave Desert in Arizona and California. After the maneuvers, the 33rd Infantry Division received its port call and shipped out to Camp Stoneman, near Pittsburg, California.

===Action in the Pacific Theater===

The 33rd Infantry Division arrived in Hawaii on 12 July 1943. While guarding installations, it received training in jungle warfare. On 11 May 1944, it arrived in New Guinea where it received additional training. The 123rd Infantry Regiment arrived at Maffin Bay on 1 September, to provide perimeter defense around the Wakde Airdrome and in the Toem–Sarmi sector. The 123rd was relieved on 26 January 1945. Elements of the 33rd arrived at Morotai, on 18 December 1944 and landings were made on the west coast of the island on 22 December, without opposition and defensive perimeters were established. Aggressive patrols were sent out which encountered scattered resistance. The 33rd then landed at Lingayen Gulf, on Luzon, on 10 February 1945, and relieved the 43rd Infantry Division in the Damortis–Rosario Pozorrubio area, over the period 13–15 February. The division drove into the Caraballo Mountains on 19 February, toward its objective, Baguio, the summer capital of the Philippines and the headquarters of General Tomoyuki Yamashita.

Fighting against a fanatical enemy entrenched in the hills, the 33rd took Aringay on 7 March, Mount Calugong on 8 April, and Mount Mirador on 25 April. Baguio and Camp John Hay fell on 26 April, under the concerted attack of the 33rd and the 37th Infantry Divisions. Manuel Roxas, later President of the Philippines, was freed during the capture of Baguio, which was liberated by the 33rd and Filipino soldiers of the 66th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL on 27 April. After mopping up isolated pockets of Japanese troops, the division captured the San Nicholas–Tebbo–Itogon route on 12 May. All elements went to rest and rehabilitation areas on 30 June 1945. The division landed on Honshū Island, Japan, on 25 September, and then performed occupation duties until it was deactivated in early 1946.

===Casualties===

*Total battle casualties: 2,426
*Killed in action: 396
*Wounded in action: 2,024
*Missing in action: 5
*Prisoner of war: 1

==Post World War II==
The 33rd Infantry Division was reformed as an all-Illinois National Guard division on 7 November 1946. However, some of its former units were assigned to the 44th Infantry Division, which was also reorganized in the postwar Guard structure as an Illinois-based division.

By 1954, the division&#x27;s infantry and artillery units included the 129th, 130th, and 131st Infantry Regiments, and the 122nd, 123rd, 124th, and 210th Field Artillery Battalions. A number of National Guard divisions were deactivated in 1968, including the 33rd Infantry Division on 1 February 1968. However, in its place the 33rd Infantry Brigade was organised. On 1 February 1968, the 178th Infantry Regiment was reorganized to consist of the 1st Battalion, an element of the 33rd Infantry Brigade. The 33rd Infantry Brigade Combat Team carries on the division&#x27;s heritage, and circa 2010 was assigned to the 35th Infantry Division.

<text>82 G. Eridani (HD 20794, Gliese 139, e Eridani) is a star away from Earth in the constellation Eridanus. It is a main-sequence star with a stellar classification of G6 V, and it hosts a system of three confirmed planets and a dust disk.

==Observation==
In the southern-sky catalog &quot;Uranometria Argentina&quot;, 82 G. Eridani (often abbreviated to 82 Eridani) is the 82nd star listed in the constellation Eridanus. The Argentina catalog, compiled by the 19th-century astronomer Benjamin Gould, is a southern celestial hemisphere analog of the more famous Flamsteed catalog, and uses a similar numbering scheme. 82 G. Eridani, like other stars near the Sun, has held on to its Gould designation, even while other more distant stars have not.

==Properties==
82 G. Eridani is slightly smaller and less massive than the Sun, at around 80% of the Sun&#x27;s mass and 90% of the radius. It has a luminosity 30% fainter than the Sun&#x27;s. Spectroscopically, it is classified as G6V, compared to G2V for the Sun, and is among the nearest solar-type stars. The projected rotational velocity rate (&quot;v&quot; sin &quot;i&quot;) is smaller than 2 km/s, compatible with a slow-rotating or pole-on star relative to Earth. Such observation would also match the lack of a reliable rotational period detection and the absence of any magnetic cycle.

It is a high-velocity star—it is moving quickly compared to the average—and hence is probably a member of Population II, generally older stars whose motions take them well outside the plane of the Milky Way. Like many other Population II stars, 82 G. Eridani is somewhat metal-deficient (though much less deficient than many), and is older than the Sun. It has a relatively high orbital eccentricity of 0.42 about the galaxy, ranging between 3.52 and 8.41 kiloparsecs from the core. Its age is estimated at 5.76 billion years, based on its chromospheric activity indicator, but other estimates suggest ages close or higher to the age of the Universe.

This star is located in a region of low-density interstellar matter (ISM), so it is believed to have a large astropause that subtends an angle of 6″ across the sky. Relative to the Sun, this star is moving at a space velocity of 101 km/s, with the bow shock advancing at more than Mach 3 through the ISM.

== Planetary system ==

An infrared excess was discovered around the star by the Infrared Space Observatory at 60 μm, but was not later confirmed by the Spitzer Space Telescope, in 2006. However, in 2012, a dust disk was found around the star, by the Herschel Space Observatory. While not well-constrained, if assumed to have a similar composition to 61 Virginis&#x27; dust disk, it has a semi-major axis of 24 AU.

On August 17, 2011, European astronomers announced the discovery of three planets orbiting 82 G. Eridani. The mass range of these planets classifies them as super-Earths; objects with only a few times the Earth&#x27;s mass. These planets were discovered by precise measurements of the radial velocity of the star, with the planets revealing their presence by their gravitational displacement of the star during each orbit. None of the planets display a significant orbital eccentricity. However, their orbital periods are all 90 days or less, indicating that they are orbiting close to the host star. The equilibrium temperature for the most distant planet, based on an assumed Bond albedo of 0.3, would be about ; significantly above the boiling point of water.

At the time of planet c&#x27;s detection, it exerted the lowest gravitational perturbation. There was also a similarity noted between its orbital period and the rotational period of the star. For these reasons the discovery team were somewhat more cautious regarding the verity of its candidate planet status than for the other two. (Indeed this 40-day planet is no longer believed to exist and the &quot;c&quot; designation has been re-used.)

Using the TERRA algorithm, developed by Guillem Anglada-Escudé and R. Paul Butler in 2012, to describe better and filter out noise interference to extract more precise radial velocity measurements, a team of scientists led by Fabo Feng, in 2017, provided evidence for up to three more planets. One such candidate, of Neptune mass, 82 G. Eridani f, may orbit in the habitable zone of the star. The team also believe that, using these noise reduction techniques, they are able to better quantify the descriptions for the earlier 3 exoplanets, but only have weak evidence of 82 G. Eridani c.

A study in 2023 could only confirm planets b &amp; d, and did not significantly detect the other planet candidates. In particular, the statistical significance of planet c would be expected to increase with additional data; the fact that this has not happened casts doubt on its existence. The 40-day radial velocity signal may instead be tied to the stellar rotation. The additional three candidates found in 2017 (e, f, g) could not be confirmed or refuted. Another 2023 study also only confirmed b &amp; d out of the previous planet candidates (referring to them as b &amp; c), but also detected a potential third planet farther from the star than any of the previous candidates, on an eccentric orbit partially within the habitable zone. A 2024 study confirmed this habitable zone planet.



===Potential habitability of HD 20794 d===

On October 15, 2024, researchers at Oxford University announced that they had confirmed HD 20794 d, orbiting in the habitable zone of its star. In an article published in the journal &quot;Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&quot;, scientists said an analysis of 20 years of observational data had found HD 20794 d could be a rocky planet (though its composition is unknown and it could also be a mini-Neptune) and should be &quot;a high-priority target for future atmospheric characterization with direct imaging facilities.&quot;

About six times the mass of Earth, the planet orbits &quot;at the right distance from its star to sustain liquid water on its surface — a key ingredient for life as we know it.&quot; However, HD 20794 d&#x27;s orbit is significantly elliptical, meaning it spends part of its year outside the habitable zone. Data for the research was gathered at the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrograph at La Silla Observatory in Chile. With the discovery, HD 20794 d became the 12th-closest potentially habitable planet to Earth.

==Planned observation missions==
82 G. Eridani (GJ 139) was picked as a Tier 1 target star for NASA&#x27;s proposed Space Interferometry Mission (SIM) mission to search for terrestrial-sized or larger planets, which was cancelled in 2010.

<text>107 Piscium is a single star in the constellation of Pisces. &quot;107 Piscium&quot; is the star&#x27;s Flamsteed designation. John Flamsteed numbered the stars of Pisces from 1 to 113, publishing his &quot;Catalogus Britannicus&quot; in 1725. He accidentally numbered 107 Piscium twice, as he also allocated it the designation of 2 Arietis. This star is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude that has been measured varying between 5.14 and 5.26. However, that finding of variation was not confirmed by subsequent observations and is most likely spurious data. It is located at a distance of about away from the Sun. 107 Piscium is drifting closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of −33.6, and is predicted to come as close as in around 135,800 years.

This object is a K-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of K1V, indicating it is generating energy from core hydrogen fusion. It is somewhat older than the Sun—approximately 6 billion years old. The star has 86% of the mass and 82% of the radius of the Sun, but shines with only 46% of the Sun&#x27;s luminosity. The effective temperature of the star is . It is rotating slowly with a period of . The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium—the star&#x27;s metallicity—is slightly lower than that of the Sun. The level of chromospheric activity is similar to the Sun, and it shows a simple cycle of variation.

107 Piscium has been examined for the presence of an infrared excess caused by exozodiacal dust, but none was detected. The habitable zone for this star, defined as the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet, is at a radius of 0.52– (AU), where is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.

In 1997, based on data collected during the Hipparcos mission, the star was categorized as an astrometric binary with a period of . However, this result has not been not confirmed.

<doc id="932775" wikidata="Q142696" url="?curid=932775" title="British Virgin Islands at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>The British Virgin Islands competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixth appearance at the Summer Olympics since its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The British Virgin Islands delegation included only one athlete, meaning the country, along with Brunei and Liechtenstein, sent the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games. The athlete selected was sprinter Dion Crabbe, an athlete who qualified for the Olympics by meeting the &quot;A&quot; standard time required for his event, the men&#x27;s 200 meters. Crabbe was also selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. He did not progress beyond the heats, meaning the British Virgin Islands won no medals at this Summer Olympics.

==Background==
The British Virgin Islands participated in six Summer Olympic games between its debut in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, United States and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. The British Virgin Islands National Olympic Committee (NOC) selected one athlete to represent the country, Dion Crabbe, as he had qualified for the men&#x27;s 200 meters after meeting the &quot;A&quot; standard required for the event. Sending only one athlete to the Athens Games meant that the country, along with Brunei and Liechtenstein, sent the lowest number of athletes to the 2004 Summer Games. Crabbe was also selected as flag bearer for the opening ceremony. Two officials represented the country, including chef de mission Dean Greenaway.

==Athletics ==

Making his Summer Olympic debut, Dion Crabbe qualified for the men&#x27;s 200 meters, after his best time, 20.30 seconds in 2002, was 0.29 seconds faster than the &quot;A&quot; standard required. He was also notable for holding the British Virgin Islands flag at the opening ceremony. He competed on 24 August in the Men&#x27;s 200 meters against seven other athletes in the fifth heat. He ran a time of 20.85 seconds, finishing sixth. He ranked ahead of Malaysia&#x27;s Nazmizan Muhammad (21.24 seconds) and behind Czech Republic&#x27;s Jirí Vojtík (20.79 seconds), in a heat led by Bahamas&#x27; Dominic Demeritte (20.62 seconds). Overall, Crabbe placed 33rd out of the 55 athletes that competed and was 0.07 seconds behind the slowest athlete that progressed to the next round. Therefore, that was the end of his competition.

<doc id="932784" wikidata="Q93122" url="?curid=932784" title="Christopher Strachey">
<text>Christopher S. Strachey (; 16 November 1916 – 18 May 1975) was a British computer scientist. He was one of the founders of denotational semantics, and a pioneer in programming language design and computer time-sharing. He has also been credited as possibly being the first developer of a video game and for coining terms such as polymorphism and referential transparency that are still widely used by developers today. He was a member of the Strachey family, prominent in government, arts, administration, and academia.

==Early life and education==
Christopher Strachey was born on 16 November 1916 to Oliver Strachey and Rachel (Ray) Costelloe in Hampstead, England. Oliver Strachey was the son of Richard Strachey and the great-grandson of Sir Henry Strachey, 1st Baronet. His elder sister was the writer Barbara Strachey. In 1919, the family moved to 51 Gordon Square. The Stracheys belonged to the Bloomsbury Group whose members included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes and Strachey&#x27;s uncle Lytton Strachey. At 13, Strachey went to Gresham&#x27;s School, Holt where he showed signs of brilliance but in general performed poorly. He was admitted to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (the same college as Alan Turing) in 1935 where he continued to neglect his studies. Strachey studied mathematics and then transferred to physics. At the end of his third year at Cambridge, Strachey suffered a nervous breakdown, possibly related to coming to terms with his homosexuality. He returned to Cambridge but managed only a &quot;lower second&quot; in the Natural Sciences Tripos.

==Career==
Unable to continue his education, Strachey joined Standard Telephones and Cables (STC) as a research physicist. His first job was providing mathematical analysis for the design of electron tubes used in radar. The complexity of the calculations required the use of a differential analyser. This initial experience with a computing machine sparked Strachey&#x27;s interest and he began to research the topic. An application for a research degree at the University of Cambridge was rejected and Strachey continued to work at STC throughout the Second World War. After the war he fulfilled a long-standing ambition by becoming a schoolmaster at St Edmund&#x27;s School, Canterbury, teaching mathematics and physics. Three years later he was able to move to the more prestigious Harrow School in 1949, where he stayed for three years.

In January 1951, a friend introduced him to Mike Woodger of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL). The lab had successfully built a reduced version of Alan Turing&#x27;s Automatic Computing Engine (ACE) the concept of which dated from 1945: the Pilot ACE. In his spare time, Strachey developed a preliminary version of a program for the game of draughts (&quot;checkers&quot; in American English) in May 1951. This may have been the first video game. The game completely exhausted the Pilot ACE&#x27;s memory. The draughts program failed due to program errors when it first ran at NPL on 30 July 1951. When Strachey heard about the Manchester Mark 1, which had a much bigger memory, he asked his former fellow-student Alan Turing for the manual and transcribed his program into the operation codes of that machine by around October 1951. By the summer of 1952, the program could &quot;play a complete game of Draughts at a reasonable speed&quot;. While he did not give this game a name, Noah Wardrip-Fruin named it &quot;M. U. C. Draughts.&quot;

Strachey programmed the first Computer music in England – the earliest recording of music played by a computer: a rendition of the British National Anthem &quot;God Save the King&quot; on the University of Manchester&#x27;s Ferranti Mark 1 computer, in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces were recorded there by a BBC outside broadcasting unit: &quot;God Save the King&quot;, &quot;Baa, Baa, Black Sheep&quot;, and &quot;In the Mood&quot;. Researchers at the University of Canterbury, Christchurch restored the acetate master disc in 2016 and the results may be heard on SoundCloud.

During the summer of 1952, Strachey programmed a love letter generator for the Ferranti Mark 1 that is known as the first example of computer-generated literature.

In May 1952, Strachey gave a two-part talk on &quot;the study of control in animals and machines&quot; (&quot;cybernetics&quot;) for the BBC Home Service&#x27;s &quot;Science Survey&quot; programme.

Strachey worked for the National Research Development Corporation (NRDC) from 1952 to 1959. While working on the St. Lawrence Seaway project, he was able to visit several computer centres in the United States and catalogue their instruction sets. Later, he worked on programming both the Elliott 401 computer and the Ferranti Pegasus computer. Together with Donald B. Gillies, he filed three patents in computing design including the design of base registers for program relocation. He also worked on the analysis of vibration in aircraft, working briefly with Roger Penrose.

In 1959, Strachey left NRDC to become a computer consultant working for NRDC, EMI, Ferranti and other organisations on several wide-ranging projects. This work included logical design for computers, providing autocode and later the design of high-level programming languages. For a contract to produce the autocode for the Ferranti Orion computer, Strachey hired Peter Landin who became his one assistant for the duration of Strachey&#x27;s consulting period.

Strachey developed the concept of time-sharing in 1959. He filed a patent application in February that year and gave a paper &quot;Time Sharing in Large Fast Computers&quot; at the inaugural UNESCO Information Processing Conference in Paris where he passed the concept on to J. C. R. Licklider. This paper is credited by the MIT Computation Center in 1963 as &quot;the first paper on time-shared computers&quot;.

In 1962, while remaining a consultant, he accepted a position at the University of Cambridge.

In 1965, Strachey accepted a position at the University of Oxford as the first director of the Programming Research Group and later the university&#x27;s first professor of computer science and fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford. He collaborated with Dana Scott.

Strachey was elected as a distinguished fellow of the British Computer Society in 1971 for his pioneering work in computer science.

In 1973, Strachey (along with Robert Milne) began to write an essay submitted to the Adams Prize competition, after which they continued work to revising it into book form. Strachey can be seen and heard in the recorded Lighthill debate on AI (see Lighthill report).

He developed the Combined Programming Language (CPL). His influential set of lecture notes &quot;Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages&quot; formalised the distinction between L- and R- values (as seen in the C programming language). Strachey also coined the term &quot;currying&quot;, although he did not invent the underlying concept.

He was instrumental in the design of the Ferranti Pegasus computer.

The macro language m4 derives much from Strachey&#x27;s GPM (General Purpose Macrogenerator), one of the earliest macro expansion languages.

Strachey contracted an illness diagnosed as jaundice which, after a period of seeming recovery, returned and he died of infectious hepatitis on 18 May 1975. After his death, Strachey was succeeded by Sir Tony Hoare as Head of the Programming Research Group at Oxford, starting in 1977.

==Legacy==
The Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford has a Christopher Strachey Professorship of Computing, which has been held by the following:

* Sir Tony Hoare FRS (1988–2000)
* Samson Abramsky FRS (2000–2021)
* Nobuko Yoshida (2022 onwards)

In November 2016, a &quot;Strachey 100&quot; event was held at Oxford University to celebrate the centenary of Strachey&#x27;s birth, including a viewing at the Weston Library in Oxford of the Christopher Strachey archive held in the Bodleian Library collection.

<text>Joe Soucheray is a radio talk-show host and newspaper columnist. He produces his podcast &quot;Garage Logic&quot; from studios in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

==Early life==

Soucheray was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota in 1949. He attended St. Luke&#x27;s as a grade schooler, Hill High School (now Hill-Murray School), and graduated from the college at University of St. Thomas in 1971.

==Newspaper career==

Soucheray entered the media as a sports journalist, beginning work as a sports reporter for the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; in 1973. He joined the Saint Paul Pioneer Press in 1984 as a local columnist. He is the author of 10 books.

* Walter Payton - published 1980

==Early radio career==

In 1980, Soucheray entered the radio business, co-hosting &quot;Monday Night Sports Talk&quot; on KSTP radio with then-&quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; sports columnist Patrick Reusse. 

The show was known for its cast of callers doing impressions of various celebrities, in and out of the sports world, of widely varying quality - and, very occasionally, discussion about sports.

The lack of actual sports content on &quot;MNST&quot; was a running gag between Soucheray, Reusse and the audience.

The show aired until the early nineties, until Soucheray began his daily &quot;Garage Logic&quot; program. The &quot;Sports Talk&quot; brand lived on in the duo&#x27;s weekend show, &quot;Saturday Morning Sports Talk&quot; and has continued with the weekday version of &quot;Sports Talk&quot; which began airing on Monday, February 15, 2010. The pair claim it is the &quot;longest-running sports talk show in history.&quot;

==&quot;Garage Logic&quot;==

Soucheray began hosting his daily &quot;Garage Logic&quot; drive-time radio show on KSTP on April 29, 1993. In it, Soucheray acts as the mayor of a mythical town bearing the same name as the radio show: Garage Logic, county seat of Gumption County. The motivating idea is to promote traditional values and is a sort of criticism of modern American pop culture and Minnesota&#x27;s dominant liberal culture. Soucheray prefers to stick with the less philosophical slogan &quot;Anything that needs to be figured out can be figured out in the garage.&quot;

Soucheray has been joined on the air by producer Matt &quot;The Rookie&quot; Michalski since the late 1990s. Rookie is the voice behind many skits and imitations on &quot;Garage Logic&quot; and &quot;Saturday Morning Sports Talk&quot;. Rookie was often held to mythical 6:00 pm meetings with Soucheray, after the conclusion of the show, if he angered Soucheray&#x27;s character by not paying attention. More often, Soucheray could be heard asking Rookie if he actually listens to the show that he is producing.

The program has occupied several time slots during its run as the station&#x27;s other programming has shifted, but for over a decade it, along with Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s program, was part of a combination that made KSTP the dominant talk station in the market. With Limbaugh&#x27;s departure from the station in 2006, Soucheray became KSTP&#x27;s sole marquee talent.

After twenty-five years on the air, KSTP officially sunset Garage Logic as a radio show with the final radio broadcast airing on September 7, 2018.“I knew the end of radio was coming. The ratings systems are terribly unkind to talk radio. I knew we had more listeners than they said. I’d be in Germany and random people would come up to me and say, ‘Hail, flashlight king’… Podcasting has corroborated those instincts.”Garage Logic relaunched as a podcast three days later. It quickly exploded in popularity, &quot;reaching 28,000+ downloads per daily episode, to 245,000 unique devices per month. It’s Hubbard’s most listened to local podcast.&quot; On November 4th 2024, Garage Logic returned to its daily live broadcasting roots by broadcasting everyday on YouTube at Noon Central. The podcast is also financed by Hubbard Broadcasting, the owners of KSTP-AM. The Garage Logic Podcast can be found by downloading the PodMN app, on Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. It can also be found on www.GarageLogic.com.

<text>Chi1 Orionis (χ1 Ori, χ1 Orionis) is a star about 28 light years away. It is in the constellation Orion, where it can be seen in the tip of the hunter&#x27;s upraised club.
χ1 Ori is a G0V star. It is listed in the General Catalog of Variable Stars as an RS Canum Venaticorum variable, varying between visual magnitude 4.38 and 4.41. Stępień and Geyer measured its period to be 5.5 days.

χ1 Ori has a faint companion with a mass estimated at 15% of the mass of the Sun, and an orbital period of 14.1 years. The companion orbits an average distance of 6.1 AU from the primary, but has a fairly high orbital eccentricity, ranging from 3.3 AU out to 8.9 AU from the primary. Because of this red dwarf companion, the likelihood of habitable planets in this system is low. It is thought that the companion is a red dwarf still contracting towards the main sequence.

A necessary condition for the existence of a planet in this system are stable zones where the object can remain in orbit for long intervals. For hypothetical planets in a circular orbit around the individual members of this star system, this maximum orbital radius is computed to be 1.01 AU for the primary and 0.41 AU for the secondary. (Note that the orbit of the Earth is 1 AU from the Sun.) A planet orbiting outside of both stars would need to be at least 18.4 AU distant.

χ1 Ori is a candidate stream star member of the Ursa Major Moving Group, although there is some evidence to the contrary.

<text>Elkwater is an unincorporated community at the western edge of the Cypress Hills in southeastern Alberta, Canada, southeast of Medicine Hat. The main access route is via Alberta Highway 41 (Buffalo Trail), which leads south from the Trans-Canada Highway (Alberta Highway 1).

The former hamlet is located within Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park on the southern shore of Elkwater Lake and consists mostly of a collection of cabins. Its name is a translation of &quot;Ponokiokwe&quot;, the Blackfoot name for the lake.

== Flora and fauna ==
The Elkwater townsite lies at an elevation of about 1,225 m (4,025 ft) on the northwest slope of the Cypress Hills which, with a summit at 1,466 m (4810 ft), are the highest point between the Rocky Mountains and Labrador within Canada. Because of the elevation, the area receives more moisture than the surrounding plains. Forests of lodgepole pine, white spruce, and aspen cover the north-facing slopes above the town. Large animals include mule deer, white-tailed deer, coyote, elk, cougar, and moose, and many types of birds. Moose and wild turkeys were introduced to the area and are not native. Furthermore, there is a large lake that has northern pike and yellow perch. Nearby lakes such as Reesor Lake also have fishing available. Sport fishing Licenses are available online or can be acquired from the Elkwater Visitor Centre.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Elkwater had a population of 83 living in 48 of its 228 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 84. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

As a designated place in the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Elkwater had a population of 84 living in 40 of its 260 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2011 population of 50. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016.

== Administration ==
Since the Elkwater townsite is in a provincial park, it is administered by the provincial government. Residents can never own the land on which their cottages or homes are built and leases must be negotiated with the provincial government.

== Accommodation ==
Elkwater has one hotel, the Elkwater Lake Lodge &amp; Resort, which features condos, cabins, and suites.

There are 7 campgrounds near the townsite with approximately 450 campsites. They are:

* Elkwater (Main)
* Lakeview
* Old Baldy
* Beaver Creek 
* Ferguson Hill
* Lodgepole
* Firerock

To the east of Elkwater, camping can be found at Spruce Coulee and Reesor Lake. Closer to the Saskatchewan border, you will find Battle Creek campground. Four group camp sites are also available to rent.

Elkwater also has bed-and-breakfast and other accommodations at the Bar-Zee Bed &amp; Breakfast, located north of the park.

== Other services and facilities ==
Services and facilities include a convenience store, gas station, cafe, restaurant, visitor centre, ski hill, 9-hole golf course and a marina. Park administration offices for the Alberta section of the park are also located here.

== Climate ==
Elkwater experiences a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfc&quot;) that falls just short of the boundary with the humid continental climate zone (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). Winters are long and cold, while summers are short and warm. Precipitation is moderate, with an annual average of 529mm.

It lies in the transition zone between the Elbe Sandstone Mountains in the north and the Central Bohemian Uplands in the south. The highest point is a contour line on the slopes of Děčínský Sněžník at above sea level.

The city proper lies at the confluence of the rivers Elbe and Ploučnice. Most of the built-up area is situated in the river valley with an elevation of , which makes it the lowest city in the country. The entire area of the city falls into protected landscape areas České středohoří and Labské pískovce.

==History==
According to archaeological discoveries, the settlement of the area began at the La Tène times. Slavic settlement can be documented since the 7th century. The first written mention of Děčín is from 993, when the Děčín province existed and it is assumed that Děčín was its administrative centre. Děčín was founded at the ford over the Elbe in the places where the trade route led. The Přemyslid dukes of Bohemia had a gord built for the protection of the waterway. The gord was replaced by a stone castle in the first half of the 13th century. In the second half of the 13th century, King Ottokar II founded a new royal city under the castle.

The Lords of Wartenberg acquired Děčín in 1305. They made the city their family seat, but had to sell it due to debts. From 1511 to 1515, the estate was owned by Mikuláš Trčka of Lípa, who then sold it to the Salhausen family. In 1534, Knights of Bünau purchased the estate. They had rebuilt a part of the castle into a comfortable Renaissance residence. During their rule, the city experienced rapid development. Trade, transport on the Elbe and handicrafts flourished. Stone quarries, a lime factory and a brickyard were established.

The Knights of Bünau introduced Protestantism to the region, however the Protestant belief was suppressed by the Habsburg kings in the course of the Counter-Reformation, and the Bünaus were driven out upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain. In 1628, they sold the estate to the Thun und Hohenstein family. This family owned Děčín until 1918. The city suffered during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. In 1631 it was occupied by the Saxons and in 1639 and 1648 it was conquered by the Swedish army. As a result of the war, Děčín turned into a small insignificant town.

In the 1768, a spring of mineral water was discovered in the nearby village of Horní Žleb (today part of Děčín). Count Johann Joseph Thun founded here a small spa in 1777. The spa prospered and the Thun family built additional infrastructure. Due to the development of industry and traffic, which brought noise to the area, the spa began to decline, and in 1906 the Thuns sold it. In 1922, the spa was finally closed.

A new development of Děčín took place in the 18th century. The biggest impetus to the development of industry was the construction of a railway from Prague to Dresden in 1851. Děčín on the left bank of the Elbe and the village of Podmokly () on the right bank became an important transport hubs. The growth of industry triggered the construction of apartments and an influx of residents. Between 1890 and 1914, population of Podmokly raised to 20,000 inhabitants. Podmokly was promoted to a town in 1901.

Following World War I, since 1918, the area was part of Czechoslovakia. Upon the 1938 Munich Agreement, both towns were annexed by Nazi Germany and incorporated into the Reichsgau Sudetenland. Under German occupation, a Gestapo prison and a forced labour camp were located in the city. After the war, the ethnic German population was expelled under terms of the 1945 Potsdam Agreement and the Beneš decrees. Both towns were merged in 1942. After 1945, the neighbouring municipalities gradually also merged with Děčín.

Děčín was badly hit by the 2002 European flood.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest employer based in Děčín is ČEZ Distribuce, a part of ČEZ Group engaged in the distribution of electricity. The largest industrial companies are Constellium Extrusions Děčín, a manufacturer of aluminium products, and Chart Ferox, a manufacturer of gas storage systems.

Tourism is a significant part of the city&#x27;s economy. The city benefits from its location in protected landscape areas and the proximity of the Bohemian Switzerland National Park.

==Transport==
Děčín is a significant junction of land, rail and water transport, situated near an important Czech-German border crossing. The city is located at the intersection of roads I/13 (from Teplice to Liberec) and I/62 (from Ústí nad Labem to the Czech-German border), which are parts of the European route E442).

Děčín main railway station is located on one of the most important Czech railway lines, which leads from Prague to Děčín via Ústí nad Labem, and continues to Dresden, Berlin, Hamburg and Kiel. Other lines that lead from or through the city are Ústí nad Labem–Liberec, Děčín–Kadaň, and Děčín–Rumburk.

There are two public river ports.

==Sights==

===Děčín Castle===

Děčín Castle is one of the most popular sights in the region. It is located on a hill near the city centre and overlooks the Elbe. Not later than in 1128, it was constructed as a wooden fortress, and replaced by a royal stone castle in the 13th century. In the 16th century, a grand Renaissance palace was constructed on the site, to be renovated in the Baroque style from the 17th century onward.

From 1628, the castle served as the administrative centre of the Thun und Hohenstein family. They built an unusual feature of the castle – the long, straight-walled road leading up to it, known as the &quot;Long Ride&quot; (&quot;Dlouhá jízda&quot;). The last major renovation was completed in 1803. In 1835, Frédéric Chopin wrote his &quot;Waltz in A-flat major, Op. 34 No. 1&quot; here.

In 1932, financial problems forced the Thun und Hohenstein family to sell the castle to the Czechoslovak state. It served as army barracks, then it was appropriated by occupying Germans as a military garrison during World War II. Lastly, it was occupied by Soviet troops, who invaded from the east and rousted the Germans.

The Soviet Army departed in 1991, leaving the castle in a state of disrepair. In 2005, the government completed a restoration of a large part of the castle and opened it as a museum and venue for private gatherings and public events.

===Sacral monuments===

The Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross is one of the most important monuments of the city. It was built in the early Baroque style in 1687–1691 by the Thun und Hohenstein family as a castle church. A covered corridor on pillared arcades connects the church with the castle. The Chapel of Our Lady of the Snows adjoins the church from the south side.

The Church of Saints Wenceslaus and Blaise was built in the Baroque style in 1754–1778. It replaced a church destroyed by a fire in 1749.

The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Děčín-Podmokly is a neo-Romanesque building. It was built in 1856–1858. The interior was painted by Joseph von Führich.

The Evangelical church in Děčín-Podmokly was built in 1881–1884. It is a three-nave eclectic building.

The Church of Saint Wenceslaus is located in Děčín-Rozbělesy. Built in 1723–1783, it was designed by Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer.

The synagogue in Děčín-Podmokly was built in 1906–1907 in a faux Oriental style with Art Nouveau elements. During World War II, it lost its function and served as a warehouse. In 1994, it was returned to the local Jewish community. Today the former synagogue serves cultural and social purposes.

===Bridges===

Staroměstský Bridge (&quot;Old Town Bridge&quot;) dates from 1574. This stone bridge replaced an older stone bridge, destroyed during the 1561 floods. The bridge is decorated by a Baroque sculpture group of Saints Vitus, Wenceslaus and John of Nepomuk, created by Michael Brokoff in 1714.

&quot;Ovčí můstek&quot; (&quot;Sheep Bridge&quot;) is a small Renaissance bridge from 1561. The bridge is significantly arched to protect it from floods.

Tyrš Bridge is one of the main landmarks of Děčín. This steel bridge was built in 1933 on the site of the older Empress Elisabeth Bridge, which was no longer suitable for increased traffic. The steel structure is supported by modified pillars from the original bridge. The bridge was named in honor of the local native Miroslav Tyrš.

===Other===
In the river Elbe near the left bank stands a basalt hunger stone, which is visible only when water levels are low. It is one of the oldest hydrological monuments in Central Europe. It is an indicator of drought in the region. The oldest legible record for which the time of origin is verified dates from 1616.

The most visited tourist destination in the city is Děčín Zoo. It was founded in 1948.
