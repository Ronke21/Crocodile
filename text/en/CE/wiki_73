Bündchen was the highest-paid model in the world from 2002 to 2017.

Bündchen has five sisters, named Patricia (Pati), Graziela, Gabriela, Raquel, and Rafaela. Pati is her fraternal twin and serves as her manager. Gabriela has served as her personal attorney, Raquel as her website designer, and Rafaela as her accountant. Graziela, a judge, is the only sibling who isn&#x27;t involved in her career.

=== Spirituality ===
Bündchen believes in astrology, manifestation, and witchcraft. According to Tom Brady, she used these methods to successfully predict when he would win or lose the Super Bowl.

<text>Lao Lishi (; born 12 December 1987) is a Chinese retired diver. Lao represented China at the 2004 Summer Olympics, earning a silver medal in the 10 meter women&#x27;s platform and a gold medal in women&#x27;s 10 meter synchronized platform along with Li Ting. 

==Early life==
Born in 1987 in Zhanjiang, Lao was one of six children in the family. Her father was a self-employed businessman while her mother was a housewife. Lao began swimming at just over five years old. While accompanying her mother, who regularly took her older brother to diving training at a sports school in Zhanjiang, she played in the children&#x27;s pool. 
This caught the attention of the coach at the sports school, who recognized her qualities of a promising diver.

==Sports career==
In 1994, while still in preschool, Lao officially began practicing diving at the sports school in Chikan District of Zhanjiang. Despite having a cold and a fever during the 1997 Zhanjiang City Children&#x27;s Diving Championships, she competed and won first place. In March 1998, she joined the Guangdong Diving Team.

In 2001, she participated in her first national competition, winning the doubles diving and attained third in singles diving at the 9th National Games in Guangzhou. In January 2002, she was selected for the national team and on 26 June, she won the women&#x27;s 10-meter individual platform diving championship at the 2002 FINA Diving World Cup in Seville, Spain, along with the 10-meter synchro with Li Ting. On 14 October, she attained first place in the 10 meter platform at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, South Korea, with 434.220 points. She also won multiple titles at the FINA Diving Grand Prix events in Spain, Canada and the United States.

In 2003, she won the 10-meter induvidual, and synchro with Li Ting, in FINA Diving Grand Prix in Australia and China. At the 2004 FINA Diving World Cup finals in Athens, Greence, Lao and Li won the 10 meter synchro platform with an absolute advantage, winning the second gold medal for the Chinese team. On 14 July 2004, the final list of the Chinese national diving team for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens was announced in Jinan, China and Lao was selected 
for the 10-meter individual and 10-meter syncho platforms. At the Olympics, she and Li won the gold medal in the 10-meter synchro with 352.14 points. Lao won silver medal in the induvidual 10-meter platform in the 2004 Olympics with 576.26 points.

After the Olympics, Lao faded out of the national team and returned to the provincial team. At the 2005 National Games in Nanjing, China, she performed poorly and only won the eighth place in the 10-meter platform. In 2006, she returned to the national team and in June 2007, she won the gold medal in the individual 10-meter platform at the FINA Diving Grand Prix in Madrid, Spain. On the same year, at the 2007 Summer Universiade in Bangkok, Thailand, she won gold medal in the individual 10 meter platform. In 2008, during the 2008 Summer Olympics trials held in Jinan, she strained her shoulder due to discomfort during a water entry exercise before the trials. As a result, she lost to newcomers Chen Ruolin and Wang Xin and was not selected for the national team for the Olympics.

On 7 July 2009, Lao along with Chen Ni won gold medal 10-meter synchro at the 2009 Summer Universiade in Belgrade, Serbia, and also won the silver medal at the 3-meter springboard synchro at the same event. In April 2010, at the age of 23, Lao officially retired, ending her sports career.

==Later life==
After retiring from sports, Lao graduated from Sun Yat-sen University. She briefly worked as a sports school teacher and a member of a diving team before eventually joining the Youth Volunteer Action Guidance Center under the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League of China, where she served as a senior staff member responsible for public welfare and charity. In early 2014, she resigned from her civil service position, and by June of the same year, she became a store owner, selling jewellery on the online shopping platform Taobao, which is owned by the Chinese multinational technology company Alibaba Group. In September 2014, she was invited by Alibaba Group co-founder and chairman Jack Ma to be one of the eight bell ringers for the listing of Alibaba Group in the New York Stock Exchange. In 2015, she was enshrined into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale, United States.

On 26 May 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in China, Lao shared an excerpt from &quot;Wuhan Diary&quot;, an online diary written by Fang Fang, on her account on the social media platform Weibo. The excerpt described the death of a nurse who died on the frontlines while dealing with the pandemic in the city of Wuhan. This resulted in online netizens attacking Lao. In response, Lao stated that &quot;suddenly, I feel very happy because I haven&#x27;t lived the way you like&quot; and &quot;if I had lived in a way that earned your praise, I would immediately jump off the ten-meter platform—into an empty pool, the kind without water.&quot; On 3 June 2020, Lao published a post on Weibo condemning online bullying and aggressive nationalism, and she stated:
As a citizen of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, born and raised, I love my motherland and want it to get better and better, for the economy to flourish, for our headstrong civilization to shine, for goodwill to prevail among the people. Is that wrong? I don&#x27;t think so. What is wrong for a bunch of spineless trolls to rampage online, bullying honest people, picking on good people, attacking people at every turn with idiotic verbal assaults along the lines of &quot;I don&#x27;t like you, get the hell out of China.&quot; Please remember, no one is obliged to hand over the land they love to a bunch of invertebrates so they can make it into their playground. Not today, not ever. I&#x27;m a decent person, but I pull no punches! 

The post gained significant traction, receiving over 50,000 likes and 7,400 shares. Following the controversy, her Weibo account was banned for one year.

==Honours==
In 2005, the city of Zhanjiang built a 12.8 meter diving goddess sculpture, commemorating Lao&#x27;s Olympic gold medal performance.

<doc id="926945" wikidata="Q313923" url="?curid=926945" title="Nouriel Roubini">
<text>Nouriel Roubini (; born March 29, 1958) is a Turkish-born Iranian-American economic consultant, economist, speaker and writer. He is a Professor Emeritus since 2021 at the Stern School of Business of New York University.

Roubini earned a BA in political economics at Bocconi University in Italy and a doctorate in international economics at Harvard University. He was an academic at Yale and a researcher/advisor researching emerging markets. In the 1990s, during the Bill Clinton administration, for one year he was a senior economist in the Council of Economic Advisers. Roubini is a frequent critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. 

==Early life==
Roubini was born in Istanbul, Turkey, to Iranian Orthodox Jewish parents. His father was a rug dealer. When he was young, Roubini was expected to go into the rug business himself, and follow in his father’s footsteps. When he was a year old, his family lived briefly in Tehran, Iran. When he was three years old, the family moved to Tel Aviv, Israel; he still has family in Israel. From 1962 when he was five years old to 1983 he lived in Italy, primarily in Milan, where he attended the local Jewish school. He later attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel for one year, in 1976-77. He subsequently attended Bocconi University in Italy, earning a B.A. (&#x27;82) &quot;summa cum laude&quot; in economics; in 2009 he was named Bocconian of the Year. He received a PhD in international economics in 1988 from Harvard University, where his adviser was Jeffrey Sachs.

==Career==
For much of the 1990s, Roubini taught at Yale and then in New York, while also working for stints at the International Monetary Fund (briefly, as a summer intern and visiting scholar), and World Bank (briefly, as a consultant). In 1998-99, he worked for one year in the Clinton administration as a senior economist in the Council of Economic Advisers. He worked from July to October 1999 at the Treasury Department as a senior adviser to Timothy Geithner (who was then the undersecretary for international affairs), and from October 1999 to June 2000 as director of its Office of Policy Development and Review. Roubini returned to the IMF for July through August 2001 as a visiting scholar. He cowrote a book on saving bankrupt economies entitled, &quot;Bailouts or Bail-ins?&quot; and started a consulting firm. He said: &quot;One person who has had a great impact on me intellectually was Jeffrey Sachs... Another … is Larry Summers, the former President of Harvard.&quot; Currently, he is a professor emeritus at the Stern School of Business at New York University.

===Economic forecasts===
Roubini says that his economic analysis approach is &quot;holistic.&quot; Rather than focus on mathematical models and formulas, he draws his ideas from a combination of history, literature, and international politics, what he calls the &quot;entire enchilada.&quot; He also described his approach at an International Monetary Fund meeting, when discussing how he arrived at the percentage likelihood that there would be a recession, by saying: &quot;If you ask me where I got that number: Just out of my nose. I will be very honest about that... my model is like a &#x27;smell test&#x27;.&quot; Political economist Benjamin Kunkel described his approach as &quot;almost &quot;shamanistic&quot;.&quot; Journalist Julia Ioffe observed &quot;Roubini-ism-- [is] sprawling, non-linear, and hypercaffeinated-- ... his talking points are ... pluralized, rushing out quickly, like a magician&#x27;s scarves ...&quot;

Roubini was one of the people, along with among others economists Dean Baker, Fred Harrison, Raghuram Rajan, Stephen Roach, and William White, analyst Meredith Whitney, investment advisers Gary Shilling, Peter Schiff, and Marc Faber, and CFTC chair Brooksley Born who predicted the crash of 2007–08. He said: &quot;I&#x27;ve been studying emerging markets for 20 years, and saw the same signs in the U.S. that I saw in them, which was that we were in a massive credit bubble [as 2008 approached].&quot;

Roubini&#x27;s predictions earned him the nicknames &quot;Dr. Doom&quot; and &quot;permabear&quot; (economist slang for someone who continually projects downturns) in the media. In 2008, &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine wrote, in an article entitled &quot;Eight Who Saw it Coming . . . and eight who didn&#x27;t&quot;, that in 2005 he had said home prices were &quot;riding a speculative wave that would soon sink the economy. Back then the professor was called a Cassandra. Now he&#x27;s a sage&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; noted that he foresaw &quot;homeowners defaulting on mortgages, trillions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities unraveling worldwide and the global financial system shuddering to a halt&quot;. In September 2006, he warned a skeptical IMF that &quot;the United States was likely to face a once-in-a-lifetime housing bust, an oil shock, sharply declining consumer confidence, and, ultimately, a deep recession&quot;. Nobel laureate Paul Krugman added in 2009 that his once &quot;seemingly outlandish&quot; predictions were matched &quot;or even exceeded by reality.&quot;

However, financial journalist Justin Fox observed in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; in 2010 that &quot;In fact, Roubini didn&#x27;t exactly predict the crisis that began in mid-2007... Roubini spent several years predicting a very different sort of crisis — one in which foreign central banks diversifying their holdings out of Treasuries sparked a run on the dollar — only to turn in late 2006 to warning of a U.S. housing bust and a global &#x27;hard landing&#x27;. He still didn&#x27;t give a perfectly clear or (in retrospect) accurate vision of how exactly this would play out... I&#x27;m more than a little weirded out by the status of prophet that he has been accorded since.&quot; Others noted that: &quot;The problem is that even though he was spectacularly right on this one, he went on to predict time and time again, as the markets and the economy recovered in the years following the collapse, that there would be a follow-up crisis and that more extreme crashes were inevitable. His calls, after his initial pronouncement, were consistently wrong. Indeed, if you had listened to him, and many investors did, you would have missed the longest bull market run in US market history.&quot; Another observed: &quot;For a prophet, he&#x27;s wrong an awful lot of the time.&quot; Tony Robbins wrote: &quot;Roubini warned of a recession in 2004 (wrongly), 2005 (wrongly), 2006 (wrongly), and 2007 (wrongly)&quot; ... and he &quot;predicted (wrongly) that there&#x27;d be a &#x27;significant&#x27; stock market correction in 2013.&quot; Speaking about Roubini, economist Anirvan Banerji told &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Even a stopped clock is right twice a day,&quot; and said: &quot;The average time between recessions is about five years ... So, if you forecast a recession one year and it doesn&#x27;t happen, and you repeat your forecast year after year ... at some point the recession will arrive.&quot; Economist Nariman Behravesh said: &quot;Nouriel Roubini has been singing the doom-and-gloom story for 10 years. Eventually something was going to be right.&quot;

In January 2009, Roubini predicted that oil prices would stay below $40 for all of 2009. By the end of 2009, however, oil prices were at $80. In March 2009, he predicted the S&amp;P 500 would fall below 600 that year, and possibly plummet to 200. It closed at over 1,115 however, up 24%, the largest single-year gain since 2003. CNBC&#x27;s Jim Cramer wrote that Roubini was &quot;intoxicated&quot; with his own &quot;prescience and vision,&quot; and should realize that things are better than he predicted; Roubini called Cramer a &quot;buffoon,&quot; and told him to &quot;just shut up&quot;. Although in April 2009, Roubini prophesied that the United States economy would decline in the final two quarters of 2009, and that the US economy would increase just 0.5% to 1% in 2010, in fact the U.S. economy in each of those six quarters increased at a 2.5% average annual rate. Then in June 2009 he predicted that what he called a &quot;perfect storm&quot; was just around the corner, but no such perfect storm ever appeared. In 2009 he also predicted that the US government would take over and nationalize a number of large banks; it did not happen. In October 2009 he predicted that the price of gold &quot;can go above $1,000, but it can&#x27;t move up 20-30%&quot;; he was wrong, as the price of gold rose over the next 18 months, breaking through the $1,000 barrier to over $1,400.

Although in May 2010 he predicted a 20% decline in the stock market, the S&amp;P actually rose about 20% over the course of the next year (even excluding returns from dividends). In 2012, Roubini predicted that Greece would be ejected from the Eurozone, but that did not happen. The &quot;Financial Times&quot; observed that in 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic arrived, he said that policymakers would not mount a large fiscal response. However—they did. Also in 2020, he predicted that a US-Iran war was likely.

Journalist Alex Pareene called Roubini the &quot;Joe Francis of Pessimism Porn,&quot; for writing multiple doomsday columns, including a 2009 column in the &quot;Washington Post&quot; declaring that unless the U.S. government seized and nationalized all US banks the system would collapse; that was simply untrue, it turned out. By highlighting that certain of his past predictions were accurate, Roubini has promoted himself as a major figure in the U.S. and international debate about the economy, and spent much of his time shuttling between meetings with central bank governors and finance ministers in Europe and Asia. Although he was ranked only 1,474th in terms of lifetime academic citations in February 2024, he was No. 4 on &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;top 100 global thinkers.&quot; In 2011 and 2012, he was named by the magazine as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers.

====US economy====
In the 1990s, Roubini studied the collapse of emerging economies. He used an intuitive, historical approach backed up by a study of theoretical models and came to the conclusion that a common denominator was the large current account deficits financed by loans from abroad. Roubini theorized that the US might be the next to suffer, and in 2004 began writing about a possible future collapse. &quot;Business Week&quot; magazine writer Michael Mandel, however, noted in 2006 that Roubini and other economists often make general predictions which could happen over multiyear periods.

In 2004 he said that an upcoming recession would lead to the crash of the dollar; when a few years later a recession did come, it actually strengthened the dollar. In 2005 after Hurricane Katrina hit the US, Roubini predicted that an economic disaster was imminent; however, the next two years instead saw an increase in financial activity.

In September 2006, he prognosticated the end of the real estate bubble: &quot;When supply increases, prices fall: that&#x27;s been the trend for 110 years, since 1890. But since 1997, real home prices have increased by about 90 percent. There is no economic fundamental—real income, migration, interest rates, demographics—that can explain this. It means there was a speculative bubble. And now that bubble is bursting.&quot; In the Spring 2006 issue of &quot;International Finance&quot;, he wrote an article titled &quot;Why Central Banks Should Burst Bubbles&quot; in which he argued that central banks should take action against asset bubbles. When asked whether the real estate ride was over, he said, &quot;Not only is it over, it&#x27;s going to be a nasty fall.&quot; By May 2009, he felt that analysts expecting the US economy to rebound in the third and fourth quarter were &quot;too optimistic&quot;. He expected the full recession to last 24 or 36 months, and believed in the possibility of an &quot;L-shaped&quot; slow recovery that Japan went through in the Lost Decade.

In his opinion, much of the recession&#x27;s cause was due to &quot;boom-and-bust cycles,&quot; and he felt the US economy needed to find a different growth path in the future. &quot;We&#x27;ve been growing through a period of time of repeated big bubbles,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#x27;ve had a model of &#x27;growth&#x27; based on overconsumption and lack of savings. And now that model has broken down because we borrowed too much.&quot; He felt that too much human capital went into financing the &quot;most unproductive form of capital, meaning housing&quot; and said he would like to see America create a model of growth in more-productive activities. He felt that &quot;sustainable growth may mean investing slowly in infrastructures for the future, and rebuilding our human capital,&quot; by investing in renewable resources. &quot;We don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s going to be,&quot; he said, &quot;but it&#x27;s going to be a challenge to find a new growth model. It&#x27;s not going to be simple.&quot;

In late July 2009, he warned that if no clear exit strategy were outlined and implemented, there was the potential of a &quot;perfect storm&quot;: fiscal deficits, rising bond yields, higher oil prices, weak profits, and a stagnant labor market, which combined could &quot;blow the recovering world economy back into a double-dip recession.&quot; In August 2009, he predicted that the global economy would begin recovering near the end of 2009, but said the US economy was likely to grow only about 1% annually during the next two years, which would have been less than the three percent normal &quot;trend.&quot; He said that the Fed was &quot;now embarked on a policy in which they are in effect directly monetizing about half of the budget deficit,&quot; but that now &quot;monetization is not inflationary,&quot; as banks were holding much of the money themselves and not relending it. When these attitudes reverse at the end of the recession, that would be time for an &quot;exit strategy, of mopping up that liquidity&quot; and taking some of the money back out of circulation, &quot;so it doesn&#x27;t just bid up house prices and stock values in a new bubble. And that will be &#x27;very, very tricky indeed,&#x27;&quot; he said.

====Global economy====

=====2006=====
In the summer of 2006, Roubini wrote that the U.S. was headed into a long and &quot;protracted&quot; recession due to the &quot;collapse&quot; of house prices, which he noted were already in freefall.

With regards to Europe, Roubini predicted that Italy, and possibly a series of other Eurozone countries (Portugal, Spain, Greece) might have to exit the eurozone if they did not implement &quot;serious economic reforms.&quot; &quot;[It] is not a foregone conclusion but, if Italy does not reform, an exit from EMU within 5 years is not totally unlikely... The growth slowdown will make the public deficit and debt worse and potentially unsustainable over time. And if a devaluation cannot be used to reduce real wages, the real exchange rate overvaluation will be undone via a slow and painful process of wage and price deflation.&quot;

=====2009=====
In 2009 he was named one of the &quot;TIME&quot; 100, along with among others in the world of finance Bernie Madoff, T. Boone Pickens, and Meredith Whitney (&quot;in our annual TIME 100 issue, we do the impossible: name the people who most affect our world.&quot;).

As of January 2009, he remained pessimistic about the U.S. and global economy. He said in September 2008, &quot;we have a subprime financial system, not a subprime mortgage market&quot;. &quot;As the U.S. economy shrinks, the entire global economy will go into recession. In Europe, Canada, Japan, and the other advanced economies, it will be severe. Nor will emerging market economies—linked to the developed world by trade in goods, finance, and currency—escape real pain.&quot; Roubini said that the subprime issues were a global, and not just a U.S. problem. In late spring 2009 he said, &quot;People talk about the American subprime problem, but there were housing bubbles in the U.K., in Spain, in Ireland, in Iceland, in a large part of emerging Europe, like the Baltics all the way to Hungary and the Balkans. It was not just the U.S., and not just &#x27;subprime.&#x27; It was excesses that led to the risk of a tipping point in many different economies.&quot;

His pessimism was focused on the short-run rather than the medium or long-run. In &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; (Jan/Feb 2009) he wrote, &quot;Last year&#x27;s worst-case scenarios came true. The global financial pandemic that I and others had warned about is now upon us. But we are still only in the early stages of this crisis. My predictions for the coming year, unfortunately, are even more dire: The bubbles, and there were many, have only begun to burst&quot;.

At a conference in January 2009 he said the U.S. banking system was &quot;effectively insolvent.&quot; He added that the &quot;systemic banking crisis. ... The problems of Citi, Bank of America and others suggest the system is bankrupt. In Europe, it&#x27;s the same thing.&quot; To deal with this problem, he recommended that the U.S. government &quot;do triage between banks that are illiquid and undercapitalized but solvent, and those that are insolvent. The insolvent ones you have to shut down.&quot; He adds, &quot;We&#x27;re in a war economy. You need command-economy allocation of credit to the real economy. Not enough is being done.&quot;.

In December 2009, as the price of gold exceeded $1,200 an ounce, Roubini said it looked &quot;suspiciously like a bubble.&quot; However, by September 2012 gold was trading at $1,700. He still predicted that it was a risky bet, saying that it would take &quot;another Armageddon&quot; to make the price of gold rise again.

=====2010=====
In 2010, he again warned that despite an improved economy with rising stock markets, the crisis was not over and new bubbles were on the horizon: &quot;We are just at the next stage. This is where we move from a private to a public debt problem ... We socialised part of the private losses by bailing out financial institutions and providing fiscal stimulus to avoid the great recession from turning into a depression. But rising public debt is never a free lunch, eventually you have to pay for it.&quot;

In late May 2010, markets around the world began dropping due partly to problems in Greece and the Eurozone. &quot;Roubini believes Greece will prove to be just the first of a series of countries standing on the brink,&quot; wrote the &quot;Telegraph.&quot; Roubini spoke about the new issues he felt governments must deal with: &quot;We have to start to worry about the solvency of governments. What is happening today in Greece is the tip of the iceberg of rising sovereign debt problems in the eurozone, in the UK, in Japan and in the US. This ... is going to be the next issue in the global financial crisis.

Roubini met officials in China during spring 2009, and said that many Chinese commentators blamed American &quot;overborrowing and excess&quot; for dragging them into a recession. However, he said that &quot;even they realize that the very excess of American demand has created a market for Chinese exports.&quot; He added that although Chinese leaders &quot;would love to be less dependent on American customers and hate having so many of their nation&#x27;s foreign assets tied up in U.S. dollars,&quot; they&#x27;re now &quot;more worried about keeping Chinese exporters in business. ... I don&#x27;t think even the Chinese authorities have fully internalized the contradictions of their position.&quot;

=====2011-12=====
Roubini and political scientist Ian Bremmer described the 21st century world as fragmenting economically and politically, where the &quot;old models of understanding global dynamics are struggling&quot; to keep up with rapid changes. In an article in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; magazine, they described what they called a &quot;G-Zero world,&quot; where the United States no longer has the resources to continue as the primary provider of global public goods. As a result, they said there was likely to be more conflict than cooperation between countries, creating a &quot;zero-sum game,&quot; a &quot;game in which my win is your loss.&quot; They wrote: “Europe is fully occupied for the moment with saving the eurozone. Japan is likewise tied down with complex political and economic problems at home. None of these powers&#x27; governments has the time, resources, or domestic political capital needed for a new bout of international heavy lifting. Meanwhile, there are no credible answers to transnational challenges without the direct involvement of emerging powers such as Brazil, China, and India. Yet these countries are far too focused on domestic development to welcome the burdens that come with new responsibilities abroad.
In July 2012, Roubini predicted a global &quot;perfect storm&quot; in 2013, with economies all over the world slowing down or completely halting.

=====2014-19=====
By May 2014, Roubini had become bullish, arguing many of the risks to the global economy had receded. He pointed to an improving European economy and stronger euro, steadying of the economy in Japan, and a marked improvement in the United States. He praised the Federal Reserve for its unconventional monetary policy, which he forecast would last for a few more years, supporting equity markets.

At the start of 2017, Roubini speculated that the election of Donald Trump as president might portend a geopolitical shift away from globalization and toward isolationism, which he felt could lead to global instability and rising military conflicts among other countries.

Roubini attacked cryptocurrency in remarks to a U.S. Senate Banking Committee in 2018. That year he was a member of the Berggruen Institute&#x27;s 21st Century Council.

In November 2019, he wrote &quot;Nine Reasons Why the Stock Markets Are Far Too Optimistic&quot;.

=====2020=====
On February 17, 2020, he warned of financial vulnerabilities that &quot;could trigger severe economic, financial, political, and geopolitical disturbances unlike anything since the 2008 crisis.&quot; Two days later, the market peaked prior to what would become the 2020 stock market crash. Following a relatively minor decrease, Roubini warned on February 24 that the markets were still too complacent about coronavirus, predicting a government response followed by positive market reaction, which would then fizzle.

==Bitcoin and cryptocurrency==

He is a frequent critic of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Roubini has tweeted:99% of crypto land is one shitcoin traded for another shitcoin. And the average shitcoin lost 90% or more of its value in the last year. So Crypto Land is Crap Land, a cesspool of lunatics with severe Freudian scatological obsessions that swim 24/7 in their own stinking shit.He views blockchain as, &quot;the byword for a libertarian ideology that treats all governments, central banks, traditional financial institutions, and real-world currencies as evil concentrations of power that must be destroyed.&quot; Roubini regards cryptocurrencies and blockchain as both utopian and at bottom &quot;about greed&quot; in relation to their promoters.

In 2018, he told Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin to &quot;just shut up.&quot; In 2019, Roubini called BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes a &quot;sleazy coward,&quot; and told him to &quot;shut up.&quot;

==Consulting business==
In 2005, he formed Roubini Global Economics, a small economic consultancy for financial analysis. He said, &quot;the world is my home, so everything about society and culture—no matter how —is worth knowing. I am an information junkie and created RGE Monitor to collect information about what&#x27;s happening around the world.&quot; As of 2011, the firm was not profitable. Roubini said: &quot;The most important thing in this kind of business is that you have to be right day in and day out. The fact that I made a right call a few years ago doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; He closed the firm in 2016.

In 2017, he formed Roubini Macro Associates, a global macroeconomic consultancy firm in New York. He is also Chief Economist for Atlas Capital Team LP, as well as Co-Founder of Rosa &amp; Roubini Associates.

==Personal life==

Journalist Helaine Olen described Roubini as having &quot;an accent reminiscent of a James Bond villain, and a laugh that seems to kick in on a one-second tape delay.&quot; &quot;The Financial Times&quot; wrote: &quot;when you meet him, his unflinching, unsmiling, uncompromising negativity feels like a break with normal human coping mechanisms.&quot; &quot;New York Times&quot; journalist Stephen Mihm wrote: &quot;With a dour manner and an aura of gloom about him, Roubini gives the impression of being permanently pained... He rarely smiles, and when he does, his face... contorts into something more closely resembling a grimace.&quot;

He speaks English, Persian, Italian, Hebrew, and conversational French. Roubini likes to refer to himself as a &quot;global nomad&quot;, and said, &quot;You can be sitting still surfing the Internet, and experience other worlds, ideas and societies. But I&#x27;ve found that there is nothing better than visiting a different country ...&quot;

Asked to describe his parties at his apartment, Roubini said: &quot;I look for ten girls to one guy.&quot; He added that his friend Bill Clinton was a fan of this ratio.

Roubini is a US citizen. He is identified as a Democrat in his profile on Wall Street Economists. Roubini announced on Twitter in early 2014 his new practice of Transcendental Meditation. Roubini does not want to have children, and cites various global threats as the basis for his position.

=== Personal investments ===
During an interview in June 2009, he was asked about his personal lifestyle expenses and other investments. He said, &quot;I regularly save about 30% of my income. Apart from my mortgage, I don&#x27;t have any other debts. The credit crunch hasn&#x27;t affected me much... I&#x27;ve always lived within my means and, luckily, have never been out of work. I would say I&#x27;m a frugal person—I don&#x27;t have very expensive tastes... You don&#x27;t need to spend a lot to enjoy things.&quot; Asked whether he invests in stocks, he replied, &quot;Not as much these days. I used to have a lot in equities—about 75%—but over the past three years, I&#x27;ve had about 95% in cash and 5% in equities. You&#x27;re not getting much from savings these days but earning 0% is better than losing 50%... I don&#x27;t believe in picking individual stocks or assets... Never invest your money as though you are gambling at the casino. Buying and selling individual stocks is a waste of time.&quot;

<text>Plasma cells, also called plasma B cells or effector B cells, are white blood cells that originate in the lymphoid organs as B cells and secrete large quantities of proteins called antibodies in response to being presented specific substances called antigens. These antibodies are transported from the plasma cells by the blood plasma and the lymphatic system to the site of the target antigen (foreign substance), where they initiate its neutralization or destruction. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody molecules closely modeled after the receptors of the precursor B cell.

== Structure ==
Plasma cells are large lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm and a characteristic appearance on light microscopy. They have basophilic cytoplasm and an eccentric nucleus with heterochromatin in a characteristic cartwheel or clock face arrangement. Their cytoplasm also contains a pale zone that on electron microscopy contains an extensive Golgi apparatus and centrioles. Abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum combined with a well-developed Golgi apparatus makes plasma cells well-suited for secreting immunoglobulins. Other organelles in a plasma cell include ribosomes, lysosomes, mitochondria, and the plasma membrane.

===Surface antigens===
Terminally differentiated plasma cells express relatively few surface antigens, and do not express common pan-B cell markers, such as CD19 and CD20. Instead, plasma cells are identified through flow cytometry by their additional expression of CD138, CD78, and the Interleukin-6 receptor. In humans, CD27 is a good marker for plasma cells; naïve B cells are CD27−, memory B-cells are CD27+ and plasma cells are CD27++.

The surface antigen CD138 (syndecan-1) is expressed at high levels.

Another important surface antigen is CD319 (SLAMF7). This antigen is expressed at high levels on normal human plasma cells. It is also expressed on malignant plasma cells in multiple myeloma. Compared with CD138, which disappears rapidly ex vivo, the expression of CD319 is considerably more stable.

== Development ==
After leaving the bone marrow, the B cell acts as an antigen-presenting cell (APC) and internalizes offending antigens, which are taken up by the B cell through receptor-mediated endocytosis and processed. Pieces of the antigen (which are now known as &quot;antigenic peptides&quot;) are loaded onto MHC II molecules, and presented on its extracellular surface to CD4+ T cells (sometimes called &quot;T helper cells&quot;). These T cells bind to the MHC II-antigen molecule and cause activation of the B cell. This is a type of safeguard to the system, similar to a two-factor authentication method. First, the B cells must encounter a foreign antigen and are then required to be activated by T helper cells before they differentiate into specific cells.

Upon stimulation by a T cell, which usually occurs in germinal centers of secondary lymphoid organs such as the spleen and lymph nodes, the activated B cell begins to differentiate into more specialized cells. Germinal center B cells may differentiate into memory B cells or plasma cells. Most of these B cells will become plasmablasts (or &quot;immature plasma cells&quot;), and eventually plasma cells, and begin producing large volumes of antibodies. Some B cells will undergo a process known as affinity maturation. This process favors, by selection for the ability to bind antigen with higher affinity, the activation and growth of B cell clones able to secrete antibodies of higher affinity for the antigen.

===Immature plasma cells===

The most immature blood cell that is considered of plasma cell lineage is the plasmablast. Plasmablasts secrete more antibodies than B cells, but less than plasma cells. They divide rapidly and are still capable of internalizing antigens and presenting them to T cells. A cell may stay in this state for several days, and then either die or irrevocably differentiate into a mature, fully differentiated plasma cell. Differentiation of mature B cells into plasma cells is dependent upon the transcription factors Blimp-1/PRDM1, BCL6, and IRF4.

== Function ==
Unlike their precursors, plasma cells cannot switch antibody classes, cannot act as antigen-presenting cells because they no longer display MHC-II, and do not take up antigen because they no longer display significant quantities of immunoglobulin on the cell surface. However, continued exposure to antigen through those low levels of immunoglobulin is important, as it partly determines the cell&#x27;s lifespan.

The lifespan, class of antibodies produced, and the location that the plasma cell moves to also depends on signals, such as cytokines, received from the T cell during differentiation. Differentiation through a T cell-independent antigen stimulation (stimulation of a B cell that does not require the involvement of a T cell) can happen anywhere in the body and results in short-lived cells that secrete IgM antibodies. The T cell-dependent processes are subdivided into primary and secondary responses: a primary response (meaning that the T cell is present at the time of initial contact by the B cell with the antigen) produces short-lived cells that remain in the extramedullary regions of lymph nodes; a secondary response produces longer-lived cells that produce IgG and IgA, and frequently travel to the bone marrow. For example, plasma cells will likely secrete IgG3 antibodies if they matured in the presence of the cytokine interferon-gamma. Since B cell maturation also involves somatic hypermutation (a process completed before differentiation into a plasma cell), these antibodies frequently have a very high affinity for their antigen.

Plasma cells can only produce a single kind of antibody in a single class of immunoglobulin. In other words, every B cell is specific to a single antigen, but each cell can produce several thousand matching antibodies per second. This prolific production of antibodies is an integral part of the humoral immune response.

=== Long-lived plasma cells ===

The current findings suggest that after the process of affinity maturation in germinal centers, plasma cells develop into one of two types of cells: short-lived plasma cells (SLPC) or long-lived plasma cells (LLPC). LLPC mainly reside in the bone marrow for a long period of time and secrete antibodies, thus providing long-term protection. LLPC can maintain antibody production for decades or even for the lifetime of an individual, and, unlike B cells, LLPC do not need antigen restimulation to generate antibodies. Human LLPC population can be identified as CD19– CD38hi CD138+ cells.

The long-term survival of LLPC are dependent on a specific environment in the bone marrow, the plasma cell survival niche. Removal of an LLPC from its survival niche results in its rapid death. A survival niche can only support limited number of LLPC, thus the niche&#x27;s environment must protect its LLPC cells but be able to accept new arrivals. The plasma cell survival niche is defined by a combination of cellular and molecular factors and though it has yet to be properly defined, molecules such as IL-5, IL-6, TNF-α, stromal cell-derived factor-1α and signalling via CD44 have been shown to play a role in the survival of LLPC. LLPC can also be found, to a lesser degree, in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where they produce IgA antibodies and contribute to mucosal immunity. Recent findings suggest that plasma cells in the gut do not necessarily need to be generated &quot;de novo&quot; from active B cells but there are also long-lived PC, suggesting the existence of a similar survival niche. Tissue specific niches that allow for the survival of LLPC have been also described in nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALT), human tonsillar lymphoid tissues and human mucosa or mucosa-associated lymphoid tissues (MALT).

Originally it was thought that the continuous production of antibodies is a result of constant replenishment of short-lived plasma cells by memory B cell re-stimulation. Recent findings, however, show that some PC are truly long-lived. The absence of antigens and the depletion of B cells does not appear to have an effect on the production of high-affinity antibodies by the LLPC. Prolonged depletion of B cells (with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody treatment that affects B cells but not PC) also did not affect antibody titres. LLPC secrete high levels of IgG independently of B cells. LLPC in bone marrow are the main source of circulating IgG in humans. Even though IgA production is traditionally associated with mucosal sites, some plasma cells in bone marrow also produce IgA. LLPC in bone marrow have been observed producing IgM.

==Clinical significance==
Plasmacytoma, multiple myeloma, Waldenström macroglobulinemia, heavy chain disease, and plasma cell leukemia are cancers of the plasma cells. Multiple myeloma is frequently identified because malignant plasma cells continue producing an antibody, which can be detected as a paraprotein. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a plasma cell dyscrasia characterized by the secretion of a myeloma protein into the blood and may lead to multiple myeloma.

Common variable immunodeficiency is thought to be due to a problem in the differentiation from lymphocytes to plasma cells. The result is a low serum antibody level and risk of infections.

Primary amyloidosis (AL) is caused by the deposition of excess immunoglobulin light chains which are secreted from plasma cells.

<doc id="926960" wikidata="Q11691377" url="?curid=926960" title="Community HeroCard">
<text>The Community HeroCard (CHC), introduced in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1998, is a community currency that uses debit cards.

The program is a collaboration between local residents, non-profit organizations (NPO), businesses, and the local government to invigorate the local economy and community.

Residents pay an application fee of ten dollars, and when they volunteer at a participating NPO, earn ten community service dollars (C$D) per hour, which is credited to their card.

Participating stores agree to contribute 5 to 20% of the price of a purchase. If a member makes a purchase, the store unconditionally refunds 40% of its commitment to the member; another 40% is refunded if community service dollars are used, and contributed to NPOs if
not. The remaining 20% is contributed to NPOs in the program. In addition, a fee of 25 cents is charged for each card use. Community service dollars must be spent within 180 days or be automatically contributed to NPOs.

As of August 1999, participants included 2,100 individuals, 43 NPOs, and 70 businesses.

The HERO card is a patented invention. The invention was carried to a business plan by Gary Austin of Atlanta, Georgia in 1991 through the late 1990s.

The HERO card is a tool for consumers to create savings and wealth by depositing cash rebates into a private account in the name of the card holder. HERO cards were to be distributed free to all credit card holders and even those who preferred cash purchases. When a purchase was made by the consumer (either credit cards, debit or cash), a rebate would have been deposited into the HERO account for accrual and interest. The exciting concept was that rebates would be available to even cash purchasing consumers and not just credit card users, and the card did not require a credit check to distribute, as it was a &quot;deposit&quot; reward card, and not a credit purchase card.

The HERO card idea was pitched to all the major credit card companies, which initially were excited by the idea, but did not buy into the plan (though some are now offering similar &quot;savings reward&quot; cards now in 2006) see: Money Central Article

Startup stock offerings reached into the millions of dollars for HEROcard, but the company eventually closed its doors after a local card launch in Atlanta did not garner the critical mass to sustain itself.

<doc id="926962" wikidata="Q60142" url="?curid=926962" title="Podium">
<text>A podium (: podiums or podia) is a used to raise something to a short distance above its surroundings. In architecture a building can rest on a large podium. Podiums can also be used to raise people, for instance the conductor of an orchestra stands on a podium as do many public speakers. Common parlance has shown an increasing use of &quot;podium&quot; in North American English to describe a lectern.

In sports, a type of podium can be used to honor the top three competitors in events. In the modern Olympics a tri-level podium is used. Traditionally, the highest platform is in the center for the gold medalist. To their right is a lower platform for the silver medalist, and to the left of the gold medalist is a lower platform for the bronze medalist. At the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, the Silver and Bronze podium places were of equal elevation. In many sports, results in the top three of a competition are often referred to as podiums or podium finishes. In some individual sports, podiums is an official statistic, referring to the number of top three results an athlete has achieved over the course of a season or career. The word may also be used, chiefly in the United States, as a verb, &quot;to podium&quot;, meaning to attain a podium place.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;podium&quot; derives from Latin, which in turn borrowed it from Ancient Greek (&quot;podion&quot;), a word derived from (&quot;pous&quot;, &quot;foot&quot;, with a stem &quot;pod-&quot;).

==Use at modern Olympics==

Podiums were first used at the 1930 British Empire Games (now Commonwealth Games) in Hamilton, Ontario and subsequently during the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid and the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

Podiuming has become a slang term for finishing a contest within the first three places. The use of the word podium as a verb instead of noun is controversial. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote on the very subject of the correct use of the word podium during its Winter Olympic coverage in 2010.

==In motorsport==

In many forms of motorsport, the three top-placed drivers in a race stand on a podium for the trophy ceremony. The winner stands in the middle, with the second placed driver to their right and the third place driver to their left. Also present are the dignitaries selected by the race organisers who will present the trophies.
In some motorsport events, including Formula One, a representative of the team that won the race will also be present at the podium, with a fourth podium step, trophy and champagne. In some series, drivers are provided with a baseball cap with the logo of the series&#x27; tyre provider to wear while on the podium. In an international series, the national anthem of the winning driver, and the winning team or constructor may be played over a public address system and the flags of the drivers&#x27; countries are hoisted above them. The recordings are short versions of the national anthems, ensuring the podium ceremony stays within its allocated time. Should a driver experience problems with his car on a slow lap in Formula One, that driver is transported to the pit lane via road car by the Formula One Administration security officer.

Following the presentation of the trophies, the drivers will often spray Champagne over each other and their team members watching below, a tradition started by Dan Gurney following the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans race. The drivers will generally refrain from spraying champagne if a fatality or major accident occurs during the event. Also, in countries where alcohol sponsorship or drinking is prohibited, alcoholic beverages may be replaced by other drinks, for example rose water.

The term has become common parlance in the media, where a driver may be said to &quot;be heading for a podium finish&quot; or &quot;just missing out on a podium&quot; when he is heading for, or just misses out on a top three finish. The NASCAR Cup Series, the highest level of stock car racing in the United States, does not use a podium in post-game events or statistics. Instead, the winning team celebrates in victory lane, and top-five and top-ten finishes are recognized statistically. Those finishing second to fifth are required to stop in a media bullpen located on pit lane for interviews. The INDYCAR NTT IndyCar Series does not use a podium at either the Indianapolis 500 or at Texas Motor Speedway. The Indy 500 has a long tradition of the winning driver and team celebrating in victory lane, while Texas Motor Speedway president Eddie Gossage has stated that victory lane should be reserved for the winner of the race. The series uses a podium at all other races, particularly road course events.

==In architecture==
Architectural podiums consist of a projecting base or pedestal at ground level, and they have been used since ancient times. Originally sometimes only meters tall, architectural podiums have become more prominent in buildings over time, as illustrated in the gallery.

<doc id="926965" wikidata="Q1522059" url="?curid=926965" title="Scareware">
<text>Scareware is a form of malware which uses social engineering to cause shock, anxiety, or the perception of a threat in order to manipulate users into buying unwanted software (or products). Scareware is part of a class of malicious software that includes rogue security software, ransomware and other scam software that tricks users into believing their computer is infected with a virus, then suggests that they download and pay for fake antivirus software to remove it. Usually the virus is fictional and the software is non-functional or malware itself. According to the Anti-Phishing Working Group, the number of scareware packages in circulation rose from 2,850 to 9,287 in the second half of 2008. In the first half of 2009, the APWG identified a 585% increase in scareware programs.

The &quot;scareware&quot; label can also apply to any application or virus which pranks users with intent to cause anxiety or panic.

== Scam scareware ==
Internet security writers use the term &quot;scareware&quot; to describe software products that produce frivolous and alarming warnings or threat notices, most typically for fictitious or useless commercial firewall and registry cleaner software. This class of program tries to increase its perceived value by bombarding the user with constant warning messages that do not increase its effectiveness in any way. Software is packaged with a look and feel that mimics legitimate security software in order to deceive consumers.

Some websites display pop-up advertisement windows or banners with text such as: &quot;Your computer may be infected with harmful spyware programs. Immediate removal may be required. To scan, click &#x27;Yes&#x27; below.&quot; These websites can go as far as saying that a user&#x27;s job, career, or marriage would be at risk. Products with advertisements such as these are often considered scareware. Serious scareware applications qualify as rogue software.

Some scareware is not affiliated with any other installed programs. A user can encounter a pop-up on a website indicating that their PC is infected. In some scenarios, it is possible to become infected with scareware even if the user attempts to cancel the notification.
These popups are specially designed to look like they come from the user&#x27;s operating system when they are actually a webpage.

A 2010 study by Google found 11,000 domains hosting fake anti-virus software, accounting for 50% of all malware delivered via internet advertising.

Starting on March 29, 2011, more than 1.5 million web sites around the world have been infected by the LizaMoon SQL injection attack spread by scareware.

Research by Google discovered that scareware was using some of its servers to check for internet connectivity. The data suggested that up to a million machines were infected with scareware. The company has placed a warning in the search results for users whose computers appear to be infected.

Another example of scareware is Smart Fortress. This site scares the victim into thinking they have many viruses on their computer and asks them to buy a professional service.

=== Spyware ===
Some forms of spyware also qualify as scareware because they change the user&#x27;s desktop background, install icons in the computer&#x27;s notification area (under Microsoft Windows), and claiming that some kind of spyware has infected the user&#x27;s computer and that the scareware application will help to remove the infection. In some cases, scareware trojans have replaced the desktop of the victim with large, yellow text reading &quot;Warning! You have spyware!&quot; or a box containing similar text, and have even forced the screensaver to change to &quot;bugs&quot; crawling across the screen. Winwebsec is the term usually used to address the malware that attacks the users of Windows operating system and produces fake claims similar to that of genuine anti-malware software.

SpySheriff exemplifies spyware and scareware: it purports to remove spyware, but is actually a piece of spyware itself, often accompanying SmitFraud infections. Other antispyware scareware may be promoted using a phishing scam.

==Uninstallation of security software==
Another approach is to trick users into uninstalling legitimate antivirus software, such as Microsoft Security Essentials, or disabling their firewall. Since antivirus programs typically include protection against being tampered with or disabled by other software, scareware may use social engineering to convince the user to disable programs which would otherwise prevent the malware from working.

==Legal action==
In 2005, Microsoft and Washington state successfully sued Secure Computer (makers of Spyware Cleaner) for $1 million over charges of using scareware pop-ups.
Washington&#x27;s attorney general has also brought lawsuits against Securelink Networks, Softwareonline.com, High Falls Media, and the makers of Quick Shield.

In October 2008, Microsoft and the Washington attorney general filed a lawsuit against two Texas firms, Branch Software and Alpha Red, producers of the Registry Cleaner XP scareware.
The lawsuit alleges that the company sent incessant pop-ups resembling system warnings to consumers&#x27; personal computers stating &quot;CRITICAL ERROR MESSAGE! - REGISTRY DAMAGED AND CORRUPTED&quot;, before instructing users to visit a web site to download Registry Cleaner XP at a cost of $39.95.

On December 2, 2008, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (&quot;FTC&quot;) filed a Complaint in federal court against Innovative Marketing, Inc., ByteHosting Internet Services, LLC, as well as individuals Sam Jain, Daniel Sundin, James Reno, Marc D’Souza, and Kristy Ross. The Complaint also listed Maurice D’Souza as a Relief Defendant, alleged that he held proceeds of wrongful conduct but not accusing him of violating any law. The FTC alleged that the other Defendants violated the FTC Act by deceptively marketing software, including WinFixer, WinAntivirus, DriveCleaner, ErrorSafe, and XP Antivirus. According to the complaint, the Defendants falsely represented that scans of a consumer&#x27;s computer showed that it had been compromised or infected and then offered to sell software to fix the alleged problems.

== Prank software ==
Another type of scareware involves software designed to literally scare the user through the use of unanticipated shocking images, sounds or video.

* An early program of this type is NightMare, a program distributed on the Fish Disks for the Amiga computer (Fish #448) in 1991. When NightMare executes, it lies dormant for an extended and random period of time, finally changing the entire screen of the computer to an image of a skull while playing a horrifying shriek on the audio channels.
* Anxiety-based scareware puts users in situations where there are no positive outcomes. For example, a small program can present a dialog box saying &quot;Erase everything on hard drive?&quot; with two buttons, both labeled &quot;OK&quot;. Regardless of which button is chosen, nothing is destroyed.
* This tactic was used in an advertisement campaign by Sir-Tech in 1997 to advertise &quot;&quot;. When the file is run, a full screen representation of the desktop appears. The software then begins simulating deletion of the Windows folder. When this process is complete, a message is slowly typed on screen saying &quot;Thank God this is only a game.&quot; A screen with the purchase information appears on screen and then returns to the desktop. No damage is done to the computer during the advertisement.

== Detection ==
Research in the 2020s has also introduced a new detection technology designed to identify scareware social engineering attacks with enhanced resilience. This approach targets the visual images presented to end users, which is a layer that attackers cannot easily obscure.

<doc id="926966" wikidata="Q3252739" url="?curid=926966" title="String vibration">
<text>A vibration in a string is a wave. Resonance causes a vibrating string to produce a sound with constant frequency, i.e. constant pitch. If the length or tension of the string is correctly adjusted, the sound produced is a musical tone. Vibrating strings are the basis of string instruments such as guitars, cellos, and pianos. For an homogenous string, the motion is given by the wave equation.

== Wave ==

The velocity of propagation of a wave in a string (formula_1) is proportional to the square root of the force of tension of the string (formula_2) and inversely proportional to the square root of the linear density (formula_3) of the string:

formula_4

This relationship was discovered by Vincenzo Galilei in the late 1500s. 
===Derivation===

Source:

Let formula_5 be the length of a piece of string, formula_6 its mass, and formula_3 its linear density. If angles formula_8 and formula_9 are small, then the horizontal components of tension on either side can both be approximated by a constant formula_2, for which the net horizontal force is zero. Accordingly, using the small angle approximation, the horizontal tensions acting on both sides of the string segment are given by

:formula_11
:formula_12

From Newton&#x27;s second law for the vertical component, the mass (which is the product of its linear density and length) of this piece times its acceleration, formula_13, will be equal to the net force on the piece:

:formula_14

Dividing this expression by formula_2 and substituting the first and second equations obtains (we can choose either the first or the second equation for formula_2, so we conveniently choose each one with the matching angle formula_9 and formula_8)

:formula_19

According to the small-angle approximation, the tangents of the angles at the ends of the string piece are equal to the slopes at the ends, with an additional minus sign due to the definition of formula_8 and formula_9. Using this fact and rearranging provides

:formula_22

In the limit that formula_5 approaches zero, the left hand side is the definition of the second derivative of formula_24, 

:formula_25

this equation is known as the wave equation, and the coefficient of the second time derivative term is equal to formula_26; thus

:formula_27

Where formula_1 is the speed of propagation of the wave in the string. However, this derivation is only valid for small amplitude vibrations; for those of large amplitude, formula_5 is not a good approximation for the length of the string piece, the horizontal component of tension is not necessarily constant. The horizontal tensions are not well approximated by formula_2.

== Frequency of the wave ==
Once the speed of propagation is known, the frequency of the sound produced by the string can be calculated. The speed of propagation of a wave is equal to the wavelength formula_31 divided by the period formula_32, or multiplied by the frequency formula_33:

:formula_34

If the length of the string is formula_35, the fundamental harmonic is the one produced by the vibration whose nodes are the two ends of the string, so formula_35 is half of the wavelength of the fundamental harmonic. Hence one obtains Mersenne&#x27;s laws:

:formula_37

where formula_2 is the tension (in Newtons), formula_3 is the linear density (that is, the mass per unit length), and formula_35 is the length of the vibrating part of the string. Therefore:
* the shorter the string, the higher the frequency of the fundamental
* the higher the tension, the higher the frequency of the fundamental
* the lighter the string, the higher the frequency of the fundamental

Moreover, if we take the nth harmonic as having a wavelength given by formula_41, then we easily get an expression for the frequency of the nth harmonic:

:formula_42

And for a string under a tension T with linear density formula_3, then

:formula_44

== Observing string vibrations ==

One can see the waveforms on a vibrating string if the frequency is low enough and the vibrating string is held in front of a CRT screen such as one of a television or a computer (&quot;not&quot; of an analog oscilloscope).
This effect is called the stroboscopic effect, and the rate at which the string seems to vibrate is the difference between the frequency of the string and the refresh rate of the screen. The same can happen with a fluorescent lamp, at a rate that is the difference between the frequency of the string and the frequency of the alternating current.
(If the refresh rate of the screen equals the frequency of the string or an integer multiple thereof, the string will appear still but deformed.)
In daylight and other non-oscillating light sources, this effect does not occur and the string appears still but thicker, and lighter or blurred, due to persistence of vision.

A similar but more controllable effect can be obtained using a stroboscope. This device allows matching the frequency of the xenon flash lamp to the frequency of vibration of the string. In a dark room, this clearly shows the waveform. Otherwise, one can use bending or, perhaps more easily, by adjusting the machine heads, to obtain the same, or a multiple, of the AC frequency to achieve the same effect. For example, in the case of a guitar, the 6th (lowest pitched) string pressed to the third fret gives a G at 97.999 Hz. A slight adjustment can alter it to 100 Hz, exactly one octave above the alternating current frequency in Europe and most countries in Africa and Asia, 50 Hz. In most countries of the Americas—where the AC frequency is 60 Hz—altering A# on the fifth string, first fret from 116.54 Hz to 120 Hz produces a similar effect.

<doc id="926969" wikidata="Q427881" url="?curid=926969" title="Royal Caribbean Group">
<text>Royal Caribbean Group, formerly known as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd., is a global cruise holding company incorporated in Liberia and based in Miami, Florida. It is the world&#x27;s second-largest cruise line operator, after Carnival Corporation &amp; plc. As of March 2024, Royal Caribbean Group fully owns three cruise lines: Royal Caribbean International, Celebrity Cruises, and Silversea Cruises with 65 ships in the current fleet and 5 ships on order until 2028. They also hold a 50% stake in TUI Cruises and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.

==History==
Royal Caribbean Group was formed as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in 1997 when Royal Caribbean Cruise Line purchased Celebrity Cruises. The decision was made to keep the two cruise line brands separate following the merger; as a result Royal Caribbean Cruise Line was re-branded Royal Caribbean International and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. was established as the new parent company of both Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.

A third brand under Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership was formed in 2000 when Island Cruises was created as a joint venture with First Choice Holidays. Island Cruises became an informal cruise line on the British and Brazilian markets.

In November 2006, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased Pullmantur Cruises based in Madrid, Spain. From there, the company expanded rapidly with the creation of Azamara Cruises in May 2007 as a subsidiary of Celebrity Cruises. It followed this with the formation of CDF Croisières de France in May 2008 to serve the French-language market.

Royal Caribbean also has an interest in TUI Cruises, a joint venture with TUI AG, which began operations in 2009 aimed at a German-speaking market. TUI Cruises&#x27;s subsidiary, TUI Travel, had a 50% interest in Island Cruises following their merger with First Choice Holidays in 2007. In October 2008, Royal Caribbean Cruises rationalized their holdings by selling their share of Island Cruises to TUI.

In early 2019, Royal Caribbean announced in a joint venture with ITM Group the formation of Holistica, a company that intends to develop cruise destinations. The only known destination that the company is to develop is the Grand Lucayan Resort, located in Freeport after the hotel campus was sold to newly formed subsidiary by the Bahamian Government.

On July 10, 2020, Royal Caribbean Cruises purchased the remaining shares of Silversea Cruises. That same month, it also changed its name to Royal Caribbean Group. It also adjusted its logo. Royal Caribbean sold Azamara Cruises to Sycamore Partners in March 2021 for $201 million.

In July 2022, Royal Caribbean Group received court approval to purchase Endeavor, a former Crystal Cruise ship, for $275 million. The ship was renamed Silver Endeavour when it officially joins the Royal Caribbean&#x27;s subsidiary, Silversea Cruises&#x27; fleet.

On February 1, 2024, Royal Caribbean Group broke ground on a new headquarters building between its two existing headquarters buildings at PortMiami. The company&#x27;s new 10-story headquarters building will have about 380,000 square feet of interior space and includes on-site amenities such as &quot;green spaces, gyms, and dry cleaning&quot;. The company will also update its existing headquarters buildings and add a multi-story parking garage.

== Subsidiaries ==
=== Royal Caribbean International ===
=== Celebrity Cruises ===
=== Silversea Cruises ===
Silversea Cruises is a luxury cruise line headquartered in Monaco. Founded in 1994 by the Vlasov Group of Monaco and the Lefebvre family of Rome it pioneered all-inclusive cruising with its first ship, &quot;Silver Cloud&quot;. Since July 2020, it has been owned by Royal Caribbean Group.

== Other significant investments ==

=== TUI Cruises ===
=== Holistica Destinations ===

Holistica Destinations was formed in early 2019 as a joint venture between Royal Caribbean Group and the ITM Group with the intention of purchasing the Grand Lucayan Resort and re-developing the neighbouring Freeport Harbour in The Bahamas as a cruise destinations that would benefit the local Freeport economy. However, the Government of the Bahamas withdrew support for the re-development of the Grand Lucayan Resort citing that it was &#x27;not in the best interests of the Bahamian people&#x27;. Holistica continues to plan for a Freeport Harbour re-development.

Holistica also operates three other popular cruise destinations in the Caribbean. These are Costa Maya in Mexico, Roatan in Honduras, and Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.

=== Grand Bahama Shipyard ===

Grand Bahama Shipyard is a ship maintenance facility located in Freeport, the Bahamas. Royal Caribbean Group holds a 40% stake. Other investors include Carnival Corporation (40% stake) and the Grand Bahama Port Authority (20% stake).

Royal Caribbean Group and Carnival Corporation announced a joint investment of $350 million in the shipyard in 2021, partly in response to damage suffered to the facility after an incident involving the collapse of two cranes during maintenance on &quot;Oasis of the Seas&quot; and damages caused by Hurricane Dorian, both occurring in 2019.

=== iCON Infrastructure partnership ===

Royal Caribbean Group and iCON Infrastructure entered a partnership in 2022 to own, manage, and develop strategic cruise port infrastructure in home ports and key ports of call. The partnership includes Royal Caribbean International-operated Terminal A in PortMiami, as well as several development projects in Spain, Italy, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Royal Caribbean Group holds a 10% stake.

=== Wamos Air ===
Wamos Air (formerly Pullmantur Air) is a wet-leasing and charter airline headquartered in Madrid, Spain. Royal Caribbean Group holds a 19% stake.

== Strategic partnership with Meyer Turku and Finland ==
In December 2022, Royal Caribbean announced a strategic partnership with Meyer Turku and the government of Finland to chart the way forward for innovative and sustainable shipbuilding in Finland.

== Former brands ==
*Island Cruises (50% share, owned 2000–2008)
*CDF Croisières de France (2007-2017)
*SkySea Cruise Lines (35%, 2016–2018)
*Azamara Cruises (2000-2021, sold)

<text>Gif-sur-Yvette (, &quot;Gif-on-Yvette&quot;) is a commune in southwestern Île-de-France, France. It is located in the Vallée de Chevreuse, from the centre of Paris (at Notre-Dame), in the Essonne department on the departmental border with Yvelines. In 2021, it had a population of 22,352.

==Geography==
The town is crossed by and named after the river Yvette.
The total area is and is green spaces and woods.

===Place names===
The commune of Gif-sur-Yvette is composed of three main parts:
* In the valley: Rougemonts, Mérantaise, Mairie, Féverie, Coupières, Damiette, Courcelle, L&#x27;Abbaye, Les Coudraies;
* On the Moulon Plateau: Moulon (uninhabited, aside from a research and educational institute);
* On the Hurepoix Plateau: Hacquinière, Belleville and Chevry.

The commune includes a number of woods such as the Hacquinière wood and the D&#x27;Aigrefoin wood.

===Neighbouring communes===
The neighbouring communes are Villiers-le-Bâcle, Saint-Aubin, Saclay, Orsay, Bures-sur-Yvette, Gometz-le-Châtel, Gometz-la-Ville and Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.

==History==
Human presence on the Moulon Plateau originates in Neolithic times. Agriculture was developed, notably during the Roman era. Between the 12th and the 18th century, an important Benedictine abbey was housed in Gif. In the 19th century, amid the Industrial Revolution, Gif remained largely agricultural, with operating mills in particular.
In the 1770s, the Château de Button by architect Pierre Desmaisons was completed in Gif. In 1946, the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS) installed an office and research facility on the property.

In 1867, the town was linked to Paris by train with the Ligne de Sceaux in the valley, which would later become the southern branch of the current-day RER B line.
Following the First World War, the Gif commune experienced an important demographic change, with an increasing population. The town took the name of Gif-sur-Yvette in 1930.

Just after the Second World War, Gif-sur-Yvette acquired an international scientific reputation, with the CNRS and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) moving there. The CEA discovered radioactive contamination in a private home in Gif-sur-Yvette in 1974; the home had been built upon a site where needles containing radon gas were once manufactured, starting in 1915. The needles were used to sterilise infected tissue—an idea developed by Marie Curie.

The town was extended in 1975, with the creation of the Chevry neighbourhood, from areas ceded by the Gometz-la-Ville and Gometz-le-Châtel communes.

==Main sights==
The Église Saint-Rémi (Saint Rémi church), a structure of Romanesque and Gothic architecture, was built in the 12th century. It was registered as a historic monument in 1938.

Some ruins remain of a Benedictine abbey which was built in the 12th century and became a national property in 1789 amid the French Revolution. It was officially registered in 1963.

==Demographics==
Inhabitants of Gif-sur-Yvette are known as &quot;Giffois&quot; (masculine) and &quot;Giffoises&quot; (feminine) in French.
==Economy==
Gif-sur-Yvette is situated in the &quot;Science Valley&quot; of the Yvette River. Numerous research organisations exist in the area, such as the French National Centre for Scientific Research (, CNRS), the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (&quot;Commissariat à l&#x27;énergie atomique et aux énergies alternatives&quot;, CEA), Supélec (&quot;École supérieure d&#x27;électricité&quot;), the LGEP (&quot;Laboratoire de génie électrique de Paris&quot;, associated with Supélec), SOLEIL Synchrotron (Source Optimisée de Lumière d&#x27;Energie Intermediaire du LURE) and the Institute of Plant Biotechnology. Further, Gif-sur-Yvette is home to the former &quot;Centre national d&#x27;étude et de formation&quot; of the National Police.

The General Confederation of Labour (CGT) operates, since 1950, a &quot;permanent central college&quot; in Gif-sur-Yvette, the Benoît Frachon Centre, situated along the Yvette River.

==Transport==
Gif-sur-Yvette is served by two stations on Paris RER line B: Gif-sur-Yvette and Courcelle-sur-Yvette.
Like all the train stations on this line, one train goes towards/past Paris (Aéroport Charles de Gaulle 2 TGV or Mitry-Claye) and the other goes towards the other end of the line : Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.
The trains arrive generally at 15-minute intervals.

==People==
* Louis Sédilot (1599–1672), early Quebec colonist
* Juliette Adam (1836–1936), founder of the Nouvelle Revue (1879) and operator of a famous literary club during the Third Republic.
* The Duke and Duchess of Windsor&#x27;s former country home, &quot;Le Moulin de la Tuilerie&quot;, a sprawling dwelling created from an old mill and a number of barns, is located on the outskirts of town. The couple bought the buildings in 1952 from the artist Drian, and were weekend residents for some 20 years. It was the only home they owned together. It has been restored as three individual holiday homes which are available to rent through the Landmark Trust and Owners Direct in the UK. Among the Windsors&#x27; famous guests at the house were Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, Cecil Beaton and Marlene Dietrich.
* The artist Fernand Léger died on 17 August 1955 in the house where, in 1972, negotiations were held between Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho which led to the end of the Vietnam War.

<doc id="926992" wikidata="Q4703762" url="?curid=926992" title="Al Dvorin">
<text>Albert Dvorin (November 18, 1922, in Chicago, Illinois – August 22, 2004, near Ivanpah, California) was a promoter, concert announcer and talent agent who was best known for working with Elvis Presley.

As a young man, Dvorin was a trumpet player who had his own orchestra. Dvorin also worked as a talent agent in Chicago early in his career. He specialized in booking what were then known as midget acts and performing animal acts. Dvorin was also the booking agent for Pee Wee King, a country performer who frequently opened for Eddy Arnold. 

He was Presley&#x27;s agent at the start of the singer&#x27;s career, and booked him as an opening act to other performers such as Hank Snow. When Colonel Tom Parker became Presley&#x27;s agent, Dvorin took on the duty of booking opening acts for Presley&#x27;s performances. Among the acts he booked was the &quot;Elvis Presley Midget Fan Club&quot;. 

Dvorin organized an Elvis impersonator talent show in 1958, won by Ral Donner, a renowned early Elvis impersonator. He was later made the announcer for Presley&#x27;s performances. In this role on multiple occasions he made the statement &quot;Elvis has left the building&quot;. Although Dvorin did not originate the phrase, he helped popularize it.

Parker liked to schedule Presley with opening acts like &quot;comedians, jugglers and acrobats&quot;, and Dvorin was the agent trusted to book those opening acts. When Presley died in 1977, Dvorin did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Parker, so he did not try to profit from his relationship with Presley. When Parker died in 1997, Dvorin started working for Presley tribute shows.

After announcing for an Elvis tribute show in August, 2004, featuring Elvis impersonator Paul Casey at the Trump 29 Casino in Coachella, California, Dvorin was killed in a car accident on the way back to his Las Vegas home. After his death, Presley estate spokesperson Todd Morgan said of the iconic phrase, &quot;Al made it his own with his particular style.&quot;

<doc id="926994" wikidata="Q253506" url="?curid=926994" title="Spinster">
<text>Spinster or old maid is a term referring to an unmarried woman who is older than what is perceived as the prime age range during which women usually marry. It can also indicate that a woman is considered unlikely to ever marry. The term originally denoted a woman whose occupation was to spin. The closest equivalent term for males is &quot;bachelor&quot; or &quot;confirmed bachelor&quot; (or, in cases of gay men, &quot;he never married&quot;), but this generally does not carry the same connotations in reference to age and perceived desirability in marriage. 

==Etymology and history==
Long before the Industrial Age, &quot;the art &amp; calling of being a spinster&quot; denoted girls and women who spun wool. According to the &quot;Online Etymological Dictionary&quot;, spinning was &quot;commonly done by unmarried women, hence the word came to denote&quot; an unmarried woman in legal documents from the 1600s to the early 1900s, and &quot;by 1719 was being used generically for &#x27;woman still unmarried and beyond the usual age for it&#x27;&quot;. As a denotation for unmarried women in a legal context, the term dates back to at least 1699, and was commonly used in banns of marriage of the Church of England where the prospective bride was described as a &quot;spinster of this parish&quot;.

The &quot;Oxford American Dictionary&quot; tags &quot;spinster&quot; (meaning &quot;...unmarried woman, typically an older woman beyond the usual age for marriage&quot;) as &quot;derogatory&quot; and &quot;a good example of the way in which a word acquires strong connotations to the extent that it can no longer be used in a neutral sense.&quot;

The 1828 and 1913 editions of &quot;Merriam Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defined spinster in two ways:
By the 1800s, the term had evolved to include women who chose not to marry. During that century middle-class spinsters, as well as their married peers, took ideals of love and marriage very seriously, and spinsterhood was indeed often a consequence of their adherence to those ideals. They remained unmarried not because of individual shortcomings but because they didn&#x27;t find a man &quot;who could be all things to the heart&quot;.

One 19th-century editorial in the fashion publication &quot;Peterson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; encouraged women to remain choosy in selecting a mate — even at the price of never marrying. The editorial, titled &quot;Honorable Often to Be an Old Maid&quot;, advised women: &quot;Marry for a home! Marry to escape the ridicule of being called an old maid? How dare you, then, pervert the most sacred institution of the Almighty, by becoming the wife of a man for whom you can feel no emotions of love, or respect even?&quot;

==Current use==

The &quot;Oxford American English Dictionary&quot; defines spinster as &quot;an unmarried woman, typically an older woman beyond the usual age for marriage&quot;. It adds: &quot;In modern everyday English, however, spinster cannot be used to mean simply &#x27;unmarried woman&#x27;; as such, it is a derogatory term, referring or alluding to a stereotype of an older woman who is unmarried, childless, prissy, and repressed.&quot;

Currently, &quot;Merriam-Webster&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; defines the &quot;unmarried woman&quot; sense of the term in three ways: (1) an archaic usage meaning &quot;an unmarried woman of gentle family&quot;, (2) a meaning related to (1) but not tagged as archaic: &quot;an unmarried woman and especially one past the common age for marrying&quot; and (3) &quot;a woman who seems unlikely to marry&quot;.

Dictionary.com describes the &quot;woman still unmarried beyond the usual age of marrying&quot; sense of the term as &quot;Disparaging and Offensive&quot;. A usage note goes on to say that this sense &quot;is ... perceived as insulting. It implies negative qualities such as being fussy or undesirable&quot;. Also included is a sense of the word used specifically in a legal context: &quot;a woman who has never married&quot;.

Wordreference.com describes the &quot;woman still unmarried&quot; sense of spinster as &quot;dated&quot;.

Age is a crucial part of the definition, according to Robin Lakoff&#x27;s explanation in &quot;Language and Woman&#x27;s Place&quot;: &quot;If someone is a spinster, by implication she is not eligible [to marry]; she has had her chance, and been passed by. Hence, a girl of twenty cannot be properly called a spinster: she still has a chance to be married&quot;. Yet other sources on terms describing a never-married woman indicate that the term applies to a woman as soon as she is of legal age or age of majority (see bachelorette, single).

The title &quot;spinster&quot; has been embraced by feminists like Sheila Jeffreys, whose book &quot;The Spinster and Her Enemies&quot; (1985) defines spinsters simply as women who have chosen to reject sexual relationships with men. In her 2015 book, &quot;Spinster, Making a Life of One&#x27;s Own,&quot; Kate Bolick has written, &quot;To me, the spinster is self-reliant and inscrutable. We think we know what the wife is up to and what the mother is up to but the single woman is mysterious. I like that mystery. So the term is a useful way to hold onto the idea of autonomy that can get so easily lost inside of marriage or motherhood&quot;.

In 2005, in England and Wales, the term was abolished in favour of &quot;single&quot; for the purpose of marriage registration. However, it is still often used when the banns of marriage are read by Church of England parish churches.

In the journal &quot;Critical Studies in Television&quot;, Lauren Jade Thompson proposes that one of the male characters in &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; is portrayed as a spinster, rather than as a bachelor.

==Research==
A 2009 University of Missouri study of 32 women found that modern &quot;spinsters&quot; feel a social stigma attached to their status and a sense of both heightened visibility and invisibility. &quot;Heightened visibility came from feelings of exposure and invisibility came from assumptions made by others&quot;.

==Women and marriage==
Women may not have married for a variety (and/or combination) of reasons, including personal inclination, a dearth of eligible men (whose numbers can decrease dramatically during war conflicts), and socio-economic conditions (that is, the availability of livelihoods for women). Writer and spinster Louisa May Alcott famously wrote that &quot;liberty is a better husband than love to many of us&quot;. Social status issues could also arise where it was unacceptable for a woman to marry below her social rank but her parents lacked the funds to support a marriage within their social rank.

In the early 19th century, particularly in England, women would fall under coverture, stating that all property and contracts in their name would be ceded to their husbands. This was particularly common in women who owned businesses.

The First World War (1914–1918) prevented many within a generation of women from experiencing romance and marriage or having children.

In modern peacetime societies with wide opportunities for romance, marriage and children, there are other reasons that women remain single as they approach old age. Psychologist Erik Erikson postulated that during young adulthood (ages 18 to 39), individuals experience an inner conflict between a desire for intimacy (i.e., a committed relationship leading to marriage) and a desire for isolation (i.e., fear of commitment). Other reasons women may choose not to marry include a focus on career, a desire for an independent life, economic considerations, or an unwillingness to make the compromises expected in a marriage.

Some writers have suggested that to understand why women do not marry, one should examine reasons women &quot;do&quot; marry and why it may be assumed they should marry in the first place. According to Adrienne Rich: 

In law, a &#x27;spinster&#x27; refers to an unmarried woman who had reached her majority. This was, in part, to reinforce the right to own property outside of marriage.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in [[Croatia]]. Liberals became active since 1860 in Dalmatia and since 1904 in the rest of Croatia. It never became a major political party. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it isn&#x27;t necessary so that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==History==
After the restoration of democracy in 1989 liberalism became very divided. Before 2020, one could have distinguished five parties: the right of center Croatian Social Liberal Party (&quot;Hrvatska socijalno-liberalna stranka&quot;, member of LI, ALDE), two center liberal parties: Croatian People&#x27;s Party - Liberal Democrats (&quot;Hrvatska narodna stranka - liberalni demokrati&quot;, observer in LI, member of ALDE) and People&#x27;s Party - Reformists (&quot;Narodna stranka – reformisti&quot;, member of EDP), while left of center is Civic Liberal Alliance (&quot;Građansko-liberalni savez&quot; - GLAS, member of ALDE). Reformists and GLAS are formed from dissidents of the Croatian People&#x27;s Party-Liberal Democrats. Istrian Democratic Assembly (&quot;Istarski demokratski sabor - Dieta Democratica Istriana&quot;, member of ALDE) is considered as Istrian regionalist, but also as a liberal party. In the 2020 Croatian parliamentary election two additional liberal parties emerged as factors on the national scene: Centre and Focus, both members of ALDE.

Main media exponents of Croatian liberalism or liberal ideas include or included newspapers &quot;Novi list&quot; and &quot;Glas Istre&quot;, culture magazine &quot;Zarez&quot; and the defunct weekly &quot;Feral Tribune&quot;.

<text>A last is a mechanical form shaped like a human foot. It is used by shoemakers and cordwainers in the manufacture and repair of shoes. Lasts come in many styles and sizes, depending on the exact job they are designed for. Common variations include simple one-size lasts used for repairing soles and heels, custom-purpose mechanized lasts used in modern mass production, and custom-made lasts used in the making of bespoke footwear. Lasts are made of firm materialshardwoods, cast iron, and high-density plasticsto withstand contact with wetted leather and the strong forces involved in reshaping it. Since the early 19th century, lasts typically come in pairs to match the separate shapes of the right and left feet. The development of an automated lasting machine by the Surinamese-American Jan Ernst Matzeliger in the 1880s was a major development in shoe production, immediately improving quality, halving prices, and eliminating the previous putting-out systems surrounding shoemaking centers.
==Name==
The English word &quot;last&quot; is thought to derive from a Proto-Germanic term reconstructed as *&quot;laistaz&quot; and intending a track, a trace, or a footprint. Cognates include Swedish , Danish , and German .

==History==

Although Roman cordwainersbespoke shoemakershave been found to have shaped some footwear separately for the right and left foot, this distinction was mostly lost following the barbarian invasions in late Antiquity. Upon the return of commercial shoemaking during the High Middle Ages, a single last was used to make shoes for either foot, with the expectation that use would gradually reshape the shoe as needed. The use of such &quot;straights&quot; was particularly important after the rise of both male and female heels in the 17th century made shoemaking more complicated than previously. It was not until the beginning of industrial production and mass marketing in the early 19th century that lasts were again generally made and used in matching pairs. Generic one-size lasts are now only used for basic shoe repair.

Well into the Industrial Revolution, shoe production was optimized by elaborate division of labor in putting-out systems arranged around central workshops but each step of production still required skilled labor. Attempts at mechanization in Britain by Marc Isambard Brunel during the Napoleonic Wars were partial and proved uneconomical after demobilization. Improvements to the sewing machine to suit it for work in leather took until 1850 and the major breakthrough was the Surinamese immigrant Jan Ernst Matzeliger&#x27;s automated lasting machine, patented in 1883. This instantly centralized production, increased production by as much as 14 times, improved quality, and halved prices.

==Design==
A last is a mechanical form shaped like a human foot. Lasts come in many styles and sizes, depending on the exact job they are designed for. Common variations include simple uniform lasts for shoe repair, custom-purpose mechanized lasts for shoe factories, and custom-made lasts for bespoke footwear. Though a last is typically made to approximate the shape of a human foot, the precise shape is tailored to the kind of footwear being made. For example, boot lasts typically hug the instep for a close fit. Modern last shapes are now usually designed with dedicated CAD software.

Lasts are typically made from hardwoods, cast iron, and high-density plastics to maintain their shape even after prolonged use in contact with materials like wetted leather and under the mechanical stresses necessary to stretch and shape the material for shoes. Factory lasts must be able to hold the lasting tacks that position the parts of the shoe and then handle the force of the pullover machines used to bottom the shoe and add the sole. The usual material now is high-density polyethylene plastic (HMW-HDPE), which can be easily, cheaply, and precisely shaped; which withstand more damage from the tacks before requiring repair or replacement; and which can be recycled once they finally do wear out entirely. Wooden lasts are now used only for repair work and bespoke shoemaking, particularly in Europe and North America.

==Custom lasts==

Cordwainers often use lasts that are specifically designed to the proportions of individual customers&#x27; feet. Made from wood or from various modern materials, they don&#x27;t need to withstand the pressures of mass production machinery, but they must be able to handle constant tacking and pinning and the wet environment associated with stretching and shaping materials such as leather.

<text>Montreal Amateur Athletic Association is Canada&#x27;s oldest athletic association, located in Montreal, Quebec. It was renamed as the &quot;Club Sportif MAA&quot; or just &quot;MAA&quot; (Montreal MAA) in 1999 after a brush with bankruptcy, but is still widely known as the MAAA. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the MAA was one of the most important sporting institutions in Canada, and North America, with affiliated teams winning ice hockey&#x27;s Stanley Cup and Canadian football&#x27;s Grey Cup.

==History==
The Montreal Amateur Athletic Association came into existence June 1881 and began as a confederation of three sporting clubs: The Montreal Snow Shoe Club, The Montreal Bicycle Club, and The Montreal Lacrosse Club. These founding clubs shared the club space of the Montreal Gymnasium, located at Mansfield Street and de Maisonneuve Boulevard.

In the 1880s, the MAAA organized the famous annual Montreal Winter Carnival. The Winter Carnival featured a temporary &quot;ice castle&quot; or &quot;ice fort&quot;, which would be &quot;stormed&quot; in a mock attack, as well as several events, such as snowshoe races, toboggan slides, skating carnivals and ice hockey tournaments. The Sir Vincent Meredith Trophy was awarded to the best all-round athlete in the MAAA.

The current clubhouse was opened in 1905, on Peel Street in downtown Montreal, in the current commercial district. Due to problems with an aging population, the club switched from being solely member-financed during the revival of 1999. The high taxes on the clubhouse property in central Montreal exacerbated their problems.

W. R. Granger served two years as the president Montreal AAA from 1918 to 1920, and hosted The Prince of Wales at the clubhouse on a royal visit in November 1919. By the end of World War I, Granger had overseen the revival of the association&#x27;s ice hockey, baseball and soccer teams; and hoped to restart the lacrosse team, establish a trapshooting club, and erect a memorial for members who died serving in the war.

==Historic teams==
===Ice hockey===
The &quot;Montreal Hockey Club&quot; (MHC) was an ice hockey team that played in the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) 1886–1898, the Canadian Amateur Hockey League 1898–1905 and the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association 1905–1908, the Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union from 1908 afterward. The team won the AHAC title from 1888 until 1894, and won the Canadian Amateur Hockey League title in 1902. It was the first club to be presented with the Stanley Cup, in 1893. They won again in 1894, March 1902 and February 1903.

The 1902 team was known as the &quot;Little Men of Iron&quot;. After the 1903 season, players from the team formed the core of the Montreal Wanderers professional club, who took on the &quot;Little Men&quot; nickname. After withdrawing from play with professional teams, the MHC club continued as an amateur club after 1908, winning the Allan Cup in 1930.

The Montreal AAA had withdrawn from several competitive sports by the early 1930s. In October 1932, its directors announced its ice hockey team would separate from the association, and be operated by E. S. Hamilton and G. T. Ogilvie as the Royal Montreal Hockey Club, pending acceptance by the Quebec Amateur Hockey Association.

<doc id="927012" wikidata="Q471131" url="?curid=927012" title="Caproni Ca.5">
<text>The Caproni Ca.5 was an Italian heavy bomber of World War I and the postwar era. It was the final version of the series of aircraft that began with the Caproni Ca.1 in 1914.

==Development==
By late World War I, developments in aircraft technology made older bomber designs unable to penetrate targets defended by modern fighters. Caproni&#x27;s response to this problem was to uprate the power significantly on the existing Ca.3 design, with some versions of the Ca.5 eventually carrying engines with nearly five times the total power that the first Ca.1 had.

Apart from greater power, various refinements were made to the design, including modifications to the main nacelle and undercarriage, and completely new wings. The first prototype flew in late 1917 and the type remained in production until 1921. Some 659 of all versions were built by Caproni, and another three were licence-built in the US (two Ca.44s by Standard, and one Ca.46 by Fisher). Planned licensed production in France was cancelled with the end of the war.

During the war, Caproni designated these aircraft according to the total power of their engines. Afterwards, the company redesignated them.

==Design==
The Ca.5 was a three-engine biplane of a wooden construction, covered with fabric. The crew of four was placed in an open central nacelle (front gunner, two pilots and rear gunner-mechanic). The rear gunner manned upper machine guns, standing upon the central engine in a protective &quot;cage&quot;, just before a propeller.

Armament consisted of two to four Revelli 6.5 mm or 7.7 mm machine guns, one on a front ring mount and one, two or sometimes even three on an upper ring mount. Bombs were suspended under the hull.

==Variants==
* Ca.44 - main production version, originally powered by three Fiat A.12 engines of 149 kW (200 hp) each, hence the name Caproni 600 hp. Later, the A-12&quot;bis&quot; was used, and aircraft so equipped were known as Caproni 600/900 hps
* Ca.45 - variant selected for French service, powered by three Isotta Fraschini V.6s of 186 kW (250 hp) each. (Caproni 600/750 hp, or simply Caproni 750 hp)
* Ca.46 - late-war variant with three 269 kW (360 hp) Liberty engines.
* Ca.47 - (or I.Ca) seaplane version of Ca.44 (ten built)
* Ca.50 - Ca.44s modified as air ambulances
* Ca.57 - (or Breda M-1) - airliner conversion of war-surplus Ca.44s.

==Operators==
* Corpo Aeronautico Militare
* United States Navy

<text>Heathcliff is an American comic strip created by George Gately in 1973, featuring the title character, an orange cat. Now written and drawn by Gately&#x27;s nephew, Peter Gallagher, it is distributed to over 1,000 newspapers by Creators Syndicate, which took over the comic from McNaught Syndicate in 1988. 

The strip and its title character show some resemblance to the more famous Garfield; however, Heathcliff was published five years before the first Garfield strip.

The strip is usually presented in single-panel gag frames on weekdays. On Sundays, however, the strip is expanded to multiple panels (usually 6–8) and titled &quot;Sunday with Heathcliff&quot;. A regular feature in the Sunday strips is &quot;Kitty Korner&quot;, where unusual cats in the real world are described.

Heathcliff daily comics can be currently read online on GoComics, with archives currently dating back to 2002.

==Setting==

The strip takes place in a port town called Westfinster. The title character is an orange housecat, named Heathcliff, owned by an elderly couple named Mr. and Mrs. Nutmeg and their grandson Iggy. Strips often deal with Heathcliff&#x27;s interactions with the Nutmegs, the owner of a local fish market, local dog catchers, commercial fishers, or various dogs and cats throughout the neighborhood. George Gately began the strip and continued to draw it until his retirement in 1998.

Since Peter Gallagher took over the strip, Heathcliff comic strips often have recurring motifs like bubble gum floating, comic strip or celebrity cameos, helmets, robots, an ape called the Garbage Ape, and the word &quot;meat&quot;. Readers often interpret it as surreal humor without logic, though Peter Gallagher claimed in an interview with SOLRAD that &quot;I&#x27;m not just doing stuff that doesn&#x27;t make any sense at all&quot;.

==In other media==
===Comic books===
Starting in 1985, Star Comics, an imprint of Marvel Comics, began producing comic books titled &quot;Heathcliff&quot;. The series ran for 56 issues, changing to the Marvel Comics brand with issue #23. Star Comics added an additional spin-off title in 1987 called &quot;Heathcliff&#x27;s Funhouse&quot; (which also switched over to Marvel with issue #6). It was a combination of new material and reprinted stories that first appeared in the original &quot;Heathcliff&quot; title. In the comics, Heathcliff had a far better relationship with Mr. Nutmeg, and much of his adventures were done with Mr. Nutmeg&#x27;s grandson. Heathcliff&#x27;s reputation for adventurism was even noted by the local police, who recruited him for a sting operation against a gang of cats stealing purses, in exchange for them forgiving the fact Heathcliff swiped shellfish. Within the Marvel Comics multiverse, Heathcliff&#x27;s reality is designated as Earth-85481.

===Animated series===

Two animated TV series based on the strip, both simply named &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, were created. Although Heathcliff does not speak in the comic strip, both animated versions of the character were voiced by Mel Blanc. Heathcliff was one of the last original characters Blanc voiced before his death in 1989.

The first &quot;Heathcliff&quot; was produced by Ruby-Spears Productions and debuted in 1980. The first season featured segments with Dingbat and the Creeps (Dingbat is the vampire dog (Frank Welker) accompanied by Spare Rib the skeleton and Nobody the jack-o-lantern who were both voiced by Don Messick), which were created by Ruby-Spears for the show, and the second season featured fellow comic strip character Marmaduke (voiced by Paul Winchell). This version is sometimes seen on Boomerang.

In 1984, the second &quot;Heathcliff&quot; debuted, which was produced by DIC Entertainment. This series featured segments with the Catillac Cats (AKA Cats and Co. by the end credits of the show), which is why this version is sometimes referred to as &quot;Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats&quot;. In 2005, Shout! Factory released a Volume 1 DVD for the show, featuring the first 24 episodes of the series. Since then, Mill Creek Entertainment has gained the license and released the show on DVD, with a ten-episode best-of compilation entitled &quot;King of the Beasts&quot; and two volumes that cover Season 1; volume 1 contains 32 episodes, while volume 2 has the remaining 33.

In 2021, the film and TV rights of Heathcliff were acquired by Legendary.

===Film===
In 1986, &quot;&quot; debuted in theaters. It was an anthology film which consisted of seven episodes from the 1984 series. The film was released on VHS by Paramount Home Video in 1988.

In the 2007 Argentine-Italian animated film &quot;Noah&#x27;s Ark&quot;, a character looking like Heathcliff pops up in a crowd scene with the other animals.

A CGI-animated Heathcliff film was in development for several years. In 2010, a trailer for &quot;Heathcliff in Bad Kitty&quot; was released, but the movie itself never materialized. 

As of 2021, Legendary Entertainment has plans to simultaneously develop a TV series and film based on the &quot;Heathcliff&quot; comics. Gallagher will produce the film alongside Steve Waterman.

<doc id="927017" wikidata="Q4231817" url="?curid=927017" title="Attribute clash">
<text>Attribute clash (also known as colour clash or bleeding) is a display artifact caused by limits in the graphics circuitry of some colour 8-bit home computers, most notably the ZX Spectrum, where it meant that only two colours could be used in any 8×8 tile of pixels. The effect was also noticeable on MSX software and in some Commodore 64 titles. Workarounds to prevent this limit from becoming apparent have since been considered an element of Spectrum programmer culture.

This problem also happens with the &quot;semigraphic modes&quot; (text modes with graphics features) of the Color Computer and Dragon, but those computers also have non-attributed graphics and with better resolution. Several video game consoles of the era had such video modes that caused such limitations, but usually allowed more than two colours per tile: the NES (Famicom) had only one mode, which was also &quot;semigraphic&quot;, and allowed four colours per 16×16 &quot;block&quot; (group of four 8×8 tile) but 16 per screen. The Super NES allowed 16 colours per tile but 256 per screen (among other improvements), and this made the artefact much harder to notice, if at all (except for those who had to program the device).

==Causes==
Attribute clash on the ZX Spectrum was caused by its idiosyncratic display memory layout, designed in such a way as to minimise memory use of the frame buffer, and optimise for text display instead of graphics. Rather than limit the colour palette to conserve memory, Sinclair&#x27;s design stored pixel bitmap and colour information in separate areas of memory. While the bitmap specified the state of individual pixels (either on or off), the colour information (or &quot;attributes&quot;) corresponded to the text character matrix—24 rows of 32 columns—with one byte per 8x8 pixel character cell. This byte encoded two 3-bit values, known as &quot;INK&quot; (foreground colour) and &quot;PAPER&quot; (background colour) after the BASIC instructions used to define the colour values. Two other binary values were included in an attribute; a &quot;BRIGHT&quot; bit indicating one of two brightness levels for the two colours, and a &quot;FLASH&quot; bit, which, when set, caused the two colours to be swapped at regular intervals. This scheme provided 15 different colours: the eight combinations of red, green and blue at two brightness levels (except for black, which appeared the same at both brightness). Thus, each 8x8 pixel block could only contain 2 colours from the 15 available, which must both be from either the BRIGHT or non-BRIGHT halves of the palette. Trying to add a third colour in an 8x8 pixel area would overwrite one of the previous colours. 

The ZX Spectrum used 6144 bytes for the bitmap, with one byte representing eight pixels, and used 768 bytes for the colour attributes. This gives a total of 6912 bytes for the entire graphics display, a relatively small total for a computer of the Spectrum&#x27;s era with &quot;colour&quot; capabilities. This graphics architecture was retained right through to Sinclair and Amstrad&#x27;s later redesigns of the Spectrum, up until Amstrad&#x27;s final model, the ZX Spectrum +3, despite subsequent models having contained 128 KiB of RAM, reducing the need to save memory in this manner. The architecture was retained to prevent loss of backward compatibility.

Attributes were used by a variety of other computers and consoles, including the Commodore 64, the MSX and NES, although the size of the attribute blocks and the number of colours per block varied. However, with the use of hardware sprites, attribute clash could be avoided.

The Thomson MO5 and TO7 microcomputers, the Oric 1, the MSX 1 architecture, and other systems based on the Texas Instruments TMS9918 video display controller display a very similar constraint: for each group of eight pixels horizontally, only two colours out of 16 are available, giving a similar but less severe effect than with the Spectrum. The MSX 1 did not have just one single colour attribute byte available for a whole 8x8 pixel area, as was the case with the Sinclair Spectrum, but eight, with one attribute byte for each 8×1 pixel group. Thus, while the Spectrum was limited to one colour pair for a square area of 8x8 pixels, the MSX 1 was only limited to one colour pair for a &quot;line&quot; of eight adjacent pixels. In addition MSX1 could use sprites which were not bound to any attribute clash problems (although MSX 1 sprites did have their own limitations, such as being monochrome). 

In practice this technical advantage often did not help MSX 1 systems to produce better pictures. The problem for the MSX 1 was that many European software companies who converted Spectrum games to MSX 1 ignored all the improvements the MSX 1 had over the Spectrum, and thus the resulting MSX 1 versions had the same amount of attribute clash as the original Spectrum games (&quot;Jack the Nipper II: In Coconut Capers&quot; is one example of this). To ease conversion, the software developers simply copied the single attribute byte value of the Spectrum to all eight corresponding attribute bytes of the MSX 1. For the same reason, the software companies also ignored the sprite capabilities of the MSX 1, and because the video display capabilities were otherwise quite similar (256×192 resolution, 16 colours), both systems produced virtually identical displays for the same game. In contrast, Japanese MSX 1 games did use all the capabilities of MSX 1, often resulting in better looking games.

==Effects==
To avoid attribute clash, static graphic displays had to be constructed with care. Finely-detailed colour graphics were impossible, as colour could only be applied in 8×8 pixel blocks. Careful design could achieve impressive results, as could synchronising colour changes to the refresh rate of the display—usually a television set.

However, animated displays were more difficult—a distinct drawback in a machine whose primary use was playing video games. If just one pixel in an 8×8 block was recoloured because a moving part of the display touched it, the entire block would change colour. Thus detailed moving graphics caused large ugly fringes of rapidly changing colours to follow them around.

==Workarounds==
Early software simply ignored the problem. Later, the standard workaround was to use colour for static display elements—such as a decorative border around the edges of the screen, which might include score displays and so on, or some form of instrumentation—with a smaller central monochrome area containing all the animated graphics. This also made graphics faster, as less of the screen had to be updated—both a smaller region, plus only changing pixel information and leaving the colour area untouched.

Some Spectrum software, such as FTL&#x27;s &quot;Light Force&quot;, used extremely careful graphics design to achieve full-colour moving graphics, essentially by limiting both the design of the onscreen elements and their paths of motion to 8×8 colour resolution boundaries. The moving elements were thus relatively large and rather blocky or squarish, and their movement was constrained, but this was not visually obvious and the sight of moving full-colour graphics was hugely impressive to Spectrum owners.

No mainstream developers were able to find a suitable all-round fix for the attribute clash problem, instead preferring to use the monochrome graphics method when fast, clear graphics were needed, and full-colour graphics when the situation permitted.

It was possible by paying careful attention to timing to modify the attribute area of RAM at certain specific times as the display was drawn - let the display hardware draw one line of the display, then change the attribute RAM before the next line is drawn to give the effect of different attributes for each individual line. These changes had to be done in software and were time-consuming to program, meaning that this technique was usually limited to special effects. This technique was also very popular in the demoscene.

==The problem and solutions==
Most games before 1987 ignored attribute clash. Some later games, such as &quot;Knight Tyme&quot; and &quot;Three Weeks in Paradise&quot; allowed players to select between two modes of attribute clash: one which ignored main character attributes, blending the character into the background and vice versa, prioritising the characters colour scheme over the background imagery.

Another workaround was to simply render the graphics in two colours, otherwise known as monochrome, as done with the Spectrum version of &quot;Knight Lore&quot; in 1984.

Many games used full-colour backgrounds and &quot;character scrolling&quot; (where the environment was scrolled eight pixels at a time), but monochrome sprites that were effectively transparent, as in &quot;Double Dragon&quot;, were drawn in such a way so they stand out, avoiding dependence on colour. Many games used this method with smooth pixel-by-pixel scrolling, but the attribute clash as elements of one character block were &quot;passed&quot; to the next were clearly visible.

A prominent (and less successful) example of the use of full-colour graphics was the Spectrum conversion of &quot;Altered Beast&quot;. The game suffers from considerable attribute clash.

Programmer Don Priestley developed a distinctive style for several of his games by using large, cartoon-like sprites which were carefully designed to span whole character blocks without appearing unduly square. A disadvantage of this technique was that the gameplay had to be designed around the graphics, and so it was not useful for ports from other platforms. Games that used this technique included &quot;Popeye&quot;, &quot;The Trap Door&quot;, &quot;Through the Trapdoor&quot;, and &quot;Flunky&quot;. Other developers who used a similar technique included Mike Singleton, with &quot;Dark Sceptre&quot;, and Gang of Five, with &quot;Dan Dare: Pilot of the Future&quot;.

In 1994, programmer Igor Maznitsa developed a multi-CPU concept platform &quot;ZX-Poly&quot; based on ZX-Spectrum-128; the platform allows for avoidance of attribute clash, and can even colourise many old games without changes in executable code.

<text>Hieros gamos, (from and &#x27;marriage&#x27;) or hierogamy (, &#x27;holy marriage&#x27;) is a sacred marriage that takes place between gods, especially when enacted in a symbolic ritual where human participants represent the deities.

The notion of &quot;hieros gamos&quot; does not always presuppose literal sexual intercourse in ritual, but is also used in purely symbolic or mythological contexts, notably in alchemy and hence in Jungian psychology. &quot;Hieros gamos&quot; is described as the prototype of fertility rituals.

==Ancient Near East==

Sacred sexual intercourse is thought to have been common in the Ancient Near East as a form of &quot;Sacred Marriage&quot; or hieros gamos between the kings of a Sumerian city-state and the High Priestesses of Inanna, the Sumerian goddess of love, fertility and warfare. Along the Tigris and Euphrates rivers there were many shrines and temples dedicated to Inanna. The temple of Eanna, meaning &quot;house of heaven&quot; in Uruk was the greatest of these. The temple housed Nadītu, priestesses of the goddess. The high priestess would choose for her bed a young man who represented the shepherd Dumuzid, consort of Inanna, in a hieros gamos celebrated during the annual Duku ceremony, just before Invisible Moon, with the autumn Equinox (Autumnal Zag-mu Festival).

==Greek mythology==
In Greek mythology, the classic instance is the wedding of Zeus and Hera celebrated at the Heraion of Samos, along with its architectural and cultural predecessors. Some scholars would restrict the term to reenactments, but most accept its extension to real or simulated union in the promotion of fertility: such an ancient union of Demeter with Iasion, enacted in a thrice-ploughed furrow, a primitive aspect of a sexually-active Demeter reported by Hesiod, occurred in Crete, origin of much early Greek myth. In actual &quot;cultus&quot;, Walter Burkert found the Greek evidence &quot;scanty and unclear&quot;: &quot;To what extent such a sacred marriage was not just a way of viewing nature, but an act expressed or hinted at in ritual is difficult to say&quot;. The best-known ritual example surviving in classical Greece is the &quot;hieros gamos&quot; enacted at the Anthesteria by the wife of the &quot;Archon basileus&quot;, the &quot;Archon King&quot; in Athens, originally therefore the queen of Athens, with Dionysus, presumably represented by his priest or the &quot;basileus&quot; himself, in the Boukoleion in the Agora.

The brief fertilizing mystical union engenders Dionysus, and doubled unions, of a god and of a mortal man on one night, result, through telegony, in the semi-divine nature of Greek heroes such as Theseus and Heracles.

==Tantric Buddhism==
In Tantric Buddhism of Nepal, Bhutan, India and Tibet, yab-yum is a ritual of the male deity in union with a female deity as his consort. The symbolism is associated with Anuttarayoga tantra where the male figure is usually linked to compassion (&quot;&quot;) and skillful means (&quot;upāya-kauśalya&quot;), and the female partner to &#x27;insight&#x27; or &#x27;wisdom&#x27; (&quot;prajñā&quot;). Yab-yum is generally understood to represent the primordial (or mystical) union of wisdom and compassion.

Maithuna is a Sanskrit term used in Tantra most often translated as sexual union in a ritual context. It is the most important of the five Panchamakara and constitutes the main part of the Grand Ritual of Tantra variously known as Panchamakara, Panchatattva, and Tattva Chakra.

The symbolism of union and polarity is a central teaching in Tantric Buddhism, especially in Tibet. The union is realized by the practitioner as a mystical experience within one&#x27;s own body.

==Alchemy and Jungian psychology==

The hieros gamos is one of the themes that Carl Jung dealt with in his book &quot;Symbols of Transformation&quot;.

==Wicca==

In Wicca, the Great Rite is a ritual based on the Hieros Gamos. It is generally enacted symbolically by a dagger (known as an athame) being placed point first into a chalice, the action symbolizing the union of the male and female divine. In British Traditional Wicca, the Great Rite is sometimes carried out in actuality by the High Priest and High Priestess.

<doc id="927027" wikidata="Q58681" url="?curid=927027" title="Oskar Dirlewanger">
<text>Oskar Dirlewanger (26 September 1895 – ) was a German SS commander and habitual offender, convicted for rape of children and other crimes. He is known for committing numerous war crimes and atrocities in German-occupied territories during World War II. Dirlewanger was the founder and commander of the SS penal unit, the Dirlewanger Brigade, considered to be the most brutal and notorious Waffen-SS unit. His unit epitomized the expansion of the war of terror in its most brutal form within the SS, and with Dirlewanger himself regarded as perhaps the Nazi regime&#x27;s &quot;most extreme executioner,&quot; indulging himself in sadistic acts of violence, rape and murder. 

While serving in Poland and Belarus, Dirlewanger has been closely linked to many atrocities, with his unit being responsible for the deaths of at least &quot;tens of thousands&quot; in Poland and the Soviet Union. His methods included rape and torture, and he personally kept numerous women as his sex slaves. According to historian Christian Ingrao, Dirlewanger&#x27;s unit committed the worst atrocities of the Second World War, while the historian Timothy Snyder stated that they committed more atrocities than any other. In Belarus alone, he was responsible for up to 200 villages destroyed and over 120,000 people killed. His unit is also noted to have committed the worst crimes of the Warsaw Uprising, alongside the notorious and brutal Kaminski Brigade, with his unit&#x27;s behavior and conduct reported as having been far worse. Dirlewanger&#x27;s brutality was not limited to civilians and enemy combatants, as he was ruthless to his men, whom he would beat and shoot dead if they displeased him. His unit is regarded as the most infamous Waffen-SS unit in both Poland and Belarus, and arguably the worst military unit in modern European history based in terms of criminality and cruelty. 

Dirlewanger had an impressive career as a junior officer during World War I, and further fought in the post-World War I conflicts, being a part of the &quot;Freikorps&quot;, with the troops he led then also characterized by excessive violence, and the Spanish Civil War. He reportedly died after World War II while in the custody of the Western Allies. 

According to the historian Timothy Snyder, &quot;in all the theaters of the Second World War, few could compete in cruelty with Oskar Dirlewanger.&quot; He has also been described as the &quot;most evil man in the SS&quot; and as &quot;perhaps the most sadistic of all commanders of World War II.&quot; Military historian Tim Heath states Dirlewanger to be &quot;a man whom many describe as one of the most evil and depraved figures not only within the Nazi Third Reich, but throughout history itself&quot;, while the military historian Nash Douglas similarly stated that Dirlewanger was &quot;one of the most heinous criminals in military history&quot;. The Canadian historian Alexandra Richie noted how the murder &quot;of partisans and civilians was carried out on a grand scale in Byelorussia&quot; but said that &quot;one person who stood out even in that terrible time was Oskar Dirlewanger&quot; and labeled Dirlewanger as &quot;the very face of evil&quot;.

==Early life==
Dirlewanger was born in Würzburg on 26 September 1895. He was the son of August Dirlewanger, a wealthy sales agent, and his wife Paulina (née Herrlinger). The Dirlewanger family was of Swabian origin. He spent much of his childhood in Esslingen am Neckar after his family moved there in 1906. He attended the Esslinger Gymnasium (known today as the Georgii-Gymnasium) and the Schelztor-Oberrealschule. He completed his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1913.

Dirlewanger never married and he stood six feet tall.

==World War I==
Dirlewanger enlisted in the Württemberg Army on 1 October 1913, and served as a machine gunner in the &quot;König Karl&quot; Grenadier Regiment 123, a part of the XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps and as a one-year volunteer. With the outbreak of the First World War, on 2 August 1914, Dirlewanger, as part of the regiment, which was part of Crown Prince Wilhelm&#x27;s 5th Army, was sent to the Western Front, where he took part in the Battle of the Ardennes and later fought in France and Luxembourg. While serving on the Western Front, Dirlewanger was wounded several times, as a result of which he became &quot;40 percent disabled.&quot;

He received the Iron Cross 2nd Class and 1st Class, having been wounded six times, and finished the war with the rank of lieutenant, in charge of a company on the Eastern Front in southern Russia and Romania. At the cessation of hostilities, Dirlewanger&#x27;s battalion was supposed to be interned in Romania, but Dirlewanger decided to return his unit to Germany, and led 600 men from his company and other battalion units home. According to German biographer Knut Stang, the war was a contributing factor that determined Dirlewanger&#x27;s later life and his &quot;terror warfare&quot; methods, as &quot;his amoral personality, with his alcoholism and his sadistic sexual orientation, was additionally shattered by the front experiences of the First World War and its frenzied violence and barbarism.&quot;

==Interwar period==
By the end of World War I, Dirlewanger was described in one police report as &quot;a mentally unstable, violent fanatic and alcoholic, who had the habit of erupting into violence under the influence of drugs&quot;. The fact that he had succeeded, even after the ceasefire, in fighting his way back from the front in Romania to Germany with his men became for him the defining experience. Henceforth he adopted an unrestrained mode of life, characterized by contempt for the laws and rules of civil society. In 1919, he joined various &quot;Freikorps&quot; paramilitary militias and fought against German communists in Thuringia, Ruhr, and Saxony, and against Poles in Upper Silesia. He participated in the suppression of the German Revolution of 1918–19 with the &quot;Freikorps&quot; in multiple German cities in 1920 and 1921. At the same time, he studied at the Higher Commercial School in Mannheim, but was expelled from it for antisemitism. Later, he commanded an armed formation of students which was set up by him under the Württemberg &quot;Highway Watch&quot;.

On Easter Sunday 1921, Dirlewanger commanded an armoured train that moved towards Sangerhausen, which had been occupied by the Communist Party of Germany militia group of Max Hoelz in one of their raids intended to inspire worker uprisings. An attack by Dirlewanger failed, and the enemy militiamen succeeded in cutting off his force. After the latter was reinforced by pro-government troops during the night, the Communists withdrew from the town. During this operation, Dirlewanger was grazed on the head by a gunshot. After the Nazi Party gained power, Dirlewanger was celebrated as the town&#x27;s &quot;liberator from the Red terrorists&quot; and received its honorary citizenship in 1935.

Between his militant forays, he studied at the Goethe University Frankfurt and in 1922 obtained a doctorate in political science (Dr. rer. pol.). He wrote his doctoral thesis as an analysis and critique of the planned economy, titled: “Critique of the idea of a planned management of the economy.&quot; The following year, he joined the Nazi Party and its SA militia, and later also the SS. From 1928 to 1931 he was an executive director of a textile factory owned by a Jewish family in Erfurt where he renounced active service in the SA but financially donated to the SA, possibly obtaining the money by embezzling from his company. Dirlewanger held various jobs, which included working at a bank and a knitwear factory. In 1933 after the Nazi seizure of power, Dirlewanger was rewarded by being made director of the Heilbronn employment agency, a strategic post for local-level Nazi leaders.

Dirlewanger was repeatedly convicted for illegal arms possession and embezzlement. In 1934, he was convicted and sentenced to two years&#x27; imprisonment for &quot;contributing to the delinquency of a minor with whom he was sexually involved&quot;. Dirlewanger also lost his job, his doctor title and all military honours, and was expelled from the party. Soon after his release from the prison in Ludwigsburg, he was arrested again on the same charge and sent to the Welzheim concentration camp, but more likely it was for creating a disturbance before the Reich Chancellery, demanding the reversal of his criminal charges. Dirlewanger was released and reinstated in the general reserve of the SS following personal intervention of his wartime companion and local NSDAP cadre comrade Gottlob Berger, who was also a long-time personal friend of &quot;Reichsführer-SS&quot; Heinrich Himmler and had become the head of the SS Main Office (&quot;SS-Hauptamt&quot;, SS-HA).

Dirlewanger next went to Spain, where he enlisted into the Spanish Legion during the Spanish Civil War. Through Berger he transferred to the German Condor Legion where he served from 1936 to 1939 and was wounded three times. Following further intervention on his behalf by his patron Berger, he successfully petitioned to have his case reconsidered in light of his service in Spain. Dirlewanger was reinstated into the NSDAP, albeit with a higher party number (No. 1,098,716). His doctorate was also restored by the University of Frankfurt.

==World War II==

At the beginning of World War II, Dirlewanger volunteered for the Waffen-SS and received the rank of &quot;Obersturmführer&quot;. On 4 June 1940, Berger proposed to Himmler that Dirlewanger be appointed commander of a special SS unit: the so-called Dirlewanger Brigade (at first designated as a battalion, later expanded to a regiment and a brigade, and eventually a division), composed originally of a small group of former poachers along with soldiers of a more conventional background. It was believed that the excellent tracking and shooting skills of the poachers could be put to constructive use in the fight against partisans. The unit was created and Dirlewanger was given the task of conducting military training among poachers serving their sentences in the Sachsenhausen concentration camp near Berlin. Despite Himmler preferring executioners who exhibited self-control and were efficient while appearing humane, he was not opposed to &quot;lowering his bar and hiring a sadistic psychopath and convicted pedophile like Oskar Dirlewanger.&quot;

The unit was assigned to security duties first in the General Government (occupied Poland), where Dirlewanger served as an SS-TV commandant of a labour camp at Stary Dzików. The camp was the subject of an abuse investigation by SS judge Georg Konrad Morgen, who accused Dirlewanger of wanton acts of murder, corruption, and &quot;Rassenschande&quot; or race defilement with a Jewish woman named Sarah Bergmann (Morgen consequently himself was reduced in rank and sent to the Eastern Front). According to Morgen, &quot;Dirlewanger was a nuisance and a terror to the entire population. He repeatedly pillaged the ghetto in Lublin, extorting ransoms.&quot; Atrocities committed by Dirlewanger include burning the genitals of women he abused with a petrol lighter, whipping and then injecting strychnine into Jewish girls and watching their death agonies in the officers&#x27; mess. He would often rape children, whether boy or girl, and then shoot them afterwards. The Jewish girls which Dirlewanger raped were taken away and shot by his men so they could not report him nor testify. One day Dirlewanger poisoned 57 Jews by his own initiative. He encouraged his soldiers to rape dying women. Raul Hilberg noted that this camp was where &quot;one of the first instances that reference was made to the &#x27;soap-making rumor&quot;. According to the rumor, Dirlewanger &quot;cut up Jewish women and boiled them with horse meat to make soap.&quot; Georg Konrad Morgen, who investigated the conduct of Dirlewanger, testified after the end of the war that:According to Peter Longerich, &quot;Dirlewanger&#x27;s leadership of the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; was characterized by continued alcohol abuse, looting, sadistic atrocities, rape, and murder—and his mentor Berger tolerated this behaviour, as did Himmler, who so urgently needed men such as the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; Dirlewanger in his fight against &#x27;subhumanity&#x27;. It was important to the Reichsführer, however, that the detachments within the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; did not belong to the Waffen SS, but merely serve it. In his letter to Himmler, &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Odilo Globocnik recommended Dirlewanger, who &quot;... when in charge of the Jewish camp of Dzikow ... was an excellent leader.&quot; During the Ministries Trial after the war, Berger said: &quot;Now Dr. Dirlewanger was hardly a good boy. You can&#x27;t say that. But he was a good soldier, and he had one big mistake that he didn&#x27;t know when to stop drinking.&quot; He was brutal towards his own men, bringing them into line by involving himself in the murderous deeds of the soldiers, otherwise using draconian methods which disregarded military criminal law, and arbitrarily beat and killed his own men. He was described by the American historian Richard C. Lukas as &quot;an ascetic-looking man who treated his own men as brutally as he treated the Poles. Beating them with clubs to maintain discipline was not uncommon. He even casually shot men he did not like.&quot; Another one of Dirlewanger&#x27;s punishments included the &quot;Dirlewanger coffin&quot;, in which a soldier could be locked up in a narrow box for days. American historian Richard Rhodes wrote how the &quot;resulting organization was so vicious – enthusiastically extorting, raping, torturing and murdering Poles and Jews – that it even disgusted men like Globocnik, who had it transferred out of the General Government and into Byelorussia to fight partisans&quot;.

In February 1942, the unit was assigned to &quot;anti-gang&quot; operations (&quot;Bandenbekämpfung&quot;) in Belarus. Historian Timothy Snyder described how &quot;Dirlewanger&#x27;s preferred method was to herd the local population inside a barn, set the barn on fire, and then shoot with machine guns anyone who tried to escape.&quot; One incident recounted by Hans-Peter Klausch described how a village of around 2,500 were put into several barns, with Dirlewanger ordering his men to shoot them all after opening the barns, and then setting the barns on fire, shooting and killing everyone who was able to escape, with Dirlewanger himself at the forefront of the massacre. Rounded-up civilians were routinely used as human shields and marched over minefields. At least 30,000 Belarusian civilians were killed, with up to 200 villages destroyed and more than 120,000 killed under Dirlewanger&#x27;s orders. Dirlewanger also kept a private harem of multiple women for his own use. Despite Himmler being aware of Dirlewanger&#x27;s reputation and record, nonetheless he was awarded the German Cross in Gold on 5 December 1943, for his unit&#x27;s actions such as during Operation Cottbus (May–June 1943), during which Dirlewanger reportedly killed more than 14,000 alleged partisans. 

Wilhelm Kube, the &quot;Generalkommissar&quot; for &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot;, noted the effects of that Dirlewanger and others had in Belarus, stating that: 
In the summer of 1944, during Operation Bagration, Standartenfuhrer (Colonel) Dirlewanger&#x27;s unit suffered heavy losses while fighting against the Red Army. It was then hastily rebuilt and reformed into a &quot;Sturmbrigade&quot; (assault brigade) and used in the suppression of the Warsaw Uprising. Author Martin Windrow wrote that &quot;in summer &#x27;44 Dirlewanger led his 4,000 butchers, rapists and looters into action against the Warsaw Uprising, and quickly committed such unspeakable crimes that both Army and SS commanders successfully demanded the unit&#x27;s withdrawal.&quot; In Warsaw, &quot;Dirlewanger&quot; participated in the Wola massacre, together with police units. The role of &quot;Dirlewanger&quot; in the beginning days of the Wola massacre may have been limited, and Dirlewanger himself may not have arrived until 7 August. It was reported in the same Wola district that Dirlewanger burned three hospitals with patients inside while the nurses were &quot;whipped, gang-raped and finally hanged naked, together with the doctors&quot; to the accompaniment of the popular song &quot;In München steht ein Hofbräuhaus&quot;. Later on, the soldiers &quot;drank, raped, and murdered their way through the Old Town, slaughtering civilians and fighters alike without distinction of age or sex.&quot; In the Old Town – where about 30,000 civilians were killed – several thousand wounded in field hospitals overrun by the Germans were shot and set on fire with flamethrowers. In the defeat of the Uprising, it was reported that the &quot;Dirlewanger Brigade burned prisoners alive with gasoline, impaled babies on bayonets and stuck them out of windows and hung women upside down from balconies&quot;. The brutality of Dirlewanger himself was described by Mathias Schenck, a Belgian national who was serving in the area as a German Army sapper, saying that &quot;There is also that small child in Dirlewanger’s hands. He took it from a woman who was standing in the crowd in the street. He lifted the child high and then threw it into the fire. Then he shot the mother.&quot; Dirlewanger also had a habit of hanging people every Thursday, whether it be Poles or his own men, often being the one to kick the chair out from underneath them according to Schenck. Schenck described another incident involving the massacre of children, stating that:

&quot;SS-Obergruppenführer&quot; Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski, overall commander of the forces pacifying Warsaw – and Dirlewanger&#x27;s former superior officer in Belarus – described Dirlewanger as having &quot;a typical mercenary nature&quot;. Hermann Fegelein, a member of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s entourage and a liaison officer of the Waffen-SS, described Dirlewanger&#x27;s men as &quot;real hoodlums&quot;.

Dirlewanger gained a notorious reputation for his brutality in suppressing the Warsaw Uprising, as he became known as the &quot;Executioner of the Warsaw Uprising&quot;.

In recognition of his work to crush the uprising and intimidate the population of the city, Dirlewanger received his final promotion, to the rank of &quot;SS-Oberführer (Colonel/Brigadier)&quot;, on 15 August 1944. In October, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross, recommended for it by his superior officer in Warsaw, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Heinz Reinefarth (after the war, Reinefarth lied about his role in Warsaw, even denying Dirlewanger had been under his command).

Dirlewanger then led his men in joining the efforts to put down the Slovak National Uprising in October 1944, where similar atrocities were committed. Eventually he and his men were posted on the front lines of Hungary and eastern Germany to fight against the advancing Red Army. In February 1945, the unit was expanded again and re-designated as the 36th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS. That same month, Dirlewanger was shot in the chest while fighting against Soviet forces near Guben in Brandenburg and sent to the rear. It was his twelfth and final injury in the war. On 22 April, he went into hiding.

===Assessment===
Despite being an accomplished soldier who was considered quite brave, Dirlewanger is invariably described as an extremely cruel person by historians and researchers, such as being called &quot;a psychopathic killer and child molester&quot; by Steven Zaloga, &quot;a professional killer, fully malefic&quot; by Richard Rhodes, &quot;a sadist and necrophiliac&quot; by Bryan Mark Rigg, &quot;an expert in extermination and a devotee of sadism and necrophilia&quot; by J. Bowyer Bell, and as a &quot;sadistic, amoral alcoholic&quot; by Knut Stang. The historian Richard C. Lukas also stated that &quot;Oskar Dirlewanger was one of those degenerates who, in saner days, would have been court-martialed out of the German army&quot; and &quot;a sadist whose brutality was well known.&quot; According to Alan Clark, Dirlewanger&#x27;s &quot;experiments on Polish girls are hardly printable even today, combining as they did the indulgence of both sadism and necrophilia.&quot; Professor Nikolaus Wachsmann called him &quot;one of the most odious characters in the pantheon of SS villains&quot;. Military historian Tim Heath states &quot;Dirlewanger was without any doubt one of the most evil, sadistic and sexually depraved individuals in the Third Reich. His appetite for alcohol, rape, sadism and violence shocked even the most hardline Nazis.&quot;

Military historian Samuel W. Mitcham Jr wrote that Oskar Dirlewanger was &quot;a sexually perverted drunkard who enjoyed performing unnatural acts with the dead bodies of his victims, especially the younger ones.&quot; However, there has been some skepticism pointed towards the accusations of necrophilia with Heath saying that despite his career being characterized by &quot;child rape, murder, perversion, sadism and alcoholism,&quot; there has been no proven evidence of necrophilia and that &quot;one can only assume that such assumptions are the result of literary fabrication.&quot; Despite this, Heath declares that Dirlewanger was &quot;a living embodiment of evil and depravity and all the proof that anyone could need that monsters do exist.&quot;

===Death===
Dirlewanger was arrested on 1 June 1945 near the town of Altshausen in Upper Swabia by French occupation zone authorities while he was wearing civilian clothes, using a false name, and hiding in a remote hunting lodge. He was recognised by a Jewish former concentration camp inmate and brought to a detention centre. He reportedly died around 5–7 June 1945 in a prison camp at Altshausen, probably as a result of ill treatment. There are numerous conflicting reports of the nature of his death: the French said that he died of a heart attack and was buried in an unmarked grave; or he was taken by armed Poles, presumably former forced laborers; or French military prisoners (of Polish descent); or Polish soldiers (&quot;29 Groupement d&#x27;Infanterie polonaise&quot;), who were mistreated in custody; or former inmates and prison guards; or that he escaped and joined the French Foreign Legion. Ultimately his fate is unknown, but it is generally considered most likely that he died at Altshausen.

According to the political scientist Martin A. Lee, as well as the historians Angelo de Boca and Mario Giovana, Dirlewanger survived the war and subsequently lived in Egypt tutoring the guards who provided security to the president Gamal Abdel Nasser.

<text>Jean François Paschal Grousset (7 April 1844, in Corte – 9 April 1909, in Paris) was a French politician, journalist, translator and science fiction writer. Grousset published under the pseudonyms of André Laurie, Philippe Daryl, Tiburce Moray and Léopold Virey.

==Life and career==
Grousset was born in Corte, Corsica, and studied medicine before commencing a journalistic career. In 1869 he began working for the weekly newspaper &quot;La Marseillaise&quot;, writing pro-revolutionary articles. As a result of an attempt by Grousset to challenge Pierre Napoleon Bonaparte to a duel during 1870, Grousset&#x27;s second, Victor Noir, was shot and killed by Bonaparte during a quarrel. Later the same year Grousset was sentenced to six months imprisonment. He was elected a member of the Paris Commune, becoming a member of its executive committee and Delegate for External Affairs.

After the fall of the Commune, he was arrested and, in 1872, he was deported to New Caledonia. He escaped, and lived in Sydney, San Francisco, New York City and London, making a living by teaching French. He returned to France after the 1880 amnesty, becoming involved in literature and physical culture, but eventually returning to politics and, in 1893, becoming a Socialist Deputy for the 12th arrondissement of Paris.

Like Jules Verne, he was another discovery of publisher Pierre-Jules Hetzel. He &quot;collaborated&quot; with Verne on &quot;Les Cinq Cent Millions de la Begum&quot; (1879), &quot;L&#x27;Étoile du Sud&quot; (1884) and &quot;L&#x27;Épave du Cynthia&quot; (1885). Some scholars believe that these works were based on manuscripts written by Grousset and rewritten by Verne at Hetzel&#x27;s request.

==Notable works==
One of Grousset&#x27;s most notable science fiction novels was &quot;Les Exilés de la Terre – Selene-Company Limited&quot; (1887). In it, a consortium which intends to exploit the Moon’s mineral resources decides that, since our satellite is too far to be reached, it must be brought closer to the Earth. A Sudanese mountain composed of pure iron ore becomes the headquarters of the newly established Selene Company. Solar reflectors are used to provide the energy required to convert the mountain into a huge electro-magnet, with miles of cables wrapped around it. A spaceship-observatory is then built on top of the mountain. When the experiment begins, the mountain is ripped away from the Earth and catapulted to the Moon. There, the protagonists have various adventures and eventually return to Earth by re-energizing the mountain.

Other notable works by Grousset published under the Laurie pseudonym include &quot;De New York à Brest en Sept Heures&quot; [New York to Brest in Seven Hours] (1888), which predicted a transatlantic tunnel; &quot;Le Secret du Mage&quot; (The Secret of the Magician) (1890), in which evidence of an advanced prehistoric is discovered; &quot;Le Rubis du Grand Lama&quot; [The Ruby of the Great Lama] (1894), which features a steam-powered flying island; &quot;Atlantis&quot; (1895), which describes how the mythical kingdom has survived under a glass dome at the bottom of the sea near the Azores; &quot;Le Maître de l&#x27;Abîme&quot; (The Master of the Abyss) (1905), which features a revolutionary submarine, and finally &quot;Spiridon le Muet&quot; (Spiridon The Mute) (1907), a novel about a human-sized, intelligent ant. The character of Spiridon, depicted as a non-human alien, gifted with great knowledge, an insatiable scientific curiosity but no human feelings or emotions, the victim of mankind&#x27;s petty jealousies and racial fears, is a striking departure from the Vernian influence that permeated the rest of Laurie&#x27;s works.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Instrumental Album (previously: Best Pop Instrumental Album) is an award presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality instrumental albums in the pop music genre. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented to Joe Jackson in 2001. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented to albums containing &quot;at least 51% playing time of newly recorded pop instrumental tracks&quot;. As of 2025, Larry Carlton, Taylor Eigsti, Béla Fleck, Booker T. Jones, Edgar Meyer and Snarky Puppy are the only musicians to receive the award more than once. (Snarky Puppy has had the most wins, with 4.) Gerald Albright has received the most nominations, with six.

The award goes to the artist, producer and engineer/mixer of more than 50% of playing time on the winning album. A producer or engineer/mixer who worked on less than 50% of playing time, as well as the mastering engineer, can apply for a Winners Certificate.

In 2015, the category was renamed Best Contemporary Instrumental Album and moved from the Pop category field to the Contemporary category field. The category description did not change.

==Recipients==



 Each year is linked to the article about the Grammy Awards held that year.
 An award was presented to James R. Jensen as the producer of the album.

<text>Héctor Luis Acevedo Pérez (born November 8, 1947) is a Puerto Rican politician from Río Piedras, San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is the son of Héctor N. Acevedo and Toñita Pérez, both public servants. Acevedo has been married to Carmen Roca Saavedra since 1972, with whom he has three children.

==Biography==
Héctor Luis studied in the University of Puerto Rico Elementary School and High School but completed High School in Spain in the America School of Madrid. There he won the Director&#x27;s Cup and the medal in history. He completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree in political science at the University of Puerto Rico with high honors. He obtained his degree in law from the University of Puerto Rico at Ponce in 1972, where he also graduated with honors. Acevedo then entered the United States Army Reserve as a commissioned officer after completing the Army ROTC program. As part of his military functions, he was an instructor in the United States Army Command and General Staff College. Also commanded the 429 Personnel Company. While in university he was elected president of the student council, president of the Alpha Phi Omega fraternity, and in 1967, Lodge Chief of Yokahu Lodge of the Order of the Arrow of the Boy Scouts of America, Puerto Rico Council; was also recognized with the Vigil Honor.

In 1976, he was appointed Electoral Commissioner when he was only twenty-eight years old, making him the youngest person to hold that position. He remained as Electoral Commissioner until 1984. In 1978, he completed the Lawyer&#x27;s Education Program at the Harvard Law School. That same year he began working as an assistant to then-Governor Rafael Hernández Colón.

In 1985 he was appointed Secretary of State. In 1988, he was elected mayor of San Juan in a close race. He was reelected in 1992 by a much larger margin. In 1994, he was elected president of the Popular Democratic Party, and in 1996 he ran unsuccessfully for governor of Puerto Rico, losing by a 51% to 45% margin to Pedro Rosselló. Since then he has dedicated his time to teaching full time at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico. He is also a part-time professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Puerto Rico School of Law. Considered Gov. Jesús T. Piñero&#x27;s principal biographer, he is also contributing to the biography of former Puerto Rico Senate Vice President Luis Negrón López, the PDP&#x27;s 1968 gubernatorial candidate.

He was vice president of the Puerto Rico Council of the Boy Scouts of America.

In 2003 and in 2013, he was appointed President of the Commission for Electoral Finance Reform. Acevedo is known to be an expert in Puerto Rican electoral law.

Currently he lives in Rio Piedras, where he occasionally plays basketball with his youngest son.

==Publications==
Héctor Luis Acevedo has published various articles in law journals and newspapers. In 1996, he published his book &quot;Will Opens Paths&quot; (&quot;La Voluntad Abre Caminos&quot;), and in 1997 &quot;Messages from the Mayor&#x27;s Office&quot; (&quot;Mensajes Desde la Alcaldia&quot;). He has edited two books: &quot;La Generacion del 40 y la Convencion Constituyente&quot; and &quot;Los Administradores en la Modernizacion de Puerto Rico&quot;. He is also the editor of the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico-sponsored biography on Gov. Jesús T. Piñero. He also edited the biography of Sen. Luis Negrón López, published by the Interamerican University Press in September 2007.

Many of these books have been made available for free online on the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico&#x27;s website on the libros para todos (books for everybody) section.

<text>Computer Aided Industrial Design (CAID) is a subset of computer-aided design (CAD) software that can assist in creating the look-and-feel or industrial design aspects of a product in development.

CAID programs tend to provide designers with improved freedom of creativity compared to typical CAD tools. However a typical workflow may follow a simple design methodology as follows:

* Creating sketches, using a stylus
* Generating curves directly from the sketch
* Generating surfaces directly from the curves

The end result is generally a 3D model that represents the main intent of the designer had in mind for the physical product. Such models can then be saved in formats for more convenient exchange with others (such as OBJ for virtual viewing in 3D graphics programs) or manufacturing (such a STL to create a real-life model via a rapid prototyping machine). CAID helps the designer focus on the technical aspect of the design methodology rather than the sketching and modelling aspects, contributing to the selection of a better product proposal in less time. When product pre-requisites and parameters have been more completely defined, output from the CAID software can be imported into a CAD program for pre-production testing, adjustment, and generation of technical drawings and manufacturing data such as CNC tool-paths.

CAID is far more conceptual and less technically focused than CAD. CAID programs tend to offer more tools that allow a designer to freely express themselves with more organic shapes and complex curves, whilst CAD software tends to be more focused on tools for the simple curves and straight lines more suitable for easy manufacturing.

CAD implementations have evolved dramatically since initial 3D offerings in the 1970s, which were typically limited to producing drawings similar to hand-drafted output. Advances in programming and computer hardware,[21][22] notably solid modelling in the 1980s, have allowed more versatile applications of computers in design activities.

<doc id="927051" wikidata="Q374319" url="?curid=927051" title="RYB color model">
<text>RYB (an abbreviation of red–yellow–blue) is a subtractive color model used in art and applied design in which red, yellow, and blue pigments are considered primary colors. Under traditional color theory, this set of primary colors was advocated by Moses Harris, Michel Eugène Chevreul, Johannes Itten and Josef Albers, and applied by countless artists and designers. The RYB color model underpinned the color curriculum of the Bauhaus, Ulm School of Design and numerous art and design schools that were influenced by the Bauhaus, including the IIT Institute of Design (founded as the New Bauhaus), Black Mountain College, Design Department Yale University, the Shillito Design School, Sydney, and Parsons School of Design, New York.

In this context, the term &quot;primary color&quot; refers to three exemplar colors (red, yellow, and blue) as opposed to specific pigments. As illustrated, in the RYB color model, red, yellow, and blue are intermixed to create secondary color segments of orange, green, and purple. This set of primary colors emerged at a time when access to a large range of pigments was limited by availability and cost, and it encouraged artists and designers to explore the many nuances of color through mixing and intermixing a limited range of pigment colors. In art and design education, gray, red, yellow, and blue pigments were usually augmented with white and black pigments, enabling the creation of a larger gamut of color nuances including tints and shades.

Although scientifically obsolete because it does not meet the definition of a complementary color in which a neutral or black color must be mixed, it is still a model used in artistic environments, causing confusion about primary and complementary colors. It can be considered an approximation of the CMY color model.

The RYB color model relates specifically to color in the form of paint and pigment application in art and design. Other common color models include the light model (RGB) and the paint, pigment and ink CMY color model, which is much more accurate in terms of color gamut and intensity compared to the traditional RYB color model, the latter emerging in conjunction with the CMYK color model in the printing industry.

==History==
The first scholars to propose that there are three primary colors for painters were Scarmiglioni (1601), Savot (1609), de Boodt (1609) and Aguilonius (1613). From these, the most influential was the work of Franciscus Aguilonius (1567–1617), although he did not arrange the colors in a wheel.

Jacob Christoph Le Blon was the first to apply the RYB color model to printing, specifically mezzotint printing, and he used separate plates for each color: yellow, red and blue plus black to add shades and contrast. In &#x27;Coloritto&#x27;, Le Blon asserted that “the art of mixing colours…(in) painting can represent all visible objects with three colours: yellow, red and blue; for all colours can be composed of these three, which I call Primitive”. Le Blon added that red and yellow make orange; red and blue, make purple; and blue and yellow make green (Le Blon, 1725, p6).

In the 18th century, Moses Harris advocated that a multitude of colors can be created from three &quot;primitive&quot; colors – red, yellow, and blue.

Mérimée referred to &quot;three simple colours (yellow, red, and blue)&quot; that can produce a large gamut of color nuances. &quot;United in pairs, these three primitive colours give birth to three other colours as distinct and brilliant as their originals; thus, yellow mixed with red, gives orange; red and blue, violet; and green is obtained by mixing blue and yellow&quot; (Mérimée, 1839, p245). Mérimée illustrated these color relationships with a simple diagram located between pages 244 and 245: Chromatic Scale (Echelle Chromatique).&quot;De la peinture à l’huile : ou, Des procédés matériels employés dans ce genre de peinture, depuis Hubert et Jean Van-Eyck jusqu’à nos jours&quot; was published in 1830 and an English translation by W. B. Sarsfield Taylor was published in London in 1839.

Similar ideas about the creation of color using red, yellow, and blue were discussed in &quot;Theory of Colours&quot; (1810) by the German poet, color theorist and government minister Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.

In &quot;The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast&quot; (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul discussed the creation of numerous color nuances and his color theories were underpinned by the RYB color model.

Separate to the RYB color model, cyan, magenta, and yellow primary colors are associated with CMYK commonly used in the printing industry. Cyan, magenta, and yellow are often referred to as &quot;process blue&quot;, &quot;process red&quot;, and &quot;process yellow&quot;.

=== Old model of coloration with four primaries ===
The ancient Greeks, under the influence of Aristotle, Democritus and Plato, considered that there were four basic colors that coincided with the four elements: earth (ochre), sky (blue), water (green) and fire (red), while black and white represented the light of day and the darkness of night. The four-color system is formed by the primaries yellow, green, blue and red, and was supported by Alberti in his &quot;De Pictura&quot; (1436), using the rectangle, rhombus, and color wheel to represent them.
Leonardo da Vinci endorsed this model in 1510, although he hesitated to include green, noting that green could be obtained by mixing blue and yellow. Also Richard Waller, in his &quot;Catalogue of Simple and Mixed Colors&quot; (1686), graphed these four colors in a square. These four colors have often been referred to as &quot;the primary psychological colors&quot;.

=== Traditional coloring with three primaries ===
The first known case of trichromacy coloration (of 3 primaries) can be found in a work on optics by the Belgian thinker Franciscus Aguilonius in 1613, who in his &quot;Opticorum libri sex, philosophis iuxtà ac mathematicis utiles&quot; in Latin (Roughly, &quot;Six books of optics: useful to philosophers as well as to mathematicians&quot;), graphed the colors &quot;flavvus&quot;, &quot;rvbevs&quot; and &quot;cærvlevs&quot; (yellow, red and blue) giving rise to the intermediate colors &quot;avrevs&quot;, &quot;viridis&quot; and &quot;pvrpvrevs&quot; (orange, green and purple) and their relationship with the extremes &quot;albvs&quot; and &quot;niger&quot; (white and black). However, the idea of three primary colors is older, as Aguilonius supported the view known since the Middle Ages that the colors yellow, red, and blue were the basic or &quot;noble&quot; colors from which all others are derived.

This model was used for printing by Jacob Christoph Le Blon in 1725 and called it &quot;Coloritto&quot; or &quot;harmony of colouring&quot;, stating that the primitive (primary) colors are yellow, red and blue, while the secondary are orange, green and purple or violet.

In 1766, Moses Harris developed an 18-color color wheel based on this model, including a wider range of colors by adding light and dark derivatives. During the 18th and 19th centuries, this color model was endorsed by many authors who have left illustrations that can still be appreciated today, such as Louis-Bertrand Castel (1740), the Tobias&#x27;s color system Mayer (1758), Moses Harris (1770–76), Ignaz Schiffermuller (1772), Baumgartner and Muller (1803), Sowerby (1809), Runge (1809), the popular &quot;Theory of Colors&quot; (1810) by Goethe, Gregoire (1810–20), Merimee (1815-30-39), Klotz (1816), G. Field (1817-41-50), Hayter (1826 ), the &quot;Law of Simultaneous Contrast of Colours&quot; (1839) by Chevreul and many others.
By the 20th century, natural pigments gave way to synthetic ones. The invention of phthalocyanine and derivatives of quinacridone, expanded the range of primary blues and reds, getting closer to the ideal subtractive colors and the CMY and CMYK models.

<doc id="927058" wikidata="Q431873" url="?curid=927058" title="The Wolf Man (1941 film)">
<text>The Wolf Man is a 1941 American gothic horror film written by Curt Siodmak and produced and directed by George Waggner. The film stars Lon Chaney Jr. in the title role. Claude Rains, Warren William, Ralph Bellamy, Patric Knowles, Bela Lugosi, Evelyn Ankers, and Maria Ouspenskaya star in supporting roles. The title character has had a great deal of influence on Hollywood&#x27;s depictions of the legend of the werewolf. The film is the second Universal Pictures werewolf film, preceded six years earlier by the less commercially successful &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1935). This film is one of the Universal Monsters movies, and garnered great acclaim for its production.

After this movie&#x27;s success, Lon Chaney Jr. would reprise his role as &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; in four sequels, beginning with &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; in 1943.

==Plot==
Larry Talbot returns to his ancestral home in Llanwelly, Wales, to bury his recently deceased brother and reconcile with his estranged father, Sir John Talbot. Larry falls in love with a local girl named Gwen Conliffe who runs an antique shop. As an excuse to talk to her, he purchases a walking stick decorated with a silver wolf&#x27;s head. Gwen tells him that it represents a werewolf, a man who changes into a wolf &quot;at certain times of the year&quot;. The werewolf always sees a pentagram on the palm of his next victim. Various villagers recite a poem whenever werewolves are mentioned.

Though Gwen firmly refuses Larry&#x27;s persistent proposals for a date, they meet that night at the proposed time, and are joined by Gwen&#x27;s friend Jenny to go have their fortunes told. The Romani fortuneteller, Bela, sees a pentagram when he examines Jenny&#x27;s palm, and frantically sends her away. While awaiting their turns, Larry and Gwen take a walk. Gwen informs Larry that she is engaged. They hear screams from Jenny, who is being attacked by a wolf. Larry attempts to rescue Jenny. He kills the wolf with his new walking stick but is bitten on the chest. Police investigating the scene find Jenny&#x27;s throat torn out and Bela battered to death, with Larry&#x27;s walking stick clearly the murder weapon in the latter case. Suspicion on Larry deepens when he cannot substantiate his story of fighting a wolf, since his chest wound miraculously healed overnight. The fact that Larry and Gwen were not with Jenny when she was attacked additionally raises suspicions of adultery. Though Gwen&#x27;s fiance Frank believes in their innocence, Larry and Gwen become local pariahs.

Bela&#x27;s mother, Maleva, reveals to Larry that the wolf which bit him was Bela in the form of a wolf, and Larry is now a werewolf too because he was bitten by one. Silver is the only thing that can kill a werewolf. Maleva gives him a charm to prevent the transformation. Uncertain whether or not to believe her, he instead gives the charm to Gwen for protection.

Like Maleva warned, Larry transforms into a humanoid wolf hybrid on the following night and kills a villager. He returns to normal the next morning with no memory of his rampage. Authorities believe the killing to be the work of a wolf; they set traps and send out hunting parties. The next night, Larry turns into a werewolf and is caught in one of the traps. Maleva uses a spell to temporarily change him back to human form, allowing him to free himself before a hunting party finds him.

Now convinced he is a werewolf, a distraught Larry decides to leave town. When he says his goodbye to Gwen, he sees a pentagram on her palm. He tells his father he is a werewolf and killed Bela and the villager, but his father thinks Larry is delusional and ties him to a chair to prevent him from leaving and prove to him he is not a werewolf. When the moon rises Larry transforms again, breaks free of his restraints, and attacks Gwen. Not recognizing the werewolf as his son, Sir John bludgeons him over the head with Larry&#x27;s silver-headed cane which Larry gave him. Maleva arrives and again uses the spell. Sir John watches in horror as the dead werewolf transforms into Larry&#x27;s human corpse.

==Themes and interpretations==
In an essay for the 1984 book &quot;Planks of Reason&quot;, academic Bruce F. Kawin wrote that, &quot;&quot;The Wolf Man&quot; expresses and exorcises the Id-force of uncontrolled aggression in its own system (the werewolf), in Larry Talbot (his werewolf phases), and in the community (the destabilizing forces of rape, murder, gypsy liminality, and aristocratic privilege—Talbot often behaves as if he had &quot;droit du seigneur&quot; when courting the engaged Gwen).&quot; In 1995, author Edmund G. Bansak compared Talbot&#x27;s &quot;blindly aggressive drive&quot; in his romantic pursuit of the Welsh Gwen to that of Oliver Reed, a character played by Kent Smith in the 1942 film &quot;Cat People&quot; who courts the Serbian-born Irene Dubrovna (Simone Simon): &quot;neither of these stereotypical All-American males will take no for an answer.&quot;

As with other werewolf films, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; has been analyzed as an allegory for puberty. In his 2012 book &quot;Horror and the Horror Film&quot;, Kawin wrote: &quot;The fear of sexual passion and its ability to bring chaos is part of the arsenal of anxiety inherent to puberty, and the werewolf does, as has been widely noted, grow hair and become subject to animalistic drives as if it were going through puberty. In &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; (1941) as well as in &quot;Cat People&quot; (1942), desire is dangerous. The monster is one&#x27;s animal nature, out of control and making one behave like an animal.&quot;

In 1993, film historian David J. Skal characterized &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; and its sequels as reflecting the anxieties of American audiences amidst World War II, calling the series &quot;an unconscious parable of the war effort&quot; that centers around Talbot&#x27;s &quot;crusade for eternal peace and his frustrated attempts to control irrational, violent European forces.&quot; In his 2004 book &quot;Nightmares in Red, White and Blue&quot;, Joseph Maddrey wrote that the resolution of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; &quot;is not reassuring in the way that earlier Universal horror films, with their distinctly Manichean view of the world, were. Larry Talbot is not torn between forces of good and evil; he is a victim of a cruel or indifferent fate in a less comprehensible world.&quot;

==Production ==
=== Special effects makeup ===
Chaney did not undergo an on-screen facial transformation from man to wolf in the original film, as featured in all sequels. The lap-dissolve progressive makeups were seen only in the final ten minutes and were presented discreetly. In the first transformation, Larry removes his shoes and socks. His feet are seen to grow hairy and become huge paws (courtesy of uncomfortable &quot;boots&quot; made of hard rubber, covered in yak hair). In the final scene, the werewolf gradually returns to Larry Talbot&#x27;s human form through the standard technique.

==== Application process ====
Stories about the makeup and transformation scenes have become legendary and are mostly apocryphal. The transformation of Chaney from man into a monster was certainly laborious; the entirety of the makeup took five to six hours to apply and an hour to remove. Jack Pierce had initially designed it for Henry Hull in &quot;Werewolf of London&quot; (1935), but Hull argued that the disguise made no sense within the plot since &quot;Dr. Glendon&quot; needed to be recognizable by the characters even in his werewolf form. Pierce was ordered to design a second version which left more of Hull&#x27;s face recognizable. Pierce then recycled his original design for the 1941 film.

Chaney claimed he was forced to sit motionless for hours as the scenes were shot frame by frame. At times he claimed he was left to remain sitting while the crew broke for lunch and was also equivocal about using the bathroom. Chaney even said special effects men drove tiny finishing nails into the skin on the sides of his hands so they would remain motionless during close-ups.

However, studio logs indicate that during the filming of &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948), the entire crew, including Chaney, took a two-hour break during the filming of a transformation and filmed the rest of the scene later that day (though the makeup for &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; had significantly been redesigned and streamlined by Bud Westmore over the original Jack Pierce makeup). A plaster mold was made to hold his head still, as his image was photographed and his outline drawn on panes of glass in front of the camera. Chaney then went to makeup man Jack Pierce&#x27;s department, where Pierce, using grease paint, a rubber snout appliance, and a series of wigs, glued layers of yak hair to Chaney&#x27;s face. Then Chaney would return to the set, line himself up using the panes of glass as a reference, and several feet of film was shot. Then Chaney would return to the makeup department. A new layer would be applied to show the transformation being further along. He would then return to the sound stage to film. This was done about a half-dozen times. Talbot&#x27;s lap dissolve transformation on screen only took seconds, while Chaney&#x27;s took almost ten hours.

==Reception==
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91% based on , with an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;A handsomely told tale with an affecting performance from Lon Chaney, Jr., &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; remains one of the classics of the Universal horror stable.&quot; 

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;one of the finest horror films ever made&quot;. Maltin praised the film&#x27;s makeup effects, atmospheric music, and Chaney&#x27;s performance in his review.

==Home media==
In the early 1990s, MCA/Universal Home Video released &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; on VHS as part of the &quot;Universal Monsters Classic Collection&quot;.

In 1999, Universal released &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; on VHS and DVD as part of the &quot;Classic Monster Collection&quot;, a series of releases of Universal Classic Monsters films. On April 27, 2004, Universal released &quot;The Wolf Man: The Legacy Collection&quot; on DVD as part of the &quot;Universal Legacy Collection&quot;. This two-disc release includes &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, along with &quot;Werewolf of London&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, and &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot;. In 2009, Universal digitally remastered and re-released &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; on DVD as a two-disc &quot;Special Edition&quot;, as part of the &quot;Universal Legacy Series&quot;. In 2012, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; was released on Blu-ray as part of the &quot;Universal Classic Monsters: The Essential Collection&quot; box set, which includes a total of nine films from the Universal Classic Monsters series.

In 2013, &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; received a standalone Blu-ray release. In 2014, Universal released &quot;The Wolf Man: Complete Legacy Collection&quot; on DVD. This set contains seven films: &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot;, &quot;The House of Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;House of Dracula&quot;, &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;Werewolf of London&quot;, and &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot;.

Universal Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray on October 5, 2021.

==Legacy==
The Wolf Man is the only Universal monster to be played by the same actor in all his 1940s film appearances. Lon Chaney Jr. was very proud of this, frequently stating in interviews that the Wolf Man was his &#x27;baby&#x27;. &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; is listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;, which stated that the film &#x27;remains the most recognizable and most cherished version of the [werewolf] myth&#x27;.

The Wolf Man is one of three top-tier Universal Studios monsters without a direct literary source. The others are &quot;The Mummy&quot; and the &quot;Creature from the Black Lagoon&quot;. In the 1970s, novelizations of the original films were issued as paperback originals as part of a series written by &quot;Carl Dreadstone&quot;, a pseudonym for British horror writer Ramsey Campbell.

===Sequels===
&quot;The Wolf Man&quot; proved popular, so Chaney reprised his signature role in four more Universal films. However, unlike his contemporary &quot;monsters&quot;, Larry Talbot never had a sequel all to himself. &quot;Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man&quot; (1943) had Talbot&#x27;s grave opened on a full moon night, causing him to rise again (making him, in the subsequent films, technically one of the undead). The full moon, which had not been shown or mentioned in the first film, was used as a quasi-explanation for the monster&#x27;s resurrection, and the poem known to the local villagers was retconned to mention the full moon so that the last line became &quot;and the moon is full and bright.&quot;

The resurrected Talbot seeks out Dr. Frankenstein for a cure but finds the monster (Bela Lugosi) instead. The two square off at the climax, but the fight ends in a draw when a dam is exploded, and Frankenstein&#x27;s castle is flooded. In 1944 Universal wanted to pair Dracula and the Wolf Man in &quot;The Wolf Man vs. Dracula&quot;, but it was canceled in favor of a remake of &quot;Phantom of the Opera&quot;. In &quot;House of Frankenstein&quot; (1944), Talbot is once again resurrected and is promised a cure via a brain transplant but is shot dead with a silver bullet instead. He returns with no explanation in &quot;House of Dracula&quot; (1945). He is finally cured of his condition, but he is afflicted once again, in the comedy film &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot; (1948). This time the Wolf Man is a hero of sorts, saving Wilbur Grey (Lou Costello) from having his brain transplanted by Dracula (Bela Lugosi) into the head of the Monster (Glenn Strange). Grabbing the vampire as he turns into a bat, the Wolf Man dives over a balcony into the sea, taking Dracula with him.

===Remake===

Universal Pictures produced a remake of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot; with Joe Johnston directing the film and Benicio del Toro starring as Lawrence Talbot (also producer of the film). The remake followed the same basic plot as the original. However, the story and characters were significantly altered, with Anthony Hopkins in a radically altered version of the Claude Rains role. The film was released on February 12, 2010, and opened at No. 2 at the box office that weekend. The film was met with mixed reviews and a low box office reception but won an Academy Award for Best Makeup in 2011.

Due to the 2010 remake performing below expectations at the box office, Universal chose not to produce a sequel. Universal&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;&quot; was originally planned as a spin-off from &quot;The Wolfman&quot; but was ultimately unrelated.

===Reboot===
Universal announced that it would reboot their Universal Monsters properties as part of their &quot;Dark Universe&quot;, with Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan attached to develop the structure of the shared universe. In November 2014, Universal hired Aaron Guzikowski to write the shared universe&#x27;s reboot of &quot;The Wolf Man&quot;. In June 2016, Dwayne Johnson was reported to star as the character. Later in October, David Callaham was brought on board to re-write the script. The following year on November 8 however, Alex Kurtzman and Chris Morgan moved on to other projects, leaving the future of the &quot;Dark Universe&quot; in doubt.

In May 2020, Ryan Gosling had been cast as Wolf Man for an upcoming reboot of the titular character. Lauren Shuker Blum and Rebecca Angelo co-wrote the script from an original story pitched by Gosling. The actor has previously been in negotiations to also serve as the director, but was ultimately decided that he would instead focus entirely on acting. Universal is actively pursuing a director. By July, Leigh Whannell entered early negotiations to direct the project, with Jason Blum announced as an additional producer. In October 2021, Deadline reported that Derek Cianfrance will write and direct the reboot. On December 13, 2023, it was confirmed that Whannell was back as a director, taking Cianfrance&#x27;s place, and that Christopher Abbott was cast as the main character, replacing Gosling who will remain as the executive producer. The film was released on January 17, 2025.

=== Notes ===
The poem mentioned more than once in the film was not, contrary to popular belief, an ancient legend, but was in fact an invention of screenwriter Siodmak. &quot;Even a man who is pure in heart and says his prayers by night / can become a wolf when the wolfsbane blooms and the Autumn moon is bright.&quot; The poem is repeated in every subsequent film in which Talbot/The Wolf Man appears including the film &quot;Van Helsing&quot; with the only exceptions being &quot;House of Dracula&quot; and &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein&quot;. The later films change the last line of the poem to &quot;And the moon is full and bright&quot;, and in episode 944 of &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;, Christopher Pennock (as Jeb Hawkes) recites this version of the poem.

<doc id="927060" wikidata="Q143493" url="?curid=927060" title="Twenty-One (game show)">
<text>Twenty-One is an American game show originally hosted by Jack Barry that initially aired on NBC from 1956 to 1958. Produced by Jack Barry-Dan Enright Productions, the show featured two contestants playing against each other in separate isolation booths, answering general-knowledge questions to earn 21 total points. The program became notorious when it was found to be rigged as part of the 1950s quiz show scandals, which nearly caused the demise of the entire genre in the wake of United States Senate investigations. The 1994 film &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is based on these events. A new version of the show aired on NBC in 2000 with Maury Povich as host.

==Gameplay==
Two contestants, typically a returning champion and a challenger, entered separate isolation booths and donned pairs of headphones. The arrangement of the booths and the studio lighting prevented the contestants from seeing or hearing each other or the audience. At any given moment during the game, one booth would be &quot;open&quot;, meaning that the occupant could hear the host in the headphones and could speak using the booth&#x27;s microphone. The other booth would be &quot;closed&quot;, with its microphone disabled and the headphones playing music to prevent the contestant from hearing the game. After each question, sounds of laughter and applause were played through the headphones of the contestant in the closed booth in order to prevent him or her from learning the outcome of the opponent&#x27;s turn.

The game was played in rounds, with Barry announcing the category for each round as it was dispensed from a machine on his podium; there were over 100 possible categories. The challenger played first in each round, with his or her booth open and the champion&#x27;s closed, and selected a point value from 1 to 11. Higher-value questions were more difficult, and questions often had several parts. If the challenger answered correctly, the points were added to his or her score; a miss subtracted the points, but the score could never go below zero. The challenger&#x27;s booth was then closed and the champion&#x27;s opened so that the champion could take a turn. Barry would not tell either contestant about the other&#x27;s score or performance.

The goal was to earn a total of 21 points. If the challenger reached this score first, his or her booth was left open to hear the champion&#x27;s turn, but the challenger would be cautioned not to speak or give away any information. Barry would not tell the champion that the challenger had already reached 21 unless the champion asked for a question that would tie the score if answered correctly. If the champion failed to match that score, the challenger won. The champion won by reaching 21 first on his or her own turn. If a round ended in a 21–21 tie, the scores were erased and a new game was played. Contestants were given extra time to think on any question that would bring them up to 21.

After two rounds, both booths were opened and the contestants were given a chance to stop the game. If either asked to do so, the contestant in the lead would be declared the winner. The game was automatically stopped after five rounds.

The winner of the game received $500 for each point of the margin of victory (e.g., a 21–15 win paid $3,000). Whenever a game ended in a tie, the stakes were raised by $500 per point and a new game was played. Champions could choose to leave the show with the winnings earned up to that point or to play again, basing the decision on a small amount of information about the next challenger. A champion could not leave the show during a series of ties. However, if the challenger won the next game, winnings for that game were paid out of the defeated champion&#x27;s total. Contestants stayed on the show until they either chose to leave or were defeated.

===2000 version===
Questions were still worth 1 to 11 points, but all main-game questions were multiple-choice, with no multiple-part questions. Questions worth six or fewer points had one correct answer out of three choices. Questions worth seven to ten points had one correct answer out of four choices; for ten-point questions, &quot;all/none of the above&quot; was an option. Questions worth 11 points had two correct answers out of five, and both were required. As with the original series, host Povich did not tell either contestant about the other&#x27;s score or performance.

Incorrect answers no longer deducted points from a contestant&#x27;s score. Instead, contestants received a strike for each incorrect response (or for failing to provide both correct responses on the 11-point questions); accumulating three strikes resulted in an automatic loss. This rule change meant that games could end without a winner, as the rounds were played to completion. If one contestant had struck out on his or her turn and the second contestant had two strikes, the latter could also lose the game on an incorrect answer. However, a contestant did not know how an opponent had struck out unless explicitly told so by the host.

Each contestant could call for a &quot;Second Chance&quot; once per game, allowing an opportunity to receive help from a friend or family member before answering. An incorrect response on a Second Chance penalized the contestant with two strikes instead of one. If the challenger struck out, and the champion had either one or two strikes and had not yet used his or her Second Chance, the round was played to completion because the champion could still strike out. In the event of a challenger&#x27;s strikeout, the champion automatically won if he or she either had no strikes, or had one strike and had used the Second Chance.

Games were still played to a maximum of five rounds, and beginning with the second episode, contestants had the option to stop the game after the second round if neither contestant had reached 21. If time ran out during a game and at least two complete rounds had been played, the contestant in the lead was declared the winner and advanced to the Perfect 21 bonus round at the beginning of the next episode.

Unlike the 1950s version, if the game ended in a tie, no new game was played. Instead, the contestants would be asked one question, and the first contestant to ring in could answer. If correct, he or she won the game and went on to play the bonus round; an incorrect answer gave the opponent a chance to respond. If both contestants missed the question, a new one was asked, with play continuing until a winner was determined.

====Payoff====
Losing challengers received $1,000 as a consolation prize. Rather than receiving a dollar value multiplied by the point difference after winning each game, champions received progressively larger amounts for each opponent defeated.
All amounts are cumulative; in the first playout structure, winning four games would be worth $1,000,000. After winning a fourth game, the contestant started the chain again at $100,000 for defeating a fifth opponent, $200,000 for defeating a sixth, and so on. After a few early episodes, the number of matches required to win $1,000,000 increased; winning seven games would now be worth at least $2,675,000. As before, any contestant who defeated a seventh opponent started from the beginning of the chain.

When the rules changed, the returning champion had won one game and $100,000 in his appearance on the final show under the old prize structure. Instead of being &quot;grandfathered&quot; under the old prize structure, he played and won his second game for $250,000 (the next amount after $100,000), and played but lost his third game for $500,000.

Under both prize structures, champions remained on the show until being defeated, as in the original version. However, unlike the original show, new champions&#x27; winnings were not deducted from the totals of dethroned ones.

====Contestant selection====
During the first six episodes, the audience chose the winner&#x27;s next opponent. The audience would be presented with two potential challengers to face the current champion, and the audience would vote for an opponent using keypads. The person who received the higher vote played against the champion; the other person would be one of the two potential challengers to be voted upon for the next game. In the first episode, there were three potential opponents to face the champion. After the sixth episode, the process was changed to a random selection. At the beginning of the show, six potential challengers would be introduced, and would be selected randomly from that group for each new game. People who had not been selected by the end of the show were not guaranteed to return on the following show, although some did appear on the show multiple times before being selected to play.

====Bonus round: Perfect 21====
The champion was asked a maximum of six true/false questions in a single category, starting at one point and increasing by one per question, to a maximum value of six. After any correct answer, the champion could stop playing and receive $10,000 per point; an incorrect answer ended the round and forfeited this money. Correctly answering all six questions won the top prize of $210,000.

===Big winners===
Under the first payoff structure, Rahim Oberholtzer was the biggest winner, collecting $1,120,000 (at the time, the all-time game show winnings record) over four victories, three of which were the result of his opponents having struck out.

David Legler won $1,765,000 over six wins with the new payout structure, and was the top winner in American game show history until 2001; he is now the eighth-highest winner.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;Twenty-One&quot; was originally conceived by host Jack Barry and producing partner Dan Enright as a weekly half-hour program for CBS&#x27; 1956–1957 schedule. The show was ultimately picked up by NBC and ran from September 12, 1956, to October 9, 1958, under the sponsorship of Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of Geritol. The series finished at #21 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1957–1958 season. In 1958, Elfrida von Nardroff won $220,500 on the game show &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, more money than any other contestant on the show. After starting the 1958–59 season with an 8:30 Thursday night time slot, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; ran on October 2 and on October 9 before being abruptly canceled. An announcement broadcast a few hours before the scheduled October 16 program informed viewers that it would not be seen. A spokesman for Pharmaceuticals said, &quot;&quot;Twenty-One&quot; was dropped because of a decline in ratings. We must admit that the investigation had something do with this decline,&quot; after the October 9 show had the lowest rating in its history. A prime-time version of &quot;Concentration&quot; was introduced in the 8:30 time slot on October 30, with Barry as the host and Pharmaceuticals&#x27; Geritol as the sponsor.

NBC revived the show in 2000 with talk show host Maury Povich as host, after ABC&#x27;s &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot;, FOX&#x27;s &quot;Greed&quot;, and CBS&#x27; &quot;Winning Lines&quot; proved that big-money game shows had once again become viable prime-time network fare. NBC aired first-run episodes through the end of May sweeps, after which the network declined to renew the series.

===Scandal===
The initial broadcast of &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was played honestly, with no manipulation of the game by the producers. That broadcast was, in the words of Enright, &quot;a dismal failure&quot;; the first two contestants were not successful at answering questions. Show sponsor Geritol, upon seeing this opening-night performance, reportedly became furious with the results and demanded improvements.

As a result, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; became not only rigged, but almost completely choreographed as well. Contestants were cast almost as if they were actors, and in fact were active and (usually) willing partners in the deception. They were given instructions as to how to dress, what to say to the host and when, which questions to answer correctly or miss, and even when to mop their brows. The producers could shut off the air conditioning to either booth in order to make the contestants sweat more, making them appear to be under great stress.

====Charles Van Doren====

College professor Charles Van Doren (1926–2019) was introduced as a contestant on &quot;Twenty-One&quot; on November 28, 1956, as a challenger to champion Herbert Stempel (1926–2020), a dominant contestant who had become somewhat unpopular with viewers and eventually the sponsor. Van Doren and Stempel played to a series of four 21–21 games, with audience interest building with each passing week and each new game, until Van Doren eventually prevailed.

The film &quot;Quiz Show&quot; depicts the turning point as a question for Stempel, asking him to name the film that won the Academy Award for Best Motion Picture for 1955. Stempel knew the correct answer to be &quot;Marty&quot;, as it was one of his favorite films. The producers ordered him to answer the question with 1954&#x27;s Best Motion Picture winner, &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;.
Stempel later recalled that there was a moment in the booth when his conscience and sense of fair play warred with his sense of obligation. He almost disrupted the scripted outcome by giving the correct answer. Stempel answered incorrectly as he was instructed, but redeemed himself by staying in the game and earning enough points to tie Van Doren&#x27;s score, unlike the depiction of events in &quot;Quiz Show&quot;. Stempel was finally defeated in the next game. The surviving kinescope of the broadcast shows Stempel failing to come up with the title of William Allen White&#x27;s August 15, 1896 editorial in the &quot;Emporia Gazette&quot; titled &quot;What&#x27;s the Matter with Kansas?&quot; After the missed question, Van Doren quit with 18 points, which was enough to win. Van Doren&#x27;s victory began one of the longest and most storied runs of any champion in the history of television game shows. His popularity soared as a result of his success, earning him a place on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine and even a regular feature spot on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; show; at one point, the program even surpassed CBS&#x27; &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; in the ratings. He was finally unseated as champion by Vivienne Wax Nearing (1926–2007) on March 11, 1957, after having won a total of $129,000 (the equivalent of $ today).

In the meantime, Stempel, disgruntled over being ordered to lose, attempted to blow the whistle on &quot;Twenty-One&quot;, even going so far as to have a federal investigator look into the show. Initially, little came of these investigations and Stempel&#x27;s accusations were dismissed as jealousy because there was no hard evidence to back up his claims. While a congressional investigation did affect &quot;Twenty-One&quot; during this period, the much larger ongoing investigation was the HUAC hearings into possible communists in entertainment; the show&#x27;s director, Charles S. Dubin, was fired by NBC in June 1958 after he refused to answer whether he had ever been a member of the Communist Party USA.

In August 1958, the popular CBS daytime game show &quot;Dotto&quot; was abruptly canceled after a contestant found a notebook containing the answers to every question that was to be asked to the show&#x27;s current champion, future journalist Marie Winn. Stempel&#x27;s allegations about &quot;Twenty-One&quot; began to gain credibility. A grand jury was convened in Autumn 1958 to investigate &quot;Dotto&quot; and other possible game-show fixing, investigated by Joseph Stone, the assistant district attorney of New York. Stone said in his book &quot;Prime Time and Misdemeanors&quot; that question writer Glorianne Rader was instructed by Dan Enright and associate producer Albert Freedman, who had chosen the categories for the next broadcast earlier in the week, to place the questions in Barry&#x27;s dispensing machine a few minutes before airtime; this was done to avoid any slip-ups in the planned outcome. Stone contacted former &quot;Twenty-One&quot; contestants, including Richard Jackman, who confessed to the fixing of the show. Three days after Jackman&#x27;s confession, and without advance public warning, &quot;Twenty-One&quot; was canceled after its broadcast of October 17, 1958, amid plummeting ratings. A nighttime version of &quot;Concentration&quot; took over its time slot the following week.

Further eroding Barry and Enright&#x27;s claims of honesty, another former contestant, James Snodgrass, came forward with corroborating proof that the show had been rigged: using a series of registered letters that he had mailed to himself, Snodgrass documented every answer for which he was coached prior to airtime. He testified before Congress in 1959.

The scandal forced producers Barry and Enright into virtual exile. Barry did not host another national TV show for more than a decade, and Enright moved to Canada to continue his production career.

====Aftermath====
The scandal also caused the Federal Communications Commission to mandate the sale of Barry-Enright&#x27;s radio station in Hollywood, Florida, WGMA (now WLQY). The station was purchased by its general manager, C. Edward Little, who promptly affiliated the station with the Mutual Broadcasting System. After serving for a time as the head of Mutual&#x27;s affiliates association, Little became the president of Mutual from 1972 to 1979. During this time Little created the Mutual Black Network, the first U.S. broadcast network catering exclusively to African-Americans, in addition to the Mutual Spanish Network and the Mutual Southwest Network. Under Little&#x27;s administration, Mutual became the first commercial broadcasting entity to use satellite technology for program delivery. During his tenure as head of Mutual, Little hired Larry King to host an all-night phone-in talk show Little had created. King was a one-time announcer for Little at WGMA. King, who had previously hosted a similar morning show on Miami radio station WIOD, went on to national fame on both radio and television, winning a coveted Peabody Award along the way.

Barry would be able to acquire another radio station in the late-1960s: a Los Angeles-area radio station (KKOP 93.5 FM, Redondo Beach, later renamed KFOX, now KDAY). Barry would later say he bought the station specifically because it would require him to have a license from the FCC, and that if the FCC were willing to grant him a license, it would decisively demonstrate that his reputation was no longer &quot;tainted&quot; by the game show scandals. Soon after his acquisition of KKOP, Barry finally returned to network game-show hosting in 1969, succeeding Dennis Wholey on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Generation Gap,&quot; for which he publicly thanked the producers and ABC for giving him a chance for a comeback. In 1971, he sold ABC his first new game show, &quot;The Reel Game&quot;, which he also hosted; it ran for 13 weeks. He became a success again as a producer-host with &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot;, which ran on CBS from 1972 to 1975 and in syndication from 1977–1986 (Barry died in May 1984 and was replaced by Bill Cullen for the final two years); it also saw a revival in syndication for one season in 1990. Enright would work as &quot;Joker&quot;″s executive producer in the show&#x27;s final year on CBS, and the two revived their partnership full-time in 1976, reviving &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough,&quot; which ran until 1986. It was revived once more but was canceled after a few months. Enright died in 1992.

===1982 pilot===
An unsold pilot was made in 1982 with Jim Lange as host and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell announcing, but it was not picked up. In the pilot, a bonus round was introduced, which consisted of a flashing display showing random numbers between 1 and 11. The contestant would decide whether he or she wanted the number or preferred that the computer take it, with the object of the game to either score 21 exactly first (or be closest to 21 without going over), or get the computer to bust by going over 21. Once the computer hit 17 or more, its score froze for the rest of the game, but this rule did not apply to the contestant. The bonus-round prize was $2,000 and a trip.

==Licensed merchandise==
A board game based on the original 1956–1958 version was released by Lowell in 1957.

A paperback quiz book featuring 1–11 point questions in each of the 45 categories was released by Pyramid in 1958.

==International versions==
&quot;Twenty-One&quot; is one of only three Barry &amp; Enright game shows known to have foreign adaptations, the others being &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; and &quot;Concentration&quot;.

==Episode status==
Thirty-two episodes are held by the Library of Congress. The episode on which Van Doren defeated Stempel was released as part of a retail home-video compilation featuring other game-show episodes.

<text>Igor Fedorovich Kostin (27 December 1936 – 9 June 2015) was one of the five photographers in the world to take pictures of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster near Pripyat in Ukraine, on 26 April 1986. He was working for Novosti Press Agency (APN) as a photographer in Kyiv, Ukraine, when he represented Novosti to cover the nuclear accident in Chernobyl. Kostin&#x27;s aerial view of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant was widely published around the world, showing the extent of the devastation, and triggering fear throughout the world of radioactivity contamination the accident caused, when the Soviet media was working to censor information regarding the accident, releasing limited information regarding the accident on 28 April 1986, until the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991.

He had captured the ongoing problems with contamination suffered by human beings and animals. His photos reportedly include those of the many animals born with deformities in the Chernobyl area, from his many incursions into the Zone of alienation to bring the problems to the attention of the world. Kostin died in Kyiv in 2015 at the age of 78 in a car accident. He was married to Alla Kostin.

==Early life and conscription==
Kostin was born in Bessarabia, in Greater Romania (present day in Moldova), on 27 December 1936, three years before his father, Féodor Kostin, an economist working in a bank, was sent to fight the war for the newly created Moldavian SSR, after Greater Romania was forced to cede Bessarabia to the Soviet Union under the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. Before the cession, the Kostin family relocated to Kishinev, Moldavian ASSR (present day the capital city of Moldova, Chişinău). They subsequently resided in the suburb of Kishinev for the next thirty-two years, when his father was sent to the war.

From June 1941 onward, under German and Romanian occupation, Kostin was forced to feed on leftovers disposed by the Germans and better off Moldavians with his mother, Nadejda Popovitch, since his father was the sole breadwinner in the family, and there was widespread famine during the occupation. He and his mother frequently transported food such as borscht illegally to the German concentration camps around Kishinev for the Soviet prisoners of war. It was later revealed by Kostin in his photographic book that his mother hoped to find his father in the camps, only to realise later that his father was killed during a bombing years later.

In August 1944, the Soviet Union re-established control over Moldavia, and drove the German and Romanian forces out of Moldavian SSR. The entrance of Soviet forces was ushered by aerial bombardment, and almost killed the Kostins, when a bomb obliterated their residence, when they hid under a bed. They later hid near a German armored vehicle, until Soviet forces entered the city.

The Soviet Union began purging native Moldavians, and sending richer farmers and the intelligentsia to concentration camps in Siberia. Private business operations became illegal, and Kostin&#x27;s mother operated a small family business, at the risk of being exposed to the officials by neighbors. In the mornings the Kostins would wake up to the clamor of some of their neighbors packing up and being deported. It was at this point of time that Kostin turned into a gangster and lost interests in schooling. His early life turned into a game of survival of the fittest. Most people were preoccupied with obtaining the basic necessities of life.

In 1954, he began military service as a degenerated athletic youth in the army, where he was reformed and became a sapper. He revealed that on at least one occasion he was instructed to dig trenches along the Soviet border in anticipation of an American invasion. By the end of his service he grew more insubordinate and went absent without official leave adding seven months of military jail term to his three-year military service. His deputy commander assigned him the task of redecorating the &quot;Leninrooms&quot;—political meeting rooms of the barracks. His jail term was immediately commuted upon the completion of the job.

==Career as a sportsman and engineer==
In 1959, upon being discharged from the army, Kostin began playing volleyball for Kishinev&#x27;s regional sporting team. He then moved up the ladder to play for the Moldavian SSR team, subsequently becoming part of the Soviet national team, representing the union in international basketball competitions. In 1969, his sporting career ended with multiple spinal and knee injuries and complications from negligence of medical treatments. He began studying at the Agronomy Institute of Kishinev, and was employed as Senior Engineer for a construction firm in Kishinev. It was then he received a job offer at the Construction Bureau of Kyiv, in Ukraine.

In Kyiv, they pioneered a construction framing method that expedited building construction, and Kostin invented a machine for the method, which he was awarded prizes for. He was then promoted to Chief of Construction, and managed a staff of around 50 people. His wife at that time, Galina, who was also an engineer, helped him to discover and pursue his natural talent in photography through many sleepless nights developing and printing the analog images in Kyiv, which eventually won him praise at the international photo exhibitions.

==Career as a photographer==
By the mid-1970s, Kostin had lost most interest in the construction industry, and was frustrated with the low fixed salary. He professed that he enjoyed photography, specifically portraitures, and won a gold medal for a portrait of his wife in Kyiv&#x27;s annual photographic exhibition. He had subsequently entered into at least 80 such exhibitions and photographic road-shows throughout the world. Kostin&#x27;s career as an amateur photographer earned him more than twice the amount of salary than his career as Chief of Construction in the Construction Bureau of Kyiv.

He was then employed in one of Ukraine&#x27;s TV station as a copywriter. He was subsequently made an anchor for a monthly photographic programme, where he interviews some of most accomplished photographers around the world. He was simultaneously employed as the Chief of Construction, effectively holding two formal careers. A year and half later, the show was canceled, and he attempted to apply for a placing at Novosti Press Agency (APN) in Moscow, Russian SFSR. He was however, rejected by Galina Pleskova, then Editor-in-Chief for the agency.

Kostin effectively ended his engineering career when he returned to Kyiv where he resorted to sleeping in the streets to pursue his photographic career. The Kyiv branch of APN agreed to permit him the use of their photographic development labs. The labs became his temporary abode for around five years after which he was employed as war reporter for Novosti.

Kostin covered some of the most severe third-world wars where the Soviet Union was involved, such as in Vietnam War and Soviet intervention in Afghanistan, where he fielded as a non-Communist Party affiliated reporter for Novosti. Due to the fact of non-alignment, he was restricted from entering the front-lines.

==At Chernobyl==

After returning from Afghanistan, he began to work periodically for Novosti from the Kyiv branch. He reported on local and trans-Soviet matters but rarely left the state. On the late evening of 26 April 1986 a helicopter pilot whom he worked closely with for his journalistic activities alerted him that there had been a fire at the nuclear power plant in Chernobyl. The fire had been extinguished by the time they arrived at Chernobyl via helicopter, and witnessed a war-like scramble of military vehicles and power plant personnel down at the scene of the nuclear power plant. He also experienced an odd feeling combined with high temperature and toxic smog, that was unusual for an accident scene. The motors of his cameras began to exhibit symptoms of radioactive-caused degradation after around 20 shots. The helicopter returned to Kyiv after the cameras&#x27; failure.

Kostin managed to develop the films, only to realise that all but one was unsalvageable - most of the films were affected by the high level of radiation, that caused the photographs to appear entirely black, resembling a film that was exposed to light pre-maturely. Kostin&#x27;s only photograph of the nuclear power plant was sent to Novosti in Moscow, but he did not receive a permit to publish it until 5 May 1986. His visit to Chernobyl was illegal and not sanctioned by the authorities. &quot;Pravda&quot; published limited information about the accident on 29 April 1986, but did not publish Kostin&#x27;s photographs.

The accident was interpreted as a major catastrophe by the global news media, even when the Ukrainian and Soviet authorities were trying to suppress any news regarding the accident. Kostin later received permits as one of the representatives of the five accredited Soviet media outlets to cover the accident site and the Zone of Alienation. On 5 May, 1986, he ventured into the rubble of the Chernobyl nuclear plant site and Reactor 4 along with the liquidators.

It was then that he covered the mass exodus of inhabitants of Pripyat and 30 km zone surrounding the nuclear power plant, before the 1 May Labour Day celebration. Dozens had died from the accident, mostly workers at the nuclear power plant.

<text>Central Jersey, or Central New Jersey, is the middle region of the U.S. state of New Jersey. The designation Central Jersey is a distinct administrative toponym. While New Jersey is often divided into North Jersey and South Jersey, many residents recognize Central Jersey as a distinct third entity. As of the 2020 census, Central Jersey has a population of 3,580,999.

All descriptions of Central Jersey include Middlesex County, the population center of New Jersey, and most include much of nearby Monmouth, Mercer, Somerset, and Hunterdon counties. The inclusion of adjacent areas of Union and Ocean are a source of debate. In 2015, &quot;New Jersey Business&quot; magazine defined Central Jersey more narrowly as the five counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth and Somerset.

In 2022, legislation was proposed in the New Jersey Legislature to establish distinct geographic areas for tourism in the state. Bill A4711 was sponsored by Assemblymembers Roy Freiman, Sadaf Jaffer, and Anthony Verrelli in the New Jersey General Assembly. This included an official designation of the region of Central Jersey, which the legislation defines more broadly as the seven counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, Somerset, and Union. The New Jersey Senate version of this legislation passed by a vote of 36-1 on June 20, 2023. On August 24, 2023, Gov. Murphy signed legislation officially designating Central Jersey including, at a minimum, the counties of Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, and Somerset.

Trenton, the seat of Mercer County and the state capital of New Jersey, is located in Central Jersey. New Jersey&#x27;s geographic center is in Hamilton, Mercer County. In 2011, the population center of the state was in the western portion of East Brunswick, in Middlesex County. The two busiest highways in New Jersey, the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway, intersect in Woodbridge, Middlesex County. Princeton University and Rutgers University, the two most prominent institutions of higher education in the state, are situated in Central Jersey.

==Geographic area==
The region lies roughly at the geographic heart of the Northeast megalopolis and is wholly in the New York metropolitan area, the nation&#x27;s largest metropolitan area.

The Delaware Valley is another area that is associated with some parts of Central Jersey, specifically Mercer County. Yet despite the County’s close geographic proximity to Philadelphia&#x27;s combined statistical area, Mercer County is considered part of the New York Combined Metropolitan Statistical Area as defined by the United States Census Bureau. Some but not all regions of Hunterdon County associate themselves with the Delaware Valley and the Philadelphia metropolitan area.

The Raritan Valley is the region along the middle reaches of the Raritan River and its North Branch and South Branch. The Raritan Valley includes the communities of Branchburg, Bridgewater, Somerville, Raritan, Hillsborough, Franklin Township, Green Brook, North Plainfield, Bound Brook, and South Bound Brook, all in Somerset County; Dunellen, Middlesex, Piscataway, South Plainfield, Highland Park, New Brunswick, East Brunswick, Edison, and Metuchen, all in the northern and central portions of Middlesex County; and Plainfield in southwestern Union County.

The Raritan Bayshore is used to describe the region in Middlesex and Monmouth Counties, located along the coastline of the Raritan Bay, from the mouth of the Raritan River in the west to the barrier island of Sandy Hook bordering the Atlantic Ocean in the east. The Raritan Bayshore includes the communities of Sayreville, Woodbridge, Perth Amboy, South Amboy, and Old Bridge, all in northeastern Middlesex County; Aberdeen, Matawan, Keyport, Union Beach, Hazlet, Keansburg, Holmdel, Middletown, Atlantic Highlands, and Highlands, all in northern Monmouth County.

The telephone area codes 732 and 848 includes Middlesex, Monmouth, Somerset, Union, and northern Ocean counties. While area codes 609 and 640 includes southern Ocean, Hunterdon, and Somerset counties, as well as Mercer County.

==Colonial era==
Between 1674 and 1702, in the early part of New Jersey&#x27;s colonial period, the border between West Jersey and East Jersey ran diagonally across the middle part of the state. The Keith Line, as the demarcation is known, ran through the center of what is now Mercer County. This border remained important in determining ownership and political boundaries until 1745. Remnants of that division are seen today, notably as the Hunterdon-Somerset, Ocean-Burlington, and Monmouth-Burlington county lines. The division of the two provinces was cultural as well as geographical.

New Jersey&#x27;s position between the major cities of New York and Philadelphia led Benjamin Franklin to call the state &quot;a barrel tapped at both ends&quot;. Travel between the two cities originally included a ferry crossing.

Due to the obstacles created by the Meadowlands and the Hudson Palisades, passengers from New York would cross the North River and the Upper New York Bay by boat and then transfer to stagecoaches to travel overland through what is now Central Jersey. One route from Elizabethtown to Lambertville was known as Old York Road. Another route, from Perth Amboy through Kingston to Burlington, ran along a portion of the Kings Highway, These roads followed Lenape paths known respectively as the Naritcong Trail and the Assunpink Trail.

Raritan Landing, across from New Brunswick in today&#x27;s Piscataway, became an important inland port and commercial hub for the region. Two of the nine Colonial Colleges, founded before the American Revolution, were the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University), and Queens College (now Rutgers University).

== Population ==

==Economy==

All of the region&#x27;s counties are ranked among the highest income counties in the United States, as measured by median household income. It has been called the state&#x27;s &quot;wealth belt&quot;.

===Manufacturing===
For decades, Central Jersey was a hub for manufacturing in the eastern United States. Many industrial companies had major production facilities in and around the area, including Edison Assembly, Ford Motor Company&#x27;s production plant for Rangers, Mustangs, Pintos, Mercurys, and Lincolns. Other notable companies include General Motors in Linden, Frigidaire&#x27;s air-conditioner plant in Edison, Hess Corporation in Woodbridge, Siemens in Edison, and ExxonMobil Chemical.

Starting in the 2000s, manufacturing began to leave Central Jersey, and many facilities had closed and moved overseas.

===Telecommunications and high technology===
The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex has been the site of many innovations in telecommunications and is experiencing a renaissance as a business incubator for high-tech startup companies. Today Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Communications, Vonage, Avaya, and Bell Labs are located in the region.

===Healthcare and pharmaceuticals===

Central New Jersey is a global leader in the pharmaceuticals industry. New Brunswick is known as &quot;the Healthcare City&quot;, due to the concentration of medical facilities in Central Jersey, including Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and Saint Peter&#x27;s University Hospital, as well as the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. University Medical Center of Princeton is located in Plainsboro. The campuses of the major pharmaceutical corporations Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis are located in the region, as are major operations of Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories and Aurobindo Pharma. Princeton University&#x27;s Frist Campus Center is used for the aerial views of Princeton‑Plainsboro Teaching Hospital seen in the television series &quot;House&quot;.

===Shopping malls===

Major shopping centers include the Freehold Raceway Mall, Woodbridge Center, Menlo Park Mall, Bridgewater Commons, The Grove at Shrewsbury, Monmouth Mall, Brunswick Square Mall, Forrestal Village, Quaker Bridge Mall, Princeton Market Fair, Ocean County Mall, Jackson Premium Outlets, and Jersey Shore Premium Outlets.

===Academia===
Princeton University in Princeton is one of eight Ivy League universities and the nation, one of the world&#x27;s most prominent research universities, and consistently ranked as one of the best universities in the world; in the 2023-24 issue of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; Best Colleges Ranking, Princeton University is ranked the best university in the nation. Rutgers-New Brunswick is the flagship university campus of the state New Jersey. Monmouth University, Rider University, and The College of New Jersey are located in Central Jersey as well. Each county maintains its own county college, with the exception of Hunterdon County - whose residents may attend either Raritan Valley Community College (located in Somerset County) or Mercer County Community College (located in Mercer County) at no additional cost. Monmouth County&#x27;s residents have the choice of attending Brookdale Community College which was recently listed as one of the top three community colleges in the state. Thomas Edison State College in Trenton provides extensive on-line and adult education. Kean University is in Union County.

===Tourism and cultural attractions===

Popular tourist attractions in Central New Jersey include Six Flags Great Adventure, Gateway National Recreation Area, Monmouth Park Racetrack, Freehold Raceway, and the many boardwalks along the northern Jersey Shore, in Monmouth County and northern Ocean County.

The New Brunswick music scene has produced many successful indie bands. The city also is home to the New Jersey Folk Festival. In an early era, the Stone Pony and Asbury Park Convention Hall were important venues on the rock scene. Major music and theater venues in the region include PNC Bank Arts Center, the Trenton War Memorial, CURE Insurance Arena, the McCarter Theater, the Count Basie Theater, the George Street Playhouse and the Starland Ballroom.

East Jersey Olde Towne Village, the Road Up Raritan Historic District as well as those in Trenton, Lawrence, and Princeton recall the colonial era. The region saw a lot of action during the American Revolution due to the region&#x27;s strategic importance between Philadelphia and New York City. As such, many important battles took place here. These battle sites have been converted into state parks, offering historic preservation of the important structures contingent to their respected battles. State parks include Washington Crossing State Park, Princeton Battlefield State Park, and Monmouth Battlefield State Park. The Middlebrook encampment in Bridgewater was where the first official flag of the United States was unfurled, after a law to adopt a national flag had been passed by Congress on June 14, 1777. Ocean Grove is one of the largest national historic sites in the United States.

==Media markets and national sports==
Depending on the location, different parts of Central Jersey fall into overlapping spheres of influence from New York media market and Philadelphia media market. Mercer County is located in the Philadelphia television market, while the rest of the region belongs wholly to the New York City market.

&quot;The Star-Ledger&quot;, based in Newark, is the largest circulated newspaper in New Jersey. Four Central Jersey newspapers, &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot;, &quot;Home News Tribune&quot;, and two Trenton dailies, &quot;The Trentonian&quot; and &quot;The Times&quot; and several local papers are published in Central Jersey. New Jersey On-Line, MyCentralJersey.com and CentralJersey.com are online news services. During statewide political events like Gubernatorial or Senatorial election debates often held in Trenton, partner stations from both the New York and Philadelphia markets pool resources together to co-host the events and bring them to New Jersey homes.

Identification with sports teams is also affected by the region&#x27;s location, and it is not uncommon to find fans of major sports teams of either city. For example, while residents of northern New Jersey root for New York teams, those in the southern part of the state root for Philadelphia teams. The distinction is less clear in Central Jersey. Central Jersey Riptide was a short-lived professional soccer club.

==Transportation==

The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) operates three divisions in the state: North, South, and Central, which encompasses Hunterdon, Mercer, Middlesex, Monmouth, Ocean, and Somerset counties and portions of Warren County. (Routes 22, 122, 173, 78 and including south of Route 57). Apart from Mercer County, which comes under the auspices of the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission, all counties in the region are part of the North Jersey Transportation Planning Authority, a government partner which approves transportation projects for the state.

The United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company traversed the region in 1830, eventually becoming the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR). NJT&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and the North Jersey Coast were once part of the PRR, as was Amtrak which serves the commuter hub at Metropark, New Brunswick, and the Trenton Transit Center. The Central Railroad of New Jersey once connected Jersey City (with connecting ferries to Manhattan) and many Central Jersey towns. Much of that system is now included in New Jersey Transit rail operations to the Raritan Valley. New Brunswick is known as the Hub City, and at one time was a regional transportation hub for streetcars which converged in the city. The Monmouth Ocean Middlesex Line has been proposed for the region.

The Garden State Parkway, New Jersey Turnpike (I-95), I-287, US 1, US 9, Route 18, and Route 18 are major automobile routes through Central Jersey that pass over the Raritan River at Perth Amboy and New Brunswick. I-195 travels through Central Jersey (hence the name &quot;Central Jersey Expressway&quot;) from the Trenton area towards Belmar.

From the Raritan Bayshore, SeaStreak catamarans travel to Pier 11 at Wall Street and East 34th Street Ferry Landing. NY Waterway ferries travel to Paulus Hook Ferry Terminal in Jersey City, Battery Park City Ferry Terminal, and West Midtown Ferry Terminal. As of 2018, there are plans to create ferry service from Carteret in Middlesex County.

Trenton-Mercer Airport is the only airport in Central New Jersey providing long-distance commercial service. Monmouth Executive Airport, formerly known as Allaire Airport, is a public-use airport located near Allaire State Park. Central Jersey Regional Airport is a privately owned, public airport in Somerset County. Linden Airport is a small general aviation airport located along U.S. Route 1&amp;9 in Union County.

The Route 9 BBS, the New Brunswick BRT, and the Central Jersey Route 1 Corridor are projects in the region intended to expand the use of bus rapid transit in New Jersey.

==Asian American population==
===Asian Indian population===
Central New Jersey, particularly Edison and surrounding Middlesex County, is prominently known for its significant concentration of Asian Indians. The world&#x27;s largest Hindu temple was inaugurated in Robbinsville in 2014, a BAPS temple. The growing Little India is a South Asian-focused commercial strip in Middlesex County, the U.S. county with the highest concentration of Asian Indians, at nearly 20% as of 2020. The Oak Tree Road strip runs for about one-and-a-half miles through Edison and neighboring Iselin in Woodbridge Township, near the area&#x27;s sprawling Chinatown and Koreatown, running along New Jersey Route 27. It is the largest and most diverse South Asian cultural hub in the United States. Monroe Township (nicknamed &quot;Edison South&quot;), in Middlesex County, has experienced a particularly rapid growth rate in its Indian American population, with an estimated 5,943 (13.6%) as of 2017, which was 23 times the 256 (0.9%) counted as of the 2000 Census; and Diwali is celebrated by the township as a Hindu holiday. Carteret&#x27;s Punjabi Sikh community, variously estimated at upwards of 3,000, constitutes the largest concentration of Sikhs in the state. In Middlesex County, election ballots are printed in English, Spanish, Gujarati, Hindi, and Punjabi.

Indian pharmaceutical and technology companies are coming to Central New Jersey to gain a foothold in the United States. Dr. Reddy&#x27;s Laboratories, based in Hyderabad, set up its U.S. headquarters in Princeton, Mercer County. Pharmaceutical company Aurobindo, also headquartered in Hyderabad, has established its U.S. headquarters in the Dayton section of South Brunswick, Middlesex County, and has implemented a multimillion-dollar expansion of these Central New Jersey operations. In March 2023, Bengaluru-based technology services and consulting company Wipro opened its American international headquarters in East Brunswick, Middlesex, County.

===Chinese population===

Starting in the 2000s, highly educated suburbs in northern and central New Jersey, have received a large influx of Chinese immigrants, including many Taiwanese immigrants. Many Chinese American families send their children to Mandarin language schools in Edison. Some of these private schools include Edison Chinese School, located at John Adams Middle School, or Tzu Chi, located at Woodrow Wilson Middle School, both of which teach in Traditional Chinese, in addition to Huaxia Chinese School, which teaches in Simplified Chinese.

The Taiwanese airline China Airlines provides private bus service to John F. Kennedy International Airport from the Kam Man Food location in Edison to feed its flight to Taipei, Taiwan.

===Korean population===

Central Jersey is also home to a large Korean American population. In 2010, an H Mart opened in Edison. The area is also home to several Korean churches, including Praise Presbyterian Church (찬양교회) in Somerset, Bountiful United Methodist Church (가득한교회) in Martinsville, and Sebit Presbyterian Church (세빛교회) in Warren.

==Jewish community==
Central Jersey is also home to the fastest-growing Jewish community in the U.S., especially Orthodox. Beth Medrash Govoha (), in Lakewood Township, Ocean County, is the world&#x27;s largest yeshiva outside the State of Israel. The world&#x27;s largest Jewish gathering outside of Israel occurred in Edison on December 1, 2024.

<text>Édouard Montpetit (; 26 September 1881 – 27 May 1954) was a Quebec lawyer, economist and academic.

==Biography==
Montpetit was born on 26 September 1881 in Montmagny, Quebec. Called to the bar in 1904, Montpetit worked as a lawyer and taught political economy before he obtained a scholarship in 1907, which made him the first holder of such a scholarship to be officially sent by the province of Quebec to Paris. In Paris he studied political and social science, receiving a degree in both. He founded the &quot;École des sciences sociales&quot; in 1920, which he then ran. 

Between 1920 and 1950 he was active at the Université de Montréal, where he was secretary general, dean of the faculty of social sciences, member of the senate and member of the board of direction. He taught at the business school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, the École des hautes études commerciales (HEC) from 1910 to 1939, as well as at the university&#x27;s law school, from 1910 to his death. He died on 27 May 1954 and was entombed at the Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery in Montreal.

==Recognition==
In 1935 Montpetit was awarded the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal.
In 1967, a monument to Montpetit by Sylvia Daoust was unveiled on the Université de Montréal campus and the name of nearby Maplewood Avenue in Côte-des-Neiges was changed to boulevard Édouard-Montpetit. The name of Maplewood Avenue in Outremont did not change.

A CEGEP in Longueuil, Quebec (Collège Édouard-Montpetit), a high school in the east of Montreal and a station in the Montreal metro system are also named in his honour.

==Bibliography==
A partial list of Montpetit&#x27;s published works includes:
* &quot;Au service de la tradition française&quot; (1920)
* &quot;Pour une doctrine&quot; (1931)
* &quot;Les cordons de la bourse&quot; (1935)
* &quot;Le front contre la vitre&quot; (1936)
* &quot;La conquête économique&quot; (1938–1940)
* &quot;Reflets d&#x27;Amérique&quot; (1941)
* &quot;Propos sur la montagne: Essais&quot; (1946)

<doc id="927078" wikidata="Q630781" url="?curid=927078" title="Battle of Raphia">
<text>The Battle of Raphia was fought on 22 June 217 BC near modern Rafah between the forces of Ptolemy IV Philopator, king and pharaoh of Ptolemaic Egypt and Antiochus III the Great of the Seleucid Empire during the Syrian Wars. It was one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic kingdoms and of the ancient world, and determined the sovereignty of Coele-Syria.

==Prelude==
The two largest Hellenistic kingdoms in the 3rd century BC, Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucid Empire, repeatedly fought for control of Syria in a series of conflicts known as the Syrian Wars. The Fourth Syrian War began in 219 BC, during which time Ptolemaic Egypt was ruled by Ptolemy IV, and the Seleucid Empire was ruled by Antiochus III the Great.

In 217 BC, both armies were on campaign through Syria. The Seleucid and Ptolemaic armies met near the small Syrian town of Rafah. Antiochus initially set up his camp at a distance of 10 (about 2 km) and then only 5 stades (about 1 km) from his adversary&#x27;s. The battle began with a series of small skirmishes around the perimeter of each army. One night, Theodotus the Aetolian, formerly an officer of Ptolemy, sneaked inside the Ptolemaic camp and reached what he presumed to be the King&#x27;s tent to assassinate him; but he was absent and the plot failed.

==Forces ==
=== Seleucid Army ===
Antiochus&#x27; army was composed of 5,000 lightly armed Daae, Carmanians, and Cilicians under Byttacus the Macedonian, 10,000 Phalangites (the &quot;Argyraspides&quot; or &quot;Silver Shields&quot;) under Theodotus the Aetolian, the man who had betrayed Ptolemy and handed much of Coele Syria and Phoenicia over to Antiochus, 20,000 Macedonian Phalangites under Nicarchus and Theodotus Hemiolius, 2,000 Persian and Agrianian archers and slingers with 2,000 Thracians under Menedemus (Μενέδημος) of Alabanda, 5,000 Medes, Cissians, Cadusii, and Carmanians under the Aspasianus the Mede, 10,000 Arabians under Zabdibelus, 5,000 Greek mercenaries under Hippolochus the Thessalian, 1,500 Cretans under Eurylochus, 1,000 Neocretans under Zelys the Gortynian, and 500 Lydian javelineers and 1,000 Cardaces (&quot;Kardakes&quot;) under Lysimachus the Gaul.

Four thousand horsemen under Antipater, the nephew of the King and 2,000 under Themison formed the cavalry and 102 Indian war elephants marched under Philip and Myischos.

=== Ptolemaic Army ===
Ptolemy had just ended a major recruitment and retraining plan with the help of many mercenary generals. His forces consisted of 3,000 Hypaspists under Eurylochus the Magnesian (the Agema), 2,000 peltasts under Socrates the Boeotian, 25,000 Macedonian Phalangites under Andromachus the Aspendian and Ptolemy, the son of Thraseas, and 8,000 Greek mercenaries under Phoxidas the Achaean, and 2,000 Cretan under Cnopias of Allaria and 1,000 Neocretan archers under Philon the Cnossian. He had another 3,000 Libyans under Ammonius the Barcian and 20,000 Egyptians under his chief minister Sosibius trained in the Macedonian way. These Egyptians were trained to fight alongside the Macedonians. Apart from these he also employed 4,000 Thracians and Gauls from Egypt and another 2,000 from Europe under Dionysius the Thracian.

His Household Cavalry (&quot;tis aulis&quot;) numbered 700 men and the local (&quot;egchorioi&quot;) and Libyan horse, another 2,300 men, had as appointed general Polycrates of Argos. Those from Greece and the mercenaries were led by Echecrates the Thessalian. Ptolemy&#x27;s force was accompanied by 73 elephants of the African stock.

According to Polybius, Ptolemy had 70,000 infantry, 5,000 cavalry, and 73 war elephants and Antiochus 62,000 infantry, 6,000 cavalry, and 102 elephants.

== War elephants ==
This is the only known battle in which African and Asian elephants were used against each other. Due to Polybius&#x27; descriptions of Antiochus&#x27; Asian elephants (&quot;Elephas maximus&quot;), brought from India, as being larger and stronger than Ptolemy&#x27;s African elephants, it had once been theorized that Ptolemy&#x27;s elephants were in fact the African forest elephant (&quot;Loxodonta cyclotis&quot;), a close relative to the African bush elephant (&quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;) – a typical African bush elephant would tower over an Asian one, meaning that the smaller forest elephant would be a better fit with Polybius&#x27; descriptions. However recent DNA research has revealed that most likely, Ptolemy&#x27;s elephants were in fact &quot;Loxodonta africana&quot;, albeit culled from a population of more diminutive African bush elephants still found in Eritrea today. Another possibility is that Ptolemy utilized the now extinct North African elephants (&quot;Loxodonta africana pharaoensis&quot;). Much smaller than their Indian or Bush cousins, members of this subspecies were typically around high at the shoulder. Regardless of origin, according to Polybius, Ptolemy&#x27;s African elephants could not bear the smell, sound, and sight of their Indian counterparts. The Indian&#x27;s greater size and strength easily routed the Africans.

== Battle ==
After five days of skirmishing, the two kings decided to array their troops for battle. Both placed their Phalangites in the center. Next to them they fielded the lightly armed and the mercenaries in front of which they placed their elephants and even further in the wings their cavalry. They spoke to their soldiers, took their places in the lines – Ptolemy in his left and Antiochus in his right wing – and the battle commenced.

In the beginning of the battle, the elephant contingents on the wings of both armies moved to charge. Ptolemy&#x27;s diminutive African elephants retreated in panic before the impact with the larger Indians and ran through the lines of friendly infantry arrayed behind them, causing disorder in their ranks. At the same time, Antiochus had led his cavalry to the right, rode past the left wing of the Ptolemaic elephants charging the enemy horse. The Ptolemaic and Seleucid phalanxes then engaged. However, while Antiochus had the Argyraspides, Ptolemy&#x27;s Macedonians were bolstered by the Egyptian phalanx. At the same time, the right wing of Ptolemy was retreating and wheeling to protect itself from the panicked elephants. Ptolemy rode to the center encouraging his phalanx to attack, Polybius tells us &quot;with alacrity and spirit&quot;. The Ptolemaic and Seleucid phalanxes engaged in a stiff and chaotic fight. On the Ptolemaic far right, Ptolemy&#x27;s cavalry was routing their opponents.

Antiochus routed the Ptolemaic horse posed against him and pursued the fleeing enemy en masse, believing to have won the day, but the Ptolemaic phalanxes eventually drove the Seleucid phalanxes back and soon Antiochus realized that his judgment was wrong. Antiochus tried to ride back, but by the time he rode back, his troops were routed and could no longer be regrouped. The battle had ended.

After the battle, Antiochus wanted to regroup and make camp outside the city of Raphia but most of his men had already found refuge inside and he was thus forced to enter it himself. Then he marched to Gaza and asked Ptolemy for the customary truce to bury the dead, which he was granted.

According to Polybius, the Seleucids suffered a little under 10,000 infantry dead, about 300 horse, and 5 elephants, and 4,000 men were taken prisoner. The Ptolemaic losses were 1,500 infantry, 700 horse, and 16 elephants. Most of the Ptolemies&#x27; elephants were captured by the Seleucids.

== Aftermath ==
Ptolemy&#x27;s victory secured the province of Coele-Syria for Egypt, but it was only a respite; at the Battle of Panium in 200 BC Antiochus defeated the army of Ptolemy&#x27;s young son, Ptolemy V Epiphanes and recaptured Coele Syria and Judea.

Ptolemy owed his victory in part to having a properly equipped and trained native Egyptian phalanx, which for the first time formed a large proportion of his phalangitis, thus ending his manpower problems. The self-confidence the Egyptians gained was credited by Polybius as one of the causes of the secession in 207–186 of Upper Egypt under pharaohs Hugronaphor and Ankhmakis, who created a separate kingdom that lasted nearly twenty years.

The battle of Raphia marked a turning-point in Ptolemaic history. The native Egyptian element in 2nd-century Ptolemaic administration and culture grew in influence, driven in part by Egyptians having played a major role in the battle and in part by the financial pressures on the state aggravated by the cost of the war itself. The stele that recorded the convocation of priests at Memphis in November 217, to give thanks for the victory was inscribed in Greek and hieroglyphic and demotic Egyptian: in it, for the first time, Ptolemy is given full pharaonic honours in the Greek as well as the Egyptian texts; subsequently this became the norm.

Some biblical commentators see this battle as being the one referred to in Daniel 11:11, where it says, &quot;Then the king of the South will march out in a rage and fight against the king of the North, who will raise a large army, but it will be defeated.&quot;

<doc id="927090" wikidata="Q1774014" url="?curid=927090" title="1990 NHL entry draft">
<text>The 1990 NHL entry draft was the 28th NHL entry draft. It was hosted by the Vancouver Canucks at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 16, 1990. It is remembered as one of the deeper drafts in NHL history, with fourteen of the twenty-one first round picks going on to careers of at least 500 NHL games.

Nine of the twenty-one players drafted in the first round played 1,000 NHL games in their career.

The last active player in the NHL from this draft class was Jaromir Jagr, who played his last NHL game in the 2017–18 season. As of 2024, Jagr is still an active player with Rytiri Kladno of the ELH.

==Venue==

The 1990 NHL entry draft was originally scheduled to be held at the Pacific Coliseum, the home arena of the host Vancouver Canucks located on the site of the Pacific National Exhibition (PNE). However, the Canadian Union of Public Employees union representing the PNE employees—CUPE Local 1004—threatened to strike June 15, one day before the draft. Consequently, the NHL and the Canucks decided to move the draft to BC Place in order to avoid the potential strike and issues of public access to the venue. In addition to BC Place, the University of British Columbia, the Vancouver Convention Centre and the Hyatt Regency Vancouver were also considered as replacement venues.

The Canucks had estimated that 10,000 spectators would attend the draft, which had free admission. However, holding the venue in a higher capacity venue allowed for that estimate to nearly double, with 19,127 spectators—a then record for attendance at an NHL entry draft—attending the draft.

==Top prospects==
Heading into the 1990 NHL entry draft, Mike Ricci had spent the entire 1989–90 season ranked as the top prospect by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau. Before the release of the final rankings of North American skaters and goaltenders, it was speculated Owen Nolan, Keith Primeau and Petr Nedved would surpass Ricci; however, when the final rankings were released, Ricci remained as the top prospect. Jaromir Jagr was also considered to be one of the top prospects, but Central Scouting did not rank European players. Petr Nedved was an exception to that, as he played in North America after he defected his native Czechoslovakia.

<doc id="927108" wikidata="Q1338352" url="?curid=927108" title="Hesiodus (crater)">
<text>Hesiodus is a lunar impact crater located on the southern fringes of Mare Nubium, to the northwest of the crater Pitatus. It was named after the ancient Greek poet Hesiod. Starting near the northwest rim of Hesiodus is the wide cleft named Rima Hesiodus. This rille runs 300 km east-southeastward to the Palus Epidemiarum

The low rim of Hesiodus is heavily worn, with the southwest rim being slightly intruded upon by Hesodius A. The latter is an unusual circular crater with a concentric inner wall. To the southeast, a cleft in the wall of Hesiodus joins the crater to Pitatus.

Inside Hesiodus, the floor is flooded and relatively flat. It lacks a central peak, and, instead, a small impact crater Hesiodus D lies at the middle.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hesiodus.

<doc id="927113" wikidata="Q5962726" url="?curid=927113" title="Hywel Bennett">
<text>Hywel Thomas Bennett (8 April 1944 – 24 July 2017) was a Welsh film and television actor. He had a lead role in &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966) and played the titular &quot;thinking man&#x27;s layabout&quot; James Shelley in the television sitcom &quot;Shelley&quot; (1979–1992).

Bennett played opposite Hayley Mills in &quot;The Family Way&quot;, &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968) and &quot;Endless Night&quot; (1972). Other notable film roles include Private Brigg in the comedy &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot; (1969), Dennis in &quot;Loot&quot; (1970) and Edwin Antony in &quot;Percy&quot; (1971). Bennett&#x27;s character, Ricki Tarr, was pivotal in the BBC serial adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; (1979). In later years, he was often cast in villainous roles including Mr Croup in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;Neverwhere&quot; (1996), Peter Baxter in ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; (2002) and crime boss Jack Dalton in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (2003).

==Early life==
Bennett was born on 8 April 1944 in Garnant, Carmarthenshire, Wales, the son of Sarah Gwen (née Lewis) and Gorden Bennett. His first language was Welsh; he learned to speak English in an accent he called &quot;London-Welsh&quot; after the family moved to south London when he was four. He was the brother of actor Alun Lewis, who is best known for playing Vic Windsor in &quot;Emmerdale&quot;. Bennett attended Sunnyhill School, Streatham, Henry Thornton Grammar School, Clapham (1955–62) and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.

==Career==
Bennett debuted on stage in the role of Ophelia in a Queen&#x27;s Theatre production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in 1959. He continued with the company for five years, his roles including Richmond in &quot;Richard III&quot; at the Scala Theatre in 1963. After a brief period working as a supply teacher, Bennett won a scholarship to train at Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and performed in repertory in Salisbury and Leatherhead. He made his television debut in 1964, making early appearances in episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and &quot;Theatre 625&quot;. In 1966, he appeared as the lead Willy Turner in BBC1 &quot;Wednesday Play&quot; &quot;Where the Buffalo Roam&quot;. This role as a mentally disturbed, cowboy-obsessed teenager was the first of many parts in Dennis Potter television plays.

His first film appearance was as Leonardo in the 1966 Italian &quot;Il marito è mio e l&#x27;ammazzo quando mi pare&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s my husband and I&#x27;ll decide when to kill him&quot;), directed by Pasquale Festa Campanile, a comedy in which a young wife carefully plans to murder her husband, who is 40 years her senior, to marry a young beatnik. Bennett then starred as nervously virginal newlywed Arthur Fitton opposite Hayley Mills in the Boulting brothers&#x27; adaptation of Bill Naughton&#x27;s play &quot;The Family Way&quot; (1966). He was cast after John Boulting saw him in the Alan Plater play &quot;A Smashing Day&quot; and felt he had &quot;the appearance of both sensitivity and masculinity.&quot; The success of the film gained Bennett a contract with British Lion Films and led the &quot;News of the World&quot; to dub him &quot;the face of &#x27;67&quot;. He considered his looks &quot;a boon and a curse. It won me quick fame, but I was a serious actor being written up as a pin-up boy and sex symbol... ...I used to wish for a broken nose.&quot; He was reunited with Mills and the Boultings in the psychological thriller &quot;Twisted Nerve&quot; (1968), playing Martin Durnley in what the British Film Institute has described as &quot;one of cinema&#x27;s most striking depictions of evil&quot;. In 1969, he starred as Private Brigg in &quot;The Virgin Soldiers&quot;, a comedy-drama film set during the Malayan Emergency. Bennett described the film as &quot;the story of a young soldier&#x27;s love affair with a Chinese prostitute. And his fear in combat. One day he runs the wrong way and accidentally becomes a hero.&quot; In 1969, contemporary critic Roger Ebert called him &quot;one of England&#x27;s best young actors&quot;.

Bennett&#x27;s film roles continued into the 1970s, notably with the film adaptation of Joe Orton&#x27;s &quot;Loot&quot; (1970) and &quot;Endless Night&quot; (1972), an Agatha Christie adaptation again pairing him with Hayley Mills. He was the preferred choice for the role of Brian Roberts in Bob Fosse&#x27;s &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972), but wrongly assumed it was a singing role and didn&#x27;t read the script. The part went to Michael York. He starred in the Ralph Thomas-directed sex comedies &quot;Percy&quot; (1971), in which he plays a shy young man who becomes the recipient of the world&#x27;s first penis transplant, and &quot;The Love Ban&quot; (1973). Of this period in his career, Bennett would later state &quot;I had come in at the tail end of everything, the studio system and so on. I found myself in the early 70s with nowhere to go.&quot;

He maintained a career in the theatre. His Puck in a 1967 Edinburgh Festival production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was described by &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; as &quot;the best since Leslie French&quot;. He returned to the festival in 1990 as Long John Silver in a stage adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot;. He appeared in several National Theatre productions including playing Mark Antony in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; (the Young Vic, 1972) and Marlow in the &quot;She Stoops to Conquer&quot; (the Lyttelton Theatre, 1984). Other notable roles include Prince Hal in &quot;Henry IV, Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; (the Mermaid Theatre, 1970), the lead in Hamlet on a 1974 South African tour and Andrey Prozorov in &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (the Albery Theatre, 1987). He also directed productions in provincial theatres, including a 1975 adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;I Have Been Here Before&quot; at Theatr Gwynedd, Bangor.

Bennett&#x27;s television career resumed with appearances in episodes of &quot;Play for Today&quot; (1973) and &quot;The Sweeney&quot; (1976). In 1978, he appeared in Dennis Potter&#x27;s musical drama &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; as Tom, a pimp. In 1979, Bennett appeared as the field agent Ricki Tarr in Arthur Hopcraft&#x27;s six-part BBC2 adaptation of John le Carré&#x27;s novel &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy&quot; (1979), playing the character with &quot;an ever-thinning veneer of boyish charm masking years of self-delusion and betrayal&quot; according to the BFI. Bennett then starred in two further BBC miniseries - &quot;Malice Aforethought&quot; (1979) and &quot;The Consultant&quot; (1981). In 1981, he played occult novelist Gideon Harlax in David Rudkin&#x27;s television play &quot;Artemis 81&quot;.

In 1979 he took the lead role in the Thames Television sitcom &quot;Shelley&quot; (1979–84) as the titular &quot;professional freelance layabout&quot; James Shelley, a philosophical and sardonic geography graduate with no desire to work. The series, created by Peter Tilbury, drew audiences of up to 18 million viewers. According to Bennett, &quot;the writers had done something pretty amazing. They had created what was almost a monologue and turned it into a popular sitcom.&quot; The programme resumed, initially under the title &quot;The Return of Shelley&quot;, in 1988 and continued until 1992.

During the 1980s, Bennett was the voice of British Rail in their advertisements featuring the slogan &quot;We&#x27;re getting there&quot;. He provided further voiceovers for Budweiser and Hoffmeister advertisements. In 1986, he played the investigative journalist Allan Blakeston in Paula Milne&#x27;s single drama &quot;Frankie and Johnnie&quot;, a production he described as &quot;one of the best things I&#x27;ve done in quite a long time&quot;. He lost weight to give the character a &quot;hungry and haunted look&quot;. The following year, he played an architect whose reaction to urban violence is to steadily turn his suburban home into a virtual fortress in Andy Hamilton&#x27;s black comedy &quot;Checkpoint Chiswick&quot;, part of the &quot;Tickets for the Titanic&quot; anthology series.

By the mid-1990s alcoholism and treatment for an overactive thyroid had altered Bennett&#x27;s appearance. He was often cast in unsavoury roles including club owner Arthur &#x27;Pig&#x27; Mallion in Dennis Potter&#x27;s final, linked television plays &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; (both 1996) and the villainous Mr Croup in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s serial &quot;Neverwhere&quot; (1996). On film, he played in Dr. Crippen in &quot;Deadly Advice&quot; (1994) and Jean-Baptiste Colbert in &quot;Vatel&quot; (2000). He appeared in &quot;Lock, Stock...&quot; (2000) as Deep Throat and joined the cast of the long-running soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 2003, playing Jack Dalton – the ruthless gangland kingpin of Walford. Other late television appearances include ten appearances as sex offender Peter Baxter in &quot;The Bill&quot; (2002–2005) and as Dr. Mike Vine in the first episode of &quot;Jam &amp; Jerusalem&quot; (2006). His final television role was opposite Peter Davison in an episode of &quot;The Last Detective&quot; (2007).

==Personal life and death==
In 1970 Bennett married Cathy McGowan, who had been the presenter of the music television programme &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; (1963–66). They had a daughter, Emma. The marriage was dissolved in 1988. In September 1986, Bennett sought treatment for alcoholism at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. In 1998, he married Sandra Layne Fulford and they later moved to Deal, Kent. Bennett retired from acting in 2007 after being diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. He died on 24 July 2017 at the age of 73.

<text>Ace Books is a publisher of science fiction (SF) and fantasy books founded in New York City in 1952 by Aaron A. Wyn. It began as a genre publisher of mysteries and westerns, and soon branched out into other genres, publishing its first science fiction title in 1953. This was successful, and science fiction titles outnumbered both mysteries and westerns within a few years. Other genres also made an appearance, including nonfiction, gothic novels, media tie-in novelizations, and romances. Ace became known for the &quot;tête-bêche&quot; binding format used for many of its early books, although it did not originate the format. Most of the early titles were published in this &quot;Ace Double&quot; format, and Ace continued to issue books in varied genres, bound &quot;tête-bêche&quot;, until 1973.

Ace, along with Ballantine Books, was one of the leading science fiction publishers for its first ten years of operation. The death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967 set the stage for a later decline in the publisher&#x27;s fortunes. Two leading editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr came back as editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming absorbed by Berkley Books. Ace later became an imprint of Penguin Group (USA).

==History==
===1952: Ace Doubles concept===
Editor Donald A. Wollheim was working at Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While looking for other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new paperback publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn&#x27;s Magazine Publishers. His magazines included &quot;Ace Mystery&quot; and &quot;Ace Sports&quot;, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim&#x27;s idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn&#x27;s wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.

The first book published by Ace was a pair of mysteries bound &quot;tête-bêche&quot;: Keith Vining&#x27;s &quot;Too Hot for Hell&quot;, backed with Samuel W. Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Grinning Gismo&quot;, priced at 35 cents, with serial number D-01. A &quot;tête-bêche&quot; book has the two titles bound upside-down with respect to each other, so that there are two front covers and the two texts meet in the middle. This format is generally regarded as an innovation of Ace&#x27;s; it was not, but Ace published hundreds of titles bound this way over the next twenty-one years. Books by established authors were often bound with those by lesser-known writers. Ace was &quot;notorious for cutting text&quot;, in the words of bibliographer James Corrick: even some novels labeled &quot;Complete and Unabridged&quot; were cut. Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;The Stars Like Dust&quot; was one such: it was reprinted by Ace under the title &quot;The Rebellious Stars&quot;, and cuts were made without Asimov&#x27;s approval. Similarly John Brunner repudiated the text of his novel &quot;Castaway&#x27;s World&quot; because of unauthorized cuts to the text.

Some important titles in the early D-series novels are D-15, which features William S. Burroughs&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Junkie&quot; (written under the pseudonym &quot;William Lee&quot;), and many novels by Philip K. Dick, Robert Bloch, Harlan Ellison, Harry Whittington, and Louis L&#x27;Amour, including those written under his pseudonym &quot;Jim Mayo&quot;.

The last Ace Double in the first series was John T. Phillifent&#x27;s &quot;Life with Lancelot&quot;, backed with William Barton&#x27;s &quot;Hunting on Kunderer&quot;, issued August 1973 (serial #48245). Although Ace resumed using the &quot;Ace Double&quot; name in 1974, the books were arranged conventionally rather than &quot;tête-bêche&quot;.

===1953–1963: Genre specialization===
Ace&#x27;s second title was a western (also &quot;tête-bêche&quot;): William Colt MacDonald&#x27;s &quot;Bad Man&#x27;s Return&quot;, bound with J. Edward Leithead&#x27;s &quot;Bloody Hoofs&quot;. Mysteries and westerns alternated regularly for the first thirty titles, with a few books not in either genre, such as P. G. Wodehouse&#x27;s &quot;Quick Service&quot;, bound with his &quot;The Code of the Woosters&quot;. In 1953, A. E. van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;The World of Null-A&quot;, bound with his &quot;The Universe Maker&quot;, appeared; this was Ace&#x27;s first foray into science fiction. (Earlier in 1953, Ace had released Theodore S. Drachman&#x27;s &quot;Cry Plague!&quot;, with a plot that could be regarded as science fiction, but the book it was bound with—Leslie Edgley&#x27;s &quot;The Judas Goat&quot;—is a mystery.) Another science fiction double followed later in 1953, and science fiction rapidly established itself, alongside westerns and mysteries, as an important part of Ace&#x27;s business. By 1955, the company released more science fiction titles each year than in either of the other two genres, and from 1961 onward, science fiction titles outnumbered mysteries and westerns combined. Ace also published a number of lurid juvenile delinquent novels in the 1950s that are now very collectible, such as D-343, &quot;The Young Wolves&quot; by Edward De Roo and D-378, &quot;Out for Kicks&quot; by Wilene Shaw.

With Ballantine Books, Ace was the dominant American science fiction paperback publisher in the 1950s and 1960s. Other publishers followed their lead, catering to the increasing audience for science fiction, but none matched the influence of either company. Ace published, during this period, early work by Philip K. Dick, Gordon R. Dickson, Samuel R. Delany, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Roger Zelazny.

===1964–1970: Financial struggles===
In 1964, science fiction author Terry Carr joined the company, and in 1967, he initiated the Ace Science Fiction Specials line, which published critically acclaimed original novels by such authors as R. A. Lafferty, Joanna Russ and Ursula K. Le Guin. Carr and Wollheim also co-edited an annual &quot;Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction&quot; anthology series; and Carr also edited &quot;Universe&quot;, a well-received original anthology series. &quot;Universe&quot; was initially published by Ace, although when Carr left in 1971 the series moved elsewhere.

In 1965, Ace published an unauthorized American paperback edition of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J. R. R. Tolkien, believing that the copyright had expired in the U.S. Tolkien had not wanted to publish a paperback edition, but changed his mind after the Ace edition appeared, and an authorized paperback edition was subsequently published by Ballantine Books, which included on the back cover of the paperbacks a message urging readers not to buy the unauthorized edition. Ace agreed to pay royalties to Tolkien and let its still-popular edition go out of print.

Wyn died in 1967, and the company grew financially overextended, failing to pay its authors reliably. Without money to pay the signing bonus, Wollheim was unwilling to send signed contracts to authors. On at least one occasion, a book without a valid contract went to the printer, and Wollheim later found out that the author, who was owed $3,000 by Ace, was reduced to picking fruit for a living.

===1971–2015: Ace becomes a subsidiary===
Both Wollheim and Carr left Ace in 1971. Wollheim had made plans to launch a separate paperback house, and in cooperation with New American Library, he proceeded to set up DAW Books. Carr became a freelance editor; both Carr and Wollheim went on to edit competing Year&#x27;s Best Science Fiction anthology series.

In 1969 Ace Books was acquired by Charter Communications in New York City. In 1977 Charter Communications was acquired by Grosset &amp; Dunlap, and in 1982, Grosset &amp; Dunlap was in turn acquired by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset &amp; Dunlap empire by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction imprint of its parent company.

Carr returned to Ace Books in 1984 as a freelance editor, launching a new series of Ace Specials devoted entirely to first novels. This series was even more successful than the first: it included, in 1984 alone, William Gibson&#x27;s &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, Kim Stanley Robinson&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Shore&quot;, Lucius Shepard&#x27;s &quot;Green Eyes&quot;, and Michael Swanwick&#x27;s &quot;In the Drift&quot;. All were first novels by authors now regarded as major figures in the genre. Other prominent science fiction publishing figures who have worked at Ace include Tom Doherty, who left to start Tor Books, and Jim Baen, who left to work at Tor and who eventually founded Baen Books. Writers who have worked at Ace include Frederik Pohl and Ellen Kushner.

In 1996, Penguin Group (USA) acquired the Putnam Berkley Group, and has retained Ace as its science fiction imprint. As of December 2012, recently published authors included Joe Haldeman, Charles Stross, Laurell K. Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds, and Jack McDevitt. Penguin merged with Random House in 2013 to form Penguin Random House, which continues to own Berkley. Ace&#x27;s editorial team is also responsible for the Roc Books imprint, although the two imprints maintain a separate identity.

==Ace nomenclature==
Until the late 1980s, Ace titles had two main types of serial numbers: letter series, such as &quot;D-31&quot; and &quot;H-77&quot;, and numeric, such as &quot;10293&quot; and &quot;15697&quot;. The letters were used to indicate a price. The following is a list of letter series with their date ranges and prices.

* D-series: 35¢, 1952 to 1962.
* S-series: 25¢, 1952 to 1956.
* T-series: 40¢. This series is listed in Tuck&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia&quot;, but he gives no examples in his index and there are none cited in other bibliographic sources. This series may, therefore, not exist.
* F-series: 40¢, 1961 to 1967.
* M-series: 45¢, 1964 to 1967.
* G-series: 50¢, 1958 to 1960 (D/S/G series); 1964 to 1968 (later series).
* K-series: various prices, 1959 to 1966.
* H-series: 60¢, 1966 to 1968.
* A-series: 75¢, 1963 to 1968.
* N-series: 95¢, 1968.

The first series of Ace books began in 1952 with D-01, a western in &quot;tête-bêche&quot; format: Keith Vining&#x27;s &quot;Too Hot for Hell&quot; backed with Samuel W. Taylor&#x27;s &quot;The Grinning Gismo&quot;. That series continued until D-599, Patricia Libby&#x27;s &quot;Winged Victory for Nurse Kerry&quot;, but the series also included several G and S serial numbers, depending on the price. The D and S did not indicate &quot;Double&quot; (i.e., &quot;tête-bêche&quot;) or &quot;Single&quot;; there are D-series titles that are not &quot;tête-bêche&quot;, although none of the &quot;tête-bêche&quot; titles have an S serial number. Towards the end of this initial series, the F series began (at a new price), and thereafter there were always several different letter series in publication simultaneously. The D and S prefixes did not appear again after the first series, but the G prefix acquired its own series starting with G-501. Hence the eight earlier G-series titles can be considered part of a different series to the G-series proper. All later series after the first kept independent numbering systems, starting at 1 or 101. The &quot;tête-bêche&quot; format proved attractive to book collectors, and some rare titles in mint condition command prices over $1,000.

<doc id="927142" wikidata="Q6540943" url="?curid=927142" title="Liberalism in the Czech Republic">
<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism in the [[Czech Republic]]. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties label themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
When liberalism started in the Czech lands, they were member states of Austria-Hungary. Liberals in the region started as part of the conservative nationalist National Party (&quot;Národní strana&quot;) or Old Czechs, but from 1874 they formed their own party: the National Liberal Party (&quot;Národní strana svobodomyslná&quot;), also known as the Young Czechs. Czech liberals usually do not call themselves liberals, but prefer labels such as progressive or even national socialist (which has nothing to do with the German variant).

==History==

The liberal movement is currently unsuccessful in this country. Liberal parties are small or in decline and are unable to cooperate. They were unsuccessful at the 2004 European elections. At these elections the European Democrats (&quot;Evropští demokraté&quot;) proved to be a liberal alternative, but it joined the EPP.

=== National Liberal Party ===
*1874: Liberals in Bohemia seceded from the National Party and formed the National Liberal Party.
*1889: A faction of the &quot;National Party&quot; joined the National Liberal Party.
*1897: The ⇒ Radical Progressive Party seceded from the party.
*1899: The ⇒ Czech State Rights Radical Party seceded from the party.
*1900: A faction seceded as the ⇒ Czech People&#x27;s Party.
*1918: The party merged with the ⇒ Czech State Rights Radical Party, the National Party and others into the mainly conservative Czech State Rights Democrats (&quot;Česká státoprávní demokracie&quot;), renamed in 1919 as the Czechoslovak National Democracy (&quot;Československá národní demokracie&quot;).
*1924: Allies of president Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk left the party to form the ⇒ National Labour Party.
*1934: After the party developed into a national-conservative party, it joined the National Unification (&quot;Národní sjedonocení&quot;).

=== Czech People&#x27;s Party / Czech Progressive Party ===
*1887: A second faction of liberals seceded from the National Party and joined the ⇒ National Liberal Party in 1889.
*1900: This faction formed the Czech People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Česká strana lidová&quot;).

<text>Mambo a Go Go, is a music video game produced by Konami as part of their BEMANI franchise of games. Players must rhythmically beat conga drums as colored notes fall from the top of the screen. There are 3 drums, each one divided into three sections, giving players a maximum of nine places to hit.

The game predominantly features Latin music including &quot;Mambo No. 5&quot;, &quot;La Bamba&quot; and &quot;El Bimbo&quot;, the song that served as the basis for &quot;El Ritmo Tropical&quot; used in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series.

&quot;Mambo a Go Go&quot; is likely one of the most obscure BEMANI games released, as it was overshadowed by another music game produced by Sega; &quot;Samba de Amigo&quot;. Despite this, some songs such as &quot;Gamelan de Couple&quot; and &quot;La Bamba&quot; were popular enough to make appearances in other BEMANI series games such as &quot;beatmania&quot;, &quot;Dance Dance Revolution, and pop&#x27;n music&quot;.

A release of &quot;Mambo a Go Go&quot; in the United States under the title &quot;Mambo King&quot; was planned, but never materialized.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Mambo a Go Go&quot; on their September 1, 2001 issue as being the eleventh most-successful dedicated arcade game of the month.

<doc id="927152" wikidata="Q7181570" url="?curid=927152" title="Phi Tau">
<text>Phi Tau () is a coeducational fraternity at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, USA. Founded in 1905 as the Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa, the organization separated from the national fraternity in 1956 over a dispute regarding the segregationist membership policies of the national organization. The fraternity renamed itself Phi Tau Fraternity, and in 1972 became the first fraternity at Dartmouth to admit women student members. Today, Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity is one of only three remaining, officially recognized coeducational Greek organizations on the Dartmouth College campus.

==History==

===Phi Sigma Kappa===
Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity at Dartmouth College was founded as the Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa in 1905. Phi Sigma Kappa was the sixteenth fraternity to open a chapter at Dartmouth. Being a relatively late arrival on campus, prime lots on Webster Avenue, where most of the other fraternities were located, were unavailable. With the help of the national organization, a house for the fraternity was purchased on what was then the northern edge of the college campus. By the late 1920s, however, the house had begun to show its age, and a building campaign resulted in the demolition of the old building and the construction of a new building during the 1927-1928 academic year. This new house was built with three stories above ground with a basement, and included living quarters for eighteen students (the maximum permitted by the College at the time.) Although the new residence included a kitchen, fraternities at Dartmouth were not allowed to serve meals on a regular basis, and the kitchen was used primarily by the residents and during social functions. Over the years, there were many changes to the building, including two different porches constructed on the south side of the building, the installation of sump pumps which allowed finishing of rooms in the basement, and the relocation of the boiler room, social areas, and even a staircase.

The brotherhood of the Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa underwent a great transition in the years of World War II and immediately afterward. Many members of the classes of 1942 through 1945 were rushed through their academic studies and went off to war without so much as a graduation ceremony. At the same time, the U.S. Navy organized a V-12 Navy College Training Program on the Dartmouth College campus. Many Phi Sigma Kappa men from Dartmouth went off to war, and at least one spent time as a prisoner of war. When these same brothers returned to finish their education after the war, attitudes in the house were less innocent, which changed how the brotherhood treated one another. Certain pre-war pledge activities, for example, were completely eliminated, as their shock value no longer entertained anyone.

===Separation from Phi Sigma Kappa===
The post-WWII era was a time of rapid social change, facilitated by the integration of the US Military. Colleges and universities were the next locus of change as returning GIs flocked to the educational opportunities granted under the G.I. Bill, many of whom rejected the former class and race rigidity that was the status quo on their campuses. This was more strongly true in the older East Coast schools, but appeared soon at college locations in the West, Midwest and even the South. Like some of its other chapters, the Tau chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa had a history of being progressive about its membership. Until 1952, the Phi Sigma Kappa national organization did not have a formal policy regarding membership of ethnic or religious minorities in its written charter or regulations, while it did host the occasional foreign student. However, the influx of new collegians of all races led some chapters to push for legislation to encourage all local chapters to avoid admitting minorities to membership. In a contentious debate in 1952, the matter was brought to a head, with opposition to this restriction voiced by Tau chapter members, among others. A policy was adopted, narrowly, called &quot;The Bedford Resolution&quot;, which read: &quot;That the fraternity&#x27;s tradition be maintained in the sense that there be no pledging or initiating of Negro men until such time as they are acceptable to all chapters.&quot; &quot;Bedford&quot; was not written into the national organization&#x27;s bylaws, but its short-term effect was nevertheless destructive: Phi Sigma Kappa chapters at Boston University and Knox College were both expelled from the national organization in 1953 for pledging African-American students. The Tau Chapter had been quietly opposed to this agreement, and had already admitted several Jewish men into the house. A campus-wide referendum on the desegregation of fraternities in 1954 resulted in a slim majority of Dartmouth students favoring mandatory desegregation of fraternities by 1960. This became a binding policy of the college administration.
Many Dartmouth Phi Sigma Kappa brothers held out hope that the national organization might eventually reverse the Bedford Resolution, but while they awaited a legislative solution, Richard Scobie, class of 1956, reports that some were dismayed by examples of &quot;racist attitudes of certain leaders.&quot; Several national organization leaders and their wives visited Dartmouth for a party celebrating the Tau chapter&#x27;s 50th anniversary in May, 1955. National President A.L. Atcheson, District Director Bob Abbe, and District Deputy Sam Sargent all attended. Scobie relays, &quot;Abbe was reported to have commented to several brothers, including Dick Taft, class of 1956 and then vice-president of the chapter, Well, it&#x27;s this way. We&#x27;ve got to watch out for all minority groups; not just the Negroes. In different areas you&#x27;ve got to watch out for different things, sometimes it&#x27;s Italians, sometimes it&#x27;s Jews, sometimes it&#x27;s Negroes.&quot; Unbeknownst to Abbe, Dick Taft was Jewish. However, this anecdotal report has no corroboration in other sources; Abbe himself was Jewish, and Phi Sigma Kappa had already had a number of Jewish members. However, Scobie made the claim that this was the cause for &quot;&quot;many in the chapter [to be] outraged and [offer] proposals to &quot;go local&quot; or to affiliate with a different national fraternity at the house meeting immediately following the visit. [However] no consensus was reached at the time, with the end of the academic year rapidly approaching.&quot;&quot;

Nationally, &quot;Bedford&quot; had proven to be harmful, and had been repealed by the National fraternity at the 1954 convention only two years after it had passed. It was replaced by a much weaker, unwritten &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement,&quot; with similar provisions but no real legislative teeth, which more progressive leaders thought they could use to soothe the process of change for trailing chapters. For some chapters, this was enough, but for others, like Tau, the demand for change would allow no mitigating steps. &quot;Tau&quot; did not attend the 1954 convention in Roanoke, Virginia.

The movement for Tau to secede from the Phi Sigma Kappa national was rejuvenated in the early winter of 1956. Scobie, then outgoing chapter president, personally resigned his affiliation with the national fraternity in a letter in which he accused Phi Sigma Kappa of &quot;black reactionary ideals.&quot; A week later debate continued, and the first vote to disaffiliate failed to gain the two-thirds majority called for in the motion with a result of 41 local, 20 national, and 3 abstaining. A week later on March 7, 1956, the Tau chapter voted again to permanently separate from the national organization, with the ballot this time passing 54 local to 7 national. After briefly considering the name Phi Sigma Tau, the house decided to name themselves Phi Tau Fraternity. The history of the separation was chronicled by Dick Scobie for his senior thesis.

Phi Tau was thus formed in May 1956. Ironically, it still won the debate on the national level: Phi Sigma Kappa voted at its next convention, just two months later in July 1956, to rescind the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement,&quot; and with this action its chapters became free to admit members of all races. It had lost reactionary Tau, but, Phi Sig, to its credit, became one of the first national fraternities to put to rest strife over race. That same year, 1956, its Phi chapter at Swarthmore pledged a black man from the Gold Coast, with no reaction from national leadership. Many national fraternities struggled with this issue into the 1980s.

Phi Sigma Kappa has remained male-only, having itself had little call to change that policy. However, should that call ever come, among fraternities, a workable co-ed solution may be observed, where several national fraternities have adopted co-ed &quot;Society&quot; versions of themselves, as parallel organizations, to accommodate those chapters that choose to become co-educational. An example is the Alpha Delta Phi fraternity and the Alpha Delta Phi Society, the latter of which hosts its co-ed chapters and where both use the fraternity&#x27;s symbols. Phi Sigma Kappa has never been petitioned for similar formation of a co-ed &quot;branch,&quot; thus how it would respond is unknown. However, it &quot;has&quot; expressed strong interest in reopening closed and &#x27;legacy&#x27; chapters on its older campuses.

Today, Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s stated anti-discrimination policy is progressive: &quot;No chapter shall discriminate in recruitment or in membership based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, ethnic background, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, parental status, or political affiliation.&quot;

===Coeducation to the present===
Dartmouth College began to admit women students with the freshman class of 1972, which resulted in women members being allowed under current Dartmouth College rules of being accepted to fraternities during the spring semester of 1973. During the winter of 1972/1973, Phi Tau initiated a vote to allow it to become the first coeducational fraternity at Dartmouth College, and to admit women beginning in the spring rush year of 1973. When the organization&#x27;s constitution was rewritten to reflect the new local status of the brotherhood in 1956, gender references were deliberately excluded from the text, making the house officially coeducational before the college itself. The vote in 1973 formally confirmed the membership policy. Unlike other coeducational Greek houses, members of Phi Tau have continued to refer to one another as &quot;brothers&quot;, regardless of their gender. Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek house at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them, and was the first fraternity at the College to add sexual preference to its non-discrimination clause.

In the 1980s, the Phi Tau residence began to face serious structural problems after the removal of a porch on the south side of the building. The walls of the building were constructed out of brick. Presented with different loads and stresses, the north wall began to bulge outward by nearly half a meter, and was literally threatening to explode. Large steel plates were placed on the outside of the building and steel tie rods were threaded through the building between the ground and second floor to pull the plates together and force the exterior walls to straighten. A new tradition began of articles in alumni newsletters proclaiming, &quot;The north wall is still standing!&quot;
The College introduced undergraduate societies to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations. Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, undergraduate societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies. Panarchy, a coeducational fraternity with a 97-year history at Dartmouth, voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called Amarna. Phi Tau chose to remain a Greek house. In 1999, the College administration announced a &quot;Residential and Social Life Initiative&quot; to improve campus life. Speculation that all Greek houses at Dartmouth College might be forced to open admissions to anyone who wanted to join drew attention to Phi Tau&#x27;s status as an already coeducational institution, but one that still held to Greek traditions. Then house president Virginia DeJesus-Rueff, class of 2000, defended Phi Tau&#x27;s policy of self-selection.

In 2000, Dartmouth College unveiled a new master plan for the north side of the campus. The development plan called for the creation of a green on the northern side of the libraries in the center of campus, and anticipated the use of a portion of the property owned by Phi Tau. The fraternity entered into negotiations to sell of property to the College in exchange for the funds and construction support to build a new house to replace the existing Phi Tau building. The new structure was built during the summer and fall academic terms of 2002, for a sum in excess of $1.8 million. The new structure was located between North Main Street and the 1928 house. Student members of Phi Tau continued to occupy the old house during construction of the new building. Phi Tau brothers began living in the new house in the winter term of 2003, and the house built in 1928 was demolished in January, 2003.

==Membership and activities==

Like other fraternities and sororities, membership in Phi Tau is self-selective. The process of joining Phi Tau, called &quot;rush,&quot; invites potential student members to apply for admission. Members of the house then deliberate on these applications at an official house meeting and decide whether or not to offer a bid to each prospective new member. Anyone offered a bid to join may &quot;sink&quot; the bid, and thereby join the house, whenever they wish to do so until they graduate. Phi Tau, like most other Greek organizations in the United States, has a pledge period. Like all Dartmouth College Greek organizations, Phi Tau holds a weekly house meeting at which only brothers and faculty advisors may be in attendance.

==Associations==

Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity is owned by the non-profit Tau Corporation of Hanover, New Hampshire. All past and present members of the fraternity are voting members of the not-for-profit corporation, which meets at least annually. Phi Tau Coeducational Fraternity is a recognized fraternal student organization of Dartmouth College and is a member organization of the Co-Ed Council. Phi Tau has had a long-standing charitable relationship with the Karnak Shriners of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, supporting their Hospital for Burned Children. A major Phi Tau social event each summer is the Shriners Day Parade down North Main Street in front of the Phi Tau house. Another important charitable relationship for Phi Tau is the Upper Valley Humane Society.

<text>Lamé is a lunar impact crater located astride the northeast rim of the crater Langrenus, to the east of Mare Fecunditatis. The eastern crater rim appears overlaid by a series of overlapping craters that form an intermittent chain flowing nearly a hundred kilometers to the south. The crater rim protrudes only slightly above the surrounding terrain, but it has a significant where the rim lies within Vendelinus. In the middle of the floor is a slight ridge, forming a central peak.

On some older maps this crater was called Smith. It was previously designated Vendelinus C before being renamed by the IAU.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Lamé.

<doc id="927162" wikidata="Q6984087" url="?curid=927162" title="Neal D. Barnard">
<text>Neal D. Barnard (born 10 July 1953) is an American animal rights activist, physician and founding president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM). Barnard has authored books advocating a whole food plant-based dietary eating pattern.

==Early life and education==
Barnard was born and grew up in Fargo, North Dakota. He received medical training at George Washington University School of Medicine, where he began exploring vegan diets. He is board certified by the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology, a fellow of the American College of Cardiology and a lifetime member of the American Medical Association.

Barnard is an activist for animal rights. He is associated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and has written for their magazine &quot;Animal Times&quot;.

==Career==
Barnard founded Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine (PCRM) in 1985 to promote preventive medicine. By 2016, the Washington D.C.–based PCRM had 150,000 members, including 12,000 physicians, and reported revenues of more than $20 million. He appeared in the documentaries &quot;Super Size Me&quot; (2004), &quot;Forks Over Knives&quot; (2011), &quot;PlantPure Nation&quot; (2015), and &quot;What the Health&quot; (2017). Since 2003, Barnard has served as an adjunct professor of medicine at George Washington University School of Medicine. In January 2016, Barnard founded the Barnard Medical Center in Washington, D.C., which provides primary care with a focus on nutrition guidance.

In his active practice, Barnard works with patients with diabetes, obesity, and other conditions in clinical research protocols. He plays cello, guitar, and keyboards. He has been a member of the bands Pop Maru, Verdun, and Carbonworks. Alec Baldwin once called Barnard &quot;Eddie Van Halen with a medical degree&quot;.

In 2011, Barnard was inducted into the Vegetarian Hall of Fame of the North American Vegetarian Society during its summer conference, where he has occasionally spoken.

In February 2013, Barnard published the book &quot;Power Foods for the Brain: An Effective 3-Step Plan to Protect Your Mind and Strengthen Your Memory&quot;. In the book, Barnard discusses research on the effects of food choices on the brain, such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease risk, as well as plant-based diets in &quot;Blue Zones&quot; and the connection between food choices and longevity.

By 2019, Barnard had authored 20 books, including &quot;The Vegan Starter Kit: Everything You Need to Know about Plant-based Eating&quot;.

He has hosted four PBS television programs on nutrition and health.

==Diabetes==
Barnard authored the 2009 book &quot;Dr Neal Barnard&#x27;s Program for Reversing Diabetes&quot;. It argues that a low-fat vegan diet can stabilize blood sugar and insulin function and minimize medication within weeks. Jim Mann has commented that although a low-fat vegan diet can help to promote weight loss to manage diabetes &quot;some of the claims made by the author are overrated; in particular, to imply that Type 1 diabetes can be reversed is mischievous&quot;.

Elaine Rush stated that although the book does include some sound advice, &quot;not all diabetes can be reversed and therefore the title of this book is misleading.&quot; She also suggested that Barnard&#x27;s low-fat vegan diet would not be suitable for children or pregnant women without expert support. Peter Lipson of &quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot; has criticized Barnard&#x27;s views on low-fat vegan diets reversing type 2 diabetes as based on only one study, commenting &quot;This is not a study on which to hang an entire medical philosophy&quot;. According to Lipton, weight loss is more important than a specific type of diet in determining diabetes improvement and the idea that a particular diet is a panacea is untrue.

==Awards==
*Lifestyle Medicine Trailblazer Award, 2016 from The American College of Lifestyle Medicine (ACLM)
*6th Plantrician Project Luminary Award, 2019 – from The Plantrician Project

==Personal life==
Barnard plays cello, guitar, and keyboards and has been a member of the bands Pop Maru, Verdun, and Carbonworks.

<doc id="927174" wikidata="Q1434490" url="?curid=927174" title="Maestlin (crater)">
<text>Maestlin is a small, bowl-shaped impact crater located near the eastern edge of the lunar Oceanus Procellarum. It was named after German mathematician Michael Maestlin. To the east lies the crater Encke and to the northeast is Kepler. Just to the southeast of Maestlin is the curved, ridge-like remains of Maestlin R, a walled plain that has been almost completed submerged by the mare. South of this feature is a system of linear rilles named Rimae Maestlin. The mare surface around Maestlin is dusted with ray material from Kepler.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on Lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Maestlin.

<text>The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander is a British light utility aircraft and regional airliner designed and originally manufactured by Britten-Norman of the United Kingdom. Still in production, the Islander is one of the best-selling commercial aircraft types produced in Europe. Although designed in the 1960s, over 750 are still in service with commercial operators around the world. The aircraft is a light transport with over 30 military aviation operators around the world.

Initial aircraft were manufactured at Britten-Norman&#x27;s factory in Bembridge, Isle of Wight, UK. After Fairey Aviation acquired the Britten-Norman company, its Islanders and Trislander aircraft were built in Romania, then shipped to Avions Fairey in Belgium for finishing before being flown to the UK for flight certification. The Islander has been in production for more than 50 years.

In September 2023, it was announced that production of the Islander has returned to the UK, after fifty-five years of manufacturing abroad. Several countries made Letters of Intent to buy Islanders, creating new jobs and possibly a new hangar. 

==Development==
===Origins===
In 1953, Britten-Norman was formed for the purpose of converting and operating agricultural aircraft, amongst other vehicles such as the Cushioncraft hovercraft. In 1963, the firm initiated development work upon what would become the Islander, having sensed a demand for a simple and inexpensive twin-piston engine aircraft. The founders, John Britten and Desmond Norman, had observed the rapid growth of the commuter airline sector, and concluded that capacity was of a higher value to these operators than either range or cruising speed, thus the Islander emphasized payload over either of these attributes.

Through the use of low wing- and span-loading to generate greater effectiveness than conventional counterparts, the Islander could lift considerably heavier payloads than the typical aircraft in its power, weight or cost classes. To reduce manufacturing costs, both the wings and tail surfaces maintain a constant chord and thickness, while the ribs within the aircraft&#x27;s wing are all identical; both rivets and external fishplate joints are used for the same purpose. The type was originally intended to use a fabric-and-steel design. A light alloy monocoque approach was adopted instead. The structure is designed to give rise to and experience low levels of stress, and has an infinite fatigue life without testing.
On 13 June 1965, the first prototype BN-2 Islander conducted its maiden flight, powered by a pair of Rolls-Royce/Continental IO-360B piston engines; only four days later, the prototype appeared at the Paris Air Show. The IO-360B engines were later replaced by more powerful Lycoming O-540-E engines, which were located further outboard on the wings, for superior single-engine climb performance. On 20 August 1966, a second BN-2 prototype performed its first flight. These prototype aircraft, while resembling subsequent production models for the most part, were outfitted with different, less powerful engines. On 24 April 1967, the first production Islander performed its first flight; UK type certification was received in August 1967, US authorities also certified the type in December 1967.

Initial production of the Islander started at the Britten-Norman factory at Bembridge on the Isle of Wight; however, within a few years the company found that it could not produce the aircraft at a sufficient rate to keep up with the customer demand. To expand production, a contract was placed with Intreprinderea de Reparatii Material Aeronautic (IRMA) of Romania, initially to assemble kit-form aircraft, which were then sent to the UK for completion. In August 1969, the first Romanian-assembled Islander performed its first flight. IRMA proved successful at economically producing the aircraft, producing roughly 30-40 aircraft per year at times, and eventually became the primary manufacturing site for the Islander. In 1977, IRMA received a contract for the production of a further 100 Islanders; from that point on, the firm produced all subsequent Islander aircraft. More than 500 of the type were manufactured in Romania.

In 1970, a military version of the Islander, marketed as the Defender, conducted its first flight. Modifications included the addition of underwing hardpoints for armaments/equipment, and the main cabin area being fitted out for light troop transport and support aircraft duties. The Defender capitalised on the aircraft&#x27;s rugged structure, making it suitable for long-term operations in developing countries. Purchases from police and military customers have typically been for use in surveillance and counter-terrorism operations. The &quot;Maritime Defender&quot; is another military version of the Islander, intended for search and rescue, coastal patrol and fishery protection.
===Further development===
Despite the relative success of the Islander, Britten-Norman experienced wider financial difficulties during the late 1960s, ultimately resulting in the company entering receivership in October 1971. In August 1972, Britten-Norman was purchased by the Fairey Aviation Group, forming the Fairey Britten-Norman company; shortly thereafter, the majority of manufacturing activity for both the Islander and Trislander was transferred to its Avions Fairey factory in Gosselies, Belgium. Completed aircraft were flown to Bembridge for final customer preparation prior to delivery.
Fairey Aviation set about the development of a more powerful model, the Turbo Islander, equipped with a pair of Lycoming LTP101 turboprop engines. However, testing revealed that the LTP101 engines were too powerful for the aircraft; thus, following a period of re-designing, the project evolved into the Turbine Islander (BN-2T), equipped with a pair of Allison 250 turboprop engines instead. However, Fairey encountered financial difficulty, resulting in the Fairey Britten-Norman company entering receivership and the firm&#x27;s acquisition by Oerlikon Buerle of Switzerland, leading to the formation of Pilatus Britten-Norman, whereupon some production activity was transferred back to Bembridge.

Another development was a turbo-normalizing system with RaJay turbocharger for the -2, -3, -6, -8, and -9 models allowing full power up to with attendant increase in true airspeed and takeoff and climb performance. Presently Talco in Texas holds the STC.

In 1969, an improved version, the &quot;BN-2A Islander&quot;, conducted its maiden flight. It incorporated aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, such as lower-drag engine cowlings and undercarriage, an improved interior, and an expanded rear baggage area with external access. In 1970, to improve hot-and-high performance, more powerful Lycoming O-540-K1-B5 engines were made available, alongside optional tiptanks and an elongated nose to house baggage.
In 1977, a single standard BN-2 was refitted with Dowty Rotol ducted fans. The ducted fan produced less noise than conventional propeller propulsion. Some structural strengthening of the main wing spar at the root was required due to the extra weight. This aircraft was subject to 18 months of flying trials to test the suitability of the ducted fan as a means of reducing aircraft noise; these tests reportedly demonstrated a 20 decibel noise reduction as well as increased thrust and reduced pollution.

In 1978, a further improved version, the &quot;BN-2B Islander II&quot;, was produced as a result of a product improvement program. The BN-2B model involved several changes, including a redesigned cockpit and a reduction in cabin noise levels. In 1980, it was decided to make available turboprop engines for the type, adopting twin Allison 250-B17C engines; when the latter are installed, the aircraft is designated the &quot;BN-2T Turbine Islander&quot;. The first such BN-2T entered service in 1981.

In February 1999, the acquisition of Romaero, the Romanian manufacturer of the Islander, by Britten-Norman Group was announced. By May 2006, a greater sales emphasis was being placed upon the Defender over the Islander. In December 2006, aerospace publication &quot;Flight International&quot; observed that: &quot;The only civil aircraft that remains in production in the UK is the tiny Britten-Norman Islander&quot;.

In early 2008, B-N was studying a version powered by aircraft diesel engines with SMA Engines, already offering the SMA SR305-230.
In May 2010, Britten-Norman announced that manufacturing of the Islander would be relocated from Romania to a new site in the UK, due to the rising costs of production in Romania.

====Return to UK manufacture====
In 2023 Britten-Norman reactivated their original production line at Bembridge in the Isle of Wight and closed down overseas manufacture. New aircraft, to be produced at two per year initially and rising thereafter, are expected to continue the practice of incorporating progressive improvements to the current design. These include a glass cockpit from Garmin.

====Electric Project Fresson====

In conjunction with Britten-Norman, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions (CAeS), a subsidiary of Cranfield University, is developing an electric propulsion system for the over 700 Islanders currently operated.

===Trislander===
In 1968, the original second Islander prototype was re-used for a further development programme, being modified into a stretched aircraft with greater capacity, referred to as the &quot;Super Islander&quot;. However, the Super Islander programme was aborted without proceeding to certification. The prototype later received further design changes to produce the three-engined version, the &quot;BN-2A Mk III Trislander&quot;. This aircraft has a stretched fuselage, modified landing gear and a third engine, which is mounted on the tail. On 11 September 1970, the Trislander prototype conducted its maiden flight, appearing at the 1970 Farnborough Air Show the same day.

==Design==

The Britten-Norman BN-2 Islander is a high-wing cantilever monoplane with a rectangular fuselage and two wing-mounted engines; early aircraft were equipped with a pair of piston engines while later production models may be alternatively fitted with turboprop engines in their place. The rectangular cross section fuselage, which is furnished with a conventional tail unit and fixed tricycle landing gear, can accommodate a single pilot and up to nine passengers in a commuter configuration, or operate in a mixed cargo/passenger capacity. The cabin can be rapidly reconfigured, allowing for a single aircraft to undertake a diverse range of tasks within a minimal period of time. Often referring to the type as &quot;The world&#x27;s most versatile aircraft&quot;, Britten-Norman promotes the Islander&#x27;s low direct operating costs, minimal maintenance, and its stability in flight as major attributes of the aircraft.

The original Islander was designed with an emphasis upon providing ease of access within the short haul sector to remote locations as a safe, efficient, and profitable transport aircraft. It has been regularly used by such operators, including the frequent use of unprepared rough airstrips and from challenging terrain; the Islander being capable of short takeoff and landing (STOL) operations. The low load height and wide side doors provide for easy access for passenger and cargo operations, while the aircraft&#x27;s ability to maintain a high takeoff frequency has led to the type&#x27;s use for parachuting. For operating within noise-sensitive environments, silencers can be equipped on both the aircraft&#x27;s engine and propellers.

Designed as a small and inexpensive commuter/utility aircraft, various cabin configurations and equipment loadouts are available to suit a wide variety of different purposes, including charter flights, scheduled flights, agricultural uses, aerial firefighting, air freight VIP/executive transport, aerial surveillance, air ambulance, paradropping, and law enforcement. The design programme can be entirely personalized, allowing each customer to be involved in every area of the aircraft&#x27;s manufacture to mold it to their preferences. Later versions of the Islander offer various options, including enlarged bay doors, 3-bladed scimitar propellers, low drag fairings, modern interior, ergonomic leather seating, in-flight entertainment systems, and alternative seat arrangements; underwing hardpoints can also be installed for carrying pod, spray booms and other external stores.

==Operational history==

Immediately following commercial availability, US distributor Jonas Aircraft ordered 30 Islanders, and placed orders for another 112 aircraft within a year. When equipped with four 54-gallon fuel tanks, the Islander was able to ferry itself across the transatlantic route, via Gander International Airport, Newfoundland, for US deliveries. The Islander&#x27;s long-range capabilities were highlighted when the type won the 1969 London-Sydney air race.

In 1974, sales of the Islander surpassed the 548-order record for British multi-engine commercial aircraft. In 1982, another production milestone was reached with the delivery of the 1,000th Islander. From the 1980s onwards, sales noticeably declined; according to Britten-Norman Chief Executive William Hynett, this was due to the global market having become saturated by the type and there being only a low civil demand for additional aircraft, in part due to the longevity of in-service Islanders. As of 2016, Britten-Norman claim that the Islander is in daily service with roughly 500 operators in more than 120 countries.

Between 1976 and 2006, Scottish airline Loganair operated a number of Islanders as air ambulances, covering areas such as the island communities in the Hebrides. The Islander services Loganair&#x27;s Westray to Papa Westray flight, the shortest scheduled flight in the world at ; the scheduled flight time including taxiing is two minutes.

Several commuter airlines and general aviation charter operators in the U.S. also flew the Islander including Stol Air Commuter in scheduled passenger service in northern California from their San Francisco International Airport (SFO) hub and Channel Islands Aviation in southern California which used the aircraft for the flights to Channel Islands National Park. Another U.S. commuter airline operator was Wings Airways which operated high frequency shuttle service into the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).

By October 2019, 800 Islanders were in service including around 600 used for short flights.

On August 28, 2023, Torres Strait Air stated that it is investing $16.3 million to upgrade its fleet with ten new Britten-Norman Islander aircraft.

<text>Penguin Group is a British trade book publisher and part of Penguin Random House, which is owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann. The new company was created by a merger that was finalised on 1 July 2013, with Bertelsmann initially owning 53% of the joint venture, and Pearson PLC initially owning the remaining 47%. Since 18 December 2019, Penguin Random House has been wholly owned by Bertelsmann.

Penguin Books has its registered office in City of Westminster, London.

Its British division is Penguin Books Ltd. Other separate divisions are located in the United States, Ireland, New Zealand, India, Australia, Canada, China, Brazil and South Africa.

==History==
Penguin Books Ltd. (est. 1935) of the United Kingdom was bought by Pearson Longman in 1970. In 1975, Penguin acquired the American hardcover firm Viking Press. In 1986, Penguin acquired the New American Library, a mass-market paperback publisher. In 1995, Penguin acquired the independent publisher Donald I. Fine.

Penguin Group (USA) Inc. was formed in 1996 as a result of the merger between Penguin Books USA and the Putnam Berkley Group after Penguin acquired Putnam Berkley from MCA. The newly formed company was originally called Penguin Putnam Inc., but, in 2003, it changed its name to Penguin Group (USA) Inc. to reflect the parent Pearson PLC&#x27;s grouping of all the Penguin companies worldwide under the supervisory umbrella of Pearson&#x27;s own Penguin Group division.

The different Penguin companies use many imprints, many of which used to be independent publishers. Penguin Group (USA) Inc. also operates its own speaker&#x27;s bureau that books speaking engagements for many of the publisher&#x27;s authors. In 2011, the online writing and publishing community Book Country was launched as a subsidiary of Penguin Group USA.

On 11 April 2012, the United States Department of Justice filed &quot;United States v. Apple Inc.&quot;, naming Apple, Penguin, and four other major publishers as defendants. The suit alleged that they conspired to fix prices for e-books and weaken Amazon.com&#x27;s position in the market in violation of antitrust law. In December 2013, a federal judge approved a settlement of the antitrust claims, in which Penguin and the other publishers paid into a fund that provided credits to customers who had overpaid for books due to the price-fixing.

On 26 October 2012, Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House. The houses were considered two of the &#x27;Big Six&#x27; publishing companies prior to the merger, which became the &#x27;Big Five&#x27; upon its completion. The European Union approved the Penguin Random House merger on 5 April 2013.

<doc id="927185" wikidata="Q721099" url="?curid=927185" title="LWD Junak">
<text>The LWD/WSK Junak was a Polish trainer aircraft, used from 1952 to 1961 by the Polish Air Force and until 1972 by Polish civilian operators. It was designed by the LWD bureau and produced by the WSK Warszawa-Okęcie factory.

==Development==
The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement of 1946 for a trainer to replace the Soviet UT-2, which was obsolete. The new aircraft was designed in 1947 in the LWD (&quot;Lotnicze Warsztaty Doświadczalne&quot; - Aircraft Experimental Workshops) - the first Polish post-war construction bureau. The chief designer was Tadeusz Sołtyk. A prototype named the LWD Junak, later the Junak 1, was flown on February 22, 1948 (its name means &quot;brave young man&quot;). The entire design was Polish, except for the engine, which was a license-built Soviet radial, the Shvetsov M-11D (93 kW, 125 hp).

After tests, an improved variant, the Junak 2 was flown on July 12, 1949. Notable changes from the Junak 1 included the cockpit being moved forward, the fin being increased in area, a more powerful M-11FR engine (118 kW, 160 hp) was fitted and the massive landing gear covers were deleted. The plane&#x27;s handling improved. The LWD team disbanded in 1950 and Junak 2 development was continued by the CSS workshops in Warsaw. After further improvements the prototype was designated the Junak-2bis, but finally entered production in 1951 as the Junak-2. Tadeusz Sołtyk was given a State Award in 1952 for the design. From 1951 to 1954, 105 Junak 2s were produced in the WSK-Okęcie in Warsaw (the first 3 in the WSK-Mielec).

Tadeusz Sołtyk, then working in the Aviation Institute (&quot;Instytut Lotnictwa&quot; - IL) in Warsaw, proposed a Junak development with a bubble canopy, retractable landing gear and other improvements, designated the TS-7 Chwat, but it was not ordered by the authorities and remained on the drawing board. Instead, when the Polish Air Force was equipped with its first jet fighters, (the Yak-23 and MiG-15), there appeared to be a need for a trainer with a tricycle landing gear. Sołtyk designed a modified Junak with a fixed tricycle landing gear and other minor improvements. This plane entered production as the TS-9 Junak 3 (&quot;TS&quot; standing for the designer&#x27;s initials), after having first flown on August 7, 1953. The new plane was heavier, its maximum speed dropped from 223 km/h (139 mph) to 205 km/h (128 mph). Between 1953 and 1956, 146 Junak 3s were produced in WSK Warszawa-Okęcie.

Along with the Junak 1, the LWD developed a civilian trainer and aerobatics variant, the LWD Zuch. Only 5 Zuch 2s were built in 1950, powered by a 116 hp Bramo Sh 14 radial engine.

The Junak was the first aircraft mass-produced in Poland after World War II, the Polish aviation industry having been annihilated. Despite not being particularly modern, it was a stable and easy-to-handle aircraft, with an uncomfortable cockpit being one of its few flaws. On the other hand, it was considered a difficult aircraft to learn to fly, because a student in a rear cockpit had worse view. All models of Junak are generally referred to as LWD Junak or WSK Junak, while the designation TS-9 is not commonly used. The designation IL Junak 3 sometimes appears in books.

==Design==
The aircraft was of mixed construction (steel and wood) and conventional in layout. The fuselage consisted of a steel frame, covered with canvas, in front with metal sheet. It had two-spar wings of wooden construction and a trapezoidal shape; they were covered with canvas and plywood and were fitted with split flaps. It had a two-seat cabin (front: instructor, rear: student) with a common closed canopy (front section opening to the right, rear section sliding). Landing gear was conventional (Junak 2) or tricycle (Junak 3) and fixed. A 5-cylinder M-11FR radial engine gave 119 kW (160 hp) of maximum power and 104 kW (140 hp) normal power. The cylinders have individual cowls, which were often removed. The aircraft was fitted with a two-blade fixed pitch wooden propeller. It carried 80 liters (Junak 2) or 100 liters (Junak 3) of fuel. The plane had no armament. The Junak 3 was fitted with a radio.

==Operational history==

Junak 2s were used in the Polish Air Force as a basic trainer from 1952. When their replacement, with Junak 3s, started in 1954–55, the Junak 2s were withdrawn from the Air Force and handed over to civilian flying clubs.

Junak 3s were used in Polish military aviation from 1954 until 1961, when they were finally replaced with the TS-8 Bies. Starting from 1956, they were handed over to flying clubs as well.

In civilian aviation, 71 Junak 2s and 93 Junak 3s were distributed among aero clubs, who suffered a shortage of suitable aircraft after the war. They were used for pilot training and glider towing throughout the 1960s. The last Junak 2s and Junak 3s were retired in 1972.

In 1963 a group of 12 African pilot trainees from Algeria, Togo and Angola were taught to fly at Krosno, Poland, and they flew Junak 3.

<text>Berkley Books is an American imprint founded in 1955 by Charles Byrne and Frederic Klein owned by the Penguin Group unit of Penguin Random House.

==History==

Berkley Books began as an independent company in 1955. It was founded as &quot;Chic News Company&quot; by Charles Byrne and Frederick Klein, who had worked for Avon; they quickly renamed it Berkley Publishing Co. The new name was a coinage, combining elements of their surnames, unrelated to either the philosopher George Berkeley or Berkeley, California. Under their editor-in-chief Thomas Dardis, over the next few years Berkley developed a diverse line of popular fiction and non-fiction, both reprints and mass-market paperback originals, with a particularly strong history in science fiction (books of Robert A. Heinlein and Frank Herbert’s &quot;Dune&quot; novels, for example). The company was bought in 1965 by G. P. Putnam&#x27;s Sons and in years to follow undertook a hardcover line under the Berkley imprint, chiefly but not only for science fiction. For example, Merle Miller’s &quot;Plain Speaking: An Oral Biography of Harry S. Truman&quot; (1973), and &quot;The Search for J.F.K.&quot; by Joan and Clay Blair Jr. (1976) were substantial nonfiction books under that imprint. When Putnam bought Grosset &amp; Dunlap and Playboy Press, the Jove, Ace and Playboy Press paperback lists were added to that of Berkley; the Playboy list was eventually absorbed into Berkley, while the Jove and Ace lists have continued as distinct imprints.

Following its publication (1985) of the paperback reprint edition of Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot;, Berkley Books became increasingly interested in publishing military combat fiction and technothrillers; its publicity campaigns at military bases contributed to the success of its reprint edition of Dale Brown&#x27;s &quot;Flight of the Old Dog&quot;.[2] The Penguin Group purchased Putnam in 1996. When Penguin merged with Random House in 2013 to form Penguin Random House, Berkley was integrated with the larger paperback line New American Library; the Berkley name was retained for that whole program, which is part of PRH&#x27;s Penguin Adult group, and publishes in mass-market paperback, trade paperback, and hardcover formats.

In December 2008, Berkley cancelled the publication of the Herman Rosenblat Holocaust memoir titled &quot;Angel at the Fence&quot; when it was discovered that the book&#x27;s central events were untrue. In 2011, Berkley Books launched its ebook imprint InterMix. In September 2012, Berkley Books announced that a trilogy of erotic romance novels by Maya Banks had been acquired for publishing. Her trilogy was described as similar to the &quot;Fifty Shades&quot; trilogy, featuring three billionaires.

In 2015, the sister paperback group New American Library was merged into Berkley. In April 2015, Berkley Books signed the self-published author Jasinda Wilder. In January 2016, Berkley was merged into Penguin&#x27;s Putnam/Dutton. Ivan Held replaced Leslie Gelbman as president of Berkley Books. In 2020, Berkley Books announced two new horror books by Grady Hendrix.

<text>Jacob Cox (November 9, 1810 – January 2, 1892) was an American landscape and portrait painter in Indianapolis, Indiana. Several of his paintings are in the Morris-Butler House. He is also known for his paintings of Indiana Governors James B. Ray, Noah Noble, David Wallace, Samuel Bigger, Joseph A. Wright, and Henry S. Lane. In 1941 a retrospective exhibition of his works was held at the John Herron Art Museum.

==Information==
Cox was born in Philadelphia and arrived in Indianapolis in 1833 and established a stove, tinware and coppersmith business. One of his first artistic opportunities came when he painted a banner for the presidential campaign of William Henry Harrison in 1840. After that, he began to paint portraits and in 1842 went to Cincinnati to open a studio with John Dunn, a former treasurer of the State of Indiana. After five months, he returned to his business in Indianapolis and continued painting as a sideline, exhibiting annually at the shows of the Cincinnati Art Union. By 1860, he was devoted to art full-time and became well known in Indianapolis for his portraits and landscapes.

Cox was also a teacher with numerous students including William Merritt Chase.

==Public collections==
Paintings by Cox can be found in a number of public collections including:

* Indianapolis Museum of Art
* Morris-Butler House
* Indiana Landmarks
* Indiana State Museum
* Benjamin Harrison Home

<doc id="927236" wikidata="Q5166386" url="?curid=927236" title="Convergence of Fourier series">
<text>In mathematics, the question of whether the Fourier series of a given periodic function converges to the given function is researched by a field known as classical harmonic analysis, a branch of pure mathematics. Convergence is not necessarily given in the general case, and certain criteria must be met for convergence to occur.

Determination of convergence requires the comprehension of pointwise convergence, uniform convergence, absolute convergence, &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; spaces, summability methods and the Cesàro mean.

==Preliminaries==

Consider &quot;f&quot; an integrable function on the interval . For such an &quot;f&quot; the Fourier coefficients formula_1 are defined by the formula

:formula_2

It is common to describe the connection between &quot;f&quot; and its Fourier series by

:formula_3

The notation ~ here means that the sum represents the function in some sense. To investigate this more carefully, the partial sums must be defined:

:formula_4

The question of whether a Fourier series converges is: Do the functions formula_5 (which are functions of the variable &quot;t&quot; we omitted in the notation) converge to &quot;f&quot; and in which sense? Are there conditions on &quot;f&quot; ensuring this or that type of convergence?

Before continuing, the Dirichlet kernel must be introduced. Taking the formula for formula_1, inserting it into the formula for formula_7 and doing some algebra gives that

:formula_8

where ∗ stands for the periodic convolution and formula_9 is the Dirichlet kernel, which has an explicit formula,

:formula_10

The Dirichlet kernel is &quot;not&quot; a positive kernel, and in fact, its norm diverges, namely

:formula_11

a fact that plays a crucial role in the discussion. The norm of &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot; in &quot;L&quot;1(T) coincides with the norm of the convolution operator with &quot;D&quot;&quot;n&quot;,
acting on the space &quot;C&quot;(T) of periodic continuous functions, or with the norm of the linear functional &quot;f&quot; → (&quot;S&quot;&quot;n&quot;&quot;f&quot;)(0) on &quot;C&quot;(T). Hence, this family of linear functionals on &quot;C&quot;(T) is unbounded, when &quot;n&quot; → ∞.

==Magnitude of Fourier coefficients==
In applications, it is often useful to know the size of the Fourier coefficient.

If formula_12 is an absolutely continuous function,
:formula_13
for formula_14 a constant that only depends on formula_12.

If formula_12 is a bounded variation function,
:formula_17
In particular, this applies to absolutely continuous functions, where
formula_18.

If formula_19
:formula_20

If formula_19 and formula_22 has modulus of continuityformula_23,
:formula_24

and therefore, if formula_12 is in the α-Hölder class
:formula_26

==Pointwise convergence==
{{see also|Dirichlet conditions|Dini test}}

There are many known sufficient conditions for the Fourier series of a function to converge at a given point &quot;x&quot;, for example if the function is differentiable at &quot;x&quot;. Even a jump discontinuity does not pose a problem: if the function has left and right derivatives at &quot;x&quot;, then the Fourier series converges to the average of the left and right limits (but see Gibbs phenomenon).

The Dirichlet–Dini Criterion states that: if &quot;ƒ&quot; is 2{{pi}}–periodic, locally integrable and satisfies

:formula_27

then (S&quot;n&quot;&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;0) converges to ℓ. This implies that for any function &quot;f&quot; of any Hölder class &quot;α&quot; &gt; 0, the Fourier series converges everywhere to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;).

It is also known that for any periodic function of bounded variation, the Fourier series converges. In general, the most common criteria for pointwise convergence of a periodic function &quot;f&quot; are as follows:

* If &quot;f&quot; satisfies a Holder condition, then its Fourier series converges uniformly.
* If &quot;f&quot; is of bounded variation, then its Fourier series converges everywhere. If &quot;f&quot; is additionally continuous, the convergence is uniform.
* If &quot;f&quot; is continuous and its Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges uniformly.

There exist continuous functions whose Fourier series converges pointwise but not uniformly.

However, the Fourier series of a continuous function need not converge pointwise. Perhaps the easiest proof uses the non-boundedness of Dirichlet&#x27;s kernel in &quot;L&quot;1(T) and the Banach–Steinhaus uniform boundedness principle. As typical for existence arguments invoking the Baire category theorem, this proof is nonconstructive. It shows that the family of continuous functions whose Fourier series converges at a given &quot;x&quot; is of first Baire category, in the Banach space of continuous functions on the circle. 

So in some sense pointwise convergence is &quot;atypical&quot;, and for most continuous functions the Fourier series does not converge at a given point. However Carleson&#x27;s theorem shows that for a given continuous function the Fourier series converges almost everywhere.

It is also possible to give explicit examples of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at 0: for instance, the even and 2π-periodic function &quot;f&quot; defined for all &quot;x&quot; in [0,π] by

:formula_28

In this example it is easy to show how the series behaves at zero. Because the function is even the Fourier series contains only cosines:

:formula_29

The coefficients are:

:formula_30

As {{mvar|m}} increases, the coefficients will be positive and increasing until they reach a value of about formula_31 at formula_32 for some {{mvar|n}} and then become negative (starting with a value around formula_33) and getting smaller, before starting a new such wave. At formula_34 the Fourier series is simply the running sum of formula_35 and this builds up to around

:formula_36

in the {{mvar|n}}th wave before returning to around zero, showing that the series does not converge at zero but reaches higher and higher peaks.

==Uniform convergence==
Suppose formula_19, and formula_22 has modulus of continuity formula_39; then the partial sums of the Fourier series converge to the function with speed

:formula_40
for a constant formula_14 that does not depend upon formula_42, nor formula_43, nor formula_44.

This theorem, first proved by D Jackson, tells, for example, that if formula_12 satisfies the formula_46-Hölder condition, then

:formula_47

If formula_12 is formula_49 periodic, continuous and of bounded variation,
then the Fourier series of formula_12 converges uniformly,
but not necessarily absolutely, to formula_12.

==Absolute convergence==

A function &quot;ƒ&quot; has an absolutely converging Fourier series if

:formula_52

If this condition holds then formula_53 converges absolutely for every formula_54. Conversely, for this condition to hold, it suffices that formula_53 converges absolutely for some formula_54. In other words, for absolute convergence there is no issue of &quot;where&quot; the sum converges absolutely — if it converges absolutely at one point then it does so everywhere.

The family of all functions with absolutely converging Fourier series is a type of Banach algebra called the Wiener algebra, after Norbert Wiener, who proved that if &quot;ƒ&quot; has absolutely converging Fourier
series and is never zero, then 1/&quot;ƒ&quot; has absolutely converging Fourier series. A simplification of the original proof of Wiener&#x27;s theorem was given by Israel Gelfand and later by Donald J. Newman in 1975.

Sergei Bernstein&#x27;s theorem states that, if formula_12 belongs to a α-Hölder class for α &gt; 1/2 then{{citation needed|reason=The Teschl reference insufficiently covers the statement. The Krein algebra, for example, isn&#x27;t discussed at all.|date=December 2024}}

:formula_58

for formula_59 the constant in the
Hölder condition, formula_60 a constant only dependent on formula_46; formula_62 is the norm of the Krein algebra. Notice that the 1/2 here is essential—there is an example of a 1/2-Hölder functions due to Hardy and Littlewood, which do not belong to the Wiener algebra. Besides, this theorem cannot improve the best known bound on the size of the Fourier coefficient of a α-Hölder function—that is only formula_63 and then not summable.

Zygmund&#x27;s theorem states that, if &quot;ƒ&quot; is of bounded variation &quot;and&quot; belongs to a α-Hölder class for some α &gt; 0, it belongs to the Wiener algebra.

==Norm convergence==

According to the Riesz–Fischer theorem, if &quot;ƒ&quot; is square-integrable then formula_64 converges to &quot;ƒ&quot; in the {{math|&quot;L&quot;2}}-norm, that is 
formula_65
The converse is also true: if the limit above is zero, then formula_12 must be in formula_67.

More generally, for formula_68, convergence in the {{math|&quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot;}}-norm holds if formula_69. The original proof uses properties of holomorphic functions and Hardy spaces, and another proof, due to Salomon Bochner relies upon the Riesz–Thorin interpolation theorem. For &quot;p&quot; = 1 and infinity, the result is not true. The construction of an example of divergence in &quot;L&quot;1 was first done by Andrey Kolmogorov (see below). For infinity, the result is a corollary of the uniform boundedness principle.

If the partial sum &quot;SN&quot; is replaced by a suitable summability kernel (for example the &quot;Fejér sum&quot; obtained by convolution with the Fejér kernel), basic functional analytic techniques can be applied to show that norm convergence holds for 1 ≤ &quot;p&quot; &lt; ∞.

==Convergence almost everywhere==

The problem whether the Fourier series of any continuous function converges almost everywhere was posed by Nikolai Lusin in the 1920s.
It was resolved positively in 1966 by Lennart Carleson. His result, now known as Carleson&#x27;s theorem, tells the Fourier expansion of any function in &quot;L&quot;2 converges almost everywhere. Later on, Richard Hunt generalized this to &quot;L&quot;&quot;p&quot; for any &quot;p&quot; &gt; 1.

Contrariwise, Andrey Kolmogorov, in his first scientific work, constructed an example of a function in &quot;L&quot;1 whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere (later improved to diverge everywhere).

Jean-Pierre Kahane and Yitzhak Katznelson proved that for any given set &quot;E&quot; of measure zero, there exists a continuous function &quot;ƒ&quot; such that the Fourier series of &quot;ƒ&quot; fails to converge on any point
of &quot;E&quot;.

==Summability==

Does the sequence 0,1,0,1,0,1... (the partial sums of Grandi&#x27;s series) converge to {{sfrac|1|2}}? This does not seem like a very unreasonable generalization of the notion of convergence. Hence we say that any sequence formula_70 is Cesàro summable to some &quot;a&quot; if

:formula_71

Where with formula_72 we denote the {{mvar|k}}th partial sum: 

:formula_73

It is not difficult to see that if a sequence converges to some &quot;a&quot; then it is also Cesàro summable to it.

To discuss summability of Fourier series, we must replace formula_7 with an appropriate notion. Hence we define

:formula_75

and ask: does formula_76 converge to &quot;f&quot;? formula_77 is no longer
associated with Dirichlet&#x27;s kernel, but with Fejér&#x27;s kernel, namely

:formula_78

where formula_79 is Fejér&#x27;s kernel,

:formula_80

The main difference is that Fejér&#x27;s kernel is a positive kernel. Fejér&#x27;s theorem states that the above sequence of partial sums converge uniformly to &quot;ƒ&quot;. This implies much better convergence properties

* If &quot;ƒ&quot; is continuous at &quot;t&quot; then the Fourier series of &quot;ƒ&quot; is summable at &quot;t&quot; to &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). If &quot;ƒ&quot; is continuous, its Fourier series is uniformly summable (i.e. formula_76 converges uniformly to &quot;ƒ&quot;).
* For any integrable &quot;ƒ&quot;, formula_76 converges to &quot;ƒ&quot; in the formula_83 norm.
* There is no Gibbs phenomenon.

Results about summability can also imply results about regular convergence. For example, we learn that if &quot;ƒ&quot; is continuous at &quot;t&quot;, then the Fourier series of &quot;ƒ&quot; cannot converge to a value different from &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). It may either converge to &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) or diverge. This is because, if formula_84 converges to some value &quot;x&quot;, it is also summable to it, so from the first summability property above, &quot;x&quot; = &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;t&quot;).

==Order of growth==

The order of growth of Dirichlet&#x27;s kernel is logarithmic, i.e.

:formula_85

See Big O notation for the notation &quot;O&quot;(1). The actual value formula_86 is both difficult to calculate (see Zygmund 8.3) and of almost no use. The fact that for &quot;some&quot; constant &quot;c&quot; we have

:formula_87

is quite clear when one examines the graph of Dirichlet&#x27;s kernel. The integral over the &quot;n&quot;-th peak is bigger than &quot;c&quot;/&quot;n&quot; and therefore the estimate for the harmonic sum gives the logarithmic estimate.

This estimate entails quantitative versions of some of the previous results. For any continuous function &quot;f&quot; and any &quot;t&quot; one has

:formula_88

However, for any order of growth ω(&quot;n&quot;) smaller than log, this no longer holds and it is possible to find a continuous function &quot;f&quot; such that for some &quot;t&quot;,

:formula_89

The equivalent problem for divergence everywhere is open. Sergei Konyagin managed to construct an integrable function such that for &quot;every t&quot; one has

:formula_90

It is not known whether this example is best possible. The only bound from the other direction known is log &quot;n&quot;.

==Multiple dimensions==

Upon examining the equivalent problem in more than one dimension, it is necessary to specify the precise order of summation one uses. For example, in two dimensions, one may define

:formula_91

which are known as &quot;square partial sums&quot;. Replacing the sum above with

:formula_92

lead to &quot;circular partial sums&quot;. The difference between these two definitions is quite notable. For example, the norm of the corresponding Dirichlet kernel for square partial sums is of the order of formula_93 while for circular partial sums it is of the order of formula_94.

Many of the results true for one dimension are wrong or unknown in multiple dimensions. In particular, the equivalent of Carleson&#x27;s theorem is still open for circular partial sums. Almost everywhere convergence of &quot;square partial sums&quot; (as well as more general polygonal partial sums) in multiple dimensions was established around 1970 by Charles Fefferman.

<text>Dan Lin (; born April 8, 1973) is a Taiwanese-American film and television producer. He is the chairman of Netflix Films and the founder of Rideback (formerly Lin Pictures until 2018), a film and television production company that he formed in 2008. Lin produced Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, &quot;The Lego Ninjago Movie&quot;, &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot;, and the horror film &quot;It&quot;, which holds the record for highest-grossing horror film. Lin also produced Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot;, a live action adaptation of the 1992 animated feature.

==Early life and education==
Dan Lin was born in Taipei, Taiwan, the son of an executive in the international food industry. He moved to the United States at the age of five.

In 1994, Lin graduated with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. He then earned a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in 1999 from Harvard Business School.

==Career==
Between his first and second year at Harvard Business School, Lin undertook a summer internship program with Lorenzo di Bonaventura, who was then an executive with Warner Bros. Pictures. In 1999, a day after Lin&#x27;s graduation, the studio executive offered Lin a junior position at Warners. Lin worked his way up to Senior Vice President of Production and left in 2007 to form his own company. During his eight years at Warners, Lin oversaw the development and production of the Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Departed&quot;, directed by Martin Scorsese. Other films Lin oversaw include &quot;10,000 BC&quot;, directed by Roland Emmerich; &quot;The Aviator&quot;, directed by Scorsese; &quot;Alexander&quot;, directed by Oliver Stone; &quot;TMNT&quot;; &quot;The Invasion&quot;; &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot;; &quot;Matchstick Men&quot;; &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot;; and &quot;Torque&quot;.

In January 2008 he formed Lin Pictures, based at Warner Bros. He described the transition from development executive to producer as natural: &quot;It&#x27;s a symbiotic relationship between the studio and the producers, we all work together towards the same goal – make the best movie possible.&quot;

Lin currently serves on the board of directors for Rideback Rise, Hawai’i International Film Festival and the Good Shepherd Center for Homeless Women and Children. He also serves on the Board of the Producers Guild of America Foundation. In September 2008, Lin was honored as one of Variety&#x27;s &quot;10 Producers to Watch.&quot; In April 2015, Lin was named to &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;″s list of &#x27;The 30 Most Powerful Film Producers in Hollywood&#x27;

In August 2022, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that he was in talks to take over DC Films. In September 2022, he ended negotiations and parted ways with Warner Bros. Discovery. On February 28, 2024, it was announced that Lin would replace Scott Stuber as Netflix&#x27;s head of film, reporting to Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria.

<text>== Lichfield Cricket Club ==
Lichfield Cricket Club&#x27;s first team play cricket and currently play in the Staffordshire Club Cricket Championship, - Premier Division 2015. The club has the nickname &#x27;Three Spires&#x27;, derived from the three nearby spires of Lichfield Cathedral. They have 4 senior men&#x27;s teams, junior teams at every age group level, from Under 9s to under 17s.

The club has a flourishing junior section and plays at its home ground Collins Hill, Eastern Road in Lichfield. The club is affiliated to the Burton &amp; District Cricket League, Birmingham &amp; District Premier Cricket League and the Staffordshire Cricket Board. The club has enjoyed great success in the last three years especially in the Sunday League.

== The Chauntry Cup ==
Lichfield Cricket Club hosts The Chauntry Cup, a contest for both amateur and professional cricketers, which has been running since 1936. Australian test cricketer Keith Miller, considered to be one of the best Australian all rounders, played for RAF in 1943. After playing an &quot;unofficial&quot; war time Test match at Lord&#x27;s, he raced back to Lichfield and played in the finals the next day. The bowler Ray Lindwall played for the OTU (Officers Training Unit).

The Chauntry Cup claims to be the world&#x27;s oldest, annually contested T20 cricket competition still running. On 5 May 2015, Sky Sports 2 recorded a piece which was aired 14 May 2015, about the Chauntry Cup. The recording was filmed at Lichfield CC.

<doc id="927264" wikidata="Q2495346" url="?curid=927264" title="Monorchism">
<text>Monorchism (also monorchidism) is the state of having only one testicle within the scrotum.

==Terminology==
An individual having monorchism can be referred to as &quot;monorchid&quot;.

==Causes==
This can be due to:
* One testicle not descending into the scrotum during normal embryonic or fetal development (3–4% of &#x27;normal&#x27; live births), also known as undescended testis or cryptorchidism. In this case the testis is within the abdominal cavity, somewhere along the normal route of descent – most commonly, within the inguinal canal. Such a testis has an increased risk of malignancy.
* One testicle may disappear during development (the so-called vanishing testis) due to some intrauterine insult. This is thought to be most likely vascular, such as testicular torsion.
* One testicle may have been surgically removed through orchiectomy.
* One testicle may be injured.

==Notable cases==
===Due to testicular cancer===
*Lance Armstrong, American bicyclist.
*Frank Church, former U.S. Senator and Presidential candidate.
*Tom Green, Canadian comedian-actor.
*Richard Herring, English comedian and writer
*John Kruk, former baseball player
*Mark Latham, former Australian politician.
*Geoff Horsfield, English footballer.
*Nenê, Brazilian basketball player.
*Kevin Curtis, American football player.
*Nigel Farage, former leader of the UK Independence Party.
*Bobby Moore, English footballer and World Cup winner.
* Jimmy White, English snooker player.
*Darren Kendall, former master of the noseflute.

===Due to injury===
* Archibald Douglas, 4th Earl of Douglas, magnate of the Kingdom of Scotland, and Peer of France. Lost in 1403, while fighting at the Battle of Shrewsbury (The previous year he had lost an eye at the Battle of Homildon Hill).
* Troy Bayliss, world superbike champion in 2001, 2006 and 2008. In 2007 he lost a testicle during a race at Donington Park.
* Brian Foster, American mixed martial artist.
* John Starks, American basketball player.
* Paul Wood, English rugby league player who sustained a ruptured testicle during a match and subsequently had it removed.
* Thurgood Marshall, United States Supreme Court Justice who injured a testicle during a fraternity event in university.
*Dave England, who lost one of his testicles after suffering a double hernia during a snowboard accident in New Zealand in 1997.

===Due to cryptorchidism===
* Mao Zedong, founder of the People&#x27;s Republic of China.
* Dara Ó Briain, Irish comedian related that he has a single testicle in a standup routine.

===Unknown===
* Possible monorchism of Adolf Hitler
* Francisco Franco, Dictator of Spain.

==Monorchism in nonhuman animals==
Although extremely rare, monorchism has been observed to be characteristic of some animal species, notably in beetles.

==See also==
* Anorchia
* Cryptorchidism
* Polyorchidism

<doc id="927267" wikidata="Q476209" url="?curid=927267" title="Dengue virus">
<text>Dengue virus (DENV) is the cause of dengue fever. It is a mosquito-borne, single positive-stranded RNA virus of the family &quot;Flaviviridae&quot;; genus &quot;Flavivirus&quot;. Four serotypes of the virus have been found, and a reported fifth has yet to be confirmed, all of which can cause the full spectrum of disease. Nevertheless, the mainstream scientific community&#x27;s understanding of dengue virus may be simplistic as, rather than distinct antigenic groups, a &quot;continuum&quot; appears to exist. This same study identified 47 strains of &quot;dengue virus&quot;. Additionally, coinfection with and lack of rapid tests for &quot;Zika virus&quot; and &quot;chikungunya&quot; complicate matters in real-world infections.

&quot;Dengue virus&quot; has increased dramatically within the last 20 years, becoming one of the worst mosquito-borne human pathogens that tropical countries have to deal with. 2013 estimates indicate that as many as 390 million infections occur each year, and many dengue infections are increasingly understood to be asymptomatic or subclinical.

==Evolution==
Based on the analysis of the envelope protein, at least three genotypes (1 to 3) are known. In 2013, a fourth serotype was reported. A single report of a fifth serotype DEN-5 in 2015 has not been replicated or further reported on. The rate of nucleotide substitution for this virus has been estimated to be 6.5 per nucleotide per year, a rate similar to other RNA viruses. The American African genotype has been estimated to have evolved between 1907 and 1949. This period includes World War I and World War II, which were associated with considerable movement of populations and environmental disturbance, factors known to promote the evolution of new vector-borne viral species.

A Bayesian analysis of all four serotypes estimated that their most recent common ancestor existed about 340 AD (95% confidence interval: 280 BC–850 AD).

==Lifecycle==

Until a few hundred years ago, &quot;dengue virus&quot; was transmitted in sylvatic cycles in Africa, Southeast Asia and South Asia between mosquitoes of the genus &quot;Aedes&quot; and nonhuman primates, with rare emergences into human populations. The global spread of &quot;dengue virus&quot;, however, has followed its emergence from sylvatic cycles and the primary lifecycle now exclusively involves transmission between humans and &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes. Vertical transmission from mosquito to mosquito has also been observed in some vector species. Dogs have been found to be infected by the virus, but more research is needed to determine if dogs or other animals can serve as reservoirs or are just incidental hosts.

After the mosquito takes up infected blood from a human, the virus infects the mosquito&#x27;s gut and other tissues. The infected mosquito then seeks blood, biting a different human. At this moment, the human&#x27;s skin cells get (keratinocytes) infected first. Subsequently, dendritic cells (DC) take up the virus and get infected too. The DC&#x27;s mobility disperses virus in the body where some other cell types can get infected, as well (macrophages, hepatocytes and Bone Marrow cells).

Dengue virus lifecycle in cells, both in arthropod and mammalian cells, is typical for single-stranded (+)-RNA viruses. After binding to specific receptors on the cell the virion gets endocytosed. Endosomes usually get acidified and become lysosomes which digest their content. But the acidic condition triggers a conformational change in the envelope of the virion, making its membrane fuse with the endosome membrane, releasing the viral capsid with the viral RNA genome into the cell&#x27;s cytosol.

Viral RNA is capped and, so, cannot be distinguished from human mRNA. It gets translated by the cell&#x27;s ribosomes into a polyprotein with 3,391 amino acids. This polyprotein cleaves itself to produce, after several steps, three structural (C, E, prM) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). All non-structural proteins are necessary to together create the viral replication complex (RC) which makes copies of capped viral RNA to produce more polyprotein and new virions. New virions move to exocytic vesicles via the secretory pathway and, there, get their mature form before they are released from the cell. One infected cell may release up to between 1,000 and 10,000 new virions.

Recent findings suggest that as the virus infects human cells, host homeostatic processes such as autophagy and ER stress response, not to mention apoptosis, are triggered depending on the infected cell type. The activation of autophagy and ER stress during infection enhances virus reproduction. Attempts to provide detailed summaries of the life cycle of dengue at the cellular level are published in review articles from different research groups.

==Genome==
The DENV genome is about 11000 bases of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) that codes for three structural proteins (capsid protein C, membrane protein M, envelope protein E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, NS5). It also includes short noncoding regions on both the 5&#x27; and 3&#x27; ends.

==Structural and enzymatic proteins==
===E protein===
The DENV E (envelope) protein, found as a dimer on the surface of the mature viral particle, is important in the initial attachment of this particle to the host cell. Each E protein monomer comprises three ectodomains, ED1 to ED3, and a transmembrane segment. ED2 includes the dimerization interface, two glycosylation sites, and the peptide of fusion with the cellular membrane. ED3 is a continuous polypeptide segment; its fold is compact and immunoglobulin-like. &quot;Dengue virus&quot; is transmitted by species of the mosquito genus &quot;Aedes&quot;. Several molecules that interact with the viral E protein (ICAM3-grabbing nonintegrin, CD209, Rab 5, GRP 78, and the mannose receptor) have been shown to be important factors mediating attachment and viral entry. The membrane form of ribosomal protein SA may also be involved in the attachment. E protein is known to contain physicochemically conserved B cells and T cells specific epitopes, which can be exploited to design vaccine. Recombinant domains of the E protein are used as well-defined antigens in the serological detection of antibodies directed against &quot;dengue virus&quot; and as immunogens in vaccine candidates.

===prM/M protein===
The DENV prM (membrane) protein, which is important in the formation and maturation of the viral particle, consists of seven antiparallel β-strands stabilized by three disulfide bonds.

The glycoprotein shell of the mature DENV virion consists of 180 copies each of the E and M proteins. The immature virion starts out with the E and prM proteins forming 90 heterodimers that give a spiky exterior to the viral particle. This immature viral particle buds into the endoplasmic reticulum and eventually travels via the secretory pathway to the Golgi apparatus. As the virion passes through the trans-Golgi network, it is exposed to low pH. This acidic environment causes a conformational change in the E protein, which disassociates it from the prM protein and causes it to form E homodimers, which lie flat against the viral surface, giving the maturing virion a smooth appearance. During this maturation, pr peptide is cleaved from the M peptide by the host protease, furin. The M protein then acts as a transmembrane protein under the E-protein shell of the mature virion. The pr peptide stays associated with the E protein until the viral particle is released into the extracellular environment. This pr peptide acts like a cap, covering the hydrophobic fusion loop of the E protein until the viral particle has exited the cell.

===NS3 protein===
The DENV NS3 is a serine protease, as well as an RNA helicase and RTPase/NTPase. The protease domain consists of six β-strands arranged into two β-barrels formed by residues 1–180 of the protein. The catalytic triad (His-51, Asp-75 and Ser-135) is found between these two β-barrels, and activity is dependent on the presence of a 43 amino acid segment of the NS2B cofactor. This cofactor wraps around the NS3 protease domain and becomes part of the active site. The remaining NS2B residues before and after the cofactor region contain helical domains involved in membrane binding. The remaining NS3 residues (180–618) form the three subdomains of the DENV helicase. A six-stranded parallel β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices makes up subdomains I and II, and subdomain III is composed of four α-helices surrounded by three shorter α-helices and two antiparallel β-strands.

===NS4A protein===
DENV NS4A is a nonstructural protein involved in altering cell membrane curvature and induction of autophagy. In addition to its membrane altering property, NS4A is a scaffold for the virus replication complex and undergoes oligomerization. Mutations of NS4A that affect interaction with NS4B abolished or severely reduced virus replication indicating the importance of NS4A and its interaction with NS4B in dengue reproduction.

===NS5 protein===
The DENV NS5 protein is a 900-residue peptide with a methyltransferase domain at its N-terminal end (residues 1–296) and a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) at its C-terminal end (residues 320–900). The methyltransferase domain consists of an α/β/β sandwich flanked by N-and C-terminal subdomains. The DENV RdRp is similar to other RdRps containing palm, finger, and thumb subdomains and a GDD motif for incorporating nucleotides.

===Complexes between the E protein and neutralizing antibodies===
Crystal structures of complexes between antibodies and either the ectodomain (sE) of the viral E protein or its domain 3 (ED3) have helped understand the molecular bases of the virus recognition and neutralization. Some of the epitopes are partially or totally inaccessible in the known structure of the mature virion. The corresponding antibodies are, therefore, assumed to bind to alternate or transitional conformations of the virus at 37 °C.
* The murine antibody E111 neutralizes DENV1. Its Fab and scFv fragments were crystallized in complex with the ED3 domain of DENV1. Its epitope is located around β-strands C and C&#x27; of ED3, and the intervening loop.
* The murine antibody 1A1D-2 strongly neutralizes DENV1, DENV2, and DENV3. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domain of DENV2. Its epitope straddles β-strands A and G of ED3.
* The murine antibody 2H12 cross-reacts with all four DENV serotypes. It neutralizes the corresponding viruses, except DENV2. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domains of DENV1, DENV3 and DENV4. Its epitope is located around the conserved AB loop of ED3.
* The murine antibody 4E11 neutralizes all four DENV serotypes with varying efficacies. Its scFv fragment was crystallized in complex with the ED3 domains of the four DENV serotypes. Its epitope straddles β-strands A and G of ED3 as does the epitope of 1A1D-2. The structures at 2.0 Å resolution have enabled one to analyze the roles of water molecules within the protein interfaces and the roles of somatic hypermutations outside of these interfaces in the interactions and cross-recognitions.
* The chimpanzee antibody 5H2 potently neutralizes DENV4. Its Fab fragment was crystallized in complex with the sE protein of DENV4. Its epitope is included in domain 1 (ED1) of the E protein.
* The human antibodies Ede1-C10, Ede2-A11, and Ede2-B7 potently neutralize all four DENV serotypes. Their Fab or scFv fragments were crystallized in complex with the sE protein of DENV2. The recognition determinants of these antibodies are at a serotype-invariant site in the E dimer interface and include the exposed side chains of the E fusion loop and the two conserved glycan side-chains.

==Disease==

Common names for dengue fever include breakbone fever, vomiting, and dandy fever; dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome are the severe forms. Dengue is found in tropical and subtropical climates worldwide, mostly in urban and semi-urban areas. People of all ages who are exposed to infected mosquitoes are at risk of developing dengue fever. The disease occurs most often during the rainy season in tropical countries in Southeast Asia, South Asia, and South America, with high numbers of infected mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, though humans are not capable of transmitting the disease and are not contagious. The incubation period is 3 to 14 days, while the period of the illness is 3–7 days. Signs and symptoms may include severe headache; retro-orbital pain; muscle, joint, and bone pain; macular or maculopapular rash; and minor hemorrhagic manifestations, including petechiae, ecchymosis, purpura, epistaxis, bleeding gums, hematuria, or a positive tourniquet test result. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis showed that allergic symptoms are one of the core symptoms that are highly associated with dengue severity.

== Mechanism of infection ==
# &quot;Dengue virus&quot;&#x27; (DENV) E envelope protein binds to a cellular receptor. The exact nature of the cellular receptor has not been fully elucidated.
# DENV undergoes endocytosis. Acidification of the endosome leads to a conformational change of E, exposing a fusion peptide sequence that facilitates fusion of the envelope with the endosomal membrane, releasing the virion capsid into the cytoplasm.
# Uncoating occurs in the cytoplasm
# Host translational machinery (ribosomes) translates the (+)ssRNA into a single polypeptide
# Cellular and viral proteinases cleave the polypeptide into 10 proteins (E, M, C and 7 nonstructural/enzymatic proteins) while embedded on the ER membrane.
# As soon as functional RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is synthesized, RNA replication can commence. Synthesis is asymmetrical, making 10 times more of the positive-sense strand than the negative.
# Assembly occurs on intracellular membranes, which bud into the ER (forming the envelope from the ER membrane). Subsequent budding from the ER through the Golgi and into vesicles allows maturation via posttranslational modifications, e.g. glycosylation and pH transformational rearrangements
# Egress occurs via exocytosis

===Severe disease===

Some people develop more severe forms of dengue, such as dengue hemorrhagic fever. Different strains of viruses interacting with people with different immune backgrounds lead to a complex interaction. Among the possible causes are cross-serotypic immune response, through a mechanism known as antibody-dependent enhancement, which happens when a person who has been previously infected with dengue gets infected for the second, third, or fourth time. The previous antibodies to the old strain of &quot;dengue virus&quot; now interfere with the immune response to the current strain, paradoxically leading to more virus entry and uptake.

==Immune system interaction==

In recent years, many studies have shown that flaviviruses, especially &quot;dengue virus&quot;, has the ability to inhibit the innate immune response during the infection.
Indeed, &quot;dengue virus&quot; has many nonstructural proteins that allow the inhibition of various mediators of the innate immune system response. These proteins act on two levels :

===Inhibition of interferon signaling by blocking signal transducer===
NS4B is a small, hydrophobic protein located in association with the endoplasmic reticulum. It may block the phosphorylation of STAT 1 after induction by interferons type I alpha &amp; beta. In fact, as the activity of Tyk2 kinase decreases in association with &quot;dengue virus&quot;, so too does STAT 1 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the innate immune system&#x27;s response to the virus is further damped as expression of interferon-stimulating gene(s) (ISG) is restricted by the aforementioned &#x27;NS4B&#x27; protein. NS2A and NS4A cofactor may also take part in the STAT 1 inhibition.

NS5 - the presence of this 105-kDa protein results in inactivation of STAT2 (via the signal transduction of the response to interferon) when it is expressed alone. When NS5 is cleaved with NS4B by a protease (NS2B3), it can degrade STAT2. In fact, after the cleavage of NS5 by the protease, an E3 ligase association with STAT2 occurs, and the E3 ligase targets STAT2 for the degradation.

===Inhibition of the type I interferon response===
NS2B3-b protease complex is a proteolytic core consisting of the last 40 amino acids of NS2B and the first 180 amino acids of NS3.
Cleavage of the NS2B3 precursor activates the protease complex.

This protease complex allows the inhibition of the production of type I interferon by reducing the activity of IFN-beta promoter; NS2B3 protease complex is involved in inhibiting the phosphorylation of IRF3.
The NS2B3 protease complex inhibits (by cleaving) protein MITA which allows the IRF3 activation.

=== Mosquito D7 saliva protein ===
&quot;Dengue virus&quot; is transmitted by the mosquito species &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, which produces saliva that contains over 100 unique proteins, including the protein family D7. Scientists used to believe that &quot;A. aegypti&quot; saliva, when being transmitted, actually enhanced &quot;dengue virus&quot; in the body. The mosquito&#x27;s saliva was thought to make the virus spread faster due to the weakened immune response of its host. However, a current study has found that the protein D7 hinders the virus transmission into the host cells.

The immune responses of antibodies that are trying to fight off the foreign virus actually increase transmission and make the infection worse. Levels of protein D7 are more prevalent in salivary glands of dengue-infected mosquitoes compared to those uninfected ones. D7 is found in mosquito saliva and was thought to assist the process of blood feeding. Despite the prior assumptions, D7 can modulate the host cell and act against the virus to prevent viral infection. Unfortunately, D7 proteins provoke immune responses, which raise anti-D7 antibody levels. These antibodies inhibit the function of D7 proteins, which enhance transmission of &quot;dengue virus&quot;. Although immune responses against D7 proteins might impair their antiviral activity, a study showed that non-DENV subjects have slightly higher anti-D7 IgG levels than infected ones, although it was not statistically significant. Thus, more studies over D7 protein family are needed do elucidate its role on DENV infection and its applicability in medicine.

=== Vaccine research ===
Two types of dengue vaccine have been approved and are commercially available. On 5 December 2022 the European Medicines Agency approved Qdenga, a live tetravalent attenuated vaccine for adults, adolescents and children from four years of age. The 2016 vaccine Dengvaxia is only recommended in individuals who have been previously infected, or in populations with a high rate of prior infection by age nine. Dengvaxia has been approved in 11 countries (Mexico, the Philippines, Indonesia, Brazil, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Paraguay, Guatemala, Peru, Thailand, and Singapore).

Several vaccines are under development by private and public researchers. Developing a vaccine against the disease is challenging. With four different serotypes of the virus that can cause the disease, the vaccine must immunize against all four types to be effective. Vaccination against only one serotype could possibly lead to severe dengue hemorrhagic shock when infected with another serotype due to antibody-dependent enhancement. When infected with &quot;dengue virus&quot;, the immune system produces cross-reactive antibodies that provide immunity to that particular serotype. However, these antibodies are incapable of neutralizing other serotypes upon reinfection and actually increase viral replication. When macrophages consume the &#x27;neutralized&#x27; virus, the virus is able to replicate within the macrophage, causing disease. These cross-reactive, ineffective antibodies ease access of the virus into macrophages, which induces more severe disease (dengue hemorrhagic fever, dengue shock syndrome). A common problem faced in dengue-endemic regions is when mothers become infected with dengue; after giving birth, offspring carry the immunity from their mother and are susceptible to hemorrhagic fever if infected with any of the other three serotypes. One vaccine was in phase III trials in 2012 and planning for vaccine usage and effectiveness surveillance had started.

In 2009, Sanofi-Pasteur started building a new facility in &#x27; , a suburb of Lyon (France). This unit produces four-serotype vaccine for phase III trials. In September 2014, the Sanofi-Pasteur CEO gave early results of the phase III trial efficacy study in Latin America. The efficacy per serotype (ST) varied widely, 42.3% for ST2, 50.3% for ST1, 74.0% for ST3, and 77.7% for ST4. The full analysis of data from the phase III Latin American-Caribbean study will be reviewed by external experts before being published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. Primary results has to be presented at the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene Annual Meeting, held November 2–6, 2014, in New Orleans.

In September 2012, one of the vaccines was reported to not have done well in clinical trials.

In late 2015 and early 2016, the first dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia (CYD-TDV) by Sanofi-Pasteur, was registered in several countries for use in individuals 9–45 years of age living in endemic areas.

On May 1, 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the approval of Dengvaxia, the first vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease caused by all dengue virus serotypes in people ages 9 through 16 who have laboratory-confirmed previous dengue infection and who live in endemic areas. Dengue is endemic in the U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

=== Drug research ===

There are no approved direct antiviral treatments for Dengue fever. Most antiviral drug research for Dengue infections has focussed on inhibition of the NS2B/NS3 protease or NS5 proteins. Reported protease inhibitor approaches have focussed mainly on targeted covalent inhibitors. One drug, Balapiravir, a repurposed hepatitis C NS5 polymerase inhibitor progressed to a Phase II clinical trial before being stopped due to lack of efficacy.

Although there are no approved direct antiviral treatments for dengue fever, most antiviral research has focused on inhibiting the NS2B/NS3 protease or NS5 proteins. Reported protease inhibitor approaches have mainly targeted covalent inhibitors. One drug, Balapiravir, initially repurposed as a hepatitis C NS5 polymerase inhibitor, reached Phase II clinical trials but was stopped due to lack of efficacy.

The journal explores a novel approach by examining the potential of metal-TPI complexes (with iron, cobalt, and zinc) as inhibitors of dengue virus replication. Zn-TPI and Fe-TPI showed low toxicity and significant inhibition of DENV-3, while Co-TPI demonstrated antiviral activity at low concentrations. These findings suggest new possibilities for developing more effective antiviral treatments for dengue.

<text>Messier is a relatively young lunar impact crater located on the Mare Fecunditatis. The crater has a discernible oblong shape that is not caused by foreshortening. The longer dimension is oriented in an east–west direction.

Just to the west lies Messier A, a similar-sized crater with an oblong, doublet form. The longer dimension of this crater is oriented north–south, at right angles to Messier. This crater also has a curved bulge extending to the west. Messier and Messier A were photographed at high resolution by NASA&#x27;s Lunar Orbiter 5 spacecraft In August 1967. The Lunar Orbiter V_041 image is archived at the Lunar and Planetary Institute website. The Lunar Orbiter V partial image shown here is derived from the Lunar Orbiter Image Recovery Project effort to reprocess these images from the original tapes.

The interiors of Messier and Messier A have a higher albedo than the surrounding mare. There is also a dark streak in the center of each crater. Two prominent, nearly linear rays extend westwards from the rim of Messier A, continuing over 100 kilometers towards the west edge of Mare Fecunditatis. The mare surface around the craters is also lightly marked by rays from other craters.

It is theorized that Messier crater was formed by an impact at a very low angle, and that Messier A could have formed following a rebound by the impacting body. The low angle of impact may also explain the asymmetrical ray system.

To the northwest of Messier A is a long, narrow rille, called &quot;Rima Messier&quot;.

This crater is named in honor of the French astronomer Charles Messier (1730–1817).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Messier.

The following crater has been renamed by the IAU.

* Messier G - &quot;See&quot; Lindbergh (crater).

Messier A has been called W. H. Pickering, but this was never officially sanctioned by the IAU. A different crater has since been named for Pickering.

<doc id="927274" wikidata="Q1403502" url="?curid=927274" title="Pentatope number">
<text>In number theory, a pentatope number is a number in the fifth cell of any row of Pascal&#x27;s triangle starting with the 5-term row , either from left to right or from right to left. It is named because it represents the number of 3-dimensional unit spheres which can be packed into a pentatope (a 4-dimensional tetrahedron) of increasing side lengths.

The first few numbers of this kind are:

: 1, 5, 15, 35, 70, 126, 210, 330, 495, 715, 1001, 1365 

Pentatope numbers belong to the class of figurate numbers, which can be represented as regular, discrete geometric patterns.

The formula for the th pentatope number is represented by the 4th rising factorial of divided by the factorial of 4:

:formula_1

The pentatope numbers can also be represented as binomial coefficients:

:formula_2
which is the number of distinct quadruples that can be selected from objects, and it is read aloud as &quot; plus three choose four&quot;.

== Properties ==
Two of every three pentatope numbers are also pentagonal numbers. To be precise, the th pentatope number is always the formula_3th pentagonal number and the th pentatope number is always the formula_4th pentagonal number. The th pentatope number is the generalized pentagonal number obtained by taking the negative index formula_5 in the formula for pentagonal numbers. (These expressions always give integers).

The infinite sum of the reciprocals of all pentatope numbers is . This can be derived using telescoping series.

:formula_6

Pentatope numbers can be represented as the sum of the first tetrahedral numbers:

:formula_7

and are also related to tetrahedral numbers themselves:

:formula_8

No prime number is the predecessor of a pentatope number (it needs to check only -1 and ), and the largest semiprime which is the predecessor of a pentatope number is 1819.

Similarly, the only primes preceding a 6-simplex number are 83 and 461.

== Test for pentatope numbers ==
We can derive this test from the formula for the th pentatope number.

Given a positive integer , to test whether it is a pentatope number we can compute the positive root using Ferrari&#x27;s method:

:formula_9

The number is pentatope if and only if is a natural number. In that case is the th pentatope number.

== Generating function ==
The generating function for pentatope numbers is
:formula_10

== Applications ==
In biochemistry, the pentatope numbers represent the number of possible arrangements of &quot;n&quot; different polypeptide subunits in a tetrameric (tetrahedral) protein.

<text>Aquaplaning or hydroplaning by the tires of a road vehicle, aircraft or other wheeled vehicle occurs when a layer of water builds between the wheels of the vehicle and the road surface, leading to a loss of traction that prevents the vehicle from responding to control inputs. If it occurs to all wheels simultaneously, the vehicle becomes, in effect, an uncontrolled sled. Aquaplaning is a different phenomenon from when water on the surface of the roadway merely acts as a lubricant. Traction is diminished on wet pavement even when aquaplaning is not occurring.

==Causes==
Every vehicle function that changes direction or speed relies on friction between the tires and the road surface. The grooves of a rubber tire are designed to disperse water from beneath the tire, providing high friction even in wet conditions. Aquaplaning occurs when a tire encounters more water than it can dissipate. Water pressure in front of the wheel forces a wedge of water under the leading edge of the tire, causing it to lift from the road. The tire then skates on a sheet of water with little, if any, direct road contact, and loss of control results. If multiple tires aquaplane, the vehicle may lose directional control and slide until it either collides with an obstacle, or slows enough that one or more tires contact the road again and friction is regained.

The risk of aquaplaning increases with the depth of standing water, higher speeds, and the sensitivity of a vehicle to that water depth.

===Water depth factors===
* Depth of compacted wheel tracks and longitudinal depressions: Heavy vehicles can cause ruts in the pavement over time that allow water to pool.
* Pavement micro- and macrotexture: Concrete can be preferable to hotmix asphalt because it offers better resistance to rut formation, though this depends on the age of the surface and the construction techniques employed while paving. Concrete also requires special attention to ensure that it has sufficient texture.
* Pavement cross slope and grade: Cross slope is the extent to which the cross-section of a road resembles an upturned U. Higher cross slopes allow water to drain more easily. Grade is the steepness of the road at a particular point, which affects both drainage and force exerted by the vehicle on the road. Vehicles are less likely to aquaplane while traveling uphill, and far more likely to do so at the trough of two connected hills where water tends to pool. The resultant of cross slope and grade is called drainage gradient or &quot;resulting grade&quot;. Most road design manuals require that the drainage gradient in all road sections must exceed 0.5%, in order to avoid a thick water film during and after rainfall. Areas where the drainage gradient may fall below the minimum limit 0.5% are found at the entrance and exit of banked outer curves. These hot spots are typically less than 1% of the road length, but a large share of all skid crashes occur there. One method for the road designer to reduce the crash risk is to move the cross slope transition from the outer curve and to a straight road section, where lateral forces are lower. If possible, the cross slope transition should be placed in a slight up- or downgrade, thereby avoiding that the drainage gradient drops to zero. The UK road design manual actually calls for placement of a cross slope transition in an artificially created slope, if needed. In some cases, permeable asphalt or concrete can be used to improve drainage in the cross slope transitions.
* Width of pavement: Wider roads require a higher cross slope to achieve the same degree of drainage.
* Roadway curvature
* Rainfall intensity and duration

===Vehicle sensitivity factors===

* The driver&#x27;s speed, acceleration, braking, and steering
* Tire tread wear: Worn tires will aquaplane more easily for lack of tread depth. Half-worn treads result in aquaplaning about lower than with full-tread tires.
* Tire inflation pressure: Underinflation can cause a tire to deflect inward, raising the tire center and preventing the tread from clearing water.
* Tire tread aspect ratio: The longer and thinner the contact patch, the less likely a tire will aquaplane. tires that present the greatest risk are small in diameter and wide. 
* Vehicle weight: More weight on a properly inflated tire lengthens the contact patch, improving its aspect ratio. Weight can have the opposite effect if the tire is underinflated.
* Vehicle type: Combination vehicles like semi-trailers are more likely to experience uneven aquaplaning caused by uneven weight distribution. An unloaded trailer will aquaplane sooner than the cab pulling it. Pickup trucks or SUVs towing trailers also present similar problems.

There is no precise equation to determine the speed at which a vehicle will aquaplane. Existing efforts have derived rules of thumb from empirical testing. In general, cars start to aquaplane at speeds above .

===Motorcycles===
Motorcycles benefit from narrow tires with round, canoe-shaped contact patches. Narrow tires are less vulnerable to aquaplaning because vehicle weight is distributed over a smaller area, and rounded tires more easily push water aside. These advantages diminish on lighter motorcycles with naturally wide tires, like those in the supersport class. Further, wet conditions reduce the lateral force that any tire can accommodate before sliding. While a slide in a four-wheeled vehicle may be corrected, the same slide on a motorcycle will generally cause the rider to fall. Thus, despite the relative lack of aquaplaning danger in wet conditions, motorcycle riders must be even more cautious because overall traction is reduced by wet roadways.

==In motor vehicles==
=== Speed ===
It is possible to approximate the speed at which total hydroplaning occurs, with the following equation:

formula_1

where formula_2 is the tire pressure in psi and the resulting formula_3 is the speed in mph for when the vehicle will begin to totally hydroplane. Considering an example vehicle with a tire pressure of 35 psi, one can approximate that 61 mph is the speed when the tires would lose contact with the road&#x27;s surface.

However, the above equation only gives a very rough approximation. Resistance to aquaplaning is governed by several different factors, chiefly vehicle weight, tire width and tread pattern, as all affect the surface pressure exerted on the road by the tire over a given area of the contact patch - a narrow tire with a lot of weight placed upon it and an aggressive tread pattern will resist aquaplaning at far higher speeds than a wide tire on a light vehicle with minimal tread. Furthermore, the likelihood of aquaplaning drastically increases with water depth.

===Response===
What the driver experiences when a vehicle aquaplanes depends on which wheels have lost traction and the direction of travel.

If the vehicle is traveling straight, it may begin to feel slightly loose. If there was a high level of road feel in normal conditions, it may suddenly diminish. Small correctional control inputs have no effect.

If the drive wheels aquaplane, there may be a sudden audible rise in engine RPM and indicated speed as they begin to spin. In a broad highway turn, if the front wheels lose traction, the car will suddenly drift towards the outside of the bend. If the rear wheels lose traction, the back of the car will slew out sideways into a skid. If all four wheels aquaplane at once, the car will slide in a straight line, again towards the outside of the bend if in a turn. When any or all of the wheels regain traction, there may be a sudden jerk in whatever direction that wheel is pointed.

===Recovery===

Control inputs tend to be counterproductive while aquaplaning. If the car is not in a turn, easing off the accelerator may slow it enough to regain traction. Steering inputs may put the car into a skid from which recovery would be difficult or impossible. If braking is unavoidable, the driver should do so smoothly and be prepared for instability.

If the rear wheels aquaplane and cause oversteer, the driver should steer in the direction of the skid until the rear tires regain traction, and then rapidly steer in the other direction to straighten the car.

===Prevention by the driver===
The best strategy is to avoid contributors to aquaplaning. Proper tire pressure, narrow and unworn tires, and reduced speeds from those judged suitably moderate in the dry will mitigate the risk of aquaplaning, as will avoidance of standing water.

Electronic stability control systems cannot replace defensive driving techniques and proper tire selection. These systems rely on selective wheel braking, which depends in turn on road contact. While stability control may help recovery from a skid when a vehicle slows enough to regain traction, it cannot prevent aquaplaning.

Because pooled water and changes in road conditions can require a smooth and timely reduction in speed, cruise control should not be used on wet or icy roads.

==In aircraft==
Aquaplaning, also known as hydroplaning, is a condition in which standing water, slush or snow, causes the moving wheel of an aircraft to lose contact with the load bearing surface on which it is rolling with the result that braking action on the wheel is not effective in reducing the ground speed of the aircraft.
Aquaplaning may reduce the effectiveness of wheel braking in aircraft on landing or aborting a takeoff, when it can cause the aircraft to run off the end of the runway. Aquaplaning has been a factor in multiple aircraft accidents, including the destruction of TAM Airlines Flight 3054 which ran off the end of the runway in São Paulo in 2007 during heavy rain. Aircraft which can employ reverse thrust braking have the advantage over road vehicles in such situations, as this type of braking is not affected by aquaplaning, but it requires a considerable distance to operate as it is not as effective as wheel braking on a dry runway.

Aquaplaning is a condition that can exist when an aircraft is landed on a runway surface contaminated with standing water, slush, and/or wet snow. Aquaplaning can have serious adverse effects on ground controllability and braking efficiency. The three basic types of aquaplaning are dynamic aquaplaning, reverted rubber aquaplaning, and viscous aquaplaning. Any one of the three can render an aircraft partially or totally uncontrollable anytime during the landing roll.

However this can be prevented by grooves on runways. In 1965, a US delegation visited the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough to view their grooved runway for reduced aquaplaning and initiated a study by the FAA and NASA. Grooving has since been adopted by most major airports around the world. Thin grooves are cut in the concrete which allows for water to be dissipated and further reduces the potential to aquaplane.

===Types===

====Viscous====
Viscous aquaplaning is due to the viscous properties of water. A thin film of fluid no more than 0.025 mm in depth is all that is needed. The tire cannot penetrate the fluid and the tire rolls on top of the film. This can occur at a much lower speed than dynamic aquaplane, but requires a smooth or smooth-acting surface such as asphalt or a touchdown area coated with the accumulated rubber of past landings. Such a surface can have the same friction coefficient as wet ice.

====Dynamic====
Dynamic aquaplaning is a relatively high-speed phenomenon that occurs when there is a film of water on the runway that is at least deep. As the speed of the aircraft and the depth of the water increase, the water layer builds up an increasing resistance to displacement, resulting in the formation of a wedge of water beneath the tire. At some speed, termed the aquaplaning speed (Vp), the upward force generated by water pressure equals the weight of the aircraft and the tire is lifted off the runway surface. In this condition, the tires no longer contribute to directional control, and braking action is nil. Dynamic aquaplaning is generally related to tire inflation pressure. Tests have shown that for tires with significant loads and enough water depth for the amount of tread so that the &quot;dynamic head&quot; pressure from the speed is applied to the whole contact patch, the minimum speed for dynamic aquaplaning (Vp) in knots is about 9 times the square root of the tire pressure in pounds per square inch (PSI). For an aircraft tire pressure of 64 PSI, the calculated aquaplaning speed would be approximately 72 knots. This speed is for a rolling, non-slipping wheel; a locked wheel reduces the Vp to 7.7 times the square root of the pressure. Therefore, once a locked tire starts aquaplaning it will continue until the speed reduces by other means (air drag or reverse thrust).

====Reverted rubber====
Reverted rubber (steam) aquaplaning occurs during heavy braking that results in a prolonged locked-wheel skid. Only a thin film of water on the runway is required to facilitate this type of aquaplaning. The tire skidding generates enough heat to change the water film into a cushion of steam which keeps the tire off the runway. A side effect of the heat is it causes the rubber in contact with the runway to revert to its original uncured state. Indications of an aircraft having experienced reverted rubber aquaplaning, are distinctive &#x27;steam-cleaned&#x27; marks on the runway surface and a patch of reverted rubber on the tire.

Reverted rubber aquaplaning frequently follows an encounter with dynamic aquaplaning, during which time the pilot may have the brakes locked in an attempt to slow the aircraft. Eventually the aircraft slows enough to where the tires make contact with the runway surface and the aircraft begins to skid. The remedy for this type of aquaplane is for the pilot to release the brakes and allow the wheels to spin up and apply moderate braking. Reverted rubber aquaplaning is insidious in that the pilot may not know when it begins, and it can persist to very slow groundspeeds (20 knots or less).

===Reducing risk===
Any aquaplaning tire reduces both braking effectiveness and directional control.

When confronted with the possibility of aquaplaning, pilots are advised to land on a grooved runway (if available). Touchdown speed should be as slow as possible consistent with safety. After the nosewheel is lowered to the runway, moderate braking should be applied. If deceleration is not detected and aquaplaning is suspected, the nose should be raised and aerodynamic drag utilized to decelerate to a point where the brakes do become effective.

Proper braking technique is essential. The brakes should be applied firmly until reaching a point just short of a skid. At the first sign of a skid, the pilot should release brake pressure and allow the wheels to spin up. Directional control should be maintained as far as possible with the rudder. In a crosswind, if aquaplaning should occur, the crosswind will cause the aircraft to simultaneously weathervane into the wind (i.e. the nose will turn toward the wind) as well as slide downwind (the plane will tend to slide in the direction the air is moving). For small aircraft, holding the nose up as if performing a soft field landing and using the rudder to aerodynamically maintain directional control while holding the upwind aileron in the best position to prevent lifting the wing should help. However, avoid landing in heavy rain where the crosswind component of the wind is higher than the maximum demonstrated crosswind listed in the Pilot Operations Handbook.

<text>Moretus is a lunar impact crater located in the heavily cratered highland region near the south pole of the Moon.

South of Moretus, the crater Short is located, while to the north is Cysatus. To the northwest lies Gruemberger, and Curtius is located to the northeast. Due to the location near the lunar limb, the crater appears oblong because of foreshortening. The crater is named after the 17th-century Flemish mathematician and geometer Theodorus Moretus.

The rim of the crater has a wide, terraced inner wall, and a complex outer . The floor has been partly resurfaced and is relatively flat. In the middle is a central mountain formation that rises about 2.1 kilometers above the surrounding floor.

== Satellite craters ==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Moretus.

<text>Sculling is the use of oars to propel a boat by moving them through the water on both sides of the craft, or moving one oar over the stern. A long, narrow boat with sliding seats, rigged with two oars per rower may be referred to as a scull, its oars may be referred to as sculls and a person rowing it referred to as sculler. 

Sculling is distinguished from sweep rowing, whereby each boat crew member employs an oar, complemented by another crew member on the opposite side with an oar, usually with each pulling it with two hands and from stern sculling, which uses an oar to propel a vessel with side-to-side movements from the stern.

==Overview==
Sculling is a form of rowing in which a boat is propelled by one or more rowers, each of whom operates two oars, one held in the fingers and upper palm of each hand. This contrasts with the other common method of rowing, sweep rowing, in which each rower may use both hands to operate a single oar on either the port or starboard side of the boat. Sculling is generally considered the more technically complex of the two disciplines. Sculling can either be competitive or recreational, but the watercraft used will vary between the two as the racing shells of competitive rowing are built for speed rather than stability. Racing shells are also far more expensive and fragile than what is suitable for the recreational rower; a typical racing shell sells for thousands of dollars while recreational sculling boats may cost significantly less.

===In crew ===

Sculling, one of the two major divisions of crew (or competitive rowing), is composed of races between small, sculled boats crewed by various numbers of rowers. Generally, one, two, or four athletes row these shells. These shells are classified according to the number of rowers that they can hold: singles have one seat, doubles have two, and quads have four. In keeping with this pattern, quads rowed by three people (due, for instance, to a temporary shortage of rowers) are often colloquially referred to as &quot;triples&quot;. The boat manufacturer &#x27;Stampflï&#x27; has created a triple with only three seats (rather than using a quad occupied by three people). A rare sculling shell is the octuple, rowed by an eight-man crew, which is sometimes used by large rowing programs to teach novice rowers how to scull in a balanced, coxed boat.

The physical movement of sculling is split into two main parts: the drive and the recovery. These two parts are separated by what is called the &quot;catch&quot; and the &quot;finish&quot;. The drive is the section of the rowing stroke where the face of the oars, also known as blades, are firmly placed in the water and the rower is propelling the boat forwards by pulling against the anchor the oars provide. The recovery is the section where the rower&#x27;s blades are not in the water, but instead gliding above it as the rower prepares for the next stroke. The catch is the moment the blades are dropped into the water at the end of the recovery and the start of the drive, while the finish is when the blades are slipping out after the drive is done and the recovery is beginning. In order to improve balance on the recovery, the blades are feathered, or held parallel to the surface of the water, at the finish, and squared (perpendicular to the water surface) at the catch.

Competitive crew requires an efficient stroke with all rowers matching the cadence and movements of the stroke seat, the rower closest to the shell&#x27;s stern. The shell may have a coxswain, or &quot;cox&quot;, to steer the boat, encourage the crew, and monitor the rate, though coxswains are highly uncommon in competitive sculling shells and the rower in bow seat usually takes on these responsibilities instead. The bow-most rower may have equipment that attaches the skeg of the shell to one of the bow&#x27;s shoes to aid with the steering; without such equipment, a sculling boat is directed by uneven pressure applied to the opposing blades.

A key technical difference between sculling and sweeping in crew is that the sculling oar handles overlap twice during the stroke cycle (sweep oar handles never overlap during normal rowing because each sweeper usually holds only one oar). The overlap occurs at the midpoint of the drive and again during the recovery; because of this, scullers must hold one hand (conventionally the left hand) higher than the other at the point of overlap. To prevent this from impacting the balance of the boat, one oarlock (conventionally the starboard one, to the rower&#x27;s lefthand side) is rigged higher than the other prior to rowing. This prevents the oar handles and the sculler&#x27;s thumbs from colliding with one another and causing a crab or other problems.

<text>Müller is a lunar impact crater. It was named after Austrian astronomer Karl Müller. It is located in the highlands near the center of the Moon, in the center of the triangle formed by the much larger craters Albategnius, Ptolemaeus, and Hipparchus. To the east lies Halley, while to the northwest is Gyldén.

The rim of this crater is irregular and slightly oblong, with the long dimension oriented along a north–south axis. The southeastern rim is notched by two smaller craters identified as Müller A and Müller O.

Perhaps the most distinctive feature of this crater is the peculiar linear formation of small craters that starts at the southern edge of Müller&#x27;s rim. These follow a line to the northwest, tangential to the rim of Ptolemaeus.
==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Müller.

<text>Piccolomini is a prominent lunar impact crater located in the southeastern sector of the Moon. The crater is named after 16th century Italian Archbishop and astronomer Alessandro Piccolomini. The crater Rothmann lies to the west-southwest, and to the south is Stiborius. The lengthy Rupes Altai begins at the western rim of Piccolomini, curving to the northwest. It is 88 kilometers in diameter and 4,500 meters deep. It is from the Upper Imbrian period, 3.8 to 3.2 billion years ago.

The crater rim has not been severely worn by crater impacts, and the inner wall possesses wide terraces. These structures have been somewhat smoothed by landslips and erosion, most likely induced by seismic activity. An influx of material has entered across the northern rim, flowing down toward the base. The crater floor is relatively smooth, with only minor hills and impact craters. In the middle is a complex central peak surrounded by lesser mounts. The main peak rises to a height of 2.0 kilometers above the surrounding floor.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Piccolomini.

<doc id="927339" wikidata="Q67020" url="?curid=927339" title="Gustav Mie">
<text>Gustav Adolf Feodor Wilhelm Ludwig Mie (; 29 September 1868 – 13 February 1957) was a German physicist. His work included Mie scattering, the Mie potential, the Mie–Grüneisen equation of state and an early effort at classical unified field theories.

==Life==
Mie was born in Rostock, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Germany in 1868. From 1886 he studied mathematics and physics at the University of Rostock. In addition to his major subjects, he also attended lectures in chemistry, zoology, geology, mineralogy and astronomy, as well as logic and metaphysics. In 1889 he continued his studies at the University of Heidelberg and received a doctoral degree in mathematics in 1892 (at the age of 22). His thesis is titled &quot;Zum Fundamentalsatz über die Existenz von Integralen partieller Differentialgleichungen&quot; (On the fundamental theorem on the existence of integrals of partial differential equations) and his supervisor was Leo Königsberger.

In 1897 he got his habilitation at the University of Göttingen in theoretical physics and in 1902 became extraordinary professor for theoretical physics at the University of Greifswald. In 1917 he became full professor for experimental physics at Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. In 1924 he became professor at the University of Freiburg, where he worked up to his retirement in 1935.

In Freiburg, during the Nazi dictatorship, Mie was member of the university opposition of the so-called &quot;Freiburger Kreis&quot; (Freiburg Circles) and one of the participants of the original &quot;Freiburger Konzil&quot;.

He died at Freiburg im Breisgau in 1957.

==Work==

During his Greifswald years Mie worked on the computation of scattering of an electromagnetic wave by a homogeneous dielectric sphere, which was published in 1908 under the title of &quot;Contributions to the optics of turbid media, particularly of colloidal metal solutions&quot; in &quot;Annalen der Physik&quot;. The term Mie scattering is still related to his name. Using Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory applied to spherical gold particles Mie provided a theoretical treatment of plasmon resonance absorption of gold colloids. The sharp absorption bands depend on the particle size and explain the change in colour that occurs as the size of the colloid nanoparticles is increased from 20 to 1600 nm. He wrote further important contributions to electromagnetism and also to relativity theory. 
In addition he was employed on measurements units and finally developed his Mie system of units in 1910 with the basic units Volt, Ampere, Coulomb and Second (VACS-system).

In 1912 and 1913 Mie published the first attempt at a unified theory of matter in the 20th century. His motivation was to explain the &#x27;invisible&#x27; electron and relate gravitation to matter; his theory had three core assumptions: 1) electrical and magnetic fields exist inside of electrons, 2) special relativity, and 3) new states of ether would be sufficient to explain all phenomenon of the material world.

==Honors==

A crater on Mars was named in his honor, and also a building of the University of Freiburg as well as a lecture hall at the Martin Luther University of Halle Wittenberg, where he first became a full professor, carries his name.

<doc id="927342" wikidata="Q3366801" url="?curid=927342" title="Los Angeles World Airports">
<text>Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA) is the airport authority that owns and operates Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and Van Nuys Airport (VNY) for the city of Los Angeles, California. LAWA also owns and manages aviation-related property near the Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD).

The authority&#x27;s headquarters are on the grounds of LAX in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Westchester.

== History ==
LAWA was established in 1928 as the Los Angeles Department of Airports for the purpose of operating Los Angeles Municipal Airport, now known as Los Angeles International Airport or simply LAX.

The Department of Airports changed its name to Los Angeles World Airports in 1997.

== Current Airports ==
Los Angeles World Airports owns and operates two airports:

=== Los Angeles International Airport ===

Los Angeles opened its main airport on October 1, 1928. At the time of the opening, it was known as Mines Field and was little more than a dirt airstrip with no facilities. The first building, the historic Hangar No. 1, was erected in 1929. In 1930, the facility was renamed Los Angeles Municipal Airport, and mostly served general aviation. The facility was pressed into service as a military airfield during World War II. The airport started its conversion into a major passenger airport in 1946, and in 1949 became Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). The current U-shaped terminal area was added in 1961 and expanded several times.

LAX is the United States&#x27; second busiest airport 
(as of 2019) following Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. As the largest and busiest international airport on the U.S. West Coast, LAX is a major international gateway to the United States and also serves as a connection point for passengers traveling internationally.

=== Van Nuys Airport ===
The Van Nuys Airport was originally built as the Metropolitan Airport and was used by Timm Aircraft Corporation. The airport was purchased by the military in 1942 and operated as the Van Nuys Army Air Field. In 1949, after the end of the war, the Los Angeles Department of Airports acquired the facility and renamed it San Fernando Valley Airport and later Van Nuys Airport (VNY).

Today, Van Nuys is one of the busiest general aviation airports in the world, averaging over 230,000 takeoffs and landings annually.

== Former Airports ==

=== Ontario International Airport ===
In 1967, the city of Ontario in neighboring San Bernardino County asked the Los Angeles Department of Airports to enter into a Joint Powers Agreement for the operation and management of Ontario International Airport (ONT). The Los Angeles Department of Airports later acquired ONT from the city of Ontario in 1985, and expanded the airport&#x27;s 485 acres of land to more than 1,700 acres and invested more than US$500 million in improvements.

In April 2013, the city of Ontario filed a legal complaint against LAWA alleging mismanagement of the Ontario Airport, which resulted in a 40% decline of traffic between 2007 and 2013. LAWA countered the complaint, saying the Great Recession was responsible for the decline in activity. After years of negotiations, LAWA sold its interest in ONT to the newly formed Ontario International Airport Authority (OIAA) in December 2015 for a total of US$190 million. It transferred operational management of the airport to OIAA on November 1, 2016.

=== Palmdale Regional Airport ===
In 1969, the Los Angeles Department of Airports began searching for a location to build a secondary international airport to relieve congestion at LAX. The location selected was in the Antelope Valley near the city of Palmdale.

From 1969 to 1983, LAWA acquired over 17,500 acres through voluntary acquisitions and eminent domain to develop an intercontinental airport. Development of &quot;Palmdale Intercontinental Airport&quot; never materialized due in part to lack of demand for commercial air services, environmental litigation, and opposition from the United States Air Force (USAF) whose Plant 42 is located adjacent to LAWA-acquired land.

The agency eventually entered into a lease agreement with the USAF to use Air Force Plant 42 runways and to build and operate a small terminal. Palmdale Regional Airport (PMD) began commercial operations in June 1971, but was not able to maintain steady demand with passenger traffic peaking in 1978 with 36,000 passengers before airline services eventually ceased in 1983. Two airlines began operating commercial services at PMD in 1990, but were again unable to maintain demand and ended services in 1998. In June 2007, United Airlines began operating at PMD, but ceased operations in December 2008 citing lack of demand.

At the end of 2013, LAWA transferred its lease with the USAF to the City of Palmdale.

== Operations ==

=== Ground transportation ===

LAWA operates the FlyAway bus service, which runs two shuttle routes between LAX and the following: Van Nuys in the San Fernando Valley, and Los Angeles Union Station in Downtown Los Angeles.

The agency is currently constructing the LAX Automated People Mover.

=== Law enforcement ===

LAWA maintains its own police department, the Los Angeles Airport Police sometimes referred to as &quot;LAWAPD&quot;,&quot;LAXPD&quot;, or (APD). LAWAPD is the fourth largest law enforcement agency in Los Angeles County, with more than 1,100 law enforcement, security and staff personnel. LAWAPD has patrolled jointly with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) since the opening of the current terminal area in 1961. On December 9, 2021, LAWA celebrated the opening of its new-state-of-the-art Airport Police Facility (APF)headquarters. The new $216 million aviation police facility is the largest in the nation.

=== Revenue and expenditures ===
LAWA raises revenue by collecting aircraft landing fees, in addition to property leases and concession fees from airport tenants. LAWA still owns over 17,500 acres of land in the Antelope Valley that was acquired for the never-developed &quot;Palmdale Intercontinental Airport&quot; and generates revenue by leasing portions of it.

Expenditures include runway and building maintenance fees, capital improvements and administration.

== Governance ==

LAWA is a branch of the city of Los Angeles and is governed by a seven-member Board of Airport Commissioners. The Los Angeles City Charter requires one member to reside within the area surrounding LAX and another member to reside within the area surrounding the Van Nuys Airport. The board is appointed by the Mayor of Los Angeles and approved by Los Angeles City Council. The Mayor also appoints the executive director who oversees over 4,000 employees and the day-to-day operations of the two airports.

<text>&quot;Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves&quot; () is a folk tale in Arabic added to the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; in the 18th century by its French translator Antoine Galland, who heard it from Syrian storyteller Hanna Diyab. As one of the most popular &quot;Arabian Nights&quot; tales, it has been widely retold and performed in many media across the world, especially for children (for whom the more violent aspects of the story are often removed).

In the original version, Ali Baba ( &quot;&quot;) is a poor woodcutter and an honest person who discovers the secret treasure of a thieves&#x27; den, and enters with the magic phrase &quot;open sesame&quot;. The thieves try to kill Ali Baba, and his rich and greedy brother Cassim tries to steal the treasure for himself, but Ali Baba’s faithful slave-girl foils their plots. His son marries her, and Ali Baba keeps the secret of the treasure.

==Textual history==
The tale was added to the story collection &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; by one of its European translators, Antoine Galland, who called his volumes &quot;Les Mille et Une Nuits&quot; (1704–1717). Galland was an 18th-century French Orientalist who heard it in oral form from a Syrian Maronite story-teller called Hanna Diyab, who came from Aleppo in modern-day Syria and told the story in Paris. In any case, the earliest known text of the story is Galland&#x27;s French version. Richard F. Burton included it in the supplemental volumes (rather than the main collection of stories) of his translation (published as &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;).

The American Orientalist Duncan Black MacDonald discovered an Arabic-language manuscript of the story at the Bodleian Library; however, this was later found to be a counterfeit.

==Story==
Ali Baba and his older brother, Cassim ( &quot;&quot;, sometimes spelled Kasim), are the sons of a merchant. After their father&#x27;s death, the greedy Cassim marries a wealthy woman and becomes well-to-do, living lazily on their father&#x27;s business and his wife’s wealth. Ali Baba marries a poor woman and settles into the trade of a woodcutter. Cassim and his wife resent Ali Baba and his side of the family and do not share their wealth with them.

One day, Ali Baba is at work collecting and cutting firewood in the forest, when he happens to overhear a group of 40 thieves visiting their stored treasure. Their treasure is in a cave, the mouth of which is sealed by a huge rock. It opens on the magic words &quot;open sesame&quot; and seals itself on the words &quot;close sesame&quot;. When the thieves are gone, Ali Baba enters the cave himself and although there is a vast amount of riches stashed inside, he modestly takes only a single bag of gold coins home.

Ali Baba and his wife borrow his sister-in-law&#x27;s scales to weigh their new wealth. Unbeknownst to them, Cassim&#x27;s wife puts a blob of wax in the scales to find out what Ali Baba is using them for, as she is curious to know what kind of grain her impoverished brother-in-law needs to measure. 

To her shock, she finds a gold coin sticking to the scales and tells her husband. Under pressure from his brother, Ali Baba is forced to reveal the secret of the cave. Cassim goes to the cave, taking a donkey with him to take as much treasure as possible. He enters the cave with the magic words. However, in his excited greed over the treasure, he forgets the words to get out again and ends up trapped. The thieves find him there and kill him. When his brother does not come back, Ali Baba goes to the cave to look for him, and finds the body quartered and with each piece displayed just inside the cave&#x27;s entrance, as a warning to anyone else who might try to enter.

Ali Baba brings the corpse home where he entrusts Morgiana ( &quot;&quot;), a clever slave-girl from Cassim&#x27;s household, with the task of making others believe that Cassim has died a natural death. First, Morgiana purchases medicines from an apothecary, telling him that Cassim is gravely ill. Then, she finds an old tailor known as Baba Mustafa whom she pays, blindfolds, and leads to Cassim&#x27;s house. There, overnight, the tailor stitches the pieces of Cassim&#x27;s body back together. Ali Baba and his family are able to give Cassim a proper burial without anyone suspecting anything. Cassim’s wife does not find out about the cave or treasure.

The thieves, finding the body gone, realize that another person must have known their secret, so they set out to track him down. One of the thieves goes down to the town and comes across Baba Mustafa, who mentions that he has just sewn the pieces of a corpse back together. Realizing the dead man must have been the thieves&#x27; victim, the thief asks Baba Mustafa to lead the way to the house where the deed was performed. The tailor is blindfolded again, and in this state he is able to retrace his steps and find the house. 

The thief marks the door with a symbol so the other thieves can come back that night and kill everyone in the house. However, the thief has been seen by Morgiana who, loyal to her master, foils the thief&#x27;s plan by marking all the houses in the neighborhood similarly. When the 40 thieves return that night, they cannot identify the correct house, and their leader kills the unsuccessful thief in a furious rage. The next day, another thief revisits Baba Mustafa and tries again. Only this time, a chunk is chipped out of the stone step at Ali Baba&#x27;s front door. Again, Morgiana foils the plan by making similar chips in all the other doorsteps, and the second thief is killed for his failure as well. At last, the leader of the thieves goes and looks himself. This time, he memorizes every detail he can of the exterior of Ali Baba&#x27;s house.

The leader of the thieves pretends to be an oil merchant in need of Ali Baba&#x27;s hospitality, bringing with him mules loaded with 38 oil jars, one filled with oil, the other 37 hiding the other remaining thieves. Once Ali Baba is asleep, the thieves plan to kill him. Again, Morgiana discovers and foils the plan when her lamp runs out of oil and she has to get it from the merchant&#x27;s jars; the thieves give themselves away one by one hearing her approach and mistaking her for their boss. After refilling her lamp, Morgiana kills the 37 thieves in their jars by pouring boiling oil on them one by one. When their leader comes to rouse his men, he discovers they are all dead and escapes. The next morning, Morgiana tells Ali Baba about the thieves in the jars. They bury them, and Ali Baba shows his gratitude by giving Morgiana her freedom. However, she continues living with Ali Baba and his family anyway.

To exact revenge, the leader of the thieves establishes himself as a merchant, befriends Ali Baba&#x27;s son (who is now in charge of his late uncle Cassim&#x27;s business), and is invited to dinner at Ali Baba&#x27;s house. However, the thief is recognized by Morgiana, who performs a sword dance with a dagger for the diners and plunges it into the thief&#x27;s heart, when he is off his guard. Ali Baba is at first angry with Morgiana, but when he finds out the thief wanted to kill him, he is extremely grateful and rewards Morgiana by marrying her to his son. Ali Baba is then left as the only one knowing the secret of the treasure in the cave and how to access it.

<doc id="927350" wikidata="Q6616843" url="?curid=927350" title="List of discredited substances">
<text>This is a list of substances or materials generally considered discredited.

A substance can be discredited in one of three ways:

#It was widely believed to exist at one time but no longer is. Such substances are often part of an obsolete scientific theory.
#It was once believed to have drastically different properties from those accepted now. It was widely claimed and believed to possess significant properties that are no longer attributed to it.
#It is currently believed to exist as part of a theory that has not met the theoretical and experimental requirements of mainstream science. In particular, such a theory must be predictive.

==Substances whose existence is discredited==

==Substances whose properties are discredited==
This is not to be construed as implying that these items––are discredited. What is listed are fire, water, metal, etc. as universal principles or fundamentals.

<text>San Marco is one of the six sestieri of Venice, lying in the heart of the city as the main place of Venice. San Marco also includes the island of San Giorgio Maggiore. Although the district includes Saint Mark&#x27;s Square, that was never administered as part of the sestiere.

==Overview==
The small district includes many of Venice&#x27;s most famous sights, including St Mark&#x27;s Square, Saint Mark&#x27;s Basilica, the Doge&#x27;s Palace, Harry&#x27;s Bar, the Palazzo Dandolo, Palazzo Corner Contarini dei Cavalli, Palazzo Corner Valmarana, Palazzo D&#x27;Anna Viaro Martinengo Volpi di Misurata, Palazzo Cavalli, San Moisè, the La Fenice theatre, the Palazzo Grassi and Palazzo Bellavite, and the churches of San Beneto, San Fantin, Santa Maria del Giglio, San Maurizio, San Moisè, Santo Stefano, San Salvador, San Zulian and San Samuele.

The area is densely built and was the location of Venice&#x27;s government. It is now heavily touristed and there are many hotels, banks and expensive shops.

San Marco is also a place which is used in several video games such as in &quot;Tekken&quot;, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II&quot;, and &quot;Venetica&quot;.

<doc id="927369" wikidata="Q1572138" url="?curid=927369" title="Pitatus (crater)">
<text>Pitatus is an ancient lunar impact crater located at the southern edge of Mare Nubium. It was named after Italian astronomer Pietro Pitati by the IAU in 1935. Joined to the northwest rim is the crater Hesiodus, and the two are joined by a narrow cleft. To the south lie the attached Wurzelbauer and Gauricus.

==Description==
The complex wall of Pitatus is heavily worn, and has been encroached by lava flows. The rim is lowest to the north, where the lava almost joins the Mare Nubium. Near the middle is a low central peak that is offset to the northwest of center. This peak only rises to a height of 0.5 km.

Pitatus is a floor-fractured crater, meaning it was flooded from the interior by magma intrusion through cracks and openings. (See also Gassendi and Posidonius for similar features.) The flooded crater floor contains low hills in the east and a system of slender clefts named the Rimae Pitatus. The larger and more spectacular of these rilles follow the edges of the inner walls, especially in the northern and eastern halves. The floor also contains the faint traces of deposited ray markings.

Just to the north of Pitatus in the neighboring mare is the half-buried rim of Pitatus S, covered in the past when Mare Nubium was formed.

Pitatus is a crater of Nectarian age.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Pitatus.

<doc id="927381" wikidata="Q2151737" url="?curid=927381" title="Vendelinus (crater)">
<text>Vendelinus is an ancient lunar impact crater located on the eastern edge of Mare Fecunditatis. To the north of Vendelinus is the prominent crater Langrenus, while to the southeast is Petavius, forming a chain of prominent craters near the eastern rim. Due to its location, the crater appears oblong due to foreshortening.

The crater was named after a Flemish astronomer Godefroy Wendelin in 1651 by Giovanni Riccioli. In 1935 this name was approved by International Astronomical Union.

The crater is heavily worn and overlapped by multiple craters, making this feature more difficult to identify except at low sun angles. The irregular rim is broken in several locations by overlapping craters. The most prominent of these is the break in the northeast wall from the overlapping crater Lamé. The smaller Lohse overlaps the rim to the northwest, and at the south end the crater wall is joined to Holden.

The floor of Vendelinus is flat and covered by a dark lava flow. (Webb noted that a dark patch could be seen on the floor of this crater at full moon.) It lacks a central peak, but includes multiple impact craters of various dimensions. Some of these are secondary craters from Langrenus, and display an oblong shape. The outer s of Lamé form a rise on the northeastern floor.

== Satellite craters ==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Vendelinus.

The following craters have been renamed by the IAU:

* Vendelinus C — &quot;See&quot; Lamé (crater).

<text>Drop Dead Fred is a 1991 black comedy fantasy film directed by Ate de Jong, produced by PolyGram and Working Title Films and released and distributed by New Line Cinema, starring Phoebe Cates as a young woman named Elizabeth Cronin and Rik Mayall as her imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred, with Marsha Mason, Carrie Fisher, Ron Eldard, Tim Matheson, and Bridget Fonda in supporting roles. It follows Elizabeth as she is haunted by Fred in adulthood. It received negative reviews from critics, but has since become a cult film.

==Plot==
Unassertive and repressed Minneapolis court reporter Elizabeth Cronin visits her husband Charles, from whom she is separated, on her lunch break, hoping to sort out their problems. He reasserts his desire for a divorce and says that he is in love with another woman, named Annabella.

While she is at a public phone, first a man breaks into her car to steal her purse, and another steals the car itself. Forced to run back to work at the courthouse, she arrives late and gets fired. As she leaves the courthouse, she runs into childhood friend Mickey Bunce, who brings up memories they shared, including those of Elizabeth&#x27;s imaginary friend, Drop Dead Fred. Mickey reminds her how everybody else thought she was crazy. A series of flashbacks show that though he caused havoc, he also gave her happiness and a release from her oppressive mother, Polly.

After a pep talk from her friend Janie, Elizabeth moves back in with her mother, who blames her for her divorce, and changes her appearance to impress Charles. She finds a taped-shut jack-in-the-box, and removes the tape, releasing Fred. He agrees to help her feel better, which she believes will only happen when she wins back Charles. However, his childish antics do more harm than good. He sinks Janie&#x27;s houseboat, causes havoc at a restaurant, and tricks Elizabeth into attacking a violinist in a shopping mall.

Worried by Elizabeth&#x27;s recent odd behavior, Polly takes her to a (children&#x27;s) psychologist. In the waiting room, Fred is seen meeting up with the imaginary friends of other patients, who are all children. The doctor prescribes medication to rid her of Fred, whom he and Polly believe is a figment of her imagination. The medication also has the effect of slowly killing Fred.

Fred reminds Elizabeth that one day, while they were making a mess on the dinner table, she heard her mother coming and she imagined him hiding in a jack-in-the-box. Polly, fed up with Elizabeth playing with Fred, took the jack-in-the-box and taped it shut, essentially taking Fred away from her. The event left Elizabeth traumatized, and her father Nigel left not long after. Elizabeth then wrote a letter to Fred, saying they&#x27;d run away together. Elizabeth and Fred run away from Polly and a nurse to Charles&#x27; party.

Charles now wants her back and she is overjoyed until Fred discovers he is still cheating with Annabella and tells her. Heartbroken, she tells Fred that she cannot leave Charles because she is scared of being alone. She then passes out. They escape to a dream sequence in which she is able to reject Charles and stand up to Polly, declaring she is no longer afraid of her. She frees her imprisoned childhood self. Fred tells her that she no longer needs him, so they kiss and he disappears.

Upon awakening, Elizabeth dumps Charles and stands up to Polly. Before leaving, she reconciles with Polly and encourages her to find a friend to escape her own loneliness. Days later, she visits Mickey and his daughter Natalie, who blames Drop Dead Fred for the mischief that just caused her nanny to quit. Elizabeth realizes Fred is now with Natalie, although she cannot see him anymore.

==Cast==
==Production==
Tim Burton and Robin Williams were offered the roles of director and Fred, respectively. They turned them down.

The film&#x27;s screenplay was rewritten by director Ate de Jong and producer Paul Webster throughout pre-production. For the rewrites, de Jong took inspiration from being molested as a child by his older half-brother, stating, &quot;The trauma of child abuse goes deep and its claws reach far in time. It was not something ever spoken about on the set, not with Rik or anyone, but for me it existed.&quot;

Filming took place in August and September 1990. Filmed in Minneapolis, a large part of the film was filmed at Prince&#x27;s Paisley Park Studios in the suburb of Chanhassen.

==Reception==

===Box office===

The film, produced on a budget of just under $6.8 million, was released theatrically in the United States and Canada on May 24, 1991, grossing $3,625,648 on its opening weekend, and $13,878,334 over its entire theatrical run. It grossed £1,794,121 in the UK and $24 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
The film was critically panned upon release, but has gone on to become a cult film. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 11% based on 36 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states, &quot;Tackling mature themes with an infantile sensibility, &quot;Drop Dead Fred&quot; is an ill-conceived family comedy that is more likely to stir up a headache than the imagination.&quot; On Metacritic it has a score of 25% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars and said &quot;This is easily one of the worst films I&#x27;ve ever seen.&quot; Writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Margaret Lyons asked, &quot;Is it supposed to be hilarious, or a really, really depressing story about the long-term effects of emotional abuse?&quot; Leonard Maltin stated, &quot;Phoebe Cates&#x27; appealing performance can&#x27;t salvage this putrid mess...recommended only for people who think nose-picking is funny.&quot;

Peter Freedman of the &quot;Radio Times&quot; called it a &quot;largely uninteresting and unfunny comedy&quot;, adding, &quot;It&#x27;s a nice idea, but it falls between all available stools and ends up as a mess on the floor thanks to the poor execution. It&#x27;s particularly irritating if you&#x27;ve seen the much better &quot;Harvey&quot;.&quot; Angie Errigo of &quot;Empire&quot; magazine wrote, &quot;There is scarcely a laugh to be had unless you are six years old or immoderately fond of such wheezes as depositing dog poop on a white carpet.&quot;

Writing for &quot;Mystical Movie Guide&quot;, Carl Schroeder wrote, &quot;The imaginary friend is cavortingly rude for a reason; he served to push the girlchild to do mischief for attention and as a cry for help. Now grown up, the woman has forgotten and is about to lose her soul, so events call for some kind of literal return of her demon to force the exposure of her pain. This psychic crisis is poignantly realistic...the creature who is visible only to the woman is like a poltergeist energy of her repressed self, a problematic ego container into which her powers of assertion and creativity were poured and stored.&quot; He went on to call the movie&#x27;s resolution &quot;startlingly beautiful.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in 2021, Alexander Larman praised the film, calling it &quot;a sophisticated and ahead-of-its-time black comic exploration of anxiety and depression.&quot; Film critic Johanna Steinmetz suggested that its premise was inspired by children with imaginary friends who later develop dissociative identity disorder.

<doc id="927403" wikidata="Q6662599" url="?curid=927403" title="Lloyd M. Bucher">
<text>Lloyd Mark &quot;Pete&quot; Bucher ( ; 1 September 1927 – 28 January 2004) was an officer in the United States Navy, who is best remembered as the captain of USS &quot;Pueblo&quot;, which was seized by North Korea on January 23, 1968.

==Early life and education==
Bucher was born in Pocatello, Idaho, where he was given up for adoption by his birth mother, and was orphaned at an early age (his adoptive mother dying of cancer when he was three). He was raised by his father, grandparents, various other family members, and his father again, then drifted through a series of Catholic orphanages in Idaho until he read a magazine article about Father Flanagan&#x27;s Boys Home in Boys Town, Nebraska. He wrote to Flanagan and was surprised when he received a reply. Bucher was accepted at Boys Town in the summer of 1941, and for the rest of his life considered it to be his home. He flourished at Boys Town, making honor roll the majority of his time there and playing football, basketball, track, and baseball.

Like many young men during World War II, he dropped out of his senior year to enlist in the military, serving the last year of the war and for two years afterward (1945–1947) in the Navy. As an enlisted man, Bucher reached the rank of quartermaster second class and obtained a high-school diploma. He then worked in construction and as a bartender before entering the University of Nebraska on a football scholarship in 1949. While attending the university, he signed up for Naval ROTC. He graduated with a bachelor of science degree in 1953 and was commissioned as an ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve.

==Career as a submariner==
In January 1954, Bucher was called to active duty and served as division and education officer on the USS &quot;Mount McKinley&quot;. In mid-1955, he was admitted to submarine school at New London, Connecticut.

After graduation, Bucher served as torpedo and gunnery officer of submarine USS &quot;Besugo&quot;, operations officer of USS &quot;Caiman&quot;, and assistant plans officer for logistics on the staff of Commander, Mine Force, Pacific Fleet.

From 1961 to 1964, he served on submarine USS &quot;Ronquil&quot;, rising from third officer to executive officer, after which he became an assistant operations officer on the staff of Commander Submarine Flotilla Seven in Yokosuka, Japan. Bucher loved submarines and his greatest desire was to command one. However, he was a conventional submariner not trained in nuclear power, and his career options became limited when the submarine force became increasingly populated by nuclear-powered submarines and nuclear-trained submarine officers effectively hand-picked by Admiral Hyman G. Rickover in the 1960s. As a result, when Bucher screened for command, he was slated for command of an auxiliary surface vessel outfitted for communications and signals intelligence (COMINT/SIGINT) collection, in this case, USS &quot;Pueblo&quot;.

==The &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident==

While monitoring North Korea in January 1968, &quot;Pueblo&quot; came under attack by North Korean naval forces, two Soviet-era submarine chasers, four motor torpedo boats, and two MiG-21 aircraft. U.S. Naval officials and the crew have claimed the ship was in international waters all the time. North Koreans attacked and ultimately boarded the ship, killing one man and taking the ship and her remaining crew of 82 to the port at Wonsan. For the next 11 months, Bucher and his crew were held as POWs by the North Koreans. The crew reported upon release that they were starved and regularly tortured while in North Korean custody. This treatment allegedly turned worse when the North Koreans realized that crewmen were secretly giving them &quot;the finger&quot; in staged propaganda photos,
an action the crew had initially explained away as being a &quot;Hawaiian good luck sign&quot;.

Bucher was psychologically tortured such as being put through a mock firing squad in an effort to make him confess. Eventually, the Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to &#x27;confess to his and the crew&#x27;s transgression.&#x27; Bucher wrote the confession since a &#x27;confession&#x27; by definition needed to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said &quot;We paean the North Korean state. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung&quot; (&quot;&quot;Paean&quot; sounds almost identical to &quot;pee on&quot;&quot;). Following an apology, a written admission by the United States that &quot;Pueblo&quot; had been spying, and an assurance that the United States would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members. On 23 December 1968, the crew was taken by buses to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and ordered to walk south across the &quot;Bridge of No Return&quot;. Exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner, Bucher led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the executive officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge. The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature, which read: &quot;and this hereby receipts for 82 crewmen and one dead body&quot; (Fireman Duane Hodges was killed by North Korean gunfire during the taking of &quot;Pueblo&quot;). Upon release, several members of the crew were crippled and nearly blind as a result of the brutality and malnourishment.

No American military operations have been attempted to retrieve USS &quot;Pueblo&quot;. The ship is still officially carried as in commission in the United States Navy&#x27;s Naval Vessel Register. It remains in North Korea as a tourist attraction.

===Navy court of inquiry===

Following his release, Bucher was subjected to a court of inquiry by the Navy. A court martial was recommended. However, the Secretary of the Navy, John H. Chafee, intervened on Bucher&#x27;s behalf and no action was taken against him. Bucher followed his orders to not start any international incidents, and he felt that while a ship could be replaced, lives could not.

Bucher was not found guilty of any indiscretions and continued his Navy career until retirement in the rank of commander.

In 1970, Bucher published an autobiographical account of the USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident entitled &quot;Bucher: My Story&quot;.

The U.S. government finally recognized the crew&#x27;s sacrifice and granted prisoner-of-war medals to the crew in 1989.

==Death and burial==
Bucher died on January 28, 2004. He was buried at Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery in San Diego, California. The Poway-Bernardo Mortuary, which was featured in the A&amp;E reality TV series &quot;Family Plots&quot; at the time, handled the funeral services. One of the episodes of the series was dedicated to Bucher&#x27;s funeral services.

<text>Love Everybody is the fourth studio album by American rock band the Presidents of the United States of America. It was released on August 17, 2004, on the band&#x27;s own label, PUSA Inc. It was the group&#x27;s final album with Dave Dederer. The band returned to their standard musical style on this album.

When the album was released in the UK, in 2005, it contained four bonus tracks. They included live versions of songs from their debut album, &quot;The Presidents of the United States of America&quot;, the previously unreleased song &quot;Useless Crushes&quot;, and a cover of the Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Problems&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Spokesman-Review&quot; wrote that the album &quot;finds The Presidents comfortably spinning absurdist fun-rock that recalls its super-successful 1995 self-titled debut.&quot; &quot;The Stranger&quot; called the album &quot;vintage Presidents: infectious exuberance, great hooks, and a renewed sense of pop purpose.&quot;

<doc id="927410" wikidata="Q42326778" url="?curid=927410" title="Kake War">
<text>The Kake War was the destruction in February, 1869, of three semi-permanent winter villages and two forts near present-day Kake, Alaska, by the . Prior to the conflict, two white trappers were killed by the Kake in retribution for the death of two Kake departing Sitka village by canoe. Sitka was the site of a standoff between the Army and Tlingit due to the army demanding the surrender of chief Colchika who was involved in an altercation in Fort Sitka.

The loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to several Kake deaths during the winter. The Kake did not rebuild the small villages destroyed. Some dispersed to other villages, while others remained in the vicinity of Kake, eventually rebuilding the present day Kake.

==Background==
Following the Alaska Purchase, the United States Army came to Alaska to serve as the civil administering entity of the Department of Alaska. The U.S. authorities used common law, while the Tlingit people used indigenous law. Americans generally characterized the Tlingit legal framework as based on &quot;revenge&quot;; in actuality, it was more complex and involved &quot;peace ceremonies&quot; which included compensation in either goods or human lives.

==Events leading to war==
On New Year&#x27;s Day 1869, three Tlingit chiefs (Colchika, a Chilkat leader from Haines, Alaska, Kalsteix &quot;Sitka Jack&quot;, and an unidentified chief) were invited to visit Fort Sitka to meet with Jefferson C. Davis. A sentry at the entrance to the fort challenged them, and after they ignored the challenge, kicked Colchika in the buttocks. In the ensuing scuffle, Colchika disarmed the soldier and walked away from the fort with his rifle. Upon hearing of the incident, Davis sent a small detachment to the nearby Sitka village to &quot;bring in the Chilkat chief dead or alive&quot;. A firefight in the village ensued in which a Tlingit slave was killed, and Colchika and four others were wounded. The detachment then retreated as the Tlingit outnumbered them, and Davis proceeded to place Sitka under siege by gunship and fort artillery, demanding the surrender of Colchika. Some Tlingit who attempted to leave Sitka by canoe were killed by gunship fire. After a few days Colchika surrendered to the Army, however, the next morning an army sentry killed two unarmed Tlingit from the Kake tribe who were departing Sitka in a canoe.

A report by secretary of the Board of Indian Commissioners Vincent Colyer and Sitka Mayor William S. Dodge from 1870 attributes the initial altercation in part to serving alcohol to natives, saying Colchika was inebriated at the time with whiskey.

Chief Tom of the Kake tribe demanded compensation for the death, as is customary in Tlingit law, from General Davis, who refused. Failing to receive material compensation, the Kake sought retribution in lives. The Kake captured a party of four trappers on Admiralty Island: two white trappers (Ludwig Madger and William Walker) were put to death at Murder Cove, while two mixed race Tlingit-Russian guides were purposefully set free.

While the army failed to recognize Tlingit law, others recognized the local customs. According to the post trader at Sitka, Frank K. Louthan, &quot;The failure to promptly pay for a real or supposed injury is at once the signal for retaliation, &quot;The Kakes very promptly sought the usual remedy, &#x27;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&#x27;&quot;.

==Destruction of villages and forts==
Upon hearing of the retribution killings, Davis instructed Lieutenant Commander Richard Worsam Meade of the to set sail to the Kake tribal lands, take a few chiefs as hostage until surrender of the accused responsible for the killing, and to burn the villages. The &quot;Saginaw&quot; departed on 11 February 1869.

A Landing party from the &quot;Saginaw&quot; entered the small Fossil Bluffs Village, found it deserted, and the next day set it alight. The next day the &quot;Saginaw&quot; sailed for Hamilton Bay, the site of present-day Kake and at the time a large village named Town Where No One Sleeps. This site was bombarded prior to a landing party putting to shore and setting the village afire after finding it deserted. The next morning the &quot;Saginaw&quot; sailed for Security Bay to a village now known as Retaliation Point Village which was also deserted and put to the torch. Setting sail, the &quot;Saginaw&quot; found two deserted forts with stores and smokehouses which were also destroyed by fire.

According to Kake oral history, recorded in a 1979 interview, one elderly woman stayed in Fossil Bluffs Village and was burned to death.

==Aftermath==
The loss of winter stores, canoes, and shelter led to several Kake deaths during the winter. The Kake did not rebuild the small villages destroyed. Some dispersed to other villages, while others remained in the vicinity of Kake, eventually rebuilding the present day Kake.

Trade with Fort Sitka was reduced substantially in the months following the conflict. The post trader at Sitka, Frank K. Louthan, some five months after the conflict delivered thirteen blankets and one coat, amounting in value to fifty dollar coins, to the Sitka and Chilkat, after the army refused to pay compensation, in order to restore trading relations.

In December, 1869, a similar event at Fort Wrangell in which Tlingit were killed and a white man (Leon Smith) was killed in retribution led to a two-day bombardment of Old Wrangell. However the Stikine surrendered the killer to the army, who following a court-martialing was hung in front of the fort garrison and villagers.

An unexploded Parrott rifle shell was discovered in the 1940s by a Kake resident embedded in a tree stump and kept as a family heirloom for many years before being defused in 2011 and placed on display in the Sealaska Heritage Institute.

==Apology==
In 2024, the US Navy announced that there would be two apologies for wrongful military action, in Kake and in Angoon. Navy Environmental Public Affairs Specialist Julianne Leinenveber stated, “The pain and suffering inflicted upon the Tlingit people warrants this long overdue apology,” and “The Navy will be issuing this apology because it is the right thing to do, regardless of how much time has passed since these tragic events transpired.”

<text>A molecular lesion or point lesion is damage to the structure of a biological molecule such as DNA, RNA, or protein. This damage may result in the reduction or absence of normal function, and in rare cases the gain of a new function. Lesions in DNA may consist of breaks or other changes in chemical structure of the helix, ultimately preventing transcription. Meanwhile, lesions in proteins consist of both broken bonds and improper folding of the amino acid chain. While many nucleic acid lesions are general across DNA and RNA, some are specific to one, such as thymine dimers being found exclusively in DNA. Several cellular repair mechanisms exist, ranging from global to specific, in order to prevent lasting damage resulting from lesions.

== Causes ==
There are two broad causes of nucleic acid lesions, endogenous and exogenous factors. Endogenous factors, or endogeny, refer to the resulting conditions that develop within an organism. This is in contrast with exogenous factors which originate from outside the organism. DNA and RNA lesions caused by endogenous factors generally occur more frequently than damage caused by exogenous ones.

=== Endogenous Factors ===
Endogenous sources of specific DNA damage include pathways like hydrolysis, oxidation, alkylation, mismatch of DNA bases, depurination, depyrimidination, double-strand breaks (DSS), and cytosine deamination. DNA lesions can also naturally occur from the release of specific compounds such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), reactive carbonyl species (RCS), lipid peroxidation products, adducts, and alkylating agents through metabolic processes. ROS is one of the major endogenous sources of DNA damage and the most studied oxidative DNA adduct is 8-oxo-dG. Other adducts known to form are etheno-, propano-, and malondialdehyde-derived DNA adducts. The aldehydes formed from lipid peroxidation also pose another threat to DNA. Proteins such as &quot;damage-up&quot; proteins (DDPs) can promote endogenous DNA lesions by either increasing the amount of reactive oxygen by transmembrane transporters, losing chromosomes by replisome binding, and stalling replication by transcription factors. For RNA lesions specifically, the most abundant types of endogenous damage include oxidation, alkylation, and chlorination. Phagocytic cells produce radical species that include hypochlorous acid (HOCl), nitric oxide (NO•), and peroxynitrite (ONOO−) to fight infections, and many cell types use nitric oxide as a signaling molecule. However, these radical species can also cause the pathways that form RNA lesions.
=== Exogenous Factors ===

==== Ultraviolet Radiation ====
UV light, specifically non-ionizing shorter-wavelength radiation such as UVC and UVB, causes direct DNA damage by initiating a synthesis reaction between two thymine molecules. The resulting dimer is very stable. Although they can be removed through excision repairs, when UV damage is extensive, the entire DNA molecule breaks down and the cell dies. If the damage is not too extensive, precancerous or cancerous cells are created from healthy cells.

==== Chemotherapy drugs ====
Chemotherapeutics, by design, induce DNA damage and are targeted towards rapidly dividing cancer cells. However, these drugs can not tell the difference between sick and healthy cells, resulting in the damage of normal cells.

==== Alkylating agents ====
Alkylating agents are a type of chemotherapeutic drug which keeps the cell from undergoing mitosis by damaging its DNA. They work in all phases of the cell cycle. The use of alkylating agents may result in leukemia due to them being able to target the cells of the bone marrow.

==== Cancer causing agents ====
Carcinogens are known to cause a number of DNA lesions, such as single-strand breaks, double- strand breaks, and covalently bound chemical DNA adducts. Tobacco products are one of the most prevalent cancer-causing agents of today. Other DNA damaging, cancer-causing agents include asbestos, which can cause damage through physical interaction with DNA or by indirectly setting off a reactive oxygen species, excessive nickel exposure, which can repress the DNA damage-repair pathways, aflatoxins, which are found in food, and many more.

== Lesions of Nucleic Acids ==
=== Oxidative lesions ===
Oxidative lesions are an umbrella category of lesions caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), other byproducts of cellular metabolism, and exogenous factors such as ionizing or ultraviolet radiation. Byproducts of oxidative respiration are the main source of reactive species which cause a background level of oxidative lesions in the cell. DNA and RNA are both affected by this, and it has been found that RNA oxidative lesions are more abundant in humans compared to DNA. This may be due to cytoplasmic RNA having closer proximity to the electron transport chain. Known oxidative lesions characterized in DNA and RNA are many in number, as oxidized products are unstable and may resolve quickly. The hydroxyl radical and singlet oxygen are common reactive oxygen species responsible for these lesions. 8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG) is the most abundant and well characterized oxidative lesion, found in both RNA and DNA. Accumulation of 8-oxoG may cause dire damage within the mitochondria and is thought to be a key player in the aging process. RNA oxidation has direct consequences in the production of proteins. mRNA affected by oxidative lesions is still recognized by ribosome, but the ribosome will undergo stalling and dysfunction. This results in proteins having either decreased expression or truncation, leading to aggregation and general dysfunction.

=== Structural rearrangements ===

* Depurination is caused by hydrolysis and results in loss of the purine base of a nucleic acid. DNA is more prone to this, as the transition state in the depurination reaction has much greater energy in RNA.
* Tautomerization is a chemical reaction that is primarily relevant in the behavior of amino acids and nucleic acids. Both of which are correlated to DNA and RNA. The process of tautomerization of DNA bases occurs during DNA replication. The ability for the wrong tautomer of one of the standard nucleic bases to mispair causes a mutation during the process of DNA replication which can be cytotoxic or mutagenic to the cell. These mispairings can result in transition, transversion, frameshift, deletion, and/or duplication mutations. Some diseases that result from tautomerization induced DNA lesions include Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, Kennedy disease, and Huntington&#x27;s disease.
* Cytosine deamination commonly occurs under physiological conditions and essentially is the deamination of cytosine. This process yields uracil as its product, which is not a base pair found within DNA. This process causes extensive DNA damage. The rate of this process is slowed down significantly in double-stranded DNA compared to single-stranded DNA.

=== Single and Double Stranded Breaks ===
Single-strand breaks (SSBs) occur when one strand of the DNA double helix experiences breakage of a single nucleotide accompanied by damaged 5’- and/or 3’-termini at this point. One common source of SSBs is due to oxidative attack by physiological reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide. H2O2 causes SSBs three times more frequently than double-strand breaks (DSBs). Alternative methods of SSB acquisition include direct disintegration of the oxidized sugar or through DNA base-excision repair (BER) of damaged bases. Additionally, cellular enzymes may perform erroneous activity leading to SSBs or DSBs by a variety of mechanisms. One such example would be when the cleavage complex formed by DNA topoisomerase 1 (TOP1) relaxes DNA during transcription and replication through the transient formation of a nick. While TOP1 normally reseals this nick shortly after, these cleavage complexes may collide with RNA or DNA polymerases or be proximal to other lesions, leading to TOP1-linked SSBs or TOP1-linked DSBs.

=== Chemical Adducts ===
A DNA adduct is a segment of DNA that binds to a chemical carcinogen. Some adducts that cause lesions to DNA included oxidatively modified bases, propano-, etheno-, and MDA-induced adducts. 5‐Hydroxymethyluracil is an example of an oxidatively modified base where oxidation of the methyl group of thymine occurs. This adduct interferes with the binding of transcription factors to DNA which can trigger apoptosis or result in deletion mutations. Propano adducts are derived by species generated by lipid peroxidation. For example, HNE is a major toxic product of the process. It regulates the expression of genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis. Some of the aldehydes from lipid peroxidation can be converted to epoxy aldehydes by oxidation reactions. These epoxy aldehydes can damage DNA by producing etheno adducts. An increase in this type of DNA lesion exhibits conditions resulting in oxidative stress which is known to be associated with an increased risk of cancer. Malondialdehyde (MDA) is another highly toxic product from lipid peroxidation and also in the synthesis of prostaglandin. MDA reacts with DNA to form the M1dG adduct which causes DNA lesions.

=== Disease Effects ===
Many systems are in place to repair DNA and RNA lesions but it is possible for lesions to escape these measures. This may lead to mutations or large genome abnormalities, which can threaten the cell or organism&#x27;s ability to live. Several cancers are a result of DNA lesions. Even repair mechanisms to heal the damage may end up causing more damage. Mismatch repair defects, for example, cause instability that predisposes to colorectal and endometrial carcinomas.

DNA lesions in neurons may lead to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer&#x27;s, Huntington&#x27;s, and Parkinson&#x27;s diseases. These come as a result of neurons generally being associated with high mitochondrial respiration and redox species production, which can damage nuclear DNA. Since these cells often cannot be replaced after being damaged, the damage done to them leads to dire consequences. Other disorders stemming from DNA lesions and their association with neurons include but are not limited to Fragile X syndrome, Friedreich&#x27;s ataxia, and Spinocerebellar ataxias.

During replication, usually DNA polymerases are unable to go past the lesioned area, however, some cells are equipped with special polymerases which allow for translesion synthesis (TLS). TLS polymerases allow for the replication of DNA past lesions and risk generating mutations at a high frequency. Common mutations that occur after undergoing this process are point mutations and frameshift mutations. Several diseases come as a result of this process including several cancers and Xeroderma pigmentosum.

The effect of oxidatively damaged RNA has resulted in a number of human diseases and is especially associated with chronic degeneration. This type of damage has been observed in many neurodegenerative diseases such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer&#x27;s, Parkinson&#x27;s, dementia with Lewy bodies, and several prion diseases. It is important to note that this list is rapidly growing and data suggests that RNA oxidation occurs early in the development of these diseases, rather than as an effect of cellular decay. RNA and DNA lesions are both associated with the development of diabetes mellitus type 2.

== Repair Mechanisms ==

=== DNA Damage Response ===
When DNA is damaged such as due to a lesion, a complex signal transduction pathway is activated which is responsible for recognizing the damage and instigating the cell&#x27;s response for repair. Compared to the other lesion repair mechanisms, DDR is the highest level of repair and is employed for the most complex lesions. DDR consists of various pathways, the most common of which are the DDR kinase signaling cascades. These are controlled by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-related kinases (PIKK), and range from DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) and ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) most involved in repairing DSBs to the more versatile Rad3-related (ATR). ATR is crucial to human cell viability, while ATM mutations cause the severe disorder ataxia-telangiectasia leading to neurodegeneration, cancer, and immunodeficiency. These three DDR kinases all recognize damage via protein-protein interactions which localize the kinases to the areas of damage. Next, further protein-protein interactions and posttranslational modifications (PTMs) complete the kinase activation, and a series of phosphorylation events takes place. DDR kinases perform repair regulation at three levels - via PTMs, at the level of chromatin, and at the level of the nucleus.
=== Base Excision Repair ===
Base excision repair (BER) is responsible for removing damaged bases in DNA. This mechanism specifically works on excising small base lesions which do not distort the DNA double helix, in contrast to the nucleotide excision repair pathway which is employed in correcting more prominent distorting lesions. DNA glycosylases initiate BER by both recognizing the faulty or incorrect bases and then removing them, forming AP sites lacking any purine or pyrimidine. AP endonuclease then cleaves the AP site, and the single-strand break is either processed by short-patch BER to replace a single nucleotide long-patch BER to create 2-10 replacement nucleotides.

=== Single Stranded Break Repair ===

Single stranded breaks (SSBs) can severely threaten genetic stability and cell survival if not quickly and properly repaired, so cells have developed fast and efficient SSB repair (SSBR) mechanisms. While global SSBR systems extract SSBs throughout the genome and during interphase, S-phase specific SSBR processes work together with homologous recombination at the replication forks.

=== Double Stranded Break Repair ===
Double stranded breaks (DSB) are a threat to all organisms as they can cause cell death and cancer. They can be caused exogenously as a result of radiation and endogenously from errors in replication or encounters with DNA lesions by the replication fork. DSB repair occurs through a variety of different pathways and mechanisms in order to correctly repair these errors.

=== Nucleotide Excision and Mismatch Repair ===
Nucleotide excision repair  is one of the main mechanisms used to remove bulky adducts from DNA lesions caused by chemotherapy drugs, environmental mutagens, and most importantly UV radiation. This mechanism functions by releasing a short damage containing oligonucleotide from the DNA site, and then that gap is filled in and repaired by NER. NER recognizes a variety of structurally unrelated DNA lesions due to the flexibility of the mechanism itself, as NER is highly sensitive to changes in the DNA helical structure. Bulky adducts seem to trigger NER. The XPC-RAD23-CETN2 heterotrimer involved with NER has a critical role in DNA lesion recognition. In addition to other general lesions in the genome, UV damaged DNA binding protein complex (UV-DDB)  also has an important role in both recognition and repair of UV-induced DNA photolesions.

Mismatch repair (MMR) mechanisms within the cell correct base mispairs that occur during replication using a variety of pathways. It has a high affinity for targeting DNA lesions with specificity, as alternations in base pair stacking that occur at DNA lesion sites affect the helical structure. This is likely one of many signals that triggers MMR.

<doc id="927435" wikidata="Q7145488" url="?curid=927435" title="Patricia Bruder">
<text>Patricia Bruder (born April 14, 1937) is an American actress. She is known for playing the role of Ellen Lowell on the CBS Daytime soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot; (1960 to 1975, 1976 to 1995, 1998).

== Early life ==
Bruder was born in Brooklyn, New York. She decided to become an actress when she was 9 years old, after becoming involved in drama at camp. Her mother began taking her to auditions. She won her first role, singing in the chorus on the radio show &quot;Rainbow House.&quot; She then joined the cast of another radio show, &quot;Juvenile Jury&quot;. When the show transitioned from radio to television, Bruder stayed in the cast. She attended James Madison High School. She enrolled at Columbia University, studying drama.

== Career ==
At the age of 13, Bruder became an understudy for the role of Flora in &quot;The Innocents&quot; on Broadway. When the play launched a tour, she took over the part. In her early career, she was billed as Patsy Bruder. She appeared on television, guest starring on &quot;Robert Montgomery Presents&quot;, &quot;Studio One&quot;, &quot;Suspense&quot;, and &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot;.

Bruder played Elspeth McNairn in the original Broadway cast of &quot;Lace on Her Petticoat&quot;. The play ran from September 4 to November 10, 1951 at the Booth Theatre in New York. She appeared in Off-Broadway productions of &quot;Livin&#x27; the Life&quot; and &quot;The King and the Duke&quot;. Bruder was cast as Marjorie May in the original Broadway cast of &quot;Gypsy&quot;, co-starring with Ethel Merman. The musical ran from May 21, 1959 to March 25, 1961 at the Broadway Theatre in New York.

Her performance in &quot;Gypsy&quot; caught the attention of producers of the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns.&quot; She was cast as Ellen Lowell (later known as Ellen Stewart). Bruder replaced Wendy Drew, an original cast member who had played the role since 1956. Bruder began airing as Ellen in December 1960. The character was paired romantically with Dr. David Stewart (Henderson Forsythe). Bruder left the show for a brief time in 1975, returning in 1976.

During her time on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, she continued to work in theater. In 1961, she appeared Off-Broadway in &quot;The Sap of Life&quot;. In 1977, Bruder produced and starred in &quot;The Miracle Worker&quot;. Her two daughters also appeared in the play. She also had a role in &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot; at New York&#x27;s Theater in the Park. 

In 1995, Bruder was dismissed from her role on &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, but she returned in 1998. She last aired in the role on November 30, 1998. Since leaving &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, she has done voice-over work. Bruder is a member of the New York Society for Ethical Culture and she is a producer for their Ethics and Theater program. On June 17, 2024 she performed the song &quot;Time and Time Again&quot; at a benefit for the American Popular Song Society at New York&#x27;s The Cutting Room. Richard Maltby Jr. and David Shire were receiving a Lifetime Achievement Award and she had originally performed the song in their musical, &quot;The Sap of Life&quot;, in 1961. 

== Personal life ==
In June 1959, she married Dr. Charles Debrovner, a gynecologist. They first met when they were both in high school. They have two daughters, born in 1965 and 1968.

<text>Juliane Schenk (born 26 November 1982) is a German badminton player. In March 2014 she retired from international play.

== Career ==
In 2001, she won the European Junior Championships in women&#x27;s singles. 2003 saw her win the women&#x27;s doubles with Nicole Grether in two tournaments, the Irish International and the Bitburger Open.

Schenk played badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics, losing in women&#x27;s singles to Tracey Hallam of Great Britain in the round of 32. She also won the German championship in the women&#x27;s doubles with Grether for the first time.

She also competed in women&#x27;s doubles with partner Grether. They defeated Michelle Edwards and Chantal Botts of South Africa in the first round but were defeated by Ann-Lou Jørgensen and Rikke Olsen of Denmark in the round of 16.

She won the bronze medal at the 2008 European Badminton Championships.

In 2008, Schenk competed in the Beijing Olympics. She narrowly lost her first round match against Indonesian Maria Kristin Yulianti who later won the bronze medal.

Schenk nearly reached a bronze medal in the World Championship in Hyderabad in women&#x27;s singles but lost to French Pi Hongyan in the final set, 19:21. It would have been another medal for German women after the shared bronze medals of Xu Huaiwen and Petra Overzier in 2006.

In 2010 European Badminton Championships, Schenk beat 1st seed Pi Hongyan to proceed to the final. She settled for silver after losing to Tine Rasmussen in three sets. In 2012 European Badminton Championships, she lost to Baun again in the final. At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she reached the last 16, being beaten by Ratchanok Intanon.

Schenk became an independent professional player in June, having severed ties with the German Badminton Association (DBV). Despite being left in the lurch, Schenk showed great determination to reach the Indonesian Open final in June. She did that with just one training session. In the first inaugural edition of the Indian Badminton League, held from 14 August 2013 to 31 August, Schenk joined Pune Pistons with a reported salary of $90,000.

Schenk also signed a contract with the Xiamen Tefang Badminton Club to compete in the 2013–2014 China Badminton Super League. She was beaten by Sun Yu from Guangzhou Huizhou Weihao 11–8 and 11–5, and later at the end of the year she was beaten by Wang Yihan 12–10, 6–11, 11–6.

In early 2014 in the China Badminton Super League, Schenk was beaten by Wang Shixian representing Jiangsu, 11–5, 11–5. Schenk had announced on her website earlier in the year that she was intent on getting out of the top ten so that she could avoid paying fines for missing Superseries Premier events. She retired the first round in 2014 Malaysia Super Series Premier against Minatsu Mitani and had a walkover to Beiwen Zhang in 2014 All England Super Series Premier. She told the &quot;Rheinische Post&quot; that she would be working as a personal trainer, that she was studying at the University of Cologne, and that she was writing a book.

At the end of April, she lost to Liu Xin in China Badminton League.

<text>Tine Baun (née Rasmussen; born 21 July 1979) is a Danish former badminton player. Most notably, she won the All England Open Badminton Championships women&#x27;s singles title three times in 2008, 2010, and 2013 – the last of these being her final tournament before retirement.

==Career==
Baun started playing badminton at the age of 7. She played at Lynge, a small club in North Zealand, Denmark. She said she really liked traveling around the world and learning other cultures through sports. She made her international debut in 1996 at the Denmark Open, and since finishing her education in 1999, she started playing badminton professionally full time.

At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Baun was eliminated by Petya Nedelcheva in round 32. At the BWF Super Series, she won the 2007 Japan Open, beating all Chinese-born players from the first match, including the 1st seed, Zhang Ning, in the quarterfinal. She also won the 2008 Singapore Super Series, beating Zhou Mi in the final.

She won the silver medal at the 2008 European Badminton Championships after losing to Huaiwen Xu in the final with a rubber set. Baun also played at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing as the 6th seed. She beat Akvile Stapusaityte in the round of 32, but was eliminated after losing to Maria Kristin Yulianti 21–18, 19–21, 14–21 in the round of 16.

Baun claimed three titles in 2009, defending the Malaysia Open title by beating the 1st seed, Zhou Mi in the final, the Korea Open by beating Pi Hongyan, and the Denmark Open by beating the 1st seeded, Wang Yihan. She played in the 2009 All England Super Series as the first seed, reaching the final by beating two younger competitors in the quarterfinal and semi-final. She lost in the final to Wang Yihan, thus losing her title with a score of 19–21, 23–21, 11–21.

Baun won the gold medal at the 2010 European Badminton Championships after beating Juliane Schenk in the final. In the 2012 European Badminton Championships, she defended her title against the same opponent. In 2010 she won a bronze medal at the BWF World Championships held in Paris. She was defeated in the semi-finals by Wang Lin with a score of 11–21, 8–21.

At the 2012 Summer Olympics, she reached the quarter finals, losing to Saina Nehwal of India 2–0. After progressing no further than the quarter finals in the Super Series tournaments of 2012 and 2013, she ended her career high by winning the prestigious All England Open against 18-year-old Ratchanok Intanon of Thailand. It was her third All England title and fourth time reaching the final in that tournament.

After retiring, she joined the Europe All Stars Team to participate in the 2013 Axiata Cup. In the preliminary round, she was defeated by Intanon from Thailand in three sets, scoring 21–9, 13–21, 12–21. In August 2013, Baun played at the Indian Badminton League for the Mumbai Masters team, earning a reported salary of $30,000.

<text>Ernesto Schiaparelli (; 12 July 1856 – 14 February 1928) was an Italian Egyptologist.

==Biography==

Schiaparelli was born on 12 July 1856, in Biella. He found Queen Nefertari&#x27;s tomb in Deir el-Medina in the Valley of the Queens (1904) and excavated the TT8 tomb of the royal architect Kha (1906), found intact and displayed &quot;in toto&quot; in Turin. He was appointed director of the Egyptian Museum in Florence, where he professionally reorganized the collection in new quarters in 1880, then at the peak of his career was made director of the Museo Egizio di Torino, which became with him and his many seasons of excavating, the second biggest Egyptian museum in the world. He was the author of famous scholarly works and a Senator of the Kingdom of Italy. At the same time, he was deeply involved, from his first stay with Franciscan missionaries at Luxor in 1884, with relieving the poverty he saw among the missionaries of Upper Egypt, for whom he founded the Association to Succour Italian Missionaries (ANSMI), which expanded its work to care for Italian emigrants throughout the Near East. Schiaparelli was from a distinguished family of scholars. His father Luigi Schiaparelli taught history at the University of Turin. Giovanni Virginio Schiaparelli, the famous astronomer, , the Arabist, Cesare, the pioneer of photography, Carlo Felice, the agronomist, , a pioneer of industrial chemistry and Elsa Schiaparelli, one of the most prominent figures in fashion between the two World Wars were among his kin.

In 1902, permission to excavate the Western cemetery in Giza was granted by Gaston Maspero, director of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. The area was divided into three sections, and chosen by lot. The southern section was given to the Italians under Ernesto Schiaparelli, the northern strip to the Germans under Ludwig Borchardt, and the middle section to Andrew Reisner.

Between 1903 and 1920, Schiaparelli undertook twelve archaeological campaigns, opening sites in Heliopolis, the cemeteries of Giza, Hermopolis, Assiut, Qaw el-Kebir, Gebelein and Aswan (the tomb of Harkhuf).

<text>Pi Hongyan (; born 25 January 1979) is a former Chinese badminton player, who later represented France.

== Career ==
Pi Hongyan is one of a number of talented Chinese-born badminton players who have emigrated from China, in part, because of the intense competition to gain positions on its national team, and because of the elite status within the sport that such a player is likely to hold in other badminton playing countries. Her titles include women&#x27;s singles at the U.S. (1999), German (2001, 2002), Bitburger (2001, 2002), Portugal (2001, 2003), Swiss (2001, 2005), Croatian (2003), French (2003, 2004, 2005), Dutch (2004), Denmark (2005), Singapore (2006) and India (2009) Opens. At the biennial European Championships she was a silver medalist in 2004 and a bronze medalist in 2008 and 2010. She was runner-up to China&#x27;s Xie Xingfang at the prestigious All-England Championships in 2007. Pi has been at least a quarter-finalist in each of the last six consecutive BWF World Championships (2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011), with a bronze medal in 2009, as well as a quarter-finalist at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.
