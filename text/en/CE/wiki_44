<text>Hugo Münsterberg (; ; June 1, 1863 – December 16, 1916) was a German-American psychologist. He was one of the pioneers in applied psychology, extending his research and theories to industrial/organizational (I/O), legal, medical, clinical, educational and business settings. Münsterberg experienced immense turmoil with the outbreak of the First World War. Torn between his loyalty to the United States and his homeland, he often defended Germany&#x27;s actions, attracting highly contrasting reactions.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hugo Münsterberg was born into a merchant family in Danzig (now Gdansk, Poland), then a port city in West Prussia. Münsterberg&#x27;s family was Jewish, a heritage with which he felt no connection and would barely ever manifest publicly. His father Moritz (1825–1880), was a successful lumber merchant and his mother, Minna Anna Bernhardi (1838–1875), a recognized artist and musician, was Moritz&#x27;s second wife. Moritz had two sons with his first wife, Otto (1854–1915) and Emil (1855–1915), and two with Anna, Hugo (1863–1916) and Oscar (1865–1920). The four sons remained close, and all of them became successful in their careers. A neo-Renaissance villa in Detmold, Germany, that Oscar lived in from 1886 to 1896 has recently been renovated and opened as a cultural center.

The family had a great love of the arts, and Münsterberg was encouraged to explore music, literature, and art. Both his mother and his father died before he was 20 years old. When Münsterberg was 12, his mother died, transforming him from a care-free child to a much more serious young man. In 1880, his father also died.

===Education and career===

Münsterberg had many interests in his early years, including art, literature, poetry, foreign languages, music, and acting. Münsterberg&#x27;s first years of school were spent at the Gymnasium of Danzig from which he graduated in 1882. He entered the University of Leipzig in 1883 where he heard a lecture by Wilhelm Wundt and became interested in psychology. Münsterberg eventually became Wundt&#x27;s research assistant. He received his PhD in physiological psychology in 1885 under Wundt&#x27;s supervision at the age of 22. In 1887, Münsterberg received his medical degree at the University of Heidelberg. He also wrote a third thesis there and met the university&#x27;s other criteria for habilitation enabling him to lecture as a privatdocent. While at Freiburg he started a psychology laboratory and began publishing papers on a number of topics including attentional processes, memory, learning, and perception. In the same year he married a distant cousin, Selma Oppler of Strassburg, on August 7.

In 1889, he was promoted to assistant professorship and attended the First International Congress of psychology where he met William James. They kept up a frequent correspondence and in 1892, James invited him to Harvard for a three-year term as a chair of the psychology lab even though Münsterberg did not speak English at the time. He learned to speak English rather quickly and as a result his classes became very popular with students, in fact he was attracting students from James&#x27;s classes. Part of the responsibilities he assumed as part of his new position at Harvard was that he became the supervisor of the psychology graduate students, in this position directed their dissertation research. As a result, he had a great influence of many students including Mary Whiton Calkins. In 1895 he returned to Freiburg due to uncertainties of settling in the United States. However, because he could not obtain an academic position that he wanted, he wrote James and requested his old position back so that he could return to Harvard, which he did in 1897.. However, he never could separate himself from his homeland.

While at Harvard, Münsterberg&#x27;s career was going very well. He was affiliated with many organizations including the American Psychological Association of which he became president (1898), the American Philosophical Association of which he also became president (1908), the Washington Academy, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was the organizer and vice-president of the International Congress of Arts and Sciences at the Saint Louis World&#x27;s Fair of 1904, vice-president of the International Psychological Congress in Paris in 1900, and vice-president of the International Philosophical Congress at Heidelberg in 1907.

In 1910–1911, he was appointed exchange professor from Harvard to the University of Berlin. During that year, he founded the Amerika-Institut in Berlin. During his whole stay in the United States, he worked for the improvement of the relations between the United States and Germany, writing in the United States for a better understanding of Germany and in Germany for a higher appreciation of the United States.

Because of his work in applied psychology, Münsterberg was well known to the public, academic world, and scientific community. The outspoken views of Münsterberg on the issues of the upcoming First World War raised storms of controversy about his ideals and position. He appeared as probably the most eminent supporter of German policies in the United States and so was at the utmost bitterly condemned by the Triple Entente (a 1907 informal understanding among the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland)
and their friends, but to the pro-Germans, he appeared almost an idol. While supporting German policies, Münsterberg denounced many of the activities of the Teutonic hyphenates in the United States. Fearing a patriotic response to overt support of the German Empire would undermine his own more covert approach, he condemned the forming of an alien party within the United States as &quot;a crime against the spirit of true Americanism&quot; and said that its results would reach far beyond the time of the war.

At his death, the general attitude toward Münsterberg had changed, and his death went relatively unnoticed because of his pro-German attitudes and his support of German policies. He tried to talk about the inaccurate stereotypes held by both the Germans and Americans. He wrote many books and articles attempting to correct them including &quot;The Americans&quot; (1904). In &quot;American Problems&quot; (1910), however, he was highly critical of Americans and said that they had the &quot;general inability to concentrate their attention on any one thing for very long.&quot; As the war approached, Münsterberg&#x27;s support of the supposed efficiency and modernity of the German autocracy caused him to be suspected of being a German spy, and many of his more liberal Harvard colleagues disassociated themselves from him. There were also threats against his life. He remained at Harvard as a professor of experimental psychology and director of the Psychological Laboratory until his sudden death in 1916 from an intracerebral hemorrhage in a lecture at Radcliffe College.

==Scholarship==

===Comparisons to Wundt and James===
One major point of disagreement between Wundt and Münsterberg was their opposing views on how psychology should be practiced. For Wundt psychology should be a pure science detached from practical concerns, while Münsterberg wanted to apply psychological principles that could be applied to practical concerns. While working as Wundt&#x27;s research assistant, Münsterberg studied voluntary activities through introspection, but they disagreed on the fundamental principles. Wundt believed that free will could be experienced as a conscious element of the mind during introspection, while Münsterberg did not. Münsterberg believed that as we prepare to act we consciously experience this bodily preparedness and mistakenly interpret it with the will to act a certain way. Münsterberg&#x27;s beliefs support his interpretation of James&#x27;s ideo-motor theory of behavior. For Münsterberg behavior causes ideas. However, for James ideas cause behavior. There are also similarities between James&#x27;s theory of emotion and Münsterberg&#x27;s analysis of voluntary behavior. For the James-Lange theory of emotion, &quot;emotions are by-products of bodily reactions elicited by a situation.&quot; Whereas for Münsterberg &quot;the feeling of willful actions results from an awareness of covert behavior, or a readiness to act overtly, elicited by a situation.&quot; In both cases, conscious experience is the result of behavior.

In 1900 he published the &quot;Basics of Psychology&quot; which he dedicated to James. Later Münsterberg became unhappy with James&#x27;s liberal attitude towards philosophy and psychology. He was unhappy about James&#x27;s acceptance of Freudian psychoanalysis, psychic phenomena, and religious mysticism into the area of psychology. Münsterberg had said &quot;Mysticism and mediums were one thing, psychology was quite another. Experimental psychology and psychic hocus-pocus did not mix.&quot;

===Experimental psychology===

Münsterberg made numerous contributions to experimental psychology, including discovering a visual illusion that is now named after him.

===Applied psychology===

Over time Münsterberg&#x27;s interests turned to the many practical applications of psychological principles, he felt very strongly that psychologists had the responsibility to uncover information that could then be used in real world applications. In fact he was the first to apply psychological principles to the legal field, creating forensic psychology. He wrote several papers on the application of psychological information in legal situations. The main objective in most of these articles was eyewitness testimony which examined the viability of said witness testimony. He also applied psychological principles to the field of clinical psychology attempting to help those who are ill through a variety of different treatments.

===Forensic psychology===
In 1908, Münsterberg published his controversial book &quot;On the Witness Stand&quot; (1908), which is a collection of magazine articles previously published by him where he discusses the many different psychological factors that can change a trial&#x27;s outcome and pointed the way for rational and scientific means for probing the facts claimed by human witnesses by the application of experimental psychology to the administration of law. He is also credited with being among the first to consider jury research. He says &quot;The lawyer alone is obdurate. The lawyer and the judge and the juryman are sure that they do not need the experimental psychologist... They go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed and somewhat more... Just in the line of the law it therefore seems necessary not to rely simply on the technical statements of scholarly treatises, but to carry the discussion in the most popular form possible before the wider tribunal of the general reader&quot; cementing his position that while the lawyer, judge, and the jurymen are confident in their abilities, that with the use of experimental psychology he can show just how flawed their thinking can really be.

Münsterberg points out the various reasons why eyewitness testimony is inherently unreliable. He describes how eyewitness testimony is inherently susceptible to what he calls &quot;illusions&quot; where a subject&#x27;s perceptions could be affected by the circumstances, making their memory of the events that transpired or testimony inaccurate. He states that with regularity the testimony between two different individuals in the same circumstances can be radically different, even when neither of whom had the slightest interest in changing the facts as remembered. Münsterberg believes this is because memory, when all things are equal, is easily fallible. Because one&#x27;s memory is affected by the associations, judgments, and suggestions that penetrate into every one of one&#x27;s observations and taint our memory and our recollection of events.

Less well known but highly prescient, Münsterberg wrote about &quot;Untrue Confessions.&quot; Appreciating the intuitive credibility of confession evidence in court, he expressed concern that confessions were fallible and speculated as to the psychological causes of false confessions.

Münsterberg conducted many experiments with his normal psychology students in his basic psychology course while at Harvard. He asked them, &quot;without any theoretical introduction, at the beginning of an ordinary lecture, to write down careful answers to a number of questions referring to that which they would see or hear&quot;, and urged them &quot;to do it as conscientiously and carefully as possible.&quot; The procedure went as follows. First he would show them a large sheet of white cardboard with a certain number of black dots on it spread in an irregular order. He exposed it for the students to view for only five seconds, and then asked them how many black dots that they thought were on the sheet. The results were surprising in that even with &quot;highly trained, careful observers, whose attention was concentrated on the material, and who had full time for quiet scrutiny... there were some who believed that they saw seven or eight times more points than some other saw.&quot; He conducted similar experiments that referred to the perception of time, how rapidity is estimated, descriptions of sounds, and other similar experiments with similar results. Based on the results of his experiments, he &quot;warned against the blind confidence in the observations of the average normal man&quot; and concluded that one cannot rely on the accuracy of a normal person&#x27;s memory. He questioned how one could be sure of the testimony of any given witness.

In a portion of the book which he calls &quot;The Detection of Crime&quot; he discusses the many factors that can influence testimony, gain confessions, and force a confession from those who are innocent. Münsterberg states that &quot;brutality is still a favorite method of undermining the mental resistance of the accused.&quot; He discusses some of the ways that police of the time have of making suspects confess to crimes that they had not committed, including making the prisoner&#x27;s life as uncomfortable as possible, to break down his or her energy, and &quot;worst of all giving brutal shocks given with fiendish cruelty to the terrified imagination of the suspect.&quot; He states &quot;that the method is ineffective in bringing out the real truth. At all times, innocent men have been accused by the tortured ones, crimes which were never committed have been confessed, infamous lies have been invented, to satisfy the demands of the torturers.&quot;

For years his groundbreaking work was not given the recognition it deserved in forensic psychology and other fields but more recent scholarship highlights his substantial contribution to these fields.

===Clinical psychology===

Münsterberg was grounded on the theory of psychophysical parallelism which argued that all physical processes had a parallel brain process. He believed that certain mental (neurological) illnesses have a cellular-metabolic causation and diagnosed based on his behavioristic observations of the subject&#x27;s reactions to interviews of them by him. &quot;Psychotherapy&quot; (1909), the book he authored in regard to his investigations of matters of the mind. He defined psychotherapy as &quot;the practice of treating the sick by influencing the mental life... perhaps with drugs and medicines, or with electricity or baths or diet.&quot;

When trying to understand the causes of abnormal behavior, he saw many mentally ill people. Because he was seeing them for scientific reasons, he chose not to charge them for his services and attempted to understand the causes of abnormal behavior. His treatment, which he applied mainly to cases of alcoholism, drug addiction, phobia, and sexual dysfunction, was basically instilling in his patients the idea that they could expect to improve as a result of their efforts. He also employed reciprocal antagonism which is when you strengthen thoughts opposite of the behavior that is causing the problems. Münsterberg did not believe that psychosis could be treated because he believed that was caused by deterioration of the nervous system.

===Industrial psychology===

Münsterberg was an admirer of Frederick Winslow Taylor to whom he wrote in 1913: &quot;Our aim is to sketch the outlines of a new science, which is to intermediate between the modern laboratory psychology and the problem of economics.&quot; Industrial psychology was to be &quot;independent of economic opinions and debatable... interests.&quot; Münsterberg&#x27;s works &quot;Vocation and Learning&quot; (1912) and &quot;Psychology and Industrial Efficiency&quot; (1913) are usually considered the beginning of what would later become known as industrial psychology. His books dealt with many topics including hiring workers who had personalities and mental abilities best suited to certain types of vocations as the best way to increase motivation, performance, and retention, methods of increasing work efficiency, and marketing and advertising techniques. His paper &quot;Psychology and the Market&quot; (1909) suggested that psychology could be used in many different industrial applications including management, vocational decisions, advertising, job performance and employee motivation.

In &quot;Psychology and Industrial Efficiency&quot; (1913) Münsterberg addressed many different topics that are very important to the current field of industrial psychology. His objective was &quot;to sketch the outlines of a new science which is to intermediate between the modern laboratory psychology and the problems of economics: the psychological experiment is systematically to be placed at the service of commerce and industry.&quot; He selects three points of view that he believes are of particular importance to industrial psychology and seeks to answer those questions. These three questions include &quot;how we can find the men whose mental qualities make them best fitted for the work which they have to do; secondly, under what psychological conditions we can secure the greatest and most satisfactory output of work from every man; and finally, how we can produce most completely the influences on human minds which are desired in the interest of business.&quot; In other words, we ask how to find &quot;the best possible man, how to produce the best possible work, and how to secure the best possible effects.&quot;
To Münsterberg the most pressing question was the &quot;selection of those personalities which by their mental qualities are especially fit for a particular kind of economic work.&quot; Basically fitting the person with the correct skill set with the correct position to maximize their productivity, and to select those that have &quot;fit personalities and reject the unfit ones.&quot; He gives many reasons why it&#x27;s difficult to select or place the correct person to any given vocation and says that certain qualities cannot be taken alone to determine a person&#x27;s suitability for a position including their education, training, technical abilities, recommendation of previous employers, personal impressions of the person &quot;the mental dispositions which may still be quite undeveloped and which may unfold only under the influence of special conditions in the surroundings; but, on the other side, it covers the habitual traits of the personality, the features of the individual temperament and character, of the intelligence and of the ability, of the collected knowledge and of the acquired experience. All variations of will and feeling, of perception and thought, of attention and emotion, of memory and imagination.&quot; That in reality having confidence in those prior factors is completely unfounded because he believes that &quot;A threefold difficulty exists. In the first place, young people know very little about themselves and their abilities. When the day comes on which they discover their real strong points and their weaknesses, it is often too late. They have usually been drawn into the current of a particular vocation, and have given too much energy to the preparation for a specific achievement to change the whole life-plan once more. The entire scheme of education gives to the individual little chance to find himself. A mere interest for one or another subject in school is influenced by many accidental circumstances, by the personality of the teacher or the methods of instruction, by suggestions of the surroundings and by home traditions, and accordingly even such a preference gives rather a slight final indication of the individual mental qualities. Moreover, such mere inclinations and interests cannot determine the true psychological fitness for a vocation.&quot;

Münsterberg points out that wandering from one job to another is more common in America and notes that this does have certain advantages including &quot;that a failure in one vocation does not bring with it such a serious injury as in Europe, but it contributes much to the greater danger that any one may jump recklessly and without preparation into any vocational stream.&quot; Therefore, he sought to find a psychologically scientific way of vocational guidance. He describes how two such systems have come to rise in America that attempt to guide young students as they leave school to their chosen vocation, and a newer system marked by a movement toward scientific management in commerce and industry.

This second newer system started in Boston and is essentially a form of career guidance for children. A member of the community would call a meeting of all the neighborhood boys who were to leave elementary school at the end of the year and discuss with them whether they had any reasonable plans for the future. It was clear that the boys knew little of what they wanted to do or what would be expected of them in the real world, and the leader was able to give them, especially in one-one-one conversations, valuable advice. They knew too little of the characteristic features of the vocations to which they wanted to devote themselves, and they had given hardly any attention to the question whether they had the necessary qualifications for the special work. From this experience an office &quot;opened in 1908, in which all Boston children at the time when they left school were to receive individual suggestions with reference to the most reasonable and best adjusted selection of a calling. There is hardly any doubt that the remarkable success of this modest beginning was dependent upon the admirable personality of the late organizer, who recognized the individual features with unusual tact and acumen. But he himself had no doubt that such a merely impressionistic method could not satisfy the demands.&quot; Münsterberg identified three main reasons why this worked: first, because they analyzed the objective relations of the hundreds of different accessible vocations, as well as, the children&#x27;s economic, hygienic, technical, and social elements that should be examined so that every child could receive valuable information as to the demands of the vocation and what opportunities could be found within that vocation. Second, that the schools would have to be interested in the question of vocational choice so that observations of an individual child could be made about their abilities and interests. And finally, what he believed to be the most important point, &quot;the methods had to be elaborated in such a way that the personal traits and dispositions might be discovered with much greater exactitude and with much richer detail than was possible through what a mere call on the vocational counselor could unveil.&quot; Münsterberg believes that these early vocational counselors point towards the spirit of the modern tendency toward applied psychology, and that the goal can only be reached through exact, scientific, experimental research, &quot;and that the mere naïve methods—for instance, the filling-out of questionnaires which may be quite useful in the first approach—cannot be sufficient for a real, persistent furtherance of economic life and of the masses who seek their vocations.&quot;

The question of selecting the best possible man for a particular vocation for Münsterberg comes down to making the process very scientific, trying to create tests that limit the subjectivity that is possible through more traditional techniques of introspection, and instead using measurements of one&#x27;s personality, intelligence and other inherent personality traits to try to find the best possible job for every individual.

Münsterberg also explored under what psychological conditions that an employer can secure the most and highest quality output of work from every employee by looking at the effects of changing the work space environment, what can possibly effect workers production, problems of monotony in factory and other vocations that involve tedious repeated tasks and how to avoid these situation, studied attention and fatigue in the workplace, and the Physical and social influences on the working power.

Finally investigating how a company can secure the best possible effects in terms of sales. Münsterberg talks about ways to study the satisfaction of economic demands, experiments with discovering the effectiveness of advertisements, the psychology of buying and selling, and in the end discusses the future development of economic psychology.

==Women and education==
Münsterberg&#x27;s views on women were shaped by his views on biology. Though he firmly believed that women should receive where possible, a higher education, he felt that graduate studies were too difficult and demanding for them. As well, he suggested that women should not be allowed to serve on juries because they were &quot;incapable of rational deliberation&quot;.

==Contributions to film theory==
Both Dudley Andrew and James Monaco count Münsterberg&#x27;s book &quot;The Photoplay: A Psychological Study&quot; as one of the early examples of film theory.

==Spiritualism==

Though he believed in God and life after death, Münsterberg was throughout his career a committed opponent of parapsychology: the field of study concerned with the investigation of paranormal and psychic phenomena. He had a &quot;great record of exposing mediums and other psychic charlatans&quot;.
A notable episode in this facet of his career involved his exposure of the fraudulent spiritualist medium Eusapia Palladino. The exposure was included in the chapter &quot;My Friends, the Spiritualists&quot; in his book &quot;American Problems from the Point of View of a Psychologist&quot; (1910). Author Daniel Cohen noted that &quot;[Palladino] was undaunted by Münsterberg&#x27;s exposure. Her tricks had been exposed many times before, yet she had prospered.&quot; The exposure was not taken seriously by Palladino&#x27;s defenders. It was heavily criticized by Hereward Carrington and Théodore Flournoy.

On 18 December 1909, in New York, with the help of a hidden man lying under a table, Münsterberg caught Palladino levitating a table with her foot. Some investigators were originally baffled how Palladino could move curtains from a distance when all the doors and windows in the séance room were closed. According to Münsterberg she moved the curtains by releasing a jet of air from a rubber bulb that she had in her hand.

==Students==
Münsterberg was an academic mentor to William Moulton Marston, creator of Wonder Woman.

<text>Nutrient sensing is a cell&#x27;s ability to recognize and respond to fuel substrates such as glucose. Each type of fuel used by the cell requires an alternate pathway of utilization and accessory molecules such as enzymes and cofactors. In order to conserve resources a cell will only produce molecules that it needs at the time. The level and type of fuel that is available to a cell will determine the type of enzymes it needs to express from its genome for utilization. Receptors on the cell membrane&#x27;s surface designed to be activated in the presence of specific fuel molecules communicate to the cell nucleus via a means of cascading interactions. Nutrient receptors are receptors that are primarily designed to perform the function of nutrient sensing, whereas other receptors (e.g. insulin receptors, leptin receptors) are extensively multifunctional and perform many functions besides nutrient sensing. In this way the cell is aware of the available nutrients and is able to produce only the molecules specific to that nutrient type.

==Nutrient sensing in mammalian cells==

A rapid and efficient response to disturbances in nutrient levels is crucial for the survival of organisms from bacteria to humans. Cells have therefore evolved a host of molecular pathways that can sense nutrient concentrations and quickly regulate gene expression and protein modification to respond to any changes.

Cell growth is regulated by coordination of both extracellular nutrients and intracellular metabolite concentrations. AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 serve as key molecules that sense cellular energy and nutrients levels, respectively.
*The interplay among nutrients, metabolites, gene expression, and protein modification are involved in the coordination of cell growth with extracellular and intracellular conditions.

Living cells use ATP as the most important direct energy source. Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP and phosphate (or AMP and pyrophosphate) provides energy for most biological processes. The ratio of ATP to ADP and AMP is a barometer of cellular energy status and is therefore tightly monitored by the cell. In eukaryotic cells, AMPK serves as a key cellular energy sensor and a master regulator of metabolism to maintain energy homeostasis.

==Nutrient sensing and epigenetics==

Nutrient sensing and signaling is a key regulator of epigenetic machinery in cancer. During glucose shortage, the energy sensor AMPK activates arginine methyltransferase CARM1 and mediates histone H3 hypermethylation (H3R17me2), leading to enhanced autophagy. In addition, &quot;O&quot;-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) signals glucose availability to TET3 and inhibits TET3 by both decreasing its dioxygenase activity and promoting its nuclear export. OGT is also known to directly modify histones with &quot;O&quot;-GlcNAc. These observations strongly suggest that nutrient signaling directly targets epigenetic enzymes to control epigenetic modifications.

==Regulation of tissue growth==

Nutrient sensing is a key regulator of tissue growth. The main mediator of cellular nutrient sensing is the protein kinase TOR (target of rapamycin). TOR receives information from levels of cellular amino acids and energy, and it regulates the activity of processes involved in cell growth, such as protein synthesis and autophagy. Insulin-like signaling is the main mechanism of systemic nutrient sensing and mediates its growth-regulatory functions largely through the protein kinase pathway. Other nutrition-regulated hormonal mechanisms contribute to growth control of modulating the activity of insulin-like signaling.

==Nutrient sensing in plants==

Higher plants require a number of essential nutrient elements for completing their life cycles. Mineral nutrients are mainly acquired by roots from the rhizosphere and are subsequently distributed to shoots. To overcome with nutrient limitations, plants have evolved a set of elaborate responses consisting of sensing mechanisms and signaling processes to perceive and adapt to external nutrient availability.

Plants obtain most necessary nutrients by taking them up from the soil into their roots. Although plants cannot move to a new environment when nutrient availability is less than favorable, they can modify their development to favor root colonization of soil areas where nutrients are abundant. Therefore, plants perceive the availability of external nutrients, like nitrogen, and couple this nutrient sensing to an appropriate adaptive response.

===Types of nutrients in plants===

Potassium (K+) and phosphorus (P+) are important macronutrients for crops but are often deficient in the field. Very little is known about how plants sense fluctuations in concentrations of K+ and P+, and how such sensing is integrated at the organismic level into physiological and metabolic adaptations. Smaller amounts of other micronutrients are also important for the growth of the crop. All of these nutrients are equally important for the growth of the plant and lack of one nutrient can result in poor growth of the plant as well as becoming more vulnerable to diseases or can lead to death. These nutrients along with and energy from the sun aids in the development of the plant.

===Nitrogen sensing===
As one of the most vital nutrients for the development and growth of all plants, nitrogen sensing and the signalling response are vital for plants to live. Plants absorb nitrogen through the soil in the form of either nitrate or ammonia. In soil with low oxygen levels, ammonia is the primary nitrogen source, but toxicity is carefully controlled for with the transcription of ammonium transporters (AMTs). This metabolite and others including glutamate and glutamine have been shown to act as a signal of low nitrogen through regulation of nitrogen transporter gene transcription. NRT1.1, also known as CHL1, is the nitrate transceptor (transporter and receptor) found on the plasma membrane of plants. This is both a high and low affinity transceptor that senses varying concentrations of nitrate depending on its T101 residue phosphorylation. It has been shown that nitrate can also act as just a signal for plants, since mutants unable to metabolize are still able to sense the ion. For example, many plants show the increase of nitrate-regulated genes in low nitrate conditions and consistent mRNA transcription of such genes in soil high in nitrate. This demonstrates the ability to sense nitrate soil concentrations without metabolic products of nitrate and still exhibit downstream genetic effects.

=== Potassium Sensing ===
Potassium (K+), one of the essential macronutrients is found in plant soil. K+ is the most abundant cation and it is very limited in plant soil. Plants absorb K+ from the soil through channels that are found at the plasma membrane of root cells. Potassium is not assimilated into organic matter like other nutrients such as nitrate and ammonium but serves as a major osmoticum.

==Brain and gut regulation of food intake==

Maintaining a careful balance between stored energy and caloric intake is important to ensure that the body has enough energy to maintain itself, grow, and engage in activity. When balanced improperly, obesity and its accompanying disorders can result.

<text>Meg Heather Lees (née Francis, born 19 October 1948) is a former member of the Australian Senate from 1990 to 2005, representing the state of South Australia. She represented the Australian Democrats from 1990 to 2002, and was her party&#x27;s leader from 1997 to 2001. After being deposed by Natasha Stott Despoja, she quit the party to sit as an independent senator in 2002, adopting the party designation Australian Progressive Alliance from 2003 until her electoral defeat in 2005. As party leader, she controversially facilitated passage of the Howard government&#x27;s Goods and Services Tax (GST).

==Family life==
Lees was born in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney. She became a teacher at Ingleburn High School and married Keith Lees, a fellow teacher, in about 1971. In 1974 they moved to Mount Gambier, where their two daughters were born. After both Keith and Meg became involved in the Australian Democrats, they moved to Adelaide, but the pressures of political activity led to the breakdown of their marriage. On Christmas Eve 2000, shortly before she was deposed as the Democrats&#x27; leader in the Senate, Lees married Adelaide lawyer Matthew Mitchell.

==Leadership of the Australian Democrats==

Cheryl Kernot defected to the Australian Labor Party in October 1997, and Lees was called upon to stand in as acting leader. She was officially chosen as Kernot&#x27;s replacement in December, with Natasha Stott Despoja becoming her deputy.

During her time as leader, the Democrats strengthened the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Act, improved the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, negotiated the GST tax reform and maintained the general oversight role of the Democrats in the Senate through a number of Senate inquiries.

In 1999, Prime Minister John Howard proposed the idea of a Goods and Services Tax. It was opposed by the Labor Party, the Australian Greens and independent Senator Brian Harradine, which meant that it required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package nor the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan &quot;No GST on food&quot;. A majority of the senators in the party room agreed to pass the bill if some amendments were made, mostly to exclude fresh food and essential items such as basic medicines. Stott Despoja stated that she was unhappy with the outcome, particularly the GST on books. Both Stott Despoja and Queensland Senator Andrew Bartlett ultimately crossed the floor to vote against the GST package.

However, a significant number of Democrat members remained unhappy with the GST deal, and began to agitate for a change in leadership. Under the Democrat constitution, a petition of 100 members can trigger a leadership ballot of all the members. On the initial ballot, Meg Lees was returned unchallenged. Subsequently, the Democrats faced a decline in the polls which, by April 2001, were indicating that several senators would lose their seats at the elections due for later that year. The members agitated again for a leadership ballot and, this time, Stott Despoja announced her intention to challenge Lees for the leadership, and was successful, replacing her on 6 April 2001.

In mid-2002, Lees began vocally opposing Stott Despoja&#x27;s leadership, claiming that it had moved the party too far to the left. This culminated in Lees leaving the party to sit as an independent in July 2002.

==Australian Progressive Alliance==
In April 2003 Lees announced the founding of the Australian Progressive Alliance, which she claimed would have a more centrist view than the Democrats. However, she was defeated at the October 2004 election and her term expired on 30 June 2005.

<text>Charles Edward Munroe (May 24, 1849 – December 7, 1938) was an American chemist, discoverer of the Munroe effect, and chair of the department of chemistry at the George Washington University.

He was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts and studied at the Lawrence scientific school of Harvard, graduating in 1871. He then took a job as an assistant professor of chemistry at the college until 1874, when he moved to Annapolis to become a professor of chemistry at the United States Naval Academy.

In 1886, he joined the Naval Torpedo Station and War College at Newport, Rhode Island as a chemist, where he discovered the Munroe effect, the basis for explosive shaped charges. From 1892–1917 Munroe was head of the department of chemistry and dean of the Corcoran Scientific School at the Columbian University (renamed George Washington University in 1904). During the same time period, he was also the dean of the faculty of graduate studies and earned a Ph.D. in 1894 and LL.D in 1912 from the university. In 1898, he aided in the investigation of the 1898 Capitol Gas Explosion, serving as an explosives expert to determine the cause of the accident. In 1919 he became dean emeritus of the school of graduate studies and professor emeritus of chemistry, roles he kept until he died. He wrote over 100 books on explosives and chemistry, and was appointed in 1900 by the Swedish Academy of Science to nominate the candidate for the Nobel Prize in chemistry. In addition, Munroe served as president of the American Chemical Society in 1898 and as a consultant to the United States Geological Survey and the United States Bureau of Mines. He was an elected member of both the American Philosophical Society and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<text>Burkhard Christoph Graf von Münnich (; – ) was a German-born army officer who became a field marshal and political figure in the Russian Empire.

He carried out major reforms in the Russian Army and founded several elite military formations during the reign of Empress Anna of Russia (). As a statesman, he is widely regarded as the founder of Russian philhellenism. Like his father, Münnich was an engineer and a specialist in hydrotechnology.

==Early career==
Münnich was born at Neuenhuntorf in the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg in the military family of Anton Günther Mönnich (since 1688 &quot;von Münnich&quot;, an east-Frisian nobility). Besides the knowledge of the native Low German language he also learned the Latin and French languages. He entered the French service at 17. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of Hesse-Darmstadt and of Saxony where he earned the rank of colonel and later major general.

In 1721, he was invited by the Russian ambassador in Warsaw, Alexey Grigoryevich Dolgorukov, for engineering projects of the newly acquired northern territories. Around that time his father has died. Upon arrival to Russia he presented Peter I plans for the fortification of Kronstadt fortress, which pleasantly surprised the Russian emperor, and the Annenkrone fortification in Vyborg. He was promoted to Lieutenant General in 1722. Among his first undertakings was the completion of the costly Ladoga Canal, which had been under construction for more than a decade. For his engineering and military-engineering achievements he was promoted to the rank of the General-in-Chief, in 1726 by Catherine I, and awarded the Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky. In 1727, Münnich was appointed the Governor of Saint Petersburg city while the Imperial court was temporarily transferred to Moscow by Peter II. From 1728 to 1734, he was a General-Governor of Ingria, Karelia, and Finland as well as was awarded the title of a count. During his governorship, Münnich improved the local ports, reinforced the newly established Peter and Paul Fortress (1703), and was thinking of building a bridge towards Stockholm.

==Russian army reformer==
Upon the coronation of Anna of Russia (1730), he was instructed to prepare the city for the return of Imperial court. After successfully accomplishing that Münnich was promoted to a General-Fieldmarshal, was appointed to the position of president of Russian War Collegiate in 1732 as well as given an order to re-organize the Russian army. Münnich became a founder of the Russian Imperial Guard, known as Leib-Guard Cavalry Regiment of the Izmaylovsky Regiment, and the Shlyakhetskiy Cadet Corps which was destined to supply the future generations of officers. 

Münnich also reformed numerous other military formations as well as the War Collegiate itself. He established a new formation for the Russian army at that time, the Corps which consisted of 12 regiments Cuirassier Cavalry as well as the first Hussar regiments. Münnich revised the table of ranks and evened the salary of the Russian officers with the invited foreign military specialists. He was the first to introduce the sapper regiments to the Russian army as well as founded the Engineer School for Officers. During his administration some 50 other fortresses were erected which substantially improved the well-being of the Russian Armed Forces at that time. Due to the Andrey Osterman affairs, he was released of his duties.

==Ottoman campaign of 1734–1739==
In 1734, by the reference of Ernst Johann von Biron he was sent to take the city of Danzig (Gdańsk) and after a prolonged siege and evasion of Stanisław Leszczyński was heavily reproached. However, after that in 1733, the Russian Empire was able to install Augustus III of Poland as the King of Poland (ratified in 1736).

In 1736, as the commander of the Russian army, he headed the Turkish campaigns, besieging the important ports of Azak (modern Azov) and Özi. On 21 May 1735, he sacked Or Qapı fortress, then continued into the Crimean Peninsula. Münnich destroyed the important Tatar cities of Kezlev, Aqmescit, and Bakhchisaray. He was forced out of the peninsula due to poor logistics and battle fatigue of his formations, while another general, Count Peter von Lacy, took Azak, earning himself a rank of the general field marshal. Münnich refused to resume the campaign the very next year, but he returned to the lower Dnieper steppes in 1737, and on 2 July, took the fortress of Özi with the help of the Russian artillery. During the sack of Özi, he manually raised the regimental banner of the Izmailovsky Regiment on one of the towers of fortress after a successful attack. The siege of Özi was also later mentioned in the humorous stories about Baron Munchausen, based on the adventures of the page to Duke Anthony Ulrich of Brunswick, Hieronymus von Münchhausen. Due to the heavy losses, the campaign was paused again while conducting negotiations in Nemirov (Podolie) without much result. 

In 1739, Münnich won the Battle of Stavuchany on , took Khotyn on , and entered Iași on , establishing himself firmly in the Principality of Moldavia. Threatening to burn down the capital of that Principality, the city of Iași, he forced Moldavian boyars to accept the annexation of Moldavia on . Due to military losses of the Habsburg monarchy and worsening of political relationships with Sweden, the Russian court accepted French mediation and signed the Treaty of Niš (October 3) by which Russia had to return almost all captured territories, including those gained by Münnich in Moldavia. He was ordered to evacuate those regions, and return to Russia. Münnich&#x27;s victories in the Moldavian campaign was later mentioned in one of the Lomonosov&#x27;s odes, considered to be the first poem of that kind in Russian literature. After the Ottoman war he was awarded the Order of St. Andrew and the Golden Weapon for Courage.

== Downfall ==
Marshal Münnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with Biron, duke of Courland, whom Münnich had arrested in 1740.
Münnich&#x27;s activity was brought to a close in 1741 by the Elizabeth of Russia; he was arrested on his way to the border, and condemned to death. Brought out for execution, and withdrawn from the scaffold, he was later sent to Pelym, Siberia, where he remained for several years, until the accession of Peter III brought about his release in 1762. 

Catherine II, who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field marshal as director-general of the Baltic ports.
Münnich died four years later in Tartu and was buried at his estate nearby.

== Legacy ==

Catherine the Great will say of him &quot;If Münnich is not one of the children of Russia, he is one of the fathers&quot;. Frederick the Great professes great admiration for his exploits and calls him &quot;Prince Eugene of the Muscovites&quot;. Voltaire wrote for his part: &quot;It was Prince Eugene of the Muscovites; he had the virtues and vices of the great generals: skilful, enterprising, happy; but proud, superb, ambitious, and sometimes too despotic, and sacrificing the lives of his soldiers for his reputation. Franz Lacy, Keith, Löwendal, and other skilful generals, were training in his school&quot;.

According to Hermann von Manstein, his aide-de-camp: &quot;The Count of Münnich is a real contrast of good and bad qualities. Polite, rude, human, carried away, in turn, nothing is easier for him than winning the hearts of those who deal with him. But suddenly, an instant later, he treats them so harshly that they are forced to hate him, so to speak. In certain conditions, we saw him generous, in others of a sordid greed. He is the man of the world who has the highest soul and yet we have seen him do mean things. Pride is a dominant vice. Constantly devoured by an excessive ambition, he sacrificed everything to the world to satisfy it. One of the best engineers in Europe, he was also one of the greatest captains of his century. Often reckless in his businesses, he has always ignored what the impossible is. With a tall and imposing stature, and a robust and vigorous temperament, he seems to have been born general.&quot;

Ernst Gideon von Laudon and Franz Lacy did their apprenticeship under his orders in front of Otchakov and Khotin.

Burckhardt de Münnich is buried in his land of Lunia in Livonia. Despite his role as builder of modern Russia, his tomb was desecrated and partly destroyed by the Soviets.

The Imperial Russia 37th Dragoons Regiment used to bear his name.

<text>Leonard William Harris (born 22 September 1943) is an Australian politician who was a One Nation Senator representing the state of Queensland from 1999 until 2005. He took his seat in September 1999, after a successful challenge to the election in October 1998 of Heather Hill, on the basis that, although a naturalised Australian, she had not renounced her childhood United Kingdom citizenship and was thus ineligible to sit in the Australian Parliament.

==Political career==
Harris was born in Brisbane and was a self-employed businessman and gold miner. Prior to being chosen as the number two Senate candidate for One Nation at the 1998 election, he was an unsuccessful candidate at the 1997 Australian Constitutional Convention election, running as an ungrouped candidate on the &quot;Retention of the Existing Constitution&quot; ticket.
He came briefly to prominence during the 2003 debate on the legislative reforms to tertiary education, proposed by federal Education Minister Brendan Nelson. After initially indicating he would vote against the legislation, Harris later changed his mind and allowed the reform package to pass, much to the annoyance of student organisations.

By the time of the 2004 election One Nation was seriously in decline, and Harris was expected to struggle to retain his seat. With a drastic fall in the One Nation vote nationally, he lost his seat, polling only 0.2 of a quota. His term expired on 30 June 2005.

<doc id="917314" wikidata="Q5040098" url="?curid=917314" title="Carl Epting Mundy Jr.">
<text>Carl Epting Mundy Jr. (July 16, 1935 – April 2, 2014) was a United States Marine Corps four-star general who served as the 30th Commandant of the Marine Corps and a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from July 1, 1991, until his retirement on June 30, 1995, after 42 years of service. He was notable for his opposition to military service by gay people and for helping to shape the military&#x27;s &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; policy of 1993.

From 1996 to 2000, Mundy served as president and CEO of the United Service Organizations. He was also the chairman of the Marine Corps University Foundation, and served on a number of corporate boards.

==Early life and education==
Mundy was born on July 16, 1935, in Atlanta, Georgia. His family moved frequently when he was a young child, settling in Waynesville, North Carolina, when Mundy was about 10 years old. He graduated from Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery, Alabama. At age 18, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve.

==Marine career==
Mundy enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve and enrolled in the Platoon Leaders Class Program in December 1953 while attending college – serving in the 38th Special Infantry Company, Montgomery, Alabama, and rising to the rank of sergeant. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in June 1957, following graduation from Auburn University. His later military education included the Command and General Staff College and the Naval War College.

Mundy&#x27;s early assignments included service in the 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division; duty aboard the aircraft carrier and the cruiser ; instructor at The Basic School; and as Officer Selection Officer, Raleigh, North Carolina. In 1966–67, Mundy served in Vietnam as operations and executive officer of the 3rd Battalion, 26th Marines, 3rd Marine Division, and as an intelligence officer in the Headquarters, III Marine Amphibious Force.

After the Vietnam War, Mundy&#x27;s principal assignments were:
*Aide de Camp to the Assistant Commandant of the Marine Corps
*Inspector &amp; Instructor, 4th Air-Naval Gunfire Liaison Company, Miami, Florida
*Commanding Officer, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines, 3rd Marine Division. 
*Plans Officer, Headquarters Marine Corps
*Assistant Chief of Staff for Intelligence, 2nd Marine Division
*Chief of Staff, Sixth Marine Amphibious Brigade
*Commanding Officer, 2nd Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division from 27 March 1981 - 30 April 1982 and 36th and 38th Marine Amphibious Units.

Following advancement to brigadier general in April 1982, Mundy&#x27;s assignments were:
*Director of Personnel Procurement, Headquarters Marine Corps
*Commanding General, Landing Force Training Command, United States Atlantic Fleet, and Commanding General, 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade. In late February and early March 1986, 2nd/4th Marines deployed to Nordland and Troms counties of Norway, near Evenes and Brøstadbotn, as the main US ski-mobile maneuver element of the 4th Marine Amphibious Brigade commanded by then Brigadier General Carl E. Mundy Jr., taking a leading role in the multi-national NATO winter exercise, &quot;Anchor Express&quot;. The wintry, subfreezing weather, unprecedented level of snow, and the rugged terrain in the operating area of &quot;Anchor Express&quot; astride Salangenfjord, Faksfjorden and Lavangenfjord tested 2/4&#x27;s ski-borne Marines to their limits. Such was the deep snow, extremely steep mountains in fjord country and gusty subzero winds that on 5 March 1986, a devastating avalanche in Vassdalen, Nordland, struck 31 fellow-Norwegian soldiers, killing sixteen engineers from the elite Norwegian Army unit Brigade North, many of whose soldiers operating with 2/4 during the exercise. The Vassdalen avalanche was Norway&#x27;s worst disaster involving the military since the German invasion of Norway (1940). As a result, Norway went into mourning and the force-on-force exercise prematurely ended.
*Advanced to Major General in April 1986
*Director of Operations, Plans, Policies and Operations Department, Headquarters Marine Corps
*Advanced to Lieutenant General in March 1988
*Deputy Chief of Staff for Plans, Policies and Operations, Headquarters Marine Corps; Operations Deputy to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
*Commanding General of the Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic, the II Marine Expeditionary Force, the Allied Command Atlantic Marine Striking Force, and designated to command Fleet Marine Forces which might be employed in Europe
*Promoted to General on July 1, 1991
*Commandant of the Marine Corps from July 1, 1991, to June 30, 1995

===Remarks on minority officers===
In an October 31, 1993, segment on the CBS program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on the dearth of minority promotions in the U.S. Marine Corps, General Mundy was quoted as saying, &quot;In the military skills, we find that the minority officers do not shoot as well as the non-minorities. They don&#x27;t swim as well. And when you give them a compass and send them across the terrain at night in a land navigation exercise, they don&#x27;t do as well at that sort of thing.&quot; Mundy, noted for being blunt, though possibly the &quot;victim of selective editing&quot;, apologized for &quot;any offense that may have been taken&quot; from his remarks. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, the general elaborated on this question at a 1993 commemoration of the Battle of Iwo Jima, when commenting on Ira Hayes, he said &quot;Were Ira Hayes here today ... I would tell him that although my words on another occasion have given the impression that I believe some Marines ... because of their color ... are not as capable as other Marines ... that those were not the thoughts of my mind ... and that they are not the thoughts of my heart.

===Position on married Marines===
Mundy issued an order in 1993 to cut down (and eventually eliminate) the recruitment category for married Marines; the order was rescinded following a public outcry.

===Opposition to gay people serving in the military===
Mundy was an outspoken opponent of allowing gay people to serve in the military. As a compromise with others who were less strongly opposed, Mundy shaped the &quot;Don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; (DADT) policy, a 1993 law stating that self-identified homosexuals are not eligible for military service. Mundy distributed copies of &quot;The Gay Agenda&quot;, a 1992 video asserting that homosexuality is an unnatural sickness, to the other members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in an effort to persuade them. In a January 1993 meeting with President Clinton and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mundy said that those who admit to being gay or who associate with Gay Pride &quot;will have a negative effect&quot; and that it &quot;fractures teamwork.&quot; For a person to &quot;proclaim: I&#x27;m gay&quot; is the &quot;same as I&#x27;m KKK, Nazi, rapist.&quot;

Mundy was signatory to an open letter delivered to President Barack Obama and Members of Congress expressing continued support for DADT. The letter said in part, &quot;We believe that imposing this burden on our men and women in uniform would undermine recruiting and retention, impact leadership at all echelons, have adverse effects on the willingness of parents who lend their sons and daughters to military service, and eventually break the All-Volunteer Force.&quot; However unlike the 34th commandant, General James T. Conway, Mundy has said that if the restriction were repealed the troops should not be segregated.

==Awards and decorations==
Mundy&#x27;s awards include: 

*Mundy also held several awards of both the Rifle and Pistol Expert Badges.
*Note: The gold US Navy Parachute Rigger badge was worn unofficially by USMC personnel in place of US Army parachutist badge from 1942 to 1963 before it officially became the Navy and Marine Corps Parachutist insignia on July 12, 1963, per BuPers Notice 1020. Members of the Marine Corps who attended jump school before 1963 were issued the silver Army parachutist badge but may be depicted wearing the gold Navy Parachute Rigger badge as it was common practice during this time period.

==Personal life==

Mundy was married and had three children – two sons and a daughter. Both sons were United States Marine Corps officers. One, Carl E. Mundy III, is a retired Marine Corps lieutenant general.

==Death==
Mundy died of Merkel cell carcinoma at his home in Alexandria, Virginia, on April 2, 2014, at the age of 78. A memorial service was held for Mundy on April 12 at the Marine Corps War Memorial in Arlington, Virginia. His funeral and burial service, at First United Methodist Church and Greenhill Cemetery respectively, were held on April 19 in Waynesville, North Carolina.

<text>Theodor Mundt (September 19, 1808 – November 30, 1861) was a German critic and novelist. He was a member of the Young Germany group of German writers.

==Biography==
Born at Potsdam, Mundt studied philology and philosophy at Berlin. In 1832 he settled at Leipzig as a journalist, where he co-edited &quot;Blätter für litterarische Unterhaltung&quot;, and where he was subjected to a rigorous police supervision. In 1839 he married Klara Müller (1814–1873), who under the name of Luise Mühlbach became a popular novelist, and he moved in the same year to Berlin. Here his intention of entering upon an academical career was for a time thwarted by his collision with the Prussian press laws. In 1842, however, he was permitted to establish himself as &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. In 1848 he was appointed Professor of Literature and History in Breslau, and in 1850 ordinary professor and librarian in Berlin, where he died.

==Works==
Mundt wrote extensively on aesthetic subjects, and as a critic he had considerable influence in his time. Prominent among his works are &quot;Die Kunst der deutschen Prosa&quot; (1837); &quot;Geschichte der Literatur der Gegenwart&quot; (1840); &quot;Aesthetik, die Idee der Schönheit und des Kunstwerks im Lichte unserer Zeit&quot; (1845, new ed. 1868); &quot;Die Götterwelt der alten Völker&quot; (1846, new ed. 1854). He also wrote several historical novels such as &quot;Thomas Münzer&quot; (1841); &quot;Mendoza&quot; (1847); and &quot;Die Matadore&quot; (1850). With Karl August Varnhagen von Ense, he edited Karl Ludwig von Knebel&#x27;s letters and posthumous works. But perhaps Mundt&#x27;s chief title to fame was his part in the emancipation of women, a theme which he elaborated in &quot;Madonna, Unterhaltungen mit einer Heiligen&quot; (1835).

<text>Karl Earl Mundt (June 3, 1900August 16, 1974) was an American educator and a Republican member of the United States Congress, representing South Dakota in the United States House of Representatives (1939–1948) and in the United States Senate (1948–1973).

==Biography==

Mundt was born in Humboldt, South Dakota. He was the son of Ferdinand John Mundt (1875–1947) and Rose (Schneider) Mundt (1874–1965). Both of his parents were the descendants of German immigrants. Mundt attended public schools in Humboldt, Pierre, and Madison, graduating from Madison High School in 1919. In high school, he excelled in oratory and debate, which became lifetime passions.

=== Early career ===
After receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1923 with a major in economics, he became a teacher and principal at Bryant High School in Bryant, South Dakota. As a first-year teacher he taught speech, psychology, sociology, and government, coached the debate, oratory, and extemporaneous speech teams, and began a school newspaper. After his first year, he was promoted to Superintendent of Bryant schools, a position he held until 1927. As superintendent, he continued to coach debate and oratory.

=== Marriage ===
In 1924, Mundt married Mary Elizabeth Moses (1900–1985), a college classmate who also taught at Bryant High School. In 1927, both Karl and Mary Mundt received Master of Arts degrees from Columbia University following four years of summer study there. Beginning in 1928, they both taught at Eastern State Normal School (now Dakota State University), continuing there until 1936. Karl headed the speech department and taught psychology and economics, while Mary taught drama and French.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1936, Mundt was the Republican candidate for the House of Representatives in South Dakota&#x27;s 1st congressional district, losing in a Democratic year to Fred H. Hildebrandt. He won the seat in the 1938 election, a year more favorable to Republicans, and was re-elected four times.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1948, he was elected to the Senate seat previously held by Harlan J. Bushfield. He resigned his House seat on December 30, 1948, having been appointed to the Senate to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Vera C. Bushfield, who had succeeded her husband after his death in September 1948. Mundt was re-elected to the Senate in 1954, 1960, and 1966. In 1960, he was challenged for re-election by then-U.S. Representative George McGovern and nearly defeated.

=== Illness ===
On November 23, 1969, Mundt suffered a severe stroke and was subsequently unable to attend sessions of Congress, although he received extensive speech and physical therapy. His wife, Mary, led his staff in Mundt&#x27;s place and refused calls for the crippled Senator to resign. Mundt was stripped of his committee assignments by the Senate Republican Conference in 1972, but he remained in office through the end of his term on January 3, 1973. He did not seek reelection in 1972, and was succeeded in the Senate by Democrat James G. Abourezk.

=== Death and burial ===
Karl Mundt died in Washington, D.C. in 1974 of a heart ailment and was buried at Graceland Cemetery in Madison, South Dakota.

==Accomplishments in the U.S. Congress==

In the House of Representatives, Mundt sponsored and supported proposals for &quot;Buy American&quot; legislation, was a member of the Foreign Affairs committee from 1941 to 1948, and played a key role in encouraging the United States to join the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1945. He was a key proponent of the Voice of America, which was established as a result of the Smith-Mundt Act, signed into law in 1948. He was a member of the House Un-American Activities Committee from 1943 to 1948. HUAC&#x27;s activities during this period included the Alger Hiss hearings and investigations of the motion picture industry. Mundt was unsuccessful in attempts to have HUAC continue investigating the Ku Klux Klan.

He also introduced a modification to Title 50, criminalizing the passage of certain classified information to foreign nationals.

Mundt voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the confirmation of Thurgood Marshall to the U.S. Supreme Court.

As a Senator, Mundt served on the Senate&#x27;s Appropriations Committee, Foreign Relations Committee, Government Operations Committee, and Permanent Investigations Subcommittee, and he represented the Senate on the Intergovernmental Relations Advisory Commission. In 1954, he chaired the Senate Subcommittee on Investigations for the Army-McCarthy Hearings. His accomplishments as a Senator included obtaining support for Missouri River projects, establishment of the EROS Data Center in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, agriculture programs, and Interstate highway construction in South Dakota.

==The National Forensic League==
In 1925, Bruno E. Jacob founded the National Forensic League, a high school organization promoting speech and debate activities. Mundt served as the organization&#x27;s national president from 1932 until 1971.

Mundt was the primary sponsor of the Alexander Hamilton Bicentennial Convention, held in the summer of 1957. It featured 55 high school (mostly) seniors in Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as representatives of the (then) 48 states and seven territories in a &quot;mock&quot; constitutional convention.

==Legacy==

The Karl Mundt Archives including personal papers, congressional correspondence and many personal items are available at Dakota State University in Madison. The Karl Mundt Library was named in his honor and dedicated by Richard Nixon in 1969. The Karl E. Mundt National Wildlife Refuge in South Dakota was named in his honor when it was established in 1974.

The Karl E. Mundt Foundation, established in Mundt&#x27;s honor in 1963, awards prizes for essays and oratorical contests, sponsors seminars and public lectures, and helps support the annual Karl E. Mundt Debate Tournament and Karl E. Mundt Dakota Invitational Oral Interpretation Contest in South Dakota. The Karl E. Mundt Foundation had its offices at the Karl Mundt Library at Dakota State University, but closed in July 2017. The Karl Mundt Archives are now one with the library.

One of the principal characters of the Coen brothers&#x27; 1991 film &quot;Barton Fink&quot; is a traveling salesman named Karl Mundt, played by actor John Goodman.

<doc id="917323" wikidata="Q4689423" url="?curid=917323" title="Bonnie">
<text>Bonnie is a Scottish given name and is sometimes used as a descriptive reference, as in the Scottish folk song, My Bonnie Lies over the Ocean or Bonnie Dundee about John Graham, 7th Laird of Claverhouse. It comes from the Scots language word &quot;bonnie&quot; (handsome, pretty, attractive), or the French (good). That is in turn derived from the Latin word &quot;bonus&quot; (good). The name can also be used as a pet form of Bonita.

==Usage==
The name has been in use, primarily in the Anglosphere, since the 1800s. It has been ranked among the 50 most popular names for newborn girls in the United Kingdom since 2020 and had been rising in popularity for British girls since the 1990s. It was among the 1,000 most used names for newborn girls in the United States between 1880 and 2003, reaching the height of popularity between 1928 and 1966, when it was ranked among the 100 most popular names for newborn American girls. It was also ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for newborn American boys between 1884 and 1953. The name then declined in popularity but has again risen in usage for girls in the United States in recent years and has been ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for newborn girls there since 2014. It has also been among the top 100 names for girls in Australia since 2014, in New Zealand since 2021, and in Sweden since 2019. In Canada, the name was among the 100 most popular names for girls between 1940 and 1973, but has since declined in usage.

Spelling variants in use include Bonney, Bonni and Bonny. Elaborations of the name such as Bonnibel are also used. Other related names, also containing the word element &quot;bon&quot;, meaning &quot;good&quot; or &quot;attractive&quot; in various languages, include the Italian Bona and the Spanish Bonita. Some related given names or surnames include Bonaccorso, Bonaparte, Bonaventura, Boniface, Bonilla, and Bueno.

The increase in usage of the name coincides with its use for characters in movie and television productions. It was the nickname used for Bonnie Blue Butler, the young daughter of Rhett Butler and Scarlett O’Hara in Margaret Mitchell’s 1935 novel &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; and its 1939 film adaptation, because the child&#x27;s eyes were said to be “as blue as the bonnie blue flag.” The name gained some notoriety via bank robbers Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow and the 1967 film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; made about the couple.

<text>Anthony John Mundella (28 March 1825– 21 July 1897) was an English manufacturer and later a Liberal Party MP and Cabinet Minister who sat in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom from 1868 to 1897. He served under William Ewart Gladstone as Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education from 1880 to 1885 and as President of the Board of Trade in 1886 and from 1892 to 1894. As education minister he established universal compulsory education in Britain and played the major part in building the state education system. At the Board of Trade he was instrumental in the reduction of working hours and the raising of minimum ages in the employment of children and young people. He was among the first to prove the effectiveness of arbitration and conciliation in industrial relations. He also brought in the first laws to prevent cruelty to children. His political achievements in the late Victorian age are said to have anticipated 20th century society.

==Early life==
Anthony John Mundella was born in Leicester, England in 1825. He was the first of five children of Antonio Mondelli (later known as Anthony Mundella), a refugee from Lombardy of uncertain background, and his wife Rebecca Allsopp of Leicester. At the time of Mundella&#x27;s birth, his father was a poorly paid trimmer in the hosiery trade. His mother made lace on a frame in their home and was regarded as adept at this work but, nonetheless, she too was poorly paid and after rent for housing and for the lace frame there was invariably little left to live on.

Mundella was christened on 15 August 1826 at the Great Meeting Unitarian chapel in Leicester. His granddaughter maintained that he was named Antonio Giovanni but the Great Meeting baptismal register confirms that he was christened Anthony John.

Though from a Catholic and nonconformist background, he attended the Church of England school of St Nicholas in Leicester, an establishment maintained by the National Society for Promoting Religious Education to provide elementary education for children from poor homes, until the age of nine. Though he rebelled against the catechism and disliked the creed, describing them in later life as &quot;my especial abomination&quot;, Mundella remained loyal to his early education in anglicanism for the rest of his life. Outside school, his mother, with her wide knowledge of English literature, particularly Shakespeare, instilled in his mind a love of the beautiful in nature, in literature, and in art. Because of the family&#x27;s then abject financial circumstances, when Rebecca Mundella&#x27;s eyesight worsened and she could no longer work at lacemaking the boy had to be withdrawn from school so that he could earn money to help the family. At nine, he started work in a printing office as a printer&#x27;s devil, an opportunity used by him to extend his education. At eleven he was apprenticed to William Kempson, whose business made footwear, hosiery and haberdashery.

From his father, and the exiled Italians who occasionally visited the family home, Mundella acquired at an early age what was described as &quot;a kind of strange unconventional political education&quot;. At fifteen he became politically engaged and, inspired by the local Chartist leader, Thomas Cooper, enrolled as a Chartist, becoming increasingly involved in the movement. He became adept at writing political ballads and while still fifteen heard his compositions sung on the streets and at political meetings. At the same age he made his first political speech, in support of the &quot;Charter&quot;. He was further politically inspired by the arrival in Leicester of Richard Cobden on his nationwide campaign for the repeal of the Corn Laws, and was always active in advocating the causes of the working classes.

Mundella had always been a regular Sunday School scholar and as he grew older he became a teacher, then secretary, and ultimately superintendent of a large, poor Sunday School in Sanvey Gate in Leicester.

At the age of eighteen Mundella left Kempson&#x27;s to become a journeyman, then an overseer (in which post he earned £200 a year and a commission on profits) and ultimately manager of a large warehouse set up by another hosiery manufacturing business in Leicester, Harris &amp; Hamel. Richard Harris was a prominent Liberal and Chartist in the city. Mundella prospered and, while still eighteen, he married. He worked for Harris for three years, until he was 22, and while there the firm experimented seriously and secretly with machinery driven by steam power. Mundella was not technically minded, though his experience at Harris&#x27;s with mechanical experimentation helped to form his abiding interest and fascination in new steam-powered hosiery-making machinery. He was one of the first industrialists in the Midlands to realise that steam power was something far more than a means to great wealth. He believed that it could be &quot;so applied and developed as to lift the mass of workers out of serfdom&quot;.

==Manufacturing career==
In 1848 Mundella was offered a partnership by old-established hosiery manufacturers, Hine &amp; Co of Nottingham, who needed help to construct and open a large new factory. He became a partner in the company, which soon became known as Hine &amp; Mundella.

For the next fifteen years Mundella devoted his energy to reinventing the mechanics of a hosiery industry which for the most part relied on old-style mechanical stocking frames operated by perennially poor framework-knitters in their own homes. He pioneered many changes, including new machines which produced tubular knitting rather than the stocking-frame&#x27;s straight knit. Mundella had long maintained that the best machines in the hosiery trade were &quot;principally the inventions of working men&quot;. Not by his own invention, but by encouraging inventors within the company (many of them loom operators) and sharing patents with them, Mundella was able to develop plentiful new hosiery-making machinery, a lot of it steam-driven, including a technological revolution: a machine which for the first time enabled a stocking to be made and fully fashioned automatically without stopping the action. The result was stockings made a hundred times faster than they could be by the framework knitters.
Mundella built large new premises for the company in 1851, the first steam-operated hosiery factory in Nottingham. It had wide and spacious workrooms, was lit entirely by daylight and gas jets, and had the finest machinery. By 1857 Hine and Mundella were employing 4,000 workers who were well paid, partly because by attracting good operatives Mundella hoped they would use their intelligence and inventiveness to suggest improvements in the way they worked. Improved conditions, Mundella observed, brought enhanced loyalty.

There was a setback in 1859 when Hine &amp; Mundella&#x27;s factory was damaged by fire, but it was soon rebuilt and returned to operation with the advantage of newer and more powerful machines, in large part paid for by the company&#x27;s insurers. Hine and Mundella continued to prosper. They opened factories in Loughborough in Leicestershire, England in 1859 and Chemnitz, Saxony in 1866. A London warehouse at the centre of the textile trade in Wood Street was acquired.

In 1860, a series of strikes and lock-outs hit Nottingham&#x27;s hosiery business. The inadequate wages of home framework-knitters compared to those of the factory operatives led to demands for higher pay (although Mundella&#x27;s employees were not involved). Mundella organised a conference between workers and the employers. He had to contend with suspicious employers and with powerful trade unionists, and reconcile the penurious framework-knitters with the comparatively well-paid and skilled factory workers. He proposed that the workers should have the wages they demanded and also that a board of arbitration (the Nottingham Board of Arbitration and Conciliation for the Hosiery Trade) composed of both employers and workers should be established to prevent further strikes by fixing the price for handwork and preventing disputes by constant conference between both sides. The essence was that prevention of strife was better than subsequent remedy.

Mundella&#x27;s principle of conciliation was not entirely original; other such boards of conciliation or arbitration had been set up, mostly successfully, in a few other trades but none of them had been established in an industry as antagonistic and complex with technological change as the hosiery trade. Mundella was the first to prove that the principle worked in an industry of much complexity with the aim of, rather than fighting fires, preventing fires starting in the first place. It was hailed as a success and was adopted not only in other parts of the country, but also in continental Europe and in the United States. 

In 1863 the stress of business became so great that Mundella&#x27;s health broke down. He went to Italy and spent two years recuperating. In his absence the firm of Hine &amp; Mundella was converted into a limited liability company, the Nottingham Hosiery Manufacturing Company. The firm continued to expand, developing further interests in Saxony, and Boston in the United States.

Mundella had made a success out of the business. When he joined Hine &amp; Co in 1848 the annual turnover was £18,000 (); when he left the firm in 1873 (finding it impossible to live in London as an MP and manage a business in Nottingham) the annual turnover was £500,000 ().

Mundella was a prominent and popular public figure in Nottingham and was an active force in his local Liberal party, becoming sheriff of Nottingham in 1852, at the age of 28. In 1856 he was elected a town councillor and helped to set up the Nottingham Chamber of Commerce. From 1859, at the time of increased fear of an invasion by France, he was one of the founding members of the local volunteer corps, the Robin Hood Rifles, joining in May 1859 and being promoted to lieutenant in June and captain five months later.

Aside from local political action, Mundella&#x27;s business experience showed him that progress in industry depended on reciprocal understanding between workers and employers, and that progress generally required significant improvements in the nation&#x27;s education system, including technical training. He also recognised that very young children could not be properly educated if they were spending their time working in factories. When travelling in continental Europe on business and on personal relaxation, Mundella saw how superior the education systems of other countries were, particularly in Switzerland and the German states, and was dismayed at the comparative shortcomings of the English system. He knew that achieving the required progress in these matters would involve collective effort and increasing state intervention. At the same time, his business experience, arising from his working past, confirmed his belief in the desirability, indeed necessity, of trade unions. The opportunity to put his beliefs into action appeared in 1868.

==Election to parliament==
After Mundella&#x27;s 1863 success in arbitrating the Nottingham industrial strife he was invited by many English and Welsh towns to expound on the system of arbitration and to help settle a number of labour conflicts. Outbreaks of violence, including explosions and murders, in the Sheffield steel industry led to the 1867 Royal Commission on Trade Unions. Mundella showed the commission that unions could play a positive part in industrial relations, and that working men could be trusted. In 1868 he was invited to address a joint meeting in Sheffield of the organised trades and the local branch of the Reform League. The leaders of his audience were so inspired by his speech that they assured him of their support if he were to stand for the Liberal Party in the Sheffield constituency in the forthcoming general election.

Mundella had already stated that he &quot;did not feel obliged to go on toiling to amass a great fortune, but was justified in giving up commerce to devote himself to political life and his love of beautiful things&quot;. He agreed to stand and was formally adopted as a Liberal candidate on 20 July 1868.

The election in Sheffield was a long and bitterly fought contest. Mundella suffered much abuse. There were attacks on his Italian ancestry; though he was not Jewish he was lampooned by antisemitic cartoonists because of his looks; his morality in business was questioned. But benefitting from the Reform Act of 1867 which had enfranchised a large number of male householders for the first time, Mundella prevailed in Sheffield. He was to represent the seat, and its successor, Sheffield Brightside, until his death nearly thirty years later.

==Political career==
Mundella took his seat in the House of Commons as part of the Liberal Party majority of 116. With his evident confidence, the respect in which he was held as a pioneer of industrial arbitration and as an expert on social matters, combined with the early perception that he was a hard worker, he immediately found himself to be one of the most highly regarded MPs of the new intake.

Mundella was chosen to second the reply to the Speech from the Throne and in doing so made his maiden speech on 16 February 1869. The prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone, warmly congratulated him on his speech. In the middle of March Mundella&#x27;s stock rose higher when his board of arbitration was commended in the newly published Report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions.

===Backbencher===
Mundella&#x27;s main concerns on joining the House were trade union reform and the need for free, compulsory schooling and for technical training. Trade unionism had no greater friend than Mundella. He was a believer in the right of working men and women to combine to protect their interests, and much of his energy in Parliament was devoted to securing the same rights for them as were enjoyed by their employers. In 1869 Mundella began to plan a private member&#x27;s bill to legalise the unions and give them financial security. Though the bill did not proceed, his efforts did secure a temporary government bill which gave protection to trade union funds and two years later led to the Trade Union Act 1871 which legalised trade unions and protected their funds by legal registration.

Mundella’s first moves in the House regarding education were strongly to support the passing of the Elementary Education Act 1870. His speech on the second reading of the bill did much to enhance his parliamentary reputation. Though the Act established local education authorities and authorised public money for school improvements, it did not meet with Mundella’s complete approval as it introduced neither free nor compulsory schooling (except in a tentative, experimental way through the by-laws which school boards were empowered to make), but he was anxious to take what parliament was willing to give rather than reject it because it was not good enough.

The trade unions and education were not Mundella’s sole concerns in his early years as a backbencher. He attacked the War Office for its antiquated system for issuing army contracts, and advocated short army and navy service, more volunteers and better organisation. He joined in an attempt to modernise the patent laws, which for a long time had been his concern as an industrialist. He spoke against what he called the &quot;absurdity&quot; of the complicated and inconsistent postal rates. He denounced the obsolete game laws, whose punishments for poaching jailed many thousands of men. And he attacked the inconsistent treatment of men and women in the Contagious Diseases Acts of the 1860s which in ports and garrison towns subjected female prostitutes, and those suspected of being such, to arrest, inspection, and (if they were found to be infected) incarceration for up to one year, while no provision was made for the examination of their male customers. He also pressed for the legal age of sexual intercourse to be raised to 16, since over 25 per cent of those with sexually transmitted infections were under that age.

Mundella was also greatly concerned at the employment of children of very young ages, and how their presence at work would make compulsory elementary education impossible. In 1871 he put forward a measure to control the employment of children in the manufacture of bricks and tiles. His move was welcomed so readily that it was incorporated into the government&#x27;s Factory and Workshop Act of 1871. As a result, the employment of girls under sixteen and boys under ten in brick and tile yards was prohibited.

Mundella&#x27;s long-established interest in arbitration resulted in 1872 in his Arbitration (Masters and Workmen) Act (commonly known as Mundella&#x27;s Act) which made voluntary agreements between managers and workers mutually binding. In the same year he aided the passage of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, paying particular attention to the clauses restricting the working hours of women and children. He continued his campaign for fewer hours for women and children with the introduction of a nine-hours factory bill in 1872 but it made slow progress and in the summer of 1873, due to opposition from manufacturers, it was withdrawn.

Mundella&#x27;s perennial concern for children also led him to introduce, in 1873, a bill for the protection of children against people who, being in charge of them, had been convicted of violence against them.

===Opposition backbencher===

In the general election of 1874, the Liberal Party was defeated, but Mundella continued his parliamentary campaigns from the opposition backbenches and reintroduced his nine-hours bill. The Conservative government, harvesting the fruits of Mundella&#x27;s three years&#x27; hard work on his bill, introduced their own factory bill which was designed to achieve much the same aims. The subsequent Factories (Health of Women, &amp;c.) Act of 1875 established a ten-hour day for women and children in textile factories. It was widely recognised in the textile districts that it was Mundella&#x27;s efforts which had secured its passing.

Mundella was also praised – this time by the trade union leadership – for his opposition backbench role in amending and enabling the passing of, firstly, the Employers and Workmen Act 1875 which replaced the repressive Master and Servant Acts, and, secondly, the passing of the Conspiracy, and Protection of Property Act 1875 which, combined with the repeal of the much-hated Criminal Law Amendment Act 1871, released workers from the severe penalties which were aimed solely at them. Both Acts together decriminalised the work of trade unions.

To Mundella at this time was also the credit for his Bill instituting a closed season from 15 March to 15 June for freshwater fish. Known officially as the Freshwater Fisheries Act and colloquially amongst anglers as the Mundella Act, it became law in 1878.

In 1877 Mundella sponsored a bill to abolish the property qualification for standing for local office, pointing out that 80 to 90 per cent of the voters in his constituency were disqualified from being councillors and yet were the first to be pressured by rises in rates. The bill found little traction in the House and each time it reappeared in the period from 1877 to 1879 it was defeated. The Conservatives finally passed the measure in 1880.

===Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education===

The Liberals returned to power in 1880 with a large majority and Gladstone, recognising the younger man&#x27;s expertise in the field of education reform, appointed him Vice-President of the Committee of the Council on Education (in other words, Secretary of State for Education). At the same time Mundella was appointed a privy councillor. When Queen Victoria received his name from the prime minister she described him in her diary as &quot;Mr. Mundella (one of the most violent radicals)”. She wrote that on disapprovingly remarking to Gladstone about Mundella&#x27;s appointment &quot;Mr. Gladstone praised him very much, saying he was a very religious man, very much for religious education, and never said anything offensive&quot;. At the same time, Mundella was also appointed the fourth Charity Commissioner for England and Wales.

Despite being junior to the Lord President of the Council Mundella was in charge of education, and he was now positioned to achieve a number of his aims, in particular that of compulsory elementary education. He set to work with vigour, despite strong opposition. Referring to Mundella&#x27;s researches into schooling in continental Europe, &quot;The Times&quot; stated that &quot;compulsory education might do for the Saxons, but would never be endured by the Anglo-Saxons&quot;. To those organisations and people who maintained that compulsion was un-English Mundella replied that it was &quot;peculiarly English to be content to be in ignorance&quot;. Immediately on reaching office Mundella introduced a bill to complete the system of compulsion to attend school, which had not been achieved by previous Acts. The Mundella Act (another Act credited to his name), properly known as the Elementary Education Act 1880, which became law only four months after the Liberals returned to power, established the means to enforce that all children would be sent to school.

Mundella then set in motion the reorganisation of technical education. He had always taken an interest in higher and technical education, as well as in art schools and other forms of art culture, and they had invariably secured his sympathy and aid. As his first move in higher education, Mundella formed a single institution of the scientific schools at South Kensington in London, establishing the Normal School of Science and Royal School of Mines in October 1881.

Mundella appointed a departmental committee to investigate and make recommendations on higher education in Wales. The committee reported in 1881 and urged the immediate expansion of the Welsh intermediate schools and the establishment of university colleges in Cardiff and Bangor. Mundella further instituted a Royal Commission to examine foreign technical education and compare it with that available in England.

Mundella&#x27;s responsibilities also included the further development of the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum), which as a lover of art he found to be an enjoyable part of his labours.

Mundella&#x27;s educational code of 1882, which became known as the &quot;Mundella Code,&quot; marked a new departure in the regulation of public elementary schools, their curricula and how they were taught, and the conditions under which government grants were made. By 1883 money was made available to allow the code to operate. Mundella improved the inspection of schools, including employing some women inspectors, and insisting that the health and mental capacity of children should be taken into consideration when examining their learning progress. He also arranged beneficial change in teacher training. There were accusations that the strictness of the code was harsh and was causing children to overwork. To this the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot; declared: &quot;The educational system is not overworking children but demonstrating that they are underfed. This conclusion roused Mundella to urge local government to provide cheap meals for children.

While in England and Wales, endowments for higher education schools were being surveyed and where necessary reformed, no such action was taking place in Scotland. Mundella introduced bills to overhaul the Scottish endowments and extend compulsory elementary education to Scotland.

Mundella tried to modernise the Committee of the Council on Education by proposing the institution of an education department headed by a minister with a position in the cabinet, and the setting up of a department of agriculture which would take over his veterinary responsibilities (part of the education portfolio), but he was forestalled by the opposition of the Lord President of the Council.

In May 1885 Mundella was able to begin the process of introducing a measure to promote intermediate education in Wales, but on 9 June 1885 Gladstone resigned and as a result Mundella was forced to leave the vice-presidency. His Welsh legislation fell at the dissolution of parliament.

===Opposition frontbencher===

In the General Election of October 1885, Mundella stood for the new constituency of Brightside, one of Sheffield&#x27;s five parliamentary divisions. He was elected with a healthy majority, but nationally the general election was a stalemate, and the Conservatives took office with the help of Charles Stewart Parnell and his Irish Parliamentary Party, which held the balance of power. Mundella was again in opposition, but kept his place on the Liberal frontbench. Gladstone returned to the prime ministership barely three months later in January 1886 and after briefly considering Mundella for the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer he instead elevated him to the cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. 

===President of the Board of Trade (first term)===

In the short period before the next general election Mundella had little time at the Board of Trade to effect major legislative improvements but he was able to introduce a number of administrative changes.

He ensured that consular reports of trade and the trade requirements of different countries of the world should be published and available at a low price instead of being lost among general Foreign Office papers. He established a labour statistics bureau to allow information to be published and disseminated to the labouring class. He expanded the board to include a fisheries department, previously the realm of three different government departments, to look after both sea and inland fisheries.

There had long been disputation over the matter of railway freight charges, with the railway companies&#x27; trade and agricultural customers implacably opposed to the high prices charged for the movement of goods. As a means to secure a just and equitable re-assessment of the charges throughout Britain, Mundella introduced his railway and canal traffic bill, which would hand control over the railways to the Board of Trade, including the power to enforce reductions in charges. Mundella met vehement opposition from the railway companies and their shareholders, who were fearful that there would be a fall in their profits of up to 50 per cent and a destruction of the value of railway property.

They were further angered by Mundella&#x27;s introduction of a railway regulation bill which sought to impose better braking and other safety devices. Opposition to the railway and canal traffic bill rode on the back of the then widespread and equally vehement opposition in the House to Irish home rule. In a division on the Irish matter, Gladstone&#x27;s government fell, and with it Mundella&#x27;s attempted reform of the railways.

===Opposition frontbencher===

Mundella&#x27;s short period in charge of the Board of Trade ended on 30 July 1886 and in the general election in August the Conservatives regained power. From the opposition frontbench Mundella again campaigned for increased technical education among working people. With others, he was instrumental in inaugurating the National Association for the Promotion of Technical Education. The association became a force behind educational development, including secondary as well as technical education. Mundella also presided over the new National Education Association formed to promote a &quot;free progressive system of national education, publicly controlled and free from sectarian interest&quot; by publicising and advancing the School Board system and undermining denominational and private schools.

In 1888 Mundella introduced a bill for the prevention of cruelty to children. Due to opposition, progress of the bill was slow, with Mundella speaking 65 times in committee. The ensuing Prevention of Cruelty to, and Protection of, Children Act 1889 (commonly known as the Children&#x27;s Charter) was the first Act of Parliament to outlaw cruelty to children. It enabled the state to intervene in relations between parents and children, made it an imprisonable crime to neglect or ill-treat children, and outlawed the employment of children under the age of 10. Mundella regarded this Act as one of his greatest successes.

In 1890 Mundella became chairman of the Trade and Treaties Committee, responsible for keeping the Board of Trade informed on expiring treaties and new tariffs and duties. In 1891 and 1892, on the urging of Gladstone, he became an opposition frontbench representative on the Royal Commission on Labour. He chaired the section dealing with conditions in the chemical, building, textile, clothing and miscellaneous trades. As such, he was able to institute the appointment of four women inspectors to examine the position of women in industry.

===President of the Board of Trade (second term)===

In the 1892 general election Mundella retained his seat of Sheffield Brightside with an increased majority and the Liberal Party formed the government. Mundella returned to the cabinet and to the presidency of the Board of Trade.

There Mundella again faced the railway companies and their shareholders, as the agricultural lobby and businesses were still anxious to see reduced freight charges. Cautious of raising the ire of the railway companies again, in 1893 Mundella set up a committee to look into the charges. He also enabled the Railway Servants (Hours of Labour) Act, which allowed railway employees to reduce their working hours.

Early in 1893, the Bureau of Labour Statistics which Mundella set up in his first term as trade minister was expanded into a labour department, separate from the Board of Trade. This department published a regular &quot;Labour Gazette&quot; to ensure that information about labour was popularised in order to reach the working classes.

In 1893 there was a lock-out of miners in the Midlands, with nearly 320,000 men who were objecting to a reduction in pay being thrown out of work. Mundella encouraged conciliation and as a result the coal strike was settled. The conflict encouraged Mundella to introduce a bill to enable the establishment of local boards of conciliation and arbitration whenever and wherever they might be required.

Mundella enabled three separate maritime reforms. The North Sea Fisheries Act ratified the convention between the countries bordering the North Sea fishing areas to deal with floating alcohol &quot;shops&quot; which supplied fishermen with liquor. An improvement in the way merchant seamen were paid their wages at the end of a voyage ensured they did not have to linger for long periods in the seaports rather than returning home, thereby reducing prostitution in the ports. A merchant shipping bill was introduced to halt the undermanning of ships.

Concerned by the annual returns of railway accidents and deaths furnished by the Board of Trade, Mundella appointed two railway men to inquire into the accidents and their causes, and to find means to increase safety.

Mundella&#x27;s stock was now high. Early in 1894 Gladstone wrote of him: &quot;He … has done himself much credit in the present government&quot;.

===Resignation===

In 1869 Mundella had joined the board of the New Zealand Loan and Mercantile Agency Company. It was a successful venture and Mundella&#x27;s pecuniary interest prospered. Under newly established rules, on becoming president of the Board of Trade in 1892 he relinquished all his directorships and thereafter had no control over the company&#x27;s activities. In 1893, as a result of an economic downturn, the company was forced into liquidation and became the subject of a Board of Trade inquiry. Though Mundella was no longer a director and was innocent of any fault, a conflict of interest existed because the final decision on what further proceedings should follow a public investigation in court (in which Mundella gave evidence) would have to be made by Mundella himself as president of the Board of Trade. He was compromised, and his role as president became unsustainable.

Mundella tendered his resignation to Lord Rosebery, by then prime minister, who requested him to withdraw it. Mundella insisted upon it and his resignation took effect on 12 May 1894. On 24 May he addressed the House of Commons on the matter. The magazine &quot;Punch&quot; wrote: &quot;The House felt that here was a good man suffering with adversity. That it was undeserved, had swooped down, and blighted temporarily an honourable career when it seemed to have reached its serener heights, made the calamity none the less hard to bear. Mundella comported himself with the dignity that commanded the respect of the House. (He) sat down amid cheering on both sides&quot;.

Mundella wrote to his sister Theresa: &quot;I was received with loud cheering when I entered the House, when I rose to address it, and the loudest from all sides when I sat down. Men crowded round me all night to shake hands with me, and all my colleagues said I had done it so admirably and with so much dignity&quot; There were tributes from Gladstone and Rosebery (the latter insisting that it was a &quot;source of grief and weakness&quot; to the government to be deprived of his &quot;great&quot; services), and hundreds of resolutions of sympathy from workers all over the country reached him, thanking him for his life-long services to labour. He was not to return to ministerial power, and served on the backbenches until the general election of 1895.

===Government backbencher===

In the year following his resignation, Mundella arbitrated successfully in the Hanley pottery dispute in March 1895 and was intensively occupied as chairman of the committee examining the poor law schools in London.

===Opposition frontbencher===

The general election of July 1895 saw the Conservatives win with an overall majority of 152 and the Liberal Party were back in opposition. Mundella, still esteemed by his constituents, was returned unopposed for Sheffield Brightside, and his colleagues in the House recalled him to the opposition frontbench. From that position, despite his age, he continued his fight for his favoured causes. He strongly opposed the education bills of 1896 and 1897 which he saw as destructive of his education policy, and he complained that the compulsory clauses of his education Act were scarcely enforced so that nearly one-fifth of the potential school population was absent. The result, he pointed out, was widespread illiteracy among those of school-leaving age.

Mundella&#x27;s final utterance in the House, after 3,280 vocal contributions over nearly thirty years as an MP, was a brief interjection in the debate on the second reading of the education (Scotland) bill on 1 July 1897.

==Death==

Mundella died unexpectedly. On 14 July 1897 his butler found him &quot;prostrated and unconscious&quot; on his bedroom floor. He had suffered a stroke and remained paralysed with a complete loss of speech, and he was barely conscious for eight days. Many people, including Queen Victoria (who telegraphed a number of times for news) and leading politicians of all shades of opinion, expressed concern. At 1.55 pm on 21 July 1897 he died, at the age of 72.

Three funeral services were held. The first was at St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster on 26 July. It was unusual for St Margaret&#x27;s in that Mundella&#x27;s coffin was present, rather than the service being a memorial. The coffin was draped in a pall of Venetian brocade, with a marble statuette of the Madonna and Child and a photograph of Mundella&#x27;s late wife placed at its head. Queen Victoria sent a wreath, and she and the Prince of Wales were represented amongst a very large number of male and female mourners. The church was full and later congregants were forced to assemble outside. It was noted that an unusually large number of working men had come to pay their respects to Mundella.

Mundella&#x27;s coffin was then taken through the centre of London to St Pancras station for transfer by train to Nottingham. A second funeral service was held in Nottingham at St Mary&#x27;s church on 27 July. It was the largest funeral the city had ever seen. Crowds then lined the route from St Mary&#x27;s to the Church Cemetery, where further mourners crowded onto the hillside overlooking the grave. A third service was conducted at the graveside. He was buried in the Mundella vault where his parents, his wife and his youngest brother had been previously interred.

A wide stone in a combination of classical styles and Arts and Crafts decoration was erected over the tomb. To Mundella&#x27;s name was added the inscription: &quot;Loving knowledge for its own sake, he strove to diffuse it among his countrymen. He laboured for industrial peace, and the welfare of the children of the poor.&quot;

==Legacy and reputation==

Mundella was highly respected during his long period in Victorian Liberal politics, achieving elevation to the cabinet and attaining the distinction of becoming known as a statesman. It has been argued that his was &quot;the most productive mind in late Victorian England at work in the kindred fields of education, industry and labour&quot; and as a result his political achievements in those fields were remarkable.

By such work Mundella prepared the late Victorian age for the dawning of the 20th century. Many of the improvements he fostered have been altered somewhat in the years since his death, but the long-term effects of everything he enabled have remained: children must still go to school, trade unions are still legal, freshwater fish are still allowed a peaceful breeding season.
Despite Mundella&#x27;s beneficial influence on education, industry, and the protection of children, after his death in 1897 his name and reputation disappeared from public view and he became mostly a forgotten man of Gladstone&#x27;s administrations.

It has been suggested that one reason was the absence of an early biography. It was the intention of Mundella&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa to write his biography (which would presumably have been celebratory), but despite working for some years on his archive, collecting contributions and loans from others, and making lengthy transcriptions, nothing was published. She died in 1922. Her collected Mundella papers then passed to his granddaughter, Dorothea Benson, Lady Charnwood, who presented them to the University of Sheffield Library in the 1930s.

A biography finally appeared. Harry Armytage&#x27;s &quot;A.J.Mundella 1825–1897 – The Liberal Background to the Labour Movement&quot; was published in 1951. He made good use of Ms Mundella&#x27;s copious research in his book, and before its publication in academic papers and a radio broadcast. Mundella is regularly mentioned in volumes recording the Victorian hosiery business, the history of education, and early labour relations. Academic theses have examined his political reputation. The &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot; completely rewrote his entry in 2004.
But such occasional kick-starting has failed to fire the engine of modern-day regard for Mundella’s reputation. He is absent from the Encyclopaedia Britannica, and Wikipedia’s original article about him was brief and incomplete. There is no public monument to him. Mundella Grammar School in Nottingham no longer exists. A request in the mid-1980s for the installation of a commemorative blue plaque at Mundella&#x27;s London home of 16 Elvaston Place was refused by English Heritage.

==Personal life==

On 12 March 1844, when aged eighteen, Mundella married Mary, the daughter of William Smith, a warehouseman of Kibworth Beauchamp in Leicestershire. They had two daughters, Eliza Ellen and Maria Theresa.

When Mundella was a manufacturer he commissioned a large new villa, designed by the architect Thomas Chambers Hine, in The Park Estate in Nottingham, and after moving to London when he became an MP the family lived, firstly, in Dean&#x27;s Yard in Westminster, then rented a house in Stanhope Gardens in Kensington before, at the end of 1872, purchasing 16 Elvaston Place nearby. While he had made money in business, Mundella had never been particularly rich. The crash of the New Zealand company which had been the cause of his resignation left him in financial difficulties, but on the recommendation of Lord Rosebery he was awarded an annual Civil List pension of £1,200 () which enabled him to continue to live in Elvaston Place.

Mundella had a striking presence, being tall and thin and bent at the shoulders with a dark complexion, a prominent hooked nose and a flowing beard. Easily recognisable, he was reported to be a familiar figure in London. In character he was described as warm, impulsive, enthusiastic, and optimistic, and ready to believe the best in anyone.

It has been observed that &quot;Mundella made enemies at every stage. He was far too confident and masterful for a quiet life, and in an age of overflowing political activity his mind and methods appeared to stand for the whole menace of radical change.&quot; As he grew older the cabinet held him in high esteem but younger politicians were &quot;never quite sure whether he was a rogue or a fool, but they were convinced that he was a bore&quot; because of his determined enthusiasm on a few dominant themes.

At home, Mundella had a regard for domestic comforts and liked to be surrounded by beautiful objects. One of his nieces recalled that he and his family flourished at a time when all things Italian were fashionable and having Italian ancestry was considered most desirable. 16 Elvaston Place, she recalled, was full of beautiful Italian things. The house was often crowded with friends, not only politicians, but also many from the world of the arts and literature, business, and journalism.

Mundella was a Fellow of the Royal Society, an honour awarded in 1882 that he described as &quot;the most agreeable and distinguished that could fall upon me&quot;, In 1884 he became President of the Sunday School Union, a position he deeply valued. His elevation in political life brought him from his labouring class roots into the sphere of the rich, the aristocratic, and the royal. After her initial suspicion, Queen Victoria learned to care deeply for him and invited him for weekends at Windsor, Osborne, and Sandringham. She was distressed by his death.
Though Mundella was not Jewish (his mother being a Protestant and his father a Catholic), throughout his political life his looks, his foreign-sounding name, and his artistic individualism in dress encouraged opponents and hostile cartoonists and journalists to indulge in anti-semitic insults.

Despite Mundella&#x27;s claim when applying for his Civil List pension in 1894 that he had &quot;insufficient private means&quot;, at his death, three years later, his estate was valued at £42,619 1s 3d ().

==Mundella likenesses==

* Portrait in oil: by Sir Arthur Stockdale Cope RA (1857–1940). Painted on commission for the citizens of Sheffield to celebrate Mundella&#x27;s 25th anniversary as an MP. A three-quarter length portrayal of Mundella as president of the Board of Trade with his hand resting on a departmental despatch box. The &quot;Sheffield Telegraph&quot; commented: &quot;His face wears a somewhat sad and serious expression, and the artist has given him the full measure of his years&quot;. The artist was Mundella&#x27;s own choice. The painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Arts in London in the spring of 1894 and presented to Mundella on 11 Dec 1894 before being given to Sheffield Town Council. It is on loan to Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust. 
* A replica of the portrait, also painted by Cope, was presented to Mundella&#x27;s daughter Maria Theresa on the same occasion. Its location is unknown. 
* Portrait in oil: by Arthur John Black (1855–1936). This portrait was presented to Mundella&#x27;s daughter, Maria Theresa, who in 1898 donated it to the Nottingham School Board for display in the new Mundella Grammar School. The school closed in 1985 and the portrait was passed to its successor schools, Roland Green Comprehensive and The Nottingham Emmanuel School. It was then taken into the care of a group of former students of the Mundella Grammar School, who in 2009 had it cleaned and loaned it to the Bromley House Library, Nottingham, where it is now displayed. 
* Bust, marble: by Sir Joseph Edgar Boehm RA (1834–1890). Working women and children, who had enjoyed the benefit of the Factory Act of 1874 subscribed, mostly in single pennies, to a tribute to Mundella and his wife. It took the form of the bust by Boehm and bears the inscription: &quot;Presented to Mrs. Mundella by 80,000 factory workers, chiefly women and children, in grateful acknowledgement of her husband&#x27;s services&quot;. It was presented to Mary Mundella at a ceremony in Manchester in August 1884, ten years after the Factory Act had passed. The bust remained in the family until some time after 1938 when it was presented to the Nottingham School Board for display in the Mundella Grammar School. When this school closed in 1985 the bust passed to Roland Green School and then The Nottingham Emmanuel School. It was then taken into the care of a group of former students of Nottingham Grammar School, who in 2009 had it cleaned and loaned it to the Bromley House Library, Nottingham where it is now displayed. 
* Caricature, chromolithograph: by Coïdé, the pseudonym of James Jacques Joseph Tissot (1836–1902). It was first published in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; on 9 December 1871 as Number 99 in their series of &quot;Portraits of Statesmen&quot;. It is entitled &quot;Education and Arbitration&quot;. Reproductions were available for sale and there are consequently many copies in private hands and in public collections, including those of the UK Houses of Parliament, the National Portrait Gallery, London, and the University of Sheffield Library. 
* Caricature, chromolithograph: by Spy, the pseudonym of Sir Leslie Matthew Ward (1851–1922). It was first published in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; on 30 November 1893. It is entitled &quot;On the Terrace, A Political Spectacle: – The Ayes have it – the Noes have it&quot; and it is a group cartoon portrait with Mundella in the right foreground. A copy of it is owned by the National Portrait Gallery in London. 
* Newspaper cartoons: by various artists. 16 images, all including lampooning representations of Mundella, and all relating to the parliamentary elections in Sheffield in 1868. They are held by Sheffield University Library. 
* Photograph, platinum print: by Sir John Benjamin Stone (1838–1914). A late portrait photograph of Mundella, seen standing at an entrance to the Houses of Parliament and dated May 1897 (two months before his death). A copy is held by the National Portrait Gallery and another, with greater clarity of detail, by the UK Parliament&#x27;s digital archive. 
* Photograph, woodburytype carte de visite: by an unknown photographer. A head and shoulders portrait, taken in the 1870s. A copy is in the National Portrait Gallery. 
* Photograph, albumen print cabinet card: by Alexander Bassano (1829–1913) A right semi-profile head-and-shoulders portrait, made in 1885. The National Portrait Gallery owns a copy. 
* Photograph, albumen print: by Cyril Flower, 1st Baron Battersea (1843–1907). A three-quarter-length seated portrait, taken in the 1890s. A copy is held by the National Portrait Gallery. 
* As a leading statesman with prominent looks, Mundella can also be identified in many group portraits, photographs, and newspaper and journal illustrations of the late 1800s. Two particular images can be found in The Illustrated London News: the first, marking Mundella&#x27;s maiden speech in the House of Commons, was published on 27 February 1869, and the second, a group portrait by Walter Wilson of WE Gladstone&#x27;s new Cabinet, was published on 27 August 1892.

<text>Alan Noel Latimer Munby (25 December 1913 – 26 December 1974) was an English librarian, bibliographical scholar and book collector. He is also remembered as the author of a volume of ghost stories written in the tradition of M. R. James.

==Early life==
Born in Hampstead, Munby was the only son of the architect Alan E. Munby and his wife Ethel Greenhill. He was educated at Clifton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. At some point he acquired the nickname &quot;Tim&quot; (from the second syllable of his third name), by which he was known throughout his life.

==Career==
Munby worked in the antiquarian book trade with Bernard Quaritch Ltd. (1935–1937) and Sotheby &amp; Company (1937–1939, 1945–1947). During the Second World War, he was commissioned into the British Army but for several years was a prisoner of war. 

In 1947, he became Librarian of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and in 1948 was elected as a fellow. 

He was elected to the Roxburghe Club in 1957.

He was Lyell Lecturer in Bibliography at the University of Oxford for 1962–1963. He held the Sandars Readership in Bibliography, University of Cambridge in 1969–1970. 

Munby was a co-founder in 1949 of the Cambridge Bibliographical Society. He was elected President of the Bibliographical Society in 1974 and died during his term of office.

His scholarly publications include a five-volume study of the eccentric nineteenth-century book collector Sir Thomas Phillipps (1951–1960); a twelve-volume series of &quot;Sale Catalogues of Libraries of Eminent Persons&quot; (1971–1975); and a posthumously published union list of &quot;British Book Sale Catalogues, 1676–1800&quot; (1977), compiled with Lenore Coral. 

Munby&#x27;s correspondence with W. S. Lewis of the Lewis Walpole Library is held at that library.

===Ghost stories===
Munby is also remembered for a slim volume of ghost stories, &quot;The Alabaster Hand&quot;, which includes three tales written in Oflag VII-B, a German prisoner-of-war camp near Eichstätt, Bavaria. These stories – &quot;The Topley Place Sale&quot;, &quot;The Four Poster&quot; and &quot;The White Sack&quot; – featured in a prison-camp magazine, &quot;Touchstone&quot;, edited by Elliott Viney. A limited edition of one story was printed on a printing press owned by the Bishop of Eichstätt, Michael Rackl.

Boucher and McComas praised the stories in &quot;The Alabaster Hand&quot; as &quot;quietly terrifying modernizations of the M. R. James tradition&quot;.

==Personal life==
Munby&#x27;s first marriage, soon after the arrival of war in 1939, was to Joan Margaret Edelsten. When he was able to return to England in 1945, he was shocked to learn that she had just died. He soon married secondly Sheila Crowther-Smith, a long-standing family friend, and they had a son, Giles Munby.

==Legacy==
Munby built up a major collection of the works of Thomas Babington Macaulay, which he donated during his lifetime to Trinity College, Cambridge. He also accumulated a working collection of 7000–8000 volumes of early bibliography, sale catalogues, and material relating to libraries, the book trade, and connoisseurship, including many rarities: part of this collection (approximately 1800 volumes) was acquired after his death by Cambridge University Library. 

Following his death, a Munby Fellowship in Bibliography was established in Cambridge University Library in his memory, with money subscribed by his friends.

The reading room for rare books in Cambridge University Library is named the Munby Rare Books Reading Room in his memory.

<doc id="917344" wikidata="Q2475967" url="?curid=917344" title="Adrien Albert Marie de Mun">
<text>Adrien Albert Marie, Comte de Mun (, 28 February 18416 October 1914), was a French political figure, nobleman, journalist, and social reformer of the nineteenth century. Born into a noble family de Mun joined the French army at a young age serving during the French conquest of Algeria, the Franco-Prussian War and the suppression of the Paris Commune. A devout Catholic, de Mun became interested in Catholic Social Teaching while he was a prisoner of war in Germany.

After this experience de Mun dedicated himself to advancing the Church&#x27;s teaching in French society and supporting the working class. De Mun&#x27;s created a Catholic Workmen&#x27;s association and later was elected to Chamber of Deputies. In the chamber de Mun was regarded as one its finest orators defending the Church, the army, and the lower classes.

As an advocate of social Catholicism de Mun was initially a Legitimist, before supporting the Third Republic following Pope Leo XIII&#x27;s encyclical &quot;Au milieu des sollicitudes&quot;. De Mun was a key figure in the creation of France&#x27;s modern labor laws during the Third Republic.

==Biography==

===Early years===

Albert was born at Lumigny-Nesles-Ormeaux, Seine-et-Marne, son of the Marquis de Mun. He became a brother-in-law of the Duke of Ursel when his sister Antonine de Mun married him and left to live in Belgium. De Mun&#x27;s great-grandfather was the philosopher Helvetius. His maternal grandfather was Auguste, comte de La Ferronays, foreign minister under Charles X. His aunt was the writer Pauline Marie Armande Craven.

He entered the French Army, saw service in Algeria (1862). In 1869 he received his lieutenant commission from Prince Imperial Louis-Napoléon. In 1870 he took part in the fighting around Metz (during the Franco-Prussian War). On the surrender of Metz, he was sent as a prisoner of war to Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle), where he met René de La Tour du Pin. While in Germany he became aware of and inspired by work the social teachings of Bishop Wilhelm Emmanuel von Ketteler. De Man and du Pin became determined to respond to the dilemmas of the working class upon their release from prison.

After the war he took part in the suppression of the Paris Commune serving on the staff of General Paul de Ladmirault. During the suppression de Mun was appalled by the violence of both forces, impressed by the fervor of the communards, and angered by the indifference of the upper classes to the problems of the working class. Testifying at a parliamentary investigation into the origins of the Commune the Count said:

The following year he and du Pin organized a Catholic Workers&#x27; club, under the name &quot;L&#x27;Oeuvre des Cercles Catholiques d&#x27;Ouvriers&quot; (Society of Catholic Worker Circles), at the request of Maurice Maignen (founder of the Brothers of St. Vincent de Paul). The clubs spread quickly throughout France. These &quot;circles&quot; or clubs brought together the wealthy and the workers from a given locale for prayer, socializing and lectures by members of the aristocracy.

===Politics===
====Legitimist in the Republic==== 

A fervent Roman Catholic, Albert devoted himself to advocating Social Catholicism. His attacks on Third French Republic&#x27;s social policy ultimately gave rise to a prohibition from the Minister of War. He thereupon resigned his commission (November 1875) and in the following February stood as Royalist and Catholic candidate for Pontivy. The influence of the Church was exerted to secure his election and, during the proceedings, he was awarded the Order of Saint Gregory the Great by Pope Pius IX. He won the next elections for the same constituency, but the result was declared invalid. De Mun was re-elected however in the following August and for many years was the most conspicuous leader of the anti-Republican party. &quot;We form&quot;, he said on one occasion, &quot;the irreconcilable Counter-Revolution&quot;.

In March 1876 de Mun delivered his maiden speech in the French assembly. Within a few weeks de Mun established himself as the leading defender of the Church and earning the respect of the anti-clericals with his oratory and strong personality. Soon after de Mun was being called the &quot;Gambetta of the Right&quot; with Gambetta himself praising the young man as another Montalembert. 

In 1878, he had declared himself opposed to universal suffrage, a declaration that lost him his seat from 1879 to 1881. For much of his career de Mun was a committed Legitimist. The Legitimist pretender to the French throne, Henri, Count of Chambord, was godfather to one of the de Mun&#x27;s children. He spoke strongly against the exile of the French princes (after the Count of Paris gave rise to suspicions that he was preparing to claim the throne), and it was chiefly through his influence that the support of the Royalist party was given to Georges Boulanger. 

====Ralliement====
As a faithful Catholic, he obeyed the encyclical of 1892, &quot;Au milieu des sollicitudes&quot;, and declared his readiness to rally to a republican government, provided that it respected religion. In the following January, he received from Leo XIII a letter commending his actions and encouraging him in his social reforms. De Mun&#x27;s embrace of the Republic led to a break with his old friend Édouard Drumont. In Durmont&#x27;s newspaper La Libre Parole the count and Papal Nuncio Cardinal Domenico Ferrata were denounced liked common criminals.

He was defeated at the general election of that year, but in 1894 was elected in Finistère (Morlaix). In 1897, he succeeded Jules Simon as a member of the Académie française, owing to the quality and eloquence of his speeches which, with a few pamphlets, form the bulk of his published work. In &quot;Ma vocation sociale&quot; (1908) he wrote an explanation and justification of his career.

He was also a resolute opponent of Socialism: &quot;Socialism is logical Revolution and we are Counter-Revolution. There is nothing in common between us.&quot; Despite this stance Du Mon occasionally found common ground with the French Workers&#x27; Party who praised his &#x27;integrity and idealism&quot;. In his inaugural parliamentary speech Paul Lafargue, Karl Marx&#x27;s son in law, praised the Count for having &quot;delivered the best socialist speech ever given in this chamber.&quot; Some anti-clerical leftists even suspected an alliance between the POF and the Social Catholic movement.

The social reform de Mun supported included:
*Limiting the working week to 58 hours with all Sundays off
*Banning night work for women
*Four weeks of breaks for women after childbirth
*Abolition of child labor
*Old age pensions
*Accident and Health insurance
*Minimum wages for sweatshops
*Joint arbitration councils
*International agreements on labor legislation.

In 1883 the de Mun spoke in favor of the bill to legalize trade unions in France.

====Dreyfus affair====

The issue of Alfred Dreyfus first came to de Mun&#x27;s attention in May 1897 when Alfred&#x27;s brother, Matthieu Dreyfus, appeared at the Count&#x27;s door to ask for help in reversing his brother&#x27;s court-martial. De Mun was the first person Matthieu went to due his respect for the army and his support for the downtrodden. However, the Count was extremely loyal to the army high command and refused to entertain the idea that they were wrong. The conversation ended with de Mun telling Matthieu &quot;I have nothing to say to you on the subject. 

This loyalty to the army made de Mun one of the leading Anti-Dreyfusard. This was reinforced by his antisemitism believing the Jews were plotting an international conspiracy and casually referred to them as &quot;youtres&quot; (French equivalent of &quot;kikes&quot;).

===Later Years===
In 1896 de Mun denounced the Hamidian massacres against the Armenians by the Ottoman Empire. The Count&#x27;s denouement led him to make common cause with his political rivals Jean Jaurès and Georges Clemenceau, along with the Republican historian Ernest Lavisse. 
In order to form a united front against the anti-clericals between French Catholics de Mun and Jacques Piou formed the Popular Liberal Action party in 1901. Despite ideological and religious differences de Mun was good friends with Prime Minister Louis Barthou.

====The Great War====

Since 1911, de Mun had predicted a coming war against the Triple Alliance with the Balkans being the source of the outbreak. However, exhausted by his work, the last election, and his illness, de Mun was dismissive of the significance of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. By the end of July de Mun was convinced that war was upon the nation, but confident that no Frenchman would hesitate in their duty.

Despite their often-bitter political differences de Mun condemned the Assassination of Jean Jaurès sending a &quot;touching&quot; letter to his widow expressing his condolences. Biographer Benjamin Martin described this as the first step in the formation of the Sacred Union during the First World War. In further support of the Union, after the French chamber voted for war, de Mun crossed the chamber and grasped the hand of socialist Édouard Vaillant a former communard who had never before spoken to the former cavalry officer who had taken part in the suppression of the Commune.

Outside the chamber another of de Mun&#x27;s former enemies Théophile Delcassé, who had engineered France&#x27;s break with the Vatican, was receiving congratulations for success in forging the Entente Cordiale. Upon seeing de Mun among the crowd Delcassé leaned in and asked &quot;And will God be with us too?&quot; to which, de Mun replied &quot;Yes you may rest easy. God forgives, and he takes into account the sacrifices of Catholics. He will grant their prayers.&quot;

During the fighting in Morocco de Mun has lobbied for the restoration of army chaplains. In May 1913 War Minister Eugène Étienne decreed that 4 chapins could be assigned to each army corp. This number was entirely insufficient for the fighting on the Western Front and the troops demanded more. Prime Minister René Viviani responded by authorizing de Mun to recruit 250 priests for service, but without pay and for an indefinite length. De Mun was given an office at the French Red Cross headquarters in Paris. By August 27 the first chaplains&#x27; corps ready and sent to the front with a thousand more priests waiting for the next round of army formations. All expenses were paid by subscriptions to de Mun&#x27;s paper, L&#x27;Echo de Paris, amounting to more than one hundred thousand francs.

At the end of August Poincare urged Viviani to broaden his ministry by bringing in Aristide Briand, Alexandre Millerand, and de Mun. Viviani accepted the first two, but not de Mun. Millerand, with the prime minister&#x27;s support, instead appointed de Mun to oversee the army&#x27;s supply system. De Mun, who was disappointed that his age and health prevented him from rejoining the fight was thrilled by the decision for it allowed him to work directly with the army again. In any case the position effectively made de Mun an unofficial minister. Furthermore, his daily wartime editorials significantly improved morale with the War ministry flooded with messages from soldiers and citizens praising the Count&#x27;s writings. This led the nation to call him the &quot;Minister of Public Confidence&quot;.

Confident in the ultimate victory of Marshal Joffre, de Mun had to be ordered by President Poincare to leave Paris with the rest of the government for Bordeaux. On October 6th after celebrating Joffre&#x27;s counteroffensive and finishing his next editorial de Mun passed away.

==Legacy==
Upon his death Edmond Rostand told his widow &quot;Madam, the souls of the France crowd around your heart.&quot; Pope Benedict XV sent his condolences to the funeral.

De Mun&#x27;s funeral took place on October 10th at Notre Dame de Bordeaux and presided over by Archbishop Pierre Andrieu. In an extraordinary break with precedent President Raymond Poincaré, Prime Minister René Viviani, Delcassé, and the majority of deputies and senators attended the service. At the cemetery Paul Deschanel, speaker of the chamber, in a eulogy called the count &quot;the immortal honor of France&quot;. During the address Poincaré was openly weeping and embraced Deschanel after he finished speaking. Another one by Piou concluded with &quot;He spent his life defending the unpopular, but he died the most popular man in France.&quot;

Prime Minister Louis Barthou said that the count was &quot;the collaborator and even sometimes the precursor of all the great labor laws of the Republic.&quot; Charles De Gaulle was influenced by the Count&#x27;s political views. American historian Barbara Tuchman called him a &quot;sincere and honorable man of lofty ideals&quot;

<text>Lawrence Quincy Mumford (11 December 1903 – 15 August 1982) was an American librarian. He was the eleventh Librarian of the United States Congress from 1954 to 1974.

==Biography==
Mumford was born in Hanrahan, North Carolina, to Jacob Edward Mumford, a tobacco farmer, and Emma Luvenia Stocks. He grew up working the farm alongside his 10 siblings when he was not in school. He attended Grifton High School where he excelled in debate winning school and district honors. Mumford also participated in school athletics where he played baseball and tennis.

Upon graduation, Mumford was granted a tuition scholarship to attend Trinity College in Durham, North Carolina; his educational goal focused on preparing for a teaching career. At Trinity College, Mumford followed the lead of his brother Grover and joined the Hesperian Society. As a member he continued to be active in debate, winning several distinguished awards for excellence in public speaking and debate. In addition to his oratory skills, Mumford began to hone his leadership skills in the society and over his undergraduate career eventually became president of the Hesperian Society. Outside of the society, Mumford participated in the Physics Club, Phi Beta Kappa, and acted in two dramatic productions on top of working in the library as a student assistant. He graduated magna cum laude in 1925.

College Librarian Joseph Penn Breedlove offered Mumford a full-time position and he accepted so that he could continue to work towards a master&#x27;s degree that would help with his dreams of a teaching career. Mumford completed his Master&#x27;s in English in the spring of 1928, but was at this point persuaded by assistant librarian, Louis T. Ibbotson, to go back to school and get a Bachelor of Library Science degree at the School of Library Science, Columbia University, New York.

In the fall of 1928, Mumford entered the School of Library Science, where he was able to work part-time in the library proper while completing his education. In the spring of 1929, he was offered a position with the New York Public Library (NYPL) as a reference assistant. Shortly afterwards, Mumford met Permelia Catherine Stevens, a children&#x27;s librarian for the NYPL system, and they were married on October 4, 1930, and had one child, a daughter, Katheryn Mumford.

Mumford spent 16 years with the New York Public Library. Starting as a reference assistant, he soon rose to take on more administrative duties. Advancing from reference to general administrative assistant, he then became chief of the cataloguing division. After a short loan to the Library of Congress where he overhauled their processing department, he returned to take up duties as the chief of preparations and ended up as the coordinator of general public services before he left in 1945 to join the Cleveland Public Library system (CPL).

Mumford spent five years as assistant director of the CPL and became director in 1950. He was director until 1954 when he took on the helm of Librarian of Congress. His time spent at the CPL can be marked by improved growth (financially and physically) and increased public awareness and support.

In addition to his duties at the NYPL and CPL, Mumford joined the American Library Association in 1932 and became increasingly active in the association. His efforts with various ALA committees and his work with the Film Council of America and the Great Books Foundation led to his nomination and selection as President of the American Library Association in 1954. His inaugural address to ALA clearly speaks of his commitment to Library Service:

The task ahead is to offer the opportunity for continuing education through life, to enlarge the means of access to books through an ever-broadening pattern of facilities and services. The task ahead is to provide the materials and resources of education for better living, to help people to become more proficient in their chosen fields of work, balanced and enriched in their private lives, to the end that they may bring their skills and humanity to the service of society as a whole.
We should not lose sight of the fact that maintaining man&#x27;s right to knowledge and freedom to choose his reading is an empty achievement if we do not make available to him the material from which he can select and choose ... Freedom to read is an academic right, important as a principle, but meaningless in effect unless library resources are made available to those who lack them.

Mumford spent a year as ALA President and during this time helped to streamline management of the association and oversaw the establishment of the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award for substantial and lasting contributions to literature for children.

Two months after Mumford&#x27;s inauguration as president of the ALA, he began his 20-year tenure as the first professionally trained Librarian of Congress. Mumford was nominated by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on April 22, 1954, and was confirmed by the Senate on July 29, 1954. He was sworn into office using the 1782 Aiken Bible (the first complete bible printed in English in the independent United States) and officially began his first day on September 1, 1954.

The years prior to Mumford&#x27;s appointment reveal hampered library relationships with the United States Congress; appropriations were down and Congress felt that the Library of Congress was no longer serving its needs. In addition, new information and technology were placing ever-growing demands on the services of the library.

As Librarian of Congress, Mumford was able to use his oratorical skills to repair vital relationships, rebuild Congressional confidence in the library and gain much needed appropriations to improve functions and programming. During the first ten years of his appointment appropriations more than doubled, the case for more space (a new building) was developed and put before the Joint Committee on the Library, work was started in the development of cataloging in publication and research was completed on machine-readable cataloging systems; Public Law 480 was established and helped bring about international cataloging standards.

In his personal life, Mumford&#x27;s wife, Permelia died in 1961. Mumford later married Mrs. Betsy Perrin Fox on November 28, 1969.

During the last half of his Librarianship, Mumford saw much of his effort and many of the programs he had implemented come to fruition. The most notable being the construction of the James Madison Memorial Building that was started in 1971 and completed in 1980. Other achievements include a ninefold total increase in appropriations, the establishment of the National Program for Acquisitions and Cataloging (NPAC), completion and distribution of the Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC) system, an increase in services for handicapped readers, expansion of legislative research into the more dedicated Congressional Research Service, final publication of the Pre-1956 National Union Catalog, completion of the Presidential Papers Program, development of preservation programs and the establishment of the Preservation Research Laboratory, the expansion of motion picture programs, the addition of an African section and a Children&#x27;s Book section, development of National Referral Center for Science and Technology, the establishment of the American Revolution Bicentennial Office and the development of the Affirmative Action Plan that provided for equality, training and scholarship of Library of Congress staff.

Mumford died on August 15, 1982, in Washington, D.C.

<doc id="917355" wikidata="Q797911" url="?curid=917355" title="High-intensity training">
<text>High-intensity training (HIT) is a form of strength training popularized in the 1970s by Arthur Jones, the founder of Nautilus. The training focuses on performing quality weight training repetitions to the point of momentary muscular failure. The training takes into account the number of repetitions, the amount of weight, and the amount of time the muscle is exposed to tension in order to maximize the amount of muscle fiber recruitment.

==Principles==

Unlike traditional workout routines that emphasize long hours in the gym, HIT principles require short but highly intense workouts. Exercises are performed with a high level of effort, or intensity, where it is thought that it will stimulate the body to produce an increase in muscular strength and size. Advocates of HIT believe that this method is superior for strength and size building to most other methods which, for example, may stress lower weights with larger volume (sets x reps x weight).

As strength improves with high-intensity training (HIT), the weight or resistance used in the exercises should be gradually increased over time. This progressive overload is believed to provide the muscles with enough stimulus to continue improving and growing. An inverse relationship exists between how intensely and how long one can exercise. As a result, high-intensity workouts are generally kept brief. After a high-intensity workout, as with any workout, the body requires time to recover and produce the responses stimulated during the workout, so there is more emphasis on rest and recovery in the HIT philosophy than in most other weight training methods. In any workout, not just HIT, training schedules should allow adequate time between workouts for recovery (and adaptation).

While many typical HIT programs comprise a single-set per exercise, tri-weekly, full-body workout, many variations exist in specific recommendations of set and exercise number, workout routines, volume and frequency of training. The common thread is an emphasis on a high level of effort, relatively brief and infrequent (i.e. not daily) training, and the cadence of a lift, which will be very slow compared to a non-HIT weight training routine.

Most HIT advocates stress the use of controlled lifting speeds and strict form, with special attention paid to avoiding any bouncing, jerking, or yanking of the weight or machine movement arm during exercise. Technical HIT advice varies from lifting the weights smoothly and at a natural pace, to timing the lifts, peaking at hold and descent. In extreme cases, like Ellington Darden PhD&#x27;s 30/30/30 protocol, it may take up to 60 seconds to complete a single repetition.

Also emphasized when near exhaustion in order to further exhaust the muscle or muscles exercised: doing static holds for periods of time, and negative reps (lowering the weight). Some believe this will stimulate further growth and strength because muscles are weakest in positive/contracting movements (sometimes referred to as first-stage failure of a muscle). Although you may not be able to lift a weight for another rep you will almost certainly be able to hold it statically for a further period (second stage of failure) and finally lower a weight at a slow controlled speed (third stage of failure). Until all three (lifting, holding and lowering) parts of an exercise can no longer be completed in a controlled manner, a muscle cannot be considered thoroughly exhausted/exercised .

==Antecedents and Controversies==
A large number of skeptics dispute the methods and results claimed by HIT advocates. Some of the criticism asserts that HIT violates much conventional &quot;wisdom&quot; in weight training. By always using a weight that one can lift 8-12 times, using 4 second negatives, and so on, it has flown in the face of the exercise establishment.

There exists also an issue related to the development of HIT and its originality. Near the close of the 19th century, a medical doctor by the name of Gustav Zander developed a complete set of machines and a workout method remarkably close to that promoted by inventor and HIT enthusiast Arthur Jones in the early 1970s. Jones acknowledged Zander stating:

So, in attempts to improve my exercise results, I designed and built a total of about twenty very sophisticated exercise machines, then believing that these were the first exercise machines ever built by anybody. But many years later, I learned that a doctor named Gustav Zander had designed and built a number of exercise machines in Europe nearly a hundred years before I built my first one; I did not copy Zander&#x27;s work and learned nothing from him, was not even aware of his work until long after I had made the same discoveries that he had made. But if I had known about, and understood, Zander&#x27;s work, it would have saved me a lot of time and a rather large fortune in money, because the man was a genius; his only problem was that he lived about a century ahead of his time, at a time when very few people cared about exercise and even fewer knew anything about it.

Regardless of who originally developed the systems (and machines) it is clear that through Arthur Jones and his company and a crew of HIT advocates, the principles and concepts of HIT became popularized.

==HIT and other training routines==

HIT workouts usually include one set of one or two exercises per muscle group, performed to the point of momentary muscle failure. The recommended repetition ranges vary, with most being from as low as 3-5 to as high as 15-20. Lower repetition ranges are often recommended for upper body exercises, while higher repetition ranges are often recommended for the lower body, lower back, abs, and neck.

The recommended repetition speeds are often relatively slow, but not always Super Slow. Nautilus inventor Arthur Jones originally recommended a 2/1/4 cadence; a two-second positive movement, a one-second hold at the end point, and a four-second negative. Later, Jones, Mike Mentzer, and others would recommend performing the positive more slowly, reducing the cadence to 4/1/4 or 4/2/4. Some HIT methods involve even slower repetition cadences, like Ken Hutchins&#x27; SuperSlow, with a ten-second positive, ten-second negative, and a two to three-second hold at the end point on some compound pulling and simple movements, but not compound pushing movements, and Ellington Darden PhD&#x27;s 30/30/30 method, consisting of a 30-second negative, a 30-second positive, and another 30 second negative.

HIT stresses intensity over repetition. Many weightlifters will use a HIT routine to help break a &#x27;plateau&#x27; - meaning they will use HIT temporarily when another routine stops giving desired results. Some HIT trainees will use HIT exclusively as well - Arthur Jones believed HIT was all that was required.

Different strength training authors from Ellington Darden and Mike Mentzer to Dorian Yates and Gordon LaVelle have called their system HIT, with each individual having credited Arthur Jones for the formulation of its basic tenet principles. However, there has never been a clear and consistent guideline on how to utilize HIT. Darden advocated full body routines, while Yates recommended to split the workouts into four different sessions a week. Mentzer believed that no more than one set to muscular failure per body part was all that was required, yet Yates and LaVelle believed that more than one exercise per body part is necessary to get complete development as a bodybuilder.

==Rest-pause==
A former Mr. Universe, the late Mike Mentzer achieved his lifetime best condition from performing rest-pause, an old system of lifting involving single-rep maxima interspersed with brief (10 second) rest periods. Rest-pause has the advantages of old-school power training while also allowing for enough overall reps to be performed for hypertrophy and cardiovascular exercise purposes.

<text>Ethel Watts Mumford (1876/1878 – 1940) was an American author from New York City. The surname Mumford came from her first husband, George D. Mumford, a lawyer (married 1894–1901).

After her first husband grew intolerant of her prolific writing and art career, she fled to San Francisco in 1899 with their only child, a son. She sued for divorce on grounds of desertion. After the divorce was granted in 1901, she returned to New York, vowing never to remarry unless her husband accepted her career. On June 4, 1906, she married Peter Geddes Grant of Grantown, Morayshire, Scotland.

The daughter of a wealthy businessman, she was given a fine education, topped by her study of painting at the Julian Academy of Paris. She traveled extensively in Europe, the Far East, and North America, experience that is well-reflected in her work.

Most of her early published works were written in San Francisco including her first novel, &quot;Dupes&quot;. She was a heavy producer of plays, vaudeville sketches, novels, short stories, joke collections, songs, poems, and articles. She also painted and illustrated books. 

In her teen years, after studying dramatic technique by reading 2,000 manuscripts, she turned to playwriting. Her farces were produced on New York and London stages. After her 1906 marriage she wrote for a time under the name &quot;Ethel Watts Mumford Grant,&quot; adding her second husband&#x27;s name, but eventually reverted to &quot;Ethel Watts Mumford&quot; as a byline.

<doc id="917363" wikidata="Q1218888" url="?curid=917363" title="Love and Death">
<text>Love and Death is a 1975 American comedy film written and directed by Woody Allen. It is a satire on Russian literature starring Allen and Diane Keaton as Boris and Sonja, Russians living during the Napoleonic Era who engage in mock-serious philosophical debates. Allen considered it the funniest film he had made up until that point.

==Plot==
About to be executed for a crime he never committed, Boris Grushenko recalls how he got into his present predicament. Initially scheduled to die at 5:00 am, Boris receives leniency—a delay in execution until 6:00 am.

Ivan, Mikhail, and Boris are three brothers grown to “full manhood,” with Ivan and Mikhail brawny and athletic, and Boris a scrawny 5&#x27;6&quot;. Since childhood, Boris has been in love with his cousin Sonja, with whom he has deep conversations. Sonja: &quot;To love is to suffer. To avoid suffering one must not love, but then one suffers from not loving. Therefore, to love is to suffer, not to love is to suffer, to suffer is to suffer. To be happy is to love, to be happy then is to suffer but suffering makes one unhappy; therefore, to be unhappy one must love or love to suffer or suffer from too much happiness. I hope you&#x27;re getting this down.&quot;

Sonja tells Boris that she yearns for a man who embodies her three essentials of love: intellectuality, spirituality, and sensuality. Thinking that she is confessing her love for him, Boris is devastated when Sonja says she has been in love with Ivan all her life. Boris: &quot;Ivan can barely write his name in the ground with a stick.&quot;

When Ivan announces that he intends to marry Anna Ivanova, a desolate Sonja immediately announces that she will marry Sergei Minskov, 81. Excited, Minskov immediately dies from a heart attack. Sonja then marries Leonid Boskovic, the herring merchant, who amuses himself with herring while Sonya dallies with a musician.

When Napoleon invades Austria during the Napoleonic Wars, Boris, a coward and pacifist, is forced to enlist in the Russian army. Boris doesn’t believe in fighting for “Mother Russia.” Boris’s Mother: &quot;I hope they put him in the front lines!&quot;

Boris completes military training, including a “hygiene play” on condoms and venereal disease. On furlough, Boris flirts at the opera with the beautiful Countess Alexandrovna, whose current lover has killed several men in duels. Countess: &quot;You’re the greatest lover I ever had.&quot; Boris: &quot;I practice a lot when I’m alone.&quot;

Unhappy in her marriage, Sonja recounts a long list of lovers. Boris offers to take her away, but Sonja asks after Ivan. When Boris tells her he is going to the front the next day, Sonja bids Boris, “have a nice time!” Boris inadvertently becomes a war hero when he falls asleep inside a large cannon and is fired into the French command tent, killing the officers. The regiment that started with 12,000 men in battle thins down to 14 survivors; a message from the Czar encourages, “keep up the good work.” Ivan, a battle fatality, is bayonetted to death by a &quot;Polish conscientious objector.&quot;

A Turkish cavalry officer impugns Sonja’s chastity. Boskovic dies accidentally while cleaning his pistol in preparation for a duel to defend her honor. Sonja laments she wasn’t kinder to him—perhaps even having sex with him once.

The Countess’s lover, Anton Lebedokov, challenges Boris to a duel. Boris returns and proposes to the widowed Sonja, who promises to marry him, thinking he will be killed in the duel. To her surprise and dejection, Boris survives the duel. Their marriage is filled with philosophical debates. Sonja: &quot;Sex without love is an empty experience.&quot; Boris: &quot;Yes, but as empty experiences go, it’s tough to beat.&quot; As time passes, he wins Sonja’s heart.

Sonja conceives a plot to assassinate Napoleon at his headquarters in Moscow. They debate the matter with philosophical doublespeak, and Boris reluctantly agrees. At an inn en route to Moscow, they encounter Don Francisco and his sister, emissaries from Joseph Bonaparte to Napoleon. Boris and Sonya waylay the Spaniards, taking their place. Unknowingly, they meet with Napoleon’s double, who attempts to seduce Sonja but is knocked out by her after Boris fails various attempts. Over the unconscious body, Sonya and Boris debate the ethics of killing Napoleon. While Boris vacillates, another intended Napoleon assassin shoots the double.

Sonja escapes arrest, but Boris is captured. Despite being told by a vision that he will be pardoned, Boris is executed. Boris&#x27;s ghost bids Sonja and the audience goodbye before dancing away with Death.

==Cast==
==Production==
Allen shot the film in France and Hungary, where he had to deal with unfavorable weather, spoiled negatives, food poisoning, physical injuries and communication difficulties. Consequently, he swore never to shoot a film outside the United States again. However, starting in 1996 with &quot;Everyone Says I Love You&quot;, Allen did in fact shoot a number of films abroad.

==Style==
Coming between Allen&#x27;s &quot;Sleeper&quot; (1973) and &quot;Annie Hall&quot; (1977), &quot;Love and Death&quot; is in many respects an artistic transition between the two. Allen pays tribute to the humor of The Marx Brothers, Bob Hope and Charlie Chaplin throughout the film.

The dialogue and scenarios parody Russian novels, particularly those by Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy, such as &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;, &quot;The Gambler&quot;, &quot;The Idiot&quot; and &quot;War and Peace&quot;. This includes a dialogue between Boris and his father in which each line alludes to, or is composed entirely of, Dostoyevsky titles.

The use of Prokofiev on the soundtrack adds to the Russian flavor of the film. Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Troika&quot; from the &quot;Lieutenant Kijé Suite&quot; is featured prominently, for the film&#x27;s opening and closing credits and in selected scenes in the film when a &quot;bouncy&quot; theme is required. The battle scene is accompanied with music from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;Alexander Nevsky&quot; cantata. Boris is marched to his execution to the &quot;March&quot; from Prokofiev&#x27;s &quot;The Love for Three Oranges&quot;.

Some of the humor is straightforward; other jokes rely on the viewer&#x27;s awareness of classic literature or contemporary European cinema. For example, the final shot of Keaton is a reference to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Persona&quot;. The sequence with the stone lions is a parody of Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s &quot;Battleship Potemkin&quot;, while the Russian battle against Napoleon&#x27;s army heavily parodies the same film&#x27;s &quot;Odessa steps&quot; sequence. Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; is parodied several times, including during the climax.

==Reception==

The film grossed $20.1 million in North America, making it the 18th highest grossing picture of 1975 in North America (theatrical rentals were $5 million).
On Rotten Tomatoes, 25 out of 25 critics gave the film a positive rating, with a 100% rating and an average rating of 9.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Woody Allen plunks his neurotic persona into a Tolstoy pastiche and yields one of his funniest films, brimming with slapstick ingenuity and a literary inquiry into subjects as momentous as &quot;Love and Death&quot;&quot;. 

Roger Ebert gave it three and a half stars and wrote: &quot;Miss Keaton is very good in &quot;Love and Death&quot;, perhaps because here she gets to establish and develop a character, instead of just providing a foil, as she&#x27;s often done in other Allen films ... There are dozens of little moments when their looks have to be exactly right, and they almost always are. There are shadings of comic meaning that could have gotten lost if all we had were the words, and there are whole scenes that play off facial expressions. It&#x27;s a good movie to watch just for that reason, because it&#x27;s been done with such care, love and lunacy.&quot;

Gene Siskel awarded a full four stars and wrote: &quot;Woody Allen is simply terrific in &quot;Love and Death&quot;. To my mind, it&#x27;s his funniest film. He plays to his greatest strength (gag line dialog) and stays away from what has limited his other movies (an attempt to develop a story).&quot; Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;Woody Allen&#x27;s grandest work&quot; and &quot;side-splitting.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared: &quot;Thin but likable just about sums it up.&quot; Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found the film &quot;funny with remarkable and delightful consistency.&quot; Penelope Gilliatt of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; thought that Woody Allen and Diane Keaton &quot;have become an unbeatable new team at pacing haywire intellectual backchat. Their style works as if each of them were a less mock-assertive Groucho Marx with a duplicate of him to play against. For such a recklessly funny film, the impression is weirdly serene.&quot; Geoff Brown of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;the occasional longueurs and dud jokes never prove fatal to the movie&#x27;s overall success; to use the description Boris applies to his father, Woody Allen is a &#x27;major loon&#x27; and &quot;Love and Death&quot; provides a fine showcase for his talent.&quot;
Comedian and filmmaker Bill Hader talked about his appreciation of the film, having listed it as one of his favorite films saying: &quot;I love Diane Keaton in this movie so much. My first real movie crush. It&#x27;s nonstop jokes, but it&#x27;s played very real and loose, and it has the starkness of a Bergman movie! It&#x27;s insane, yet it completely works.&quot;

===Accolades ===
At the 25th Berlin International Film Festival in 1975, the film won the Silver Bear for outstanding artistic contribution.

In September 2008, in a poll held by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, the film was voted as the 301st greatest film out of a list of 500. In October 2013, the film was voted by the &quot;Guardian&quot; readers as the seventh-best film directed by Woody Allen.

<doc id="917368" wikidata="Q2398355" url="?curid=917368" title="Carryduff">
<text>Carryduff () is a small town and townland in County Down, Northern Ireland, about south of Belfast city centre. It had a population of 7,173 people in the 2021 census.
Most of the settlement lies within the townland of Carryduff, although part of it extends into the neighbouring townlands of Killynure and Mealough.

==History==
One of the earliest references to the settlement dates from 1622, where its anglicised name is written as &quot;Carrow-Hugh-Duffe&quot;. The original village formed where six roads and a river crossed, and is the site of the ancient Queen&#x27;s Fort Rath. The road south from Belfast (the A24) climbs out of a gap in the Castlereagh Hills, and splits at Carryduff, one fork (the A7) continuing to Downpatrick (via Saintfield and Crossgar), the other fork (A24) continuing via Ballynahinch to Newcastle towards Kilkeel. In addition, the road from the Ards Peninsula, Newtownards and Comber (the B178) crosses here en route to Hillsborough in the west. All six roads cross the small Carryduff River here (which flows northwards to eventually join the River Lagan at Minnowburn).

The Knockbracken Reservoir was constructed for the Belfast Water Commissioners and opened in 1901, the same year as the Mourne Conduit which carried water from the Kilkeel and Annalong rivers (and later the Silent Valley Reservoir) to Carryduff where it was transported on to Belfast. The Mourne Conduit was replaced by the Aquarius pipeline and associated infrastructure between 1999 and 2004. This new pipeline was laid to the east and north of Carryduff, crossing the A24 at Brackenvale, and bypassing the Knockbracken Reservoir.

The road connections with and proximity to Belfast meant that the town saw some overspill development, from the city, in the 1960s. This period saw several housing developments, the construction of the &quot;Town and Country Shopping Centre&quot;, and Carryduff Primary School, leading into the 1970s with the building of the Killynure housing estate by the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Development along one side of the northbound A24 took place adjacent to the Immaculate Heart of Mary Roman Catholic Church and St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School, with the Knockbracken Reservoir on the other side.

The 1980s saw expansion continue with Carryduff becoming a commuter town for Belfast workers. Developments continued into the 1990s and included Carryduff Library, Carryduff Shopping Centre. These developments saw the Carryduff River placed inside a culvert for much of its journey through the town. Very little green belt land now remains between Carryduff and the southern border of Belfast, the 1980s having seen the former Matthew Stop Line breached.

In 2018, the disused Knockbracken reservoir became Ireland&#x27;s largest aqua park, offering a range of water based activities.

==Demography==
=== 2021 census ===
The population of Carryduff on census day (21 March 2021) was 7,173 people. Of these:

==Sport==

===Gaelic games===
The local Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club is Carryduff GAC. It was initially formed in 1971, when a group of parents, concerned at the lack of playing facilities in the area, formed a schoolboys Gaelic football team. Within a couple of years, a full GAA club had come into being with a team entered in the East Down League. Carryduff has had a number county players over the years with Greg Blaney, Neil Collins, Mark McCartan and John Kelly featuring in the All-Ireland winning Down county football teams of the 1990s.

===Running===
Carryduff Running Club, which was founded in 2022, is affiliated with Athletics NI. The club also runs a free non-member based &quot;Couch to 5k&quot; program as well as weekly organised runs.

===Association football===
Carryduff also has 2 local men&#x27;s football teams who all play from Lough Moss pitches in the town, they are Carryduff Colts F.C. and Carryduff Athletic F.C.

==Churches==
The Catholic parish of Drumbo was erected in late 1943 by Bishop Daniel Mageean in response to an offer of land from Mr Patrick Mallon as the site for a church. After the Belfast Blitz an influx of Belfast families to the area coupled with the arrival of US troops increased the Catholic population.

On 30 June 1946 a new church, under the dedication of the Immaculate Heart of Mary was opened and blessed by Bishop Daniel Mageean. The sermonist was Cardinal Cahal Daly. Nine years later on 9th Jan 1955 St Joseph&#x27;s Primary School began to educate pupils on a site adjacent to the church.

<doc id="917384" wikidata="Q655304" url="?curid=917384" title="Nyarubuye massacre">
<text>The Nyarubuye massacre is the name which is given to the killing of an estimated 20,000 civilians on April 15, 1994 at the Nyarubuye Roman Catholic Church in Kibungo Province, east of the Rwandan capital Kigali. The victims were Tutsis. Men, women, and children were reported to have been indiscriminately killed, with the attackers allegedly using spears, machetes, clubs, hand grenades and automatic weapons. Local Interahamwe, acting in concert with the authorities, used bulldozers to knock down the church building. The militia used machetes and rifles to kill every person who tried to escape.

The massacre was part of the April–July 1994 Rwandan genocide in which up to 1,000,000 people died.

== Trial and convictions ==
On 3 December 2003 a Rwandan court in Rukira, Kibungo found 18 people guilty of genocide crimes. Gitera Rwamuhizi, a leader of the group responsible for the killings, was sentenced to life imprisonment, and after pleading guilty the sentence was dropped to 25 years. The rest were sentenced to terms ranging from 7 to 16 years.

The mayor of Rusumo, Sylvestre Gacumbitsi, was found guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity (for rape and extermination) by the trial chamber of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in 2004, and sentenced to life imprisonment.

== Aftermath ==
In the aftermath of the massacre, the location was visited by BBC journalist Fergal Keane who made the story internationally known. One girl he met at a nearby hospital was 13-year-old Valentina Iribagiza who had seen her family killed and survived in the church for more than 43 days before being rescued. Three years later Keane went back to interview her, and the documentary &quot;Valentina&#x27;s Nightmare: A Journey into the Genocide Against The Tutsi&quot; was broadcast on the series &quot;Frontline&quot; in April 1997. She was also featured in the &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary &quot;Ghosts of Rwanda&quot;
 which was broadcast in 2004, marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre.

The church and houses of the nuns and priest where the victims took refuge are home to the Nyarubuye Genocide Memorial Site.

<text>The Mariinsky Theatre (, also transcribed as Maryinsky or Mariyinsky) is a historic opera house in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Opened in 1860, it became the preeminent music theatre of late 19th-century Russia, where many of the stage masterpieces of Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and Rimsky-Korsakov received their premieres. Through most of the Soviet era, it was known as the Kirov Theatre. Today, the Mariinsky Theatre is home to the Mariinsky Ballet, Mariinsky Opera and Mariinsky Orchestra. Since Yuri Temirkanov&#x27;s retirement in 1988, the conductor Valery Gergiev has served as the theatre&#x27;s general director.

==Name==
The theatre is named after Empress Maria Alexandrovna, wife of Tsar Alexander II. There is a bust of the Empress in the main entrance foyer. The theatre&#x27;s name has changed throughout its history, reflecting the political climate of the time:

* 1860 – 1920: Imperial Mariinsky Theatre ()
* 1920 – 1924: State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet ()
* 1924 – 1935: Leningrad State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet ()
* 1935 – 1992: Kirov State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet () (one of numerous places and institutions named or renamed at that time for Sergei Kirov)
* 1992 – present: State Academic Mariinsky Theatre ()

&quot;Note: The acronym &quot;GATOB&quot; (Gosudarstvennïy Akademicheskiy Teatr Operï i Baleta) is often encountered in historical accounts.&quot;

The theatre building is commonly called the &quot;Mariinsky Theatre&quot;. The companies that operate within it have for brand recognition purposes retained the &quot;Kirov&quot; name, acquired during the Soviet era to commemorate the assassinated Leningrad Communist Party leader Sergey Kirov (1886–1934).

==Origins==

The Imperial drama, opera and ballet troupe in Saint Petersburg was established in 1783, at the behest of Catherine the Great, although an Italian ballet troupe had performed at the Russian court since the early 18th century. 

A permanent theatre building for the new company of opera and ballet artists was designed by Antonio Rinaldi and opened in 1783. Known as the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, the structure was situated on Carousel Square, which was renamed Theatre Square in honour of the building. Both names &quot;Kamenny&quot; (Russian word for &quot;stone&quot;) and &quot;Bolshoi&quot; (Russian word for &quot;big&quot;) were coined to distinguish it from the wooden Little Theatre. In 1836, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was renovated to a design by Albert Cavos (son of Catterino Cavos, an opera composer), and served as the principal theatre of the Imperial Ballet and opera.

On 29 January 1849, the Equestrian circus (Конный цирк) opened on Theatre Square. This was also the work of the architect Cavos. The building was designed to double as a theatre.

==Leading role==
The Imperial Mariinsky Theatre and its predecessor, the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, hosted the premieres of many of the operas of Mikhail Glinka, Modest Mussorgsky, and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. At the behest of the theatre director Ivan Vsevolozhsky, both the Imperial Ballet (ballet arrived at the Mariinsky theater in 1870) and the Imperial Opera were relocated to the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, as the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre was considered unsafe.

Other world premieres given at the house included Mussorgsky&#x27;s opera &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; in 1874, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s operas &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; in 1890 and &quot;Iolanta&quot; in 1892, the revised version of Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; in 1940, and Khachaturian&#x27;s ballet &quot;Spartacus&quot; in 1956. Other notable productions included Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;The Golden Cockerel&quot; in 1909 and Prokofiev&#x27;s ballet &quot;Cinderella&quot; in 1946 (with Natalya Dudinskaya).

The imperial and Soviet theater was the home of numerous impresarios, conductors, and musicians.

Conductors: Mikhail Zhukov (1932–35), Israel Chudnovsky and others.

Ballet: The ballet school of the Mariinsky Theatre spawned the careers of artists Mathilde Kschessinskaya, Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky, and George Balanchine, students of the Imperial Ballet School and style, and, under and after the teachings of Agrippina Vaganova, artists Marina Semyonova, Galina Ulanova, Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Irina Kolpakova, Galina Mezentseva, Altynai Asylmuratova, as well as more recent dancers of renown Ulyana Lopatkina, Diana Vishneva, and Svetlana Zakharova, students of the school as now named, the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet.

==The Mariinsky Theatre today==

Under Yuri Temirkanov, Principal Conductor from 1976 to 1988, the Opera Company continued to stage innovative productions of both modern and classic Russian operas. 

In April 2022, resident conductor Gavriel Heine, a protégé of Gergiev, resigned from the theater in part because of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.

===Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall===
The nearby Mariinsky Theatre Concert Hall, designed by French architect, Xavier Fabre, opened in spring 2007.

==Mariinsky Theatre Second Stage==


The Canadian firm Diamond and Schmitt Architects, along with its local partner KB ViPS Architects, designed a new building, then to be named The Second Stage, with 1,830 seats, which would complement the existing Mariinsky. Construction began in 2003, following a different design by French architect Jean Nouvel that was halted at the sub-basement level. The new design team took over in 2009. The completion of Mariinsky II was predicted to result in Saint Petersburg&#x27;s equivalent of New York City&#x27;s Lincoln Center.

Construction was completed in May 2013, at a price of 500 million euros.

==The Mariinsky record label==

In 2009, the Mariinsky Theatre launched its own record label, managed by the same team that run the LSO Live label in London. 

Among the titles that have been released are:

Rachmaninov: Piano Concerto No 3 / Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini performed by Denis Matsuev, conducted by Valery Gergiev Mariinsky Label Website

<text>Dame Katherine Jane Grainger (born 12 November 1975) is a Scottish former rower and current Chair of UK Sport. She is a 2012 Summer Olympics gold medallist, four-time Olympic silver medallist and six-time World Champion for Great Britain. She served as Chancellor of Oxford Brookes University between 2015 and 2020 and is currently Chancellor of the University of Glasgow.

Grainger first won silver at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 in the woman&#x27;s quadruple sculls. In Athens in 2004, she won silver in the coxless pairs. In Beijing 2008 she won her third silver, again in the quadruple sculls.

At the London Olympics 2012, Anna Watkins and Grainger broke the Olympic record as they qualified for the double sculls final, before winning the gold medal. Grainger won a silver medal at the Rio Olympic Games 2016 with Victoria Thornley, after a two-year break from the sport. Grainger won eight medals at the World Championship between 1997 and 2011.

==Early life and education==
Born in Glasgow in 1975, she attended Mosshead Primary School prior to attending Bearsden Academy in East Dunbartonshire near Glasgow. Grainger&#x27;s family later moved to Netherley, Aberdeenshire.

Grainger holds a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) from the University of Edinburgh, a Master of Philosophy (MPhil) in Medical Law and Medical Ethics from the University of Glasgow, and a Doctor of Philosophy in law from King&#x27;s College London. Her doctoral research (on &quot;the genesis and challenges of the whole life order, introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, under which those sentenced face life-long incarceration with no possibility of release&quot;) was supervised by Elaine Player and Ben Bowling. In July 2013, King&#x27;s made Grainger a fellow. She remarked, &quot;Without planning it both my Olympic career and my PhD have met at the same time and the culmination for both is 2012 – not by design.&quot;

==Career==

===Rowing===
Grainger took up rowing at the University of Edinburgh in 1993 and represented Edinburgh&#x27;s St Andrew Boat Club and/or Marlow Rowing Club in rowing events. She trained on the River Dee.

She first won silver at Sydney in 2000 in the woman&#x27;s quadruple sculls with Guin Batten, Gillian Lindsay and Miriam Batten losing to a German team. Four years later in Athens in 2004, she won silver again when she took part in the coxless pairs with Cath Bishop, losing to Georgeta Damian and Viorica Susanu of Romania. She returned to the quadruple sculls in Beijing 2008, when she won her third silver with Annabel Vernon, Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton, narrowly losing to China after taking the lead for some of the race. On 3 August 2012, she won an Olympic gold medal at London in the double sculls with Anna Watkins. At the 2016 Olympics, she won a silver medal in double sculls with Vicky Thornley.

Grainger has won eight medals at the World Championships. The first of these was a bronze in 1997 in the eight, then a gold with Bishop in 2003, a gold in 2005 with the quadruple scull, with Houghton, Sarah Winckless, and Rebecca Romero, and in 2006 her quadruple scull was promoted to gold following a drugs test on the winning Russian crew. This quad had Debbie Flood instead of Romero, who had retired after the 2005 world championships.

Another gold came in 2007, again in the quadruple sculls, with Annabel Vernon replacing the injured Sarah Winckless. In 2009, having switched to the single scull after the Beijing Olympics, Grainger claimed a surprise silver at the World Championships in Poland. In 2010, Grainger teamed up with Anna Watkins in the double sculls and they embarked on an unbeaten season, culminating in victory in November in the World Championships in Lake Karapiro, New Zealand, and then defending the title in an injury disrupted season in 2011 in Bled, Slovenia.

She has won the Rowing World Cup in the quadruple sculls in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2010 and the double sculls in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

On 14 March 2015, Grainger was part of the composite crew that won the Women&#x27;s Eights Head of the River Race on the River Thames in London, setting a time of 18:58.6 for the 4 1⁄4-mile (6.8 km) championship course from Mortlake to Putney. Her GB rowing team senior final trials results include:
*2015 - 2nd, Single Scull
*2012 – 1st, Single Scull
*2011 – 2nd, Single Scull
*2004–2010 – 1st, Single Scull
*2001 – 1st, Double Scull
*1998 – 1st, Single Scull
Following retirement, Grainger also regularly raced at the HOCR in Boston in a &#x27;Director&#x27;s Challenge Mixed 8&#x27; made up of a crew containing several past rowing Olympians and in 2019 they placed 1st in this event.

=== Administration===
In April 2017, Grainger was appointed chair of UK Sport. She was reappointed for a second term on 1 July 2021. In March 2015, Grainger was appointed the fourth chancellor of Oxford Brookes University, at a ceremony joined by her three predecessors, Shami Chakrabarti CBE, Jon Snow and Baroness Helena Kennedy QC.

On 28 November 2024 it was announced that Grainger will become the new chair of the British Olympic Association (BOA) on completion of her final term as chair of UK Sport in 2025. She will replace the incumbent Sir Hugh Robertson, becoming the first female chair of the BOA since its establishment in 1905.

===Charity work===
Grainger is a board member for the Youth Sport Trust, the British Olympic Association&#x27;s Athlete Commission and is a Patron for Netball Scotland, Winning Scotland, the NCI and Aberlour children&#x27;s charity.

Grainger was previously a board member of International Inspiration (2012-2017), a charity that promoted access to sport, play, and physical exercise for low- and middle-income families with children around the world. It was the first international development legacy initiative linked to an Olympic and Paralympic Games. International Inspiration&#x27;s board members included British broadcaster David Davies, former UK government minister Andrew Mitchell, and Sir Sebastian Coe.

In 2014 she judged the category prize &#x27;dreams&#x27; for the Koestler Trust&#x27;s annual exhibition &quot;Catching Dreams&quot;, curated by previous Koestler award entrants. The exhibition at the Southbank Centre presented art works by prisoners, detainees and ex-offenders.

===Honours and awards===
Grainger was elected President of the Edinburgh University Boat Club in 1996/97. She twice received the Edinburgh University Sports Union&#x27;s Eva Bailey Cup for the university&#x27;s most outstanding female athlete in 1995/96 and 1996/97 and was inducted to the University&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame on 29 May 2008.

She was elected as honorary president of the Scottish Amateur Rowing Association in November 2005, and a steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 2008, only the third rower to be elected while still competing.

She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2006 Birthday Honours, Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to rowing, and Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) in the 2017 New Year Honours for services to sport and charity.

In August 2012, a postbox in Aberdeen was painted gold to celebrate her 2012 Olympic gold medal.

In March 2013, she became patron of the National Coastwatch Institution.

In June 2017, Grainger was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Aberdeen.

In July 2017, it was announced that the trophy awarded to the winners of the Senior Women&#x27;s competition at the Home International Regatta would be known as Dame Katherine Grainger Quaich. The first winners of the trophy were Scotland.

In 2020 she was appointed as the Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, in succession to Professor Sir Kenneth Calman. She is the first woman to hold the office at Glasgow University, founded in 1451.

In January 2024 she was appointed an Honorary Colonel of the 215 (Scottish) Multirole Medical Regiment, Army Reserve.

<doc id="917400" wikidata="Q26840944" url="?curid=917400" title="Potassium alum">
<text>Potassium alum, potash alum, or potassium aluminium sulfate is a chemical compound first mentioned under various Sanskrit names in Ayurvedic medicinal texts such as , , and ; is chemically defined as the double sulfate of potassium and aluminium, with chemical formula KAl(SO4)2. It is commonly encountered as the dodecahydrate, KAl(SO4)2·12H2O. It crystallizes in an octahedral structure in neutral solution and cubic structure in an alkali solution with space group Pa and lattice parameter of 12.18 Å. The compound is the most important member of the generic class of compounds called alums, and is often called simply alum.

Potassium alum is commonly used in water purification, leather tanning, dyeing, fireproof textiles, and baking powder as E number E522. It also has cosmetic uses as a deodorant, as an aftershave treatment and as a styptic for minor bleeding from shaving.

==History==
Historically, potassium alum was used extensively in the wool industry from Classical antiquity, during the Middle Ages, and well into 19th century as a mordant or dye fixative in the process of turning wool into dyed bolts of cloth.

=== Antiquity ===

==== Egypt ====
Potassium alum was also known to the Ancient Egyptians, who obtained it from evaporites in the Western desert and reportedly used it as early as 1500 BCE to reduce the visible cloudiness (turbidity) in the water.

==== Mesopotamia ====
According to the expert on Middle Eastern history of chemistry Martin Levey, potassium alum is one of the few compounds known to the ancients that can be found relatively pure in nature, as well as one of only a few chemicals used in Mesopotamian chemical technology that can be identified with certainty. Both native and imported potassium alum was used. Together with other agents, potassium alum was used in glass-making, tanning, and in the dyeing of cloth, wood, and possibly hair. A tanning process using potassium alum is described in tablets from the first millennium BCE. When Levey wrote his article in 1958, no description of the dyeing process had been found, so it is not known how potassium alum was used in it. In Mesopotamian medicine potassium alum was used extensively, for example against itch, jaundice, some eye condition, and unidentified ailments.

According to Levey, potassium alum was used in &quot;classical times&quot; as a flux when soldering copper, in the fireproofing of wood, and in the separation of silver and gold, but that there is no evidence that these uses existed in Mesopotamia.

==== Greece ====
The production of potassium alum from alunite is archaeologically attested on the island Lesbos. This site was abandoned in the 7th century but dates back at least to the 2nd century CE.

==== Rome ====
Potassium alum was described under the name &quot;alumen&quot; or &quot;salsugoterrae&quot; by Pliny, and it is clearly the same as the &quot;stypteria&quot; (στυπτηρία) described by Dioscorides. However, the name &quot;alum&quot; and other names applied to this substance — like &quot;misy&quot;, &quot;sory&quot;, &quot;chalcanthum&quot;, and &quot;atramentum sutorium&quot; — were often applied to other products with vaguely similar properties or uses, such as iron sulfate or &quot;green vitriol&quot;.

==== India and China ====
Potassium alum is mentioned in Ayurvedic texts namely Charak Samhita, Sushurta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya with the name such as &quot;sphaṭika kṣāra&quot;, &quot;phitkari&quot; or &quot;saurashtri&quot;. It is used in traditional Chinese medicine with the name &quot;mingfan&quot; .

===Middle Ages===
In the 13th and 14th centuries, alum (from alunite) was a major import from Phocaea (Gulf of Smyrna in Byzantium) by Genoans and Venetians (and was a cause of war between Genoa and Venice) and later by Florence. After the fall of Constantinople, alunite (the source of alum) was discovered at Tolfa in the Papal States (1461). The textile dyeing industry in Bruges, and many locations in Italy, and later in England, required alum to stabilize the dyes onto the fabric (make the dyes &quot;fast&quot;) and also to brighten the colors.

=== Modern era ===

==== England ====
Potassium alum was imported into England mainly from the Middle East, and, from the late 15th century onwards, the Papal States for hundreds of years. Its use there was as a dye-fixer (mordant) for wool (which was one of England&#x27;s primary industries, the value of which increased significantly if dyed). These sources were unreliable, however, and there was a push to develop a source in England especially as imports from the Papal States ceased following the excommunication of Henry VIII.

With state financing, attempts were made throughout the 16th century, but without success until the early 17th century. An industry was founded in Yorkshire to process the shale, which contained the key ingredient, aluminium sulfate, and made an important contribution to the Industrial Revolution. One of the oldest historic sites for the production of alum from shale and human urine are the Peak alum works in Ravenscar, North Yorkshire. By the 18th century, the landscape of northeast Yorkshire had been devastated by this process, which involved constructing stacks of burning shale and fuelling them with firewood continuously for months. The rest of the production process consisted of quarrying, extraction, steeping of shale ash with seaweed in urine, boiling, evaporating, crystallisation, milling and loading into sacks for export. Quarrying ate into the cliffs of the area, the forests were felled for charcoal and the land polluted by sulfuric acid and ash.

==== Identification of the formula ====
In the early 1700s, Georg Ernst Stahl claimed that reacting sulfuric acid with limestone produced a sort of alum. The error was soon corrected by Johann Pott and Andreas Marggraf, who showed that the precipitate obtained when an alkali is poured into a solution of alum, namely alumina, is quite different from lime and chalk, and is one of the ingredients in common clay.

Marggraf also showed that perfect crystals with properties of alum can be obtained by dissolving alumina in sulfuric acid and adding potash or ammonia to the concentrated solution. In 1767, Torbern Bergman observed the need for potassium or ammonium sulfates to convert aluminium sulfate into alum, while sodium or calcium would not work.

At the time, potassium (&quot;potash&quot;) was believed to be exclusively found on plants. However, in 1797, Martin Klaproth discovered the presence of potassium in the minerals leucite and lepidolite.

Louis Vauquelin then conjectured that potassium was likewise an ingredient in many other minerals. Given Marggraf and Bergman&#x27;s experiments, he suspected that this alkali constituted an essential ingredient of natural alum. In 1797 he published a dissertation demonstrating that alum is a double salt, composed of sulfuric acid, alumina, and potash. In the same journal volume, Jean-Antoine Chaptal published the analysis of four different kinds of alum, namely, Roman alum, Levant alum, British alum and alum manufactured by himself, confirming Vauquelin&#x27;s results.

==Characteristics==

Potassium alum crystallizes in regular octahedra with flattened corners and is very soluble in water. The solution is slightly acidic and is astringent to the taste. Neutralizing a solution of alum with potassium hydroxide will begin to cause the separation of alumina .

When heated to nearly a red heat, it gives a porous, friable mass, which is known as &quot;burnt alum&quot;. It fuses at in its own water of crystallization.

==Natural occurrence==
Potassium alum dodecahydrate occurs in nature as a sulfate mineral called alum-(K), typically as encrustations on rocks in areas of weathering and oxidation of sulfide minerals and potassium-bearing minerals.

In the past, potassium alum has been obtained from alunite (), mined from sulfur-containing volcanic sediments. Alunite is an associate and likely potassium and aluminium source. It has been reported at Vesuvius, Italy; east of Springsure, Queensland; in Alum Cave, Tennessee; Alum Gulch, Santa Cruz County, Arizona and the Philippine island of Cebu.

In order to obtain alum from alunite, it is calcined and then exposed to the action of air for a considerable time. During this exposure it is kept continually moistened with water, so that it ultimately falls to a very fine powder. This powder is then lixiviated with hot water, the liquor decanted, and the alum allowed to crystallize.

The undecahydrate also occurs as the fibrous mineral kalinite ().

==Industrial production==
Potassium alum historically was mainly extracted from alunite.

Potassium alum is now produced industrially by adding potassium sulfate to a concentrated solution of aluminium sulfate. The aluminium sulfate is usually obtained by treating minerals like alum schist, bauxite and cryolite with sulfuric acid. If much iron should be present in the sulfate then it is preferable to use potassium chloride in place of potassium sulfate.

==Uses==

===Medicine and cosmetics===
Potassium alum is used in medicine mainly as an astringent (or styptic) and antiseptic.

Styptic pencils are rods composed of potassium alum or aluminum sulfate, used topically to reduce bleeding in minor cuts (especially from shaving) and abrasions, nosebleeds, and hemorrhoids, and to relieve pain from stings and bites. Potassium alum blocks are rubbed over the wet skin after shaving.

Potassium alum is also used topically to remove pimples and acne, and to cauterize aphthous ulcers in the mouth and canker sores, as it has a significant drying effect to the area and reduces the irritation felt at the site. It has been used to stop bleeding in cases of hemorrhagic cystitis and is used in some countries as a cure for hyperhidrosis.

It is used in dentistry (especially in gingival retraction cords) because of its astringent and hemostatic properties.

Potassium and ammonium alum are the active ingredients in some antiperspirants and deodorants, acting by inhibiting the growth of the bacteria responsible for body odor. Alum&#x27;s antiperspirant and antibacterial properties contribute to its traditional use as an underarm deodorant. It has been used for this purpose in Europe, Mexico, Thailand (where it is called &quot;sarn-som&quot;), throughout Asia and in the Philippines (where it is called &quot;tawas&quot;). Today, potassium or ammonium alum is sold commercially for this purpose as a &quot;deodorant crystal&quot;. Beginning in 2005 the US Food and Drug Administration no longer recognized it as a wetness reducer, but it is still available and used in several other countries, primarily in Asia.

Potassium alum was the major immunologic adjuvant used to increase the efficacy of vaccines, and has been used since the 1920s. But it has been almost completely replaced by aluminium hydroxide and aluminium phosphate in commercial vaccines.

Alum may be used in depilatory waxes used for the removal of body hair or applied to freshly waxed skin as a soothing agent.

In the 1950s, men sporting crewcut or flattop hairstyles sometimes applied alum to their hair, as an alternative to pomade, to keep the hair standing up.

===Culinary===
Potassium alum may be an acidic ingredient of baking powder to provide a second leavening phase at high temperatures (although sodium alum is more commonly used for that purpose). For example, potassium alum is frequently used in leavening of , a traditional Chinese fried bread, throughout China.

Alum was used by bakers in England during the 1800s to make bread whiter. This was theorized by some, including John Snow, to cause rickets. The Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1875 (38 &amp; 39 Vict. c. 63) prevented this and other adulterations.

Potassium alum, under the name &quot;alum powder&quot;, is found in the spice section of many grocery stores in the US. Its chief culinary use is in pickling recipes, to preserve and add crispness to fruit and vegetables.

===Flame retardant===
Potassium alum is used as a fire retardant to render cloth, wood, and paper materials less flammable.

===Tanning===
Potassium alum is used in leather tanning, in order to remove moisture from the hide and prevent rotting. Unlike tannic acid, alum doesn&#x27;t bind to the hide and can be washed out of it.

===Dyeing===
Alum has been used since antiquity as mordant to form a permanent bond between dye and natural textile fibers like wool. It is also used for this purpose in paper marbling.

===Chemical flocculant===
Potassium alum has been used since remote antiquity for purification of turbid liquids. It is still widely used in the purification of water for drinking and industrial processes water, treatment of effluents and post-storm treatment of lakes to precipitate contaminants.

Between 30 and 40 ppm of alum for household wastewater, often more for industrial wastewater, is added to the water so that the negatively charged colloidal particles clump together into &quot;flocs&quot;, which then float to the top of the liquid, settle to the bottom of the liquid, or can be more easily filtered from the liquid, prior to further filtration and disinfection of the water. Like other similar salts, it works by neutralizing the electrical double layer surrounding very fine suspended particles, allowing them to join into flocs.

The same principle is exploited when using alum to increase the viscosity of a ceramic glaze suspension; this makes the glaze more readily adherent and slows its rate of sedimentation.

===Lake pigments===
Aluminum hydroxide from potassium alum serves as a base for the majority of lake pigments.

===Dissolving iron and steel===
Alum solution has the property of dissolving steels while not affecting aluminium or base metals. Alum solution can be used to dissolve steel tool bits that have become lodged in machined castings.

===Other===
In traditional Japanese art, alum and animal glue were dissolved in water, forming a liquid known as &quot;dousa&quot; (:ja:礬水), and used as an undercoat for paper sizing.

Alum is an ingredient in some recipes for homemade modeling compounds, often called &quot;play clay&quot; or &quot;play dough&quot;, intended for use by children.

Potassium alum was formerly used as a hardener for photographic emulsions (films and papers), usually as part of the fixer. It has now been replaced in that use by other chemicals.

==Toxicology and safety==
Potassium alum may be a weak irritant to the skin.

<text>This lists significant accidents involving railway rolling stock, including crashes, fires and incidents of crew being overcome by locomotive emissions. Other railway-related incidents such as the King&#x27;s Cross fire of 1987 or the 7 July 2005 London bombings are not included.

==Worst accidents==
The worst accident was the Quintinshill rail disaster in Scotland in 1915 with 226 dead and 246 injured. The second worst, and the worst in England&#x27;s peacetime history, was the 1952 Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash, which killed 112 people and injured 340. The death toll from the 1957 Lewisham rail crash was 90; for the 1889 Armagh rail disaster (the worst in Northern Ireland) it was 80; and for the 1879 Tay Bridge disaster it was 75. The worst rail accident in Wales was the 1868 Abergele rail disaster, with 33 dead.

The accident on the London Underground with the highest loss of life was the Moorgate tube crash which occurred on the Northern City Line in 1975 (which was at the time part of the London Underground Network), in which 43 died.

==Mainline rail==
===1830–1922: Pre-grouping===
Before 1830: the 1815 Philadelphia train accident, a boiler explosion of &quot;Brunton&#x27;s Mechanical Traveller&quot; on a plateway killed 16 people, mainly sightseers.

===1923–1947: The Big Four (railway companies)===


===1948–1994: British Railways/Rail===

===1995 onwards: Post-privatisation===

There were 732 deaths from 146 accidents in 46 years when there was national rail provided by the state between 17 April 1948 and 15 October 1994. There were 92 deaths from 50 accidents in 28 years when there was privatised rail between 31 January 1995 and 24 August 2021.

==London Underground==

Despite the high passenger numbers on the London Underground, and the substantial age of some its infrastructure, passenger fatalities due to train-related incidents are exceptionally rare. The last train collision that killed more than one person was the Moorgate tube crash in 1975. Between 1999 and 2020 there were seven derailments, which caused injuries (some severe) but no fatalities. The Chancery Lane derailment in 2003 led to a closure of the Central line whilst urgent safety checks were undertaken. Fatal accidents killed one person each in 2020, 2022 and 2023; two were passengers who fell onto the tracks and one was in a car that crashed into the railway line.

==Tram and light rail==
Fatal accidents have occurred involving trams; the worst took place in Dover in 1917, when a tram ran away down a hill and overturned, killing 11 people and injuring 60. In 2016, a tram derailed on a sharp bend and overturned in Croydon, killing seven people and injuring 50.

==Staff accidents==
For much of the 19th and 20th centuries, working on the United Kingdom&#x27;s railway was very dangerous for many staff. In 1900, for example, for every one passenger killed or injured in a crash, there were seven worker casualties. This amounted to 15,698 staff injuries and 631 fatalities.

The &#x27;Railway Work, Life &amp; Death&#x27; project is uncovering details of British and Irish staff accidents before 1939 and making them freely available, via a database of transcriptions of staff accident investigations and other related records. At March 2023, the database documented nearly 50,000 individuals.

The National Railway Museum has an online exhibit, looking at railway safety—with a focus on the staff.

<text>The Hatfield rail crash was a railway accident on 17 October 2000, at Hatfield, Hertfordshire. It was caused by a metal fatigue-induced derailment, killing four people and injuring more than 70.

The accident exposed major stewardship shortcomings of the privatised national railway infrastructure company Railtrack. Reports found there was a lack of communication and some staff were not aware of maintenance procedures. Railtrack subsequently went into administration and was replaced by Network Rail. The aftermath of the accident saw widespread speed limit reductions throughout the rail network and a tightening of health and safety procedures, the repercussions of which were still felt years later. In 2005, both Railtrack and the contractor Balfour Beatty were found guilty of breaching health and safety laws.

==Accident==
A Great North Eastern Railway (GNER) InterCity 225 train bound for Leeds had left London King&#x27;s Cross at 12:10, and was travelling along the East Coast Main Line at approximately when it derailed south of Hatfield station at 12:23. The train was in the control of an experienced driver trainer accompanied by a trainee driver. It had been agreed at Kings Cross that the trainee would drive the 12:10 service to Leeds. The primary cause of the accident was later determined to be the left-hand rail fracturing as the train passed over it.

The train travelled a further after derailment. The leading locomotive and the first two coaches remained upright and on the rails. All of the following coaches and the trailing Driving Van Trailer (DVT) were derailed, and the train set separated into three sections. The restaurant coach, the eighth vehicle in the set, overturned onto its side and struck an overhead line gantry after derailing, resulting in severe damage to the vehicle. The whole incident occurred in 17seconds.

Four passengers died in the accident and a further 33 were initially reported as injured, three seriously. The number of injured was later revised to over 70. Those who died were all in the restaurant coach:
* Robert James Alcorn, 37, of Auckland, New Zealand
* Steve Arthur, 46, from Pease Pottage, West Sussex
* Leslie Gray, 43, of Tuxford, Nottinghamshire
* Peter Monkhouse, 50, of Headingley, Leeds

Two of those seriously injured were GNER staff working in the restaurant coach at the time of the accident. &quot;Emmerdale&quot; actress Anna Brecon was travelling on the train, and suffered minor cuts and bruises. Another passenger was the television reporter Justin Rowlatt, who said he &quot;watched the carriages skid and whip around on the gravel besides the track&quot;.

Crash investigators found the British Rail-designed Mark 4 coaches had good structural integrity and, aside from the restaurant coach, remained intact after the accident. Coincidentally, the locomotive in the crash was also involved in the Selby rail crash (where the leading DVT hit a road vehicle on the track) four months later.

==Cause==
A preliminary investigation found a rail had fragmented as trains passed and that the likely cause was &quot;rolling contact fatigue&quot; (defined as multiple surface-breaking cracks). Such cracks are caused by high loads where the wheels contact the rail. Repeated high loading causes fatigue cracks to grow. When they reach a critical size, the rail fails. Portions of the failed track at Hatfield were reassembled and numerous fatigue cracks were identified. They contributed to the spalling of the running surface to around deep and long.

The problem was known about before the accident; a letter from the infrastructure company Railtrack in December 1999 warned that the existing Railtrack Line Specification was insufficient to guard against this type of fatigue. Replacement rails were made available but never delivered to the correct location for installation.

Since privatisation, Railtrack had divested the engineering knowledge of British Rail to contractors. While it had comprehensive maintenance procedures that might have prevented the accident if followed appropriately, later investigation showed there was a serious problem with the experience and working knowledge of staff. In a subsequent interview, the Zone Quality Standards Manager said, &quot;I do not have knowledge of railway engineering nor railway safety&quot;, which was completely contrary to the written requirements for the role. In May 1999, the Head of Track had said that insufficiently-skilled work was causing more rails to break. Railtrack did not know how many other cases of rail fatigue around the network could lead to a similar accident. It consequently imposed over 1,800 emergency speed restrictions and instigated a costly nationwide track replacement programme. The company was subject to &quot;enforcement&quot; by the Rail Regulator, Tom Winsor.

==Aftermath==
In 2004, Steve Arthur&#x27;s widow was awarded £1million damages in the High Court. The families of the other three fatal casualties received damages out of court. A memorial service was held for the victims on the tenth anniversary of the crash in 2010 at St Etheldreda&#x27;s Church, Hatfield. A second service was held near the crash site afterwards. Both were conducted by the Rector of Hatfield, who had attended to casualties and the bereaved in the immediate aftermath of the accident in 2000.

The speed restrictions and track replacement works caused significant disruption on a majority of the national network for more than a year. The disruption and Railtrack&#x27;s spiralling costs eventually caused the company to enter administration at the insistence of Transport Secretary Stephen Byers, and its replacement by the not-for-dividend company Network Rail under Byers&#x27;s successor Alistair Darling.

Train operating companies were adversely affected by the disruption, losing an estimated 19% of revenue in the year following the crash. Freight operator EWS was cancelling up to 400 trains per week as a result, whilst estimates put Freightliner&#x27;s resultant losses at £1million per month. The cost to the entire UK economy of the disruption was estimated at £6million per day.

The Institute of Rail Welding (IoRW) was set up in 2002 by The Welding Institute (TWI) and Network Rail as a consequence of the recommendations in the investigation report. It provides a focus for individuals and organisations involved in rail welding and facilitates the adoption of best practice.

The aftermath of the crash had long-reaching repercussions in the rail industry. In 2015, at the fifteenth anniversary of the accident, the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) said a new system for handling maintenance introduced by Network Rail was confusing, and there was the potential for a similar accident. The union&#x27;s general secretary said that Network Rail needed to act on its concerns, otherwise there would be industrial action.

The Class 91 powering the train involved in the Hatfield rail crash would later be involved in the Selby rail crash four months later, sustaining minor damage. It was repaired again following the accident, and remained in service for a further 20 years, finally being scrapped at Sims Metals Scrapyard in Nottingham in 2021. As a result of its involvement in both accidents, it had gained the unofficial nickname &#x27;Lucky&#x27;.

==Court case==
In 2003, five managers and two companies – Network Rail (as successors of Railtrack) and the division of Balfour Beatty that maintained the track – were charged with manslaughter and breach of health and safety charges in connection with the accident. The managers, Anthony Walker (Balfour Beatty&#x27;s rail maintenance director), Nicholas Jeffries (its civil engineer), Railtrack&#x27;s Alistair Cook and Sean Fugill (asset managers for the London North-East zone), and track engineer Keith Lee, all denied the charges. The corporate manslaughter charges against Railtrack/Network Rail and some of its executives were dropped in September 2004, but the other charges stood.

The trial began in January 2005; the judge, Mr Justice Mackay, warned that it could go on for a year. On 14 July, the judge instructed the jury to acquit all defendants on charges of manslaughter. A few days later, Balfour Beatty changed its plea to guilty on the health and safety charges, and on 6 September, Network Rail was found guilty of breaching health and safety law. Network Rail were fined £3.5 million while Balfour Beatty were fined £10 million. All of the manslaughter charges against the executives were dismissed by the judge.

<text>Sir Charles Benedict Ainslie (born 5 February 1977) is a British competitive sailor. Ainslie is the most successful sailor in Olympic history. He won medals at five consecutive Olympics from 1996 onwards, including gold at four consecutive Games from 2000 to 2012.

He is one of three men to win medals in five different Olympic Games in sailing, doing so after Torben Grael and Robert Scheidt, and the second to win four gold medals, after Paul Elvstrøm.

Ainslie is CEO of Athena Sports Group which includes the roles of Team Principal, CEO and Skipper of INEOS Britannia and CEO of the Emirates Great Britain SailGP Team. He is also a Patron of the 1851 Trust, a British charity that supports young people in sailing and STEM education.

==Early life==
Ainslie was born in Macclesfield, England to Roddy and Sue Ainslie. Roddy captained a boat that took part in the first Whitbread Round The World Race in 1973. Ben&#x27;s elder sister, Fleur, is married to Jerome Pels, former secretary general of the International Sailing Federation (ISAF). Ainslie was educated at two independent schools: at the Terra Nova School in a rural area near the village of Holmes Chapel in Cheshire in north west England, and Truro School in the city of Truro, Cornwall, followed by Peter Symonds Sixth Form, Winchester, Hampshire.

==Career==
Ainslie learned to sail at Restronguet Creek near Falmouth, Cornwall.

He started sailing at the age of eight and first competed at the age of ten. His first international competition was aged twelve at the 1989 Optimist world championships held in Japan where he placed 73rd. 

===Olympics===
Ainslie won silver at the 1996 Olympic Games and gold in the 2000 Summer Olympics in the Laser class. He gained some and moved to the larger Finn class for the 2004 Summer Olympics, where he won gold, a feat he repeated in the 2008 and 2012 competitions. Both his gold medal-winning Laser and Finn dinghies are currently displayed at the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.

On 19 May 2012, Ainslie became the first person to carry the Olympic torch in the UK. Starting the 70-day tour of the United Kingdom at Land&#x27;s End, he was the first of 8,000 torch carriers. He was selected on 11 August 2012 to carry the flag for the Great Britain team at the London 2012 Olympics closing ceremony.

At the beginning of 2005 Ainslie worked in the role of tactician in the New Zealand-based Team New Zealand who were preparing to compete in the challenger selection process to win the right to Challenge for the 32nd America&#x27;s Cup. In May 2005 Ainslie took the decision to relinquish the role of tactician and focus on improving his match racing skills as helmsman of the &#x27;B&#x27; boat used to practice and tune the race boat helmed by Dean Barker.
* Team Origin – Royal Thames Yacht Club
Ainslie figure headed a British challenge for the Cup alongside Sir Keith Mills the team was named Team Origin. However this challenge withdrew without competing following a period of discussion regarding the future format of the event.
* Oracle Team USA – Golden Gate Yacht Club
For the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup, Ainslie was recruited as a tactician by Oracle Team USA, as a replacement for John Kostecki during an Oracle practice session on 11 September 2013. On 12 September, the following day, he replaced Kostecki going into race six of the 2013 America&#x27;s Cup. His Oracle Team USA beat Team New Zealand in the America&#x27;s Cup decider in San Francisco on 25 September.
* Ben Ainslie Racing – Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd
In January 2012, Ben Ainslie announced the formation of an eponymous team to compete in the America&#x27;s Cup: Ben Ainslie Racing (BAR). His team competed in the AC45 class of the 2011–13 America&#x27;s Cup World Series, 2014 Extreme Sailing Series and set a multihull record for the Round the Island Race. The team won the 2015–16 America&#x27;s Cup World Series but were eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2017 Louis Vuitton Challenger&#x27;s Trophy competition to determine the challenger for the 2017 America&#x27;s Cup.
* INEOS TEAM UK – Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd
In April 2018 Ainslie announced the Americas Cup team would be renamed INEOS TEAM UK in partnership with INEOS and Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Again based out of the Portsmouth HQ the team built two new 75-foot foiling monohull yachts to compete for the 36th Americas Cup set which took place in Auckland, New Zealand in 2021.

On 21 October 2020, Ben and INEOS TEAM UK launched their race boat for the 36th America&#x27;s Cup from their HQ in Auckland, naming the AC75 race boat &#x27;Britannia&#x27;
Following a disappointing performance in the Auckland ACWS event in December 2020, the team spent the following three weeks making modifications to their boat Britannia ahead of the start of the Prada Cup qualifying series. This included a new mast and sails as well as modifications to the hull and foils. The team received support from INEOS sponsored Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team.

INEOS Team UK dominated the Round Robin phase of the Prada Cup which saw them race and beat each of the two other challenger teams three times, securing their place in the Prada Cup Final beginning on 13 February 2021. The team&#x27;s place in the Prada Cup final marked a significant point in their campaign, being the furthest any British challenge had progressed in the competition since the introduction of a challenger selection series.

After Luna Rossa Prada Pirelli&#x27;s win in the Prada Cup Semi-Finals against American Magic, the American team was eliminated from the event, securing the Italian team&#x27;s place in the Prada Cup Final alongside INEOS Team UK.

The Prada Cup Finals were held in predominantly light wind (8-14 knots), with Luna Rossa showing great improvement in boat handling, winning the first 5 races consecutively. INEOS Team UK showed superior downwind pace in Race 6, taking their sole race win before Luna Rossa dominated Day 4 to take their sixth and seventh race win, winning the Prada Cup overall, and securing their place in the 36th America&#x27;s Cup Match against Emirates Team New Zealand.

On 17 March 2021, following Emirates Team New Zealand&#x27;s defence of their title (their seventh win overall), the Chairman of Royal Yacht Squadron Racing, Bertie Bicket, issued a pre-arranged, &quot;friendly&quot; challenge to the Commodore of the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Aaron Young. This made Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd and their re-named sailing team INEOS Britannia the Challenger of Record for the 37th Louis Vuitton America&#x27;s Cup.

* INEOS Britannia – Royal Yacht Squadron Racing Ltd

The challenge agreed that the 37th Americas Cup would be raced in the America&#x27;s Cup 75 (AC75), a 23 m (75 ft) foiling monohull class, that there would be nationality rules in place, a cost reduction programme and that the America&#x27;s Cup will be raced in Barcelona as a first-to-seven-wins series from 12 October 2024 (expected to be completed on or before 21 October 2024). The Royal Yacht Squadron&#x27;s challenge is the first time a British team had competed in three consecutive America&#x27;s Cup cycles since 1930 when Sir Thomas Lipton challenged in the yacht &quot;Shamrock V&quot;.

On the 4 October 2024, after a 7–4 win, the yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; INEOS Britannia defeated Luna Rossa representing Circolo della Vela Sicilia winning the Louis Vuitton Challenger Selections Series to challenge Emirates Team New Zealand for the 37th America&#x27;s Cup. This is the first time the UK has challenged the America&#x27;s Cup since 1964 when Tony Boyden&#x27;s &quot;sovereign&quot; (representing the Royal Thames Yacht Club) lost 4-0 to Eric Ridder&#x27;s &quot;Constellation&quot;.

The match was raced between &quot;Taihoro&quot;, helmed by Peter Burling and Nathan Outteridge, and &quot;Britannia&quot; helmed by Ainslie and Dylan Fletcher, the winners of qualifying event - the 2024 Louis Vuitton Cup. Races were held, from October 12-October 19, with Reserve Days on Oct 14-15, 17. Eventually losing the series 7-2, INEOS Britannia became the first UK challenger to score in an America&#x27;s Cup match since 1934 when Sir Thomas Sopwith&#x27;s &quot;Endeavor&quot; (representing the Royal Yacht Squadron) lost 4-2 to Harold S. Vanderbilt&#x27;s &quot;Rainbow&quot;.

On 23rd January 2025 it was announced that Ben Ainslie had split from INEOS Brittania and that consequently he would be contesting the 38th America&#x27;s Cup as the Challenger of Record with his Athena Pathway team.

=== World Match Racing Tour ===
In December 2010, Ainslie finished in first place in the World Match Racing Tour, and is the 2010 ISAF Match Racing Champion. 

===The Extreme Sailing Series===
In January 2014, it was announced that Ainslie would compete in the 2014 Extreme Sailing Series as part of his preparation for the America&#x27;s Cup. The eight-race event will see him compete in a multi-hull boat.

==Personal life==
Ainslie lives in London. He is a member of the Sea View Yacht Club and is an honorary member of the Royal Yacht Squadron. He supports Chelsea.

In August 2014, Ainslie was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<doc id="917441" wikidata="Q156931" url="?curid=917441" title="Marder II">
<text>The &quot;Marder&quot; II (&quot;marten&quot; in English) was a German tank destroyer of World War II based on the Panzer II chassis. There were two versions, the first mounted a modified Soviet 7.62 cm gun firing German ammunition, while the other mounted the German 7.5 cm Pak 40 gun. Its high profile and thin open-topped armor provided minimal protection to the crew. Nevertheless, the Marder II (and similar Marder III) provided a great increase in firepower over contemporary German tanks during 1942 and into 1943. Only four Marder IIs remain today.

==History==
During the first days of Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Germans came unprepared to encounter Soviet T-34 medium tanks and KV heavy tanks. Although the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; succeeded in most operations due to superior tactics, air support and supply, the lack of anti-tank weapons capable of successfully engaging these vehicles at range was becoming evident. An urgent need arose for a mobile and powerful enough anti-tank weapon than the existing towed anti-tank guns or tank destroyers like the &quot;Panzerjäger I&quot;.

Among a series of solutions, it was decided to use surplus light tanks, like the Panzer II, and captured vehicles, like the Lorraine Schlepper, as the basis for makeshift tank destroyers. The result was the &quot;Marder&quot; series, which were armed with either the new 7.5 cm Pak 40 anti-tank guns or captured Soviet 7.62 cm F-22 Model 1936 field guns, large numbers of which had been acquired early in the war.

In 1942, at least 5 Marder IIs were supplied by the Germans to their ally, Hungary. The Hungarians used these successfully against Soviet tanks on the Eastern Front. In 1943, a surviving Marder II was taken back to Hungary to be studied. Soon, the Hungarians designed and built a similar vehicle using the Hungarian Toldi light tank&#x27;s chassis with a three-sided armoured superstructure housing a powerful 75 mm anti-tank gun mounted on top. This would be referred to as the &#x27;Toldi páncélvadász&#x27; (&#x27;Toldi tank destroyer&#x27;).

==Production==
The &quot;Marder&quot; II came in two major versions. The first version (Sd.Kfz. 132) was based on the light Panzer II &quot;Ausf&quot;. D/E and &quot;Flammpanzer&quot; II chassis with a new torsion bar suspension featuring four large road wheels and a &quot;slack track&quot; with no track return rollers. It was armed with captured Soviet 7.62 cm guns that were rebuilt to accept the larger German 7.5 cm Pak 40 propellant cartridge. This improved its penetrative capabilities and eliminated the need for captured ammunition. These early &quot;Marder&quot; IIs had a high silhouette ( high) and relatively thin armor compared to other armored vehicles; only (front) and (sides). There was no armour on the top or rear, leaving the crew with very little protection. Alkett built 150 &quot;Marder&quot; II (Sd. Kfz. 132) in April/May 1942 and Wegmann converted further 52 from mid 1942 to 1943.

The second version (Sd.Kfz. 131) was based on new-built Panzer II Ausf. F hulls. This &quot;Marder&quot; II had a redesigned (widened) fighting compartment and used the German 75 mm Pak 40 anti-tank gun. The silhouette was lowered by about 40 cm to 2.20 m, but the armor was thin and the compartment was open to the top and rear, as in Sd. Kfz. 132. Famo (Breslau), and FAMO-Ursus produced 531 &quot;Marder&quot; II (Sd.Kfz. 131) from July 1942 to June 1943. About 130 more were converted from mid 1943 to early 1944 when the last Panzer IIs were taken out of active service. There was also a version made with the 50 mm pak 38, these were made because of a lack of the 75mm pak 40. A different superstructure was also made to accommodate the new gun, this resulting in a new version called the &quot;5 cm pak 38 auf p.z kpfw Marder II.&quot;

==Combat history==

The various Marder IIs produced fought on all European fronts of the war, however, there was a large concentration of these on the Eastern Front. The &quot;Marder&quot; IIs were used by the &quot;Panzerjäger Abteilungen&quot; of the Panzer divisions of both the Heer and the Waffen SS, as well as several Luftwaffe units. The &quot;Marder&quot;&#x27;s weaknesses were mainly related to survivability. The combination of a high silhouette and open-top fighting compartment made them vulnerable to indirect artillery fire, aircraft strafing, and grenades. The armor was also quite thin, making them vulnerable to enemy tanks or infantry. The &quot;Marders&quot; were not assault vehicles or tank substitutes; the open-top compartment meant operations in crowded areas such as urban environments or other close-combat situations were not an option. They were best employed in defensive or overwatch roles. Despite their weaknesses, they were more effective than the towed antitank guns that they replaced.

<text>The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics is an academic not-for-profit foundation which federates bioinformatics activities throughout Switzerland.

The institute was established on 30 March 1998 and its mission is to provide core bioinformatics resources to the national and international life science research community in fields such as genomics, proteomics and systems biology as well as to lead and coordinate the field of bioinformatics in Switzerland. In particular, it promotes research, develops databanks and computer technologies, and is involved in teaching and service activities.

== History ==

The institute was originally created to provide a framework for stable long-term funding for both the Swiss-Prot database and the Swiss EMBnet node. Swiss-Prot in particular went through a major funding crisis in 1996, which led the leaders of the five research groups active in bioinformatics in Geneva and Lausanne, Ron Appel, Amos Bairoch, Philipp Bucher, Victor Jongeneel and Manuel Peitsch to create SIB. Once created, the institute could then apply for funding under a Swiss law that allows the government to fund up to 50% of expenses of vital research and teaching infrastructures. 

The first director of the institute was Victor Jongeneel followed by Ernest Feytmans between 2001 and September 2007. From 1 October 2007 until July 2018, the institute was led by Ron Appel, one of its founding members. Between July 2018 and March 2022, the SIB was led by Christine Durinx and Ron Appel, as Joint Executive Directors. Starting 1st April 2022, Christophe Dessimoz replaced Christine Durinx as joint executive director. Since October 2022 Christophe Dessimoz is sole Executive Director, following the retirement of Ron Appel.

== Organisation ==

The SIB Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics is a federation of research groups with affiliated bioinformaticians at 21 SIB partner institutions, including the Universities of Basel, Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano and Zurich, the Federal Institutes of Technology in Lausanne and Zurich, the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, the Institute of Oncology Research in Bellinzona, and the Geneva School of Business Administration (HEG). Current research groups in SIB are located in Basel, Bern, Fribourg, Geneva, Lausanne, Lugano, Zurich, Yverdon, Wädenswil, Bellinzona and Davos.

SIB federates more than 70 research, service and infrastructure groups, gathering more than 700 scientists in fields as varied as proteomics, transcriptomics, genomics, systems biology, structural bioinformatics, evolutionary bioinformatics, modelling, imaging, biophysics, population genetics and clinical bioinformatics. The SIB organizes an annual international scientific meeting, the [BC]2 Basel Computational Biology Conference.

== Bioinformatics resources ==

The institute offers a wide range of resources for the life science research community, most being open and accessible through Expasy, the SIB bioinformatics resource portal. They include:

=== Databases ===

SIB develops and maintains databases of international standing, including UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (curated protein sequence database providing a high level of annotation), neXtProt (human-centric protein knowledge platform), SWISS-MODEL Repository (three-dimensional protein structure models), STRING (protein interaction networks for Systems Biology), SwissRegulon (genome-wide transcription regulatory networks), Eukaryotic Promoter Database (EPD), SWISS-2DPAGE (2D gel database), WORLD-2DPAGE Repository (2D gel repository), PROSITE (protein families and domains), MyHits (protein sequences and motifs), Bgee (database to retrieve and compare gene expression patterns between animal species), OpenFlu (database for human and animal influenza virus), ViralZone (portal to viral UniProtKB entries), GlycoSuiteDB (glycan database), SugarBindDB (Pathogen Sugar-Binding Database), OrthoDB (the hierarchical catalogue of eukaryotic orthologs), miROrtho (the catalogue of animal microRNA genes), ImmunoDB (insect immune-related genes and gene families) and Cellosaurus (a knowledge resource on cell lines).

=== Software tools ===

SIB develops and supplies software for the global life science research community, such as SWISS-MODEL (protein structure homology modelling), SwissDrugDesign (computer-aided drug design), Melanie (2D gel analysis platform), MSight (LC-MS imaging and analysis software), OMA (Orthology Matrix), V-pipe (viral genomics pipeline), DeepView/Swiss-PdbViewer (protein visualization, modelling and analysis), and Newick utilities (high-throughput phylogenetic tree processing).

=== Core facilities ===

SIB manages several bioinformatics core facilities that provide informatics and statistical support, as well as services and advice to life scientists, thus enabling them to conduct their research projects and analyse the resulting data. Core facilities have been set up for genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics research. SIB also maintains the Vital-IT High Performance Computing Centre that provides computational resources, development support and consultancy to the Swiss life science community both in academia and industry. The Vital-IT infrastructure is distributed to three sites: University of Lausanne, EPFL and University of Geneva. Compute resources and bioinformatics expertise are also provided in the Basel area with sciCORE, the Basel Computational Biology Center.

== Education and training ==
One of SIB’s priorities is to promote and coordinate education in bioinformatics. SIB members are directly, or indirectly, involved in a number of bioinformatics courses at all educational levels – from high school to undergraduate and graduate degrees – as well as in specialized training for life scientists. SIB also promotes a PhD Training Network in bioinformatics, which is open to graduate students at Swiss schools of higher education. The objectives of this network are two-fold:
# To offer graduate students in bioinformatics a set of cutting-edge courses that provide both the theoretical and the practical knowledge necessary to work on a successful PhD research project in bioinformatics.
# To foster the development of a network of PhD students and promote the exchange of ideas, as well as the mobility of the students between participating institutions.

== Popular science ==
The SIB is also involved in bringing bioinformatics to the layman. Understanding the growing importance this relatively recent science has in today’s society is becoming fundamental. Indeed, in not too distant a future, patients will be referring to results directly generated by bioinformatics methods. Since the year 2000, in order to heighten public awareness, the SIB has taken part in numerous science fairs, created two online magazines, an outdoor exhibition and, in 2012, a virtual exhibition.

<text>The I (English: &quot;tank hunter mark I&quot;) was the first German (&quot;tank hunter&quot;) to see service in the Second World War. It mounted the Czech 4.7 cm KPÚV vz. 38 (German designation &quot;4.7 cm (t)&quot;) anti-tank gun on a converted open-topped Panzer I chassis. It was intended to counter heavy French tanks like the Char B1 &quot;bis&quot; that were beyond the capabilities of the 3.7 cm Pak 36 anti-tank gun and extended the life of the obsolete Panzer I chassis. A total of 202 Panzer I chassis were converted to I standard in 1940–41, and were employed in the Battle of France, in the North Africa campaign and on the Eastern Front.

==Design and production==
The Panzer I turret was removed and a fixed gun shield added to protect the armament and crew. The anti-tank gun was mounted on a pedestal in the fighting compartment after wheels, axle and trails were removed, but retained its original gun shield. It normally carried 74 antitank and 10 HE shells. Alkett and contractors built 202 vehicles, the first series of 132 by Alkett in 1940. Ten of the second series of 70 were assembled by Alkett while the remainder were assembled by Klöckner-Humboldt-Deutz in 1940 and 1941. The first series had a five-sided shield.; vehicles in the second series are recognizable by their seven-sided gun shield.

The formal name was , translating as &quot;4.7 cm antitank gun (Czech) (self-propelled) on armoured combat vehicle I without turret&quot;.

==Organization==
Panzerjägers were organized into companies of nine vehicles, with three companies per battalion, although for the French Campaign, anti-tank battalion &quot;Panzerjäger-Abteilung&quot; 521 had just six vehicles in each company. For the remainder of the war, they were used solely by independent antitank battalions, with two exceptions post the Balkans campaign, one company was assigned to the &quot;SS-Brigade Leibstandarte der SS Adolf Hitler&quot; and another to 900 of (&quot;900th Motorized Training Brigade&quot;) in preparation for Operation Barbarossa.

==Combat history==
 521, 616, 643 and 670 had 99 vehicles in the Battle of France. Only 521 participated in the campaign from the beginning; the other three were still training until a few days after the campaign began but were sent to the front as training finished.

Twenty-seven equipped 605 in North Africa. It arrived in Tripoli, Libya between 18 and 21 March 1941. Five replacements were sent in September 1941 but only three arrived on 2 October, the others being lost when the freighter &quot;Castellon&quot; was sunk by the submarine HMS &quot;Perseus&quot;. At the start of the British Operation Crusader the battalion was at full strength but lost thirteen vehicles during the battles. Four more replacements were sent in January 1942 so that it mustered seventeen at the beginning of the Battle of Gazala. Despite the shipment of another three vehicles from September–October 1942, the battalion only had eleven by the beginning of the Second Battle of El Alamein. The last two replacements were received by the battalion in November 1942.

 521, 529, 616, 643 and 670 were equipped with 135 for Operation Barbarossa. They were assigned as given below for the opening stages of the battle:

By 27 July 1941, 529 had lost four vehicles. On 23 November 1941 it reported that it still had 16 vehicles, although two were not operational. On 5 May 1942, 521 reported that only five of those vehicles still existed. 529 had only two on strength when it was disbanded on 30 June 1942. 616 seems to have been an exception as it reported all three companies were equipped with the , during mid or late 1942.

==Combat assessments==
; 643, 25 July 1940
:&quot;The armor-piercing shells () were effective against thick armor at ranges up to – sufficient to . Observation was limited; the crew, with the exception of the driver, had to look over the gun shield to observe what is in front of the , resulting in the exposure of body parts to potential dangers; namely shots to the head (also known as in German). In effect, the crew behind the gun shield were blind in urban combat, suppressing fire and individual tanks&quot;.
; 521, July 1941
:&quot;The effective range of the 4.7 cm Pak(t) is with a maximum range of . When attacking an enemy position equipped with anti-tank guns and artillery, namely near Mogilev and Rogachev, its rather tall superstructure presented a target for artillery and anti-tank guns. Thus, the is destroyed before it can get into action. When large shells explode close-by, shrapnel pierced the thin armor. Russian anti-tank guns already penetrated at range. The 1st lost five out of the ten vehicles () in such actions, of which only two could be repaired.&quot;
; 605, July 1942
:&quot;The accuracy of this weapon was commented on; as it will usually hit its target with the first shot at ranges up to . However, its penetration qualities were far too low for the necessary combat ranges in the desert of North Africa. The chassis, engine and suspension were constantly in need of care due to the additional weight of the anti-tank gun. In one case, three Mk II (Matilda II infantry tanks) were penetrated at a range of by 4.7 cm tungsten-core armor-piercing shell (&quot;Pz.Gr. 40&quot;). It usually penetrates of armor. Therefore, a small percentage of these rounds are desired. The 4.7 cm armor-piercing shell (Pz.Gr. 36(t)) will not penetrate a Mk.II at . But the crew will abandon the tank because fragments spall off the armor on the inside.&quot;

<doc id="917475" wikidata="Q409804" url="?curid=917475" title="Allantoin">
<text>Allantoin is a chemical compound with formula C4H6N4O3. It is also called 5-ureidohydantoin or glyoxyldiureide. It is a diureide of glyoxylic acid. Allantoin is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms including animals, plants and bacteria, though not humans. It is produced from uric acid, which itself is a degradation product of nucleic acids, by action of urate oxidase (uricase). Allantoin also occurs as a natural mineral compound (IMA symbol Aan).

== History ==

Allantoin was first isolated in 1800 by the Italian physician Michele Francesco Buniva (1761–1834) and the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who mistakenly believed it to be present in the amniotic fluid. In 1821, the French chemist Jean Louis Lassaigne found it in the fluid of the allantois; he called it &quot;l&#x27;acide allantoique&quot;. In 1837, the German chemists Friedrich Wöhler and Justus Liebig synthesized it from uric acid and renamed it &quot;allantoïn&quot;.

==Animals==
Named after the allantois (an amniote embryonic excretory organ in which it concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and other hominids), it is a product of oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism. After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted. Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients. In fish, allantoin is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion.

Allantoin has been shown to improve insulin resistance when administered to rats and to increase lifespan when administered to the nematode worm &quot;Caenorhabditis elegans&quot;.

== Bacteria ==
In bacteria, purines and their derivatives (such as allantoin) are used as secondary sources of nitrogen under nutrient-limiting conditions. Their degradation yields ammonia, which can then be utilized. For instance, &quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; is able to utilize allantoin as its sole nitrogen source.

Mutants in the &quot;B. subtilis&quot; &quot;pucI&quot; gene were unable to grow on allantoin, indicating that it encodes an allantoin transporter.

In &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot;, allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) and allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) are essential for allantoin metabolism. In this species the catabolism of allantoin, and the subsequent release of ammonium, inhibits antibiotic production (&quot;Streptomyces&quot; species synthesize about half of all known antibiotics of microbial origin).

== Applications ==
Allantoin is present in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant and in the urine of most mammals. Chemically synthesized bulk allantoin, which is chemically equivalent to natural allantoin, is safe, non-toxic, compatible with cosmetic raw materials and meets CTFA and JSCI requirements. Over 10,000 patents reference allantoin.

===Cosmetics===
Manufacturers may use allantoin as an ingredient in over-the-counter cosmetics.

===Pharmaceuticals===
It is frequently present in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions, various cosmetic lotions and creams, and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products.

===Biomarker of oxidative stress===
Since uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans, only non-enzymatic processes with reactive oxygen species will give rise to allantoin, which is thus a suitable biomarker to measure oxidative stress in chronic illnesses and senescence.

<text>St Mary&#x27;s College is a private Catholic primary and secondary school for girls located in the &quot;square mile&quot; of the city of Adelaide, South Australia.

==History==
At the request of Laurence Sheil, then the Bishop of Adelaide, St Mary&#x27;s College was initiated by the Dominican Sisters, who arrived from the Dominican Convent in Cabra, Ireland, as missionaries. The foundation stone was laid in 1868. The Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart provided primary education for students from the lower socioeconomic status, while the Dominican Sisters took responsibility for middle-class girls from both Catholic and other religious backgrounds whose parents could afford post-primary education.
It is the oldest continuously running all-girl&#x27;s school in South Australia; originally located in cottages on West Terrace and Franklin Street, with the convent and chapel from when the nuns first established the school is still there today. 

==Academics==
In 2021, over 800 girls attended the school in classes from Reception (age 5) to year 12 (age 17–18).

==Houses==
When pupils first enrol at St. Mary&#x27;s, they are assigned to one of the four sporting houses at the school; St Mary&#x27;s, St Dominics, St Catherines and St Thomas. Annually, these teams compete against one another in events such as Sports Day, and other minor lunch sporting events such as Basketball, Netball and Volleyball.

==Immersion Programs==
St Mary&#x27;s selects Year 11 students to attend pilgrimages annually. One is called the &quot;Lands Trip,&quot; and selects 6 - 8 girls to travel into the APY Lands to visit an Aboriginal community..

The other pilgrimage is to Vietnam. In 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 St Mary&#x27;s College and Christian Brothers College students combined to participate in a Pilgrimage to Vietnam. The primary focus of the Pilgrimage is on giving service and working with orphaned, disabled children in the Phu My Orphanage in the Thi Nghe District, Saigon. The Orphanage is operated by the Sisters of St Paul de Charters, and houses over 300 children. However, due to new management from the Vietnamese school, St Mary&#x27;s has stopped their visits to Vietnam in 2019.

==Campus==

The campus contains:
* Four buildings containing classroom, computer, science, art and home economic facilities: the Boylan, Moore, Catherine and Kavanagh buildings
* Gymnasium
* Playground for Junior School
* Veritas Lawns and Convent Lawns
* STEM Centre
* Tennis courts 
* Transportable classrooms
* The Performing Arts Centre College
* The restored Chapel and Convent

The school also shares a campus with St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church and resides next to the Archbishop&#x27;s House on West Terrace. The school borders three streets, the front-facing Franklin Street, the west side along West Terrace, and the back facing Grote Street.

== Notable alumni ==

* Katelyn Pope, Port Adelaide Women&#x27;s player
* Megan Blake Irwin, Model

<doc id="917484" wikidata="Q7122045" url="?curid=917484" title="Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve">
<text>The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is a non-use conservation area and biosphere reserve in the Satpura Range of Madhya Pradesh state in Central India.

The conservation area was created in 1999 by the Indian government. It also contains animals from the Himalayan mountains and from the lower Western Ghats. UNESCO designated it a biosphere reserve in 2009.

==Geography==
The Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve is located within areas of Narmadapuram, Betul, and Chhindwara Districts in Madhya Pradesh.

The biosphere reserve&#x27;s total area is . It includes three wildlife conservation units: 
*Bori Sanctuary (518.00 km2)
*Pachmarhi Sanctuary (461.37 km2).
*Satpura National Park (524.37 km2)

Satpura National Park is designated as the core zone and the remaining area of 4401.91 km2, including the Bori and Pachmarhi sanctuaries, serves as the buffer zone.

==Ecology==

The reserve is composed primarily of forest habitats, and is an important transition zone between the forest species of western and eastern India.

=== Flora ===

The forests are dominated by teak (&quot;Tectona grandis&quot;). They include the westernmost groves of sal (&quot;Shorea robusta&quot;), which is the dominant tree of eastern India&#x27;s forests. Other endemic vegetation includes wild mango, silver fern, jamun and &quot;arjun&quot;. The Cuddapah almond trees are abundantly found over the hills of Pachmarchi.

Fourteen ethno-botanical plant species that occur in PBR have been studied, which are traded from the selected villages of the buffer zone area of PBR. Different plant parts of these important species are collected by the local people for their own consumption and trade. A part of the reserve vegetation has been studied by Prof. Chandra Prakash Kala, especially with respect to the indigenous uses of the plants.
===Fauna===
Large mammal species include tigers, leopard, wild bear, gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;), chital deer (&quot;Axis axis&quot;), muntjac deer, sambar deer (&quot;Cervus multicolor&quot;), and rhesus macaque live in the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve.

The endemic fauna includes chinkara, nilgai, Asian wild dogs, the Indian wolf, gaur, Indian giant squirrels, and flying squirrels.

<doc id="917492" wikidata="Q5021120" url="?curid=917492" title="California Suite">
<text>California Suite is a 1976 play by Neil Simon. Similar in structure to his earlier &quot;Plaza Suite&quot;, the comedy is composed of four playlets set in Suite 203-04, which consists of a living room and an adjoining bedroom with an ensuite bath, in The Beverly Hills Hotel.

==Plot==
In &quot;Visitor from New York&quot;, Hannah Warren is a Manhattan workaholic who flies to Los Angeles to retrieve her teenage daughter Jenny after she leaves home to live with her successful screenwriter father William. The bickering, divorced couple is forced to decide what living arrangements are best for the girl.

Conservative, middle-aged businessman Marvin Michaels is the &quot;Visitor from Philadelphia&quot;, who awakens to discover a prostitute named Bunny unconscious in his bed after consuming a bottle of vodka. With his wife Millie on her way up to the suite, he must find a way to conceal all traces of his uncharacteristic indiscretion.

The &quot;Visitors from London&quot; are British actress Diana Nichols, a first-time nominee for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and her husband Sidney, a once-closeted antique dealer who increasingly has become indiscreet about his sexual orientation. The Oscar is an honor that could revive her faltering career, but Diana knows she doesn&#x27;t have a chance of winning. She is in deep denial about the true nature of her marriage of convenience, and as she prepares for her moment in the spotlight, her mood fluctuates from hope to panic to despair.

The &quot;Visitors from Chicago&quot; are two affluent couples who are best friends. Stu Franklyn and his wife Gert and Mort Hollender and his wife Beth are taking a much-needed vacation together. Things begin to unravel quickly when Beth is hurt during a tennis match, and Mort accuses Stu of causing her injury.

==Productions==
&quot;California Suite&quot; originally was produced by the Center Theatre Group. Directed by Gene Saks, it opened on April 23, 1976, at the Ahmanson Theatre, where it ran until June 5. Tammy Grimes portrayed Hannah, Diana, and Gert; George Grizzard portrayed William, Sidney, and Stu; Barbara Barrie portrayed Millie and Beth; and Jack Weston portrayed Marvin and Mort.

The play opened on Broadway at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theatre on June 10, 1976 and closed on July 2, 1977 after 445 performances and four previews. Directed by Saks, the same cast (and Leslie Easterbrook as Bunny) as in the Ahmanson Theatre opened on Broadway.

Later in the run, Marge Redmond replaced Barrie (on January 7, 1977), Kenneth Haigh (on February 28, 1977) and then David McCallum (on May 2, 1977) replaced Grizzard, Rue McClanahan replaced Grimes (on April 4, 1977) and Vincent Gardenia replaced Weston (on June 13, 1977).

The play&#x27;s national tour, lasting from Oct. 1, 1977-June 3, 1978, starred Elizabeth Allen as Hannah, Diana, and Gert; Robert Reed as William, Sidney, and Stu; Warren Berlinger as Marvin and Mort; Patti Karr as Millie and Beth; and Bea Swanson as Bunny. During the run, Don Murray replaced Reed.

A bus and truck tour, which cut &quot;Visitors from Chicago&quot; and ran from Aug. 31-Dec. 2, 1978, was headlined by Carolyn Jones as Hannah, Diana and Millie. The cast also included James Drury as William and Marvin, Peter Bailey-Britton as Sidney and Aurelia De Felice as Bunny.

==Critical reception==
In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Clive Barnes wrote &quot;For those of us who imagine Los Angeles as nothing but a long street in desperate search of a parking lot, Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;California Suite&quot; which opened most joyously and triumphantly at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater last night, will come as a vast relief.&quot; Less enthusiastic was the critic for &quot;New York Magazine&quot; who wrote: &quot;Sleazily written, shoddily constructed, and without a scintilla of Neil Simon&#x27;s usual slick adroitness with a gag line, this grab bag of skits...suggests that California life may have scrambled Mr. Simon&#x27;s brains.&quot;

==Film adaptation==
Simon adapted his play for a 1978 feature film directed by Herbert Ross. The cast includes Alan Alda, Jane Fonda, Walter Matthau, Bill Cosby, Richard Pryor, Elaine May, Maggie Smith, and Michael Caine. Smith won an Oscar for her performance playing an actress who is nominated for, but does not win, an Oscar.

<doc id="917505" wikidata="Q3056595" url="?curid=917505" title="Belleville washer">
<text>A Belleville washer, also known as a coned-disc spring, conical spring washer, disc spring, Belleville spring or cupped spring washer, is a conical shell which can be loaded along its axis either statically or dynamically. A Belleville washer is a type of spring shaped like a washer. It is the shape, a cone frustum, that gives the washer its characteristic spring.

The &quot;Belleville&quot; name comes from the inventor Julien Belleville who in Dunkerque, France, in 1867 patented a spring design which already contained the principle of the disc spring. The real inventor of Belleville washers is unknown.

Through the years, many profiles for disc springs have been developed. Today the most used are the profiles with or without
contact flats, while some other profiles, like disc springs with trapezoidal cross-section, have lost importance.

== Features and use ==

In the different fields, if they are used as springs or to apply a flexible pre-load to a bolted joint or bearing, Belleville washers can be used as a single spring or as a stack. In a spring-stack, disc springs can be stacked in the same or in an alternating orientation and of course it is possible to stack packets of multiple springs stacked in the same direction.

Disc springs have a number of advantageous properties compared to other types of springs:
* Very large loads can be supported with a small installation space,
* Due to the nearly unlimited number of possible combinations of individual disc springs, the characteristic curve and the column length can be further varied within additional limits,
* High service life under dynamic load if the spring is properly dimensioned,
* Provided the permissible stress is not exceeded, no impermissible relaxation occurs,
* With suitable arrangement, a large damping (high hysteresis) effect may be achieved,
* Because the springs are of an annular shape, force transmission is absolutely concentric.
Thanks to these advantageous properties, Belleville washers are today used in a large number of fields, some examples are listed in the following.

In the arms industry, Belleville springs are used, for instance, in a number of landmines e.g. the American M19, M15, M14, M1 and the Swedish Tret-Mi.59. The target (a person or vehicle) exerts pressure on the Belleville spring, causing it to exceed a trigger threshold and flip the adjacent firing pin downwards into a stab detonator, firing both it and the surrounding booster charge and main explosive filling.

Belleville washers have been used as return springs in artillery pieces, one example being the French Canet range of marine/coastal cannon from the late 1800s (75 mm, 120 mm, 152 mm).

Some makers of bolt action target rifles use Belleville washer stacks in the bolt instead of a more traditional spring to release the firing pin, as they reduce the time between trigger actuation and firing pin impact on the cartridge.

Belleville washers, without serrations which can harm the clamping surface, have no significant locking capability in bolted applications.

On aircraft (typically experimental aircraft) with wooden propellers, Belleville washers used on the mounting bolts can be useful as an indicator of swelling or shrinkage of the wood. By torquing their associated bolts to provide a specific gap between sets of washers placed with &quot;high ends&quot; facing each other, a change in relative moisture content in the propeller wood will result in a change of the gaps which is often great enough to be detected visually. As propeller balance depends on the weight of blades being equal, a radical difference in the washer gaps may indicate a difference in moisture content – and thus weight – in the adjacent blades.

In the aircraft and automotive industries (including Formula One cars) disc springs are used as vibration-damping elements because of their extremely detailed tuning ability. The Cirrus SR2x series of airplanes, uses a Belleville washer setup to damp out nose gear oscillations (or &quot;shimmy&quot;).

In the building industry, in Japan stacks of disc springs have been used under buildings as vibration dampers for earthquakes.

Belleville washers are used in some high pressure air regulators, such as those found on paintball markers and air tanks.

== Stacking ==
Multiple Belleville washers may be stacked to modify the spring constant (or spring rate) or the amount of deflection. Stacking in the same direction will add the spring constant in parallel, creating a stiffer joint (with the same deflection). Stacking in an alternating direction is the same as adding common springs in series, resulting in a lower spring constant and greater deflection. Mixing and matching directions allow a specific spring constant and deflection capacity to be designed.

Generally, if n disc springs are stacked in parallel (facing the same direction), standing the load, the deflection of the whole stack is equal to that of one disc spring divided by n, then, to obtain the same deflection of a single disc spring the load to apply has to be n times that of a single disc spring. On the other hand, if n washers are stacked in series (facing in alternating directions), standing the load, the deflection is equal to n times that of one washer while the load to apply at the whole stack to obtain the same deflection of one disc spring has to be that of a single disc spring divided by n.

== Performance considerations ==
In a parallel stack, hysteresis (load losses) will occur due to friction between the springs. The hysteresis losses can be advantageous in some systems because of the added damping and dissipation of vibration energy. This loss due to friction can be calculated using hysteresis methods. Ideally, no more than 4 springs should be placed in parallel. If a greater load is required, then factor of safety must be increased in order to compensate for loss of load due to friction. Friction loss is not as much of an issue in series stacks.

In a series stack, the deflection is not exactly proportional to the number of springs. This is because of a &quot;bottoming out&quot; effect when the springs are compressed to flat as the contact surface area increases once the spring is deflected beyond 95%. This decreases the moment arm and the spring will offer a greater spring resistance. Hysteresis can be used to calculate predicted deflections in a series stack. The number of springs used in a series stack is not as much of an issue as in parallel stacks even if, generally, the stack height should not be greater than three times the outside diameter of the disc spring. If it is not possible to avoid a longer stack, then it should be divided into 2 or possibly 3 partial stacks with suitable washers. These washers should be guided as exactly as possible.

As previously said, Belleville washers are useful for adjustments because different thicknesses can be swapped in and out and they can be configured to achieve essentially infinite tunability of spring rate while only filling up a small part of the technician&#x27;s tool box. They are ideal in situations where a heavy spring force is required with minimal free length and compression before reaching solid height. The downside, though, is weight, and they are severely travel limited compared to a conventional coil spring when free length is not an issue.

A wave washer also acts as a spring, but wave washers of comparable size do not produce as much force as Belleville washers, nor can they be stacked in series.

== Disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness ==
For disc springs with a thickness of more than 6.0 mm, DIN 2093 specifies small contact surfaces at points I and III (that is the point where the load is applied and the point where the load touches the ground) in addition to the rounded corners. These contact flats improve definition of the point of load application and, particularly for spring stacks, reduce friction at the guide rod. The result is a considerable reduction in the lever arm length and a corresponding increase in the spring load. This is in turn compensated for by a reduction in the spring thickness.

The reduced thickness is specified in accordance with the following conditions:
* The overall height remains unaltered,
* The width of the contact flats (that is the annulus width) is to be approximately 1/150 of the outside diameter,
* The load applied to the reduced-thickness spring to obtain a deflection equal to the 75% of the free height (of an unreduced spring) must be the same as for an unreduced spring.
As the overall height is not reduced, springs with reduced thickness inevitably have an increased flank angle and a greater cone height than springs of the same nominal dimension without reduced thickness. Therefore, the characteristic curve is altered and becomes completely different.

== Calculation ==

Starting from 1936, when J. O. Almen and A.Làszlò published a simplified method of calculation, always more accurate and complex methods appeared also in order to include in calculations disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness. So, although today there are more accurate methods of calculation, the most used are the simple and convenient formulas of DIN 2092 as, for standard dimensions, they produce values which correspond well to the measured results.

Considering a Belleville washer with outside diameter formula_1, inside diameter formula_2, height formula_3 and thickness formula_4, where formula_5 is the free height, that is the difference between the height and the thickness, the following coefficients are obtained:

: formula_6
: formula_7

: formula_8

: formula_9
The equation to calculate the load to apply to a single disc spring in order to obtain a deflection formula_10 is:

: formula_11

Note that for disc springs with constant thickness, formula_12 is equal to formula_4 and consequently formula_14 is 1.

For what concerns disc springs with contact flats and reduced thickness it has to be said that a paper published in July 2013, demonstrated that the formula_14 equation as defined inside the standard norms is not correct as it would result in every reduced thickness being considered right and this is, of course, impossible. As written in that paper formula_14 should be replaced with a new coefficient, formula_17, which depends not only from the formula_18 ratio but also from the flank angles of the spring.

The spring constant (or spring rate) is defined as:

: formula_19 

If friction and bottoming-out effects are ignored, the spring rate of a stack of identical Belleville washers can be quickly approximated. Counting from one end of the stack, group by the number of adjacent washers in parallel. For example, in the stack of washers to the right, the grouping is 2-3-1-2, because there is a group of 2 washers in parallel, then a group of 3, then a single washer, then another group of 2.

The total spring coefficient is:

: formula_20

: formula_21

: formula_22

Where
* formula_23= the number of washers in the ith group
* formula_24 = the number of groups
* formula_25 = the spring constant of one washer
So, a 2-3-1-2 stack (or, since addition is commutative, a 3-2-2-1 stack) gives a spring constant of 3/7 that of a single washer. These same 8 washers can be arranged in a 3-3-2 configuration (formula_26), a 4-4 configuration (formula_27), a 2-2-2-2 configuration (formula_28), and various other configurations. The number of unique ways to stack formula_29 washers is defined by the integer partition function &quot;p&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and increases rapidly with large formula_29, allowing fine-tuning of the spring constant. However, each configuration will have a different length, requiring the use of shims in most cases.

<text>Michael Maze (born 1 September 1981) is a professional table tennis player from Faxe, Denmark, in men&#x27;s singles and doubles. In 2005 he was one of the top five left-handed players in the world. His strength was in his strong forehand loop and lobbing. He was one of the best defensive lobbers in the world. His strong forehand loop, his forehand pendulum serve, and his confident defensive play away from the table made him a solid all-around player. He competed at four Olympic Games.

== Career ==

Maze won the European Junior Championships in both singles and doubles in 1999. He reached the quarterfinals in the European Championships for seniors in both series in 2003 playing doubles with Finn Tugwell. Tugwell and Maze participated as partners at the 2000 Summer Olympics where they reached the round of 16. Before the 2004 Summer Olympics, Maze won the Europe Top-12 tournament in Frankfurt am Main in February 2004. He participated both in men&#x27;s singles and men&#x27;s doubles in the 2004 Olympics. Maze lost his first match in singles but won bronze with his partner Finn Tugwell.

Another of Maze&#x27;s achievements was reaching the semifinals of the 2005 World Championships that took place in Shanghai, China, in which he was defeated by the home favorite, Ma Lin, in a swift 4–0 match. Nevertheless, he had managed to put up a memorable performance in the quarterfinals of the competition, coming back from a 3–0 deficit to win 4–3 against another Chinese player, Hao Shuai, saving 3 match points, as well as a win in the previous match against 2004 Olympics Men&#x27;s singles silver medallist Wang Hao, again from the host nation. Michael Maze won the prize &quot;BT Gold&quot; as the biggest Danish sportsperson in 2005.

Maze won European bronze in singles in 2007. In 2009, Maze had reached the quarterfinals of 2009 World Table Tennis Championships, held in Yokohama, Japan. He was the only European player to achieve the quarters, beating Greek player Panagiotis Gionis at last 16 Round. On 20 September 2009 he defeated Werner Schlager in the final of the European Championships held in Stuttgart, Germany after defeating the German player Timo Boll in the semis.

Maze (representing Denmark) was defeated during the 2012 Olympics by Dimitrij Ovtcharov (representing Germany) in the Men&#x27;s Singles Quarter Final. His coach is the former Chinese National Team Coach Hu Wei Xin.

On 14 March 2016, Michael Maze announced the end of his Table Tennis career. He was hoping to compete at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics.

Maze announced his retirement in 2016, saying &quot;after several operations I can no longer train one hundred per cent without pain and therefore not compete at the level I’m used to.&quot;

In February 2018, Maze announced his return to competitive sport.

<doc id="917524" wikidata="Q2054210" url="?curid=917524" title="I Am Curious (Yellow)">
<text>I Am Curious (Yellow) (, ) is a 1967 Swedish erotic drama film written and directed by Vilgot Sjöman, starring Sjöman and Lena Nyman. It is a companion film to 1968&#x27;s &quot;I Am Curious (Blue)&quot;; the two were initially intended to be one hour film.

== Plot ==

Director Vilgot Sjöman plans to make a social film starring his lover (played by Lena Nyman), a young theatre student who has a strong interest in social issues.

Nyman&#x27;s character, also named Lena, lives with her father in a small apartment in Stockholm and is driven by a burning passion for social justice and a need to understand the world, people and relationships. Her little room is filled with books, papers, and boxes full of clippings on topics such as &quot;religion&quot; and &quot;men&quot;, and files on each of the 23 men with whom she has had sex. The walls are covered with pictures of concentration camps and a portrait of Francisco Franco, reminders of the crimes being perpetrated against humanity. She walks around Stockholm and interviews people about social classes in society, conscientious objection, gender equality, and the morality of vacationing in Franco&#x27;s Spain. She and her friends also picket embassies and travel agencies. Lena&#x27;s relationship with her father, who briefly went to Spain to fight Franco as part of the International Brigades, is problematic, and she is distressed by the fact that he returned from Spain for unknown reasons after only a short period.

Through her father Lena meets the slick Bill (Börje in the original Swedish), who works at a menswear shop and voted for the Rightist Party. They begin a love affair, but Lena soon finds out from her father that Bill has another woman, Marie, and a young daughter. Lena is furious that Bill has not been open with her, and goes to the country on a bicycle holiday. Alone in a cabin in the woods, she attempts an ascetic life-style, meditating, studying nonviolence and practicing yoga. Bill soon comes looking for her in his new car. She greets him with a shotgun, but they soon make love. Lena confronts Bill about Marie, and finds out about another of his lovers, Madeleine. They fight and Bill leaves. Lena has strange dreams, in which she ties two teams of soccer players – she notes that they number 23 – to a tree, shoots Bill and cuts his penis off. She also dreams of being taunted by passing drivers as she cycles down a road, until finally Martin Luther King Jr. drives up. She apologizes to him for not being strong enough to practice nonviolence.

Lena returns home, destroys her room, and goes to the car showroom where Bill works to tell him she has scabies. They are treated at a clinic, and then go their separate ways. As the embedded story of Lena and Bill begins to resolve, the film crew and director Sjöman are featured more. The relationship between Lena the actress and Bill the actor has become intimate during the production of Vilgot&#x27;s film, and Vilgot is jealous and clashes with Bill. The film concludes with Lena returning Vilgot&#x27;s keys as he meets with another young female theatre student.

=== Nonfictional content === 
The film includes an interview with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., filmed in March 1966, when King was visiting Stockholm along with Harry Belafonte with a view to starting a new initiative for Swedish support of African Americans. The film also includes an interview with the Minister of Transportation, Olof Palme (later Prime Minister of Sweden), who talks about the existence of class structure in Swedish society (he was told it was for a documentary film), and footage of the Russian poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko.

==Release==
===Censorship===
The film includes numerous and frank scenes of nudity and staged sexual intercourse. One particularly controversial scene features Lena kissing her lover&#x27;s (Borje&#x27;s) flaccid penis. Released in Sweden in October 1967, it was released in the U.S. in March 1969, immediately attracting a ban in Massachusetts for being pornographic, with the Boston Police Department seizing the film reels from the Symphony Cinemas I &amp; II on Huntington Avenue. After proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (&quot;Karalexis v. Byrne&quot;, 306 F. Supp. 1363 (D. Mass. 1969)), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the Supreme Court of the United States (&quot;Byrne v. Karalexis&quot;, 396 U.S. 976 (1969) and 401 U.S. 216 (1971)), the Second Circuit found the film not to be obscene.

The Maryland film censorship board banned the film&#x27;s exhibition in the state on 8 July 1969, in a decision backed by Francis B. Burch, who was the state&#x27;s attorney general at the time; he described the film as hard-core pornography. The ruling was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union, and although an appeals court eventually declared that the film was not obscene, the ban was ultimately upheld with a split 4-3 vote. On 3 December 1969, in response to the ruling, the film&#x27;s American importer, Grove Press, took the case for distributing the film in all states to the US Supreme Court, sparking a legal battle that spanned three years, ultimately ending in 1972, when Grove Press agreed to remove a minute and a half from the film for its Maryland showing.

An arsonist set a fire in the Heights Theatre in Houston during the film&#x27;s run there. In April 1970, sheriff&#x27;s deputies in Pensacola, Florida, seized prints of &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot;, as well as &quot;Dracula (The Dirty Old Man)&quot;, from the Ritz Theatre on N Tarragona St; the theater&#x27;s manager was charged with &quot;two counts of unlawful showing of an obscene film and maintaining a public nuisance&quot;.

The film opened at the Vogue Art Theater in Denver, Colorado on 8 August 1969; hours after it opened there, it was seized by District Attorney Mike McKevitt, who promptly banned the film from being shown in the city, due to it violating a then-new obscenity law that was passed in the state; McKevitt had complained to District Judge Edward J. Byrne that the film was &quot;obscene and pornographic&quot;. The film&#x27;s ban was challenged by its US importers, who succeeded in getting attorney Edward H. Sherman to return the film on 13 August 1969. On 21 August 1969, Byrne labelled the ban an act of censorship and a &quot;prior restraint on the defendants&#x27; right to freedom of speech&quot;; subsequent to this, he lifted the ban on the film. The film reopened at the Vogue Art on 22 August 1969, with 400 customers being reported as being in attendance.

Among other Scandinavian nations, it was allowed uncut in Denmark, but was banned from being played in Norway due to its heavy sexual content.

The film was censored by as much as 49 seconds in Australia between 1970 and 1971. In the United Kingdom, John Trevelyan, a secretary of the British Board of Film Censors trimmed the film by eight minutes, reducing its running time to 114 minutes.

===Box office===
The film was popular at the box office and was the 12th most popular film in the United States and Canada in 1969 and the highest-grossing foreign-language film in the United States and Canada of all-time with a gross of $20,238,100. It was number one at the US box office for two weeks in November 1969. One reason it did so well was that it became popular among film stars to be seen going to the film. News of Johnny Carson seeing the film legitimized going to see it despite any misgivings about possible pornographic content. Jacqueline Onassis went to see the movie, judo-felling an awaiting news photographer, Mel Finkelstein, alerted by the theatre manager, while leaving the theatre during the showing.

===Critical reception===
====Contemporary====
Initial reception to Curious Yellow was divided. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; referred to it as a &quot;Good, serious movie about a society in transition&quot;, and Norman Mailer said he felt &quot;like a better man&quot; after having seen it. Conversely, Rex Reed described the film as &quot;about as good for you as drinking furniture polish&quot; and Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; lambasted it as &quot;a dog... a real dog&quot; and &quot;stupid and slow and uninteresting&quot;. Rex Reed said the movie was &quot;vile and disgusting&quot; and Sjöman was &quot;a very sick Swede with an overwhelming ego and a fondness for photographing pubic hair&quot;, but Norman Mailer described it as &quot;one of the most important pictures I have ever seen in my life&quot;.

In the UK, Patrick Gibbs of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote that &quot;there&#x27;s not much for patrons in this cinema-verite material, presented in the Godard style as if it were holy writ.&quot; Penelope Mortimer of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote that &quot;it is publicised as being very sexy. I have no more to say about it, except that that is a lie.&quot; Alexander Walker of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; remarked that as a result of having been cut in the UK, it &quot;will now never satisfy the curiosity of people who know it as the first Swedish film to show the sex act. Every scene of that kind has been severely &#x27;reduced&#x27; by our censor and we are left with a dull film of almost parochial impact about a girl public opinion-tester endlessly asking Swedes their views of class, colour, war and pacificism—oddly enough, not sex, unless you take a protest poster that reads &#x27;COLOURED PEOPLE BE PREPARED—THE WHITES ARE STAGGERING&#x27; to fall into that category.&quot;

====Retrospective====
In 1974, when an uncut version of the film debuted in Australia, critic Colin Bennett of &quot;The Age&quot; remarked that &quot;almost the only fascination now lies in the revelation of what was considered far too notorious to be imported into [Australia] a few short years ago&quot;, adding that &quot;sociologically, this satirical stuff may have had more point in 1967 Sweden, and I suppose it does reveal a modicum about Scandinavian social attitudes. It is also peculiarly dated. [...] One finds oneself no longer curious.&quot;

In recent years, &quot;Yellow&quot; has received some reappraisal, thanks in part to Gary Giddins, who authored the 2003 essay accompanying the Criterion Collection DVD release, and a review by Nathan Southern on the All Movie Guide website. Southern assesses the picture as &quot;a droll and sophisticated comedy about the emotional, political, social, and sexual liberation of a young woman... a real original that has suffered from public incomprehension since its release and is crying out for reassessment and rediscovery&quot;.

As of August 2015, &quot;I Am Curious (Yellow)&quot; received a 52% rating based on 25 reviews, 13 &quot;fresh&quot; and 12 &quot;rotten&quot; on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes.

===Awards and honors===

Nyman won the award for Best Actress at the 5th Guldbagge Awards for her role in this film and &quot;I Am Curious (Blue)&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Various television series have episodes with similar titles, such as &quot;Get Smart&quot; series finale &quot;I Am Curiously Yellow&quot;; &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (&quot;I Am Curious, Maddie&quot;); &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;I Am Furious (Yellow)&quot;); &quot;That Girl&quot; (&quot;I Am Curious Lemon&quot;); &quot;Ed, Edd n Eddy&quot; (&quot;I Am Curious Ed&quot;); and &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; (&quot;I Am Curious...Partridge&quot;).

Additionally, an issue of &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;, named &quot;I Am Curious (Black)&quot;, focuses on Lois Lane, who becomes a black woman for a day to experience racism.

In the &quot;Mad Men&quot; seventh season episode &quot;The Strategy&quot;, Don Draper references having just seen this movie in a theatre.

Episode 285 of &quot;This American Life&quot; featured a story called &quot;I Am Curious, Jello,&quot; which followed up on the censorship trial between Los Angeles prosecutor Michael Guarino and Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra two decades after the case was thrown out of court.

American car manufacturer Plymouth introduced a special order color for 1971. &quot;Curious Yellow&quot; is a vibrant greenish yellow, one of their &quot;High-Impact&quot; colors.

The eleventh studio album by the English post-punk band The Fall makes reference to the film in its title, &quot;I Am Kurious Oranj&quot;.

It made a question in &quot;Trivial Pursuit&quot;: &quot;What Swedish sex film caused a stir in 1967?&quot; Answer: &quot;I am Curious (Yellow)&quot;.

<text>The Pilatus PC-9 is a single-engine, low-wing tandem-seat turboprop training aircraft designed and manufactured by Pilatus Aircraft of Switzerland.

Developed as a more powerful evolution of the preceding Pilatus PC-7, the PC-9 features an enlarged cockpit and a ventral airbrake while possessing only a low level of structural commonality with its predecessor. During May 1985, the maiden flight of the prototype PC-9 was conducted; four months later, type certification was received and permitting deliveries to commence that same year. During the mid-1980s, Pilatus teamed up with British Aerospace to market the PC-9; the first production order for the type was placed by the Royal Saudi Air Force.

Production of the PC-9 has continued into the twenty-first century and in excess of 250 aircraft have been produced across five different variants. One of these variants, the Beechcraft T-6A Texan II, has been produced under licence by the American firm Beechcraft in the United States. The PC-9 has also been assembled by the Australian company Hawker de Havilland. The PC-9 has been employed by a number of military and civilian operators around the world, including the Swiss Air Force, Croatian Air Force, Royal Thai Air Force and the Irish Air Corps. It has been flown by aerobatics teams, such as the Royal Thai Air Force&#x27;s Blue Phoenix and the Royal Australian Air Force&#x27;s Roulettes. Furthermore, the type has occasionally been involved in combat operations.

==Design and development==
===Background===
The origins of the PC-9 can be traced back to the earlier PC-7 from which it evolved. This preceding trainer aircraft had been developed during the mid-1970s and became one of the most successful turboprop trainers of that decade. Rapid changes in the global trainer market, particularly the availability of more powerful fighter and light attack aircraft, led to training syllabuses undergoing major shifts and impacted customer expectations for trainer aircraft. Specifically, operators sought to reduce the number of stages and aircraft types involved in training in order to reduce both time and cost.

During the early 1980s, Pilatus commenced work on a series of design studies towards what would become the PC-9. From the onset, the PC-9 was designed to function as both an ab initio and advanced trainer without the need for an intermediate stage. It is suitable for performing primary, intermediate, transition, aerobatic and weapons training, amongst other tasks.

The PC-9 is a tandem-seat single-engine military trainer aircraft capable of relatively high performance. In comparison to the PC-7, this new aircraft was almost 300 kg heavier, possessing a lengthened nose along with an elongated cockpit and canopy. It was largely an all-new design, despite the similarities to its predecessor. Amongst other improvements, the ejection seats within the cockpit were stepped (providing better visibility from the rear position) while a ventral airbrake was also added.

===Launch and flight testing===
During 1982, the PC-9 program was officially launched. Although some aerodynamic elements were tested on a PC-7 during 1982 and 1983, the maiden flight of the first PC-9 prototype took place on 7 May 1984. A second prototype flew on 20 July of the same year; this prototype featured all the standard electronic flight instrumentation and environmental control systems installed and was thus almost fully representative of the production version. While not fitted as standard, a head-up display (HUD) and onboard oxygen generation system could be optionally fitted.

During 1984, Pilatus teamed up with British Aerospace to promote the PC-9 to fill a requirement to replace the Royal Air Force’s (RAF) BAC Jet Provost trainer fleet. In September 1985, type certification was achieved. However, by this point, the PC-9 had lost the RAF trainer competition to the Short Tucano. However, the marketing links that Pilatus built up with British Aerospace during this competition remained in place, and reportedly contributed to the type’s first order, for 30 aircraft, being received from Saudi Arabia.

===Into production and further development===
During 1985, quantity production of an initial batch of 10 aircraft commenced. In December of that year, a key early order for 67 PC-9s was received from the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). On 19 May 1987, the first production aircraft for the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) performed its maiden flight. Pilatus referred to the Australian aircraft by the designation &quot;PC-9/A&quot;, as they were produced under licence in Australia by Hawker de Havilland and featured extensive Australian-sourced content. During 1992, the final Australian-built PC-9 was delivered.

In the early 1990s, Pilatus worked with the American aircraft manufacturer Beechcraft to jointly develop the &quot;Beech Pilatus PC-9 Mk. II&quot;, an extensively modified version of the PC-9, that was entered into the United States JPATS programme. Subsequently rebranded as the Beechcraft T-6A Texan II, the aircraft emerged victorious in June 1995. Shortly thereafter, Beechcraft established a US-based assembly line and commenced production of the type. Over 700 aircraft are to be built for the United States Air Force and United States Navy

By 2000, the original PC-9 model was not being actively produced, although the type remained available for customers to order. Ten years later, production of the type (with the exception of the T-6 Texan II) had been halted; Pilatus was reportedly prepared to restart production if further orders were secured. Approximately 276 PC-9s had reportedly been delivered by this point. 

==Operational history==
While the vast majority of PC-9s were sold to military operators, at least 15 were believed to have been sold to commercial or civilian entities. At one point, the German airline Condor operated 10 PC-9s that have been configured to perform target-towing duties. During early 2023, the German branch of Qinetiq acquired nine secondhand PC-9Bs, adding to the three aircraft it already operated, which it used to provide aerial training services, attack controller and close air support training to external parties including the German armed forces.

On 22 March 1991, a pair of United States Air Force F-15C Eagles were patrolling over Iraqi airspace, as part of Operation Provide Comfort, when they detected two contacts on radar, after which the F-15s approached to visually identify them - a PC-9 and a Sukhoi Su-22. The Su 22 was promptly shot down by one F-15 while the pilot of the PC-9, upon becoming aware that they were being engaged, opted to eject from the aircraft. The F-15 confirmed the pilots’ parachute deployment and survival before flying in formation with the unoccupied PC-9 until it descended and crashed into the ground just under two minutes later.

Between 1991 and 1996, the United States Army operated three PC-9s as chase and test aircraft. These were eventually sold to Slovenia in 1995.

During the 1990s, Pilatus started production of the improved PC-9M. In 1997, Croatia bought 17 aircraft while neighbouring Slovenia also placed an order for nine (nicknamed &quot;Hudournik&quot; – &quot;Swift&quot;) in December of that same year. During January 1999, Oman ordered 12 examples; four years later, Ireland also signed a contract for eight aircraft. In 2004, Bulgaria purchased 12 PC-7Ms. Mexico took delivery of at least two aircraft in September 2006. Fulfilment of the variant’s final order, placed by Ireland for a single attrition replacement aircraft, took place in 2017.

Various operators have flown PC-9s in dedicated formation aerobatic display teams. For a time, it was used by the Roulettes of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF). During 2012, the Royal Thai Air Force created the Blue Phoenix aerobatics team; it performs aerial displays using up to five PC-9s, which have a distinctive blue, white and red paint scheme and furnished with white smoke generators.

During 2008, Chad&#x27;s operation of the PC-9 became politically controversial when the type was allegedly used to attack dissidents, which was considered to be a breach of Swiss export controls.

In August 2015, Pilatus received a contract to deliver nine PC-9Ms to the Royal Jordanian Air Force, however, during April 2016, this order was changed to eight Pilatus PC-21s instead. Deliveries were due to start in January 2017 under the original deal. The PC-21 is a newer and more capable trainer that had effectively succeeded the PC-9 during the 2010s. On 6 December 2019, the final batch of RAAF to fly the PC-9s graduated, the type having been supplanted by recently procured PC-21s.

<text>The Tawa River is a tributary of the Narmada River of Central India.

==Course==
The Tawa is the Narmada&#x27;s largest tributary, at 172 km. It rises in the Satpura Range of Betul and flowing north and west, joins the Narmada at the village of Bandra Bhan in Hoshangabad District.

==Dam==
In 1958, construction began on Tawa Dam, which was completed in 1978 in Tawa Nagar to create Tawa Reservoir in southern Hoshangabad District. Forty-four villages were submerged by the reservoir.

==Surroundings==
India&#x27;s oldest forest preserve, the Bori Reserve Forest, was established in 1865 along the Tawa. The Bori Reserve Forest is part of the Bori Sanctuary, which is part of the Pachmarhi Biosphere Reserve, established in 1999, which covers much of the upper watershed of the Tawa.

<text>The Audi 50 (known internally as &quot;Typ 86&quot;) is a small supermini car produced by German automaker Audi from 1974 to 1978, and sold only in Europe. Introduced two and three years after the French Renault 5 and the Italian Fiat 127 respectively, the Audi 50 and its VW Polo twin were seen at the time as Germany&#x27;s first home-grown entrant in Europe&#x27;s emerging class of &quot;supermini&quot; hatchbacks, supplanting a generation of small and often rear-engined economy cars.

==History==
===Development and design===
Audi had noticed the fast growth in popularity of small, front-wheel drive cars with a large, upward swinging rear hatch, top-hinged at the rear edge of the roof, and a maximised rear space that could be flexibly used. In the 1960s, hatchbacks were still an innovative vehicle concept, and Audi began thinking of such a car in 1968. When NSU folded into the Volkswagen group, and was initially merged into &quot;Audi NSU Auto Union AG&quot;, plans became firmer.

Audi NSU&#x27;s design and development center in Ingolstadt was opened, and project K50 (&quot;Kolben&quot; 50), was started, initially intended to replace NSU&#x27;s line-up of small, rear-engined sedans. Project K50 was developed in a very short time of just 21 months.

Supervised by Audi boss and chief-engineer Ludwig Kraus, the Audi/NSU 50 was designed by Bertone&#x27;s chief designer Marcello Gandini, while Audi&#x27;s own Claus Luthe finalised the design of the car&#x27;s modern, stylish unitary bodywork.

Within the Volkswagen Audi NSU group, it was initially preferred to market the K50 as an Audi, because the NSU brand, with their daring, aerodynamic, rotary engine powered NSU Ro80 saloon, was viewed too extravagant to fit well in Volkswagen&#x27;s house – plus: since 1965, Audi had made an impressive come-back under Ludwig Kraus&#x27; lead, with fresh cars, in tune with the late sixties European automobile Zeitgeist.
The 50 aligned with, and would extend, Audi&#x27;s line-up of up-to-date, modern technology cars – in contrast to Volkswagen&#x27;s line-up of almost entirely old-school, rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout cars. Only the NSU-developed, &quot;Volkswagen K70&quot; badged compact sedan (originally intended to bridge the gap between NSU&#x27;s small cars and their upper middle-class Ro80), added a modern, front-wheel drive, boxy and stylish mid-market sedan to top VW&#x27;s range, from 1970.

===Technology and models===
The Audi 50 offered a single, three-door hatchback body-style with a folding rear seat for maximum space utilisation and flexibility. A single transversely front-mounted water-cooled, overhead camshaft petrol engine produced either a base , or a higher output for the LS and GL versions. Metallic paint could be selected, and the GL trim had a more plushly appointed interior, and extra chrome details.

The Audi&#x27;s front suspension is independent, by MacPherson struts, using telescopic coil over shocks, and single, transverse lower A-arms. The twist-beam rear suspension was simple yet advanced for its day, using a semi-independent, C- or Hshaped combination of longitudinal (semi-)trailing arms, welded together with a transverse anti-roll bar, also completed by coil springs and shock absorbers. The Audi 50 had standard disc brakes up front, and redundant (split) hydraulic brake circuits.

Model updates starting in 1976, further improving the car&#x27;s aerodynamics. The GLS replaced the GL, with more standard equipment, including adjustable headrests, and even more chrome on the hubcaps. In 1977, a bigger engine became a GLS option.

===Production===
The Audi 50 was built by Audi NSU Auto Union AG at the former NSU factory in Neckarsulm, Germany, and at the giant Wolfsburg plant by Volkswagen.

===Rebadging as Volkswagen Polo===
The car was also turned into a Volkswagen just six weeks later, rebadged as the Volkswagen Polo, and offered with more choice of engines and other options. The Volkswagen Polo was launched in the home market in September 1974 but appeared in export markets, including the United Kingdom, several months later – in the Netherlands, in March 1975.

The VW Polo twin was cheaper, and marketed a bit more as an economy car.

===Audi 50 discontinued, while VW Polo continues===
The model was popular in Europe, both because of its generous specifications for a car of the time, and on account of its relatively low price. The Volkswagen and Audi badged models were sold alongside each other for three years until 1978, but the cheaper Volkswagen Polo outsold the Audi 50 almost immediately, and Audi discontinued the Audi 50 in 1978, after a total production of 180,812 units. A planned facelift, which would have given the Audi 50 a look closer to that of the Audi 100 and Audi 80 was never implemented, because of a holding company board decision that the Audi brand should concentrate on larger, more expensive cars.

The Volkswagen Polo range continued to evolve, with the Volkswagen Derby notchback version, despite being developed by Audi at Ingolstadt, branded as a Volkswagen and launched in 1977. Subsequently, the Volkswagen Polo has evolved through numerous generations to the present day.

===Successor===
The Audi 50 had no replacement in the supermini class, until the launch of the significantly larger Audi A2 in November 1999, which was also discontinued in August 2005.

In August 2010, the car was spiritually succeeded by the Audi A1, although, 35 years after the Audi 50 launch, the &quot;supermini&quot; B-segment had grown so much that the first A1 was as big as a 1980s &quot;C-segment&quot; Volkswagen Golf Mk2

<text>A coiled coil is a structural motif in proteins in which 2–7 alpha-helices are coiled together like the strands of a rope. (Dimers and trimers are the most common types.) They have been found in roughly 5-10% of proteins and have a variety of functions. They are one of the most widespread motifs found in protein-protein interactions. To aid protein study, several tools have been developed to predict coiled-coils in protein structures. Many coiled coil-type proteins are involved in important biological functions, such as the regulation of gene expression — e.g., transcription factors. Notable examples are the oncoproteins c-Fos and c-Jun, as well as the muscle protein tropomyosin. 

==Discovery==

The possibility of coiled coils for α-keratin was initially somewhat controversial. Linus Pauling and Francis Crick independently came to the conclusion that this was possible at about the same time. In the summer of 1952, Pauling visited the laboratory in England where Crick worked. Pauling and Crick met and spoke about various topics; at one point, Crick asked whether Pauling had considered &quot;coiled coils&quot; (a term Crick came up with), to which Pauling said he had. Upon returning to the United States, Pauling resumed research on the topic. He concluded that coiled coils exist, and submitted a lengthy manuscript to the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in October. Pauling&#x27;s son Peter Pauling worked at the same lab as Crick, and mentioned the report to him. Crick believed that Pauling had stolen his idea, and submitted a shorter note to &quot;Nature&quot; a few days after Pauling&#x27;s manuscript arrived. Eventually, after some controversy and frequent correspondences, Crick&#x27;s lab declared that the idea had been reached independently by both researchers, and that no intellectual theft had occurred. In his note (which was published first due to its shorter length), Crick proposed the &quot;coiled coil&quot; and as well as mathematical methods for determining their structure. Remarkably, this was soon after the structure of the alpha helix was suggested in 1951 by Linus Pauling and coworkers. These studies were published in the absence of knowledge of a keratin sequence. The first keratin sequences were determined by Hanukoglu and Fuchs in 1982.

Based on sequence and secondary structure prediction analyses identified the coiled-coil domains of keratins. These models have been confirmed by structural analyses of coiled-coil domains of keratins.

==Molecular structure==

Coiled coils usually contain a repeated pattern, &quot;hxxhcxc&quot;, of hydrophobic (&quot;h&quot;) and charged (&quot;c&quot;) amino-acid residues, referred to as a heptad repeat.
The positions in the heptad repeat are usually labeled &quot;abcdefg&quot;, where &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the hydrophobic positions, often being occupied by isoleucine, leucine, or valine. Folding a sequence with this repeating pattern into an alpha-helical secondary structure causes the hydrophobic residues to be presented as a &#x27;stripe&#x27; that coils gently around the helix in left-handed fashion, forming an amphipathic structure. The most favorable way for two such helices to arrange themselves in the water-filled environment of the cytoplasm is to wrap the hydrophobic strands against each other sandwiched between the hydrophilic amino acids. Thus, it is the burial of hydrophobic surfaces that provides the thermodynamic driving force for the oligomerization. The packing in a coiled-coil interface is exceptionally tight, with almost complete van der Waals contact between the side-chains of the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; residues. This tight packing was originally predicted by Francis Crick in 1952 and is referred to as Knobs into holes packing.

The α-helices may be parallel or anti-parallel, and usually adopt a &quot;left-handed&quot; super-coil (Figure 1). Although disfavored, a few &quot;right-handed&quot; coiled coils have also been observed in nature and in designed proteins.

==Biological roles==
As coiled-coil domains are common among a significant amount of proteins in a wide variety of protein families, they help proteins fulfill various functions in the cell. Their primary feature is to facilitate protein-protein interaction and keep proteins or domains interlocked. This feature corresponds to several subfunctions, including membrane fusion, molecular spacing, oligomerization tags, vesicle movement, aid in movement proteins, cell structure, and more.

===Membrane fusion===
A coiled coil domain plays a role in HIV infection. Viral entry into CD4-positive cells commences when three subunits of a glycoprotein 120 (gp120) bind to CD4 receptor and a coreceptor. Glycoprotein gp120 is closely associated with a trimer of gp41 via van der Waals interactions. Eventually, the gp41 N-terminal fusion peptide sequence anchors into the host cell. A spring-loaded mechanism is responsible for bringing the viral and cell membranes in close enough proximity that they will fuse. The origin of the spring-loaded mechanism lies within the exposed gp41, which contains two consecutive heptad repeats (HR1 and HR2) following the fusion peptide at the N terminus of the protein. HR1 forms a parallel, trimeric coiled coil onto which HR2 region coils, forming the trimer-of-hairpins (or six-helix bundle) structure, thereby facilitating membrane fusion through bringing the membranes close to each other. The virus then enters the cell and begins its replication. Recently, inhibitors derived from HR2 such as Fuzeon (DP178, T-20) that bind to the HR1 region on gp41 have been developed. However, peptides derived from HR1 have little viral inhibition efficacy due to the propensity for these peptides to aggregate in solution. Chimeras of these HR1-derived peptides with GCN4 leucine zippers have been developed and have shown to be more active than Fuzeon.

The proteins SNAP-25, synaptobrevin, and syntaxin-1 have alpha-helices which interact with each other to form a coiled-coil SNARE complex. Zippering the domains together provides the necessary energy for vesicle fusion to occur.

=== Molecular spacers ===
The coiled-coil motif may also act as a spacer between two objects within a cell. The lengths of these molecular spacer coiled-coil domains are highly conserved. The purpose of these molecular spacers may be to separate protein domains, thus keeping them from interacting, or to separate vesicles within the cell to mediate vesicle transport. An example of this first purpose is Omp‐α found in &quot;T. maritima&quot;. Other proteins keep vesicles apart, such as p115, giantin, and GM130 which interact with each other via coiled-coil motifs and act as a tether between the Golgi and a nearby vesicle. The family of proteins related to this activity of tethering vesicles to the Golgi are known as golgins. Finally, there are several proteins with coiled-coil domains involved in the kinetochore, which keeps chromosomes separated during cell division. These proteins include Ndc-80, and Nuf2p. Related proteins interact with microtubules during cell division, of which mutation leads to cell death.

===As oligomerization tags===
Because of their specific interaction coiled coils can be used as &quot;tags&quot; to stabilize or enforce a specific oligomerization state. A coiled coil interaction has been observed to drive the oligomerization of the BBS2 and BBS7 subunits of the BBSome. Because coiled-coils generally interact with other coiled coils, they are found in proteins which are required to form dimers or tetramers with more copies of themselves. Because of their ability in driving protein oligomerization, they have also been studied in their use in forming synthetic nanostructures.

==Design==

The general problem of deciding on the folded structure of a protein when given the amino acid sequence (the so-called protein folding problem) has only been solved partially. However, the coiled coil is one of a relatively small number of folding motifs for which the relationships between the sequence and the final folded structure are comparatively well understood. Harbury &quot;et al.&quot; performed a landmark study using an archetypal coiled coil, GCN4, in which rules that govern the way that peptide sequence affects the oligomeric state (that is, the number of alpha-helices in the final assembly) were established. The GCN4 coiled coil is a 31-amino-acid (which equates to just over four &quot;heptads&quot;) parallel, dimeric (i.e., consisting of two alpha-helices) coiled coil and has a repeated isoleucine (or I, in single-letter code) and leucine (L) at the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; positions, respectively, and forms a dimeric coiled coil. When the amino acids in the &quot;a&quot; and &quot;d&quot; positions were changed from I at &quot;a&quot; and L at &quot;d&quot; to I at &quot;a&quot; and I at &quot;d&quot;, a trimeric (three alpha-helices) coiled coil was formed. Furthermore, switching the positions of L to &quot;a&quot; and I to &quot;d&quot; resulted in the formation of a tetrameric (four alpha-helices) coiled coil. These represent a set of rules for the determination of coiled coil oligomeric states and allows scientists to effectively &quot;dial-in&quot; the oligomerization behavior. Another aspect of coiled coil assembly that is relatively well understood, at least in the case of dimeric coiled coils, is that placing a polar residue (in particular asparagine, N) at opposing &quot;a&quot; positions forces parallel assembly of the coiled coil. This effect is due to a self-complementary hydrogen bonding between these residues, which would go unsatisfied if an N were paired with, for instance, an L on the opposing helix.

It was recently demonstrated by Peacock, Pikramenou and co-workers that coiled coils may be self-assembled using lanthanide(III) ions as a template, thus producing novel imaging agents.

== Biomedical applications ==

Coiled-coil motifs have been experimented on as possible building block for nanostructures, in part because of their simple design and wide range of function based primarily on facilitating protein-protein interaction. Simple guidelines for de novo synthesis of new proteins containing coiled-coil domains have led to many applications being hypothesized, including drug delivery, regenerating tissue, protein origami, and much more. In regards to drug delivery, coiled-coil domains would help overcome some of the hazards of chemotherapeutic drugs, by keeping them from leaking into healthy tissue as they are transported to their target. Coiled-coil domains can be made to bind to specific proteins or cell surface markers, allowing for more precise targeting in drug delivery. Other functions would be to help store and transport drugs within the body that would otherwise degrade rapidly, by creating nanotubes and other structure svia the interlocking of coiled-coil motifs. By utilizing the function of oligomerization of proteins via coiled-coil domains, antigen display can be amplified in vaccines, increasing their effectiveness.

The oligomerization of coiled-coil motifs allows for the creation of protein origami and protein building blocks. Metal-ligand interactions, covalent bonds, and ionic interactions have been studied to manipulate possible coiled-coil interactions in this field of study. Several different nanostructures can be made by combining coiled-coil motifs such that they are self-assembling building blocks. However, several difficulties remain with stability. Using peptides with coiled-coil motifs for scaffolding has made it easier to create 3D structures for cell culturing. 3D hydrogels can be made with these peptides, and then cells may be loaded into the matrix. This has applications in the study of tissue, tissue engineering, and more.

<text>An industrial musical is a musical performed internally for the employees or shareholders of a business to create a feeling of being part of a team, to entertain, and/or to educate and motivate the management and salespeople to improve sales and profits. It can be used to increase staff awareness of public relations, advertising, marketing or corporate image.

Other terms for industrial musicals include the corporate musical or industrial show, but the latter can also refer to trade shows, which are publicity events organized by businesses in a specific industry to promote their products to potential buyers.

Industrial musicals are not restricted to corporations or to businesses involved in industry. They should not be confused with industrial music or with musicals produced by businesses to be seen by the general public, such as Disney&#x27;s stage production of &quot;The Lion King&quot;, for example.

==History==
Industrial musicals originated from company songs, anthems and jingles for promoting enthusiasm among workers. The songs were brought in by the management, as opposed to worker-created work songs. Internal musical groups could be formed to encourage company loyalty, keep employees happy, and to help advertise the company to the public. Early 20th century examples include IBM&#x27;s internal songbook &quot;Songs of the IBM&quot;, and the Larkin Soap Company which organized community singing and had a women&#x27;s drum corps, an orchestra, a ukulele club, and daily recitals on a pipe organ.

At some point, a collection of company songs was extended into a full musical theater format, and the industrial musical was born. Many of these musicals were made in North America during the economic boom that followed World War II, and this practice continued into the 1980s and 1990s.

The earliest known industrial musicals were produced by retail and automotive companies such as Ford, General Motors, and the Marshall Field&#x27;s chain of department stores. By the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, other types of businesses also began to put on shows. Some musicals were part of annual showcase events for presenting a company&#x27;s new line of products.

Businesses could spend a lot of money to produce a musical, hiring talented Broadway composers and lyricists. The pay was very good, the task was challenging, and from the theatre&#x27;s point of view, the production costs were much higher than a regular Broadway musical. Shows could have as many as 30 people in the cast and a 60-piece orchestra. Composer Hank Beebe estimates that the 1957 Chevrolet musical was budgeted at over 3 million dollars (U.S.), because it cost six times the amount it took to bring &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; to the stage that same year.

The song performances were rarely heard outside of the companies they were written for, but sometimes the employees would be given a souvenir record album. Some productions lasted for a limited number of nights, while others traveled from city to city for regional sales meetings. According to composer John Kander, who conducted several industrial shows early in his career and wrote the music for the 1966 General Electric industrial &quot;Go Fly a Kite&quot; (the complete score from which was issued on a 2-LP set that was given to GE employees), the cast albums for these industrial shows &quot;were never intended for commercial release. [...] It was sort of a separate world.&quot; Yet it is largely through these rare albums that evidence of these shows has survived.

By the 1980s, industrial musicals were made less and less often. Jonathan Ward, a writer and DJ who collects industrial musical albums, theorizes that the reason for the decline was partially due to rising production costs for stage shows, and the availability of low-cost video and multimedia technology.

Ward thinks another reason for the decline was a change in work attitudes. In the 1950s and 1960s, employees might have expected to spend the majority of their working careers with one company. By the 1980s, employees and the management may have been less inclined to think this way. The feelings of company loyalty and community promoted in the song lyrics would have been met with more cynicism.

Some corporations, however, continued to successfully produce industrial musicals during the 1980s and 1990s and beyond. The Shaklee Corporation created its own in-house production company in 1980. Their team, led by producer Dale T. Hardin, director Craig Schaefer, and composer/lyricist Michael Reno created dozens of Shaklee Shows from concept to performance, and eventually branched out into in-house satellite TV. The Shaklee creative team created their own production company called &quot;Command Performance Productions&quot; that produced shows for other clients such as Charles Schwab and Marriott Lodging until 2000.

Despite the trends that affected industrial musicals, businesses have continued to make company songs. For example, KPMG produced a corporate anthem in 2001 titled &quot;Our Vision of Global Strategy.&quot;

In 2013, the first book on the history of industrial musicals, titled &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Profits&quot;, was published, written by Steve Young and Mike &quot;Sport&quot; Murphy. A series of industrial music audio anthologies, organized by decade, accompanied the book. In 2018, &quot;Bathtubs Over Broadway&quot;, a documentary on industrial musicals and Steve Young&#x27;s quest to discover their creators, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. The fourth episode of the fifth season of &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; involves the title character being cast in a fictional industrial musical about waste management.

<doc id="917567" wikidata="Q455066" url="?curid=917567" title="Amargosa Valley, Nevada">
<text>Amargosa Valley (formerly Lathrop Wells) is an unincorporated town located on U.S. Route 95 in Nye County, in the U.S. state of Nevada.

==Description==
The community is named after the Amargosa River which flows through the valley from its origination in Nevada to its terminus in Death Valley, California. Like most desert rivers, the long Amargosa flows on the surface only when rare rainfalls flood the desert washes, except for a segment near Shoshone, California, where the river flows perennially. The name Amargosa Valley is used locally with reference to the actual geographic valley, although for the most part, it is coincident with the Amargosa Desert and is noted as such on many maps.

The populated area of the Amargosa Valley is sandwiched between US 95 to the north and the California border to the south. Some of the residential streets in the community cross over into California. Much of the Nevada-California border in this area is contiguous with the boundaries of Death Valley National Park. The national park boundary extends into Nevada near Beatty, approximately northwest of Amargosa Valley. Amargosa Valley is located approximately northwest of Las Vegas, northwest of Pahrump, and north of Death Valley Junction, California.

==History==
The Tonopah and Tidewater Railroad ran through the valley from 1906 to 1940, for borax mining operations. Modern development did not begin until the early 1950s. Electric power, other than that produced by private generators, was not available until 1963. Until the early 1990s growth in Amargosa Valley was minimal. More recently, intense growth in Las Vegas has led many new residents to settle in Amargosa Valley and nearby Pahrump.

==Geography==
Amargosa Valley is located at 36.58001 North, 116.44487 West at an elevation of 2,640 feet (805 m) above sea level. The landscape is typical of lower to moderate elevations in the Mojave Desert, with flat expanses of sandy soil punctuated by rocky mounds and hills. Predominant indigenous vegetation is White Bursage and Creosote Bush, with some Joshua Trees and Cacti at higher elevations. Numerous non-native plant species have also been introduced.

==Demographics==
==Recreation==
Alien Cathouse is one of Nevada&#x27;s legal brothels. It is located near the corner of U.S. 95 and SR 373. Longstreet Hotel, Casino, and RV Resort is a full-service hotel and casino with restaurants and a RV park. The hotel is located on SR 373, near the Nevada–California border. The hotel is popular with visitors to nearby Death Valley National Park. Big Dunes, popular for weekenders from all over Southern Nevada, is located on the north side of Amargosa Valley. Ash Meadows Wildlife Refuge is located in the southern end of Amargosa Valley.

<text>The Amargosa Valley is the valley through which the Amargosa River flows south, in Nye County, southwestern Nevada and Inyo County in the state of California. The south end is alternately called the &quot;Amargosa River Valley&#x27;&quot; or the &quot;Tecopa Valley.&quot; Its northernmost point is around Beatty, Nevada and southernmost is Tecopa, California, where the Amargosa River enters into the Amargosa Canyon.

==Geography==
The Amargosa Valley (&quot;the Valley&quot;) is located within the Basin and Range Province (&quot;the Province&quot;) which is characterized by abrupt changes in elevation, alternating between narrow faulted mountain chains and flat arid valleys or basins. As is typical of the Province, the Valley is long from north to south and narrow from east to west. It lies to the east of Death Valley, separated from it by the Amargosa Range and Funeral Mountains.

The Valley lies within the Mohave Desert region of the Province. The more narrowly bounded Amargosa Desert forms the eastern portion of the Valley.

==History==

===Prehistory===

It is not known when the first humans settled in the Amargosa Desert. Ancient campsites have been found that date back at least 10,000 years, to the end of the last ice age. Recent examination of archaeological remains in the valley implies more extensive use by aboriginal peoples than had been previously estimated. Pottery and other artifacts have been found that date back from approximately 1000 A.D. to even earlier times. During the nineteenth century, two groups of Native Americans occupied the Amargosa Valley: the Southern Paiute and the Western Shoshone. Both were extremely adept at extracting a living from their marginal environment, subsisting on wild plant foods and supplemented by wild game.

===European exploration===
The Old Spanish Trail and the later wagon road called the Old Mormon Road or Salt Lake Road, ran through the south end of Amargosa Valley, passing from Resting Springs, east of present-day Tecopa, 7 miles to Willow Spring on the east bank of the canyon of the Amargosa River (then called Saleratus Creek), below Tecopa and above the mouth of China Ranch Wash.

After the Donner Party&#x27;s disastrous winter of 1847 in the Sierra Nevada mountains, which happened just before the news of California gold became public, a loose group arrived in October 1849 at the Great Salt Lake. They organized under the guidance of a Captain Hunt to head for the San Bernardino–Los Angeles area. The best alternative to risking the Donner route was to try an end run to the south of the Sierras. The Old Spanish Trail had long been used by Indians, traders, explorers, and mountain men as a convenient but rough route, confined to horseback and pack animals, to California. It ran north from Santa Fe to the Salt Lake area then back south along the edge of the mountains to San Diego, and had been used ever since the days of Cabeza De Vaca&#x27;s journey through the country.

Leaving the Salt Lake area, they were overtaken by another party led by a guide named Captain Smith. He assured them that a more direct route across the southern deserts existed which was quite passable for wagons and showed them a copy of John C. Fremont&#x27;s map of his explorations. The map had a large portion, then known as &quot;The Great American Desert&quot;, left blank with the word &quot;unexplored&quot; across it. On this Smith&#x27;s friend Barney Ward had drawn in a trail which showed plenty of graze for the animals, and adequate water for all with a description of the clear cool waters of Owens river and Lake Owens. The route would take them north and west of the then unknown Death Valley. Then, over Walker&#x27;s Pass into California. Unfortunately, this map showed a fictitious mountain range, north of the Old Spanish Trail to Los Angeles and running roughly east–west across central Nevada, and it may have been this non-existent mountain range that contributed to the emigrant&#x27;s decision to chance leaving the established trail, under the assumption that water, and grass for the oxen, would be easier to locate along the base of the mountains. In later times, the exploration and mapping of Nevada would show that all of the mountain ranges in central Nevada run north–south, directly across the path the Bennett-Arcane Party took.

The party was led by William L. Manly, Rev. James Brier, and Asahel Bennett, all experienced outdoorsmen and farmers out of the Wisconsin farm country who decided to risk it on the assurances that Smith, with the map, would accompany them. Hunt objected, but agreed to stay on as long as he was needed. Soon after their leaving Salt Lake, Smith&#x27;s group split off as did their guide Hunt as the country got really rough for wagon passage with the main group of less adventurous emigrants and the map. Smith and Hunt both arrived with their parties in San Bernardino after tough but quick journeys around Death Valley. Manly, Brier, and Bennett led straight on into the Amargosa desert. They were followed by another small group, the Wade family party who stayed back one day. Not having to scout or break trail, the Wades had an easy journey compared to the others.

After leaving Ash Meadows, they drove over the Amargosa range, and down into Death Valley through Furnace Creek Wash where they were quickly bogged down on the valley floor. Many of their oxen had died from lack of forage and they were immobilized, as the few remaining animals were starving and were too weak to pull wagons up and over the mountains to the west and south, even if a pass were found. The Wades, not so bad off, quickly turned south and drove themselves out of the valley and on to safety, probably via Wingate Wash. The Manley, Brier, &amp; Bennett party sent Manley and a companion, John Haney Rogers, south out of the valley for help. The Briers made a heroic climb over the Panamints to safety, while the Bennetts waited huddled around their wagons with water but no food. Four weeks later, after an incredible 500 mile round-trip trek across the Mojave Desert to Rancho San Francisco (approx. 30 miles north of Los Angeles), Manly &amp; Rogers returned with some food supplies and a single mule (three other horses had died on the return trip), and the Bennett and Arcane families walked and rode their remaining oxen out of what they named, &quot;Death Valley&quot;.

There appears to have been only one death among the &#x27;49er emigrants within Death Valley itself, a Capt. Culverwell. Two weeks before the return of Manly and Rogers, a small group had attempted to walk out to the southwest, and Capt. Culverwell, a middle-aged man, was unable to keep up with the younger, stronger men and had turned back to re-join the Bennett/Arcane party. He never made it, and succumbed to dehydration. His body was found by Manly &amp; Rogers only a couple of miles short of the Bennett camp on their return trek from Rancho San Francisco. Two members of another group of emigrants, the Jayhawkers, who had been traveling with the Bennett/Arcane Party, died along the trail west of the Panamint Range; their names are given in Manly&#x27;s journal as Mr. Fish and Mr. Isham.

While the main motivation of the emigrants was to join the California gold rush, the 1849 rush wasn&#x27;t nearly as profitable as the later silver rush of the Comstock Lode in Nevada.

==Modern development==
Amargosa Valley is near the controversial Yucca Mountain Repository, a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) facility on federal land, designed for the storage of high-level nuclear waste. President George W. Bush signed House Joint Resolution 87 on July 23, 2002, authorizing the DOE to proceed with construction at Yucca Mountain, although the facility was not expected to accept its first shipments of radioactive materials before 2012. The facility&#x27;s main entrance will be in Amargosa Valley, approximately 14 miles (23 km) south of the storage tunnels. In 2009 President Barack Obama stated that the repository was no longer being considered as a site for the long-term storage of nuclear waste.

Controversy over water rights resulted in 2009 when Solar Millennium, a German company, announced plans to build a solar thermal energy plant in the Amargosa Valley. It would require 20% of the groundwater available in the valley&#x27;s aquifer. Amargosa Farm Road Solar Project was a proposed 500 megawatt (MW) solar power plant in Nye County, Nevada at 36° 34&#x27; 31.52&quot;N, -116° 29&#x27; 35.52&quot;W. Originally designed as a concentrating solar power (CSP) project, the project was converted to photovoltaic (PV) technology. Solar Millennium went bankrupt and the project stalled.

A smaller 65MW PV plant on private land was proposed by First Solar in 2013.

==Climate== 
Amargosa Valley has a mild desert climate with very hot summer days and mild winters. The hottest recorded temperature in Amargosa Valley is 118 °F (47.7 °C) on July 9, 2002 and the coldest temperature was 6 °F (-14.4 °C) on December 22, 1990. Average yearly precipitation is 4.29 inches.

==Transportation==
The principal highways serving Amargosa Valley are U.S. Route 95 which runs north–south (NE-SW as it passes through Amargosa) connecting Las Vegas and Reno, and State Route 373, which runs north–south connecting Amargosa Valley to Death Valley Junction via California State Route 127.

==Recreation==

Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge features approximately 23,000 acres (93 km2) of spring-fed wetlands and is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge provides habitat for at least 24 plants and animals found nowhere else in the world. Four fish (Devil&#x27;s Hole Pupfish, Amargosa Pupfish, Warm Springs Pupfish, and Ash Meadows Speckled Dace), one insect (Ash Meadows Naucorid), and one plant (Amargosa Niterwort) are currently listed as endangered species. Ash Meadows NWR can be accessed via SR 373 in Amargosa Valley, SR 160 near Crystal, Nevada or from Bell Vista Road west of Pahrump. Entrances to the refuge are marked with road signs.

Big Dune is a formation of sand dunes, cresting approximately above surrounding terrain. The dune formation and surrounding land is administered by the BLM and is open to motorized and non-motorized recreational uses. Big Dune is accessible from Valley View Road, approximately south of U.S. 95.

Tecopa Hot Springs offer several opportunities to soak in private baths fed by the natural hot springs.

<text>Vincent &quot;Ċensu&quot; Tabone, (; 30 March 1913 – 14 March 2012) was the fourth president of Malta who also served as Minister and Nationalist MP.

==Early years==
Vincent Tabone was the son of Niccolò and Elisa Tabone, the youngest of ten children. His paternal grandmother, Giuseppina De Gaetani, had settled in Valletta in the mid-19th century from Riposto, Sicily. His father, Niccolò, was one of the first Maltese doctors to read pathology and surgery in the United Kingdom, and served as a District Medical Officer in various parts of Gozo. Life on Gozo for the Tabone family was relatively quiet and pastoral. They lived in Victoria and spent their summers in Marsalforn. 

Tabone&#x27;s childhood was deeply affected by the sudden death of his father in 1922 at the age of 59. Two years later, at the age of 11, he was shipped off to Malta, where he became a boarder at St. Aloysius College, a Jesuit school. He entered the University of Malta in 1930, where he graduated as a pharmacist in 1933 and as a Doctor of Medicine in 1937.

==Military service and medical career==
During World War II, he served as a Regimental Medical Officer and general duty officer with the Royal Malta Artillery, and later as trainee ophthalmic specialist stationed at the Military Hospital, Mtarfa. In the early days of the War, he narrowly escaped tragedy when a bomb fell at Fort Saint Elmo, demolishing a substantial part of the army barracks to which he had been posted. In 1946, he obtained a diploma in Ophthalmology from the University of Oxford, followed by a diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery from the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He was a clinical assistant at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.

In 1948, Tabone was entrusted with the supervision of a campaign to treat trachoma using sulfonamide tablets and drops. Through his efforts, the disease was virtually eliminated from the Island of Gozo. He helped launch similar campaigns in Taiwan, Indonesia and Iraq under the auspices of the World Health Organization, and subsequently served as a member and consultant of the WHO&#x27;s International Panel of Trachoma Experts. 

He served on the Council of the University of Malta, and between 1957 and 1960 he was a faculty member of the Board of Medicine, and a lecturer in Clinical Ophthalmology in the Department of Surgery. He helped found the Medical Association of Malta in 1954 and was for a time its Honorary President. For many years, even as he served as a Member of Parliament, he maintained his medical practice in Sliema.

==Political career==
Tabone was elected to the executive committee of the Nationalist Party in 1961. He later served as the party&#x27;s Secretary-General (1962–1972) and as Deputy Leader (1972–1977). Tabone was first elected to Parliament in 1966 and subsequently served as a Member of Parliament for the Sliema, St. Julian&#x27;s, Msida, and Gżira areas for 23 years. During this time, he also served as the Minister of Labour, Employment and Welfare (1966–1971) and Minister for Foreign Affairs (1987–1989). In 1968, Tabone brought a motion before the United Nations calling for an action plan in regard to the world&#x27;s ageing population. In 1988, he brought another motion before the UN, calling for the world&#x27;s climate to be declared the common heritage of mankind. 

==Death==
On 14 March 2012, Tabone died at his home in St. Julian&#x27;s, Malta at age 98. He died 16 days shy of his 99th birthday.

==Personal life==
On 23 November 1941, Tabone married Maria Wirth (9 February 1920 – 19 July 2018).
He was survived by his wife, eight children, 19 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren. Ċensu and Maria Tabone had celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary not long before his death.

==Honours==

===National honours===
* Malta: Companion of Honour of the National Order of Merit (1990) &quot;by right as a President of Malta&quot;

===Foreign honours===
* Germany: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany

<text>Lorado Zadok Taft (April 29, 1860 – October 30, 1936) was an American sculptor, writer and educator. Part of the American Renaissance movement, his monumental pieces include, &quot;Fountain of Time&quot;, &quot;Spirit of the Great Lakes&quot;, and &quot;The Eternal Indian&quot;. His 1903 book, &quot;The History of American Sculpture,&quot; was the first survey of the subject and stood for decades as the standard reference. With what were seen as progressive views on the subject, he has been credited with helping to advance the status of women as sculptors.

Taft was the father of U.S. Representative Emily Taft Douglas, father-in-law to her husband, U.S. Senator Paul Douglas, and a distant relative of U.S. President William Howard Taft.

==Early years and education==

Taft was born in Elmwood, Illinois. His parents were Don Carlos Taft and Mary Lucy Foster. His father was a professor of geology at the Illinois Industrial University (later renamed the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign). He lived much of his childhood at 601 E. John Street, Champaign, Illinois, near the center of the UIUC campus. The house, now known as the Taft House, was built by his father in 1873. It was purchased by the university in 1949 and moved about one mile southeast. After being homeschooled by his parents, Taft earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree (1879) and master&#x27;s degree (1880) at Illinois Industrial University.

After his master&#x27;s degree, he left for Paris to study sculpture, attending the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts from 1880 to 1883, where he studied with Augustin Dumont, Jean-Marie Bonnassieux, and Gabriel Thomas. His record there was outstanding; he was cited as &quot;top man&quot; in his studio and twice exhibited at the Salon.

==Career==
===Sculptor and educator===
Upon returning to the United States in 1886, Taft settled in Chicago. He taught at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago until 1929. In addition to work in clay and plaster, Taft taught his students marble carving, and had them work on group projects. He also lectured at the University of Chicago and the University of Illinois.
In 1892, while the art community of Chicago was preparing for the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition of 1893, chief architect Daniel Burnham expressed concern to Taft that the sculptural adornments to the buildings might not be finished on time. Taft asked if he could employ some of his female students as assistants (it was not socially accepted for women to work as sculptors at that time) for the Horticultural Building. Burnham responded, &quot;Hire anyone, even white rabbits, if they&#x27;ll do the work.&quot; From that arose a group of talented women sculptors known as &quot;the White Rabbits&quot;, which included Enid Yandell, Carol Brooks MacNeil, Bessie Potter Vonnoh, Janet Scudder, Julia Bracken, and Ellen Rankin Copp.

Later, another former student, Frances Loring, noted that Taft used his students&#x27; talents to further his own career, a not-uncommon situation. In general, history has given Taft credit for helping to advance the status of women as sculptors.

At a meeting in St. Paul, Minnesota to decide which artist submission to select for a monument of Col. William Colvill to go in the Minnesota State Capitol rotunda, the state art commission asked the opinion of Taft who was in the city at the time. While he did not recommend any of the models, he thought the model by Catherine Backus had points in its favor. Originally the commission favored the model by John K. Daniels but it was voted down. They then selected Backus&#x27; model to execute in a nine foot full-size bronze.

===Lectures and writings===
As Taft grew older, his eloquence and compelling writing led him, along with Frederick Ruckstull, to the forefront of sculpture&#x27;s conservative ranks, where he often served as a spokesperson against the modern and abstract trends that developed during his lifetime. Taft&#x27;s frequent lecture tours for the Chautauqua gave him a broad, popular celebrity status.
In some settings, Taft is better known for his writings than for his sculpture. In 1903, Taft published &quot;The History of American Sculpture&quot;, the first survey of the subject. The revised 1925 version was to remain the standard reference on the subject until the art historian E. Wayne Craven published &quot;Sculpture in America&quot; in 1968. In 1921, Taft published &quot;Modern Tendencies in Sculpture&quot;, a compilation of his lectures given at the Art Institute of Chicago. At the time, it offered a distinct perspective on the development of European sculpture; today, the book continues to be regarded as an excellent survey of American sculpture in the early years of the 20th century.

===Associations===
In 1898, Taft was a founding member of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest Art Colony, which is currently a field and research campus for Northern Illinois University in Oregon, Illinois. Taft designed the Columbus Fountain at Washington Union Station in Washington, D.C., in collaboration with Daniel Burnham. Taft was a member of the National Academy of Design, the National Institute of Arts and Letters, and the American Academy of Arts and Letters; he headed the National Sculpture Society in the 1920s, exhibiting at both their 1923 and 1929 shows, and he served on the Board of Art Advisors of Illinois. He served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1925 to 1929, and was an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects. His papers reside in collections at the Smithsonian Archives of American Art, the University of Illinois, and the Art Institute of Chicago.

He maintained his connections with his throughout his life. (His association with the University is commemorated by a street named in his honor.) In 1929, he dedicated his sculpture &quot;Alma Mater&quot; on the University of Illinois campus. Taft envisioned his &quot;Alma Mater&quot; as a benign and magnificent woman, about high and dressed in classical draperies, rising from a throne and advancing a step forward with outstretched arms in a gesture of generous greeting to her children. Two figures behind her on either side represent the university&#x27;s motto, Learning and Labor.

===Final years===
He received numerous awards, prizes, and honorary degrees.

Taft was active until the end of his life. The week before he died, he attended the Quincy, Illinois, dedication ceremonies for his sculpture celebrating the Lincoln–Douglas debates. He died in his home studio in Chicago on October 30, 1936. He was cremated, and his ashes were scattered at Elmwood Cemetery near Bloomington, Illinois.

==Sculptor&#x27;s body of work==
Taft may be best remembered for his various fountains.

The University of Illinois Archives has a series of photographs of most of Taft&#x27;s important works, including many of their construction and preliminary models.
Following more than a dozen years of work, Taft&#x27;s &quot;Fountain of Time&quot; was unveiled at the west end of Chicago&#x27;s Midway Plaisance in 1922. Based on poet Austin Dobson&#x27;s lines—&quot;Time goes, you say? Ah no, Alas, time stays, we go.&quot; The fountain shows a cloaked figure of time observing the stream of humanity flowing past.
The last major commission that Taft completed was two groups for the front entrance to the Louisiana State Capitol Building, dedicated in 1932.

He left unfinished a vast work to be called the &quot;Fountain of Creation&quot; which he planned to place at the opposite end of the Chicago Midway to the &quot;Fountain of Time&quot;. Parts of this work were donated to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and are now at the library and Foellinger Auditorium. The University named a dormitory and a street in Taft&#x27;s honor.

In 1965, his Chicago workplace at 6016 S. Ingleside Avenue (he moved there in 1906, when the building consisted merely of a brick barn) was designated a National Historic Landmark as Lorado Taft Midway Studios.

<text>Thomas Taggart (November 17, 1856 – March 6, 1929) was an Irish-American politician who was the political boss of the Democratic Party in Indiana for the first quarter of the twentieth century and remained an influential political figure in local, state, and national politics until his death. Taggart was elected auditor of Marion County, Indiana (1886–1894), and mayor of Indianapolis (1895 to 1901). His mayoral administration supported public improvements, most notably the formation of the city&#x27;s park and boulevard system. He also served as a member of the Democratic National Committee (1900–1916) and as its chairman (1904–1908). Taggart was appointed to the U.S. Senate in March 1916, but lost the seat in the November election.

Taggart, an Irish-born immigrant, came to the United States in 1861 at the age of five, grew up in Xenia, Ohio, and moved to Indiana as a teenager. After relocating to Indianapolis in 1877, he began a successful career as an hotelier, financier, and politician. As the party&#x27;s county chairman during Grover Cleveland&#x27;s 1888 presidential campaign, Taggart helped him carry Marion County over Republican Benjamin Harrison, the hometown candidate. As state chairman in 1892, Taggart helped Cleveland carry Indiana in opposition to Harrison&#x27;s bid for reelection. In 1908 Taggart assisted in securing the Democratic nomination of John W. Kern for U.S. vice president and Thomas R. Marshall for governor of Indiana. He was also involved in securing the nomination of Woodrow Wilson for U.S. president and Marshall for vice president in 1912, as well as James M. Cox&#x27;s nomination in the 1920 presidential election. In addition to his political activities, Taggart was the owner and developer of the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana; he also maintained a summer home at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts.

==Early life and family==
Thomas Taggart was born on November 17, 1856, to Thomas and Martha Kingsbury Taggart in Emyvale, County Monaghan, Ireland], and immigrated with his family to the United States in 1861 at the age of five. The Taggarts settled in Xenia, Ohio, where Thomas senior worked at a local railroad depot. Young Taggart left high school early to work full-time at the depot&#x27;s hotel and restaurant. In 1875, when young Thomas was 18, his employer, the N. and G. Ohmer Company, sent him to Garrett, Indiana, to work in the restaurant at DeKalb House, a depot hotel. Thomas remained at Garrett until 1877, when he was transferred to Indianapolis, Indiana, to work as a clerk for the Ohmer company&#x27;s dining hall/restaurant at the city&#x27;s Union Depot. Known as a hard worker, Taggart became the depot restaurant&#x27;s manager and eventually its sole owner in the new Union Station.

In 1878, a year after his move to Indianapolis, Taggart married Eva Dora Bryant, whom he met while living in Garrett. Thomas and his wife were the parents of six children, five daughters and one son. Florence Eva (1878–1899) died tragically in a yachting accident in the Gulf of Mexico; Lucy Martha (1880–1960) became an accomplished artist and art educator at the John Herron Art Institute in Indianapolis; Nora (born 1881), a Vassar College graduate, married David L. Chambers, who became president and chairman of the Bobbs-Merrill Company; Irene Mary (born 1883) married a physician from Louisville, Kentucky; Emily Letitia (born 1888) married William R. Sinclair, an executive with Kingan and Company, an Indianapolis-based meatpacker; and Thomas Douglas (born 1886) graduated from Yale University and in 1912 assumed management of the French Lick Springs Hotel. Thomas and Eva Taggart also had nine grandchildren.

The Taggart family&#x27;s primary residence was in Indianapolis, where they built a new home at 1331 North Delaware Street in 1913. The large home included a Georgian Colonial exterior and an Italian-style interior. It was selected as one of &quot;House Beautiful&#x27;s&quot; three best homes in Indianapolis in 1920. The Taggarts were members of Saint Paul Episcopal Church in Indianapolis.

In 1901, after Taggart and a group of investors purchased the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana, the Taggart family frequently visited the hotel. Its seven-story deluxe wing, completed in 1915, provided accommodations for the family when they were in residence.

The family also had a summer home built in 1915–16 at Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. The home was called Amyvale, in honor of Taggart&#x27;s Irish birthplace. In 1928 Joseph P. and Rose Kennedy acquired property adjacent to the Taggarts&#x27; Hyannis Port home to establish the Kennedy compound. The Taggarts&#x27; Hyannis Port home was sold after Eva&#x27;s death, in 1937.

==Career==
After his move to Indianapolis in 1877, Taggart began a successful career as an Indiana hotelier, financier, and politician. Taggart became the owner of the restaurant at the Indianapolis Union Station, but sold his restaurant business and began other ventures that included acquisition of two hotels in Indianapolis and the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana, among other investments. Taggart also became a &quot;powerful Democratic boss of the state,&quot; often referred to by his initials, T. T., or called &quot;the Easy Boss&quot; because of his congenial nature.

Taggart was elected auditor of Marion County, Indiana (1886–1894) and mayor of Indianapolis (1895–1901). As the Democratic Party&#x27;s boss in Indiana, a member of Democratic National Committee (1900–1916), and the party&#x27;s national chairman (1904–1908), Taggart also became an influential political figure in state and national politics. In 1916 Taggart was appointed U.S. Senator, but he was defeated later that year in a special election.

===Hotelier===
After Taggart sold his restaurant business at the Indianapolis Union Station, his investments expanded to include controlling interests in the Grand and Denison hotels in Indianapolis and investments in the copper, gas, and oil industries.

In 1901 Taggart began his most ambitious and famous project when he organized a small group of investors that acquired and developed the French Lick Springs Hotel in Orange County, Indiana. In addition to Taggart, the group included William McDoel, president of the Monon Railroad; Crawford Fairbanks, a Terre Haute brewery owner; and Colonel Livingston T. Dickson, owner of &quot;quarry and mineral interests in Indiana and Illinois.&quot;

Around 1905 Taggart bought his partners&#x27; interests in the mineral springs hotel to become its sole owner. Under Taggart&#x27;s direction, the property was transformed into a first-class spa and a renowned gambling resort. Taggart made improvements and additions to the hotel, its mineral springs, and the resort&#x27;s grounds. He also modernized the facilities, established trolley service to French Lick, and convinced the Monon Railroad to lay a spur track to the hotel&#x27;s grounds and run daily passenger service to Chicago. At the height of the resort&#x27;s popularity in the early decades of the 20th century, the hotel provided more than $2 million in annual profits.

Although casino gambling was illegal under Indiana law, it flourished in the Orange County area from the early 1900s until the mid-1940s, during the time the Taggart family managed the French Lick Springs Hotel, and contributed to the resort&#x27;s popularity. Several casinos were in operation within Orange County, but Taggart disassociated himself with any connection to these local gambling establishments and denied any involvement in illegal gambling operations.

===Politician===
Taggart, who was a Democrat, became active in local politics in Indianapolis in the 1880s. He was elected auditor of heavily Republican Marion County in 1886, reelected in 1890, and served in that capacity until 1894. During that time Taggart also served as the Democratic Party chairman at the city, county, and state levels. As the county chairman during the presidential campaign of 1888, his efforts helped Grover Cleveland carry Marion County over native son Benjamin Harrison, the first time the county had voted Democratic in a Presidential election. As state chairman in 1892, Taggart helped Cleveland carry Indiana to challenge Harrison&#x27;s bid for reelection.

From 1895 to 1901, Taggart served three two-year terms as the mayor of Indianapolis. He defeated Republican Preston C. Trusler in 1895, William M. Harding in 1897 and Charles A. Bookwalter in 1899. During his mayoralty, Taggart&#x27;s administration emphasized efficient use of the city&#x27;s funds and civic improvements that included acquisition of more than along the White River to establish the city&#x27;s park and boulevard system. Although the city&#x27;s then-growing African American population generally supported Republicans until the New Deal, Indianapolis lawyers Alexander E. Manning (who became president of the National League of Negro Democrats in 1896) and James T.V. Hill were Taggart&#x27;s liaisons with their community, which helped elect and re-elect Taggart.

Taggart remained active in national and state politics until his death in 1929. He served on the Democratic National Committee from 1900 to 1916 and as its chairman from 1904 to 1908. As the party&#x27;s national chairman, Taggart ran Judge Alton B. Parker&#x27;s campaign in the presidential election in 1904, but Parker lost to Theodore Roosevelt. Taggart played a key role in securing John W. Kern&#x27;s Democratic nomination for U.S. vice president and Thomas R. Marshall&#x27;s nomination for governor of Indiana in 1908, as well as Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s nomination for U.S. president and Marshall&#x27;s vice presidential nomination in 1912 at the Democratic National Convention in Baltimore, Maryland.

On March 20, 1916, Indiana governor Samuel M. Ralston appointed Taggart, his political ally, to the U.S. Senate to fill a seat left vacant by the death of Benjamin F. Shively. Taggart advocated efficient use of federal funds and opposed wasteful spending, although his time in the Senate was brief. That November proved a Republican sweep and Taggart lost the Senate seat to James E. Watson. In 1920 Taggart helped James M. Cox win the Democratic nomination in the presidential election. Cox reciprocated by supporting Taggart&#x27;s challenge to regain the Senate seat from Watson, but again Republicans swept in the November general election: Warren G. Harding defeated Cox and Taggart lost to Watson.

In 1924 Taggart had nearly secured Samuel Ralston&#x27;s nomination as the Democratic candidate in the presidential election before Ralston withdrew from the race for health reasons. In Indiana&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign that year, Taggart endorsed Carleton B. McCulloch, but McCulloch lost the election to Edward L. Jackson, who enjoyed strong Ku Klux Klan support and carried all but two of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties.

==Later years==
Taggart&#x27;s health declined in the 1920s, but he remained active in national and state politics and civil affairs until his death in Indianapolis in 1929. He served as chairman of the board of directors of American Fletcher National Bank (1925–1929); as a director of the Indianapolis, Light, Heat, and Power Company; and treasurer of the Indiana Lincoln Union. He was also a member of the George Rogers Clark Memorial Commission.

==Death and legacy==
Taggart died on March 6, 1929. After a brief funeral service in the dining room of his North Delaware Street home in Indianapolis, he was buried at Crown Hill Cemetery. His gravesite is near those of his wife, Eva, and four of their children (Florence, Lucy, Irene, and Thomas). The Taggart family burial plot is in Section Three of the cemetery and marked with a tall, gray obelisk. Following his death in 1929, Taggart&#x27;s son, Thomas Douglas, became owner of the French Lick Springs Hotel property and buildings valued at nearly $2 million.

Taggart is considered the &quot;undisputed boss of the Democratic machine for the first quarter of the twentieth century&quot; and &quot;one of Indiana’s most dominant political figures.&quot; He is also remembered for his support of public improvements as mayor of Indianapolis, most notably the formation of city&#x27;s public park and boulevard system. Taggart&#x27;s efforts in this area made him &quot;a leader in the movement to conserve urban natural resources for public use.&quot;

<doc id="917586" wikidata="Q2858194" url="?curid=917586" title="Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998">
<text>The New Japan–Republic of Korea Partnership towards the Twenty-first Century (Japanese: 日韓共同宣言 – 21世紀に向けた新たな日韓パートナーシップ, ) was a declaration made on October 8, 1998, between Japanese Prime Minister Keizō Obuchi and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung to reconfirm friendly relations between Japan and South Korea, as well as declare that both countries will discuss the future of Japan-South Korea relations in order to build a new Japan–South Korea partnership. This declaration is also called the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998.

== Background ==
=== Immediate background ===
In February 1998, when Kim Dae-jung became the president of South Korea, Japan-South Korea relations were at its worst. With both countries unable to come to an agreement about issues such as the Dokdo/Takeshima, comfort women, and fishing, relations between the two countries continued to worsen. Kim Dae-jung, unlike the former president Kim Young-Sam, who was very critical about the Japanese government, actively sought to have talks with Japan and set about preparing the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998 along with Japan.

=== Historical background ===
An existing treaty between South Korea and Japan, the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea, was signed on June 22, 1965, and provided basic diplomatic relations for the two states. In this treaty, signed by Japanese PM Eisaku Satō and the South Korean dictator Park Chung Hee, Japan and South Korea agreed upon settling problems with property during war-time, individual claims for compensation, and economic cooperation. Japan provided South Korea with $800 million, which would settle any issues about Imperial-era property and compensation for individuals.

On July 6, 1992, Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Kato made an apology towards South Korea and to the wartime comfort women. Kato touched upon the remorse that Japan feels, along with hopes to build “future-oriented” relations with South Korea. The &quot;Murayama Statement&quot;, also called &quot;On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the war&#x27;s end&quot;, was a statement released on August 16, 1995, by Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama. This statement was mainly an apology regarding the damages that Japan caused to its neighboring countries during World War II. Similarly, on June 23, 1996, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto apologized about comfort women and announced that he and President Kim Young-sam had agreed that friendly relations between Japan and South Korea was ideal for not just in Asia, but also globally.

== Details of the Agreement ==

Source:

== Outcomes ==

=== South Korea seeks destruction of Declaration in 2001 ===
On July 18, 2001, the National Assembly of the Republic of Korea made a resolution unanimously seeking the destruction of the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998. This resolution was the result of anti-Japanese emotions that were caused by then-Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visiting Yasukuni Shrine, along with Japanese history textbooks omitting details about facts related to issues such as Imperial Japanese war crimes and comfort women in the same year. When no action was taken by Japan to “correct” their textbooks, South Korea temporarily halted allowing Japanese cultural capital from coming into the country, which has been happening over five steps since the 1998 Joint Declaration. However, this did not result in the destruction of the 1998 Joint Declaration, after talks between then-President Roh Moo Hyun and then-Prime Minister Koizumi. The 4th step of allowing Japanese cultural imports into South Korea, which was temporarily stopped on July 12, 2001, resumed on January 1, 2004.

=== Commemoration ===
On October 9, 2018, the Commemorative Symposium for the 20th Anniversary of the Japan-South Korea Joint Declaration was held in Tokyo. This symposium was a way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Japan and South Korea signing the Joint Declaration in 1998, and effectively also an opportunity for Prime Minister Abe to talk about current Japan-South Korea relations. Abe emphasizes that the efforts from people like the past-Prime Minister Obuchi and past-President Kim Dae-jung have allowed the two countries to overcome obstacles regarding Japan-South Korea relations. Throughout his speech, Abe continuously uses the phrase “future-oriented”, emphasizing his enthusiasm towards improving relations between the two countries.

== Stances on History ==

=== Japan ===

The Japanese government&#x27;s recognition towards historical issues such as the comfort women issue, war-time laborer issue, has been acknowledged in the “Murayama Statement” which was released on August 15, 1995, to apologize for the Japanese acts conducted in the Asia-Pacific region during the World War II. The following prime ministers has issued similar statements, including the “Koizumi Statement” on August 15, 2005, and “Abe Statement” made on August 14, 2015. In the Japan–South Korea Joint Declaration of 1998, Prime Minister Obuchi made his feelings of remorse and apology clear, as to all the damage and suffering that had been done during Japan&#x27;s colonial rule.

In terms of the comfort women issue, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have mentioned the following:

The government recognizes and apologizes to all those women known as comfort women who suffered immeasurable pain and incurable physical and psychological wounds.

The government of Japan has legally settled all issues of reparations, properties and claims arising from the war, and has extended maximum cooperation to the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund which implemented “medical and welfare support projects” and provided “atonement money” to offer realistic relief to comfort women who are now advanced in years (the Asian Women&#x27;s Fund has been disbanded in March 2007).

The Abe Statement made on August 14, 2015, states that “we must never forget that there were women behind the battlefields whose honor and dignity were severely injured. It is also stated that we will engrave in our hearts the past, when the dignity and honor of many women were severely injured during wars in the 20th century, and Japan will lead the world in making the 21st century an era in which women’s human rights are not infringed upon.

Japan and South Korea reached an agreement on December 28, 2015 in Seoul where the two Foreign Ministers reached an agreement regarding the issue of comfort women and confirmed that the issue is resolved “finally and irreversibly”.

=== Republic of Korea ===
In the Joint Declaration, President Kim expressed his feelings of appreciation for PM Obuchi&#x27;s attitude. He also suggested to build a future-oriented relationship, and to move forward with the historical issue.

However, the current South Korean government has been skeptical of the Japanese government&#x27;s attitude towards the historical issues which had occurred in World War II, as not to scar relations. especially regarding the comfort women issue and the war-time laborers issue.

ROK President Moon Jae-in has criticized the bilateral agreement of 2015 which was signed between Japan and South Korea and has brought it upon the Republic of Korea&#x27;s Constitutional Court on the validity of this diplomatic agreement. However, on December 27, 2019, the Republic of Korea Constitutional Court declined to rule on the validity of the 2015 agreement made between the two nations, and has concluded that the agreement does not infringe upon the constitution of either countries.

== Issues raised by the Agreement ==
During the meeting that concluded in the Joint Declaration between Japan and South Korea in 1998, an apology addressing past transgressions on the Japanese side was issued from PM Obuchi Keizo to ROK President Kim Dae-jung.

=== Perspectives on Historical Issues ===
Overall, the declaration does not mention in detail the exact stances on major historical issues; it fails to mention any specific historical wrongdoings and clarify stances on historical events. At the time, PM Obuchi faced difficulties in producing a clear narrative on the historical issues with ROK due to inconsistency within the Japanese government and the leading political party LDP. PM Obuchi therefore made use of the previous statement issued by Murayama Tomiichi in 1995, also known as the Murayama Statement, which was the first ever apology issued by a Japanese prime minister that specifically mentions the words ‘colonial rule’, and President Kim Dae-jung was thus inclined to accept and move on.

=== Textbook Issue ===
Another point with the declaration that has been raised is the lack of enforcement and apparent emergence of the textbook issue. In the second section that outlines the agreements made between Japan and ROK in 1998, it is written that “both leaders shared the view that it was important that the peoples both countries, the young generation in particular, deepen their understanding of history, and stressed the need to devote much attention and effort to that end”. Although Japanese textbooks covered the comfort women issue during the 1990s, it is reported that they no longer contain information on the issue, which may contribute further to the current issues between ROK and Japan.

== Relation to 1998 Jiang Zemin State visit in Tokyo ==
On November 25, 1998, general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (1989–2002) and China&#x27;s president (1993–2003) Jiang Zemin and his wife made a state visit to Japan that lasted for five days. President Jiang Zemin and his wife spent three days in Tokyo, from which they traveled north to visit Sendai and Sapporo before departing from Sapporo on November 30.

During this state visit, the Chinese had hoped for a stronger expression of apology, such as the apology that PM Obuchi had issued President Kim Dae-jung the month before. Prior to the state visit, a Chinese official had expressed that the apology issued to ROK would be satisfactory if issued similarly to China by changing the words ‘Korean people’ and ‘colonial rule’ to ‘Chinese people’ and ‘aggression’. China was never issued any written apology in the Joint Declaration such as the one issued to ROK, and President Jiang Zemin was instead given an oral apology by Prime Minister Obuchi Keizo that was complemented by a written statement in the declaration that expressed “deep remorse” over past wartime atrocities.

The Chinese side was disappointed that they had not received the apology they expected, and President Jiang Zemin expressed his frustration with the Japanese leaders during the state banquet hosted by Emperor Akihito on November 26, and several times more during his November 28 speech at Waseda University and later that same day during his news conference that was held in Tokyo. The state visit has thus come to be remembered as one of the worst state visits in Japanese public memory.

Talbott was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Helen Josephine (Large) and Nelson Strobridge &quot;Bud&quot; Talbott II. He attended the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut and graduated in 1968 from Yale University, where he had been chairman of the &quot;Yale Daily News&quot;. He was awarded Yale&#x27;s Alpheus Henry Snow Prize. He was also a member of the Scholar of the House program in 1967–68, belonged to a society of juniors and seniors called Saint Anthony Hall, and was elected to the exclusive Elizabethan Club. He became a friend of future President Bill Clinton when both were Rhodes Scholars at the University of Oxford; during his studies there he translated Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s memoirs into English.

==Career==

In 1972, Talbott, along with fellow Rhodes Scholar Robert Reich and friend David E. Kendall, rallied their friends Bill and Hillary Clinton to help the Texas campaign to elect George McGovern as president of the United States. In the 1980s, he was &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s principal correspondent on Soviet-American relations, and his work for the magazine was cited in the three Overseas Press Club Awards won by &quot;Time&quot; in the 1980s. Talbott also wrote several books on disarmament. He translated and edited &quot;Khrushchev Remembers: The Last Testament&quot; (2 volumes, 1974) by Nikita S. Khrushchev.

Following Bill Clinton&#x27;s election as president, Talbott served in the U.S. government. He was appointed Ambassador-at-Large and Special Adviser to the Secretary of State Warren Christopher on the New Independent States from 1993 to 1994, to mitigate the consequences of the Soviet breakup. He was then appointed to the second highest ranking position in the U.S. State Department as deputy secretary of state from 1994 to 2001. After leaving government, he was briefly the Director of the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization.


Talbott was the sixth president of the Brookings Institution in Washington from 2002 to 2017. He helped raise more than $650 million in support of independent policy research and analysis. At Brookings, he was responsible for formulating policies, recommending projects, approving publications and selecting staff, focusing on Eastern Europe, Russia, and nuclear arms control. On January 31, 2017, Talbott announced his resignation from the Brookings Institution. The resignation was later retracted, but in October 2017, he was succeeded by General John R. Allen.

In December 2011, Talbott returned to government service as chair of the U.S. State Department’s Foreign Affairs Policy Board. He was on the advisory board of the DC non-profit America Abroad Media and holds leadership positions in other organizations such as the Aspen Institute and the American Academy of Diplomacy.

==Family==
Talbott married Brooke Shearer in 1971. He had been the college roommate of her brother, Derek. Brooke was a personal aide to Hillary Clinton. They were married for 38 years, until her death on May 19, 2009. He has two sons, Devin and Adrian Talbott, co-founders of the now-defunct Generation Engage. In 2015, he married Barbara Lazear Ascher.

==Quotes==
*&quot;It was Yugoslavia&#x27;s resistance to the broader trends of political and economic reform - not the plight of Kosovar Albanians - that best explains NATO&#x27;s war.&quot;
*&quot;In the next century, nations as we know it will be obsolete; all states will recognize a single, global authority. National sovereignty wasn&#x27;t such a great idea after all.&quot; (&quot;Time&quot;)
*&quot;The Russians have provided an opening for renewed diplomacy. Since last summer, President Dmitry Medvedev has been calling for a &#x27;new Euro-Atlantic security architecture&#x27;. So far, except for rehashing old complaints and the unacceptable claim that other former Soviet republics fall within Russia&#x27;s &#x27;sphere of privileged interests&#x27;, Mr Medvedev and Mr Lavrov have been vague about what they have in mind.
:&quot;That creates a vacuum that the United States and its European partners can fill with their own proposals. The theme of those should be accelerating the emergence of an international system (of which NATO is a part) that is prepared to include Russia rather than exclude or contain it, and to encourage positive forces in Russia that want to see their nation integrated in a globalized world organized around the search for common solutions to common problems.&quot; (&quot;Financial Times&quot;)
*&quot;We already know that the Kremlin helped put Trump into the White House and played him for a sucker…. Trump has been colluding with a hostile Russia throughout his presidency.&quot;

<text>Bahjat Talhouni (; 1913 – January 30, 1994) was a Jordanian political figure. He served as the 14th Prime Minister of Jordan between 1960 and 1970 for six different terms. 
Talhouni was Prime Minister from August 1969 to June 1970, during a particularly turbulent time of friction and skirmishes between the Government and thousands of Palestinian guerrillas who were then in Jordan.

The Palestinian guerrillas, members of various organizations, frequently disregarded Jordanian laws and came to be almost a state within a state.

In February 1970, King Hussein of Jordan met with their leaders at Talhouni&#x27;s house in Amman. At that meeting the King agreed not to enforce restrictions on the Palestinians carrying firearms in Jordanian towns, and the leaders of the guerrillas promised to try to make their followers less unruly.

A strained and often interrupted truce ensued. Then came an unsuccessful attempt on the King&#x27;s life in June.

Angered, the Jordanian Army called loudly for a crackdown on the Palestinians. But as a biographer of the King, Peter Snow, wrote in 1972, &quot;Talhouni wavered; like Hussein, he was not eager to be responsible for the order that could lead to wide-scale bloodshed.&quot;

Late in June 1970, the King replaced Talhouni with a new Prime Minister, Abdel Moneim Rifai, a champion of reconciliation with the Palestinians.

But skirmishes between the Army, which stayed loyal to the King, and the Palestinians escalated into civil war in September 1970. The King let the Army crush the fighters, and by the following summer they had been nullified as a military force in Jordan.

In addition to serving as Prime Minister, over the years Talhouni held the posts of Minister of the Interior and of Justice, chief of the Royal Court, and served as a legislator and personal representative of the King.

He was born in Ma&#x27;an, in what is now southern Jordan, and studied law in Syria. He served as president of the Court of Appeals in Amman before becoming Minister of the Interior in 1953.

He served as the President of the Senate of Jordan from December 1974 to January 1983.

Talhouni died on January 30, 1994, as announced by the Jordanian Government announced. He was 81.

<doc id="917602" wikidata="Q5148040" url="?curid=917602" title="Colombo Rowing Club">
<text>The Colombo Rowing Club (commonly known as CRC) is the premier boat club in Sri Lanka having been founded in 1864. Its clubhouse and boat house are located on the edge of the northern Beira Lake, at Sir Chittapalam A. Gardiner Mawatha (formerly Parsons Road), in Colombo.

Since its inception the Colombo Rowing Club has progressed into one of the most prestigious and active private member clubs in Sri Lanka. A distinctive feature has been that while the club&#x27;s main sporting focus remains in rowing, social interaction and fellowship is also an important aspect. The club claims to be the &quot;cradle of rowing in Sri Lanka&quot; since most affiliated clubs of the Amateur Rowing Association of Sri Lanka, governing body for rowing in Sri Lanka, started from the facilities and infrastructure that is available at the Colombo Rowing Club.

==History==
The club was founded on the July 15, 1864 by Sir Edward Creasy, the former Chief Justice of Ceylon and based on available records, the CRC claims to be the oldest club in the island. The Colombo Rowing Club adopted the club colours of Oxford: Oxford Blue and White. The membership of club was predominantly made up on colonialists affiliated with the many government departments and plantations in the island.

In 1898, the first Boat Race took place between the Colombo Rowing Club and the Madras Boat Club (now Chennai, India). The rivalry prevails to the present day in the form of the Madras-Colombo Regatta in which the Boat Race is the premier event. Thus, the boat race is considered second in vintage only to the prestigious Oxford and Cambridge boat race which is the world&#x27;s oldest, continuing inter-institutional event.

With Ceylon gaining independence the club was opened up to more locals and Alavi Mohomed was selected as the first Ceylonese captain of the Club. In the 1950s and 1960s the club helped to introduce the sport to Royal College, S&#x27; Thomas&#x27; College and University of Colombo. The Club has hosted the annual Royal Thomian Regatta since 1962. The club commemorated its centenary year in 1964. The Colombo Rowing Club and the surrounding Beira Lake have hosted the Sri Lanka National Rowing Championships on twenty-four occasions till 2008. The National Championships have since moved to Bolgoda Lake which boasts a 2000m international distance course.

In 2012, the Colombo Rowing Club was visited by Olympic Gold Medallist Mahé Drysdale and former Oxford Boat Race captain Donald MacDonald whose 1987 Ox-Bridge Boat Race mutiny and subsequent victory inspired the 1996 movie True Blue.

The staircase present at the current premises in Colombo (the club moved to Parson&#x27;s Road circa 1910) was a staircase removed from a British-era ship which was then subsequently fixed at CRC. Similarly, the lighting fixtures at the bar and upper boat house are made from old rowing shells from the 1950s.

==Present situation==
There are 14 institutions currently using the facilities at the Colombo Rowing Club and the club extends all levels of support for the development of rowing. The club hosts as many as 7 regattas throughout the year catering to novices, intermediates and senior oarsmen/women. The current president is Dimuth Gunawardene with Manilka Gunaratene as captain.

CRC won the overall championship at the Amateur Rowing Association of East Regatta in both 2011 when it was hosted by the Bolgoda Lake Rowing Club. It won the regatta once again in 2019 when held in Calcutta.

== The Madras-Colombo Regatta ==
The Madras-Colombo Regatta is the annual rowing encounter between the Colombo Rowing Club and Madras Boat Club. It has been held since 1898. The premier event, the Men&#x27;s Boat Race is the second oldest inter-club boat race in the world, second only to the Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race. Winners of the men&#x27;s regatta are awarded the Deepam Trophy, while the overall winners of the women&#x27;s regatta are awarded the Adyar Trophy.

The regatta has been held continuously barring the two world wars, and other periods of uncertainty such as episodes during the Sri Lankan civil war.

Hosting is rotational with each institution hosting the other annually in both India and Sri Lanka. At present the regatta has evolved into a full regatta with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews competing.

=== Present ===

The last regatta was held in 2019 when Colombo, under the captaincy of Ishika de Silva (CRC&#x27;s first female captain), won both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s regattas. It has not been held since due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

=== Notable Rowers ===
* P.E. Rowlandson (Colombo Crew 1929, Madras Crew 1930) is the only rower to have won a boat race for both Madras and Colombo
* Colombo rowers Gordon Armstrong and Basil Drakeford were subsequently K.I.A. in the Second World War. The former has a regatta named in his honour at the Colombo Rowing Club
* Alavi Mohamed (the first Ceylonese president of the Colombo Rowing Club)
* Ashmitha Gunaratne - The First Ladies coxswain to win the Men’s Boat race in 2019 (Crew : Ruven Weerasinghe (S), Sandesh Bartlett, Abdulla Hassan, Sumith Alexander (B) ) She also coxed the women’s boat race and won in the same regatta.
* Ishika de Silva - CRC’s first female captain of boats who went on to lead two winning crews at both the Madras Colombo and ARAE regattas in the same term in both the men’s and women’s categories.

<text>John Riley Tanner (April 4, 1844 – May 23, 1901) was the 21st Governor of Illinois, from 1897 until 1901.

Tanner was the first governor in the country to be openly neutral in labor disputes, gaining national notoriety for his actions in a series of coal mine disputes. With the Spanish–American War looming, he was the only governor to raise and combat-equip a National Guard unit of African American soldiers led by African American officers.

Tanner&#x27;s administration was capable and efficient, placing the state on a sound financial footing and passing significant legislation. However, he was constantly at odds with Chicago&#x27;s political leaders, both Democratic and Republican, a feud that came to be symbolized by his signing of the infamous &quot;Allen bill&quot;, which gave control of Chicago&#x27;s intra-city transportation network to corrupt financier Charles Yerkes.

Tanner declined to seek a second term as governor, instead choosing to oppose the renomination of his former political ally, Shelby Cullom, as U.S. Senator. Tanner was badly defeated within his own party, ending his political career. He died less than five months after leaving office.

== Early life ==
John Riley Tanner was born on a farm near the town of Boonville in Warrick County, Indiana. His family moved to Illinois when he was a child, and he grew up on a farm near Carbondale. He enlisted in the 98th Illinois Infantry at the age of 19, during the Civil War, and saw service with Sherman&#x27;s army. When the 98th Infantry was mustered out of service in June 1865, Tanner was transferred to the 61st Illinois Infantry, and was mustered out of service later that year. He then returned to southern Illinois and settled in Louisville, Illinois, where he farmed and entered into a partnership with his brother in a milling and lumber business. He married Lauretta Ingraham on Christmas Day 1866 and they had two children, Lucinda J. and J. Mack Tanner, but Lauretta died on October 22, 1887, at the age of 40.

== Political rise ==
Tanner would rise through Republican party ranks to become the unrivaled boss of a powerful political machine. In 1870 he began his long and successful political career in the Illinois Republican party of that era, winning elections and garnering appointments to increasingly important positions. He was first elected to the office of sheriff of Clay County, Illinois (1870–72), and afterwards became circuit court clerk for the county (1872–76). He was appointed master in chancery (i.e., a senior officer of the court) of the circuit court (1877–80), and then served two terms in the Illinois State Senate from the 44th district (1880–1883). Tanner was appointed United States marshal of the Southern District of Illinois by Republican President Chester A. Arthur, but was soon removed by incoming Democratic President Grover Cleveland.

Now prominent in statewide Illinois politics, Tanner was elected State Treasurer in 1886, and in 1891 he was appointed to the State Railroad and Warehouse Commission. In 1892 he was made Assistant Treasurer of the United States Treasury at Chicago, and was elected chairman of the Illinois State Republican Central Committee in 1894, a committee on which he had previously served as a member (1874–84).

As chairman, Tanner was at the head of his party in its heyday of state power and national influence, the boss of a well-oiled political machine that he had helped build. As such, he was instrumental in resuscitating the flagging political fortunes of U.S. Senator Shelby Moore Cullom within his own Republican party.

Tanner was a tireless worker and strong-willed party boss. Under his leadership during the 1896 political campaign, the entire Illinois Republican Party state ticket was elected, the party secured majorities in both branches of the state legislature, and eighteen of their twenty-two candidates for congressmen were elected. Tanner himself was elected governor, defeating incumbent John Peter Altgeld by a wide margin.

== Administration ==

Tanner led up to his inauguration in grand style with his marriage to the socially prominent Cora English on December 30, 1896. She was known for her interest in social reform and her outspoken support of her ideals, views that were shared by her husband.

John Tanner&#x27;s administration was noteworthy in several respects. He placed the state on a sound financial footing, and significant legislation included the establishment of the State Board of Pardons, the State Board of Examiners of Architects, the offices of the State Food Commissioners and the State Commissioners of Game, and the Juvenile Court Act. Western Normal School was established at Macomb (originally a school for teachers, now Western Illinois University).

Tanner was also known for his antagonistic relationship with Chicago, and was often at loggerheads with its political bosses, both Democratic and Republican. The mutual hostility came to be symbolized by the &quot;Allen bill&quot;, a legislation signed by Tanner which gave control of Chicago&#x27;s intra-city transportation system to corrupt financier Charles Yerkes. Faced with long-term constraints that would virtually cripple many efforts to develop the city, Chicago was galvanized into instituting internal reforms and ensuring the bill&#x27;s repeal.

Tanner was an active and unbiased patriot. When the Spanish–American War was declared, he was the first governor in the country to have the state militia ready to be called up into national service. Within 36 hours of President McKinley&#x27;s call for volunteers, ten thousand equipped troops were ready for muster into the U.S. military.

Among Illinois&#x27; contributions were the 8th Illinois Volunteers, an African American regiment with African American officers and an African American commander; and when the President tried to dissuade him from recruiting African Americans, Tanner used his considerable influence to pressure the national government into calling up the regiment and sending them to Cuba, one of ten equipped Illinois regiments to be called up.

Tanner achieved national notoriety with his position on labor disputes at a time when they were characteristically numerous and violent, particularly in the Illinois coalfields. His position was non-partisanship, the first governor to make it a state policy. When violence broke out, he was quick to send state troops to quell the violence, and he was adamantly opposed to the importation of armed men by either side, using troops to enforce state laws against it. The most notable incidents of the day were at Virden (where imported armed men had fired on Illinois strikers), at Pana (racial strife between white and black coal miners, with the governor siding against the position of the white miners), and Carterville (where unarmed African Americans were shot by white miners, an incident vehemently condemned by the governor).

== Legacy ==

Tanner&#x27;s early and untimely death meant that he would never be able to mend the ill feelings that resulted from his disputes within his own party, particularly those that arose from his challenge to Shelby Cullom immediately preceding his death. His relationship with Chicago politicians had been consistently antagonistic over the years, and they felt no inclination to remember him kindly.

He had personally opposed the use of violence against both companies and laborers in labor disputes, and had favored the elevation of African Americans from an inferior social position to one of equality. As neither principle was actively supported by successful politicians of either party, either before or after his term as governor, it is fair to attribute the principles to him personally, and to note that he was out-of-step with his nineteenth century contemporaries.

Tanner is affectionately remembered both by Organized Labor, and by the African Americans who benefited from his policies. Their donations in remembrance of him accounts for the grand tomb that was erected at his grave.

<text>The Chiricahua Mountains massif is a large mountain range in southeastern Arizona which is part of the Basin and Range province of the west and southwestern United States and northwest Mexico; the range is part of the Coronado National Forest. The highest point, Chiricahua Peak, rises above sea level, approximately above the surrounding valleys. The range takes its name from the Chiricahua Apaches native to the region.

The Chiricahua Mountains and other associated ranges, along with Sulphur Springs Valley on the west and the San Simon Valley on the east, form the eastern half of Cochise County in southeast Arizona. The Pedregosa Mountains are found at the southern end of the Chiricahua Mountains, while the Swisshelm Mountains are located to the southwest. The northwest end of the Chiricahua mountains continue as the Dos Cabezas Mountains beyond Apache Pass and the Fort Bowie National Historic Site. Access to the Chiricahua Mountains and Coronado National Forest is through Willcox from the north, Douglas from the south, and Rodeo from the east.

Part of the range lies within the Chiricahua Wilderness, managed by the Coronado National Forest.

==History==
The earliest evidence of humans in the vicinity of the Chiricahua Mountains are Clovis archeological sites such as Double Adobe Site in the Whitewater Draw tributary of Rucker Creek north of Douglas. Subsequently, the Cochise culture another pre-ceramic based culture spanning 3000–200 BCE was defined from sites around the Chiricahua Mountains, including Cave Creek Canyon.

Following the transition to ceramics, artifacts characteristic of both Mogollon culture and its local variants, the Mimbres culture, are found. These relics span the period from 150 BCE – 1450. The influx of other indigenous peoples, such as the Chiricahua Apaches, including the leaders Cochise and Geronimo occupied the area until forced removal in the late 19th century.

The name Chiricahua is believed to originate from the Opata name for the mountains, &quot;Chiwi Kawi&quot;, meaning &quot;Turkey Mountain&quot;. The Chiricahuas were once known for an abundance of wild turkeys.

The first recorded mining claim in the Chiricahua Mountains was the Hidden Treasure claim filed in 1881, and mining has continued intermittently to the present with the greatest periods of activity occurring in the 1920s and 1950s.

More recently, the Chiricahuas have fallen into use by people smugglers and drug cartels, who position lookouts on their peaks to warn of Border Patrol activities.

==Geology overview==
The Chiricahua Mountains are an uplifted structural block of the Basin and Range. The mountains contain Precambrian basement rocks, Paleozoic and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks around a caldera complex formed by volcanic eruptions and intrusions 35–25 million years ago. The last major eruption, 27 million years ago, created the Turkey Creek Caldera and laid down of volcanic ash which fused into welded rhyolite tuff. Subsequent erosion has created mountain ridges covered in stone spires and stone columns, hoodoos, that rise up out of the forest. These natural features, preserved in the Chiricahua National Monument, are composed of Rhyolite Canyon Tuff.

A one to two mile wide band of sedimentary rock running southeast to northwest from south of Portal through Paradise and up to the Dos Cabezas Mountains is the source of mineralized deposits.
The largest of the mines developed in the California district of the Chiricahua Mountains was the Hilltop mine which consisted of 3 interconnected levels totaling .

==Flora and fauna==

The Chiricahua Mountains are a bio-diverse area which is composed of numerous sky islands. Five of the 9 life zones are found in the Chiricahua Mountains. Three hundred and seventy-five avian species have been recorded from the Chiricahua Mountains; some are largely Mexican species for which southern Arizona is the northern limits of their ranges. Other animals of note include ocelots, jaguars, mountain lions, black bears, and white-tailed deer. Of note is that perhaps the last remaining jaguar in the United States is found here, a male named Sombra by wildlife officials.

With the base of the Chiricahuas at about , the range covers about in elevation. Grasslands and desert cover the base of the range, with ponderosa pine and Douglas fir at the highest elevations. Cave Creek Canyon on the east side is home to the American Museum of Natural History Southwest Research Station and the small towns of Portal and Paradise.

<text>Nur Muhammad Taraki (; 14 July 1917 – 9 October 1979) was an Afghan communist politician, journalist and writer. He was a founding member of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) who served as its General Secretary from 1965 to 1979 and Chairman of the Revolutionary Council from 1978 to 1979.

Taraki was born in Nawa, Ghazni Province, and he got his primary and secondary education from district Pishin in Balochistan and graduated from Kabul University, after which he started his political career as a journalist. From the 1940s onward Taraki also wrote novels and short stories in the socialist realism style. Forming the PDPA at his residence in Kabul along with Babrak Karmal, he was elected as the party&#x27;s General Secretary at its first congress. He ran as a candidate in the 1965 Afghan parliamentary election but failed to win a seat. In 1966 he published the &quot;Khalq&quot;, a party newspaper advocating for class struggle, but the government closed it down shortly afterward. In 1978 he, Hafizullah Amin and Babrak Karmal initiated the Saur Revolution and established the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

Taraki&#x27;s leadership was short-lived and marked by controversies. The government was divided between two PDPA factions: the Khalqists (led by Taraki), the majority, and the Parchamites, the minority. Taraki along with his &quot;protégé&quot; Amin started a purge of the government and party that led to several high-ranking Parchamite members being sent into de facto exile by being assigned to serve overseas as ambassadors, and later started jailing domestic Parchamites. His regime locked up dissidents and oversaw massacres of villagers, citing the necessity of Red Terror by the Bolsheviks in Soviet Russia, that opponents of the Saur Revolution had to be eliminated. These factors, among others, led to a popular backlash that initiated a rebellion. Despite repeated attempts, Taraki was unable to persuade the Soviet Union to intervene in support of the restoration of civil order. Amin initiated most of these policies behind the scenes.

Taraki&#x27;s reign was marked by a cult of personality centered around him that Amin had cultivated. The state press and subsequent propaganda started to refer to him as the &quot;Great Leader&quot; and &quot;Great Teacher&quot;, and his portrait became a common sight throughout the country. His relationship with Amin turned sour during his rule, ultimately resulting in Taraki&#x27;s overthrow on 14 September 1979 and subsequent murder on 8 October, on Amin&#x27;s orders, with Kabul press reporting that he died of illness. His death was a factor that led to the Soviet intervention in December 1979.

== Early life and career ==
Taraki was born on 14 July 1917 to a Khilji Pashtun Tarakai peasant family in the Nawa District of Ghazni Province, part of what was then the Emirate of Afghanistan. He was the oldest of three children and attended a village school in Nawa, before leaving in 1932 what had become the Kingdom of Afghanistan, at the age of 15, to work in the port city of Bombay, India. There he met a Kandahari merchant family who employed him as a clerk for the Pashtun Trading Company. Taraki&#x27;s first encounter with communism was during his night courses, where he met several Communist Party of India members who impressed him with their discussions on social justice and communist values. Another important event was his encounter with Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan, a Pashtun nationalist and leader of the Red Shirt Movement in neighbouring India, who was an admirer of the works of Vladimir Lenin.

In 1937, Taraki started working for Abdul Majid Zabuli, the Minister of Economics, who introduced him to several Russians. Later Taraki became Deputy Head of the Bakhtar News Agency and became known throughout the country as an author and poet. His best known book, the &quot;De Bang Mosaferi&quot;, highlights the socio-economic difficulties facing Afghan workers and peasants. His works were translated into Russian language in the Soviet Union, where his work was viewed as embodying scientific socialist themes. He was hailed by the Soviet Government as &quot;Afghanistan&#x27;s Maxim Gorky&quot;. On his visit to the Soviet Union Taraki was greeted by Boris Ponomarev, the Head of the International Department of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other Communist Party of the Soviet Union members.

Under &quot;Sardar&quot; Mohammad Daoud Khan&#x27;s prime ministership, suppression of radicals was common. However, because of his language skills, Taraki was sent to the Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months, Taraki began denouncing the Royal Afghan Government under King Zahir, and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Royal Afghan Government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavourable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment, Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission in Kabul as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People&#x27;s Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.

At the founding congress of the PDPA, held in his own home in Kabul&#x27;s Karte Char district, Taraki won a competitive election against Babrak Karmal to the post of general secretary on 1 January 1965. Karmal became second secretary. Taraki ran as a candidate for the PDPA during the September 1965 parliamentary election but did not win a seat. Shortly after the election, he launched &quot;Khalq&quot;, the first major left-wing newspaper in Afghanistan. The paper was banned within one month of its first printing. In 1967, less than two years after its founding, the PDPA split into several factions. The largest of these included Khalq (&quot;Masses&quot;) led by Taraki, and Parcham (&quot;Banner&quot;) led by Karmal. The main differences between the factions were ideological, with Taraki supporting the creation of a Leninist-like state, while Karmal wanted to establish a &quot;broad democratic front&quot;.

On 17 April 1978, a prominent leftist named Mir Akbar Khyber was assassinated and the murder was blamed on Mohammed Daoud Khan&#x27;s Republic of Afghanistan. His death served as a rallying point for the pro-communist Afghans. Fearing a communist coup d&#x27;état, Daoud ordered the arrest of certain PDPA leaders, including Taraki and Karmal, while placing others such as Hafizullah Amin under house arrest. On 27 April 1978, the Saur Revolution was initiated, reportedly by Amin while still under house arrest. Khan was killed the next day along with most of his family. The PDPA rapidly gained control and on 1 May Taraki became Chairman of the Revolutionary Council, a role which subsumed the responsibilities of both president and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (literally prime minister in Western parlance). The country was then renamed the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan (DRA), installing a regime that would last until April 1992.

==Leadership==

===Establishment and purge===

Taraki was appointed Chairman of the Revolutionary Council (head of state) and Chairman of the Council of Ministers (head of government) while retaining his post as PDPA general secretary (supreme leader). He initially formed a government which consisted of both Khalqists and Parchamites; Karmal became Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Revolutionary Council while Amin became Minister of Foreign Affairs and Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Internal problems soon arose and several prominent Khalqists accused the Parcham faction of conspiring against the Taraki government. A Khalqi purge of the Parcham then began with the faction&#x27;s most prominent members being sent out of the country: Karmal became Afghan Ambassador to Czechoslovakia and Mohammad Najibullah became Afghan Ambassador to Iran. Internal struggle was not only to be found between the Khalqist and Parchamites; tense rivalry between Taraki and Amin had begun in the Khalq faction with both vying for control.

Karmal was recalled from Czechoslovakia but rather than returning to Afghanistan he went into hiding with Anahita Ratebzad, his friend and former Afghan ambassador to Yugoslavia, as he feared execution if he returned. Muhammad Najibullah followed them. Taraki consequently stripped them of all official titles and political authority.

The new government, under Taraki, launched a campaign of repression against opponents of the Saur Revolution, which killed thousands, mostly at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. Estimates for the number executed at the prison, between April 1978 and December 1979, are as high as 27,000.

===Socio-economic changes===
====Land reform====
Taraki&#x27;s Government initiated a land reform on 1 January 1979 which attempted to limit the amount of land a family could own. Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would be met with popular approval amongst the rural population while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.

Contrary to government expectations, the reform was neither popular nor productive. Agricultural harvests plummeted and the reform itself led to rising discontent amongst Afghans. When Taraki realized the degree of popular dissatisfaction with the reform he quickly abandoned the policy. However, the land reform was gradually implemented under the later Karmal administration, although the proportion of land area impacted by the reform is unclear.

====Other reforms====
In the months following the coup, Taraki and other party leaders initiated other radical Marxist policies that challenged both traditional Afghan values and well-established traditional power structures in rural areas. Taraki introduced women to political life and legislated an end to forced marriage. However, he ruled over a nation with a deep Islamic religious culture and a long history of resistance to any type of strong centralized governmental control, and consequently many of these reforms were not actually implemented nationwide. Popular resentment of Taraki&#x27;s drastic policy changes triggered surging unrest throughout the country, reducing government control to only a limited area. The strength of this anti-reform backlash would ultimately lead to the Afghan civil war.

Traditional practices that were deemed feudal—such as usury, bride price and forced marriage—were banned, and the minimum age of marriage was raised. The government stressed education for both women and men, and launched an ambitious literacy campaign.

Under the previous administration of Mohammad Daoud Khan, a literacy programme created by UNESCO had been launched with the objective of eliminating illiteracy within 20 years. The government of Taraki attempted to reduce this time frame from 20 to four years, an unrealistic goal in light of the shortage of teachers and limited government capacity to oversee such an initiative. The duration of the project was later lengthened to seven years by the Soviets in the aftermath of the Soviet intervention. The cultural focus of the UNESCO programme was declared &quot;rubbish&quot; by Taraki, who instead chose to introduce a political orientation by utilizing PDPA leaflets and left-wing pamphlets as basic reading material.

On 19 August 1978, Afghan Independence Day, Taraki started the broadcasts of Afghanistan National Television, the first TV channel in the country.

===Afghan–Soviet relations===
Taraki signed a Twenty-Year Treaty of Friendship with the Soviet Union on 5 December 1978 which greatly expanded Soviet aid to his regime. Following the Herat uprising, Taraki contacted Alexei Kosygin, chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, and asked for &quot;practical and technical assistance with men and armament&quot;. Kosygin was unfavorable to the proposal on the basis of the negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country, and he rejected all further attempts by Taraki to solicit Soviet military aid in Afghanistan. Following Kosygin&#x27;s rejection Taraki requested aid from Leonid Brezhnev, the general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Soviet head of state, who warned him that full Soviet intervention &quot;would only play into the hands of our enemies – both yours and ours&quot;. Brezhnev also advised Taraki to ease up on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime.

In 1979, Taraki attended a conference of the Non-Aligned Movement in Havana, Cuba. On his way back he stopped in Moscow on 20 March and met with Brezhnev, foreign minister Andrei Gromyko and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal was present at the meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki&#x27;s Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet–Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists, and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price. However, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki&#x27;s rule as well as later during Amin&#x27;s short rule.

===Taraki–Amin break===

In the first months after the April 1978 revolution, Hafizullah Amin and Taraki had a very close relationship. Taraki reportedly remarked, &quot;Amin and I are like nail and flesh, not separable&quot;. Amin set about constructing a personality cult centered on Taraki. In party and government meetings Amin always referred to Taraki as &quot;The Great Leader&quot;, &quot;The Star of the East&quot; or &quot;The Great Thinker&quot; among other titles, while Amin was given such titles as &quot;The True Disciple and Student&quot;. Amin would later come to realize he had created a monster when the Kim Il Sung-style personality cult he had created inspired Taraki to become overly confident and believe in his own brilliance. Taraki began discounting Amin&#x27;s suggestions, fostering in Amin a deep sense of resentment. As their relationship turned increasingly sour, a power struggle developed between them for the control of the Afghan Army. Their relations came to a head later that year when Taraki accused Amin of nepotism after Amin had appointed several family members to high-ranking positions.

On 3 August 1978, a KGB delegation visited Afghanistan, and on first impression of general Oleg Kalugin, Taraki &quot;did not have the physical strength or the backing to continue to lead the country for long&quot;, adding that Amin was a &quot;far more impressive figure&quot;.

Taraki could count on the support of four prominent army officers in his struggle against Amin: Aslam Watanjar, Sayed Mohammad Gulabzoy, Sherjan Mazdoryar and Assadullah Sarwari. These men had joined the PDPA not because of ideological reasons, but instead due to their lofty political ambitions. They also had developed a close relationship with Alexander Puzanov, the Soviet ambassador in Afghanistan, who was eager to use them against Amin. After the Herat uprising on 17 March 1979, the PDPA Politburo and the Revolutionary Council established the Homeland Higher Defence Council, to which Taraki was elected its chairman while Amin became its deputy. At around the same time, Taraki left his post as Council of Ministers chairman and Amin was elected his successor. Amin&#x27;s new position offered him little real influence, however; as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Amin had the power to elect every member of the cabinet, but all of them had to be approved by the head of state, Taraki. In reality, through this maneuver Taraki had effectively reduced Amin&#x27;s power base by forcing him to relinquish his hold on the Afghan Army in order to take on the supposedly heavy responsibilities of his new but ultimately powerless post.

During Taraki&#x27;s foreign visit to the 6th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement in Cuba, his Gang of Four had received an intelligence report that Amin was planning to arrest or kill them. This report, it turned out, was incorrect. Nonetheless, the Gang of Four were ordered to assassinate Amin, its leader Sarwari selecting his nephew Aziz Akbari to conduct the assassination. However, Akbari was not informed that he was the chosen assassin or that it was a secret mission, and he confided the information to contacts in the Soviet embassy. The embassy responded by warning Amin of the assassination attempt, thereby saving him from certain death.

==Assassination==
On 11 September 1979, Chairman Taraki was greeted by Amin at the airport on his return to Kabul from Moscow. The flight was scheduled to land at 2:30, but Amin forced the delay of the landing by an hour as a demonstration to Taraki of his control over the government. Shortly afterward, Taraki, instead of reporting to the cabinet about the Havana Summit, indirectly tried to dismiss Amin from his position as per the plot of the Soviets. He sought to neutralise Amin&#x27;s power and influence by requesting that he serve overseas as an ambassador, but Amin turned down the proposal, shouting &quot;You are the one who should quit! Because of drink and old age you have taken leave of your senses.&quot; The following day, Taraki invited Amin to the Arg (the Presidential palace) for lunch with him and the Gang of Four. Amin turned down the offer, stating he would prefer their resignation rather than lunching with them. Soviet Ambassador Puzanov managed to persuade Amin to make the visit to the palace along with Sayed Daoud Tarun, the Chief of Police, and Nawab Ali (an intelligence officer). Inside the palace on 14 September, bodyguards within the building opened fire on the visitors. Tarun was killed but Amin only sustained injuries and escaped to his car, driving to the Ministry of Defence. Shortly afterwards, Amin placed the Army on high alert, ordered the detainment of Taraki, and telephoned Puzanov about the incident. That evening at 6:30, tanks from the 4th Armoured Corps entered the city and stood at government positions. Amin returned to the Arg with a contingent of Army officers and placed Taraki under arrest. The Gang of Four, however, had &quot;disappeared&quot;, taking refuge at the Soviet embassy.

The Soviets tried to dissuade Amin from expelling Taraki and his associates from their positions, but Amin refused. On 15 September, a Soviet battalion at Bagram Air Base and the embassy were put in position in an attempt to rescue Taraki, but they were never ordered to make a move as they felt that Amin&#x27;s forces had the edge. At 8pm on 16 September, Radio Kabul announced that Taraki had informed the PDPA Politburo that he was no longer able to continue his duties, and that the Politburo subsequently elected Amin as the new General Secretary. After Taraki&#x27;s arrest, Amin reportedly discussed the incident with Leonid Brezhnev in which he said, &quot;Taraki is still around. What should I do with him?&quot; Brezhnev replied that it was his choice. Amin, who now believed he had the full support of the Soviets, ordered the death of Taraki. Taraki&#x27;s death occurred on 8 October 1979, when he was (according to most accounts) suffocated with pillows by three men under Amin&#x27;s orders. Taraki did not resist nor did he say anything as he was instructed by the men to lie down on a bed to be suffocated. His body was secretly buried by the men at night. The news shocked Brezhnev, who had vowed to protect Taraki. It was also one of the factors of the Soviet intervention two months later. The Afghan media reported two days later that the ailing Taraki had died of a &quot;serious illness&quot;, omitting any mention of his murder.

==Post-death==
On the day that Taraki was assassinated, 28 men and women from Taraki&#x27;s extended family (including his wife and brother) were jailed at Pul-e-Charkhi prison. After Karmal came into power, Taraki&#x27;s jailed relatives, including his widow, were released.

In the 2 January 1980 edition of the &quot;Kabul New Times&quot; (the day of the PDPA&#x27;s 15th anniversary), the education minister Anahita Ratebzad called Taraki &quot;the martyred son of the country&quot;, and denounced Hafizullah Amin as &quot;this savage despot, beastly, lunatic, and recognised spy of the imperialism of America&quot;.

<text>Chengara Veetil Devan Nair (5 August 1923 – 6 December 2005), also known as C. V. Devan Nair, better known as Devan Nair, was a Singaporean politician and union leader who served as the third president of Singapore from 1981 until his resignation in 1985.

Politically active in both Malaysia and Singapore, Nair was a communist as a young adult, having been affiliated with the Malayan Communist Party (MCP). He harboured anti-colonial sentiments and campaigned for the self-determination of Singapore, which was then a British colony, causing him to be detained by the British in 1951. In 1954, he joined the People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP). He was detained again by the British in 1956 and remained so until the PAP won the 1959 general election and helped secure his release. In 1961, he founded the National Trade Union Congress (NTUC), serving as its Secretary-General until 1965.

During his parliamentary career, Nair was the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Malaysian constituency of Bangsar between 1964 and 1969 and for the Singapore constituency of Anson between 1979 and 1981. Prior to his presidency, Nair was Secretary-General of the People&#x27;s Action Party of Malaya prior to Singapore&#x27;s expulsion from Malaysia and continued to serve after the expulsion under its new name Democratic Action Party (DAP) which he founded until 1967.

Nair would soon return to Singapore and echoed his leftist beliefs by becoming involved in the labour movement, including serving as Secretary-General of the NTUC once more between 1970 and 1979, before taking up the presidency in 1981. He was succeeded by Wee Kim Wee on 2 September 1985. After his presidency in 1985, Nair retired from politics and briefly moved to the United States before moving again to live out his final years in Hamilton, Canada, when he died there at the age of 82 of dementia in 2005.

==Early life and education==
Born on 5 August 1923 in Malacca during British colonial rule. Of Malayali ancestry, Nair was the son of a rubber plantation clerk, I. V. Karunakaran Nair of the Illathu Veettil family, who was originally from Thalassery, Kerala, British India.

Nair and his family emigrated to Singapore when he was ten years old and he received his primary education at Rangoon Road Primary School before enrolling into Victoria School for his secondary education where he passed his Senior Cambridge examination in 1940.

After the Second World War, Nair became a teacher at St Joseph&#x27;s Institution and later, at St Andrew&#x27;s School. In 1949, he became General-Secretary of the Singapore Teachers&#x27; Union. His disdain for colonial rule was apparent in those days, as he changed the lyrics of &quot;Rule, Britannia!&quot; to anti-British ones in a school choir performance before a British guest-of-honour.

==Career==
===Anti-imperialism beliefs===
Nair was initially a member of the Communist Anti-British League before joining Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) in 1954. Nair had been detained in 1951 by the British for anti-colonial activities. In 1955, Nair contested the 1955 Singaporean general election but lost – becoming the only PAP candidate who did not get elected.

In 1956, he was detained again under the Preservation of Public Security Ordinance Act together with trade unionists Lim Chin Siong and James Puthucheary as suspected communist subversives after the Chinese middle schools riots. Nair was released in 1959 when the PAP won the 1959 Singaporean general election in a landslide victory. He was subsequently appointed political secretary to the Minister for Education. He returned to teaching after a year. In 1960, he became Chairman of the Prisons Inquiry Commission and launched the Adult Education Board.

===Involvement in PAP, DAP, and NTUC===
He was the only PAP member who contested in the 1964 Malaysian general election and won Bangsar, near Kuala Lumpur. This contrasted with his 1955 election defeat. He stayed in Malaysia after the separation, forming the Democratic Action Party (DAP), but returned to Singapore in 1969 to eventually lead the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) once more, the labour union movement which he helped to established in 1961. Nair and P. P. Narayanan were advocates for the concerns of developing countries and voiced their concerns at the ICFTU as they saw economic and social policy documents that were biased towards industrialized nations. They wanted greater attention paid to extreme poverty, unemployment and underdevelopment of their countries. These proposals were accepted and later reflected in the work of ICFTU&#x27;s Economic and Social Committee.

===President of Singapore===
He entered the Parliament of Singapore in 1979 by winning the Anson seat in a by-election, and retained the seat in the 1980 general election. He resigned the seat in 1981 to accept the then largely ceremonial office of President as the country&#x27;s head of state. This resulted in the 1981 Anson by-election which was notably won by opposition leader J. B. Jeyaretnam of the Workers&#x27; Party (WP), the first time in Singapore since 1963 when a party candidate not from the PAP had won a parliamentary seat.

====Resignation====
On 28 March 1985, Nair suddenly resigned in unclear circumstances. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong stated in Parliament that Nair resigned to get treatment for his alcoholism, a charge Nair hotly denied. According to Nair&#x27;s counterclaim, he resigned under pressure when their political views came into conflict and Goh threatened him during a game of chess to oust him as president. Nair also alleged that he was fed drugs to make him appear disoriented and that rumours were spread about his personal life in an attempt to discredit him. 

However, Nair&#x27;s claims were never substantiated. In 1999, an article about the case in the Canadian newspaper &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; resulted in a libel suit by Goh. Some claimed that the suit was thrown out of court after Nair&#x27;s counterclaim. However, in a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, it is said that Goh agreed to discontinue the suit only when two of Nair&#x27;s sons issued a statement, reported in &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; on 1 July 2004, maintaining that Nair was no longer mentally competent to give evidence in court. &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; statement concluded that &quot;having reviewed the records, and on the basis of the family&#x27;s knowledge of the circumstances leading to Mr. Nair&#x27;s resignation as President of Singapore in March 1985, we can declare that there is no basis for this allegation (of Mr. Nair being drugged).&quot;

==Personal life and death==
After his resignation as President, Nair and his wife migrated first to the United States in 1988 where they settled in Gaithersburg, Maryland. They later moved to Bloomington, Indiana. The couple later moved to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where they lived for the rest of their lives. His wife, Avadai Dhanam Lakshimi, died on 18 April 2005 in Hamilton, whilst Nair, who had developed severe dementia, died on 6 December of the same year as his wife in Hamilton, Canada. After his death, he was cremated and his ashes were buried at White Chapel Memorial Park, together with his wife.

Nair was survived by his daughter, three sons, and five grandchildren. His eldest son, Janadas Devan, was a senior editor with &quot;The Straits Times&quot; and is currently Chief of Government Communications at the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) and also a director at the public policy think-tank Institute of Policy Studies (IPS). Janadas Devan is married to literary scholar Geraldine Heng. His second son, Janamitra Devan, was the former Vice-President of the International Finance Corporation, and the World Bank. His third son, Janaprakash Devan died in 2009. His only daughter, Vijaya Kumari Devan continues to reside in Hamilton, Ontario. Nair was a good friend of Dutch economist Albert Winsemius, and composed a poem titled &quot;The Yangtze&#x27;s Voyage Through History&quot; for him.

===Devan Nair Institute===
Nair&#x27;s legacy remains highly respected in Singapore, especially in regards to his association with the labour movement. The Devan Nair Institute for Employment and Employability located in Jurong East was opened on 1 May 2014 by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to recognise his contributions to the labour movement when he was Secretary-General of National Trades Union Congress. The goal of the institution is to establish a network for workers and employers seeking employment and employability solutions in Singapore.

<text>Mack &amp; Mabel is a musical with a book by Michael Stewart and music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. The plot involves the tumultuous romantic relationship between Hollywood director Mack Sennett and Mabel Normand (transformed from an artist&#x27;s model to a waitress from Flatbush, Brooklyn for the musical), who became one of his biggest stars. In a series of flashbacks, Sennett relates the glory days of Keystone Studios from 1911, when he discovered Normand and cast her in dozens of his early &quot;two-reelers&quot;, through his creation of Sennett&#x27;s Bathing Beauties and the Keystone Cops to Mabel&#x27;s death from tuberculosis in 1930.

The original 1974 Broadway production produced by David Merrick starred Robert Preston and Bernadette Peters. It received eight Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical, but did not win any. There was no nomination for Jerry Herman&#x27;s score. Although the original production closed after only eight weeks, the songs were praised, and subsequent productions, especially in Britain, have had success.

==Background and productions==
Edwin Lester, the director of the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera, suggested the project to Jerry Herman, who then involved Michael Stewart. David Merrick agreed to produce, and Gower Champion was engaged to direct and choreograph. Although Champion had initially declined the offer, he eventually accepted, especially when it was decided to hold the pre-Broadway tryouts in California. Robert Preston was hired as Mack. For the role of Mabel, several actresses were engaged and then let go, including Marcia Rodd and Kelly Garrett, before the young Bernadette Peters finally joined the cast.

===Pre-Broadway tryouts===
&quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; opened in pre-Broadway tryouts in San Francisco on June 17, 1974 and then Los Angeles, with brisk box office sales in both cities. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot; &#x27;Mack and Mabel&#x27; has been doing rather better than its probable guarantee [in Los Angeles] – up to $150,000 in its final seven-day period.&quot; The musical received reviews that ranged &quot;from fair to phenomenal in San Diego, Los Angeles, and St. Louis&quot;. The Los Angeles reviews were &quot;encouraging but guarded&quot;, and warned &quot;of the excessive comic sequences, uneven book, and, most especially, the dark ending.&quot; Buoyed by the critical response and initial public enthusiasm for the show, Herman and company ignored a number of warning signs. Neither Sennett nor Normand was a particularly lovable character, and their story was darker than that usually found in a musical. Preston (as Sennett) was too old for Peters (Mabel), and their characters lacked chemistry. Champion devised a number of eye-catching visual effects and spectacular dance sequences set to Philip J. Lang&#x27;s orchestrations, but their brightness proved to be too great a contrast with the somber mood of the piece. His concept of setting the action in the corner of a huge studio soundstage created problems with the set and limited the staging to the extent that it was seen as static and boring. Audiences &quot;were not ready for a down-beat saga about a cocaine-sniffing movie queen.&quot;

Efforts were made to resolve the problems at The Muny in St. Louis, where the musical ran for one week starting August 19, 1974, but this venue was a &quot;terrible mistake&quot;. Because The Muny was so large, the performers overplayed and pulled the show out of shape. By the Washington, D.C. Kennedy Center engagement, &quot;nothing was working&quot;, and Champion changed the staging of scenes that had previously worked. Richard Coe in his review for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; stated that it had landed at the Kennedy Center &quot;with all the zip of a wet, very dead flounder.&quot;

===Broadway===
The musical opened at the Majestic Theatre on Broadway on October 6, 1974, and closed on November 30, 1974, after 66 performances and six previews. Scenic design was by Robin Wagner, costume design by Patricia Zipprodt, and lighting design by Tharon Musser. In addition to Preston and Peters, the cast featured Lisa Kirk as Lottie Ames and James Mitchell as William Desmond Taylor.

Despite only fair reviews and the short run, the show received eight Tony Award nominations: for Best Musical, the book, direction, choreography, lead actor, lead actress and designs but did not win any. Herman, whose melodic score had received the best notices, was not nominated. He was deeply disappointed, since the project had been one of his favorites (and remained until the end of his life), and he felt producer David Merrick had done little to promote it, saying &quot;He never invested in advertising. He never came to the theatre.&quot; Herman had turned down three film offers before its Broadway opening, later commenting early in its New York run that he believed he was then in a &quot;stronger position.&quot; Despite its failure, the show has developed a cult following.

===Subsequent productions===

&quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; was first produced in England in 1981 at the Nottingham Playhouse. The production starred Denis Quilley as Mack and Imelda Staunton as Mabel; it had a successful run but failed to transfer to the West End. Soon afterward, British ice-skating team Torvill and Dean, who were based in Nottingham, searched the music library at the local radio station for suitable material for their routines, and discovered a recording of the original cast album. When they won the gold medal for ice dance in the World Figure Skating Championships in 1982, they performed to the &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; overture. Later, the routine was broadcast by BBC Television during the 1984 Olympics, with the British public demand so great that the album was re-released in the UK, where it reached number 6 on the charts.

In February 1988, a one-time concert, featuring George Hearn, Georgia Brown, Denis Quilley, Paige O&#x27;Hara, and Tommy Tune was staged for charity at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London. A cast recording was released.

;1995 West End
On November 7, 1995, a full-scale production opened at the Piccadilly Theatre in London, and ran for 270 performances. The book had been dramatically revised, including a happy ending, with Mabel back in Mack&#x27;s arms at the final curtain. The show was directed by Paul Kerryson and choreographed by Michael Smuin, and the cast included Howard McGillin as Mack and Caroline O&#x27;Connor as Mabel, Kathryn Evans, and Alan Mosley.

;2005-2006 Watermill and West End
The show was revived at the Watermill Theatre, in Newbury, England. David Soul starred alongside Anna-Jane Casey (replaced by Janie Dee in the West End production) in the small-scale production (with only eleven performers), which ran for a limited season between March and June 2005. The show then toured the UK from January 2006 prior to a West End transfer, where it played at the Criterion Theatre from April 10, 2006, until July 1, 2006. It featured the trademark style of director John Doyle, with the cast members, except for Soul, playing musical instruments as well as acting and singing.

;2007 and 2008 productions
The show was produced at the Shaw Festival Theatre in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario in 2007. Directed by Molly Smith, this production eliminated the use of projected film as called for in the script. Instead, monochromatic costumes and special lighting were used to produce the effect of silent film while using live actors on stage. The result was a seamless blend between silent film scenes, and full color. Shaw&#x27;s presentation was the first full production in Canada and was in repertory at the Festival Theatre until October 28, 2007.

The Broadway Theatre, Catford, London, UK, produced the musical from November 2008 through December 2008, starring Karl Clarkson (Mack), Gemma Boaden (Mabel) and Sean Pol McGreevy (Frank), directed by Artistic Director Thom Southerland. Southerland had assisted John Doyle with the 2005-2006 production.

;2011
The Company Music Theatre produced a short run of the show in August 2011 at the Greenwich Theatre, London, directed by Ben Occhpinti, choreographed by Lee Crowley, with Musical Director Dan Swana.

;2012
It was revived in July 2012 at the Southwark Playhouse, under the direction of Thom Southerland, with choreography by Lee Proud. The title roles were played by Norman Bowman and Laura Pitt-Pulford, with Jessica Martin as Lottie, Stuart Matthew Price as Frank Capra and Peter Kenworthy as William Desmond Taylor.

;2013
Musical Theatre West in Long Beach, California performed a concert version at the Carpenter Performing Arts Center on May 20, starring Davis Gaines, as Mack Sennett, with direction by Larry Carpenter, choreography by Karl Warden and musical direction by John McDaniel. Eldorado Productions performed Mack &amp; Mabel at The Bob Hope Theatre in Eltham, south east London, from 9 to 12 October 2013, with Neil Whitaker as Mack and Jo-jo Butler starring as Mabel, directed by Jeanette Wallis; this production included the original ending.

;2015
Chichester Festival Theatre in West Sussex, UK presented a new production from 13 July to 5 September 2015, with a UK tour following from 1 October to 6 December 2015. The musical starred Michael Ball as Mack Sennett and Rebecca LaChance, with direction by Jonathan Church, choreography by Stephen Mear and design by Robert Jones.

Porchlight Music Theatre, Chicago, Illinois, presented &quot;Mack and Mabel&quot; in May 2015, as a part of &quot;Porchlight Revisits&quot;, in which they stage three forgotten musicals per year. It was directed by Michael Weber and music directed by Beckie Menzie.

;2018
Shaftesbury Arts Centre in North Dorset, UK presented an amateur production from 12 to 30 July 2018, directed by Sophie Lester, with musical director David Grierson.

;2020
New York City Center Encores! staged concert production ran from February 19 to 23, 2020. It was directed and choreographed by Josh Rhodes and dedicated to the memory of Jerry Herman, who had recently died. Douglas Sills and Alexandra Socha starred.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
Silent movie director Mack Sennett returns to his old film studio in Brooklyn in 1938. Things have changed considerably since he was last there—he sees a group of actors shooting a scene for a talkie. Mack reminisces about &quot;when he ran the show&quot;, the glorious era of silent movies, thinking of his Bathing Beauties and Keystone Cops (&quot;Movies Were Movies&quot;).

In a flashback, it is 1911. When Mabel, a delicatessen worker, delivers a sandwich to Lottie, the actress that Mack is filming, Lottie is unable to pay, and Mabel reacts violently. Mabel&#x27;s dramatic behaviour catches Mack&#x27;s eye, and he thinks she has potential as an actress. He offers her a part in his next film. She initially refuses, but when she looks back on the offer, she is dazzled by the career prospects (&quot;Look What Happened To Mabel&quot;).

Mabel is very successful and becomes a major star. Later, along with Mack&#x27;s two accountants, Kleiman and Fox, who are helping to finance his projects, the film company moves to a new, larger studio, in California. Lottie and the rest of Mack&#x27;s film crew, who include the comedian Fatty Arbuckle, eagerly fantasize about moving up in the world, (&quot;Big Time&quot;). Meanwhile, Mabel has become attracted to Mack. Mack catches her unawares while she is reciting an improvised poem, and she invites him into her train compartment for a meal. Though he has become fond of Mabel, Mack has no time for serious romance (&quot;I Won&#x27;t Send Roses&quot;). He reluctantly takes part in a mock wedding ceremony, and he and Mabel sleep together, but Mack wakes up horrified and leaves in a hurry. Mabel is still in love with Mack, and resolves to do things his way (&quot;I Won&#x27;t Send Roses&quot; (Reprise)).

Eventually, Mabel wants to try other genres of film. Frank, an actor in Mack&#x27;s company who aspires to bigger things, sees Mabel&#x27;s potential as a serious actor, and has written a romantic drama called Molly, with her in mind for the title role. Mabel, who is still in love with Mack and afraid of losing him, reluctantly declines. Mack is only interested in comedy (&quot;I Wanna Make The World Laugh&quot;). Mabel eventually stands up to Mack and lobs a prop pie at him during rehearsals. Soon the whole cast is throwing pies, and the resulting melee inspires another set of two-reelers. Mabel regrets her childish behaviour, and the status quo is resumed.

Eventually, Mabel meets a director of serious films, the smooth-talking William Desmond Taylor, whose films she has adored for years, at a hotel reception. He is instantly attracted to her, and invites her to audition for his next film. He informs her that he has admired her for years, and believed she deserves better than two-reelers. Taylor informs Mabel that he has repeatedly asked Mack to loan her to his studios for one picture, but Mack has refused. Mabel is horrified. Taylor also invites her to dinner. Mack tries in vain to discourage her. After a heated argument, Mabel dresses in her best clothes and puts on make-up, then goes off not only for her appointment with Taylor, but for good, as she never wants to see Mack again (&quot;Wherever He Ain&#x27;t&quot;). Mack is confident that he can manage without Mabel: he made a star out of one ordinary girl, and he can make a star out of another. With this in mind, he immediately comes up with the concept of the Bathing Beauties (&quot;Hundreds of Girls&quot;).

;Act II
Five years after Mabel&#x27;s departure, the popularity of the Bathing Beauties is waning, and Mack comes under pressure to ask Mabel back. Fortunately, Mabel has realised she still has feelings for Mack and returns to the studios. She is welcomed with open arms by the entire film company (&quot;When Mabel Comes In The Room&quot;). Mack is so glad to have her back that he agrees to film &quot;Molly&quot;, at his studio. But he attempts to turn it into a comedy, by way of his latest creation, The Keystone Cops, (&quot;My Heart Leaps Up&quot;), and Mabel returns to Taylor. Mack sees Mabel again as she is preparing to embark on a ship with Taylor. Taylor shows up and Mack leaves. Taylor, sensing that Mabel might still have feelings for Mack, persuades Mabel, who is complaining of tiredness, to take heroin, saying it is a pick-me-up, which works with the magic words, &quot;Bye, Mack!&quot;. Mabel is heartbroken by everything Mack has done to her, (&quot;Time Heals Everything&quot;).

The show suddenly fasts forward six years. Talkies are all the rage, and Lottie Ames, another actress in Mack&#x27;s company, has become a star (&quot;Tap Your Troubles Away&quot;), but Mabel has become a full-time drug addict and her reputation is ruined. To add further to the tragedy, her lover, William Desmond Taylor, is murdered, and she is the prime suspect. Mack refuses to believe Mabel is a drug addict, and finally willing to try to patch things up between him and Mabel, but it is too late - she has died. The musical ends with a dream sequence, with Mack imagining a reconciliation between him and Mabel, (&quot;I Promise You A Happy Ending&quot; / &quot;I Won&#x27;t Send Roses (Reprise)&quot;).

==Critical response==
The Broadway reviews were only fair. Walter Kerr, in his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;I have rarely seen so much talent so dispirited as the creative souls peering through the gloom at the Majestic ... librettist Michael Stewart ... has chosen to lean on the myth of Mack and Mabel, let the mysteries stand, invented no emotional line.&quot; He wrote of Gower Champion, &quot;A choreographer ought to be able to do something with bodies. ... Mr. Champion doesn&#x27;t set about his task that way ... [he] has not only avoided dance as a means of intimating a difficult kind of comedy, he has been stingy and even sluggish with the footwork that does crop up to decorate the songs. ... Production values everywhere are minimal.&quot; He noted that &quot;Robert Preston&#x27;s personal dynamism isn&#x27;t diminished, it&#x27;s just restively lying in wait for the solid meat he could handle if only there were a good provider around&quot; and that &quot;Miss Peters ... is close to touching in her quiet reminder that what Mr. Preston started in 1911 may be over and done with in 1923.&quot;

According to Kenneth Bloom, &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; was &quot;The saddest failure of Jerry Herman&#x27;s career&quot;. It was a &quot;victim of its time, an era when rock musicals were preferred over traditional musical comedy scores. Deep at its core was a simple love story and an exceptionally appropriate score. The urge to turn what could have been a bittersweet drama into a huge musical comedy was fatal.&quot;

<doc id="917622" wikidata="Q4116115" url="?curid=917622" title="Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha">
<text>Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha (; 1873–1928) was an Egyptian political figure. Sarwat served as the Prime Minister of Egypt from 1 March 1922 until 30 November 1922, and again between 26 April 1927 and 16 March 1928. He was instrumental in bringing Great Britain to issue its Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence in February 1922, which ended the British Protectorate of Egypt and recognized it to be an Independent Sovereign State. He was also Minister of Justice (1914–1919), Minister of Interior (16 March 1921 – 24 December 1921), Minister of Foreign Affairs (7 June 1926 – 18 April 1927) as well as the first Egyptian Attorney General (1908–1912).

Sarwat was born in Cairo in 1873. His father was &quot;Roznamji Egypt&quot; (Minister of Finance, in today&#x27;s terms). He graduated with a &quot;License de droit&quot; from the Khedival School of Law in 1893 and spent the first 19 years of his career in the Ministry of Justice, following which he was appointed Minister of Justice (1914–1919). From 1918 and until his death, 10 years later, he became an important political figure in Egypt at a time when the country was struggling to obtain its full independence from Great Britain. He was close to a group of politicians who founded the Liberal Constitutional Party in October 1922, headed by Adly Yakan Pasha to whom Sarwat was very close. The party represented large land owners and the urban middle class. It had a gradualist approach to independence. The party was also joined by politicians who defected in 1921 from the Wafd, a movement formed in late 1918 to obtain the complete independence of Egypt from Great Britain and which was led by Saad Zaghloul Pasha, a popular charismatic leader who had the overwhelming support of the great majority of Egyptians.

In March 1919, soon after forming the Wafd, Saad was exiled to Malta by the British. This ignited the 1919 revolution. As a result, the British released Saad from exile, in April, and sent the Milner Mission to Egypt in December 1919 to study the situation. Saad and the Wafd were officially invited to London to negotiate (Saad-Milner negotiations). Adly joined the group. The negotiations (June – November 1920), broke down and highlighted a rift between Saad and Adly. This was a turning point for Saad. He became radicalized and relied mainly on popular support. Adly and Sarwat, both moderates, became the interlocutors of choice for the British in their future negotiations with Egypt.

Sarwat became minister of interior in a Adly Cabinet (March–December 1921) formed to follow-up on a British invitation to Egypt to enter official negotiations with Britain aiming at replacing the Protectorate with another relationship. Adly invited Saad to join him. Saad put unacceptable conditions to join and called for withdrawal of confidence in the Government. Several members of the Wafd, disagreeing with him, left the Wafd, confirming a split that was brewing. Sarwat was interim prime minister, while Adly was negotiating in London (Adly-Curzon negotiations, 1 July-5 December 1921), The negotiations failed and led to the resignation of Adly in December 1921. Sarwat put forward conditions which, upon their acceptance by Britain, he would be ready to form a cabinet. Despite Great Britain accepting these conditions, they were not enough for Saad and Adly. However, under pressure from Field Marshall Edmund Allenby, the British High Commissioner to Egypt, the British Government issued, on 28 February 1922, the Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence, which declared Egypt an independent country ending the British protectorate, with reserved points making this a partial independence only. Sarwat became, on 1 March 1922, the first prime minister of the new Kingdom of Egypt and appointed himself Minister of Foreign Affair and Minister of the Interior. He formed a Committee to draft a Constitution which he proposed to King Fouad I, but the King pressured him to resign nine months later, as he was unwilling to promulgate a constitution, which would have diminished his powers.

The Constitution was promulgated later and the first election under it was a landslide victory for Saad&#x27;s Wafd. Saad became prime minister in January 1924, but a crisis forced him to resign 10 months later and allowed the king to create a situation where, as of 18 March 1925, the country was ruled unconstitutionally. After 11 months of unconstitutional rule, the political parties convened a National Congress let by Saad, with Adly and Sarwat sitting beside him, which resulted in the return of constitution rule. Sarwat became Minister of Foreign Affair in a so-called coalition cabinet let by Adly (7 June 1926 – 18 April 1927). Following the resignation of Adly, Sarwat became prime Minister of a second coalition cabinet on 26 March 1927 and kept the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to himself. He diffused a major crisis between Egypt and Britain, the so-called Army crisis. He also entered into negotiations with Britain (Sarwat-Chamberlain negotiations) on the reserved points of the Declaration. While Sarwat was negotiating in London, Saad died in Egypt. His successor at the helm of the Wafd was a hardliner. The draft treaty brought back by Sarwat was rejected by both the Wafd and the Cabinet and he resigned on 16 March 1928. He died in Paris on 22 September 1928 at the age of 55.

== Early life and education (1873–1893) ==
Abdel Khalek Sarwat was born in Cairo on 31 March 1873. His family traces its origin to Anatolia (Asian part of today&#x27;s Turkey). His father, Ismail Abdel Khalek Pasha, was &quot;Roznamji&quot; Egypt (Minister of Finance, in today&#x27;s terms). Sarwat graduated from the Khedival School of Law, first of his class, in 1893 with a &quot;License de droit&quot;.

== Judicial career (1893–1919) ==
Sarwat started his career in 1893, at the age of 20. He spent his first 26 years in the Ministry of Justice, holding, among others, the positions of District Attorney, Judge and Attorney General. In 1914 he became Minister of Justice (5 April 1914 – 22 April 1919). Sir John Scott, the Judicial Advisor in the Ministry appointed young Sarwat as his secretary. The Judicial Advisor at that time was the representative of the British Government in the Egyptian Ministry of Justice who, as such, was more powerful than the Minister. This position, ingratiated Sarwat with the British, who came to appreciate his honesty and competence and gave him significant authority early in his career. According to Mohamed Hussein Heikal “The influence and confidence Sarwat was able to hold allowed him to stand in the Ministry of Justice as the main decision maker while still a young man of not even twenty-five”. During this period, he was appointed Secretary to the Judicial Audit Committee of the Ministry.

=== Attorney General (1908–1912) ===
In 1912, at the age of 39, Sarwat became, the first Egyptian to hold the position of Attorney General since the British occupation. He was recommended by Saad Zaghlul Pasha, who became later his political foe and who was, at that time, Minister of Justice (1906–1913). Saad&#x27;s recommendation was made despite objections from the Khedive, from the British and from his colleagues among ministers. The ministers’ objection was that Sarwat had been secretary to two (British) Judicial Advisors. As Attorney General, Sarwat became under pressure to prosecute the newspaper El Jarida, which was headed by Ahmed Lutfi El Sayed and which defended individual liberties and the supremacy of the Law.  Sarwat&#x27;s reaction to the pressure to prosecute was “No law justifies the prosecution they are demanding, yet their insistence on prosecution had them seek justification from laws which do not apply to Egypt, including Indian laws”.

=== Minister of Justice (1914–1919) ===
Sarwat was Minister of Justice (5 April 1914 – 22 April 1919) in the successive cabinets headed by Hussein Roshdi Pasha. As Minister, he introduced laws and amendments giving protections to the accused and introduced guidelines for appeals.

== Egypt&#x27;s road to the 1922 Declaration of Independence ==
Sarwat was instrumental in the events leading to the British Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence, a historical moment in modern Egypt. The road to the Declaration was long and tumultuous.

=== Background ===
At the beginning of World War I, the British Government unilaterally declared Egypt, which it was occupying since 1882, a British Protectorate (18 December 1914). By the end of the war, consequences of the war and the protectorate began to appear on both the Egyptian and British political scenes.

In Egypt, the Egyptian nationalist movement which has been growing among intellectuals before the war found a larger support among average Egyptians who suffered during the war from high inflation and from their forced recruitment into the Labor Corps (About half a million ). The nationalist movement also found support in US President Woodrow Wilson’s declaration on Self-determination. In Great Britain, the war made the Government more sensitive to the importance of Egypt as a strategic asset, but it also put financial strains on the Empire. Britain was now looking for an arrangement to control the Egypt at a lesser cost and a lower level of military commitments, while safeguarding its route to India and protecting the interests of foreigners living in the country.

Political developments during this period reflected the interaction between the major protagonists.  On the British side, Lloyd George, the British prime minister, had to consider his country&#x27;s political climate. He was assisted by his Foreign Secretary, Lord George Curzon, who would become the lead British negotiator with an Egyptian delegation. A no less important figure was Field Marshall Edmond Allenby, who was made Special High Commissioner of Egypt (based in Cairo) in 1919. Allenby had a crucial role in shaping the issues and convincing the British Government to unilaterally declare the independence of Egypt. On the Egyptian side, Saad Zaghlul Pasha, who was seen as the national populist leader, ultimately demanded the full independence of Egypt, including the evacuation of British troops. To serve this goal, he did not hesitate to use wide popular demonstrations. Adly Yakan Pasha and Sarwat Pasha, who initially supported Saad, were moderates and hence became in constant conflict with Saad. This situation reflected their different support bases: the large masses for Saad and the ruling class for Adly and Sarwat.

=== Creation of the Wafd and the 1919 Revolution ===
On 13 November 1918, two days after the First World War armistice was signed, Saad, who had held a prominent position in the Legislative Assembly before it was dissolved in 1914, and two others ex-members had a historical one-hour meeting with Sir Reginald Wingate, the British High Commissioner of Egypt. They first expressed their belief that they represented Egypt because of their previous membership in the legislative assembly. Saad then said: “When England will have helped us obtaining our complete independence, we will give her reasonable guarantees that no country will control our independence nor touch England&#x27;s interest. We will guarantee her [England&#x27;s] road to India, which is the Suez Canal, by giving her the exclusive right to occupy it [the Canal] when necessary. We will also ally with her [England] against third parties and give her, when necessary, what the alliance needs in terms of soldiers.” He also said: “We are talking about these demands here with you as a personification of this great nation [Britain] and we are addressing here [in Egypt] no one other than you and outside [of Egypt] no one other than England state&#x27;s men, and we ask you [...] to help up realize these demands”.

Saad historical meeting was organized with the prior knowledge of and in agreement with Prime Minister Roshdi, who met with Saad immediately after the meeting and met Wingate afterward, on the same day. Roshdi found the High Commissioner surprised that three people could talk in the name of a Nation. He reported this to Zaghlul and encouraged him to move forward with his project.

From then on, events unfolded quickly. On the same day, 13 November 1918, and after the meeting with Wingate, Saad met with a few supporters and &quot;Al-Wafd-Al-Masry&quot; (the Egyptian Delegation) (“Wafd”) was created with Saad as head plus six members. Its members approved its constitution, on 23 November 1918, which stated, among other things, that its mission was to seek the complete independence of Egypt using legal and peaceful means. The wafd then went on to collect powers of attorney from a diverse swath of the population, across the country, with the British opposing this initiative. It also enlarged it membership. On 20 November, Saad asked the British military authorities, as it was usually required, for permission for him and members of the Wafd to travel to Britain. On 1 December, he received a negative reply from the High Commissioner, after the later consulted his government.

From his side, Roshdi, requested, on 13 November, permission from the High Commissioner to travel to London, accompanied by Adly, his minister of Foreign Affairs, and Zaghloul, to discuss with the government of Britain the wishes of the Government of Egypt regarding Egypt&#x27;s future. While favorable to the travel of Roshdy and Adly, the High Commissioner was pressured by London to reply that it was not appropriate for Roshdy or Adly to travel at this time and that Zaghloul was not permitted to travel. Roshdi&#x27;s reaction was to submit the resignation of his cabinet to the Sultan the next day, 2 December 1918, giving as reason, the refusal of Britain to allow the Wafd to travel to Britain. The resignation was only accepted three months later, on 1 March 1919.

Following the resignation of Roshdi, Sarwat, who was Minister of Justice in the resigned cabinet, was offered to succeed him as prime minister with the hope that he would convince Saad to backtrack from his plan to represent Egypt in London. Sarwat declined the offer, despite being told that this would stand in the way of him ever becoming prime minister. Shortly after, the Wafd led by Saad, visited Sarwat at his home to congratulate him on his stance.

Soon after the November 13 meeting with Sir Wingate and the formation of the Wafd, Saad initiated public protests, and, after he was refused to travel, expressed his protests to plenipotentiaries of Foreign countries in Egypt about the British Government&#x27;s policy, thus breaking his promise to the High Commissioner to talk to Britain only. He also sent three cables to US President Wilson. “The Wafd activities were now considered by the British authorities as dangerous to public security”.   On 6 March, he was given an ultimatum by the Head of British Forces in Egypt and, on 8 March, he and three of his associates were arrested by the British authorities in Cairo and exiled to Malta.

What became known as the 1919 revolution started effectively the next day, on 9 March 1919. It was a major development in the history of Modern Egypt which none of the protagonists could ignore. The revolution was a series of revolts, spanning the whole country, which extended from 9 March 1919 until about the end of the year. It was bloody, (according the British there were 1000 dead by 15 May) and caused important destructions and disruptions. The revolution would affect Egypt&#x27;s political evolution for the next decade.

An immediate consequence of the revolution was that Field Marshal Edmond Allenby, the newly appointed (on 21 March) High Commissioner freed Saad from exile and, on 7 April, allowed all Egyptians, including Saad&#x27;s Wafd, to travel. Saad did not return to Egypt (he was not to return for another two years), but traveled to Paris, where he was joined, on 19 April, by members of the Wafd after they were allowed to travel. He was unable to achieve much at the Paris Peace Conference, as US President Wilson recognized the British protectorate of Egypt and the US-German Peace Treaty had been published. The latter transferred the powers of Turkey over Egypt to Britain, forcing the acceptance by Germany of the British protectorate of Egypt. The Wafd, which until then was focusing on getting international recognition of the Independence of Egypt, from then on reoriented its actions exclusively to the inside of Egypt.

=== The Milner Mission ===
Another consequence of the 1919 Revolution was the announcement on 15 May 1919, by the British Government, that a mission would travel to Egypt “To enquire into the causes of the late disorder in Egypt and to report on [...] the form of the Constitution which, under the Protectorate, will be best calculated to promote its peace and prosperity, [...]”. The Milner Mission, headed by Colonial Secretary Alfred Milner, spent about three months in Egypt (7 December 1919 – 18 March 1920). The arrival of Mission was immediately boycotted by a large portion of Egyptians, including the Wafd, on the basis that keeping the protectorate was not acceptable.

On 29 December 1919, three weeks after its arrival, the Mission backtracked and issued a declaration stating “The Mission has been sent out by the British Government, with the approval of Parliament, to reconcile the aspiration of the Egyptian people with the special interests which Britain has in Egypt and with a maintenance of the legitimate rights of all foreign residents in the country”. A version that overlooked the protectorate status mentioned in its terms of reference. This declaration resulted, from the boycott of the Mission by a majority of Egyptians and helped the trio of ex-ministers Adly, Rushdi and Sarwat who indicated to the Mission the necessity of agreeing with the Wafd. Saad, who was in Paris, was pleased with the nature of these communications as per a letter date 27 January 1920. Following the Mission&#x27;s latest declaration, the trio expressed their support of it. Sarwat made a statement to a newspaper indicating that “We consider that the Declaration of Lord Milner opened to us a door that was closed until now. [...] the declaration of Lord Milner is fair when it stated clearly that the negotiations will be without restrictions. [...] Entering into negotiation with the Mission cannot be interpreted under any circumstance as a concession to the Nation&#x27;s demand and Lord Milner&#x27;s declaration regarding this point is clear.” The Wafd Central Committee did not endorse the trio&#x27;s views and demanded in advance of any negotiation, the &quot;“recognition of the complete independence of Egypt”.&quot; Saad, who was in Paris, would not insist on the precondition.

This was followed by multiple discussions between three parties: Lord Millner, the Wafd Central Committee and the trio of ex-ministers. Two recommendations were sent to Saad in Paris: one by the trio of ex-ministers urging Saad to come back to Egypt to negotiate with the Mission and a contrary one by the Wafd Central Committee. Despite further mediation by Adly, Saad decided not to return to Egypt. &quot; &quot;Lord Milner realizing that his mission would not succeed unless Saad represented Egypt, invited Saad to London. Adly joined Saad in Paris on 22 April to discuss. In May and after many deliberations, the Milner Mission invited the Wafd for negotiations in London (as opposed to an invitation to Saad alone to discuss with Milner). Adly accompanied the delegation.

The negotiations between the Wafd and the Milner Mission in London (Saad-Milner negotiations) lasted about five months (June – November 1920). A British proposal was made and did not explicitly mention the end of the protectorate. Saad made a counterproposal, which explicitly mentioned the end of the protectorate. This fundamental disagreement almost ended the negotiation, except for the intervention of Adly. The latter continued the negotiations without Saad for three weeks starting 25 July 1920, resulting in a final take-all-or-leave British proposal presented to Saad on 10 August. It which included the British recognition of the independence of Egypt as a constitutional monarchy with representative institutions. It allowed the presence of British troops in Egypt, but not as an occupying force. It did not explicitly mention the end of the protectorate and also removed some of the benefits to Egypt included in the first proposal. Saad was not pleased with the proposal, but seeing a division in the Wafd, with Adly and his supporters favorable to the final proposal, he would not reject it and opted to send it to the Egyptian people for consultation. Saad wrote to the Nation a neutral letter about the proposal, when, in reality, he was unhappy about it as he indicated in a letter to three members of the Wafd “it is (between you and me) a proposal which in appearance accepts the independence, but in reality, confirms the protectorate”. While “the members of the Wafd [who travelled from London back to Egypt], as a group, where not only interpreters of the rules of the proposal but proponents and supporters of it”, the general feedback from the one-month consultation of the Egyptian people was that there were reservations on the proposal, some of which were tantamount to refusing the proposal. The negotiations resumed in London in October. The Wafd expressed on 25 October 1920 to Lord Milner seven reservations it had about the proposal, the first and most important demanded the end of the protectorate. After lengthy deliberations at the House of Lords, Milner met with Saad on 9 November 1920 to inform him that no more compromises were possible. The negotiations were interrupted on that day and the Wafd left London for Paris the next day.

In Paris, the rift within the Wafd (Saad/Adly) gained momentum and became known, but was kept under the lid. The Adly camp, to which Sarwat belonged, wanted to continue the negotiations, while Saad thought it was time to go back to Cairo and focus the wafd on organizing the Nation&#x27;s revolution. This became a turning point for Saad, who until then was moderate in his views and actions. The breakdown of the Milner negotiations made him lose hope in negotiation as a mean to help the Egyptian cause. His only option now was to rely on his popularity to lead the National movement.

Lord Milner presented his mission&#x27;s report to His Majesty&#x27;s Government on 9 December 1920 in which it stated that “the time is appropriate to establish relations between Great Britain and Egypt on the basis of a permanent treaty, which is a treaty that gives Egypt its independence”. The report was released on 18 February 1921.

=== Split within the Wafd ===
On 26 February 1921, the British Government (Cabinet of Lloyd George) advised Fouad I, the Sultan of Egypt that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government, after a study of the proposals made by Lord Milner, have arrived at the conclusion that the status of protectorate is not a satisfactory relation in which Egypt should continue to stand to Great Britain” and invited Egypt to enter into official negotiations to replace the Protectorate by another relationship. This was the most important communication made by the British Government since its declaration of the protectorate in 1914. The Sultan directed Adly to form a cabinet (his first) on 17 March 1921, with the purpose of entering into these negotiations. Sarwat was appointed Minister of the Interior.

Saad was still in Paris having not yet returned to Egypt since his release, two years earlier, from his one-month exile. Adly invited him to join a delegation to be formed to negotiate with Britain. From Paris, Saad laid down four conditions for his participation. Adly found unacceptable the condition that Wafd should nominate the majority of the delegation&#x27;s members and head the delegation. Saad returned to Egypt on 5 April 1921, in the middle of an effusion of popular support. On 25 April 1921, Adly made public, in a newspaper, his refusal of Saad&#x27;s conditions. On the same day, Saad made public his insistence on leading the delegation in a speech in which he announced his non-confidence in the cabinet. Three days later, in a meeting with the Wafd&#x27;s members, Saad insisted that the Wafd, despite its majority dissenting, withdraws its confidence in the cabinet. As a result, a group of members of Saad&#x27;s Wafd Party split from the party. The split in the Wafd was now totally consumed. Chaos and violence erupted in the country: On 20 May, two police stations were burned and 58 people were killed in Alexandria, among them 15 Europeans. The British military authorities had to take over the administration of the city.

=== Sarwat Minister of Interior (1921) ===
On 1 July 1921, an official delegation headed by Prime Minister Adly, left for London (without Saad) to conduct negotiations with Lord George Curzon (Adly-Curzon negotiations), the British Foreign Secretary in the Cabinet of Lloyd George. The negotiations lasted several months, during which Sarwat was interim prime minister, in addition to being Minister of the Interior. While the early severe disturbances in Alexandria happened under his watch, he was effective in maintaining order during the Adly-Curzon negotiations and succeeded in preventing disturbances from derailing the negotiations.

He tried unsuccessfully to prevent Saad from touring the country to criticize Adly and the British Government. When he heard that four Labour Party (opposition party) members of the British House of Common were planning to visit Egypt and accompany Saad on part of his tour of the country, Sarwat “besought the High Commissioner to prevent it”, but to no avail. He also sought the help of the British Military authority to act based on the prevailing Martial law in another situation against the President of the National Party.

=== Adly-Curzon negotiations ===
On 10 November 1921, Curzon presented to Adly a draft treaty. Adly replied in a November 15 memorandum stating that the project did not hold a hope for reaching an agreement. He left London and arrived in Alexandria on 5 December. In fact, “The negotiations had broken down chiefly on two points: the maintenance of a British garrison in Egypt and the control of Egyptian Foreign Affairs”

The British authorities in Egypt, had also their point of view on the negotiations. First, the British Advisors in Egypt wrote, on 17 November, a common memorandum asserting that “any decision which does not accept the principle of independence and keeps the protectorate will inevitably lead to a real danger of a revolution starting in the whole country”. Allenby forwarded the memorandum to Lord Curzon with his support. Second, as Adly arrived in Cairo on 6 November 1921, Allenby asked Curzon, through a despatch “if he could advise the Sultan that his Majesty&#x27;s Government was ready to execute [...] the main proposals [...] included in the proposed treaty and to extend to him these suggestions as a program for a new Government, or for the current one if it stayed in place? I fully realize that the work I am pointing to may force his Majesty&#x27;s Government to end the Protectorate with a unilateral declaration”, a precursor to the upcoming unilateral declaration.

=== Resignation of Adly and exile of Zaghlul ===
Prime Minister Adly resigned on 8 December, three days after his arrival in Cairo. Sultan Fouad did not accept his resignation and asked him to stay on until a new cabinet was formed. The failure of the Adly mission led to riots across the country. The day before Adly resigned, Saad called on the country to continue fighting. In reaction to Saad&#x27;s continued activism, the British military authority warned him, on 22 December, not to hold public meetings or write in the press and ordered him to leave Cairo and stay in the countryside. Saad responded on the same day by a speech in which he said &quot;“the force can do with us whatever it wishes”.&quot; The next day, Allenby arrested Saad and froze his and his party&#x27;s bank accounts, as well as those of prominent members of his party. On the same day, Adly, not wanting to be held responsible for the arrest of Saad, asked the Sultan to accept the resignation he submitted two weeks earlier. It was accepted the next day, 24 December 1921. A few days later, the British authorities decided to exile Saad (for the second time) and five of his colleagues to the Seychelles islands. They left Egypt on 29 December 1921.

Saad&#x27;s exile resulted in the reunification of his previously split Wafd and the organization of a campaign to boycott and to not cooperate with British persons and British interests in Egypt. A wave of violence and assassinations erupted throughout the country.

=== Sarwat&#x27;s conditions to form a cabinet ===
Subsequent to Adly&#x27;s resignation, Sarwat announced, on 11 December, that he would be ready to form a cabinet if eleven conditions, which he made public, were accepted by Britain. They included that the British Protectorate be abolished, the sovereign independence of Egypt recognized and the Ministry of Foreign affair reconstituted. The Wafd criticized these conditions as they did not include the evacuation of British forces from Egypt. Despite Great Britain accepting his conditions on 15 December, Sarwat, could not form a cabinet as he was unable to secure the support of Adly, who asserted that the demanded concessions “did not go far enough”.

In his endeavor, Sarwat had the full support of Allenby, the British High commissioner, who was pushing to obtain from his Government firm concessions. On 12 January 1922, Allenby sent Curzon, the Foreign Secretary, the draft of a letter he recommended to be sent to the Sultan of Egypt “to announce that His Majesty&#x27;s Government were prepared without waiting for a treaty to abolish the Protectorate and recognize Egyptian sovereign independence: that they would &quot;view with favor&quot; the creation of a parliament with the right to control the &quot;policy and administration of a constitutionally responsible government”.&quot; The despatch, which accompanied the proposed letter indicated that “the proposed letter is the result of extensive negotiations with Sarwat Pasha and his immediate adherents. They, on their part, have been in contact with a wider circle, and Adly Pasha has been in close touch, and has lent valuable and disinterested assistance” Not getting a prompt response, Allenby sent Curzon, two weeks later, a despatch which included a resignation threat: “if the advice I have offered is rejected, I cannot honorably remain. I therefore beg that my resignation may be tendered to His Majesty with expression of my humble duty.” He was called back to London to explain his position to Curzon and left Cairo on 3 February, accompanied by two of his advisors. In London, with his possible resignation still looming, he was able to obtain the support of Prime Minister Lloyd George despite the opposition of Curzon, the Foreign Office Secretary. On 17 February, the Cabinet approved the end of the protectorate.

Eleven days later, Allenby arrived in Cairo with, in hand, the British Declaration of Egyptian Independence, which became known as the Declaration of 28 February 1922.

=== The Declaration of Independence ===
On 28 February 1922, the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Lord Allenby made public the following Declaration:

“Whereas His Majesty&#x27;s Government, in accordance with their declared intentions, desire forthwith to recognize Egypt as an independent sovereign state; and whereas the relations between His Majesty&#x27;s Government and Egypt are of vital interest to the British Empire; the following principles are hereby declared:

# The British Protectorate over Egypt is terminated, and Egypt is declared to be an independent Sovereign State.
# So soon as the Government of His Highness shall pass an act of indemnity with application to all inhabitants of Egypt, Martial Law as proclaimed on the 2nd of November 1914 shall be withdrawn.
# The following matters are absolutely reserved to the discretion of His Majesty&#x27;s Government until such time as it may be possible by free discussion and friendly accommodation on both sides to conclude agreements in regards thereto between His Majesty&#x27;s Government and the Government of Egypt:
#* The security and communications of the British empire in Egypt.
#* The defense of Egypt against all foreign aggression or interference direct or indirect.
#* The protection of Foreign interest in Egypt and the protection of minorities.
#* The Sudan.

Pending the conclusion of such agreements the status quo in all these matters shall remain intact.”

The four matters reserved in the declaration became the expression of past and future political divergence within Egypt. For the Wafd the four matters reflected the ill will of the British Government that handed Egypt an independence that was one only on paper. For the politicians who will become members of the Liberal Constitutional Party and their supporters, it was a step in the right direction.

For the next fifteen years or so, seeking an agreement as per point 3 of the declaration was the main objective of both the Wafd and the LCP, each going about it according to its own political beliefs.

== First Sarwat cabinet (1922) ==
On 1 March 1922, Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha was asked by the Sultan to form a cabinet. In his acceptance letter, submitted on the same day, Sarwat laid out the program of his Cabinet: the preparation of a draft Constitution based on the principles of the General Law, which will assert the accountability of the Government to a representative body, the end of martial law, elections which are to be held in normal circumstances and the reinstatement of a Ministry of Foreign Affair, which will establish political and consular representation of Egypt abroad. He also listed the name of the eight ministers of his cabinet, keeping to himself the ministries of interior and Foreign Affairs.

Two weeks later, on 15 March 1922, the Sultan officially proclaimed the independence of Egypt and assumed the title &quot;“His Majesty, the King of Egypt”.&quot; The Cabinet re-created the ministry of Foreign affairs, which was abolished during the protectorate (1914–1922), canceled the official holidays on the birthday of the King of Britain and on his Coronation Day. The position of Adviser to the Minister of Interior, held by a British, was abolished and the British Financial Advisor ceased to attend Cabinet meetings. Egyptian Deputy Ministers were appointed to replace the British ones.

The announcement of Egypt&#x27;s independence was not well received by its people. “The announcement aroused no popular enthusiasm and the Zaghloolists attitude was everywhere of sullen dissatisfaction and hostility. [...]. The proclamation of independence was accompanied by disorderly demonstrations in large towns”.

=== Committee on the Constitution ===
On 3 April 1922, the Cabinet created a Committee to draft a constitution and an election law. It was headed by Rushdy Pasha and had thirty members, excluding the chairman and the vice chairman, and was hence called the “Committee of the Thirty”. Its members were thinkers, men of the law, scientists, religious officials, moderate politicians, landowners, merchants and financiers. The Wafd was invited to nominate two or three members but refused the invitation. It gave two reasons for its refusal: first, the number of members offered to the Wafd was too small and, second, he demanded that an elected constituent Assembly rather than a committee write the constitution. The Committee was nicknamed “Committee of the Naughties” by its opponents.

Defenders of the constituent Assembly idea used, as one of their argument, the promise made in the program of Adly&#x27;s Cabinet, formed in 1921, that drafting of a constitution was to be assigned to a national constituent Assembly. Sarwat was a member of this Cabinet. The partial answer to their argument, made by Sarwat in his speech to the Committee on the Constitution, on 11 April 1922, is a good illustration of the political climate of the times. Sarwat explained that the purpose of the constituent Assembly mentioned in the program of Adly&#x27;s cabinet was but primarily to review any treaty with Britain and, then, draft a constitution. Now the situation was reversed. Drafting a constitution preceded any eventual treaty with Britain (the declaration of independence being unilateral and not a treaty). He then said, referring to the Wafd: “There are individuals who have been working for a while on promoting bad faith towards the Government, on minimizing the importance of where the country has arrived at and on seeding doubt about what we are about to encounter, so that if a national constituent Assembly met, it would be engulfed in these views and tendencies and its work would revert to opposition, obsessions and abeyance leading to evil consequences for the country. This, in spite of the country having obtained an important gain from the Declaration of Independence and its recognition by other countries. Save that the Egyptian question has not been settled yet, as there are still ahead of us negotiations which must enable Egypt to arrive at its full potential ...”.

Two views soon appeared within the committee; one willing to give the King enough rights to control partisan excesses and the other defending the principle that the people are the source of all powers. Rushdy, the chairman, who was close to Sarwat, tried to find a middle solution. While he was, like Sarwat, a defender of a representative democracy, he was also much aware that removing too many powers from the King would doom the exercise to failure. The King, who never liked the idea of Egypt becoming a constitutional monarchy, put pressure on Sarwat to refrain from including clauses that would diminish his powers. Sarwat, who had a strong personality, and was not such a person as to be led by the King did not accommodate all his demands&quot;.&quot; In addition, “The King had never been on friendly terms with Sarwat Pasha, who was not the Prime Minister of his choice&quot;”.&quot; By the end of July 1922, the relationship between them had soured to the point that “the High Commissioner [Lord Allenby] intervened to insist on a rapprochement with Sarwat”.

Sensing that the King was planning to remove him, Sarwat pressured the committee to finish its work. On 31 October 1922, the Committee presented to Prime Minister Sarwat a draft Constitution and a draft Election Law. Sarwat sent the draft constitution, for promulgation, to the King who was not keen to do that&quot;.&quot;

=== Assassinations and Government reaction ===
From the day the Sarwat cabinet was formed, Egypt found itself in the midst of a wave of assassinations which lasted several months and presented serious problems to the Government. There were many reasons for this instability. The Wafd was against the Declaration of Independence, the population also disliked it and Saad was in exile when all of this happened. Importantly, Sarwat was never popular, as he represented the ruling class and, as a matter of temperament, was not the type to seek popularity from the masses. There was even an assassination attempt against him planned for January 26, 1922, following rumors that he would be appointed prime minister. Seven plotters were arrested and tried by a British military tribunal. Three of them were sentenced to between two- and three-year prison terms.

Starting March 1922, following the appointment of the Sarwat Cabinet, there were seven assassinations attempts in a short period of time, which resulted in the death or serious injuries of British Employees in the Egyptian government. The perpetrators were not found. These unpunished assassinations led the British Government to officially object, through its High Commissioner to the Government of Egypt, “considering it responsible for these attacks and reserving the right to assess the suitability of the amount of compensation to be paid by the Government” Nevertheless, the assassination attempts continued until at least August 1922, despite a second strong letter sent by Allenby on July 20. It is worth mentioning that “On July 24 the Wafd made a false move in publishing a manifesto which directly counselled violence against the Ministry, and its supporters the British. Lord Allenby at once ordered the arrest of the signatories of this manifesto”. Saad was still in exile at that time.

In response to the numerous assassinations and to the British objections, Sarwat, who was Minister of the Interior in his own Cabinet, took a number of repressive measures. He prohibited anti-government political meetings, permanently closed two newspapers, temporary stopped the publication of two others and instructed newspapers not to mention the name of Saad or his exiled associates in their articles or news. These measures were unpopular and what made it worse for him was the arrest and imprisonment, on 25 July 1922, of seven members of the Wafd by the British military authority and their appearance in front a British military court under the accusation of printing and distributing leaflets inciting hate of the Government of His Majesty the King of Egypt. Their death sentence was commuted to seven years prison terms and large fines. They were released in May 1923. The seven-year sentences for inciting hate were not coherent with the three years sentences for the attempted murder on Sarwat a few months earlier.

=== Creation of the Liberal Constitutional Party ===
The Liberal Constitutional Party (&quot;LCP&quot;), was founded in October 1922, when Sarwat was still prime minister.The party included members of the Wafd, who had split from it in April 1921, as well as a majority of Saad&#x27;s opponents. Adly, its founding president, announced in his speech to the party&#x27;s first general assembly on 30 October 1922 that “Only the constitutional system is the proper way of governing a nation civilized like ours”. Some thought that Prime Minister Sarwat, should join the Party so that the Cabinet could be an LCP cabinet, but Sarwat was not a founder of the LCP and never jointed it. Nevertheless, the Sarwat government gave full backing and logistical support to its creation.

To better understand the roots of the LCP, we must remember that at the beginning of its formation, the Wafd movement was moderate in its approach and actions [see above, meeting of 13 November 1918 between Saad and Lord Wingate]. This was natural, given that most of its members were from the pre-war moderate Umma Party. Disagreements came gradually among the Wafd members, and culminated in five of its seven founding members quitting it on 26 April 1921 [see above]. Certain authors think that the division within the Wafd was not due to essential disagreements about objectives or methods (moderate or populist), but rather to the absence of trust between its members and the authoritarian personality of its leader, Saad. At its origin, the Wafd was a moderate movement, even members who split from it were moderates and remained so in their political actions after they left it. It is only natural to find that the Liberal Constitutional Party they formed in October 1922 was a moderate party working within the framework set by the Declaration of Independence, which they helped bring about and which the Wafd opposed. Given the popularity of the Wafd, it is no surprise to find that the LCP did not enjoy popular support.

The approaching elections, which were to follow the promulgation of the Constitution certainly can explain why the Liberal Constitutional Party was founded in October 1922. Nevertheless, the precise timing was mainly driven by its founders anticipating the King&#x27;s removal of Sarwat, one of their supporters. They wanted to make a move before a party loyal to the King was created, which was rumored at the time.

=== Rapprochement between the Wafd and the Palace ===
As relations between the King and Sarwat deteriorated because of their diverging views on the constitution, a rapprochement between the Palace and the Wafd against the Sarwat Cabinet was taking shape. The rapprochement was driven by Mohamed Tawfik Nessim Pasha, the Head of the Royal Office, who was supported by previous ministers and friends unhappy about the Rushdi, Adly, Sarwat trio taking over the political stage. The Wafd, on the other hand, hoped that a Cabinet led by Nessim and supported by the King would free Saad from exile. In an interview from his exile to Reuters, Saad asserted his loyalty to the King and vowed to serve Nation and King. This became the moto of the Wafd. Subsequently, the King met the interim President of the Wafd who then and issued an unusually aggressive communiqué against the Sarwat Cabinet.

=== Resignation of the Sarwat cabinet ===
The King, who liked neither Sarwat nor a constitution limiting his powers, plotted to remove Sarwat. He used his recent rapprochement with the Wafd, the issue of the Sudan clauses and a security situation he orchestrated, that would have brought heavy criticism on the Government, to corner Sarwat into resigning.

The Wafd and the Palace, each for its own reasons, supported the inclusion of two Sudan clauses in the constitution. The inclusion of the clauses was opposed by the British and “Sarwat Pasha quite saw the reasonableness of the British contention that reference to the Sudan would be entirely out of place in the Egyptian Constitution-on the other hand, if he acquiesced he stood to be shot by the Palace, by the Zaghlulists [the Wafd], and very likely, as he surmised, by his own political friends”. In fact, it was the last part that tilted the balance. The king had adroitly exploited his own rapprochement with the Wafd which make him appear a nationalist. “Adly Pasha of course realized that references to the Sudan could not be justified, but he was fighting the Zaghlulists and could not afford to give them the right to call him a traitor to his country. [...]. In the end, he took action, which proved Sarwat right, and announced if the Prime minister met British wishes in the matter of the Sudan his party would no longer support him.”

The final act came from two schemes organized by the King. In the first, a rumor, known to the King as false, alleged that when Sarwat was in Europe, he contacted the ex-Khedive Abbas Helmi, an enemy of the King. This was taken as an opportunity by the King to tell Sarwat that he did not want him as prime minister anymore. In the second scheme, the king announced that he intended to do his Friday (30 November 1922) prayer at Al-Azhar Mosque, accompanied by his ministers. The Palace coordinated with the Wafd and the Azharites to organize a riot, where Government Ministers would be physically attacked after the King left the mosque, leaving the government in a bad optical situation. Sarwat having learned about this scheme the previous day, resigned on the afternoon of 29 November 1922. The King accepted his resignation within half an hour and appointed Nessim Pasha as prime minister.

== Egypt between the two Sarwat cabinets (1922–1927) ==

=== Battle for the Constitution ===
The Nessim Cabinet was formed without a program and applied himself to changing the draft constitution to suit the King&#x27;s interest. These changes included the removal of an article stating that the people are the source of powers. Half of the Senate was now to be appointed by the King. The president of the Senate was to be appointed by the King, rather than jointly by King and Cabinet. In addition, it gave the King the power to dissolve the two chambers. Furthermore, and after Britain pressured the King, the Nessim Cabinet agreed to remove the two Sudan clauses. These changes to the original draft prepared by the Committee of the thirty, were kept secret during the Nessim Cabinet. The cabinet resigned on 5 February 1923, having lasted 68 days.

After a failed attempt to get Adly to form a new cabinet, one was formed more than a month later, on 15 March 1923, by Yehia Ibrahim Pasha, the Chief Judge and who had also been a member in the Nessim cabinet. It was an administrative cabinet without a program. As the Ibrahim Government started to look at the constitution, the previous changes prepared by Nessim started to leak. Many objections were then voiced, among which were objections from the Committee of the Thirty, which had worked on the original draft proposed by Sarwat to the King a few months earlier. The Liberal Constitutional Party, with its some if its founders being members of the Committee of the Thirty, became one of the few supporters of the return to the original version of the constitution drafted by that committee. As for the Wafd, it found itself in a difficult position, unwilling to accept the Nessim version, but unable politically to agree with the Committee of the Thirty, which it opposed at the time. &quot;(Ramdan 1, p.391).&quot; Prime Minister Ibrahim proposed the formation of a constituent assembly to redraft the constitution. This was not politically possible and the Constitution was promulgated on 19 April 1923 “according to the draft prepared by the Committee on the Constitution with the two clauses related to the Sudan deleted”. The Ibrahim Cabinet resigned on the same day, having governed for a month and half only. Eleven days later, on 30 April 1923, the Elections Law was enacted.

=== Saad Zaghlul cabinet ===
On 31 March 1923, almost there weeks before the constitution was enacted, the British Foreign Office announced the release of Saad from exile, for health reasons. He travelled to France, where he remained for more than six months. On 17 September 1923, Saad returned to Egypt after an absence of more than twenty months.

With the constitution and the Elections Law enacted, the electoral campaign started without Saad and lasted about nine months until election day, on 12 January 1924. The election was a sweep for the Wafd, which garnered 90% of the Chamber of Deputies’ seats. The King asked Saad, the head of the winning party, to form a Cabinet. Saad became, on 28 January 1924 the first Prime Minister of Egypt under its Constitution.

Soon after Saad became prime minister, in January 1924, he accepted the invitation of Ramsay MacDonald to negotiate with Britain. MacDonald had become Prime Minister of a minority Labor Government in Britain earlier on the same month Saad formed his Cabinet. These short negotiations (September–October 1924) broke down, weakening Saad&#x27;s political position in Egypt. The King exploited this weakness and tried to dislodge Saad. The latter played a better hand and resigned on 15 November 1924. He then rescinded his resignation after reaching at an agreement with the King who was under heavy pressure from popular demonstrations supporting Saad.

On 19 November 1924, two days after Saad rescinded his resignation, an event occurred, which was to have important consequences for the political and constitutional life in Egypt. Major-General Sir Lee Stack, the British Commander-in-Chief of the Anglo-Egyptian army (the Sirdar) and Governor-General of the Sudan was assassinated in Cairo. This event resulted in the British government announcing a set of demands in two “warnings” to the Egyptian Government. These demands were expectedly unacceptable to Prime Minister Saad who resigned again on 23 November 1924.
=== Unconstitutional Rule ===
On the day Saad resigned, the King appointed Ahmed Zeiwar Pasha as prime minister. Zeiwar moved quickly. Within a week, he accepted the British demands made following the assassination of Sir Lee Stack. He also requested the King to suspend the Chamber of Deputies for 30 days. One day before the end of the suspension period and for no good reason, Zeiwar requested that the King dissolve it. The Chamber was dissolved on 24 December 1924, with 6 March 1925 set as the date for the new Chamber to convene.

The Wafd won the elections 116-87 but, despite these results, Zeiwar announced falsely on 13 March 1925 that non-Wafd parties had won the election. He proceeded with a mere reshuffle of the Cabinet. On 23 March 1925, during its inaugural session, the new Chamber of Deputies elected Saad as its president by 123 votes against 85 votes for Sarwat. On that evening, Prime Minister Zeiwar resigned. The King refused the resignation. Furthermore, on the recommendation of Zeiwar, he dissolved the Chamber and called for new elections. On 26 March, three days later, again on the recommendation of Zeiwar, the King cancelled the election. The excuse was that the current Election Law needed to be changed as it was not ensuring proper representation. The country was now governed unconstitutionally.

The second half of 1925 saw the country moving from one political crisis to another. The Wafd, whose political power was based on being the most popular party, found its influence diminished, now that political life was paralyzed. As a result, some of its members sought a reconciliation with the Liberal Constitutional Party. An attempt by the deputies to meet in the chamber on 21 November 1925 was thwarted by the King. Instead, the meeting was moved to the Continental Hotel. This signaled the official start of a reconciliation among the parties. A coalition of parties was formalized in January 1926 by the creation of the executive committee for the Coalesced Parties.

From there on, events moved fast. The coalesced Parties announced the boycott of the elections and called for a National Congress to meet. A Congress of over 1,000 persons met on 19 February 1926. Saad led the Congress and sat at the podium with Adly and Sarwat on his sides (see picture). After a hot debate, the Congress called for, among other things, direct elections to be held according to the 1924 law. The Government, under pressure from the British, obtained from the King to call an election. This ended the constitutional crisis.

=== Return of Constitutional Rule ===
The elections were called for 22 May 1926. The Coalesced Parties agreed publicly in advance to guarantee 160 seats to the Wafd Party and 45 to the Liberal Constitutional Party. The expected results of the elections forced the Cabinet to announce its pending resignation, opening the door for a Wafd Cabinet headed by Saad.
The British who had a historical animosity against Saad tried by all means, including the threat of a military show of force, to prevent him from forming a cabinet. Saad, alleging health reasons, announced that he was not forming a cabinet. Instead, he agreed with Adly and Sarwat that Adly should head the Cabinet, which would include Wafdists and Liberal Constitutionalists. He announce it at a banquet given in his honor at the Continental Hotel (see right picture).

On 7 June 1926, the King asked Adly to form a cabinet (see left picture). This Cabinet was the first of two so called Coalition Cabinets (somewhat of a misnomer, since Wafd had won the majority in the Chamber of Deputies. Saad was reluctant to call it a coalition Cabinet). Sarwat was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. Three day later Saad was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies The focus of this cabinet was to consolidate constitutional rule, address internal issues and avoid confrontation with the British. Its purpose was to clear the way to start new negotiations with the British, as Sarwat indicated to the Chamber of Deputies.

On 18 April 1927, using as excuse a debate on a trivial matter in Parliament, Prime Minister Adly abruptly announced the resignation of his cabinet. The real reason, though, was the mounting pressure from Wafd extremists pushing towards policies (specifically related to the Army) that were too extreme for him. Saad tried unsuccessfully to change Adly&#x27;s mind. “So little were they [Zaghlul and the moderate Wafdists] inclined for internecine strife that they put forward Sarwat Pasha as an acceptable Prime Minister, and even agreed to the conditions which he laid down as essential to him”.

== Second Sarwat cabinet (1927–1928) ==
The King called on Sarwat to form a Cabinet on 26 April 1927. In it, Sarwat kept to himself the Ministry of the Interior. This Cabinet found itself dealing with two unexpected issues: the so-called Army Crisis, which descended on the Cabinet less than a month after it was formed and the Sarwat-Chamberlain negotiations on the relations between Egypt and Britain, which started unexpectedly.

=== The army crisis ===
A month after he became prime minister, Sarwat found himself dealing with an acute crisis between Egypt and Britain, the Army Crisis.

This crisis had its roots back to the 1924 assassination of the Sirdar and, more fundamentally, to the importance for Britain to keep the Egyptian Army under its control, ensuring Egypt as a safe passage to India. Focusing on the crisis, the 1927–28 budget was an opportunity for some Wafd deputies to propose, through a subcommittee of the Army Committee, measures to enhance the resources of the Army while reducing British oversight of it. According to the British, “...  we were faced with the prospect of an Egyptian Army, much increased in strength, and not only removed from any possibility of control by us, but saturated as the result of intensive propaganda with the political influence of an extreme political party [meaning the wafd]”. It was generally true that the Army supported the Wafd. For the British, this move from some of the Wafd Deputies crossed a red line. The British High Commissioner, Lord Lloyd tried to convince Sarwat of Britain&#x27;s point of view. In response, Sarwat sent him a note on 24 May 1926 indicating that, from a legal point of view, the position of the Government of Egypt was that Army matters do not fall under the reserved points of the Declaration of 28 February 1922 and that Egypt is free to make decisions about it.

The British answer was swift. On 31 May 1926, Lloyd “handed to Sarwat Pasha an official note embodying the views and demands of His Majesty&#x27;s Government”. There were six demands. These would have resulted in thwarting the initiative proposed to the sub-committee of the Chamber of deputies. Waiting for Sarwat&#x27;s reply, Lloyd, as he later explained, “... was compelled in view of the possibility of disturbance to request the despatch of a warship to Alexandria as a precautionary measure. That the arrival of this ship might be regarded as a threat was an inevitable conclusion, but I was not prepared to risk lives”. Sarwat&#x27;s reply came on 3 June stating his understanding of British preoccupations. He agreed to only one of the six demands, while not explicitly rejecting the other five. Amid a disagreement between the British Foreign Office and the High Commissioner on how to respond to Sarwat, Lloyd tried further to pressure Sarwat and Saad. In response, on 11 June, Sarwat proposed a solution: Lloyd would ask him for further clarifications on his note, to which Sarwat would provide a reply that would be accepted by Lloyd. This ended the crisis.

=== Sarwat-Chamberlain negotiations ===
In July 1927, Sarwat found himself unexpectedly negotiating with the British. Following the resolution of the Army crisis, Sarwat was politically in a stronger position and the British Foreign office wanted to take this opportunity to negotiate a treaty with a moderate Egyptian Government, which would safeguard British interests.

The opportunity arose when Prime Minister Sarwat accompanied the King on his official visit to Britain in July 1927. The events unfolding upon and after Sarwat arrival in London reveal the different views held by the British Secretary of State and the British High Commissioner regarding the timing of initiating such negotiations.  While the High Commissioner, Lord Lloyd believed that there should be a waiting period until such negotiations could begin and it up the Government of Egypt to make the request. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State, Sir Austen Chamberlain moved immediately to benefit from the stronger Sarwat cabinet and did so without coordination with Lloyd. “I had had also the definite assurance of the Secretary of State that if at any time negotiations should appear to be possible, they would be conducted in Egypt not in London” Also, the negotiations were not planned or prepared in advance. “In spite of the Secretary of State&#x27;s clearly recorded intention not to negotiate with Sarwat Pasha “during this visit”, the historical fact is that negotiations were begun the very next day, and two days afterwards-July 15-a detailed treaty was actually in draft. On July 18 Sarwat Pasha called again at the Foreign Office and communicated a draft treaty which he on his side had drafted”.

The unplanned overture of the Secretary of State initiated a sequence of events. In his first meeting with Sarwat on 12 July, Chamberlain clarified British interests in Egypt and hoped that an agreement was possible that would safeguard both Britain and Egypt&#x27;s interests. The lack of agreement, explained Chamberlain, would inevitably result in an eventual crisis that Britain would have to resolve by force. He then insisted that Sarwat, to the latter&#x27;s surprise, present him a draft treaty to normalize the relations between the two countries. Sarwat presented his draft treaty on 18 July 1927&quot;,&quot; which included concessions to Egyptian National aspirations. Sarwat later justified his concessions: “I was, despite that, taking into consideration what went into the minds of the British in terms of suspicions and unease, which may have prevented the full realization of these [Egyptian national] demands...Hence I saw that I would not have served Egyptian interests if I only presented a narrative about the National demands”. This marked the beginning of long and arduous negotiations, during which an event with major consequences happened.
On 23 August 1927, Saad Zaghlul Pasha, national icon and Leader of the majority Wafd Party died in Egypt. During the negotiation and until his death, Saad had been in communication with Sarwat about the negotiation. It took three weeks for the party to elect Mostafa El-Nahas Pasha as new leader. The new leader was known for his extremism, guaranteeing that the Party would maintain its revolutionary approach. Lord Lloyd, the British High Commissioner, was of the view that the negotiations should be suspended as “Zaghlul had been the one person whose support of a treaty with England could have ensured its acceptance. With his death, the possibility of such acceptance was rendered indefinitely more remote”. He also saw that the Liberal Democratic Party, which supported Sarwat, had a better chance to secure the lead after Zaghlul&#x27;s death and that a suspension of the negotiations would help to that end&quot;.&quot; The foreign office, not listening to its people on the terrain, wanted to move forward “Curiously enough, these considerations were used in London as an argument in favor of pressing forward the treaty negotiations, although it was realized that the prospect of securing the treaty was now remote”. On the Egyptian side, the death of Saad did not discourage Sarwat from his aim. On the contrary, he was the one who insisted on resuming the negotiations. and returned to London at the end of October 1927 to do so.

The negotiations were long and arduous. According to Sarwat “We were not moving forward without a lot of hardship and suffering”. On 6 February 1928, Secretary of State Chamberlain sent a threatening letter to Sarwat. Despite no agreement having yet been reached, he demanded that the draft treaty be presented as is to the Egyptian Government for signature. This was followed by a second similar letter on 24 February. Sarwat, being also pressured by his Ministers and by El-Nahas, the new leader of the Wafd, had no choice but to submit the incomplete draft treaty to Nahas. After studying it, Nahas and his party rejected the document.

On 4 March 1928, The Cabinet rejected the draft treaty. On the same day, Sarwat informed the Foreign office through the High Commissioner of the rejection and presented his resignation to the King.

== Sarwat&#x27;s death (1928) ==

Abdel Khalek Sarwat Pasha died from a heart attack, while on a personal visit to Paris on 22 November 1928 at the age of 55. His wife and his son Mustapha were with him. He was buried in Cairo after national funerals which started upon the arrival of his remains in Alexandria and onward by train to Cairo.

== Family life ==
Abdel Khalek Sarwat was married to Fatma Sadek, who died a year after him. They had six children, four boys: Ismail (1898–1969), Ahmed (1900–1990), Mustapha (1902–1960) and Aziz (1903–1983) and two girls: Enayat and Nehmat.

== Topical sections ==

=== Sarwat and the Liberal Constitutional Party ===
The Liberal Constitutional Party (LCP) had an intellectually liberal and secular platform, which was reflected in the promotion of a multiparty constitutional rule. On the Economy, it promoted economic liberalism and socially it believed in the respect of individual freedoms.

The first idea about forming such a party sprang in August 1921, when the Adly-Curzon negotiations were in trouble. In September, supporters of Adly approached Sarwat with their idea to form a party. The latter presented it to Adly, who initially rejected it, worrying that it would deepens the rift between his supporters and Saad&#x27;s.  Two days later, Adly changed his mind, believing that Egyptians were not ready for a revolution and that there was a need for a peaceful solution which required sustained efforts and resources. The Party was officially founded in October 1922, one month before the resignation of the first Sarwat cabinet. According to some calculations, when founded, 56% of its leadership was from large land owners while 30% was from the urban middle classes.

Although Sarwat gave to the Party the full logistic support of his Government, he never became a member. In fact, the relation between Sarwat and the LDP was ambivalent. On one hand, he shared with the Party founders their beliefs of liberalism, moderation and gradual achievement of Egypt&#x27;s independence and their belief in a multiparty constitutional rule. Sarwat and the Party supported each other politically. On the other hand, he wanted to maintain a distance from the Party, especially after his Cabinet&#x27;s resignation in 1922, when he remained, nevertheless, close to many of its members.

In the 1925 Parliament, when Sarwat ran against Saad for the Presidency of the Chamber of Deputies, he was not sitting as an LDP deputy, but as an Independent. He did not run for his seat, but the seat was waived to him by an elected LDP deputy, Moustapha Sabri.

=== Sarwat and Taha Hussein ===
Taha Hussein (1989-1973) was one of the most influential 20th-century Egyptian writer and intellectual and a figurehead of the Egyptian Renaissance. He was nicknamed “the Dean of Arabic Literature”. Sarwat was introduced to Taha Hussein by Ahmed Lufty El Sayed, the first president the Egyptian University. Sarwat was then Minister of Justice and Member of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian University. The introduction happened after a Board meeting, which discussed a complaint brought by a certain Sheikh Mohamed El Mahdi against Taha Hussein about an article the latter wrote and which was supported by some board members. A demand had been made to expel Hussein from the University&#x27;s mission to France. In the end, he remained in the mission, thanks to the support of Lufty El Sayed and Sarwat This introduction was the beginning of a lifetime friendship between Sarwat and Taha Hussein. The basis of this friendship was a common belief by the two men in liberal thinking.

Much later, in December 1923, when the Egyptian University accepted to merge into the to be created University of Fouad I, Lutfi El Sayed, the then President of the Egyptian University, put as a condition to the merger, the appointment of Taha Hussein as Professor in the faculty of Arts of the new University. This is what ended up happening. On his first lecture as Professor of History of Arabic Literature, Taha Hussein was introduced by Sarwat.

In 1926, Taha Hussein highly controversial book &quot;“On Pre-Islamic Poetry” في الشعر الجاهلي&quot; was published. It was dedicated to Sarwat, who was on the Board of Director of the University of Fuad I at the time. The dedication, dated 22 March 1926, reflected the friendship of the two men, but possibly also a political calculation by Taha Hussein who may have anticipated events to come.

There were two highly controversial assertions in the book. First, that the Quran cannot be used as a source of historical facts: “The Torah may tell us about Abraham and Ismael and the Quran also can tell us about both, but the occurrence of these two names in the Torah and the Quran is not sufficient to prove their historical existence”. Second, that there were doubts about pre-Islamic poetry as a proper representation of pre-Islamic mental and spiritual state and even pre-Islamic Arabic language. The publication of the book led to public demonstrations and attacks by members of the house of representative, demands that Taha be fired from the University and official complaints to a District Attorney. By the time Sarwat became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Adly coalition Government, the controversy was heated and Sarwat advised Taha Hussein to go away until matters settled a bit. Following several complaints, a District Attorney opened an investigation, which was delayed because of the absence of Taha Hussein. The investigation effectively started on 17 October 1926 and ended at on 30 March 1927 without any charges being filed. Less than two month later, Sarwat became prime minister while the controversy was still raging.

Taha Hussein who was a friend of Sarwat, was sympathetic to the Liberal Democratic Party, mainly because it espoused liberal ideas. As a result, the controversy became a confrontation between the religious establishment and supporters of the Wafd Party on one hand and supporters of the Liberal Constitutional Party on the other, with Sarwat being a historical supporter of the later.

== Activities and commendations ==
Sarwat was a member of the Board of Directors of the Egyptian University and of the Board of Directors of its successor University, the University of Fouad I. He was the third President of Al Ahly Sporting Club (1916–1924).

Abdel Khalek Sarwat street, a major street in downtown Cairo is named after him. In Alexandria, a tramway station bears his name as well as a street, on which he had his summer home, both in the neighborhood named after him. In Giza, the street bordering Cairo University on the north, now called Ahmed Zuwail Street, was called Sarwat street. A long overpass, recently built at the western end of that street is named Sarwat Bridge.

<text>Shorea robusta, the sal tree, sāla, shala, sakhua, or sarai, is a species of tree in the family Dipterocarpaceae. The tree is native to India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Tibet and across the Himalayan regions.

== Evolution ==
Fossil evidence from lignite mines in the Indian states of Rajasthan and Gujarat indicate that sal trees (or at least a closely related &quot;Shorea&quot; species) have been a dominant tree species of forests of the Indian subcontinent since at least the early Eocene (roughly 49 million years ago), at a time when the region otherwise supported a very different biota from the modern day. Evidence comes from the numerous amber nodules in these rocks, which originate from the dammar resin produced by the sal trees.

==Description==

&quot;Shorea robusta&quot; can grow up to tall with a trunk diameter of . The leaves are 10–25 cm long and 5–15 cm broad. In wetter areas, sal is evergreen; in drier areas, it is dry-season deciduous, shedding most of the leaves from February to April, leafing out again in April and May.

The sal tree is known also as sakhua in northern India, including Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Jharkhand. It is the state tree of two Indian states – Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand.

==Distribution and habitat==
This tree is native to the Indian subcontinent, ranging south of the Himalaya, from Myanmar in the east to Nepal, India and Bangladesh. In India, it extends from Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand west to the Shivalik Hills in Haryana, east of the Yamuna. The range also extends through the Eastern Ghats and to the eastern Vindhya and Satpura ranges of central India. It is often the dominant tree in the forests where it occurs. In Nepal, it is found mostly in the Terai region from east to west, especially, in the Sivalik Hills (Churia Range) in the subtropical climate zone. There are many protected areas, such as Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park and Shuklaphanta National Park, where there are dense forests of huge sal trees. It is also found in the lower belt of the Hilly region and Inner Terai.

==Culture==
===Hinduism===
In Hindu tradition, the sal tree is sacred. The tree is also associated with Vishnu. The tree&#x27;s common name, sal, comes from the word &quot;shala&quot;, which means &#x27;rampart&#x27; in Sanskrit.

Jains state that the 24th tirthankara, Mahavira, achieved enlightenment under a &quot;sal&quot;.

Some cultures in Bengal worship Sarna Burhi, a goddess associated with sacred groves of Sal trees.

There is a standard decorative element of Hindu Indian sculpture which originated in a yakshini grasping the branch of a flowering tree while setting her foot against its roots. This decorative sculptural element was integrated into Indian temple architecture as &quot;salabhanjika&quot; or &quot;sal tree maiden&quot;, although it is not clear either whether it is a sal tree or an asoka tree. The tree is also mentioned in the &quot;Ramayana&quot;—specifically, where Lord Rama (on request of deposed monkey-king Sugriva for proof he can kill Sugriva&#x27;s older half-brother Vali) is asked to pierce seven &quot;sals&quot; in a row with a single arrow (which is later used to kill Vali, and still later to behead Ravana&#x27;s brother Kumbhakarna)

In the Kathmandu Valley of Nepal, one can find typical Nepali pagoda temple architectures with very rich wooden carvings, and most of the temples, such as Nyatapola Temple, are made of bricks and sal tree wood.

===Buddhism===
Buddhist tradition holds that Queen Māyā of Sakya, while en route to her grandfather&#x27;s kingdom, gave birth to Gautama Buddha while grasping the branch of a sal tree or an Ashoka tree in a garden in Lumbini in south Nepal.

Also according to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha was lying between a pair of sal trees when he died:
The sal tree is also said to have been the tree under which Koṇḍañña and Vessabhū, respectively the fifth and twenty-fourth Buddhas preceding Gautama Buddha, attained enlightenment.

In Buddhism, the brief flowering of the sal tree is used as a symbol of impermanence and the rapid passing of glory, particularly as an analog of &quot;sic transit gloria mundi&quot;. In Japanese Buddhism, this is best known through the opening line of &quot;The Tale of the Heike&quot; – a tale of the rise and fall of a once-powerful clan – whose latter half reads , quoting the four-character idiom from a passage in the Humane King Sutra, .

==Confusion with cannonball tree and other trees==
In Asia, the sal tree is often confused with the &quot;Couroupita guianensis&quot; or cannonball tree, a tree from tropical South America introduced to Asia by the British in the 19th century. The cannonball tree has since then been planted at Buddhist and Hindu religious sites in Asia in the belief that it is the tree of sacred scriptures. In Sri Lanka, Thailand and other Theravada Buddhist countries it has been planted at Buddhist monasteries and other religious sites. In India the cannonball tree has been planted at Shiva temples and is called Shiv Kamal or Nagalingam since its flowers are said to resemble the hood of a Nāga (divine cobra) protecting a Shiva lingam.
An example of a cannonball tree erroneously named &#x27;sal tree&#x27; is at the Pagoda at the Royal Palace of Phnom Penh in Cambodia.

In Japan the sal tree of Buddhist scriptures is identified as the deciduous camellia (&quot;Stewartia pseudocamellia&quot;), called shāra, 沙羅, from Sanskrit śāla.

The sal tree is also said to be confused with the Ashoka tree (&quot;Saraca asoca&quot;).

==Uses==
Sal is one of the most important sources of hardwood timber in India, with hard, coarse-grained wood that is light in colour when freshly cut, but becomes dark brown with exposure. The wood is resinous and durable, and is sought-after for construction, although not well suited to planing and polishing. The wood is especially suitable for constructing frames for doors and windows.

The dry leaves of sal are a major source for the production of leaf plates and bowls called patravali in India and Nepal. The used leaves/plates are readily eaten by goats and cattle. The tree has therefore protected northern India from a flood of styrofoam and plastic plates that would have caused tremendous pollution. In Nepal, its leaves are used to make local plates and vessels called &quot;tapari&quot;, &quot;doona&quot; and &quot;bogata&quot; in which rice and curry is served. However, the use of such &quot;natural&quot; tools have sharply declined during the last decade.

Sal tree resin is known as sal dammar or Indian dammar, &quot;ṛla&quot; in Sanskrit. It is used as an astringent in Ayurvedic medicine, burned as incense in Hindu ceremonies, and used to caulk boats and ships.

Sal seeds and fruit are a source of lamp oil and vegetable fat. The seed oil is extracted from the seeds and used as cooking oil after refining.

<text>Luis Mangalus Taruc (; June 21, 1913 – May 4, 2005) was a Filipino political figure and rebel during the agrarian unrest of the 1930s until the end of the Cold War. He was the leader of the Hukbalahap group (from &quot;Hukbong Bayan Laban sa Hapon&quot;) between 1942 and 1950. His involvement with the movement came after his initiation to the problems of agrarian Filipinos when he was a student in the early 1930s. During World War II, Taruc led the Hukbalahap in guerrilla operations against the Japanese occupants of the Philippines.

Influenced by his socialist idol Pedro Abad Santos of San Fernando, and inspired by earlier Katipunan revolutionaries such as Felipe Salvador, Taruc joined the &quot;Aguman ding Maldang Tala-pagobra&quot; (AMT, Kapampangan for &#x27;Union of Peasant Workers&#x27;) and in 1938, the &quot;Partido Sosyalista ng Pilipinas&quot; (Socialist Party of the Philippines). The latter merged with the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas as part of the Common Front strategy, and Taruc assumed the role of Commander-in-Chief of the military wing created to fight the Japanese.

After the war against Japan, the Hukbalahap continued their demands for agrarian reform. Taruc and seven colleagues were elected to the House of Representatives, but the government of Manuel Roxas did not allow them to take their seats in Congress. The Taruc faction opposed the parity rights that the U.S. required from post-independence Philippines as a condition for rehabilitation funding. In the next five years, Taruc would give up on the parliamentary struggle and once more take up arms. At the height of its popularity, the Hukbalahap reached a fighting strength estimated at between 10,000 and 30,000. In 2017, the National Historical Commission of the Philippines declared Taruc a hero for being a &quot;nationalist and defender of the rights of farmers and workers&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Luis Mangalus Taruc was born of peasant stock in the barrio of Santa Monica, township of San Luis, Pampanga on 21 June 1913. Luis states, &quot;In my youth, the Christian faith dominated my spiritual life. But the landlord dominated the material life I knew.&quot; At age eight, Luis attended public school in San Miguel, Bulacan. At fifteen, he attended high school in Tarlac City. He attended to the University of Manila for two years (June 1932–December 1934), studying medicine and law, but no longer able to afford the expenses, returned to Batasan without getting a degree to set up a tailor shop with his brother. As a teen he was inspired by the stories of the Katipuneros who had fought for independence and for agrarian reform against Spain. Certain people within his home village and province came to regard him as the incarnation of the prominent Katipunan leader Felipe Salvador. He was influenced by Pedro Abad Santos, a Marxist, whom Luis regarded as a true socialist. In June 1935, he married Feliciana Bernabe, and his son Romeo was born in March 1936.Before the end of 1935, he joined Santos as a full-time organizer of the Socialist Party of the Philippines, which numbered a few hundred members and several thousand sympathizers. His wife died in Dec. 1938, suffering from goiter and anemia. He then married Enna Cura on 4 June 1939. Luis would serve time in prison three times before the war, in his struggle for the militant workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; unions. Enna died of sepsis and diabetes on 8 March 1946. Luis later married Gregoria Calma (Liza). She was killed by government soldiers on 11 April 1952.

==World War II==
On November 7, 1938, the Philippine Socialist Party and the Communist Party of the Philippines merged, forming a united front &quot;to fight against fascism and war&quot;, though each party retained its own organizations until 1941. They pledged loyalty to the Philippine and United States government&#x27;s anti-Japanese crusade in December 1941. Following the Japanese invasion, Taruc formed the Hukbalahap (&quot;Hukbo ng Bayan Laban sa Hapon&quot; or the &quot;People’s Army Against the Japanese&quot; in English), along with Casto Alejandrino and other guerrillas, in central Luzon on March 29, 1942, became its commander-in-chief, and chairman of the Communist Party&#x27;s Military Committee.

He led a large people&#x27;s army against the Japanese invaders, and their &quot;puppet constabulary&quot;, as Supremo Luis Taruc, or &quot;Lu-Lu&quot; (&quot;the racing one&quot;), then &quot;Alipato&quot; (&quot;the flying spark that spreads a fire&quot;). According to Luis, &quot;There was a period when we had an American officer officially collaborating with our work.&quot; Taruc credited his prominence through his &quot;identification with the simple, sincere, and courageous peasants.&quot; However, Luis noted, &quot;...most of the time, the American authorities were suspicious of this unconventional army whose politics they suspected.&quot; Yet, the Hukbalahap under Taruc did become an effective armed guerrilla force.

==Post-war years==
Taruc was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in 1946 as a member of the Democratic Alliance (the party led by Sergio Osmena). He and five other elected Democratic Alliance candidates opposed the constitutional amendment that would give American businessmen parity rights with Filipinos in exchange for US rehabilitation funding. In particular, Luis opposed the Bell Trade Act, the Parity Amendment to the Constitution, and the Military Bases Agreement. To secure the majority necessarily to pass the amendment President Manuel Roxas arranged for Taruc and the other oppositional Democratic Alliance members to be ejected from office by the Commission on Elections on the grounds that they had been committing election fraud and terrorism.

Taruc went underground in late 1946, following failed negotiations with President Roxas, and the Huks soon numbered 10,000 armed fighters. Subsequent negotiations with President Elpidio Quirino in June and August 1948 also failed. By the presidential elections of 1949, the Huks had abandoned electoral politics in favor of armed insurgency. The Huks controlled most of central Luzon, the “rice basket” of the Philippines, including two provincial capitals, by 1950. Their motto, &quot;a democratic peace, or martyrdom.&quot; Luis states, &quot;The peasants&#x27; hatred was founded on centuries of exploitation and oppression, feudal landlordism, and bad government. But the rich...were driven by fear of losing their power and their social privilege...this was naked class war.&quot; In the Politburo meeting of December 1949 to January 1950, the Huks were reorganized as the HMB, &quot;Hukbo Mapagpalaya ng Bayan&quot;, or &quot;People&#x27;s Army of Liberation&quot;, with Luis as a Politburo Supervisor (PBS) for the Party&#x27;s Regional Committee, Reco 2, in the Zambales Mountains. By November 1950, Luis was removed from his post of command entirely. By then, the Huks had 15,000 armed men, and the country was embroiled in a &quot;miniature civil war&quot;, with ambushes on the major highways common.

President Quirino assigned Ramon Magsaysay, minister of national defense, to combat the Huk insurgency. On 18 October 1950, Magsaysay captured the Secretariat, including the general secretary José Lava, following the earlier capture of the Politburo in Manila. Magsaysay attracted peasant support by reforming the Army and Constabulary. After the 1951 Central Committee meeting, a policy of &quot;preservation and conservation of strength...for a long and bitter struggle&quot; was adopted, and Luis departed with a group of ninety men and seven women, for the Sierra Madre Mountains. The latter part of 1952 was spent hiding in the Mount Arayat area. In January 1953, Luis was suspended from the Politburo and Secretariat for his &quot;Call for Peace&quot;. On February 10, 1954, Manuel Manahan and Benigno Aquino Jr., appointed as President Ramon Magsaysay&#x27;s representatives, met with Luis Taruc. After four months of negotiations, Taruc surrendered unconditionally to the government on 17 May 1954, effectively ending the Huk rebellion. On 15 June 1954, Luis met with President Magsaysay and Gen. Eulogio Balao at Camp Murphy, where Luis agreed to a trial.

Taruc&#x27;s trial started in August 1954, where he pleaded guilty to rebellion, &quot;in the spirit of my agreement with the president&quot;, and sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment, plus a &quot;huge fine&quot;. From 1956 to 1958, Luis was put on trial for the execution of Feliciano Gardiner, Japanese occupation governor of Tarlac, for which he was found guilty and sentenced to four life sentences. His petition to President Diosdado Macapagal for executive clemency and amnesty to political prisoners in exchange for support for the President&#x27;s social welfare program was ignored. Taruc was pardoned by President Ferdinand Marcos on September 11, 1968, and Marcos gained the former Huk leader&#x27;s support. After his release, he continued to work for agrarian reforms. His struggle on behalf of the poor farmers persuaded local and national leaders to strengthen the legal rights of farm workers and led to a more equitable distribution of farm land. In his later years Taruc claimed to have never been a real communist, but rather always advocated Christian democratic socialism; he supported land reform strengthening the rights of local, small farmers over corporations and hereditary feudal elite.

==Legacy==

Taruc dictated &quot;Born of the People&quot; (1953) to American communist and ghost writer William Pomeroy. Luis Taruc used Alipato, meaning &quot;spark that spreads a fire&quot;, as his pseudonym. &quot;Born of the People&quot; was Nelson Mandela&#x27;s reference on peasant resistance and guerrilla warfare when he was the commander in chief of the uMkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation).

While in New Bilibid Prison, Taruc composed &quot;He Who Rides the Tiger&quot; (1967). Luis wrote, &quot;I know now from experience, that the nationalism of the Communists is indeed opportunism, and that they use it for their own ends. Any nationalist who makes an ally of the Communist is going for a ride on a tiger.&quot; Additionally, Luis wrote, &quot;For ruthlessness and cruelty are alien to Christian thought, and when men in the Free World use such methods, they do so in defiance of their own morality and ideals. The atheist Communist, however, believes that the end justifies the means, or in Lenin&#x27;s words, &#x27;Morality is subordinate to the class struggle.&#x27; For this reason, the Communist can pursue a policy of terror and cruelty with a clear conscience.&quot;

In 1985, Taruc would tell F. Sionil Jose that one of the reasons for the failure of the insurgency was that dissenters were killed. He also said that dogmatic fundamentalism scared away many potential allies. The Huk movement commanded an estimated 170,000 armed troops with a base of two million civilian supporters at the apex of their power in 1952. In 2003, he explained to historian Keith Thor Carlson that he attributed the revolution&#x27;s failure to the dogmatism of members of the politburo&#x27;s Russian-trained elite, in particular José and Jesus Lava, an accusation that runs contrary to the views of the Lavas and William Pomeroy who countered that Taruc suffered from a cult of personality.

Several Huk veterans organizations dispute the credit heaped on Taruc for organizing the Hukbalahap during World War II. They contend that Taruc only joined the movement when several prominent Huk leaders were captured and executed by the Japanese, and that there were several Huk brigades operating in concert, under Castro Alejandrino, Eusebio Aquino, and Mariano Franco among others.

==Death==
On May 4, 2005, Luis Taruc died of a heart attack in St. Luke&#x27;s Medical Center in Quezon City at the age of 91, a month before his 92nd birthday. Many political figures went to Luis Taruc&#x27;s wake to pay respect and give support to his family.

<text>In modal logic, Sahlqvist formulas are a certain kind of modal formula with remarkable properties. The Sahlqvist correspondence theorem states that every Sahlqvist formula is canonical, and corresponds to a class of Kripke frames definable by a first-order formula. 

Sahlqvist&#x27;s definition characterizes a decidable set of modal formulas with first-order correspondents. Since it is undecidable, by Chagrova&#x27;s theorem, whether an arbitrary modal formula has a first-order correspondent, there are formulas with first-order frame conditions that are not Sahlqvist [Chagrova 1991] (see the examples below). Hence Sahlqvist formulas define only a (decidable) subset of modal formulas with first-order correspondents.

== Definition ==
Sahlqvist formulas are built up from implications, where the consequent is &quot;positive&quot; and the antecedent is of a restricted form.
* A &quot;boxed atom&quot; is a propositional atom preceded by a number (possibly 0) of boxes, i.e. a formula of the form formula_1 (often abbreviated as formula_2 for formula_3).
* A &quot;Sahlqvist antecedent&quot; is a formula constructed using ∧, ∨, and formula_4 from boxed atoms, and negative formulas (including the constants ⊥, ⊤).
* A &quot;Sahlqvist implication&quot; is a formula &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;, where &quot;A&quot; is a Sahlqvist antecedent, and &quot;B&quot; is a positive formula.
* A &quot;Sahlqvist formula&quot; is constructed from Sahlqvist implications using ∧ and formula_5 (unrestricted), and using ∨ on formulas with no common variables.

== Examples of Sahlqvist formulas ==
; formula_6
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_7, and it defines all reflexive frames
; formula_8
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_9, and it defines all symmetric frames
; formula_10 or formula_11
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_12, and it defines all transitive frames
; formula_13 or formula_14
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_15, and it defines all dense frames
; formula_16
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_17, and it defines all right-unbounded frames (also called serial)
; formula_18
: Its first-order corresponding formula is formula_19, and it is the Church–Rosser property.

==Examples of non-Sahlqvist formulas==
; formula_20
: This is the &quot;McKinsey formula&quot;; it does not have a first-order frame condition.
; formula_21
: The &quot;Löb axiom&quot; is not Sahlqvist; again, it does not have a first-order frame condition.
; formula_22
: The conjunction of the McKinsey formula and the (4) axiom has a first-order frame condition (the conjunction of the transitivity property with the property formula_23) but is not equivalent to any Sahlqvist formula.

== Kracht&#x27;s theorem ==
When a Sahlqvist formula is used as an axiom in a normal modal logic, the logic is guaranteed to be complete with respect to the basic elementary class of frames the axiom defines. This result comes from the Sahlqvist completeness theorem [Modal Logic, Blackburn &quot;et al.&quot;, Theorem 4.42]. But there is also a converse theorem, namely a theorem that states which first-order conditions are the correspondents of Sahlqvist formulas. Kracht&#x27;s theorem states that &quot;any Sahlqvist formula locally corresponds to a Kracht formula; and conversely, every Kracht formula is a local first-order correspondent of some Sahlqvist formula which can be effectively obtained from the Kracht formula&quot; [Modal Logic, Blackburn &quot;et al.&quot;, Theorem 3.59].
