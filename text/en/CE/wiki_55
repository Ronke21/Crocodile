<text>Dirch Hartvig Passer (18 May 1926 – 3 September 1980) was a Danish actor and comedian. He was renowned for his improvisational skills and, with a filmography comprising 90 films, one of Denmark&#x27;s most prolific actors. His life is depicted in the Danish semi-biographical film &quot;A Funny Man&quot; (2011; Danish title: &quot;Dirch&quot;) directed by Martin Zandvliet and starring Nikolaj Lie Kaas as Dirch Passer.

== Life ==
When he was young, Passer was very shy, but had an ambition to become an actor. Instead, he conformed to his father&#x27;s wishes by attending the J. Lauritzen sea training school near Svendborg in 1944. But since he had persistent problems with seasickness, he later attended the drama school &quot;De frederiksbergske teatres Elevskole&quot;.

During the 1950s he formed a duo with his friend and fellow actor Kjeld Petersen. Their revue sketches, based upon the contrast between Petersen&#x27;s mixture of joviality and desperate anger and Passer&#x27;s deadpan responses, are still considered classics by the public. The sudden death of Kjeld Petersen in 1962 led Passer to avoid revues for five years, but he built up an individual reputation and in 1967 he returned to the revue gaining new victories. Many thin jokes in the scripts were greatly improved by his performance. In particular, his many amiable eccentrics and &quot;nature experts&quot; together with his sketch roles as a baby and as a nonsense &quot;Russian&quot;-speaking clown made him famous. From his later years must be mentioned an almost silent sketch in which he portrays a man&#x27;s vain attempt to stop smoking (also shown in West German TV). It was told that he could speak any language, however he wouldn&#x27;t understand any of it, which was one of his good qualities.

In his life, Dirch Passer wanted to play more serious roles instead of remaining in comedy. However, his image as a comedian was so solid that his attempt to break into serious acting proved to be unsuccessful.

== Career ==
He was often referred to as a loud actor in spite of the fact that under-acting was responsible for much of his force. A Danish critic, Jens Kistrup, once said that one of the secrets behind the comedy of Passer was its combination of elements that are normally regarded as incompatible. He possessed noisiness and discretion, loudness and quietness, boundlessness and complete control, craziness and softness – all this combined with a special intimacy with the audience. Among the inspirations he mentioned Joe E. Brown but he was also known for his admiration of the British comedian Tommy Cooper. In his films, which were of very mixed quality, he often played kind and somewhat crazy &quot;Everymen&quot; or antiheroes. Among his best movie roles were stage roles transferred to film; here must be mentioned the hero in &quot;Charley&#x27;s Aunt&quot; (1959), Celestin-Floridor in &quot;Frøken Nitouche&quot; (1963) and Leopold in &quot;Summer in Tyrol&quot; (1964, based on &quot;The White Horse Inn&quot;).
Numerous Danish actors see him as a role model. In day-to-day life he was quite shy in behaviour, somewhat the opposite of his theatrical appearances.

== Death ==
On 3 September 1980, Passer collapsed from cardiac arrest behind the stage curtain, in his clown costume, just before the opening number of the annual Tivoli Revue at the Glass Hall in Tivoli Gardens. An hour or two later, the doctors at the hospital declared him dead. Passer is buried in the church cemetery in Dragør, Denmark.

==Career==
Colantoni appeared on &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; as Elliot DiMauro from 1997 to 2003. Colantoni played Keith Mars for three seasons on &quot;Veronica Mars&quot; from 2004 to 2007, a role he reprised in the 2014 film and the 2019 Hulu revival. He starred in the Canadian TV police drama &quot;Flashpoint&quot; as Sgt. Greg Parker (also airing in the U.S. on ION Television, and airing previously on CBS). His older brother, who was a Toronto policeman for the past 30 years, advised Colantoni on how to play the character. Colantoni starred in the TV series &quot;Remedy&quot;.

Colantoni also had a recurring role on &quot;Person of Interest&quot; as crime boss Carl Elias and on &quot;Travelers&quot; as Vincent Ingram (Traveller 001). He appeared in HBO&#x27;s &quot;Westworld&quot; and in &quot;Station Eleven&quot;. Colantoni appeared in the TV series &quot;iZombie&quot; and also directed two episodes.

Since 2011, Colantoni has been heavily involved with The Tema Conter Memorial Trust, an organization that assists first responders and other service personnel dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder. He became their official spokesperson and has been involved in their annual tribute gala in Toronto every year since.

He has also been involved in the Companion Animal Protection Society&#x27;s campaign to boycott commercial pet stores, creating a video to raise awareness about the topic.

<text>The 1984 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIV Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, from 8 to 19 February 1984. A total of 1,272 athletes representing 49 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 39 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. First time NOCs to enter were Egypt, Monaco, Puerto Rico, Senegal, and British Virgin Islands.

Seventeen NOCs won at least one medal and, among these, eleven secured at least one gold medal. For the first time since its debut at the 1968 Winter Olympics, East Germany topped the gold medal count with nine, three more than the Soviet Union, which had led this count in the past three Games. The Soviet delegation won the most overall medals (25), including the most silvers (10) and bronzes (9). The host nation, Yugoslavia, collected its first-ever medal at the Winter Olympics: a silver by alpine skier Jure Franko in the men&#x27;s giant slalom. This was the third time that the Winter Olympics host team failed to win a gold medal, after France in 1924 and Switzerland in 1928.

Austrian athletes secured a single medal—a bronze in men&#x27;s alpine skiing downhill—in what is the nation&#x27;s worst ever result at the Winter Games.
In contrast, Czechoslovakia and Finland&#x27;s performances in Sarajevo were historical bests, after collecting a total of six and thirteen medals, respectively.
Finnish cross-country skier Marja-Liisa Hämäläinen was responsible for three of her NOC&#x27;s four gold medals with a sweep of victories in the women&#x27;s individual events, and contributed to the bronze in the team relay event.
These Games also witnessed the best result by a Canadian team since the 1960 Winter Olympics, thanks mostly to the achievements of speed skater Gaétan Boucher. His wins in the men&#x27;s 1,000 and 1,500 metres, and a third place in the 500 metres, earned Canada&#x27;s two gold medals and three of its four medals.
Sweden secured four golds for the first time since St. Moritz 1948, of which three were obtained by cross-country skiers Gunde Svan and Thomas Wassberg. Svan and Wassberg won the men&#x27;s 15 km and 50 km, respectively, and also clinched the first place in the team relay. Svan was also awarded with a silver and bronze medals, thus contributing half of his NOC&#x27;s medal tally.
For the third consecutive Winter Olympics, Great Britain&#x27;s sole medal was a gold at a figure skating event, this time in ice dancing by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean, who received the first-ever set of perfect scores in their free program routine.

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

<text>The 1980 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XIII Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in Lake Placid, New York, United States, from February 13 to 24. A total of 1,072 athletes from 37 nations participated in 38 events from 10 different sports. 

Athletes from 19 countries won at least one medal, and athletes from 11 secured at least one gold medal. After winning a then-record 13 gold medals in the 1976 Winter Olympics, the Soviet Union led with 10 gold medals in 1980, and had the second most total medals with 22. East Germany led the overall medal count with 23. The host United States were third in both gold and overall medals, with 6 and 12, respectively. Having won her country&#x27;s first Olympic medal in Innsbruck, four years before, alpine skier Hanni Wenzel won Liechtenstein&#x27;s only two gold medals in the country&#x27;s history, at Lake Placid. Liechtenstein is the smallest nation to ever win a gold medal at the Olympics. Bulgaria won its first Winter Olympic medal at these Games, a bronze medal in cross-country skiing. The People&#x27;s Republic of China made their first appearance at a Winter Olympics at these Games, but failed to win any medals.

American Eric Heiden led all athletes with five medals, all gold, in speed skating. Heiden was the first athlete to win five gold medals in individual events in a single Olympics, Summer or Winter. Five other athletes won three medals each at these Games.
==Medal table==


The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. Medals won in team competitions—such as ice hockey—are counted only once, no matter how many athletes won medals as part of the team.

In the normal hill event in ski jumping, two silver medals were awarded for a second place tie. No bronze medal was awarded for that event. In the men&#x27;s 1000 meters speed skating event, two bronze medals were awarded for a third place tie.

<text>The 1976 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XII Olympic Winter Games, was a winter multi-sport event held in Innsbruck, Austria, from 4 to 15 February 1976. A total of 1,123 athletes representing 37 National Olympic Committees (NOC) participated in 37 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. Two events were contested for the first time: the figure skating discipline of ice dancing, and the men&#x27;s 1,000 metres in speed skating.
Sixteen NOCs won at least one medal, and twelve of them secured at least one gold. The Soviet Union clinched the first place in the gold and overall medal counts, with 13 and 27, respectively. Moreover, the Soviet team also collected the most silver (6) and bronze (8) medals. The host nation, Austria, concluded its participation with a total of six medals (two golds, two silvers, and two bronzes).
Liechtenstein won its first Olympic medals: two bronzes by Willi Frommelt and Hanni Wenzel in the alpine skiing slalom events. East German athletes achieved gold medal sweeps in luge and bobsleigh, which accounted for five of the country&#x27;s seven Olympic titles. Alpine skier Rosi Mittermaier won the women&#x27;s downhill and slalom events to give West Germany&#x27;s two gold medals in these Games. She came close to winning a third in the giant slalom, which would have made her the first woman to win all three Olympic alpine skiing events. Cross-country skier Helena Takalo contributed three of Finland&#x27;s seven medals by reaching podium place finishes in all of the women&#x27;s events. Two Dutch speed skaters were responsible for five of their country&#x27;s six medals: Piet Kleine won the men&#x27;s 10,000 metres and came second in the 5,000 metres, while Hans van Helden secured bronze medals in the same events and also in the 1,500 metres. Before these Games, Great Britain&#x27;s last Winter Olympic medal had been a gold at the 1964 Games, also held in Innsbruck. Twelve years later in the same city, the British team won again a single gold medal, this time by figure skater John Curry in the men&#x27;s singles with a still-standing record total score. The two bronze medals won by Swedish athletes were not enough to prevent this team&#x27;s performance from becoming the weakest ever in the nation&#x27;s Winter Olympic history.

Andorra and San Marino sent their first delegations to the Winter Olympics, whereas the Republic of China competed for the second and last time before its return as Chinese Taipei at the 1984 Winter Olympics; none of these teams medalled.

== Medal table ==
The medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code.

==Change by doping==

Galina Kulakova of the Soviet Union finished 3rd in the women&#x27;s 5 km ski event, but was disqualified due to a positive test for banned substance ephedrine. She claimed that this was a result of using the nasal spray that contained the substance. Both the FIS and the IOC allowed her to compete in the 10 km and the 4×5 km relay. This was the first stripped medal at the Winter Olympics.

<doc id="921345" wikidata="Q235196" url="?curid=921345" title="Betty Garrett">
<text>Betty Garrett (May 23, 1919 – February 12, 2011) was an American actress, comedian, singer and dancer. She originally performed on Broadway, and was then signed to a film contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She appeared in several musical films, then returned to Broadway and made guest appearances on several television series.

Garrett later became known for the roles she played in two prominent 1970s sitcoms: Archie Bunker&#x27;s politically liberal neighbor Irene Lorenzo in &quot;All in the Family&quot; and landlady Edna Babish in &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. In later years, she appeared in television series such as &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot; and &quot;Becker&quot; as well as in several Broadway plays and revivals.

==Early life==
Garrett was born in Saint Joseph, Missouri, the daughter of Elizabeth Octavia (née Stone) and Curtis Garrett. Shortly after her birth, her parents relocated to Seattle, Washington, where her mother managed the sheet music department at Sherman Clay, and her father worked as a traveling salesman. His alcoholism and fiscal irresponsibility eventually led to their divorce, and Garrett and her mother lived in a series of residential hotels in order to minimize expenses.

When Garrett was eight years old, her mother married the fiancé she had jilted in order to marry Curtis. They settled in Regina, Saskatchewan, where her new stepfather worked in the meat-packing industry. A year later, her mother discovered that her new husband was involved in a sexual relationship with his male assistant, so she and Betty returned to Seattle. After graduating from public grammar school, Garrett enrolled at the Annie Wright School in Tacoma, which she attended on a full scholarship. The school had no drama department, so she frequently organized musical productions and plays for special occasions. Following her senior year performance in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, the bishop urged her to pursue a career on the stage. At the same time, her mother&#x27;s friend arranged an interview with Martha Graham, who was in Seattle for a concert tour, and the dancer recommended her for a scholarship at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City.

Garrett and her mother arrived in Manhattan in the summer of 1936 and Garrett began classes in September. Her teachers included Graham and Anna Sokolow for dance, Sandy Meisner for drama, Lehman Engel for music, and Margaret Webster for the Shakespearean classics, and fellow students included Daniel Mann and Richard Conte. She felt she was destined to be a dramatic actress and shied away from playing comedic roles.

==Early career==
During the summer months, Garrett performed in the Borscht Belt, where she had the opportunity to work with Danny Kaye, Jerome Robbins, Carol Channing, Imogene Coca, and Jules Munshin, and she was encouraged to hone her singing and dancing skills. She joined Orson Welles&#x27; Mercury Theatre as an understudy in what was to be its last stage presentation, a poorly-reviewed and short-lived production of &quot;Danton&#x27;s Death&quot; that gave her the opportunity to work with Joseph Cotten, Ruth Ford, Martin Gabel, and Arlene Francis. She performed with Martha Graham&#x27;s dance company at Carnegie Hall and the Alvin Theatre, sang at the Village Vanguard, and appeared in satirical and political revues staged by the Brooklyn-based Flatbush Arts Theatre, which eventually changed its name to the American Youth Theatre and relocated to Manhattan. During this period she joined the Communist Party and began performing at fundraisers for progressive causes.

===Broadway===
Garrett made her Broadway debut in 1942 in the revue &quot;Of V We Sing&quot;, which closed after 76 performances but led to her being cast in the Harold Rome revue &quot;Let Freedom Sing&quot; later that year. It closed after only eight performances, but producer Mike Todd saw it and signed her to understudy Ethel Merman and play a small role in the 1943 Cole Porter musical &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;. Merman became ill during the run, allowing Garrett to play the lead for a week. During this time, she was seen by producer Vinton Freedley, who cast her in &quot;Jackpot&quot;, a Vernon Duke/Howard Dietz musical starring Nanette Fabray and Allan Jones. The show closed quickly, and Garrett began touring the country with her nightclub act.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===
After appearing on Broadway in &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot;, which closed there, Garrett traveled with the show as it played extended runs in Detroit and Chicago. After this, she returned to New York and was cast in &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;, which reunited her with Harold Rome, Lehman Engel, and Jules Munshin. She won critical acclaim and the Donaldson Award for her performance, which prompted Al Hirschfeld to caricature her in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. It led to her being signed to a one-year contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer by Louis B. Mayer. Garrett arrived at the studio in January 1947 and made her film debut portraying nightclub performer Shoo Shoo O&#x27;Grady in &quot;Big City&quot;, directed by Norman Taurog and co-starring George Murphy and Robert Preston. Mayer renewed her contract and she appeared in the musicals &quot;Words and Music&quot;, &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;Take Me Out To The Ball Game&quot;, and &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; in quick succession.

&quot;The Jolson Story&quot; had been a huge hit in the United Kingdom, so Garrett and her husband Larry Parks decided to capitalize on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the U.K. with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them to return to the country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett then was cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, a 1955 musical remake of a 1940 theatrical adaptation of stories by Ruth McKenney. Garrett got the part when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year, she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades. she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short-lived plays (&quot;Beg, Borrow or Steal&quot; with Parks and &quot;A Girl Could Get Lucky&quot; with Pat Hingle) and a musical adaptation of &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot;, and making guest appearances on &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, &quot;The Lloyd Bridges Show&quot;, and &quot;The Fugitive&quot;.

==Later career==
In the fall of 1973, &quot;All in the Family&quot; added two new people to the neighborhood, Frank Lorenzo and his feisty Irish-American wife Irene. Lear had been the publicity man for &quot;Call Me Mister&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot; writers Bernard West and Mickey West knew Garrett from her time with the American Youth Theatre, and Jean Stapleton had been in the cast of &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot;, so Garrett appeared to be a front runner for the role of Irene. It went instead to Sada Thompson, but Thompson, unhappy after taping one episode, asked to be released from her commitment, freeing the role for Garrett. Irene was Catholic—a source of annoyance for Protestant Archie—and assumed many of the handyman household duties normally associated with husbands, and she therefore presented a kind of nemesis to Archie Bunker. She later worked with Archie at his place of employment, driving a forklift, and was paid less than the man she replaced (but more than Archie). Garrett remained with the series from 1973 through 1975. She won the 1974 Golden Globe for her performance on the series.
The following year, Garrett was performing her one-woman show &quot;Betty Garrett and Other Songs&quot; in Westwood, California when she was offered the role of landlady Edna Babish in &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. The character was a five-time divorcée who eventually married Laverne&#x27;s father Frank. Although Garrett reportedly felt she never was given enough to do on the show, she appreciated the fact that her musical talents occasionally were incorporated into the plot. In 1981, when the series was extended beyond what had been intended to be its final season, Garrett was forced to drop out because she had committed to performing with Sandy Dennis, Jack Gilford, Hope Lange, and Joyce Van Patten in &quot;The Supporting Cast&quot; on Broadway. The play closed after only eight performances, but returning to &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; was not an option as the writers had explained Edna&#x27;s disappearance by having her divorce Frank, although this was not directly addressed until the series&#x27; final season.

In the ensuing years, Garrett appeared on television in &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, &quot;Harts of the West&quot;, &quot;Union Square&quot;, &quot;Boston Public&quot;, &quot;Becker&quot; (for which she was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series), and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, and on stage in &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (with Parks), &quot;And Miss Reardon Drinks A Little&quot;, &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; as Katie, the feisty Irish maid, and the 2001 Broadway revival of &quot;Follies&quot;, receiving excellent notices for singing &quot;Broadway Baby.&quot; At Theatre West, which she co-founded, she directed Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Price&quot; and appeared in the play &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;. She won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award twice, for &quot;Spoon River Anthology&quot; and &quot;Betty Garrett and Other Songs&quot;.

Garrett received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003. On the occasion of her 90th birthday in 2009, she was honored at a celebration sponsored by Theatre West at the Music Box Theatre in Hollywood.

In 2010, Garrett appeared alongside former two-time co-star Esther Williams during Turner Classic Movies&#x27; first annual Classic Film Festival. Their film &quot;Neptune&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was screened at the pool of the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, while a Williams-inspired synchronised swimming troupe, The Aqualilies, performed.

==Awards and nominations==
Golden Globes
* 1974: Won for Best Supporting Actress for the role of Irene Lorenzo in the television series &quot;All in the Family&quot;.

Primetime Emmy Awards
* 2003: Nominated for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for the role of Molly Firth in the CBS sitcom &quot;Becker&quot;.

Ovation Awards
* 2009: Nominated for Lead Actress in a Play for the role of Sarita Myrtle in the Theatre West production of &quot;Waiting in the Wings&quot;

==Personal life==
While appearing in Los Angeles, Garrett was invited to perform a comedy sketch at the Actor&#x27;s Lab in Hollywood. It was there where she met Larry Parks, who was producing the show. He invited her to join him for a drink, then drove her to the top of Mulholland Drive and told her &quot;You&#x27;re the girl I&#x27;m going to marry.&quot; During the next two weeks, the two were inseparable. Garrett departed for a nightclub engagement in Chicago. Eventually Parks joined her and introduced her to his mother, who lived in nearby Joliet, Illinois. Parks returned to Los Angeles to begin filming &quot;Counter-Attack&quot;, and Garrett traveled to New York to prepare for &quot;Laffing Room Only&quot; with Olsen and Johnson, but before rehearsals began, she called Parks and proposed marriage. The two were wed on September 8, 1944, four months after their initial meeting. Actor Lloyd Bridges served as best man. Garrett and Parks spent a month honeymooning in Malibu Beach, and they then lived apart for the next two years while pursuing their careers.

A Democrat, she supported Adlai Stevenson&#x27;s campaign in the 1952 presidential election.

Garrett and Parks remained married until his death in 1975. They had two sons, composer Garrett Parks and actor Andrew Parks. Betty Garrett had one granddaughter, Madison Claire Parks, by her son Garrett Parks, and daughter-in-law, Broadway actress Karen Culliver.

==Blacklisting==
Because of their past affiliations with the Communist Party, Garrett and Parks became embroiled with the House Un-American Activities Committee, although only Parks was forced to testify. He willingly admitted that he had been a member of the party and initially refused to name others, but he later did so. Despite that, he found himself on the Hollywood blacklist. Garrett also had trouble finding work but, as the mother of two young sons, she did not mind being unemployed as much as her husband did. Parks formed a highly successful construction business, and eventually the couple owned many apartment buildings scattered throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area. Rather than sell them upon completion, Parks decided to retain ownership and collect rents as a landlord, a decision that proved to be extremely profitable. During that period, the couple occasionally performed in Las Vegas showrooms, summer stock productions, and touring companies of Broadway shows.

==Death==
Garrett died of an aortic aneurysm in Los Angeles on February 12, 2011, at the age of 91. Her body was cremated.

<text>Sabrina Marie Le Beauf (born March 21, 1958) is an American actress best known for her portrayal of Sondra Huxtable on the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. She has voiced the character Norma Bindlebeep on the Nick at Nite animated series &quot;Fatherhood&quot;, a show based on Bill Cosby&#x27;s book of the same name.

==Early life==
Sabrina was born on March 21, 1958, in New Orleans, Louisiana. Eager to leave the strictly segregated lifestyle of 1950s Louisiana behind, her family moved to Los Angeles, California soon after her birth. Her parents divorced, and Sabrina lived with her maternal grandmother, Sce Ethel Holmes, in south central LA until her mother&#x27;s remarriage. When Sabrina was 10 years old, she returned to live with her mother and stepfather in Inglewood, California. Acting interested her from a young age, and she performed in many school plays, starring as Cinderella in elementary school. Sabrina also took on leadership roles, including high school class president at St. Matthias Catholic Girls High School and a Girls&#x27; State delegate.

After high school Sabrina attended UCLA, earning her undergraduate degree in theater. During her time at UCLA she became frustrated by the lack of parts offered to African American students, and in response formed a black students&#x27; theater group to allow them to put on their own shows. In September 1980, she began graduate work at the Yale School of Drama, where she earned her master&#x27;s degree in acting.

==Career==
In 1984, Le Beauf auditioned for the role of the eldest Huxtable daughter Sondra on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;. 26 years old at the time of her audition, she was initially considered too old to play one of the children, being only 10 years younger than Phylicia Rashad, the actress who played her mother, Clair Huxtable. Pop singer Whitney Houston also auditioned for the same part, but refused to sign the contract as she also wanted to become a singer. Her refusal to sign the contract which would bind her to the show and put a singing career on the back burner forced the producers to give the role to Le Beauf. Sabrina went on to play Sondra Huxtable for all eight seasons of &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, from 1984 through the series&#x27; end in 1992. Sondra, a Princeton graduate that went on to marry and start a family of her own, was a popular character on the show; in 1988, 50 million viewers tuned in to watch Sondra give birth to twins, named Winnie and Nelson in honor of Nelson and Winnie Mandela.

During her time on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, Le Beauf also appeared in the series &quot;Hotel&quot; and the TV movie &quot;Howard Beach: Making a Case for Murder&quot;. She also had brief appearances as bridge officer Ensign Giusti on two episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and on the comedy &quot;The Sinbad Show.&quot; Le Beauf also continued her work in the theater, starring as Rosalind in a production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

Currently, Le Beauf is a frequent leading lady performing with the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington, D.C. She recently portrayed Katherine in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; with the Company in D.C. Le Beauf also appeared in the off-Broadway play “LOVE, LOSS AND WHAT I WORE” that ran from 2009 to 2012.

==Personal life==
While performing at the Folger Theater in Washington, Le Beauf met businessman and producer Michael Reynolds in 1987. They married less than one month later, settling in New York. They remained married for over ten years but filed for divorce in 1997, which Le Beauf described as &quot;a mutual decision.&quot;

<text>Garry Michael Monahan (born October 20, 1946) is a Canadian former professional hockey player who played 12 seasons in the National Hockey League. He was the first-ever draft pick in NHL history.

== Career ==
Monahan was selected first overall by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1963 NHL amateur draft of 16-year-old players—the first pick of the NHL&#x27;s first draft. The next season, he played junior B hockey with the St. Michael&#x27;s Buzzers in Toronto before moving up to the junior A Peterborough Petes in the Ontario Hockey Association, where he played from 1964 to 1967. In his final junior year, he turned into a top scorer playing on a line with Mickey Redmond, the league&#x27;s leading goal scorer. Monahan scored 30 goals and 84 points in 47 games on what was otherwise a weak Petes team.

=== Montreal Canadiens ===
He made his NHL debut with the Canadiens in the 1967–68 season, but spent most of the year with Montreal&#x27;s Central Hockey League affiliate, the Houston Apollos. After spending almost the entire 1968–69 season in the American Hockey League with the Cleveland Barons, Monahan was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in June 1969 in the deal where the Canadiens acquired Pete Mahovlich. Monahan saw little ice time and struggled offensively and before the end of the season was traded to the Los Angeles Kings, where the story was the same. In 72 games with the Red Wings and Kings, Monahan scored just three goals and 10 points.

=== Toronto Maple Leafs ===
Before the next season, Monahan was dealt to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the trade where the Kings acquired their future captain and coach, Bob Pulford. Monahan saw much more ice time in Toronto as a defensive forward, playing four full seasons with the Leafs. After the first game of the 1974–75 season, he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks and played there for four years, scoring his NHL career high of 18 goals and 44 points in the 1976–77 season. After his offensive numbers dropped off in his final year in Vancouver, Monahan rejoined the Leafs for the 1978–79 season, scoring just four goals in 62 games. That ended his career in the NHL, where he played 748 games over 12 seasons.

Monahan then went to Japan and played three seasons with Tokyo-based Seibu Tetsudo of the Japan Ice Hockey League, retiring after the 1981–82 season at age 35. Afterward, he spent several years working on Vancouver Canucks radio broadcasts.

<doc id="921348" wikidata="Q738725" url="?curid=921348" title="Pokémon Puzzle Challenge">
<text>Pokémon Puzzle Challenge is a puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Game Boy Color. Released in Japan on September 21, 2000; in North America on December 4, 2000; and in PAL regions on June 15, 2001, it is the second &quot;Pokémon&quot;-themed entry in the &quot;Puzzle League&quot; series. While its Nintendo 64 counterpart &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; is visually based on the &quot;Pokemon&quot; anime, &quot;Puzzle Challenge&quot; instead draws inspiration from the &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; games. The game features multiple modes of play and support for competitive play between two players. &quot;Puzzle Challenge&quot; was later digitally re-released via the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console line on November 6, 2014.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; features gameplay similar to other games in the &quot;Puzzle League&quot; series; players control a two square long cursor that can swap or move blocks around the field. The objective is to remove blocks from the player&#x27;s puzzle grid as new ones appear from the bottom. Placing three or more blocks of the same color in a horizontal or vertical line will cause them to disappear. Players can also perform combos by clearing more than three blocks at once, as well as chains when falling blocks from one clear cause another set of blocks to clear. A game typically ends when the blocks reach the top of the grid, at which point the player loses. In competitive modes, players can perform combos and/or chain clears to cause objects called garbage blocks to fall on their opponent&#x27;s grid, further filling it in an attempt to cause them to lose. Concessions are made due to the game&#x27;s limited screen size: &quot;Puzzle Challenge&quot; features a puzzle grid size of only 6x9 blocks, compared to the 6x12 grids of other &quot;Puzzle League&quot; games, and the opponent&#x27;s grid is not visible, with a small meter instead indicating how close they are to losing.

The game features six primary modes of play. Marathon involves playing infinitely until the grid is filled and the player loses. Challenge is a competitive mode that pits the player against several computer-controlled opponents, framed as the player traveling around the Johto region challenging other Pokémon trainers and gym leaders. Time Zone challenges players to achieve the highest score within a time limit. Line Clear is a stage-based mode in which players must clear a certain number of lines to advance. Puzzle involves clearing specific arrangements of blocks using a limited number of moves. Garbage is an infinite mode similar to Marathon, but with increased difficulty due to garbage blocks frequently appearing on the grid. Using a Game Link Cable, two players can compete in standard versus play, Time Zone, or Line Clear. A training mode is also available.

The game is heavily themed after &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, featuring characters and remixed music from those games. Players can choose between different Pokémon that appear as part of the user interface. At the start of the game, players only have access to Chikorita, Cyndaquil, and Totodile, but can unlock six more Pokémon by completing specific objectives in Challenge mode then defeating their trainer. Four additional Pokémon appear as eggs, which can be hatched and used in Marathon mode after achieving a high score in the other modes.

==Development==
&quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; was developed by Intelligent Systems. It was first announced in Nintendo employee Peter Main&#x27;s &quot;Industry Review&quot; webcast on January 13, 2000, under the name &quot;Pokémon Attack&quot;, similar to prior &quot;Puzzle League&quot; game &quot;Tetris Attack&quot;. The title was later changed to &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; like its Nintendo 64 counterpart before finally settling on &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot;. Nintendo briefly planned to delay the release to 2001, until the delay of &quot;Kirby Tilt &#x27;n&#x27; Tumble&quot; provided an available window in which to release the game. It was released in Japan on September 21, 2000, December 4, 2000, in North America, and June 15, 2001, in PAL regions. A screensaver was released by Nintendo to promote the game.

==Reception==

===Pre-release reception===
When it was first announced, few details were revealed. Upon hearing about it, &quot;IGN&quot; theorized that it was an Americanized version of &quot;Puyo Puyo Sun&quot; with &quot;Pokémon&quot; characters, similar to how &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; was a localization of &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot;. In a preview, &quot;IGN&quot; praised &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; for its gameplay, calling them &quot;nice and simple to appeal to players of all ages and levels&quot;. In another preview, they comment that this idea was a great one to get kids to &quot;stare at even more Pokemon images for even more hours on end&quot;.

===Critical reception===

Since its release, &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; has received positive reception. It holds an aggregate score of 90.20% at GameRankings, making it the 10th best Game Boy Color game and the 300th best video game on Game Rankings. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it a perfect score, while &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave it a nine out of 10. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; nominated it for &quot;best puzzle game&quot; and &quot;best &quot;Pokémon&quot; game&quot;. ultimately losing to &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot; for the former category and &quot;Pokémon Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot; for the latter. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; also listed &quot;Pokémon Puzzle Challenge&quot; as the 13th best Game Boy/Game Boy Color video game, calling the gameplay only second in addictiveness to &quot;Tetris&quot;, ultimately giving the nod to this version of the gameplay over &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; because of a few extra features.

&quot;Game Informer&quot;″s Ben Reeves called it the 12th best Game Boy game. He noted that it beat out &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; for this game&#x27;s increased polish. &quot;Children&#x27;s software &amp; new media revue: Volume 9&quot; called it &quot;addictive&quot;, commenting that those who were not interested in the series would be fine, commenting that it &quot;holds little similarity&quot; to the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Craig Harris called the return of the &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; gameplay &quot;welcome&quot;, commenting that it was &quot;as fun and addictive as it ever was&quot;. However, he criticized its lack of a Puzzle Edit mode, a mode found in the Nintendo 64 counterpart game &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;. He awarded it the Editor&#x27;s Choice award. In a &quot;Pokémon&quot; video game retrospective, fellow &quot;IGN&quot; editor Lucas M. Thomas commented that while it didn&#x27;t bring anything new to the &quot;Tetris Attack&quot; gameplay, it being in a &quot;new, Colorized portable version was enough&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; editor Frank Provo commented that it &quot;does the &quot;Pokémon&quot; license proud&quot;, calling it both &quot;addictive&quot; and praising its overall value. &quot;GamePro&quot; gave it 4.5 stars out of five, awarding it their Editor&#x27;s Choice award. William Schiffmann of the &quot;Associated Press&quot; commented that while it doesn&#x27;t &quot;break any new ground&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon&quot; theme constitutes a &quot;sales gimmick&quot;, fans of &quot;Tetris&quot; would enjoy it.

<text>A comparsa is a group of singers, musicians and dancers that take part in carnivals and other festivities in Spain and Latin America. Its precise meaning depends on the specific regional celebration. The most famous comparsas are those that participate in the Carnival of Santiago de Cuba and Carnaval de Barranquilla in Colombia. In Brazil, comparsas are called carnival blocks, as those seen in the Carnival of Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian carnivals. In the US, especially at the New Orleans Mardi Gras, comparsas are called krewes, which include floats.

== Spain ==

In Spain, the term comparsa can have different meanings depending on the celebration.

=== Cádiz ===
In Cádiz and other parts of Andalusia, comparsas are groups of singers that take part in carnivals, especially the Carnival of Cádiz. They sing comedy routines and the best comparsa is chosen in a contest. Other ensembles can also be found at the carnival, such as chirigotas, coros de carnaval, and cuartetos carnavalescos.

=== Santa Cruz de Tenerife ===
In the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, comparsas are similar to Brazilian carnival blocks.

==Caribbean==
=== Cuba ===

Cuban comparsas originate in the eastern part of the island, specifically in the streets of Santiago de Cuba. Comparsas are groups of singers, musicians and dancers. The singers and musicians form part of the conga, the ensemble that specifically plays the carnival music (a genre also called conga). The rest of the comparsa is formed by dancers with defined costumes and choreographies. Apart from the large Carnival of Santiago de Cuba, there is a carnival in Havana with slightly different customs. Famous comparsas from Santiago include Los Hoyos, Paso Franco, Guayabito, San Agustín, San Pedrito and Alto Pino. Famous comparsas from Havana include La Sultana, El Alacrán and Guaracheros de Regla. 
The unique thing about most Cuban comparsas is that the dancers, musicians, floats, etc. follow one after the other the agreed route through the streets of the cities where they are held.

=== Dominican Republic ===

Dominican Republic comparsas or troupes are dance groups choosing a traditionally festive or allegorical subject to typical Dominican things, organizing a presentation with costumes and mask. Diablo Cojuelo is the most popular character in the Dominican carnival and each province has unique elements.

=== Belize ===
Throughout the country, particularly in Corozal Town and San Pedro Town, comparsas are groups of street dancers which perform carnival season. The dancers dress up in traditional Mayan clothes.

==South America==
=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, comparsas are very similar to the Brazilian carnival blocks, being followed by carriages.

=== Uruguay ===
In Uruguay, a comparsa makes reference to a group of candombe dancers and drummers.

<doc id="921355" wikidata="Q731710" url="?curid=921355" title="1924 Winter Olympics medal table">
<text>The 1924 Winter Olympics, officially known as the I Olympic Winter Games, and known at the time as &quot;Semaine Internationale des Sports d&#x27;Hiver&quot; (&quot;International Winter Sports Week&quot;), was a winter multi-sport event held in Chamonix, France, from 25 January to 5 February 1924. Norway topped the table, collecting seventeen medals in total, including four gold, three of which were won by Thorleif Haug in the Nordic combined and cross-country skiing events. Norway also achieved two podium sweeps, winning all three medals in both the 50 km cross-country skiing and the Nordic combined. This remained a record at the Winter Olympics until 2014.

When it was held, the games were not formally recognised as being the Olympics, but acknowledged that they were held under the &quot;high patronage of the International Olympic Committee&quot;. Partly due to this, varying figures are reported for the number of participants. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) website suggests that 258 athletes from 16 nations participated in 16 events across 9 sports. In contrast, the &quot;Sports-Reference&quot; website lists 313 participants from 19 countries. Bill Mallon, a prominent Olympic Games historian, quotes a figure of 291 competitors in his &quot;Historical Dictionary of the Olympic Movement&quot;. Meanwhile, the official report for the 1924 Summer and Winter Olympics listed 293 athletes from 17 nations.

Finland placed second on the table, collecting four gold medals amongst a total of eleven. Clas Thunberg won five of their medals, achieving a medal in each of the speed skating events he took part in; collecting three gold medals, one silver and one bronze. Eight of the competing nations achieved at least one gold medal, with only Belgium and the hosts, France, medalling without winning a gold medal. One medal was reallocated in 1974; during the games, Thorleif Haug of Norway had been awarded the bronze medal in ski jumping, along with his three gold medals. A Norwegian historian discovered that there had been a scoring error, and an American, Anders Haugen, had actually finished in third place. As Haug had died in 1934, his daughter presented Haugen, aged 83, with his medal.

In the official report, the classification of nations is ranked not by medals, but rather by &quot;points&quot;, which were awarded for each position from first to sixth; not exclusively for gold, silver and bronze. Due to this, Czechoslovakia were included in the table ahead of Belgium, due to two fourth-place finishes, one fifth and one sixth. Italy were also present, in twelfth, for their solitary sixth place.

==Medal table==

The medal table is based on information provided by the IOC and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. The table uses the Olympic medal table sorting method. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next, and then the number of bronze medals. If teams are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically by their IOC country code. Two bronze medals were awarded in the 500 metres speed skating event for the third place tie.

<doc id="921356" wikidata="Q1702004" url="?curid=921356" title="John Varvatos">
<text>John Varvatos (born 1954) is an American menswear designer. He has worked for both Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein, and started his own label in 1999.

==Early life==
The Varvatos family is originally from the village of Poulata on the island of Kefalonia, Greece. Varvatos was born in Detroit and grew up in Allen Park, Michigan.

He attended Allen Park High School. At the age of 16, he got a job selling menswear at the Hughes &amp; Hatcher store in nearby Dearborn.

He attended Eastern Michigan University and the University of Michigan.

==Early career==
After graduating in 1980, he co-founded a menswear store, Fitzgerald&#x27;s Men&#x27;s Store, in Grand Rapids, Michigan.

Varvatos joined Polo Ralph Lauren in 1983. He then moved on to Calvin Klein in 1990 where he was appointed head of menswear design and oversaw the launch of the men&#x27;s collection and the cK brand. During his time at Calvin Klein, Varvatos pioneered a type of men&#x27;s undergarment called boxer briefs, a hybrid of boxer shorts and briefs. Made famous by a series of 1992 print ads featuring Mark Wahlberg, they have been called &quot;one of the greatest apparel revolutions of the century.&quot; Of their creation Varvatos said in 2010, &quot;We just cut off a pair of long johns and thought, this could be cool ...&quot;.

In 1995, Varvatos returned to Ralph Lauren as head of menswear design for all Polo Ralph Lauren brands and created the Polo Jeans Company.

==Career==
In late 1999, Varvatos started his company, debuting his first clothing line at the end of 2000 in New York. The brand now includes belts, handbags, footwear, eyewear, watches and fragrances.

In September 2000, within months of showing his first collection, Varvatos opened a freestanding boutique in SoHo. The collection is currently distributed in John Varvatos boutiques including the 315 Bowery boutique in the space that formerly housed the underground music club CBGB.

2009 saw the launch of &quot;New York Nights…Direct From the Bowery&quot;, a monthly radio show hosted by Varvatos on Sirius XM&#x27;s The Spectrum channel. The show includes songs and interviews from various artists who have influenced Varvatos throughout his career in fashion.

In 2012, Varvatos joined the cast of celebrity mentors on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Fashion Star&quot;, a reality competition series that searched for the next big brand in fashion. In 2013, he saw the release of a limited edition Chrysler 300 in his name. In 2014, he partnered with Monte Lipman&#x27;s Republic label to launch John Varvatos Records, initially signing the Zac Brown Band.

Varvatos credits his early obsession with rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll as the catalyst for his interest in fashion. The ad campaigns for the main collection, shot by Danny Clinch, have featured such musicians and bands such as Iggy Pop, Alice Cooper, Velvet Revolver, Chris Cornell, Dave Matthews, The Roots, and Green Day.

The John Varvatos company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May of 2020. In 2021 Varvatos founded OTD.

In September of 2023, Varvatos was appointed Chief Design Officer of Under Armour, a publicly traded US performance apparel company founded by Kevin Plank.

==Philanthropy==
Music is central to the brand&#x27;s philanthropic efforts, including the Save the Music Foundation and an annual Stuart House benefit. In July 2014 it was announced that Ringo Starr would be modelling for the fall/winter advertising campaign, and that an associated charitable initiative would benefit The Ringo Starr Peace and Love Fund, in aid of the David Lynch Foundation. Commenting, Varvatos said, &quot;Both inner peace and global peace are very important topics to me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;instyle7/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership with Converse==
In 2001, Varvatos and Converse formed a partnership and Varvatos was licensed to create a line of high end sneakers, John Varvatos&#x27; sneakers were usually produced in the style of High Top Chuck Taylor All-Stars. The partnership has since ended, and Varvatos now produces a &quot;Bootleg&quot; line in a similar Chuck Taylor style.

==Awards==
Varvatos had first received accolades from the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) in 2000 when he was honored with the Perry Ellis Award for Menswear. The following year he won the 2001 CFDA&#x27;s Designer of the Year award.

In 2005, Varvatos received the CFDA&#x27;s 2005 Menswear Designer of the Year award at the New York Public Library. The recipients are determined by a selection committee of top magazine editors, journalists, stylists and retailers from around the world. He competed for the top honor along with Ralph Lauren and John Bartlett for his third CFDA win. In 2007, Varvatos was named &quot;GQ&quot;″s Designer of the Year.

<doc id="921360" wikidata="Q323166" url="?curid=921360" title="Sterling Hayden">
<text>Sterling Walter Hayden (born Sterling Relyea Walter; March 26, 1916 – May 23, 1986) was an American actor, author, sailor, and Marine. A leading man for most of his career, he specialized in Westerns and film noir throughout the 1950s, in films such as John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot; (1950), Nicholas Ray&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954), and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;The Killing&quot; (1956). In the 1960s, he became noted for supporting roles, perhaps most memorably as General Jack D. Ripper in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb&quot; (1964).

Hayden&#x27;s success continued into the New Hollywood era, with roles such as Irish-American policeman Captain McCluskey in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972), alcoholic novelist Roger Wade in Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), elderly peasant Leo Dalcò in Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;1900&quot; (1976), and chairman of the board Russell Tinsworthy in &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980). With a distinctive &quot;rapid-fire baritone&quot; voice and an imposing stature at , he had a commanding screen presence in both leading and supporting roles.

Hayden often professed a distaste for acting and used his earnings to finance his numerous voyages as a sailor. He was also a decorated Marine Corps officer and an Office of Strategic Services&#x27; agent during World War II.

==Biography==
===Youth and education===
Hayden was born March 26, 1916, in Upper Montclair, New Jersey, to George and Frances (Simonson) Walter, who named him Sterling Relyea Walter. After his father died, Sterling was adopted at age nine by James Hayden and renamed Sterling Walter Hayden. As a child, he lived in coastal towns of New England.

Hayden dropped out of high school at the age of 16 and took a job as mate on a schooner. His first voyage was to Newport Beach, California, from New London, Connecticut. Later, he was a fisherman on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, ran a charter yacht, and served as a fireman on 11 trips to Cuba aboard a steamer.

He skippered a trading schooner in the Caribbean after earning his master&#x27;s license, and in 1937 he served as mate on a world cruise of the brigantine &quot;Yankee&quot;. After working as a sailor and fireman on larger vessels and sailing around the world several times, he was awarded his first command at age 22, skippering the square rigger &quot;Florence C. Robinson&quot; 7,700 miles from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to Tahiti in 1938. Hayden spoke of his nautical experiences before the monthly meeting of the Adventurers&#x27; Club of New York on March 21, 1940.

===Early Hollywood years===
In 1938, Hayden&#x27;s photo was taken during the annual Gloucester, Massachusetts, Fishermen&#x27;s Race. It went on the cover of a magazine prompting Paramount Pictures to call and offer a screen test. Hayden did a test in New York with Jeanne Cagney, James Cagney&#x27;s sister. Hayden later said:
I was completely lost, ignorant, nervous. But the next thing I knew, Paramount made me a seven-year contract beginning at $250 a week, which was astronomical. I got my lovely old mother and bought a car, and we drove to California... I was so lost then I didn&#x27;t think to analyze it. I said, &#x27;This is nuts, but, damned, it&#x27;s pleasant.&#x27; I had only one plan in mind: to get $5,000. I knew where there was a schooner, and then I&#x27;d haul ass. Hayden went to Paramount in May 1940. The studio dubbed the actor &quot;The Most Beautiful Man in the Movies&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Blond Viking God&quot;.

His first film, &quot;Virginia&quot; (1941), directed by Edward H. Griffith, starred Madeleine Carroll whom he married. He, Griffith and Carroll were reunited in &quot;Bahama Passage&quot; (1941). By December 1941, it was reported that Hayden had quit the movie business and declared, &quot;I&#x27;m no actor! I&#x27;m a sailor.&quot;

===War service===
After his two Paramount film roles, Hayden left Hollywood to fight in World War II. He enlisted in the Army and was sent to Scotland for training, but broke his ankle and was discharged.

Once he recovered from his injury, he chose to re-enlist in the Marine Corps. He was reportedly worried that his fellow Marines would not take him seriously because of his Hollywood fame, and so he adopted the pseudonym &quot;John Hamilton&quot;, which he would carry throughout his war service. In June 1943, he had his name legally changed to John Hamilton.

After selection to and graduation from Marine Corps Officer Candidate School (OCS), Hamilton was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps Reserve and was transferred for duty as an undercover agent with William J. &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Information. Hamilton remained there after it became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS).

He received the Silver Star for gallantry in action in the Balkans and Mediterranean (according to his citation, &quot;Lt. Hamilton displayed great courage in making hazardous sea voyages in enemy-infested waters and reconnaissance through enemy-held areas&quot;), a Bronze Arrowhead device for parachuting behind enemy lines, and a commendation from Yugoslavia&#x27;s Josip Broz Tito. He left active duty on December 24, 1945. Tito awarded him the Order of Merit.

===Return to Hollywood===
He returned to the United States and told the press, &quot;I feel a real obligation to make this a better country – and I believe the movies are the place to do it.&quot; He signed a contract with Paramount and was cast as one of several brothers in an aviation film, &quot;Blaze of Noon&quot; (1947). The studio suspended him when he turned down a role in &quot;The Sainted Sisters&quot;.

Hayden made two films for Pine Thomas Productions which distributed through Paramount: one was a Western, &quot;El Paso&quot; (1949), featuring John Payne; the other was &quot;Manhandled&quot; (1949), a thriller with Dorothy Lamour. In 1950, Hayden appeared in one of his most celebrated roles as the tough-guy gunman Dix Handley in the Academy Award-nominated film &quot;The Asphalt Jungle&quot;.

===Communist Party and HUAC===

Hayden&#x27;s admiration for the Communist partisans he had fought alongside during World War II led him into a brief membership in the Communist Party (CPUSA) from June to December of 1946. In one of his CPUSA assignments, he supported an effort by the Communist-controlled motion picture painters union to absorb other film industry unions.

In September 1947, the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) subpoenaed ten screenwriters and directors (known later as the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;) as part of an investigation into &quot;subversive&quot; elements in the film industry. Immediately, a large group of movie luminaries, including Hayden, formed the Committee for the First Amendment to protest what they perceived as political harassment. In the next few years, as the Second Red Scare gripped the U.S., the HUAC expanded its probe to include all entertainment industry professionals with suspected links, past or present, to the CPUSA. Consequently, Hayden became a target.

Fearful that &quot;his past might cost him his future&quot;, the actor sought the aid of entertainment lawyer Martin Gang in 1950. Gang first sent a letter to FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, asking about &quot;an unnamed client who had joined the Party as a youthful indiscretion, now regretted it, and wanted to clear his name.&quot; Hoover recommended talking to the local FBI people, &quot;so that if anybody subsequently makes a complaint we&#x27;ll know he [the unnamed client] is all right as far as we&#x27;re concerned.
Gang then met with HUAC Chief Counsel Frank Tavenner to work out an acceptable format for Hayden&#x27;s testimony.

Upon Gang&#x27;s advice—and in a decision that would haunt Hayden—the actor agreed to become a &quot;friendly witness&quot; and &quot;name names&quot;. He later said, &quot;the FBI made it very clear to me that, if I became an &#x27;unfriendly witness&#x27;, I could damn well forget the custody of my children. I didn&#x27;t want to go to jail, that was the other thing.&quot; The HUAC subpoenaed Hayden in late March 1951. On April 10, he testified before the Committee in Washington, D.C. that joining the Party was &quot;the stupidest and most ignorant thing I have ever done in my life&quot;. He added that after he quit the Party, actress Karen Morley tried to persuade him to rejoin but he refused.

Due to his decorated war service in the Marines, and his decision to cooperate with the Committee, Hayden received favorable press coverage during this period. But Victor Navasky reminds us that the actor &quot;named his former mistress, Bea Winters (his agent&#x27;s secretary), who had recruited him into the Party. He also named, among others, Robert Lees, Karen Morley, Maurice Murphy, and Abraham Lincoln Polonsky. The result was that he ended up as a hero to the public but a coward to himself&quot;. For decades afterward, Hayden expressed remorse over his testimony. In his autobiography he wrote, &quot;I don&#x27;t think you have the foggiest notion of the contempt I have had for myself since the day I did that thing.&quot; Because of his cooperative testimony, Hayden was &quot;cleared&quot; by the HUAC and avoided the Hollywood blacklist.

===1950s film career===
In the 1951 film &quot;Journey into Light&quot;, Hayden portrayed a minister who doubts his faith. He had a prominent role alongside Bette Davis in &quot;The Star&quot; (1952). He followed these two performances with a series of action films: &quot;Denver and Rio Grande&quot; (1952), a Western for Paramount; &quot;Hellgate&quot; (1952), another Western; &quot;The Golden Hawk&quot; (1952), a pirate swashbuckler for producer Sam Katzman; &quot;Flat Top&quot; (1952), a Korean War drama; and &quot;Fighter Attack&quot; (1953), a World War II film.

By working regularly in leading and supporting roles, Hayden earned a substantial income. In November 1952, at the start of his lengthy divorce from his second wife, Betty Ann de Noon (whom he married in 1947), it was revealed in court proceedings that he made $100,000 in the prior year.

In 1953, he co-starred with Jane Wyman in &quot;So Big&quot;, a melodrama adapted from an Edna Ferber novel. He then returned to medium-budget action films: &quot;Take Me to Town&quot; (1953), a Western with Ann Sheridan; &quot;Kansas Pacific&quot; (1953), a Western for Walter Mirisch; and &quot;Crime Wave&quot; (1954), a film noir.

Hayden had a supporting role in a major studio picture, &quot;Prince Valiant&quot; (1954), playing Sir Gawain. He followed it with a conventional Western &quot;B picture&quot;, &quot;Arrow in the Dust&quot; (1954). At first his next project, &quot;Johnny Guitar&quot; (1954), seemed like just another Western, but this one starred Joan Crawford and was directed by Nicholas Ray. It became a box office hit and a cult favorite. It was financed by Republic Pictures, which used Hayden on several other occasions.

He was cast in more film noirs: &quot;Naked Alibi&quot; (1954) with Gloria Grahame and &quot;Suddenly&quot; (1954) with Frank Sinatra. Then it was action films: &quot;Battle Taxi&quot; (1955), about helicopter rescue teams in the Korean War; &quot;Timberjack&quot; (1955), a Western for Republic; &quot;Shotgun&quot; (1955), a Western with Yvonne de Carlo; &quot;The Eternal Sea&quot; (1955), a World War II naval story; &quot;Top Gun&quot; (1955), a Western for producer Edward Small.

&quot;The Last Command&quot; (1955) was a Republic Pictures film about the Alamo, with Hayden as Jim Bowie. &quot;The Come On&quot; (1956) was a film noir with Anne Baxter. Hayden also began appearing on TV shows such as &quot;Celebrity Playhouse&quot;.

In 1956, Hayden starred in a heist film, &quot;The Killing&quot;, by an up-and-coming filmmaker named Stanley Kubrick. Although &quot;The Killing&quot; fared poorly at the box office, it garnered strong critical praise. Hayden would work again later with Kubrick on &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). 

Notwithstanding his occasional work in acclaimed films, Hayden remained a &quot;B picture&quot; star in the 1950s: &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; (1957), a noir; &quot;5 Steps to Danger&quot; (1957), a mystery film; &quot;Valerie&quot; (1957), a Western &quot;noir&quot;; &quot;Zero Hour!&quot; (1957), a disaster film; &quot;Gun Battle at Monterey&quot; (1957), a Western; &quot;The Iron Sheriff&quot; (1957), a Western for Edward Small; &quot;Ten Days to Tulara&quot; (1958), an adventure film; &quot;Terror in a Texas Town&quot; (1958), a Western.

He also worked frequently on television, appearing on shows such as &quot;Dick Powell&#x27;s Zane Grey Theatre&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot;, and &quot;The DuPont Show of the Month&quot;.

===Travelling===
Hayden often professed distaste for film acting, saying he did it mainly to pay for his schooners and voyages. In 1958, after a bitter divorce from Betty Ann de Noon, Hayden was awarded custody of their four children. In 1959, he defied a court order, which barred him from taking the children out of the U.S., by sailing to Tahiti with all four: Christian, Dana, Gretchen and Matthew.

The crew sailed from San Francisco Bay to Tahiti, where Hayden had planned to film a movie. He also invited along the well-known photographer Dody Weston Thompson to document the trip and to help shoot location choices. Her South Seas folio contains photographs of Hayden&#x27;s 98-foot schooner, &quot;Wanderer&quot;; on-deck photos of life aboard the ship; colorful prints of his children, as well as Tahitian women and children; and unique artifacts on shore. The film never materialized; however, according to Dody&#x27;s notes, &quot;U.S. Camera and Travel&quot; printed her photographs of paradise in 1961. Marin County Superior Court Judge Harold Haley later ordered Hayden to repay Republic Pictures nearly $50,000 to recover the cost of financing the trip.

In 1960, he married Catherine Devine McConnell. They had two sons, Andrew and David, and were married until his death in 1986. McConnell also had a son (Scott McConnell) from her first marriage to Neil McConnell, an heir to Avon&#x27;s founding family.

In November 1960, Hayden said he was a &quot;sailor or writer&quot; rather than an actor. He was still troubled by his HUAC testimony and was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;d had it... One way or another, I felt that I had sold out – or failed – at almost everything in my whole life. It was either turn things around or hang myself.&quot;

In the early 1960s, he rented one of the pilot houses of the retired ferryboat &quot;Berkeley&quot;, docked in Sausalito, California, where he lived while writing his autobiography &quot;Wanderer&quot;, which was first published in 1963.

===Later career===
In 1963, Stanley Kubrick coaxed Hayden out of retirement to play one of his best-known characters, the deranged General Jack D. Ripper in &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964). In that same year, Hayden appeared in &quot;A Carol for Another Christmas&quot; on television.

He bought a canal barge in the Netherlands in 1969, eventually moving it to the heart of Paris and living on it part of the year. He also kept a home in Wilton, Connecticut with his family, and he had an apartment in Sausalito.

Hayden returned to acting with &quot;Hard Contract&quot; (1969), supporting James Coburn and &quot;Loving&quot; (1970), co-starring George Segal and Eva Marie Saint. &quot;I&#x27;ll go back to Hollywood to pick up a dollar, but that&#x27;s all&quot;, he said. &quot;Everything is wrong with that city.&quot;

He went to Europe where he appeared in &quot;Ternos Caçadores&quot; (1970), &quot;Angel&#x27;s Leap&quot; (1971) and &quot;Le grand départ&quot; (1972). He had small but important roles in &quot;The Godfather&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973). He did more films in Europe: &quot;The Final Programme&quot; (1973), &quot;Deadly Strangers&quot; (1975), &quot;Cipolla Colt&quot; (1975) and &quot;1900&quot; (1975). He was offered the role of &quot;Quint&quot; in &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975) but turned it down.

In the 1970s, after his performance in &quot;The Godfather&quot; reintroduced him to American audiences, Hayden appeared several times on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Tomorrow Show&quot; with Tom Snyder. In the interviews, Hayden was sporting a long, scraggly beard. He talked about his career resurgence and how it had funded his travels and adventures around the world. He also appeared on the Canadian sci-fi TV series &quot;The Starlost&quot;, and the American detective show &quot;Banacek&quot;.

He returned to Hollywood for &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot; (1978), &quot;Winter Kills&quot; (1979), &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1980), &quot;9 to 5&quot; (1980), &quot;Gas&quot; (1981), &quot;Venom&quot; (1981) and &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot; (1982).

In 1981, he was arrested for possession of hashish at Toronto International Airport.

Hayden wrote two acclaimed books: an autobiography, &quot;Wanderer&quot; (1963), and a novel, &quot;Voyage&quot; (1976). He said they made him &quot;a lot of money&quot; but he lost most of it to taxes.

In 1983, he appeared in a documentary of his life, &quot;Pharos of Chaos&quot;.

===Family===
Hayden was married to Catherine Devine McConnell from 1960 until his death. They had two children, Andrew and David.

===Death===
Hayden died of prostate cancer in Sausalito in 1986, age 70.

==Military awards==
Hayden received the following awards during World War II:

==References in popular culture==
Hayden, under his nom de guerre Lieutenant John Hamilton, and in his role as an OSS agent, appears as a secondary figure in the 2012 novel &quot;Death&#x27;s Door: A Billy Boyle World War II mystery&quot; by author James R. Benn. Hayden/Hamilton assists in getting protagonist Billy Boyle through German-occupied Italy.

General Gore, portrayed by Nick Young in &quot;Friend of the World&quot;, was juxtaposed with Hayden&#x27;s Ripper from &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.

<doc id="921364" wikidata="Q324679" url="?curid=921364" title="Wienerschnitzel">
<text>Wienerschnitzel is an American fast food chain that specializes in hot dogs and other food products. The brand was founded in 1961 by former Taco Bell employee John Galardi and originally named Der Wienerschnitzel. Despite the name, the company does not ordinarily sell Wiener schnitzel, doing so once as a promotion. Wienerschnitzel locations are found predominantly in California and Texas; others are found in Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Louisiana, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Nebraska and Washington, as well as the U.S. territory of Guam. Outside the United States, there are stores located in Ecuador.

The chain is most notable for the A-frame roofs of its older restaurants, similar to the original structures used by IHOP, Tastee-Freez, Nickerson Farms, and Whataburger. The chain&#x27;s advertising mascot is an anthropomorphized hot dog known as the Delicious One.

Wienerschnitzel sponsors the Wiener Nationals, the &quot;de facto&quot; national dachshund racing championship series in the United States.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;das Wienerschnitzel&quot; is German, and like &quot;Jägerschnitzel&quot; and &quot;Zigeunerschnitzel&quot;, was spelled as one word before the spelling reform of 1996. The restaurant&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of &quot;Wiener&quot; and &quot;Schnitzel&quot;, meaning &quot;Viennese&quot; and &quot;cutlet&quot; respectively.

In American English, &quot;wiener&quot; is a colloquial name for a hot dog, which is sometimes called &quot;Wiener Würstchen&quot; (&quot;little Viennese sausage&quot;) in German. The specific phrase &quot;Wiener Schnitzel&quot; denotes a &quot;Viennese breaded veal cutlet&quot;, something the restaurant chain has served briefly as a limited menu item in 2017.

The chain dropped the (in German wrong) &quot;Der&quot; from its name, shortening it to &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot; in 1977, though many franchises have retained the older name on their restaurants. The restaurant paid homage to its original name in its 2009 marketing slogan, using the word &quot;DERlicious&quot;.

==History==
The first Wienerschnitzel was founded by former Taco Bell employee John Galardi. When Galardi came to California at the age of 19, his first job was from Glen Bell, who would go on to later establish Taco Bell in 1962. Bell initially hired him on a part-time basis for 50 cents an hour at a taco store called Taco-Tia. Eventually, Galardi entered into a partnership agreement to run the store. He offered to sell the store to Galardi for $12,000, later amassing enough money to pay.

A couple of years later, a man wanted to recruit Galardi to start his own restaurant at a location on Pacific Coast Highway in Wilmington, next to one of Bell&#x27;s taco stores. Bell encouraged him to take the offer, but wanted to have Galaradi sell another kind of food; Galardi decided to sell hot dogs. According to Galardi, his wife came up with the name when looking through a cookbook. He was initially skeptical of the name, saying, &quot;I told my wife going home nobody in their right mind would call a company Wienerschnitzel. Three days later, I said, &#x27;Hell, it&#x27;s better than John&#x27;s Hot Dogs.&#x27;&quot; The first location was opened in 1961 as a hot-dog stand at 900 West Pacific Coast Highway, east of Figueroa Street, in the Los Angeles community of Wilmington.

In the late 1980s, Galardi converted several stores in Denver, Colorado, and other Western cities into Hamburger Stand restaurants. Wienerschnitzels now sell Tastee-Freez ice cream, another brand owned by Galardi.

Galardi died of pancreatic cancer on April 13, 2013. His ex-wife, Cynthia Galardi-Culpepper, who previously was a silent partner, assumed the role as CEO and chairwoman after his death. She was the corporation&#x27;s first and only woman in a managerial position, later appearing in reality television series &quot;Undercover Boss&quot; in 2016.

In 2015, the company signed a franchise agreement with International Food Concepts Inc. to plan and open Wienerschnitzel locations in Panama.

==Logo, slogans, and advertising==
Soon after the rebrand, the current Wienerschnitzel logo was created by Saul Bass in 1978.

==The Galardi Group==
The Galardi Group, the parent company of Wienerschnitzel, Tastee-Freez, and Original Hamburger Stand, was formed by John Galardi in 1970.

In 1979, Wienerschnitzel attempted to expand its menus by adding hamburgers. With little success in the 1980s, the company established two chains in 1983, The Original Hamburger Stand and Weldon&#x27;s Gourmet Hamburgers, which was cast off in the 1990s. Some Wienerschnitzel locations were replaced with The Original Hamburger Stands.

By 2003, The Galardi Group became a franchisee of Tastee-Freez and made its products available in Wienerschnitzel and Original Hamburger Stand. Due to increased sales, The Galardi Group later bought Tastee-Freez.

== In popular culture ==
The Descendents&#x27; song &quot;Wienerschnitzel&quot; from their 1981 release &quot;Fat EP&quot; takes the form of a satirical skit in which the band&#x27;s frontman Milo Aukerman orders a meal from the restaurant.

<doc id="921366" wikidata="Q2544353" url="?curid=921366" title="River Wyre">
<text>The River Wyre, in Lancashire, England, flows into the Irish Sea at Fleetwood. It is 28 miles (45 km) long and has a sheltered estuary which penetrates deep into the Fylde peninsula.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Wyre&quot; is of pre-Roman, likely, if specific, Common Brittonic origin. It may be derived from &quot;*wiΣ-&quot;, a form of the element &#x27;, with a basic sense of &quot;flowing&quot;, with the suffix &#x27;.

The River Wyre possibly shares its etymology with other river names, including the Wear in County Durham and the Quair Water in Scotland.

The river&#x27;s name possibly means &#x27;winding river&#x27; in Celtic.

==Geography==

The river rises in the Forest of Bowland in central Lancashire, as two distinct tributaries—the Tarnbrook Wyre and the Marshaw Wyre—whose confluence is near the village of Abbeystead. In 1984, a pumping station, built just below the confluence as part of a water transfer scheme in the 1980s, saw the Abbeystead disaster, an explosion in which 16 people were killed and a further 22 were injured.

From Abbeystead, the river flows south through Dolphinholme to Garstang, where the Lancaster Canal crosses on a small aqueduct. south, at Catterall, it meets its first major tributary, the River Calder. The river then turns westwards, flowing through St Michael&#x27;s on Wyre, where it is joined by its second major tributary, the River Brock. It becomes tidal below the weir at St Michael&#x27;s.

It is crossed by Cartford Bridge, a toll bridge, between Little Eccleston and Out Rawcliffe. A former toll bridge, Shard Bridge, close to Poulton-le-Fylde, has been rebuilt and is now free. The Wyre Estuary Ferry runs between Fleetwood and Knott End, but the ferry to the Isle of Man no longer runs.

Major industry existed at the former ICI Hillhouse site at Burn Naze, close to the estuary of the river. It was originally an alkali works taking brine from mines and wells across the river in and around Preesall. Later processes undertaken on the site included those dealing with vinyl chloride monomer, although this was later moved to Runcorn and ICI activity on the site ceased. Industrial activity by a number of various companies continues by the river, albeit on a much reduced scale.

The area around Burn Naze on the western side of the Wyre Estuary was formerly known as &quot;Bergerode&quot;, believed to be an Old English term for &quot;shallow harbour&quot;, &quot;beor grade&quot;.

From Skippool, just downstream of Shard Bridge, to Fleetwood, the banks of the river form the Wyre Estuary Country Park. Facilities exist on the western bank. The park has its headquarters at Stanah. It has been the recipient of a Green Flag Award.

Fleetwood, at the mouth of the river, was a major fishing port up until the latter part of the 20th century. Wyre Dock was built there between 1869 and 1877. With the decline in the size of the fleet, most of the dock complex has subsequently been converted to a marina and the adjacent Affinity Lancashire outdoor shopping centre.

The river drains a total catchment area of approximately 175 square miles (450 km2). The tidal portion of the river below Cartford Bridge drains a catchment area of approximately .

The Wyre is the only one of the major Lancashire rivers that flows wholly within the ceremonial county; the Ribble starts in North Yorkshire, and the Lune starts in Cumbria.

<text>The International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) is an international human rights non-governmental organization. It is supported by an International Secretariat based in Geneva, Switzerland, and staffed by lawyers drawn from a wide range of jurisdictions and legal traditions. The Secretariat and the Commission undertake advocacy and policy work aimed at strengthening the role of lawyers and judges in protecting and promoting human rights and the rule of law. In addition, the ICJ has national sections and affiliates in over 70 countries.

The ICJ was established in 1953 by German jurists involved in human rights investigations in the Soviet Zone of post-war Germany. It was partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to counter the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, perceived as leftist by American officials. Starting from the 1970s, Secretary-General Niall MacDermot moved the organization away from its association with the CIA.

The current ICJ President is Professor Robert Goldman. Former Presidents include Sir Nigel Rodley (2012–2017), a former member of the UN Human Rights Committee, Professor Pedro Nikken (2011–2012) and Mary Robinson (2008–2011), the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and President of Ireland.

== Current activities ==
The ICJ is active in promoting human rights and the rule of law at the international (e.g. the UN), regional, and national (e.g. JUSTICE in the UK) levels.

The ICJ&#x27;s International Law and Protection Programme works to promote the application of international law to violations of a civil, political, social or economic nature. The focus is on the international obligations of states to respect human rights, protect victims, and hold state and non-state actors accountable for violations and abuses. Specific areas of work include:

* Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers (CIJL);
* Economic, social and cultural rights;
* Business and Human Rights;
* Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity;
* Women&#x27;s Human Rights;
* United Nations Human Rights Mechanisms; and
* Global Security and the Rule of Law.

The ICJ operates regional programmes in Africa, Asia Pacific, Central America, Europe, and the Middle East and North Africa. These focus on promoting and supporting the independence of the judiciary, the rule of law, and human rights issues specific to their local contexts.

== History ==
Born at the ideological frontline of a divided post-war Berlin, the ICJ was established following the 1952 ‘International Congress of Jurists’ in West Berlin . The Congress was organized by the ‘Investigating Committee of Free Jurists (ICJF)’, a group of German jurists committed to investigating human rights abuses carried out in the Soviet Zone of post-war Germany.

During the Congress, delegates decided to make provisions to expand the work of the ICJF to investigate human rights violations in other regions of the world. A five-member ‘Standing Committee of the Congress’ was appointed for this purpose and, in 1953, the Standing Committee created the “International Commission of Jurists (ICJ)” as a permanent organisation dedicated to the defence of human rights through the rule of law.

One of the key areas of concern for the 106 Congress delegates was the case of Dr. Walter Linse, a West German lawyer and the Acting President of the ICJF. Two weeks prior to the start of the Congress, on 8 July 1952, in an apparent attempt to intimidate participants, Dr. Linse was abducted by East German intelligence agents and delivered to the KGB. Despite international condemnation of the abduction, Dr. Linse was executed in Moscow for “espionage” in 1953.

In 1955, the ICJ issued a report entitled Under False Colours in which it stated that &quot;the International Association of Democratic Lawyers and its subsidiaries proceed from a principle which is diametrically opposed to those which form the basis of the Commission’s work. Although it is careful not to pronounce itself openly on the subject, the International Association of Democratic Lawyers defends and supports the principles of Soviet-Communism.&quot;

The ICJ was initially partially funded by the Central Intelligence Agency through the American Fund for Free Jurists, but the CIA&#x27;s role was not known to most of the ICJ&#x27;s members. American founders like Allen Dulles and John J. McCloy conceived it as a counter to the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, which had been set up by leftist French lawyers with connections to the French resistance. Ex-CIA officer Philip Agee considered that the ICJ was &quot;set up and controlled by the CIA for propaganda operations.&quot; The CIA funding became public in 1967, but the organization survived the revelations after a period of reform under Secretary General Seán MacBride, and through Ford Foundation funding. MacBride himself was involved in CIA funding, according to information the US government reported.

From 1970 to 1990, Niall MacDermot was Secretary-General, succeeding Seán MacBride. MacDermot moved the ICJ away from its association with the CIA, to the forefront of the international human rights movement.

In 1978, the ICJ established the Centre for the Independence of Judges and Lawyers (CIJL). It was instrumental in the formulation and adoption of the UN Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary and the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers and its mandate is to work for their implementation.

In 1980, the ICJ received the European Human Rights Prize by Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe.

In 1986, the ICJ gathered a group of distinguished experts in international law to consider the nature and scope of the obligations of States parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. The meeting witnessed the birth of the Limburg Principles on the Implementation of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which continue to guide international law in the area of economic, social and cultural rights.

In the 1990s, a number of important international developments took place as a result of initiatives by the ICJ. These included the UN Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and the recommendation by the Programme of Action of the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna to work on the setting up of an International Criminal Court. This was the direct result of an international conference on impunity, organised by the ICJ under the auspices of the United Nations in 1992, which adopted an appeal asking the Vienna conference to &quot;set up an international penal tribunal…in order to finally break the cycle of impunity&quot;. In November 2006 the ICJ held an international meeting in Yogyakarta for LGBT rights and published The Yogyakarta Principles in March 2007.

The ICJ also initiated the drafting of the set of Principles for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights through Action to Combat Impunity and the Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to a Remedy and Reparation for Victims of Violations of International Human Rights and Humanitarian Law, both under examination at the UN Human Rights Commission and also received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights in 1993.

In April 2013, the ICJ was presented with the Light of Truth Award by the Dalai Lama and the International Campaign for Tibet. The award is presented to organisations who have made outstanding contributions to the Tibetan cause.

== Congresses of the ICJ ==
Every few years, the ICJ convenes a World Congress, where jurists from around the world work together to address a pressing human rights issue and agree normative principles and objectives in a public Declaration. These Declarations have frequently been used by inter-governmental bodies, including the United Nations, as well as bar associations, lawyers, academic centres and other human rights NGOs around the world. For example, the ICJ was responsible for the Declaration of Delhi on the rule of law in 1959, which set out the ICJ&#x27;s conception of the Rule of Law as being dynamic.

The ICJ&#x27;s most recent Declaration, agreed at the ICJ&#x27;s 17th World Congress in December 2012, related to Access to Justice and Right to a Remedy in International Human Rights Systems. The full list of ICJ Congresses is as follows:

<doc id="921376" wikidata="Q5445882" url="?curid=921376" title="Festung Warschau">
<text>In the German language, Festung Warschau (&quot;Fortress Warsaw&quot;) is the term used to refer to a fortified and well-defended Warsaw. In the 20th century, the term was in use on three occasions during World War I and World War II. It was used when the Germans threw back the Russian advance in 1914, where Warsaw came within distance of the fighting in October. The term resurfaced during the September 1939 German invasion of Poland. Later in the second war, the term resurfaced between September 1944 and January 1945, when the retreating Germans tried to establish a defense in the city against the advancing Soviet Union.

==1939==
During the invasion of Poland in 1939 the German troops reached the outskirts of Warsaw on 9 September. The Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) assumed that the unfortified city damaged by countless terror bombing raids would be taken by German motorized units without any resistance and issued a press and radio release stating that the capital of Poland was taken. However, the German motorized assault was defeated and the advancing troops were forced to retreat with heavy casualties. From 8 September the city started to be referred to as &quot;Fortress of Warsaw&quot; in German broadcasts, which was to justify the aerial bombardment of civilian targets.

The forces of the defenders, composed initially of only several battalions and various units of second-line troops, were soon strengthened by the soldiers of the Armies &quot;Poznań&quot; and &quot;Pomorze&quot; that reached the city in the aftermath of the Battle of Bzura. The Germans laid a siege to the city and started shelling it with heavy artillery located in the outskirts. However, the defending troops managed to defeat all assaults and until the end of September the Germans could not manage to break into the city.

After three weeks of constant aerial and artillery bombardment and assaults, the situation of the civilian inhabitants of Warsaw became dire. Food, water and medicine shortages as well as the Luftwaffe strafing inhabitants and refugees grouped within the city caused Warsaw&#x27;s civilian authorities to request a cease-fire. Warsaw President Stefan Starzyński and Gen. Walerian Czuma, commander of the Warsaw garrison, decided that further resistance, although possible, would only expose the civilians to unnecessary hardship and signed the capitulation on 28 September 1939. The German text of the capitulation treaty as well as German propaganda used the term &quot;Festung Warschau&quot; to suggest that the failures of the Wehrmacht were due to heavily fortified terrain they had to cross.
Warsaw, as a former Russian fortress, had several older fortifications, e.g. a ring of forts around the city and a citadel, built between 1835 and 1905.

==1944==
By 1944, the German Eastern Front&#x27;s situation became hopeless. Adolf Hitler who took over personally many duties in the OKW and OKH ordered the &quot;no step back&quot; policy in an attempt to halt the Soviet offensives which could not be contained by open field battle anymore. Following this policy, several cities were declared &quot;Festungen&quot; (&quot;Fortresses&quot;) and were to be held by the German army at all costs, even if surrounded and with no hope to break the siege. Examples of this policy were the Festung Stalingrad and Festung Kiev.

Later in the war, the &quot;Festung&quot; concept that was to be illustrated by the propaganda film &quot;Kolberg&quot; which reminds of Kolberg&#x27;s defense against Napoleon in 1807, was also applied to German cities like Königsberg, Breslau, Frankfurt (Oder) and Berlin. Often even the civil population was supposed to support the rather suicidal attempts of defense, as the cities were largely destroyed in the course of the fights.

On 27 July 1944, Adolf Hitler ordered the &quot;Festung Warschau&quot; to be created and defended at all cost. The same day the governor of the General Government, Hans Frank, called for 100,000 Polish men between the ages of 17–65 to arrive at several gathering places in Warsaw the following day. They were to be employed at construction of fortifications for the Wehrmacht in and around the city. This move was viewed by the Armia Krajowa as an attempt to neutralize the underground forces, and the underground urged Warsaw inhabitants to ignore it. Fearing that the city would be turned into ruins and share the fate of Stalingrad and Kiev, General Tadeusz Bór-Komorowski ordered Operation Tempest to be started in Warsaw, which resulted in the Warsaw Uprising that lasted from August through September.

After the Uprising, during which the Soviets troops had arrived near the Vistula, the Germans razed the city to the ground and continued the construction of concrete bunkers that were to defend &quot;Festung Warschau&quot; against the Red Army for four months. However, when the Soviets finally crossed the Vistula on 17 January 1945, the city was captured in several hours with little resistance from the remaining German garrison. The Chief of the Operational Branch of the German Army General Staff (Generalstab des Heeres), Colonel Bogislaw von Bonin, gave permission for the retreat of German Heeresgruppe A from Warsaw on 16 January 1945, throughout the Soviet Vistula-Oder Offensive and was imprisoned on 19 January 1945 by the Gestapo at Flossenbürg concentration camp and Dachau concentration camp as he rejected a direct command of Adolf Hitler by this action.

<doc id="921379" wikidata="Q3611909" url="?curid=921379" title="All-American Canal">
<text>The All-American Canal is an aqueduct, located in southeastern California. It conveys water from the Colorado River into the Yuma Project, the Imperial Valley, and to nine cities. It is the Imperial Valley&#x27;s only water source, and replaced the Alamo Canal, which was located mostly in Mexico. The Imperial Dam, about northeast of Yuma, Arizona, on the Colorado River, diverts water into the All-American Canal, which runs to just west of Calexico, California, before its last branch heads mostly north into the Imperial Valley. Smaller canals branching off the All-American Canal move water into the Yuma Valley and the Imperial Valley. These canal systems irrigate up to of crop land and have made possible a greatly increased crop yield in this area, originally one of the driest on earth. It is the largest irrigation canal in the world, carrying a maximum of . Agricultural runoff from the All-American Canal drains into the Salton Sea.

The All-American Canal runs parallel to the Mexico–California border for several miles. With over 500 people having drowned in the canal since its completion, it has been called &quot;the Most Dangerous Body of Water in the U.S.&quot;

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued an advisory for any fish caught in the All-American Canal due to elevated levels of mercury, PCBs, and selenium.

==History==
The All-American Canal was authorized along with Hoover Dam by the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act and built in the 1930s by the United States Bureau of Reclamation and Six Companies, Inc. Its design and construction was supervised by the Bureau&#x27;s then chief designing engineer, John L. Savage, and was completed in 1942.

In 2016, the canal was designated as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

==Operations==

=== Irrigation ===
The Bureau of Reclamation owns the canal, but the Imperial Irrigation District operates it. Water for the canal is diverted at the Imperial Diversion Dam. The All-American Canal feeds, from east to west, the Yuma Main Canal, the Coachella Canal, East Highline Canal, Central Main Canal, and the Westside Main Canal. These six main branches of the canal and a network of smaller canals gradually reduce the flow of the All-American Canal until it ends at a small drop in the western Imperial Valley where it drains into the Westside Main Canal. The main canal is long, with a total drop of , a width of and a depth of . The canals get smaller as they run west because they carry less water.

=== Power ===
Eight hydroelectric power plants have been constructed along drops in the All-American Canal system. Drops 1 through 5, Pilot Knob, and East Highline are located on the All-American Canal. Two other power plants, Double Weir and Turnip, are located on the Central Main Canal and Westside Main Canal branches, respectively. The power plants are all relatively small and have a combined capacity of 58 MW. Electricity generation is dictated by water delivery needs. There is also a 7.2 MW pumped storage plant at Senator Wash Dam. Water from the Senator Wash Reservoir is released when water needs exceed flows at Parker Dam.

=== Runoff ===
Runoff from the farmland irrigated by the All-American Canal make up most of the flows in the Alamo River and New River, both of which drain into the Salton Sea, now providing most of its water. The rest is from smaller rivers and drainage systems. Historically, the Salton Sea had been periodically flooded by extreme Colorado River floods and usually dried up before being reflooded. If not for the All-American Canal, the Salton Sea would have likely dried up long ago. The system transports silt, selenium and salts from the Colorado River into the Salton Sea. Because there is no outlet to the ocean, these salts and minerals are concentrated by evaporation.

==The All-American Canal Lining Project==
Approximately was lost annually by seepage from the All-American Canal, especially from the point where the canal crosses the great Algodones Dune Field. About 90% of this seepage entered Mexico. At first this seepage caused widespread flooding, but Mexicali Valley residents and businesses built drainage and pumping systems to recover the seepage. Mexicali Valley agriculture became reliant upon this seepage for irrigation. As water use increased in both rural and urban areas, this seepage became an issue of concern. The All-American Canal Lining Project, a part of California&#x27;s Colorado River Water Use Plan, lined of the canal to prevent seepage. In 2006, a Mexicali business and civic organization and two California environmental non-profits challenged the lining project in US federal court on the basis that it violated the water rights of Mexican water users and violated US environmental statutes due to the seepage&#x27;s effects on the nearby Andrade Mesa Wetlands. A rider in the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 required the completion of the lining project, however, and the lawsuit was rendered moot. The Imperial Irrigation District built a parallel canal along the designated section of the original canal, and the water flow was rerouted into the new lined canal. Construction began in 2007 and was completed in 2009.

==Drowning deaths==
Over 500 people have drowned in the All-American Canal since its completion due to deep, cold water, steep sides that make escape difficult, and swift currents that can reach . Many of those killed are undocumented immigrants attempting to cross the canal after passing the U.S.–Mexico border. Deaths peaked at 31 in 1998 after increased border security measures in San Diego forced migrants to cross the border in other areas. In 2011 the Imperial Irrigation District allocated $1.1 million in order to install lines with lifesaving buoys across the canal in 105 locations. Bilingual signs reading &quot;Warning: Dangerous Water&quot; were also installed in 1,414 locations along the canal.

<text>Ana Gasteyer (; born May 4, 1967) is an American actress, comedian and singer. She is most notable for her tenure as a cast member on the NBC sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; from 1996 to 2002. She has since starred in such sitcoms as ABC&#x27;s &quot;Suburgatory,&quot; TBS&#x27;s &quot;People of Earth&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;American Auto&quot;, and the film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;.

== Early life ==

Gasteyer was born in Washington, D.C., the daughter of Mariana (née Roumell), an artist, and Phil Gasteyer, a lobbyist who later became the mayor of Corrales, New Mexico. Gasteyer grew up on Capitol Hill, three blocks from the Capitol. Her maternal grandparents were Romanian and Greek. As a child, Gasteyer was friends with Amy Carter, daughter of then-president Jimmy Carter, whom she bonded with through the violin. She has spoken of how she spent the night at the White House as a child, watched &quot;Star Wars&quot; with the Sadat Family, and saw President Carter &quot;laughing hysterically&quot; as he watched Dan Aykroyd portray him on SNL.

She graduated from Sidwell Friends School. She enrolled as a music major at Northwestern University, and graduated from Northwestern University School of Communication in 1989.

== Career ==
Gasteyer developed comedy experience with the Los Angeles improv – sketch comedy group The Groundlings. She played small roles on &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (as a doomed customer of The Soup Nazi) as well as on the shows &quot;Party of Five&quot;, &quot;Frasier&quot;, &quot;Hope &amp; Gloria&quot;, and &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;. In 1996, she joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live.&quot; Among her most popular characters on the show were high school music teacher Bobbie Mohan-Culp; Margaret Jo McCullen, the National Public Radio host of &quot;Delicious Dish;&quot; folk singer Cinder Calhoun who sang feminist songs at Lilith Fair, and her impressions of Martha Stewart and Celine Dion. In 2000, she and Chris Parnell auditioned to succeed Colin Quinn as co-anchors of the news parody segment &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, but the positions went to Tina Fey and Jimmy Fallon.

After six seasons, Gasteyer left &quot;SNL&quot; in 2002. Subsequently, she appeared in various television programs, films and stage productions. In 2004, Gasteyer played the mother of the main character Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) in the feature film &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, written by &quot;SNL&quot; castmate Tina Fey. The film also featured other former &quot;SNL&quot; castmates, including Fey, Tim Meadows, and Amy Poehler. Gasteyer appeared in the 2005 Showtime musical film &quot;Reefer Madness&quot; as Mae, the doomed girlfriend of Jack and owner of the Reefer Den.

Gasteyer starred in a revival of &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; on Broadway as Mrs. Peachum, along with Jim Dale, Alan Cumming, and Cyndi Lauper. The production ran from March 24 through June 25, 2006.

On June 24, 2005, Gasteyer originated the role of Elphaba in the Chicago sit-down production of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;, alongside Kate Reinders as Glinda. The production opened July 13, 2005. Gasteyer was nominated for a Jefferson Award for her performance. She played her final performance on January 22, 2006, replaced by her standby Kristy Cates. She later reprised the role in the Broadway production from October 10, 2006, through January 7, 2007, replacing Eden Espinosa.

On April 12, 2007, the media announced that Gasteyer had joined the cast of the then-new musical &quot;Writing Arthur&quot; for the 2007 New Works Festival for TheatreWorks in California, which ran from April 14 to 22. Gasteyer performed in Chicago in the Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Passion&quot; at Chicago Shakespeare Theater from October 2, 2007, through November 11, 2007.

She was originally cast as Gloria in the 2008 Encores! Summer Series production of &quot;Damn Yankees,&quot; but due to injury during rehearsals, she was replaced by Megan Lawrence. Gasteyer took part in the reading of the Broadway musical version of &quot;The First Wives Club&quot; in January 2009.

She starred as Kitty Dean in the Broadway play &quot;The Royal Family&quot; which began performances at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre on September 15, 2009, and officially opened on October 8, 2009. The show concluded its run on December 13, 2009. Gasteyer also starred as Frisco Kate Fothergill in the City Centers Encores! production of &quot;Girl Crazy,&quot; running from November 19 to 22, 2009.

She returned to &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for a special Mother&#x27;s Day episode on May 8, 2010, and for another Mother&#x27;s Day episode on May 11, 2012.

Gasteyer appeared in season eight of &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; as Larry David&#x27;s girlfriend.

From 2011 to 2014, Gasteyer co-starred as Sheila Shay on the ABC comedy series &quot;Suburgatory,&quot; and, as of March 2013, she was a spokeswoman for the Weight Watchers diet plan. Gasteyer has been a guest narrator at Disney&#x27;s Candlelight Processional at Walt Disney World in 2014, 2015, 2017, and 2021.

In 2014, taking advantage of her training as a singer, Gasteyer recorded and released &quot;I&#x27;m Hip,&quot; an album of jazz standards including &quot;One Mint Julep&quot;. In 2015, she played Mimi Schwinn in the New York City Center &quot;Encores!&quot; Off-Broadway revival of the musical &quot;A New Brain&quot;, also appearing on the cast recording.

From 2016 to 2017, Gasteyer had a starring role on TBS&#x27;s cult hit &quot;People of Earth&quot; as the leader of an alien abductee support group.

In October 2019, she released the holiday album &quot;Sugar &amp; Booze&quot; which was later accompanied by an Audible Original comedy piece titled &quot;Holiday Greetings from Sugar and Booze&quot;, featuring Gasteyer along with Maya Rudolph, Oscar Nunez, and Patti LuPone. Gasteyer later appeared as a contestant on the second season of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Tree&quot;.

In February 2020, it was announced that Gasteyer will play Katherine Hastings in the NBC comedy pilot &quot;American Auto&quot;, written by Justin Spitzer. The show&#x27;s production was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and skipped the step to premiere in the 2021–2022 broadcast season. In September and October 2020, she voiced a red panda named Nut in an adult animated series titled &quot;Magical Girl Friendship Squad&quot;.

In 2024, Gasteyer starred as Queen Aggravain alongside Sutton Foster, Will Chase, Brooks Ashmanskas, Daniel Breaker, and Michael Urie in a Broadway revival of &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;. The show subsequently played a limited run in Los Angeles with the Center Theatre Group following its Broadway closing. The Broadway production ran from July through November 2024 at the Hudson Theatre. It played 128 performances.

<text>The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is an all-breed conformation show, held annually in the New York metropolitan area.

The Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show is one of a handful of benched shows in the United States. Dogs are required to be on display in their assigned locations (show benches) during the entire show except when shown in the ring, groomed for showtime, or taken outside to urinate or defecate. This type of presentation allows spectators and breeders alike to have an opportunity of seeing all the entered dogs. (In the more common unbenched shows, dogs are required to be present only at assigned ring times.)

The event has long been associated with the various incarnations of New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden, which hosted the event nearly uninterrupted from 1877 to 2020. Its hosting streak was disrupted in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic; from 2021 to 2024, the event was delayed to a late-Spring/early-Summer scheduling and held at outdoor venues instead, with the 2021 and 2022 editions held at the grounds of the Lyndhurst mansion in Tarrytown, New York, and the 2023 and 2024 editions held at Billie Jean King National Tennis Center and Arthur Ashe Stadium in Queens. In 2025, the event returned to Madison Square Garden and its traditional scheduling for the first time since 2020.

The logo of both the Westminster Kennel Club and its Dog Show is based on a steel engraving by artist J. Wellstood of Sensation, a Pointer brought over from England by the organization in 1876 primarily for breeding purposes.

==History==

The first Westminster show took place on May 8, 1877, making it third only to the Kentucky Derby and Kentucky Oaks in terms of continuously held sporting events in the United States. (All three events were held despite the Great Depression, World War, and pandemic years.) The show originated as a show for gun dogs, primarily Setters and Pointers, initiated by a group of hunters who met regularly at the Westminster Hotel at Irving Place and Sixteenth Street in Manhattan. They decided to create a kennel club called the Westminster Kennel Club specifically to hold a dog show. The prizes for these first shows included such items as pearl-handled pistols, which were of use to the hunters and terriermen who worked these dogs in the field.

Held at Gilmore&#x27;s Garden (Madison Square Garden) the Westminster show drew over 1,200 dogs. It proved so popular that it took four days instead of the three days originally scheduled. The club donated proceeds from the fourth day to the ASPCA for creation of a home for stray and disabled dogs.

The Westminster Kennel Club predates the formation of the American Kennel Club by seven years and became the first club admitted to the AKC after AKC&#x27;s founding in 1884. Breed parent clubs (e.g., the Collie Club of America) create the standards for judging their breeds, with the AKC administering the rules about shows and judging.

Dogs are judged by how closely they conform to a written description of the ideal specimen of that breed (the breed standard). While many breeds no longer need to perform their original jobs and are bred mostly for companionship, they are still judged on their innate ability and physical makeup to perform their original jobs. Standards also include items that seem somewhat arbitrary such as color, eye shape, tail carriage, and more.

Today, Westminster takes place over two days and nights. During the day, the dogs compete against other dogs of the same breed at Piers 92 and 94. Each Best of Breed winner (BOB) advances to the Group level. There are seven groups: Sporting, Hound, Working, Terrier, Toy, Non-Sporting, and Herding. Group competition occurs during the evenings. The seven Group winners advance to Best in Show, the final round of the show. During Best in Show, also held at Madison Square Garden, a judge will select one of judging them as the Best In Show winner. Since 2014, the show allowed mixed-breed dogs to compete in an agility event.

Westminster has held competitions in Junior Showmanship for handlers ages 9–18 since 1934. The eight finalists all receive scholarships for post-secondary schooling. The Club, through the Westminster Kennel Foundation also awards veterinary school scholarships for students from six schools yearly.

The winning dog becomes &quot;America&#x27;s Dog&quot; for the coming year. The reign begins with a media tour on the day following the show. Following the tour, the winner makes appearances on nearly all television network morning shows and visits the Observation Deck at the Empire State Building. The New York Stock Exchange also invites the winner and related handlers to ring the opening bell.

In October 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, the 2021 show was postponed from its usual scheduling to June, and re-located from Madison Square Garden to the grounds of the historic Lyndhurst mansion in Tarrytown, New York, north of Midtown Manhattan. Organizers stated that the changes were intended to allow for the event to be held in compliance with public health guidance. No outside spectators were admitted. On December 30, 2021, citing the current surge of Omicron variant in New York City, it was announced that the 2022 show—initially scheduled for January 24–26—had been postponed indefinitely. On February 8, 2022, it was announced that the 2022 show would once again be postponed to June and held at Lyndhurst.

The 2023 edition moved to a May scheduling, and was relocated to the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, with Arthur Ashe Stadium serving as the main venue. For the first time, a dock jumping competition was also added to the event. After two years in Queens, it was announced in June 2024 that the show would return to Madison Square Garden and its traditional February scheduling in 2025, ahead of its 150th anniversary in 2026.

== Requirements for entry ==

In 1884, the AKC began requiring that all dog participants be registered with the AKC and recognized for conformation show competition. In 2016, there are 199 breeds and varieties eligible for Westminster. 
Because of the show&#x27;s popularity and prestige, starting in 1992 the AKC limited entries by requiring that dogs must have already earned their breed championship before appearing at Westminster. Later, the Westminster Kennel Club amended that rule; dogs only need one of the two required &quot;major wins&quot; towards their championship titles. However, they do not need to be finished champions to enter.

Since 2020, the requirement that a dog be a Champion was reinstated by the Westminster Kennel Club and the entry limit decreased to 2,500. The conformation show was also spread over three days instead of the traditional two days, due to the unavailability of one of the usual venues for the event.

The top five dogs in each breed (based on breed points earned in AKC conformation showing through October 31 of the preceding year), as well as the Best of Breed winner from each breed&#x27;s national specialty show, receive printed invitations by mail and are eligible for early entry. After that entry deadline passes, other dogs with at least one &quot;major win&quot; may enter, up to a cut-off entry total of 2800 dogs.

There is no prohibition against a winner competing again in future Westminster shows. Seven dogs have won multiple Westminster championships: six dogs in consecutive years (including Warren Remedy, the only three-time champion of the event), and one dog in non-consecutive years. Since 1972, however, there have been no repeat winners.

Dogs of all breeds, including mutts, may participate in the show&#x27;s agility competition. There is a title for the highest-ranking mutt in the agility round—the &quot;All American Dog.&quot;

== Winning breeds ==
Through the 134th Westminster Show (February 2010), Best in Show has been won by the Terrier group 45 out of the 103 times that the prize has been awarded since 1907, more than twice as many wins as any other group. The single breed that has won the most is the Wire Fox Terrier, which has won 15 times. Two of the most popular dog breeds in the United States—the Labrador Retriever and Golden Retriever—have never won Best in Show. The dogs are marked for Best in Breed and then proceed to compete in Best in Group, and finally in the grand prize competition of Best in Show.

* Terrier group: 46
* Sporting group: 18
* Working group: 15
* Toy group: 11
* Non-Sporting group: 10
* Hound group: 6
* Herding group: 3

The oldest dog to win Best in Show was a Sussex Spaniel named &quot;Ch. Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee&quot; (a.k.a. Stump), at ten years of age in 2009. The youngest dog to win was a Rough Collie named &quot;Laund Loyalty of Bellhaven&quot;, at nine months old in 1929. One dog, a Smooth Fox Terrier named &quot;Ch. Warren Remedy&quot; won Best in Show three times (1907–1909), and six other dogs have won twice. Males have won Best in Show 68 times as opposed to females who have won 35 times.

==Announcers==
For many years, Roger A. Caras was known as &quot;the Voice of Westminster&quot; for providing the narration for the breed descriptions during the show.

In 2001, Michael J. LaFave was named show announcer at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. He was replaced by Jim Fagan in 2010 but returned in 2011.

==Television==

CBS Sports covered the event from the late 1960s to the 1980s as part of its &quot;CBS Sports Spectacular&quot; anthology series.

From 1984 until 2003, Universal&#x27;s USA Network broadcast the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. Following Universal&#x27;s acquisition by General Electric in 2003 to form NBC Universal, the coverage (as with all other sporting events carried by the channel) became a presentation of NBC Sports, but the broadcast continued to air on USA Network. From 2006 through 2016, the Monday coverage was aired on sister channel CNBC due to conflicts with &quot;WWE Raw&quot; on USA. During USA&#x27;s coverage from 1990 to 2016, David Frei co-hosted the event with partners, Al Trautwig (1990–1991, 1993), Bud Collins (1992), Joe Garagiola (1994–2002), Mark McEwen (2003–2004), Lester Holt (2005, 2007–2008), Debbye Turner (2006), Mary Carillo (2009, 2011–2016), and Tamron Hall (2010). Frei provided the commentary of the 140th event for his final time.

On July 28, 2015, Fox Sports announced that it had acquired rights to the event under a 10-year deal beginning in 2017. For the first three years, the coverage was split between FS1 and then-sister channel Nat Geo Wild. For 2017, daytime breed judging was hosted by Justin Kutcher, Paula Nykiel and Jason Hoke and primetime coverage was hosted by Chris Myers and Gail Miller Bisher. In 2018, daytime breed judging was hosted by Kutcher, Kimberly Meredith, and Don Sturz, while Hoke joined the evening booth of Myers and Bisher. In 2019, Sturz and Hoke swapped places, with Sturz moving to the evening booth while Hoke joined the daytime booth.

After the sale of the &quot;National Geographic&quot; channels to Disney as part of its acquisition of 21st Century Fox (which excluded the Fox broadcast network, news, and national sports properties, which were retained by a new entity known as Fox Corporation), FS2 replaced Nat Geo Wild as the secondary broadcaster of the event in 2020. John Strong replaced Kutcher as host for daytime breed judging and Fox hosts were Myers, Bisher, and Sturz. For 2021, the agility competition and the final night of judging aired on Fox for the first time. For 2022, Sturz was named Judge for Best in Show, and Hoke will return to the main booth.

The 2024 broadcast team consisted of 2016 champion handler Valerie Nunes Atkinson alongside Hoke and Myers, with Jenny Taft and Jamie Little as reporters. Daytime judging coverage is by Strong, Meredith, Johan Becerra-Hernandez, and Alison Williams.

<text>Geoffrey Louis Owens (born March 18, 1961) is an American actor known for his role as Elvin Tibideaux on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; (1985–1992). He is the son of the United States Congressman Major Owens.

==Early life and education==
Owens was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Ethel (née Werfel), a music and literature teacher, and Major Owens, a librarian who later went on to serve in the New York State Senate and the United States House of Representatives. He has two brothers and two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage. Owens attended the High School of Performing Arts for a year and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Yale University in 1983.

==Career==
One of Owens&#x27;s earliest roles was in an Arcata High School theater performance where he played the title role in a performance of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. This initial outing was what galvanized him to become an actor later in life.

In 1985, Owens made his television debut on the second season of the NBC sitcom &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; as Sondra Huxtable&#x27;s boyfriend Elvin Tibideaux. Tibideaux married Sondra and became a regular character in 1987 and appeared on the series until it ended in 1992.

He has appeared as a lawyer on season 6 episode 1 of &quot;Elementary&quot;. He has appeared as himself on the FX sitcom &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;. In the season 3 episode &quot;The Gang Gets Invincible&quot; he appears at the Philadelphia Eagles&#x27; public tryouts as an actor pretending to be Donovan McNabb doing a plug for McDonald&#x27;s but the gang recognize him as &quot;that guy from &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;&quot; who played &quot;Sondra&#x27;s husband ... &quot;. In the season 7 episode &quot;Frank&#x27;s Pretty Woman&quot; he plays the same character, this time pretending to be Tiger Woods. Dee, however, recognizes him and calls him out as the guy who pretended to be McNabb at the Eagles&#x27; tryouts. He then admits he is not Tiger Woods but then claims to be actor Don Cheadle. In the second episode of Season 15, &quot;The Gang Makes Lethal Weapon 7&quot;, he appears as the same character, but is given the role to play as Roger Murtaugh in the gang’s Lethal Weapon 7 movie.

In 2007, Owens guest-starred as Eddie&#x27;s father in the &quot;That&#x27;s So Raven&quot; episode &quot;The Way We Were&quot;. He also appeared on the season premiere of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Las Vegas&quot;.

In 2008, he appeared alongside Paul Campbell, Andy Griffith, Doris Roberts, Liz Sheridan, Marla Sokoloff and Juliette Jeffers in the romantic comedy &quot;Play The Game&quot;.

In 2010, he appeared on ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;The Secret Life of the American Teenager&quot; as a court-appointed mediator. He also appeared on the ABC show &quot;FlashForward&quot; in the episode &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;, playing a researcher.

In 2011, Owens portrayed the role of Casca at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in its Free-For-All production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

In 2015, he portrayed an obstetrician on the NBC drama series &quot;The Slap&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Ritchie&quot;.

In 2017, he portrayed an assistant dean on the FOX drama series &quot;Lucifer&quot;, in an episode entitled &quot;Deceptive Little Parasite&quot;.

In 2018, photos of Owens working in a Trader Joe&#x27;s were published by &quot;The Daily Mail&quot;, which many characterized as &quot;job shaming.&quot; Owens agreed with the &quot;job shaming&quot; characterization, eventually quitting due to the unwanted attention. The story led producer Tyler Perry to offer Owens a ten-episode role in &quot;The Haves and the Have Nots&quot;. Owens also booked a guest-starring role on &quot;&quot; and supporting roles in the films &quot;Fatale&quot; and &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;. In 2024, Owens revealed ongoing career and financial challenges. 

In 2020, he starred in the film &quot;Impossible Monsters&quot;, where he played a police detective. &quot;I’m usually cast as dads, lawyers, doctors, teachers, and so to play a detective it was really fun,&quot; he said. He played a supporting role in &quot;Power Book II: Ghost&quot;.

=== Teaching ===

He has taught acting and Shakespeare at Columbia University, Yale, Stella Adler Studio of Acting, the Adult School of Montclair and Pace University.

<doc id="921395" wikidata="Q1435485" url="?curid=921395" title="Axé">
<text>Axé () is a popular music genre originated in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil in the 1980s, fusing different Afro-Caribbean genres, such as marcha, reggae, and calypso. It also includes influences of Brazilian music such as frevo, forró and carixada. The word Axé comes from the Yoruba term &quot;àṣẹ&quot;, meaning &quot;soul, light, spirit or good vibrations&quot;. Axé is present in the Candomblé religion, as &quot;the imagined spiritual power and energy bestowed upon practitioners by the pantheon of orixás&quot;. It also has ties with the Roman Catholic Church and the Lenten season, which represents the roots of Bahian Carnival.

==Roots and History of Axé==
Numerous different African cultures were brought to Brazil due to slavery, which lead to the creation of the vibrancy and complexity of Brazil and its culture. Therefore, several of Brazil&#x27;s popular music styles have derived from African cultures and African diasporic influences, including samba, lambada, funk and axé. There is a tendency by Brazilian musicians to draw inspiration and utilize themes, imagery and symbolic symbols from the Candomblé religion and its African roots. Artists such as Gilberto Gil, Vinicius de Moraes, Caetano Veloso, Sergio Mendes, Daniela Mercury, Carlinhos Brown, among others, have all used African culture, religion and symbols as inspirations and lyrics of their songs.

Following the abolition of slavery in 1888, the celebration of Bahian Carnival was used similarly to Candomblé religion as it celebrated the African heritage, honoring the ancestral spirits and African royalty. Even before this, Catholicism had its roots embedded in Carnival. For example, the Bahian Carnival focuses on specifically celebrating the death and resurrection of Jesus as it leads to the Lenten season in the Roman Catholic calendar. Along with this, Catholic Masses are given ahead of the carnival to wish people positive axé spirit throughout the lenten season. While some perform in Catholic traditions, Candomblé rituals are done as well. They offer foods and liquids as a gift for the orixás for good tidings and a fortunate Carnival season. Another example of Catholic ties to Candomblé is in the early nineteenth century, pre-Lenten celebrations including formal dances for the rich and celebrations with dancing in the streets for the lower class occurred. These actions were prominent in the forming of Carnival as authorities eventually banned the separate types of celebrations having Carnival take its place where both sides of society participated in their own ways.

Axé was a fusion of African and Caribbean styles such as merengue, salsa and reggae, as well as being influenced by other Afro-Brazilian musical styles such as frevo and forró. Axé music was labeled in 1980s, but it was already noticeable in the 50s with the incorporation of the &quot;guitarra baiana&quot; (guitar from Bahia). This genre was purely instrumental, and remained so until the 1970s, when Moraes Moreira (of the band Novos Baianos) went solo. 
In 1974, carnival in Salvador, Bahia began taking shape. A group of Afro-Brazilians civil rights activists formed Ilê Aiyê, a music ensemble that derived their heavy rhythm from Candomblé&#x27;s religious ceremonies. Quickly, Ilê Aiyê gained a huge following, allowing them to influence other artists to incorporate the samba-reggae style and the heavy beats to their music. Groups such as Timbalada, Olodum and Filhos de Gandhi also shared the heavy beats and rhythms with Ilê Aiyê, as well as utilizing African symbols such as typical outfits and instruments that all these bands use to perform. Olodum&#x27;s rehearsals soon became a starting point for up and coming artists, composers, and music. In these rehearsals, artists presented and experimented with their music, in search for legitimacy from the population.

As axé has developed over time, all axé ensembles have had one thing in common: structure. Axé music ensembles usually consist of a lead singer, backup singers, an electric guitar, bass, drum set, keyboards, a percussion section, and sometimes even a horn section. As expressed in the earlier parts of this section, a driving beat, which carries out the dancing aspect of the music, also brings with it lyrics that invite those from mass who want to join these carnival parades. Used as a template of originality in the mid 1980s, axé didn&#x27;t completely come together until there was a mix of music genres developed by Bahian musicians. For example, samba-reggae, the local rhythm of Salvador&#x27;s blocos Afro was a prominent example of this combination. The blocos Afro group was formed to oppose prejudice that struck many poor dark-skinned people from several carnival clubs in Salvador in the 1970s. Opposing this prejudice, the signature music style of the blocos Afro gave a valuable meaning to axé and how it is shaped today.

Another example is in 1985, Luiz Caldas released his LP record called &quot;Magia&quot;, which included the track &quot;Fricote&quot;. Although the lyrics were not complex, the rhythm was perfect for the climate in Bahia. The song became the representation of the entertainment of Bahia&#x27;s musicality.

== Candomblé Beads ==
These Candomblé beads being made up of either plastic, glass, or clay, mimic emblems of status, protection, and affiliation with Candomblé in both secular and religious spaces. The beads acquire axé and form a materialistic representation of their God when they are made sacred by being bathed in sacred herbs and blood. Through these beads, they have a variety of functions in the life of persons who give them authority and regard them as essential to their spiritual well-being.

=== Status ===
When the Candomblé beads are used, in the sacred context, status is indicated by the type and color of the beads. For example, to employ items like dress, color, beads, and jewelry, you must be in a position of status. The beads will increase in size as the owner of the beads moves forward, carrying out their duties over many years, and they&#x27;ll add valuable items to them. Anyone who is aware of this demonstrates their standing within the Candomblé hierarchy.

=== Protection ===
When the Candomblé beads are used, they bring one into contact with the axé and enable the beads to withstand strong, possibly harmful forces. Empowerment gives beads the ability to guide and protect as well as harm their owners. For example, as they move through city streets, people frequently wear beads, which serve as representations for their orixá. They rely on these beads for protection in the most trying of circumstances.

=== Affiliation with Candomblé ===
When the Candomblé beads are used, in the public context, beads serve as a symbol of one&#x27;s pride in African Brazilian culture and religious affiliation. When Candomblé is viewed unfavorably, this awareness of identification can either be empowering and desirable or it can be potentially deadly.

=== Association with Orixás ===
When the Candomblé beads are used, in the sacred context, status is indicated by the type and color of the beads People may decorate themselves with bead strands during specific public festivities to express pride as well as express the affiliation with African Brazilian culture.

== Popularity ==
When Daniela Mercury released &quot;O Canto da Cidade&quot; in 1992, axé entered the mainstream pop music scene and became one of the most popular genres in Brazil. The song remained in the first position in the charts for months and ended up becoming an anthem for the people in Brazil. O Canto da Cidade opened doors for artists and bands such as Cheiro de Amor, Asa de Águia, Chiclete com Banana and Banda Eva, who launched Ivete Sangalo and led her to embark in her solo career. These bands are still relevant in Brazilian music scene, and still spreads the axé genre across the country and throughout the world.

Two years prior to Daniela Mercury&#x27;s success, the American and European released Margareth Menezes&#x27; &quot;Elegibô,&quot; which took the style to international audiences.

==Axé Today==
Currently, the biggest stars of axé music are Ivete Sangalo and Claudia Leitte. Claudia is known in Latin America for hits like &quot;Beijar na Boca&quot;, and was also extremely popular on the Spanish version, &quot;Beso en la Boca&quot;, as well as Baldin de Gelo, Carnaval ft. Pitbull and Corazon ft. Daddy Yankee.

==Axé International Exhibition==

Two great moments in the history of axé were the success of Ivete Sangalo and Claudia Leitte in the United States. Both singers sell out shows wherever they go, Ivete Sangalo sold out Madison Square Garden in 2010. In an interview before her show at MS, she stated: &quot;When I was recognized in Brazil, I was also known, and Brazil is a gigantic place with a lot of talent. I didn&#x27;t come here with the intention of being known, but what I came here to do, I came to do right&quot;. In that show, she managed to bring to the United States a &quot;mini-version of Carnival&quot;. Claudia Leitte, on the other hand, gained international prominence when she appeared on Billboard&#x27;s Social 50 for 8 weeks after collaborating on &quot;We Are One&quot;, the 2014 World Cup theme song. Pitbull, Daddy Yankee and Jennifer Lopez. Ivete Sangalo is the only artist to have participated in all editions of the Rock in Rio Lisboa show, in addition to having participated in Rock in Rio Brasil, Spain and the United States.

Another notable example for axé music was when Michael Jackson recorded his 1996 hit &quot;They Don&#x27;t Really Care About Us&quot; in Bahia. Spike Lee and directed the music video for this song, the music video was shot in the historic district of Pelourinho in Salvador and in a favela in Rio de Janeiro. Michael Jackson collaborated with Olodum in this video, which featured 200 members of the band playing their different types of drums to the sound of samba-reggae from Salvador. Due to this video, Olodum was exposed to 140 countries, increasing the reach of Afro-Brazilian samba-reggae.

<text>The Mausoleum of the Soviet Soldiers Cemetery () in Warsaw, Poland, is the burial place of over 21,000 Soviet soldiers who died fighting against Nazi Germany. It is the largest Soviet war cemetery in Poland and contains one of the first major monuments to be built in Warsaw to those who fought in the Second World War. It is an example of socialist realist architecture.

==Inception==

The cemetery was built in 1949–1950, located in Warsaw&#x27;s Mokotów district. It contains the ashes of 21,668 soldiers of the 1st Belarusian Front who died either in battle or as a result of injury and/or disease sustained during battles for Warsaw against armies of the Third Reich in 1944–1945. Their ashes were exhumed from local cemeteries and transferred to the mausoleum in 1949. The necropolis was designed by architects Bohdan Lachert (who planned the general layout) and Władysław Niemirski (who worked on the greenery), whereas its monumental sculptures were made by Jerzy Jarnuszkiewicz and Stanisław Lisowski.

The mausoleum was opened on the 5th Victory Day (9 May 1950), which since 2015 is celebrated in Poland on 8 May instead of the previously used date of 9 May. Troops from the following formations of the 1st Belarusian Front are buried here:
* 8th Guards Army
* 28th, 47th, 48th, 65th, 69th, 70th Armies
* 2nd Guards Tank Army
* 6th and 16th Air Army
* 46th Marksmen Corps
* 2nd and 7th Cavalry Corps
* 1st Guards Tank Army

==Architecture==
===Design===
The Soviet Military Cemetery was constructed in a socialist realist style, which was common in countries of the Warsaw Pact at the time. This can be seen in Jarnuszkiewicz and Lisowski&#x27;s sculptures of Red Army soldiers as well as reliefs showing workers with tools and other civilians greeting victorious soldiers near the main entrance to the complex. Ashes of the soldiers were buried in 834 graves, 294 of which are individual graves while the other 540 are mass graves. The central part of the cemetery is a wide avenue that leads through three terraces to a 35 metre tall granite obelisk. The obelisk inscription, changed in 2015 (see Further developments section), originally read:

:&quot;&quot;Ku wiecznej chwale bohaterskich żołnierzy niezwyciężonej Armii Radzieckiej, poległych w bojach z hitlerowskim najeźdźcą o wyzwolenie Polski i naszej stolicy Warszawy&quot;.&quot; (Polish)
:&quot;To the eternal glory of heroic soldiers of the invincible Soviet Army, fallen in battles with the Hitlerite invader for the liberation of Poland and our capital Warsaw.&quot;

The cemetery dedication on the right side lists (in Polish) the units to which the dead belonged. The same dedication appears on the left, in Russian, along with another relief. The cemetery is surrounded by artistically composed greenery, the work of Władysław Niemirski, as well as a park.

===Further developments===
In 2015, the obelisk inscription was changed to

:&quot;&quot;Pamięci żołnierzy Armii Radzieckiej poległych o wyzwolenie Polski spod okupacji niemieckiej w latach 1944–1945&quot;.&quot; (Polish)
:&quot;To the memory of Soviet Army soldiers fallen in liberating Poland from German occupation in the years 1944–1945.&quot;

In 2023, there were controversial plans to build tower blocks in the green area on the edge of the complex, plans that were being opposed by the &quot;Miasto Jest Nasze&quot; association. The greenery, which constitutes an important area in the natural system of Warsaw, was finally protected in September of the same year. This move effectively blocked the construction of the planned residential estate, thus preserving the gardens and natural environment around the mausoleum.

==Activism and vandalism in the 21st century==
===Remembrance and Reconciliation initiative===
In the aftermath of the Smolensk air disaster of 2010, as part of a Polish initiative called &quot;9 maja. Pamięć i Pojednanie&quot; (&quot;9th May. Remembrance and Reconciliation&quot;), personalities from the world of Polish culture, politics, science, and journalism appealed &quot;against the relativising of history&quot; and &quot;for reconciliation between Poland and Russia to be born in the name of the memory of all those who died tragically&quot;; signatories of the appeal included Agata Bielik-Robson, Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz, Rafał Dutkiewicz, Adam Michnik, Daniel Olbrychski, Wisława Szymborska, Józef Życiński, and many others. The initiative urged people to light grave candles on the graves of Red Army soldiers who had died while fighting against Nazi Germany in occupied Poland. The Varsovian mausoleum was one of the many cemeteries where this took place, with many Poles of various ages attending to pay their respects. Flowers were left and at least one candle was lit at every grave during this event, which was one of the largest visits to the mausoleum in years.

===Vandalism and protests===
Also in 2010, the cemetery was vandalised with graffiti sprayed on the base of some of the sculptures that in Polish said: &quot;Tusk we want the truth about Smolensk&quot;; the text addressed then Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk, referring to conspiracy theories surrounding the Smolensk air disaster that claimed the crash was an assassination of Polish government officials by the Russian authorities and that Tusk was apparently involved in covering it up. In the wake of Russian aggression against Ukraine that began with the War in Donbas, the mausoleum has been vandalised several times in the following years. However, official commemorations at the cemetery in 2014 proceeded without any disturbance.

In March 2017, the necropolis was vandalised again, this time by three unidentified people who left 15 instances of stencil graffiti around the complex; the graffiti showed a swastika on top of an Israeli flag with two red footprints on each side. The Russian Embassy as well as Poland&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Culture and National Heritage commented on the matter. Police began to guard the Soviet Military Cemetery as a result. In September of the same year, bases of the sculptures were yet again vandalised, this time sprayed with political slogans in Polish: &quot;Death to traitors of the nation&quot;, &quot;&quot;Paszoł won&quot; from our country&quot;, and &quot;Stalin&#x27;s flunkeys&quot;. Police stated that it was likely that the perpetrators committed the acts of vandalism on the 78th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland.

In 2022, leading up to that year&#x27;s Varsovian Victory Day celebrations, the mausoleum was vandalised with anti-Russian slogans (including the words &quot;Kill Putin&quot; sprayed in the colours of the Ukrainian flag). This was likely in connection with the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which had started less than three months prior, as the cemetery is attended annually by political representatives of the Russian Federation to commemorate the fallen Soviet soldiers. The graffiti was promptly removed by local authorities. 9th May celebrations at the cemetery were also disrupted by anti-war protests in 2023 and 2024.

<text>Tennis for Two (also known as Computer Tennis) is a sports video game that simulates a game of tennis, and was one of the first games developed in the early history of video games. American physicist William Higinbotham designed the game in 1958 for display at the Brookhaven National Laboratory&#x27;s annual public exhibition after learning that the government research institution&#x27;s Donner Model 30 analog computer could simulate trajectories with wind resistance. He designed the game within a few hours, after which he and technician Robert V. Dvorak built it over a period of three weeks. The game was displayed on an oscilloscope and played with two custom aluminum controllers. Its visuals show a representation of a tennis court viewed from the side, and players adjust the angle of their shots with a knob on their controller and try to hit the ball over the net by pressing a button.

The game was very popular during the three-day exhibition, with players lining up to see the game, especially high school students. It was shown again the following year with a larger oscilloscope screen and a more complicated design that could simulate different gravity levels. It was then dismantled and largely forgotten until the late 1970s when Higinbotham testified in court about the game during lawsuits between Magnavox and Ralph H. Baer over video game patents. Since then, it has been celebrated as one of the earliest video games, and Brookhaven has made recreations of the original device. Under some definitions &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; is considered the first video game, as while it did not include any technological innovations over prior games, it was the first computer game to be created purely as an entertainment product rather than for academic research or commercial technology promotion.

==Development==

In 1958, American physicist William Higinbotham worked in the Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, as the head of the instrumentation division. Higinbotham had a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics from Williams College, and had previously worked as a technician in the physics department at Cornell University while unsuccessfully pursuing a Ph.D. there. He served as the head of the electronics division of the Manhattan Project from 1943 to 1945, and began working at Brookhaven in 1947, which focused on researching peaceful uses of atomic power. Once a year, the government research facility held an exhibition for the public, with one day each for high school students, college students, and the general public. The exhibition largely consisted of tours and static displays, with some attempts at making displays with &quot;action&quot;, so for the 1958 exhibition Higinbotham decided to make an interactive display to entertain the visitors. While reading the instruction manual for one of Brookhaven&#x27;s computers, a Donner Model 30 analog computer, he learned that the computer could calculate ballistic missile trajectories or a bouncing ball with wind resistance, and he decided to use this ability to form the foundation of a game. He later recalled his intentions were that &quot;it might liven up the place to have a game that people could play, and which could convey the message that our scientific endeavors have relevance for society.&quot;
Higinbotham designed a game that used an oscilloscope to display the path of a simulated ball on a tennis court viewed from the side. The attached computer calculated the path of the ball and reversed its path when it hit the ground. The game also simulated the ball hitting the net if it did not achieve a high enough arc as well as changes in velocity due to drag from air resistance. Two aluminum controllers were attached to the computer, each consisting of a button and a knob. Pressing the button hit the ball, and turning a knob controlled the angle of the shot. Originally, Higinbotham considered having a second knob to control the velocity of the shot, but decided it would make the controller too complicated. The device was designed in a few hours and was assembled over three weeks with the help of technician Robert V. Dvorak. While most of the circuitry was based on vacuum tubes and relays, the circuits to display the graphics on the oscilloscope used transistors, then beginning to replace vacuum tubes in the electronics industry. Excluding the oscilloscope and controller, the game&#x27;s circuitry approximately took up the space of a microwave oven.
==Presentation==

&quot;Tennis for Two&quot; was first shown on October 18, 1958. The game environment was rendered as a horizontal line, representing the tennis court, and a short vertical line in the center, representing the tennis net as viewed edge-on. The first player would press the button on their controller to send the ball, a point of light, over the net, and it would either hit the net, reach the other side of the court, or fly out of bounds. The second player could then hit the ball back with their controller while it was on their side, either before or after it bounced on the ground. Hundreds of visitors lined up to play the new game during its debut. Higinbotham claimed later that &quot;the high schoolers liked it best, you couldn&#x27;t pull them away from it.&quot; Due to the game&#x27;s popularity, an upgraded version was shown the following year, with enhancements including a larger screen and different levels of simulated gravity. Players could set the game to simulate the gravity levels of the Moon or Jupiter. Higinbotham referred to the game as &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, though a placard attached to the 1959 version titled it &quot;Computer Tennis&quot;. After the 1959 exhibition, the game was dismantled so its components could be put to other uses.

==Legacy==
After being dismantled, &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; was largely forgotten. It remained virtually unknown until the late 1970s and early 1980s when Higinbotham was called on to testify in court cases for defendants sued by Magnavox over the video game patents of Ralph H. Baer. Having discovered the game, the lawyers for the defense unsuccessfully attempted to have the game declared prior art to invalidate Baer&#x27;s patents on television video games, resulting in attention being given to the nearly 20-year-old game as possibly the first video game. It received further attention as the subject of articles in &quot;Creative Computing&quot; and &quot;Video Replay&quot; in 1982 and 1983 highlighting its possible status as the first video game; the editor of &quot;Creative Computing&quot;, David H. Ahl, had played &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; at Brookhaven in 1958, and dubbed Higinbotham the &quot;Grandfather of Video Games&quot;. Higinbotham himself felt that the game was an obvious extension of the Donner Model 30&#x27;s bouncing ball program and therefore not worthy of patenting or a large part of his legacy; he preferred to be remembered for his post-World War II nuclear non-proliferation work.
In 1997, a team at Brookhaven recreated the game for Brookhaven&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The reconstruction took about three months, partially because the parts were not readily available. This recreation was also displayed at the 2008 celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the original game. The replica implemented an analog computer using solid-state operational amplifier devices instead of vacuum tubes as the original Donner Model 30 did. In 2010, it was replaced with a restored Donner Model 3400 analog computer. In 2011, Stony Brook University founded the William A. Higinbotham Game Studies Collection, dedicated to &quot;documenting the material culture of screen-based game media&quot;, and &quot;collecting and preserving the texts, ephemera, and artifacts that document the history and work of early game innovator and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientist William A. Higinbotham, who in 1958 invented the first interactive analog computer game, Tennis for Two.&quot;

&quot;Tennis for Two&quot; is considered under some definitions to be the first video game. Other candidates include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 &quot;Bertie the Brain&quot;, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and &quot;OXO&quot; and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest digital computer games to display visuals on an electronic screen. &quot;Tennis for Two&quot;, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, with the exception of the non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes &quot;Tennis for Two&quot; the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.

<text>Legitimation, legitimization (US), or legitimisation (UK) is the act of providing legitimacy. Legitimation in the social sciences refers to the process whereby an act, process, or ideology becomes legitimate by its attachment to norms and values within a given society. It is the process of making something acceptable and normative to a group or audience.

Legitimate power is the right to exercise control over others by virtue of the authority of one&#x27;s superior organization position or status.

==Power and influence==
For example, the legitimation of power can be understood using Max Weber&#x27;s traditional bases of power. In a bureaucracy, people gain legitimate use of power by their positions in which it is widely agreed that the specified person hold authority. There is no inherent right to wield power. For example, a president can exercise power and authority because the position is fully legitimated by society as a whole. 
In another example, if an individual attempts to convince others that something is &quot;right,&quot; they can invoke generally accepted arguments that support their agenda. Advocacy groups must legitimate their courses of action based on invoking specific social norms and values. Invoking these norms and values allows the group to proceed in a rational and coherent manner with the expectation that their subsequent behavior is legitimated by the norms and values which guide their organizations.

==Audience-based view==
Sociologists and organizational ecologists have shown that legitimation originates from consensus among certain agents (an audience) on which features and behaviors of an actor (a candidate) should be viewed as appropriate and desirable within a widespread system of social codes. An audience-based theory of legitimation posits that various social audiences develop expectations about what organizations can or should do and accordingly evaluate organizational action. Candidate organizations that pass the code test are legitimated in the social environment. One of the consequences is that they enjoy greater survival. Early elaborations of this idea include attempts to understand the variations of codes across different audiences; the impact of code violation on organizational performance; the role of the network connecting social actors and their audiences in shaping the formation and operation of social codes.

==Family law==

&quot;Legitimation&quot; can also be used as a legal term where a father of a child born out of wedlock becomes the child&#x27;s legal father. Prior to legitimation, the child is said to be illegitimate. Once a child has been legitimated, he or she is entitled to such benefits as ordained by law as he or she would if that man had been married to the child&#x27;s mother at the time of the child&#x27;s birth. (Some benefits are still withheld under various systems, such as the British peerage.) The father is responsible for providing support to the child and the child is entitled to inherit from the father.

While legitimation can be as simple as a statement by the father, in some jurisdictions the father must officially recognise the child. This option is typically also available to non-biological fathers (&quot;social fathers&quot;).

==Canon law==
Legitimation is a term in Roman Catholic canon law to remove the canonical irregularity of illegitimacy for candidates for the priesthood.

<text>is a Japanese professional long-distance runner who specialises in the marathon event. She is an Olympic champion over the distance.

Initially starting out as a track and cross country athlete, her first major success was becoming the Asian cross country champion at age 21. She soon switched to road running, however, focusing on the half marathon. She won the individual and team silver medals at the 1999 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, and won a second team silver with a fourth-place finish at the same competition in 2000.

A switch to the marathon event demonstrated her talents further: She won the Nagoya and Osaka Women&#x27;s Marathons, and took the silver medal in the marathon at the 2003 World Championships in Athletics. Her good form continued and she became the Olympic champion in the marathon at the 2004 Athens Olympics. She won the Berlin Marathon the following year, setting world records at 25 km and 30 km along the way, and finishing with a personal best of 2:19:12 – a course record in Berlin and a new Asian record for the distance. The 25K world record was beaten by Mary Keitany of Kenya in 2010, who ran the distance in 1:19:53 hours.

Before the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Noguchi had set the second fastest time in the world for the previous year. However, she was ruled out of all competitions after tests revealed that she had fatigue and a muscular back problem. She missed the Olympics and the entire 2009 and 2010 seasons as a result. She returned in November 2011 with a fifth-place finish at the Zevenheuvelenloop. She tried to gain a spot on the 2012 Olympic team, but her run of 2:25:33 hours left her in sixth at the Nagoya Women&#x27;s Marathon. A return to Nagoya in 2013 brought her third place with a run of 2:24:05 hours.

==Early career==

Noguchi was born in Kanagawa and grew up in Ise in Ise city in Mie. She started competing in track and field during her first year of middle school. While attending Ujiyamada Commercial High School, she entered the national high school track meet and competed in the 3000 m and the long-distance relay.

In 1997 she was hired by Wacoal, a maker of women&#x27;s clothing, as part of their &quot;Spark Angels&quot; program of sponsored women athletes. In October of the following year the director, Nobuyuki Fujita (藤田信之), left over differences with the company. He took with him a coach and a few athletes, including Noguchi. While she was receiving unemployment benefits for a short time, she remained active athletically. In February 1999, Fujita and all his followers were hired by Globaly, a commodity futures firm.

Noguchi began 1999 by winning individual and team gold at the Asian Cross Country Championships, but after winning the Inuyama half marathon, she was inspired to concentrate her efforts on that event. She was ranked second in the world that year, and in 2001 she won in the all-Japan corporate league. With a string of victories, she became known as &quot;Queen of the Half Marathon.&quot; Continuing through the Miyazaki Women&#x27;s Road Race competition in January 2004, she competed in 24 half marathons and won 14 of them. Only twice was she beaten by another Japanese athlete.

In March 2002 she entered her first full marathon, the Nagoya International Women&#x27;s Marathon, and won. In January 2003 she won the Osaka International Women&#x27;s Marathon with a time of 2 hours 21 minutes 18 seconds, the second-fastest on record for Japan. She also won a silver medal in the World Championships in Paris that year.

In 2005, as Globaly closed futures trade department and athletic team, Fujita and all his followers moved to Sysmex, a medical instruments manufacturer, in December.

== 2004 Olympic champion ==

On 22 August 2004 Noguchi won the marathon in the 2004 Athens Olympics, against a field which included world record holder Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain, and the 2003 world champion Catherine Ndereba of Kenya. The race over the Classic course began with temperatures exceeding 95 degrees (35 °C). A leading pack of 12 stayed together through halfway in 1 hour 14 minutes. Noguchi made her move on the tough uphill section between the and marks. When she reached the 30-kilometer sign, after running the previous 5 kilometers in just under 17 minutes, she had a 26-second lead on Elfenesh Alemu of Ethiopia and a 32-second lead on Radcliffe. Heading into the streets of downtown Athens, Noguchi held off Catherine Ndereba, who closed the gap over the final 5 kilometers but could not make up the difference. Noguchi won in 2 hours 26 minutes 20 seconds. Ndereba finished 12 seconds behind Noguchi. Deena Kastor of the United States took the bronze at 2:27:20.

== Records at Berlin ==
On September 25, 2005 Noguchi won the Berlin Marathon, which was her first big competition since winning the gold medal in Athens more than a year earlier. Four years earlier, the Berlin Marathon was won by Naoko Takahashi, the Japanese runner who took the Olympic gold medal in Sydney in 2000. Takahashi&#x27;s remarkable win in 2001 in Berlin marked the first time in history that a woman ran sub-2:20, clocking in at 2 hours, 19 minutes and 46 seconds. Noguchi improved on Takahashi&#x27;s time by more than half a minute, winning the 2005 Marathon in 2:19:12. Noguchi&#x27;s time set three new records: the Berlin Marathon course record, the Japanese record, and the Asian record.

After the victory, she declared:

<text>Legnano (; or &quot;Lignàn&quot;) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the province of Milan, about from central Milan. With 60,259, it is the thirteenth-most populous township in Lombardy. Legnano is located in the Alto Milanese and is crossed by the Olona River.

The history of Legnano and its municipal area has been traced back to the 1st millennium BC via archaeological evidence. Already in remote times, in fact, the hills that line the Olona had proved to be habitable places. The town was established in 1261.

Because of the historic victory of the Lombard League over Frederick Barbarossa at Legnano, it is the only town other than Rome named in the Italian national anthem (&quot;[...] &quot;Dall&#x27;Alpi a Sicilia dovunque è Legnano&quot; [...]&quot;, en. &quot;From the Alps to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere&quot;). Every year the people of Legnano commemorate the battle with Palio di Legnano. In the institutional sphere, on 29 May, the date of the battle of Legnano, it was chosen as the regional holiday of Lombardy.

== Geography ==
=== Territory ===
Located in the south of the Varese Prealps along the , the &quot;comune&quot; of Legnano has an area of , has an elevation of above sea level, and is in Zone 4 (Irrelevant seismology).

The valley soil is mainly composed of sand, gravel, and clay. A thin layer of humus also used to coat the valley, rendering it a moorland useless to agriculture.

=== Hydrography ===
Legnano is crossed by the Olona River, which cuts Legnano into two nearly equally sized portions. The Olona has a number of deviations both natural, such as the , located near Visconti Castle, and artificial. The latter of these are the diversionary channels and levees that encase much of the river as it flows through Legnano, especially around the former and cotton mills.

These were built because the Olona was prone to damaging floods, but consequently made the Olona one of the most polluted rivers in Italy. The pollution of the river is gradually lessening, however, while the last damaging flood occurred on 13 September 1995, and the last in chronological order occurred in July 2014.

For the vast majority of the city&#x27;s stretch, the waterway is pernilted into levee or stone embankments, which were built to minimize flooding. The Olona, before the construction of embankments and drainage channels, was in fact a river that scourged with frequent floods the areas it crosses.

In the past there were deviations of the course of the river: natural, such as the Olonella, and artificial, such as the canals and the disclaimed by the peasants. The latter were necessary to reach, for irrigation purposes, the land farthest from the Olona. The extraction of water from the river, and more generally the activities related to the exploitation of the Olona, were regulated, over the centuries, by contracts and regulations.

=== Urban planning ===
The urban fabric of Legnano has developed around the old town; its growth was influenced by three barriers: the Olona River, the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot; and the Domodossola–Milan railway.

The city was the protagonist of a progressive urbanization that led to a considerable expansion of the population center. At the origin of this phenomenon was the birth of many industries that attracted workers from different parts of Italy. As can be seen from the demographic evolution, between 1871 and 1921 the population of Legnano quadrupled. Due to the need for water, the mussel industries born in the 19th century sprung up along the shores of the Olona. As a result, the new residential districts have occupied the free areas beyond the river valley.

As a result of the growth of Legnano, the companies have built their locations more and more on the outskirts. Then, the various economic crises that followed in the decades of the 20th century led to the birth of many brownfield sites that are recovering. The most important urban intervention, which was carried out at the beginning of the 21st century, was the recovery from the former Cotonificio Cantoni, an area of 110,000 square meters that was destined to residential and commercial area.

=== Historical subdivisions ===
In Legnano there is a historical subdivision into neighborhoods. The historic neighborhoods of Legnano are &quot;Mazzafame&quot;, &quot;Ponzella&quot;, &quot;Frati&quot;, &quot;Olmina&quot;, &quot;Canazza&quot;, &quot;Gabinella&quot;, &quot;Legnanello&quot;, &quot;Colli di Sant&#x27;Erasmo&quot; and &quot;Costa San Giorgio&quot;. The part of the town to the west of the railway is called &quot;oltrestazione&quot;, while the part to the east of the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot; is called &quot;oltresempione&quot;. The eight historical &quot;contrade&quot; competing at the Palio di Legnano are &quot;San Bernardino&quot;, &quot;La Flora&quot;, &quot;Legnarello&quot;, &quot;San Domenico&quot;, &quot;San Magno&quot;, &quot;San Martino&quot;, &quot;Sant&#x27;Ambrogio&quot; and &quot;Sant&#x27;Erasmo&quot;.

== Climate ==
According to , Legnano is in Zone E with a rating of 2451 GR/G. Due to its location in the upper Po Valley, Legnano has a Continental climate with cold winters characterized by many days of snowfall and fog. Summers are hot humid, and moderately wet; temperatures can exceed and humidity 80%. That humidity persists for the entire year because of precipitation brought on by cyclones originating in the Mediterranean or in the Russian north. That precipitation itself remains in the Po Valley because of its poor ventilation.

Data from the indicates that, based on the more than thirty years (1961–1990) of reference accumulated by the World Meteorological Organization, that the average temperature of the Milan area the coldest month, January, is and that of the hottest month, July, is . Rainfall averages at and has peaks in spring and autumn, countered by a relative drop during the winter.

The basic climatic data of Legnano are:

== Toponymy ==
The toponymy of the name &quot;Legnano&quot; is uncertain, as the early settlement was known by several names, but it is obvious that Legnano&#x27;s name is older than that of the surrounding municipalities. &quot;Legnano&quot; could have originated as a predial adjective, formed from the name of the most prominent landowner in the area. In Legnano&#x27;s case, this landowner&#x27;s name could have been &quot;Lemennius&quot; or &quot;Limenius&quot;, to which was adjoined the suffix -&quot;anum&quot;. This land ownership was more extensive than the modern &quot;comune&quot; of Legnano having a surface corresponding to his modern urban area, the &quot;Legnanese&quot;.

This would confirm the complete Latinization of the Legnano area around 1st century AD; in other places where Celtic influence was still substantial, the suffix &quot;-acum&quot; would have been used. Thus, the ancient name of Legnano became &quot;Lemoniano&quot;, &quot;Leminiano&quot; or &quot;Lemegniano&quot;, later &quot;Limnianum&quot; and finally &quot;Legnanum&quot;.

Another theory advances that one of the names that Legnano was known by in the Middle Ages, &quot;Ledegnanum&quot;, derives from the name for the region, &quot;Latinanium&quot;. Therefore, any suppositions linking the name of the city to the Celtic toponym &quot;Lemonianum&quot; (&quot;place of the sacred grove&quot;) or the predial adjective &quot;Laenianum&quot;, referring to a potential landowner named &quot;Laenius&quot; are false.

The period of foundation Legnano is unknown: the name would have at least medieval origins. According to the most important hypotheses, the genesis of ancient Legnano, whose most likely name is &quot;Latinanium&quot;, dates back to before the birth of Christ, in Roman times.

== Coat of arms ==
The origin of this coat of arms can be clearly traced back to a coat of arms reproduced on page 193 of the Stemmario Trivulziano. In this ancient volume it can be read that the coat of arms of Legnano is very similar to that of Stemmario Cremosano.

The subject and the colors in the coat of arms of the municipality of Legnano are linked to a legend. In an unspecified historical period, in today&#x27;s &quot;Piazza San Magno&quot;, a large Turkey oak. On the day of the patron saint san Magno, 5 November, a farmer began to contemplate the tree admiring its ability to withstand frost and snow. The farmer thus expressed a desire to be able to withstand the difficulties of life in the same way. At that moment, san Magno appeared, offering to satisfy man&#x27;s desire by giving him the vigour, recklessness, and power of a lion.

The saint ordered the farmer to kill a rabbit and advance on the snow-soaked ground, where the animal&#x27;s blood had been shed. The farmer followed orders and then san Magno fulfilled his dream by turning him into a lion. After the prodigy, the saint suddenly disappeared without appeasing the farmer who asked to return man, thus chastising his pride. The tree and the lion, along with the white of the snow and the red blood of the rabbit, became the symbols of Legnano, and were included in the coat of arms and in the municipal skirt.

On 15 August 1924, the municipality of Legnano was granted the title of city.

== History ==
=== Prehistory and Roman times ===
The most ancient evidence of settlement in Legnano dates to the Remedello culture (21st–19th centuries BC). Later it was a Celtic center, conquered by the Romans in the 1st century BC.

Since ancient times the inhabitants of Legnano lived on the edge of the river Olona Valley. These land, higher than the river, were not flooded by the regular floods of the waterway. As a result, the most important archaeological finds, from prehistory to Roman rule, were discovered along the edges of the Olona valley; these finds mainly refer to inhumations.

The oldest furnishings found in Legnano are fragments of a vase that can be traced back to Remedello&#x27;s culture. They were born between 1926 and 1928 near the border between Castellanza and Legnano, dating from between 34th century BC and 22nd century BC. Bronzes dating back to the 4th century BC and 1st century BC (linked to La Tène culture) have been found from an archaeological site near the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot;.

The ancient &quot;vicus&quot; of &quot;Legnanum&quot;, which belonged to the &quot;regio XI Transpadana&quot;, one of Italy&#x27;s Augustean regions, was connected to the surrounding areas through important communication routes, the most important of which was a Roman road built in the 1st century AD, the &quot;Via Severiana Augusta&quot;, which skirted the Olona River at the modern &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot;, which connected ancient &quot;Mediolanum&quot; (the modern Milano) to Lake Maggiore.

The most important Roman-era finds were discovered in 1925 in a necropolis in the east of the city. The necropolis contained coins, plates, cups, glasses, balsamari, mirrors, and iron utensils. Other tombs dating back to the same period were found in 1985 near the old town, while other archaeological excavations revealed late Roman objects. This kit consisted of pebbles, knives, razors and buckles. All these objects are on display in the Museo civico Guido Sutermeister.

=== Middle Ages ===
The first document received on the history of Legnano concerns the quartier of &quot;Legnanello&quot;. This act, which refers to a trade in land located in the small neighbour, is dated 23 October 789. Within this written testimony can be read:


This written testimony in English means &quot;[...] with our properties in &quot;Legnanello&quot; [...]&quot;. It seems that &quot;Legnanello&quot; existed as early as 687, when the religious celebration of the Candlemas (the &quot;Candelora&quot;) began, introduced by Pope Sergius I, who officiated every 2 February.

The first mention of the main settlement of Legnano is related to the capture of Arialdo, head of the pataria, which took place inside the castle of the Cotta in Legnano, that was built in 10th century and demolished in 13th/14th century (this fortification was one of military outpost of Lombard League during the Battle of Legnano, fought on 29 May 1176). 
On the &quot;Historia Mediolanensis&quot; written by Landulf Junior in the 11th century which deals with the history of Milan in the Middle Ages, it can in fact be read that Arialdo was captured:

This testimony in English means &quot;[...] near &quot;Legnano&quot; [...]&quot;. Leone da Perego, Bishop of Milan from 1241 to 1257, also stayed in Legnano. He lived in the palace of the same name, Palazzo Leone da Perego, where he died on 14 October 1257. At first he was buried in the Church of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, but then the body disappeared. In 1258, the community of Legnano approved its first statutes, a deliberation that formally gave birth to the municipality of modern Legnano.
In April 1273, the Visconti Castle of Legnano hosted the royals Edward I of England and Eleanor of Castile on their way back from their trip to the Middle East. Bonvesin da la Riva, the greatest poet and writer of Lombardy in the 13th century and one of the exponent more prominent of the didactic poetic movement of northern Italy, lived in the city until 1288. The literary man described Legnano with these verses:

In the Middle Ages, the city was the location of the Battle of Legnano in which Emperor Frederick I was defeated by the Lombard League (1176). Because of the historic victory of the Lombard League over Frederick Barbarossa, it is the only town other than Rome named in the Italian national anthem (&quot;[...] &quot;Dall&#x27;Alpi a Sicilia dovunque è Legnano&quot; [...]&quot;, en. &quot;From the Alps to Sicily, Legnano is everywhere&quot;). Every year the people of Legnano commemorate the battle with Palio di Legnano. In the institutional sphere, on 29 May, the date of the battle of Legnano, it was chosen as the regional holiday of Lombardy.

Although the presence of the enemy in the surroundings was already known to both sides, they met suddenly without having time to plan any strategy. The Battle of Legnano was crucial in the long war waged by the Holy Roman German Empire to try to assert its power over the municipalities of northern Italy, who decided to put aside each other&#x27;s rivalries by allied themselves in a military-led union symbolically by Pope Alexander III, the Lombard League, whose symbol was the Carroccio.

The battle ended the fifth and final descent into Italy of Emperor Federico Barbarossa, who after the defeat tried to resolve the Italian question by attempting the diplomatic approach. This resulted a few years later in the peace of Constance (25 June 1183), with which the Emperor recognized the Lombard League by granting administrative, political and judicial concessions to the municipalities and officially ending his attempt to hegemonize Northern Italy.

=== From 13th century to 15th century ===
Already in the Middle Ages Legnano was not considered a village, but a &quot;borgo&quot;, a denomination reserved in Italy for &quot;comuni&quot; with a market and a fortification. These infrastructures generally stood in the most populous centers and also served the neighboring centers.

During the Renaissance, Legnano was dominated by several noble families. The main ones were the Lampugnani, Vismara, Visconti, Crivelli, Maino and Caimi. During the 15th century Legnano was enriched with many noble dwellings, which built to the Visconti Castle of Legnano, that replaced in the role of fortification of the &quot;borgo&quot; the already mentioned castle of the Cotta, and the Palazzo Leone da Perego, that was built by the eponymous archbishop.

The only civil built in the 15th century that has not been demolished is &quot;Torre Colombera&quot;, which is now located between &quot;corso Garibaldi&quot; and &quot;via Del Gigante&quot;, near the Church of San Domenico, embedded in a building over the street.

In 1549 the population, decimated by the plague epidemics of 1529 and of 1540, was 576 inhabitants, spread to 184 families. Already in these centuries the agriculture was very diverse. The main crops were cereals (millet and wheat), grapevine and mulberry, which is the basis of the breeding of silkworms. In addition to cereal farming, the wood economy was also based on livestock farming and crafts.

The construction of the convents and most of the churches of Legnano, on the other hand, dates back to the Counter-Reformation: the noble families of the time competed to win the favor of the Milanese archbishops by tying their name to works of charity or to works for the benefit of the community.

=== From 16th century to 19th century ===
The hallmark of the 18th and 19th centuries was the construction of many watermills along the Olona. In the period of maximum expansion of the activity of watermills, in Legnano, seventeen mills could be counted, exploiting the driving force of the Olona river. The last seven in Legnano were demolished between the 19th and 20th centuries to be replaced by more modern plants, which exploited the driving force of the Olona river more efficiently.

The low incomes that were provided by the agricultural and livestock economy of these centuries stimulated the peasants to integrate the use in the fields with other jobs, in which women also participated during the day. In the evening, the farmers became spinners and weavers of silk, wool and cotton, as well as dyers.

During the Napoleonic era, a work was enhanced that would be decisive, together with the artisanal activities above, for the birth of industries. The government improved the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot; road that connected Milan with Paris on the Rho – Legnano – Gallarate – Arona – Domodossola – Brig crossing the Alps. Nowadays in Legnano the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot; still exists. This important communication route also greatly contributed to the strategic importance of Legnano, the second mail station from Milan.

In the 19th century the municipal administration of Legnano was governed by large landowners and members of the wealthiest bourgeoisie. She was often forced to intervene to dictate rules on agriculture, grazing and land protection, and to resolve heated disputes between farmers and millers, especially during lean Olona river periods.

On 16 June 1862, from a balcony of a building no longer existing (there was later built the headquarters of the Banca di Legnano), Giuseppe Garibaldi urged the &quot;legnanesi&quot; to build a monument in memory of the famous battle of 29 May 1176. The municipality of Legnano, stimulated by the speech of Garibaldi, erected a statue in honor of the battle, initially created by the sculptor Egidio Pozzi and then replaced in 1900 by the nowadays Monument to the Warrior of Legnano, which is the work of Enrico Butti and that it is often mistakenly associated with the legendary Lombard League leader Alberto da Giussano.

In 1882 the city was invaded by a disastrous flood of the Olona: for the courageous and philanthropic actions of its inhabitants, as can be read in the motivation of the honor, Legnano was awarded the Gold Medal of Civil Valor.

* Gold Medal for Civil Valor.

=== Industrialisation ===
The first documented manufacturing activities date back to the 12th century and are linked to the processing of wool in convents, while the first proto-industrial activities, in the modern sense of the term, arose around 1830, with the opening of the nucleus of Cotonificio Cantoni. The process of industrialization in Legnano lasted from 1820 to 1880. The secular traditions of craftsmanship and home crafting, practiced to integrate work in the fields, played a decisive role in the birth of the industry in Legnano.

The spinning soured in the first decades of the 19th century then turned into real industries. Some of them grew steadily to become among the main cotton mills in Lombardy. Legnano was ideal for opening up textile industries thanks to the presence of important communication routes and that of the Olona River, which provided the energy necessary to move the hydraulic wheels before the installation of steam engines. By the second half of the 19th century, the timber companies achieved a wider production, thanks in part to the technological improvement that led some industries to have an importance that transcended national borders.

Among the Legnano&#x27;s industries, the main, for organization and technology, was the Cotonificio Cantoni, according to an 1876 document kept in the archive of the municipality of Legnano. Among the largest companies operating in Legnano between the 19th and 20th centuries were, in addition to those already mentioned, the Cotonificio Bernocchi, Cotonificio Dell&#x27;Acqua, De Angeli-Frua, the Manifattura di Legnano, the mechanical companies Franco Tosi Meccanica, the Mario Pensotti and Andrea Pensotti, the FIAL, who mainly produced cars, and the cycling company Legnano. Some of these industrialists also made contributions to the construction of the hospital and high schools. 
Between 1885 and 1915, the original agricultural economy of Legnano finally became an industrial system. However, industrial development led to an agricultural crisis in the area, as many farmers abandoned their activities in the fields to work in the factories of Legnano. At the turn of the two centuries there was therefore a strong industrial and commercial development. For this expansion, the infrastructure for the transport of people and goods was very important. Next to the &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot; was built the railway station of Legnano along the Domodossola–Milan railway line and, along the latter, the Milan-Gallarate tramway, which connected Legnano to Milan. The Milan-Gallarate tramway was later abolished in the second half of the 20th century.

During the industrialisation of Legnano there was a large use of child labor. In the early 1980s, the first strikes were organized in the industry, while the first working-class societies were born.

=== 20th century ===

==== World War I ====
In 1915, when Italy entered into World War I, Legnano had a population of 28,757. Between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, there was a strong population increase due to immigration, driven by the development of industry, which constituted a lure of workers and service workers. During the war, the industries of Legnano also converted their plants for the production of war supplies.

Franco Tosi Meccanica, in particular, helped equip the Royal Italian Army&#x27;s artillery units. Two natural disasters, in 1917, worsened the situation caused by the war: the epidemic of Spanish flu, which mowed down the population, and a devastating flood of the Olona River, which broke the embankments and invaded the town.

==== Between the two world wars ====
At the end of the World War I, in 1918, Legnano was also embroiled in deep social tensions that led, at the national level, into the &quot;Biennio Rosso&quot; period first and then fascism. The first groups inspired by the political movement founded by Benito Mussolini were formed in 1920.

In the early post-war years, the timber industry resumed its strong growth which had characterized it until before the outbreak of the conflict; this development took place despite the transformation of the Italian economy from liberal to corporate. In addition to the growth of the textile and mechanical industries, in 1927 the company Emilio Bozzi took over the bicycle construction business from Franco Tosi Meccanica, relaunching the brand Legnano.

The sanatorio Regina Elena is linked to two visits by members of the royal family: on 19 June 1924 by Margherita of Savoy on the occasion of the inauguration of the structure and on 27 April 1925 by King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy, who visited the complex.

According to a 1927 census, the population of Legnano was about 30,000, with 677 industrial and artisanal establishments. The workforce consisted of 9,926 textile plant employees, 4,056 mechanical factory workers, 1,762 employees in commerce, credit, insurance and other services, and 287 workers in transportation and communications.

The constant economic growth and strong population growth (Legnano passed, from 1881 to 1924, from 8,098 to 29,117 inhabitants) led to the elevation of the municipality to the city, which was conferred by royal decree on 15 August 1924 by king Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy.

* &quot;Titolo di Città&quot; (en. &quot;title of city&quot;).

During fascism, many public works were conceived, designed and performed. The most important one that touched Legnano was the first section of the Autostrada dei Laghi, connecting to the time Milan with Gallarate. It was inaugurated on 20 September 1923 in the presence of king Victor Emmanuel III.

It was the first motorway built in the world, and was designed by the engineer Piero Puricelli. In May 1935, the first edition of the Palio di Legnano was organized to commemorate the victory of the municipalities of the Lombard League against Frederick Barbarossa in the Battle of Legnano of 29 May 1176.

==== World War II ====
In 1940 Italy entered the World War II alongside Nazi Germany, and the events of the war were also reflected in Legnano. Many soldiers died on the battlefield, and the effects of deprivation became more acute as the months and years passed. The industries of Legnano were converted for military orders. On the night of 13–14 August 1943, planes dropped bombs on the town, resulting in a dozen deaths.

The decisive turning point of the war was the armistice of 8 September 1943 between Italy and the Allies. The next day, German armoured cars began menacing lytry through the streets of Legnano. The industry of Legnano, now controlled by the Nazis, began supplying the Third Reich with the artifacts needed to continue the war.

In October 1943, the first armed teams made up of workers, students and soldiers were formed in Legnano, and in neighbouring countries after 8 September. The partisan brigades &quot;Carroccio&quot; were formed, Catholic-inspired, &quot;Garibaldi&quot;, of socialist-communist extraction, and some autonomous compatriots, among them the &quot;Sicilia&quot;. The &quot;Carroccio&quot; and &quot;Garibaldi&quot; operated together with the partisan compatriots of Northern Italy under the provisions of the National Liberation Committee.

Legnano is one of the cities decorated after the war, having been awarded the Bronze Medal of Military Valor for the sacrifices of its people and for its activity in the partisan struggle during World War II.

* Bronze Medal for War Valor.

==== From the end of World War II to 21st century====
After the war Legnano was hit, like the rest of Italy, by the severe economic recession following the conflict. Basic food was insufficient, public transport was limited and roads were rough. On 2 May 1945, for the first time since the fascist dictatorship, the municipal council met. The time for a return to democracy and reconstruction, after the destruction of the war, was long and tiring.

After regularized national political life, Legnano&#x27;s economy returned to growth, resuming the strength of the period before the World War II. During Italy&#x27;s strong economic growth during the economic boom, Legnano achieved, between 1951 and 1961, the Italian record of the highest employment index in industry compared to the total population (65.2%), second after Sesto San Giovanni.

The golden age of the Legnano industry began at the beginning of the 20th century and ended in the 1960s. The crisis progressively worsened, damaging the economy, employment and the industrial fabric. Many companies closed, especially in textiles, clothing and footwear, and many others were involved in a downsizing process, such as Franco Tosi Meccanica. The latter is the only major timber industry still active having closed its doors, in 2014, Giovanni Crespi.

Attempts were made to target the tertiary sector. In 1977 in Legnano was founded Antenna 3 Lombardia that was, that time, the most important private TV station in Italy.These alternative fields did not, however, lead to a sufficient rate of development to make up for the closure of large industrial activities. An exception to this dynamic was the foundation in Legnano, in 1985, of the fashion company Dolce &amp; Gabbana. A phase began with the birth of small businesses. These processes continue to this day, making Legnanese a highly developed and industrialised area.

== Main sights ==
=== Religious architecture ===





* Basilica of San Magno. It is dedicated to the Saint Magnus, who was Archbishop of Milan from 518 to 530. The church was built from 1504 to 1513 in the Renaissance-style and likely design by Donato Bramante. The bell tower was added between the years 1752 and 1791. On 18 March 1950, Pope Pious XII named the Basilica of San Magno a minor basilica. The interior of the basilica church is adorned with numerous first-class examples of Lombard Renaissance artwork. Examples are Gian Giacomo Lampugnani&#x27;s frescoes of the main vault, the remains of 16th century paintings by Evangelista Luini, the frescoes of the main chapel by Bernardino Lanini, and the altarpiece by Giampietrino. The item of greatest significance, however, is a polyptych by Bernardino Luini that is widely considered by art historians to be his masterpiece.
* Church of Sant&#x27;Ambrogio. It is the oldest church in the city. The chapel on which the church was built was dedicated to Saint Nazaro. It was later dedicated to Saint Ambrose, Archbishop of Milan between 374 and 397. The first quotation of a church dedicated to Saint Ambrose in Legnano is contained in a document of 1389 written by Geoffrey da Bussero.

* Church of Sant&#x27;Erasmo. The history of the church of Sant&#x27;Erasmo is linked to the hospice probably founded by Bonvesin da la Riva, a 13th-century Lombard poet and writer. It was consecrated to Erasmus of Formia and opened to worship in 1490.
* Church of San Bernardino. It is dedicated to Bernardino of Siena. Consecrated in the 17th century, it was built on the ruins of an ancient oratory on the proposal of Carlo Borromeo. The first traces of documents date back to 1650.
* Church of Santa Rita. The first documented reports of the church of Santa Rita (or of the Purificazione, en. &quot;of the Purification&quot;) date back to 1584, when cardinal Carlo Borromeo elevated it to a religious building of reference for the quartier of Legnanello. On 13 August 1898 cardinal Andrea Carlo Ferrari erected it as a parish priest, a function he had until 1902, when the new church of Santissimo Redentore was inaugurated. It is dedicated to Rita of Cascia
* Church of San Martino. Today&#x27;s church of San Martino is from the 15th century, but a building with this name and dedicated to Martin of Tours was on the list left by the historian Geoffrey da Bussero, dated 1389. The church is therefore a refurbishment building of another much older one.
* Church of Madonnina dei Ronchi. It was built in 1641 after a descendant of Oldrado II Lampugnani gave permission to turn the family chapel into a church. It is located along &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot;. It is dedicated to Mary, mother of Jesus.

It is dedicated to Teresa of Ávila.
* Church of Santissimo Redentore. It was inaugurated in 1902 in the quartier of Legnanello. Prior to this church, the ward religious community referred from 1603 to the small church of Santa Rita or of the Purificazione. It is dedicated to Christ the Redeemer.
* Church of San Domenico. The original idea had been to build a tannery on the area where the church is located. A priest opposed the plan and began work of church construction in April 1900. It was later dedicated to saint Dominic.
* Church of Santi Martiri. Completed in 1910 it became a parish church in 1912 and is dedicated to saints Sisinnius, Martyrius and Alexander, whose relics were kept in the basilica of San Simpliciano in Milan. For this reason is linked to Battle of Legnano (29 May 1176).

The monumental cemetery was expanded in 1907 to an area of 50,000 square meters. 
: Legnano is also equipped with a cemetery park, which is more recent construction and is located on the outskirts of the city in the modern quartier of San Paolo.

Built by Enrico Butti, it was inaugurated on 29 June 1900. It is often mistakenly attributed to Alberto da Giussano.
* Palazzo Leone da Perego. It is a historic building in Legnano. It was rebuilt in 1898 with some decorations from the former medieval building of the same name. Located a short walk from basilica of San Magno, it has two entrances, one in &quot;corso Magenta&quot; and the other in &quot;via Girardelli&quot;. It is named after Leone da Perego, archbishop of Milan who died in Legnano in 1257.

* Casa del Balilla. It was originally intended for Casa del Balilla, the home of Legnano of the Opera Nazionale Balilla, from which the name is derived. Originally named after Arnaldo Mussolini, duce&#x27;s younger brother, it was inaugurated in December 1933 by the then President of the National Opera Balilla Renato Ricci.
* Colonia elioterapica. Designed by architecture firm BBPR and built in a few months between 1937 and 1938, it is one of the most important examples of Italian rationalism.

The two most important facades architecturally (actually the only ones not yet demolished), those of the velvet department of the 1931 overlooking &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot;, have been preserved and are an integral part of the new commercial buildings. The rest of the complex, including other architecturally interesting buildings, was demolished.
* Galleria di Legnano. It is a covered passageway inserted into a building, connecting &quot;piazza San Magno&quot; with &quot;via XXV Aprile&quot;. It is located in the city center.

In Galleria di Legnano is located the Gallery Theatre. 
* La Colombera. It is the only building of Legnano that has come to us from 15th century. It is incorporated in a Lombard court that stands between &quot;corso Garibaldi&quot; and &quot;via Del Gigante&quot;, near the church of San Domenico. Also known as &quot;La Colombera&quot;, it owes its name to one of the uses that in the past were often carried out in similar structures, namely the breeding of pigeons (in Italian, &quot;colombi&quot;). 
* Museo civico Guido Sutermeister. It is an archaeological museum named after the archaeologist Guido Sutermeister, who wanted to be founded. It was staged in 1929 thanks to the will of Guido Sutermeister, who did a major archaeological research on the territory between 1925 and 1964. The collections were then enriched with material that came to the museum from excavations of the Archaeological Superintendent of Lombardy and donations from private individuals.
* Ospedale civile di Legnano. The first pavilion of the hospital in Legnano was built in 1903 in &quot;via Candiani&quot; thanks to the contribution of the citizens of Legnano, with the local industrialists who played a leading role.

It is located in the central &quot;piazza San Magno&quot; next to the basilica of the same name and was inaugurated on 28 November 1909 during the period of the city&#x27;s greatest – industrial and demographic – growth. It has a medieval style with exposed brick and &quot;bifore&quot; to which are added parts that recall other architectural styles such as Liberty and the neo-Renaissance. The upper cornice is decorated with the coats of arms of the municipalities that were part of the Lombard League and with those of the Italian provincial capitals, including the coats of arms of Pula, Rijeka and Zadar, which belonged to Italy between the two world wars.
* Sanatorio regina Elena. It is a former sanatorium located in Legnano, which finished its original function of tuberculosis treatment in 1970. Later part of the building became a socio-educational centre for the physically and mentally disabled and home to some voluntary associations, as well as the headquarters of part of the offices of the local &quot;Azienda sanitaria locale&quot;.

Located on the edge of the city, it borders the municipalities of Canegrate and San Vittore Olona and extends around the Visconti Castle of Legnano. Established in 1976 as a local park of super-communal interest, since 2008 it is part of the Park of the Mills, a park of super-communal interest that extends for about 500 hectares.
* Parco Bosco dei Ronchi e Parco ex-ILA. The two parks are not adjacent but are located a short distance away. The Parco ex-ILA and the Parco Bosco dei Ronchi are part of a single urban protected area established by the decision of City Council in 1992. The Parco Bosco dei Ronchi extends entirely within the city limits and is not enclosed by any fence. This allows free access by citizens.

# Bangladesh, 266
# Senegal, 247

=== Religion ===
The patron saint of Legnano is Saint Magno, archbishop of Milan from 518 to 530, whose anniversary is celebrated on 5 November. The majority of the population is Catholic Church. The immigration of EU and non-EU citizens has led to the establishment of large Orthodox, Muslims and Christian minorities. There is also a small Presbyterian community in the city.

There are nine Catholic parishes in the municipality that belong to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milan. The oldest parish churches are San Magno and Sant&#x27;Ambrogio. The church of Madonnina dei Ronchi is one of the few churches of the archdiocese of Milan where masses are celebrated in the ancient Ambrosian Rite, that is officiated in the Latin language.

== Transportation ==
The town is served by Legnano railway station. Located on the common section of the lines Domodossola–Milan, Luino–Milan and Porto Ceresio–Milan, it serves the city of Legnano. Legnano is served by the line S5 of the Milan suburban railway network and by the regional line Milan–Varese. Between 1880 and 1966 the city was also served by the Milan-Gallarate tramway, an infrastructure managed by &quot;STIE&quot;.

Legnano has an exit along the Highway of the Lakes, is crossed by two state roads (&quot;strada statale 33 del Sempione&quot; and &quot;strada statale 527 Bustese&quot;) and is crossed by the provincial road SP12 Legnano-Inveruno. Legnano is connected with Milan and the neighboring municipalities by several long-distance bus routes operated by the companies &quot;MOVIBUS&quot; and &quot;FNM Autoservices&quot;.

== Economy ==
Agriculture of Legnano has been the basis of the economic development of the territory. First, it was affected by the process of mechanization and restructuring. Mechanization, thanks to the use of increasingly complex machinery, has led to an increase in agricultural production. In the 21st century it is no longer an important activity for the timber economy. The few areas free of construction and infrastructure are grown from cereals, mainly wheat and maize.

The golden age of Legnano&#x27;s industry began at the beginning of the 20th century and ended in the 1960s. The crisis progressively worsened, damaging the economy, employment and the industrial fabric. Many companies closed, especially in textiles, clothing and footwear, and many others were involved in a downsizing process. Between the 1980s and the 1990s there was a real phenomenon of deindustrialization of the territory, which was not accompanied by the birth of new activities. 
Attempts have therefore been made to target the tertiary sector. In 1977 in Legnano was founded Antenna 3 Lombardia that was, that time the most important private TV station in Italy. However, these alternative fields did not lead to a sufficient rate of development to make up for the closure of industrial activities. It began at a time when the number of small businesses grew considerably. These processes continue to this day. 
The municipality was home to the Banca di Legnano, a regional lender. Founded on 11 June 1887, on 14 September 2013 it merged with Banca Popolare di Milano. In 2008 it had 846 employees employed in 119 branches, mostly located in Lombardy.

== Institutions and associations ==
The city has the following public institutions:

* Decentralized office of the Lombardy Region
* Decentralized office of the Metropolitan City of Milan
* INPS headquarters
* INAIL headquarters

On 4 February 2010 the new hospital was inaugurated, located in the area of &quot;via Novara&quot;, which replaced the previous nosocomium of &quot;strada statale del Sempione&quot;.

The non-profit cultural association &quot;Famiglia Legnanese&quot;, which is based in the historic Villa Jucker, is active in the municipality. One of the first and most important achievements of the association was to restore, from May 1952, the Palio di Legnano. In fact, this event, created in 1935, had been interrupted after the 1939 edition because of the World War II events.

In Legnano is home to the &quot;Società arte e storia&quot;, a cultural association that deals with the dissemination and promotion of the history and art of Legnano and which was founded in 1927 by Guido Sutermeister, who wanted the museum of city too, Museo civico Guido Sutermeister.

== Culture ==




=== Palio di Legnano ===
On the last Sunday of May, the historical re-enactment of the Battle of Legnano takes place with a parade in medieval period costumes through the streets of the city, followed by an equestrian race attended by the eight historical &quot;contrade&quot;: &quot;San Bernardino&quot;, &quot;La Flora&quot;, &quot;Legnarello&quot;, &quot;San Domenico&quot;, &quot;San Magno&quot;, &quot;San Martino&quot;, &quot;Sant&#x27;Ambrogio&quot; and &quot;Sant&#x27;Erasmo&quot;. The event, born in 1935, is known as &quot;Palio di Legnano&quot;.

The winning contrada of the Palio has the right to keep in its church, until the following year, a copy of the crucifix of Ariberto da Intimiano, a sculpture of 1936 by the artisan of the worker of Luciano Sai, on a scale original medieval cross.

=== Museums and art galleries ===
The Museo civico Guido Sutermeister preserves, in particular, material from the city and the surrounding area, the &quot;Legnanese&quot;. Most of the archaeological finds on display at the museum date back to a period between prehistory and the medieval longobard era, with particular reference to the Roman imperial era. The preserved finds testify to the frequenting of the area since the Copper Age and the existence of a sedentary civilization since the Bronze Age.

Another notable exhibition space in Legnano is the Alfa Romeo &quot;Fratelli Cozzi&quot; museum, which is housed in the basement of the dealership of the same name. The museum, strongly wanted by Pietro Cozzi, founder of the dealership, was opened in 2015 and houses about fifty Alfa Romeo models, including two models with unique features.

=== Music ===
Because of the Battle of Legnano, in which Emperor Frederick I was defeated by the Lombard League (1176), Legnano is the only other city mentioned, together with Rome, in the Italian national anthem by Goffredo Mameli. Giuseppe Verdi worked on &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot; in 1849, an opera in four acts with an Italian-language libretto by Salvadore Cammarano. It was based on the play &quot;La Bataille de Toulouse&quot; by Joseph Méry, later the co-librettist of &quot;Don Carlos&quot;.

=== Music Festival ===
Every year, since 2017, for about ten days, starting from the end of June, the Rugby Sound Festival takes place inside the Visconti Castle, after being relocated from the municipality of Parabiago. This festival is an annual music and cultural event featuring a diverse lineup of musical genres. The event is able to combine musical performances with a variety of street food offerings

=== Fashion and design ===
The fashion house Dolce &amp; Gabbana was founded and has its administrative offices in Legnano. Founded in 1985, by the end of the 1990s the company&#x27;s revenues were around US$500 million and in 2003 their revenue reached $633 million. By 2005, their turnover was €600 million.

=== Languages and literature ===
Around Legnano it&#x27;s spoken Legnanese dialect, dialect of the Lombard language (belonging to the western branch), spoken by about 30% of the population of the area where it is spread. Like all Western Lombard dialects, legnanese is a Romance language derived from Latin with a Celtic substrate and longobard superstratum. In Legnanese dialect there are those who find traces of the languages of the peoples prior to the Latinization of the region, in particular the ancient Ligurian, although the data on the actual influence of this linguistic substrate are few and of varying interpretation. The linguistic influence of the Celts on the local speakers of Altomilanese was conspicuous, so much so that even today the dialect of Legnano is classified as &quot;Gallo-Italic&quot;. However, it was the Roman domination, which supplanted the Celtic one, that shaped the local idiom spoken in Legnanese, so much so that the lexicon and grammar of this dialect is of Romance derivation.

In the dialect of Legnano are written the performances of the Italian dialect company &quot;I Legnanesi&quot;. Founded by Felice Musazzi and Tony Barlocco in 1949, it is the most famous example of &quot;en travesti&quot; theatre in Italy: it is one of the best-known companies in the European dialectal theatre scene.

=== Cuisine ===
In Legnano are widespread many dishes of Lombard cuisine like &quot;risotto&quot; (above all &quot;risotto alla milanese&quot;, which contains saffron), &quot;ossobuco&quot;, &quot;mostarda&quot;, &quot;cotoletta&quot;, &quot;cassoeula&quot; and &quot;panettone&quot;. Common in the whole Insubria area are &quot;bruscitti&quot;, originating from Alto Milanese, which consist in a braised meat dish cut very thin and cooked in wine and fennel seeds, historically obtained by stripping leftover meat.

=== Sport ===
Legnano hosted the 25th edition of European Fencing Championships. The 2012 European Fencing Championships took place from 15 to 20 June 2012 in the Visconti Castle of Legnano and in the PalaBorsani in Castellanza.

In Legnano held the Coppa Bernocchi, a European bicycle race. Since 2005, the bicycle race has been organised as a 1.1 event on the UCI Europe Tour. It is the last race of Trittico Lombardo, which includes three races held around the region of Lombardy in three consecutive days. These races are Tre Valli Varesine, Coppa Ugo Agostoni and Coppa Bernocchi. Coppa Bernocchi is one of the most historic cycling races in Europe, with nearly a hundred years of history, and one of the most important in Italy.

&quot;Legnano&quot; is a brand of lightweight racing bicycles, named for the city in which they were produced. Notably, celebrated racers Alfredo Binda, Learco Guerra, Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi rode Legnano bicycles. Active from 1906 to 1966 was its racing team. The &quot;Legnano&quot; cycling team is ranked as the 6th most successful cycling team in history.

<text>A barred spiral galaxy is a spiral galaxy with a central bar-shaped structure composed of stars. Bars are found in about two thirds of all spiral galaxies in the local universe, and generally affect both the motions of stars and interstellar gas within spiral galaxies and can affect spiral arms as well. The Milky Way Galaxy, where the Solar System is located, is classified as a barred spiral galaxy.

Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies of this type as &quot;SB&quot; (spiral, barred) in his Hubble sequence and arranged them into sub-categories based on how open the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms, while SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb-type galaxies lie in between the two. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy. A new type, SBm, was subsequently created to describe somewhat irregular barred spirals, such as the Magellanic Clouds, which were once classified as irregular galaxies, but have since been found to contain barred spiral structures. Among other types in Hubble&#x27;s classifications for the galaxies are the spiral galaxy, elliptical galaxy and irregular galaxy.

Although theoretical models of galaxy formation and evolution had not previously expected galaxies becoming stable enough to host bars very early in the universe&#x27;s history, evidence has recently emerged of the existence of numerous spiral galaxies in the early universe.
==Bars==

Barred galaxies are apparently predominant, with surveys showing that up to two-thirds of all spiral galaxies develop a bar. The creation of the bar is generally thought to be the result of a density wave radiating from the center of the galaxy whose effects reshape the orbits of the inner stars. This effect builds over time to stars orbiting farther out, which creates a self-perpetuating bar structure.

The bar structure is believed to act as a type of stellar nursery, channeling gas inwards from the spiral arms through orbital resonance, fueling star birth in the vicinity of its center. This process is also thought to explain why many barred spiral galaxies have active galactic nuclei, such as that seen in the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy.

Bars are thought to be temporary phenomena in the lives of spiral galaxies; the bar structures decay over time, transforming galaxies from barred spirals to more &quot;regular&quot; spiral patterns. Past a certain size the accumulated mass of the bar compromises the stability of the overall bar structure. Simulations show that many bars likely experience a &quot;buckling&quot; event in which a disturbance in the orbital resonances of stars in the bar structure leads to an inward collapse in which the bar becomes thicker and shorter though the exact mechanism behind this buckling instability remains hotly debated. Barred spiral galaxies with high mass accumulated in their center thus tend to have short, stubby bars. Such buckling phenomena are significantly suppressed and delayed by the presence of a supermassive black hole in the galactic center but occur nonetheless.

Since so many spiral galaxies have bar structures, it is likely that they are recurring phenomena in spiral galaxy development. The oscillating evolutionary cycle from spiral galaxy to barred spiral galaxy is thought to take on average about two billion years.

Recent studies have confirmed the idea that bars are a sign of galaxies reaching full maturity as the &quot;formative years&quot; end. A 2008 investigation found that only 20 percent of the spiral galaxies in the distant past possessed bars, compared with about 65 percent of their local counterparts.

==Grades==
The general classification is &quot;SB&quot; (spiral barred). The sub-categories are based on how open or tight the arms of the spiral are. SBa types feature tightly bound arms. SBc types are at the other extreme and have loosely bound arms. SBb galaxies lie in between. SBm describes somewhat irregular barred spirals. SB0 is a barred lenticular galaxy.

<doc id="921433" wikidata="Q7749836" url="?curid=921433" title="The Man">
<text>&quot;The Man&quot; is a slang phrase, mainly used in the United States, to refer to figures of authority, including members of the government. Though typically used as a derogatory connotation, the phrase may also be used as a term of respect or praise. The phrase &quot;the Man is keeping me down&quot; is commonly used to describe oppression, while the phrase &quot;stick it to the Man&quot; encourages civil resistance to authority figures.

==History==

In the Hebrew Bible, the Hebrew phrase &quot;Ha Ish&quot; (meaning &#x27;the Man&#x27;) is used by Joseph&#x27;s brothers to refer to his position as the viceroy of Egypt. As an English language phrase meaning &quot;the boss&quot;, the phrase dates back to 1918. In the Southern United States, the phrase came to be applied to any person or group in a position of authority, or to the concept of authority in abstract terms. From the 1950s onwards, the phrase was also a code word used among the American underworld for law enforcement in the United States. The term is used several times by Paul Newman&#x27;s eponymous character in the 1967 prison drama &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; and by Peter Fonda&#x27;s character in the Wild Angels in &quot;We wanna be free to ride our machines without being hassled by The Man.&quot;

The use of this term was expanded to counterculture groups and their resistance to authority, such as the Yippies, which, according to a May 19, 1969 article in the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, had the &quot;avowed aim ... to destroy &#x27;The Man&#x27;, their term for the present system of government&quot;. The term eventually found its way into humorous usage, such as in a December 1979 motorcycle ad from the magazine &quot;Easyriders&quot; which featured the tagline: &quot;California residents: Add 6% sales tax for The Man.&quot; In the 1969 song &quot;Proud Mary&quot; by Creedence Clearwater Revival, the singer finds protection from &quot;the man&quot; and salvation from his working-class pains in the nurturing spirit and generosity of simple people who &quot;are happy to give&quot; even &quot;if you have no money.&quot;

In present day, the phrase has been popularized in commercials and cinema. It was featured particularly prominently as a recurring motif in the 2003 film &quot;School of Rock&quot;. The film &quot;Undercover Brother&quot; had as a plot element a fictional organization headed by &quot;The Man&quot;, an actual man in charge of oppressing African Americans. In January 2021, the GameStop short squeeze was primarily triggered to &quot;fight the man&quot; by users of the subreddit r/wallstreetbets, an Internet forum on the social news website Reddit, some of whom held anger towards Wall Street hedge funds for their role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis, and the general democratization of the stock market coupled with the ability of retail traders to communicate instantaneously through social media.

===Use as praise===
The term has also been used as an approbation or form of praise. This may refer to the recipient&#x27;s status as the leader or authority within a particular context, who is afraid of other people in society, or it might be assumed to be a shortened form of a phrase like &quot;He is the man (who is in charge).&quot; In more modern usage, it can be a superlative compliment (&quot;you da man!&quot;) indicating that the subject is currently standing out amongst their peers even though they have no special designation or rank, such as a basketball player who is performing better than the other players on the court. It can also be used as a genuine compliment with an implied, slightly exaggerated or sarcastic tone, usually indicating that the person has indeed impressed the speaker but by doing something relatively trivial. The phrase has also been used in professional wrestling to refer to the top stars in the business. Some notable examples include Ric Flair, Stan Hansen, and Becky Lynch.

<text>In Greek mythology, Comus (; , &quot;Kōmos&quot;) is the god of festivity, revels and nocturnal dalliances. Cup-bearer of the god Dionysus, he was represented as a winged youth or a child-like satyr. His mythology occurs only in later antiquity. During his festivals in Ancient Greece, men and women exchanged clothes. He was depicted as a young man on the point of unconsciousness from drink, with a wreath of flowers on his head.

== Comus in art and literature ==
A description of Comus as he appeared in painting is found in &quot;Imagines&quot; (Greek Εἰκόνες, translit. Eikones) by Philostratus the Elder, a Greek writer and sophist of the 3rd century AD.

Dionysos sails to the revels of [the island of] Andros and, his ship now moored in the harbour, he leads a mixed throng of Satyroi (Satyrs) and Bakkhantes (Bacchantes) and all the Seilenoi (Silens). He leads Gelos (Laughter) and Komos (Comus, Revelry), two spirits most gay and most fond of the drinking-bout, that with the greatest delight he may reap the river&#x27;s harvest.

In Renaissance times, an allegorical painting of the Reign of Comus was begun by Mantegna for the Studiolo of Isabella d&#x27;Este and was completed by Lorenzo Costa in 1511/12. This pictured Comus as the ruler of a land of bacchanals, seated on the left in the company of Venus and Cupid, beside an inlet of the sea. John Milton&#x27;s later masque of &quot;Comus&quot; (1634) invents a new genealogy for the god, describing him as the son of Bacchus and Circe. A licentious figure here, as suggested in Costa&#x27;s allegory too, his attempts to seduce a virtuous lady whom he has kidnapped are only narrowly defeated by her brothers.

There have been a number of paintings of episodes from the play, including a set of eight watercolours commissioned from William Blake in 1801; Samuel Palmer&#x27;s &quot;The Dell of Comus&quot; (1855, now in the Brighton Museum); and Edwin Landseer&#x27;s &quot;The Defeat of Comus&quot;, originally painted in 1843 for the garden pavilion in the grounds of Buckingham Palace.

As a dramatic character, Comus also appears at the start of Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque &quot;Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue&quot; (1618) and in &quot;Les fêtes de Paphos&quot; (&quot;The Festivals of Paphos&quot;, 1758), an opéra-ballet by Jean-Joseph Cassanéa de Mondonville. In addition, he features in the baroque operas &quot;Les plaisirs de Versailles&quot; (1682) by Marc-Antoine Charpentier and &quot;King Arthur&quot; (1691) by Henry Purcell and John Dryden.

During the 18th century a Temple of Comus was built as a venue in the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens, where it was depicted by Canaletto during his visit to London and later made the subject of a popular print.

<text>The King&#x27;s Singers are a British a cappella vocal ensemble founded in 1968. They are named after King&#x27;s College in Cambridge, England, where the group was formed by six choral scholars. In the United Kingdom, their popularity peaked in the 1970s and early 1980s. Thereafter they began to reach a wider American audience, appearing frequently on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; in the United States. In 1987, they were prominently featured as guests on the Emmy Award-winning ABC television special &quot;Julie Andrews: The Sound of Christmas&quot;.

Today the ensemble travels worldwide for its performances, appearing in around 125 concerts each year, mostly in Europe, the US and East Asia, having recently added the People&#x27;s Republic of China to their list of touring territories. In recent years the group has had several UK appearances at the Royal Albert Hall Proms and concerts as part of the Three Choirs Festival and the City of London Festival. The King&#x27;s Singers consist of two countertenors, a tenor, a bass and two baritones. Their latest album is titled &quot;Close Harmony&quot;, and was released in October 2024.

==History==
The group has always consisted of six singers in total, with their membership changing over the years. None of the original members remain. The first stable incarnation of the group, from late 1969 until 1978, comprised:
* Nigel Perrin (countertenor 1)
* Alastair Hume (countertenor 2)
* Alastair Thompson (tenor)
* Anthony Holt (baritone 1) (actually from Christ Church, Oxford, rather than King&#x27;s)
* Simon Carrington (baritone 2)
* Brian Kay (bass)

The current ensemble is composed of (starting year in parentheses):
* Patrick Dunachie (countertenor 1) – (2016)
* Edward Button (countertenor 2) – (2019)
* Julian Gregory (tenor) – (2014)
* Christopher Bruerton (baritone 1) – (2012)
* Nick Ashby (baritone 2) – (2019)
* Piers Connor Kennedy (bass) – (2025)

Former members of the King&#x27;s Singers also include Jeremy Jackman, Bob Chilcott, Nigel Short, Bill Ives, Bruce Russell, Colin Mason, Gabriel Crouch, Stephen Connolly, Robin Tyson, Philip Lawson, Paul Phoenix, David Hurley, Christopher Gabbitas and Timothy Wayne-Wright. There have been 26 members of the King&#x27;s Singers since the original stable group was established in late 1969, for whom the average length of tenure is around 12 years.

Around the year 2000, the King&#x27;s Singers briefly called themselves &quot;king&#x27;singers&quot; (with a lower case k and a single s), as can be seen on the cover of &quot;Fire-Water&quot; and several song sheets. This name change did not last long.

===Early years===
Prior to the establishment of the original stable male-only group cited above, several of the parts were taken by other singers, including three females. The four founding members, who first sang together within a six-man group in 1965, were Alastair Hume, Alastair Thompson, Simon Carrington and Brian Kay. From 1965 until 1968, the first countertenor was Martin Lane and the first baritone was Richard Salter. It was this group of six singers who gave the first concert under the name of the King&#x27;s Singers on 1 May 1968 at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London, with the Academy of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Simon Preston (organ) and Barry Tuckwell (horn). Later in 1968, Martin Lane developed a brain tumour and had to withdraw from the group; Felicity Palmer stood in during 1969 until Nigel Perrin graduated that summer. Then, in 1969, Richard Salter was awarded a Richard Tauber Scholarship and left for Vienna; Nigel Beavan filled the gap until Anthony Holt became available towards the end of the year. Other singers who served as short-term group members were Eleanor Capp, Caryl Newnham and, on one occasion, James Bowman, all of whom took the first countertenor (soprano) role in 1969 when Felicity Palmer was unavailable. For a brief time after he joined the King&#x27;s Singers, Nigel Perrin also belonged to the Scholars; when double-booked, his King&#x27;s Singers&#x27; duties were fulfilled by Richard Baker (note: not the familiar BBC broadcaster). Neil Jenkins sang tenor in the early pre-King&#x27;s Singers group&#x27;s first summer singing tour in 1965, and Peter Hall was another tenor used by the fledgling pre-King&#x27;s Singers group.

===&quot;Madrigal History Tour&quot;===
In 1984, the members of the King&#x27;s Singers (who at the time included three founding members: Alastair Hume, Anthony Holt, and Simon Carrington) presented, narrated and sang in &quot;Madrigal History Tour&quot;, a six-part BBC television documentary series about the history of the madrigal in Western Europe. (The name was a play on the Beatles album &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;.) The series also featured the early music ensemble the Consort of Musicke, playing together with and separately from the King&#x27;s Singers. The series was accompanied by an album, also called &quot;Madrigal History Tour&quot;.

===20th anniversary===
The King&#x27;s Singers&#x27; 20th anniversary concert in 1988, at the Barbican, featured a surprise reunion, in which all King&#x27;s Singers to date reunited on stage, introduced individually (with membership dates, counting from 1968) by Prunella Scales.

===40th anniversary===
Fortieth anniversary celebration concerts included two &quot;best of&quot; concerts at Cadogan Hall, London, on 30 April 2008, and a performance the following day in the chapel of King&#x27;s College Cambridge, as well as concerts in Paris, Rome, Berlin, New York and Tokyo.

=== 50th anniversary ===
The King&#x27;s Singers 50th anniversary was celebrated in 2018 with a special concert at Carnegie Hall, and the release of a new album, &quot;Gold&quot;.

=== PCC concert cancellation ===
In February 2023, Pensacola Christian College cancelled the group&#x27;s concert with two hours notice. The reasons seem to have been concerns around the sexuality of a member of the group, leading to many believing it was a homophobic related cancellation.

==Influences==
The group cites its influences the Hi-Lo&#x27;s vocal jazz group, the Comedian Harmonists, the Mastersingers and (perhaps most importantly) the style of singing instilled into them by Sir David Willcocks, their director of music at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. It was this serene and precise sound, with vibrato used only as a colour rather than a default setting, that was expanded by the early King&#x27;s Singers to be used on all genres of music, from Renaissance church repertoire such as they had performed as part of the daily chapel services at the university, to pop, jazz, folk and spiritual arrangements that were soon added to their concert programmes.

The group has also inspired musicians in other countries to create similar ensembles, such as Affabre Concinui in Poland.

==Repertoire==
The King&#x27;s Singers took hold of the idea that concerts need not contain merely one form of music; audiences could be educated as well as entertained. For those who came expecting pop music there would be classical music as well, and vice versa. This started out of necessity; for their first few concerts the group simply had to perform everything they knew in order to fill a concert programme, and this included religious music from their chapel library, along with folksongs and other &quot;lollipops&quot;. 

Over the years their library has expanded so that it now includes some 2,000 works of all styles. The group is best known for its &quot;a cappella&quot; performances which have as a foundation a strong bass/baritone blend on which the other voices sit, a principle known as the &quot;Pyramid of Sound&quot;. They say the &#x27;added&#x27; baritone creates more width and depth to their sound. The two baritones and bass allow the top three parts to sit on top of the bed of sound created for them and, given that higher-pitched voices are heard more easily, the effect to the audience is one of complete balance in the overall chordal sound, despite being &#x27;outnumbered&#x27; by their lower-pitched colleagues. In addition, the King&#x27;s Singers have frequently performed with instruments, both in recordings and in concert. One of their most famous songs is &quot;You Are The New Day&quot;. They have appeared in many venues, including the famous City Varieties Theatre Leeds, with many appearances on BBC TV&#x27;s long running Music Hall variety programme, &quot;The Good Old Days&quot;. They have also appeared on TV in concert with Hinge and Bracket.

==Concert structure==
Most of their a cappella concerts are divided into five distinct groups of pieces. The first four vary widely (madrigals, folk songs, recently commissioned pieces, etc.) but are generally taken from the serious side of the group&#x27;s repertoire, but the last group of the concert is typically a &quot;close harmony&quot; set. Often it consists of lighter fare, including music of The Beatles, Billy Joel, Queen, George Gershwin, Harold Arlen or Irving Berlin, many of which have been arranged for the group by composers such as Richard Rodney Bennett, Jeremy Lubbock, Bob Chilcott, Philip Lawson and John Rutter. Sometimes the final set (in a concert of religious music) will be a spiritual harmony set – entitled &quot;Songs of Faith and Hope&quot;. This set could be composed of American Spirituals, arranged by contemporary composers, including former group members Philip Lawson and Bob Chilcott. Pieces in this set could include &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, &quot;Deep River&quot;, &quot;Down to the River to Pray&quot;, and &quot;Stand Still Jordan&quot; as well as more spiritual pop songs such as &quot;Some Folks Lives Roll Easy&quot; by Paul Simon.

As of 2020 however, the King&#x27;s Singers have begun to perform &quot;concept programmes&quot; which have a set theme running throughout. These could be simply a 60-minute first-half sequence, often performed in European cathedral concerts, with a Mass or Requiem setting providing the backbone, interspersed with other shorter works, or a more fundamental concept which infuses every piece performed. Examples of this latter art include &quot;Sacred Bridges&quot;, a programme of Jewish, Islamic and Christian settings of Psalms, performed with Vladimir Ivanoff and his ensemble &quot;Saraband&quot;. The group have also created concert programmes relating to recent CD recordings, including &quot;Landscape and Time&quot; and &quot;Treason and Dischord&quot;, the latter a programme commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot and including a script read in live performances by actors Joss Ackland and Bill Wallis. The group works closely with concert promoters and local agents to determine the best possible programme for each concert, whether for church, concert hall, open-air venue or private house.

==Modern repertoire==
The King&#x27;s Singers are also known for frequently commissioning works from contemporary composers. Starting with &quot;Timepiece&quot;, commissioned by the Camden Festival in 1972 from composer Paul Patterson (and still regularly performed today), they have continued by commissioning pieces from (amongst others) Sally Beamish, Bob Chilcott, Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, Howard Goodall, Daron Hagen, Jackson Hill, Graham Lack, Libby Larsen, György Ligeti, John McCabe, Ivan Moody, Jocelyn Pook, Geoffrey Poole, Francis Pott, Ned Rorem, Joby Talbot, Sir John Tavener and Malcolm Williamson. In 2008 they performed a piece commissioned jointly for them and the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain written by Eric Whitacre.

==Awards==
In February 2009, the King&#x27;s Singers&#x27; CD, &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album. In February 2012, they won Best Choral Performance at the 54th Grammy Awards along with Eric Whitacre for the album &quot;Light and Gold&quot;, on which they performed &quot;The Stolen Child&quot;, written for the group by Whitacre. Their DVD, &quot;Live at the BBC Proms&quot;, won a MIDEM Award at the annual ceremony in Cannes in 2010 for Best DVD Performance. In 2013 the group was inducted into the Gramophone Hall of Fame.

==Educational activities==
In addition to recording and performing, the King&#x27;s Singers have a commitment to education, often participating in master classes and workshops. Every two years they hold a residency at the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival in Lübeck, Germany, at which up to 12 a cappella groups from all over the world are taught over a period of four days, culminating in a public performance. The group also leads around a dozen additional one-off masterclasses throughout the year, normally in conjunction with concert performances and often as part of their twice-yearly US tours. During its time, the King&#x27;s Singers have taught many groups that have now become known in their own right, such as Club for Five, The Real Group, Rajaton, Singer Pur and Calmus Ensemble.

Several of the King&#x27;s Singers also arranged pieces, both for the group and pieces to publish in their line of music. Recently, Philip Lawson and Bob Chilcott have been the most prolific composers for the group.

The group established The King&#x27;s Singers Summer School in 2013 taking place on campus at Royal Holloway, University of London. The Summer School took place for a second time in 2015 and saw composer and conductor Eric Whitacre and Eton Choirbook expert Dr. Stephen Darlington as special guests. In 2017, the Summer School participants performed an Evensong at the St George&#x27;s Chapel, under the direction of Christopher Robinson. The first US Summer School took place between 13 and 19 June 2017 at DePauw University, Indiana followed by the third School at Royal Holloway on 17–22 July 2017. The King&#x27;s Singers were joined by guest clinician and former King&#x27;s Singers Bob Chilcott.

==Discography==
In 2003, the group signed with Signum Records, with whom they have now released eighteen recordings, including an experimental recording of Thomas Tallis&#x27; 40-part &quot;Spem in Alium&quot;, using modern studio multi-tracking techniques to turn their six voices into 40, the results of which can be heard on a Signum CD and Iambic Productions DVD, which includes a documentary on the making of the CD.

The group&#x27;s most successful recent CD is the 2008 &quot;Simple Gifts&quot;, a selection of 16 pop ballads, spirituals, and folk songs. It was their first full-length studio CD since the 1990s. The arrangements on the album are by former first baritone Philip Lawson, Peter Knight and former tenor Bob Chilcott, and the album was recorded at the home of Francis Rossi, of Status Quo, and engineered by Gregg Jackman, the brother of former King&#x27;s Singers countertenor Jeremy Jackman. In February 2009 &quot;Simple Gifts&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best Classical Crossover Album. An EP recording, &quot;From the Heart&quot;, was released in 2010.

In December 2007, the King&#x27;s Singers recorded a Christmas concert, &quot;Rejoice and Be Merry!&quot; with The Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square, that was released on CD on 30 September 2008; it also was released on DVD 21 October 2008. The CD featured both a cappella and accompanied songs by the King&#x27;s Singers and The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. Six tracks feature the King&#x27;s Singers alone, with another five tracks featuring the combined King&#x27;s Singer&#x27;s and Mormon Tabernacle Choir, the remaining eight tracks feature The Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The recorded concert was also broadcast on US PBS stations in December 2008. In 2011, the group released High Flight with The Concordia Choir, an album of music by three of the most popular 21st century choral composers, Eric Whitacre, Morten Lauridsen and former tenor in the group Bob Chilcott.

In October 2013, The King&#x27;s Singers released &quot;Great American Songbook&quot;, an album dedicated to American Standards from the 1920s to the 1960s, to critical acclaim. The sound on this new album marks a departure from the more acoustic albums of the past decade, using extensive post-production techniques and multi-tracking to create a more modern a cappella sound, but retaining the essence of The King&#x27;s Singers&#x27; blend and balance.

Many King&#x27;s Singers arrangements have been published, including a number compiled into song books

<text>The Mount Kumgang Tourist Region was a special administrative region of North Korea. It was established in 2002 to handle South Korean tourist traffic to Mount Kumgang (Diamond Mountain). It was one of the symbols of the South Korean Sunshine Policy. In January 2024, North Korea announced that they would close the Mount Kumgang International Tourism Administration.

==History==
=== Development and boom period ===
Beginning in 1998, South Korean and other foreign tourists were allowed to visit Mount Kumgang, traveling at first by cruise ship, and then by bus on a newly built road through the Korean Demilitarized Zone. In 2002, the area around the mountain was separated from Kangwon Province and organized as a separately administered Tourist Region, covering . From 1998 to July 2008 over one million South Koreans visited the resort, substantially less than the expected 4.9 million visits from 1999 to 2004. The resort was home to Hotel Haegumgang, a floating hotel that first operated on Australia&#x27;s Great Barrier Reef. Much of the infrastructure in the area was built by the South Korean Hyundai Asan company which received a 30-year exclusive deal to develop the region. In addition to hotels, it was also to include golf courses, ski resorts and other facilities. Developed facilities included Kumgangsan Hotel and Oikumgang Hotel, the former described as the &quot;flagship hotel&quot; for the region. By 2007 the region had reported more than 1.7 million visitors.

=== Winding down and North Korean takeover ===

In July 2008, Park Wang-ja, a 53-year-old South Korean tourist, was shot twice and killed when she entered a military area, according to the North Korean government. The South Korean request for a joint inquiry was denied. Forensic tests done on Park suggest that she was standing still or walking slowly when shot. This contradicted the North Korean claim that she was running and did not heed warnings. Immediately after the shooting, the South Korean government suspended tours to the resort. In August 2008 the North Koreans announced that they would expel &quot;unnecessary&quot; South Korean workers from the resort.

In March 2010, the DPRK government warned of &quot;extraordinary measures&quot; if the tourism ban were not lifted. On April 23, 2010, the North Korean government seized 5 properties owned by South Korea at the resort, saying that it was done &quot;in compensation for the damage the North side suffered due to the suspension of the tour for a long period.&quot; In seizing the properties, North Korea also alluded to the Baengnyeong incident, showing displeasure with South Korea blaming North Korea for the sinking of the ship. Hyundai Asan losses from this incident are estimated at hundreds of million of dollars lost from investment, and further losses due to suspension of tourism-generated income.

Starting in April 2010, North Korea permitted companies to run tours from the North Korean side, making it appear increasingly unlikely that tours would be resumed from the South. However, on October 1, 2010, news reports said, &quot;Red Cross officials from the two Koreas agreed Friday to hold reunions for families separated by the Korean War amid mixed signals from North Korea on easing tensions over the sinking of a South Korean warship. One hundred families from each country will attend the meetings from Oct. 30 to Nov. 5 at a hotel and reunion center at the North&#x27;s scenic Diamond Mountain resort, Unification Ministry spokeswoman Lee Jong-joo said.&quot; By September 2011 North Korea had begun operating cruises directly from Rason in north-eastern North Korea, to the port in Mount Kumgang, offering visitors the chance to stay in the resorts previously run by the south. Although aimed primarily at Chinese guests, western companies also offered the tours.

Despite the Lee Myung-bak government expressing a verbal anti-North Korean stance, the head of the government-funded Korea Institute for National Unification, Kim Tae-u, proposed that the South Korean government reopen negotiations on the Mount Kumgang Tourist Region with North Korea without any official apology for North Korea&#x27;s military actions towards the ROKS Cheonan sinking and the Bombardment of Yeonpyeong.

A 2018 travel book described most facilities in the region closed due to lack of visitors. Around the same time, South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korea&#x27;s Kim Jong-un agreed to restart tours to the resort.

In 2019, Kim Jong-un visited the site and criticised the facilities: &quot;They are not only very backward in terms of architecture but look so shabby as they are not properly cared for. The buildings are just a hotchpotch with no national character at all.&quot; He also ordered the South Korean facilities to be replaced by &quot;modern facilities&quot;. This was criticized by the South Korean government which instead proposed renovating the complex. In January 2020, the North Korean government said that redevelopment of the site was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic.

As of late 2022 there were reports based on satellite imagery that the resort&#x27;s facilities, including the golf course and the Hotel Haegumgang floating hotel, were being dismantled pursuant to the directives from leader Kim Jong-un. Other facilities that were destroyed include the Mt. Paektu General Museum and Cultural Center, as well as the apartment buildings at the Diamond Mountain Golf Resort and Spa. No new building was spotted in the area.

On January 15, 2024, it was announced that North Korea would close the Mount Kumgang International Tourism Administration.

<text>Louis-François Roubiliac (or Roubilliac, or Roubillac) (31 August 1702 – 11 January 1762) was a French sculptor who worked in England. One of the four most prominent sculptors in London working in the rococo style, he was described by Margaret Whinney as &quot;probably the most accomplished sculptor ever to work in England&quot;.

==Life==
Roubiliac was born in Lyon. According to J. T. Smith he was trained in the studio of Balthasar Permoser in Dresden, where Permoser, a product of Bernini&#x27;s workshop, was working for the Protestant Elector of Saxony, and later in Paris, in the studio of his fellow-townsman Nicolas Coustou. Disappointed in receiving second place in the competition for the Prix de Rome, 1730, he received his medal but not the chance to study in Rome; he moved to London instead. In 1735 he married Caroline Magdalene Hélot, a member of the French Huguenot community in London, at St Martin-in-the-Fields.

In London, he was employed by &quot;Carter, the statuary&quot; but was introduced by Edward Walpole, son of the Prime Minister, to Henry Cheere, who took him on as an assistant. Sir Edward&#x27;s intervention resulted in the commission for half the busts in the series for Trinity College, Dublin, and for the Duke of Argyll monument commission, if Horace Walpole is correct in his &quot;Anecdotes of Painting in England&quot;.

In 1738 he had a great success with a seated figure of Handel, commissioned by Jonathan Tyers, owner of the Vauxhall Gardens. The statue blends realism and allegory: Handel is shown in modern dress, but plays an Ancient Greek lyre, and has a &quot;putto&quot; sitting at his feet. It is now in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Roubiliac was recommended for this commission by Cheere. Its prominent placement in the fashionable pleasure grounds &quot;fixed Roubiliac&#x27;s fame&quot; as Walpole put it, and he was able to open the studio in St Martin&#x27;s Lane that he maintained until his death. Roubiliac was a founding member of the St Martin&#x27;s Lane Academy, a professional association and fraternity of rococo artists that was a forerunner to the Royal Academy. His studio in St Martin&#x27;s Lane became its meeting room; its members came together again for his funeral.

He earned his living from commissions for portrait busts and monuments for country churches until 1745, when he received the first of his commissions for a funeral monument in Westminster Abbey, for one commemorating the Duke of Argyll (installed 1749). George Vertue was one of the work&#x27;s many admirers; it showed, he thought, &quot;the greatness of his genius in his invention, design and execution, in every part equal, if not superior, to any others&quot; outshining &quot;for nobleness and skill all those before done by the best sculptors this fifty years past&quot; The mourning figure of &quot;Eloquence&quot;, the notably unkind John Thomas Smith found to be &quot;such a memorial of his powers, that even his friend Pope could not have equalled it by an epitaph&quot;.

Even when the patrons were prominent, the churches in which the monuments were installed often lay deep in the English countryside: the monuments to the Duke of Montagu (1752), and of his wife Mary (1753), are in the church at Warkton, Northamptonshire; Horace Walpole, an inveterate country house visitor, noted them: his verdict was &quot;well-performed and magnificent, but wanting in simplicity&quot;.

Neoclassical taste, trained to appreciate svelte line and idealised refinements of nature, did not favour Roubiliac&#x27;s vigour and immediacy: to J.T. Smith the legs of the figure of Hercules, supporting the bust of Sir Peter Warren in Roubiliac&#x27;s monument in Westminster Abbey (1753), seemed &quot;copied from a chairman&#x27;s, and the arms from those of a waterman&quot;.

About the mid-century Roubiliac was employed for a time as a modeller at the Chelsea porcelain factory, a new outlet for sculptors&#x27; talent in Britain; its entrepreneur Nicholas Sprimont stood godfather to the sculptor&#x27;s daughter Sophie, in 1744. For a friend like Thomas Hudson he was willing to sculpt figures of &quot;Painting&quot; and &quot;Sculpture&quot; to ornament a marble chimneypiece in Hudson&#x27;s house in Great Queen Street, Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields. For his friend William Hogarth he even carved a portrait of Hogarth&#x27;s dog &quot;Trump&quot;; it was later repeated in Chelsea porcelain and Wedgwood. His second wife (a considerable heiress) having recently died, he took a brief tour to Italy towards the end of 1752 in the company of several artists.

Soon after his death an auction sale of the contents of his studio was held, on 12–15 May 1762, from which Dr Matthew Maty purchased a number of his plaster and terracotta models, which he presented to the newly-founded British Museum. Prices were derisory, and when his effects were totalled up, Roubiliac&#x27;s creditors, J.T. Smith said, had to be satisfied with one shilling sixpence in the pound.

Roubiliac was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields, where he had been married.

==Works==
Roubiliac was mainly employed for portrait busts, and from the 1740s especially for sepulchral monuments; these were, in essence, the two outlets for free-standing sculpture in Britain at the time. He also made several full-length portrait sculptures. His most important works in Westminster Abbey are the monuments to the Duke of Argyll (1748) – the work which first established his fame as a sculptor – Handel (1761), Sir Peter Warren, Field Marshal Wade, General Fleming, General William Hargrave and Lady Elizabeth Nightingale (1761).

At Cambridge he made the statues of George I in the Senate House, Cambridge, the Duke of Somerset and Sir Isaac Newton. Trinity College, Cambridge, has a series of busts by him of distinguished members of the college. The statue of George II erected in Golden Square, London, was also his work.

The celebrated bust of William Shakespeare, known as the Davenant bust, in the possession of the Garrick Club, London, must be attributed to Roubiliac. His friend Sir Joshua Reynolds painted a copy of the Chandos Portrait for him. The statue of Shakespeare (1758), a commission from David Garrick to be set up in his garden shrine to Shakespeare at Hampton House, Twickenham, and bequeathed by the actor to the English nation, is in the British Museum; a terracotta model dated 1757 is in collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum.

<text>Peter Joseph Mahovlich (born October 10, 1946) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player, coach and executive. Known in his playing years as &quot;Little M&quot;, as his older brother Frank was the &quot;Big M&quot;, Mahovlich played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with several clubs, including the Montreal Canadiens, where he played with his brother and was a member of four Stanley Cup championship teams.

==Early life==
Mahovlich played as a first baseman on his high school baseball team, beating out Gord Kirke for the position. Like his brother Frank, Peter attended St. Michael&#x27;s College School in Toronto (1961-63) where he played on their Junior B Hockey team.

==Playing career==
Mahovlich was drafted second overall by the Detroit Red Wings in the 1963 NHL amateur draft. He played for the National Hockey League&#x27;s Detroit Red Wings twice, Montreal Canadiens, Pittsburgh Penguins, the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Hamilton Red Wings, the AHL&#x27;s Pittsburgh Hornets, Montreal Voyageurs, Adirondack Red Wings, the Central Hockey League&#x27;s Fort Worth Wings and the IHL&#x27;s Toledo Goaldiggers.

Mahovlich was an important contributor to the Canadiens&#x27; cup-winning teams of 1971, 1973, 1976, and 1977, before eventually being traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. He enjoyed a breakout season in 1970–71, scoring 35 goals in the regular season and another 10 in the playoffs as the Canadiens won the championship. His best year came in 1974–75 when he racked up 117 points as part of a deep forward corps that included the likes of Guy Lafleur, Jacques Lemaire, Yvan Cournoyer, Steve Shutt and Bob Gainey. He hit the 100-point mark again the following year, finishing with 105.

Immensely popular as a Pittsburgh Penguin, cheers of &quot;Pete, Pete&quot; were common when Mahovlich made one of his end-to-end dashes up ice. He was characterized as easy-going, joyful, and a party-goer in Ken Dryden&#x27;s book &quot;The Game&quot;.

In his 16-year NHL career, Mahovlich totalled 288 goals and 485 assists for 773 points in 884 games. Internationally, he was a member of the 1972 Summit Series, in which he scored a memorable shorthanded goal in Game 2 of the series. He also played on the 1976 Canada Cup team.

==Post-playing career==
After his retirement, Mahovlich was head coach of the Toledo Goaldiggers, IHL Colorado Rangers (co-coach), Denver Rangers, CHL Fort Worth Fire, and the AHL Cape Breton Oilers. He is also the brother of former Canadian Senator and former hockey star Frank Mahovlich. The two were teammates on the Red Wings from 1967 to 1969 and on the Canadiens from 1971 to 1974.

Mahovlich was a scout for the Edmonton Oilers from 1995 to 1997 before joining the Tampa Bay Lightning and then the Atlanta Thrashers. He is currently a pro scout for the Florida Panthers.

<doc id="921450" wikidata="Q6780211" url="?curid=921450" title="Mary MacLane">
<text>Mary MacLane (May 1, 1881 – &quot;c&quot;. August 6, 1929) was a controversial Canadian-born American writer whose frank memoirs helped usher in the confessional style of autobiographical writing. MacLane was known as the &quot;Wild Woman of Butte&quot;.

MacLane was a popular author for her time, scandalizing the populace with her shocking bestselling first memoir and to a lesser extent her two following books. She was considered wild and uncontrollable, a reputation she nurtured, and was openly bisexual as well as a vocal feminist. In her writings, she compared herself to another frank young memoirist, Marie Bashkirtseff, who died a few years after MacLane was born, and H. L. Mencken called her &quot;the Butte Bashkirtseff&quot;.

== Early life and family ==
MacLane was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada in 1881, but her family moved to the Red River area of Minnesota, settling in Fergus Falls, which her father helped develop. After his death in 1889, her mother remarried a family friend and lawyer, H. Gysbert Klenze. Soon after, the family moved to Montana, first settling in Great Falls and finally in Butte, where Klenze drained the family funds pursuing mining and other ventures. MacLane spent the remainder of her life in the United States. She began writing for her school paper in 1898.

== Writing ==

From the beginning, MacLane&#x27;s writing was characterized by a direct, fiery, individualistic style. She was, however, also influenced by such American regional realists as John Townsend Trowbridge (with whom she exchanged a few letters), Maria Louise Pool, and Hamlin Garland.

In 1901, MacLane wrote her first book, which she originally titled &quot;I Await the Devil&#x27;s Coming&quot;. Prior to the manuscript&#x27;s printing the following year, MacLane&#x27;s publisher, Herbert S. Stone &amp; Company, altered the title to &quot;.&quot; The book proved to be an immediate success, especially among young women, selling over 100,000 copies during its first month of release. It, however, was pilloried by conservative critics and readers, and even lightly ridiculed by H. L. Mencken. 

Some critics have suggested that even by today&#x27;s standards, MacLane&#x27;s writing is raw, honest, unflinching, self-aware, sensual, and extreme. She wrote openly about egoism and her own self-love, about sexual attraction and love for other women, and even about her desire to marry the Devil.

Her second book, &quot;&quot;, was published by Stone in 1903. More experimental in style than her debut book, it was not as sensational, though MacLane was said to have made a fairly large amount of money.

Her final book, &quot;I, Mary Maclane: A Diary of Human Days&quot; was published by Frederick A. Stokes in 1917 and sold moderately well but may have been overshadowed by America&#x27;s recent entry into World War I.

In 1917, she wrote and starred in the 90-minute autobiographical silent film titled &quot;Men Who Have Made Love to Me&quot;, for Essanay Studios. Produced by film pioneer George Kirke Spoor and based on MacLane&#x27;s 1910 article of the same title for a Butte newspaper, it has been speculated to have been an extremely early, if not the earliest, sustained breaking of the fourth wall in cinema, with the writer-star directly addressing the audience. Though stills and some subtitles have survived, the film is now believed to be lost.

== Influence ==
Among the numerous authors who referenced, parodied, or answered MacLane were Mark Twain, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Harriet Monroe, lawyer Clarence Darrow, Ring Lardner Jr., Sherwood Anderson and Daniel Clowes in Ice Haven. Gertrude Sanborn published an optimistic riposte to MacLane&#x27;s 1917 &quot;I, Mary MacLane&quot; under the title &quot;I, Citizen of Eternity&quot; (1920).

== Personal life ==
MacLane had always chafed, or felt, &quot;&quot;anxiety&quot; of place&quot;, at living in Butte, a mining city far from cultural centers, and used the money from her first book&#x27;s sales to travel to Chicago and then throughout the East Coast. She lived in Rockland, Massachusetts, wintering in St. Augustine, Florida, from 1903 to 1908, then in Greenwich Village from 1908 to 1909, where she continued writing and, by her later published accounts, living a decadent and Bohemian existence. She was close friends with the feminist writer Inez Haynes Irwin, who is referenced in some of MacLane&#x27;s 1910 writing in a Butte newspaper and who in turn mentioned MacLane in a 1911 magazine article.

For a period, she lived with her friend Caroline M. Branson, who had been the long-time companion of Maria Louise Pool until the latter&#x27;s death in 1898. They lived in the Rockland house that Pool left to Branson. Mary Maclane also had a multi-decade friendship with Harriet Monroe.

MacLane died in Chicago in early August 1929, aged 48. She was less frequently discussed through the mid to late 20th century, and her prose remained out of print until late 1993, when &quot;The Story of Mary MacLane&quot; and some of her newspaper feature work was republished in &quot;Tender Darkness: A Mary MacLane Anthology&quot;.

== Contemporary collections and performances ==
In 2014, the publisher of &quot;Tender Darkness&quot; (1993) published an expanded anthology titled &quot;Human Days: A Mary MacLane Reader&quot; (with a Foreword by Bojana Novakovic).

In 2011, Novakovic wrote and performed &quot;The Story of Mary MacLane – By Herself&quot; in Melbourne, Australia, which was subsequently staged in Sydney, Australia in 2012.

In the 2010s, MacLane&#x27;s first book was translated into French, Danish, and Spanish. Reclam published a German edition of &quot;I Await the Devil&#x27;s Coming in 2020&quot;, followed by 2021 editions of &quot;My Friend Annabel Lee&quot; and I, Mary MacLane.

<text>Michael Austin Cera ( ; ; born June 7, 1988) is a Canadian actor. Over his career he has received nominations for a British Academy Film Award, three Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Awards, four Screen Actors Guild Awards, and a Tony Award. 

Cera became known for portraying leading roles in a string of comedic films such as &quot;Superbad&quot; (2007), &quot;Juno&quot; (2007), &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; (2010), &quot;Nick &amp; Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot; (2008), and &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot; (2009). He took supporting roles in both comedies and dramas including &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot; (2002), &quot;This Is the End&quot; (2013), &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot; (2017), &quot;Person to Person&quot; (2017), &quot;Gloria Bell&quot; (2019), &quot;Barbie&quot; (2023), and &quot;Dream Scenario&quot; (2023). He voiced Dick Grayson/Robin in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; (2017), Barry in &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016) and Hank in &quot;Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank&quot; (2022).

Cera gained prominence portraying George Michael Bluth in the Fox sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; from 2003 to 2006 and then again from 2013 to 2019. He took a leading role in the Hulu comedy series &quot;Life &amp; Beth&quot; (2022–2024), and also voiced roles including reprising his roles as Scott Pilgrim in the Netflix series &quot;Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&quot; (2023), and Barry in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Sausage Party: Foodtopia&quot; (2024).

Cera is also known for his Broadway performances in the Kenneth Lonergan plays &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot; in 2014, &quot;Lobby Hero&quot; in 2018, for which he received a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play, and &quot;The Waverly Gallery&quot; in 2019. In addition to acting, Cera is a musician, having released his debut album &quot;True That&quot; in 2014. Cera has also performed as the touring bassist for indie rock supergroup Mister Heavenly.

==Early life==
Cera was born on June 7, 1988, in Brampton, Ontario. He is the son of Linda (née Cockman) and Luigi Cera, a technician. He is of Sicilian descent through his father. His parents both worked for Xerox. Cera has an older sister, Jordan, and a younger sister, Molly. He became interested in acting after viewing &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; repeatedly when sick with the chicken pox at the age of three. Cera memorized all the dialogue and idolized Bill Murray. He enrolled in The Second City, Toronto, and took improvisation classes.

Cera attended Conestoga Public School, Robert H. Lagerquist Senior Public School, and Heart Lake Secondary School until grade nine. After starting acting, he completed school online through grade 12.

==Career==
===1999–2008: Child acting and breakthrough===
His first role was an unpaid appearance in a Tim Hortons summer camp commercial. That appearance eventually landed him a position in a Pillsbury commercial, in which he poked the Pillsbury Doughboy and had his first role with lines.

In 1999, Cera was cast as Larrabe Hicks in the Canadian children&#x27;s show &quot;I Was a Sixth Grade Alien&quot;, which ran for two seasons. That year, he also appeared in the television films &quot;What Katy Did&quot; and &quot;Switching Goals&quot;, starring the Olsen twins.

The next year Cera made his theatrical film debut in the science fiction film &quot;Frequency&quot; (2000) as the son of Noah Emmerich&#x27;s character. Cera also appeared in the films &quot;Steal This Movie!&quot; and &quot;Ultimate G&#x27;s: Zac&#x27;s Flying Dream&quot; in 2000. He had his first leading role in the latter film, which was presented in IMAX theaters. Cera appeared in several television films in 2001, including &quot;My Louisiana Sky&quot; and &quot;The Familiar Stranger&quot;. He also began voicing Josh Spitz in the animated series &quot;Braceface&quot;, which he continued until 2004.

In 2002, Cera played the young Chuck Barris (played by Sam Rockwell) in the George Clooney-directed film &quot;Confessions of a Dangerous Mind&quot;. He provided the voice for Brother Bear – an anthropomorphic bear – in the 2003 &quot;The Berenstain Bears&quot; animated series, which aired for three seasons.

He had a role in the critically panned Fox pilot &quot;The Grubbs&quot; in 2002, which was never aired. But Cera successfully auditioned for a part in another Fox sitcom, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. This began airing in November 2003 and ran for three seasons. The show follows the formerly wealthy and dysfunctional Bluth family, with Cera playing George Michael Bluth, the teenage son of character Michael Bluth, played by Jason Bateman. After three seasons, Fox canceled the series in 2006 due to low viewership, although it had received critical acclaim. In 2006, Cera created and starred in a parody of &quot;Impossible is Nothing&quot;, a video résumé created by Aleksey Vayner. Cera and his &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Alia Shawkat guest-starred as a pair of college students in the teen noir drama &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;, in the episode &quot;The Rapes of Graff&quot; in 2006.

Along with best friend Clark Duke, Cera wrote and starred in a series of short videos released on their website. Duke originated the idea, as he was enrolled at Loyola Marymount University and used their videos for his film school studies. In 2007, the pair signed a deal with CBS Television to write, produce, direct, and act in a short-form comedy series entitled &quot;Clark and Michael&quot;. The show featured guest stars such as David Cross, Andy Richter and Patton Oswalt, and was distributed via CBS&#x27;s internet channel, CBS Innertube.
In May 2007, Cera appeared in a staged comedy video that shows him being fired from the lead role of the film &quot;Knocked Up&quot;, after belittling and arguing with its director Judd Apatow, in a scene that mocks the David O. Russell blow up on the set of &quot;I Heart Huckabees&quot;. Cera starred in the Apatow-produced teen comedy &quot;Superbad&quot; alongside Jonah Hill. Their characters in the film – two virgin teenagers about to graduate from high school whose party plans go awry – were based on the comedy&#x27;s writers Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg. &quot;Superbad&quot; was released in cinemas in August 2007, topping the US box office for two weeks in a row.

Cera&#x27;s performance was critically acclaimed: &quot;The Atlantic&quot; reviewer said that the film &quot;belongs to Michael Cera&quot; for capturing &quot;teenage sexual abashment as indelibly as he did in the role of George Michael [on &quot;Arrested Development&quot;].&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that he was &quot;excellent&quot; and CNN praised Cera and Hill for playing &quot;off each other beautifully&quot;.

In November 2007, Cera hosted a live, staged version of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;; it was not broadcast due to the ongoing 2007 Writers Guild of America Strike. In his second film of 2007, Cera co-starred in &quot;Juno&quot; as Paulie Bleeker, a teenager who has impregnated his long-time school friend Juno (played by Elliot Page). For &quot;Superbad&quot; and &quot;Juno&quot;, Cera won Breakthrough Artist in the Austin Film Critics Association Awards 2007, and was included in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&#x27;s&quot; &quot;30 Under 30&quot; list in February 2008.

Cera starred alongside Kat Dennings in the romantic comedy-drama &quot;Nick &amp; Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot; (2008), in which they played two strangers who bond over their shared love of a band and try to find their secret show. He starred in the comedy &quot;Extreme Movie&quot; (2008), which was composed of vignettes focusing on teen sex. Cera held a recurring role on the comedy series &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot; from 2008 to 2016 as Sal Viscuso, a hospital staffer who is known only by his voice through an intercom.

===2009–2013: Varied success and stage debut===

Cera played a fictionalized version of himself in the independent romantic comedy &quot;Paper Heart&quot; (2009). It explored the fictional relationship between Cera and the film&#x27;s writer Charlyne Yi, also playing herself. Cera and Yi composed the film&#x27;s score together. That year Cera starred opposite Jack Black in the comedy &quot;Year One&quot;, set during the Stone Age. The film, directed by Harold Ramis, was poorly received, although &quot;Time&quot; magazine critic Mary Pols said that Cera&#x27;s performance saved the film from being a &quot;catastrophe&quot;. In his final film of 2009, Cera starred in &quot;Youth in Revolt&quot;, an adaptation of the eponymous novel. He played a shy teenager named Nick Twisp who creates a destructive alter ego, François Dillinger, after becoming smitten with a girl, played by Portia Doubleday.

Cera had also begun to write. His first published short story, &quot;Pinecone&quot;, appeared in &quot;McSweeney&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; thirtieth issue in 2009.

Cera was cast as Scott Pilgrim in the film adaptation of the graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O&#x27;Malley. The film&#x27;s director, Edgar Wright, had seen his work in &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and believed that Cera was an actor &quot;audiences will still follow even when the character is being a bit of an ass.&quot; The film, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot;, follows Pilgrim, a musician who must battle the seven evil exes of his girlfriend Ramona (played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead). It was released in cinemas in August 2010. It did poorly at the box office, grossing $47.7 million against a production budget of $85–90 million.

Cera made a guest appearance in &quot;The Daughter Also Rises&quot;, a 2012 episode of the animated sitcom &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, as the voice of Nick, a love interest to Lisa Simpson.

Cera made his theater debut in a production of Kenneth Lonergan&#x27;s play &quot;This Is Our Youth&quot; in a two-week run during March 2012 at the Sydney Opera House. The play also featured his &quot;Scott Pilgrim&quot; co-stars Kieran Culkin and Tavi Gevinson. A Broadway production at the Cort Theater opened in September 2014 and closed in January 2015. &quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic Ben Brantley praised Cera for achieving &quot;something remarkable&quot;: &quot;the sense of an amorphous being assuming and losing shape in the course of roughly 12 hours&quot;. Also in 2012, Cera played a supporting role in the drama &quot;The End of Love&quot; and appeared in the short film &quot;The Immigrant&quot;.

&quot;Arrested Development&quot; was revived for a fourth season in 2012 by Netflix, with Cera reprising his role as George Michael Bluth. Cera also worked in the writers&#x27; room and served as a consulting producer during its production. The season was released in May 2013.

Cera collaborated with Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Silva on two films in 2013 – &quot;Magic Magic&quot; and &quot;Crystal Fairy &amp; the Magical Cactus&quot; – both of which were filmed in Chile and premiered at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. He spent &quot;five hours a day learning Spanish&quot; for &quot;Magic Magic&quot;. Cera was featured most prominently in &quot;Crystal Fairy&quot;, in which he starred as a self-absorbed man travelling Chile with a woman named &quot;Crystal Fairy&quot; (played by Gaby Hoffmann) while bearing a cactus. Along with Reggie Watts, Tim &amp; Eric, and Sarah Silverman, Cera created the web-based comedy YouTube channel Jash in March 2013, where he has posted short films which he directs and/or stars in. These films include the comedy-drama &quot;Gregory Go Boom&quot; (2013), in which Cera played a paraplegic man, and his directorial debut &quot;Brazzaville Teen-Ager&quot; (2013), co-starring Charles Grodin as his sick father. He played an exaggerated version of himself in the apocalyptic comedy film &quot;This Is the End&quot;, which was released in summer of 2013 and featured his &quot;Superbad&quot; co-stars Jonah Hill and Seth Rogen. Throughout 2013, Cera also appeared on &quot;Burning Love&quot;, a web spoof of reality dating competition shows, and on an episode of &quot;Drunk History&quot; as John Endecott. Cera had previously played Alexander Hamilton in a comedic retelling of Hamilton&#x27;s duel with Aaron Burr on the show&#x27;s first episode as a web series in 2008 before it was adapted into a television show.

===2014–present===
Cera appeared with his &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star David Cross&#x27; 2014 film &quot;Hits&quot;, playing a marijuana dealer. He also co-starred alongside John Hawkes and Sally Hawkins in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s television pilot &quot;How &amp; Why&quot;, which was rejected by FX. After a brief, &quot;menacing&quot; appearance in the drama &quot;Entertainment&quot; (2015), Cera appeared in the prequel to the 2001 comedy film &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;, the comedy series &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot; and in the Christmas musical comedy film &quot;A Very Murray Christmas&quot; as Bill Murray&#x27;s fictional talent agent. Cera then voiced a hot dog trying to escape his fate in a supermarket in the animated comedy &quot;Sausage Party&quot; (2016). In 2015, Cera made a cameo on Louis C.K.&#x27;s &quot;Louie&quot; on FX, in the season five episode &quot;Sleepover&quot; alongside Glenn Close, John Lithgow, and Matthew Broderick.

Cera had five film releases in 2017, the first of which was the animated superhero comedy &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, in which he voiced the Batman&#x27;s sidekick Robin. He played a supporting role as a sleazy car salesman in the comedy &quot;How to Be a Latin Lover&quot; and co-starred in Janicza Bravo&#x27;s first full-length feature, the comedy-drama &quot;Lemon&quot;. He played an actor described as having a &quot;wedge of hair that makes him look like Frédéric Chopin crossed with &quot;Eraserhead&quot;&quot;, by &quot;Variety&quot; critic Owen Gleiberman. Cera starred opposite Abbi Jacobson in the drama &quot;Person to Person&quot;, focusing on the struggles of different people over the course of one day in New York City. Cera and Jacobson are featured as a pair of crime reporters investigating a possible murder. In his final film of the year, Aaron Sorkin&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Molly&#x27;s Game&quot;, Cera played a celebrity known only as Player X who participates in a high-stakes, underground poker empire run by Molly Bloom (played by Jessica Chastain). Cera&#x27;s fictional character in the film was said to be a composite character of celebrity poker players and actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire and Ben Affleck.

A &quot;giant fan&quot; of director David Lynch, Cera made a guest appearance in the 2017 revival of Lynch and Mark Frost&#x27;s television show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; in the show&#x27;s fourth episode, as Wally &quot;Brando&quot; Brennan, the son of Deputy Sheriff Andy Brennan and his wife Lucy Brennan. The appearance contained several references to the work of actor Marlon Brando: Wally shares the same birthday and is nicknamed after Brando. Cera returned to the stage in March 2018, starring in a second Kenneth Lonergan production, &quot;Lobby Hero&quot;, at the Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway. The play also stars Chris Evans, Brian Tyree Henry and Bel Powley. Cera and Henry were both nominated for Best Featured Actor in a Play at the 72nd Tony Awards. Cera return to Broadway in October 2018, starring in a third Kenneth Lonergan production, a revival of &quot;The Waverly Gallery&quot; at the John Golden Theatre on Broadway. Cera took a supporting role as a painter acting alongside Elaine May, Lucas Hedges, and Joan Allen.

Cera co-starred in the 2018 film drama &quot;Gloria Bell&quot;, with Julianne Moore as the title character. Cera returned to his role as George Michael Bluth in the fifth season of &quot;Arrested Development&quot; in 2018. In 2021, Cera lent his voice to the adult animated film &quot;Cryptozoo&quot;. Cera appeared in the 2022 animated comedy &quot;Paws of Fury: The Legend of Hank&quot; about a dog who wishes to become a samurai. In 2023, he starred opposite Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling in the fantasy comedy film &quot;Barbie&quot; as Allan. In August 2023, he said in an interview he was working on getting financing to direct his first movie, naming an adaptation of &quot;Masters of Atlantis&quot; by Charles Portis as one of two possible directorial debuts, having narrowly beaten out Clark Duke when first securing the adaptation rights.

===Music===

In 2010, Cera contributed mandolin and backing vocals to the Weezer song &quot;Hang On&quot; from their album &quot;Hurley&quot;. Cera has also established himself as the touring bass player in Mister Heavenly, an indie rock band originating in the American northwest, and is a member of the band The Long Goodbye, along with Clark Duke. Cera also played bass and sang back up during songs in both &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; and &quot;Nick and Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot;. He released his full-length debut album &quot;True That&quot; on August 8, 2014, through his official Bandcamp page. The album features 19 original tracks, a cover of Roderick Falconer&#x27;s &quot;Play It Again&quot; as well as a cover of Blaze Foley&#x27;s &quot;Clay Pigeons.&quot;

In early 2015, Canadian musician Alden Penner released &quot;Meditate&quot;, a track from his upcoming EP &quot;Canada in Space&quot;, which features Cera. Penner subsequently announced that the EP would be released on June 29, 2015, on City Slang records, as well as a European tour of the UK, Netherlands, France, and Germany, which featured Cera as both co-headliner and member of Penner&#x27;s backing band. The song &quot;Best I Can&quot; from the film &quot;Dina&quot;, written and performed by Cera and featuring Sharon Van Etten, was nominated for &#x27;Best Song in a Documentary&#x27; at the 2017 Critics&#x27; Choice Documentary Awards.

==Personal life==
Cera has been very private about his personal life. In 2016, Aubrey Plaza made public that the pair had dated for about 18 months after filming &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&quot; in 2010 and considered getting married. The two remain friends.

In March 2022, Amy Schumer accidentally revealed that Cera was a father. Later that month, he revealed to &quot;Extra&quot; that the baby was a six-month-old boy with his German wife Nadine. In a February 2024 appearance on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot;, Cera announced that he and his wife had welcomed a second son.

As of August 2023, Cera resides in Brooklyn, New York City.

<text>Edward Dutton Cook (30 January 182911 September 1883) was a British dramatic critic and author.

==Life==
Cook&#x27;s father was George Simon Cook of Grantham, Lincolnshire, a solicitor, of the firm of Le Blanc &amp; Cook, 18 New Bridge Street, Blackfriars, London, who died on 12 September 1852, leaving a family of nine children.

Edward Dutton, the second son, was born at 9 Grenville Street, Brunswick Square, London, on 30 January 1829. At the age of six he went to a school kept by a Miss Boswell at Haverstock Hill, was removed to another school at Bradmore House, Chiswick, and finally, about 1843, entered King&#x27;s College School. Having completed his education, he was articled to his father, and remained in his office about four years, when he obtained a situation in the Madras Railway Company&#x27;s office in New Broad Street, city of London, and in his spare time followed his artistic and literary tastes.

As soon as he was able to do so he left the railway company and devoted himself entirely to literature as a profession. Having studied painting under Rolt, and learned engraving, he at one time sought employment on &quot;Punch&quot; as a draughtsman on wood. In 1859 he became a member of the Artists&#x27; Rifles, and also a member of the Ramblers&#x27; Club, which met every night from November to May at Dick&#x27;s Tavern, 8 Fleet Street. About this period, in conjunction with Mr. Leopold Lewis, he wrote a melodrama entitled &quot;The Dove and the Serpent,&quot; which was produced with much success, under Mr. Nelson Lee&#x27;s management, at the City of London Theatre.
From 1867 to October 1875 he was dramatic critic to the &quot;Pall Mall Gazette,&quot; and from that date to his death to the &quot;World&quot; newspaper. He was the writer of numerous articles on art topics in various reviews, newspapers, and periodicals, and the author of many works of fiction. Of the latter, &quot;Paul Foster&#x27;s Daughter,&quot; his first work, served to establish his reputation, and the production of &quot;The Trials of the Tredgolds&quot; in the following year (1862) in &quot;Temple Bar&quot; was a great literary success. His later novels did not maintain the popularity which his earlier works achieved. This was from no lack of merit, but because he was not sufficiently sensational in his style to suit the spirit and fashion of the period. He was one of the contributors to the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography,&quot; and furnished the dramatic and theatrical lives in letter A to the first and second volumes.

He died suddenly of heart disease on 11 September 1883, and was buried on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery on 15 September. He lies in an unmarked plot (no.25760) on the south side of the southern path, to the right of the Booth grave.

==Family==
On 20 August 1874 he married Linda Scates (second daughter of Joseph Scates), a pupil of the Royal Academy of Music and a well-known pianist, by whom he left one daughter, named Sylvia after the heroine of her father&#x27;s first novel.

<text>Maria Viktorovna Butyrskaya (, born 28 June 1972) is a Russian retired figure skater. She is the 1999 World champion and a three-time European champion — becoming the oldest skater and the first Russian to win the World ladies&#x27; title and the oldest skater to win the European ladies&#x27; title (2002 at age 29). Butyrskaya placed fourth at the 1998 Winter Olympics and sixth at the 2002 Winter Olympics. She won the Russian national title six times.

==Personal life==
Maria Butyrskaya was born on 28 June 1972 in Moscow. Her parents divorced after the birth of her younger brother.

In summer 2006, Butyrskaya married an ice hockey player, Vadim Khomitsky. As of 2010, he plays in Russia for Khimik&#x27;s successor team Atlant Moscow Oblast. They have three children together.

==Career==

===Early career===
As a child, Butyrskaya was coached by Irina Nifontova for eight years. After she decided to retire, Butyrskaya had a couple of coaches, one of whom told her she had no talent, and then contacted Vladimir Korolov. He improved her compulsory figures but they were then dropped from competitions. After Korolov moved to Greece, Butyrskaya was coached by Viktor Kudriavtsev for several years until he told her that she was strong technically but he could not help her mentally. Her coach then became Elena Tchaikovskaia.

Butyrskaya competed for the Soviet Union until its dissolution and then began representing Russia. She first showed promise with a victory ahead of veterans Josée Chouinard and Tonya Harding at the 1992 Skate Canada International, with her free skate including five triples, and then placed 5th in her European Championship debut. At the 1993 World Championships, Butyrskaya did not advance past the qualifying round, which resulted in Russia having no entry in ladies&#x27; singles at the 1994 Olympics. In the 1993–94 season, she finished second behind Olga Markova at the Russian Nationals and 4th behind Markova at that year&#x27;s Europeans. Markova thus received Russia&#x27;s lone berth to the 1994 World Championships.

===Seasons: 1994–95 to 1997–98===
Butyrskaya regained her Russian national title in the 1994–95 season. At the 1995 European Championships, she was third after the short program but her long program dropped her to 7th, behind teammates Olga Markova (2nd) and Irina Slutskaya (5th). She again missed a berth to the World Championships.

Butyrskaya re-emerged as a contender in the 1995–96 season, winning a silver behind Michelle Kwan at the 1995 Nations Cup. She qualified for the first-ever Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final, where she finished seventh. She was one of two women to beat Kwan that year at Centennial on Ice, taking silver behind Slutskaya in front of her home fans. 

Butyrskaya won her first European medal, a bronze, at the 1996 European Championships. At the 1996 World Championships in Edmonton, she missed a triple loop late in her free skate and finished 4th, losing the bronze to Slutskaya.

The 1996–97 would see Butyrskaya maintain her status as one of the World&#x27;s top skaters, but struggle with consistency of her triple lutz, which she failed to land cleanly in any of her long programs of the season. After finishing 10th at the 1996 Skate America, she rebounded with a silver medal at the 1996 Trophée Lalique, finishing second to Kwan but ahead of rising star Tara Lipinski. Second in the short program at the Grand Prix Final, she dropped to fourth overall after missing her triple lutz in the free skate. At the 1997 European Championships, she came in fourth place; her 9th-ranked short program kept her off the podium despite placing second in the long program. At the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, she placed third in the short program but her performance in the free skate dropped her to 5th overall.

Butyrskaya won her first European title at the 1998 European Championships. Ranked fifth in the short program, she completed seven triples in the long program to dethrone two-time defending champion Irina Slutskaya. She also beat that year&#x27;s Grand Prix Final silver medalist, Tanja Szewczenko (3rd), who had beaten her twice that season. Butyrskaya was selected to represent Russia at the 1998 Winter Olympics and finished 4th in Nagano, finishing behind bronze medalist Chen Lu by a narrow margin. She went on to take her first World medal, bronze, at the 1998 World Championships. She finished behind silver medalist Slutskaya on a 5–4 split after a late fall at the end of a strong performance.

===Seasons: 1998–99 to 2001–02===
In the 1998–99 season, Butyrskaya repeated as the European champion. She took silver behind Uzbekistan&#x27;s Tatiana Malinina at that year&#x27;s Grand Prix Final after falling twice in the long program. Butyrskaya then won gold at the 1999 World Championships, finishing ahead of defending World champion Michelle Kwan. She received all first place ordinals in both the short and the long programs at the event, landing seven triples in her long program and receiving seven 5.9s for presentation. She was the first Russian woman to win Worlds.

Butyrskaya&#x27;s car exploded outside her Moscow apartment on 23 December 1999. She said, &quot;I don&#x27;t see any other reason for it than jealousy, pure human jealousy.&quot; Tchaikovskaya stated &quot;In my 40 years of coaching I have never seen anything like it. I guess it&#x27;s this crime wave that has taken over our cities and lives lately.&quot; Entering the Russian Championships as the five-time defending champion, Butyrskaya finished second to Irina Slutskaya and then placed 3rd at the Grand Prix final behind Slutskaya and Kwan. At the 2000 European Championships, Butyrskaya was fourth in the short program but came away with a silver medal after a long program containing six triples, including a triple-triple sequence. At the 2000 World Championships, she placed first in the short program, scoring ten 5.9s. In 2000, the New York Times described her short program (Sarah Brightman&#x27;s Scene d&#x27;Amour) as &quot;flowing, lyrical skating...a performance of rare elegance and beauty.&quot; She dropped to third overall after missing two triple salchows in her long program and was awarded the bronze, her third World medal. Had she placed first or even second in the long program behind Kwan, she would have successfully defended her title.

In the 2000–01 season, Butyrskaya began attempting the triple flip jump in her short programs and won both the 2000 Sparkassen Cup on Ice and 2000 Trophée Lalique. After a narrow loss to Slutskaya at the 2000 NHK Trophy, she would initially not stand on the podium and finished fourth at the Grand Prix Final, completing only five out of 14 planned triples over the three segments. Butyrskaya took bronze at the Russian Nationals and silver at the 2001 European Championships, finishing behind Slutskaya at both events. At the 2001 World Championships, her performance in the qualifying round kept her out of the final flight in the short program. Although she placed third in the free skate with six triples and three 5.9s for presentation, she finished fourth overall, narrowly edged for the bronze by Sarah Hughes.

In the 2001–02 season, Butyrskaya was the only woman to win both of her Grand Prix assignments and entered the Grand Prix Final as the top qualifier but finished fourth. She won her third European title at the 2002 European Championships, defeating Slutskaya in a major event for the first time in three years. She finished sixth at her second Olympics and ended her amateur career at the 2002 World Championships, withdrawing from the competition after skating poorly in the qualifying round.

Butyrskaya performed a combination spin that involved clasping her arms and hands behind her back while transitioning to back camel, sit and scratch spins. She often participated in choreographing her programs and in designing her costumes.

===Later career===
After retiring from competition, Butyrskaya began coaching, working primarily with young skaters. She is based at the Olympic Reserve Skating School in Moscow. She has also skated in ice shows, including Champions on Ice and Stars on Ice.

<text>A bacchanale is an orgiastic musical composition, often depicting a drunken revel or &quot;bacchanal&quot;.

Examples include the &quot;bacchanales&quot; in Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;, the Venusberg scene in Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;, &quot;Danse générale (Bacchanale)&quot; from Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot;, and &quot;Grande bacchanale des saisons&quot; in Alexander Glazunov&#x27;s &quot;The Seasons&quot;. John Cage wrote a &quot;Bacchanale&quot; in 1940, his first work for prepared piano. The French composer Jacques Ibert was commissioned by the BBC for the tenth anniversary of the Third Programme in 1956, for which he wrote a bacchanale. 

In 1939, Salvador Dalí designed the set and wrote the libretto for a ballet entitled &quot;Bacchanale&quot;, based on Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot; and the myth of Leda and the Swan.

&quot;Bacchanale&quot; (1954) was written by composer Toshiro Mayuzumi for 5 saxophones (soprano, 2 alto, tenor, baritone), timpani, percussion (4), piano, celesta, harp, and strings. The previous year, he had written a &quot;Bacchanale&quot; for orchestra.

&quot;Bacchanale&quot; is also a track composed by Greek musician Vangelis on his album &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;.

<text>Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne (; 15 February 1704 – 25 May 1778) was a French sculptor of the 18th century who worked in both the rococo and neoclassical style. He made monumental statuary for the Gardens of Versailles but was best known for his expressive portrait busts.

==Life==
Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne was born in Paris in 1704. His father Jean-Louis Lemoyne, was also a sculptor, and was first teacher. He later became a student of another prominent sculptor, Robert Le Lorrain. He is sometimes referred to as Jean-Baptiste II Lemoyne or &quot;the younger&quot; to distinguish him from his uncle of the same name, another sculptor, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne the Elder.

He received the prix de Rome awarded by the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, but remained in Paris to aid his blind father. He became a member of the Academy in 1838, and, later became its director. Like the other royal sculptors, made statuary for the Gardens of Versailles. He was a particular favorite of Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of the King and an important patron of the arts. He made a graceful rococo sculpture of Vertumnus and Pomone, two characters from the Metamorphoses of Ovid, which was a favorite theme of Madame Pompadour. The sculpture is now in the Louvre. He also made a state of Madame Pompadour in the costume of a nymph. He made several busts of Louis XV, and an equestrian statue of the King for the courtyard of the new Ecole Militaire, but this was destroyed during the French Revolution.

He was especially known for the quality of his portrait busts, which captured the passing nuances of expression and gave a sense of movement. His important portrait busts included those of the naturalist René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur (1751); the painter Noël-Nicolas Coypel (1760); the scientist Fontenelle (at Versailles); Madame de Pompadour; and Marie-Antoinette in 1771. He is considered the most skilled of the French rococo sculptors.

Lemoyne&#x27;s students included Étienne Maurice Falconet Jean-Baptiste Pigalle, and Augustin Pajou.

<text>Jessica Ann Walter (January 31, 1941 – March 24, 2021) was an American actress who appeared in more than 170 film, stage, and television productions. 

In films, she was best known for her role as a psychotic and obsessed fan of a local disc jockey in the 1971 Clint Eastwood thriller, &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;. On television, she was most recently known for her role of Lucille Bluth on the sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2006, 2013–2019) and for providing the voice of Malory Archer on the FX animated series &quot;Archer&quot; (2009–2021). Walter received various awards over the course of her television career, including a Primetime Emmy Award for &quot;Amy Prentiss&quot; (1975). She also received two Golden Globe Award nominations and three Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. For her starring role opposite Eastwood in &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot;, Walter received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama.

After studying acting at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre in New York City, Walter began her career on the Broadway stage, winning a 1963 Clarence Derwent Award for Outstanding Debut Performance. She made her film debut in the 1964 neo-noir drama &quot;Lilith&quot;, subsequently starring in the 1966 films &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and &quot;The Group&quot;. Both performances earned her critical acclaim.

Throughout her career, Walter was a regular presence on American television, playing the title role in the short-lived police procedural &quot;Amy Prentiss,&quot; appearing in a recurring role on &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, working as a series regular for the first half of season one of &quot;90210&quot;, and providing the voice of Fran Sinclair on the series &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;. Her role as scheming socialite Lucille Bluth in &quot;Arrested Development&quot; brought her renewed attention, and she contributed voiceover work to animated series such as &quot;Archer&quot; and &quot;Star vs. the Forces of Evil&quot; (2015–18).

==Early life==
Walter was born on January 31, 1941, in Brooklyn, New York, to Esther (née Groisser), a teacher, and David Walter, a musician who was a member of the NBC Symphony Orchestra and the NYC Ballet Orchestra. Both of Walter&#x27;s parents were Jewish, with her mother having immigrated to the US from the Soviet Union in 1923. Her brother, Richard, is a retired professor who led the screenwriting program at UCLA. The siblings were raised in Elmhurst, Queens. Walter attended the High School of Performing Arts in Manhattan, graduating in 1959.

==Career==
Walter began her acting career on stage, winning a Clarence Derwent Award in 1963 for Outstanding Debut Broadway Performance in &quot;Photo Finish&quot; by Peter Ustinov. She soon moved to television, and played Julie Muranoon on the television series, &quot;Love of Life&quot;. While appearing on &quot;Love of Life&quot; from 1962 to 1965, she also acted on many other popular television series, including &quot;Naked City&quot;, &quot;East Side/West Side&quot;, &quot;Ben Casey&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;The Doctors and the Nurses&quot;, &quot;The Rogues&quot;, and &quot;The Defenders&quot;. Among those series is Walter&#x27;s role as Lorna Richmond on &quot;The Ordeal of Mrs. Snow&quot; episode of &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; (April 14, 1964), and a supporting role as William Shatner&#x27;s wife on the legal drama &quot;For the People&quot; (1965).

In 1964, Walter appeared in the first episode of the television series &quot;Flipper&quot; as well as the episode &quot;How Much for a Prince?&quot; in CBS&#x27;s drama &quot;The Reporter&quot;. In 1966, she appeared in &quot;The White Knight&quot; episode of &quot;The Fugitive.&quot;

Her earliest notable and acclaimed screen role was in the Clint Eastwood-directed film, &quot;Play Misty for Me&quot; (1971). Walter played Evelyn, a young woman who becomes violently obsessed with a disc jockey. Evelyn is known to repeatedly call a California radio station during a jazz music program hosted by Eastwood&#x27;s character, Dave Garver, always requesting he play the Erroll Garner standard, &quot;Misty&quot;. In the course of becoming infatuated with Garver, Evelyn seduces him and then attempts suicide in his home. Her obsessive behavior intensifies and she begins stalking him relentlessly and eventually breaks into his house. In a frenzy, Evelyn destroys the interior of the home and stabs his housekeeper Birdie (played by Clarice Taylor), who is hospitalized but survives. For her performance, Walter received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actress in a Motion Picture – Drama category as well as critical praise. Film critic Roger Ebert described Walter as demonstrating &quot;unnerving effectiveness&quot; in the role. 

Walter&#x27;s other film credits from that era include &quot;Lilith&quot; (1964), &quot;Grand Prix&quot; (1966), &quot;The Group&quot; (1966), &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot; (1968), and &quot;Number One&quot; (1969). She was also in three episodes of &quot;Mannix&quot; (starring Mike Connors) in three separate seasons.

During the 1970s, Walter co-starred in an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Mind Over Mayhem&quot;, had a recurring role on &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot; as Melanie McIntyre, Trapper John&#x27;s former wife, and starred on the series &quot;Amy Prentiss&quot;, a spinoff of &quot;Ironside&quot;, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award. 

In 1980s, she had a role on the NBC primetime soap opera &quot;Bare Essence&quot; as Ava Marshall. Following &quot;Bare Essence&quot;, Walter worked most frequently in television and theater, though she did appear in some films including &quot;The Flamingo Kid&quot; (1984) and &quot;PCU&quot; (1994). She recorded a performance as the doll form of Chucky for the 1988 horror film &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;, but her lines were redubbed by Brad Dourif after negative test screenings which Tom Holland and Don Mancini attributed partially to Walter&#x27;s performance; they claimed Walter was effectively frightening in the role but failed to convey the sense of black humor they envisioned the character to have and that her voice seemed out of place because the character was male.

In the 1990s, Walter voiced Fran Sinclair on the ABC comedy &quot;Dinosaurs&quot;, and appeared on &quot;Just Shoot Me!&quot; as Eve Gallo, the mother of Maya and the ex-wife of magazine publisher Jack Gallo.

From 2003 to 2006, she appeared in a regular role as the scheming alcoholic socialite matriarch Lucille Bluth on Fox&#x27;s comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. In 2005, she received a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for the role. Despite her convincing portrayal of Lucille, she stated: &quot;I&#x27;m nothing like Lucille. Nothing. My daughter will tell you. I&#x27;m really a very nice, boring person.&quot; Despite acclaim from critics, &quot;Arrested Development&quot; received low ratings and viewership on Fox, which cancelled the series in 2006. It was revived by Netflix for season four in 2013, where it gained huge popularity. Walter reprised her role for season five, premiering in 2018.

Walter played Tabitha Wilson on the first season of &quot;90210&quot; (2008-2009), until the character was written off halfway through the season. In 2007, she guest-starred on the sitcom &quot;Rules of Engagement&quot; in the episode titled &quot;Kids&quot; and in 2009 guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; as legal-aid lawyer Petra Gilmartin. Previously in 2008, she had appeared in &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; as Eleanor Reynolds in the episode &quot;Please Note We Are No Longer Accepting Letters of Recommendation from Henry Kissinger&quot;. From 2011 to 2012, she starred in the TV Land sitcom &quot;Retired at 35&quot; alongside her &quot;Bye Bye Braverman&quot; co-star George Segal.

Walter starred as Evangeline Harcourt in the Broadway revival of &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, which began previews in March 2011 and officially opened on April 7, 2011.

Walter voiced spymaster Malory Archer on the FX animated series &quot;Archer&quot;. Walter mentioned that her performance in &quot;Arrested Development&quot; was explicitly referenced when auditions for the part of Malory were sought.

In May 2018, Walter became part of an on-set controversy regarding harassment she said she had received from &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Jeffrey Tambor. During a cast interview with the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Walter was asked about an incident which Tambor had alluded to several months before. Walter teared up and stated that &quot;[i]n like almost 60 years of working, I&#x27;ve never had anybody yell at me like that on a set. And it&#x27;s hard to deal with, but I&#x27;m over it now&quot;, while also noting that Tambor had apologized and had not done anything sexually inappropriate, and that she would work with him again. During the same interview, co-stars Jason Bateman, Tony Hale, and David Cross were criticized in multiple media outlets for appearing to excuse Tambor&#x27;s behavior without acknowledging Walter&#x27;s experience. Within days, all three men had issued apologies to Walter.

==Personal life==
On March 27, 1966, Walter married Ross Bowman, a Broadway stage manager and television director from Portland, Oregon. The marriage produced a daughter, Brooke (born May 18, 1972), once an executive for 21st Century Fox and later a Senior Vice President of development at ABC Family. Walter filed for divorce from Bowman in November 1976, and the divorce became final in 1978. Their grandson Micah was born on July 7, 2013, to Brooke and her husband, David Heymann.

During her first marriage, a fire broke out in the couple&#x27;s tenth-floor apartment on September 28, 1966, while Bowman was out of town. Walter was rescued by a firefighter. 

On June 26, 1983, Walter married actor Ron Leibman. They remained married until his death on December 6, 2019. Walter and Leibman appeared together in Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Rumors&quot;, and portrayed a husband and wife in the film &quot;Dummy&quot; (2003), and on &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; (in the episode &quot;House Counsel&quot;). Leibman joined the cast of &quot;Archer&quot;, voicing her character&#x27;s new husband. 

While Walter&#x27;s mother raised her in the Jewish tradition, Walter later described herself as not religious but &quot;very Jewish in my heart&quot;.

On March 24, 2021, Walter died in her sleep at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.

<text>&quot;The Mother of All Demos&quot; was a landmark computer demonstration, named retroactively, of developments by Stanford Research Institute&#x27;s Augmentation Research Center. It was presented at the Association for Computing Machinery / Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (ACM/IEEE)—Computer Society&#x27;s Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco, by Douglas Engelbart, on December 9, 1968.

The 90-minute live demonstration featured the introduction of a complete computer hardware and software system called the oN-Line System or, more commonly, NLS, which demonstrated for the first time many of the fundamental elements of modern personal computing, including windows, hypertext, graphics, efficient navigation and command input, video conferencing, the computer mouse, word processing, dynamic file linking, revision control, and a collaborative real-time editor.

Engelbart&#x27;s presentation was the first to publicly demonstrate all of these elements in a single system. The demonstration was highly influential and spawned similar projects at Xerox PARC in the early 1970s. The underlying concepts and technologies influenced both the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows graphical user interface operating systems in the 1980s and 1990s.

==Background==
Much of Engelbart&#x27;s thought that led to the development of his Augmentation Research Center (ARC), as well as the oN-Line System, was derived from the &quot;research culture&quot; of World War II and the early Cold War. A notable source of inspiration to Engelbart was the article &quot;As We May Think&quot;, written by Vannevar Bush in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; magazine, which Engelbart read while stationed as a United States Navy radar technician in the Philippines in 1946. In Engelbart&#x27;s view, in order to steer society into the right use of scientific knowledge derived from the war, that knowledge would need to be better managed and regulated.

In his book &quot;From Counterculture to Cyberculture&quot;, Fred Turner gave voice to this view, which arose from seeing the unintended effects of technology on the postwar world:
[T]he American military had developed technologies with which it might destroy the world. In its wake, scientists and technologists had begun to fan out around the globe, seeking to use their knowledge to eradicate disease and increase food production, often in an effort to win the cold war loyalties of Third World nations. Engelbart had read about these efforts and saw that they often backfired. Rapid food production led to the depletion of the soil; the eradication of insects led to ecological imbalances.

This ultimately led to the idea that beyond merely performing calculations, computers could be used to augment the capabilities of the human mind.

==Demonstration==

Engelbart had assembled a team of computer engineers and programmers at his Augmentation Research Center (ARC) located in Stanford University&#x27;s Stanford Research Institute (SRI) in the early 1960s. His idea was to free computing from merely being about number crunching and for it to become a tool for communications and information-retrieval. He wanted to turn Vannevar Bush&#x27;s idea for a Memex machine into reality, where a machine used interactively by one person could &quot;augment&quot; their intelligence.

Over the course of six years, with the funding help of both NASA and ARPA, his team went about putting together all the elements that would make such a computer system a reality. At the urging of ARPA&#x27;s director, Robert Taylor, the NLS would make its first public appearance at the 1968 Fall Joint Computer Conference in San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Auditorium.

The conference session was presented under the title &quot;A research center for augmenting human intellect&quot;. Approximately 1,000 computer professionals were in attendance in the auditorium to witness the presentation. Notable attendees in the audience included Alan Kay, Charles Irby and Andy van Dam, as well as Bob Sproull.

Engelbart, with the help of his geographically distributed team (including Bill Paxton), with Bill English directing the presentation&#x27;s technical elements, demonstrated NLS&#x27;s functions. The presentation used an Eidophor video projector that allowed the video output from the NLS computer to be displayed on a large high screen so the audience could see what Engelbart was doing.

The Augment researchers also created two customized homemade modems at 1200 baudhigh-speed for 1968linked via a leased line to transfer data from the computer workstation keyboard and mouse at the Civic Auditorium to their Menlo Park headquarters&#x27; SDS-940 computer.

In order to provide live two-way video between the lab and the conference hall, two microwave links were used. English also commanded a video switcher that controlled what was displayed on the big screen. The camera operator in Menlo Park was Stewart Brand, who at the time was a non-computer person, best known as the editor of the &quot;Whole Earth Catalog&quot;. Stewart Brand advised Engelbart and the team about how to present the demo. Engelbart got to know Stewart Brand when they experimented with LSD at the same lab.

During the 90-minute presentation, Engelbart used his mouse prototype to move around the screen, highlight text, and resize windows. This was the first time that an integrated system for manipulating text onscreen was presented publicly.

At separate times, his Augment associates Jeff Rulifson and Bill Paxton appeared in another portion of the screen to help edit the text remotely from ARC. While they were editing they could see each other&#x27;s screen, talk and see each other as well. He further demonstrated that clicking on underlined text would then link to another page of information, demonstrating the concept of hypertext.

When he finished the demonstration, the audience gave him a standing ovation. To further demonstrate the system, a separate room was set aside so that attendees could take a closer look at the NLS workstations and ask Engelbart questions. One last notion is that of Engelbart&#x27;s NLS system. As Fred Turner stated in his book &quot;From Counterculture to Cyberculture&quot;:
Engelbart promulgated a philosophy of &#x27;bootstrapping&#x27;, in which each experimental transformation of the socio-technical system that was the NLS would feed back into the system itself, causing it to evolve (and presumably to improve).

==Influence==

Prior to the demonstration, a significant portion of the computer science community thought Engelbart was &quot;a crackpot&quot;. When he was finished, he was described as &quot;dealing lightning with both hands&quot;. Van Dam was working on a similar system, but had only begun work on it in 1967, and was stunned to see how mature NLS was: he practically accosted Engelbart with his line of questioning in the post-presentation question and answer session. After he finished interrogating Engelbart, van Dam agreed the NLS demo was the greatest thing he ever witnessed. Van Dam would go on to become a leader in teaching computer graphics in the 1970s. The actual impact on computer science, however, was limited:

As the 1970s started, much of Engelbart&#x27;s team departed ARC and went their own ways, with many of them ending up at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Among these people were Bill English, who would further improve upon the mouse. Also migrating to PARC was Engelbart&#x27;s former backer at NASA and ARPA, Robert Taylor. Alan Kay, also in attendance at the demo, would go on to design an object-oriented computing environment called Smalltalk while he was at PARC.

By 1973, the Xerox Alto was a fully functional personal computer similar to the NLS terminal which Engelbart had demonstrated in 1968, but much smaller and physically refined. With its mouse-driven GUI, the Alto would go on to influence Steve Jobs and Apple&#x27;s Macintosh computer and operating system in the 1980s. Eventually, Microsoft&#x27;s Windows operating system would follow the Macintosh and use a multi-button mouse in the same way that the Alto and the NLS system did.

Engelbart&#x27;s influence peaked at the conference, and he was mostly remembered throughout the 1970s and much of the 1980s as the inventor of the mouse and hypertext, famously adapted by Apple and Microsoft. On the demo&#x27;s 30th anniversary in 1998, Stanford University held a major conference to celebrate Engelbart&#x27;s visionary impact on computing and the World Wide Web. By the time the 40th anniversary was celebrated, Engelbart&#x27;s demo was acknowledged as one of the most important in computer history.

In 2015, a performance art musical presentation called &quot;The Demo&quot; depicted the event. It was composed and performed by Mikel Rouse and Ben Neill, with its premiere at Stanford&#x27;s Bing Concert Hall.

<text>A breed show is a broad term for exhibitions designed to showcase a single animal breed. In most cases, only purebred animals recorded with a breed registry are eligible to enter and compete. A judge or team of judges will evaluate individual animals both in terms of the correct conformation for the species and the specific phenotypical characteristics of the given animal&#x27;s breed. Breed shows are held for many domesticated animals, including companion animals such as cats and dogs, but also for livestock such as cattle, sheep and horses.

In some cases, shows for many different breeds of animals may be combined in a single event, as in a dog show, were different classes exist for each breed, or, particularly in the case of livestock shows, competition or multiple species of animals may be combined into a single event, such as a county fair, thus allowing organizers to combine fixed costs for common areas such as barns, show rings and the like. 

In the case of horses, horse shows limited to a specific breed are very common, and generally include not only the conformation judging common to all animals, but also add performance classes where the animals are either ridden or shown in harness to display their training and underlying athletic ability, manners and temperament. The types of events offered vary from breed to breed, depending on the form and function for which the breed developed.

Judges for breed shows are usually certified by a recognized organization, sometimes for the adjudication of only one breed, but in some cases, judges may be qualified to evaluate multiple breeds of the same animal. In any case, judges need to have a vast amount of knowledge and experience and retain objectivity in spite of any personal preference.

<text>The music of Wyoming includes a number of well-regarded music festivals, as well as a heritage that includes Native American, European, and American music.

== Music history ==

The first music in Wyoming was played by various Native American tribes in the present-day U.S. state of Wyoming. European settlers later arrived, bringing with them harmonicas, flutes, fiddles, and guitars because these were relatively lightweight and easy to carry on the frontier. The military played a major role in the historical development of the music of Wyoming. Virtually all posts had a band, and many soldiers learned to play the bugle and served in the drum and bugle corps. Military music was often the most prominent source of entertainment in many parts of early colonial Wyoming.

Outsider musician Moondog lived in Wyoming as a child.

Pop punk band The Lillingtons were formed in Newcastle in 1995.

Rapper Kanye West&#x27;s 2018 album &quot;Ye&quot; was recorded on his ranch in Jackson Hole, Wyoming and has a picture of the Teton Range on the cover.

==Notable Wyoming musicians==
*Spencer Bohren – critically acclaimed American Folk and Blues artist.
*Chris Ledoux – (d. 2005 in Casper) country music singer-songwriter, bronze sculptor, and rodeo champion. He attended Casper College. He performed at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Arena in &#x27;97 and &#x27;99.
*Todd Sampson – Singer and songwriter behind &#x27;Mountain Apple Epidemic&#x27;
*Chancey Williams – country music singer-songwriter and former saddle bronc rider.

== Music institutions ==
Music institutions in Wyoming include the Wyoming Symphony Orchestra and the Cheyenne Symphony Orchestra.

== Music festivals ==
Music festivals in Wyoming include the Cheyenne Frontier Days celebration, which dates back to 1896 and draws 300,000 people to Cheyenne at the end of July. The festival features various crafts, dances and food, as well as major country concerts every night. The Cheyenne Frontier Days Arena has hosted concerts since Johnny Cash in &#x27;77. Shoshoni is home to the Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest, while nearby Riverton hosts the Cowboy Poetry Round-up every October. The town of Cody is well known for the Buffalo Bill Historical Center, which features various music events throughout the year, while Jackson also hosts many music events during the year, especially Old West Days and the Cowboy Ski Challenge. The nearby Grand Targhee Resort in Alta is home to the annual Targhee Fest in mid-July, and their famous Bluegrass Music Festival in August. Jackson Hole is also home to the Grand Teton Music Festival, one of the largest festivals in the state.

<text>Lilli Lehmann (born Elisabeth Maria Lehmann, later Elisabeth Maria Lehmann-Kalisch; 24 November 1848 – 17 May 1929) was a German operatic dramatic coloratura soprano. She was also a voice teacher and animal welfare advocate.

==Biography==

The future opera star&#x27;s father, Karl-August Lehmann, was a singer (Heldentenor) while her mother, Maria Theresia Löw (1809–1885), was a soprano. Her younger sister, Marie, also went on to become an operatic soprano. Her first lessons were from her mother, who had been a prima donna under Spohr at the Cassel opera. After singing small parts on the stage, for example in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Magic Flute&quot; at Prague in 1866, and studies under Heinrich Laube in Leipzig, Lehmann made her proper debut in 1870 in Berlin as a light soprano in Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Das Feldlager in Schlesien&quot;. She subsequently became so successful that she was appointed an Imperial Chamber Singer for life in 1876.

Lehmann sang in the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876, singing in the first complete performances of The Ring Cycle as Woglinde and Helmwige. She performed in London in 1884, and appeared at the New York Metropolitan Opera in 1885–1899. Together with her Met colleagues Fischer, Alvary, Brandt, and Seidl, she helped to popularise Wagner&#x27;s music in America. By remaining in America beyond the leave granted her by the Berlin Opera, she faced a ban following her return to Germany. After the personal intervention of the Emperor, the ban was lifted.

She appeared at London&#x27;s Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1899 and sang in Paris and Vienna in 1903 and 1909 respectively. In 1905, she sang at the Salzburg Festival, later becoming the festival&#x27;s artistic director. Lehmann was also renowned as a Lieder singer. She continued to give recitals until her retirement from the concert stage in the 1920s.

Her mature voice, of splendid quality and large volume, gained for her the reputation of being not only one of the greatest Wagnerian singers of her day but also an ideal interpreter of Bellini&#x27;s Norma and the operatic music of Mozart. She was considered unsurpassed in the roles of Brünnhilde and Isolde but sang an astonishingly wide array of other parts. Indeed, across the span of her career, she performed 170 different parts in a total of 119 German, Italian and French operas. She was noted not only for her rendering of the musical score, but also as a tragic actress. 

She was also a noted voice teacher. Among her pupils were the famous sopranos Geraldine Farrar, Viorica Ursuleac, Edytha Fleischer, Olive Fremstad; the mezzo-sopranos Lula Mysz-Gmeiner and Marion Telva; tenor Walter Kirchhoff; and the contralto and composer Florence Wickham. Longtime Juilliard School professor of voice Lucia Dunham, who trained many other famous singers, was also one of her pupils.

Lehmann founded the International Summer Academy at the Mozarteum in Salzburg in 1916. The academy&#x27;s curriculum concentrated on voice lessons at first but it was extended later to include a wide variety of musical instruction.

The Lilli Lehmann Medal is awarded by the Mozarteum in her honour. Her voice can be heard on CD reissues of the recordings which she made prior to World War I. Although past her peak as an operatic singer when she made these records, they still impress.

==Personal life==
She married the tenor Paul Kalisch in New York on 24 February 1888. Lehmann became a vegetarian in 1896. She stated that it improved her career and health and she no longer suffered from fatigue or headaches. Her diet consisted of fruit, rice, milk, eggs, cheese, vegetables and rye bread, although she admitted she ate fish twice a year. Rupert Christiansen has described Lehmann as a &quot;fanatic vegetarian and anti-vivisectionist, and nothing pleased her more in New York than the fact that the whipping of horses was forbidden.&quot; She also campaigned against the use of feathers from exotic birds in women&#x27;s hats and costume, and after her operatic performances, she would offer her autograph to women who promised not to wear feathers in their hats.

<text>Ron Leibman (; October 11, 1937 – December 6, 2019) was an American actor. He won both the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play in 1993 for his performance as Roy Cohn in &quot;Angels in America&quot;. Leibman also won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1979 for his role as Martin &#x27;Kaz&#x27; Kazinsky in his short-lived crime drama series &quot;Kaz&quot;.

Leibman appeared in films such as &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970), &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972), &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979), and &quot;Zorro, The Gay Blade&quot; (1982). Later in his career, he became widely known for his recurring role as Dr. Leonard Green on &quot;Friends&quot; (1996–2004), and for providing the voice of Ron Cadillac on &quot;Archer&quot; (2013–2016).

==Early life==
Leibman was born October 11, 1937, in Manhattan to Grace (née Marks), who was of Russian-Jewish descent, and Murray Leibman, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who worked in the garment business. Leibman graduated from Ohio Wesleyan University.

==Career==
Leibman was a member of the Compass Players in the late 1950s, and was admitted to the Actors Studio shortly thereafter.

Leibman made his film debut alongside George Segal in the dark comedy &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; (1970). He then starred alongside Robert Redford and Segal in the heist film &quot;The Hot Rock&quot; (1972) and he was featured as a northern Jewish union organizer in the award-winning film &quot;Norma Rae&quot; (1979). In 1980, he starred in &quot;Up The Academy&quot;, a &quot;gross-out&quot; comedy set at a reform school and produced by MAD Magazine. (Reaction to the film was so poor that it was repudiated by both MAD and Leibman himself, who had his name expunged from the credits and promotional material.) 

His other film appearances include &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972), &quot;Your Three Minutes Are Up&quot; (1973) with Beau Bridges and Janet Margolin, &quot;Zorro, The Gay Blade&quot; (1981), &quot;Auto Focus&quot; (2002) and &quot;Garden State&quot; (2004). A TV movie role of Leibman&#x27;s was the 1988 legal thriller &quot;Terrorist On Trial&quot; where he plays a Jewish lawyer who defends an Arab defendant accused of a terrorist attack in Spain and extracted to Virginia. Leibman costars in that with Robert Davi as the defendant, and Sam Waterston as the prosecuting attorney. It may be found as &quot;In The Hands Of The Enemy.&quot;

Leibman won an Emmy Award, Outstanding Lead Actor In A Drama Series, in 1979 for his convict-turned-lawyer character in &quot;Kaz&quot; (1978–79), a series which he also created and co-wrote. He was later nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actor for the role of Morris Huffner in &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;. 

He co-starred with his second wife, Jessica Walter, in &quot;Tartuffe&quot; at the Los Angeles Theatre Center in 1986, and they co-starred again in Neil Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Rumors&quot; in 1988 on Broadway. They also appeared together as husband and wife in the film &quot;Dummy&quot; (2003) and in the TV series &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; in the episode &quot;House Counsel&quot; in 1995.

Leibman received a 1993 Tony Award for his performance as Roy Cohn in the Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Angels in America&quot;.

He played Dr. Leonard Green, Rachel Green&#x27;s overbearing father, on the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot;. He had a recurring role on &quot;The Sopranos&quot; as Dr. Plepler. In 1983, Leibman starred in the Australian film &quot;Phar Lap&quot; as David J. Davis, the owner of legendary New Zealand/Australian racehorse Phar Lap, which won the 1930 Melbourne Cup and the 1932 Agua Caliente Handicap.

In 2013, Leibman began appearing as a recurring character on the TV series &quot;Archer&quot; as Ron Cadillac, the husband to Malory Archer, voiced by his real-life wife Jessica Walter.

==Personal life==
Leibman was married twice. His first wife was actress Linda Lavin, to whom he was married from 1969 to 1981. In 1983, he married actress Jessica Walter. They remained married until his death in 2019.

==Death==
Leibman died from complications of pneumonia in Manhattan on December 6, 2019, at age 82.

<doc id="921503" wikidata="Q541859" url="?curid=921503" title="Jules Bastien-Lepage">
<text>Jules Bastien-Lepage (1 November 1848 – 10 December 1884) was a French painter closely associated with the beginning of naturalism, an artistic style that grew out of the Realist movement and paved the way for the development of impressionism. Émile Zola described Bastien-Lepage&#x27;s work as &quot;impressionism corrected, sweetened and adapted to the taste of the crowd.&quot;

His &quot;en plein air&quot; depictions of peasant life in the countryside were highly influential on many international artists, including George Clausen in England and Tom Roberts in Australia. He also won renown for his history paintings, among the most famous being &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, now held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York.

==Life and work==
Bastien-Lepage was born in the village of Damvillers, Meuse, and spent his childhood there. Bastien&#x27;s father grew grapes in a vineyard to support the family. His grandfather also lived in the village; his garden had espaliered fruit trees of apple, pear, and peach up against the high walls. Bastien took an early liking to drawing, and his parents fostered his creativity by buying prints of paintings for him to copy.

===Education===

Jules Bastien-Lepage&#x27;s first teacher was his father, himself an artist. His first formal training was at Verdun. Prompted by a love of art, he went to Paris in 1867, where he was admitted to the École des Beaux-arts, working under Alexandre Cabanel. He was awarded first place for drawing, but spent most of his time working alone, only occasionally appearing in class. Nevertheless, he completed three years at the &quot;école&quot;. In a letter to his parents, he complained that the life model was a man in the pose of a mediaeval lutanist. During the Franco-Prussian war in 1870, Bastien fought and was wounded. After the war, he returned home to paint the villagers and recover from his wound. In 1873 he painted his grandfather in the garden, a work that would bring the artist his first success at the Paris Salon.

===Early work===
After exhibiting works in the Salons of 1870 and 1872, which attracted no attention, in 1874 his &quot;Portrait of my Grandfather&quot; garnered critical acclaim and received a third-class medal. He also showed &quot;Song of Spring&quot;, an academically oriented study of rural life, representing a peasant girl sitting on a knoll above a village, surrounded by wood nymphs.

His initial success was confirmed in 1875 by the &quot;First Communion&quot;, a picture of a little girl minutely worked up in manner that was compared to Hans Holbein, and a &quot;Portrait of M. Hayern&quot;. In 1875, he took second place in the competition for the &quot;Prix de Rome&quot; with his &quot;Angels appearing to the Shepherds&quot;, exhibited again at the &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; in 1878. His next attempt to win the Prix de Rome in 1876 with &quot;Priam at the Feet of Achilles&quot; was again unsuccessful (it is in the Lille gallery), and the painter determined to return to country life. To the Salon of 1877 he sent a full-length &quot;Portrait of Lady L.&quot; and &quot;My Parents&quot;; and in 1878 a &quot;Portrait of M. Theuriet&quot; and &quot;Haymaking (Les Foins)&quot;. The last picture, now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay, was widely praised by critics and the public alike. It secured his status as one of the first painters in the Naturalist school.
===Naturalism and acclaim===
After the success of &quot;Haymaking&quot;, Bastien-Lepage was recognized in France as the leader of the emerging Naturalist school. By 1883, a critic could proclaim that &quot;The whole world paints so much today like M. Bastien-Lepage that M. Bastien-Lepage seems to paint like the whole world.&quot; This fame brought him prominent commissions.

His &quot;Portrait of Sarah Bernhardt&quot; (1879), painted in a light key, won him the cross of the Legion of Honour. In 1879 he was commissioned to do a portrait of the Prince of Wales. In 1880 he exhibited a small depiction of M. Andrieux and an historical painting of &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art); and in the same year, at the Royal Academy, the small portrait of the Prince of Wales. In 1881 he painted &quot;The Beggar&quot; and the &quot;Portrait of Albert Wolf&quot;; in 1882 &quot;Le Père Jacques&quot;; in 1885 &quot;Village Love&quot;, in which we find some trace of Gustave Courbet&#x27;s influence. His last dated work is &quot;The Forge&quot; (1884).

===Death and legacy===

Between 1880 and 1883 he traveled in Italy. The artist, long ailing, had tried in vain to re-establish his health in Algiers. He died in Paris in 1884, when planning a new series of rural subjects. His friend, Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, was with him at the end and wrote:

At last he was unable to work anymore; and he died on the 10th of December, 1884, breathing his last in my arms. At his grave&#x27;s head his mother and brother planted an apple-tree.

In March and April 1885, more than 200 of his pictures were exhibited at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In 1889 some of his best-known work was shown at the Paris Exposition Universelle.

Among his more important works, may also be mentioned the portrait of Mme J. Drouet (1883); Gambetta on his death-bed, and some landscapes; &quot;The Vintage&quot; (1880), and &quot;The Thames at London&quot; (1882). &quot;The Little Chimney-Sweep&quot; was never finished. A museum is devoted to him at Montmédy. A statue of Bastien-Lepage by Rodin was erected in Damvillers. An obituary by Prince Bojidar Karageorgevitch, appeared in the &quot;Magazine of Art&quot; (Cassell) in 1890.

===Impact on the reception of Impressionism===
The influential English critic Roger Fry credited the wider public&#x27;s acceptance of the Impressionists, especially Claude Monet, to Bastien-Lepage. In his 1920 &quot;Essay in Æsthetics&quot;, Fry wrote:
==Relationship with Marie Bashkirtseff==
Ukrainian-born painter Marie Bashkirtseff formed a close friendship with Bastien-Lepage. Artistically, she took her cue from the French painter&#x27;s admiration for nature: &quot;I say nothing of the fields because Bastien-Lepage reigns over them as a sovereign; but the streets, however, have not still had their... Bastien.&quot; Her best-known work in this naturalist vein is &quot;A Meeting&quot; (now in the Musée d&#x27;Orsay), which was shown to wide acclaim at the Paris Salon of 1884. By a curious coincidence she succumbed to chronic illness the same year as her colleague and friend.

==Art market==
The highest price reached by one of his paintings in the art market was when his &quot;Portrait of Sarah Bernhardt&quot; (1879) sold by $2,280,000 at Christie&#x27;s, on 20 October 2022.

<doc id="921508" wikidata="Q336905" url="?curid=921508" title="David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley">
<text>David George Philip Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley, ( ; born 27 June 1960), styled Viscount Malpas from birth until 1968, and subsequently Earl of Rocksavage until 1990, is a British peer and filmmaker who acted as Lord Great Chamberlain of the United Kingdom from 1990 to 2022.

==Early life and education==
Lord Cholmondeley is a descendant of Sir Robert Walpole (1676–1745), the first Prime Minister of Great Britain. He is the son of Hugh Cholmondeley, 6th Marquess of Cholmondeley, and Lavinia, Marchioness of Cholmondeley (née Leslie). He is also a descendant of both the Rothschild family and the Sassoon family through his paternal grandmother, Sybil Sassoon. He has three older sisters: the Ladies Rose, Margot (previously married to Tony Huston), and Caroline (married to Baron Rodolphe d&#x27;Erlanger).

Like many members of his family, Cholmondeley was educated at Eton College. He later studied at the Sorbonne in Paris.

==Career==

===Film industry===
Lord Cholmondeley is a filmmaker. As David Rocksavage, he also appeared in a small part in Eric Rohmer&#x27;s film &quot;4 aventures de Reinette et Mirabelle&quot; (1987). His professional name is derived from his title of Earl of Rocksavage.

He has made the following documentaries for television:
*1979, &quot;The Gentlemen Factory&quot;, about Eton College, (co-directed with Simon Dewhurst), BBC2 and Rank cinemas.
*1984, &quot;Madeleine Castaing, &quot; FR3
*1986, &quot;Portrait of My Grandmother,&quot; Anglia TV

In 1995, he directed the film adaptation of Truman Capote&#x27;s novel &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms&quot;.

In 2007, he directed &quot;Shadows in the Sun&quot;, starring Jean Simmons and James Wilby, which was shot in Norfolk. The film was released in 2009.

===Inherited title===
Cholmondeley became Marquess of Cholmondeley on 13 March 1990, upon the death of his father. Cholmondeley also inherited a half share of the office of Lord Great Chamberlain, and succeeded his father in exercising the function of the office for the duration of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s reign. As Lord Great Chamberlain, Cholmondeley was &quot;ex officio&quot; a member of the House of Lords and attended the House of Lords in his ceremonial role such as at the State Opening of Parliament, although he did not sit in the House of Lords for debates as he was on a leave of absence. Upon Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s death on 8 September 2022, Lord Cholmondeley ceased to be Lord Great Chamberlain and a member of the House of Lords, with the office of the Lord Great Chamberlain passing to Rupert Carington, 7th Baron Carrington.

==Lands and estates==
The family seats are Houghton Hall in Norfolk, and Cholmondeley Castle, which is surrounded by a estate near Malpas, Cheshire.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times Rich List&quot; in 2008, Cholmondeley has an estimated net worth of approximately £60m, attributed primarily to his inherited landholdings. Houghton Hall, ancestral home of the Marquesses of Cholmondeley since the establishment of the title in 1815, opens some of its rooms to the public, as well as the walled garden and extensive sculpture park.

The gardens of Cholmondeley Castle are also open to the public.

Cholmondeley was the co-author of the 2014 monograph on Houghton Hall published by Rizzoli.

In 2000 Cholmondeley commissioned Garlinda Birkbeck to photograph all the residents of his estates and the buildings within them in a survey that was bound in three volumes.

==Position at court==
In 1974, at the age of fourteen, Cholmondeley, then known as the Earl of Rocksavage, was appointed as a Page of Honour to Queen Elizabeth II. He relinquished this role upon reaching the age limit in 1976.

One moiety of the ancient office of Lord Great Chamberlain is a Cholmondeley inheritance. This hereditary honour came into the Cholmondeley family through the marriage of the first Marquess of Cholmondeley to Lady Georgiana Charlotte Bertie, daughter of General Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven. The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh holders of the marquessate have all held this office.

Cholmondeley exercised the office of Lord Great Chamberlain from 1990 to 2022, during the reign of Elizabeth II; in the event Charles III ceased to be king before Cholmondeley&#x27;s death, he would either exercise the office again or nominate a deputy to act on his behalf. In March 2023, he was appointed a permanent lord-in-waiting.

==Marriage and children==

Lord Cholmondeley married (Sarah) Rose Hanbury, a fashion model, on 24 June 2009, their engagement having been announced two days prior. She is a daughter of Timothy Hanbury, a website designer, and Emma Hanbury (née Longman), a fashion designer. The landed gentry Hanbury family lived at Holfield Grange, Coggeshall, Essex.

Her maternal grandmother is Lady Elizabeth Lambart, daughter of Field Marshal Rudolph Lambart, 10th Earl of Cavan; Lady Elizabeth was one of the bridesmaids at the 1947 wedding of Princess Elizabeth; her paternal grandmother, Sara, was the daughter of racing driver Sir Tim Birkin, 3rd Baronet.

On 12 October 2009, the Marchioness gave birth to twin sons, Alexander Hugh George and Oliver Timothy George. The elder son, Alexander, as heir apparent to the Marquessate, bears the courtesy title of Earl of Rocksavage; his brother is known as Lord Oliver Cholmondeley.

In March 2016, the Marquess and Marchioness had their third child, a daughter, Lady Iris Marina Aline Cholmondeley.

Lord Oliver Cholmondeley was a page of honour at the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on 6 May 2023 at which the Marquess wore his Coronation robes. He subsequently served as a page of honour to the King.

==Titles, styles and arms==

* 27 June 1960 – 16 September 1968: Viscount Malpas
* 16 September 1968 – 13 March 1990: Earl of Rocksavage
* 13 March 1990 – present: &quot;The Most Honourable&quot; The Marquess of Cholmondeley

As the eldest son of the heir apparent of the 5th Marquess, he was known from birth by the courtesy title of Viscount Malpas. Upon his grandfather&#x27;s death, he became the heir to the marquessate and was thus known by the courtesy title of Earl of Rocksavage, before inheriting the marquessate in 1990. He also inherited the following subsidiary titles:

* Baron Cholmondeley of Witch Malbank
* Baron Newburgh
* Earl of Cholmondeley
* Earl of Rocksavage
* Viscount Malpas
* Viscount Cholmondeley (Peerage of Ireland) 
* Baron Newborough (Peerage of Ireland)

==Honours==
* In the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List for 2007, Lord Cholmondeley was made a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) for his 17 years of service as Lord Great Chamberlain.
* In the Honours List on the Demise of HM Queen Elizabeth II, Lord Cholmondeley was promoted to a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO).
* He was awarded the UK Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002.
* He was awarded the UK Version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012.
* He serves as a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of Norfolk. This gives him the post-nominal letters &quot;DL&quot; for life.

<doc id="921511" wikidata="Q1770797" url="?curid=921511" title="John Chancellor">
<text>John William Chancellor (July 14, 1927 – July 12, 1996) was an American journalist who spent most of his career with NBC News. He is considered a pioneer in television news. Chancellor served as anchor of the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; from 1970 to 1982 and continued to do editorials and commentaries for &quot;NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw&quot; until 1993.

==Early career==
Born in Chicago, Illinois, Chancellor dropped out of high school, worked odd jobs and enlisted in the Army, serving in a public relations unit during World War II. After leaving the service, he attended the University of Illinois Navy Pier campus, completing the last two years of instruction at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1949. Originally a copy boy at 14 for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; and hired in 1947 to be a reporter for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, he started his career in local television in Chicago, eventually turning to national television news as a correspondent on NBC&#x27;s evening newscast, the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot;.
Chancellor covered issues of national importance while on &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report.&quot;

He covered the 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School, where a young Black girl, Elizabeth Eckford, wanted to attend an integrated school. Chancellor&#x27;s coverage showed the world the white mob that surrounded her. After Chancellor began to cover the Little Rock story, segregationists followed him around town, growing increasingly angry. Chancellor did not run. Instead, he kept reporting, despite the angry crowds around him.

Chancellor spent a number of years as a foreign correspondent in Europe, with postings in Vienna, London, Moscow, and Brussels (NATO Headquarters).

In July 1961, Chancellor replaced Dave Garroway as host of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; program, a role he filled for fourteen months. Never comfortable with the soft news focus of &quot;Today&quot;, Chancellor asked for, and was granted, a release from his contract with the show in the summer of 1962. He left the program in September, and assumed a role as political correspondent for NBC News. He, Frank McGee, Edwin Newman, and Sander Vanocur comprised a team that covered the national political conventions in the 1960s so well, they were dubbed by industry observers as the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;.

At the 1964 Republican National Convention, Chancellor was arrested for refusing to cede his spot on the floor to &quot;Goldwater Girls,&quot; supporters of the Republican presidential candidate, Barry Goldwater. When security came to get him, he was forced to sign off: &quot;I&#x27;ve been promised bail, ladies and gentlemen, by my office. This is John Chancellor, somewhere in custody.&quot; He then became the director of the Voice of America in 1965, at the request of President Lyndon Johnson, a spot he held until 1967.

== NBC Nightly News ==
Chancellor returned to NBC in 1968 as senior correspondent on the &quot;Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; and, two years later when Chet Huntley retired, Chancellor stepped in to anchor the broadcast, renamed &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, a spot he held from 1970 to 1982; this job became the defining point of his career. Inaugurating the name and setting the pace of the format of &quot;Nightly News,&quot; from 1970 to 1971, Chancellor, along with David Brinkley and Frank McGee, was one of three anchors who rotated in a co-anchor duo format, held over from &quot;Huntley-Brinkley.&quot; NBC arranged the rotation by having McGee always broadcast from New York City and Brinkley continue at his customary Washington desk. If McGee did not anchor on a broadcast, Chancellor did from New York; if Brinkley did not, Chancellor filled in from Washington. NBC did not have separate weekend anchors during this period, as it had just inaugurated a Sunday evening newscast in August 1970, so this format was employed seven days a week.

A perceived lack of stability in this arrangement prompted NBC to go with Chancellor full-time (McGee later moved to &quot;The Today Show&quot;). From August 9, 1971, to June 4, 1976, Chancellor became the sole weeknight anchor (Garrick Utley and others took over weekend duties), stationed at the New York NBC headquarters, with Brinkley reduced to contributing pre-recorded commentaries, titled &quot;David Brinkley&#x27;s Journal,&quot; about two to three times per week from Washington. Facing the continued popularity of top-rated &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; with Walter Cronkite, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; returned to a co-anchor format from June 7, 1976, until October 9, 1979, with Brinkley resuming his old role at the NBC Washington desk; internal disputes within NBC management prompted the network to remove Brinkley from &quot;Nightly News,&quot; assigning him to occasional documentaries until his departure for ABC in 1981.

Although Chancellor was a respected, well-spoken journalist and noted author in his own right, his broadcast ratings were eclipsed by Walter Cronkite in the 1970s, when &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; had become the most popular of the three network weeknight broadcasts. Toward the end of Chancellor&#x27;s tenure, ABC, for the first time ever, became competitive with NBC and CBS with its &quot;World News Tonight.&quot;

===&quot;Red&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; state concept===
Chancellor has the distinction of creating the idea of using colors to represent the states won by presidential candidates in presidential elections. For the 1976 presidential election Chancellor suggested to his network&#x27;s engineers that they create a large electronic map of the United States and place it in the network&#x27;s election-night news studio. If Jimmy Carter, the Democratic candidate, won a state it would light up in red; if Gerald Ford, the Republican candidate, carried a state it would light up in blue. Chancellor, when asked about the color scheme, sought to tie the British Labour&#x27;s red to the American Democrats while British Conservatives used blue as their ribbon color. By 2000, all the traditional broadcast networks had adopted the present model, though with the colors switched; red for Republicans (as both begin with the same letter), and blue for Democrats.

==Television career==
* 1956–70 &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; (correspondent)
* 1961–62 &quot;The Today Show&quot; (anchor)
* 1970–82 &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; (anchor)
* 1982–93 &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; (editorial/commentary)

==Later years, post-&quot;Nightly News&quot;==
Chancellor anchored the Nightly News through April 2, 1982, when he was succeeded by a co-anchor team of Tom Brokaw and Roger Mudd. Chancellor remained on the program, providing editorial commentaries until his retirement from NBC on July 9, 1993. During this time of his commentaries, he defined himself as a paragrapher in 1993, just before his retirement.

In 1992, Chancellor was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.
Chancellor was the narrator of &quot;Baseball&quot;, a documentary by Ken Burns. He also wrote a book, &quot;Peril and Promise: A Commentary on America&quot;, which was published in 1990. 
The John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism was established in 1995 and administered by the Annenberg Public Policy Center until 2004. It is now awarded by the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.

==Death==
After his retirement, Chancellor moved to Princeton, New Jersey, where he died of stomach cancer July 12, 1996, two days before his 69th birthday.

==Honors==
* 1977: Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Lowell Thomas
* 1983: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association
* 1988: Laureate of The Lincoln Academy of Illinois, Order of Lincoln
* 1993: Television Hall of Fame
* 1995: Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series (Baseball)

The author Anne Rivers Siddons gave her first book, a 1975 collection of nonfiction essays, the title &quot;John Chancellor Makes Me Cry&quot;.

<text>Wilhelm Lehmbruck (4 January 188125 March 1919) was a German sculptor. One of the most important of his generation, he was influenced by realism and expressionism.

==Biography==
Born in Meiderich (part of Duisburg from 1905), he was the fourth of eight children born to the miner Wilhelm Lehmbruck and his wife Margaretha. He was able to study sculpture arts at the School of Applied Arts in Düsseldorf by a stipend from the municipal authorities. In 1899 he began to make a living by doing illustrations for scientific publications. He trained at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf and is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting from 1901 to 1906. On leaving the academy Lehmbruck worked as an independent artist in Düsseldorf. He exhibited for the first time at the Deutsche Kunstausstellung, in Cologne in 1906. He was impressed by the sculptures of Auguste Rodin, and traveled to England, Italy, the Netherlands, and Paris. In 1907, he married Anita Kaufmann, and they had three sons.
In 1912, Lehmbruck exhibited in the Folkwang Museum in Hagen, with Egon Schiele. In 1914, he had his first solo exhibition in Paris, at the Galerie Levesque. He contributed to an exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris. From 1910–1914 he lived in Paris. He frequented the Café du Dôme, where he met sculptors such as Modigliani, Brâncuși, and Archipenko.

During World War I he served as a paramedic at a military hospital in Berlin. The suffering and misery he saw there are reflected in his late sculptures such as &quot;Fallen Man&quot; (1915–16). He suffered from severe depression and fled the war by going to Zürich at the end of 1916. There he made contact with the socialist, L. Rubiner, who collaborated on Franz Pfemfert&#x27;s &quot;Die Aktion&quot;. He was elected to the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin in early 1919. After the war, he returned to Berlin where he committed suicide on 25 March 1919.

==Sculpture ==
Lehmbruck&#x27;s sculptures mostly concentrate on the human body and are influenced by Naturalism and Expressionism. His works, including female nudes, are marked by a sense of melancholy and an elongation of form common to Gothic architecture.

Throughout his career, architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe placed his friend Lehmbruck&#x27;s sculptures and those of Aristide Maillol into his buildings and designs.

==Collections==
The Lehmbruck Museum (Duisburg, Germany) has in its collection about 100 sculptures, 40 paintings, 900 drawings and 200 graphical works by Wilhelm Lehmbruck. The museum, named after Wilhelm Lehmbruck, was originally designed by his son, Manfred Lehmbruck (1913–1992).
The Honolulu Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the National Gallery of Art (Washington D.C.), Städel Museum (Frankfurt, Germany), the Neue Nationalgalerie (Berlin, Germany) and the Tate Gallery (London, England) are among the public collections holding works by Wilhelm Lehmbruck. One of his sculptures can be seen in the Villa Tugendhat.

<doc id="921513" wikidata="Q305042" url="?curid=921513" title="Shardik">
<text>Shardik is a 1974 fantasy novel by Richard Adams. &quot;Shardik&quot; is his second novel (after &quot;Watership Down&quot; 1972, followed by &quot;Nature Through the Seasons&quot; 1975), and first of two novels set in the fictional Beklan Empire. The events revolve around the discovery, capture and military and symbolic uses made of an incredibly large bear, called &quot;Lord Shardik&quot; by those who subscribe to a set of religious beliefs in the novel.

==Plot==

When a tremendous fire ravages a forest, a bear twice as tall as a man flees to the river island of Ortelga, and is found exhausted by Kelderek, a hunter who thinks the bear may be Lord Shardik, &quot;the Power of God&quot;, returned to his worshippers. Kelderek shares his belief with the local barons and priestesses. The Ortelgans once ruled the Beklan Empire. Against the wishes of the Tuginda, the high priestess, a military campaign is launched to retake Bekla. The bear is sedated, caged, and carried to the campaign, awakening and breaking free in the middle of a battle which they are losing. Shardik&#x27;s attack demoralises the enemy and the opposing army is routed.

Shardik&#x27;s worship is restored to central prominence in Bekla with Kelderek as priest-king. Five years into his rule, Bekla remains at war and there is discontent, particularly over the Ortelgans&#x27; expansion of legal slavery. When the bear escapes and flees again, Kelderek alone follows in pursuit. The two of them stagger through the wilderness for a long time, both of them on the brink of starvation and madness, meeting many foes along the way. Kelderek loses both ability and desire to continue, having lost his faith. Finally reaching Zeray, a lawless town beyond the borders of civilisation, he re-encounters the Tuginda and Melathys, a former priestess of Shardik, and the two fall in love.

Kelderek is captured by Genshed, an unlicensed slave-trader with a large group of children, whom he delights in tormenting. Genshed is fleeing from insurrection forces who despise the slave trade, and many children do not survive the march. Genshed is on the point of killing Kelderek despite knowing his prisoner&#x27;s value as the former ruler of Bekla, when the dying Shardik erupts from the woods. The bear attacks Genshed, mortally wounding him before collapsing dead in the river. Kelderek, his faith restored, returns to the town of Zeray with the children and is appointed its governor by Bekla&#x27;s new rulers. Some years later, the town is now the home of so many orphans that children outnumber adults by two to one, and work in this society much like adults. Shardik&#x27;s death is perceived as sacred and a sign that all children are to be valued. Kelderek and Melathys are married with two children of their own, beginning trade negotiations with an emissary from the distant kingdom of Zakalon.

==Characters==

Shardik – An enormous bear more than twice as tall as a man, with huge curved claws longer than a man&#x27;s head. Shardik first appears in the opening chapters, when a forest fire forces him out of the wild lands north of the River Telthearna onto the island of Ortelga. Unlike the animals in Adams&#x27; earlier book &quot;Watership Down&quot;, Shardik does not speak or appear to have conscious thought, and apart from the opening sequence the story is not told from his perspective.

Kelderek (also called Crendrik by non-Ortelgans) – The main protagonist, an Ortelgan hunter and later priest-king of the Beklan empire, and finally governor of Zeray. Often nicknamed Zenzuata (&quot;Play-With-The-Children&quot;) as he seldom socialises with other people his age but instead prefers to play with the children. It is he who first sees the enormous bear, setting in motion the events which lead to the Ortelgans taking Bekla and himself being crowned king.

The Tuginda – High priestess of Ortelga, she opposes the capture of Shardik for the purposes of aiding the conquest of Bekla, and so is made a prisoner on the island of Quiso by Ta-Komininion (an act to which Kelderek is grudgingly complicit).

Melathys – A priestess second in authority to the Tuginda, who flees and abandons her position at the sight of Shardik but redeems herself later.

Bel-ka-Trazet – High Baron of the Ortelgans when Shardik is first discovered, and later ruler of the lawless outpost of Zeray. He is a pragmatic ruler and a rational man. He was disfigured by a bear when he was a young hunter.

Ta-Kominion – A charismatic young baron who usurps power from Bel-ka-Trazet and directs the campaign to take Bekla for the Ortelgans in its early stages and orders the Tuginda to be taken in chains when she disagrees with using Shardik.

Elleroth – Ban of Sarkid, in the southern province of Yelda, outwardly loyal to the Ortelgans, but working for the rebel general Santil-kè-Erketlis. His son is taken by Genshed as a slave, fuelling his resentment of Ortelgan rule.

Genshed – Sadistic child slaver who has Elleroth&#x27;s son in his service.

== Setting ==

&quot;Shardik&quot; takes place in the Beklan Empire, which consists of twelve vassal provinces and independent domains organized around the central Beklan province, at the centre of which is the empire&#x27;s capital, Bekla. The capital is typically controlled by factions from one of the provinces, and the outermost provinces continuously threaten to break free. The lingua franca of the empire is the Beklan language. The subdivisions are Bekla (the capital), Belishba, Chalcon, Gelt, Lapan, Kabin of the Waters, Ortelga, Paltesh, Tonilda, Ur-tah, Yelda, and Sarkid of the Sheaves.

== Related works ==
Adams later wrote the loose prequel &quot;Maia&quot;, a novel that takes place in and around Bekla about a dozen years earlier. Several characters from &quot;Shardik&quot; appear as minor characters in &quot;Maia&quot;, e.g. Melathys and Genshed.

==Influence==
The bear Guardian in Stephen King&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series is named for this Shardik.

Jeff VanderMeer drew inspiration from &quot;Shardik&quot; when creating the character Mord, a giant biotech bear who dominates an unnamed city in VanderMeer&#x27;s 2017 novel &quot;Borne&quot;.

<text>Lloyd&#x27;s Register Group Limited, trading as Lloyd&#x27;s Register (LR), is a technical and professional services organisation and a maritime classification society, wholly owned by the Lloyd’s Register Foundation, a UK charity dedicated to research and education in science and engineering. The organisation dates to 1760. Its stated aims are to enhance the safety of life, property, and the environment, by helping its clients (including by validation, certification, and accreditation) to improve the safety and performance of complex projects, supply chains and critical infrastructure.

In July 2012, the organisation converted from an industrial and provident society to a company limited by shares, named Lloyd’s Register Group Limited, with the new Lloyd’s Register Foundation as the sole shareholder. At the same time the organisation gave to the Foundation a substantial bond and equity portfolio to assist it with its charitable purposes. It will benefit from continued funding from the group’s operating arm, Lloyd’s Register Group Limited.

In 2020, Lloyd&#x27;s Register sold its Energy business and in 2021 sold its Business Assurance &amp; Inspection Services division. In 2022, LR acquired OneOcean Group, a marine software and digital services company, to head up a new digital services division.

Lloyd&#x27;s Register is unaffiliated with Lloyd&#x27;s of London, but emerged from the same professional and social circles that historically met at Lloyd&#x27;s Coffee House, from which both organisations took their name.

== History ==
=== Origin ===
The organisation was named after a seventeenth-century coffee house in London that was frequented by merchants, marine underwriters, and others associated with shipping. The coffee house owner, Edward Lloyd, helped them to exchange information by circulating a printed sheet of all the news he heard. In 1760, the Register Society was formed by the customers of the coffee house who assembled the &quot;Register of Shipping&quot;, the first known register of its type. Between 1800 and 1833, a dispute between shipowners and underwriters resulted in each group publishing a list—the &quot;Red Book&quot; and the &quot;Green Book&quot;. Both parties came to the verge of bankruptcy. They reached agreement in 1834 to unite and form Lloyd’s Register of British and Foreign Shipping, establishing a General Committee and charitable values. In 1914, with an increasingly international outlook, the organisation changed its name to Lloyd&#x27;s Register of Shipping.

=== The &quot;Register&quot; ===
The Society printed the first &quot;Register of Ships&quot; in 1764 in order to give both underwriters and merchants an idea of the condition of the vessels they insured and chartered: ship hulls were graded by a lettered scale (A being the best), and ship&#x27;s fittings (masts, rigging, and other equipment) were graded by number (1 being the best). Thus the best classification &quot;A1&quot;, from which the expression &quot;A1&quot; or &quot;A1 at Lloyd&#x27;s&quot; is derived, first appeared in the 1775–76 edition of the Register.

The Register, with information on all seagoing, self-propelled merchant ships of 100 gross tons or greater, is published annually. A vessel remains registered with Lloyd&#x27;s Register until it is sunk, wrecked, hulked, scrapped or withdrawn from the register by the vessel&#x27;s owner.

The Register was published formerly by the joint venture company of Lloyd&#x27;s Register-Fairplay, which was formed in July 2001 by the merger of Lloyd&#x27;s Register&#x27;s Maritime Information Publishing Group and Prime Publications Limited. Lloyd&#x27;s Register sold its share of the venture to IHS Markit in 2009.

===&quot;American Lloyd’s Register of American and Foreign Shipping&quot;===

The American Lloyd’s Registry of American and Foreign Shipping was established in 1857, and the &quot;American Lloyd’s Register of American and Foreign Shipping&quot; issued from at least 1859 until at least 1883 by the &quot;Board of American Lloyd&#x27;s&quot;.

== Corporate structure ==

Lloyd&#x27;s Register&#x27;s main office is located in London at 71 Fenchurch Street. Lloyd&#x27;s Register also operates in more than 70 locations, serving clients based in 182 countries.

Lloyd&#x27;s Register has changed and expanded over the last 250 years with the industrial revolutions - from a time when steam engines were developed for mechanical production to the digital and cyber technology of today. The latter developments are reflected, among other things, in the acquisition of Senergy, an integrated energy service provider, in 2013 and Nettitude, a cyber security specialist in 2018. Lloyd’s Register has built a portfolio of digital, data and software solutions including greenfencetm, RTAMO and Seasafe.
== Services ==
===Nuclear ships project===
In January 2024, Lloyd&#x27;s Register signed a MOU with KEPCO, Zodiac Maritime and KSOE to assess rule requirements for the safe operation and regulatory compliance of nuclear powered bulk carriers and container ships to be designed and built by the consortium.

=== Classification rules ===
Lloyd&#x27;s Register is known best for the classification and certification of ships and inspects and approves important components and accessories, including life-saving appliances, marine pollution prevention, fire protection, navigation, radio communication equipment, deck gear, cables, ropes, and anchors.

LR&#x27;s &quot;Rules for Ships&quot;

LR&#x27;s &quot;Rules for Ships&quot; are derived from principles of naval architecture and marine engineering, and govern safety and operational standards for numerous merchant, military, and privately owned vessels. LR&#x27;s &quot;Rules&quot; govern a number of topics including:
* Materials used for construction of the vessel
* Ship structural requirements and minimum scantlings, depending on ship type
* Operation and maintenance of main and auxiliary machinery
* Operation and maintenance of emergency and control systems

Specific editions of the rules are available to cater for merchant ships, naval ships, trimarans, special purpose vessels and offshore structures. A ship is known as being &quot;in class&quot; if she meets all the minimum requirements of LR&#x27;s &quot;Rules&quot;, and such a status affects the possibility of a ship getting insurance. Class can be withdrawn from a ship if she is in violation of any regulations and does not maintain the minimum requirements specified by the company. However, exceptional circumstances may warrant special dispensation from Lloyd&#x27;s Register. Any alteration to the vessel, whether it is a structural alteration or machinery, must be approved by Lloyd&#x27;s Register before it is implemented.

Ships are inspected on a regular basis by a team of Lloyd&#x27;s Register surveyors, one of the most important inspections being a ship&#x27;s load line survey – due once every five years. Such a survey includes an inspection of the hull to make sure that the load line has not been altered. Numerous other inspections such as the condition of hatch and door seals, safety barriers, and guard rails are also performed. Upon completion the ship is allowed to be operated for another year, and is issued a load line certificate.

<text>Monica Roşu (born 11 May 1987) is a former artistic gymnast from Romania. During her career, she won two Olympic gold medals (team and vault), a silver medal with the Romanian team at world championships, and two gold medals at the European Championships (team and vault).

==Early life and career==
Roşu was born in Bacău. She started gymnastics in 1991 at age four and trained during her early years at CSS Bacău. Roşu competed at the Top Gym Tournament in early 2000. When two juniors from Deva pulled out unexpectedly just days before the meet began, Roşu was selected as a last-minute replacement. Competing with an ankle injury, she finished 12th all-around. Roşu competed internationally in the Netherlands and Slovakia in 2001. Always a powerful tumbler, she made great strides in vaulting and floor exercise and soon moved with her teammates to the national training center in Deva. Still a junior in 2002, she competed at the Romanian International, placing fourth. She went on to be a part of the junior squad at the European Championships, where she earned bronze medals on vault and floor exercise. At her second and last participation at the Top Gym Tournament, she won the trophy ahead of teammate Alexandra Eremia.

==Senior career==
Roşu competed at her first world championships in the United States in 2003, winning silver with her team and placing fourth on the vault. She then won gold on vault and with the team at the European Championships the following spring.
Roşu&#x27;s finest hour came during the 2004 Olympics in Athens. With Cătălina Ponor, Daniela Sofronie, Oana Ban, Alexandra Eremia and Silvia Stroescu, she helped Romania defend its Olympic team title. In a dominant performance, they won by nearly a full point and finished first on three of the four apparatus. The strongest vaulter on the team, Roşu contributed scores in the finals of 9.625 on vault and 9.387 on bars. She also won gold on the vault, competing the two most difficult vaults of the Olympic Games. She scored 9.575 (start value: 9.9) and 9.737 (start value: 10.0). She was nearly two tenths ahead of her nearest rival, Annia Hatch of the United States.

==Retirement==
After injuring herself in 2005 and showing sub-par performances, Roşu failed to make the 2005 World Championship team and has since retired. In 2005, she participated in the televised competition Kunoichi and the TV show Monster Box in Japan. In 2009, she was the host of a TV show (&quot;Forma Maxima&quot;) aimed at promoting a healthy lifestyle, broadcast by the Romanian TVR1 channel. Among her guests were Ion Țiriac, Ilie Năstase and Gheorghe Hagi. As of 2010, Roşu was studying for her master&#x27;s in sport management in Bucharest, Romania.

==Achievements==
*2000 Top Gym Tournament: 6th Team, 12th A-A, 6th BB 12th FX, 6 V
*2001 Tournament of Arques: 3rd A-A
*2001 Slovakian International: 4th A-A, 6th BB, 7th UB, 7th FX
*2001 Hypotheek Tournament: 2nd A-A

She won a silver medal on vault at the 2004 World Cup Final.

<doc id="921525" wikidata="Q187465" url="?curid=921525" title="Maxwell relations">
<text>Maxwell&#x27;s relations are a set of equations in thermodynamics which are derivable from the symmetry of second derivatives and from the definitions of the thermodynamic potentials. These relations are named for the nineteenth-century physicist James Clerk Maxwell.

==Equations==

The structure of Maxwell relations is a statement of equality among the second derivatives for continuous functions. It follows directly from the fact that the order of differentiation of an analytic function of two variables is irrelevant (Schwarz theorem). In the case of Maxwell relations the function considered is a thermodynamic potential and formula_1 and formula_2 are two different natural variables for that potential, we have

where the partial derivatives are taken with all other natural variables held constant. For every thermodynamic potential there are formula_3 possible Maxwell relations where formula_4 is the number of natural variables for that potential.

== The four most common Maxwell relations ==

The four most common Maxwell relations are the equalities of the second derivatives of each of the four thermodynamic potentials, with respect to their thermal natural variable (temperature formula_5, or entropy and their &quot;mechanical&quot; natural variable (pressure formula_6, or volume 

where the potentials as functions of their natural thermal and mechanical variables are the internal energy formula_7, enthalpy formula_8, Helmholtz free energy formula_9, and Gibbs free energy formula_10. The thermodynamic square can be used as a mnemonic to recall and derive these relations. The usefulness of these relations lies in their quantifying entropy changes, which are not directly measurable, in terms of measurable quantities like temperature, volume, and pressure.

Each equation can be re-expressed using the relationship
formula_11
which are sometimes also known as Maxwell relations.

== Derivations ==

=== Short derivation ===
Suppose we are given four real variables formula_12, restricted to move on a 2-dimensional formula_13 surface in formula_14. Then, if we know two of them, we can determine the other two uniquely (generically).

In particular, we may take any two variables as the independent variables, and let the other two be the dependent variables, then we can take all these partial derivatives.

Proposition:
formula_15

Proof: This is just the chain rule.

Proposition:
formula_16

Proof. We can ignore formula_17. Then locally the surface is just formula_18. Then formula_19, etc. Now multiply them.

Proof of Maxwell&#x27;s relations:

There are four real variables formula_20, restricted on the 2-dimensional surface of possible thermodynamic states. This allows us to use the previous two propositions.

It suffices to prove the first of the four relations, as the other three can be obtained by transforming the first relation using the previous two propositions.
Pick formula_21 as the independent variables, and formula_22 as the dependent variable. We have
formula_23.

Now, formula_24 since the surface is formula_13, that is,formula_26which yields the result.

=== Another derivation ===

Since formula_27, around any cycle, we haveformula_28Take the cycle infinitesimal, we find that formula_29. That is, the map is area-preserving. By the chain rule for Jacobians, for any coordinate transform formula_30, we haveformula_31Now setting formula_30 to various values gives us the four Maxwell relations. For example, setting formula_33 gives us formula_34

=== Extended derivations ===
Maxwell relations are based on simple partial differentiation rules, in particular the total differential of a function and the symmetry of evaluating second order partial derivatives.

== Derivation based on Jacobians ==

If we view the first law of thermodynamics,
formula_35
as a statement about differential forms, and take the exterior derivative of this equation, we get
formula_36
since formula_37. This leads to the fundamental identity
formula_38

The physical meaning of this identity can be seen by noting that the two sides are the equivalent ways of writing the work done in an infinitesimal Carnot cycle. An equivalent way of writing the identity is
formula_39

The Maxwell relations now follow directly. For example,
formula_40
The critical step is the penultimate one. The other Maxwell relations follow in similar fashion. For example,
formula_41

== General Maxwell relationships ==

The above are not the only Maxwell relationships. When other work terms involving other natural variables besides the volume work are considered or when the number of particles is included as a natural variable, other Maxwell relations become apparent. For example, if we have a single-component gas, then the number of particles &quot;N&quot;  is also a natural variable of the above four thermodynamic potentials. The Maxwell relationship for the enthalpy with respect to pressure and particle number would then be:

formula_42

where is the chemical potential. In addition, there are other thermodynamic potentials besides the four that are commonly used, and each of these potentials will yield a set of Maxwell relations. For example, the grand potential formula_43 yields:
formula_44

<text>Émilie Le Pennec (born 31 December 1987) is a French retired artistic gymnast. Le Pennec was the 2004 Olympic Champion on the uneven bars and was the first, and to date the only, female French gymnast to win an Olympic medal in women&#x27;s artistic gymnastics.

==Career==
Le Pennec was born in La Garenne-Colombes, Hauts-de-Seine. Coached by Yves Kieffer at Pôle France INSEP in Paris, she was the French junior national champion in 2002. At her first senior nationals in 2003, she came fifth, but won a silver medal in her specialty, the uneven bars. She represented France at the 2002 Junior European Championships, where she won a bronze medal in the team event. At the 2003 World Gymnastics Championships, Le Pennec was a member of the 10th-place French team. She also qualified for the all-around and the floor exercise finals, where she finished 11th and seventh, respectively.

At the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Le Pennec placed sixth with the French team and 14th in the all-around final. However, she shone in the uneven bars event final, where her challenging routine helped her win a gold medal over a tough field with numerous Olympic and world champions, including Svetlana Khorkina (who took an infamous fall from the apparatus, which she traditionally dominated) and 2002 World Champion Courtney Kupets. Her medal marked the first ever (and to date the only) for a French female gymnast.
She became the third (and to date the last) French Olympic Champion in gymnastics, after Gustave Sandras in 1900 and Albert Séguin in 1924.

Le Pennec continued to train and compete after the Olympics. In 2005, she earned two medals at the European Championships: gold on uneven bars and bronze on floor. She also qualified to the all-around finals in first place, but lost any chance for a medal when she fell during her balance beam routine. Le Pennec also competed in the 2005 World Championships in Melbourne, but mistakes prevented her from medalling.

One of Le Pennec&#x27;s competitive uneven bars routine was considered to be one of the most technically difficult in the world. In it, she completed a Def (a Gienger release move with a full twist), an element classified at the top difficulty level, Super-E, in the 2005 &quot;Code of Points.&quot; Le Pennec also performed a double-twisting double back tuck salto dismount.

Le Pennec missed the 2006 European Championships to concentrate on schoolwork. Later, recuperating from an Achilles&#x27; tendon injury and acting on the advice of her doctors, she sat out of the 2006 World Championships.

On 27 September 2007, she announced via a press release that she had put an end to her career, mainly after failing to retrieve her level after her multiple injuries in 2006–2007, the latest being a heel injury contracted during the Vittel international match in August 2007.

Olympic Bars Routine: Jump to the low bar immediately to the high bar; hop with full turn; Def (Gienger with 1.5 turn); full pirouette into overshoot to handstand down to the low bar into toe shoot to high bar; double-twisting double back tuck somersault. (S.V: 10.0)

== Later life ==

During the 2008 Summer Olympics, she worked as a consultant for the French TV Canal+.

After she retired from gymnastics, Le Pennec studied to become a physical therapist. She practices in Paris.

Le Pennec participated in the Olympic torch relay at the 2024 Summer Olympics opening ceremony.

<text>WMCA (570 AM) is a radio station licensed to New York, New York. Owned by Salem Media Group, the station programs a Christian radio format consisting of teaching and talk programs. The station&#x27;s studios are in Lower Manhattan and are shared with co-owned WNYM (970 AM). WMCA&#x27;s transmitter is located along Belleville Turnpike in Kearny, New Jersey. WMCA&#x27;s programming is simulcast on a 250-watt translator, W272DX (102.3 MHz), from a tower in Clifton, New Jersey.

Prior to switching to its current programming in 1989, WMCA was a talk radio station during the 1970s and 1980s, and earlier a Top 40 outlet featuring a lineup of disc jockeys known as the &quot;Good Guys&quot;. WMCA is credited with having been the first New York radio station to broadcast a recording by The Beatles.

==History==
===Early years===
After first testing as station 2XH, WMCA began regular transmission on February 1, 1925, broadcasting on 428.6 meters wavelength (700 kHz) with a power of 500 watts. It was the 13th radio station to begin operations in New York City and was owned by broadcasting pioneer Donald Flamm. The station&#x27;s original studios and antenna were located at the Hotel McAlpin, located on Herald Square and from which the WMCA call sign derives.

In 1928 it moved to the 570 kHz frequency, sharing time for the next three years with municipally-owned WNYC. On April 19, 1932, the Federal Radio Commission approved WMCA&#x27;s application to broadcast full-time on 570 kHz.

In December 1940, Flamm had to surrender the station to industrialist Edward J. Noble, who had just resigned as Undersecretary of Commerce, in a transaction involving prominent political figures including Thomas Corcoran. Flamm&#x27;s subsequent legal battle against Noble resulted in a congressional investigation and eventually ended in a financial settlement, though not the return of the station.

Through its early decades, WMCA had a varied programming history, playing music, hosting dramas, and broadcasting New York Giants baseball games. Beginning in the 1930s, WMCA carried the daily &quot;Morning Cheer&quot; religious program of George A. Palmer, originating in Philadelphia. In 1943, the station was acquired by the Straus family when Edward J. Noble acquired the Blue Network and its owned-and-operated stations from NBC, including WJZ in New York; the Blue Network would later be renamed the American Broadcasting Company (ABC).

WMCA broadcast the first Negro-oriented anthology series &quot;New World A&#x27;Coming&quot;, written by Roi Ottley in 1944. And in 1945, host Barry Gray began dropping music and adding talk with celebrities and later call-ins from listeners. Gray is sometimes considered &quot;The Father of Talk Radio&quot;, and his show on WMCA lasted through several decades and format changes.

WMCA began playing hit music in the late 1950s with a Top 40 format. Among its disc jockey staff were Scott Muni, Frankie Crocker, Harry Harrison, and Murray the K.

===Good Guys era===

In 1960, WMCA began promoting itself by stressing its on-air personalities, who were collectively known as the Good Guys. The station was led by program director Ruth Meyer, the first woman to hold the position in New York City radio. This was the era of the high-profile, fast-talking Top 40 disc jockey with an exuberant personality aimed at a youthful audience. With the advent of the &quot;Good Guys&quot; format, WMCA saw its ratings increase and become known for &quot;playing the hits&quot;.

In the early 1960s, the top 40 format was still young, and the field was crowded in New York City. Two major 50,000-watt stations, WMGM and WINS, had battled each other, playing the top hits for several years. Then in 1960, WABC joined the fray and started featuring top 40 music. Ultimately, the competition between WMCA and WABC forced WMGM (in early 1962) and then WINS (in spring 1965) to abandon the top-40 format and find new niches.

The classic Good Guys era lineup included:
* Joe O&#x27;Brien, an industry veteran whose humor appealed to multiple generations. (6am–10am)
* Harry Harrison, whose show was aimed at housewives of that era. (10am–1pm)
* Jack Spector, whose closing line was &quot;Look out street, here I come!&quot; (1pm–4pm)
* Dandy Dan Daniel a lanky, smooth-talking Texan, and his daily countdown. (4pm–7pm)
* Gary Stevens and his &quot;Wooleyburger&quot; bear, aimed at teenagers listening on small transistor radios in their rooms. (7pm–11pm - First show was in April 1965)
* B. Mitchel Reed, &quot;BMR, Your Leader&quot; Reed was the evening personality on WMCA from 1963 to 1965. He was part of the team that took WMCA to the top in 1963. He left the station in the spring of 1965, to return to L.A.&#x27;s troubled KFWB, where he had worked before WMCA. His on-air hours were the same as Gary Stevens.
* Barry Gray, a talk show host who had been on WMCA before the Top 40 era and continued after it. (11pm–1am)
* Dean Anthony, &quot;Dino on your radio&quot; with his &quot;Actors and Actresses&quot; game (1am–6am).
* Weekends and fill-in, Ed Baer, Frank Stickle, and Bill Beamish.
* Owner R. Peter Straus was one of the first station owners to frequently read editorials on air, commenting on current events.

Straus was an active owner. In an on-air editorial, he endorsed John F. Kennedy for President in 1960. He also wrote and read the first broadcast editorial calling for the impeachment of Pres. Richard Nixon. In 1961, Straus and WMCA filed a lawsuit charging that the state legislature was violating the Constitution by giving rural areas disproportionate representation. That suit, combined with others, led to the Supreme Court of the United States 1964 &quot;one man, one vote&quot; decision. During the later talk era, Straus would sometimes go on the air to take listener questions and comments about the radio station.

On Friday nights, Gary Stevens ended at 10:30 and WMCA&#x27;s locally produced, half-hour news show &quot;The World Tonite&quot; aired. (This was a local recap of the week&#x27;s news, and should not be confused with Garner Ted Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;The World Tomorrow&quot; religious program, which was heard on WMCA after the Good Guys era ended.)

Dan Daniel&#x27;s countdown changed each week and consisted of the station&#x27;s top 25 records. It also included a &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and &quot;Long Shot&quot; of records not yet on the chart. He also gave away his &quot;Hit Kit&quot; every day to a listener who had been chosen from postcards sent to the station. The &quot;Hit Kit&quot; consisted of a copy of each of the Top 25 records of the week. To claim this prize, listeners had to call in when they heard their name read on the air.

===The Beatles===
On December 26, 1963, WMCA, with Jack Spector as the DJ, earned the distinction of being the first New York City radio station to play the Beatles&#x27; Capitol Records&#x27; single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;. (Outside New York, the song&#x27;s broadcast debut in America is widely accepted to have occurred earlier at WWDC in Washington, D.C.) There is no evidence that any New York City radio station played the Beatles before December 1963 despite the fact that the band&#x27;s first singles had been released earlier, without fanfare, by smaller, resource-challenged labels (Vee-Jay Records and Swan Records). However, according to one account, rival Top 40 outlet WINS &quot;reportedly&quot; played the band&#x27;s Swan Records single &quot;She Loves You&quot; on September 28, 1963, as part of a listener&#x27;s poll. After the song finished last (third place), it was quickly dropped from the station&#x27;s playlist. WMCA was keen on playing new songs and breaking new hits and, consequently, it became the radio station most credited for introducing Beatlemania, and the subsequent &quot;British Invasion&quot; musical movement to New Yorkers.

While network-owned WABC was busy broadcasting New York Mets baseball games in the summer of 1963, family-owned WMCA was the music-intensive station that one would hear coming out of transistor radios at pools and beaches. Starting in 1963, the WMCA&#x27;s Good Guys soared to the top of New York City&#x27;s Arbitron ratings. WMCA also was known for its on-air production and promotions. Each hour, WMCA presented its music, jingles, promotions, contests, stagers, and commercials in a tight, upbeat fast-paced style. Some radio industry veterans attribute WABC&#x27;s &quot;stodgy sound&quot; to standards applied by its corporate ownership and to its staff of longtime (and older) studio engineers. This fueled speculation that independently-owned WMCA had younger, more &quot;hip&quot; board-operators with a better understanding of the top 40 format aimed at younger adults. Whatever the reason, the &quot;sparkling sound&quot; presented on-air by WMCA also contributed to its ratings success in New York City, the largest radio market in the United States.

WMCA&#x27;s most famous promotions and contests involved the Beatles. Shortly after the band&#x27;s arrival in the United States on February 7, 1964, WMCA secured the Beatles&#x27; cooperation, recording several commercials promoting the station&#x27;s &quot;Good Guys&quot;. Many believe this cooperation was directly linked to the band&#x27;s awareness of WMCA being the first radio station in New York City to play &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; weeks earlier. According to industry observers, WMCA&#x27;s success getting John Lennon and Ringo Starr to record several spots on behalf of WMCA convinced listeners that the station (along with WINS personality Murray the K, who called himself &quot;The Fifth Beatle&quot;) had direct access to the group. This was despite the fact that during their first New York visit the band&#x27;s movements were restricted to the Plaza Hotel, Central Park, CBS Studio 50 (where they appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;), the 21 Club, the Peppermint Lounge, and Carnegie Hall.
In February 1964, WMCA held a contest for a chance to win a lock of hair belonging to Ringo Starr. It received nearly 90,000 entries. The lock of hair, and a runner-up prize of a photograph on a fan club card signed by all four the Beatles, were obtained directly from the group during marathon &quot;one-on-one&quot; meetings and a reception held with print and broadcast personnel at Plaza Hotel on February 10. Other runner-up prizes distributed by WMCA that were not directly handled by the Beatles included 1,000 specially made WMCA paper record sleeves picturing the Good Guys, containing the band&#x27;s single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, as well as $57.00 in cash, reminding listeners of WMCA&#x27;s spot on the radio dial.

Contrary to some accounts, the enormous number of entries received by WMCA, an estimated 86,000 cards, letters, and packages, were from Beatle fans seeking only to obtain the lock of Starr&#x27;s hair. For this &quot;Good Guy-Ringo Starr Contest&quot; (better known today as the &quot;Beatles&#x27; Wig Contest&quot;) WMCA&#x27;s listeners were encouraged to send in a drawing or picture of a person wearing a Beatles&#x27; wig. The winning entry from Roberta Corrigan (who won the lock of hair) featured a huge image of Queen Elizabeth II with a Beatles wig on her head, along with several other images including one of former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wearing the same, all submitted in a book with captions for each. Runner-up winner Stella Scuotto of Brooklyn won the photograph of the Beatles on a fan club card signed by all four members of the band at the Plaza Hotel. According to Beatles&#x27; historian Bruce Spizer, Kay Smith was also a runner-up winner, winning $57 and the rare record sleeve for &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot;, featuring a picture of WMCA&#x27;s Good Guys.
WMCA continued to beat other radio stations on many Beatles&#x27; promotions, scoring firsts, causing headaches in particular for rival WABC, most notably when Capitol Records printed a photograph of the &quot;Good Guys&quot; lineup on the back of a limited edition record sleeve for the single, &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand&quot; (Side 2: &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot;). WMCA&#x27;s Good Guys were also featured at both of the Beatles&#x27; concerts at Shea Stadium on August 15, 1965, and August 23, 1966.

WABC responded in different ways, scoring a major success during the Beatles&#x27; second New York visit in August 1964 when the band stayed at the Delmonico Hotel, rousing thousands of teenage fans into a frenzy while broadcasting from one floor above the Beatles&#x27; rooms. WABC later went against its own music policies, promising promoter Sid Bernstein that it would play a new group he was handling before any other New York City radio station if it could get exclusive access to the Beatles. WABC never added records &quot;out of the box&quot;, but it did for Bernstein when it played The Young Rascals&#x27; &quot;I Ain&#x27;t Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore&quot; before other radio stations. WABC also had a source in London able to provide the station with many British releases that were not yet available in the United States or to the other New York radio stations and thus were played exclusively on WABC for at least a few days to a couple of weeks.

Since WABC knew WMCA already had a relationship with the Beatles, WABC devised clever ways to one-up its competitor. In August 1965, WABC came up with its own special promotion, issuing &quot;medals&quot; called &quot;The Order of the All-Americans&quot; which was the name given to WABC&#x27;s DJ line up. It intended to present the medals to each of the Beatles when the group next returned to New York. The goal was to get each Beatle to comment on the &quot;medal&quot; and then to get each to say the station&#x27;s call letters, &quot;W-A-B-C&quot;, which could then be used in station identification and on-air promos. The station got its interviews, but none of the band&#x27;s members would utter WABC&#x27;s call letters. According to Beatles&#x27; historian Bruce Spizer, manager Brian Epstein ordered the Beatles to stop &quot;giving away valuable promotional spots to radio stations for free.&quot;. Ultimately, the WMCA-WABC (and to an extent WINS) competition for Beatles releases and promotions is considered to be one of the greatest radio &quot;battles&quot; in medium&#x27;s history.

Apart from its link to the Beatles, WMCA saturated its programming with many other promotions and on-air games. They included &quot;Name It and Claim It&quot;, with the most desired prize being one of the station&#x27;s yellow &quot;Good Guys&quot; sweatshirts, which were designed by WMCA program director Ruth Meyer. The sweatshirts could be won if a listener&#x27;s name was read over the air and that listener called PLaza 2-9944 within a certain time period.

Another distinctive feature of WMCA was its &quot;Call For Action&quot; help line (PLaza 9-1717), which listeners could call if they had any problems requiring WMCA&#x27;s help resolving, usually consumer or public works service-related issues.

===Competition with WABC===
In the 1960s, WMCA&#x27;s great competition was with rival WABC. Radio historians have tended to treat WMCA as a radio stepchild, the proverbial David going up against the Goliath that was corporate-owned, stronger-signaled WABC.

For four consecutive years (1963 through 1966) WMCA had the highest ratings share of all radio stations in New York City, according to Arbitron, in spite of its directional, 5,000-watt signal which could not cover the same geographic region as non-directional, 50,000-watt WABC. However, WMCA&#x27;s directional signal is aimed toward Manhattan from just over the river in New Jersey, and its low frequency (570 kHz) results in strong Midtown Manhattan coverage. At the time, Arbitron was the newer and lesser quoted ratings source compared to the more established Pulse and Hooper Ratings. During this time frame, Pulse and Hooper usually placed adult full-service WOR as the overall number-one station, with WMCA generally but not always leading WABC and WINS as the Top 40 leader. WMCA&#x27;s ratings strength was concentrated within New York City itself. However, WABC proved more popular in suburban areas where WMCA&#x27;s signal didn&#x27;t come in as well on standard 1960s-era AM radio receivers. The areas where WMCA did not have a strong signal were southwest, west, and northwest of its transmitter. By 1967 and 1968, WMCA ratings had started to decline significantly but still demonstrated a strong showing in the five boroughs (although not the suburbs), and as late as February 1969, Pulse ratings surveys indicated that WMCA beat WABC in New York City itself, although not in the full market. From 1967 forward, WABC had become the leading top 40 station in the total market.

In addition to its ratings strength, between 1964 and 1968, &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine rated WMCA as New York&#x27;s most influential station for new records. Although every market had one station with record-buying influence, WMCA was in the top market, making it responsible for some songs becoming hits nationwide. Not every record added to the WMCA playlist became a hit, but as soon as sales stirred, WABC, with a shorter playlist of hits, would be forced to add the same record. With its longer playlist, WMCA played new records faster than rival WABC. WMCA&#x27;s weekly countdown list was 25 records, compared with WABC&#x27;s 20 song list. WMCA&#x27;s included the &quot;Sure Shot&quot; and &quot;Long Shot&quot; speculations. WMCA&#x27;s countdown was also &quot;faster&quot; than WABC&#x27;s, in the sense that records climbed to the top more quickly, while WABC&#x27;s rankings tended to lag behind. A comparison of both stations showed WABC to be up to two, sometimes three weeks behind WMCA.

The WMCA-WABC rivalry was never more intense than when it came to fighting over the Beatles. WABC was frustrated with its efforts to gain ratings dominance in New York City&#x27;s ratings and with its efforts to forge a stronger relationship with one of the world&#x27;s most popular musical acts. WMCA program director Ruth Meyer would later speculate in interviews that WABC&#x27;s creativity during the 1960s could have been hampered by being owned by an ABC network rife with nationwide broadcast policies, commitments, and standards. Conversely, WMCA could run free with &quot;goofy&quot; ideas, promotions, and gimmicks as an independently run, family-owned station, without network interference.

According to WABC historians, &quot;another success for WMCA was the fault of WABC itself.&quot; In 1969, WABC overnight host Roby Yonge, upon learning his contract with the station was not going to be renewed, used his shift to spread rumors about the &quot;death&quot; of Paul McCartney. This episode proved to be an embarrassment for WABC, leading to Yonge&#x27;s firing, and WABC&#x27;s status as a network-owned, clear-channel station mistakenly launched the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; story across America and ultimately around the world.

WMCA&#x27;s ratings decline was due to several factors: the January 1968 split of the ABC Radio Network into four distinct components allowed WABC to drop &quot;Don McNeill&#x27;s Breakfast Club&quot; and become fully music-intensive during the day. Around the same time Ruth Meyer exited WMCA, the station temporarily dropped the &quot;Good Guy&quot; branding and it also lost key personalities, including Harry Harrison, who moved to WABC. Additionally, the ascendance of R&amp;B station WWRL in 1967 and of two FM rock stations – WOR-FM in 1967 and WNEW-FM in 1968 – all took ratings away from WMCA.

===Transition===
In 1968, a chaotic period began in which Gary Stevens relocated to Switzerland and Harry Harrison moved to WABC, where he replaced Herb Oscar Anderson as its morning host. WMCA then started experimenting with some talk programming as part of &quot;Power Radio&quot;, with hosts ranging from Domenic Quinn to countercultural Alex Bennett. The station also began playing album cuts in addition to singles, with the slogan &quot;The hits and the Heavies&quot;.

As disc jockeys left, new DJs appeared with vague names (e.g., Lee Gray was originally &quot;Lee Your Leader&quot;) and various stunts were performed. In one case, Frankie Crocker, who was lured away from WWRL as the station&#x27;s first African-American personality, played two very short songs over and over again for an hour. The &quot;Good Guys&quot; were partly reassembled, then dropped again. Even reliable Dean Anthony, who was concurrently working at a country music station, sometimes got the slogans mixed up on air.

===Talk era===
The station finally adopted a full-time talk radio format in 1970, calling itself as &quot;Dial-Log Radio&quot;. The &quot;Good Guys&quot; music era was over, although the &quot;Good Guy&quot; theme eventually did make a comeback in a promotional marketing effort.

When WMCA acquired New York Yankees baseball broadcast rights in 1971, DJ Jack Spector stayed on to host a sports talk show, while Bob Grant debuted in New York radio as the house conservative. &quot;Long John&quot; Nebel came over from WNBC in 1973 and became a fixture on overnights, accompanied by his co-host and spouse Candy Jones. Malachy McCourt hosted a Sunday night call-in show that was mostly personal reminiscences of the type that later became the subject of the bestselling autobiography &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot;, by his brother Frank McCourt.

In 1972, John Sterling succeeded Spector as sports talk host, transforming the program into one of the first confrontational sports talks shows, as well as doing play-by-play for New York Islanders hockey and New York Nets basketball games that were carried on WMCA. It was there that his knowledgeable and over-the-top broadcasting style would first be heard in the New York area. WMCA carried Yankees games until 1977. The station then held the broadcast rights for the New York Mets from 1978 through 1983.

WMCA introduced a new morning news-talk program, hosted by Ralph Howard, Bill Ryan and a team of reporters who were all referred to as the &quot;Good Guys&quot;. During the 1970s, ratings were healthy for WMCA as a talk station. Jonathan King, who had been at the top of the Good Guys chart in 1965 with his single &quot;Everyone&#x27;s Gone to the Moon&quot;, hosted the weekday midday show for a year in 1981. Most surveys showed the station in the top 10. This was before WOR became exclusively talk, and also before WABC changed to talk in the early 1980s.

The Straus family sold WMCA in 1986 for $11 million. It was the largest stand-alone AM station sale of the year, and the last family-owned radio station in New York. New owner Federal Broadcasting kept the talk format, but switched to a financial news format on weekdays between 5:00 am and 7:00 pm, just prior to selling the station in April 1989 to Salem Communications, which subsequently sold its original New York station, the original WNYM (1330 AM, now WWRV) to comply with FCC rules of the time. Salem immediately implemented a format that focused on religion and leased-time programming. At that time, all WMCA staffers were invited to apply for positions with the &quot;new&quot; WMCA. Federal Broadcasting eventually sold off all its stations and left the broadcasting business.

===Christian era===
Since September 16, 1989, WMCA has been airing a Christian talk and teaching format, as Salem Communications does in dozens of large and medium-sized cities across the U.S. Initially WMCA had the slogan &quot;New York&#x27;s Christian Radio.&quot; That later changed to &quot;New York&#x27;s Inspiring Talk.&quot; In the early 1990s, the moniker was &quot;Together, we&#x27;re sharing the moments of your day on WMCA... New York!&quot;. Salem retained just one of the on-air hosts from the talk years, financial advisor Sonny Bloch, who later ran into legal and tax problems.

WMCA was Salem&#x27;s primary religious station in New York, while the company also ran extra Christian programming on WWDJ (970 AM), which was bought by Salem in 1993. This second station was later publicly billed as &quot;WMCA II&quot; or &quot;WMCA 970&quot; until its call letters were changed to WNYM and it adopted a conservative talk radio format in 2008.

During the mid-2000s, WMCA attempted to establish a connection back to its &quot;Good Guys&quot; era. The website had a tribute to the 1960s DJs, while the current air personalities—&quot;a whole new team of &#x27;Good Guys&#x27; filling the airwaves with the Good News&quot;—made appearances and gave out an updated version of the Good Guys sweatshirt. On air, the station used its 1960s-era &quot;Good Guys&quot; jingles for station identification, program promos, and transitions between songs when music was scheduled. This ended in January 2015 when WMCA was redubbed as &quot;The Mission&quot;, a new corporate branding effort also used on other Salem Christian stations.

Under Salem ownership, WMCA served as the New York affiliate of United States Military Academy football (2016 until 2021), and previously aired Seton Hall University basketball and St. John&#x27;s University basketball; all of these teams, whose broadcasts were provided by Learfield, moved to streaming during 2021–2022. WMCA also aired a limited schedule of University at Buffalo football games in 2014 and 2015.

===Studio locations and translator===
After leaving the Hotel McAlpin in 1938, WMCA moved its studios to various locations in Midtown Manhattan, first to 1657 Broadway, in November 1955 to 415 Madison Avenue, then 888 Seventh Avenue where it remained until it was sold. Not long after taking control of WMCA in 1990, new owner Salem Communications relocated the station to New Jersey. The facilities were based in Teaneck, Rutherford, and Hasbrouck Heights at different times. In December 2013, WMCA returned to New York City. Salem moved WMCA and WNYM from Hasbrouck Heights into the former studios of WOR at 111 Broadway in lower Manhattan.

In July 18, 2019, WMCA&#x27;s programming began airing on the FM dial in Northern New Jersey, using 250-watt translator station W272DX (102.3 MHz). While it is licensed to New York City, the translator&#x27;s signal emanates from the towers of Multicultural Broadcasting-owned WPAT in Clifton, New Jersey, off the Garden State Parkway.

==Early life==
Arnett was born in Toronto, Ontario, to Edith Alexandra &quot;Alix&quot; (née Palk) and Emerson James &quot;Jim&quot; Arnett, who was a corporate lawyer and brewer, among other occupations. His parents were originally from Winnipeg, Manitoba, and he has roots on both sides of his family in Manitoba going back many generations. Arnett has two older sisters and a younger brother. His father, a graduate of Harvard University and a corporate lawyer, served as the president and CEO of Molson Breweries from 1997 to 2000.

Arnett briefly attended Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ontario, but was asked not to return after a semester for being a troublemaker. The Subway Academy II allowed him to take theatre classes at the Tarragon Theatre. He eventually graduated from Leaside High School and attended Concordia University, Montreal for a semester but dropped out. As a teenager, he was encouraged by his mother to pursue an acting career. He auditioned for commercials in Toronto and enjoyed acting. In 1990, he moved to New York City to study acting at the Lee Strasberg Theatre and Film Institute. He appeared in plays in New York, and his first acting role was in Felicity Huffman&#x27;s independent film &quot;Erie&quot;, which was filmed on the Erie Canal. As mentioned on the &quot;SmartLess&quot; podcast, Arnett is an avid hockey fan and workout enthusiast, known to often boast about his “Pro Dumper” and ability to bench press as much as 165 pounds.

==Career==
=== 1996–2002: Rise to prominence === 

In February 1996, Arnett made his first television pilot with Kevin Pollak and Pollak&#x27;s wife Lucy Webb for CBS, that was not picked up. In 1999, Arnett was in another pilot for &quot;The Mike O&#x27;Malley Show&quot; on NBC as the protagonist&#x27;s friend Jimmy. The show was picked up, but it was cancelled after two episodes. Arnett has referred to 2000, the year after that show was cancelled, as &quot;the darkest year of [his] life&quot;, and he admits that he &quot;didn&#x27;t get a lot of work&quot; and &quot;drank those years away&quot;. In summer 2000, a friend helped pull Arnett out of his battle with alcoholism, and he began to get his career back on track. In 2001, Arnett was cast in the CBS television pilot, &quot;Loomis&quot; as the slacker brother of a local news reporter (Cheri Oteri), that was not picked up. In 2002, Arnett was cast in a fourth television pilot which was for the CBS sitcom &quot;Still Standing&quot;, which was picked up and ran for several seasons, but his character was cut from the series after the pilot. Arnett became so frustrated, after his fourth failed pilot, that he &quot;swore off pilots&quot; altogether, until his agent persuaded him to audition for the pilot for &quot;Arrested Development&quot;. In 2002, prior to &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, Arnett guest-starred in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;. 

=== 2003–2013: &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and sitcom roles === 
In 2003, Arnett found mainstream success in television when he played George Oscar &quot;Gob&quot; Bluth II in the Fox comedy series &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and in 2006 he was nominated for his first Emmy. The show was cancelled after three seasons due to low ratings, despite its critical acclaim and cult following. (He played Max the Magician in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, in a nod to Gob Bluth&#x27;s penchant for using Europe&#x27;s &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; during his magic shows.) According to a 2006 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Arnett&#x27;s two favourite episodes of the show were &quot;Pier Pressure&quot; and &quot;Afternoon Delight&quot;. His exposure on &quot;Arrested Development&quot; led to a number of larger roles in feature films. Though having worked in drama, his role for &quot;Arrested Development&quot; is still comedy, and he often portrays smug antagonists. He &quot;never considered himself a comic&quot; and considers himself an &quot;actor first&quot;. In 2006, Arnett starred in his first leading role in &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to Prison&quot;, directed by Bob Odenkirk. It earned more than US$4 million at the box office and more than US$13 million in rentals. In &quot;Blades of Glory&quot;, Arnett and his then-wife Amy Poehler played brother/sister ice-skating pair with an incestuous relationship. The film was No. 1 at the U.S. box office during its first two weeks, and grossed approximately US$118 million domestically during its theatrical run. and US$36 million on home video. He guest-starred in &quot;King of the Hill&quot; and &quot;30 Rock&quot;; in the latter, he played the recurring role of Devon Banks, Jack Donaghy&#x27;s archnemesis, for which he was nominated for four Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.
Arnett&#x27;s distinctive gravelly voice has earned him voice-over work for CBS television promos, film trailers and numerous advertisements, including Lamisil medication. Perhaps most recognizable is Arnett&#x27;s voice saying, &quot;It&#x27;s not more than you need, just more than you&#x27;re used to&quot; in ads for GMC trucks. He has lent his voice to a number of television shows, such as Ghost Writer in the 2005 Nickelodeon&#x27;s series &quot;Danny Phantom&quot;, Duncan Schiesst for the Comedy Central animated program &quot;Freak Show&quot;, which was created by and stars the voice of his &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star David Cross. Arnett was the announcer for the faux trailer &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot; in the 2007 film &quot;Grindhouse&quot;, and became announcer for Cartoon Network in October 2008 during its &quot;Noods&quot; era, replacing Greg Cipes. He has voiced characters in animated films, including Vlad in &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot;, The Missing Link in &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot;, Horst the German sous-chef in &quot;Ratatouille&quot;, and Mr. Perkins in &quot;Despicable Me&quot;. He planned to be the voice of the K.I.T.T. in Universal&#x27;s &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, a sequel to the popular 1980s television series. The production featured a Ford Mustang as K.I.T.T. Since Arnett had a previous long standing relationship with competitor automaker General Motors as the voice for GMC Trucks commercials, GM asked Arnett to pull out of the project. Arnett opted to withdraw from the project and he was replaced by Val Kilmer. Arnett made a commercial cameo for the video game &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2&quot;.

In 2009, he voiced the title character in &quot;Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard&quot;, a video game developed by Vicious Cycle Software and starred as an out of work former video game protagonist hoping to make a comeback, versus a greedy game executive played by Neil Patrick Harris. In the Fox animated comedy series &quot;Sit Down, Shut Up&quot;, he voiced Ennis Hofftard, a bodybuilder who teaches English and always attempts to chase women. The show premiered on April 19, 2009, but was eventually cancelled after several months due to poor ratings. It aired its last episode on November 21, 2009.
Arnett played supporting roles in the films &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, &quot;The Comebacks&quot;, and &quot;On Broadway&quot;, where he once again worked with his close friend and director Dave McLaughlin. In &quot;The Brothers Solomon&quot;, he again teamed with Odenkirk and starred with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; member Will Forte. He appeared in a major supporting role in the basketball comedy &quot;Semi-Pro&quot;, his second film with Ferrell. He plays Lou Redwood, the commentator of the team, who is &quot;a former player, a bit of a womanizer, and a boozer&quot;. On November 17, 2009, it was announced that Arnett would try to win over real-life wife Amy Poehler in a guest spot on &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. Arnett played Chris, an MRI technician and possible love interest for Poehler&#x27;s Leslie Knope. Justin Theroux appeared in the same episode as yet another suitor. Arnett signed on for one episode, and the episode entitled &quot;The Set Up&quot; aired January 14, 2010.
In 2010, Arnett and former &quot;Arrested Development&quot; co-star Jason Bateman created DumbDumb Productions, a production company focusing on digital content. Their first video was &quot;Prom Date&quot;, the first in a series of &quot;Dirty shorts&quot; for Orbit. In March 2012, &quot;Mansome&quot;, Arnett&#x27;s first executive producer credit with Bateman, was announced as a Spotlight selection for the Tribeca Film Festival. The documentary, directed by Morgan Spurlock, is a comedic look at male identity as it is defined through men&#x27;s grooming habits featuring celebrity and expert commentary. He starred in &quot;Running Wilde&quot; which was cancelled in January 2011, due to poor ratings as well as &quot;The Increasingly Poor Decisions of Todd Margaret&quot; with David Cross. On March 23, 2011, Arnett appeared in the penultimate episode to &quot;The Office&quot; season 7. Arnett co-starred in the NBC television comedy series &quot;Up All Night&quot;, about a couple who struggle to balance their home lives (especially with their newborn child) and their work ones. He had been attached to play the lead role of David Miller in the 2013 comedy &quot;We&#x27;re the Millers&quot;, but had to pass due to scheduling; the part went to Jason Sudeikis.

=== 2014–present: &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; and &quot;SmartLess&quot; === 
He voiced the eponymous character in the critically acclaimed Netflix animated sitcom &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, which ran from 2014 to 2020. He co-starred as Vern Fenwick in the 2014 film &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; and its 2016 sequel, &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows&quot;. Arnett starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Millers&quot;, which lasted for two seasons. In 2017, Arnett was cast in the recurring role of Mr. Quagmire on the Netflix comedy drama series &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot;. In 2016, he co-created, co-wrote and starred in the Netflix original series &quot;Flaked&quot;, which received negative reviews from critics.

He reprises the role in an episode of the franchise&#x27;s spinoff animated series &quot;Unikitty!&quot; titled &quot;BatKitty&quot;, which aired days before the release of the film. He is the spokesman of a series of Hulu advertisements and his role in television spots deliberately recalls Devon Banks as a power-hungry manipulator. In July 2020, Arnett, along with Bateman and Sean Hayes, created a comedy and talk podcast called &quot;SmartLess&quot;.

In 2021, Arnett played &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;″s Dink Lockwood in a reenactment of the third season episode &quot;Kids Can Be Cruel&quot; for the third edition of &quot;Live in Front of a Studio Audience&quot;. In December 2021, it was announced that Arnett had replaced Armie Hammer in reshoots in the role of Alex Magnussen in &quot;Next Goal Wins&quot; due to abuse allegations made against Hammer in January 2021. The part, initially meant as a cameo, was expanded upon when Arnett joined.Arnett is currently set to star in &quot;Is This Thing On?&quot; alongside Bradley Cooper. Arnett will write the screenplay while Cooper will direct. &quot;Cursed Friends&quot;, a Comedy Central original movie from Arnett&#x27;s production company Electric Avenue, was announced in September 2022.

<text>Wilhelm Maria Hubertus Leibl (October 23, 1844 – December 4, 1900) was a German realist painter of portraits and scenes of peasant life.

==Biography==
Leibl was born in Cologne, where his father was the director of the Cathedral choir. He was apprenticed to a locksmith before beginning his artistic training with the local painter Hermann Becker in 1861. He entered the Munich Academy in 1864, subsequently studying with several artists including Carl Theodor von Piloty. He set up a group studio in 1869, with Johann Sperl, Theodor Alt, and Rudolf Hirth du Frênes. At about the same time, Gustave Courbet visited Munich to exhibit his work, making a considerable impression on many of the local artists by his demonstrations of alla prima painting directly from nature. Leibl&#x27;s paintings, which already reflected his admiration for the Dutch old masters, became looser in style, their subjects rendered with thickly brushed paint against dark backgrounds.

==Career==
In 1869, following Courbet&#x27;s suggestion, Leibl went to Paris, where he was introduced to Édouard Manet, but was forced to return to Germany in 1870, due to the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War. In 1873 Leibl left Munich for the isolated Bavarian countryside, where he depicted the local peasants in everyday scenes devoid of sentimentality or anecdote. The sketchlike quality of his earlier paintings was replaced by greater precision and attention to drawing. Living from 1878 to 1882 in Berbling, he painted perhaps his best-known work, the &quot;Three Women in Church&quot; (Kunsthalle, Hamburg). Its intensely realistic style recalls Hans Holbein in its clarity of definition. During the following years he moved to the town of Bad Aibling and, in 1892, to Kutterling, as his paintings united the disciplined drawing he had adopted in the 1880s with a new delicacy and luminosity.

Leibl painted without preliminary drawing, setting to work directly with color, an approach that has parallels to Impressionism. His commitment to the representation of reality as the eye sees it earned him recognition in his lifetime as the preeminent artist of a group known as the &quot;Leibl-Kreis&quot; (Leibl Circle) that included, among others, Carl Schuch, Wilhelm Trübner, Otto Scholderer, and Hans Thoma.

During the first half of the 1870s, Leibl executed a series of 19 etchings in a meticulous style. His charcoal drawings are conceived in great masses of light and shadow, blocked in as though he were using a brush and paint.

He visited the Netherlands in 1898, and his work was included in the Berlin Secession exhibition the following year. He died in Würzburg in 1900.
==Nazi-looted art==
In 2009 the German Advisory Commission for the Return of Cultural Property Seized as a Result of Nazi Persecution recommended that Leibl&#x27;s painting “Bauernmädchen ohne Hut mit weißem Halstuch” (‘Peasant Girl without a Hat and with a White Headcloth’) (1897), which had been seized by the Nazis, be restituted to the heirs of Dr. Alexander Lewin.

<text>Third Watch is an American crime drama television series created by John Wells and Edward Allen Bernero that aired on NBC from September 23, 1999, to May 6, 2005, with a total of 132 episodes spanning over six seasons. It was produced by John Wells Productions, in association with Warner Bros. Television.

The show takes place in New York City, and was filmed on location there. It stars an ensemble cast of characters, the storylines centered on the lives of police officers in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and the firefighters and Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Personnel in the New York City Fire Department (FDNY), all working the same fictional precinct during the 3:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. shift, also known as the &quot;third watch&quot;.

After the September 11 attacks hit New York in 2001, season three opened with the episode &quot;In Their Own Words&quot;, which aired on October 15, 2001, and featured interviews with real-life NYPD and FDNY members who responded to the attacks. The following episode was titled &quot;September Tenth&quot;.

==Premise==
The series followed the exploits of a group of police officers, firefighters, and paramedics in the fictional NYPD 55th Precinct and the fictional FDNY Squad 55/Ladder 100/Battalion 24 firehouse, whose shifts fell between 3 pm and 11 pm, the &quot;third watch&quot;. The precinct and fire station were located on the fictional corner of King Boulevard and Arthur Street; hence the nickname &quot;Camelot&quot;. Exterior/interior shots of the 55th Precinct and the firehouse were filmed in Long Island City, Queens, although both in the show appear to be located somewhere between the Bronx, and Midtown and Inwood in Manhattan.

&quot;Third Watch&quot; succeeded in presenting all three branches of New York City&#x27;s emergency services in the same show, reviving a failed attempt to do so nine years prior with the similarly themed &quot;H.E.L.P.&quot; The show balanced numerous single-episode events with other, ongoing storylines, some of which spanned multiple seasons. Though it gained much acclaim and eventually won an award for its emotional and honest portrayal of 9/11 and its aftermath, &quot;Third Watch&quot; was also criticized in some circles for extremely detailed violence, and extensive (by network standards) profane language. The show was created, produced, and written by John Wells and Edward Allen Bernero. The theme song for the show was &quot;Keep Hope Alive&quot; by The Crystal Method, except for the pilot episode, when &quot;Right Here, Right Now&quot; by Fatboy Slim was played during the opening sequence.

In the spring of 2005, NBC decided not to renew &quot;Third Watch&quot;, making the sixth season its last. The series&#x27; finale, &quot;Goodbye to Camelot&quot;, aired in the United States on Friday, May 6, 2005. Several major newspapers, including the &quot;New York Times&quot; and the &quot;Bergen Record&quot;, have since listed it as a TV show that was cancelled too early.

==Conception==
John Wells had wanted to do a show about paramedics for some time due to his work on &quot;ER&quot;, but did not think he had enough material to make such a show. Ed Bernero, a former Chicago cop, had wanted to do a police drama partly based on his own experiences. The two worked together on the short-lived show &quot;Trinity&quot; and, after that show was cancelled, Wells asked Bernero if he wanted to co-create a show with him.

Originally, the show was only going to be about the police and paramedics, but firefighter Jimmy Doherty was added to the show after Eddie Cibrian auditioned for the role of Bosco. Cibrian lost out to Jason Wiles, but because of the attention he received from women due to his good looks, the producers decided to put him in the show as a new character. Bernero reportedly commented that they did not have any firefighters, and the fire aspect of the show was added.

==Episodes==

The series consists of six seasons with a total of 132 episodes, produced and broadcast from September 23, 1999, to May 6, 2005.
===Crossovers===

*&quot;Unleashed&quot; — Yokas and Bosco help Dr. Susan Lewis find her drug-addicted sister and her niece, who went missing. The story begins on &quot;ER&quot; in the episode &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;.
*&quot;In the Family Way&quot; — An AWOL soldier arrested for a jewelry store robbery that left a friend of Sully&#x27;s dead contracts a virus that begins to spread. The story concludes on &quot;Medical Investigation&quot; in the episode &quot;Half-Life&quot;.

==Main cast==

&quot;Third Watch&#x27;s&quot; original ensemble cast in the series&#x27; first season consisted of Michael Beach, Coby Bell, Bobby Cannavale, Eddie Cibrian, Molly Price, Kim Raver, Anthony Ruivivar, Skipp Sudduth, and Jason Wiles.

Eddie Cibrian also portrayed the contract-role of Cole on &quot;Sunset Beach&quot; while appearing on &quot;Third Watch&quot; at the same time until &quot;Sunset Beach&quot;&#x27;s cancellation on September 17, 1999.

In 2000, Amy Carlson was added to the cast as paramedic/firefighter Alex Taylor. In 2001, series regular Bobby Cannavale willingly left the series after he asked to be written out due to lack of character use and development.

At the start of season three, Chris Bauer was added to the main credits as Fred Yokas after being a recurring guest star previously. Tia Texada became a recurring guest star, and later, a full cast member, in 2002. Carlson left the show in 2003. Later that year, Nia Long was introduced as Officer Sasha Monroe (her rank was changed in season six in one of the show&#x27;s most shocking plot twists). Yvonne Jung became a recurring guest star also in 2003, although she had been a guest in season-three episode &quot;Act Brave&quot; as a lawyer defending Kim in her custody battle with Jimmy. Also in 2003, Bonnie Dennison was added as Emily Yokas, previously being recurring.

In 2004, just after celebrating the show&#x27;s 100th episode, Eddie Cibrian and Michael Beach left the show. Cibrian&#x27;s departure marked the first time a main character was written out of the show without dying. Series regular Molly Price&#x27;s character, Faith Yokas, made very few appearances in season five of the series because Price was pregnant throughout much of the season. The writers for &quot;Third Watch&quot; explained her absence by her character being seriously injured in a shootout, and then trying to recuperate at home. In the few scenes Price was in, her growing belly was frequently hidden by blankets piled on top of her while she lay in bed. Cara Buono joined the cast as Paramedic Grace Foster late in the show&#x27;s fifth season in 2004.

Kim Raver decided to leave the show after the show&#x27;s sixth-season opener and became a series regular on &quot;24&quot;. Josh Stewart was introduced as a main cast member of season six as Probationary Officer Brendan Finney. After a several-month absence, Dennison reclaimed the role of Emily Yokas for the rest of the final season, while Chris Bauer left the show to pursue his new show &quot;Tilt&quot;, which coincidentally co-starred his former &quot;Third Watch&quot; castmate, Eddie Cibrian, but made sporadic guest-star appearances in season six. Beach, Cibrian, and Raver rejoined their former co-stars in the series finale, &quot;Goodbye To Camelot&quot;.

==Broadcast and ratings information==
All six seasons of &quot;Third Watch&quot; were originally broadcast on NBC in the United States and simulcast in Canada on CTV .

&quot;Third Watch&quot; was also broadcast worldwide including Africa, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Oceania and the Middle East.

==Home media and syndication==
Warner Home Video released Season 1 of &quot;Third Watch&quot; on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4. Season 2 was released in Region 1 on July 7, 2009. 
Music licensing issues delayed the release of the first two seasons and, as of 2023, it is unknown when or if the remaining four seasons will ever be released. However, some post-broadcast releases include episodes slightly modified, with music different from the original broadcasts.

The first three seasons of &quot;Third Watch&quot; were available for streaming on Crave TV from March 2015 until 2021.

In December 2021, The Roku Channel added all 6 seasons of &quot;Third Watch&quot; to watch for free (with the exception of Season 4, Episode 12). In December 2022, Roku stopped offering the show for streaming, only to re-add it again in late March 2023.

In February 2023, Tubi added all 6 seasons of &quot;Third Watch&quot; to watch for free. However, some users will not be able to access it depending on which country their IPN identifies as their location (it isn&#x27;t available in all countries). It is noticeable in this release that several of the songs used in the show have been changed to overcome the initial musical licensing issues.

&quot;Third Watch&quot; also aired in Syndication on A&amp;E at various times between the fall of 2002 and 2011. As of April 2023, it can be seen on HLN weeknights in a four-hour block from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM (Eastern Standard Time).

Series regular Molly Price was interviewed in a segment because she is married to real-life FDNY firefighter and &quot;Third Watch&quot; recurring guest star Derek Kelly.

Many &quot;Third Watch&quot; former cast members were nominated for awards for their work on the show. Among them, both Bobby Cannavale and Anthony Ruivivar were nominated for ALMA Awards for their positive portrayals of Latino characters. Nia Long also won several NAACP Image Awards for her portrayal of the African-American character Sasha Monroe.

<text>The Pinscher is a group of German dog breeds, developed originally as ratters on farms or as guard dogs. In the twenty-first century they are commonly kept as companion animals.

== Origins ==

It is considered that the German Pinscher is a prototypical Pinscher and one of the oldest German breeds, more closely related to the Standard Schnauzer (once known as the Wire-Haired Pinscher) than the Dobermann and other Pinschers. Since the mid-19th century, breeders stopped crossbreeding these coat types, and with the formation of the German Pinscher-Schnauzer-Club (PSK) in 1895, advanced them to distinct breed varieties.

==Etymology==
There are several theories on the etymology of the word Pinscher; that it derives from French &quot;pincer&quot;, meaning &quot;to seize&quot; and &quot;to nip&quot;, or &quot;to bite&quot; and &quot;to grip&quot; which are possibly related to their function of catching vermin on the farm, that it derives from English &quot;pinch&quot; referring to their clipped ears, &quot;fox terrier&quot; type of dog (considered that it was a descriptive term meaning &quot;settler&quot; or &quot;terrier&quot; dog method of working, and not heritage), or biter, although the verb &quot;pinch&quot; has the same early 13th century Old North French &quot;*pinchier&quot; derivation, which itself possibly originates from Vulgar Latin.

==Breeds==
The Fédération Cynologique Internationale recognizes the following pinscher breeds in Group 2, Section 1: Pinschers and Schnauzers, Section 1.1 Pinscher:
*Austrian Pinscher (Österreichischer Pinscher, no. 64)
*Dobermann (no. 143)
*German Pinscher (Deutscher Pinscher, no. 184)
*Miniature Pinscher (Zwergpinscher, no. 185)
*Affenpinscher (no. 186)

Provisional:
*Danish-Swedish Farmdog (Dansk-svensk gårdshund, no. 356)
*In addition, the Harlequin Pinscher was earlier accepted by the FCI, but it was officially removed after its extinction.

There may be other related hunting dogs called &quot;pinscher&quot; that are not recognized breeds. In addition, individual breeders often attempt the creation of new breeds which they may call pinschers. One example of these is the Carlin Pinscher, which has been developed by crossing the Pug with the Miniature Pinscher, or other similar breeds. There are a very large number of sporting clubs, breed clubs, and internet-based breed registries and businesses in which dogs may be registered under whatever name the owner or seller wishes.

<text>Christian Olsson (born 25 January 1980) is a former Swedish athlete competing in high jump and triple jump. He won an Olympic gold medal, one gold and one silver medal in the World Championships and two gold medals in the European Championships as well as a further two golds in the World Indoor championships. He also won the overall IAAF Golden League jackpot in 2004 where he cashed in 500,000 US dollars (after splitting the million dollar pot with Tonique Williams-Darling).

From 2007 to his retirement in 2012, he was beset by injuries which left him largely on the sidelines and unable to compete at top level competitions.

==Biography==
Olsson was born in Gothenburg, and made his international breakthrough in 2001 when he won silver at the 2001 World Championships in Athletics. He has the Swedish national record outdoors, 17.79 m (2004 Summer Olympics), and the Swedish national record indoors, 17.83 m (2004). Olsson has won the Swedish Championships seven times, and has also competed successfully on national level in high jumping.

On 7 March 2004, at the 2004 World Indoor Championships in Athletics, he jumped 17.83 m and matched the World Record. On 23 August 2004, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, he jumped 17.79 m, broke the national record and won the gold medal as the first Swede since Gustaf Lindblom in 1912, 92 years earlier. Four of his six jumps were longer than the silver medalist&#x27;s best jump.

With the Olympic Gold he completed a rare international sweep, having the Olympic, World Indoor, Outdoor, Regional (European) Indoor and Outdoor titles.

Olsson first became interested in triple jump after watching Jonathan Edwards set the world record at the World Championships in his hometown Gothenburg. Since 1999, Olsson has been trained by Yannick Tregaro. Before that, Olsson was trained by Viljo Nousiainen.

During the autumn and winter 2004/2005 he injured his foot (an injury originating from the 2004 Olympic Final), preventing him from being able to do triple-jumping at full speed. Unfortunately the injury healed very slowly, and it was still in January 2006 hampering him. In his first competition after the injury, in June 2006, he jumped 17.09 and seem to be back into shape.
A month later he won the gold medal at European Championships in his hometown Gothenburg, with a jump of 17.67 m.

At the beginning of the 2007 indoor season, Olsson was injured yet again, and was unable to compete at the European indoor championships.

Olsson returned to competition in June at the IAAF Golden League event in Oslo, jumping 17.33 m. In July, he won Golden League event in Paris with 17.56 m. At the Golden League event in Rome, he retired after the second round due to a cramp.

Olsson went to the 2007 World Championships in Athletics but had to pull out before the competition due to an injury during training.

After almost one year of rehabilitation, he returned to competition in July 2008 at the annual event in Stockholm, &quot;DN Galan&quot;, but had to pull out due to injury. Afterwards, he announced that he would not compete anymore during the 2008 season; hence he would not participate in the Beijing Olympics. He also suggested that he might retire from the sport. Upon a request from the Swedish Olympic team, Olsson agreed to carry the Swedish flag during the opening ceremony.

In July 2009, Olsson made a comeback in a minor event arranged by Örgryte IS in Gothenburg. He then jumped 17.24 m.

On 3 August 2009 Olsson competed in Swedish Championships in Malmö. He won the competition with a jump at 16.72 m. This was the first competition Olsson failed to reach 17 m or more since he jumped in a competition in Birmingham in 2003.

On 14 May 2012, Olsson ultimately declared his intentions to retire from professional triple jump competitions.

Christian Olsson lives with his family in Lindome, south of Göteborg.

<doc id="921570" wikidata="Q230203" url="?curid=921570" title="Amy Poehler">
<text>Amy Poehler ( ; born September 16, 1971) is an American actress and comedian. After studying improv at Chicago&#x27;s Second City and ImprovOlympic in the early 1990s, Poehler joined the improvisational-comedy troupe Upright Citizens Brigade in 1995. The group moved to New York City in 1996, where their act became a half-hour sketch-comedy series on Comedy Central in 1998. Along with other members of the comedy group, Poehler is a founder of the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre.

In 2001, Poehler joined the NBC sketch comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) as a cast member. From 2004 until 2008, she served as co-anchor of the show&#x27;s news parody segment, &quot;Weekend Update&quot;. Poehler left &quot;SNL&quot; halfway through her eighth season to star as Leslie Knope in the sitcom &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, which she produced and starred in until 2015.

Poehler served as an executive producer on the television series &quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot;, &quot;Broad City&quot;, &quot;Difficult People&quot;, &quot;Duncanville&quot;, &quot;Three Busy Debras&quot;, and &quot;Russian Doll&quot;. She frequently collaborated with Tina Fey on &quot;SNL&quot; and later acted with her in the feature films &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004), &quot;Baby Mama&quot; (2008), &quot;Sisters&quot; (2015), and &quot;Wine Country&quot; (2019). Fey and Poehler hosted the Golden Globe Awards four times in the years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2021. Poehler also provided voice acting roles for the animated films &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008), &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; (2009), &quot;Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil&quot; (2011), &quot;Free Birds&quot; (2013), and the &quot;Inside Out&quot; franchise (2015–present).

In 2015, Poehler received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to television. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Television Musical or Comedy Series in 2014 and a Critics&#x27; Choice Award for Best Actress in a Comedy Series in 2012. She and Fey won the 2016 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for co-hosting &quot;SNL&quot;.

==Early life, family and education==
Poehler was born in Newton, Massachusetts, to school teachers Eileen and William Poehler. Poehler credits her father with encouraging her to break social protocols and take risks. She has one younger brother, Greg, who is also a producer and actor. Poehler&#x27;s ancestry is Irish, along with German, Portuguese, and English; her Irish roots originate from County Sligo and County Cork. Her great-grandmother immigrated from Nova Scotia, Canada to Boston in the late 1800s. She was raised as a Catholic.

Poehler grew up in nearby Burlington, Massachusetts, which she describes as a blue-collar town. Her favorite performers and influences included sketch comedians Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, and Catherine O&#x27;Hara. When she was ten years old, Poehler played Dorothy Gale in her school&#x27;s production of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. The experience inspired Poehler&#x27;s love of performing. Poehler continued acting in school plays at Burlington High School. She also participated in other activities during her time in high school including student council, soccer, and softball.

After graduating from high school in 1989, she enrolled at Boston College. During college, Poehler became a member of the improv comedy troupe My Mother&#x27;s Fleabag. She graduated from Boston College with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in media and communications in 1993.

==Career==

===Improv and Upright Citizens Brigade===
Poehler&#x27;s time studying improv in college inspired her to pursue comedy professionally. After graduating from college, she moved to Chicago, where she took her first improv class, taught by Charna Halpern at ImprovOlympic. Early on, Poehler worked as a waitress and at other jobs to earn money. Through ImprovOlympic, Poehler learned from Del Close, and she was introduced to friend and frequent collaborator Tina Fey. Poehler and Fey joined a Second City touring company at the same time, and Poehler went on to join one of Second City&#x27;s main companies where Fey was her eventual replacement.

The Upright Citizens Brigade (UCB) formed as a sketch and improv group in Chicago in 1991. Early members included Horatio Sanz, Adam McKay, Ian Roberts, Neil Flynn, and Matt Besser, although the membership was not static. McKay left the fledgling group in 1995 and Poehler became his replacement. In 1996, a core group of four UCB members, Poehler, Besser, Roberts, and Matt Walsh, moved to New York City. The &quot;UCB Four&quot; began performing shows at small venues around the city which evolved into four regular live shows after a few months. To earn money outside of the shows, UCB taught improv classes. Poehler also started making appearances on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;, often playing her recurring role as Andy Richter&#x27;s younger sister, Stacy.

In 1998, Comedy Central debuted UCB&#x27;s eponymous half-hour sketch-comedy series. During the show&#x27;s second season, the group founded an improv theater/training center in New York City on West 22nd Street, occupying the space of a former strip club. The UCB Theatre held shows seven nights a week, in addition to offering classes in sketch-comedy writing and improv. In the summer of 2000, Comedy Central canceled the Upright Citizens Brigade program after its third season, although the UCB Theatre continued to operate. Poehler, Besser, Roberts, and Walsh are considered the founders of UCB and have been credited with popularizing long-form improv in New York. By 2011, UCB had two theaters in New York and a theater in Los Angeles with 8,000 students taking classes per year.

===&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;===

==== Cast member ====

Poehler joined the cast of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; (&quot;SNL&quot;) at the start of the 2001–2002 season, after Tina Fey had tried to recruit her for &quot;SNL&quot; for years. Poehler made her debut in the first episode produced after the 9/11 attacks. She was promoted from featured player to full cast member in her first season on the show, making her the second cast member, and first woman, to earn this distinction. Poehler&#x27;s recurring characters included hyperactive ten-year old Kaitlyn, one-legged reality show contestant Amber, and Bronx Beat talk show co-host Betty Caruso. In addition to her original characters, Poehler performed a number of impressions, including Hillary Clinton, Dakota Fanning, Avril Lavigne, Michael Jackson, Kim Jong-Il, Nancy Grace, Kelly Ripa, Katie Couric, Sharon Stone, Sharon Osbourne, Julia Roberts, Britney Spears, Madonna, Paula Abdul, Courteney Cox, Dolly Parton, Dennis Kucinich, Ann Coulter, Nancy Grace, Pamela Anderson, Christian Siriano, Rosie Perez, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Martha Stewart, Anna Nicole Smith, Paula Zahn, Norah O&#x27;Donnell, Lindsay Lohan, Marcia Cross and Farrah Fawcett.

Beginning with the 2004–2005 season, she co-anchored &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with Tina Fey, replacing Jimmy Fallon. Fey and Poehler became the first team of female co-anchors of the longtime &quot;SNL&quot; staple. Poehler, Fey, and Maya Rudolph were among the show&#x27;s biggest stars that season and contributed to a shift in the show to featuring more female driven sketches. When Fey left after the 2005–2006 season to devote time to the sitcom she created, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, Seth Meyers joined Poehler at the &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor desk. In 2008, Poehler was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, the first year &quot;SNL&quot; cast members were eligible for the category.

The &quot;SNL&quot; premiere of the 2008–2009 season opened with Fey and Poehler as Sarah Palin and Hillary Clinton, respectively discussing sexism in political campaigning. The sketch, which Poehler co-wrote with Meyers, became the biggest viral video of the year. Days after the season premiere, NBC announced Poehler, pregnant with her first child, would not return after her upcoming maternity leave. On the October 25 episode, Meyers announced during &quot;Weekend Update&quot; that Poehler was in labor. At the end of &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, special guest Maya Rudolph and cast member Kenan Thompson sang a custom rendition of &quot;Can&#x27;t Take My Eyes Off You&quot; for Poehler. Poehler had been rehearsing for that week&#x27;s show until the day before the birth.

After giving birth, Poehler appeared during a pre-taped &quot;&quot;SNL&quot; Presidential Bash &#x27;08&quot; prime time special on November 3. Despite the prior announcement that Poehler would not return after her maternity leave, she came back for two more live episodes. During the December 13 &quot;Weekend Update&quot; Poehler announced that it was her last show. &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; aired a special, &quot;The Best of Amy Poehler&quot;, in April 2009. For the 2008–2009 season finale, Poehler returned to co-host &quot;Weekend Update&quot; and joined host Will Ferrell&#x27;s version of the Billy Joel song &quot;Goodnight Saigon&quot;.

Off camera, Poehler was a prolific writer. She often collaborated with writer Emily Spivey. Meyers described Poehler as &quot;the most generous laugher&quot; during sketch read-throughs. Poehler would also take it upon herself to welcome guest hosts during rehearsals and try to make them feel comfortable during their stint on &quot;SNL&quot;.

==== Guest appearances ====
Although she had already left &quot;SNL&quot;, Poehler joined Meyers in September 2009 for two episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live Weekend Update Thursday&quot;, which aired in prime time and led directly into &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;. She returned to &quot;SNL&quot; along with other past female cast members for a special Mother&#x27;s Day episode on May 8, 2010, hosted by Betty White. Poehler returned again to host the 2010–2011 season premiere with musical guest Katy Perry. She participated in another &quot;SNL&quot; prime time special, &quot;The Women of SNL&quot; in November of that year. Poehler also returned sporadically for appearances on &quot;Weekend Update&quot; with Meyers, as well as in sketches when Jimmy Fallon (2011) and Maya Rudolph (2012) hosted.

In 2015, during the &quot;Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special&quot;, she returned to anchor &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, this time with Fey and Jane Curtin.

===&quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;===
Following the success of &quot;The Office&quot;, NBC ordered a new series from producers Greg Daniels and Michael Schur. In July 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Poehler was in final negotiations to star in the still untitled series from Daniels and Schur. Poehler and Schur were friends from their time together at &quot;SNL&quot;, where Schur worked as a writer. Signing Poehler, who was pregnant with her first child, meant the new series would have to forgo a promised post-Super Bowl debut and cut its first season short, but Daniels and Schur chose to push back the series for Poehler. On July 21, 2008, NBC announced Poehler&#x27;s new series, &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, saying the project would not be a direct spin-off of &quot;The Office&quot;, as previously speculated.

&quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; premiered on NBC on April 9, 2009, at 8:30 pm between two episodes of &quot;The Office&quot;. An ensemble cast including Aziz Ansari, Rashida Jones, Chris Pratt, Aubrey Plaza, Paul Schneider, and Nick Offerman joined Poehler. Poehler played deputy director of the Parks Department Leslie Knope in the fictional city of Pawnee, Indiana. After the first season had received a mixed reception, the show&#x27;s second season received more positive reviews. One key change between seasons one and two was to distinguish the character of Leslie from Michael Scott, the central character of &quot;The Office&quot;. &quot;Parks&quot; decidedly down-played Leslie&#x27;s ditziness from the first season and emphasized her intelligence, work ethic, and earnest nature instead. A second-season episode, &quot;Galentine&#x27;s Day&quot;, included a new holiday Leslie created celebrating female friendship on February 13. Galentine&#x27;s Day has since transcended the show with real-life celebrations.

Adam Scott and Rob Lowe joined the show at the end of the second season, with Scott playing Leslie&#x27;s eventual husband, Ben Wyatt. At the end of filming the second season, Poehler was once again pregnant. The show began producing the first six episodes of season three without a break to accommodate her pregnancy. Poehler was nominated again for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy in 2011. That same year, the show won a Peabody Award for &quot;developing a hilarious venue to explore the good side of American democracy in an age when that side is so rarely on display.&quot; The show was a success with critics, but its future was still uncertain. Two episodes were written that could serve as series finales if it was cancelled, including the mid-season episode where Leslie and Ben get married. The show was ultimately renewed for a sixth season in May 2013. Poehler was nominated for an Emmy Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy in 2013 for her work in season five. Season six included the show&#x27;s 100th episode, &quot;Second &quot;, co-written by Poehler and Schur. In 2014, she won the Golden Globe for Best Actress in a Television Series – Comedy at the 71st Golden Globe Awards, which she co-hosted with Tina Fey. In the middle of season six, Poehler and Schur decided that it felt like the right time to plan the end of the show. They met with representatives from NBC, who agreed. The show was renewed for a final thirteen-episode season. Poehler and Schur co-wrote the final episode of the series, &quot;One Last Ride&quot;, which aired on February 24, 2015.
By season 5, in addition to starring on &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, Poehler was also a producer. Behind the scenes, Poehler started a tradition of inviting the show cast and crew to a group dinner the last night of any location shoot. Poehler would start impromptu dance parties in the makeup trailer on set. Poehler wrote several episodes throughout the series, starting with the season two episode &quot;Telethon&quot;. Other episodes she penned include &quot;The Fight&quot; (season three), &quot;The Debate&quot; (season four), &quot;Second Chunce&quot; (season six), and the finale &quot;One Last Ride&quot;. Producer Dan Goor praised Poehler&#x27;s writing as &quot;exceptionally good&quot; and theorized, &quot;[i]f Amy Poehler submitted a blind script to any staff, she would be hired.&quot; Poehler&#x27;s writing of &quot;The Debate&quot; was recognized with nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and the Writers Guild of America Award for Television: Episodic Comedy. In addition to writing &quot;The Debate&quot;, Poehler also directed the episode. Additionally, she directed the episodes &quot;Article Two&quot; (season five) and &quot;Gryzzlbox&quot; (season seven).

=== Golden Globe Awards ===
Poehler and Fey co-hosted the Golden Globe Awards ceremony for the first time in 2013. The program was watched by 20 million viewers, a 17 percent increase over the previous year. The pair co-hosted again in 2014 as part of a three-year contract. Gilbert Cruz of &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote: &quot;They killed it last year with their opening monologue and they did so again this year.&quot; The 2014 show garnered its highest ratings in ten years.

Before the 2015 Golden Globes, Poehler confirmed it would likely be the last time she and Fey hosted. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote afterward that the pair &quot;left no superstar unscathed during their riotous opening monologue&quot; in which they &quot;casually roasted the assembled masses&quot;. At the 2020 Television Critics Association winter press tour, NBC announced Poehler and Fey would host the Golden Globes again in 2021. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Poehler and Fey hosted the Golden Globes from separate locations with Poehler in Los Angeles and Fey in New York City.

===&quot;Making It&quot;===

In March 2017, NBC ordered to series a Poehler-produced crafting series, then-titled &quot;The Handmade Project&quot;. The show, retitled &quot;Making It&quot;, debuted on NBC in July 2018 with Poehler and her &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; co-star Nick Offerman as co-hosts. The debut episode tied for the highest-rated premiere of summer 2018 and earned Poehler and Offerman a Primetime Emmy Nomination for Outstanding Host for a Reality or Competition Program. The show returned for a second season which aired in December 2019. NBC has picked up &quot;Making It&quot; for a third season.

===Film===
In 1999, Poehler had a small role in the movie &quot;Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo&quot;. The following year, she was cast in the film &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;. &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot; was the first film from David Wain, who cast Poehler based on her work with Upright Citizen&#x27;s Brigade. The film, which cost only $1.8 million to make, was not a success initially when it was released in 2001. It gained a following after its release on DVD. Poehler also appeared in the 2004 movie &quot;Mean Girls&quot;, written by Tina Fey. Fey wrote the role of self-described &quot;cool mom&quot; with Poehler in mind; however, Fey and director Mark Waters had to push for Poehler&#x27;s casting. The studio had been wary of casting too many &quot;SNL&quot; cast members and were concerned that Poehler was too young to play the mother of Rachel McAdams, who is only seven years younger than her. Poehler filmed the role in Toronto during the week while filming &quot;SNL&quot;. The movie grossed $129 million at the box office worldwide and saw its popularity continue to rise after its release on DVD.

In 2008, she starred in &quot;Baby Mama&quot;, which reunited her with Tina Fey. Poehler plays trashy Angie Ostrowiski, who is hired by Fey&#x27;s Kate to be her child&#x27;s surrogate mother. The film opened on April 25, 2008, and was the number one movie at the box office in its opening weekend. The film went on to gross over $60 million at the U.S. box office. Poehler and Fey also co-starred in the movie &quot;Sisters&quot; (2015). Other film credits include: &quot;Envy&quot; (2004), &quot;Southland Tales&quot; (2006), &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot; (2006), &quot;Blades of Glory&quot; (2007), &quot;Mr. Woodcock&quot; (2007), &quot;Hamlet 2&quot; (2008), &quot;Spring Breakdown&quot; (2009), &quot;A.C.O.D.&quot; (2013), and &quot;They Came Together&quot; (2014) and &quot;The House&quot; (2017).

Poehler has also voiced several characters in animated films. Her voice-over credits include: &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; (2007), &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008), &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel&quot;, &quot;Monsters vs. Aliens&quot; (both 2009), &quot;Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil&quot; (2011), &quot;Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked&quot; (2011), &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot; (2012), &quot;Free Birds&quot; and &quot;Inside Out&quot; (2015). In Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out&quot;, Poehler provides the voice for the main character, Joy, an emotion living inside an 11-year-old girl. Poehler also received a screen credit for writing some of Joy&#x27;s dialogue. The film has a 98% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes and went on to gross $857 million worldwide. Poehler reprised her role as Joy in &quot;Inside Out 2&quot;, released on June 14, 2024.

=== Director ===
Poehler made her film directorial debut with &quot;Wine Country&quot;, which premiered on Netflix on May 10, 2019. She also stars in the film, along with Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer, Paula Pell, and Emily Spivey. The screenplay is loosely based on a real trip the actresses took together to Napa Valley. Poehler directed the film adaptation of the 2017 novel &quot;Moxie&quot; by Jennifer Mathieu, also for Netflix, which was released on March 3, 2021.

In 2022, Poehler directed &quot;Lucy and Desi&quot;, a documentary film about the lives and relationship of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. The film premiered on January 21, 2022, at the Sundance Film Festival and was released worldwide on Amazon Prime Video on March 4, 2022. The film includes home audio recordings of Ball and Arnaz that had not before been made public as well as interviews with their two children, Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill and Desi Arnaz Jr., Lucy&#x27;s brother Fred Ball, Carol Burnett, Bette Midler and Norman Lear, among others. The film was well received, with a 94% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Poehler was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Documentary/Nonfiction Program. The film was nominated for a total of six Emmy Awards, winning two.

=== Producer ===
In 2001, Poehler set up her own production company, Paper Kite Productions, which is part of Universal Television. As of 2019, the production company&#x27;s staff is all female. To describe her success as a producer, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; called Poehler &quot;a powerful arbiter of sophisticated comedy.&quot;

Poehler co-created, produced, and starred in an animated series for Nickelodeon titled &quot;The Mighty B!&quot;, about Bessie Higgenbottom, a &quot;sweet, merit-badge-obsessed girl scout&quot;. The character of Bessie was inspired by a character Poehler performed doing improv. Season 1 averaged 3.1 million viewers and ranked as one of the top five animated programs in television. Nickelodeon renewed the show for a second season. In 2009 and 2010, Poehler earned Daytime Emmy Award nominations for Outstanding Performer in an Animated Program.

She has been an executive producer on series such as &quot;Difficult People&quot; and &quot;Broad City&quot;. In 2014, Hulu ordered the comedy &quot;Difficult People&quot;, as the streaming service&#x27;s first ever scripted series. Starring Billy Eichner and Julie Klausner, &quot;Difficult People&quot; ran for three seasons. &quot;Broad City&quot; grew out of a web series starring Abbi Jacobson and Ilana Glazer. Jacobson and Glazer used their connections at UCB to approach Poehler about starring in the finale of their web series. Poehler agreed to appear in it and then joined Jacobson and Glazer to executive produce a television series. After initially selling a script to FX, the project ultimately landed at Comedy Central where it aired for five years until its 2019 series finale. Poehler appeared in the Season 1 finale.

&quot;Welcome to Sweden&quot; is a Swedish sitcom that premiered in March 2014, and began airing on NBC in the United States three months later. It is based on the experiences of Greg Poehler, who moved with his girlfriend to her native country of Sweden in 2006. The series was canceled by NBC on July 28, 2015, after two seasons due to low ratings. Amy Poehler makes cameo appearances in multiple episodes as herself as a celebrity client of her brother&#x27;s character, a former New York tax accountant. She is also co-executive producer with him.

Poehler, along with Natasha Lyonne and Leslye Headland, created and executive produced the comedy-drama series &quot;Russian Doll&quot; for Netflix. The series premiered on February 1, 2019. The genesis of the series started seven years earlier after Poehler remarked Lyonne was always &quot;the oldest girl in the world.&quot; Poehler and Lyonne liked the idea of a female character being many things at once but joked the only way to have a female character that complex would be to re-do the part repeatedly. The idea evolved into the series where Lyonne&#x27;s character dies repeatedly on her 36th birthday. Poehler, Lyonne, and Headland put together an all-female team of writers and directors. The series debuted on Netflix with a 100% fresh rating on the ratings aggregate website &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot;. As of December 28, 2020, the rating remained at 97%.

In June 2016, BBC America announced it is developing a scripted series called &quot;Zero Motivation&quot;. The project is being executive produced by Brooke Posch and Poehler.

In September 2008, Poehler, Meredith Walker, and Amy Miles founded &quot;Smart Girls at the Party&quot;, an online community and digital web series aimed at empowering girls. The first season premiered online on November 17, 2008, with Mattel&#x27;s Barbie signed on as the lead sponsor. &quot;Smart Girls at the Party&quot; returned in 2012 as part of the YouTube Original Channel Initiative that focused upon the creation of new content. The new &quot;Smart Girls at the Party&quot; YouTube Channel went live on July 2, 2012, including new episodes of the series along with additional shows by Poehler, Walker, and Miles.

Poehler&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Yes Please&quot;, was published on October 28, 2014. She explained in a promotional interview with National Public Radio (NPR) that she was &quot;used to writing in characters and not really writing about myself... it was easier to share the early parts of my life rather than my own current events.&quot; Topics covered in the book include body image, parenthood, and learning about the limitations of physical appearance. The book debuted at number one on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

In 2011, Poehler was included on &quot;Time&quot;″s &quot;100 most influential people in the world&quot;. She also delivered the Class Day address to Harvard University&#x27;s class of 2011.

Poehler wrote a chapter in the &quot;Beastie Boys Book&quot; that reviews 17 of the group&#x27;s music videos. In the chapter, Poehler states, &quot;Beastie Boys mean a great deal to me.

<text>Outside France, the island of Corsica is perhaps best known musically for its polyphonic choral tradition. The rebirth of this genre was linked with the rise of Corsican nationalism in the 1970s. The anthem of Corsica is &quot;Dio vi Salvi Regina&quot;.

Every June, Calvi is home to an International Jazz Festival and in September there are the annual Rencontres de Chants Polyphoniques.

== Folk music ==

===Dance===
There are two dances of ancient origin found in Corsica: the caracolu, a women&#x27;s funeral dance, and the moresca, illustrating the struggle between Moors and Christians. These days, they&#x27;re not danced anymore. Traditional dances like the &quot;quatriglia&quot; (quadrille) or the &quot;scuttiscia&quot; (Scottish) have known some kind of revival over the last twenty years, groups like &quot;Diana di L&#x27;alba&quot; and &quot;Dopu Cena&quot; recorded the music and the associations &quot;Tutti in Piazza&quot; and &quot;Ochju à Ochju&quot; animate dance nights and teach as well. The granitula, a spiral procession, is still performed by the confraternities on Good Friday.

===Monophonic song===
The oldest vocal forms include such monophonic forms as voceri (sing. voceru) laments for the dead usually improvised by women; bandits&#x27; laments; laments for animals; lullabies; songs of departure; tribbiere (sing. tribbiera) or threshing songs); songs of mule-drivers; chjam&#x27; è rispondi (‘call and response’, a contest in improvised poetry); the currente (e.g. greeting guests; these have a distinctive fiddle accompaniment) and the cuntrastu (an exchange between a young man and woman).

=== Polyphonic song ===
Polyphonic songs (pulifunie) in Corsica are a cappella, and can be either spiritual or secular. Hymns, motets, and funereal songs (lamentu) are an example of the former, while the nanna (lullaby) and the paghjella are examples of the latter. Traditionally, 4 to 6-voice improvised polyphony was sung only by men, with the exception of the voceru (sung only by women) and cuntrastu (usually 2-voice) and nanne often sung by women. Brotherhoods of polyphonic singers (cunfraternita) remain, some dating back to the 12th century. Corsica&#x27;s current tradition of improvised vocal polyphony is more recent, dating to 15th century. It is traced to renaissance practice of falsobordone and the Genoese tradition of Trallalero.

The tradition of Corsican polyphonic singing had nearly become extinct until its revival (&quot;riaquistu&quot;) in the 1970s. It is now a central part of Corsican national identity, and is sometimes linked with political agitation for autonomy or independence.

Some popular modern groups include I Chjami Aghjalesi, the Palatini, A Filetta, Terra, Voce di Corsica, Alte Voce, Barbara Furtuna, Vaghjime, Cinqui So&#x27;, all-female Donnisulana, Les Nouvelles Polyphonies Corses, Tavagna, Canta u Populu Corsu, I Muvrini, and Ployphonies Corses Sarocchi. The region of Balagne has emerged as a hot spot for Corsican music, producing groups like U Fiatu Muntese.

=== World music market ===
One style of Corsican polyphonic singing that was particularly associated with Corsican nationalism and the 1970s resurgence of traditional Corsican music was &quot;paghjella,&quot; which had previously only survived in villages in the interior of the island. &quot;Paghjella&quot; traditionally consisted of three voices - known as &quot;bassu,&quot; &quot;secunda,&quot; and &quot;terza&quot; - phrasing polyphonic melodic lines, and typically involved staggered entrances by the three voices and heavy use of the Picardy Third.

In the late 1980s, owing to the growth in popularity of so-called World Music - especially the success of the Bulgarian polyphonic choral recordings of the album Le Mystère des Voix Bulgares - Corsican artists such as Voce di Corsica began to record music for the international market. Attempts to appeal to this market had a major effect on Corsican music. Ethnomusicologist Caroline Bithell describes some of these changes, saying that &quot;paghjella&quot; recordings began to shift from a more polyphonic sound to a more &quot;homophonic sound where the emphasis is on the effect created by the sum of the voices,&quot; as opposed to earlier examples of &quot;paghjella,&quot; &quot;where the individual voices and melodic lines are far more clearly differentiated and behave more independently.&quot; Additionally, younger singers may have a tendency to exaggerate use of elements considered by outside music consumers to be &quot;typically Corsican,&quot; such as heavy use of melisma. Despite the changes initiated by interaction with the world music market, Bithell argues that Corsica can also be seen as &quot;one of the success stories, in musical terms, of an era where there are tales aplenty of once unique and flourishing musical cultures threatening to disappear forever,&quot; and that partly as a result of commercial recordings, &quot;indigenous music has been pulled from the brink of the grave and grown to take its place as a national emblem.&quot;

Corsican traditional music, however, does not necessarily fit the typical definition of &quot;world music&quot;, as it is generally recorded on the island of Corsica, difficult to find and listen to outside of Corsica, and not concerned with sounding &quot;suited to the disco floor&quot;. Corsican traditional music also does not fit the typical definition of &quot;folk music&quot;, as there is not a clear definition between &quot;educated exponents of the tradition and the great majority of local people&quot;- that is, the Corsican musical tradition has remained a part of everyday life.

=== Traditional instruments ===
* Caramusa - a bagpipe made of wood, leather and reed
* Cetera - a cittern of 4 to 8 double strings that is of Tuscan origin and dates back to the Renaissance, is the most iconic Corsican traditional instrument. Its most prominent exponent is Roland Ferrandi (also a lutenist).
* Cialamedda (also &quot;cialamella&quot;/&quot;cialambella&quot;) - formerly a reed instrument, more recently with a wooden box body
* Mandulina - a mandolin
* Pirula - a reed recorder
* Pifana (also &quot;pivana&quot;) - a type of gemshorn generally made from a goat horn
* Riberbula - related to the jaw harp
* Sunaglieri - mule bells
* Timpanu - a triangle
* Urganettu - a diatonic accordion
* Cassella - Percussion with small sticks on a goatskin stretched over a sieve.
