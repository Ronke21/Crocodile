<text>Yorkville is a neighbourhood and former village in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is roughly bounded by Bloor Street to the south, Davenport Road to the north, Yonge Street to the east and Avenue Road to the west, and it is part of The Annex neighbourhood. Established as a separate community in 1830, it was annexed into Toronto in 1883. Yorkville comprises residential areas, office space, and retail shopping.

The Mink Mile shopping district on Bloor Street is located in Yorkville.

==History==
Yorkville was funded in 1830 by the entrepreneur Joseph Bloor (after whom Bloor Street, one of Toronto&#x27;s main thoroughfares, is named) and William Botsford Jarvis of Rosedale and began as a residential suburb. Bloore operated a brewery northeast of today&#x27;s Bloor and Church Street intersection, and Jarvis was Sheriff of the Home District. The two purchased land in the Yorkville area and subdivided it into smaller lots on new side streets for those interested in living in the cleaner air outside York.

The political centre of Yorkville was the Red Lion Hotel, an inn that was regularly used as the polling place for elections. It is there that William Lyon Mackenzie was voted back into the Legislature for 1832, and a huge procession took him down Yonge Street.

The community grew enough to be connected in 1849 by an omnibus service to Toronto. By 1853, the population of Yorkville had reached 1,000, the figure needed to incorporate as a village, and the &quot;Village of Yorkville&quot; was incorporated. Development increased and by the 1870s, &quot;Potter&#x27;s Field,&quot; a cemetery stretching east of Yonge Street along the north side of Concession Road (today&#x27;s Bloor Street) was closed, and the remains moved to the Toronto Necropolis and Mount Pleasant Cemetery.


By the 1880s, the cost of delivering services to the large population of Yorkville was beyond the Village&#x27;s ability. It petitioned the Toronto government to be annexed. Annexation came on February 1, 1883, and Yorkville&#x27;s name changed officially from the &quot;Village of Yorkville&quot; to &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Ward,&quot; and the former &quot;Yorkville Town Hall&quot; became &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s Hall.&quot;

The character of the suburb did not change, and its Victorian-style homes, residential streets, and gardens survived into the 20th century. In 1923, Toronto Hebrew Maternity and Convalescent Hospital was opened at 100 Yorkville Avenue, and a year later, its name was changed to Mount Sinai Hospital. The facade of the building still stands today and housed the retailer Chanel.

In the 1960s, Yorkville flourished as Toronto&#x27;s bohemian cultural centre. It was the breeding ground for some of Canada&#x27;s most noted musical talents, including Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, and Gordon Lightfoot, as well as then-underground literary figures such as Margaret Atwood, Gwendolyn MacEwen, and Dennis Lee. Yorkville was also known as the Canadian center of the hippie movement. In 1968, the nearby Rochdale College at the University of Toronto was opened on Bloor Street as an experiment in counterculture education. Those influenced by their time in 1960s-1970s Yorkville include the cyberpunk writer William Gibson.

Yorkville&#x27;s domination by hippies and young people led MPP Syl Apps to refer to it as &quot;a festering sore in the middle of the city&quot; and call for its &quot;eradication.&quot; Joni Mitchell captured a colorful impression of the nightlife scene on Yorkville Avenue in her song &quot;Night in the City.&quot; The hippie scene was also depicted in the National Film Board of Canada documentary &quot;Christopher&#x27;s Movie Matinée&quot; in 1968.

After the construction of the Bloor-Danforth subway, the value of land nearby increased, as higher densities were allowed by the City&#x27;s official plan. Along Bloor Street, office towers and The Bay and the Holt Renfrew department stores displaced the local retail. As real estate values increased, the residential homes north of Bloor along Yorkville were converted into high-end retail, including art galleries, fashion boutiques, antique stores, bars, cafes, and eateries along Cumberland Street and Yorkville Avenue. Many smaller buildings were demolished and offices and hotels were built in the 1970s, with high-priced condominium developments being built in subsequent decades.

==Demographics==


==Attractions==


===Shopping and commerce===
The Mink Mile shopping district is located on Bloor Street and includes office buildings with retail stores in the bottom one or two floors. The main streets of Avenue Road and Bay Street north of Bloor are similarly developed. North of Bloor, on Yorkville and Cumberland streets, between the main arteries, the character changes to smaller buildings containing art galleries, first-floor retail, and restaurants. Further north still are single-family detached and semi-detached homes dating to the 19th century.

Yorkville has shopping, restaurants, Yorkville Village mall, and the first five-star hotel in Canada. Hotels in include the InterContinental Toronto Yorkville, Four Seasons Toronto, Park Hyatt Toronto, Hazelton Hotel, Windsor Arms Hotel, the Residence on Bay, and the Toronto Marriott Bloor Yorkville Hotel.

===Parks===
The Village of Yorkville Park is a series of gardens that includes Scots Pines growing out of circular benches, a set of metal archways among a row of crabapple trees, a marshy wetland, a waterfall bordering one side of a courtyard filled with benches and chairs, and a 650-tonne granite rock.

Frank Stollery Parkette is a wedge-shaped park named for local businessman and politician Frank Stollery (1879-1971); the park commemorates the history of Davenport Road.

Jesse Ketchum Park is named for the Canadian politician Jesse Ketchum, and is a greenspace park with a playground, located next to Jesse Ketchum Public School.

Town Hall Square commemorates the site of Yorkville Town Hall and is an urban oasis with paths and benches sheltered between rows of hedges, trees, and oversized pots. It abuts the Yorkville branch of the Toronto Public Library.

<doc id="930074" wikidata="Q570459" url="?curid=930074" title="Sandboarding">
<text>Sandboarding is a boardsport and extreme sport similar to snowboarding that involves riding down a sand dune while standing on a board, with both feet strapped in. Sand sledding can also be practised sitting down or lying on the belly or the back. It typically involves a sand sled, although it is also somewhat possible to use snow sleds or snowboards. The invention of modern sandboarding is largely attributed to Lon Beale, aka &#x27;Doctor Dune&#x27;, who began sandboarding in 1972 in California&#x27;s Mojave Desert.
Sandboarding has adherents throughout the world, but is most prevalent in desert areas or coastal areas with beach dunes. It is less popular than snowboarding, partly because it is very difficult to build a mechanised ski lift on a sand dune, meaning participants must climb or ride a dune buggy or all-terrain vehicle back to the top of the dune. On the other hand, dunes are normally available year-round as opposed to ski resorts, which are seasonal.

==Equipment==
The sandboard base is much harder than a snowboard, and is built mostly out of formica or laminex with special base materials now being made, that will slide on wet and dry sand. To glide in the sand, the board bottom is often waxed, usually with a paraffin-based sandboard wax, before a run. Afterwards, the bottom of the board may have a lightly sanded look to it. Most terrain sandboards are composed of hardwood ply, while &#x27;full-size&#x27; sandboards are a wood, fiber glass, and plastic composite. However, a snowboarding base will sometimes work on steeper dunes as well.

==Worldwide==
Sandboarding is practised worldwide, with locations available on every continent except Antarctica. &quot;The World&#x27;s Greatest Sandboarding Destinations&quot; lists sandboarding destinations in over 65 territories. A global sandboarding locations map is also available on sand-boarding.com.

===Sandboarding in Israel===
Drorbamidbar has sandboarding in Israel at Negev Desert not far from Ashalim in Ramat HaNegev.

===Sandboarding in Australia===
Little Sahara on Kangaroo Island in South Australia is a sand dune system roughly covering . The highest dune is approximately above sea level.

Lucky Bay, about south of Kalbarri, in Western Australia, is another sandboarding hotspot. Sandboarding Tours are offered in the area.

The Stockton dunes, 2.3 hours north from Sydney. Stockton Bight Sand Dunes system is up to , long, and covers an area of over . The massive sand dunes climb up to high. Located only minutes from the centre of Nelson Bay, it is the largest sand dune system in Australia.

===Sandboarding in Africa===

Sandboarding sites in Egypt include the Great Sand Sea near Siwa Oasis واحة سيوة in Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert, the Qattaniya القطانية sand dunes (1.5 h drive on/off-road from Cairo), El Safra الصفراء and Hadudah هدودة dunes midway between Dahab and St. Catherine in Sinai.

Namibia features sand-skiing, which is similar to sandboarding, performed with skis instead of a board. Most of the sand-skiing is performed in the Namib desert dunes around Swakopmund and Walvis Bay. With a special permit it is sometimes possible to sand-ski at the world&#x27;s highest dunes in Sossusvlei. Henrik May, a German living in Namibia for some 10 years, set a Guinness World Record in speed sand-skiing on 6 June 2010. He reached a speed of .

After some pioneers like Derek Bredenkamp who boarded Swakopmund around 1974, commercial operators in South Africa began offering sandboarding to tourists in 1994. In 2000 the Sandboarding South Africa league was established. 
Between 2002 and 2004 the South African Sandboarding League held competitions on the Matterhorn Dune located between Swakopmund and Walvis bay. Competition events included dual slalom, boarder cross and big air events. In 2005 and 2006 Alter Action held sandboarding competitions at Matterhorn but the competitions no longer formed part of the South African Sandboarding League during those years. The league collapsed, then the sport was revived again in 2007 with weekly sandboarding sessions in and around Cape Town and Gauteng.

===Sandboarding in the U.S.===
Sand Master Park, located in Florence, Oregon USA is a dedicated sandboarding park and the first of its kind, featuring of sculpted sand dunes and a full-time pro shop. Dune Riders International is the governing body for competitive sandboarding worldwide and sanctions events each season at Sand Master Park and around the world. Sand Master Park is also the factory outlet for the largest sandboard company in the world, Venomous Sandboards.

Coral Pink Sand Dunes State Park, near Kanab, Utah, permits sandboarding on roughly 2,000 acres of sand dunes within its boundaries. Utah also contains sand dunes near Salt Lake City, Lake Powell, and Moab. Additionally, the company Slip Face Sandboards is based in Provo, Utah.

Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve near Alamosa, Colorado has sandboarding on what it calls the tallest dunes in North America. Sandboarding and skiing are permitted anywhere on the dunefield away from vegetated areas.

===Sandboarding in South America===
Peru is known for having large sand dunes in Ica, some reaching up to . Duna Grande in Ica is the largest sand dune in the world. The &quot;Copa Sandboarding Perú&quot; (Peru – Sandboarding Cup) has been held near Paracas every year since 2009. Since 2017 the Sandboard World Cup is hosted in the region of Ica by InterSands. There are also great dunes near the capital city (Lima) in Chilca.

In Chile, sandboarding is practiced throughout the north of the country, including the Medanoso dunes in Copiapo (where the Dakar rally takes place), Puerto Viejo beach in Caldera, excellent dunes in Iquique, and some near Viña del Mar.

===Sandboarding in Central America===
Nicaragua is home to Cerro Negro, the youngest volcano in Central America. Since it has steep slopes and volcanic sand, it is possible to sandboard down this active volcano.

===Sandboarding in Europe===

A rather small sand mountain is the Monte Kaolino in Hirschau, Germany. Equipped with a lift, it was the host of the annual Sandboarding World Championships until 2007.

The Dune of Pilat in France is an hours&#x27; drive from Bordeaux; it is the tallest dune in Europe, measuring 3 kilometres across, 500 metres wide and between 100 and 115 metres tall depending on the year.

Amothines is a small desert from Katalakkos village in Limnos, Greece. There are many sand dunes there, where people can practice sandboarding.

===Sandboarding in the United Kingdom===

Wales is home to the village of Merthyr Mawr that is from the town of Bridgend, the village is close to a beach and it is home to the &quot;Big Dipper&quot;, the second largest sand dune in Europe.

Holywell, Cornwall is also home to a beach with a complex of sand dunes; in the summer and during peak times, local shops that cater for beach goers also sell sandboards.

The Braunton Burrows sand dunes on the Devon coast, was the filming location for where Alex Bird became the first sandboarder to be towed by a car on British shores.

In the North East region of the United Kingdom, there is a small beach at Seaton Sluice where people can sandboard. This is a good alternative to sledding, as there is insufficient snow to support sledding there, even though the UK has a rather cold climate, with chilly winters and cool summers.

==Events==
* Sandboarding World Championship – The SWC was held annually in Hirschau (until 2007), Germany at Monte Kaolino, currently also the site of Europe&#x27;s largest sand hill.

<doc id="930076" wikidata="Q586570" url="?curid=930076" title="Alfred Lacroix">
<text>Antoine François Alfred Lacroix (4 February 186312 March 1948), known as Alfred Lacroix, was a French mineralogist and geologist. He was born in Mâcon, Saône-et-Loire.

== Education ==
Alfred Lacroix completed a D. s Sc. in Paris in 1889, as student of Ferdinand André Fouqué. Fouqué only agreed to the graduation if Lacroix would marry his daughter.

== Career ==
In 1893, Alfred Lacroix was appointed professor of mineralogy at the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, and in 1896 director of the mineralogical laboratory in the École des Hautes Études.

He paid especial attention to minerals connected with volcanic phenomena and igneous rocks, to the effects of metamorphism, and to mineral veins, in various parts of the world, notably in the Pyrenees. In his numerous contributions to scientific journals he dealt with the mineralogy and petrology of Madagascar, and published an elaborate and exhaustive volume on the eruptions in Martinique, &quot;La Montagne Pelée et ses éruptions&quot; (Paris 1904).

He also issued an important work entitled &quot;Minéralogie de la France et de ses Colonies&quot; (1893–1898), and other works in conjunction with Auguste Michel-Lévy. He was president of the volcanology section (1922–1927) of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). He was elected member of the Académie des sciences in 1904. He was awarded the Penrose Medal in 1930.

His will includes a final wish that testifies to his great modesty: &quot;“I recall that I want to be buried without ceremony of any kind, in the presence of my family only. This does not mean that I am indifferent to my colleagues, pupils and friends, but I attach little value to external events. I only ask them to devote a small place to me in their memories, which can be done without leaving one&#x27;s work and normal life.”&quot; Alfred Lacroix was buried on 18 March 1948 in the family vault, which has no nominal inscription, at the cimetière du Montparnasse (3rd division, concession 871 P 1827).

== Contributions ==
Alfred Lacroix&#x27;s work was extensive and covered various scientific areas, including mineralogy, geology, petrology, vulcanology, and the history of sciences. He redefined and enriched the concept of mineral species and emphasized the importance of integrating various methods of observation in understanding minerals&#x27; occurrence, associations, genesis, and transformations in nature.

He conducted detailed studies on the role of minerals in the composition of rocks, bridging the gap between mineralogy and petrography. Lacroix&#x27;s research in contact metamorphism, particularly in the Pyrénées, contributed to our understanding of this geological process. His work also supported the theory that mineralizers and volatile emanations from eruptive magmas played a crucial role in metamorphism.

Alfred Lacroix extensively studied volcanic eruptions and the materials ejected by volcanoes worldwide. His investigations on Mount Pelée shed light on the formation of domes and &quot;nuées ardentes&quot; (pyroclastic flows). He played a significant role in the classification of eruptive rocks, which helped determine their relationships and conditions of formation.

Lacroix&#x27;s expertise extended to the formation of pegmatites, and he notably studied Madagascar pegmatites, distinguishing between potassium and sodium-lithium pegmatites. He also made significant contributions to the understanding of laterite formation, explaining the concentration of iron and aluminum hydroxides during the alteration of silicate rocks in tropical climates.

His interest in terrestrial rocks led him to the study of meteorites, where he applied the same principles to classify stony meteorites rationally. Additionally, he curated extensive mineralogy and petrography collections at the Museum of Natural History in Paris.

== Travel and Exploration ==
Alfred Lacroix was an adventurous traveler who conducted geological and mineralogical research in various regions worldwide. His journeys took him to Scotland, England, Ireland, Scandinavia, North America (Canada and the USA), Germany, Greece, Asia Minor, Japan, Malaya, and Java. He was a pioneer in colonial mineralogy, exploring regions like Martinique, Guadeloupe, Guinea, Madagascar, and Indochina. His observations during these travels greatly enriched scientific knowledge.

One of his notable discoveries was the identification and study of uranium minerals in Madagascar.

== Contributions to the History of Sciences ==
Apart from his scientific research, Alfred Lacroix had a deep interest in the history of sciences. He fulfilled his responsibilities as the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences by writing biographies of deceased members. His work in this area resulted in four volumes of captivating studies titled &quot;Figures de Savants,&quot; which focused on the lives and contributions of French geologists, mineralogists, and naturalists.

== Recognition and Honors ==
Alfred Lacroix&#x27;s contributions to the scientific community were widely recognized. He received numerous accolades, including being a &quot;Grand Officier&quot; of the Legion of Honor. He held memberships in various academies and received honorary memberships and doctorates &quot;honoris causa&quot; from around sixty universities, foreign institutes, and learned societies. He was also a correspondent of several international scientific organizations.

He received several prestigious medals during his career, including the Penrose Medal.

== Personal life ==
The later years of Alfred Lacroix&#x27;s life were marked by personal tragedy, as he lost his wife in December 1944. His wife had been his loyal companion and collaborator throughout his extensive travels and research.

Lacroix was known for his conscientiousness, open-mindedness, fairness, and kindness. He had a sharp intellect and occasionally displayed a slightly ironic sense of humor. His students and colleagues held deep respect and admiration for him, and he left an enduring legacy in the world of French science.

== Bibliography ==
Alfred Lacroix authored numerous scientific publications throughout his career, contributing significantly to the fields of mineralogy, geology, and petrology. Some of his notable works include:

# &quot;Les minéraux des roches&quot; (with Auguste Michel-Lévy) – 1888
# &quot;Tableaux des minéraux des roches&quot; (with Auguste Michel-Lévy) – 1889
# &quot;Les enclaves des roches volcaniques&quot; – 1893
# &quot;Minéralogie de la France et de ses Colonies,&quot; Vol. III (1901) and Vol. IV (1910)
# &quot;La Montagne Pelée et ses éruptions&quot; – 1904
# &quot;Minéralogie de Madagascar,&quot; 3 Vols. (1922, 1923)
# &quot;Figures de Savants,&quot; Vol. I-IV (Biographies of French geologists, mineralogists, and naturalists)

Lacroix&#x27;s publications are known for their meticulous research and valuable contributions to the understanding of mineralogical and geological phenomena.

== Legacy ==
Alfred Lacroix&#x27;s pioneering work in mineralogy, geology, and petrology, along with his dedication to scientific research, left an indelible mark on the world of French science. His extensive collections and writings continue to inspire and educate future generations of scientists.

A species of Asian snake, &quot;Oligodon lacroixi&quot;, is named in his honor, as is the Lacroix Glacier in the Taylor Valley of Antarctica.

== Society ==
Antoine Lacroix was one of the founder members in 1930 of the Society of Friends of André-Marie Ampère which was created to develop the first science museum in France, the Ampère Museum close to Lyons.

<text>Oswald is a preschool educational children&#x27;s animated television series created by Dan Yaccarino and developed by Lisa Eve Huberman. The show was co-produced by HIT Entertainment and Nickelodeon. The main character is a thoughtful blue octopus named Oswald who lives in an apartment complex.

Overall 26 episodes were produced. In the United States, the series premiered on Nickelodeon (as part of its Nick Jr. block) on 20 August 2001. Reruns were also broadcast on CBS (during the Nick Jr. on CBS block) and on Noggin. When the Noggin brand was relaunched as a streaming service in 2015, all 26 episodes of &quot;Oswald&quot; were made available for streaming.

Prior to airing, Brown Johnson (senior vice president of Nick Jr.) said &quot;Dan Yaccarino has created an octopus who could be a pre-schooler&#x27;s best friend&quot;.

==Premise==
The series is set in Big City, a colorful world populated by anthropomorphic animals, mythological creatures and humanoid beings. Each episode follows the daily experiences of an anthropomorphic blue octopus named Oswald (voiced by Fred Savage), accompanied by his beloved hot dog-shaped dog, Weenie, and their life in the cheerful and whimsically-designed community of Big City. Commonly, the program concentrates on Oswald&#x27;s experiences with friends, acquaintances and neighbors, including Henry, a penguin, and Daisy, a flower, among others and his patient methods of coping with or tolerating different situations and dilemmas, along with his thoroughly optimistic outlook on life.

==Characters==

===Main===

* Oswald (voiced by Fred Savage in the US and Richard Pearce in the UK) is the main character who lives in an apartment complex in Big City. A very gentle, polite and bighearted anthropomorphic blue giant pacific octopus with a bowler hat, Oswald is always willing to go out of his way to help his friends. His hobbies are playing the piano and singing.
* Weenie (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is Oswald&#x27;s dachshund. She bears a strong resemblance to a hot dog and only communicates in &quot;bark-speak&quot;. She accompanies Oswald everywhere he goes, and her favorite food is dog biscuits.
* Henry (voiced by David Lander in the US and David Holt in the UK) is Oswald&#x27;s downstairs adélie penguin neighbor and best friend. Stubborn yet somewhat level-headed, Henry is a creature of habit in every way and usually shuns the idea of trying different things, though he can sometimes be persuaded otherwise. He tries his best to maintain a rigid schedule. As such, he takes care of his extensive spoon collection, watches &quot;Penguin Patrol&quot; every evening, and does the Penguin Polka before bedtime. Most of Henry&#x27;s favorite foods are fish-flavored, and is a proven expert on snow. Additionally, he has an identical cousin from the frozen north named Louie, and on occasion speaks of an Aunt Arctica. His motto is &quot;Slow and steady!&quot; He always takes two marshmallows in his hot cocoa, saying &quot;No more, no less.&quot; He also hates getting wet.
* Daisy (voiced by Crystal Scales in the US and Moir Leslie in the UK) is a tall orange/yellow/green flower. Free-spirited and energetic yet a little clumsy, Daisy participates in sports and other activities. She is a close friend of both Oswald and Henry, the three of them often go on adventures together. Daisy loves sunflower sundaes, riding her unicycle, has a large leaf collection and loves peppermint tea. Daisy is very excitable and often has to be hushed by Oswald when she speaks too loudly.

===Recurring===
* Johnny Snowman (voiced by Mel Winkler in the US and Colin McFarlane in the UK) is a laid-back snowman who operates an ice cream shop and also has an ice cream truck. He has a deep baritone voice. He also has a brother in the frozen north named Phil.
* Egbert (voiced by Daran Norris in the US and Gary Martin in the UK) and Leo (voiced by J. Grant Albrecht in the US and David Holt in the UK) are eggs who are also twin brothers. Leo always responds in conversations with an enthusiastic &quot;Yes, yes!&quot; while Egbert refers to everyone as &quot;old boy&quot;.
* Madame Butterfly (voiced by Laraine Newman in the US and Moir Leslie in the UK) is the proprietor of the local diner, a favorite lunch stop for Oswald and his friends. Her name is a pun on the opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.
* Catrina (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is a baby caterpillar that is just learning how to speak. She is the only child of Madame Butterfly. Like other babies, Catrina is highly curious about everything around her, but is always attended by her mom or others to keep her curiosity in check.

===Minor===
* Pongo (voiced by Richard Kind in the US and Gary Martin in the UK) is a large yellow and red dragon with a long thin green mustache and is quite similar to the dragons in Chinese culture and folklore. He lives in a Chinese-style home in Big City. In sharp contrast to his otherwise intimidating size, Pongo is very shy and soft-spoken, and known for his occasional clumsiness.
* Buster is a very slow moving turtle living in the same apartment building as Oswald. He appears in several episodes.
* Cactus Polly (voiced by Laraine Newman in the US and Jo Wyatt in the UK) is a helpful Southern-accented cactus lady who carries a lasso and talks like a cowgirl from the wild west.
* Gingerbread People are anthropomorphic gingerbread men who reside in Big City and are often seen in the backgrounds of episodes.
* Sammy Starfish (voiced by Tony Orlando) is Oswald&#x27;s musical idol and a jazz singer. Oswald&#x27;s dream is to play the piano for Sammy Starfish, which becomes a reality when Sammy&#x27;s show comes to Big City and the tickets are all sold out.
* Steve Tree (voiced by Fred Stoller in the US and Gary Martin in the UK) is a tree that comes to life. Sometimes his pet Woodrow pecks on him, usually on his head.
* Andy Pumpkin (voiced by Eddie Deezen in the US and David Holt in the UK) is Steve&#x27;s loopy best friend. He is a happy-go-lucky pumpkin person and works at a candy shop. He tends to speak in hyper tones when working in the candy shop.
* Bingette Bunny (voiced by Kathy Najimy) is a ditsy rabbit who runs the gardening store where Oswald buys his tomato plants. She is usually very unhelpful but usually says &quot;Just doing my job!&quot; when Oswald leaves the store. 
* Roderick Robot is a mechanical man with a mechanical cat, Tinsel. Oswald cat-sits for Roderick, and it turns out Tinsel is a very naughty cat.
* Bingo (voiced by Mac Davis) is Big City&#x27;s barber, a rabbit who also runs a newspaper store from which Henry buys his newspaper. He only talks in the episodes &quot;Henry Needs a Haircut&quot; and &quot;The Naughty Cat&quot;.
* Louie (voiced by Michael McKean) is Henry&#x27;s cousin from the arctic.
* Flippy is a fish who Oswald bought at the pet store but had to give to the Big City Aquarium as the fish grew too large.
* The Paper People are silent humans made of paper who appear in several episodes as cameo characters.
* Woodrow is Steve&#x27;s pet woodpecker.
* Tinsel is Roderick&#x27;s pet mechanical cat.
* The Fish are fish who appear in the episode &quot;Going Fishing&quot;.
* Maestro Bingo runs a store of various musical instruments and appears in the episodes &quot;Daisy Plays an Instrument&quot; and &quot;Fixing the Piano&quot;.

<text>A Canadian Forces base or CFB () is a military installation of the Canadian Armed Forces. For a facility to qualify as a Canadian Forces base, it must station one or more major units (e.g., army regiments, navy ships, air force wings).

Minor installations are named Canadian Forces station or CFS (). A Canadian Forces station could host a single minor unit (e.g., an early-warning radar station). Many of these facilities are now decommissioned for administrative purposes and function as detachments of a larger Canadian Forces base nearby.

The RCAF supplies aircraft to Canadian Joint Operations Command, which frequently operate from a chain of forward operating locations (FOLs) at various civilian airfields across northern Canada, capable of supporting RCAF operations. CF-18 Hornets, CP-140 Auroras and various transport and search and rescue aircraft periodically deploy to these FOLs for short training exercises, Arctic sovereignty patrols, aid to the civil power, or search and rescue operations.

The Canadian Forces were reduced during the 1990s from a high of 90,000 personnel in the late 1980s to the present force levels. Coinciding with personnel and equipment reductions was the politically controversial decision to close a number of bases and stations which were obsolete or created duplication.

A small number of these &quot;closed&quot; facilities have actually continued operating as before; but, because of cost and administrative efficiency—or, in the case of radio and radar facilities, automation—, they have been absorbed into other nearby bases and therefore do not qualify for separate designations. For example, the CF Leadership and Recruit School at St. Jean, Quebec, is now a lodger unit of CFB Montreal, and the former CFS Masset is a detachment of CFS Leitrim. Other facilities are now used as training grounds for reserve/militia units.

<doc id="930080" wikidata="Q1755692" url="?curid=930080" title="Virtual method table">
<text>In computer programming, a virtual method table (VMT), virtual function table, virtual call table, dispatch table, vtable, or vftable is a mechanism used in a programming language to support dynamic dispatch (or run-time method binding).

Whenever a class defines a virtual function (or method), most compilers add a hidden member variable to the class that points to an array of pointers to (virtual) functions called the virtual method table. These pointers are used at runtime to invoke the appropriate function implementations, because at compile time it may not yet be known if the base function is to be called or a derived one implemented by a class that inherits from the base class.

There are many different ways to implement such dynamic dispatch, but use of virtual method tables is especially common among C++ and related languages (such as D and C#). Languages that separate the programmatic interface of objects from the implementation, like Visual Basic and Delphi, also tend to use this approach, because it allows objects to use a different implementation simply by using a different set of method pointers. The method allows creation of external libraries, where other techniques perhaps may not.

Suppose a program contains three classes in an inheritance hierarchy: a superclass, , and two subclasses, and . Class defines a virtual function named , so its subclasses may provide an appropriate implementation (e.g. either or ). When the program calls the function on a reference (which can refer to an instance of , or an instance of or ), the code must be able to determine which implementation of the function the call should be &quot;dispatched&quot; to. This depends on the actual class of the object, not the class of the reference to it (). The class cannot generally be determined &quot;statically&quot; (that is, at compile time), so neither can the compiler decide which function to call at that time. The call must be dispatched to the right function &quot;dynamically&quot; (that is, at run time) instead.

==Implementation==

An object&#x27;s virtual method table will contain the addresses of the object&#x27;s dynamically bound methods. Method calls are performed by fetching the method&#x27;s address from the object&#x27;s virtual method table. The virtual method table is the same for all objects belonging to the same class, and is therefore typically shared between them. Objects belonging to type-compatible classes (for example siblings in an inheritance hierarchy) will have virtual method tables with the same layout: the address of a given method will appear at the same offset for all type-compatible classes. Thus, fetching the method&#x27;s address from a given offset into a virtual method table will get the method corresponding to the object&#x27;s actual class.

The C++ standards do not mandate exactly how dynamic dispatch must be implemented, but compilers generally use minor variations on the same basic model.

Typically, the compiler creates a separate virtual method table for each class. When an object is created, a pointer to this table, called the virtual table pointer, vpointer or VPTR, is added as a hidden member of this object. As such, the compiler must also generate &quot;hidden&quot; code in the constructors of each class to initialize a new object&#x27;s virtual table pointer to the address of its class&#x27;s virtual method table.

Many compilers place the virtual table pointer as the last member of the object; other compilers place it as the first; portable source code works either way.
For example, g++ previously placed the pointer at the end of the object.

==Example==
Consider the following class declarations in C++ syntax:

class B1 {
public:
 virtual ~B1() {}
 void fnonvirtual() {}
 virtual void f1() {}
 int int_in_b1;

class B2 {
public:
 virtual ~B2() {}
 virtual void f2() {}
 int int_in_b2;


used to derive the following class:

class D : public B1, public B2 {
public:
 void d() {}
 void f2() override {}
 int int_in_d;


and the following piece of C++ code:

B2 *b2 = new B2();
D *d = new D();
g++ 3.4.6 from GCC produces the following 32-bit memory layout for the object codice_1:
and the following memory layout for the object codice_2:
Note that those functions not carrying the keyword codice_3 in their declaration (such as codice_4 and codice_5) do not generally appear in the virtual method table. There are exceptions for special cases as posed by the default constructor.

Also note the virtual destructors in the base classes, codice_6 and codice_7. They are necessary to ensure codice_8 can free up memory not just for codice_9, but also for codice_6 and codice_7, if codice_2 is a pointer or reference to the types codice_6 or codice_7. They were excluded from the memory layouts to keep the example simple. 

Overriding of the method codice_15 in class codice_9 is implemented by duplicating the virtual method table of codice_7 and replacing the pointer to codice_18 with a pointer to codice_19.

==Multiple inheritance and thunks==
The g++ compiler implements the multiple inheritance of the classes codice_6 and codice_7 in class codice_9 using two virtual method tables, one for each base class. (There are other ways to implement multiple inheritance, but this is the most common.) This leads to the necessity for &quot;pointer fixups&quot;, also called thunks, when casting.

Consider the following C++ code:

D *d = new D();
B1 *b1 = d;
B2 *b2 = d;

While codice_2 and codice_24 will point to the same memory location after execution of this code, codice_1 will point to the location codice_26 (eight bytes beyond the memory location of codice_2). Thus, codice_1 points to the region within codice_2 that &quot;looks like&quot; an instance of codice_7, i.e., has the same memory layout as an instance of codice_7.

==Invocation==
A call to codice_32 is handled by dereferencing codice_2&#x27;s codice_34 vpointer, looking up the codice_35 entry in the virtual method table, and then dereferencing that pointer to call the code.

Single inheritance

In the case of single inheritance (or in a language with only single inheritance), if the vpointer is always the first element in codice_2 (as it is with many compilers), this reduces to the following pseudo-C++:
(*((*d)[0]))(d)

Where codice_37 refers to the virtual method table of codice_9 and codice_39 refers to the first method in the virtual method table. The parameter codice_2 becomes the &quot;codice_41&quot; pointer to the object.

Multiple inheritance

In the more general case, calling codice_42 or codice_19 is more complicated:
(*(*(d[0]/*pointer to virtual method table of D (for B1)*/)[0]))(d) /* Call d-&gt;f1() */
(*(*(d[8]/*pointer to virtual method table of D (for B2)*/)[0]))(d+8) /* Call d-&gt;f2() */
The call to codice_32 passes a codice_6 pointer as a parameter. The call to codice_46 passes a codice_7 pointer as a parameter. This second call requires a fixup to produce the correct pointer. The location of codice_48 is not in the virtual method table for codice_9.

By comparison, a call to codice_50 is much simpler:
(*B1::fnonvirtual)(d)
==Efficiency==
A virtual call requires at least an extra indexed dereference and sometimes a &quot;fixup&quot; addition, compared to a non-virtual call, which is simply a jump to a compiled-in pointer. Therefore, calling virtual functions is inherently slower than calling non-virtual functions. An experiment done in 1996 indicates that approximately 6–13% of execution time is spent simply dispatching to the correct function, though the overhead can be as high as 50%. The cost of virtual functions may not be so high on modern architectures due to much larger caches and better branch prediction.

Furthermore, in environments where JIT compilation is not in use, virtual function calls usually cannot be inlined. In certain cases it may be possible for the compiler to perform a process known as devirtualization in which, for instance, the lookup and indirect call are replaced with a conditional execution of each inlined body, but such optimizations are not common.

To avoid this overhead, compilers usually avoid using virtual method tables whenever the call can be resolved at compile time.

Thus, the call to codice_35 above may not require a table lookup because the compiler may be able to tell that codice_2 can only hold a codice_9 at this point, and codice_9 does not override codice_35. Or the compiler (or optimizer) may be able to detect that there are no subclasses of codice_6 anywhere in the program that override codice_35. The call to codice_58 or codice_48 will probably not require a table lookup because the implementation is specified explicitly (although it does still require the &#x27;this&#x27;-pointer fixup).

==Comparison with alternatives==
The virtual method table is generally a good performance trade-off to achieve dynamic dispatch, but there are alternatives, such as binary tree dispatch, with higher performance in some typical cases, but different trade-offs.

However, virtual method tables only allow for single dispatch on the special &quot;this&quot; parameter, in contrast to multiple dispatch (as in CLOS, Dylan, or Julia), where the types of all parameters can be taken into account in dispatching.

Virtual method tables also only work if dispatching is constrained to a known set of methods, so they can be placed in a simple array built at compile time, in contrast to duck typing languages (such as Smalltalk, Python or JavaScript).

Languages that provide either or both of these features often dispatch by looking up a string in a hash table, or some other equivalent method. There are a variety of techniques to make this faster (e.g., interning/tokenizing method names, caching lookups, just-in-time compilation).

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical is an honor presented to producers for quality remixed recordings at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position&quot;.

The award was first presented as the Grammy Award for Remixer of the Year, Non-Classical at the 40th Grammy Awards in 1998 to Frankie Knuckles. While the award was under this name, it was presented without specifying a work; when it shifted to its current name in 2002 works were named. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award is presented &quot;to recognize an individual(s) who takes previously recorded material and adds or alters it in such a way as to create a new and unique performance&quot;. The prize is given to the remixer(s), not the original artist(s).

French DJ David Guetta, British producer Jacques Lu Cont, and Skrillex have each won the award twice. Kaskade and Steve &quot;Silk&quot; Hurley each have the most nominations at four, although neither artist has won the award. American producer Maurice Joshua was nominated in 2001 and 2003, and then won in 2004 for the Maurice&#x27;s Soul Mix of &quot;Crazy in Love&quot;. Dave Audé was nominated three times for the award, winning once, while Frankie Knuckles, David Morales, Roger Sanchez, Hex Hector and Deep Dish have each been nominated for the award twice and have won it once.

<text>Auguste Michel-Lévy (7 August 184427 September 1911) was a French geologist. He was born in Paris.

==Biography==
He became inspector-general of mines, and director of the Geological Survey of France. He was distinguished for his researches on extrusive rocks and their microscopic structure and origins. He employed the polarizing microscope early on for the identification of minerals. In his many contributions to scientific journals he described the granulite group, and dealt with pegmatites, variolites, eurites, the ophites of the Pyrenees, the extinct volcanoes of Central France, gneisses, and crystalline schists.

He wrote &quot;&quot;Structures et classification des roches éruptives&quot; (1889), but his more elaborate studies were carried out with Ferdinand André Fouqué. Together they wrote on the artificial production of feldspar, nepheline and other minerals, and also of meteorites, and produced &quot;Minéralogie micrographique: roches éruptives françaises&quot; (1879) and &quot;Synthése des minéraux et des roches&quot; (1882). Levy also collaborated with Alfred Lacroix in &quot;Les Minéraux des roches&quot; (1888) and &quot;Tableau des minéraux des roches&quot;&quot; (1889).

Michel-Lévy pioneered the use of birefringence to identify minerals in thin section with a petrographic microscope. He is widely known for the Michel-Lévy interference colour chart, which defines the interference colors from different orders of birefringence.

He also created classification schemes for igneous rocks which accounted for their mineralogy, texture, and composition, and showed that igneous rocks of different mineralogies could be formed from the same chemical composition, with different conditions of crystallization. He named &quot;esterellite&quot; to the blue porphyry of Estérel in 1896.

<doc id="930093" wikidata="Q4818635" url="?curid=930093" title="Attorney General of Hawaii">
<text>The attorney general of Hawaii () is the chief legal officer and chief law enforcement officer of Hawaii. In present-day statehood within the United States, the attorney general is appointed by the elected governor with the approval of the state senate and is responsible for a state department charged with advising the various other departments and agencies of state government. The attorney general is responsible for the prosecution of offenses under state law. The attorney general can only be removed by an act of the state senate. In rare occasions, the attorney general serves as acting governor in the absence of both the governor and lieutenant governor from the state for an extended period of time.

The office has existed in several forms throughout the history of the Hawaiian Islands. It was created by Kamehameha III and was part of the administration of each successive monarch of the Kingdom of Hawaii. The office was kept in the provisional government, after Liliuokalani and the monarchy was overthrown, and became a part of the succeeding administration of the Republic of Hawaii. A regular part of the American model of the executive branch of government, the office of attorney general was part of the Territory of Hawaii under Section 80 of the Hawaiian Organic Act and made an appointed office after statehood was achieved in 1959.

Though a non-partisan office, in territorial days the office of attorney general was traditionally appointed from the political party of the sitting president of the United States who appointed the territorial governor. Similarly in statehood, the office of attorney general has traditionally been appointed from the incumbent governor&#x27;s political party, thus far Republican or Democratic.

The current attorney general is Anne E. Lopez, who was appointed by Governor Josh Green. The Hawaii Senate confirmed Lopez&#x27;s nomination on December 5, 2022.

==Agencies==
The attorney general leads a department of 180 attorneys and 500 professional and support personnel. The department oversees various public services. These include administering the Hawaii Criminal Justice Data Center, running the Missing Child Center, Child Support Enforcement Agency, Hawaii Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, Hawaii Internet and Technology Crimes Unit, Office of Child Support Hearings, Tobacco Enforcement Unit, among others. In accordance with Chapter 846E of the Hawaii Revised Statutes, the Criminal Justice Data Center maintains a registry of sex offenders in the state. Likewise, the agency provides other criminal history information through the statewide criminal history record information system and Automated Fingerprint Identification System.

==History==

===Origins===

John Ricord served as the first attorney general of Hawaii. He arrived in the Kingdom on February 27, 1844, on the &quot;Columbia&quot;. He was the first Western-trained lawyer in the islands. 
The previous year a land dispute by Richard Charlton led to a British occupation known as the Paulet Affair. A related case of Ladd &amp; Co. required lengthy arbitration. These cases would consume his entire time on the islands. Within a few weeks he swore allegiance to Kamehameha III and on March 9, 1844, was appointed first attorney general. In July 1845 he joined the Privy Council.
On October 29, 1845, the executive branch of the government was formally organized through legislation he proposed. On May 17, 1847, he resigned all his offices, and on June 12 was released from his oath of allegiance, so he could resume his citizenship of the United States.
He left August 19, 1847.
The office of attorney general was suspended until the 1860s.
His work on organizing the courts was taken over by the second trained attorney to arrive in the islands, William Little Lee.

===Revival===
On August 26, 1862, Kamehameha IV revived the office and appointed Charles Coffin Harris as attorney general. Having an attorney general proved useful on constitutional matters. Kamehameha V insisted on a new constitution that would restore some of the power to the monarchy that had been lost over time. Harris issued his legal opinion that the king had such a right and produced an early draft. A constitutional convention failed to reach agreement, so Harris got the cabinet to negotiate directly with Kamehameha V leading to the promulgation of the 1864 Constitution.

===Controversies===
A more modern controversy happened with the failed 1998 confirmation by the state senate of popular sitting attorney general Margery Bronster, as political payback for her actions to reform the corrupt Kamehameha Schools/Bishop Estate whose trustees were friends of various powerful legislators, many Hawaii residents called for the right to elect the attorney general. Several attempts failed to create the constitutional amendment.

<text>Neoceratodus is a genus of lungfish in the family Neoceratodontidae. The extant Australian lungfish (&quot;Neoceratodus forsteri&quot;) is the only surviving member of this genus, but it was formerly much more widespread, being distributed throughout Africa, Australia, and South America. Species were also much more diverse in body plan; for example, the Cretaceous species &quot;Neoceratodus africanus&quot; was a gigantic species that coexisted with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; in what is now the Kem Kem Formation of Morocco. The earliest fossils from this genus are of &quot;Neoceratodus potkooroki&quot; from the mid Cretaceous (Albian-Cenomanian) Griman Creek Formation of Australia; remains from the Late Jurassic of Uruguay assigned to this genus probably do not belong to the genus.

== Species ==
The following species are currently classified in this genus:

* †&quot;Neoceratodus africanus&quot;
* †&quot;Neoceratodus eyrensis&quot;
* &quot;Neoceratodus forsteri&quot; (Queensland lungfish)
*†&quot;Neoceratodus potkooroki&quot;
* †&quot;Neoceratodus nargun&quot;
* †&quot;Neoceratodus palmeri&quot;

Two species formerly classified in &quot;Neoceratodus&quot;, &quot;N. gregoryi&quot; and &quot;N. djelleh&quot;, have since been reclassified to the genera &quot;Mioceratodus&quot; and &quot;Archaeoceratodus&quot; respectively, as &quot;Mioceratodus gregoryi&quot; and &quot;Archaeoceratodus djelleh&quot;.

<text>The Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance is an accolade presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally named the Gramophone Awards, to performers of quality traditional R&amp;B vocal performances. The award was first given in 1999; until 2003, only albums were nominated, now just singles or tracks are. Honors in several categories are presented at the ceremony annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot; As of the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, the eligibility criteria for the category was amended to &quot;more accurately represent recordings that embody the classical elements of R&amp;B/soul music, distinguishing them from contemporary interpretations of the genre&quot;.

Between 1999 and 2002, this accolade was originally known as Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Album. It was renamed in 2003 as Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance. Since 2012, the category has been known as Best Traditional R&amp;B Performance.

The award goes to the artist. The producer, engineer and songwriter can apply for a Winners Certificate.

Lalah Hathaway and Beyoncé have the most wins (3) in this category. Hathaway and Anthony Hamilton have the most nominations (5) in this category. At the 66th Annual Grammy Awards, two-year-old Hazel Monét became the youngest ever Grammy nominee for her feature on her mother&#x27;s song, &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

<doc id="930104" wikidata="Q520078" url="?curid=930104" title="Ferdinand André Fouqué">
<text>Ferdinand André Fouqué (21 June 1828 – 7 March 1904) was a French geologist and petrologist.

He was born at Mortain, in the Manche &quot;département&quot;.

At the age of twenty-one he entered the École Normale Supérieure in Paris, and from 1853 to 1858 he held the appointment of keeper of the scientific collections. In 1877 he became professor of natural history in the chair of geology at the Collège de France, in Paris, succeeding Charles Sainte-Claire Deville. In 1881 Fouqué was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences.

As a stratigraphical geologist he rendered much assistance on the Geological Survey of France, but in the course of time he gave his special attention to the study of volcanic phenomena and earthquakes, to minerals and rocks; and he was the first to introduce modern petrographical methods into France. He also worked on volcanic gas analyses, using the methods of Robert Bunsen, notably on the island of Santorini (Greece). One prominent student of his was Alfred Lacroix, to whom Fouqué&#x27;s daughter was married.

His studies of the eruptive rocks of Corsica, Santorini and elsewhere; his researches on the artificial reproduction of eruptive rocks, and his treatise on the optical characters of feldspars deserve special mention; but he was perhaps best known for the joint work which he carried on with his friend Auguste Michel-Lévy.

His chief publications were: &quot;Santorin et ses éruptions&quot; (1879), &quot;Minéralogie micrographique : roches éruptives françaises&quot; (1879) and &quot;Synthèse des minéraux et des roches&quot; (1882); the latter two works written in collaboration with Auguste Michel-Lévy.
In 1885 he edited the report of the French commission that investigated the Andalusian earthquake of 25 December 1884.

Fouqué is also noteworthy for his archaeological excavations on the island of Santorini.

<doc id="930105" wikidata="Q1378149" url="?curid=930105" title="St. Salvator's Cathedral">
<text>St. Salvator&#x27;s Cathedral (), also known as the Cathedral of the Saviour and St. Donat, is the Roman Catholic cathedral of Bruges, Belgium. The cathedral is dedicated to the &quot;Verrezen Zaligmaker&quot; (Dutch, &#x27;risen saviour&#x27;, cf. Latin &quot;salvator&quot;, &#x27;saviour&#x27;) and Saint-Donatius of Reims.

==History==
St. Salvator, the main church of the city, is one of the few buildings in Bruges that have survived the onslaught of the ages without damage. Nevertheless, it has undergone some changes and renovations. This church was not originally built to be a cathedral; it was granted this status in the 19th century. Since the 10th century St. Salvator was a common parish church. At that time the Sint-Donaaskathedraal (St. Donatian&#x27;s Cathedral), which was located at the very heart of Bruges, opposite the City Hall, was the central religious building of the city. In 1116, a new fire destroyed the building, and in 1127, the construction of a new larger church began in Romanesque style. In 1250, the construction of the present church was undertaken, which lasted for about a century. At the end of the 18th century, the French occupiers of Bruges threw out the bishop of Bruges and destroyed the Sint-Donaaskathedraal, which was his residence.

In 1834, shortly after Belgium&#x27;s independence in 1830, a new bishop was installed in Bruges and St. Salvator&#x27;s Church obtained the status of cathedral. However, the building&#x27;s external image did not resemble a cathedral. It was much smaller and less imposing than the nearby Church of Our Lady and had to be adapted to its new role. Building a higher and more impressive tower was one of the viable options.

The roof of the cathedral collapsed in a fire in 1839. Robert Chantrell, an English architect, famous for his neo-Gothic restorations of English churches, was asked to restore St. Salvator to its former glory. At the same time, he was commissioned a project for a higher tower, in order to make it taller than that of Church of Our Lady. The oldest surviving part, dating from the 12th century, formed the base of the mighty tower. Instead of adding a neo-Gothic part to the tower, Chantrell chose a very personal Romanesque design. After completion there was a lot of criticism, and the Royal Commission for Monuments (&quot;Koninklijke Commissie voor Monumenten&quot;), without Chantrell&#x27;s authorization, placed a small peak on top of the tower, because the original design was deemed too flat. The fortress-like neo-Romanesque west tower is 99 meters high.

==Interior==
St. Salvator&#x27;s Cathedral&#x27;s 101-meter-long interior contains some noteworthy furnishings. It currently houses many works of art that were originally stored in its destroyed predecessor, the Sint-Donaaskathedraal. The wall-carpets that can be seen when entering the church were manufactured in Brussels by Jasper van der Borcht in 1731. These were commissioned by bishop for Sint-Donaaskathedraal. St. Salvator also has the original paintings that served as models for the wall-carpets.

==Music==
The organ of the cathedral was originally built by Jacobus Van Eynde (1717–1719) and was expanded and rebuilt three times in the 20th century: in 1902 by L. B. Hooghuys, in 1935 by Klais Orgelbau and in 1988 by Frans Loncke &amp; zonen. The instrument has 60 stops on three manuals and pedal. The organ is played in services and in the Kathedraalconcerten, a concert series founded in 1952. The organist is Ignace Michiels.

==Ten Tigers&#x27; martial arts==
The Ten Tigers of Canton traced their martial arts lineage to the Southern Shaolin Monastery 南少林寺 in the Jiulian Mountains 九連山 in Fujian Province 福建省. Southern Shaolin Kung Fu is a branch of the better known Shaolin Monastery 少林寺 on Mount Song 嵩山 in Henan Province 河南省. As such, the Ten Tigers&#x27; martial arts styles resemble those of Shaolin Kung Fu 少林武功.

<doc id="930108" wikidata="Q2630" url="?curid=930108" title="Ivanovo">
<text>Ivanovo (, ) is a city in Russia and the administrative center and largest city of Ivanovo Oblast, located northeast of Moscow and approximately from Yaroslavl, Vladimir and Kostroma. Ivanovo has a population of 361,644 as of the 2021 Census, making it the 50th largest city in Russia. Until 1932, it was previously known as &quot;Ivanovo-Voznesensk&quot;. It is the youngest city of the Golden Ring of Russia.

The city lies on the Uvod River, in the centre of the eponymous oblast. Ivanovo gained city status in 1871, emerged as a major center for textile production, and began to be referred to as the &quot;Russian Manchester&quot;. The city is served by Ivanovo Yuzhny Airport.

==Geography==
The Uvod River, a tributary of the Klyazma, flows from north to south, dividing the city into two halves. There are also two rivers in Ivanovo: the Talka and the Kharinka.

==Climate==
Ivanovo has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;). The city has warm summers with temperatures reaching over 30 °C and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The lowest air temperature ever recorded is -46°C (January 1940). The warmest month is July with a daily mean of 18.9°C, the coldest month is January with a daily mean of -8.7°C. The highest amount of precipitation is on average in July with 70 mm of precipitation, the driest is March with 34 mm of precipitation.

==History==

The city is first mentioned in 1561, when it was given to the Cherkassky princely family by Ivan IV, after the latter&#x27;s marriage to Maria Cherkasskaya. However, the relevant document has since been lost.

The modern city was created by merging the old flax-processing village Ivanovo with the industrial Voznesensky Posad in 1871. Yakov Garelin—a patron of arts, historian, manufacturer, and public figure—is considered to be the founder of the city and its second head. Under his leadership, the city began to develop, industrialise, and grow.

Until 1932, the official name of the city was Ivanovo-Voznesensk. Because of its textile manufacturing industry, Ivanovo earned the sobriquet of the &quot;Russian Manchester&quot; during the 19th century.

By the early 20th century, Ivanovo was competing with Łódź (also a part of the Russian Empire at that time) for the title of the primary textile production center of Europe. As the workers&#x27; living conditions were appalling, the strikes were frequent. One of these strikes (May 14-July 22, 1905) led to the first Russian revolution. According to the Soviet historiography, the Ivanovo Soviet (created on May 28, 1905) was one of the first soviets in history. 

In 1937, the city opened the Interdom - a school for children of foreign Communists, including high learning.

In Ivanov, the legendary air squadron (then - known as a Regiment) &quot;Normandie-Niemen&quot; began operations. By agreement between the Soviet government and the &quot;Free French&quot; government-in-exile in late 1942, a group of French pilots was sent to the Soviet Union. Construction of a new airport began on the northern outskirts of the city. The pilots were provided with decent housing, and 14 Yak-1 fighter aircraft. During 1943, the French fought alongside the Soviet Air Forces. Ivanov/Ivanovo was bombed in the World War II and fought over, briefly in the Russian Civil War.

After the war, along with the continued textile industry in Ivanovo engineering and other industries developed. In the 1960s, the city became the center of the Upper-Economic Council. The 1980s saw the accelerated pace of housing construction.

On June 9, 1984, Ivanovo was struck by an F4 tornado which killed at least 69 people and injured more than 130 others. Some estimates indicate up to 95 deaths. The tornado damaged, destroyed or leveled more than 1,180 homes and became one of the worst to strike Russia. This was part of the 1984 Soviet Union tornado outbreak which produced at least 11 tornadoes, with two of those being F4. In addition, the severe thunderstorms also produced hail up to 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) in weight, among the heaviest hailstones confirmed worldwide.

Since the beginning of the 21st century there has been declining production in Ivanovo. In the first decade of the century, a large number of enterprises were closed. The weaving factories BIM, BAT melange Plant and other smaller companies in the textile industry ceased to exist.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Ivanovo is the administrative center of the oblast and, within the framework of administrative divisions, it also serves as the administrative center of Ivanovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the City of Ivanovo—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the City of Ivanovo is incorporated as Ivanovo Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
Ivanovo gained a reputation as the textile capital of Russia during the nineteenth century. The development of the textile industry involved the importation of textile machinery from England often accompanied by supervisory staff particularly from Lancashire. Most textile workers are women, so it has also been known as the &quot;city of brides&quot;. Probably the most famous of the city&#x27;s female natives was the postmodern French writer Nathalie Sarraute. Also, there is a branch plant of AviraKids, a Russian holding company that occupies 37,5% of the Russian gaming equipment production industry.

==Transportation==
Public transport is represented by trolleybuses, buses and taxis. The trolleybus system was opened on November 5, 1962. The first line ran from the Bagayeva area (now Victory Square) to the GZIP plant. The tram was operated from November 6, 1934 until June 1, 2008. According to Ivanov, the former Mayor Alexander Fomin: &quot;Over the past 20 years, the number of vehicles in the city has increased by more than 10 times, while traffic is 5–7 times higher than that for which they were designed.

The system of urban bus services in Ivanovo-Voznesensk began on November 8, 1926. The bus park was originally located on the street Paris Commune. In the early 1960s, a new bus depot was built on Prospekt Tekstilchshiki. In the Soviet period, the operation of buses and coaches exercised Ivanovskoye passenger motor company (MTE) #1, and taxi station (Ivanovo MTE-2). Ivanovo MTE-1 closed in December 2007.

It is home to Ivanovo Severny, which is one of the largest military airlift bases in Russia. Civilian air services are provided at the Ivanovo Yuzhny Airport. Since 1896, there is a railway connection between Ivanovo and Moscow.

==Demographics==

The population of Ivanovo was 361,644 in 2021, down from 408,330 in 2010 and 478,370 in 1989.

As of the 2021 Census, the ethnic composition of Ivanovo was:

==Education==

Ivanovo has several educational institutions: Ivanovo State University, Ivanovo State University of Chemistry and Technology, Ivanovo Medical Academy, Ivanovo Architectural Academy, and Ivanovo State Power University (ISPU).

==Attractions==

There are several objects of cultural heritage in Ivanovo. The period from 1914 to 1934 became the “golden age” of architecture in Ivanovo. The center of the city boasts buildings of the period of constructionism built there in the 1920s – early 1930s. For historical reasons, Ivanovo-Voznesensk became the site of unique construction experiments carried out by both architects from Moscow and St. Petersburg, and local architects. Among them are the buildings, like the Ship-building (1930), architect D. F. Friedman; the Horseshoe-building (1934), architect A. I. Panov; the Regional Bank building (1927), architect V. A. Vesnin; the Palace of Arts (1939), architect A. V. Vlasov; House of the Collective (1931), architect I. A. Golosov; the Ivanovo railway station (1934); Oblsovnarhoz-houses (1935), N. I. Kadnikov; and others. First Workers&#x27; Settlement is rare landmark of the art of city planning from the 20s is of exceptional interest as one of earliest examples of mass, low rise standardized construction that reflects ideas of the city-garden.
Many monuments are devoted to the revolutionary past of the city, such as the &quot;Red Talka&quot; memorial or numerous monuments to revolutionaries. The historical center of the city is notable mainly for the former houses of famous Ivanovites: the mansion houses of E. I. Gratchev (1774), I. N. Polushin (1904; here the Soviet government was first declared), K. D. Burkov, the Kuvayevs, the Gandurins, the Burylins, etc. The industrial architecture, like the remaining textile manufactures of the 19th century, is also of interest.

Other notable sights include Schudrovskaya Palatka (17th century), the first brick civil building in Ivanovo, the Svyato-Vvedensky Monastery (architect P. Begen), the wooden Uspenskaya church (17th century), the mansion of A. Duringer (1910), and others.

==The youth policy==

===History===
According to historians, the youth policy in the city started in 1892, when the first Marxist society was formed. In 1919, the city Komsomol (Young Communist League) organization was established, soon this movement spread all over the region. By the beginning of the Great Patriotic War in 1941, Ivanovo regional Komsomol organization had already had over 100 thousand people. After the war the main objectives of the movements were to bring up and educate the working youth and to organize various activities.
In 1970-1980s different circles and amateur theatres were functioning, and people&#x27;s universities were established.

In the 1980s, Ivanovo Oblast became one of the largest student centers of European Russia (7 institutes of higher education and 26 colleges with about 35 thousand students).

In the 1990s, the youth policy in Ivanovo was challenged, but remained and developed, due to the activity of initiative ivanovites. In 1992, the Department of youth affairs was established. The new youth policy was being formed. New legislature and programs were launched to encourage young families, youth employment, patriotic education and support. 53 clubs of young families and 28 military-patriotic organizations were formed.
Since the beginning of the 2000s the complex youth and children&#x27;s policy has been pursued, through the legislative (like the regional law “Of the state support of youth and children’s social organizations) and grant support means.

Nowadays the Department of internal affairs of the Ivanovo region is responsible for the development of the youth policy of the region.

===Development===
There are almost 98 000 young people in Ivanovo, i.e. each fourth citizen. It is one of the Russian students&#x27; centers, with 8 public and 5 private institutes of higher education, offering educational facilities both for Russian and foreign students. The city is the third largest one in the country after Moscow and the Moscow region, in terms of number of students per 10 000 citizens.

There are 18 military-patriotic clubs with about 550 young participants, 170 people are in charge of local history activities. More than 20 per cent of young citizens take part in the youth organizations’ activities, like “IMCA – Ivanovo”, Russian Youth Union, the “Novy Rubezh”, Ivanovo city pupils’ Duma, the “Shkolny Activ Goroda” (City school activists) and many others.

Annually the city holds the “Students’ spring&quot; festival of students’ creativity. It&#x27;s the most popular event in cultural life of Ivanovo students, with the participation of all universities and institutes. Since 1997, the interregional festival of students “Maslenitsa” (“Pancake week”) is held. Yearly about 20 students’ teams from 6-8 regions take part in it.

Being concerned of the youth creativeness, the city government supports the development of facilities of students’ cultural, sporting and entertainment centers, as well as organizes regional sports competitions among students.

In order to encourage young scientists, each year the best students are given the grant of the governor, which is a good support for gifted researches. To increase the academic level of the youth, the contest of students’ and postgraduates’ researches was established. The papers should be devoted to the resolution of topical problems of the region. The best authors are given the award named after M. V. Frunze.

Ivanovo is a multinational city, more than 100 nationalities’ representatives live here. There are 16 ethnic and cultural autonomies, associations and centers.

Much attention is paid to the youth parliamentarism, which is developing within such structures, as the Youth Civic Council of the City Administration and Ivanovo city pupils’ Duma. The deputies of the latter participate in real elections campaigns in their schools, represents the schoolchildren&#x27;s interests to the municipal government, contribute to the development of youth initiatives, arrange socially topical activities, like the charity marathon “Ty nam nuzhen” (“We need you”) aimed at supporting children with disabilities.
There are several opportunities for the talented youth as well, e.g. awards and grants from the Head of the city.

In 2012 schoolchildren of Ivanovo supported the city&#x27;s bid to the contest “The European Youth Capital 2015” and organized a flash mob and made large patchwork cloth.
As a candidate city, Ivanovo is realizing a comprehensive program for the youth development, having invited professionals of the international level.
One of the contest&#x27;s objective being to strengthen interaction between local communities and the European structures, Ivanovo is increasing cooperation with international partners and investors, in order to develop its infrastructure. The status of the European Youth Capital will give Ivanovo a chance to become a role model for Russian and European cities, ready for empowering the youth and renovating their local communities.
Ivanovo is a youth and student center with great intellectual potential, where new ambitious ideas and projects are born and develop. Ivanovo of the future is a city which no one wants to leave, quite on the contrary.
So far the municipal and regional administration with the young activists has decided to bid for the title of the European Youth capital 2015. The initiative has been welcomed by Prime-minister and President of Russia.

<doc id="930109" wikidata="Q15252" url="?curid=930109" title="Floating production storage and offloading">
<text>A floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is a floating vessel used by the offshore oil and gas industry for the production and processing of hydrocarbons, and for the storage of oil. An FPSO vessel is designed to receive hydrocarbons produced by itself or from nearby platforms or subsea template, process them, and store oil until it can be offloaded onto a tanker or, less frequently, transported through a pipeline. FPSOs are preferred in frontier offshore regions as they are easy to install, and do not require a local pipeline infrastructure to export oil. FPSOs can be a conversion of an oil tanker (like &quot;Seawise Giant&quot;) or can be a vessel built specially for the application. A vessel used only to store oil (without processing it) is referred to as a floating storage and offloading (FSO) vessel.

The first of a related type, floating liquefied natural gas vessels, went into service in 2016.

== Types ==
FPSOs are classified into the following types.

* Floating storage and offloading (FSO)
* Floating production storage and offloading (FPSO)
* Floating drilling production storage and offloading (FDPSO)
* Floating storage regasification unit (FSRU)

A floating storage and offloading unit (FSO) is essentially an FPSO without the capability for oil or gas processing. Most FSOs are converted single hull supertankers. An example is &quot;Knock Nevis&quot;, ex &quot;Seawise Giant&quot;, which for many years was the world&#x27;s largest ship. It was converted into an FSO for offshore use before being scrapped.

At the other end of the LNG logistics chain, where the natural gas is brought back to ambient temperature and pressure, a specially modified ship may also be used as a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). A LNG floating storage and regasification unit receives liquefied natural gas (LNG) from offloading LNG carriers, and the onboard regasification system provides natural gas exported to shore through risers and pipelines. , there are 33 FSRUs in the world, of which some relocate to higher-priced areas.

== History ==
Oil has been produced from offshore locations since the late 1940s. Originally, all oil platforms sat on the seabed, but as exploration moved to deeper waters and more distant locations in the 1970s, floating production systems came to be used.

The first oil FPSO was owned by Shell and built by with help of SBM Offshore and Gusto in 1977 on the Shell Castellon field, located in the Spanish Mediterranean. Today, over 270 vessels are deployed worldwide as oil FPSOs.

On July 29, 2009, Shell and Samsung announced an agreement to build up to 10 LNG FPSOs, at the same Samsung Yard. Flex LNG appeared to construct smaller units.

On May 20, 2011, Royal Dutch Shell announced the planned development of a 488 m long and 74 m wide floating liquefied natural gas facility (FLNG), called Prelude, which is to be situated 200 km off the coast of Western Australia and is due for completion in around 2016. It will be the largest vessel ever built. Royal Dutch Shell (2013), LNG FPSO (Liquefied Natural Gas Floating production Storage and Offloading), Samsung Heavy Industries at a cost of $12 Billion.

In June 2012, Petronas made a contract of procurement engineering, construction, installation and commissioning, with the Technip and DSME consortium, for what is expected to be the world&#x27;s first floating liquefaction unit when completed in 2015. The unit is destined for the Kanowit gas field off Sarawak, Malaysia.

At the opposite (discharge and regasification) end of the LNG chain, the first ever conversion of an LNG carrier, Golar LNG owned Moss type LNG carrier into an LNG floating storage and regasification unit was carried out in 2007 by Keppel shipyard in Singapore.

== Mechanisms ==
Oil produced from offshore production platforms can be transported to the mainland either by pipeline or by tanker. When a tanker is chosen to transport the oil, it is necessary to accumulate oil in some form of storage tank, such that the oil tanker is not continuously occupied during oil production, and is only needed once sufficient oil has been produced to fill the tanker.

== Advantages ==
Floating production, storage and offloading vessels are particularly effective in remote or deep water locations, where seabed pipelines are not cost effective. FPSOs eliminate the need to lay expensive long-distance pipelines from the processing facility to an onshore terminal. This can provide an economically attractive solution for smaller oil fields, which can be exhausted in a few years and do not justify the expense of installing a pipeline. Once the field is depleted, the FPSO can be moved to a new location.

New build FPSOs have a high initial cost (up to USD1 billion), but require limited maintenance. In addition, the ability to reposition/repurpose them means they can outlast the life of the production facility by decades. A cheaper alternative for smaller platforms is to convert an oil tanker or similar vessel at a cost below USD100 million.

== Record vessels ==
The FPSO operating in the deepest waters is the FPSO &quot;BW Pioneer&quot;, built and operated by BW Offshore on behalf of Petrobras Americas INC. The FPSO is moored at a depth of 2,600 m in Block 249 Walker Ridge in the US Gulf of Mexico and is rated for . The EPCI contract was awarded in October 2007 and production started in early 2012. The FPSO conversion was carried out at &quot;MMHE Shipyard Pasir Gudang&quot; in Malaysia, while the topsides were fabricated in modules at various international vendor locations. The FPSO has a disconnectable turret (APL) The vessel can disconnect in advance of hurricanes and reconnect with minimal down time. A contract for an FPSO to operate in even deeper waters (2,900 m) for Shell&#x27;s Stones field in the US Gulf of Mexico was awarded to SBM Offshore in July 2013.

One of the world&#x27;s largest FPSO is the &quot;Kizomba A&quot;, with a storage capacity of . Built at a cost of over US$ 800 million by Hyundai Heavy Industries in Ulsan, Korea, it is operated by Esso Exploration Angola (ExxonMobil). Located in 1200 meters (3,940 ft) of water at Deep water block 200 statute miles (320 km) offshore from Angola, Central Africa in the Atlantic Ocean, it weighs 81,000 tonnes and is 285 meters long, 63 meters wide, and 32 meters high (935 ft by 207 ft by 105 ft).

The first FSO in the Gulf of Mexico, The FSO &quot;Ta&#x27;Kuntah&quot;, has been in operation since August 1998. The FSO, owned and operated by MODEC, is under a service agreement with &quot;PEMEX&quot; Exploration and Production. The vessel was installed as part of the Cantarell Field Development. The field is located in the Bay of Campeche, offshore Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán peninsula. It is a converted ULCC tanker with a SOFEC external turret mooring system, two flexible risers connected in a lazy-S configuration between the turret and a pipeline end manifold (PLEM) on the seabed, and an offloading system that allows up to two tankers at a time to moor and load, in tandem or side by side. The FSO is designed to handle with no allowance for downtime.

The Skarv FPSO, developed and engineered by &quot;Aker Solutions&quot; for &quot;BP Norge&quot;, is one of the most advanced and largest FPSO deployed in the Norwegian Sea, offshore Mid Norway. &quot;Skarv&quot; is a gas condensate and oil field development. The development ties in five sub-sea templates, and the FPSO has capacity to include several smaller wells nearby in the future. The process plant on the vessel can handle about of gas and of oil. An 80 km gas export pipe ties into Åsgard transport system. &quot;Aker Solutions&quot; (formerly Aker Kvaerner) developed the front-end design for the floating production facility as well as the overall system design for the field and preparation for procurement and project management of the total field development. The hull is an Aker Solutions proprietary &quot;Tentech975&quot; design. BP also selected Aker Solutions to perform the detail engineering, procurement and construction management assistance (EPcma) for the Skarv field development. The &quot;EPcma&quot; contract covers detail engineering and procurement work for the FPSO topsides as well as construction management assistance to BP including hull and topside facilities. The production started in field in August 2011. BP awarded the contract for fabrication of the &quot;Skarv&quot; FPSO hull to &quot;Samsung Heavy Industries&quot; in South Korea and the Turret contract to SBM. The FPSO has a length of 292 m, beam of 50.6 m and is 29 m deep, accommodates about 100 people in single cabins. The hull is delivered in January 2010.

<text>Ski patrols are organizations that provide medical, rescue, and hazard prevention services to the injured in ski area boundaries, or sometimes beyond into backcountry settings. Many have technical-medical certifications, such as Outdoor Emergency Care (OEC) provided by the National Ski Patrol (USA), that are specific to the winter-season environment and providing emergency medical services in remote locations. Many patrollers also hold EMS issued credentials, such as emergency medical technician or any other pre-hospital care certification. Due to the remote location and terrain, transportation is often limited to Rescue toboggan, snowmobile, or, for life-compromising injuries or extremely remote terrain, helicopter rescue. Depending on the ski area terrain, ski patrollers can be versed in a large variety of specialized rescues, such as avalanche search and rescue, outdoor emergency transportation, chairlift evacuation, and, in some cases, helicopter rescue techniques are taught. Patrols work to promote ski safety, enforce area policies (where applicable), and help the injured within their jurisdiction. Ski patrollers also work to set up the mountain before it opens by conducting trail checks, providing avalanche control work, and setting up necessary equipment in preparation for the day. At the end of the day, they also conduct a sweep clearing the mountain for off-hours.

Contrary to the name&#x27;s implications, ski patrollers can be snowboarders in addition to alpine, Nordic, or telemark skiers. Many patrols also have non-skiing positions whereby patrollers no longer able to ski or individuals lacking sufficient skiing or toboggan handling skills can still provide emergency care in a first aid room. Some ski areas also have a junior ski patrol program in which teenagers between the ages of 15 and 17 years old can participate. Most junior ski patrol programs limit the responsibilities of their members, such as preventing them from running toboggans or administering first aid without supervision. However, there are some areas with junior ski patrol programs which allow their members to operate with the same responsibilities as the rest of the patrol, after meeting the same standard in each skill category as other patrollers.

== &quot;Fédération internationale des patrouilles de ski&quot; ==
The &quot;Fédération internationale des patrouilles de ski (FIPS)&quot; is the international organisation representing ski patrol and associated ski safety organisations with membership from throughout the world. These patrol and safety organisations comprise full-time and volunteer ski patrollers, doctors, lawyers, engineers, technicians, ski equipment instructors, and ski area managers, who are involved in the multi-disciplinary activities of ski patrolling and safety.

Member countries of FIPS are Australia, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Romania, Russia, Scotland (UK), Serbia, Sweden, Switzerland, USA. In addition, there are a number of Associate Members who are non-national organisations.

The concept of FIPS can be traced back prior to 1979 when the first meeting was held in Calgary, Canada. Although there were many ski patrols in existence at that time, there was very little communication between them. Patrollers who had the opportunity to ski in other countries noticed differences and some commonality in procedures and standards relative to their own. In addition, accident prevention programmes were being implemented in some countries but not in others. A number of countries did not have a national ski patrol organisation.

FIPS was created as the world forum for ski patrollers to meet, exchange ideas and compare the latest in patrol techniques on a regular basis. FIPS is supported by national patrol organisations to provide the necessary input and to offer potential solutions to patrolling issues. To enable this collaboration FIPS holds a congress every two years in a location of a member nation.

FIPS exists due to the combined efforts of interested patrollers, individual ski patrols and national patrol organisations. FIPS seeks to improve the effectiveness of ski patrolling and, in turn, benefit the snow sports public. Over the years FIPS has initiated a number of specific projects of interest to patrollers:
* Issues of legal aspects of ski patrolling 
* Investigation of injuries to ski patrollers while on patrol 
* Documentation of member country&#x27;s training, qualification and recognition together with comparison of the training modules
* Recommendations of medical approaches to some specific ski injuries 
* Consideration of a standard Skiers Responsibility Code (safety rules)

== First Aid Committee – 1933 ==

In 1933 the Schenectady (New York) Wintersports Club was organizing Snow Trains for local skiers to go to the Gore Mountain-Pete Gay Massif above North Creek, New York to enjoy skiing on trails cut by local sports enthusiasts as well as from Schenectady. Because of tales learned of injured skiers on the early (1931) Boston to New Hampshire (Franconia) Snow Trains, the organizers decided to have a large and well prepared First Aid Committee. Headed by Lois Perret (Schaefer), RN, and aided by expert skiers from the Schenectady Wintersports Club, as well as North Creek High School students, a course on first aid and ski related injuries was taught to several dozen recruits. The Snow Trains were delayed because of a lack of snow in 1933/1934, but sufficient snow cover was achieved late, and the first Snow Train reached North Creek March 4, 1934. The First Aid Committee swung into action, sweeping trails for skiers needing assistance. The train acted as a base camp on the siding during the day. While no injuries were treated on that first trip, the First Aid Committee (AKA Ski Patrol) continued active participation on trains reaching North Creek during the pre-war years. They were assisted by a &quot;physician-on-call,&quot; Dr. James Glenn, a family physician and skier who practiced in North Creek. The First Aid Committee of 1933 anticipated the much needed assistance pioneered by Minnie Dole five (5) years later in conjunction with care for injured ski racers who were pushing limits of speed and technique. The first ski patrol was about helping mountainside injuries to regular ski enthusiasts—not racers.

== National Ski Patrol ==
The National Ski Patrol in USA was founded in 1938 by the NSP&#x27;s first chairman, Charles Minot Dole. &quot;Minnie,&quot; as he was known, decided that a &quot;service and safety&quot; organization was in order after he hurt himself skiing at Stowe, Vermont and had trouble evacuating himself from the slope. He created the Mount Mansfield Ski Patrol for the National Downhill and Slalom Championship at Mt. Mansfield. Roger F. Langley, the president of the National Ski Association asked Dole to consider a national patrol. Dole later went on to create the 10th Mountain Division, after seeing Finnish soldiers on skis destroy two armored divisions. One of the few federally chartered not-for-profit organizations in the U.S., the NSP has since become the world&#x27;s largest winter rescue organization. The NSP&#x27;s 26,500 paid and volunteer members serve on over 600 patrols. It is important to note that in conjunction with the development of the Nation&#x27;s First Volunteer Ski Patrol at Stowe, Cannon Mountain, in Franconia NH, had developed the Nation&#x27;s first Professional Ski Patrol, also in 1938. 

The NSP is composed of 10 geographic divisions plus a single division for all paid patrollers. Members are recognized on the slopes by the red jackets they wear, marked by a white cross on the chest and a larger one on the back, or by the older style of blue and rust colored parkas with yellow crosses.

=== Merits, Awards and Ranking ===
The levels of the National Ski Patrol are

# Patroller- work on alpine skis, snowboards, Nordic skis and bikes. Receive medical training which allows them to work in first aid rooms and to transport patients. 
# Alpine Patroller 
# Senior 
# Certified

There are also levels of personal achievement given to a Ski Patroller who goes beyond the call of duty is awarded the Yellow Merit Star. The highest Honor of the National Ski Patrol is the Purple merit star, this is awarded for saving a life.

=== Additional Programs ===
National Ski Patrol has an ongoing education system which includes OEC refreshers, and OEC classes.

The NSP also offers a Certified Program that enables patrollers to build upon their existing skills and experiences.

The Certified Program includes six modules, such as:

# Area operations and risk management
# Avalanche management
# Emergency care
# Lift evacuation and rope knowledge
# Skiing/ Snowboarding
# Toboggan handling

Over the course of its history, the NSP has helped to develop similar patrol organizations in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Argentina, Chile, Israel, Turkey and Korea.

== Canadian Ski Patrol ==


The Canadian Ski Patrol is the patrol governing body for Canada.

In 1940, Dr. Douglas Firth was asked by the Canadian Amateur Ski Association (CASA) to organize and train a first aid rescue group to patrol the ski hills. The Canadian Ski Patrol System was originally a standing committee of the CASA with independent patrols in different areas. During the years between 1941 and 1948, the war restricted expansion, but the Toronto and Montreal Patrols united to form the nucleus of a national organization. During the next five years, the System expanded in Ontario, Quebec and the Vancouver area.

The founder and President of the Quebec area was led by James Harold Millard, a resident of Montreal and Morin Heights. Harold became National Chairman for Canada, following Dr Firth. 
In the early years, those who were injured were taken down the hill on a toboggan where they were then loaded onto the train for transportation to Montreal for medical care. Many photos of the original patrol in Quebec were turned over to the CSPS in the late 90s for their archives. 
The family tradition continued when both Harold&#x27;s daughter-in-law and grandson were members of the CSPS in Ontario and Alberta.

By 2004, the Canadian Ski Patrol had 5,000 members across Canada.

The CSP is composed of nine geographic divisions, each further divided into zones. The largest zone is Central Zone, within Ontario Division, with 575 patrollers as of 2017.

While some resorts or zones specify their own uniforms, the official Alpine uniform is defined as a jacket that is &quot;...red with the proper markings. These markings will include a white cross on the back, a white cross on both upper arms and an optional white cross on the breast.&quot; The yellow and blue uniform was retired in 2016, and will be fully phased out by 2020.

<text>Colombia competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s sixteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki.

Comité Olímpico Colombiano sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games since 1972. A total of 53 athletes, 32 men and 21 women, took part in 18 sports. Ten Colombian athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including tennis player Fabiola Zuluaga in the women&#x27;s singles, road cyclist Víctor Hugo Peña, and weightlifter Carmenza Delgado, who became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Colombia left Athens with a total of two Olympic bronze medals, which were both awarded to weightlifter Mabel Mosquera, and track cyclist María Luisa Calle in the women&#x27;s points race. Originally, Calle finished in the bronze medal position, but was later disqualified under a strict liability rule after she had been tested positive for the banned stimulant heptaminol, handing the medal over to U.S. cyclist Erin Mirabella. As a result of the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s decision on November 23, 2005, the bronze medal was officially reinstated to Calle after this had been proven to be a false positive due to isometheptene presence in an analgesic prescribed during the competition.

<doc id="930118" wikidata="Q61610" url="?curid=930118" title="Ami Boué">
<text>Ami Boué (16 March 179421 November 1881) was a geologist of French Huguenot origin. Born at Hamburg, he was trained in Edinburgh and across Europe. He travelled across Europe, studying geology, as well as ethnology, and is considered to be among the first to produce a geological map of the world.

==Career==

Boué was born in Hamburg where his grandfather Jacques Chapeaurouge had settled in 1705 and established a shipping company which grew. Born in a wealthy home, Boué studied in Hamburg and Geneva before going to study medicine at Edinburgh from 1814 to 1817. Here he came under the influence of Robert Jameson, whose teachings in geology and mineralogy inspired his future career. Boué was thus led to make geological expeditions to various parts of Scotland and the Hebrides, and after taking his degree of M.D. in 1817 he settled for some years in Paris.

In 1820 he issued his &quot;Essai géologique sur l&#x27;Écosse&quot;, in which the eruptive rocks in particular were carefully described. He travelled much in Germany, Austria and southern Europe, studying various geological formations, and becoming one of the pioneers in geological research; he was one of the founders of the Société Géologique de France in 1830, and was its president in 1835. Boué married Eleonore Beinstingel in 1826 and lived for sometime in Berne and then at Vöslau. In 1841 he settled in Vienna, and became naturalized as an Austrian.

To the Imperial Academy of Sciences at Vienna he communicated important papers on the geology of the Balkan States (1859–1870), and he also published &quot;Mémoires géologiques et paléontologiques&quot; (Paris, 1832) and &quot;La Turquie d&#x27;Europe; observations sur la geographie, la géologie, l&#x27;histoire naturelle&quot;, etc. (Paris, 1840). This work was published in German under the title -- &quot;Die europäische T&#x27;ürkei&quot;—in 1890.

He was a correspondent of the Serbian Learned Society. In 1849 he published the first ethnological map of the Balkan Peninsula.

He is buried in a crypt in the Vöslau cemetery.

==Evolution==

Boué was an advocate of transmutation of species. He was influenced by the evolutionary views of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck.

He was supportive of spontaneous generation and argued that spontaneously generated organisms existed at the microscopic level between animals and plants.

==Honours==
Ami Boué Bluff on Graham Land in Antarctica and streets in Budapest, Varna, Vienna and Sofia are named after him.

<text>Herscheid is a municipality in the southern Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

==Geography==
Herscheid is located in the &quot;Ebbegebirge&quot; (&quot;Ebbe Mountains&quot;), a part of the Sauerland mountains. Altitudes in the municipality extend from 250m above sea level in the valley of the &quot;Schwarze Ahe&quot; up to the highest elevation, the high &quot;Nordhelle&quot;. The municipality covers an area of , of which 58% is forest and 33% is used agriculturally. Most of the area is protected as a nature reserve, the &quot;Naturpark Ebbegebirge&quot;.

===Neighbouring places===
* Werdohl
* Plettenberg
* Meinerzhagen
* Lüdenscheid

==History==

The first written document mentioning &quot;Hertsceido&quot; dates from 1072 in a charter from Grafschaft Abbey of Anno II, Archbishop of Cologne. However, the settlements in what is now the municipal area probably date back to the 4th century. From the 12th century till 1753 the parish of Herscheid formed a court district. During the French occupation (1806 till 1814), the &quot;Mairie Ebbe&quot; covered Herscheid and neighbouring Valbert.

The station &quot;Hüinghausen&quot; was made for narrow gauge railway.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Herscheid is above a fess abased chequy of three rows gules and argent, a demi-stag salient proper. The stag, or deer, (German &quot;Hirsch&quot;) has a double significance: it refers both to the etymological origin of the name &quot;Herscheid&quot; as &quot;area where deer live&quot; and also to the old hunting privileges formerly enjoyed here (said to have been given by one of the Counts of the Mark as reward for help in fighting in the Ebbe mountains against the episcopal state of Cologne). The red-and-white chequered fess of the Counts also appears, Herscheid having been formerly part of their territory. The coat of arms was designed by Otto Hupp, and was granted on October 17, 1935. The coat of arms is also featured on the town flag.

<doc id="930120" wikidata="Q57719" url="?curid=930120" title="Xuzhou">
<text>Xuzhou (), also known as Pengcheng () in ancient times, is a major city in northwestern Jiangsu province, China. The city, with a recorded population of 9,083,790 at the 2020 census (3,135,660 of which lived in the built-up area made of Quanshan, Gulou, Yunlong and Tongshan urban Districts and Jiawang District not being conurbated), is a national complex transport hub and an important gateway city in East China. Xuzhou is a central city of Huaihai Economic Zone and Xuzhou metropolitan area. Xuzhou is an important node city of the country&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative, and an international new energy base. Xuzhou has won titles such as the National City of Civility (全国文明城市) and the United Nations Habitat Scroll of Honour award.

The city is designated as National Famous Historical and Cultural City since 1986 for its relics, especially the terracotta armies, the Mausoleums of the princes and the art of relief of Han dynasty.

Xuzhou is a major city among the top 500 cities in the world by scientific research outputs, as tracked by the Nature Index. The city is also home to China University of Mining and Technology, the only national key university under the Project 211 in Xuzhou and other major public research universities, including Jiangsu Normal University, Xuzhou Medical College, and Xuzhou Institute of Technology.

== Romanization ==
Before the official adoption of Hanyu Pinyin, the city&#x27;s name was typically romanized as Suchow or Süchow, though it also appeared as Siu Tcheou [Fou], Hsu-chou, Hsuchow, and Hsü-chow.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The early prehistoric relics around Xuzhou are classified as Dawenkou culture system. Liulin () site together with Dadunzi () site, Huating () site, and Liangwangcheng () site correspond to the initial, middle and late stages of this culture, respectively. While the remains of sacrificial rituals performed to Tudi deity found at Qiuwan () site and Gaohuangmiao () site, both of them are in the outskirts of the city, indicate that Shang dynasty affected the area. History relates that Peng or Great Peng, the transitions from a tribe to a chiefdom contained within the boundary of the city. Peng Zu is believed to be the first chief of the ancient Peng state that was centered around Xuzhou, while the state was eventually conquered by King Wu Ding of Shang in around 1208 BC.

During the time of Western Zhou, a Huaiyi chiefdom called Xuyi or Xu rose centered around modern Xuzhou and controlled the Lower Yellow River Valley. Xuyi with its Huaiyi people fought against Zhou and its vassals at irregular intervals. Since its declining, Xuyi once moved the capital to the area of Xuzhou and populated it with people who were migrated southwards.

Pengcheng, named after the ancient Peng state that was centered around Xuzhou, a city at the junction of the ancient Bian and Si Rivers, was founded by Lü (annexed by Song later). Chu took the city in the war of 573 BCE, but ceded the city back to Song in the next year, as a coercive measure.

=== Imperial China ===
In 208 BC, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang deployed their troops into Pengcheng, where Emperor Yi of Chu later transferred his capital from Xuyi after rebel leader Xiang Liang&#x27;s death. Xiang Yu then exiled the emperor to southern China in 206 BC, the former proclaiming himself as &quot;Hegemon-King of Western Chu&quot;, and also establishing his capital in Pengcheng, until 202 BC.

During the Han dynasty, a new Chu Kingdom was established with its capital at Pengcheng. It was ruled by various imperial princes during the Western Han period (202 BC – 9 AD). Liu Jiao, the younger half-brother of Liu Bang, founder of Western Han, became the first Prince of Chu. In 154 BC, the prince Liu Wu participated in the Rebellion of the Seven Princes. However, he was defeated afterwards and Chu&#x27;s territories were greatly diminished. By the end of the second century, a prosperous Buddhist community had been settled at Pengcheng.

At the turn of the second century, Pengcheng changed hands several times among Cao Cao and his rivals before being annexed to Cao Wei in about 200. In the intervening years, the seat of Xuzhou (Xu province) was transferred from Tancheng to Xiapi, which located in the northwest of Suining. While Pengcheng became the seat later than 220.

With the rebellions of the Five Barbarians, considerable local households migrated to the south, a Liu clan from Pengcheng ascended to the gentry, its most well known descendant is Liu Yu, the Emperor Wu of Liu Song. Pengcheng was taken by the Northern dynasties later. Liu Yu recaptured the lost territory in the north of the Huai River in about 408. Xuzhou was divided into two parts: Beixuzhou (North Xuzhou) and Xuzhou (with Jingkou as its seat) in 411. North Xuzhou whose seat was Pengcheng bounded on the south by the Huai River. Beixuzhou was restored as Xuzhou a decade later, while its south counterpart was renamed Nanxuzhou (South Xuzhou). Since then, Pengcheng remained being the seat of Xuzhou until it was eliminated in the early Ming.

The raging wars inflicted upon Xuzhou until the Emperor Taizong of Tang&#x27;s enthronement in 626. Keeping the northern rebellions and warfare a distance gave Xuzhou scope for developing during the most period of the Tang dynasty. According to the &quot;Old Book of Tang&quot; and the &quot;New book of Tang&quot;, in 639, the total population of Pengcheng County, Fei County and Pei County was only 21,768, versus 205,286 in 742.

In 781, Li Na marched south to besiege Xuzhou. Although his revolt was quell soon, the halt of the transport by the Bian Canal impelled the court to secure the area.

The then prefect of Xuzhou, Zhang Jianfeng was designated as the first military governor of Xuzhou–Sizhou–Haozhou () which was headquartered in Xuzhou since 788. The title was restored and renamed Wuning () in 805, after an interval of five years. Wang Zhixing, another military governor of Wuning, established several battalions (the most notorious one among is the Silver Sword) in the Army specifically for select recruits. These soldiers not only defy military discipline but also show defiant towards the successors to Wang. In 832, Li Ting received a threatening letter prior to his induction in there, made him resigned immediately. Then Wuning suffered mutinies in 849, 859 and again in 862. Another two governors were expelled. Wang Shi was appointed, under the circumstances. He put the mutiny down by executing part of the garrison troops and disbanded the rest, which became thugs and loot later. In 864, the court declared an amnesty in the area, and promised that all thugs who willingly re-enrolled would be sent for a tour of duty in the southern, and then, presumably, returned to regular army service in the north.

Three thousand men surrendered and were sent to the south to join the two thousand former Wuning soldiers there. The breached pledge irritated them. Led by Pang Xun, some soldiers mutinied and marched back north. They have unimpeded access to the area by the winter of 868. The local civil governor refused Pang&#x27;s demand to have the hatred officers removed, and a military confrontation ensued. Thousands of local peasants joined the rebels. They took the prefectural city of Xuzhou, captured the civil governor, and killed those officers. Pang acquired a considerable following. Still, the rebellion was suppressed a year later eventually. Wuning was renamed Ganhua () with admonishment on lest the garrison to revolt again.

After the Yellow River began to change course during the Song dynasty, heavy silting at the Yellow River estuary forced the river to channel its flow into the lower Huai River tributary. The area became barren thereafter due to persistent flooding, nutrient depletion and salination of the once fertile soil.

In the first month of 1129, Nijuhun took the city after a siege of 27 days, and the then governor Wang Fu () was executed for refusing to submit. Wang&#x27;s inferior Zhao Li () rallied the remains and constructed a local militia. They recaptured the city two months later but withdrew from there strategically soon. Henceforth, Xuzhou was ruled by Jurchen over a century.

In 1232, the general Wang You (), Feng Xian () revolted, they expelled the Jurchen&#x27;s governor Tuktan. Then the Mongolian army led by Anyong (), a Han Chinese general captured Xuzhou soon. Both the general of the state of Su () Liu Anguo () and the general of Pizhou Du Zheng () yielded their owned city to Anyong. Regarding Anyong&#x27;s behave as grabbing reputation, the Mongolian general Asuru () irritated and persisted to kill him. Felt panic, Anyong sought refuge from Jurchen. The Jin dynasty resumed its ruling in Xuzhou, and it was quite transient. The serious disunity made betraying recur. In November 1233, the garrison of Xuzhou welcomed the Mongolian. Meantime, Anyong pledged loyalty to the Song dynasty. He captured the city again after the Mongolian army left. In the spring of the next year, the Mongolian commander Zhang Rong () attacked Xuzhou, Anyong drowned himself after the final defeat. The Mongolian governor of Xuzhou and Pizhou called Li Gaoge () surrendered to the Song in 1262. Then he failed and was killed after several days.

A rebellion against Yuan rose by Li Er () who was nicknamed Sesame Li in the area around Xuzhou. In the eighth month of 1351, they took the city. Toghon Temür gave an edict that they would be granted amnesty if they surrendered to the authority, in the spring of the next year. The rebels ignored that, so he agreed that Toqto to suppress the unrest. The city fell in the autumn, and the multitudes were killed by Toqto&#x27;s army afterwards. It may be the symbolically most important victory for Toqto. Thus, Xuzhou was renamed Wu&#x27;an (; literal meaning: Restoring peace by force&quot;) as a favour for him, and a stone slab celebrating his deed was erected by the court in the city.

Zhang Shicheng occupied Xuzhou as the northernmost city of his domain in 1360. The Ming forces under Xu Da, captured Xuzhou in 1366. Soon Köke Temür sent an army under General Li Er to attack Xuzhou. Fu Youde () and Lu Ju () who held the city raided them outside, most of the enemy were drowned while the remained about 270 soldiers and 500 horses were captured.

Xuzhou had a long period of prosperity during the Ming dynasty. The flourishness largely attributed to the carriage, especially by the Grand Canal, one of seven customs barriers (or customs houses, ) under the Ministry of Revenue was located in Xuzhou. It was retained until the late Qing. Korean Choe Bu affirmed that the city where he travelled by way of, hardly pale by comparison to the Jiangnan region.

As a hub for both the national courier system and the grain tribute system for several centuries, Xuzhou was of vital importance. Thus, the government of Ming established three garrison areas namely guards in the present-day area: Xuzhou guard (), Xuzhou Left guard () and Pizhou guard () for its security.

Yet, the local navigation was considerably constrained by two Rapids: the Xuzhou Rapids (), a kilometer southeast of the city, and the Lüliang Rapids (), another 24 kilometers further south. The remedy provided by the Ministry of Works is constructing the Jia Canal, which paralleled the treacherous stretch of Xuzhou. However, the canal completed in the 1600s ravaged the city. Not only it disrupted the former drainage system, but also depressed the local economy. Prior to the recession, flooding and the famines followed struck Xuzhou frequently. The worst flooding occurred in 1624: it was immersed up to 1 &quot;zhang&quot; and 3 &quot;chi&quot; (about 4m) within the city.

After the Hongguang Emperor enthroned in Nanjing, the court designated four defense areas along the southern bank of the Yellow River () to repulse the Qing armies. While the former bandit general, Gao Jie () was designated to take the crucial forward position at Xuzhou by Shi Kefa. But the assassination of Gao seriously reduced the court&#x27;s capacity to deal with challenges from Qing. Gao&#x27;s successor was Li Chengdong (). Being aware of forthcoming attack, Li deserted Xuzhou in the early summer of 1645. Then Dodo&#x27;s army captured the city.

The seismic activity of the Tancheng earthquake in 1688 was also involved Xuzhou. &quot;More than half the houses of the city were ruined&quot; and &quot;led to enormous deaths&quot;, according to the gazetteer.

In the 1850s, the Yellow River shifted its course from the southern to the northern side of the Shandong peninsula, the process caused serious floods and famine in Xuzhou, and almost made the waterway system within the prefecture defunct.

=== Modern China ===

Zhang Xun and his remaining army fled to Xuzhou after the Revolution of 1911. They entered the city on 5 December. The Nanking Government sent three armies to attack Xuzhou. In the middle of February 1912, Zhang evacuated the city and moved north after he was defeated.

Since the Second Revolution began, Xuzhou became a front-line city. The Revolutionary Army fared badly as it advanced from there towards the north, and a rout ensued. Then the Beiyang Army captured the city on 24 July. Thereafter, Zhang Xun made Xuzhou his base. he convened four meetings of the Beiyang leadership. Involved the stalemate among Li Yuanhong and Duan Qirui in 1917, he marched on Beijing with a troop in June. His failure spread and caused a terrible wave of theft and arson committed by his garrisons later in Xuzhou in July.

The Zhili clique dominated Xuzhou by 1924. In the autumn of this year, the Second Zhili–Fengtian War broke out, Zhang Zongchang who supported the Fengtian clique seized the city with his thirty thousand soldiers. Sun Chuanfang led a coalition of forces to sortie the Fengtian Army in October 1925. They occupied the city on 8 November. As the leader of the Northern Expedition, Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Xuzhou on 17 June 1927. He conferred with Feng Yuxiang and other Kuomintang officers on 20 June, Feng was courted by Nanjing. Then Sun Chuanfang and Zhang Zongchang began to fight in unison against the Nationalist government. They captured the city on 24 June. The fall of Xuzhou aroused public outrage, Chiang &#x27;s first resignation ensued. On 16 December, Nanjing force took the area again.

The area was the main site both of the Battle of Xuzhou in 1938 against the Japanese Army in the Second Sino-Japanese War and of the battle in the Chinese Civil War, the Huaihai Campaign in 1948–49.

On 19 May 1938, Chiang gave the order to abandon Xuzhou, then Japanese military took control of the city.

The Administrative Commission of the Su-Huai Special Region () was established in January 1942, with its seat at Xuzhou. It was replaced by a new puppet province, Huaihai (). Hao Pengju was appointed as the governor.

After the Second Sino-Japanese War, the troop under He Zhuguo entered Xuzhou on 6 September. The Xuzhou Pacification Commission () was founded in the end of year, and Gu Zhutong was appointed as the Chief. It was disbanded when the Army Command Headquarters of transferred to Xuzhou on 5 March 1947. Meantime, a military tribunal attached to the commission was organized to sentence 25 Japanese soldiers.

Guo Yingqiu as the representative of the CPC went to Xuzhou to negotiate a regional truce, since 10 February 1946. On 2 March, the &quot;Committee of Three&quot;, comprising George Marshall, Zhang Zhizhong and Zhou Enlai arrived for the ceasefire in Central China. Still, the KMT and the CPC came into conflict soon. The CPC revealed that Yasuji Okamura assisted the KMT in the local warfare against the PLA.

The Huaihai was the a critical of the trinity of the major campaigns during the Chinese Civil War. Fighting centred around the city of Xuzhou, seat of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters () established on 6 June 1948. It turned into a fiasco, which led to the fall of the Nationalist Chinese capital Nanjing. The CPC controlled the city on 1 December.

Then Xuzhou (the old urban area) was made a part of Shandong province temporarily, together with the rest area of the northern Jiangsu along the Longhai Railway. The city was returned to Jiangsu as the province was restored in 1953.

The railways in Xuzhou bore the brunt of the transporting muddle in the 1970s, Beijing was concerned with the issue in 1974. Thus, the then Minister of Railways, Wan Li went to Xuzhou to inspect and rectify in March. It was deemed as a breakthrough on restoring order later.

On April 22, 1993, Xuzhou was ratified as a &quot;Larger Municipality&quot; with legislative power by the State Council.

Most of the area is located in the Xu-Huai Alluvial Plain, the southeast part of the North China Plain.

The confluence of the former Si River and the former Bian Canal was situated northeast of ancient Xuzhou city. The city and its hinterland were areas liable to severe flooding from the Yellow River since the tenth century. In 1194, the Yellow River changed its course to join the Si River, a former tributary of the Huai. From then on, the Yellow River flowed along the north of the walled city until diverting in 1855.

Historically, Xuzhou and the surrounding regions were a predominantly agricultural area. Its arable land was severely depleted by the changes in the course of the Yellow River since the mid 11th century, and the drought-resistant crops: wheat, sorghum, soybean, maize and potato, became the local staples. Besides, cotton, peanut, tobacco and sesame also grew in low-yield. The local mining traces it origins to an iron mine, Liguo. It was exploited since Han dynasty, and managed by a particular bureau in Song. And the city had major coal reserves of the province. Local coaling began by the 1070s, according to a lyric of the then governor Su Shi. Copper smelting in this area supposedly started in the Three Kingdoms era.

The city astride the old course of the Grand Canal had been through several transitory periods of prosperity, before the grain tribute system was abolished in 1855. It remained being economically backward in the 1940s for wars, and a few people engaged in industrial sectors.

Later the CPC positioned the city as a region of coal mining and heavy industry. Its dominant sectors are machinery, energy and food production nowadays. The construction machinery manufacturer XCMG is the largest company based in Xuzhou. It was the world&#x27;s tenth-largest construction equipment maker measured by 2011 revenues, and the third-largest based in China (after Sany and Zoomlion).

<text>The Nizhnyaya Tunguska (, meaning &quot;Lower Tunguska&quot;) is a river in Siberia, Russia, that flows through the Irkutsk Oblast and the Krasnoyarsk Krai. The river is a right tributary of the Yenisey joining it at Turukhansk (see Siberian River Routes). The ice-free period on the Nizhnyaya Tunguska starts in mid-June and ends in the first half of October. The river forms the western limit of the Lena Plateau.

==Hydrography==
The Nizhnyaya Tunguska is the second largest right tributary of the Yenisey, and joins it near the town of Turukhansk. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . According to the character of the stream, constitution of the river&#x27;s valley and its shores, it can be divided into two parts: the first one starts at the source of the river and continues down to the village (formerly Preobrazhenskoye) and the second section of the river lies downstream of this village in a canyon-like relief.

===Upper stream===
The upper part of Nizhnyaya Tunguska is long and follows a wide valley with flat slopes that was formed by sand and clay deposits. The speed of flow at rafts reaches and drops significantly as the river&#x27;s channel stretches.

This section of river has a meandering channel that closely approaches the Lena, another great Siberian river. The minimum distance between them is as short as in the neighbourhood of Kirensk town. All of the upper course of Nizhnyaya Tunguska is within the Irkutsk Oblast.

===Lower stream===
Downstream of Preobrazhenskoye village Nizhnyaya Tunguska flows across the Tunguska Plateau of the Central Siberian Plateau in a narrow and deep valley with high, often rocky shores. The entire landscape here has volcanic origins, the relief alters the flow of Lower Tunguska into a westerly direction. The river channel frequently has lake-like widenings with lengths up to and longer. The locations with close approaches of crystalline layers create numerous rapids on the river. The most significant of them have names such as: &quot;Sakko&quot;, &quot;Vivinsky&quot;, &quot;Uchamsky&quot; and &quot;Bolshoy&quot; (, &quot;Big&quot;). The rapids on the river has relatively high speeds of water flux reaching . In some places downstream of the rapids the river channel becomes very deep with maximum depths of . In the river&#x27;s lowest flow, downstream of join with its tributary river Severnaya, Nizhnyaya Tunguska runs between limestone rocks, which steeply rise from the water. The speeds of flow here grow to .

The channel and water flow of the river&#x27;s lower stream has its own distinguishing features, which can be seen in some places at Lower Tunguska, including the following:
* The strips of stones with sizes , which stretch near water along the shore line. This peculiar feature of Arctic stony rivers with the local name &quot;bechevnik&quot;, from the Russian name for &quot;towpath&quot;, is formed during every period of ice drift and river inundation at spring. At some locations these sorts of pebbles are polished and pressed together to the extent that they create a cobbled road of their own kind.
* The slopes of the river canyon during its evolution underwent stone avalanches that formed stone runs of individual rocks as big as in diameter. These slide-slopes have a local name, &quot;korga&quot; (&quot;корга&quot;), and create zones of calm backwater downstream.
* The stream in the channel of the Nizhnyaya Tunguska sometimes forms whirlpools. They originate downstream of cliffs which channels flow to the opposite shore. These whirlpools can reach depths to and occur most often during high-water periods in early summer.

===Tributaries===
The most significant tributaries of Nizhnyaya Tunguska are the rivers entering from the right: Yeyka, Kochechum, Yambukan, Vivi, Tutonchana, Erachimo, and Severnaya. Entering from the left are the Nepa, , Teteya, Ilimpeya, Nidym, Taymura, and Uchami. The most prominent tributary is Kochechum, which joins the main stem from the north near Tura. The average annual discharge of the Kochechum is , and its basin covers nearly .

On the whole, the right tributaries of Nizhnyaya Tunguska dominate over the left and add more water. The river has no big lakes in its basin; the biggest is Vivi with a surface area of . Inflows to the Nizhnyaya Tunguska are strongly seasonal.

==Hydrology==
The value of average water discharge of Nizhnyaya Tunguska gives it eleventh place amongst largest rivers of Russia. The annual water discharge at the river&#x27;s mouth is equal to . The minimum value observed in 1967 was ; the maximum was in 1974 or, respectively, for the estuary of the river it was about and about . The water supply of the river is from melting snow and summer rains. During winter season Nizhnyaya Tunguska contains little water as its basin lies in the region of permafrost and it has no subterranean water sources. According hydrological observations during 52 years, the minimum average monthly discharge was in March 1969—it was exceptionally dry winter—and the maximum value corresponds to June 1959 and was The diagram below contains mean values of monthly average discharges calculated on the base of a 52-year-long period of observations at hydrological station &quot;Bolshoy Porog&quot; (фактория Большой Порог, Bolshoy Porog factory).


Seventy-three per cent of the entire annual water yield occurs during the spring–summer season. The amplitude of the water-level variations in the lower stream of Nizhnyaya Tunguska is the highest among all notable rivers of Russia. At narrow places in the river channel, ice jams during its seasonal drift, and this creates temporary dams that block normal water flow and raise water levels up to above the mean value. The summer break-up and drifting of ice passes very violently; it leaves traces in the form of torn-apart uprooted trees and polished rocks. During some days of spring freshets the river&#x27;s discharge can peak at , and it supplies 50 to 60 per cent of the water volume to the lower stream of the Yenisey in the time of its seasonal inundation.

==Economy==
The channel of Nizhnyaya Tunguska with its tributaries constitutes dense network of rivers and creeks which creates convenient summer pathways through the wide rifted valley of Eastern Siberia. Historically, the river was used as a route for the fur trade, fishery, for transportation of goods and mineral resources. Hunting and fur trade is still a significant part of the local economy.

===Shipping===
Navigation on the river is difficult because of a number of rifts, rapids and whirlpools. The passage of large ships and barges is possible during the spring inundation, and rainy weather during particular years allows short periods of navigation at the end of summer or the start of autumn. The most problematic for the safe navigation of ships are the rapids &quot;Bolshoy&quot;, which are from the river&#x27;s mouth. In 1927 the first steamship passed this rapids and it is considered to be the start of modern navigation on the river from Turukhansk to Tura. As of 2010 the shipping routes of Yenisey River Steamship Lines () includes the village Kislokan, from the estuary. Timber rafting is possible throughout entire course of the river.

It was suggested (and some research was done) in 1911 to build a canal joining the Lena and Nizhnyaya Tunguska rivers in the neighbourhood of Kirensk. Near this locality the rivers are separated by no more than , but here the Nizhnyaya Tunguska is not navigable and flows at an elevation of above sea level, whereas the Lena flows at an elevation of . In the beginning of 20th century the canal project was considered inexpedient due to its complexity and high cost.

===Planned damming===
Plans to dam the river existed since the early Soviet period. These plans were the subject of criticism by various ecologists. Construction of the dams also became impossible after disintegration of Soviet Union due to economic reasons. In 2005–10 the interest to this project and the discussion of it revived to some extent. According news media the construction of the Turukhanskaya hydroelectric powerplant would begin as soon as in 2010. Since the precise date is unknown, a more likely start-up is between 2010 and 2020.

After completion of this project Nizhnyaya Tunguska will be dammed, flooding about of forest and tundra (roughly the size of Lebanon or the islands of Hawaii), some of which contains buried nuclear waste, and displacing the indigenous Evenk population. The cost of the plant is estimated at $13 billion dollars, which includes costs of electric power lines. The plant will be built and operated by RusHydro in the Krasnoyarsk region, and the electricity will be channeled to European Russia via a system of power lines.

==Notable facts==
* The colonisation history of Western Siberia by Russians since 17th and 18th centuries was reflected in various names for the river at different times. At some periods it was called Troitskaya Tunguska (), Monastyrskaya Tunguska () and Mangaseyan Tunguska (, see Mangaseya).
* In literature, the river Nizhnyaya Tunguska is described in the novel &quot;Gloomy River&quot; by Vyacheslav Shishkov. This writer of the first half of the 20th century visited the river during an expedition in 1911; the name &quot;Gloomy River&quot; was taken from a Siberian song.
* Existing sources indicate that the annual average discharge of water at mouth of its tributary Severnaya is equal to . As this river joins Nizhnyaya Tunguska downstream of hydrological station &quot;Bolshoy Porog&quot; it means that the known average discharge at mouth of Nizhnyaya Tunguska is significantly underestimated. It must be in the range of .

<doc id="930128" wikidata="Q1121492" url="?curid=930128" title="Directive (programming)">
<text>In computer programming, a directive or pragma (from &quot;pragmatic&quot;) is a language construct that specifies how a compiler (or other translator) should process its input. Depending on the programming language, directives may or may not be part of the grammar of the language and may vary from compiler to compiler. They can be processed by a preprocessor to specify compiler behavior, or function as a form of in-band parameterization.

In some cases directives specify global behavior, while in other cases they only affect a local section, such as a block of programming code. In some cases, such as some C programs, directives are optional compiler hints and may be ignored, but normally they are prescriptive and must be followed. However, a directive does not perform any action in the language itself, but rather only a change in the behavior of the compiler.

This term could be used to refer to proprietary third-party tags and commands (or markup) embedded in code that result in additional executable processing that extend the existing compiler, assembler and language constructs present in the development environment. The term &quot;directive&quot; is also applied in a variety of ways that are similar to the term &quot;command&quot;.

==The C preprocessor==
In C and C++, the language supports a simple macro preprocessor. Source lines that should be handled by the preprocessor, such as codice_1 and codice_2 are referred to as &quot;preprocessor directives&quot;.

Syntactic constructs similar to C&#x27;s preprocessor directives, such as C#&#x27;s codice_3, are also typically called &quot;directives&quot;, although in these cases there may not be any real preprocessing phase involved.

All preprocessor commands begin with a hash symbol (#) with the exception of the keywords codice_4, codice_5 and codice_6 in C++ (handled by the preprocessor prior to C++26).

==History==
Directives date to JOVIAL.
COBOL Had a COPY directive.

In ALGOL 68, directives are known as pragmats (from &quot;pragmatic&quot;), and denoted pragmat or pr; in newer languages, notably C, this has been abbreviated to &quot;pragma&quot; (no &#x27;t&#x27;).

A common use of pragmats in ALGOL 68 is in specifying a stropping regime, meaning &quot;how keywords are indicated&quot;. Various such directives follow, specifying the POINT, UPPER, RES (reserved), or quote regimes. Note the use of stropping for the pragmat keyword itself (abbreviated pr), either in the POINT or quote regimes:
 .PR POINT .PR
 .PR UPPER .PR
 .PR RES .PR
 &#x27;pr&#x27; quote &#x27;pr&#x27;

Today directives are best known in the C language, of early 1970s vintage, and continued through the current C99 standard, where they are either instructions to the C preprocessor, or, in the form of codice_7, directives to the compiler itself. They are also used to some degree in more modern languages; see below.

==Other languages==
* In Ada, compiler directives are called pragmas (short for &quot;pragmatic information&quot;).
* In Common Lisp, directives are called declarations, and are specified using the codice_8 construct (also codice_9 or codice_10). With one exception, declarations are optional, and do not affect the semantics of the program. The one exception is codice_11, which must be specified where appropriate.
* In Turbo Pascal, directives are called significant comments, because in the language grammar they follow the same syntax as comments. In Turbo Pascal, a significant comment is a comment whose first character is a dollar sign and whose second character is a letter; for example, the equivalent of C&#x27;s codice_12 directive is the significant comment codice_13.
* In Perl, the keyword &quot;codice_14&quot;, which imports modules, can also be used to specify directives, such as codice_15 or codice_16.
* Haskell pragmas are specified using a specialized comment syntax, e.g. codice_17.
* PHP uses the directive codice_18.
* Python has two directives – codice_19 (defined in PEP 236 -- Back to the __future__), which changes language features (and uses the existing module import syntax, as in Perl), and the codice_20 directive (in a comment) to specify the encoding of a source code file (defined in PEP 263 -- Defining Python Source Code Encodings). A more general directive statement was proposed and rejected in PEP 244 -- The `directive&#x27; statement; these all date to 2001.
* ECMAScript also adopts the codice_14 syntax for directives, with the difference that pragmas are declared as string literals (e.g. codice_22, or codice_23), rather than a function call.
*In Visual Basic, the keyword &quot;codice_24&quot; is used for directives:
** codice_25 - When on disallows implicit declaration of variables at first use requiring explicit declaration beforehand. 
** codice_26 - Results in string comparisons based on a sort order derived from the internal binary representations of the characters - e.g. for the English/European code page (ANSI 1252) A &lt; B &lt; E &lt; Z &lt; a &lt; b &lt; e &lt; z &lt; À &lt; Ê &lt; Ø &lt; à &lt; ê &lt; ø. Affects intrinsic operators (e.g. =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;), the Select Case block, and VB runtime library string functions (e.g. InStr).
** codice_27 - Results in string comparisons based on a case-insensitive text sort order determined by your system&#x27;s locale - e.g. for the English/European code page (ANSI 1252) (A=a) &lt; (À = à) &lt; (B=b) &lt; (E=e) &lt; (Ê = ê) &lt; (Z=z) &lt; (Ø = ø). Affects intrinsic operators (e.g. =, &lt;&gt;, &lt;, &gt;), the Select Case block, and VB runtime library string functions (e.g. InStr).
** codice_28 - When on disallows:
*** typeless programming - where declarations which lack an explicit type are implicitly typed as Object.
*** late-binding (i.e. dynamic dispatch to CLR, DLR, and COM objects) on values statically typed as Object.
*** implicit narrowing conversions - requiring all conversions to narrower types (e.g. from Long to Integer, Object to String, Control to TextBox) be explicit in code using conversion operators (e.g. CInt, DirectCast, CType).
** codice_29 - When on enables the compiler to infer the type of local variables from their initializers.
* In Ruby, interpreter directives are referred to as pragmas and are specified by top-of-file comments that follow a codice_30 notation. For example, codice_31 indicates that the file is encoded via the UTF-8 character encoding.
*In C#, compiler directives are called pre-processing directives. There are a number of different compiler directives including #pragma, which is specifically used to control compiler warnings and debugger checksums.
* The SQLite DBMS includes a PRAGMA directive that is used to introduce commands that are not compatible with other DBMS.
* In Solidity, compiler directives are called pragmas, and are specified using the `pragma` keyword.

===Assembly language===
* In assembly language, directives, also referred to as pseudo-operations or &quot;pseudo-ops&quot;, generally specify such information as the target machine, mark separations between code sections, define and change assembly-time variables, define macros, designate conditional and repeated code, define reserved memory areas, and so on. Some, but not all, assemblers use a specific syntax to differentiate pseudo-ops from instruction mnemonics, such as prefacing the pseudo-op with a period, such as the pseudo-op codice_32, which might direct the assembler to stop assembling code.
===PL/SQL===
* Oracle Corporation&#x27;s PL/SQL procedural language includes a set of compiler directives, known as &quot;pragmas&quot;.

<doc id="930136" wikidata="Q3142800" url="?curid=930136" title="Source (journalism)">
<text>In journalism, a source is a person, publication, or knowledge of other record or document that gives timely information. Outside journalism, sources are sometimes known as &quot;news sources&quot;. Examples of sources include official records, publications or broadcasts, officials in government or business, organizations or corporations, witnesses of crime, accidents or other events, and people involved with or affected by a news event or issue.

According to Shoemaker (1996) and McQuail (1994), there are a multitude of factors that tend to condition the acceptance of sources as bona fide by investigative journalists. Reporters are expected to develop and cultivate sources, especially if they regularly cover a specific topic, known as a &quot;beat&quot;. Beat reporters must, however, be cautious of becoming too close to their sources. Reporters often, but not always, give greater leeway to sources with little experience. For example, sometimes a person will say they don&#x27;t want to talk, and then proceed to talk; if that person is not a public figure, reporters are less likely to use that information. Journalists are also encouraged to be skeptical without being cynical, as per the saying &quot;If your mother says she loves you, check it out,&quot; popularized by the City News Bureau of Chicago. As a rule of thumb, but especially when reporting on controversy, reporters are expected to use multiple sources.

== Ethical guidelines ==

===Confidential information===

A journalist may agree to discuss a topic &quot;off the record&quot;. According to the Poynter Institute, if a reporter agrees to an off-the-record conversation, &quot;the ethical thing to do is not report or even repeat that information&quot;.

Unlike a non-disclosure agreement (NDA), an agreement to talk off the record has no legal force. Unlike a non-disclosure agreement, it lacks one or more of the elements that make up a binding contract. However, like a non-disclosure agreement, a source may be able to use contract law to control the use of the information provided or protect their privacy.

Some journalists and news organizations have policies against accepting information &quot;off the record&quot; because they believe it interferes with their ability to report truthfully, or because they suspect it may be intended to mislead them or the public. Some people believe it is unethical for a source to give information off the record.

Even if writers cannot report certain information directly, they can use &quot;off the record&quot; information to uncover related facts, or to find other sources who are willing to speak on the record. This is especially useful in investigative journalism. Information about a surprise event or breaking news, whether on or off the record, is known as a &quot;tip-off&quot;. Information that leads to the uncovering of more interesting information is called a &quot;lead&quot;.

=== Anonymous source ===
The identity of anonymous sources is sometimes revealed to senior editors or a news organization&#x27;s lawyers, who would be considered bound by the same confidentiality as the journalist. (Lawyers are generally protected from subpoena in these cases by attorney–client privilege.) Legal staff may need to give counsel about whether it is advisable to publish certain information, or about court proceedings that may attempt to learn confidential information. Senior editors are in the loop to prevent reporters from fabricating non-existent anonymous sources and to provide a second opinion about how to use the information obtained, how to or how not to identify sources, and whether other options should be pursued.

The use of anonymous sources has always been controversial. Some news outlets insist that anonymous sources are the only way to obtain certain information, while others prohibit the use of unnamed sources at all times. News organizations may impose safeguards, such as requiring that information from an anonymous source be corroborated by a second source before it can be printed.

Prominent reports based on anonymous sources have sometimes been proven to be incorrect. For instance, much of the O. J. Simpson reporting from unnamed sources was later deemed inaccurate. &quot;Newsweek&quot; retracted a story about a Qur&#x27;an allegedly being flushed down a toilet—the story had been based upon one unnamed military source.

After the embarrassment, a news organization will often &quot;clamp down&quot; on the guidelines for using unnamed sources, but those guidelines are often forgotten after the scandal dies down. One study found that large newspapers&#x27; use of anonymous sources dropped dramatically between 2003 and 2004. The Project for Excellence in Journalism, a research group, found use of anonymous sources dropped from 29 percent of all articles in 2003 to just seven percent in 2004, following widespread embarrassment of media after the Bush administration claims that Iraq had WMDs were found to be without basis.

===Sex with sources===
In the U.S., this practice is generally not well seen. However, lengthy lists of reporters&#x27; sexual involvement with sources were published by &quot;American Journalism Review&quot; and by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

===Not on tape===

Whether in a formal, sit-down interview setting or an impromptu meeting on the street, some sources request that all or part of the encounter not be captured in an audio or video recording (&quot;tape&quot;), but continue speaking to the reporter. As long as the interview is not confidential, the reporter may report the information given by the source, even repeating direct quotes (perhaps scribbled on a notepad or recalled from memory). This often shows up in broadcasts as &quot;John Brown declined to be interviewed on camera, but said&quot; or simply &quot;a spokesperson said&quot;.

Some interview subjects are uncomfortable being recorded. Some are afraid they will be inarticulate or feel embarrassed if the interview is broadcast. Others might be uncooperative or distrust the motives or competence of the journalist, and wish to prevent them from being able to broadcast an unflattering sound bite or part of the interview out of context. Professional public relations officers know that having the reporter repeat their words, rather than being heard directly on the air, will blunt the effect of their words. By refusing to be taped or on the air, a person avoids having an audience see or hear them being uncomfortable (if they have unpleasant news); it also permits the individual to be anonymous or identified only by title.

==Attribution==

In journalism, attribution is the identification of the source of reported information. Journalists&#x27; ethical codes normally address the issue of attribution, which is sensitive because in the course of their work, journalists may receive information from sources who wish to remain anonymous. In investigative journalism, important news stories often depend on such information. For example, the Watergate scandal which led to the downfall of U.S. president Richard Nixon was in part exposed by information revealed by an anonymous source (&quot;Deep Throat&quot;) to investigative reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein.

===Ethics===

Divulging the identity of a confidential source is frowned upon by groups representing journalists in many democracies. In many countries, journalists have no special legal status, and may be required to divulge their sources in the course of a criminal investigation, as any other citizen would be. Even in jurisdictions that grant journalists special legal protections, journalists are typically required to testify if they bear witness to a crime.

Journalists defend the use of anonymous sources for a variety of reasons:
* Access. Some sources refuse to share stories without the shield of anonymity, including many government officials.
* Protection from reprisal or punishment. Other sources are concerned about reprisal or punishment as a result of sharing information with journalists.
* Illegal activity. Sources which are engaged in illegal activity are usually reluctant to be named in order to avoid self-incrimination. This includes sources which are leaking classified information or details of court proceedings which are sealed from the public.

The use of anonymous sources is also criticized by some journalists and government officials:
* Unreliability. It is difficult for a reader to evaluate the reliability and neutrality of a source they cannot identify, and the reliability of the news as a whole is reduced when it relies upon information from anonymous sources.
* Misinformation and propaganda. Anonymous sources may be reluctant to be identified because the information they are sharing is uncertain or known to them to be untrue, but they want attention or to spread propaganda via the press, such as in the case of the Iraqi aluminum tubes, where tubes known to be useless for uranium refinement were presented as evidence of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s nuclear weapons program by anonymous sources in the U.S. intelligence community in order to build public support for an attack on Iraq. It may also be used to attack political enemies and present opinions as facts. Several journalists, including Paul Carr, have argued that if an off-the-record briefing is a deliberate lie journalists should feel permitted to name the source. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; identified a source who had offered a story in an attempt to discredit media and to distract from the issue at hand with respect to a case of sexual impropriety. Whistle blower Edward Snowden posted on twitter, the 1983 Vietnam Reconsidered Conference (USC), interview of former CIA officer Frank Snepp in which he discusses how the CIA planted misinformation about the Vietnam War. Snepp&#x27;s planted stories were published in major US publications including The New York Times, The New Yorker, the Los Angeles Times, and Chicago Daily News.
* Illegal activity. The use of anonymous sources encourages some sources to divulge information which it is illegal for them to divulge, such as the details of a legal settlement, grand jury testimony, or classified information. This information is illegal to disclose for reasons such as national security, protecting witnesses, preventing slander and libel, and ending lawsuits without lengthy, expensive trials and encouraging people to disclose such information defeats the purpose of the disclosure being illegal. In some cases, a reporter may encourage a source to disclose classified information, resulting in accusations of espionage.
* Fabricated sources. A journalist may fabricate a news story and ascribe the information to anonymous sources to fabricate news, create false detail for a news story, commit plagiarism, or protect themselves from accusations of libel.

===Speaking terms===

There are several categories of &quot;speaking terms&quot; (agreements concerning attribution) that cover information conveyed in conversations with journalists. In the UK the following conventions are generally accepted:

* &quot;On the record&quot;: all that is said can be quoted and attributed.
* &quot;Unattributable&quot;: what is said can be reported but not attributed.
* &quot;Off the record&quot;: the information is provided to inform a decision or provide a confidential explanation, not for publication.

However, confusion over the precise meaning of &quot;unattributable&quot; and &quot;off-the-record&quot; has led to more detailed formulations:

<text>Nicholas Nickleby, or The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, is the third novel by English author Charles Dickens, originally published as a serial from 1838 to 1839. The character of Nickleby is a young man who must support his mother and sister after his father dies.

==Background==
&quot;The Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby, Containing a Faithful Account of the Fortunes, Misfortunes, Uprisings, Downfallings, and Complete Career of the Nickleby Family&quot; saw Dickens return to his favourite publishers and to the format that proved so successful with &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot;. The story first appeared in monthly parts, after which it was issued in one volume. Dickens began writing &quot;Nickleby&quot; while still working on &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

==Plot==
Following the death of his father, Nicholas Nickleby, his mother, and sister Kate are left destitute and seek help from their wealthy, cold-hearted uncle Ralph Nickleby in London. Ralph despises Nicholas and secures him a teaching position at Dotheboys Hall, a Yorkshire boarding school run by the cruel Wackford Squeers, who abuses and starves his pupils. Nicholas befriends Smike, a mistreated servant boy, but flees after violently defending Smike from Squeers. The pair escape to London, aided by the sympathetic John Browdie.

Meanwhile, Ralph forces Kate and her mother into squalid lodgings and manipulates Kate into working for a milliner, where she endures humiliation. Ralph further exploits Kate by parading her before his dissolute associates, including Sir Mulberry Hawk, who harasses her. When Kate resists, Ralph threatens to withdraw support.

In London, Nicholas, aided by Ralph’s clerk Newman Noggs, confronts his uncle over false accusations from Squeers’ daughter Fanny. Ralph disowns them, prompting Nicholas to leave with Smike. They join Vincent Crummles’ theatrical troupe, achieving temporary success. Meanwhile, Kate, fired after a workplace rivalry, becomes a companion to socialite Mrs. Wittiterly but faces further harassment from Hawk. Noggs alerts Nicholas, who returns to protect Kate.

Nicholas thwarts Hawk’s advances, leading to a carriage accident that injures Hawk. Ralph loses money owed by Verisopht, intensifying his vendetta. Nicholas secures employment with the benevolent Cheeryble brothers, who house the family. Smike, now ill, is targeted by Squeers and Ralph, who conspire to kidnap him, but Smike is rescued by Browdie.

Nicholas falls for Madeline Bray, a penniless artist unknowingly ensnared in Ralph’s scheme. Ralph and miser Arthur Gride plot to force Madeline into marrying Gride to claim her inheritance. Nicholas intervenes, and Madeline’s father dies repentant, nullifying the marriage.

Smike, revealed to be Ralph’s estranged son through the confession of Ralph’s former clerk Brooker, succumbs to tuberculosis. Grief-stricken and confronted by his role in Smike’s suffering, Ralph commits suicide. Squeers is arrested and transported to Australia, while Dotheboys Hall is abandoned.

The Nicklebys, now prosperous, return to Devonshire. Nicholas marries Madeline; Kate weds the Cheerybles’ nephew Frank. The family mourns Smike but finds contentment, supported by allies like Noggs and Miss La Creevy. Ralph’s fortune is forfeited, and justice prevails for the exploited.

==Major characters==
As in most of Dickens&#x27;s works, there is a sprawling number of characters in the book. The major characters in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; include:

===The Nickleby family===
* Nicholas Nickleby: The hero of the novel. His father has died and left Nicholas and his family penniless. Nicholas is honest and steadfast, but his youth and inexperience of the world can lead him to be violent, naïve, and emotional. In his preface to the novel, Dickens writes, &quot;There is only one other point, on which I would desire to offer a remark. If Nicholas be not always found to be blameless or agreeable, he is not always intended to appear so. He is a young man of an impetuous temper and of little or no experience; and I saw no reason why such a hero should be lifted out of nature.&quot; He devotes himself primarily to his friends and family and fiercely defies those who wrong the ones he loves.
* Ralph Nickleby: The book&#x27;s principal antagonist, Nicholas&#x27;s uncle. He seems to care about nothing but money and takes an immediate dislike to the idealistic Nicholas; however, he does harbour something of a soft spot for Kate. Ralph&#x27;s anger at Nicholas&#x27;s beating of Wackford Squeers leads to a serious rift with his nephew, and after Nicholas interferes with his machinations several more times, Ralph schemes to deliberately hurt and humiliate Nicholas; but the only man Ralph ends up destroying is himself. When it is revealed that Smike was his son, and that the boy died hating him, he takes his own life. He dies without a will, and his family refuses to take his property, so his hard-earned fortune is taken by the Crown and lost.
* Catherine &quot;Kate&quot; Nickleby: Nicholas&#x27;s younger sister. Kate is a fairly passive character, typical of Dickensian women, but she shares some of her brother&#x27;s fortitude and strong will. She does not blanch at hard labour to earn her keep, and defends herself against the lecherous Sir Mulberry Hawk. She finds well-deserved happiness with Frank Cheeryble.
* Mrs. Catherine Nickleby: Nicholas and Kate&#x27;s mother, who provides much of the novel&#x27;s comic relief. The muddleheaded Mrs. Nickleby often does not see the true evil her children encounter until it is directly pointed out to her, and her obtuseness occasionally worsens her children&#x27;s predicaments. She is stubborn, prone to long digressions on irrelevant or unimportant topics and unrealistic fantasies, and displays an often vague grasp of what is going on around her.

===Associates of Ralph Nickleby===
*Newman Noggs: Ralph&#x27;s clerk, who becomes Nicholas&#x27;s devoted friend. He was once a gentleman but lost his money and went bankrupt. He is an alcoholic, and his general good nature and insight into human nature is hidden under a veneer of irrational tics and erratic behaviour.
* Sir Mulberry Hawk: A lecherous nobleman who has taken Lord Verisopht under his wing. One of the most truly evil characters in the novel, he forces himself upon Kate and pursues her solely to humiliate her after she rejects him. He is beaten by Nicholas, and swears revenge, but is prevented in this by Lord Verisopht. He kills Verisopht in a duel and must flee to France, putting a stop to his plans of revenge. He lives abroad in luxury until he runs out of money, and eventually returns to England and dies in debtors&#x27; prison.
*Lord Frederick Verisopht: Hawk&#x27;s friend and dupe, a rich young nobleman. He owes both Ralph and Sir Mulberry vast sums of money. He becomes infatuated with Kate and is manipulated by Hawk into finding her whereabouts. After Nicholas confronts them in a coffeehouse, Lord Frederick realises the shame of his behaviour and threatens Hawk if he attempts retaliation for the injuries Nicholas caused him. This quarrel eventually leads to a physical fight, which results in a duel in which Lord Frederick is killed. 
*Mr Pluck and Mr Pyke: Hangers-on to Hawk and Verisopht. They are never seen apart and are quite indistinguishable from one another. Pluck and Pyke are intelligent, sly and dapper, perfect tools to do Hawk&#x27;s dirty work for him.
*Arthur Gride: An elderly associate of Ralph. A miser, he lives in a large, empty house extremely frugally, despite his vast wealth. He gains possession of the will of Madeline&#x27;s grandfather, and attempts to cheat her out of her fortune by marrying her. He is cowardly, servile and greedy, with no redeeming characteristics whatsoever (although he does know something about romantic feelings). He alone among Ralph&#x27;s conspirators escapes legal punishment, but he is eventually murdered by burglars, who have heard rumours of his vast wealth.
*Peg Sliderskew: Gride&#x27;s elderly housekeeper. Illiterate, very deaf, and becoming senile, she ends up playing a large part in the denouement when she steals a number of papers from Gride, including Madeline&#x27;s grandfather&#x27;s will.
*Brooker: An old beggar. A mysterious figure who appears several times during the novel. We eventually find out that he was formerly Ralph&#x27;s clerk. He was responsible for bringing Ralph&#x27;s son (Smike) to Dotheboys Hall. An ex-convict, he returns to extort money from Ralph with the information that his son is alive. When that fails, he goes to Noggs, and eventually brings his story to light. In the epilogue, it is mentioned that he dies repentant of his crimes.

===Yorkshire===
*Smike: A poor drudge living in Squeers&#x27;s &quot;care&quot;. About 18 years old, Smike is a pathetic figure, perpetually ill and dim-witted, who has been in Squeers&#x27;s care since he was very young. Nicholas gives him the courage to run away, but when that fails Nicholas saves him and the two become travelling companions and close friends. He falls in love with Kate, but his heart is broken when she falls in love with Frank Cheeryble. After Smike dies peacefully of &quot;a dread disease&quot; (tuberculosis), it is revealed that he is Ralph Nickleby&#x27;s son, and thus first cousin to Nicholas and to Kate.
*Wackford Squeers: A cruel, one-eyed, Yorkshire &quot;schoolmaster&quot;. He runs Dotheboys Hall, a boarding school for unwanted children. He mistreats the boys horribly, starving them and beating them regularly. He gets his comeuppance at the hands of Nicholas when he is beaten in retaliation for the whipping of Smike. He travels to London after he recovers, and partakes in more bad business, fulfilling his grudge against Nicholas by becoming a close partner in Ralph&#x27;s schemes to fake Smike&#x27;s parentage and later to obfuscate the will that would make Madeline Bray an heiress. He is arrested during the last of these tasks and sentenced to be transported to Australia.

:Dickens insisted that Squeers was based not on an individual Yorkshire schoolmaster but was a composite of several he had met while visiting the county to investigate such establishments for himself, with the &quot;object [of] calling public attention to the system.&quot; However literary critic and author Cumberland Clark (1862–1941) notes that the denial was prompted by fear of libel and that the inspiration for the character was in fact William Shaw, of William Shaw&#x27;s Academy, Bowes. Clark notes a court case brought against Shaw by the parents of a boy blinded through neglect while at the school, in which the description of the premises matches closely that in the novel. A surviving example of Shaw&#x27;s business card is compared to that offered by Squeers in the novel and the wording is shown to match that used by Dickens. Shaw&#x27;s descendant Ted Shaw is president of the Dickens Fellowship and claims that Dickens had &quot;sensationalised and exaggerated the facts&quot;.
*Mrs Squeers: is even more cruel and less affectionate than her husband to the boys in their care. She dislikes Nicholas on sight and attempts to make his life at Dotheboys Hall as difficult as possible.
*Fanny Squeers: The Squeers&#x27; daughter. She is 23, unattractive, ill-tempered, and eager to find a husband. She falls in love with Nicholas until he bluntly rebuffs her affections, which causes her to antagonise him passionately and openly. Tilda Price is her best friend but the relationship is strained by Fanny&#x27;s pride and spitefulness. She is haughty, self-important and is deluded about her beauty and station.
*Young Wackford Squeers: The Squeers&#x27; loutish son. His parents dote on him and he is very fat as a result of their spoiling him. He is preoccupied with filling his belly as often as he can and bullying his father&#x27;s boys, to his father&#x27;s great pride. When the boys revolt, they dip his head several times in a bowl of the disgusting &quot;brimstone&quot; (sulphur) and treacle &quot;remedy&quot; (actually an appetite suppressant) they are regularly force-fed on pain of punishment.
*John Browdie: A bluff Yorkshire corn merchant, with a loud, boisterous sense of humour. At the start of the novel he is engaged to Tilda Price and marries her about halfway through the book. Although he and Nicholas get off on the wrong foot, they become good friends when John helps Nicholas escape from Yorkshire. He later comes to London on his honeymoon and rescues Smike from Squeers&#x27; captivity, proving himself a resourceful and intelligent ally.
*Matilda &quot;Tilda&quot; Price (Browdie): Fanny&#x27;s best friend and Browdie&#x27;s fiancée. A pretty miller&#x27;s daughter of 18, Tilda puts up with Fanny&#x27;s pettiness because of their childhood friendship but later breaks off their friendship after she realises the extent of Fanny&#x27;s selfishness. She is rather coquettish but settles down happily with John Browdie.
*Phib (Phoebe): The Squeers&#x27; housemaid, who is forced to endure Mrs Squeers&#x27; foul temper and Fanny&#x27;s scorn in order to keep her job. She flatters Fanny to keep her in good humour. She is described as hungry.

===Around London===
*Miss La Creevy: The Nicklebys&#x27; landlady. A small, kindly (if somewhat ridiculous) woman in her fifties, she is a miniature-portrait painter. She is the first friend the Nicklebys make in London, and one of the truest. She is rewarded for her good-heartedness when she falls in love with Tim Linkinwater. Her character was said to have been inspired by the artist Rose Emma Drummond.
*Hannah: Miss La Creevy&#x27;s faithful but noticeably stupid maid.
*Mr Snawley: An oil merchant who puts his two stepsons into Squeers&#x27;s &quot;care&quot;. He pretends to be Smike&#x27;s father to help Squeers get back at Nicholas, but, when pursued by the Cheerybles, cracks under the pressure and eventually confesses everything.
*Mr and Madame Mantalini: Milliners, Kate&#x27;s employers. Alfred Muntle (he changed his name to Mantalini for business purposes) is a handsome man with a large bushy black mustache who lives off his wife&#x27;s business. He is not above stealing from his wife and dramatically threatens to kill himself whenever he does not get his way. Madame Mantalini is much older than her husband and equally prone to dramatics. She eventually gets wise and divorces him, but not until he has ruined her with extravagant spending and she is forced to sell the business to Miss Knag. Mantalini is seen again at the end of the book living in much reduced circumstances, romantically tied to a washerwoman, but still up to his old tricks.
*Miss Knag: Mrs Mantalini&#x27;s right-hand woman and the chief assistant in the showroom. Miss Knag is well into middle age but is under the impression that she is exceptionally beautiful. When Kate begins her employment with the Mantalinis, Miss Knag is quite kind to her because the younger woman is clumsy, making Miss Knag look more accomplished by comparison. But when she is insulted by a disgruntled customer who prefers to be served by Kate, she blames Kate and ostracizes her. She takes over the business when the Mantalinis go bankrupt, immediately firing Kate. A spinster, she lives with her brother Mortimer, a failed novelist.
*The Kenwigs family: Newman Noggs&#x27;s neighbours. Mr Kenwigs and his wife Susan are dependent on the latter&#x27;s wealthy uncle Mr Lillyvick, and everything they do is designed to please him so he will not write their children (including their baby, named Lillyvick) out of his will. Their daughter Morleena is an awkward child of seven. The family and their acquaintances are described by Dickens as &quot;exceptionally common.&quot;
*Mr Lillyvick: Mrs Kenwigs&#x27;s uncle. He is a collector of the water rate, a position which gives him great importance among his poor relatives. They bend over backwards to please him, and he is completely used to getting his way. He falls in love with Miss Petowker and marries her, to the Kenwigs&#x27; great distress. When she elopes with another man, he comes back to his family a sadder but wiser man.
*Henrietta Petowker: Of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane. A minor actress with a prestigious company and a major star with the significantly less prestigious Crummles troupe. Mrs Crummles&#x27; protégée. She marries Mr Lillyvick after meeting him at the Kenwigs&#x27; wedding anniversary party, but leaves him for another man within a few months.
*Henry and Julia Wittiterly: A wealthy, social-climbing couple who employ Kate as a companion to Mrs Wittiterly. Mrs Wittiterly is a hypochondriac and puts on a show of her frailty and poor health, but she has a fierce temper when she does not get her way. Mr Wittiterly flatters his wife and toadies to her every whim. They are oblivious to the degradation Kate is subjected to under their noses, only concerned that they are being visited by noblemen. Mrs. Wittiterly becomes jealous of Kate. She reprimands Kate for flirting with the noblemen that call, but never allows Kate to miss the visits since it is obvious that she is the reason for the call. Nicholas rescues Kate from their employ, and they are happy to see her go. They do not pay Kate her last salary.
*Charles and Ned Cheeryble: Identical twin brothers, wealthy &quot;German-merchants&quot; (merchants who trade internationally) who are as magnanimous as they are jovial. Remembering their humble beginnings, they spend much of their time doing charity work and helping those in need. This generosity leads them to give Nicholas a job and provide for his family, and almost single-handedly revive his faith in the goodness of man. They become key figures in the development of Ralph&#x27;s defeat and the Nicklebys&#x27; happy ending.
*Frank Cheeryble: Ned and Charles&#x27;s nephew, who is just as open-hearted as his uncles. He shares Nicholas&#x27;s streak of anger when his sense of chivalry is roused; Nicholas first meets him after he has kicked a man for insulting Madeline Bray. He falls in love with Kate and later marries her.
*Madeline Bray: A beautiful but destitute young woman. Proud and dutiful to her dying father, she is willing to throw her life away if it means ensuring his comfort. Nicholas falls in love with her at first sight, and she comes to feel the same way about him.
*Walter Bray: Madeline&#x27;s father, formerly a handsome gentleman. He is an extremely selfish man who has wasted his late wife&#x27;s fortune and living, in ill health, in a slum dwelling with his daughter. He owes vast sums of money to both Ralph and Gride. He maintains a scornful and prideful attitude towards Nicholas. He fools himself that he is acting for the benefit of his daughter by agreeing to her marriage with Gride, but when he realizes what he has done, he dies of grief before the marriage goes through, freeing Madeline from her obligations.
*Tim Linkinwater: The Cheerybles&#x27; devoted clerk. An elderly, stout, pleasant gentleman, he is jokingly referred to by the Brothers as &quot;a Fierce Lion&quot;. He is prone to hyperbole and obstinately refuses to go into retirement. He finds happiness with Miss La Creevy.
*The Man Next Door: A madman who lives next to the Nickleby family&#x27;s cottage in the latter part of the novel. He falls instantly in love with Mrs. Nickleby, and he repeatedly throws vegetables over the wall in their garden as a token of his affections. To Kate&#x27;s distress, Mrs. Nickleby refuses to believe that her suitor is insane until he suddenly switches his attentions to Miss LaCreevy.

===The Crummles troupe===
*Mr Vincent Crummles: Head of the Crummles theatre , a larger-than-life actor-manager who takes Nicholas under his wing. He takes great pride in his profession, but also sometimes yearns for a quieter life, settled down with his wife and children. Eventually, he and his family take their act to America to pursue greater success on the theatrical stage.
*Mrs Crummles: Mr Crummles&#x27;s wife. A formidable but loving presence in the company, she is a great diva, but Dickens leaves the question of her actual ability up to the reader.
*Miss Ninetta Crummles, The &quot;Infant Phenomenon&quot;: Daughter of Mr and Mrs Crummles. She is a &quot;very&quot; prominent member of the Crummles troupe: a dancing part is written for her in every performance, even if there is no place for it. She is supposedly ten years old, but is actually closer to eighteen, having been kept on a steady diet of gin to keep her looking young. (Said to be inspired by English child actress Jean Margaret Davenport, with her parents the inspiration for Vincent and Mrs. Crummles as well.) 
*Mr Folair: A pantomimist with the Crummles company. He is an apt flatterer but does not hesitate to say exactly what he thinks of people once their backs are turned.
*Miss Snevellicci: The talented leading lady of the Crummles troupe. She and Nicholas flirt heavily, and there is a mutual attraction, but nothing comes of it. She eventually leaves the troupe to get married.
*Mr Lenville: A melodramatic, self-centred tragedian, who becomes jealous of the attention Nicholas is receiving as an actor, and attempts to pull his nose in front of the company, an act which results in the actor himself being knocked down and his cane broken by Nicholas.

<doc id="930140" wikidata="Q982095" url="?curid=930140" title="James Lee Burke">
<text>James Lee Burke (born December 5, 1936) is an American author, best known for his Dave Robicheaux series. He has won Edgar Awards for his novels &quot;Black Cherry Blues&quot; (1990), &quot;Cimarron Rose&quot; (1998), and &quot;Flags on the Bayou&quot; (2024). He has also been presented with the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. The Robicheaux character has been portrayed twice on screen, first by Alec Baldwin (&quot;Heaven&#x27;s Prisoners&quot;) and then Tommy Lee Jones (&quot;In the Electric Mist&quot;). His 1986 novel The Lost Get-back Boogie was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.

Wirt Williams, reviewing Burke&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Half of Paradise&quot; (1965), in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, compared his writing to Jean-Paul Sartre and Ernest Hemingway, but concluded &quot;Mr. Burkes&#x27; literary forebear is Thomas Hardy.&quot;

Burke&#x27;s 1982 novel, &quot;Two for Texas&quot;, was made into a 1998 TV movie of the same name. Burke has also written five miscellaneous crime novels (including &quot;Two for Texas&quot;), two short-story collections, four books starring protagonist Texas attorney Billy Bob Holland, four books starring Billy Bob&#x27;s cousin Texas sheriff Hackberry Holland, and two books starring Weldon Avery Holland, grandson of legendary Texas lawman Hackberry Holland.

==Biography==
Burke was born in Houston, Texas, but spent most of his childhood on the Texas-Louisiana Gulf Coast. He attended the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and University of Missouri, receiving Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees in English literature from the latter.

He worked in a variety of jobs over the years, while books he had written were rejected, and books he had published went out of print. At various times, he worked as a truck driver for the U.S. Forest Service, as a newspaper reporter, as a social worker on Skid Row, Los Angeles, as a land surveyor in Colorado, in the Louisiana State unemployment system, and in the Job Corps in the Daniel Boone National Forest in eastern Kentucky.

He taught at the University of Missouri as a grad student, then at the University of Louisiana, the University of Montana, and Miami-Dade Community College, before settling in Wichita, Kansas to teach at Wichita State University in 1978.

==Personal life==
Burke and his wife Pearl, née Pai Chu, owned homes in Lolo, Montana and in New Iberia, Louisiana. They have four children, including Alafair Burke, a law professor and best-selling crime writer. Daughter Pamala Burke McDavid died in 2020. Extended family include cousins novelist Elizabeth Nell Dubus and author and actress DeLauné Michel.

<doc id="930141" wikidata="Q3267400" url="?curid=930141" title="Lumumba (film)">
<text>Lumumba is a 2000 biographical film directed by Raoul Peck. A co-production of France, Germany, Belgium, and Haiti filmed in French, the film depicts the rise and fall of Patrice Lumumba, and is set in the months before and after Congo-Léopoldville achieved independence from Belgium in June 1960. War in the Democratic Republic of the Congo at the time of filming caused the film to be shot in Zimbabwe and Beira, Mozambique. The film received positive reviews from critics, and won awards from the American Black Film Festival, the Political Film Society, and the Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou.

==Plot==
The film begins with a montage of Lumumba and his compatriots Joseph Okito and Maurice Mpolo being driven to their executions, cutting to their bodies being exhumed, dismembered, and burned on the orders of Mobutu Sese Seko. Lumumba narrates his final letter to his wife in these introductory scenes. The film then jumps back to the late 1950s as Lumumba has a debate with Moïse Tshombe and Godefroid Munongo, rival politicians from the ethnically-nationalist pro-Western CONAKAT party. Lumumba expresses his Pan-Africanist ideals, expressed at a recent summit in Accra, Ghana, which infuriate Tshombe and Munongo.

Following the debate, the film cuts back to Lumumba receiving his job as a beer salesman, hired because of his public speaking ability by the Polar beer company, which the locals distrust. While using his beer sales to promote his political ideas in Leopoldville, Lumumba meets Joseph Mobutu for the first time. After hearing that Baudouin of Belgium has become more favorable to independence, the street meeting is broken up by Force Publique soldiers, who arrest and imprison Lumumba where he is beaten by the Belgian guards before being freed and sent to Brussels to negotiate Congolese independence.

While in Brussels, Lumumba first meets Joseph Kasa-Vubu (spelled Kasavubu in the film), a fellow independence-minded politician from the rival ABAKO party, who wishes to better compromise with the Belgians, who insist that their colonial rule is all that prevents tribal warfare from occurring. Upset that the Belgians do not recognize the legitimacy of the Mouvement National Congolais given their success in the elections, Lumumba backs Kasavubu for president, who in turn appoints Lumumba as prime minister. On the night of the coalition&#x27;s formation, Lumumba is threatened by Tshombe and Munongo, who were not given any leadership positions in the new government. At the formal recognition of independence from the king of Belgium, Lumumba&#x27;s speech strikes a more combative tone than Kasavubu&#x27;s, highlighting the oppression that the Congolese suffered under Belgian rule.

Back in the Congo, the Congo Crisis has begun with an assault on a member of Lumumba&#x27;s cabinet. The cabinet then debates the removal of Émile Janssens, who does not support African officers. Mobuto supersedes Mpolo as an appointee to colonel. Then, mutinied soldiers assault a member of Lumumba&#x27;s cabinet and storm the government house, demanding the removal of their white superiors. Lumumba implores them to return to their barracks, and the group&#x27;s leader informs Lumumba that they have taken white officers and their families hostage, and will kill them if Lumumba does not follow through on his promise to address them. The rebelling soldiers are chided by Janssens, who reaffirms his belief in a white-controlled military. Following a protest by soldiers&#x27; wives, he is called before Lumumba, who demands Janssens&#x27; resignation. Following the rape and assault by soldiers of a Flemish couple, the Belgian ambassador visits Lumumba and makes veiled threats to involve the United Nations and NATO, which infuriates Lumumba, insisting that the Belgians have caused the problem by retaining a segregated military. Lumumba dismisses Janssens and charges the ambassador with removing him from the country.

On a visit to Katanga, Munongo refuses to allow the government&#x27;s plane to land, signaling the secession of Katanga into the State of Katanga. After a run-in with Belgian troops at Ndjili, Lumumba drives to crush the secessionist Katangans. Evidence surfaces that Mobutu&#x27;s forces massacred large numbers of civilians while fighting the Kanangan rebels, and Lumumba dismisses a recalcitrant Mobutu, upset that he will have to answer for Mobutu&#x27;s atrocities. He brushes off support from the United States, and meets with an exhausted Kasavubu, where he reveals that he feels that the Soviet Union is the only country that he can rely on for support. At a military camp, the American ambassador pledges his support to Mobutu, provided that he help in eliminating Lumumba. Kasavubu dismisses Lumumba for both his alleged communist sympathies and his perceived role in the South Kasai massacres, creating political deadlock due to Lumumba&#x27;s widespread popularity. After condemning Kasavubu&#x27;s criticism and brushing off accusations of being a communist, Lumumba returns home where he learns that his infant daughter must be sent to Switzerland, since she is gravely ill. Mobutu arrives and tells Lumumba that Kasavubu wanted him arrested, but has elected to place him under house arrest instead, leading Lumumba to suspect that Mobutu is working with a foreign power.

Later, Mobutu announces that the army has seized power, and claims to have arrested both Lumumba and Kasavubu. While plotting his escape to Stanleyville, Lumumba learns that his infant daughter has died in Switzerland. While Lumumba and his partisans cross the river towards Stanleyville, soldiers arrive and accost Lumumba&#x27;s family and he returns to face them, where he is arrested. At Mobutu&#x27;s military encampment, he and others vote to kill Lumumba, with Kasavubu reluctantly casting his vote. He, Mpolo, and Okito, are taken to Katanga where they are brutally beaten, with Munongo joining in. The ending of the film intersperses Mobutu, now Mobutu Sese Seko, publicly remembering Lumumba, with shots of the men&#x27;s executions in a dark woods.

==Release ==
The film premiered at the 2000 Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2000, and it was shown at various film festivals as well as having commercial releases in Belgium, France, Switzerland, the United States and Canada. The film grossed $684,000 in the US. It also aired on HBO.

===Disputed scene===
The film generated some controversy in 2002, when Frank Carlucci, a former American government official and protege of Donald Rumsfeld, persuaded HBO to delete a reference to him during the airing of the film. The scene in question involves a group of Belgian and Congolese officials deciding whether to kill Lumumba. Carlucci is asked for input, and he mumbles that the US government does not involve itself in the internal affairs of other countries. At the time, Carlucci was the second secretary of the US Embassy in Congo. He denies playing any role in the death of Lumumba: &quot;The scene is tendentious, false, libelous; it never happened and it is a cheap shot.&quot;

According to one source, the scene was deleted from the version of the film that aired on HBO. Another source says that the scene was not deleted, but the word &quot;Carlucci&quot; was bleeped in the dialogue, with the name masked in the credits. The scene remains on the DVD version of the film.

== Reception ==
The film received mostly positive reviews from critics, with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 81% and a Metacritic score of 78, which indicates &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The critics&#x27; consensus of Rotten Tomatoes read &quot;Ebouaney&#x27;s fiery performance makes Lumumba compelling.&quot;

Reviewing the film in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alex Tunzelmann noted Peck&#x27;s &quot;commendable effort to get as close to the truth as possible, incorporating many details from historical investigator Ludo de Witte&#x27;s &quot;The Assassination of Lumumba&quot;. Tunzelmann suggested the film might move too quickly through the Congo and Lumumba&#x27;s history for viewers not already familiar with it to keep up, but said the &quot;last part of the film, from Lumumba&#x27;s falling out with Mobutu to his death, is gripping to watch, building to a superb last scene intercutting Lumumba&#x27;s fate with Mobutu&#x27;s attempt to rewrite history.&quot; Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Elvis Mitchell read the film&#x27;s pace as &quot;refus[ing] to lay out Lumumba&#x27;s life in traditional, corny terms by presenting a lengthy and unwieldy history lesson and then groveling for audience sympathy. Instead &quot;Lumumba&quot; vaults through his radicalization and the track that led this former civil servant and beer salesman to leave his angry stamp on the world.&quot;

==Plot==

Justine Last is a bored thirty-year-old woman living in small-town Texas with her husband Phil, a house painter who spends most of his free time smoking marijuana with his best friend, Bubba. Phil and Justine have been trying to have a baby, but have been unsuccessful despite doctors telling Justine she is healthy and fertile.

Justine works at Retail Rodeo, the local big-box store. She meets the new cashier, Holden, who spends his free time reading &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot; as he identifies strongly with the protagonist. Justine and Holden begin spending time together and grow closer, but she is hesitant to begin an affair. Holden writes Justine a romantic letter expressing his love for her and his desire for her, and they have sex at a motel. They continue to meet there, charging the rooms to Justine&#x27;s credit card, and also begin having sex in the store room at work.

Holden shares stories he&#x27;s written with Justine, most of them reflecting his own feelings and alienation and all ending with the main character committing suicide. Justine feels happy and excited by the affair and Holden&#x27;s affection, but becomes concerned when she spots Bubba&#x27;s truck parked across the street from the motel where they&#x27;ve been meeting. She tries to end the relationship, but Holden refuses and she begins to feel smothered by his passionate feelings.

Bubba confronts Justine about her affair with Holden and tells her he had always admired Phil, but now is disillusioned and sees him as only a cuckold and a fool. He blackmails Justine into having sex with him so he can be free of these feelings. She reluctantly consents, and Holden witnesses them in the act through a window.

Holden is angry and upset with Justine for sleeping with Bubba and calls her a whore. He begs Justine to run away with him. Justine, now desperate to end the affair, considers poisoning Holden but changes her mind suddenly and decides to speak to his parents instead. She tells them that he is mentally ill and has imagined a romantic liaison between them.

Justine discovers she&#x27;s pregnant. Phil is overjoyed, but Justine is uneasy because she&#x27;s uncertain of who the father is. Later, he hears from the doctor that he&#x27;s sterile, but Bubba reassures him that they&#x27;ve made a mistake.

At the store, Justine is questioned by her boss, Jack, about $15,000 that has gone missing. They suspect Holden has stolen it, and Corny reveals that he&#x27;s been watching her and Holden have sex in the store room on surveillance cameras. Justine insists she knows nothing about the theft, and tries to convince Holden to give up the money and surrender, but he still wants her to run away with him.

Justine considers running away with Holden, imagining what her life would be like if she stayed, and ultimately goes to Jack and tells him where to find Holden. The police surround the motel where Holden is hiding, and he commits suicide.

The next day, Bubba tells Justine that Phil saw the motel room on the credit card statement, then begs her not to tell Phil about their encounter. Justine returns home and is confronted by Phil, who strikes her when she admits to her infidelity. Devastated, Phil expresses remorse for hitting her and asks if the baby is his. Justine assures him he is the father. Phil still insists on knowing who she had an affair with, and when he asks if it was with Corny the security guard, Justine lies and says yes. At work the next morning, Corny has a bruised face and his arm in a sling. Cheryl informs Justine that after Bible study the previous night, two guys with painted faces jumped him.

Justine reads the final story Holden wrote for her, which departs from his previous stories and ends with the two of them running away together. Months later, she and Phil contentedly care for their newborn child.

==Critical reception==
&quot;The Good Girl&quot; was well received by most critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% approval rating, based on reviews from 159 critics. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A dark dramedy with exceptional performances from Jennifer Aniston and Jake Gyllenhaal, &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is a moving and astute look at the passions of two troubled souls in a small town.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, calculated a &quot;generally favorable&quot; average score of 71, based on 35 reviews.

Much critical praise went to Jennifer Aniston for her against-type performance. Ella Taylor of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; opined it is &quot;especially gratifying to see her play a woman who&#x27;s had it up to here with making nice, and making do.&quot; Critic James Berardinelli wrote, &quot;Her performance is forceful and effective - she effortlessly submerges herself into the role, and, after only a moment&#x27;s hesitation, Aniston has vanished and all that&#x27;s left is lonely, trapped Justine.&quot;

Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s Ms. Aniston who surprises in &quot;The Good Girl.&quot; In some ways she may feel as trapped as Justine by playing Rachel Green, the poor little rich daddy&#x27;s girl of television&#x27;s &quot;Friends.&quot; She comes up with an inventively morose physicality for Justine: her arms hang at her sides as though shackled; they&#x27;re not limp appendages but weighed down with unhappiness. The plucky dream girls she&#x27;s played in movies like the underseen 1999 classic &quot;Office Space&quot; are expressive and given to anxious displays of hand waving. But here she articulates Justine&#x27;s sad tales through a narration that&#x27;s as affected and misery laden as Holden&#x27;s ragged, ripped-off fiction.&quot;

Writing for DVD Talk, Geoffrey Kleinman said, &quot;There are two things which make &quot;The Good Girl&quot; work so well: the fantastic script by Mike White, which is smart, funny, and honest, and the breakout performance by Jennifer Aniston who simply embodies her character. Whether or not you are a fan of Aniston, you&#x27;ll appreciate a look at the real depth she has as an actress and I hope to see her in more films that challenge her as an actress.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half stars and also praised Aniston&#x27;s performance, and saying &quot;The Good Girl&quot; is an &quot;independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil&quot;.

<text>Abiodun Adesola &quot;Abi&quot; Oyepitan (born 30 December 1979) is a British sprint athlete, who specialises in the 100 and 200 metres. She won the 100 m at the 2001 Summer Universiade and at the 2002 Commonwealth Games she took a bronze medal with the 4 × 100 m team. She became one of Britain&#x27;s best female sprinters, becoming the first British female to reach an Olympic final in a sprint event since Kathy Cook. However, following her performance in the 2004 Athens Olympics, she suffered an injury, which all but brought her career to a halt.She made a winning comeback in 2010, competing in the Diamond League and winning a silver medal for England at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi in the 200 m and a gold medal when she anchored the 4 × 100 m relay team to a win.

==Early career==
Oyepitan was born in Westminster, London to Nigerian parents. Her name &quot;Adesola&quot; means &quot;crowned with wealth&quot; in Yoruba. She attended Bentley Wood High School.
She represents Shaftesbury Barnet Harriers athletics club. Her first outing to a major athletics came at the 1998 World Junior Athletics Championships, where she finished fourth as part of the British 4 x 100 m relay team. She continued to perform well at the junior level, but her progress was interrupted in 2000 by an injury. She managed to bounce back the following year, with her comeback including a silver medal at the European under-23 Championships.

She was again part of the 4 x 100 m relay squad at the 2001 World Championships. Although the squad came away empty handed, they set the second fastest time ever by a British squad. She went on to take gold at the World Student Games that same year.

In 2002, Oyepitan made the final of the Commonwealth Games 100 m, and improved on this in the relay by taking silver behind an Australian team. She also made the final of the European Athletics Championships, where Ekaterini Thanou took the gold.

She continued to improve and in 2003 broke her 200 m personal best in taking her first national senior title.

In 2004, at a meeting in Kalamata, Greece, in May, Oyepitan won the 100 m, then beat the reigning European Champion Muriel Hurtis in the 200 m.

==2004 Athens Olympics==
At the 2004 Summer Olympics Oyepitan did not make the 100 m final. Running in the faster of the two semi-finals, she finished fifth in her heat with a time of 11.18 s, that equalled LaTasha Colander&#x27;s fourth placed time that saw her through in the second semi.

In the 200 m Oyepitan set a personal best in the first round, then comfortably progressed through round two and the semi-final, finishing second in both to Allyson Felix. She was passed early on in the final by eventual winner Veronica Campbell and eventually finished joint 7th, but happy with her overall performance.

Her appearance in the 200 m final was the first women&#x27;s Olympic sprint final (100 + 200 m) to feature a Briton since Kathy Smallwood-Cook at the Los Angeles Olympics twenty years previously. She was also the only Briton to reach the sprint finals, all of the men failing for the first time in twenty-eight years, despite later going on to win the 4 × 100 m relay.

==After 2004==
Following the Olympics, a stress fracture injury caused her to miss the 2005 athletics season. She returned to the track in 2006, but the injury continued to limit her performances.

In 2010, she returned to take silver in the 200 m and a gold in the 4 x 100 m relay at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi.

==2012 London Olympics ==
In 2012, Oyepitan came 2nd in the Oslo leg of the Diamond League 200 m Women in 22.71s. She then qualified for 2012 Olympics in London, where she competed in the 100 m and 200 m, making the semi-finals in both events.

In 2014, she announced her retirement.

==National titles==
*AAAs (of England) National 100 metres Champion – 2004 (2nd in 2002, 2003)
*AAAs National 200 metres Champion – 2003 (2nd in 2004)

<text>William Lonsdale (9 September 1794 in Bath11 November 1871 in Bristol), English geologist and palaeontologist, won the Wollaston medal in 1846 for his research on the various kinds of fossil corals.

==Biography==
He was educated for the army and in 1810 obtained a commission as ensign in the 4th (King&#x27;s Own) regiment. He served in the Peninsular War at the battles of Salamanca and Waterloo, for both of which he received medals; and he retired as lieutenant.

Residing afterwards for some years at Batheaston he collected a series of rocks and fossils which he presented to the Literary and Scientific Institution of Bath. He became the first honorary curator of the natural history department of the museum, and worked until 1829 when he was appointed assistant secretary and curator of the Geological Society of London at Somerset House. There he held office until 1842, when ill health led him to resign.

The ability with which he edited the publications of the society and advised the council on every obscure and difficult point was commented on by Murchison in his presidential address (1843). In 1829 Lonsdale read before the society an important paper &quot;On the Oolitic District of Bath&quot; (&quot;Trans. Geol. Soc.&quot; ser. 2, vol. iii.), the results of a survey begun in 1827; later he was engaged in a survey of the Oolitic strata of Gloucestershire (1832), at the instigation of the Geological Society, and he laid down on the one-inch ordnance maps the boundaries of the various geological formations.

He gave particular attention to the study of corals, becoming the highest authority in England on the subject, and he described fossil forms from the Tertiary and Cretaceous strata of North America and from the older strata of Britain and Russia. In 1837 he suggested from a study of the fossils of the South Devon limestones that they would prove to be of an age intermediate between the Carboniferous and Silurian systems. This suggestion was adopted by Sedgwick and Murchison in 1839, and may be regarded as the basis on which they founded the Devonian system.

Lonsdale&#x27;s paper, &quot;Notes on the Age of the Limestones of South Devonshire&quot; (read 1840), was published in the same volume of the &quot;Transactions of the Geological Society&quot; (ser. 2, vol. v.) with Sedgwick and Murchison&#x27;s famous paper &quot;On the Physical Structure of Devonshire&quot;, and these authors observe that the conclusion arrived at by Mr Lonsdale, we now apply without reserve both to the five groups of our North Devon section, and to the fossiliferous slates of Cornwall. The later years of Lonsdale&#x27;s life were spent in retirement, and he died at Bristol on 11 November 1871.

Bennett served as Acting Governor of Hawaii from August 25 to September 3, 2004, upon the absence of Governor Linda Lingle and lieutenant governor Duke Aiona. The executives left the Hawaiian Islands to attend the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City.

== Federal judicial service ==
On February 12, 2018, President Donald Trump announced his intent to nominate Bennett to an undetermined seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On February 15, 2018, his nomination was sent to the Senate. Bennett was nominated for the seat vacated by Judge Richard Clifton, who assumed senior status on December 31, 2016. On April 11, 2018, a hearing on his nomination was held before the Senate Judiciary Committee. On May 10, 2018, his nomination was reported out of committee by an 18–2 vote. On July 9, 2018, the United States Senate invoked cloture on his nomination by a 72–25 vote. On July 10, 2018, his nomination was confirmed by a 72–27 vote. All 27 votes against his confirmation came from Republican Senators due to his defense of Hawaii&#x27;s restrictive firearms laws in court. He received his judicial commission on July 13, 2018.

On August 16, 2019, Bennett was in the majority of a split panel for the Ninth Circuit which blocked new asylum restrictions by the Trump administration within its own jurisdiction but declined to block the new asylum rules across the entire nation.

In September 2020, Bennett dissented when the panel majority found that a robocall defendant could not use the Federal Arbitration Act to compel enforcement of a customer agreement the plaintiff had signed years earlier with a separate company that had subsequently been acquired by the holding company that now also owned the defendant.

On December 4, 2021, Bennett was one of two judges who declined to halt San Diego Unified School District&#x27;s requirements that students be vaccinated by December 20.

On September 6, 2022, Bennett wrote a concurring opinion in the 9th circuit decision upholding Washington&#x27;s ban on conversion therapy for minors. The Supreme Court denied &quot;certiorari&quot; on December 11, 2023.

== Personal life ==
Bennett is married to Honolulu attorney Patricia Tomi Ohara. He has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2016.

<text>Toby Daniel Moorsom Young, Baron Young of Acton (born 17 October 1963), is a British social commentator and life peer. He is the founder and director of the Free Speech Union, an associate editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, creator of &quot;The Daily Sceptic&quot; blog and a former associate editor at &quot;Quillette.&quot;

A graduate of the University of Oxford, Young briefly worked for &quot;The Times&quot;, before co-founding the London magazine &quot;Modern Review&quot; in 1991. He edited it until financial difficulties led to its demise in 1995. His 2001 memoir, &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot;, details his subsequent employment at &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. He then went on to write for &quot;The Sun on Sunday&quot;, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and &quot;The Spectator&quot;. He also served as a judge in seasons five and six of the television show &quot;Top Chef&quot;. A proponent of free schools, Young co-founded the West London Free School and served as director of the New Schools Network.

In 2015 Young wrote an article in advocacy of genetically engineered intelligence, which he described as &quot;progressive eugenics&quot;. In early January 2018, he was briefly a non-executive director on the board of the Office for Students, an appointment from which he resigned within a few days after Twitter posts described as &quot;misogynistic and homophobic&quot; were uncovered. In 2020, press regulator Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) found Young to have promoted misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic in a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; column.

== Early life ==
Born in Buckinghamshire, Young was brought up in Highgate, North London, and in South Devon. His mother Sasha (1931–1993), daughter of Raisley Stewart Moorsom, a descendant of Admiral Sir Robert Moorsom, who fought at the Battle of Trafalgar, was a BBC Radio producer, artist and writer, and his father was Michael Young (later Lord Young of Dartington), a Labour life peer and sociologist who popularized the word &quot;meritocracy&quot;. Although entitled to use the style &quot;The Hon. Toby Young&quot;, he did not.

Young attended Creighton School (now Fortismere School), Muswell Hill and King Edward VI Community College, Totnes. Young later wrote that he was not popular at school: &quot;My only friend was a black boy called Remi, who explained that the reason he&#x27;d taken a shine to me was because he knew what it was like to be a &#x27;nigger&#x27;.&quot; He left school at 16, having failed all but one of his O Levels (the pass was a C in English Literature). He then retook his O Levels and went to the Sixth Form of William Ellis School, Highgate, leaving with two Bs and a C at A Level. Having applied to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Oxford University, he had been given a conditional offer of three Bs plus an O Level pass in a foreign language from Brasenose College, under an Inner London Education Authority scheme to provide university access to comprehensive pupils. Despite failing to meet that offer, he was awarded a place to study at the college. Young said he was sent an acceptance letter by mistake, as well as a letter of rejection from the admissions tutor Harry Judge. In an article he wrote for &quot;The Spectator&quot;, he said that his father phoned Judge to clarify the situation – Judge was in a meeting with the PPE tutors at the time, and after some discussion, they decided to offer Young a place owing to a moral obligation the mistaken acceptance created. 

Young graduated in 1986 with a first in PPE, and then worked for &quot;The Times&quot; for six months as a news trainee until he was fired for (according to Young himself) hacking the computer system, impersonating the editor Charles Wilson and circulating information about senior executives&#x27; salaries to others around the building. He was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship and studied at Harvard then spent two years at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he carried out research for a PhD which he left without completing.

==Journalism, writing and activism==
In 1991, Young co-founded and co-edited the &quot;Modern Review&quot; with Julie Burchill and her then husband Cosmo Landesman. Its motto was &quot;Low culture for highbrows&quot;. &quot;The whole enterprise was driven by one fairly simple idea&quot;, Young said in 2005. &quot;And that was that critics had a responsibility to take the best popular culture as seriously as the best high culture&quot;.

Four years later the magazine was close to financial collapse and Young closed it down, angering his principal financial backer Peter York, as well as Burchill and staff writer Charlotte Raven. Burchill had tried to replace Young as editor with Raven. &quot;Ultimately the reason we fell out is because our relationship began as a kind of mentor-apprentice, and that was a kind of relationship which Julie was comfortable with. It was only when I succeeded in getting out from under her shadow that our relationship deteriorated&quot;, Young said in 2005.

Young moved to New York City shortly afterwards to work for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. In the time he wrote for the magazine he contributed 3,000 words, and was paid $85,000. After being sacked by &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; in 1998, he stayed in New York for two more years, working as a columnist for the &quot;New York Press&quot;, before returning to the UK in 2000. A memoir of these years, &quot;How to Lose Friends and Alienate People&quot;, was published in 2001.

Following Jack Davenport, Young performed in the West End one-man stage adaptation of &quot;How to Lose Friends and Alienate People&quot; in 2004. Theatre critic Lyn Gardner gave it a one star review commenting that &quot;The curious thing about this is that Young&#x27;s day job is as theatre critic of the &quot;Spectator&quot;. You would think he might have developed some respect for the job that actors do. Clearly not. But then, neither does he appear to have picked up any tips on acting along the way.&quot; A review in &quot;The Stage&quot; stated, &quot;Despite Young&#x27;s previous thespic experience being the only student at Anna Scher’s drama school not to get a part in &quot;Grange Hill&quot; and having been fired after a week as an extra on the film &quot;Another Country&quot;, he gives a thoroughly convincing performance as himself…&quot;. The &quot;Evening Standard&quot; praised his performance. In 2005, he co-wrote (with fellow &quot;Spectator&quot; journalist Lloyd Evans) a sex farce about the David Blunkett/Kimberley Quinn intrigue and the &quot;Sextator&quot; affairs of Boris Johnson and Rod Liddle called &quot;Who&#x27;s the Daddy?&quot; It was named as the Best New Comedy at the 2006 Theatregoers&#x27; Choice Awards. The following year &quot;A Right Royal Farce&quot;, Young and Evans&#x27; play about sexual antics of the British royal family was poorly received by the press. Young said of the play &quot;It was an unqualified disaster&quot;. It received scathing reviews from the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

From 2002 to 2007, Young wrote a restaurant column for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; and claimed in a PM (BBC Radio 4) club membership discussion (20 March 2024) with Evan Davis that he was previously blackballed from joining the Garrick Club, a decade earlier, for criticising their catering in his column, while working for the &quot;Evening Standard.&quot; He later authored a restaurant column for &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;. In addition to serving as a judge on &quot;Top Chef&quot;, Young has competed in the Channel 4 TV series &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot;, appearing as one of the panel of food critics in the 2008 BBC Two series &quot;Eating with the Enemy&quot; and served as a judge on &quot;Hell&#x27;s Kitchen&quot;.

Young is an associate editor of &quot;The Spectator&quot;, where he writes a weekly column, the editor of &quot;Spectator Life&quot; and a regular contributor to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;. His &quot;Telegraph&quot; blog was long-listed for the 2012 George Orwell Prize for blogging. He was a political columnist for &quot;The Sun on Sunday&quot; for its first 11 months.

During the 2015 Labour leadership election, he encouraged readers of the politically conservative &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; to join the Labour party and support Jeremy Corbyn, who Young thought was the weakest candidate.

In February 2020, Young co-founded the Free Speech Union. In November 2021 he was awarded the 2021 Contrarian Prize.

In 2019, Young supported Boris Johnson for leader of the Conservative Party. In 2020, he said he was wrong to back him. Two years later he again backed Johnson as party leader. In 2023, the &quot;New Statesman named&quot; Young as the 44th most influential right-wing figure in British politics.

==Free schools advocate==
Young was a proposer and co-founder of the West London Free School, the first free school to sign a funding agreement with the Education Secretary, and is now a trustee of The West London Free School Academy Trust, the charitable trust that manages the school. The school was founded at Palingswick House, which displaced over 20 voluntary organisations previously located there. He stood down as CEO of the school in May 2016 after admitting that he did not realise how difficult it was going to be to run. The national press coverage of the school having four headteachers in six years was linked to the higher profile for the school caused by its connection to Young. The trust opened a primary school in Hammersmith in 2013, a second primary in Earls Court in 2014 and a third primary in Kensington in 2016. Young is a follower of the American educationalist E. D. Hirsch and an advocate of a traditional, knowledge-based approach to education.

In 2012, Young wrote an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; criticising the emphasis on &quot;inclusion&quot; in state schools, saying that the word &quot;inclusive&quot; was &quot;one of those ghastly, politically correct words that have survived the demise of New Labour. Schools have got to be &#x27;inclusive&#x27; these days. That means wheelchair ramps, the complete works of Alice Walker in the school library...&quot;. Young denied that he was attacking the provision of equal access to mainstream schools for people with disabilities, saying he was only referring to the alleged &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the curriculum.

In 2015, the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;″s cover story for its May 7 issue was an article written by British journalist Dawn Foster criticising the free school movement. In a letter to the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, Young took issue with Foster&#x27;s interpretation of free schools data and made claims that were challenged by the author Michael Rosen, journalist Melissa Benn, and education researcher Janet Downs in further letters written to the publication. Foster responded to Young in the &quot;London Review of Books&quot; letters refuting Young&#x27;s criticism and wrote:Creaming off the children of more affluent parents constitutes social segregation; so too does the existence of religious free schools. Young seems to think he is held in high regard by free school advocates. When I mentioned his name in the course of interviewing a former Department for Education employee for the piece, my interviewee headbutted the restaurant table in exasperation. I have found the sentiment, if not the gesture, to be common among his ideological comrades.On 29 October 2016, Young was appointed Director of the New Schools Network, a charity founded in 2009 to support groups setting up free schools. He resigned in March 2018.

==Eugenics==
In 2015, Young wrote an article for the Australian magazine &quot;Quadrant&quot; entitled &quot;The fall of meritocracy&quot;. Under a section titled &quot;Progressive eugenics&quot; he discussed developments in genetically engineered intelligence, and proposed that should the technology for selecting embryos for high intelligence become practicable, it could be provided &quot;free of charge to parents on low incomes with below-average IQs.” He argued this &quot;could help to address the problem of flat-lining inter-generational social mobility and serve as a counterweight to the tendency for the meritocratic elite to become a hereditary elite,&quot; through a mechanism that should be acceptable to political conservatives and also argued that &quot;This is a kind of eugenics that should appeal to liberals — progressive eugenics.&quot; Young has maintained that criticism of him as a eugenicist is &quot;based on a deliberate misreading&quot; of the article and that &quot;If &#x27;eugenics&#x27; is forced sterilisation, what I was proposing was the opposite — free IVF for the poor.&quot;

Young attended the London Conference on Intelligence at University College London (UCL) in 2017, which was described by the media and a number of politicians as a &quot;secret eugenics conference&quot;. Young said that he attended the conference as a journalist to report about it (which he later did), in preparation for the &quot;super-respectable&quot; International Society for Intelligence Research conference in Montreal in July 2017 at which he gave a speech, which was later published.

==Office for Students==
In January 2018 Young was announced as one of the non-executive members of the board for the new Office for Students (OfS), a body intended to ensure institutions in higher education are accountable. &quot;The Guardian&quot; later revealed that claims by the Department for Education about Young&#x27;s teaching posts at the University of Cambridge and Harvard were misleading as although Young had taught at the universities, he had not been appointed to an academic post. The appointment became the subject of controversy when Twitter posts, described as &quot;misogynistic and homophobic&quot;, were uncovered. He resigned a week later, stating that his appointment had &quot;become a distraction&quot; counteracting the &quot;vital work&quot; of the OfS. Shortly afterwards he resigned also as a Fulbright Commissioner.

An inquiry was launched shortly after Young&#x27;s resignation by Peter Riddell, the Commissioner for Public Appointments. Riddell said the OfS panel report to ministers about Young &quot;made no mention of Mr Young’s history of controversial comments and use of social media&quot;. The disquiet which followed &quot;makes a strong case for more extensive due diligence inquiries&quot;.

==COVID-19 pandemic==
In March 2020, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, Young wrote in &quot;The Critic&quot; that he &quot;suspect[ed] the Government has overreacted to the coronavirus crisis&quot;, expressing worry about the &quot;economic cost&quot;. In reference to the modelling of a team at Imperial College London led by Neil Ferguson, he wrote: &quot;spending £350 billion to prolong the lives of a few hundred thousand mostly elderly people is an irresponsible use of taxpayer&#x27;s money.&quot; Peter Jukes wrote that Young&#x27;s views could be &quot;outright deadly&quot; in a pandemic; Darren McGarvey compared Young&#x27;s views to austerity.

Young, who initiated the &quot;Lockdown Sceptics&quot; newsletter (now retitled &quot;The Daily Sceptic&quot;), called for stopping the lockdown before 14 April 2020. Saying that he had probably contracted the virus, he wrote that &quot;if the Government does end the lockdown, and it turns out that by the time I require critical care the NHS cannot accommodate me, I won&#x27;t regret writing this&quot;. He argued his own death would be &quot;acceptable collateral damage&quot;. Young&#x27;s view contrasted with the scientific recommendations for lockdown policy in the UK.

In June 2020, he wrote that &quot;the virus has all but disappeared&quot;. In January 2021, he appeared on &quot;Newsnight,&quot; and when he was challenged about his comments about the virus, he said: &quot;hands up, I got that wrong&quot; and made arguments against lockdowns.

On 14 January 2021, the British press regulator IPSO ruled that an article Young had written for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in July 2020 was &quot;significantly misleading&quot; and that the newspaper had failed to take care not to publish inaccurate information. In the article, Young claimed that common cold coronaviruses gave people immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and that in July 2020 London had almost achieved herd immunity. Neither claim was supported by scientists at the time. IPSO ordered the newspaper to publish a correction. &quot;The Telegraph&quot; removed the article from its website and Young deleted many of his tweets about the pandemic.

&quot;The Daily Sceptic&quot; has promoted misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. In September 2022, PayPal shut down the accounts of Young, the Free Speech Union and &quot;The Daily Sceptic&quot; website. The accounts were closed because of breaches of PayPal&#x27;s acceptable use policy, thought to be because of alleged misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. The accounts were restored later that month after extensive criticism of PayPal&#x27;s actions by MPs.

==House of Lords==
In late 2024, Young was nominated for a life peerage by Kemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative Party. He was created &quot;Baron Young of Acton, of Acton in the London Borough of Ealing&quot;, on 21 January 2025, and was introduced to the House of Lords on 28 January.

==Published works==
In addition to the book &quot;How to Lose Friends and Alienate People&quot;, Young is the author of &quot;The Sound of No Hands Clapping&quot; (2006), &quot;How to Set Up a Free School&quot; (2011) and &quot;What Every Parent Needs to Know: How to Help Your Child Get the Most Out of Primary School&quot; (2014), which he co-wrote with Miranda Thomas.

== Film and television ==
British producer Stephen Woolley and his wife Elizabeth Karlsen produced the film adaptation &quot;How to Lose Friends &amp; Alienate People&quot; (2008) in conjunction with FilmFour. Young, who co-produced the film, was played by Simon Pegg. It was released in Britain on 3 October 2008 and reached the number one spot at the box office in its opening week. The film received mostly negative reviews and was a commercial failure, losing over £8 million.

Young co-produced and co-wrote &quot;When Boris Met Dave&quot; (2009), a drama-documentary for Channel 4 about the relationship between Eton and Oxford University contemporaries Mayor Boris Johnson and Conservative Party Leader PM David Cameron. It was first broadcast on More4 on 7 October 2009 and later shown on Channel 4.

== Personal life ==
Before getting married, Young employed a Russian &quot;daily&quot; whom he later described as &quot;a kind of surrogate mother&quot;. Young has since complained about the difficulty of finding reliable domestic staff.

In 1997, Young met Caroline Bondy while living in New York. After they split up, Young gave up drinking, saying he &quot;thought the only way I could persuade her to get back with me would be if I sobered up&quot;. He began drinking alcohol again two years later, on their wedding day in July 2001. They have four children.

Young has admitted using cocaine at the Groucho Club in central London, and also supplying drugs to others. He was subsequently expelled from membership of the club in late 2001 for writing about the cocaine use of friends he had supplied with the drug during a 1997 photo shoot for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. Such activities are against Club rules.

== On social media ==
Young has come under criticism for comments he made on Twitter, most of which were deleted upon his appointment to the Board of the Office for Students. Young said that he posted more than 56,000 tweets, of which 8,439 remained as at January 2018.

These included what an &quot;Evening Standard&quot; editorial called &quot;an obsession with commenting on the anatomy of women in the public eye&quot;. He referred on Twitter to the cleavage of unnamed female MPs sitting behind Ed Miliband in the Commons in 2011 and 2012. When later challenged by Stella Creasy on &quot;Newsnight&quot; he said of the second such incident: &quot;It wasn&#x27;t my proudest moment&quot;. Other remarks included slurs described as homophobic, including a claim that George Clooney is &quot;as queer as a coot&quot;.

One tweet by Young was in response to a BBC Comic Relief appeal in 2009 for starving Kenyan children. During the broadcast, a Twitter user commented that she had &quot;gone through about 5 boxes of kleenex&quot; whilst watching. Toby Young replied: &quot;Me too, I wanked so much in ages&quot;. He has expressed remorse for his &quot;politically incorrect&quot; tweets.

Young is reported to have edited his own Wikipedia page 282 times over the course of six years. In October 2020, he wrote an article in &quot;The Spectator&quot; criticising &quot;lazy journalists [for whom] Wikipedia is the only thing they read when &#x27;researching&#x27; an article&quot; and stating that &quot;Wikipedia has a strong left-wing bias — which might explain why the page about me reads as if it&#x27;s been written by Owen Jones.&quot;

<text>The River Swale in Yorkshire, England, is a major tributary of the River Ure, which becomes the River Ouse, that empties into the North Sea via the Humber Estuary. The river gives its name to Swaledale, the valley through which it flows.

The river and its valley are home to many types of flora and fauna typical to the Yorkshire Dales. Like similar rivers in the region, the river carves through several types of rock and has features typical of both river and glacial erosion. The River Swale has been a contributory factor in the settlements that have been recorded throughout its history. It has provided water to aid in the raising of crops and livestock, but also in the various mining activities that have occurred since Roman times and before.

The river is said to be the fastest flowing in England and its levels have been known to rise in 20 minutes. Annual rainfall figures average 1800 mm p.a. in the headwaters and 1300 mm p.a. in the lower waters over a drop of 148 m in 32 km.

== Course ==

The source of the Swale is at the confluence of Birkdale Beck and Great Sleddale Beck. The river flows north-north-east past lead mines on its northern bank and the end of Whitsundale and then eastwards towards the first of many waterfalls in the headwaters. After flowing over Wain Wath Force the river continues south-east over Hoggarts Leap and Catrake Force near Keld, before it reaches East Gill Force and Kisdon Force. Shortly after Swinner Gill joins the river it swings sharply south towards the village of Muker where Straw Beck joins and the river turns east again. The river flows past Gunnerside towards Feetham where it turns north-east for a short while before returning east past Healaugh, Reeth and Grinton. The river then swings gently south-east and east below Marrick before turning north-eastward and then north past Marske.

The Swale returns eastward near Hudswell before it flows past the main town of the valley, Richmond. It starts a series of long south-east meanders past Brompton-on-Swale and passes under the A1 at Catterick Bridge before turning south past Catterick. The river continues long south and south-east meanders past Thrintoft and Morton-on-Swale. As it starts to pursue a more constant southerly flow it is joined by the River Wiske before passing Skipton-on-Swale, Catton, Topcliffe and Asenby. It then flows past Helperby and Myton-on-Swale before joining the River Ure.

== Natural history ==

The River Swale and its valley support a range of habitats including broadleaved, mixed and conifer woodland as well as hay meadows and grasslands. Limestone scar, bracken, scrub and heather moorland can also be found. Amongst the species of tree that can be found are ash, birch, rowan and bird cherry along with shrubs such as hawthorn, hazel and holly. There are smaller populations of yew and sycamore. Pine, larch and spruce occur mostly in plantations with alder and willow common along the river banks. The many hay meadows are filled with buttercup species and wood cranesbill.

== Geology ==

There are three distinct geological areas in Upper and Mid Swaledale. The upper reaches of the river flow over Carboniferous, Permian and Triassic rock, all of which are atop a layer of Lower Paleozoic beds. These rocks are rich in minerals and metalliferous sulfide ores such as galena, sphalerite, chalcopyrite and bravoite. There are also deposits of fluorite, barite, witherite, calcite, dolomite and barytocalcite.

Along the valley sides can be seen the typical Dales geology of Yoredale beds, alternating strata of limestone and gritstone. Small seams of coal, particularly around Tan Hill, have been found and worked. During the last Ice Age, the glacier that dominated the valley was responsible for broadening it and altering the course of the river around Keld and Round Howe. It was also responsible for cutting the Kisdon gorge. Retreat moraines lower in the river valley can be seen around Gunnerside and Grinton Bridge.

== History ==

The earliest evidence of occupation in the river valley can be dated to the Mesolithic and Neolithic Ages with the discovery of flint tools and arrowheads. Around Harkerside are some small stone circles that date to the Bronze Age and some Iron Age defensive earthworks. Evidence of lead mining has been traced back to Roman times with finds at the Hurst mine. This industry seemed to decline until after the Norse (Danish) invasions of the area. During the major ecclesiastical building of the 12th and 13th centuries, lead became a valuable commodity and mining once again increased in the valley. Evidence of the lead mining can still be seen from the remains of the 18th-century practice of &#x27;hushing&#x27; that involved creating turf dams across gills that were then released to wash away topsoil to expose the ore veins.

It was part of the Votadini Celtic kingdom of Catraeth, but in the late 6th century the river valley was invaded by Angles who took the settlement at Catraeth (now Catterick). Warriors from the Celtic Gododdin kingdom to the north attempted to dislodge them, but failed to do so at the Battle of Catraeth. The Angles then established themselves at Reeth, Stainton, Grinton Bridge and Fremington. By the mid-9th century the area had been invaded by Norsemen who settled first the lower and then the upper valley. After the Norman invasion, the lands of the valley were given to Alan the Red of Brittany who built the castle at Richmond between 1071 and 1091. It was built on a bluff overlooking the River Swale.

In the 7th century, St Paulinus supposedly immersed thousands of people in a baptismal rite at Brompton-on-Swale and further downstream at Brafferton. Because so many had been baptised in this way, 19th-century writers have labelled the Swale as &quot;England&#x27;s River Jordan&quot;. Mass baptisms are still carried out in the river around the Catterick Bridge area.

== Economy ==

Over the centuries, lead mining and cattle farming have been the main industries, but competition from the rest of the world saw them decline by the end of the 19th century. Some crop farming also took place, most notably during the warm periods of the 13th century.

Tourism now plays a major role in the economy of the river valley. The Yorkshire Dales Cycle Way follows the valley between Fremington and Gunnerside. The Coast to Coast Walk passes through Richmond to Reeth and is crossed at Keld by the Pennine Way, which goes through the upper valley from Buttertubs Pass to Muker.

<text>Partial template specialization is a particular form of class template specialization. Usually used in reference to the C++ programming language, it allows the programmer to specialize only some arguments of a class template, as opposed to explicit full specialization, where all the template arguments are provided.

== Templates and specialization ==
Class templates are really meta-classes: they are partial abstract data types that provide instructions to the compiler on how to create classes with the proper data members. For example, the C++ standard containers are class templates. When a programmer uses a vector, one instantiates it with a specific data type, for example, int, string or double. Each type of vector results in a different class in the compiler&#x27;s object code, each one working with a different data type. This process is called monomorphization of generics.

If one knows that a class template will be used with a specific data type fairly often and this data type allows some optimizations (e.g. bit shifting with integers, as opposed to multiplying or dividing by 2), one may introduce a specialized class template with some of the template parameters preset. When the compiler sees such a class template instantiated in code, it will generally choose the most specialized template definition that matches the instantiation. Therefore, an explicit full specialization (one where all the template arguments are specified) will be preferred to a partial specialization if all the template arguments match.

==Partial specialization==
Templates can have more than one parameter type. Some older compilers allow one only to specialize either all or none of the template&#x27;s parameters. Compilers that support partial specialization allow the programmer to specialize some parameters while leaving the others generic.

===Example===
Suppose there exists a codice_1 class with two template parameters, as follows.

template &lt;typename Key, typename Value&gt;
class KeyValuePair {};
The following is an example of a class that defines an explicit full template specialization of codice_1 by pairing integers with strings. The class type retains the same name as the original version.

template &lt;&gt;
class KeyValuePair&lt;int, std::string&gt; {};
The next is an example of partial specialization of codice_1 with the same name as the original version and one specialized template parameter.

template &lt;typename Key&gt;
class KeyValuePair&lt;Key, std::string&gt; {};
The next example class codice_4 is derived from the original codice_1 with a new name, and defines a partial template specialization. In contrast to the explicit specialization above, only the &quot;Value&quot; template parameter of the superclass is specialized, while the &quot;Key&quot; template parameter remains generic.

template &lt;typename Key&gt;
class KeyStringPair : public KeyValuePair&lt;Key, std::string&gt; {};
It does not matter which template parameters are specialized and which remain generic. For instance, the following is also a valid example of a partial specialization of the original codice_1 class.

template &lt;typename Value&gt;
class IntegerValuePair : public KeyValuePair&lt;int, Value&gt; {};
===Caveats===
C++ templates are not limited to classes - they can also be used to define function templates. Although function templates can be fully specialized, they &quot;cannot&quot; be partially specialized, irrespective of whether they are member function templates or non-member function templates. This can be beneficial to compiler writers, but affects the flexibility and granularity of what developers can do. But, function templates can be overloaded, which gives nearly the same effect as what partial function template specialization would have. The following examples are provided to illustrate these points.
// legal: base function template
template &lt;typename ReturnType, typename ArgumentType&gt;
ReturnType Foo(ArgumentType arg);

// legal: explicit/full function template specialization
template &lt;&gt;
std::string Foo&lt;std::string, char&gt;(char arg) { return &quot;Full&quot;; }

// illegal: partial function template specialization of the return type
// function template partial specialization is not allowed
// template &lt;typename ArgumentType&gt;
// void Foo&lt;void, ArgumentType&gt;(ArgumentType arg);

// legal: overloads the base template for a pointer argument type
template &lt;typename ReturnType, typename ArgumentType&gt;
ReturnType Foo(ArgumentType *argPtr) { return &quot;PtrOverload&quot;; }

// legal: base function name reused. Not considered an overload. ill-formed: non-overloadable declaration (see below)
template &lt;typename ArgumentType&gt;
std::string Foo(ArgumentType arg) { return &quot;Return1&quot;; }

// legal: base function name reused. Not considered an overload. ill-formed: non-overloadable declaration (see below)
template &lt;typename ReturnType&gt;
ReturnType Foo(char arg) { return &quot;Return2&quot;; }
In the example listed above, note that while the last two definitions of the function codice_7 are legal C++, they are considered ill-formed according to the standard because they are non-overloadable declarations. This is because the definition of function overloading only accounts for the function name, parameter type list and the enclosing namespace (if any). It does not account for the return type. However, these functions can still be called by explicitly indicating the signature to the compiler, as demonstrated by the following program.

// note: to be compiled in conjunction with the definitions of Foo above

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
 char c = &#x27;c&#x27;;
 std::string r0, r1, r2, r3;
 // let the compiler resolve the call
 r0 = Foo(c);
 // explicitly specify which function to call
 r1 = Foo&lt;std::string&gt;(c);
 r2 = Foo&lt;std::string, char&gt;(c);
 r3 = Foo&lt;std::string, char&gt;(&amp;c);
 // generate output
 std::cout « r0 « &quot; &quot; « r1 « &quot; &quot; « r2 « &quot; &quot; « r3 « std::endl;

<text>Social Distortion is an American punk rock band formed in 1978 in Fullerton, California. The band currently consists of Mike Ness (lead vocals, lead guitar), Jonny Wickersham (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Brent Harding (bass, backing vocals), David Hidalgo Jr. (drums), and David Kalish (keyboards).

Emerging from the Orange County hardcore scene of the late 1970s, alongside Agent Orange and the Adolescents, Social Distortion went on a temporary hiatus in the mid-1980s, due to Ness&#x27;s drug addiction and troubles with the law which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers that lasted for two years. Following their reformation, the band shifted its style to a country, blues, hard rock and early rock and roll–influenced style of punk. Since its inception, the band&#x27;s lineup has seen significant turnover, with Ness as the only constant member. Past longtime members have included guitarist Dennis Danell, bassist John Maurer and drummers Christopher Reece and Charlie Quintana. After years of performing, Social Distortion continues to tour and record music.

To date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two compilations, one live album, and two DVDs. They released two albums—&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; (1983) and &quot;Prison Bound&quot; (1988)—before signing a three-album contract with Epic Records in 1989. Social Distortion rose to fame with their 1990 self-titled third album, which produced their well-known hit singles &quot;Ball and Chain&quot;, &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, and the cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;, and was certified gold by the RIAA. Many of their later albums, including their second gold record, &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; (1992), have also been well received. Dubbed by Steven Blush as &quot;the Rolling Stones of hardcore,&quot; Social Distortion is considered one of the best-selling and most influential punk rock bands, with more than three million albums sold worldwide. The band&#x27;s most recent studio album is &quot;Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes&quot; (2011), and they have spent more than a decade working on new material for their forthcoming eighth studio album.

==History==

===Early years (1978–1982)===
Social Distortion was formed in 1978 by Mike Ness, inspired by the Sex Pistols and many other British punk bands as well as rock acts such as the Rolling Stones. Aside from Ness on guitar and Casey Royer on drums, early members included Mark Garrett on bass and former Cal State Fullerton basketball player Tom Corvin on vocals. Garrett was succeeded by Rikk Agnew in late 1978. On the origins of the band&#x27;s name, Royer recalled &quot;Mike was like 15, trying to play guitar but he couldn&#x27;t. Social Distortion was named for my distortion pedal, which I gave to Mike to play &#x27;cause back then he was no good.&quot;

Their early music was composed by Ness with lyrics by Royer and sometimes Corvin, and many songs were retired after only a few performances. After Corvin left in the fall of 1979 to attend graduate school at Bob Jones University, Ness recruited his high school friend Dennis Danell to join the band on guitar even though Danell had never played an instrument before. When Danell was brought in, the other members left as they did not want to wait for him to learn. Before joining the Adolescents in 1980, Royer and Agnew played with Garrett in a separate band named Social Distortion consisting of Royer on vocals, Garrett on bass, Rikk Agnew on drums, and Frank Agnew and Tim Maag on guitars. Social Distortion&#x27;s first real show was in early 1979 at the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest nightclub on Placentia Avenue in Costa Mesa, California. Ness and Danell would remain the only constant members for the next two decades with bass and drum members changing every few years. Both the Adolescents song &quot;Kids of the Black Hole&quot; and Social Distortion song &quot;The Playpen&quot; chronicled this period of the band&#x27;s history.

Social Distortion’s first single, “Mainliner” b/w “Playpen” featuring Ness on guitar and vocals, Danell on bass, and Carrot on drums, was issued in 1981 by Posh Boy, the label responsible for releasing the first singles and albums of many of the local O.C. punk bands. Rodney Bingenheimer of KROQ-FM was responsible for much of the radio play in Orange County, California, that punk received in the early 80s, and took a liking to Social Distortion, featuring the single &quot;1945&quot; on the second volume of the compilation album, &quot;Rodney on the ROQ&quot;. The same song would also appear on 1983’s &quot;Blood on the ROQ&quot; and 1989’s &quot;The Best Of Rodney on the ROQ&quot; compilations.

In 1982, the band—now consisting of Ness, Danell (who now played rhythm guitar), Brent Liles on bass, and Derek O&#x27;Brien on drums—embarked on their first bi-national tour of the US and Canada with fellow punk band Youth Brigade. The trip was chronicled in the punk rockumentary &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;, which was not released until 1984.

===&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;, temporary hiatus and &quot;Prison Bound&quot; (1983–1988)===
After returning from the &quot;Another State of Mind&quot; tour in 1982, Social Distortion began work on their debut album, &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot;. Recorded in December of 1982, the album was released in early 1983 on the band’s own label, 13th Floor Records. &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; includes the title track as well as the song for which the previous tour was named, &quot;Another State of Mind&quot;. This was the album that &quot;gained the band a national name in punk circles&quot;.

Ness mentions in his DVD commentary that he really had nowhere to stay when he got back to California after the tour ended, so he crashed on the couches of whoever would have him. He details how he plunged headfirst into serious drug addiction and ended up being strung out on heroin for weeks at a time. In 1983, Liles and O&#x27;Brien left the band in the middle of a show on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and were replaced soon thereafter by Ness&#x27; high school friend John Maurer and a man named Bob Stubbs. This line-up lasted only a short time until Christopher Reece joined on drums. Ness&#x27;s drug habit continued throughout 1984 and 1985 as the band continued to gain success with &quot;Another State of Mind&quot; appearing as one of the punk rarities on MTV, and touring in California and Arizona. As a result of Ness&#x27;s escalating drug habit and troubles with the law, Social Distortion briefly went on hiatus in 1985. During this time, Ness was in and out of various rehabilitation centers and jails.

Social Distortion resurfaced in 1986, when Ness completed a drug rehabilitation program. The band released its second album, &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, two years later in 1988—over five years after their debut. The album included John Maurer on bass and Christopher Reece on drums. Although &quot;Prison Bound&quot; never charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;, the title track had received extensive airplay on the Los Angeles radio station, KROQ-FM.

A notable style change takes place in &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, which takes on a definite country/western flavor and marks the start of the band&#x27;s entrance into a rock subgenre sometimes called &quot;cowpunk.&quot; Country legend Johnny Cash and the Rolling Stones&#x27; honky tonk style became more prominent influences on Social Distortion&#x27;s music at this time. There are references to Cash and the Stones in the songs &quot;Prison Bound&quot; and &quot;On My Nerves.&quot;

The multi-year gap between albums became a pattern for Social Distortion. Ness acknowledges in a 2003 interview that it &quot;is&quot; a little backward, marketing-wise, to play songs for the fans for a few years before recording them—but it has always worked well for them. &quot;We know which songs are going to be fan favorites on the record before we even record them.&quot;

===Major label years and mainstream success (1989–1996)===
After the release of &quot;Prison Bound&quot;, Social Distortion left Restless Records and signed with Epic. The band then returned to the studio around the summer/fall of 1989, with producer Dave Jerden, to begin recording their self-titled third album, which was released in 1990. It was Social Distortion&#x27;s first album that was not financed by the band. The album includes the singles &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; and &quot;Story of My Life&quot; as well as a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. The self-titled album, which was the band&#x27;s first to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, fared better than both &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; and &quot;Prison Bound,&quot; and is often credited as Social Distortion&#x27;s best known work, with sales continuing years after its release. It is also sometimes cited as among the best rock albums of 1990—the album is said to &quot;split the difference between rockabilly and Ramones-style punk.&quot;

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;, was released in 1992. The album included two hit singles: &quot;Bad Luck&quot;, and &quot;When She Begins&quot;. &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot; surpassed all their previous albums in popularity. The album has a similar sound to the previous, eponymous, album, said to be a blend of &quot;punk, blues, country and rockabilly&quot;. After the release of this album, drummer Christopher Reece left Social Distortion in 1994 and was replaced by Randy Carr. Carr toured with the band and played drums on live performances until he left in 1995.

The band took another hiatus after the release of &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;, and did not return to the studio until 1995. During the break, Social Distortion released a compilation album, &quot;&quot; (1995), featuring pre-&quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; cuts. It contains two versions of &quot;1945&quot; and &quot;Playpen&quot; from their two indie labels, 13th Floor and Posh Boy, and also a cover of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;.

In June 1994, the band began demoing songs for the fifth album, then returned to the studio in 1995 to record &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot;, which was released in 1996. The album is said to have taken on a harder sound than those preceding it, and to not focus as much on their previous blues and rockabilly sound. The single &quot;I Was Wrong&quot; received wide radio play and is said to resemble &quot;the classic sound more than any other track on the album&quot;. The album also features the singles &quot;When the Angels Sing,&quot; which is said to be a tribute to Ness&#x27;s grandmother, who was an avid supporter of the band, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Drag Me Down&quot;. The album also included a re-recorded version of &quot;Under My Thumb&quot;, a cover of the Rolling Stones song, as a hidden track. Former Danzig drummer Chuck Biscuits joined the band between the recording and release of the album, and is credited in the liner notes although this album actually features one time Journey drummer Deen Castronovo. &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; was the final Social Distortion album recorded with Dennis Danell before his death in 2000.

===Second hiatus, Danell&#x27;s death and &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; (1997–2004)===
In 1997, Social Distortion left Epic and returned to Time Bomb Recordings for the first time in eight years. It released its first (and only) live album, &quot;Live at the Roxy&quot; in 1998. Social Distortion went on hiatus again as Ness went solo, releasing two albums, &quot;Cheating at Solitaire&quot; and &quot;Under the Influences&quot;, featuring song covers, in 1999.

Dennis Danell died on February 29, 2000, in his Newport Beach home after apparently suffering a brain aneurysm, leaving Ness as the only remaining original member of the band. There have been some rumors claiming that the band broke up again, following his death. He was replaced by former U.S. Bombs, Cadillac Tramps and L.A.&#x27;s Youth Brigade guitarist Jonny Wickersham, who had previously been Danell&#x27;s guitar technician. Biscuits also left during that time, and was replaced by Charlie Quintana. After Danell&#x27;s death, the band continued touring semi-frequently, playing sold-out shows in the Los Angeles area around the New Year for three straight years.
Social Distortion started work on the follow-up to &quot;White Light, White Heat, White Trash&quot; in 2000, which was originally to be released in the fall of that year, but it was not completed. Since 2001, due to the band&#x27;s ongoing tour schedule, the album&#x27;s release was put on hold several times. In the fall of 2003, after completing demos, Social Distortion returned to the studio with producer Cameron Webb to complete the album. &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album with Wickersham and Quintana. A month before its September 28, 2004, release, longtime bassist John Maurer left the band to stay with his family, and was replaced by Rancid&#x27;s Matt Freeman, who was replaced later that year by current bassist Brent Harding.

===Subsequent activities and departure of Quintana (2005–2009)===
Social Distortion continued touring on and off between 2005 and 2007. The band was scheduled to headline the Soundwave Festival in Australia in February–March 2008, along with Incubus and The Offspring, but they cancelled their appearance and released the following statement:

Due to circumstances beyond our control, Social Distortion is regrettably unable to perform at Soundwave Festival 2008 in Australia and must officially withdraw from the bill. We apologise for any inconvenience to our Australian fans and hope to make it there as soon as possible.

During this time, the band played with various other bands, including Versus the World, Tsar, Shooter Jennings, I Hate Kate, the Black Halos, Flogging Molly, Nine Black Alps, Supersuckers, Blackpool Lights, the Lost City Angels, the Street Dogs, the Backyard Babies, the Hangmen, the Eyeliners, Cooper, the Stun Gunz, Mest, Bullets and Octane, and the Dead 60s.

In February 2006, Ness was injured and broke his wrist in a skateboarding accident. For several months, T.S.O.L. guitarist Ron Emory and the Hangmen&#x27;s Bryan Small played guitar while Ness sang with his arm in a cast and sling.

Original member Brent Liles, who played bass on &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster,&quot; died on January 18, 2007, after being hit by a semi truck while riding a dirt bike in Placentia, California.

Social Distortion released its first &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilation on June 26, 2007. It includes hit singles from &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; to &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;, yet lacks any song from &quot;&quot;. Along with a new studio recording of the song, &quot;Far Behind&quot;, new studio recordings of 6 of their classic songs are included as well. Rerecording these songs allowed the band to own rights to them again, instead of Epic (their former label) owning them. Through iTunes in the U.S., as a download only, the Greatest Hits also includes a new Social Distortion cover version of the Chuck Berry classic &quot;Maybellene&quot;. Ness stated in an interview that this &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; technically means &quot;what was good with radio&quot;. Ness also stated in the same interview that &quot;we may follow this up with something that is more essential Social D. – songs that are the band&#x27;s favorites.&quot;

In April 2009 the band announced that longtime drummer Charlie Quintana was leaving the band:

After ten amazing years behind the drum kit for Social Distortion, Charlie &quot;Chalo&quot; Quintana has announced he&#x27;s moving on to explore other musical opportunities. Charlie had this to say about his departure, &quot;Playing with Social D for ten years was a good time in my life. I was lucky to play on two Social D records and the second solo album, and I am proud to have been part of the band. We hit some spectacular heights which I will never forget – adios amigos!&quot;

Quintana&#x27;s replacement was announced as Angels &amp; Airwaves drummer Adam &quot;Atom&quot; Willard, formerly of Rocket from the Crypt and The Offspring.

A European tour together with the Gaslight Anthem followed in June 2009 as part of the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary of underground Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll.

===&quot;Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes&quot; (2009–2011)===
In April 2008, Ness told Spinner that Social Distortion was planning an acoustic album to be released in 2009, stating &quot;I think it could be really, really neat. It&#x27;s almost like a Bob Dylan/Bruce Springsteen/Johnny Cash kind of feel with a punk edge ... but acoustic. Sometimes [the songs] are more powerful stripped down than with full volume.&quot; Ness also revealed plans for his next solo album, but he was not sure if it was going to be released before or after the follow-up to &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot; or the acoustic album.

In July 2009, Ness revealed to Russian&#x27;s Tarakany! Bad TV that Social Distortion was planning to enter the studio in December 2009 or the beginning of 2010 to begin recording a follow-up to &quot;Sex, Love and Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll&quot;. In September that year, he said the album would be recorded in January 2010 at Studio 606, a studio owned by the Foo Fighters. Asked when the album was expected to be released, Ness guessed spring or summer of 2010.

On December 29, 2009, Social Distortion&#x27;s official website announced the band&#x27;s first South American tour in April. Ness commented, &quot;The band and I are really looking forward to our tour of South America. From the overwhelming amount of emails we receive from our fans in South America, it&#x27;s crazy to think that it&#x27;s taken this long for us to come down and tour. We couldn&#x27;t be more thrilled to announce that we&#x27;re finally making it happen and we look forward to meeting our loyal fans in Brazil and Argentina for the first time. We hope to come home with a few new fans as well&quot;.

On February 7, 2010, Social Distortion announced on its Twitter account that it would start recording a new album on February 8.

In a February 2010 interview with Spinner, Ness revealed that the band had just tracked twelve songs, and was &quot;going to probably track another five&quot;. He says the self-produced, still-untitled album, which he hopes to release before the end of the year, will feature the classic Social Distortion sound – a combination of punk, rockabilly and country, presumably. He explained, &quot;It&#x27;s funny – the record reminds me very much of &quot;Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell&quot;, but also I&#x27;m bringing elements of early New York &#x27;70s punk, influences that maybe haven&#x27;t come out as prominently in my writing in the past. It&#x27;s a little more Johnny Thunders. Some of the early first wave of punk was very blues-based rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, but it had this urban snottiness to it.&quot; Ness also explained what happened to the acoustic album, which was announced back in 2008, &quot;The acoustic thing is just a future project, which I think will be significant and equally important. But as far as the priority goes, it&#x27;s more important now to get a studio record out that is a regular record&quot;.
While recording the album, Social Distortion announced in March 2010 that Adam Willard &quot;...will no longer be able to continue on drums...&quot;, &quot;...due to many foreseeable scheduling conflicts with his band Angels And Airwaves...&quot;. Fu Manchu drummer Scott Reeder filled in for Willard for the South American tour.

On April 1, 2010, it was reported on the official Social Distortion website that the band was taking a break from the studio to rehearse for their South American tour.

Social Distortion was one of the headliners at Lollapalooza 2010. Prior to this, they embarked on an East Coast tour that July and August.

On May 11, 2010, Epitaph Records officially announced that they have signed Social Distortion.

On May 20, 2010, Social Distortion updated their Twitter with this post saying, &quot;the album is tracked... finishing up writing and getting ready to head back into the studio to record vocals.&quot; The album is said to be a return to their punk rock roots and will focus on the New York punk of the 70s and early 80s.

Social Distortion announced a full US tour in the fall of 2010 in support of their new album, supported by Frank Turner and Lucero.

As of July 2010, Scott Reeder was replaced by David Hidalgo Jr., formerly of Suicidal Tendencies.
At a show in Poughkeepsie, New York, on July 27, 2010, frontman Mike Ness revealed that the new Social Distortion album would be called &quot;Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes&quot;. Despite being planned for a November 2010 release, the band announced that the album would be released on January 18, 2011. They also mentioned that &quot;Machine Gun Blues&quot; would be the album&#x27;s first single and available for download via iTunes on November 16. On December 6, Social Distortion made their network television debut on Jimmy Kimmel Live! performing Machine Gun Blues and Story of My Life.

Social Distortion joined the ritual at The Voodoo Experience 2011 in City Park in New Orleans, Louisiana on October 28–30, 2011.

On August 6, 2011, Social Distortion performed a live set for &quot;Guitar Center Sessions&quot; on DirecTV. The episode included an interview with program host, Nic Harcourt.

===Purported future albums (2011–present)===
Asked in a January 2011 interview with Performer Magazine if Social Distortion intended to record more albums for Epitaph, Ness replied, &quot;I would suspect so, yes.&quot; Also in a January 2011 interview with Exclaim, Mike Ness said that there would not be another seven- or eight-year wait between Social Distortion albums. Ness stated, &quot;Although this record is out, I&#x27;m going to continue the process of writing so maybe there won&#x27;t be such a large gap between records. Even when the record&#x27;s done, it doesn&#x27;t mean the creativity of writing is.&quot; In his interview with Frank Turner, Ness stated that his goal was to make a new Social Distortion album in two years and wanted it to be different from &quot;Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes&quot;. In an August 2011, interview at his home in Los Angeles, Ness said that he did not want &quot;too many years to go by before the next Social D record. I&#x27;m really trying to be a little bit more disciplined. That&#x27;s really what it comes down to. It&#x27;s not like it takes me eight years to write a record. Once I get out of that mode, I&#x27;m out of that mode completely. Then of course, it&#x27;s hard to get back and write a record. This time, when this record was finished, the creative process didn&#x27;t end just because the record was done.&quot;

In May 2012, Ness stated that Social Distortion was expected to begin writing their eighth studio album in January 2013. On July 22, 2015, in an interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Ness said he wrote songs that he forgot a few days later. He stated that the band were banking on a 2016 release date and that some songs that he considered to be filler were getting praise from his bandmates.

In 2015, the band toured to celebrate the 25th anniversary of their self-titled album.

In a March 2017 interview with &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;, Ness revealed that the band has about 20 new songs in various stages of completion, and said that they range from garage punk to the gospel-inspired. Later that month, he said that he has been &quot;reading and writing, and kind of wrapping my mind around the self-imposed challenge that I&#x27;ve put on myself: that I&#x27;ve got to write the record of my career. So I&#x27;ve got to raise the bar. That&#x27;s just something that I put on myself because I don&#x27;t like to just go, &#x27;Time to put out another record&#x27; and go through the motions.&quot; He also hinted at the band entering the studio in about six months. In an interview with &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, which also took place in March 2017, Ness stated that his goal was to be in the studio by fall, and added, &quot;I have to write the record of my career right now. That&#x27;s the pressure I put on myself.&quot; In a June 2018 interview with &quot;Edmonton Journal&quot;, Ness said, &quot;I&#x27;ve put a few new songs in the set just to let people know that we&#x27;re not sitting on our asses at home. It gets people talking, which is nice. But yeah, once we stop touring in November, we&#x27;ll be ready. I&#x27;m thinking that by January we&#x27;ll be pre-production, but I don&#x27;t want to rush something out just to get it out.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Orange County Register&quot; in November 2022, Ness mentioned that, with over 40-50 songs written, Social Distortion has been working on two new albums, with the first to be released in 2023 and the second to be recorded a year later, and added, &quot;That would make people faint. I want to do that, though. I&#x27;m going to try to do that. I want to shock people.&quot;

Social Distortion toured Europe from May to July 2022.

On April 7, 2023, Ness and Social Distortion posted to their Instagram pages that pre production on the band&#x27;s next album was completed and that they would begin recording it on April 17 for an early 2024 release.

On June 7, 2023, Mike Ness announced that he was diagnosed with stage one tonsil cancer and is expected to make a full recovery from surgery. The band&#x27;s upcoming tour was postponed as was work on their upcoming studio album. Ness said of the album&#x27;s delay: &quot;While it will take a little longer, I promise you that it will be delivered and it will exceed your expectations&quot;.

On December 12, 2023, Social Distortion announced that they would be doing a co-headlining tour with Bad Religion in April and May 2024 which saw the band perform &quot;Mommy&#x27;s Little Monster&quot; in its entirety to celebrate the album&#x27;s belated 40th anniversary. Social Distortion will also do their own headlining tour in September and October 2024.

When asked in the May 2024 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot; about the status of his health and Social Distortion&#x27;s upcoming plans, Ness said, &quot;I was halfway through recording the next album when I got cancer, so that&#x27;s had to go on hold while I&#x27;ve been working on getting better. I had rough guide vocals laid down, and when I listen to the tracks I think they&#x27;re some of my best work, so I&#x27;m looking forward to finishing the album. It&#x27;s going to be a really great record. I&#x27;m going on the road in the spring, which will be the first time I&#x27;ve sung live since the cancer on my tonsils. I&#x27;ve been doing my therapy and working hard. There&#x27;s a lot of pressure knowing that I&#x27;ve got shows booked, but it&#x27;s a good pressure as it puts a lot of focus on my efforts. I guess the album won&#x27;t be finished until I complete the tour, by which time I hope my voice will be back to full strength, which means the record probably won&#x27;t be out until 2025. It seems a long way off, but it will be well worth the wait.&quot;

==Logo==

The band has consistently used as their logo a skeleton holding a cigarette and a martini glass. It was designed by Mackie Osborne, wife of Melvins frontman Buzz Osborne, as part of an invitation to a New Year&#x27;s Eve party. It is frequently featured in live performances as well as album covers. Said Ness in an April 2011 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;At the time, I saw that, and it just felt like, &#x27;That&#x27;s it right there. It&#x27;s life and death, it&#x27;s celebration.&#x27; It just felt powerful.&quot;

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==

Social Distortion has been described as primarily punk rock, cowpunk, hardcore punk, and melodic hardcore.

Some critics have labeled the band as roots rock, pop-punk, and alternative rock.

Social Distortion&#x27;s musical style began as decidedly hardcore punk when the band formed in the late 1970s. They are thought to be one of the pioneering bands of the original Southern California punk rock movement out of Orange County, California, and their style closely associated with the Adolescents, Agent Orange, the Germs, and other bands from that place and time. In the mid-&#x27;80s there was a notable change in their style of music – taking more from country music and rock and roll. Mike Ness admits in the DVD commentary from &quot;Another State of Mind&quot; that he may have even tried &quot;too&quot; hard on the &quot;Prison Bound&quot; album. They did eventually find their niche, and the majority of their albums from the mid-80s on to the early &#x27;90s featured a melodic punk sound that is distinctly – and distinctively – their own.

Social Distortion&#x27;s music is influenced by bands and artists such as Johnny Cash, Hank Williams, Bob Dylan, Eddie Cochran, the Rolling Stones, the Sex Pistols, the Clash, New York Dolls, Dead Boys, and the Ramones. Social Distortion have influenced bands such as Pennywise, Face to Face, Avenged Sevenfold, Black Veil Brides, Pearl Jam, Rancid, the Offspring, Volbeat and Rise Against. The band began playing with fellow Orange County, California, bands such as the Adolescents, China White, Shattered Faith and T.S.O.L. The music was fast, angry and energetic.

All of Social Distortion&#x27;s songs are written and sung by Mike Ness. There is a common theme in most of his lyrics about &quot;impulsiveness, its consequences and the hard struggle to overcome&quot;.

<doc id="930171" wikidata="Q5589278" url="?curid=930171" title="Government of Ohio">
<text>The government of the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] consists of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches. Its basic structure is set forth in the Constitution and law of Ohio.

==Executive branch==
The daily administration of the state’s laws are carried out by six elected statewide officials; the chief executive the Governor, and their second in command the Lieutenant Governor, the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, and by the staff and employees of the executive branch agencies.

All are elected statewide for four-year terms, all on a partisan ballot, with the Governor and Lieutenant Governor elected on a single ticket.

===Departments===
The state government is primarily organized into several cabinet or administrative departments:

* Department of Administrative Services
* Department of Aging
* Department of Agriculture
* Office of Budget and Management 
* Department of Commerce
* Department of Development
* Department of Developmental Disabilities
* Department of Education
* Environmental Protection Agency
* Department of Health
* Department of Insurance
* Department of Job and Family Services
* Department of Medicaid
* Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services
* Department of Natural Resources
* Department of Public Safety
* Department of Rehabilitation and Correction
* Department of Taxation
* Department of Transportation
* Department of Veterans Services
* Department of Youth Services

Notices and proposed rules are published in the &quot;Register of Ohio&quot;, which are codified in the &quot;Ohio Administrative Code&quot; (OAC).

==Legislative branch==

The legislative branch, the Ohio General Assembly, is made up of two houses: the Senate and the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives is composed of 99 members elected from single-member districts of equal population. Each of the 33 senate districts is formed by combining three house districts. Senators serve four-year staggered terms and representatives serve two-year terms. The General Assembly, with the approval of the Governor, draws the U.S. congressional district lines for Ohio&#x27;s 15 seats in the United States House of Representatives. The Ohio Apportionment Board draws state legislative district lines in Ohio.

In order to be enacted into law, a bill must be adopted by both houses of the General Assembly and signed by the Governor. If the Governor vetoes a bill, the General Assembly can override the veto with a three-fifths supermajority of both houses. A bill will also become a law if the Governor fails to sign or veto it within 10 days of its being presented. The session laws are published in the official &quot;Laws of Ohio&quot;. These in turn have been codified in the &quot;Ohio Revised Code&quot;.

==Judicial branch==
The judicial branch is headed by the Ohio Supreme Court, which has one chief justice and six associate justices, each elected to staggered six-year terms.

There are several other levels of elected judiciary in the Ohio court system:
*State court of claims, which has jurisdiction over all civil actions against the State of Ohio in situations in which the state has waived its sovereign immunity.
*State courts of appeal (12 district appeals courts): These are the intermediate appellate courts.
*County courts of common pleas: 88 county common pleas courtsThese are the principal courts of first instance for civil and criminal matters. In populous areas, there are often several divisions, such as general, juvenile, probate, and domestic relations.
*Municipal courts and county courtsthese courts primarily handle minor matters, such as traffic adjudication and other misdemeanor and small claims.

Judges in Ohio are generally elected, except for the Court of Claims, for which judges sit by assignment of the chief justice. When there are temporary vacancies in elected judgeships, those vacancies are also filled by assignment by the chief justice.

==Local government==

There are also several levels of local government in Ohio: counties, municipalities (cities and villages), townships, special districts and school districts.

Ohio is divided into 88 counties. Ohio law defines a structure for county government, although they may adopt charters for home rule. Summit County and Cuyahoga County have chosen an alternate form of government. The other counties have a government with a three-member board of county commissioners, a sheriff, coroner, auditor, treasurer, clerk of the court of common pleas prosecutor, engineer, and recorder.

There are two kinds of incorporated municipalities, 251 cities and 681 villages. If a municipality has five thousand or more residents as of the last United States Census it is a city, otherwise it is a village. Municipalities have full home rule powers, may adopt a charter, ordinances and resolutions for self-government. Each municipality chooses its own form of government, but most have elected mayors and city councils or city commissions. City governments provide much more extensive services than county governments, such as police forces and paid (as opposed to volunteer) fire departments.

The entire area of the state is encompassed by townships. When the boundaries of a township are coterminous with the boundaries of a city or village, the township ceases to exist as a separate government (called a paper township). Townships are governed by a three-member board of township trustees. Townships may have limited home rule powers.

There are more than 600 city, local, and exempted village school districts providing K-12 education in Ohio, as well as about four dozen joint vocation school districts which are separate from the K-12 districts. Each city school district, local school district, or exempted village school district is governed by an elected board of education. A school district previously under state supervision (municipal school district) may be governed by a board whose members either are elected or appointed by the mayor of the municipality containing the greatest portion of the district&#x27;s area.

<text>&quot;&quot; (; &quot;King&#x27;s Song&quot;) is Norway&#x27;s royal anthem. The lyrics come in several versions. The first version (&quot;&quot;) was written by N. Vogtmann around 1800, but the version used today and quoted below was written by Gustav Jensen for the coronation of Haakon VII and Maud of Wales in 1906 and later used in his &quot;Landstads reviderte salmebok&quot;. It was inspired by the British royal and national anthem and set to the tune of &quot;God Save the King&quot;; Henrik Wergeland wrote a translation of &quot;God Save the King&quot; in 1841, dedicated to King Carl Johan of Norway and Sweden.

<text>Kuiu Island is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in southeastern Alaska. It lies between Kupreanof Island, to its east, and Baranof Island, to its west. The island is long, and wide. It is nearly cut in two by Affleck Canal. It has of land area, making it the 16th largest island in the United States. The entire island is part of Tongass National Forest. 

The island&#x27;s name comes from Kuiu Kwaan people of the Tlingit who lived here post glaciation. Kuiu in Tlingit means stomach. After a smallpox epidemic that nearly wiped out the entire village, the survivors moved to the neighboring Tlingit communities of Kake and Klawock. After the destruction of the Kuiu Kwaan community, white homesteaders occupied the island under the homestead act. Many of the current population are descendants of these homesteaders. 

The population was 10 persons at the 2000 census. It is separated from Baranof Island by Chatham Strait. The Cape Decision Light is located on Kuiu Island. Also on the island are the Kuiu Wilderness and the Tebenkof Bay Wilderness areas.

<doc id="930178" wikidata="Q1763834" url="?curid=930178" title="Azov campaigns (1695–1697)">
<text>The Azov campaigns of 1695–1697 () were two Russian military campaigns during the Russo-Turkish War of 1686–1700, led by Peter the Great and aimed at capturing the Turkish fortress of Azov (garrison – 7,000 men) with the aim of controlling the southern mouth of the Don River gaining access to the Sea of Azov and entrance to the Black Sea. Despite stubborn resistance and heavy casualties, the Russians under General Sheremetev after a failed siege in 1695 managed to capture the fort, accompanied by a naval force, in July 1696, marking the first major Russian victory against the Turks.

== First Azov campaign ==
The first Azov campaign began in the spring of 1695. Peter the Great ordered his army (31,000 men and 170 guns) to advance towards Azov. The army comprised crack regiments and the Don Cossacks and was divided into three units under the command of Franz Lefort, Patrick Gordon and Avtonom Golovin. Supplies were shipped down the Don from Voronezh.
In 1693 the Ottoman garrison of the fortress was 3,656, of whom 2,272 were Janissaries.
Between June 27-July 5 the Russians blocked Azov from land but could not control the river and prevent resupply. After two unsuccessful attacks on August 5 and September 25, the siege was lifted on October 1.

Another Russian army (120,000 men, mostly cavalry, Streltsy, Ukrainian Cossacks and Kalmyks) under the command of Boris Sheremetev set out for the lower reaches of the Dnieper to take the Ottoman forts there. The main fort at Gazi-Kerman was taken when its powder magazine blew up, as well as Islam-Kerman, Tagan and Tavan, but the Russians were not able to hold the area and withdrew most of their forces. By the Treaty of Constantinople (1700) the remaining Russians were withdrawn and the lower Dnieper was declared a demilitarized zone.

== Second Azov campaign ==
At the end of 1695 the Russians began preparing for the second Azov campaign. By the spring of 1696 they had built a fleet of ships at Voronezh
with a view to blocking Turkish reinforcement of the garrison at Azov. The cavalry under the command of Sheremetev (up to 70,000 men) was once again sent to the lower reaches of the Dnieper. From April 23–26 the main forces (75,000 men) under the command of Aleksei Shein started to advance towards Azov by land and water (the rivers of Voronezh and Don). Peter I and his galley fleet left for Azov on May 3. On May 27 the Russian fleet (two ships-of-the-line, four fire ships, 23 galleys and miscellaneous vessels, built at Voronezh and nearby locations) under the command of Lefort reached the sea and blocked Azov. On June 14 the Turkish fleet (23 ships with 4,000 men) appeared at the mouth of the Don. However, it left after having lost two ships in combat. The Russian forces conducted a massive bombardment from land and sea, and Ukrainian and Don Cossacks seized the external rampart of the fortress on July 17. The Azov garrison surrendered on July 19.
== Third Azov campaign ==
On April 6, Russian troops (35,000 people - soldiers and riflemen) led by Generalissimo Alexei Semenovich Shein and General Patrick Gordon set out from Moscow for the Azov region. In April, 34 Turkish galleys landed troops (5,000 people) on the Kuban, which headed for Azov. Russian troops approached Azov on June 5. On June 20, Fort Alekseevsky was built near Azov, and on July 4, Fort Petrovsky. Construction of the Taganrog fortress and Fort Pavlovsky began. On July 20, the Russian camp near Azov was attacked by a Crimean-Turkish army (17,000 people - 12,000 Crimean Tatars and Nogais and 5,000 Turks). The attack was repelled. The Turks and Crimeans lost about 2,000 people killed. On August 8, Alexei Shein’s army left Azov and reached Valuyki on August 24.
== Aftermath ==
The Azov campaigns demonstrated the significance of having a fleet and marked the beginning of Russia&#x27;s becoming a maritime power. Russia&#x27;s success at Azov strengthened its positions during the Karlowitz Congress of 1698–1699 and favored the signing of the Treaty of Constantinople in 1700.
As Azov&#x27;s harbor was not convenient for the military fleet, the Tsar selected another more appropriate site on July 27, 1696, on the cape Tagan-Rog (Taganrog). On September 12, 1698, Taganrog was founded there, which became the first military base of the Russian Navy.

Although the campaign was a success, it was evident to Peter I of Russia that he achieved only partial results, since his fleet was bottled up in the Sea of Azov due to Crimean and Ottoman control of the Strait of Kerch. A regular navy and specialists who could build and navigate military ships were necessary for resisting the Ottoman attacks. On October 20, 1696, the Boyar Duma decreed the creation of the regular Imperial Russian Navy; this date is considered to be the birthdate of the Russian Navy. The first shipbuilding program consisted of 52 vessels.

In 1697, a Russian ambassador present at the Safavid court raised an issue by handing over a note which stipulated that &quot;Lezgi, Circassian, and other Caucasian tribesmen, ostensibly Persian subjects&quot;, had provided assistance to the Ottomans during the Azov campaigns. The report also included the request to declare war on the Ottomans, as well as to repay some 300,000 tomans to the Russians, which the report asserted were owed to the Tsar &quot;since the days of shah Safi&quot; (r. 1629–1642).

Russia was forced to give up its territorial gains fourteen years later in 1711 following Ottoman successes in the Pruth River Campaign in the midst of the Great Northern War. Russia retook the region in the Russo-Turkish War of 1735–1739 (further confirmed after the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774) and it remains part of Rostov Oblast today.

<text>Sumner Strait is a strait in the Alexander Archipelago in the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It is about long and wide, extending from the mouth of the Stikine River to Iphigenia Bay on the Gulf of Alaska, separating Mitkof Island, Kupreanof Island, and Kuiu Island on the north from Zarembo Island and Prince of Wales Island on the south.

The fur trader William Brown was the first European to visit the strait about 1793. Later the same year James Johnstone, one of George Vancouver&#x27;s officers during his 1791-95 expedition, charted it. It was named in 1875 by W. H. Dall in honor of Charles Sumner.

The Cape Decision Light is a notable aid-to-navigation on Sumner Strait.

<doc id="930185" wikidata="Q765662" url="?curid=930185" title="Water motorsports at the 1908 Summer Olympics">
<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, three motorboat racing events were contested. Various sources refer to the sport as &quot;water motorsports&quot;, &quot;motor boats&quot;, and &quot;power boating&quot;. The 1900 and 1908 Summer Games were the only ones to feature motorised sports (motor racing was featured in 1900). The IOC has never decided which events were &quot;Olympic&quot; and which were not.

All three events used the same distance: five laps around an 8-nautical-mile course for a total of . In each of the events, multiple boats started; however, only one finished due primarily to the gale that was blowing during the course of the competition. Events were held on 28 August and 29 August 1908.

==Medal summary==

The water motorsports event was quickly abolished, because after these games the IOC decided that the Olympics was not intended for motorized competition.

==Participating nations==
17 boaters from 2 nations competed.

==Events==

===Class A — Open class===

The open class was scheduled to take place on the first day of competition, 28 August. Two boats, &quot;Wolseley-Siddely&quot; and &quot;Dylan&quot;, began the race. &quot;Dylan&quot; abandoned the race partway through the first lap, with &quot;Wolseley-Siddely&quot; finishing first before the weather became too severe to continue the race.

A second attempt to run the event took place the next day after the other two races had been completed. &quot;Wolseley-Siddely&quot; again started, this time against &quot;Camille&quot; (the only French boat to take part in competition). &quot;Wolseley-Siddely&quot; ran aground on a mud spit, leaving &quot;Camille&quot; to finish alone for the gold medal.

===Class B — Under 60 feet===

The B class was held on 28 August after the abortive first running of the open class. Again, only two boats appeared at the starting line: &quot;Quicksilver&quot; and &quot;Gyrinus&quot;. &quot;Quicksilver&quot; became threatened by water coming in over the sides, abandoning the race. &quot;Gyrinus&quot;, a small boat with an extra crewman to bail water, was able to finish to make its crew the first Olympic champions in motorsports. &quot;Gyrinus&quot; was the earliest round-bilge Semi-Planing Mono-Hull (&#x27;SPMH&#x27;) designed by Sir John Isaac Thornycroft FRS, the great Victorian engineer, previously the designer and builder of the world&#x27;s first torpedo boats and torpedo boat &#x27;Destroyers&#x27;. Development of the technical features of &quot;Gyrinus&quot; (combining speed with good seaworthiness, as demonstrated in the 1908 Olympics) was described in &#x27;Engineering&#x27;, the Proceedings of the Society of Civil Engineers, on March 12, 1909. His son, Isaac Thomas Thornycroft, the &quot;Gyrinus&quot; helmsman, became a yacht designer and helmsman of J-Class racing yachts. Thomas&#x27;s son, Commander Peter Thornycroft (1914–1987), carried on the family tradition, developing the SPMH as the standard Nelson Class of Pilot Boat for Trinity House (1964 to 1987) and, later, up to much larger sizes of offshore patrol vessels. The US Navy&#x27;s 350 ft./114-metre/3,200-ton/45-knot USS &quot;Freedom&quot; is the largest SPMH launched to date (2006). It combines a higher speed-for-length than would be possible with a conventional destroyer hull, good seakeeping at speed, and a high payload—characteristics that enabled the little &quot;Gyrinus&quot; to win her famous Olympic victories.

===Class C — 6.5–8 metres===

The first race of 29 August was the small class of boats. &quot;Gyrinus&quot;, which had won the B class the day before, appeared again. This time her competition was &quot;Sea Dog&quot;. Again, however, &quot;Gyrinus&quot; was the only boat to finish, as &quot;Sea Dog&quot; experienced engine problems and had to be towed off the course.

<text>This article gives an overview of liberalism and radicalism in [[Hungary]]. It is limited to liberal and radical parties with substantial support, mainly proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign ⇒ denotes another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is not necessary that parties labeled themselves as a liberal party.

==Background==
From the start of liberalism in Hungary its program is combined with the struggle for independence from the Habsburg-rule and thus more autonomy in the country&#x27;s affairs in relation with the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary. The two realists groups, Deákists and Kossuthists, differ in their attitude towards the Habsburg rulers. Both groups had a conservative liberal or even conservative philosophy by the beginning of the 20th century.

==History==
In the antebellum period, liberalism was very successful and led by the party of Károlyi, but after the communist revolution of 1919, and during the conservative regency, liberalism became limited to small city-based parties. After the 1988 end of communist rule, liberalism reconstituted itself in the Alliance of Free Democrats (&quot;Szabad Demokraták Szövetsége&quot;, member LI, ELDR), a center market liberal party. Originally also the Young Democrats chose a liberal profile, but soon they developed into a national-conservative party.

<text>The Parizeau Affair (French: &quot;l&#x27;Affaire Parizeau&quot;) was a political controversy that occurred in Quebec during the 2003 Quebec general election campaign.

==Description==
On March 31, 2003, an article was published in the Trois-Rivières newspaper &quot;Le Nouvelliste&quot; claiming that the former Parti Québécois (PQ) leader, Jacques Parizeau, had reiterated his controversial statement that the 1995 referendum failed due to &quot;&quot;money and the ethnic vote&quot;.&quot;

The same evening, the Quebec Leaders&#x27; Debate was held between Jean Charest, leader of the Quebec Liberal Party, and Bernard Landry, leader of the Parti Québécois. During the debate, Charest surprised Landry on live television by presenting the article and questioning whether the PQ leader shared his predecessor&#x27;s views. This resulted in a controversy that continued to receive attention in the days and weeks following the debate. 

In response, the PQ attempted to denounce Charest&#x27;s actions as an attack on Parizeau&#x27;s reputation and dignity, denying that he had repeated his comments. Meanwhile, Landry addressed the issue at several press conferences, stating that he did not agree with Parizeau&#x27;s unfortunate comments in 1995. However, these efforts did not entirely protect the party from backlash, and the debacle was speculated to have hurt Landry&#x27;s campaign.

On April 2, 2003, in an effort to distance his scandal from the party, Parizeau announced that he would no longer be campaigning for the Parti Québécois.

The Parizeau Affair is thoroughly covered in the documentary À Hauteur d&#x27;homme.

<text>Bowman Park is a public park in South Australia located on the Crystal Brook about 5 km northeast of the township of Crystal Brook and 200 km north of the capital city of Adelaide. The park has an area of about 40ha and is in the Mid North region of the state of South Australia, and named for the Bowman Brothers who settled in the area around 1850.

Bowman Park is open to the public from sunrise to sunset. Toilets and electric barbecues are available, dogs are allowed on leashes. It has an excellent nature playground, which blends into the river red gums and natural environment around the park.

The brook (or more typically Australian, &#x27;creek&#x27;) is fed by a permanent spring on the northern side of Bowman Park. In most other places the Crystal Brook is normally dry.

The long distance Heysen Trail passes through Bowman Park and there is a lodge for walkers&#x27; accommodation within the park. Kangaroos can often be seen in and near the park, especially mornings and evenings. There is some evidence of echidna activity.

There are a number of weed species in the park: Pepper trees (&quot;Schinus molle&quot;), 
olive trees, artichoke and Scotch thistles, box thorn, horehound, fennel, and others. In 2005 a program to greatly reduce the number of pepper trees was under way. A problem is that the Port Pirie Regional Council do not have any policy specifying which species in the park should be considered weeds. Other species that some people would consider inappropriate in this environment are willows and (non native) pines.

<doc id="930206" wikidata="Q454700" url="?curid=930206" title="Sir Richard Griffith, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard John Griffith Bt. FRS FRSE FGS LLD (20 September 1784 – 22 September 1878), was an Irish geologist, mining engineer and chairman of the Board of Works of Ireland, who completed the first complete geological map of Ireland and was the author of the valuation of Ireland; subsequently known as Griffith&#x27;s Valuation.

==Biography==

Griffith was born in Hume Street, Dublin, Ireland on 20 September 1784, the son of Richard Griffith, MP of Millicent House, and Charity Yorke Bramston, daughter of John Bramston of Oundle. His paternal grandmother was the acclaimed actress, essayist and novelist, Elizabeth Griffith.

He went to school in Portarlington and later, while attending school in Rathangan, his school was attacked by the rebels during the rebellion of 1798. He also studied in Edinburgh.

In 1799 he obtained a commission in the Royal Irish Artillery, but a year later, when the corps was incorporated with that of Great Britain, he retired, and devoted his attention to civil engineering and mining. He studied chemistry, mineralogy and mining for two years in London under William Nicholson, and afterwards examined the mining districts in various parts of England, Wales and Scotland.

While in Cornwall he discovered ores of nickel and cobalt in material that had been rejected as worthless. He completed his studies under Robert Jameson and others at Edinburgh, was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1807, a member of the newly established Geological Society of London in 1808, and in the same year, he returned to Ireland.

In 1809, he was appointed by the commissioners to inquire into the nature and extent of the bogs in Ireland, and the means of improving them. In 1812 he was elected Professor of Geology and Mining Engineer to the Royal Dublin Society. Shortly afterwards he expressed his intention of preparing a geological map of Ireland. During subsequent years he made many surveys and issued many reports on mineral districts in Ireland, and these formed the foundation of his first geological map of the country (1815). He also succeeded Dr. Richard Kirwan as government inspector of mines in Ireland. In 1822 Griffith became engineer of public works in counties Cork, Kerry and Limerick, and was occupied until 1830 in repairing old roads and in laying out many miles of new roads in some of the most inaccessible parts of the country.

Meanwhile, in 1825, he was appointed by the government to carry out a boundary survey of Ireland. He was to mark the boundaries of every county, barony, civil parish and townland in preparation for the first Ordnance Survey. He was also called upon to assist in the preparation of a parliamentary Bill to provide for the general valuation of Ireland. This Act was passed in 1826, and he was appointed Commissioner of Valuation in 1827, but did not start work until 1830 when the new 6&quot; maps became available from the Ordnance Survey and which he was required to use as provided for by statute. He continued to work on this until 1868. On Griffith&#x27;s valuation the various local and public assessments were made.

His extensive investigations furnished him with ample material for improving his geological map, and the second edition was published in 1835. The third edition on a larger scale (1 in. to 4 m.) was issued under the Board of Ordnance in 1839, and it was further revised in 1855. For this work and his other services to science, he was awarded the Wollaston medal by the Geological Society in 1854. In 1850 he was made chairman of the Irish Board of Works, and in 1858 he was created a baronet.

After research in the 20th century, it is now known that to a large extent the improvements of detail in the maps for which Griffith was praised and the geological research for Griffith&#x27;s papers were due to Patrick Ganly, whose pioneering work went entirely uncredited by Griffith.

He died at his residence, 2 Fitzwilliam Place in Dublin, on 22 September 1878 in his 95th year. At the time of his death, he was the oldest surviving fellow of the Geological Society of London and was the last survivor of the long-since disbanded Royal Irish Regiment of Artillery. He was buried alongside his wife, Maria Jane (née Waldie m. 21 Sep 1812) in Mount Jerome Cemetery, Harold&#x27;s Cross, Dublin; on his grave is the epitaph: &quot;Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, Serving the Lord&quot;.

==Family==

In 1812 he married Maria Jane Waldie of Hendersyde Park in Kelso. They had one son, Sir George Richard Waldie-Griffith, 2nd Baronet.

<text>Ontario March of Dimes (in French La Marche des Dix Sous de l&#x27;Ontario; officially Rehabilitation Foundation for the Disabled) is a charitable organization which provides programs and services to people of all ages with physical disabilities in Ontario, Canada. Its headquarters is in Toronto. It is not affiliated with the American organization called March of Dimes.

Ontario March of Dimes (OMOD) began in 1951 as the Canadian Foundation of Poliomyelitis, which funded research and provided medical and rehabilitation services to people with polio. As new vaccines reduced the threat from this disease, the organization changed its mandate to focus on services for people with physical disabilities, particularly physical and vocational training and rehabilitation.

The organization officially changed its name to Ontario March of Dimes in 1973, and gradually expanded to include other service areas such as recreational activities, advocacy and supportive housing.

It reconnected to its origins in 1985 by creating a chapter-based support and information network for people experiencing post-polio syndrome, or the late effects of polio. The program expanded to the national level in 2002 with Polio Canada.

For many years other organizations in Canada also operated under the name March of Dimes as members of the Easter Seals March of Dimes National Council.

In 2005, however, Ontario March of Dimes acquired the exclusive right to use &#x27;March of Dimes&#x27; in Canada, and now operates March of Dimes Canada as a national subsidiary of Ontario March of Dimes. It no longer has any affiliation with Easter Seals Canada.

In 1993, OMOD coordinated the first conference on Conductive Education in Canada, and in 2000 established the first full-time program, serving both adults and children. March of Dimes Canada is currently planning to expand the program throughout the country.

To commemorate the International Year of the Volunteer, in 2001 the Royal Canadian Mint issued a dime in honour of the 50th anniversary of Ontario March of Dimes.

During the 2006 Canadian federal election, 23-year-old Ontario March of Dimes intern Warren Rupnarain, a person with cerebral palsy who uses a wheelchair, visited the campaign offices of the three major political parties in all 22 Toronto ridings to raise awareness of disability issues. Called &quot;Warren&#x27;s World&quot;, this initiative was recorded and &quot;blogged&quot; through its official website.

In 2015, a long-time March of Dimes employee, Karima Manji, was charged by Toronto police with allegedly defrauding the charity of $800,000 through the use of false bank accounts and forged invoices. Manji, who worked as a property manager for the organization&#x27;s non-profit residences since 2005, was accused of siphoning funds from the charity and funneling them into a false March of Dimes bank account. She was charged with fraud, theft, possession of property obtained by a crime, and presenting a forged document. Manji paid back more than $500,000 and was placed under two years&#x27; house arrest.

<text>Sir Frederick McCoy (1817 – 13 May 1899), was an Irish palaeontologist, zoologist, and museum administrator, active in Australia. He is noted for founding the Botanic Garden of the University of Melbourne in 1856.

==Early life==
McCoy was the son of Simon McCoy and was born in Dublin; some sources have his year of birth as 1823, however 1817 is the most likely. He was educated in Dublin and at Cambridge for the medical profession.

==Palaeontology career==

McCoy&#x27;s interests, however, became early centred in natural history and, especially, palaeontology. At the age of eighteen he published a &quot;Catalogue of Organic Remains compiled from specimens exhibited in the Rotunda at Dublin&quot; (1841). He assisted Sir Richard Griffith by studying the fossils of the carboniferous and silurian rocks of Ireland, resulting in two publication: &quot;A Synopsis of the Character of Carboniferous Limestone Fossils of Ireland&quot; (1844) and &quot;Synopsis of the Silurian Fossils of Ireland&quot; (1846).

In 1846 Adam Sedgwick secured his services, and for at least four years he devoted himself to the determination and arrangement of the fossils in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge. Sedgwick wrote of him as &quot;an excellent naturalist, an incomparable and most philosophical palaeontologist, and one of the steadiest and quickest workmen that ever undertook the arrangement of a museum&quot; (&quot;Life and Letters of Sedgwick&quot;, ii. 194). Together they prepared the important and now classic work entitled &quot;A Synopsis of the Classification of the British Palaeozoic Rocks, with a Systematic Description of the British Palaeozoic Fossils in the Geological Museum of the University of Cambridge&quot;. Meanwhile, McCoy in 1850 had been appointed professor of geology in Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast.

McCoy&#x27;s examination of fossil material preserving the teeth of &quot;Thylacoleo&quot;, an extinct carnivore, saw him enter the debate on the apparent absence of large predators in Australia&#x27;s mammalian fauna; McCoy sided with Richard Owen&#x27;s interpretation of his new species as representing a &quot;marsupial lion&quot;.

==Career in Australia==

In 1854, McCoy accepted the newly founded professorship of natural science in the University of Melbourne, where he lectured for upwards of thirty years. When McCoy began his work at the university there were few students, and for many years he took classes in chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, comparative anatomy, geology and palaeontology. In endeavouring to cover so much ground it was impossible for him to keep his reading up to date in all these sciences, and he remained most distinguished as a palaeontologist.

In 1857, he took over the National Museum of Natural History and Geology in Melbourne. He convinced the Melbourne University and state Government to house the museum at the university. After a new building for it was constructed, it was re-opened as the National Museum of Victoria in 1864. McCoy built up significant natural history and geological collections for the museum, as well as spending a substantial sum setting up a reference library to assist the scientific research undertaken by the museum&#x27;s first curators. McCoy was in correspondence with several prominent scientists and collectors of the time, including John Gould, from whom he purchased specimens, including mammals, insects, shells, and bird skins, as well as copies of Gould&#x27;s scientific publications for the museum.

McCoy, on becoming associated with the Geological Survey of Victoria as palaeontologist, composed the volumes concerning his field as &quot;Prodromus of the Palaeontology of Victoria&quot; (1874–82). He also issued the &quot;Prodromus of the Zoology of Victoria&quot; (1885–90). He was president of the Royal Society of Victoria in 1864 and vice-president in 1861 and 1870.

Frederick McCoy described three species of Australia&#x27;s venomous snakes during 1878–1879, including &quot;Oxyuranus microlepidotus&quot;, commonly known as the inland taipan or fierce snake, which is considered to be the world&#x27;s most venomous snake.

McCoy helped to found a society intended to introduce exotic animals to Australia by &quot;acclimatisation&quot;, responsible for the release of fish, mammals and flocks of birds with an often disastrous ecological impact; the Acclimatisation Society would later be renamed the Victorian Zoological Society. McCoy sought to replace what he perceived as the silence or unpleasant noises of the Australian bush with sounds of English songbirds, and celebrated the successful introduction of the european rabbit and starling which were already recognised as pests by the colonial farmers.

==Creationism==
McCoy was a Christian creationist who rejected evolution and natural selection. He argued that the paleontological record offered evidence of the sudden appearance and disappearance of species. The abrupt appearance of species was the result of supernatural plan. He thus supported a form of progressive creationism.

W. R. Gerdtz, in a 2001 paper in &quot;The Victorian Naturalist&quot;, noted that &quot;McCoy&#x27;s belief in the Creator&#x27;s perfect and universal plan of successive creation appeared to be contradicted by the fossil evidence McCoy himself described.&quot;

==Late life==
McCoy contributed many papers to local societies, and continued his active scientific work for fifty-eight years – his last contribution, &quot;Note on a new Australian Pterygotus,&quot; was printed in the &quot;Geological Magazine&quot; for May 1899.

==Recognition==
He was awarded the Murchison Medal of the Geological Society of London in 1879, was elected F.R.S. in 1880, and was one of the first to receive the Hon. D.Sc. from the University of Cambridge.

In 1886, he was made CMG, and in 1891 KCMG. He died in Melbourne on 16 May 1899.

A species of Australian lizard, &quot;Anepischetosia maccoyi&quot;, is named in his honour.

The McCoy Society for Field Investigation and Research was formed in 1935 at the University of Melbourne, and emulated in the Ralph Tate Society of the University of Adelaide.

McCoy&#x27;s life and career was commemorated by two special issues of The Victorian Naturalist published in 2001.

<text>The Civic Freedom Party () was one of the two inter-war liberal parties in Hungary.

==History==
The party was founded in 1921 by Károly Rassay as the Independent Party of Smallholders, Workers and Citizens (, FKFPP) as an attempt to mobilize voters for liberalism outside the cities. In the 1922 elections it ran alone, winning five seats, and also in alliance with the National Democratic Party, with the joint list winning seven seats.

For the 1926 elections it ran in alliance with the National Democratic Party under the name &quot;United Left&quot;, winning nine seats.

Rassay reconstituted the party in 1930 as the National Liberal Party (), as an attempt to build an alternative to the conservative government. In the 1931 elections it ran as the &quot;Unified Liberal Democratic Party, winning four seats. The 1935 elections saw it run in alliance with the National Democratic Party again, this time under the name &quot;Liberal and Democratic Opposition&quot;, with the alliance winning seven seats.

In the 1939 elections the party, now renamed the Civic Freedom Party, ran alone, winning five seats. In 1944 it was dissolved by the Communist Party. It was reformed as the Civic Democratic Party in 1945.

<doc id="930223" wikidata="Q580509" url="?curid=930223" title="Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance">
<text>The Grammy Award for Best Urban/Alternative Performance was an honor presented at the Grammy Awards, a ceremony that was established in 1958 and originally called the Gramophone Awards, to recording artists for quality urban/alternative performances. Awards in several categories are distributed annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to &quot;honor artistic achievement, technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry, without regard to album sales or chart position.&quot;

The award was first awarded to India.Arie at the 45th Grammy Awards (2003) for her song &quot;Little Things&quot;. According to the category description guide for the 52nd Grammy Awards, the award was presented to artists that had made &quot;newly recorded urban/alternative performances with vocals&quot;. The award was intended to recognize artists &quot;who have been influenced by a cross-section of urban music&quot; and who create music that is out of the &quot;mainstream trends&quot;.

Two-time recipients include India.Arie, Cee Lo Green (once as part of the duo Gnarls Barkley), and Jill Scott. Erykah Badu, Big Boi (a member of OutKast) and will.i.am (a member of The Black Eyed Peas) share the record for the most nominations, with three each. Sérgio Mendes is the only performer to be nominated twice in one year. The category was dominated by Americans, yet individuals from Jamaica and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire also won the award. The award was discontinued from 2012 in a major overhaul of the Grammys where the category was shifted to the Best R&amp;B Performance category.

<doc id="930224" wikidata="Q5440185" url="?curid=930224" title="Federal Depository Library Program">
<text>The Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) is a government program created to make U.S. federal government publications available to the public at no cost. there are 1,114 depository libraries in the United States and its territories. A &quot;government publication&quot; is defined in the U.S. Code as &quot;informational matter which is published as an individual document at Government expense, or as required by law&quot; (44 U.S.C. 1901).

==History==
The groundwork for the FDLP was established by an 1813 Congressional Joint Resolution ordering that certain publications be distributed to libraries outside of the federal government.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Government Printing Office. Superintendent of Documents. Designation handbook for federal depository libraries [electronic resource]. Washington: Government Printing Office, 2008. (GP 3.29:D 44/3/2008).&quot;&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office. Superintendent of Documents. Designation handbook for federal depository libraries (electronic resource). Washington: Government Printing Office, 2008. (GP 3.29:D 44/3/2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the Librarian of Congress was responsible for running this program, but the responsibility shifted to the Secretary of the Interior in the 1850s.

The Printing Act of 1895 revised public printing laws and established the roles of the FDLP and the Government Printing Office (GPO) in distributing government information. This act also assigned leadership of the program to the Superintendent of Public Documents, who would be under the control of the GPO and added executive documents to the distribution list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library of Congress. Federal Library and Information Center Committee. Handbook of federal librarianship [electronic resource]. Washington: Government Printing Office, 2004. (LC 1.32/6-2:). http://purl.access.gpo.gov/GPO/LPS42920 &quot;&gt;Library of Congress. Federal Library and Information Center Committee. Handbook of federal librarianship (electronic resource). Washington: Government Printing Office, 2004. (LC 1.32/6-2:).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Depository Library Act of 1962 (DLA) created the present-day FDLP as codified in Title 44, Chapter 19 of the U.S. Code. The DLA allowed two depository libraries in each Congressional district, eliminated postage charges to depository libraries receiving material, provided for the distribution of non-GPO documents, permitted independent federal agencies to be eligible for depository designation, and created regional depository libraries.

The Government Printing Office Electronic Information Access Enhancement Act of 1993 (P.L. 103-40), codified in Title 44, Chapter 41 of the U.S. Code, requires the Superintendent of Documents to maintain an electronic directory of federal electronic information, provide online access to the &quot;Congressional Record&quot;, &quot;Federal Register&quot; and other select publications, and operate an electronic storage facility. The electronic service now includes over 2,200 databases and is available via http://www.govinfo.gov.

On January 4, 2020, the FDLP website was hacked and defaced with pro-Iranian/anti-US messaging in response to the American airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the commander of Iran&#x27;s Quds Force. The FDLP site was taken offline, then restored the next day following a security analysis.

==Structure==

The Government Publishing Office (GPO) is responsible for printing and distributing government documents and overseeing the FDLP. There are several important individuals in charge of maintaining the link between GPO and the FDLP:
* The Director of the U.S. Government Publishing Office, formerly the Public Printer, is responsible for overseeing the FDLP and for designating certain depository libraries. His or her nomination must be approved by the Joint Committee on Printing.
* The Superintendent of Documents is responsible for monitoring policy creation and the operations of the FDLP. The Superintendent may designate depository libraries, and supervise the GPO sales program. The Superintendent may also ask depository libraries to destroy a certain publication or return it to the GPO.
* The Director of Library Services and Content Management (LSCM) is responsible for staffing the FDLP and for providing interested parties with up-to-date communications.
* The Depository Library Council to the Public Printer (DLC) was created in 1972 and serves as an advisory committee to the Public Printer and the Superintendent of Documents. The DLC addresses such issues as improving public access, optimizing resources, indexing and classification, format, storage and administration. The Council consists of fifteen members who are appointed by the Public Printer, and they serve three year terms, with five members retiring and five new members stepping in each year. The Council meets at least twice per year.

=== Types of depository libraries ===
There are two types of depository libraries:

# Regional depository library. Each state may have a maximum of two regional libraries, though most states have one. It is the responsibility of regional libraries to retain a copy of all government publications received and provide services such as interlibrary loan and reference to selective depository libraries it serves. Regional libraries must also assist selective libraries in disposing of unwanted items. The majority of regional depository libraries are academic institutions. As of March 2018, there are 46 regional depository libraries, with six states being served by regional libraries in other states. Wyoming is not served by a regional library.
# Selective depository library. There may only be two selective depositories per Congressional district; there may be more only in the event that a Congressional district has been reconfigured after a decennial census. Selective depositories choose to receive certain classes of documents from the government, which are chosen from the List of Classes. Selective libraries choose materials which will best serve their clientele.

=== Attaining FDLP status ===
There are two ways in which a library may qualify for FDLP status:

# Each member of Congress may delegate two qualified libraries if his or her district is not already being adequately served by a depository library. The governor of American Samoa and the governor of Guam may each designate one library if vacancies exist. The governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands may designate two libraries if vacancies exist (one each for Saint Thomas and Saint Croix). The mayor of the District of Columbia may also designate two libraries if vacancies exist.
# A library may be given FDLP status via &quot;by-law designations&quot; (Title 44 of the U.S. Code). Any library that meets the following criteria automatically qualifies for FDLP status:
## Land-grant colleges and universities ()
## Libraries of federal agencies, i.e. executive departments, service academies, independent agencies ()
## Highest appellate court of a state ()
## Accredited law schools ()

=== Responsibilities and maintaining depository status ===
Libraries with depository status are required to provide the documents received at no cost to their patrons. Though they receive the publications free of charge, depository libraries are responsible for the costs of processing the items and making them available. All depository libraries must make their collections of these documents available to the general public, and the services provided for government documents must be on par with the services offered to the primary users of a library. Circulation policies for government documents, however, are established by each library itself. Libraries may house the materials however they like; for example, they may separate the government documents from the rest of their collection or they may integrate them. A library cannot filter Internet search results at public access stations as access to health or biological science articles may not be infringed upon.

Depository libraries must maintain collections of at least 10,000 books, not including the collection of government documents. A depository library may voluntarily resign from its position as a depository library, or it may be stripped of its depository status by the Superintendent of Documents if it does not carry out its responsibilities as enumerated in the U.S. Code. In either case, the library must properly dispose of the government documents it acquired while part of the program as these publications are the property of the U.S. Government. The documents would generally be returned to the state regional library and then redistributed to selected libraries within the state.

==FDLP collections==
Libraries are required to maintain a series of titles known as the FDLP Basic Collection. Beyond this, libraries order the materials that best suit the needs of their patrons; there is no selection percentage criterion that must be met. The FDLP offers the opportunity to order several kinds of material for libraries&#x27; collections, including maps, Braille, large print documents, foreign language items, and audio.

===Core Collection===
The Core Collection was established in 1977. Every depository library is required to have certain publications available for use. These include, among others:
* Budget of the United States Government
* Catalog of U.S. Government Publications
* Code of Federal Regulations
* Congressional Directory
* &quot;Congressional Record&quot; (daily)
* &quot;Federal Register&quot; (daily)
* &quot;Statistical Abstract of the United States&quot;
* United States Code

===Selecting items===
Libraries select the documents they wish to receive from the &quot;List of Classes of United States Government Publications Available for Selection by Depository Libraries and the Union List of Item Selections&quot;. This is a document listing all of the classes of items available for selection through the program and their associated item numbers. Each item with an item number is available through the FDLP program. Because of the large number of documents published by the government each year, the documents are arranged into categories of related classes from which to choose. By selecting a class, the library receives all of the documents within that class. Selections made during the year take effect on October 1. The &quot;Union List of Item Selections&quot; updates the titles in the List of Classes on a semiannual basis.

===Deselecting items===
Unlike adding items, selections may be removed at any time; the library stops receiving the documents within 72 hours.

=== Retention of documents ===
Selective depository libraries must keep government documents in their collections for five years minimum, after which time the items may be removed from the collection with the approval of a regional library. Items marked for disposal must be offered first to the regional, then to other depositories (). All depository libraries, including regional libraries, may dispose of items that have been superseded or issued later in bound form (). If an item has been deselected, the library must still retain the publications it possesses from that item number for five years before they may be discarded. Libraries may not financially benefit from the disposal of depository publications.

==Electronic documents==
After 1996, government publications increasingly shifted to online formats; in addition, most Federal publications now originate online. Regional libraries still continue to collect information in a wide variety of formats, but many government documents are now published exclusively online. Electronic documents positively impact issues such as storage, length of retention, and access, which can be enhanced with library networking.

Libraries may substitute electronic documents for tangible documents as the only copy of the item in the collection, as long as the electronic document is complete, official, and permanently accessible. Access to electronic documents is provided through Persistent Uniform Resources Locators (PURL) and is facilitated by GovInfo and the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP).

Recently, federal agencies have been bypassing the GPO in lieu of publishing documents directly online. These documents, known as &quot;fugitive documents&quot;, are not published through GPO, and hence are not part of the FDLP program.

<doc id="930225" wikidata="Q390194" url="?curid=930225" title="Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)">
<text>Against the Grain is the fifth album (and seventh release overall) by American punk rock band Bad Religion, released on November 23, 1990. It was the last album recorded with drummer Pete Finestone, who left in 1991 to concentrate with his new project The Fishermen. Following his departure, the band&#x27;s music would take a different direction on their next album, 1992&#x27;s &quot;Generator&quot;. &quot;Against the Grain&quot; was also the first Bad Religion album not to feature a lineup change from the previous two albums.

Despite no promotion by radio and television, &quot;Against the Grain&quot; managed to sell over 100,000 copies. A tiny part of the album&#x27;s title track is played in a segment of the same name on &quot;The Dan Patrick Show&quot;.

==Background and recording==
Bad Religion released their fourth studio album &quot;No Control&quot; in 1989, which went on to sell 60,000 copies.

Writing and demoing for &quot;Against the Grain&quot; began in 1989, and Bad Religion entered Westbeach Recorders in May 1990 to record the album. &quot;Against the Grain&quot; is one of the few Bad Religion albums to feature songs not written by Greg Graffin or Brett Gurewitz. One song is written by bass player Jay Bentley alone, whereas another is co-written by Bentley and Greg Hetson. According to Bentley, with the band&#x27;s building popularity, they received an offer from a member of the E Street Band. Said member wanted the band to re-record &quot;Against the Grain&quot; with him as the producer, and also proposed re-writing the songs.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Against the Grain&quot; was released shortly after the conclusion of the &quot;No Control&quot; tour which had lasted until the middle of 1990. The album was highly anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band&#x27;s success with their 1988 post-reunion album &quot;Suffer&quot; and its 1989 follow-up &quot;No Control&quot;. While &quot;Against the Grain&quot; still failed to break Bad Religion into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing. By 1992, the album had sold approximately 90,000 copies.

The album has received generally favorable reviews in the years since its initial release. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus said that &quot;Against the Grain&quot; &quot;found the band&#x27;s edge honed sharper than it had been in years&quot;, and claimed that &quot;Bad Religion had always warned against the excesses of the future and the assimilation of individuality. But the gospel cut deeper with &quot;Against the Grain&quot;. Songs began in an instant, with the single crack of a snare drum signaling the beginning of another screed.&quot; Author Dave Thompson, in his book &quot;Alternative Rock&quot; (2000), wrote: &quot;This album goes anywhere but [against the grain]. The now-trademarked multi-part harmonies emerge full born, and though the songs remain frenetic, the sound is brighter, bigger, verging on anthemic.&quot;

The album&#x27;s 13th track, &quot;21st Century (Digital Boy)&quot;, was re-recorded and appeared as a single on their eighth full-length studio album &quot;Stranger Than Fiction&quot;, released in 1994, four years after the release of &quot;Against the Grain.&quot;

<text>Jeu de paume was an event contested at the 1908 Summer Olympics, the only time the Summer Olympic Games featured the sport as a medal event.

In the Official Report of the 1908 Olympic Games, the sport is referred to as &quot;Tennis (jeu de paume)&quot;, while tennis is referred to as &quot;lawn tennis&quot;. The competition venue was the Queen&#x27;s Club in West Kensington, London.

An outdoor version called longue paume was played at the 1900 Summer Olympics, though its medal status is disputed. Jeu de paume is sometimes referred to as being an exhibition sport at the 1924 Summer Olympics, though this is unclear, as the French Federation of Longue Paume held its national longue paume championships during the Olympics.

==Participating nations==
Each nation could enter up to 12 players. 11 players from 2 nations competed.

<text>Veronica Campbell Brown (born 15 May 1982) is a retired Jamaican track and field sprinter, who specialized in the 100 and 200 meters. An eight-time Olympic medalist, she is the second of three women in history to win two consecutive Olympic 200 m events, after Bärbel Wöckel of Germany at the 1976 and 1980 Olympics and before fellow countrywoman Elaine Thompson-Herah at the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. Campbell-Brown is one of only eleven athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Usain Bolt, Armand Duplantis, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Kirani James, Faith Kipyegon, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, and David Storl) to win World Championship titles at the youth, junior, and senior levels of an athletic event.

She holds personal bests of 10.76 seconds for the 100 m and 21.74 seconds for the 200 m. She was the 100 m gold medallist at the 2007 World Championships in Athletics and the 200 m gold medallist at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics. She has also won seven silver medals and one bronze medal in her career at the World Championships in Athletics. Over 60 metres, she is a two-time champion at the IAAF World Indoor Championships.

==Early life==
Campbell was born to Cecil Campbell and Pamela Bailey in Clarks Town, Trelawny, Jamaica on 15 May 1982. She has five brothers and four sisters and attended Troy Primary and Vere Technical High School in Clarendon before pursuing higher education in the United States at the University of Arkansas.

==Junior career==
In 1999, she won two gold medals, the 100 m and 4 x 100 m relay at the inaugural IAAF World Youth Championships. The following year, she became the first female to win the sprint double at the IAAF World Junior Championships. She took the 100 m in 11.12 s (which was a championship record at the time) and the 200 m in 22.87 s. At the 2000 Olympic Games, she ran the second leg on the silver medal winning 4 x 100 m relay team. In 2001, she was awarded the Austin Sealy Trophy for the
most outstanding athlete of the 2001 CARIFTA Games. That year, she won 3 gold medals (100 m, 200 m, and 4 × 100 m relay) in the junior (U-20) category.

==College career==
Campbell attended Barton County Community College in Great Bend, Kansas, where she set several records and won many titles, including four national junior college titles in the 60, 100 and 200 metres both indoors and outdoors. She holds the current record for Barton County CC in the outdoor 100 m and 200 m. Campbell also excelled academically, earning an associate degree from Barton County in 2002 with a 3.8 grade average. She later attended the University of Arkansas, where she stood out as a sprint star in a programme dominated by long-distance runners.

==Professional career==
At 18 years old, Campbell-Brown won the first Olympic medal of her illustrious career. She competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics in the 4 x 100 m relay along with Tayna Lawrence, Beverly McDonald, Merlene Frazer and sprint veteran and Olympic legend, Merlene Ottey where the team finished second in the finals in a time of 42.13 seconds behind Caribbean neighbors, Bahamas. Campbell Brown had shown herself to be a promising athlete as a junior, having won at the junior level and at Jamaica&#x27;s yearly Boys and Girls Championship for her high school, Vere Technical High. The Championship has been credited as the engineer behind Jamaica&#x27;s success on the Track and Field World stage.

At the age of 22, Campbell-Brown represented Jamaica at the 2004 Athens Olympics. She competed in both the 100 m and 200 m. In the finals of the 100 m, she placed third. Campbell Brown later competed in the 200 m finals, a race American Allyson Felix was favored to win. VCB went on to decimate the field in the 200 m finals. She ran a blistering curve and held her form down the final stretch to become the first Jamaican and Caribbean woman in the history of the Olympic games to win a sprint Olympic title. A visibly emotional Campbell Brown was brought to tears at the medal ceremony as her national anthem was played in the stadium and flag hoisted.

Campbell-Brown then teamed up with Aleen Bailey, Tayna Lawrence, and Sherone Simpson in the finals of the 4 × 100 m. VCB ran a scintillating anchor leg as Jamaica went on to win the women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m. Jamaica created history as it was the first time Jamaica had won the 4 × 100 m relay at the Olympics.

In August 2005, Campbell won the silver medal in the 100 m at the 2005 World Championships in Athletics. She won another silver medal in the 4 x 100 m relay (together with Daniele Browning, Aleen Bailey and Sherone Simpson).

At the 2007 World Championships, Campbell won three medals, a gold in the 100 m, silver in the 200 m (second to Felix) and silver in the 4 x 100 m relay.

At the 2008 Jamaican Olympic trials, she finished fourth in the 100 m, thereby missing the qualifying requirement to automatically make the Jamaican Olympic roster for that event. She clocked 10.88 s in the final, which is the second-fastest time ever for a fourth-place finish. She, however, bounced back to take the 200 m final in what was then a personal best time of 21.94 s. Having failed to qualify for the 100 m, she only competed in the 200 m and the 4 x 100 m relay at the Olympic Games.

At the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics, Veronica Campbell-Brown carried the Jamaican flag during the Athletes&#x27; Parade. She successfully defended her Olympic 200 m title in a new personal best time of 21.74 s. She competed at the 4 x 100 m relay together with Shelly-Ann Fraser, Sheri-Ann Brooks and Aleen Bailey. In the first round heats, Jamaica placed first in front of Russia, Germany and China. The Jamaican teams&#x27; time of 42.24 s was the first time overall out of sixteen participating nations. With this result, Jamaica qualified for the final, replacing Brooks and Bailey with Sherone Simpson and Kerron Stewart. Jamaica did not finish the race due to a mistake in the baton exchange.

At the end of the 2008 season, Campbell-Brown was selected the top 200 m runner in the world and the fourth best in the 100 m (following three other Jamaicans) by &quot;Track and Field News&quot;. She also finished eighth overall in voting for the magazine&#x27;s Woman of the Year.

She qualified for her third World Championships by winning the 200 m national title. She beat runners-up Shelly Ann Fraser and Simone Facey with a time of 22.40 seconds in June 2009, although a toe injury had left her lacking full fitness.

At the 2009 World Championships Campbell-Brown was fourth in the 100 m final behind teammates Fraser and Stewart. She then won her second World 200 m silver behind American Allyson Felix. She closed the season at the Shanghai Golden Grand Prix, recording her fastest of the year (10.89) to take second behind Carmelita Jeter, who became the second fastest ever with 10.64 seconds. Although Jeter beat her, Campbell-Brown was the fourth fastest 100 m sprinter overall that season.

In 2010, she won her first World Indoor 60m Gold medal in a time of 7.00. She later ran the fastest time for the 200 m in 21.98 in New York. She also ran a 10.78 in Eugene, Oregon, beating Fraser-Pryce and Jeter.

In 2011 Veronica Campbell-Brown won the Jamaican athletic trials in both the 100 &amp; 200 m and was one of the favorites for both gold medals at the World Championships in Daegu. At the championships, she won the silver medal in the women&#x27;s 100 m in 10.98 behind Jeter, who won in 10.90. She later won her first 200 m world title in a timer of 22.22, beating Jeter and Felix, who were second and third, respectively. In 2015, Campbell made it to the Semi and Finals of the World Championships 100 and 200m, Finishing 3rd in the 200m, which Dafne Schippers won.

In 2012, she defended her 60m World Indoor Gold medal, which she won in a time of 7.01. Later in June, Veronica qualified for the 2012 Olympic Games in London, both at 100 m and 200 m. In the 100 m she came third behind Shelly Ann Fraser Pryce and Carmelita Jeter. In the 200 m she finished just outside the medals in 4th place, 0.24 of a second outside of bronze. In the 4 × 100 m relay final, she and the Jamaican team came second behind the U.S., which won in a new world record of 40.82 s.

In 2014, Campbell-Brown competed at the 2014 World Indoor Championships in Sopot, Poland, and over the 60 m race, ending up in 5th place with a time of 7.13 s. In 2015, she competed at the 2015 World Championships in Athletics in Beijing, China, and participated in sprint events of 100 m, 200 m, and 4 × 100 m relay—where she finished in fourth place with a time of 10.91 s, won the bronze medal with a time of 21.97 s and secured the gold with a time of 41.07 s respectively.

Campbell-Brown also for the 2016 Rio Olympics in the 200 m and 4 × 100 m relay. In the 200 m, she did not make it out of the heats and finished in 27th place with a time of 22.97 s but won the silver as part of the Jamaican team in the 4 × 100 m relay with a time of 41.36 s behind the US team, which finished with a time of 41.01 s, the second fastest time ever run for the event.

==Positive doping test==
On 14 June 2013, it was reported that Campbell-Brown had tested positive for diuretics while competing at the JAAA Supreme Ventures, a Jamaican meet. She was provisionally suspended from competition. Campbell-Brown denied that she had intentionally taken any banned substances.

On 2 October 2013, she was cleared by the Jamaica Athletics Administrative Association (JAAA) to resume competition. The panel said this is not one of the most serious offences, and it was appropriate that she should be given a public warning with no ban from competition. They deemed she did not use the prohibited substance for performance enhancement. The substance in question—Lasix, not necessarily a performance-enhancing drug, but rather a potential masking agent for other banned substances—was contained in a cream the athlete had used for a leg injury.

The International Association of Athletics Federations appealed this decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The court decided to clear Campbell-Brown of all doping charges as the JAAA doping procedures did not comply with required international standards.

==Personal life==
In 2007, Campbell married Omar Brown, a fellow Jamaican sprinter and University of Arkansas alumnus, changing her name to Campbell-Brown, a few years later she dropped the hyphen from her name, changing it to Campbell Brown. They currently live and train in Clermont, Florida. She was appointed as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador in late 2009 and stated that she would use the role to promote gender equity in sport.

==Achievements==
Campbell-Brown&#x27;s personal best of 10.76 s in the 100 m ranks her all-time top fifteen in the world (tied for 11th place) and sixth among Jamaican women. Her 200 m best (21.74 s) ranks her in the all-time top fifteen in the world. This time is the fifth best among Jamaican women. It is the tied sixth fastest time of the 21st century and was the fastest since Marion Jones&#x27;s 21.62 s in Johannesburg 1998. She earned a total of 46 medals (27 gold, 16 silver, 3 bronze).

<doc id="930238" wikidata="Q1141715" url="?curid=930238" title="Shootenanny!">
<text>Shootenanny! is the fifth studio album by American rock band Eels, released on June 3, 2003, and was to the band&#x27;s last release on record label DreamWorks. The album peaked at number 145 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the first album to chart since &quot;Beautiful Freak&quot; in 1996.

&quot;Saturday Morning&quot; was released on June 3, 2003 as a promotional single with the B-sides &quot;Her&quot;, &quot;Waltz of the Naked Clowns&quot;, and &quot;Sad Foot Sign&quot;.

== Background ==
While lead singer Mark Oliver &quot;E&quot; Everett was working on the double disc &quot;Blinking Lights and Other Revelations&quot; project, he had the idea to make a &quot;succinct, direct and no bullshit&quot; record, inspired by the writing style of blues singer-songwriter Muddy Waters.

Before the recording of the album, Everett and drummer Jonathan Norton were in conflict. Norton left Eels after a &quot;Last Call with Carson Daly&quot; performance during the &quot;Souljacker&quot; tour, later telling a journalist his decision was &quot;a business thing&quot;. However, he participated in the recording sessions for &quot;Shootenanny!&quot;, working as a freelancer rather than a member of the band, with tensions still intact. This would be the last album with new recordings from Norton, although earlier sessions featuring him would appear on the &quot;Blinking Lights&quot; album two years later.

Recording of the album took place for 10 days during late November 2002 with minimal production. The album was recorded onto two-inch tape and edited digitally using Pro Tools. &quot;Shootenanny!&quot; was recorded and mixed by Greg Collins, who recorded &quot;Climbing to the Moon&quot; on &quot;Electro-Shock Blues&quot;.

===Title===

The album&#x27;s name comes from a neologism, coined by Everett, for &quot;a social gathering at which participants engage in folk singing and sometimes dancing [a &quot;hootenanny&quot;], but mostly the shooting of guns.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Shootenanny!&quot; received a generally favorable response, though some critics were divided.

Greg Kot of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the album &quot;downright moving at its best&quot;. A negative review came from Chris Dahlen of Pitchfork, who wrote: &quot;Musically and lyrically, E is spent – out of ideas, out of innovation, unable to cough up anything but by-the-numbers pop in the fourteen originals he wrote for this disc.&quot; Dom Passantino of Stylus opined that the album &quot;suffers from a lack of identity&quot;.

<doc id="930239" wikidata="Q747128" url="?curid=930239" title="William P. Hobby">
<text>William Pettus Hobby (March 26, 1878 – June 7, 1964) was an American politician, journalist, and publisher. He was the publisher/owner of the &quot;Beaumont Enterprise&quot; when he entered politics and the Democratic Party. Elected in 1914 as Lieutenant Governor of Texas, in 1917 he succeeded to become 27th Governor of the U.S. state of Texas, after James Edward &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson was impeached and forced to resign. In 1918, Hobby won the office in his own right, serving a full term.

In 1924, Hobby lost the Democratic primary to Miriam A. Ferguson, wife of &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson and she was elected to the governorship. Hobby returned to publishing, and in 1924 was chosen as president of the &quot;Houston Post.&quot; He later served as chairman of the board of the Houston Post Company, which had also acquired radio and TV stations.

==Early life==
Born in 1878 in Moscow, Texas, Hobby attended local public schools.

He started working at the age of 17 as a circulation clerk for the &quot;Houston Post&quot; in 1895. Several years later, he was promoted to business writer in August 1901. In 1907, he left the &quot;Post&quot; to become manager and part owner of the &quot;Beaumont Enterprise&quot;. He acquired the entire paper shortly thereafter.

==Political career==
Hobby decided to enter politics and joined the Democratic Party. In 1914, he ran for and was elected Lieutenant Governor of Texas. After Governor James Edward Ferguson, known as &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson, was impeached and forced to resign from office in a corruption case in 1917, Hobby succeeded him at 39 and was then the youngest governor in state history. Ferguson was prohibited from serving in state electoral office again.
Hobby soundly defeated Ferguson in the 1918 Democratic primary and won the general election, governorship in his own right, and served a full term to 1921. While serving as governor, various measures were carried out related to (amongst others) drought relief, free school textbooks, state aid for highways and schools,
 and working conditions,
 including a measure that provided for the fixing of minimum wage rates. 

During his years of service, the southern border of Texas was a place of frequent conflict, as revolutionaries from the Mexican Revolution (1910–1920) entered the United States to attack farms, irrigation systems, and railroads. The Texas Rangers, militias, and US troops patrolled the border, and atrocities were committed by both sides.

In early 1919, a Joint Committee of the Texas Senate and House conducted hearings to investigate actions by the Texas Rangers along the border. They conducted hearings for two weeks and had 83 witnesses. Among the incidents recounted was the Porvenir Massacre of January 1918 in West Texas in which militia and Texas Rangers summarily killed 15 Mexican-American men and boys near their farming village. The legislature passed a bill to regulate the Rangers and to professionalize the service, and their numbers were reduced. Historians estimate that the Rangers killed up to 5,000 people, mostly ethnic Mexicans, from 1914 to 1919.
==Publisher==
After leaving the governorship, Hobby returned to the &quot;Beaumont Enterprise.&quot; In 1924, he was invited to become the president of the &quot;Houston Post&quot;. In August 1955, Hobby became chairman of the board of the Houston Post Company. By then, the company also owned the radio station, KPRC, and the television station, KPRC-TV. His wife, Oveta Culp Hobby (see below), served as president and editor.

==Personal and civic life==
In 1931, Hobby married Oveta Culp. She later was appointed as the first Secretary of the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare (its name was changed after a later reorganization).

Hobby served as a member on the Board of Directors of Texas Technological College.

==Family==
His son William P. Hobby Jr. also served as lieutenant governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991. His daughter, Jessica, was married to Henry E. Catto Jr., who became the Ambassador of the United States to the Court of St James&#x27;s. His grandson, Paul Hobby, narrowly lost the election for comptroller of Texas in the 1998 general election. Republican Carole Keeton Strayhorn won that election.

==Legacy==

Several public facilities were named for him:

* William P. Hobby Airport in Houston, Texas
* Hobby Elementary School in Houston, Texas
* Hobby Middle School in San Antonio, Texas
* Hobby Center For The Performing Arts in Houston, TX

<text>Clinton Joseph Davisson (October 22, 1881 – February 1, 1958) was an American physicist who won the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physics for his discovery of electron diffraction in the famous Davisson–Germer experiment. Davisson shared the Nobel Prize with George Paget Thomson, who independently discovered electron diffraction at about the same time as Davisson.

== Early life and education ==
Davisson was born in Bloomington, Illinois on October 22, 1881. He graduated from Bloomington High School in 1902, and entered the University of Chicago on scholarship. Upon the recommendation of Robert A. Millikan, in 1905 Davisson was hired by Princeton University as Instructor of Physics. He completed the requirements for his B.S. degree from Chicago in 1908, mainly by working in the summers. While teaching at Princeton, he did doctoral thesis research with Owen Richardson. He received his Ph.D. in physics from Princeton in 1911; in the same year he married Richardson&#x27;s sister, Charlotte.

== Scientific career ==
After earning his Ph.D., Davisson was appointed as an assistant professor at the Carnegie Institute of Technology. In 1917, he took a leave from the Carnegie Institute to do war-related research with the engineering department of the Western Electric Company (later Bell Telephone Laboratories). At the end of the war, Davisson accepted a permanent position at Western Electric after receiving assurances of his freedom there to do basic research. He had found that his teaching responsibilities at the Carnegie Institute largely precluded him from doing research. Davisson remained at Western Electric (and Bell Telephone) until his formal retirement in 1946. He then accepted a research professor appointment at the University of Virginia that continued until his second retirement in 1954. Davisson was elected to the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1929.

; Electron diffraction and the Davisson–Germer experiment :

Diffraction is a characteristic effect when a wave is incident upon an aperture or a grating, and is closely associated with the meaning of wave motion itself. In the 19th century, diffraction was well established for light and for ripples on the surfaces of fluids. In 1927, while working for Bell Labs, Davisson and Lester Germer performed an experiment showing that electrons were diffracted at the surface of a crystal of nickel. This celebrated Davisson–Germer experiment confirmed the de Broglie hypothesis that particles of matter have a wave-like nature, which is a central tenet of quantum mechanics. In particular, their observation of diffraction allowed the first measurement of a wavelength for electrons. The measured wavelength formula_1 agreed well with de Broglie&#x27;s equation formula_2, where formula_3 is the Planck constant and formula_4 is the electron&#x27;s momentum.

== Personal life ==
While doing his graduate work at Princeton, Davisson met his wife and life companion Charlotte Sara Richardson, who was visiting her brother, Professor Richardson. Richardson is the sister-in-law of Oswald Veblen, a prominent mathematician. Clinton and Charlotte Davisson (d.1984) had four children, Owen Davisson, James Davisson, the American physicist Richard Davisson, and Elizabeth Davisson.

== Death and legacy ==
Davisson died on February 1, 1958 in Charlottesville, Virginia, at the age of 76.

An impact crater on the far side of the Moon was named after Davisson in 1970 by the IAU.

<doc id="930271" wikidata="Q2474346" url="?curid=930271" title="Sitka deer">
<text>The Sitka deer or Sitka black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus sitkensis) is a subspecies of mule deer (&quot;Odocoileus hemionus&quot;), similar to the Columbian black-tailed subspecies (&quot;O. h. colombianus&quot;). Their name originates from Sitka, Alaska, and it is not to be confused with the similarly named sika deer. Weighing in on average between , Sitka deer are characteristically smaller than other subspecies of mule deer. Reddish-brown in the summer, their coats darken to a gray-brown in mid- to late August. They are also good swimmers, and can occasionally be seen crossing deep channels between islands. Their average lifespan is about 10 years, but a few are known to have attained an age of 15.

==Habitat and life patterns==
Sitka deer inhabit the coastal rainforests of northern British Columbia and southeastern Alaska. Their natural distribution included the Alexander Archipelago in Alaska and the adjacent mainland coast north to Yakutat. They were also introduced to Haida Gwaii (Queen Charlotte Islands) in the 1890s, Prince William Sound during 1917–1923, the Kodiak Island Archipelago in 1924 and 1930, Yakutat in 1924, and the Skagway and Haines area during the 1950s.

Sitka deer can be both migratory and residential depending on their habitat; but during winter, they primarily reside in old or mixed-age forest growth below , except on the southern two-thirds of Kodiak Island, where forest cover is absent. The rut peaks in mid-November and fawns are born in early June; they weigh . Bucks can weigh up to and does can weigh .

==Diet==
Sitka deer primarily eat green vegetation. However, during the intense Alaskan winters, they also feed on woody vegetation and lichens. Sitka deer have no upper incisors, and digest vegetation through grinding plant material between their upper and lower molars. All &quot;Odocoileus&quot; species are ruminants, in that they have four-chambered stomachs which allow them to &quot;ruminate&quot; (rechew) their food, and contains bacteria specialized in breaking down cellulose. Since these bacteria are so specialized, they have tremendous difficulty digesting strange material and can die of starvation with their bellies full of food. Sitka deer feed on several plants and algae natural to their environment, including &quot;Red Alder&quot; Alnus rubra, &quot;fireweed&quot; Chamaenerion angustifolium, &quot;dandelion&quot; Taraxacum officinale, &quot;skunk cabbage&quot; Lysichiton americanus, &quot;deer heart&quot; Maianthemum dilatatum, &quot;Salmonberry&quot; Rubus spectabilis and &quot;bull kelp&quot; Nereocystis luetkeana. Sitka deer will also opportunistically feed on domestic plants and trees including, apple trees, cherry trees, plumb trees, strawberry plants, raspberry plants and black berry plants.

==Population and hunting==
Sitka deer population fluctuate considerably due to the harsh Alaskan winters and are typically estimated using pellet surveys, DNA, photo traps and other methods. However, they are an abundant species that rapidly recovers from low populations, especially on Admiralty, Baranof, Chichagof, Kodiak, and other islands where wolves are naturally absent. They are not designated at risk. Introduced in the 19th century, Sitka deer have become abundant on the islands of Haida Gwaii, overgrazing local flora, so the Haida Nation forest guardian program encourages meat hunting to reduce total numbers.

Natural predators include wolves, mountain lions, grizzly bears, and American black bears; credible reports have reported killer whales taking them while swimming in deeper water. Human predation seems to have little to no effect on Sitka deer populations. However, habitat loss from clear-cutting old growth forests may contribute to population decline. Normal adult antlers are often small in size; very few deer score above a 110 on the Boone and Crockett system.

Logging practices can affect the populations of the Sitka black-tailed deer. While clearcutting is thought to provide more and better habitat for the Sitka deer clear-cutting can also have a diverse effect on the deer. Hunters have always focused on these clearcut areas and for good reason. However, when the winter has deep snow these clearcut areas are covered leaving less food when the Sitka needs it most. A secondary problem is the energy that is needed for the deer to travel through these areas when the snow is so deep.

On its ruins today stands the town of Sa el-Hagar () or Sa El Hajar.

A Neolithic settlement has been identified at Sais recently (1999), dating to 5000 BC. Agriculture appears here during this period, as well as at another similar site, Merimde Beni Salama, which is located about 80km south of Sais.

The Neolithic period at Sais consists of three phases. The earliest phases are Early Neolithic (Sais I) and Late Neolithic (Sais II). During the Early Neolithic, the site started as a fishing camp but later, in the Middle to Late Neolithic Period, it was settled by agriculturalists for the cultivation of the floodplain.

The evolution of activity from fish processing to a settled hunting and agricultural phase may be connected to gradual changes in climatic conditions from 4600 BC onwards. It is believed that the Middle Holocene Moist phase started at that time.

== Antiquity ==
Herodotus wrote that Sais is where the grave of Osiris was located and that the sufferings of the god were displayed as a mystery by night on an adjacent lake.

The city&#x27;s patron goddess was Neith, whose cult is attested as early as the First Dynasty of Egypt (–3050 BC). The Greeks, such as Herodotus, Plato, and Diodorus Siculus, identified her with Athena and hence postulated a primordial link to Athens. Diodorus recounts that Athenians built Sais before the deluge. While all Greek cities were destroyed during that cataclysm, including Athens, Sais and the others Egyptian cities survived.

There are today no surviving traces of this town prior to the Late New Kingdom () due to the extensive destruction of the city by the &quot;sebakhin&quot; (farmers removing mudbrick deposits for use as fertilizer) leaving only a few relief blocks &quot;in situ&quot;.

Though the proposed Sa El Hagar site has little evidence of this city, Obelisks in Piazza della Minerva and Urbino Italy are claimed to originate from Sais.

During the Islamic conquest of Egypt, a battle was fought at Sais between the Rashidun Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire, according to John of Nikiû. It remained a pagarchy and Christian bishopric at least through the early 700s. Medieval writers like Yaqut al-Hamawi, al-Maqrizi, and al-Qalqashandi attributed the city&#x27;s foundation to one &quot;Sā ibn Misr&quot;; Ibn Iyas called the founder &quot;Sā ibn Marqunus&quot;. The site was used as a stone quarry during this period. By the time of Ibn Iyas, the city had fallen almost completely into ruin.

The 1885 Census of Egypt recorded Sa el-Hagar as a nahiyah under the district of Kafr az-Zayyat in Gharbia Governorate; at that time, the population of the town was 4,474 (2,250 men and 2,224 women).

===Medical school===
The Temple of Sais had a medical school associated with it, as did many ancient Egyptian temples. The medical school at Sais had many female students and apparently women faculty as well, mainly in gynecology and obstetrics. An inscription from the period survives at Sais, and reads, &quot;I have come from the school of medicine at Heliopolis, and have studied at the woman&#x27;s school at Sais, where the divine mothers have taught me how to cure diseases&quot;.

==Cultural depictions==
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Critias&quot; (around 395 BC, 200 years after the visit by the Greek legislator Solon), Sais is the city in which Solon receives the story of Atlantis, its military aggression against Greece and Egypt, its eventual defeat and destruction by gods-punishing catastrophe, from an Egyptian priest. Solon visited Egypt in 590 BC. Plato also notes the city as the birthplace of the pharaoh Amasis II.

Plutarch said that the shrine of Athena, which he identifies with Isis, in Sais carried the inscription &quot;I am all that hath been, and is, and shall be; and my veil no mortal has hitherto raised.&quot;

Hector Berlioz&#x27; &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; (&quot;The Childhood of Christ&quot;), in part Three, has Sais as the setting for the youth of Jesus until age 10, after his parents leave their homeland to escape the Massacre of the Innocents by Herod the Great.

Sais is depicted in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Origins&quot;. Here it is depicted as under the control of a member of the Order of the Ancients named &quot;The Scarab&quot;.

<doc id="930283" wikidata="Q624348" url="?curid=930283" title="Arabic Infancy Gospel">
<text>The Arabic Infancy Gospel is a New Testament apocryphal writing concerning the infancy of Jesus. It may have been compiled as early as the sixth century, and was partly based on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of James, and the Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, though much of it is also based on oral tradition. The only two surviving manuscripts date from 1299 AD and the 15th/16th century in Arabic. They were copied in the area of northern Iraq and show influence from the Quran.

The Arabic Infancy Gospel is related to an older East Syriac work titled the &quot;History of the Virgin&quot;, as it is either an Arabic translation of it or both of them are derived from a common source that might be identified as a Syriac language Infancy Gospel dating to the sixth century or earlier. Both versions feature scenes of the baby Jesus working miracles in common settings. In both texts, Mary helps to bring about the circumstances from which these miracles take place in.

==Contents==
It consists of three parts:
#The birth of Jesus – based on the Protevangelium of James
#Miracles during the Flight into Egypt – in relation with the Vision of Theophilus but also local traditions
#The miracles of Jesus as a boy – based on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas

It contains a number of embellishments on the earlier text, however, including a diaper (of Jesus) that heals people, sweat (of Jesus) that turns into balm, curing leprosy, and dyeing cloth varied colours using only indigo dye. It also claims earlier encounters for Jesus with Judas Iscariot, and with the thieves with whom he is later crucified, as well as being one of the earliest documents.

==Dating==
Although this Gospel is thought to have originated from Syriac sources dating back to the fifth or sixth century, it has become known to European readers by way of an Arabic version published by Henry Sike in 1697 together with a Latin translation. The preface to the William Hone translation states, &quot;It was received by the Gnostics, a sect of Christians in the second century...&quot; The earliest known mention of the Gospel was by Isho&#x27;dad of Merv, a ninth-century Syrian church father, in his biblical commentary concerning the Gospel of Matthew. The narrative of the Arabic Infancy Gospel, particularly the second part concerning the miracles in Egypt, can also be found in the Quran. Some critical scholarship claim its presence in the Qu&#x27;ran may be due to the influence the Gospel had among the Arabs. It is not known for certain that the Gospel was present in the Hejaz, but it can be seen as likely. However, according to Islamic scholars the Gospel was translated into Arabic in the post-Islamic period due to the difficulty that 16th century Europeans would have in translating early Arabic&#x27;s defective script into Latin as well as the extreme rarity of written texts in Pre-Islamic Arabia. Most recent research in the field of Islamic studies by Sydney Griffith et al. (2013), David D. Grafton (2014), Clair Wilde (2014) &amp; ML Hjälm et al. (2016 &amp; 2017) assert that &quot;all one can say about the possibility of a pre-Islamic, Christian version of the Gospel in Arabic is that no sure sign of its actual existence has yet emerged.&quot; Additionally ML Hjälm in her most recent research (2017) inserts that &quot;manuscripts containing translations of the gospels are encountered no earlier than the year 873&quot;. However, according to scholars such as Gabriel S. Reynolds, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily means that the transmissions have to come from written sources, but rather from Jewish and Christian sources that circulated orally in late antique near east.

==Quranic parallels==
Historians working in Quranic studies have discussed a parallel between the Arabic Infancy Gospel and the Quran (Surah 19:29–34) where Jesus speaks from the cradle, though the question of priority between the two is unresolved.

Arabic Infancy Gospel 2: &quot;He has said that Jesus spoke, and, indeed, when He was lying in His cradle said to Mary His mother: I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Logos, whom thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel announced to thee; and my Father has sent me for the salvation of the world.&quot;

Surah 19:29–34: &quot;But she pointed to the babe. They said: &quot;How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?&quot; He said: &quot;I am indeed a servant of Allah: He hath given me revelation and made me a prophet; And He hath made me blessed wheresoever I be, and hath enjoined on me Prayer and Charity as long as I live; (He) hath made me kind to my mother, and not overbearing or miserable; So peace is on me the day I was born, the day that I die, and the day that I shall be raised up to life (again)&quot;! Such (was) Jesus the son of Mary: (it is) a statement of truth, about which they (vainly) dispute.

==Zoroastrian connection==
The third chapter of this Gospel covers the story of the wise men of the East, which, in some respects, closely follows the version of the story from Matthew. Unlike Matthew, however, this account cites Zoradascht (Zoroaster) as the source of the prophecy that motivated the wise men to seek the infant Jesus.

== Editions ==
Two major editions of the Arabic Infancy Gospel have been published. The earlier one was by Heinrich Sike in 1697, based on a manuscript he used from the fifteenth century. The second was by Mario E. Provera using a manuscript from 1299.

<doc id="930291" wikidata="Q1068226" url="?curid=930291" title="Chatham Strait">
<text>Chatham Strait, or Shee ya xhaak in the Tlingit language, is a narrow passage of the Alexander Archipelago in the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska. It separates Chichagof Island and Baranof Island to its west from Admiralty Island and Kuiu Island on its east.

It is long and extends southward from the junction of Icy Strait and Lynn Canal to the open sea. The strait is deep and 5–16 km (3–10 miles) wide.

==Naming==
The meanings of the parts of the name in the Tlingit language for Chatham Strait are as follows: Shee, Baranof Island; Ya, face; Xhaak, Center. The southern part of the strait was named Ensenada del Principe in 1775 by Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra. In 1786 La Perouse gave it the name Tschirikow Bay, and in 1789 the fur trader James Colnett named it Christian Sound. Other early fur traders called it Menzies Strait. It received its present name in 1794 when George Vancouver named it Chatham Strait in honor of William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham; Chatham Sound, farther south in British Columbia, was named by Vancouver for his son John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham, whose brother William Pitt, was Prime Minister of Great Britain.

<doc id="930298" wikidata="Q6858852" url="?curid=930298" title="Millennium Group">
<text>The Millennium Group is a fictional secret society featured in the crime thriller television series &quot;Millennium,&quot; and briefly on &quot;The X-Files.&quot; Having begun life as a Christian sect at the end of the 1st century AD, the Group grew into a far-reaching network which, as the 3rd millennium approached, presented itself as a private investigative firm liaising with law enforcement organizations. Despite being fraught with internal schisms, the Group tried on several occasions to artificially instigate the end of the world as the year 2000 approached.

The Millennium Group&#x27;s role as an investigative organization was based on the real-life Academy Group, a society of retired law enforcement agents in the United States. The presentation of the Group varied as the series progressed, with its role changing from that of a benevolent investigative group to an antagonistic mystic sect. The Millennium Group has been met with negative responses, with its vacillating depiction being a focus of criticism both from critics and from series star Lance Henriksen.

==Fictional history==
The Millennium Group first started life as an early Christian sect around the year 100 AD. By the late 10th century, the Group had adopted the ouroboros as its symbol, and the phrase &quot;this is who we are&quot; as a motto. However, around this time schisms within the group began to form as members fought for control of an artifact—the preserved hand of a saint said to be capable of ultimately defeating the devil. Despite these internal rivalries, the group persisted into the 20th century. The Group&#x27;s modern organization stems from J. Edgar Hoover, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, who began the process of turning the Group&#x27;s attention to criminal investigation in order to monitor individuals and societal trends.

As the 3rd millennium approached, the Group&#x27;s internal differences began to manifest into two factions—the &quot;Roosters&quot;, who believed in a religiously eschatological view of the end of the world, and the &quot;Owls&quot;, who believed the world would end with a secular natural disaster. Attempting to instigate the end of the world artificially, the Rooster faction began to develop a lethal virus; in 1998 they released this virus in the Pacific Northwest, killing upwards of seventy people before the outbreak was contained. A year later, a vastly depleted Millennium Group staged one last attempt to trigger the apocalypse, resurrecting deceased members in order to create the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse; when this plot was foiled by the FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully, it was believed to have caused the dissolution of the Group.

==Production==
The inspiration for the Millennium Group was a real-life organization called the Academy Group, which consisted of retired law enforcement agents working as a private investigative firm. &quot;Millennium&quot; creator Chris Carter had come to know members of the Academy Group through contacts he had made with the Federal Bureau of Investigation while researching his earlier television series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. The Academy Group focused on offender profiling, which shaped the main Millennium Group characters of Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) and Peter Watts (Terry O&#x27;Quinn). Describing his initial inception of the Group, Carter has stated &quot;they believe that all this random violence we see these days, there may actually be some order in the chaos [...] These guys think that, if they care enough, that they can stem the tide of this thing&quot;.

In the series&#x27; second season, new executive producers Glen Morgan and James Wong began to explore a new direction for the Group, moving away from its investigative function and giving a more religious focus. The tone of the second season focused more on the supernatural, showing the Group dealing with demonic forces more than the serial killers of the first season. Producer Ken Horton felt that the increased focus on the Group in the second season arose as the first season&#x27;s use of serial killers as episodic antagonists had &quot;overpowered&quot; its storytelling, making it necessary to turn the show&#x27;s attention elsewhere instead; the focus switched from external forces and villains to the internal workings of the Group. The introduction of schisms within the Group was inspired by Wong&#x27;s research into the Knights Templar and Freemasonry, as he considered these secretive organizations to have mirrored the way he wanted to present the Group, and he felt each contained factions or reactionary elements which he wanted to recreate.

During the third season, the Millennium Group became the series&#x27; chief villains, playing an antagonistic role against Frank Black rather than the supportive role they had previously played. Series star Lance Henriksen, who portrayed Black, felt that this change was unnecessary and damaged the series, as it discarded the work that had been done to &quot;build up&quot; the Group in previous seasons. Henriksen would later state his belief that the &quot;idea of a cultish kind of Millennium Group [...] just about destroyed the show&quot;.

==Reception==
Critical opinions of the Millennium Group&#x27;s role within the series have generally been negative, tending to focus on their inconsistent presentation. Writing in the collection &quot;Back to Frank Black: A Return to Chris Carter&#x27;s Millennium&quot;, author Joseph Maddrey found that the changing nature of the Group&#x27;s aims and methods seemed contradictory, writing that &quot;over the course of Seasons Two and Three, the Millennium Group appears to become more dedicated to promoting fear of the future than to fighting it&quot;. In another essay in this collection, Gordon Roberts described the Group as &quot;endlessly fascinating&quot;, and compared the Group to an organized crime syndicate, likening its requirement of continued devotion to the family unit.

Keith Uhlich, writing for &quot;Slant&quot; magazine, felt that the &quot;reinvention of the Millennium Group from a criminal consulting firm to an ancient, protective sect&quot; did not fit with Carter&#x27;s typical character development, which focussed on individuals and the careers that &quot;define their existence&quot;. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Zack Handlen felt that the third season&#x27;s focus on a villainous Group reduced them to &quot;yet another cabal with seemingly limitless influence and power&quot;, describing them as &quot;just another one of Carter’s beloved shadowy conspiracies&quot;.

<doc id="930300" wikidata="Q1063810" url="?curid=930300" title="Jet Set Radio Future">
<text>is a 2002 action game developed by Smilebit and published by Sega for the Xbox; it is a sequel to the Dreamcast game &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; (2000). As a re-imagining of the original game, it features refined gameplay mechanics, updated graphics, larger open world environments, new characters, an altered plot, a new soundtrack and multiplayer gameplay. The player controls members of the youth street gang, the GGs, that use inline skates to traverse a futuristic Tokyo, spraying graffiti, challenging rival gangs and evading authorities. &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; uses a cel-shaded style of animation like the original.

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; received critical acclaim for its gameplay, soundtrack and graphics. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. The game also released as an Xbox launch title in the Japanese and European regions. After its initial release, it was bundled with new Xbox consoles with &quot;Sega GT 2002&quot; on a dual-game DVD. A third &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; game is currently in development.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; plays similarly to &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; in which the player controls a member of a gang of inline skaters called the GGs to gain control of a futuristic Tokyo. Players can grind through rails and poles, perform various tricks while grinding, perform various mid-air tricks, skate backwards, and use boosts on the ground and on rails in order to move faster. When a player is skating fast, they can come to a quick stop by performing an advanced inline-skating move called the powerslide.

Much of the game requires the player to search for graffiti tags left by other gangs and spray over them with their own. To do this, players will need to collect spray cans littered across each stage. Spraying is more streamlined from the last game, with manual spraying over large tags replaced by multiple spray targets depending on the tag&#x27;s size. Unlike &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, there is no time limit and spray targets can be completed at any time.

Open world stages in the level are larger, and are now interconnected, with time limits removed, and often feature multiple objectives. These range from mimicking a rival&#x27;s trick line or beating other skaters in a race. The police, who previously chased after the player in the last game, now appear in specific areas, with the player tasked with stopping them by charging into them and spraying them to defeat them. Each area has hidden items to collect, including Graffiti Souls, which unlock new graffiti designs, and Hidden Tapes which unlock additional missions where more Graffiti Souls can be earned. The game features multiplayer gameplay up to 4 players and several multiplayer modes. The game also features the option to design one&#x27;s tags.

==Plot==
In a futuristic Tokyo, a group of teenage skaters called the GG&#x27;s vie for control of the Tokyo streets against rival groups. The Rokkaku Group, a megacorporation, has taken over much of the city and their leader is the new mayor of the city. The group is oppressing the people, taking away freedom of speech and expression, and is forcing other gang members to give up their territory using the corrupt police force of Tokyo.

The game begins with the player&#x27;s character, Yoyo, who must complete a set of basic training exercises from Gum to prove himself worthy of joining the GG&#x27;s. After completing these challenges, the game is interrupted by a pirate radio broadcast by &#x27;DJ Professor K&#x27; who informs the player on the turmoil within Tokyo. After this cutscene, the player is released into Tokyo itself, where they cover Dogenzaka Hill in graffiti, race a new skater named Beat and fight the authoritarian Rokkaku Group and their police force, the Rokkaku Police.

During the game, the GG&#x27;s recruit multiple members while scuffling between other gangs such as Poison Jam and Rapid 99 taking over their respective territories while also protecting their own. The GG&#x27;s eventually have to go up against more disciples of the Rokkaku Group such as the Noise Tanks and the Golden Rhinos which eventually leads to a showdown against the mayor of Tokyo, Rokkaku Gouji. Gouji tries to launch an event known as the &quot;Rokkaku Expo&quot;, attempting to take away the citizen&#x27;s of Tokyo&#x27;s freewill and eventually the world&#x27;s, but is defeated by the GG&#x27;s in the end. During the end credits, DJ Professor K goes over how money and greed can corrupt mankind which ultimately led to Gouji&#x27;s demise. In a post-credits scene, DJ Professor K gets a notice about the streets being in trouble again, questioning who will &quot;rise up to the call&quot;.

==Development and release==
&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was initially coined under the name &quot;Jet Set Radio 2&quot; and was scheduled as a Dreamcast game. Lead art designer, Ryuta Ueda, and composer, Hideki Naganuma, both stated that the game is not a continuation of the original &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, but a remake taking place in an alternate reality. After the Dreamcast&#x27;s discontinuation, Sega left the console market and began developing and publishing games for other platforms, including extensively supporting Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox. During Tokyo Game Show 2001, both Microsoft and Sega announced a long-term, strategic alliance to bring future versions of Sega&#x27;s great games to the Xbox. Both corporations announced an 11-title publishing alliance to premiere many of Sega&#x27;s upcoming games on the platform. Chief Xbox officer, Robbie Bach, stated that &quot;having Sega on board with Xbox is a huge win for gamers around the world&quot;. Bach also stated that &quot;the creative artists at Sega not only are going to deliver great Xbox games, they will help us establish the benchmark for great Xbox gaming experiences both on and offline&quot;. Sega of America president and CEO, Peter Moore, commented: &quot;We believe that Microsoft will be very successful with Xbox, which is why we have such a close, strategic relationship with them. Our world-renowned development studios have been very impressed with the Xbox hardware, and they are excited to bring new gaming experiences to consumers by utilizing the platform&#x27;s power and network capabilities. We share Microsoft&#x27;s commitment to broadband online gaming and will work with it to deliver the best content possible to gamers&quot;.

The development schedule was one year and one month, and it was difficult to release it in time for the launch of the Xbox in Japan, as well releasing it worldwide soon after. For gameplay, the goal was to inscrease the sense of speed, therefore making the world bigger. Graffiti spraying was also streamlined to keep the fast pace. The development environment of the Xbox made it easy to develop, and the team felt that they pushed the Xbox as far as they could at the time.

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was first publicly shown in 2001 at E3 and the Tokyo Game Show. It was also announced under the name &quot;Jet Grind Radio Future&quot;, to stay consistent with the previous game release in North America due to trademark problems for &quot;Jet Set&quot; at the time. The game reverted back to its original name as the trademark problems were resolved. &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was released as an Xbox launch title in both Japan and Europe. In 2002, it was first released in Japan on February 22, followed by North America on February 26, and Europe on March 14.

A deal was made between Sega and Microsoft in late 2002 to have &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; along with &quot;Sega GT 2002&quot; bundled with the Xbox on a dual-game DVD. It was stated by Xbox marketing manager, David Hufford, that the new bundle was designed to further fuel the installed base for Xbox and was great way to reach out to consumers looking for a great value during the holiday season.

=== Soundtrack ===
The soundtrack contains a total of 34 songs and is played in a premixed format consisting of certain playlists directed for each chapter, and for certain levels, although there is a jukebox. The main theme of the game is called &quot;The Concept of Love&quot;. Alongside returning video game composers from the first game Hideki Naganuma and Richard Jacques, the soundtrack features artists such as indie rock band Guitar Vader, Beastie Boys Adrock side project BS 2000, hip hop/breakbeat group Scapegoat Wax, indie pop band Bis, The Latch Brothers (including Mike D of the Beastie Boys, Chris &quot;Wag&quot; Wagner and Kenny Tick Salcido), rock band Cibo Matto, musical collective Bran Van 3000, and hip hop group The Prunes.

A soundtrack CD for the game titled &quot;Jet Set Radio Future Music Sampler&quot;, was given to people who pre-ordered the game in the United States, featuring 11 tracks from the game. It was published by Wave Master and distributed by Grand Royal. The CD album titled &quot;Jet Set Radio Future Original Sound Tracks&quot; (SCDC-00166), was released by Scitron Discs on March 20, 2002, featuring 22 tracks from the game and was distributed by Sony Music Distribution (Japan) Inc. For the HD release of the original &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot;, a new CD album titled &quot;Jet Set Radio: Original Soundtrack with Bonus Tracks from JSRF&quot;, was distributed by Sumthing Else on September 18, 2012, for North America and Europe, containing 17 tracks including 7 from &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;. The latest album titled &quot;Jet Set Radio Future SEGA Original Tracks&quot;, was released digitally by Sega, containing 20 tracks. It was released on iTunes and streaming services on October 3, 2012 alongside &quot;Jet Set Radio SEGA Original Tracks&quot;, made for the original game&#x27;s HD release.

==Reception==
=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was critically acclaimed, receiving &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews according to GameRankings and Metacritic In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 32 out of 40.

The game was awarded &quot;Outstanding Original Sports Game&quot; and was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Animation in a Game Engine&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Art Direction in a Game Engine&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Original Musical Score&quot; by the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers. &quot;IGN&quot; called it &quot;one of the coolest titles around&quot; but said that it also fails to reach classic status because it was &quot;not enough of a challenge&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; described it as &quot;one of the better Xbox games to date&quot; and disagreed with &quot;IGN&quot;, claiming the game &quot;offered a serious challenge&quot;. The publication named it the second-best video game of February 2002, and it won the annual &quot;Best Platformer&quot;, &quot;Best Music&quot; and &quot;Best Graphics (Artistic)&quot; awards among Xbox games. It received a nomination for the Xbox &quot;Game of the Year&quot; prize, but lost to &quot;MechAssault&quot;. Despite positive reviews, this was not followed by high sales. It was nominated for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Best Game No One Played on Xbox&quot; award, and landed the title of the most unfairly ignored game in the OXM UK Awards the year of its release. During the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; for &quot;Console Action/Adventure Game of the Year&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game at #44 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Games To Play Today&quot;, writing: &quot;The sound track is peerless, and whether grinding vertically down a 200-foot dragon, leaping across Shibuya&#x27;s handrails, or just cruising the wrong way down a one-way street, there&#x27;s nowhere else that&#x27;s so exhilarating to simply travel through&quot;. The game was also featured in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;. In 2016, Watchmojo ranked it 9th Best Xbox Multiplayer Game, stating how the five multiplayer modes added even more depth to the game, and calling it one hell of a game to get as its unique tone, easy accessibility and brilliant level design made it a game worth buying on its own.

=== Sales ===
&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; sold 80,000 units in the United States in its first six months. It sold a total of 28,433 units in Japan.

==Legacy and fandom==
The game was highly regarded, but this did not translate into sales. Director Masayoshi Kikuchi concluded that they wanted to pursue profitability and popularity in Japan, which led to the Yakuza series, which he also worked on.

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was briefly featured in the music video to &quot;Hella Good&quot; by American rock band No Doubt.

The character Beat and stages based on Shibuya Terminal, Rokkaku Dai Heights, 99th Street, and Highway Zero appear in the 2010 game &quot;Sonic &amp; Sega All-Stars Racing&quot;. The Shibuya stage also appears in the 2012 game &quot;Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed&quot;.

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; was later made backwards compatible for the Xbox 360. Unlike &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; and other Sega games for Xbox, &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot; has not been made backwards compatible for the Xbox One or the Xbox Series X/S. In a 2023 interview, Xbox Game Studios CEO Phil Spencer confirmed that an unsuccessful attempt was made to add the game to Xbox&#x27;s backwards compatibility program, stating: &quot;One of the games I&#x27;d always wanted to get, we weren&#x27;t able to land it in our backward compatibility program, was &quot;Jet Set Radio Future&quot;.&quot; Comicbook.com has speculated that this may be due to problems with licensing the soundtrack, among other reasons.

&quot;Jet Set Radio Future Randomizer&quot; is an (RNG)-based mod of the game where everything is randomized. The game itself as well as the mod have both been speedrun at Games Done Quick.

===Sequel===
Kuju Entertainment presented Sega with a concept for a new &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; game for the Nintendo Wii, but Sega was not interested in developing new games in the series. In 2017, Dinosaur Games created a proof of concept, &quot;Jet Set Radio Evolution&quot;, after Sony expressed interest in their work at GDC 2017. Sega declined the project.

In mid-2020, the &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; lead designer, Kazuki Hosokawa, told &quot;USGamer&quot; that he and his team were &quot;too old and experienced&quot; to create a new &quot;Jet Set Radio&quot; game with the &quot;same energy&quot; as the original. In 2021, it was reported that the art director, Ryuta Ueda, had rejoined Sega. During The Game Awards 2023, a new title was formally announced, alongside reboots of several other Sega franchises including &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, &quot;Golden Axe&quot;, &quot;Shinobi&quot;, and &quot;Streets of Rage&quot;.

<doc id="930301" wikidata="Q295688" url="?curid=930301" title="Edward Rydz-Śmigły">
<text>Marshal Edward Śmigły-Rydz also called Edward Rydz-Śmigły, (11 March 1886 – 2 December 1941) was a Polish politician, statesman, Marshal of Poland and Commander-in-Chief of Poland&#x27;s armed forces, as well as a painter and poet.

Born in 1886, he came from humble beginnings and was raised by his maternal grandparents after he became an orphan at age 13. He graduated with distinctions from the local Gymnasium. He completed his studies in philosophy and history of art at the Jagiellonian University.

During the interwar period, he was an exceptionally admired public figure in Poland and was regarded as a hero for his exemplary record as an army commander in the Polish Legions of World War I and the ensuing Polish–Soviet War in 1920. He was appointed Commander-in-Chief and Inspector General of the Polish Armed Forces following Marshal Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s death in 1935. Rydz served in this capacity at the start of World War II during the invasion of Poland.

When war loomed, political differences fell away and defense became the national priority. Consequently, Rydz&#x27;s stature eclipsed even that of the president. The shock of the Polish defeat made objective evaluations of his legacy during and after the war difficult; his reputation, very much tied to the critical early months of World War II, remains tendentious and controversial.

==Early life==
Edward Rydz was born in the city of Brzeżany (now Berezhany in western Ukraine), Galicia, Austria-Hungary, to Polish parents. He was the son of a professional non-commissioned officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army, Tomasz Rydz, and his wife Maria Babiak. Rydz grew up in rather humble circumstances and was orphaned at the age of 13. He was then raised by his maternal grandparents and, after their deaths, by the family of a Dr. Uranowicz, the town physician at Brzeżany. 

After graduating with distinction from the local &quot;gymnasium&quot; (secondary school), Rydz went to Kraków, where he completed studies in philosophy and history of art at the Jagiellonian University. He then studied to be a painter at the Academy of Fine Arts in Kraków, and later in Vienna and Munich. In 1910–1911 he attended the reserve officers&#x27; academy in Vienna and received military training at the renowned Austrian 4th Infantry Regiment, the &quot;Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights&quot;.

Rydz finished his military education with distinction and was offered a commission in the Imperial Army, which he declined. In 1912 he became a founder of the Polish paramilitary group, the Riflemen&#x27;s Association (&quot;Związek Strzelecki&quot;). Concurrently he completed his art studies, regarded a talented landscape and portrait painter by professors and critics.

== Early Military Career ==

Drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army in July 1914, Rydz was transferred in August to the Polish Legions and fought in World War I in the famous Polish 1st Brigade of Józef Piłsudski. He took part in numerous engagements against the Imperial Russian Army in the region of the Southern Vistula and rose quickly in rank. By 1916, he was already a full colonel. He did not forget his art, however, and exhibited his work at a gallery in Kraków around that time. In 1917, after their refusal to swear an oath to the Austrian and German authorities, the Legions were disbanded, their soldiers interned and their leader Józef Piłsudski imprisoned in Magdeburg fortress. By Piłsudski&#x27;s appointment, Rydz (who was released from prison on grounds of ill health) became commander of the Polish Military Organization (&quot;POW&quot;) and adopted the nom de guerre &quot;Śmigły&quot; (&quot;Swift&quot;, &quot;Deft&quot;), which he later officially added to his surname.

In October 1918 Rydz joined Ignacy Daszyński&#x27;s socialist government in Lublin as minister of war. Having been promoted to brigadier general, he emphasized that on accepting the ministerial post he was to be seen as a deputy of Piłsudski. It was at this time that he began using the dual surname Śmigły-Rydz. On 11 November 1918 the government relinquished power to Piłsudski, who became Provisional Head of State. After some hesitation, Piłsudski (though displeased at Śmigły-Rydz having worked with the socialists) confirmed his rank of brigadier general in the Polish army.

=== Military triumphs ===

During the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–21, Rydz commanded Polish armies in several offensives against the Bolsheviks. Among the victorious engagements, he captured the cities of Wilno (Vilnius) and Dünaburg. Following his victories on the field, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Latvian armed forces and soon liberated Latgale from the Red Army. Subsequently, he annihilated the Red Army&#x27;s 12th Army and took Kiev. After the Bolshevik counterattack led the Red Army to the gates of Warsaw, Rydz commanded the Central Front of the Polish forces during the Battle of Warsaw of 1920, also known as the &quot;Miracle on the Vistula&quot;. In this decisive battle, Śmigły-Rydz&#x27;s Central Front held firm against the Soviet attack and later blocked the escape routes for the defeated Bolshevik 4th and 15th Armies, as well as the 3rd Cavalry Corps of Soviet General Gayk Bzhishkyan, which in the end retreated to East Prussia to be interned by the Germans.

== Army inspector 1921-1935 ==

At the conclusion of the Polish-Soviet war, Rydz was appointed Inspector General of the Polish Army in the Wilno district and later in Warsaw. In November 1924, he informally headed the so-called strike of the generals, in which a group of Polish Army commanders resigned to demonstrate their dissatisfaction with the lack of reaction of the Ministry of Military Affairs to the statements of General Franciszek Latinik that were unfavorable to former legionnaires. In 1926, during Piłsudski&#x27;s May Coup, Rydz took the Marshal&#x27;s side and sent troops from Wilno to reinforce anti-government troops in Warsaw. Piłsudski never forgot this fidelity, and in 1929, Rydz was appointed the Marshal&#x27;s deputy on all matters concerning the East.

== &quot;Second Man&quot; in the State ==

On 13 May 1935, following Piłsudski&#x27;s death, Rydz was nominated by the president and government of Poland to serve in the capacity of the Inspector-General of the Polish Armed Forces, the highest Polish military office. This was done in accordance with Piłsudski&#x27;s wishes. Piłsudski&#x27;s death saw his followers (the Sanacja), divide themselves into three main factions: those supporting President Ignacy Mościcki as Piłsudski&#x27;s successor, those supporting Rydz, and those supporting Prime Minister Walery Sławek. Mościcki in the end would conclude a power-sharing agreement with Śmigły-Rydz, which saw Slawek marginalised as a serious political player by the end of the year. As a result of this agreement, Śmigły-Rydz was to become the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Poland until the outbreak of the war, whereas Mościcki remained influential by continuing as president. From 1935, Rydz saw himself rapidly elevated in rank and position. On 15 July 1936, he was officially awarded the title of &quot;Second Man in the State after the President&quot; by the Polish prime minister. On 10 November, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Poland. Rydz&#x27;s image as Piłsudski&#x27;s anointed successor was popularized by the &quot;Obóz Zjednoczenia Narodowego&quot; (&quot;Camp of National Unity&quot;), or &quot;Ozon&quot;, movement, but it alienated many of Piłsudski&#x27;s supporters, who were offended by what they saw as Rydz&#x27;s acts of self-promotion.

The period of Rydz&#x27;s rule, 1935–39, has often been referred to as &quot;a dictatorship without a dictator&quot;. Rydz lacked the moral authority of Piłsudski, and the &quot;Piłsudskiites&quot; were bitterly divided after his death in 1935. The ruling regime was divided between the Mościcki faction (known as the &quot;President&#x27;s men&quot; or the &quot;Castle group&quot;), made up mainly of civilians, and Rydz&#x27;s group, known as the &quot;Marshal&#x27;s men&quot;, mostly old comrades of Piłsudski and professional officers. Besides these two major groups, there were also supporters of Sławek and other disgruntled Piłsudskiite groups, which were marginalized after the Rydz-Mościcki pact.The regime became increasingly authoritarian, as manifested by the creation of the Ozon movement. However, Ozon never achieved its goal of developing popular mass appeal and transforming Rydz into &quot;Poland&#x27;s second great leader&quot; (after Piłsudski himself). Several of Poland&#x27;s most prominent politicians, including Mościcki and Foreign Minister Józef Beck, made a point of distancing themselves from this movement.

==World War II==

In March 1939, Hitler split Czechoslovakia into the occupied Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and satellite state of Slovakia. This encircled Poland with an iron ring on all sides except the east. Rydz was the only member of government who saw the impending danger of a conflict with Germany. However, the time remaining was too short for the creation of a new army operational plan in the west. During negotiations in Moscow in August 1939, Rydz refused all attempts by the Western Powers to obtain Polish permission for the Red Army to march westward, stating that &quot;there is no guarantee that the Soviets will really take active part in the war; furthermore, once having entered Polish territory, they will never leave it.&quot;

On 1 September 1939, the Germans invaded Poland, and Śmigły-Rydz was named Commander-in-Chief of all Polish forces. On 7 September, along with most of the government, he evacuated Warsaw as it came under attack. Soon afterwards, Polish coordination began to suffer from issues with their communication equipment, which impaired Rydz&#x27;s ability to command his forces effectively. In Brest (Brześć) on 11 September, he ordered the Polish capital to be defended at all costs. In his plan, Warsaw and the nearby Modlin Fortress were to become two redoubt-citadels in central Poland to fight on for as long as possible while the bulk of the Polish forces were to defend the Romanian bridgehead and await the counterattack promised by Poland&#x27;s allies – the French and British. Unknown to Śmigły-Rydz, the Western Allies had no such plan and expected Poland to fall (see Western betrayal). This strategy was further crippled when Soviet forces invaded Poland from the east on 17 September. Realizing that mounting a defence against both Germany and the USSR was impossible, Śmigły-Rydz issued orders to his forces to begin a retreat towards Romania and to not waste men on fighting the Soviet aggressors.

On 18 September 1939, after avoiding capture by Soviet and then German troops, Śmigły-Rydz escaped to Romania and was interned. The crossing of the Polish government into Romania prevented Poland from having to officially surrender and allowed Polish soldiers to continue the fight against Nazi Germany, though Rydz&#x27;s flight sparked some controversy because of his position as supreme commander of the Polish armed forces. Large numbers of Polish soldiers and airmen managed to escape into southern Europe through Hungary and Romania and later regrouped in France. After the French surrender, they re-assembled once more, but this time in the UK.

==Last years and death==
John Gunther wrote after Śmigły-Rydz and Beck were interned in Romania that &quot;They ought, one might say, to have been interned somewhere else before&quot;. As the Commander-in-Chief of Polish Armed Forces, Śmigły-Rydz took complete responsibility for Poland&#x27;s military defeat in September 1939. Rydz had proven himself an extremely able commander on smaller fronts in earlier wars, but was not an experienced strategist in a great conflict. Indeed, in 1922, in an evaluation of Polish generals, Piłsudski had written about him: &quot;in operational work he displays healthy common sense and a lot of stubborn energy. I could recommend him to everybody as a commander of an army, I am however not sure if he possesses sufficient abilities to function as commander-in-chief in a war between two states.&quot;

During his internment in Romania, Śmigły-Rydz initiated the creation of a Polish underground originating from officers who were loyal to the memory of Piłsudski. Still in Romania, on 27 October, he relinquished his function as the Commander-in-Chief and Inspector-General of the Armed Forces. This role was assumed by Władysław Sikorski, who was serving in the new Polish government-in-exile in France (and after 1940 in the United Kingdom).

In the autumn of 1939, Polish journalist Melchior Wańkowicz met Beck, also in internment, and he managed to talk to him for a few hours. This is what Wańkowicz wrote about this meeting: &quot;It was completely impossible to get to Rydz, as he was kept in wild mountains, in the summer villa of Patriarch Miron, closely guarded by a special unit of Romanian police. I managed to get to his villa after bribing a Romanian officer, with the help of Rydz&#x27;s physician, Dr. Cianciara (...) The Marshal spoke with a charming smile, but there was no spark in this smile. He said that after Piłsudski&#x27;s death, the condition of the army was catastrophic: &quot;The cost of the construction of modest fortifications along our western border was equivalent to an 18-month budget of Poland, and at the same time, we were working on fortifications in the East. A modest armament plan was up to 5 billion zlotys. What was I supposed to do? I am not an economist, minister Eugeniusz Kwiatkowski told me that we only had 180 million (...) We began partial mobilization in the spring 1939. The nation hated it, more than 1,000 Silesians deserted to Germany. We were unable to keep Poland mobilized for so long, we could not afford it (...) They say that I am a coward. I had three options: to surrender, to kill myself, and to be captured. It was impossible to fight, as I had only half a company of soldiers with me. To kill myself meant failure. To fly to Warsaw?&quot;

Śmigły-Rydz was transferred from the internment camp to the villa of a former Romanian prime minister in Dragoslavele, from where he escaped on 10 December 1940 and crossed illegally into Hungary.
His flight to Hungary and rumours about his planned return to Poland were a source of considerable displeasure to his rival Sikorski, now Prime Minister. Sikorski had been in opposition to Śmigły-Rydz and Piłsudski from the time of the 1926 May Coup. Sikorski declared in a telegram to General Stefan Grot-Rowecki, leader of the Armia Krajowa (AK) underground resistance in Poland: &quot;the Polish Government will regard a sojourn of the Marshal in Poland as a sabotage of its work in the country. The Marshal must as soon as possible move to some country of the British Empire&quot;. However, Śmigły-Rydz left Hungary on 25 October 1941, and travelling through Slovakia reached Poland. On 30 October, in strict secrecy, he came back to Warsaw to participate in the resistance movement as a common underground soldier, thus voluntarily suspending his rank as Marshal of Poland. He managed to contact Grot-Rowecki, but remained incognito. He died suddenly of heart failure at the age of 55, on 2 December 1941, only five weeks after his arrival in Warsaw. He was buried in Warsaw under his nom de guerre &quot;Adam Zawisza&quot;. His tombstone at the Powązki Cemetery bore this assumed name until 1991. A new tombstone inscribed with the Marshal&#x27;s full name was placed over his grave by the people of Warsaw in 1994.

Rydz was married to Marta Zaleska, &quot;née&quot; Thomas; they had no children.

==Legacy==
Edward Śmigły-Rydz&#x27;s reputation after World War II was generally negative. In the Soviet Union, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, and other Eastern Bloc states, he was denounced for his participation in the Polish-Soviet War in 1920, for the political repression of far-left elements under his military government of the late 1930s, and for his key role in the Polish defeat of 1939. In the West, due to the influence of anti-Piłsudski circles (with Władysław Sikorski as their foremost representative), he was seen as having fled the battlefield in 1939, and little recognition was given to the actual and impossible circumstances of Poland&#x27;s invasion and defeat by the Germans and Soviets.

In 2016 a large and detailed oil painting was discovered amongst the archives of the Sikorski Museum in London. It had been folded into four and hidden in a briefcase by an unknown person and smuggled to Britain to avoid being taken by the Nazi occupation forces. After quite a feat of restoration funded by Philip Bujak, a member of the Polish Heritage Society, the fully restored painting was presented back to the Sikorski Institute where it is currently on display.

<text>In proof theory, a coherent space (also coherence space) is a concept introduced in the semantic study of linear logic.

Let a set &quot;C&quot; be given. Two subsets &quot;S&quot;,&quot;T&quot; ⊆ &quot;C&quot; are said to be &quot;orthogonal&quot;, written &quot;S&quot; ⊥ &quot;T&quot;, if &quot;S&quot; ∩ &quot;T&quot; is ∅ or a singleton. The &quot;dual&quot; of a family &quot;F&quot; ⊆ ℘(&quot;C&quot;) is the family &quot;F&quot; ⊥ of all subsets &quot;S&quot; ⊆ &quot;C&quot; orthogonal to every member of &quot;F&quot;, i.e., such that &quot;S&quot; ⊥ &quot;T&quot; for all &quot;T&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;. A coherent space &quot;F&quot; over &quot;C&quot; is a family of &quot;C&quot;-subsets for which &quot;F&quot; = (&quot;F&quot; ⊥) ⊥.

In &quot;Proofs and Types&quot; coherent spaces are called coherence spaces. A footnote explains that although in the French original they were &quot;espaces cohérents&quot;, the coherence space translation was used because spectral spaces are sometimes called coherent spaces.

== Definitions ==
As defined by Jean-Yves Girard, a &quot;coherence space&quot; formula_1 is a collection of sets satisfying down-closure and binary completeness in the following sense:

* Down-closure: all subsets of a set in formula_2 remain in formula_2: formula_4
* Binary completeness: for any subset formula_5 of formula_2, if the pairwise union of any of its elements is in formula_2, then so is the union of all the elements of formula_5: formula_9

The elements of the sets in formula_2 are known as &quot;tokens&quot;, and they are the elements of the set formula_11.

Coherence spaces correspond one-to-one with (undirected) graphs (in the sense of a bijection from the set of coherence spaces to that of undirected graphs). The graph corresponding to formula_2 is called the &quot;web&quot; of formula_2 and is the graph induced a reflexive, symmetric relation formula_14 over the token space formula_15 of formula_2 known as &quot;coherence modulo&quot; formula_2 defined as:formula_18In the web of formula_2, nodes are tokens from formula_15 and an edge is shared between nodes formula_21 and formula_22 when formula_23 (i.e. formula_24.) This graph is unique for each coherence space, and in particular, elements of formula_2 are exactly the cliques of the web of formula_2 i.e. the sets of nodes whose elements are pairwise adjacent (share an edge.)

== Coherence spaces as types ==
Coherence spaces can act as an interpretation for types in type theory where points of a type formula_2 are points of the coherence space formula_2. This allows for some structure to be discussed on types. For instance, each term formula_21 of a type formula_2 can be given a set of finite approximations formula_31 which is in fact, a directed set with the subset relation. With formula_21 being a coherent subset of the token space formula_15 (i.e. an element of formula_2), any element of formula_31 is a finite subset of formula_21 and therefore also coherent, and we have formula_37

=== Stable functions ===
Functions between types formula_38 are seen as &quot;stable&quot; functions between coherence spaces. A stable function is defined to be one which respects approximants and satisfies a certain stability axiom. Formally, formula_39 is a stable function when

# It is monotone with respect to the subset order (respects approximation, categorically, is a functor over the poset formula_2): formula_41
# It is continuous (categorically, preserves filtered colimits): formula_42 where formula_43 is the directed union over formula_31, the set of finite approximants of formula_21.
# It is &quot;stable&quot;: formula_46 Categorically, this means that it preserves the pullback:

=== Product space ===
In order to be considered stable, functions of two arguments must satisfy the criterion 3 above in this form: formula_47which would mean that in addition to stability in each argument alone, the pullback

is preserved with stable functions of two arguments. This leads to the definition of a product space formula_48 which makes a bijection between stable binary functions (functions of two arguments) and stable unary functions (one argument) over the product space. The product coherence space is a product in the categorical sense i.e. it satisfies the universal property for products. It is defined by the equations:

* formula_49 (i.e. the set of tokens of formula_50 is the coproduct (or disjoint union) of the token sets of formula_2 and formula_52.
* Tokens from differents sets are always coherent and tokens from the same set are coherent exactly when they are coherent in that set.
** formula_53
** formula_54
** formula_55

<doc id="930309" wikidata="Q359266" url="?curid=930309" title="Admiralty Island">
<text>Admiralty Island is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in Southeast Alaska. It is 145 km (90 mi) long and 56 km (35 mi) wide with an area of 4,264.1 km2 (1,646.4 sq mi), making it the seventh-largest island in the United States and the 132nd largest island in the world. It is one of the ABC islands in Alaska. The island is nearly cut in two by the Seymour Canal; to its east is the long, narrow Glass Peninsula. Most of Admiralty Island—955,747 acres (3,868 km2)—is protected as the Admiralty Island National Monument administered by the Tongass National Forest. The Kootznoowoo Wilderness encompasses vast stands of old-growth temperate rainforest. These forests provide some of the best habitat available to species such as brown bears, bald eagles, and Sitka black-tailed deer.

Angoon, a traditional Tlingit community home to 572 people, is the only settlement on the island, although an unpopulated section of the city of Juneau comprises 264.68 km2 (102.19 sq mi) (6.2 percent) of the island&#x27;s land area near its northern end. The island&#x27;s total population at the 2000 census was 650.

The national monument is considered sacred space to the Angoon Tribe of Tlingit people, who live on tribal land in the community of Angoon on the western coast of the island. The Tlingits fought to make protection for the island a part of ANILCA legislation, and continue to engage in stewardship of the island&#x27;s natural resources. Most of Angoon&#x27;s residents make daily subsistence use of the national monument.

== History ==
It is known to the Tlingit as Xootsnoowú, which is commonly interpreted as &quot;Fortress of the Bear(s)&quot;, and gives its name to .

The island was named by British naval officer George Vancouver in honor of his Royal Navy employers, the Admiralty. Joseph Whidbey, master of the &quot;Discovery&quot; during Vancouver&#x27;s 1791–95 expedition, explored it in July–August 1794, in the process circumnavigating it.

The Admiralty Island National Monument was created December 1, 1978, by President Jimmy Carter. In the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act Congress designated all but (74 km2) of the monument as the Kootznoowoo Wilderness, ensuring that the vast bulk of this monument is permanently protected from development. The monument is administered by the U.S. Forest Service from offices in Juneau.

In 1986 it was named a biosphere reserve along with Glacier Bay National Park.

== Ecology ==
Western hemlock, Sitka spruce and western redcedar dominate the prolific rainforest vegetation; wildlife in abundance includes brown bear, bald eagles, many species of salmon, whales, and deer. Admiralty Island is home to the highest density of brown bears in North America. An estimated 1,600 brown bears inhabit the island, outnumbering Admiralty&#x27;s human residents nearly three to one. It has more brown bears than the entire lower 48 states, and one of the highest densities of bald eagles in the world.

==Whaling==

Murder Cove is located at the southernmost portion of the island and was home to the Tyee Company whaling station.

==Mining==
The Greens Creek mine is an underground silver, gold, zinc and lead mine located on the northwest end of the island, within the national monument. It began operations in 1989.

==Recreation==
Admiralty Island offers opportunities for outdoor recreation. The 32-mile Cross Admiralty Canoe Route is a popular destination for backcountry canoeing and kayaking, traversing the breadth of the island through a series of lakes, streams and trail portages, with several cabins and shelters along the way. While the modern route was laid out and constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s, it follows traces long used by the island&#x27;s native inhabitants for hunting, fishing and trading.

The Pack Creek Brown Bear Viewing Area offers visitors the opportunity to observe brown bears in their natural habitat as they fish for salmon and interact with one another during the summer months. Permits are required for all visitors to Pack Creek; they can be obtained through the Forest Service.

Over recent decades, various fishing and outdoor recreation lodges have opened up on the island with most of these lodges operating in the Tlingit town of Angoon. There’s also one lodge on a small, privately held plot of land within the national monument.

==Lighthouse==
The Point Retreat Light is located on the northern tip of Admiralty and was an important aid-to-navigation.

<text>Target Books is a British publishing imprint, established in 1973 by Universal-Tandem Publishing Co Ltd, a paperback publishing company. The imprint was established as a children&#x27;s imprint to complement the adult Tandem imprint, and became well known for their highly successful range of novelisations and other assorted books based on the popular science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Their first publications based on the serial were reprints in paperback of three novels which had been previously published as hardbacks by Frederick Muller Ltd: &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who and the Crusaders&quot; by David Whitaker, and &quot;Doctor Who and the Zarbi&quot; by Bill Strutton. As these sold well further novelisations of the show were commissioned. In 1975 Universal-Tandem was sold by its American owners, the Universal-Award group, to the British conglomerate Howard and Wyndham. The company was renamed Tandem Publishing Ltd before being merged with the paperback imprints of Howard and Wyndham&#x27;s general publishing house W. H. Allen Ltd to become Wyndham Publications Ltd in 1976. However, during 1977 and 1978, the Wyndham identity was phased out and, until 1990, Target books were published by &#x27;the paperback division of WH Allen &amp; Co&#x27;.

The most prolific writer in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; range was Terrance Dicks, while actor turned writer Ian Marter, Malcolm Hulke, Philip Hinchcliffe and Nigel Robinson (who was for a time the editor of the range) were also contributors.

The company also produced novelisations of various other films and television series, again aimed mostly at the child and teenage markets. They also published a number of original children&#x27;s and teenage novels. In 1973, the company produced a successful paperback edition of Tim Dinsdale&#x27;s book, &quot;The Story of the Loch Ness Monster&quot;. In 1977, Target published the novelisation of the Ray Harryhausen film, &quot;Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger&quot;.

W. H. Allen was acquired by Virgin Books in a process that spanned late 1986 to late 1987. In 1994, the Target imprint was closed down and the last three novelisation published by Virgin were under the Doctor Who Books imprint. They did, however, feature the Target logo inside and were numbered in Target&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Who Library&quot; on inside pages.

Random House, through its United Kingdom division, acquired a 90% stake in Virgin Books (including Target) in March 2007. In November 2009, Virgin became an independent imprint within Ebury Publishing, a division of the Random House Group.

Ebury Publishing having acquired a majority shareholding of BBC Books in 2006, BBC Books published reprints of several of the Target &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novelisations starting in 2011 .

In 2018, BBC Books started publishing novelisations of select post-2005 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories and a new abridged version of &quot;City of Death&quot; using the Target branding in a range of books called the &quot;Target Collection&quot;. This range also included novelisations of stories not published by the original Target Books, as they were unable to secure rights as well as print versions of audiobook exclusive novelisations previously released by BBC Audio.

<text>&quot;Mon pays&quot; (&quot;My Country&quot;, or &quot;My Homeland&quot;, in English) is a song composed by Quebec singer-songwriter Gilles Vigneault in 1964.

The song was written for the NFB film &quot;The Snow Has Melted on the Manicouagan (La Neige a fondu sur la Manicouagan)&quot;, directed by Arthur Lamothe. The song consists of six stanzas of lyrics about winds, cold, snow, and ice, of the solitude of wide open spaces and of the ideal of brotherhood. Its theme, &quot;&#x27;Mon pays ce n&#x27;est pas un pays, c&#x27;est l&#x27;hiver&quot;, is well-known throughout the province. As well as expressing the natural beauty and praising the special characteristics of the composer&#x27;s Quebec homeland, the song is seen by many people as declaring the free spirit of the province; Vigneault has denied that this was ever his intention; however, he has been firm that &quot;mon pays&quot; refers to Quebec and should not be associated with Canada as a whole.

Vigneault won the Prix Félix-Leclerc at the 1965 Festival du disque de Montréal for the song. Later that same year, Monique Leyrac performed it at the International Song Festival in Sopot, Poland, taking first prize with it.

In 1977, the melody from &quot;Mon Pays&quot; was reworked into the disco song &quot;From New York to L.A.&quot; recorded by Patsy Gallant. This song with English lyrics by Gene Williams unrelated to the original French, was an international hit for Gallant - Canada/ #6 Pop, #1 Adult Contemporary,/ the UK/ #6, Ireland/ #5, Australia/ #10, the Netherlands/ #15, Norway/ #7, South Africa/ #5, Sweden/ #17, - and in 1995 reached #5 in Austria via a remake credited to N.Y.L.A. featuring Stephanie McKay.

<text>Maren Jensen is an American former model and actress, best known for portraying Lieutenant Athena in the 1978–79 television series &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Jensen also made guest appearances in several US television series, such as &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;.

== Biography ==
Maren Jensen was born in Arcadia, California, and raised in Glendale. Her father Ralph Oscar Jensen was a physician, and her mother was a secretary with the Los Angeles Zoo. She is a middle child, with an older brother, Dana, and a younger sister, Kathleen. Jensen attended Herbert Hoover High School from 1971 to 1974, and after graduating received a scholarship to attend UCLA, where she majored in Theater Arts and Law. She dropped out after her third year.

== Career ==
While still in college, Jensen began a modeling career. She was featured on the covers of &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;. A mutual friend introduced her to the agent Barbara Gale, who helped arrange two network commercials and a role in &quot;The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries&quot; in 1977. From 1978 to 1979, Jensen starred in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; in the role of Lieutenant Athena. She was featured on the cover of &quot;TV Guide&quot; in April 1979. Her last known role was in Wes Craven&#x27;s 1981 horror film &quot;Deadly Blessing&quot; alongside Sharon Stone. Her career was cut short by illness, after she contracted Epstein-Barr Syndrome. In 1993, Jensen co-founded the cosmetics brand Stila with celebrity makeup artist Jeanine Lobell, which became one of the best selling makeup brands in retailers like Sephora.

Jensen was a longtime companion of singer-songwriter Don Henley. In 1982, Henley released his first solo album, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Still,&quot; and dedicated it to her. She is credited for &quot;Harmony Vocals&quot; on the song &quot;Johnny Can&#x27;t Read,&quot; and is credited in the liner notes for having composed the piano intro and interlude on the song &quot;A Month of Sundays&quot; on Henley&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;Building the Perfect Beast.&quot; She appeared in the video for Henley&#x27;s song &quot;Not Enough Love In the World&quot; in 1985. Henley and Jensen were engaged, but they separated in 1986. Jensen helped Henley establish The Walden Woods Project in the early 1990s, an organization dedicated to protecting the Walden Woods area in Concord, Massachusetts from development.

In 2020, Jensen co-founded with Laura Shoemaker the company Glow Beauty Fuel, a maker of beauty protein bars.

== Personal life ==
Jensen was reported to be married to John Kugelberg and they were also reported to be separated. They have kept everything about their relationship very private and out of the public eye, including their marriage and separation dates. Neither has shared any photos together. She has been reported as living in the New York metro area and has been visiting the Los Angeles metro area from time to time because of business, family, and friends. She has a daughter and a stepson.

<doc id="930328" wikidata="Q871683" url="?curid=930328" title="Bomberman Jetters">
<text>is a 2002 Japanese anime television series produced by NAS and TV Tokyo and animated by Studio Deen. It has also spawned two manga series and three video games, one of which was also localized and given an English dub. It is based on the popular &quot;Bomberman&quot; video game series created by Hudson Soft.

==Plot==
The Jetters are a highly trained intergalactic police force for keeping unique items safe from the Hige-Hige bandits. Mighty, an expert Bomberman and the leader of the Jetters, disappears while on a mission. Dr. Ein accepts Mighty&#x27;s younger brother, White Bomber, into the Jetters because they need a Bomberman for the team. White Bomber is clumsy and childish, but idolizes his older brother. White Bomber and the rest of the Jetters have many adventures, foiling Doctor Mechado and Mujoe&#x27;s plans to steal one-of-a-kind objects, facing off against the Hige-Hige Bandits, and returning antiques to their rightful owners.

Early episodes of &quot;Bomberman Jetters&quot; started out with the &quot;monster of the week&quot; formula, where Dr. Mechado and Mujoe would send in one of their &quot;Super Combined&quot; Bombermen one at a time to attack the Jetters.

Eventually the format shifted from light-hearted comedy &quot;monster of the week&quot; to a more dramatic, darker action story dealing with the themes of death, betrayal, and revenge, but still retaining some of the lighter aspect. Plots include characters going through trials with character development such as Shout learning the truth about her mother, how Bagular first met Mujoe, and White Bomber dealing with learning the truth of what happened to his older brother Mighty.

==Characters==
===Jetters===
: (2002-2013) Maria Naganawa, Alex Cazares (2013-present)
:A native Bomberman from Planet Bomber, White Bomber is very clumsy and quite thick. He wrecks things by accident, in contrast to his older brother Mighty. His accidents tend to make a critical situation worse, much to Shout&#x27;s frustration. He brags endlessly about any achievement, no matter how small. White Bomber may mess up sometimes but he always means well and always tries to help. He is 10 years old. White Bomber doesn&#x27;t seem to get angry at Shout, no matter how many times she yells, curses, and hits him (although this is purely out of fear of inciting Shout&#x27;s wrath even further, rather than out of affection). He joined the Jetters in episode 2, thanks to Momo&#x27;s relationship with Dr. Ein.
:
:Shout is the leader of the Jetters, who filled in for Mighty after his disappearance. She is the only female member of the Jetters. Shout picks on White Bomber, but she actually cares for him like a brother. She says that when he gets older he will lead the Jetters, just like Mighty once did. Her mother died in a space flight accident when she was an infant. Her age is unknown but she appears to be about the same age as White Bomber. In her civilian mode, she runs a ramen restaurant.
:
:A robot created by Dr. Ein. He is a unique robot that wields gizmos in his body to assist the Jetters. He hates it when Bongo modifies him, especially for cooking. He does not remember when he was created or who created him, and has a recurring dream about fighting and defeating a giant robot.
:
:A hairy, large-bodied inventor from Planet Dodonpa who helps Dr. Ein and enjoys modifying Gangu, mostly without Gangu&#x27;s permission. Like most of his species, he enjoys curry and ends his sentences with &quot;bongo.&quot; Though he doesn&#x27;t look like it, he is actually a royal prince. His full name is Sarusamanbo Kongaragaccha Bosanovavitch Bongoro Dodonpa XXXIV.
:
:An anthropomorphic bird and a personal friend of Mighty. Birdy is a competent fighter and rarely reveals his emotions, but he loses his temper easily, especially when Rui is around and White Bomber is not. As a side job, he works as a taxi driver. In episode 36 he seems to know Mama. He is mysterious and goes out by himself a lot, but none of the other Jetters knows what he does or where he goes. Birdy can fight well and can make wings come out of his back to fly, and he can throw sharp feathers.
:
:White Bomber&#x27;s older brother, known as the legendary Bomberman, who bears a striking resemblance to the original Bomberman. Mighty has a silver visor covering his right eye and wears a red cape. He has a cool and collected personality and a strong sense of justice. Mighty and White Bomber share a very close brother bond. Mighty has some of the personality traits of White Bomber. He rides a hover-bike called the Moto-Jetter. Mighty can create the Thunder Bomb. After his brief return to Planet Bomber in episode 1 to guard Cosmo Diamond, he went on another mission to planet Nonbiri. Mighty fought the Higehige forces on his own, but after the last base had been destroyed, Mighty disappeared. In Zero&#x27;s flashback, it was shown that Mighty was damaged in a gun attack by Mujoe and Zero had penetrated his wound to obtain combat data. Mighty destroyed the final base with his own attack. Mighty tried to give White Bomber his seventh Bomb Star before destroying the base, but he only possessed six Bomb Stars. The seventh Bomb Star is Mighty&#x27;s badge.
:
:A scientist who founded the Jetters. He has an annoying tendency to blow his nose on any piece of paper nearby, including letters of resignation, leading, understandably, to much confusion. He has a crush on Grandma Bomber (White Bomber and Mighty&#x27;s grandmother), and calls her &quot;Momo-chan&quot;, which makes her angry. Often regarded as a joke character, he also has a serious side. Ein tells the Jetters when there are missions.

===Hige-Hige===
:
:Bagular is the mastermind behind the Hige-Hige Gang, with the goal of collecting universally unique items. He resembles a large blue beardly old Bomberman with a letter B on his forehead and wears one gold monocle over his left eye and has a belt, gloves and a red cape. He is not actually evil, and was great friends with the Jetters&#x27; founder, Dr. Ein, but they were split by an intense rivalry for the affections of Momo. In later episodes, it is revealed that Bagular is a pawn in Dr Mechado&#x27;s sinister scheme to take over the Hige Hige Bandits. Bagular was later rescued by Mujoe in his second Schnurburt base infiltration attempt.
:
:A pawn of Bagular, Mujoe is usually in charge of commanding the Hige-Hige Gang&#x27;s troops. He resembles a pro wrestler. He has blonde hair, a blonde mustache and beard, and a strange-looking spandex suit. He wears shades and a large green cape. Mujoe used the Super Combined Bomberman Making Machine and shot at Charaboms to make Mermaid Bomber, Thunder Bomber, Fire Bomber, and Grand Bomber. Bagular found the jobless Mojoe sleeping in the streets, and decided to employ Mojoe on his quest against Dr. Ein. After the Schnurburt base had been taken over by Dr. Mechado, Jetters attempted to free Bagular by infiltrating the Schnurburt base, but the plot failed. Mujoe then attempted to sacrifice himself to take down Max, but failed. Mujoe escaped from Max&#x27;s attack by pulling an escape trigger just before the attack hits. Since then, he re-infiltrated Schnurburt base under Dr. Ein&#x27;s secret plan in episode 49, and was successful.
; / Dr. Mechard
:Mechado is the Hige-Hige Bandits&#x27; mad scientist and Bagular&#x27;s more trusted henchman. He does all the building and machinery for Bagular and the Hige-Hige Bandits. In Episode 40, Mechado turns against Bagular. Mechado and Bagular went to the same science academy back in their younger days, and Mechado blames Bagular for stealing his ideas about the bomb crystals. Bagular tries to explain that his idea was false, but Mechado refused to listen. As a result, Mechado goes into a rage, locking Bagular up in prison and taking over the Hige-Hige Bandits. Since the bomb crystals are inside Planet Bomber, his ultimate plan is to collide Planet Bomber and Planet Jetters together until both planets are destroyed. His main creation is the Super Combined Bomberman Making Machine to turn any inanimate objects or helpless Charaboms into his own Bombermen.
; / MA-10
:At first solely referred to as the infamous &quot;Space Bounty Hunter,&quot; it is later discovered that he is a creation of Mechado. He has no feelings or compassion, and will do whatever it takes to reach his goal. He uses the lightning bomb and balloon bomb, similar to the missing Mighty. Max&#x27;s body was destroyed in episode 51, but he manages to write his data into Zero before Zero begins the lethal hit, hence taking control of his body. Max&#x27;s spirit was destroyed by Shirobon&#x27;s ruse bomb, saving the fatally wounded Zero. There are five other units based on this unit. They are (MA-0), MA-3 (), MA-5 (), MA-7 () and MA-9 ()
:
:Hige-Hige Bandits are small, powerful robots. The basic members of the Hige-Hige gang equal of strength to the Bombermen. Created by Bagular, they are very powerful as individuals and even more powerful in numbers. The Hige-Hige seem to be always happy in every piece of work they are doing but still expect to be paid for it. To those outside the Hige-Hige Bandits, excluding Mujoe, it appears all they can say is &quot;Hige&quot;, but it is apparently a language in and of itself. There are three types of Hige-Hige bandits. Their uniform consists of an orange scarf, white boots and gloves, and black full body armor. The programming of Hige-Hige units are stored inside disks that are loaded into the disk drives in their heads.
:
:A Xenomorph-like bartender working in the Hige-Hige headquarters who debuted in episode 5. Mujoe shows great affection for Mama. She is also well liked by the Hige-Hige. In episode 40 she is held at the base, but still works as a bartender. Later she was rescued by Mujoe.

===Combination bombers===
:
:A bomber created in episode 3 when the combined bomber machine was tested on a bat. Has bat wings and a pig nose. His special bomb is the bat bomb, which flies around before releasing a swarm of bats. He reappeared to compete in the B-1 Grand Prix, but was defeated by Pretty Bomber in 1st round.
:
:A seagull bomber that appeared in episode 9 in search of a unique item. Under the orders of Mujoe, it attacks by firing missiles, but was destroyed by Max&#x27;s lightning bomb. It reappeared to compete in the B-1 Grand Prix and was able to win first round. It lost in the second round when the referee declared it was absent, even though it was on the battlefield.
:
:A female bomber created in episode 4, capable of making ultrasound bombs and toss back bombs thrown by opponents. She has an uncontrollable urge to jump through hoops. She wears a swim ring with a skirt underneath, a seashell bra, and lipstick. She was destroyed by Shirobon&#x27;s bomb when Dolphin Bomber tries to jump through a hoop created by modifying Gangu; she was turned back into a normal dolphin. She reappeared to compete in the B-1 Grand Prix, but lost in the first round when the pool where Dolphin Bomber is in dried up.
:
:A bomber created in episode 8 in the ice comet. He does not throw bombs, but attacks with his claws. After it was tossed in the air by Bongo with a bear trap made from Gangu, it was destroyed by Shirobon&#x27;s bomb. He reappeared to compete in the B-1 Grand Prix, but was defeated by Bomber Kid.
:
:A spinning top bomber created in episode 5 to help Mujoe to dig tunnels, but it is incapable of digging tunnels. It can create spinning top bombs, but it prefers to play tricks with the bombs than to use them as weapons. It was destroyed by Shirobon&#x27;s bomb after Shout trapped it in elevator. It reappeared to compete in the B-1 Grand Prix, but when it fought against Hige-hige unit #156 in the first round, it lost.
:
:It was created by combining Mechado with the four Proto-Max units in episode 50. Although his name is &quot;Dark Force Bomber&quot;, he looks angelic in appearance. His attack is the Dark Force Bomb. Dark Force Bomber was defeated by Shirobon&#x27;s newest attack in episode 51, and was returned into the four Proto-Max units and Mechado. In the videogame, he was created by the combined powers of the Bomber Shitennou, and he had more attacks.

===Bomber Shitennou===
:
:A flame-wielding Bomber who was the first Bomber Shitennou seen in action; Flame Bomber defeated White Bomber. He is very childish and doesn&#x27;t take his work very seriously. He was overpowered and defeated by White Bomber&#x27;s new flame-based bomb star. After he was defeated in episode 16, he returned into three Pteragodon. As well as possessing Pyrokinesis, he can produce and wield his signature &quot;Flame Fire&quot; Bombs. His Battlefield is an ancient Chinese temple courtyard.
:
:A female water-wielding Bomber who took over the job of the beaten Flame Bomber in episode 17. During her encounter with the Jetters, she fell in love with Birdy, but her plans were foiled by Shirobon. She is proud and arrogant, and tends to act more like a spoiled little girl, using her looks on Mujoe to get what she wants. She likes to do things her way, or not at all. When Mermaid Bomber was defeated after being electrocuted by Shirobon&#x27;s Sunrise Thunder Bomb in episode 18, she turned into three Triple Shells. She can produce and use her signature &quot;Splash Water&quot; Bombs. Her Battlefield is a large floating oasis.
:
:A strong and kind Bomber Shitennou. He is a very honourable person, and sometimes not sure whether he is fighting for good or evil. He befriends Shirobon, not knowing he is a Jetter. When faced with destroying Shirobon, he cannot bring himself to do it, and convinces White Bomber to destroy him instead. As well as being able to roll at high speeds and fire off the spikes on his body to attack foes, he can produce and wield the Clay Bombs and Brick Bombs. His Battlefield is a farm, but in the video game it was an underground arena with a design similar to the traditional Bomberman maze.
:
:The last and most powerful of the Bomber Shitennou. Aside from being able to use his signature &quot;Thunder Bombs&quot; and &quot;Flash Thunderbolt Bombs&quot;, he has mastery over a wide variety of electrical attacks. Incredibly loyal to Mujoe, he respects his elders and superiors; he wants to expose those who are framing Mujoe at all costs. Because of this, he has an intense rivalry with Max, as he believes that he is plotting to overthrow Mujoe. He is defeated by Max&#x27;s signature attack, Hyper Plasma Bomb. His battlefield is never seen in the anime (Mechado interrupted him when he was about to summon it), but in the video game, his battlefield is a floating arena surrounded by an electric fence.

<text>Tabor Academy is an independent preparatory school located in Marion, Massachusetts, United States. Tabor is known for its marine science courses. Tabor&#x27;s location on Sippican Harbor, Buzzards Bay, has earned it the name of &quot;The School by the Sea&quot; and the school continues to operate a 115-foot sail training vessel, the SSV Tabor Boy as a hallmark program of the school. Tabor participates in the Independent School League (ISL) and is a member of the New England Preparatory School Athletic Council

==History==
===Taber&#x27;s vision===
Tabor Academy was founded in 1876 as a school for children from Marion, Massachusetts, by a bequest in the will of Elizabeth Sprague (Pitcher) Taber, a wealthy widow and benefactress of the town. Article 27 of her will stated, &quot;I have lately caused to be erected on a lot owned by me in Marion Lower Village, a building ... to be known as &#x27;The Tabor Academy&#x27;.&quot; She named the school after Mount Tabor, a mountain of biblical importance near the Sea of Galilee. From its creation, the academy was co-educational just as Mrs. Taber had intended, established &quot;to provide better and more complete facilities than had heretofore existed or were likely to exist for thorough education in the higher branches of English knowledge&quot;.

The first headmaster was Clark Phelps Howland of Yale University, who reported in 1884 that &quot;It is the aim of the school to give thorough instruction, and to encourage in its pupils a desire for the real rather than the showy, and to develop the moral as well as the intellectual element.&quot; The initial tuition fee for the Academy was $24, or $300 for students who wished to board in the headmaster&#x27;s home. While Elizabeth Taber did not stipulate any particular religious affiliation for the academy, Howland claimed that Tabor &quot;will probably always be under the management of those who sympathize with the Congregational faith.&quot; Howland was succeeded by Dana Marsh Dustan, Dartmouth B.A. 1880, A.M. 1883 (1893–1901), Nathan Chipman Hamblin, Harvard B.A. 1892 (1901–1910) and Charles Edward Pethybridge, Amherst B.A. 1906 (1910–1916).

===Lillard years===

Tabor was reorganized in 1916 as an independent secondary school for boys under the tenure of headmaster Walter Huston Lillard, who came to Tabor from Phillips Academy and was educated himself at Dartmouth College and Oxford University, is responsible for creating the first long-range vision for the future of the Academy: one that excluded girls.

Lillard turned Tabor into an all-boys&#x27; school and cancelled plans to make the Academy the town of Marion&#x27;s school and vowed to keep it a privately endowed and operated institution. In the 1930s, Lillard orchestrated a trade with the town of Marion. The original Academy buildings were deeded to the town (now the Elizabeth Taber Library and Marion Town Hall) and were traded for the current waterfront location in order to allow the academy to expand and grow. He acquired the surrounding cottages and plots of land in order to secure the academy&#x27;s future expansion&#x27; the area had increased ten-fold by the end of his tenure in 1942. Among other contributions to the school was his design of the current seal of the school, which shows a full-rigged ship and the motto &quot;All-a-taut-o&quot;. He selected the seal as an image to students to &quot;sail towards broader horizons&quot; and the motto because of its nautical meaning as the state of a vessel when everything is shipshape and accounted for.

Lillard was responsible for the creation of the International Schoolboy Fellowship in 1927, the first established international student exchange program for American schoolboys. He was chairman of the program which he formed in conjunction with headmasters from schools in England, France and Germany and eventually invited fifteen other New England prep schools to join as well. He took all boys who &quot;made good&quot; during the academic year on the annual cruise to France to partake in the exchange and brought English schoolboys to study at the Academy during the year. Lillard believed that &quot;One American boy in a French community for a summer brings home a new understanding of French tradition and ideals, which he communicates to his schoolfellows. Friendship and tolerance are bred by intimacy, we cannot begin too young.&quot; After his years at Tabor, Walter &quot;Cappy&quot; Lillard went on to work for the United Nations in Vienna as the Chief of the Resettlement Division of the International Refugee Organization.

===Recent years===

The school was, until the late 1940s, a maritime school where uniformed boys performed morning and evening drill as well as pursuing a classical academic curriculum. When it returned to its original ideals as a rigorous, college preparatory boarding and day school, it still retained its status as a Naval Honor School. It was designated a Naval Honor School in 1941 by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox, and remains only one of two secondary schools which still hold the distinction.

The headmasters who followed Lillard and continued his vision of expansion and growth were James W. Wickenden (1942–1976), Peter M. Webster B.A. Texas M.A.T. Yale (1976–1989) and Jay S. Stroud B.A. Carleton College, M.A. Dartmouth College, Ed.M Columbia University (1989–2012). In 2002, Stroud commented on the experience of living and learning at Tabor, &quot;Our unparalleled location on the edge of the sea creates our metaphor for education. While some of our students literally study marine biology or celestial navigation, sail boats both large and small, row crew shells or swim off Tabor&#x27;s docks, all our students undertake voyages of the mind and spirit. Tabor reminds us all that daily life is about the largest visions possible. It is about widening the horizon, redefining the possible, developing the courage to undertake great voyages. All of us who live here are fortunate to have both the joy and the possibility of adventure in the tides that rise at our front door every morning. It is the right place for a school.&quot; Stroud retired after the class of 2012. John Quirk was selected by the Board of Trustees to be the headmaster following Stroud&#x27;s retirement. After a drunk driving incident in early 2020, Quirk was placed on leave until the school selected Julie Salit as interim head of school. 

In December of 2020, Anthony Jaccaci was announced as the new head of school. 2023 saw the opening of a new campus center and library dedicated to Travis Roy, as well as an additional logo. The legacy seal that includes a square-rigged ship symbolic of the school&#x27;s rich nautical history remains in use. 

==Athletics==
Tabor Academy fields 55 different teams in 23 interscholastic sports and another 15 instructional programs. The school has the Fish health and athletic center, which includes an indoor hockey rink, fitness center, weight room, wrestling room, eight squash courts, field house, basketball gymnasium, football field, four basketball courts, student lounge and grill, athletic offices, a resident athletic trainer, locker rooms, team rooms and an attached health center and infirmary. Tabor also has the waterfront on Sippican Harbor in Marion for swimming in the spring and summer months, and is used for the training of the sailing and rowing teams.

===Rowing===
In 1919, Tabor was one of the first American prep schools to formally establish a rowing program. The strong rowing history at Tabor dates back almost a century. Both the men&#x27;s and the women&#x27;s teams have been active participants in the Henley Royal Regatta in Henley-on-Thames, UK. The men won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup in 1965, the Thames Challenge Cup in 1936, 1937 and 1939 and have made it to the finals in both numerous times. In 1939, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported on Tabor&#x27;s dominance on the international level, stating that &quot;It is almost a maxim nowadays that either Tabor Academy or Kent School will win the Thames Challenge Cup race for eight-oared crews.&quot; In August 1938, Tabor&#x27;s status as an international power in schoolboy rowing was confirmed by its participation in one of the first recorded international schoolboy competitions on American waters when a crew of Radley College oarsmen traveled across the Atlantic via the Cunard Line RMS &quot;Aquitania&quot; to race the Tabor Academy crew on Sippican Harbor in Marion.

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s Tabor competed regionally against rival prep schools, with its strongest rival being Kent School, faced in numerous Henley finals and American championship regattas. During this period, in order to seek out a higher level of competition, Tabor raced against crews from Harvard University, Yale University and M.I.T. The relationship between Tabor and Harvard can be traced back to 1931 when Tabor traveled to England with the Harvard crew to race at Henley and used one of the Crimson&#x27;s shells in competition.

In 1967, the Tabor oarsmen were poised to win their second Henley victory in three years. Rowing hard races until the finals they faced a well-rested Eton College crew and lost by ¾ of one boat length. Another famous race was the 1947 Thames Challenge Cup final at Henley. Coming after the destruction of World War II, many of the British crews did not have sufficient food after war rationing. Tabor thought the honorable decision was to train under the same caloric restrictions as the British crews. They still managed to reach the finals where they lost to traditional rival Kent School, who brought along their own provisions from the US, but won wide support from the British fans and press for their sportsmanship.

Tabor is one of eleven schools to have a guest room at the famed Leander Club, in Henley-on-Thames. Each room is named after, and designed in the colors of and features various memorabilia from a historically significant rowing school or university. Among the other schools with rooms at Leander are Harvard, Yale, Brown, Oxford, Cambridge and Kent. In recent years, Tabor has continued to win NEIRA championships, win invitations to the USRowing Youth National Championships and travel to England to race at the Henley Royal Regatta on a regular basis.

<text>Ann Elizabeth Packer (born 8 March 1942) is an English former sprinter, hurdler and long jumper. She won a gold medal in the 800 metres and a silver in the 400 metres at the 1964 Summer Olympics.

== Biography ==
In 1959 Packer won the English Schools 100 yards title. Next year she competed internationally in the long jump. She attended Didcot Girls&#x27; Grammar School (now Didcot Girls&#x27; School).

In 1962, she reached the finals in the 200 metres at the European Championships and in the 80 metres hurdles at the Commonwealth Games; she was also part of the 4 × 110 yards relay team that won two medals at these competitions. In 1963 she focused on the 400 metres, and already by her fourth 400m race ran a world-level time of 53.6 seconds.

Packer became the national 440 yards champion after winning the British WAAA Championships title at the 1964 WAAA Championships.

When she was selected for the 1964 British Olympic team Packer worked as a physical education teacher at Coombe County Girls&#x27; School, New Malden, Surrey. At the Olympics she shared a room with long jump gold medallist Mary Rand. Packer was hoping to win the 400 metres, but was beaten into second place by Betty Cuthbert of Australia, despite setting a new European record at 52.20 seconds. Disappointed, Packer planned to skip the 800m event and have a shopping trip instead, until her fiancé, Robbie Brightwell persuaded her to compete. Before the Olympics, Packer only had five domestic 800m races; she had taken up a longer distance to improve her stamina, and earned the third British spot at the last minute.

In her heat and semi-final Packer finished fifth and third, running 2:12.6 and 2:06.0 respectively, being beaten by French runner Maryvonne Dupureur, clocking 2:04.5 and 2:04.1. She thus started the final the second slowest of the eight contestants, having raced at the distance only seven times before. Packer was sixth at 400 m, lying behind Dupureur. She began her sprint to the finish with about 150 m to go, moved up to third at 100 m and took the lead in the final straight, using her sprinting speed to take the gold. She broke the world record with a time of 2:01.1 minutes. Commenting on her win, Packer said &quot;Middle-distance running for women was still in its infancy and the 800 m had only been run in Rome four years earlier for the first time. I knew nothing about the event but being so naive was probably to my advantage; it meant I did not have any limitations in my head regarding what I should or could do. Ignorance proved to be bliss.&quot; Packer&#x27;s winning performance is featured in &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot;, the official documentary of the games directed by Kon Ichikawa.

After winning the gold medal, she announced her retirement at the age of 22 and so had one of the shortest athletics careers of any Olympic gold medallist. It would be another forty years before another British woman, Kelly Holmes, would win the 800 m, despite British men being successful at the distance.

Later in the same Games, Robbie Brightwell won a silver medal in the 4 x 400 m relay. They later married and had three sons, Gary, a 400 m runner like his mother, and Ian and David, the latter two becoming footballers with Manchester City. She and Brightwell were each appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 1965 New Year Honours for services to athletics. In 2011 Brightwell published a book detailing their careers: &quot;Robbie Brightwell and his Golden Girl: The Posh and Becks of Yesteryear&quot;. Packer now lives in Congleton in Cheshire. She was widowed following Robbie&#x27;s death in March 2022.

In 2009, Packer was inducted into the England Athletics Hall of Fame. Ann was coached by Denis Watts and was a member of Reading Athletic Club when she was selected for the British Olympic team.

In 1966 Packer appeared in an experiment for the BBC TV history programme, &quot;Chronicle&quot; to see how far geese could walk in a day. She was chosen because however far the geese went, she would still be with them at the end.

Packer&#x27;s 800m gold medal win at the Tokyo 1964 Summer Olympics is dramatically captured in the stunning documentary film &quot;Tokyo Olympiad&quot; (1965) directed by Kon Ichikawa. The race (and Packer celebrating with friends and loved ones after winning) is shown in its entirety starting at minute 59:30 of the film.

Athletic personal bests: 100y 10.9 (1963), 10.8w (1960); 100m 11.7w, 12.0 (1960), 200m 23.7 (1964), 400m 52.20 (1964), 800m 2:01.1 (1964), 80mh 11.4 (1960), HJ 1.60 (1959), LJ 5.92 (1960), Pen 4294 (old tables) (1963).

==Honours==
During the celebrations marking 750 years of Congleton&#x27;s charter in 2022, a postbox in Congleton was painted gold by Royal Mail in Packer&#x27;s honour.

In 2023 a meeting room at the reopened Congleton leisure centre was named the &quot;Brightwell suite&quot; in honour of Ann and her late husband Robbie Brightwell.

<text>, formerly Japan Credit Bureau, is a credit card company based in Tokyo, Japan.

== History ==
Japan Credit Bureau was founded in 1961 by Sanwa Bank (now MUFG Bank) and Nippon Shinpan (now Mitsubishi UFJ NICOS), as the country&#x27;s second credit card issuer and payment network after the Japanese branch of Diners Club International. JCB firmly established itself in the Japanese credit card market after purchasing, and then absorbing, Hokkaido Credit Bureau and Osaka Credit Bureau in 1968. its cards are issued to 130 million customers in 23 countries. JCB also operates a network of membership airport lounges for holders of their Platinum Cards issued outside Japan.

JCB cards are issued in 24 countries. In most of these, JCB is affiliated with financial institutions to issue JCB-branded cards.

In the United States, JCB is not a primary credit card network such as Visa or MasterCard. While the brand was primarily accepted by tourism-related businesses such as airlines and car rental companies, it gained wider acceptance in 2006 when JCB announced an alliance with Discover Network. The two companies signed a long-term agreement that led to the acceptance of Discover Network brand cards at JCB point-of-sale terminals in Japan and of JCB cards on the Discover network in the U.S. This partnership became operational in 2011.

Local JCB accounts in the United States were issued by JCB USA, and offered to residents of California, Connecticut, Illinois, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. JCB USA stopped issuing JCB cards in the American market on January 8, 2018, and closed all current consumer credit card accounts on April 30, 2018. Foreign JCB cards continue to work through the Discover network partnership.

<doc id="930369" wikidata="Q1908130" url="?curid=930369" title="Match of the Day">
<text>Match of the Day (abbreviated to MOTD) is a football highlights programme, typically broadcast on BBC One on Saturday nights, during the Premier League season. The current presenter is former England international striker Gary Lineker with analysis from Danny Murphy, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer, among others.

&quot;Match of the Day&quot; is one of the BBC&#x27;s longest-running shows, having been on air since 22 August 1964. In 2015, &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; recognised it &quot;as the longest-running football television programme in the world.&quot; The show&#x27;s theme tune was voted the most recognised television theme in a 2010 poll conducted by the PRS. From the 2004–05 season, a second programme, &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, usually airs on the following Sunday and features highlights of all the day&#x27;s games, whilst showing the goals from the previous days&#x27; action.

== History ==

=== 1960s ===
Although the title was first used by the BBC for its Wimbledon tennis highlights programme in June 1964, the first football-related edition of &quot;Match of the Day&quot; was screened on BBC2 on 22 August 1964, and showed highlights of a game between Liverpool and Arsenal at Anfield. The programme&#x27;s audience was estimated at only 20,000, less than half of the attendance at the ground.

&quot;Match of the Day&quot; was not universally welcomed in the football world; in 1965 several clubs attempted to block a renewed deal with the BBC in fear of a drop in gate attendances at matches. Eventually, a compromise was reached where the BBC agreed not to reveal which match was to be shown until after the day&#x27;s play had concluded. Following the success of the England team at the 1966 FIFA World Cup, the programme was moved from BBC2 to BBC1 for the start of the 1966–1967 season. The first colour edition was shown on 2 November 1968, when the programme moved back to BBC2 for one week, and a game between Chelsea and Manchester City was featured (BBC 2 was transmitted on 625 lines capable of showing colour). Two other First Division games from the 1968-69 season were also broadcast on BBC2 in colour. The first colour edition of &quot;Match of the Day&quot; on BBC1 was shown on 15 November 1969, where it featured a game between Liverpool and West Ham United.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
Slow motion replays were first introduced in 1969. At the end of the decade the BBC lost a significant share of matches, with a new four-year deal in 1979 splitting the rights between the BBC and ITV (ITV had originally won exclusive rights, but a ruling from the Office of Fair Trading ordered that the rights be split). &quot;Match of the Day&quot; was moved to Sunday afternoons for the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.

In 1983, the programme reverted to being shown on Saturday night, although that year four broadcasts were lost due to industrial action. The season 1983–84 also saw the first &quot;Match of the Day Live&quot; broadcasts of First Division matches, beginning with Manchester United vs Tottenham Hotspur on 16 December – a Friday evening fixture. This came some two months after the start of ITV&#x27;s &quot;Big Match Live&quot;.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
League football highlights were not available to the BBC from 1988 as ITV had exclusive rights, though the programme remained on air for the FA Cup as &quot;Match of the Day: The Road to Wembley&quot;. League football returned in 1992, for the start of the Premier League era. Sky&#x27;s emergence made the TV rights market more competitive, with the BBC losing European Cup matches after UEFA&#x27;s revamping as the Champions League in 1992, although it did broadcast the 1994 final between A.C. Milan and FC Barcelona. In 1997, the BBC lost all live rights to the FA Cup meaning the programme&#x27;s live coverage was restricted to the UEFA Cup and Cup Winners&#x27; Cup matches, the latter competition becoming defunct in 1999. The BBC were still able to show Saturday evening highlights of FA Cup games. A significant change occurred in 2001 when the Premier League awarded highlights rights to ITV in a three-year contract. Between 2001 and 2004, the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; brand was used for the BBC&#x27;s live football coverage and the network had earned some consolation in losing by managing to regain live terrestrial coverage of the FA Cup and England internationals for that period.

Rights for UEFA Champions League qualifiers, which are held by the home team and fall outside the rights for the competition proper, were obtained on an ad hoc basis for English teams in this period, which is currently the case for the BBC with Scottish and Northern Irish teams. Both legs of Manchester United&#x27;s 2002–03 third round qualifying matches against Zalaegerszeg were shown live on the BBC.

From the 2004–05 season, Premier League highlights returned to the BBC in a revived &quot;MOTD&quot;. In addition, &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; was launched, which showed highlights of the increasing number of Sunday fixtures, and was initially presented by Adrian Chiles. The BBC&#x27;s broadcasting rights were renewed in 2009, allowing them to continue showing &quot;Match of the Day&quot; until 2013.

=== 2010s ===
From the 2011–12 season, a web-only &quot;Match of the Day 3&quot; programme was launched on Monday mornings as a light-hearted addition to &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;. Although broadcast as a separate programme, it is recorded immediately following the conclusion of &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; on Sunday night. In November 2011, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; moved from London to a brand new studio in Dock10, MediaCityUK as part of BBC Sport&#x27;s relocation north, this allowed the programme to be recorded in high-definition. At the start of 2012–13 season &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; moved to BBC One.

Upon regaining the FA Cup rights in 2014, highlights from the early and later rounds of the competition were given their own separate programme instead of being broadcast on an extended &quot;Match of the Day&quot; straight after the Premier League highlights, as it was before the BBC last lost the rights in 2008. Highlights of the latter rounds occasionally sequence from the Premier League highlights, as they did until the previous decade, but both segments are considered separate programmes.

In January 2018, the Premier League awarded the UK highlights to BBC Sport. The rights cost £211.5 million and were to cover three seasons from 2019–20. The January 2018 agreement also includes &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day 2 Extra&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day Kickabout&quot;, &quot;Football Focus&quot;, &quot;Final Score&quot; and &quot;The Premier League Show&quot;.

=== 2020s ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic and the postponement of the 2019–20 Premier League season, &quot;Match of the Day&quot; split into a televised podcast called &quot;Match of the Day: Top 10 Podcast&quot; in which Gary Lineker and the pundits discussed and ranked certain roles from the start of the Premier League in 1992 (such as Top 10 Goalkeepers) and &quot;Match of their Day&quot; which featured a pundit picking three of their favourite Premier League matches. Upon its resumption, the BBC broadcast four games live. Bournemouth versus Crystal Palace became the first Premier League game shown live on one of the five main terrestrial channels, and the BBC&#x27;s first live top-flight English football match since 1987–88. A further eight games were shown live during the 2020–21 season.

In July 2022, the BBC acquired the rights to show highlights of the men&#x27;s UEFA Champions League on television, iPlayer and digitally from the 2024-25 to 2027-28 seasons. As part of this, on 21 August 2024, the first episode of &quot;MOTD: UEFA Champions League&quot; aired on BBC One.

In March 2023, Lineker was suspended following political controversy over a tweet he had made criticising UK government policy, which the BBC argued breached guidelines over social media use by employees and freelancers. Several presenters, pundits and commentators, including Alex Scott, Ian Wright and Alan Shearer, refused to participate in the BBC&#x27;s football output, while some football clubs announced their refusal to conduct BBC interviews. Radio and television programming across BBC Sport&#x27;s football division was severely disrupted on 11 March, while BBC director general Tim Davie apologised to viewers for the disruption. Both &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, presented the following day, followed a shortened format with no studio presentation, punditry, or interviews. On 13 March, Lineker was reinstated as host of &quot;Match of the Day&quot; and the BBC began a review of its social media guidelines.

At the end of 2023, the BBC and Premier League agreed on a deal whereby Premier League highlights will be shown on &quot;Match Of The Day&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; and &quot;Football Focus&quot; up to and including the 2028–29 season. The deal also includes a significant increase in the amount of digital content that can be used across BBC Sport platforms.

== Studio ==
The programme was broadcast from TC5 at BBC Television Centre from 1964–2012.

Ahead of the 2019–20 Premier League season, BBC Sport upgraded the studio that &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, &quot;Football Focus&quot; and &quot;Final Score&quot; broadcasts from.

Filming is located at the Dock10 studios at MediaCityUK in Salford.

==Presenters, analysts and commentators==
===Presenters===
Despite the programme&#x27;s long running status there have been only five regular main presenters: Kenneth Wolstenholme (1964–1967), David Coleman (1967–1973), Jimmy Hill (1973–1988), Des Lynam (1988–1999) and Gary Lineker (1999–2025). Lineker had worked as an analyst during his predecessor Des Lynam&#x27;s tenure.

In 2005, Celina Hinchcliffe became the first woman to present on the programme.

In November 2024, Gary Lineker announced that he would be departing the show at the end of the season.

In January 2025, the BBC announced that Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan would share the presenting of &quot;Match of the Day&quot;, &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot; and &quot;Match of the Day: Champions League&quot; following Lineker&#x27;s departure.

===Analysts===
Among the analysts featured during the 2024–25 season are Danny Murphy, Micah Richards and Alan Shearer.

Previous &quot;Match of the Day&quot; analysts include Alan Hansen, Mark Lawrenson and Ian Wright.

===Commentators===
&quot;Match of the Day&quot; uses a selection of BBC and freelance commentators, including: Guy Mowbray, Steve Wilson, Jonathan Pearce, Steve Bower, Simon Brotherton, Conor McNamara, Vicki Sparks, Alistair Mann, Martin Fisher, Mark Scott, John Roder, Chris Wise, Robyn Cowen, Steven Wyeth, Tom Gayle and Ben Andrews.

In 2007, Jacqui Oatley became the first woman to commentate on the programme.

Previous commentators have included Walley Barnes, Frank Bough, David Coleman, Jon Champion, Barry Davies, Tony Gubba, Stuart Hall, John Motson, Alan Parry, Idwal Robling, Gerald Sinstadt, Clive Tyldesley, Alan Weeks and Kenneth Wolstenholme. As part of the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary celebrations, Barry Davies returned to commentate.

==Theme music==
The current theme tune for the series is titled &quot;Match of the Day&quot;. It was composed for the programme in 1970 by Barry Stoller, and was used for the first time on 15 August 1970.

Stoller&#x27;s brief was simply to write &quot;something good&quot;; the short closing fanfare occurred to him first. &quot;Those fanfare harmonies give the music a gladiator feel,&quot; he wrote in 2014, &quot;akin to entering the ancient games arena in Rome with all its expectations.&quot; The tune was recorded by him, a trumpeter and a drummer (Stuart Vincent) in the basement recording studio of his home. In May 2010, PRS for Music revealed that the &quot;Match of the Day&quot; theme tune is the most recognisable in the UK.

The theme is often incorrectly labelled &quot;Off Side&quot;, the group name used by musician Mike Vickers, for an alternative 1970 version of Stoller&#x27;s tune, which was released as a 45 rpm gramophone single on the Pye label (7N 25534),

The original theme tune, entitled &quot;Drum Majorette&quot;, was written by Major Leslie Statham, a former band member of the Welsh Guards under the pen-name Arnold Steck.

<text>Sinfonia (; plural &quot;sinfonie&quot;) is the Italian word for symphony, from the Latin &quot;symphonia&quot;, in turn derived from Ancient Greek συμφωνία &quot;symphōnia&quot; (agreement or concord of sound), from the prefix σύν (together) and Φωνή (sound). In English it most commonly refers to a 17th- or 18th-century orchestral piece used as an introduction, interlude, or postlude to an opera, oratorio, cantata, or suite (, who gives the origin of the word as Italian) . The word is also found in other Romance languages such as Spanish or Portuguese.

In the Middle Ages down to as late as 1588, it was also the Italian name for the hurdy-gurdy . Johann Sebastian Bach used the term for his keyboard compositions also known as &quot;Three-part Inventions&quot;, and after about 1800, the term, when in reference to opera, meant &quot;Overture&quot; .

In George Frideric Handel&#x27;s oratorio Messiah (HWV 56), &quot;Overture to the Messiah&quot; (French Overture in E minor) was originally titled &quot;Sinfony&quot;.

In the 20th and 21st centuries it is found in the names of some chamber orchestras, such as the Northern Sinfonia .

==Sinfonias in the vocal works by Johann Sebastian Bach==
The opening movements of cantatas BWV 31 and BWV 182 are named &quot;sonata&quot; and the first movement of cantata BWV 106 &quot;sonatina&quot;. Sinfonia in D major, BWV 1045 is considered a sinfonia of a lost cantata, because its manuscript indicates that the piece had four vocal parts.

==Symphony with an alternative scope==

Examples of such &quot;sinfonias&quot; composed after the classical era include:
*Vincent d&#x27;Indy wrote a &quot;Sinfonia brevis de bello Gallico&quot;, Latin for: &quot;Short Symphony about the War in Gaul&quot;.
* Igor Stravinsky titled the first movement of his 1923 Octet &quot;Sinfonia&quot;.
* Benjamin Britten&#x27;s 1940 &quot;Sinfonia da Requiem&quot;

*Sinfonia concertante
*Sinfonietta (symphony)

<text>The consistent life ethic (CLE), also known as the consistent ethic of life or whole life ethic, is an ideology that opposes abortion, capital punishment, assisted suicide, and euthanasia. Adherents oppose war, or at the very least unjust war; some adherents go as far as full pacifism and so oppose all war. Many authors have understood the ethic to be relevant to a broad variety of areas of public policy as well as social justice issues. The term was popularized in 1983 by the Catholic prelate Joseph Bernardin in the United States to express an ideology based on the premise that all human life is sacred and should be protected by law. While there are many adherents, CLE is not exclusively but primarily a Catholic doctrine and/or associated with the Catholic Church.

==History==
The phrase &quot;consistent ethic of life&quot; was used as far back as a 1971 speech delivered by then-Archbishop Humberto Medeiros of Boston.

===Eileen Egan===
In 1971, the Catholic pacifist Eileen Egan coined the phrase &quot;seamless garment&quot; to describe a holistic reverence for life. The phrase is a Bible reference from John 19:23 to the seamless robe of Jesus, which his executioners left whole rather than dividing it at his execution. The seamless garment philosophy holds that issues such as abortion, capital punishment, militarism, euthanasia, social injustice, and economic injustice all demand a consistent application of moral principles valuing the sanctity of human life. &quot;The protection of life&quot;, said Egan, &quot;is a seamless garment. You can&#x27;t protect some life and not others.&quot; Her words were meant to challenge members of society who divided their commitment to protecting and cherishing human life, choosing anti-war stances but not anti-abortion work, or those members of the anti-abortion movement who were in favor of capital punishment.

===J. Bryan Hehir===
J. Bryan Hehir, staff writer for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops on political affairs, is credited by Charles Curran with coining the term &quot;consistent ethic of life&quot;

===Cardinal Joseph Bernardin===
Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago helped publicize the consistent life ethic idea, initially in a lecture at Fordham University, December 6, 1983. At first Bernardin spoke out against nuclear war and abortion. However, he quickly expanded the scope of his view to include all aspects of human life. In that Fordham University lecture, Bernardin said: &quot;The spectrum of life cuts across the issues of genetics, abortion, capital punishment, modern warfare and the care of the terminally ill.&quot; Bernardin said that although each of the issues was distinct, nevertheless the issues were linked since the valuing and defending of (human) life were, he believed, at the center of both issues. Bernardin told an audience in Portland, Oregon: &quot;When human life is considered &#x27;cheap&#x27; or easily expendable in one area, eventually nothing is held as sacred and all lives are in jeopardy.&quot;

Bernardin drew his stance from New Testament principles, specifically of forgiveness and reconciliation, yet he argued that neither the themes nor the content generated from those themes were exclusively Christian. By doing this, Bernardin attempted to create a dialogue with others who were not necessarily aligned with Christianity.

Bernardin and other advocates of this ethic sought to form a consistent policy that would link abortion, capital punishment, economic injustice, euthanasia, and unjust war. Bernardin sought to unify conservative Catholics (who opposed abortion) and liberal Catholics (who opposed capital punishment) in the United States. By relying on fundamental principles, Bernardin also sought to coordinate work on several different spheres of Catholic moral theology. In addition, Bernardin argued that since the 1950s the church had moved against its own historical, casuistic exceptions to the protection of life. &quot;To summarize the shift succinctly, the presumption against taking human life has been strengthened and the exceptions made ever more restrictive.&quot;

===Growth and present-day activity===
The non-profit organization Consistent Life Network, founded in 1987 as the Seamless Garment Network, promotes adherence to the ethic through education and non-violent action. Individual endorsers belonging to the organization include Father Daniel Berrigan, theologian Harvey Cox, &quot;Village Voice&quot; columnist Nat Hentoff, Father Theodore Hesburgh, actress Patricia Heaton, &quot;L&#x27;Arche&quot; founder Jean Vanier, death penalty activist Sister Helen Prejean, pastor and activist Patrick Mahoney, author Ken Kesey, Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams and Nobel Peace Prize laureates Mairead Corrigan Maguire and Adolfo Pérez Esquivel. Rachel MacNair, for ten years (1994–2004) President of Feminists for Life, an anti-abortion organization, is the director of the Institute for Integrated Social Analysis, the research arm of Consistent Life Network.

The Network also consists of member groups such as Rehumanize International, created under the name Life Matters Journal by Aimee Murphy in 2011. Secular Pro-Life, Democrats for Life of America, the Pro-Life Alliance of Gays and Lesbians (PLAGAL), and All Our Lives (a pro-contraception feminist group), New Wave Feminists (led by Destiny Herndon-De La Rosa), and the American Solidarity Party, a Christian Democratic political party, are all additional members. These organizations collaborate with Consistent Life Network for activism and volunteer outreach efforts.

Along with the American Solidarity Party, the Prohibition Party, a minor political party in the United States, endorses a consistent life ethic.

The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops promotes the culture of life, which their endorsers also claim to mean the consistent ethic of life, through publications, volunteer efforts, and declarations. Several Catholic dioceses have groups created with the aim of promoting the consistent life ethic in their communities and putting it into practice. The Catholic Worker Movement, established by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin, is an organization primarily aimed towards grassroots organization and volunteer work to serve the poor, marginalized, and those facing unexpected pregnancies.

Other prominent authors who have written in support of the consistent life ethic include Frank Pavone, John Dear, Ron Sider, James Hedges, Tony Campolo, Joel Hunter, Wendell Berry, and Shane Claiborne.

==Views==
===Abortion===

Bernardin considered opposition to abortion to be an integral part of the consistent life ethic. In a 1988 interview with National Catholic Register, he stated, &quot;I feel very, very strongly about the right to life of the unborn, the weakest and most vulnerable of human beings. I don’t see how you can subscribe to the consistent ethic and then vote for someone who feels that abortion is a &#x27;basic right&#x27; of the individual. The consequence of that position would be an absence of legal protection for the unborn.&quot;

Many consistent life ethic adherents advocate for increased social support for parents in addition to legal protection for the unborn.

Advocates for the consistent life ethic have reacted positively to the release of the landmark &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; decision (2022), which overruled both &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973) and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992). According to Herb Geraghty of Rehumanize International, &quot;Right now is clearly a moment for celebration, and for mourning the lives that have been lost in the last 50 years due to the &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; decision.&quot;

===Capital punishment===

In a 1977 statement following the &quot;Gregg v. Georgia&quot; decision—which reaffirmed the United States Supreme Court&#x27;s acceptance of the use of the death penalty in the United States—Bernardin wrote, &quot;Many have expressed the view [...] that in this day of increasing violence and disregard for human life, a return to the use of capital punishment can only lead to further erosion of respect for life and to the increased brutalization of our society.&quot;

Bernardin&#x27;s opposition to capital punishment was rooted in the conviction that an atmosphere of respect for life must pervade a society, and resorting to the death penalty would not support this attitude. Modern-day adherents to the consistent life ethic continue to oppose the use of capital punishment; in this advocacy, some echo Bernardin&#x27;s appeal to the sanctity of life, while others emphasize the relationships between class, race and capital punishment to argue that there is not a way for capital punishment to be used justly.

One outspoken anti-death penalty activist is Sister Helen Prejean. Her books &quot;Dead Man Walking&quot; and &quot;The Death of Innocents: An Eyewitness Account to Wrongful Executions&quot; are autobiographical accounts of the time she spent ministering to death row inmates.

===Health care===
Bernardin understood the consistent life ethic as implying a societal responsibility to provide adequate health care for all, especially the poor.

As such, appeals to the consistent life ethic have been made in support of universal health care.

===In vitro fertilization===
In vitro fertilization is a process in which multiple viable embryos are created, and a single one implanted, with the extra ones frozen for potential future use. After the parents stop paying the storage fees for these, they are discarded, which has been opposed by anti-abortion advocates.

Herb Geraghty, executive director of the secular group Rehumanize International, which promotes the consistent life ethic, said, &quot;We should not intentionally end the life of a human being, regardless of where they are in their lifecycle, in a womb or in a fertility lab&quot;, but also that he does not know what should be done with the &quot;thousands of human beings who are currently frozen against their will.&quot;

===Abuse of alcohol and other drugs===
James Hedges, in an article titled &quot;Prohibition Platform incorporates a Consistent Life Ethic,&quot; stated that &quot;Alcohol in many ways causes &#x27;premature deaths,&#x27; and it degrades the quality of life before death.&quot; However, with the exception of the Prohibition Party, most organizations that embrace a consistent life ethic do not take a stance on the prohibition of alcohol.

===Refugees===
The consistent life ethic has been invoked to include care for immigrants and refugees. While not directly appealing to the consistent life ethic, other Catholics have sought to apply the pro-life ethic to the issue of immigration.

==Criticisms==
One criticism made of the consistent life ethic position is that it inadvertently helped provide &quot;cover&quot; or support for politicians who supported legalized abortion or wanted to minimize this issue, a circumstance that Bernardin himself both recognized and deplored. A critic of Joseph Bernardin, George Weigel rejected the claims that the consistent life ethic had been created to cover up for abortion rights, saying that Bernardin was &quot;a committed pro-lifer&quot;. He still criticized the concept as a legacy of what he considers to be Bernardin&#x27;s &quot;culturally accommodating Catholicism&quot;.

The concept of a consistent life ethic is often rejected in the United States and abroad by those who prefer to use the concept of a culture of life as was promoted by Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI in their encyclicals. Archbishop José Gómez of Los Angeles dismissed the &quot;seamless garment&quot; approach in 2016 because in his view it results in &quot;a mistaken idea that all issues are morally equivalent&quot;. The &quot;seamless garment&quot; approach was also criticized by then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger while he was serving as Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In a July 2004 letter written to now former-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and to the United States Bishops as a whole, Cardinal Ratzinger makes it clear that the church does not treat capital punishment with the same moral weight that it does abortion and euthanasia: &quot;Not all moral issues have the same moral weight as abortion and euthanasia. For example, if a Catholic were to be at odds with the Holy Father [the Pope] on the application of capital punishment or on the decision to wage war, he would not for that reason be considered unworthy to present himself to receive Holy Communion...There may be a legitimate diversity of opinion even among Catholics about waging war and applying the death penalty, but not however with regard to abortion and euthanasia.&quot;

Jesuit magazine &quot;America&quot; stated in an article published on 6 December 2023 that the consistent life ethic, generally speaking, has been a failure, writing: &quot;Depressingly, 40 years since Cardinal Bernardin first proposed the consistent ethic of life, the ethic remains mired in the same senseless, polarized partisanship that Bernardin proposed the ethic to overcome.&quot;
