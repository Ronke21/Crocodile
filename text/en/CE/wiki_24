<text>Merenre Nemtyemsaf (meaning &quot;Beloved of Ra, Nemty is his protection&quot;; died 2278 BC) was an Ancient Egyptian king, fourth king of the Sixth Dynasty. He ruled Egypt for around 5 years in the early 23rd century BC, toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of his predecessor Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare who might have been his son or less probably his brother. Pepi I may have shared power with Merenre in a co-regency at the very end of the former&#x27;s reign.

Merenre&#x27;s rule saw profound changes in the administration of the southern provinces of Egypt, with a marked increase in the number of 
provincial administrators and a concurrent steep decline in the size of the central administration in the capital Memphis. As a consequence the provincial nobility became responsible for tax collection and resource management, gaining in political independence and economic power. This led to the first provincial burials for the highest officials including viziers, governors of Upper Egypt and nomarchs.
Several trading and quarrying expeditions took place under Merenre, in particular to Nubia where caravans numbering hundreds of donkeys were sent to fetch incense, ebony, animal skins, ivory and exotic animals. Such was the interest in the region that Merenre had a canal dug to facilitate the navigation of the first cataract into Nubia. Trade with the Levantine coast for lapis lazuli, silver, bitumen, and tin took place while quarrying for granite, travertine and alabaster took place in the south and in the Eastern Desert.

A pyramid complex was built for Merenre in Saqqara, known as &quot;Khanefermerenre&quot; by the Ancient Egyptians meaning &quot;The appearance of the perfection of Merenre&quot; and likely completed prior to the king&#x27;s death. The subterranean chambers were inscribed with the Pyramid Texts. In the burial chamber, the black basalt sarcophagus of the king still held a mummy when it was entered in the 19th century. The identification of the mummy as Merenre&#x27;s is still uncertain. Following his death, Merenre was the object of a funerary cult until at least the end of the Old Kingdom. During the New Kingdom period, he was in a selection of past kings to be honoured.

== Family ==
===Parents and siblings===

Merenre was the son of king Pepi I Meryre and queen Ankhesenpepi I, also called Ankhesenmeryre. Pepi I probably begot him in his old age. Ankhesenpepi&#x27;s motherhood is indicated by her titles. She bore the title of &quot;mother of the king of Upper and Lower Egypt of the pyramid of Merenre&quot; in tomb inscriptions, a style which at the time indicated relation to the king. Ankhesenpepi was a daughter of the nomarch of Abydos, Khui, and his wife Nebet. Pepi I made her into a vizier, the sole woman of the Old Kingdom period known to have held such a title. Khui and Nebet&#x27;s son, Merenre&#x27;s uncle Djau, served in the position of vizier under Merenre and Pepi II Neferkare.

Princess Neith was Merenre&#x27;s full sister. The archaeologist Gustave Jéquier has proposed that Neith was first married to Merenre then to Pepi II, explaining the absence of her tomb near that of Merenre as would be expected of a royal spouse. The Egyptologist Vivienne Callender observes however that among Neith&#x27;s titles presented in her tomb, those referring to her relation to Merenre are now illegible. Consequently, Callender states that whether or not she was married to Merenre cannot be ascertained beyond doubt.

Probable children of Pepi I who might thus be at least half-siblings of Merenre include princes Hornetjerkhet and Tetiankh and princess Meritites IV.

===Consorts and children===
Sixth dynasty royal seals and stone blocks found at Saqqara demonstrate that Merenre&#x27;s aunt Ankhesenpepi II, who married Pepi I, was also married to Merenre. She was the mother of the future pharaoh Pepi II. This is shown by her titles of &quot;royal wife of the pyramid of Meryre&quot;, &quot;Royal wife of the pyramid of Merenre&quot; and &quot;royal mother of the pyramid of Neferkare [Pepi II]&quot;.

Many Egyptologists favour Pepi I as the father of Pepi II. But the Egyptologist Philippe Collombert observes that since historical sources agree that Merenre&#x27;s reign intervened between those of Pepi I and Pepi II and lasted for around a decade, and given that one source states that Pepi II acceded to the throne at the age of six, then this indirectly indicates that Merenre I, rather than Pepi I, was Pepi II&#x27;s father. This opinion is shared by the Egyptologists Naguib Kanawati and Peter Brand.

Merenre had at least one daughter, Ankhesenpepi III, who became the wife of Pepi II. Merenre could also be the father of queen Iput II, another wife of Pepi II.

===Attestations===
Merenre is well attested by archaeology not only through his pyramid complex, but also through inscriptions and small artefacts bearing his name. These include 
* an alabaster vessel (inventory E 23140b) and ivory box (inventory N. 794), both in the Louvre Museum 
* a small sphinx in the National Museum of Scotland (inventory 1984.405)
* another sphinx in the Pushkin Museum 
* a calcite vessel in shape of a mother monkey and her child in the Metropolitan Museum of Art 
* a vase (inventory EA4493), a box (inventory EA65848) and a fragment of tomb painting (inventory EA65927), all in the British Museum 
* an alabaster vase (inventory no.3252) in the National Archaeological Museum, Florence 
* a similar vessel from Elephantine that was in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo (inventory CG 18694) in 1907

===Chronology===
====Relative====
The relative chronological position of Merenre Nemtyemsaf I within the Sixth Dynasty is certain. Historical sources and archaeological evidences agree that he succeeded Pepi I Meryre on the throne and was in turn succeeded by Pepi II Neferkare, evidencing that he was the fourth king of the dynasty. 
The earliest historical source on the matter is the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal inscribed during the reign of either Merenre or Pepi II. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished to be reused as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate ( 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period ( 2055–1650 BC). Nonetheless the few legible text fragments of the annal support the succession &quot;Teti → Userkare → Pepi I → Merenre I&quot; possibly followed by Pepi II, making Merenre the fourth king of the Sixth Dynasty.
Three more historical sources agree with this chronology, three of which date to the New Kingdom period. The Abydos King List, written under Seti I ( ) places Merenre I&#x27;s cartouche as the 37th entry between those of Pepi I and Pepi II. The Turin Canon, a list of kings on papyrus dating to the reign of Ramses II ( ) probably records Merenre I in the fifth column, fourth row, and may have supported his relative position within the dynasty although his name as well as those of his predecessor and successor is illegible. If the attribution of the entry is correct, then Merenre is credited with a reign length ending with the number four, perhaps some years and four months, or four or 14 years. Also dating to the reign of Ramses II is the Saqqara Tablet, explicitly relating the succession &quot;Pepi I → Merenre I → Pepi II&quot;, with Merenre located on the 24th entry.

The latest historical source recording a similar information is the (), a history of Egypt written in the third century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283–246 BC) by the priest-historian Manetho. No copies of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; have survived and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Africanus wrote that the mentioned the succession &quot;Othoês → Phius → Methusuphis → Phiops&quot; at the beginning of the Sixth Dynasty. Othoês, Phius, Methusuphis (in Greek, ) and Phiops are believed to be the Hellenised forms for Teti, Pepi I, Merenre and Pepi II, respectively. The &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; credits Methusuphis with seven years of reign.

====Absolute====
Merenre&#x27;s reign is difficult to date precisely in absolute terms. An absolute chronology referring to dates in our modern calendar is estimated by Egyptologists working backwards by adding reign lengths—themselves uncertain and inferred from historical sources and archaeological evidence—and, in a few cases, using ancient astronomical observations and radiocarbon dating. These methodologies do not agree perfectly and some uncertainty remains. As a result, Merenre&#x27;s rule is generally dated to the early 23rd century BC. Various hypotheses have been proposed by scholars though it is impossible to determine which one is right.

===Duration===
During the Old Kingdom period, Ancient Egyptians dated their documents and inscriptions by counting the years since the accession of the current king to the throne. These years were often referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the reign&#x27;s start. The cattle count, which involved counting cattle, oxen and small livestock, was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. During the early Sixth Dynasty this count was perhaps biennial, occurring every two years. The latest surviving inscription written during Merenre&#x27;s rule is located in a quarry at Hatnub mentioning the year after the 5th cattle count. If the cattle count was regular and purely biennial, this might correspond to Merenre&#x27;s tenth year on the throne. Similarly, for Baud and Dobrev a regular biennial count implies that the South Saqqara Stone recorded at least 11 to 13 years of reign for Merenre, almost twice the figure of seven years attributed to him in the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;. For Baud such a reign length is consistent with the finished state of Merenre&#x27;s pyramid complex.

In 1959, the Egyptologist and philologist Alan Gardiner proposed reading a now discounted 44 years figure on the Turin canon for Merenre, which the Egyptologist and art historian William Stevenson Smith later took to be 14 years instead, of which he attributes nine to a co-regency between Merenre and Pepi I. The Egyptologist Elmar Edel thought such lengths of reign would explain the time necessary for the peaceful relations that Egypt entertained with Lower Nubian chiefs under Merenre to switch to more adversarial ones under Pepi II.
In contrast, because of doubts on the regularity of the cattle count and of the general paucity of monuments and documents datable to his reign, Merenre is often credited with less than a decade on the throne by most modern Egyptologists: some give him nine to eleven years; while others propose six or seven years of reign.

=== Accession to the throne: co-regency ===
Merenre&#x27;s father Pepi&#x27;s rule seem to have been troubled at times, with at least one conspiracy against him hatched by one of his harem consorts. This may have given him the impetus to ally himself with Khui, the nomarch of Coptos, by marrying his daughters, queens Ankhesenpepi I and II. The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced another conspiracy toward the end of his reign, in which his vizier Rawer may have been involved. To support his theory, Kanawati observes that Rawer&#x27;s image in his tomb has been desecrated, with his name, hands and feet chiselled off, while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepi&#x27;s reign on stylistic grounds. Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else made heir to the throne at the expense of the designated heir Merenre. Because of this failed conspiracy, Pepi I may have taken the drastic step of crowning Merenre during his own reign, possibly &quot;in an
attempt to secure stability and continuity within the family&quot; as Miroslav Bárta writes; thereby creating the earliest documented co-regency in the history of Egypt. The Egyptologists Jaromir Málek and Miroslav Verner agree with this analysis; Verner adds that Merenre acceded to the throne at an early age and died young.
That such a co-regency took place was first proposed by Étienne Drioton who pointed to a gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as living kings, implying that both ruled concurrently for some time. In support of this hypothesis, the Egyptologist Hans Goedicke mentions the inscription dated to Merenre&#x27;s year of the fifth cattle count from Hatnub which he takes to indicate ten years of rule hence contradicting Manetho&#x27;s figure of seven years. This could be evidence that Merenre dated the start of his reign before the end of his father&#x27;s reign, as a co-regency would permit.

A possible further piece of evidence for a co-regency is given by two copper statues uncovered in an underground store beneath the floor of a Ka-chapel of Pepi in Hierakonpolis. There the Egyptologist James Quibell uncovered a statue of King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty, a terracotta lion cub made during the Thinite era, a golden mask representing Horus and two copper statues. Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base, these statues had been disassembled, placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I &quot;on the first day of the Sed festival&quot;. The two statues were symbolically &quot;trampling underfoot the Nine bows&quot;—the enemies of Egypt—a stylized representation of Egypt&#x27;s conquered foreign subjects. While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved. The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre. As Alessandro Bongioanni and Maria Croce write: &quot;[Merenre] was publicly associated as his father&#x27;s successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Sed festival]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.&quot; Alternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed the smaller statue may represent &quot;a more youthful Pepi I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies&quot;.
The existence of the co-regency remains uncertain, lacking any definite proof. For Vassil Dobrev and Michel Baud, who analysed the royal annals of the South Saqqara Stone, Merenre directly succeeded his father in power. In particular, the legible parts of the annals bear with no traces in direct support of an interregnum or co-regency. More precisely, the document preserves the record of Pepi I&#x27;s final year and proceeds immediately to the first year of Merenre. Furthermore, the shape and size of the stone on which the annals are inscribed makes it more probable that Merenre did not start to count his years of reign until soon after the death of his father. Furthermore, William J. Murnane writes that the gold pendant&#x27;s context is unknown, making its significance regarding the co-regency difficult to appraise. The copper statues are similarly inconclusive as the identity of the smaller one, and whether they originally formed a group, remains uncertain.

===Domestic activities===
====Administration====

Developments of the provincial administration were undertaken during Merenre&#x27;s rule, with a marked increase in the number of provincial administrators including newly created titles for granary and treasury overseers, paralleled with a steep decline in the size of the central administration in Memphis. For the Egyptologists Nigel Strudwick and Petra Andrassy this witnesses to an incessantly evolving domestic policy aimed at managing the remote southern provinces.
The motivations behind such changes are not clear. Either an attempt was made at improving the provincial administration or the goal was to disperse powerful nobles throughout the realm, away from the royal court. Indeed, the many marriages of Pepi I may have generated instability by creating competing groups and factions at court. In any case, the reforms appear to have been implemented rather uniformly, suggesting that the central executive authority of the state was still substantial at that time.

With these changes, provincial officials were now directly responsible for the collection of local tax and labour and dealt with all works in their nomes from then on. The increasing political and economic importance of individual nomes and local centres is reflected in that even the highest ranking officials including the viziers and the overseers of Upper Egypt started to be abundantly buried in the provinces rather than close to the royal necropolis. For example, the nomarch of the second nome Qar was buried in Edfu, nomarchs Harkhuf and later Heqaib in Qubbet el-Hawa near Aswan, vizier Idi near modern-day Asyut and vizier Weni in the eighth nome at Abydos. More provincial burials of Upper Egyptian nomarchs from this time period have been uncovered in Elephantine, Thebes (fourth nome), Coptos (fifth nome), Dendera (sixth nome), Qasr el-Sayed (seventh nome), Akhmim (ninth nome), Deir el-Gabrawi (12th nome), Meir (14th nome), El Sheikh Sa&#x27;id (15th nome), Zawyet el-Maiyitin (16th nome), Kom el-Ahmar (18th nome), Dishasha (20th nome) and Balat in the Dakhla Oasis. These rock-cut tombs are markedly different from the mastabas of the royal necropolises. At the same time, Pepi I, Merenre and Pepi II deliberately set up cults for queens Ankhesenpepi I, Ankhesenpepi II and later Iput II in the Qift province, whence they originated. Richard Bußmann says this was an effort to &quot;strengthen the kings&#x27; ties to powerful families in Upper Egypt&quot;.

At the personal level, Merenre may have appointed Idi, possibly a relative of Djau, to the courtly rank of sole companion of the king and nomarch of the Upper Egyptian eighth nome. Idi later served Pepi II in the 12th nome. Another administrative official whom Merenre promoted was Weni. He was made leader of quarrying expeditions then a count and governor of Upper Egypt. In this role Weni organised two censuses and two corvées in the South on behalf of the court. Weni was then elevated to the highest offices, those of vizier and chief judge, and likely died during Merenre&#x27;s reign. Merenre appointed Qar nomarch of Edfu and overseer of Upper Egyptian grain and livestock resources. He was also appointed chief judge over the whole of Upper Egypt. Merenre also made Kaihap Tjeti, a provincial-born young royal courtier under Pepi I, into a stolist of the god Min. Kaihap Tjeti later became nomarch of the ninth Upper Egyptian nome under Merenre or Pepi II, and was buried near Akhmim.
====Cultic activities====
thumb|upright=1.15|Fragments of private stele bearing Merenre&#x27;s cartouche from Kom el-Sultan|alt=Drawing in black ink on yellow paper of pieces of hieroglyphic inscriptions
Religious activities dating to Merenre&#x27;s reign are recorded on the legible passages of the South Saqqara Stone: early in his reign 
he offered 30 oxen to an unidentified god and five to Wadjet. To Seth he offered a lost number of oxen. A statue of the king might also have been erected in the first couple of years of his reign. Additional offerings can be inferred from the surviving remnants of the texts, numbering hundreds or even thousands of oxen, lapis-lazuli, loincloths, incense to Ptah, Heryshaf, Nefertum and the Ennead, hundreds of birds and perfumed oil to Khenti-Amentiu, and silver objects and kohl to Khenti-kheti. The list of offerings also mentions Djedkare Isesi, penultimate king of the Fifth Dynasty, who seems to have been held in high esteem during Merenre&#x27;s reign. Merenre even chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare.

In addition to these activities, Merenre made a decree pertaining to the funerary cult of Menkaure as shown by fragmentary inscriptions uncovered in the latter&#x27;s mortuary temple.

====Construction works====
The main monument dating to Merenre&#x27;s reign is his pyramid complex. Apart from this, there are tentative indications that Merenre had work carried out in the temple of Osiris and Khenti-Amentiu in modern-day Kom el-Sultan, near Abydos. There, fragments of several private stelae dating to his reign were uncovered in the temple&#x27;s foundations, which was completely renovated in the 12th dynasty (). The nature and extent of the works undertaken at the time cannot be fully ascertained; possibly Merenre had a Ka-chapel built there following his father who built such chapels extensively throughout Egypt.

===End of reign===
A second co-regency between Merenre and Pepi II has been proposed by Stevenson Smith following the discovery of a cylinder seal in Tell el-Maskhuta. The seal, belonging to an administrative official, is inscribed with &quot;the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Merenre, living forever like Re&quot; and shows the king smiting an enemy and the Horus names of both Merenre and Pepi II in serekhs facing one another. This evidence for a shared reign is circumstantial and could equally well indicate that the official meant to convey that he served in the army under both kings, or that the kings were close kin. Given Pepi II&#x27;s youth on acceding to the throne and Merenre&#x27;s likely short reign, William J. Murnane and others after him including Anthony Spalinger and Nigel Strudwick have rejected the idea of a co-regency between the two rulers. In contrast for Miroslav Bárta the possibility of this co-regency cannot be excluded.

==Foreign activities==
===Eastern Desert and Levant===
Merenre sent at least one mining expedition to Wadi Hammamat in the Eastern Desert to collect greywacke and siltstone. Weni, who began his career under Teti, rose through the ranks of the administration under Pepi I was the leader of this expedition and reported its goal:

The expedition left two inscriptions in the Wadi, indicating that it took place on the year of the second cattle count, probably Merenre&#x27;s fourth year on the throne. 
Alabaster was extracted from Hatnub, also in the Eastern Desert, a location where an expedition under the leadership of Weni was tasked with the quarrying of a very large travertine altar stone for the pyramid of Merenre: 
While there is no direct evidence for Egyptian activity in Sinai specifically during Merenre&#x27;s reign, frequent expeditions were sent in the region for turquoise and other resources during the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties. Egypt in all probability maintained diplomatic and trade relations with Byblos to procure cedar wood, and with Canaan and the wider Levant—then in the Early Bronze Age IV to Middle Bronze Age I period—as witnessed by imported jars found in the tombs of Idi and Weni. Further abroad, the high official Iny, who served under Pepi I, Merenre and Pepi II, either led or participated in a sea-borne mission to Syria-Palestine, possibly during Merenre&#x27;s rule, to obtain lapis lazuli, silver, bitumen and lead or tin. In addition, a possible military campaign in the southern Levant which Weni may have conducted under Pepi I shows the continuing interest in those regions to the east and northeast of the Nile Delta on behalf of the Egyptian state at the time.

===Nubia===

During Merenre&#x27;s reign Lower Nubia was the focus of Egypt&#x27;s foreign policy interests. Two rock reliefs depict the king receiving the submission of Nubian chieftains, the earlier of which, located on the ancient route from Aswan to Philae near the First Cataract, shows Merenre standing on the symbol for the union of the two lands, suggesting that it was carved during his first year of reign. Toward the end of the Old Kingdom period, Nubia saw the arrival of the C-Group people from the south. Centred at Kerma, they struggled intermittently with Egypt and its allies over control of the region which, for the Egyptians, was a source of incense, ebony, animal skins, ivory and exotic animals. Three Egyptian hosts were sent in expeditions by Merenre to procure luxury goods from Lower Nubia, where tribes had united to form a state, into the , possibly modern-day Dongola or Shendi.

These expeditions took place under the direction of the caravan conductor and later nomarch of Elephantine Harkhuf. He claimed to have pacified the land South of Egypt but his expeditions likely constituted a labour force and a traders&#x27; caravan above all. The aim of such expeditions was first and foremost to exploit resources the locals would not or could not use, and only rarely did they have to fight.
The first expedition, during which Harkhuf was accompanied by his father the lector priest Iri, lasted for seven months while the second took eight months. On the third expedition, which took place at the end of Merenre&#x27;s reign or early in Pepi II&#x27;s, Harkhuf was informed that the king of Yam had gone to war against the Tjemehu people, possibly Libyans or people to the west of Nubia. He consequently either joined his forces with those of Yam, in order to defeat their adversaries and gain riches; or he caught up with the king of Yam to prevent the outbreak of hostilities. The ruler of Irtjet, Setju and Wawat might have further threatened to interfere with Harkhuf&#x27;s return to Egypt but changed stance, offering cattle and goats to Harkhuf. This was possibly after he had received gifts or because of Harkhuf&#x27;s strong escort. At any rate, Harkhuf went to great length to explain to the king his unexpected delays as the duration of these expeditions was a matter of pride to him. He was greeted in return by an envoy from the court bringing date-wine, cakes, bread, and beer. 
Such expeditions, each of which represented a round-trip journey, took the form of large caravans of donkeys. The third one led by Harkhuf numbered three hundred asses carrying various goods including incense, ebony and grain in large storage jars. To meet the demands of trade within Egypt and outside of Egypt for pack animals, donkeys were raised in large numbers in Egypt since at least the Fourth Dynasty. 
In the year of the fifth cattle count since the beginning of his reign, Merenre travelled south to Elephantine from his capital to receive the submission of Nubian chieftains. This is indicated by an inscription and relief located opposite the cataract island of El-Hesseh near Philae: 

On the same occasion, Merenre might also have visited the temple of Satet on Elephantine island to renew a naos erected by Pepi I. This is suggested by another inscription of Merenre on the rock face of a natural grotto in a niche of the temple:

Besides Harkhuf, another Egyptian high official who was active in Nubia at the time was Weni, who had been promoted to commander of the army by Pepi I. As such Weni hired Nubian mercenaries for his military campaigns in Sinai and the Levant, mercenaries which were also frequently employed as police force. Weni was also tasked with bringing back from Elephantine to Memphis a false door of granite and granite doorway and lintels for the upper chamber of the pyramid complex of Merenre. He did so, sailing down-stream with six cargo-boats, three tow boats and one warship, finally mooring by the pyramid. The tow-boats were large barges capable of transporting heavy loads; Weni&#x27;s biography gives their dimensions as in length and -wide. Overall, Egyptian activities in Lower Nubia were sufficiently important that Weni was directed to oversee the excavation of a five-channels canal near modern-day Shellal. The canal ran parallel to the Nile, in order to facilitate the navigation of the First Cataract. On the same occasion, Weni had seven boats of acacia built from timber he had received from Nubian chieftains.

==Pyramid complex==
===Main pyramid===

The pyramid of Merenre was built at South Saqqara. The Ancient Egyptians named it &quot;Khanefermerenre&quot;, which is variously translated as &quot;Merenre appears in glory and is beautiful&quot;, &quot;The perfection of Merenre rises&quot;, &quot;The appearance of the perfection of Merenre&quot;, and &quot;Merenre appears and is beautiful&quot;. The pyramid is located to the south-west of the pyramid of Pepi I and a similar distance to the pyramid of Djedkare. The pyramid originally reached a height of 100 Egyptian cubits, , and had a square base side-length of 150 cubits, . This would give the elevation of Merenre&#x27;s pyramid a hypotenuse of 125 cubits, and consequently an elevation (slope) in the same proportion as Khafre&#x27;s pyramid at Giza. The triangle formed by half of the base, the height, and the hypotenuse (75, 100, 125 cubits)form a Pythagorean Triple, reduceable to proportions of 3,4,5. It may have been accessed via a causeway starting from a harbour located on the nearby Wadi Tafla, some away, but also below. Fine limestone for the pyramid was quarried in Tura, the quarries being administered from Saqqara or Memphis.

The inner passages of the pyramid were laid out according to those found in Djedkare Isesi&#x27;s pyramid. They are inscribed with the Pyramid Texts. Discovered by the Egyptologist Gaston Maspero at the end of the nineteenth century, the texts of the pyramid of Merenre were only published in full in 2019 by the Egyptologist Isabelle Pierre-Croisiau. The north wall of the burial chamber, now completely ruined, bore offering ritual formulae which continued onto the east wall, as is the case in the pyramids of Unas, Teti and Pepi I. The Pyramid Texts are made of hundreds of utterances organised in groups of inscriptions, yet in different copies the utterances could be in varying position within a group and exchanged between groups. This reveals some editorial dynamism in the composition of the rites they represent. The south and west wall of the burial chamber of Merenre bear texts concerning the transfiguration of the king.
On the east wall are utterances calling for the perpetuation of the cult of the deceased ruler, while two further groups of texts on the resurrection of Horus and the protection of Nut are found on the opposite wall. The rest of the texts found in the burial chamber pertain to the anointing and wrapping of the king, his provisioning, summons by Isis and Nephthys, and the ascent to the sky. Leading out of the sarcophagus chamber, the walls of the antechamber bear texts calling for the king&#x27;s joining the company of the gods and apotropaic formulae. The remaining corridors and vestibules of the tomb bear utterances on the celestial circuit of the king and gods.

===Mortuary temple===
The pyramid of Merenre is surrounded by a wider mortuary complex, its offering chapel located on the north face of the pyramid. Fragments of reliefs showing the gods greeting the king in the afterlife have been uncovered there. The hall of the chapel is paved with limestone. Further on stands the base of a granite false-door. Some of the decoration of the complex was left unfinished, as work likely stopped at the death of the king.

===Mummy===

In 1881, the Egyptologists Émile and Heinrich Brugsch managed to enter the burial chamber of Merenre&#x27;s pyramid via a robber&#x27;s tunnel. They found its massive ceiling beams of limestone hanging dangerously as the lower retaining walls of the chamber had been removed by stone robbers. The black basalt sarcophagus was still intact, its lid pushed back, and in it lay the mummy of a -tall man. The mummy was in a poor condition because ancient tomb robbers had partially torn off its wrappings. The Brugsch brothers decided to transport the mummy to Cairo, in order to show it to Auguste Mariette, head of the Egyptian Department of Antiquities and by then dying. During the transport, the mummy suffered further damage: problems with the railroads prevented the mummy from being taken to Cairo by train and the Brugschs took the decision to carry it on foot. After the wooden sarcophagus employed to that end had become too heavy, they took out the mummy and broke it into two pieces. The mummy was first housed in the various incarnations of the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, until moved to the Imhotep Museum at Saqqara in 2006. Émile Brugsch donated some fragments, a collarbone, cervical vertebrae and a rib to the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. These have not been located since World War II.

Preliminary forensic analyses of the mummy by Grafton Smith indicate that it is that of a young man, as suggested by possible traces of a sidelock of youth. The identity of the mummy remains uncertain as Elliot Smith observed that the technique employed for the wrapping was typical of the Eighteenth Dynasty () rather than the Sixth. Re-wrapping of older mummies is known to have occurred, so that this observation does not necessarily preclude that the mummy is that of Merenre. The mummy has not been properly studied since Elliott Smith&#x27;s analyses in the early 20th century, and its identification remains uncertain.

==Legacy==
===Old Kingdom===
Like other kings of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties, Merenre was the object of an official, state-sponsored funerary cult which took place in his pyramid complex. In the mid-Sixth Dynasty, nomarchs were overseer of the priests of such cults. For instance, Qar, nomarch of Edfu and Gegi, nomarch of the Thinite nome, were &quot;instructor of the priests of the pyramid &#x27;Merenre appears and is beautiful&#x27;&quot;; Heqaib, nomarch of the first nome of Upper Egypt under Pepi II, was &quot;leader of the phyle of the pyramid of Merenre&quot;.

Some of the priests serving the cult in the pyramid complex of Merenre are known by name, including Iarti and his son Merenreseneb; a certain Meru called Bebi; and Nipepy, who also officiated in the pyramid of Pepi I. Another piece of evidence concerning this cult comes from a decree of Pepi II exempting people living in the pyramid town of Merenre from tax or corvée. A fragmentary papyrus letter from a certain Ankhpepy, inspector of the royal granary at the pyramid town of Merenre, further confirms its existence and prosperity at the time of Merenre&#x27;s and Pepi II&#x27;s reigns:
A few priests serving the funerary cult of Merenre during the later Sixth Dynasty are known; for example the priest Idu Seneni served in both Merenre&#x27;s and Pepi II&#x27;s pyramids. The cult was active even outside of Merenre&#x27;s mortuary temple at Saqqara: inscriptions in Elkab attest to the presence of priests of this cult officiating in or in the vicinity of the local temple of Nekhbet. 
This perhaps persisted into the First Intermediate Period, as possibly witnessed by the career of Menankhpepy. Menankhpepy served as priest in the pyramid complex of Merenre but uncertainties on the precise dating of his lifetime hinder positive conclusions on the persistence of Merenre&#x27;s cult in the turmoil of the First Intermediate Period. The Egyptologists Henry George Fischer and Ludwig Borchardt proposed that Menankhpepy lived during the Ninth or Eleventh Dynasties, respectively, while recent reappraisals have led to a Sixth Dynasty dating.

===Later periods===
The deposit of cultic objects comprising the two bronze statues of Pepi I and possibly Merenre uncovered by James Quibell in Hierakonpolis was in all probability placed there during building works in the early Middle Kingdom period. This deposit, and others like it found in the temple area, is composed of ceremonial objects and statuary dating from the earlier periods. This suggests some cultic practices with them up to that point.

Similarly, some cult of Merenre existed or was revived in the New Kingdom period as shown by the presence of his cartouche on the Karnak King List. The list was composed during the reign of Thutmosis III ( 1479–1425 BC) with the purpose of honouring a selection of royal ancestors.

Merenre is the name of the pharaoh and one of the main protagonists in the French-language animated cartoon series . The cartoon depicts him as a benevolent ruler, father of the main heroine, princess Théti-Chéri. In the comics &quot;Papyrus&quot;, the pharaoh is named after Merneptah instead.

<text>Merenre () is an Ancient Egyptian name meaning &quot;(the one) whom Ra has loved&quot;. It has sometimes suggested that the Greek Μενθεσοῦφις (Menthesouphis) is a rendering of this name, but it may more likely be a metathesized rendering of the name . Merenre is the throne name of two pharaohs of the 6th Dynasty during the late Old Kingdom period:

*Pharaoh Merenre Nemtyemsaf I (2283–2278 BC),

<text>The Waikato Times is a daily newspaper published in Hamilton, New Zealand, and owned by media business Stuff Ltd. It has a circulation to the greater Waikato region and became a tabloid paper in 2018. 

The newspaper has won the title of New Zealand Newspaper of the Year (in the category of up to 30,000 circulation) for two consecutive years: 2018 and 2019.

== History ==
The &quot;Waikato Times&quot; started out as the tri-weekly &quot;Waikato Times and Thames Valley Gazette&quot;, first published by George Jones on 2 May 1872 in Ngāruawāhia but moved to Hamilton in 1875. It was then managed by Messrs Langbridge, Silver, E. M. Edgecumbe, George Edgecumbe and J. S. Bond, who ran a book and stationery shop and changed the Times from tri-weekly to a penny daily in 1896, using Press Association news.

For 20 years it competed with the &quot;Waikato Argus&quot;, until the papers merged in 1915. The paper changed from afternoon to morning production from 5 September 2011, though had changed its Saturday issue in 2003.

The &quot;Times&quot; had an audited net daily circulation of 11,633 copies at March 2021. 

 Allan Hawkey produces opinion cartoons for the newspaper.

Papers Past has 2 May 1872 to 31 December 1892 issues in a searchable form on-line. Hamilton reference library has microfilm copies of the &quot;Waikato Argus&quot; (29 Aug 1896 – 27 December 1902, 23 January 1903 – 30 April 1909, 1 June 1909 – 4 December 1914) and &quot;Waikato Times&quot; from 1872. 

On 27 April 2023, Stuff confirmed that it would launch separate subscription-based websites for &quot;The Waikato Times&quot; and two of its other major newspapers, &quot;The Post&quot; and &quot;The Press&quot;. Previously, the newspaper had been hosged on the free Stuff news website.

===Community newspapers===
The &quot;Hamilton Press&quot; is a weekly newspaper, delivered on Wednesdays, in the city of Hamilton. It is one of many free weekly, or bi-weekly &quot;Neighbourly&quot; newspapers, which, since 2014, have been printed by Stuff. They also include &quot;Cambridge Edition,&quot; &quot;Franklin County News, Matamata Chronicle, Piako Post&quot; (Morrinsville-Te Aroha area)&quot;, South Waikato News&quot; and &quot;Taupō Times&quot;.

== Awards and nominations ==

In 2017, &quot;Waikato Times&quot; journalist Aaron Leaman was the joint winner of the Senior nib Health Journalism Scholarship at the Voyager Media Awards. Leaman also won Regional Journalist of the Year at the same event.

In 2018, &quot;Waikato Times&quot; journalist Ruby Nyika won Student Journalist of the Year at the Voyager Media Awards. The same year, Donna-Lee Biddle was runner-up for the Regional Journalist of the Year Award, and won the award for Feature writing - crime, justice and / or social issues.

In 2019, &quot;Waikato Times&quot; columnist Max Christoffersen won the Opinion Writing (General) Award at the Voyager Media Awards. Christoffersen had died two months prior to the awards ceremony.

<doc id="911028" wikidata="Q258285" url="?curid=911028" title="External cephalic version">
<text>External cephalic version (ECV) is a process by which a breech baby can sometimes be turned from buttocks or foot first to head first. It is a manual procedure that is recommended by national guidelines for breech presentation of a pregnancy with a single baby, in order to enable vaginal delivery. It is usually performed late in pregnancy, that is, after 36 gestational weeks, preferably 37 weeks, and can even be performed in the early stages of childbirth.

ECV is endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) as a mode to avoid the risks associated with a vaginal breech or cesarean delivery for singleton breech presentation.

ECV can be contrasted with &quot;internal cephalic version&quot;, which involves a hand inserted through the cervix.

==Medical use==
ECV is one option of intervention should a breech position of a baby be found after 36 weeks gestation. Other options include a planned caesarian section or planned vaginal delivery.

=== Success rates ===
ECV has an average success rate of around 58%, between 40 and 64% depending on whether it is the mother&#x27;s first child or not. (40% for first-time mothers and closer to 60% for women who have had previous children.

Various factors can alter the success rates of ECV. Practitioner experience, maternal weight, obstetric factors such as uterine relaxation, a palpable fetal head, a non-engaged breech, non-anterior placenta, and an amniotic fluid index above 7–10 cm, are all factors which can be associated with higher success rates. In addition, the effect of neuraxial blockade on ECV success rates have been conflicting, although ECV appears easier to perform under epidural block.

Following successful ECV, with the baby turned to head first, there is a less than 5% chance of the baby turning spontaneously to breech again.

==Contra-indications==
Some situations exist where ECV is not indicated or may cause harm. These include recent antepartum haemorrhage, placenta praevia, abnormal fetal monitoring, ruptured membranes, multiple pregnancy, pre-eclampsia, reduced amniotic fluid and some other abnormalities of the uterus or baby.

==Risks==
As with any procedure there can be complications most of which can be greatly decreased by having an experienced professional on the birth team. An ultrasound to estimate a sufficient amount of amniotic fluid and monitoring of the fetus immediately after the procedure can also help minimize risks.

Evidence of complications of ECV from clinical trials is limited, but ECV does reduce the chance of breech presentation at birth and caesarian section. The 2015 &quot;Cochrane review&quot; concluded that &quot;large observational studies suggest that complications are rare&quot;.

Typical risks include umbilical cord entanglement, abruption of placenta, preterm labor, premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) and severe maternal discomfort. Overall complication rates have ranged from about 1 to 2 percent since 1979. While somewhat out of favour between 1970 and 1980, the procedure has seen an increase in use due to its relative safety.

Successful ECV significantly decreases the rate of cesarean section, however, women are still at an increased risk of instrumental delivery (ventouse and forceps delivery) and cesarean section compared to women with spontaneous cephalic presentation (head first).

==Technique==
The procedure is undertaken by either one or two physicians and where emergency facilities to undertake instrumental delivery and caesarian section are at hand. Blood is also taken for cross-matching should a complication arise. Prior to performing ECV, an ultrasound of the abdomen is performed to confirm the breech position and the mother&#x27;s blood pressure and pulse are taken. A cardiotocography (CTG) is also performed to monitor the baby&#x27;s heart.

The procedure usually lasts a few minutes and is monitored intermittently with CTG. With a covering of ultrasonic gel on the abdomen to reduce friction, the physician&#x27;s hands are placed on the mother&#x27;s abdomen around the baby. Then, by applying firm pressure to manoeuvre the baby up and away from the pelvis and to gently turn in several steps from breech, to a sideways position, the final manipulation results in a head first presentation. The procedure is discontinued if maternal distress, repeated failure or fetal compromise on monitoring occurs.

ECV performed before term may decrease the rate of breech presentation compared to ECV at term, but may increase the risk of preterm delivery.
There is some evidence to support the use of tocolytic drugs in ECV. Given by injection, tocolytics relax the uterus muscle and may improve the chance of turning the baby successfully. This is considered safe for the mother and baby, but can cause the mother to experience facial flushing and a feeling of a fast heart rate.
Use of intravenous nitroglycerin has been proposed.

Following the procedure, a repeat CTG is performed and a repeat ultrasound will confirm a successful turn. Should this first attempt fail, a second attempt on another day can be considered.

In addition, to prevent Rh disease after the procedure, all rhesus D negative pregnant women are offered an intramuscular injection of anti-Rh antibodies (Rho(D) immune globulin).

==History==
ECV has existed since 384–322 B.C., the time of Aristotle. Around 100 A.D., Soranus of Ephesus included guidance on ECV as a way to reduce complications of vaginal breech birth. 17th century French obstetrician, François Mauriceau, is alleged to have described ECV as &quot;a little more difficult than turning an omelette in a frying pan&quot;. Justus Heinrich Wigand published an account of ECV in 1807 and the procedure was increasingly accepted following Adolphe Pinard&#x27;s demonstration of it in France. In 1901, British obstetrician, Herbert R. Spencer, advocated ECV in his publication on breech birth. In 1927, obstetrician George Frederick Gibberd, reviewed 9,000 consecutive births around Guy&#x27;s Hospital, London. Following his study, he recommended ECV, even if it failed and needed to be repeated and even if it required anaesthesia.

ECV&#x27;s safety has continued to be a longstanding controversy. Following a protocol developed in Berlin, ECV did increase in popularity in the United States in the 1980s. The procedure has been increasingly considered as low risk of complications and its improvement in safety as a result of the routine use of electronic fetal monitoring, waiting until closer to term and the replacement of anaesthesia by tocolysis, has seen a recent resurgence.

<text>( or ; The Csárdás Princess; translated into English as The Riviera Girl and The Gipsy Princess) is an operetta in 3 acts by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán, with libretto by Leo Stein and Bela Jenbach. It premiered in Vienna at the Johann Strauss Theater on 17 November 1915. Numerous film versions and recordings have been made. The operetta is widely beloved across Europe, particularly in Hungary, Austria, Germany, and the former Soviet Union, where it was adapted into a popular film. It is arguably Kálmán&#x27;s most successful work.

==Roles==

==Synopsis==
:Place: Budapest and Vienna
:Time: shortly before the outbreak of the First World War

===Act 1===

Sylva Varescu, a self-sufficient and professionally successful cabaret performer from Budapest, is about to embark on a tour of America. Three of her aristocratic admirers, named Edwin, Feri, and Boni, prefer her to stay. Edwin, unaware that his parents have already arranged a marriage for him back home in Vienna, orders a notary to prepare a promissory note of his expected marriage to Sylva within ten weeks. Sylva then leaves on her American tour, and Edwin leaves for peacetime military duty.

===Act 2===
Just at the time this promissory note is about to expire, Sylva visits Edwin&#x27;s palace in Vienna, pretending to have married Boni as her entrée into his family&#x27;s society. Edwin is about to be engaged to Stasi, who does not care for him and wishes only an arranged marriage. Boni falls in love with Stasi and Edwin regrets not keeping his promise to Sylva sooner. However, Edwin makes the faux pas of informing Sylva that his parents would accept Sylva only if she pretends to have been divorced from Boni and therefore already entered society via an earlier marriage. Edwin&#x27;s father separately informs Sylva that if she marries Edwin without first having achieved noble rank through some other route, her role in society could be merely that of a &quot;csárdás princess.&quot; Sylva realizes that she is better than they and has a brighter future than they have. She purposefully embarrasses Edwin and his father, turning her back on them and leaving in the presence of their assembled friends.

===Act 3===
The act is set in a Viennese hotel to which Feri has accompanied the cabaret troupe from Budapest, who are about to sail on another American tour with Sylva. As everyone shows up and recognizes each other, Feri recognizes Edwin&#x27;s mother as a retired cabaret singer from Budapest whose star once shone prior to Sylva&#x27;s time. Edwin&#x27;s mother joins the two couples, Sylva/Edwin and Boni/Stasi, all unwittingly heading to safety on this American tour.

<doc id="911062" wikidata="Q431722" url="?curid=911062" title="Endor (village)">
<text>Endor ( or ) was listed in the Book of Joshua () as one of the Canaanite cities the Israelites failed to dispossess, neither the city nor its dependencies. It was located between the Hill of Moreh and Mount Tabor in the Jezreel Valley. It is mentioned twice more in the Hebrew Bible, in 1 Samuel and in Psalm 83.

== Etymology ==
The original meaning of &quot;Endor&quot; is unknown and its spelling in Hebrew varies. It may be connected with the words &quot;ʿen&quot;&quot;spring&quot; and &quot;dor&quot; &quot;generation&quot;.

== In the Bible ==

Endor was first mentioned in , when Endor fell within the allotments of the Tribe of Manasseh.

In , Saul consulted the Witch of Endor (), who lived in the village, on the evening before the Battle of Gilboa, in which he perished.

According to , it was the scene of the rout of Jabin and Sisera after being defeated by Barak and Deborah in .

== Location ==
The location of Endor is widely debated, and many places have been suggested. From the biblical accounts, an Endor located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley seems to fit best. The tribal allotments of Manasseh, Saul&#x27;s journey to Endor and the defeat of Sisera&#x27;s army all fit well with a location on this side of the valley, somewhere between Khirbet Bil &#x27;ameh and Ti&#x27;inik. However, there are difficulties with this location. From the origin of the name, a spring must also be located somewhere nearby, and archaeological evidence from the time of Joshua, Judges, and Saul is required.

Many suggested sites are located on the north side of the Jezreel Valley, near or on the Hill of Moreh. The main reasons for this placement are due to tradition and name preservation. The central difficulty for Endor in a northern location is that it does not fit the biblical accounts well. The city lists in Joshua 17:11, and would mention Endor out of logical order. However, a supporting factor for a northern site is that Saul had to be disguised as he traveled to the witch at Endor. That is usually attributed to Endor being behind enemy lines since the Philistines were camped at Shunem, just southwest of the most accepted Endor site. Those who hold to a southern site location explain the disguise as necessary not to transverse any enemy lines, but to hide Saul&#x27;s identity from the medium. Both explanations are possible. The following sites have been suggested:

* &quot;Khirbet Jadurah&quot;: This site is located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley, but with no spring, the site has been deemed incorrect.
* &quot;Tell Qedesh / Tell abu Qudeis&quot;; This tell is a much better site than Khirbet Jadurah and located on the south edge of the Jezreel Valley. It has two springs nearby, remains from the right periods, and a walled city area. Proponents for a southern Endor usually hold to this as the correct site for ancient Endor.
* &quot;Tell el-Ajjul / el-Ajyul / Agol&quot; (): This tell is located on the north side of the Jezreel Valley east of Nain, on the right of the road to Tamra. The small hill, on the east side of the Hill of Moreh, is 211 meters high. Archaeologists have uncovered tombs and a spring inside a cave. The spring was named Fountain of Dor as it was believed to be the site of Endor. This site is distinct from Tell el-Ajjul in the Gaza Strip and the ancient village of Ajjul north of Jerusalem.
* &quot;Indur, Endur, En-dor&quot; (): The Palestinian town of Indur, depopulated during the 1947–1949 Palestine war, preserved the name of the ancient site. Excavations were carried out on Indur, but with no remains found at the site, it was largely ruled out as being ancient Endor.
* &quot;Khirbet Safsafeh / Es-Safsafa&quot; (): Many believe Khirbet Safsafeh to be the site of ancient En-dor, as reflected as being the site most normally marked on maps. This site is located northeast of modern Sulam, south of Mount Tabor. Two wadis drain from this location, one to the northeast and the other to the northwest. During Roman Palestine, the site had a large population. Arabs later inhabited it until it was depopulated during the 1947–1949 Palestine war. After the war, Israelis built a kibbutz there named Ein Dor. Tradition seems to be the best support for Khirbet Safsafeh. Since the 4th century, Endor has been recognized by early Christian pilgrims and by the Crusaders as Biblical Endor. During the Crusader era, it was mentioned by Brocardus, a 14th-century German priest. When Edward Robinson came upon the site, he described it as an ordinary village. C. Conder and H. Kitchener also recognized the site and described it as a small village. Name preservation also supports Khirbet Safsafeh as being ancient Endor, for although the site does not preserve the ancient name, its nearby neighbor to the northeast, Indur, did. The modern village could have easily moved from the ancient site, taking the name with it.

<doc id="911064" wikidata="Q6535916" url="?curid=911064" title="New Year's levee">
<text>A New Year&#x27;s levée is a social event on New Year&#x27;s Day hosted by the Governor General of Canada, the lieutenant governors, military establishments, municipalities, and other institutions.

==History==

The word &quot;levée&quot; (from French, noun use of infinitive &quot;lever&quot;, &quot;rising&quot;, from Latin &quot;levāre&quot;, &quot;to raise&quot;) originated in the &quot;levée du soleil&quot; (rising of the sun) of King Louis XIV (1643–1715). It was his custom to receive his male subjects in his bedchamber just after arising, a practice that subsequently spread throughout Europe.

In the 18th century the levée in Great Britain and Ireland became a formal court reception given by the sovereign or his/her representative in the forenoon or early afternoon. In the New World colonies the levee was held by the governor acting on behalf of the monarch. Only men were received at these events. Women were presented in the evening at court. 

It was in Canada that the levée became associated with New Year&#x27;s Day. The fur traders had the tradition of paying their respects to the master of the fort (their government representative) on New Year&#x27;s Day. This custom was adopted by the governor general and lieutenant governors for their levées.

The first recorded levée in Canada was held on January 1, 1646, in the Château St. Louis by Charles Huault de Montmagny, Governor of New France from 1636 to 1648. In addition to wishing a happy new year to the citizens the governor informed guests of significant events in France as well as the state of affairs within the colony. In turn, the settlers were expected to renew their pledges of allegiance to the Crown.

The levée tradition was continued by British colonial governors in Canada and subsequently by both the governor general and lieutenant governors. It continues to the present day.

As mentioned, the levée was historically a male preserve but during World War II levées were attended by female officers of the armed forces. Since then levees have been open to both women and men.

==Present day==

Over the years, New Year&#x27;s levées have become almost solely a Canadian observance, although kinds of levées still exist in other countries.

Today, levées are the receptions (usually, but not necessarily, on New Year&#x27;s Day) held by the governor-general, the lieutenant governors of the provinces, the military and others, to mark the start of another year and to provide an opportunity for the public to pay their respects.

Most levées may be attended by any citizen, including children.
Attending the lieutenant governor&#x27;s levée is an annual ritual for some families.

Today the levée has evolved from the earlier, more boisterous party into a more sedate and informal one. It is an occasion to call upon representatives of the monarch, military and municipal governments and to exchange New Year&#x27;s greetings and best wishes for the new year, to renew old acquaintances and to meet new friends. It is also an opportunity to reflect upon the events of the past year and to welcome the opportunities of the New Year.

The province of Prince Edward Island maintains a more historical approach to celebrating levee day. On New Year&#x27;s Day, all Legions and bars are opened and offer moose milk (eggnog and rum) from the early morning until the late night. Though there are still the formal receptions held at Government House and Province House, levée day is not only a formal event. It is something that attracts a large number of Islanders, which is quite unusual in comparison to the other provinces where it has gradually become more subdued. Prince Edward Island levées begin at 8 a.m.

The historic town of Niagara-on-the-Lake (the first capital of Upper Canada) holds a levée complete with firing of a cannon at Navy Hall (a historic building close to Fort George) The levée is well attended by townspeople and visitors. Toasts are made to the King, &quot;our beloved Canada&quot;, the Canadian Armed Forces, veterans, &quot;our fallen comrades&quot;, as well as &quot;our American friends and neighbours&quot; (this final toast would not have been made two centuries ago when the town was founded). Greetings are brought from all levels of government and it is a great community event.

Some religious leaders, such as the Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of Ontario, hold a levée on New Year&#x27;s Day.

===Refreshments===

As has the levée itself, refreshments served at levées have undergone changes (both in importance and variety) over the years.

In colonial times, when the formalities of the levée had been completed, guests were treated to wine and cheeses from the homeland. Wines did not travel well during the long ocean voyage to Canada. To make the cloudy and somewhat sour wine more palatable it was heated with alcohol and spices. The concoction came to be known as (&quot;caribou blood&quot;).

Under British colonial rule, the wine in was replaced with whisky (which travelled better). This was then mixed with goat&#x27;s milk and flavoured with nutmeg and cinnamon to produce an Anglicized version called &quot;moose milk&quot;. Today&#x27;s versions of moose milk, in addition to whisky (or rum) and spices may use a combination of eggnog and ice cream, as well as other alcoholic supplements. The exact recipes used by specific groups may be jealously guarded secrets.

Refreshments were clearly an important element in the New Year&#x27;s festivities. A report of the New Year&#x27;s levée held in Brandon House in Manitoba in 1797 indicated that &quot;&quot;... in the morning the Canadians (men of the North West Company) make the House and Yard ring with saluting (the firing of rifles). The House then filled with them when they all got a dram each&quot;.&quot; Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Athabasca Journal&quot; reports that on January 1, 1821, &quot; the Festivities of the New Year commenced at four o&#x27;clock this morning when the people honored me with a salute of firearms, and in half an hour afterward the whole Inmates of our Garrison assembled in the hall dressed out in their best clothes, and were regaled in a suitable manner with a few flagon&#x27;s Rum and some Cakes. A full allowance of Buffaloe meat was served out to them and a pint of spirits for each man; the Women were also entertained to the utmost of our ability.&quot;

When residents called upon the governor to pay their respects they expected a party. In 1856 on Vancouver Island, there was &quot;an almighty row&quot; when the colonial governor&#x27;s levée was not to the attendees&#x27; liking.

==Military levées==

The levée has a long tradition in the Canadian Armed Forces as one of the activities associated with New Year&#x27;s Day. Military commanders garrisoned throughout Canada held local levées since, as commissioned officers, they were expected to act on behalf of the Crown on such occasions.

On Vancouver Island (the base for the Royal Navy&#x27;s Pacific Fleet), levées began in the 1840s.

Today, members of the various Canadian Forces units and headquarters
across Canada receive and greet visiting military and civilian guests
on the first day of the new year.

In military messes, refreshments take a variety of forms: moose milk (with rum often substituted for whisky); the special flaming punch of the Royal Canadian Hussars of Montreal; the Atholl brose of the Seaforth Highlanders of Vancouver; Little Black Devil cocktails (dark rum and crème de menthe) of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles. Members of Le Régiment de Hull use sabres to uncork bottles of champagne.

== Other countries ==
A similar event is held each year at Christiansborg Palace by the Danish monarch.

==Fictional references==

In literary fiction, levées form an important background to plot development in Neal Stephenson&#x27;s Baroque Cycle trilogy.

<text>AMX International Ltd was a joint venture company established to develop, manufacture and market the AMX ground attack aircraft.

Established during the late 1970s specifically to produce the AMX, the company initially comprised Italian aircraft manufacturers Alenia and Aermacchi. During the early 1980s, the Brazilian aviation company Embraer became a member of AMX International after Brazil&#x27;s government opted to become involved in the project. The company&#x27;s headquarters were located in Rome. The first Italian-assembled prototype performed its maiden flight on 15 May 1984; the first Brazilian-assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. Deliveries of production commenced during 1988; the final aircraft was assembled during 1999.

==History==
AMX International can trace its routes back to a decision taken during the late 1970s by two rival Italian aircraft manufacturers Alenia and Aermacchi to mutually cooperate in the development of a new ground attack aircraft. This enterprise had been stimulated by the release of a requirement by the Italian Air Force for 187 new-build strike fighters, primarily to replace its existing inventory of Aeritalia G.91s in the close air support and reconnaissance missions. Prior to their agreement to collaborate, both firms had already independently considered developing a similar class of combat aircraft. During April 1978, development work on the joint venture formally commenced.

During 1980, the Brazilian government announced that they intended to participate in the program in order to provide a replacement for the Aermacchi MB-326. In July 1981, the Italian and Brazilian governments agreed on joint requirements for the aircraft; shortly thereafter, the Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer was invited to join the industrial partnership. An agreement was also struck to divide AMX manufacturing between the partners; for each production aircraft, Aeritalia manufactured 46.5 per cent of the components (central fuselage, stabilisers and rudders), Aermacchi produced 22.8 per cent (front fuselage and tail cone), and Embraer performed 29.7 per cent of the work (wing, air intakes, pylons and drop tanks). There was no duplication of work, each component of the aircraft was built at one source only. The planned requirements were 187 aircraft for Italy and 100 for Brazil.

A total of seven flight-capable prototypes were produced for the test program, three by Aeritalia, two by Aermacchi, and two by Embraer, as well as two static airframes. The first prototype, assembled in Italy, made its maiden flight on 15 May 1984. This first aircraft was lost on its fifth flight in an accident, resulting in the death of its pilot. Aside from this early loss, testing progressed smoothly and without further incident. The first Brazilian-assembled prototype made its first flight on 16 October 1985. On 11 May 1988, the first production aircraft performed its first flight. Deliveries of production aircraft to Italy began in 1988, the first examples were delivered to the Brazilian Air Force during the following year. On 14 March 1990, the prototype two-seat AMX made its first flight.

Despite the pooling of manufacturing work, Brazilian and Italian aircraft differ considerably in their avionics; Italian AMXs are equipped with various NATO systems which were considered redundant in the South American theatre. Furthermore, AMXs in Brazilian service are typically fitted with one of three pallet-mounted sensor packages, which contain various vertical, oblique, and forward-facing cameras, for performing the aircraft&#x27;s secondary aerial reconnaissance role. A simple ranging radar is equipped for targeting purposes, however the specific radar also differs between both operators. While Italian aircraft are fitted with a M61 Vulcan 20 mm rotary cannon on the port side of the lower fuselage, the United States denied the sale of the M61 to Brazil, thus its AMXs are instead fitted with two 30 mm DEFA 554 revolver cannons.

<text>(&quot;The Circus Princess&quot;) is an operetta in three acts by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán to a German libretto by Julius Brammer and Alfred Grünwald. It premiered at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna on 26 March 1926 and went on to 344 performances there.

==Synopsis==

The plot revolves around a romantic intrigue with interpolated circus sequences. The mysterious &quot;Mister X&quot;, a dashing circus performer, is hired by a disappointed suitor of Princess Fedora Palinska to pose as a nobleman and marry her. &quot;Mister X&quot; is in fact a nobleman, the disinherited nephew of a deceased prince. One of the work&#x27;s most well-known arias, &quot;&quot; (Two fairy-tale eyes), has been recorded by several famous tenors, including Fritz Wunderlich, Charles Kullman, and Richard Tauber.

==International productions==

The operetta was swiftly performed in Hungary, in an adaptation by Ernő Kulinyi and Imre Liptai, at the Király Színház in Budapest, on 24 September 1926. Productions in Sweden (Stockholm, Vasa-Teatern, October 6, 1926); Germany (Hamburg, Operetten-Teater, October 17, 1926), and - as &quot;Mister X&quot; - in Russia (Moscow, November 23, 1926). There were also productions during 1926 in Czechoslovakia, Italy, Finland and Poland.

An English language version, &quot;The Circus Princess&quot;, adapted by Harry B. Smith - first seen at the Apollo Theatre, Atlantic City, on April 4, 1927 - enjoyed a successful run at the Winter Garden Theatre in New York City from 25 April 1927 starring Guy Robertson, Desiree Tabor, and Robert O&#x27;Connor. The circus sequences in the American production were particularly lavish, including equestrians, aerialists, and a famous clown of the day, Poodles Hanneford. The show was staged by J. C. Huffman.

<text>Die Herzogin von Chicago (&quot;The Duchess of Chicago&quot;) is an operetta in two acts, a prologue, and an epilogue. The music was composed by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán with a libretto by Julius Brammer and Alfred Grünwald. It premiered in Vienna at the Theater an der Wien on April 5, 1928, and played for 372 performances. The work was presented in out-of-town tryouts in Newark, New Jersey and Springfield, Massachusetts by the Shuberts in 1929, but it did not make it to Broadway. The piece was forgotten until 1997, when the Lubo Opera Company performed it in concert in New York, after which Light Opera Works of Illinois performed the work in 1998 in a fully staged version with a new translation by Philip Kraus and Gregory Opelka. In 1999, Richard Bonynge made a recording of the work, which revived international interest in it.

The operetta mingles jazz elements and other contemporary dance music with musical elements traditionally associated with Viennese waltz-opera and anticipates such works as &quot;White Horse Inn&quot; and Paul Abraham&#x27;s &quot;Victoria and Her Hussar&quot;. The score also incorporates traditions from Kálmán&#x27;s native Hungary. The libretto has a relatively modern satirical edge and draws on the political Kabarett that was a feature of radical Vienna, Berlin and Munich at the time. The piece directly addresses the impact of America and its social revolution, with its commentary on current affairs as seen in the jazz scene in Chicago. The piece reveals much about early 20th century European culture and European intellectual attitudes toward Americans, and American culture. The setting and score call for 1920s flapper costumes, jazz and the Charleston.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
The story revolves around Miss Mary Lloyd, who makes a bet with her fawning circle of girlfriends, the &quot;Eccentric Young Ladies Club&quot;, as to which of them can buy the most expensive thing in Europe, because they are so wealthy that they can buy anything. Meanwhile, back in the bankrupt state of Sylvaria, Prince Sándor Boris and his ministers are trying to keep the natives happy while the king is off to Monte Carlo. Then, as now, there is nothing like a royal wedding to please the locals. The prince makes a marriage pact with his old pal, Princess Rosemarie of Morenia, but there is no love between them.

Mary arrives in Budapest, where she meets who she thinks is the prince, while the real prince has been pretending to be an aide-de-camp. She, of course, prefers the aide, and there is chemistry between them at the nightclub, though the prince prefers Viennese waltzes, and Mary prefers the Charleston. Later, in Sylvaria, Mary arranges to buy the royal palace, and is shocked to learn the true identity of her friend the &quot;aide&quot;. She decides that, having bought the palace, she must also have &quot;the prince that goes with it&quot;.

Bondy and the prince&#x27;s promised bride fall in love and, despite themselves, Mary and the prince do so, too, though they still debate the relative merits of their favorite dances. But when the prince reads a letter that Mary wrote to her father, he gets the impression that she is merely buying him, and goes back to his older engagement.

Back in Budapest, we learn that Bondy and Princess Rosemarie have eloped. The King of Sylvaria arrives with two Parisian floozies and tries to romance Mary (Sylvaria needs her money), but she, though amused, is not interested. But everything is saved when an American producer announces that he wants to make a movie about Mary and the prince, but cannot do so until the story has a genuine, American-style happy ending. The two compromise on a slow foxtrot.

<text>A phaeton (also phaéton) was a form of sporty open carriage popular in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century. Drawn by one or two horses, a phaeton typically featured a minimal very lightly sprung body atop four extravagantly large wheels. With open seating, it was both fast and dangerous, giving rise to its name, drawn from the mythical Phaëthon, son of Helios, who nearly set the Earth on fire while attempting to drive the chariot of the Sun.

With the advent of the automobile, the term was adopted to refer to open touring cars, which were in consequence referred to as phaeton-bodied.

==Types==

The most impressive but dangerous phaeton was the four-wheeled &#x27;high-flyer&#x27;, the body of which consisted of a light seat perched above two sets of springs. It was from one of these that the rising poet Thomas Warwick was thrown to his death near the fashionable town of Bath during the 1780s. There was also the heavier mail phaeton used chiefly to carry passengers with luggage and named after its construction, using &quot;mail&quot; springs originally designed for use on mail coaches. The spider phaeton, of American origin and made for gentlemen drivers, was a high and lightly constructed carriage with a covered seat in front and a footman&#x27;s seat behind. Fashionable phaetons used at horse shows included the Stanhope, typically having a high seat and closed back, and the Tilbury, a two-wheeled carriage with an elaborate spring suspension system, with or without a top. A variation of this type of a carriage is called a &quot;Victoria&quot;, with a retractable cover over the rear passenger compartment.

==Use==
Thomas Jefferson owned two phaetons. Jefferson and James Madison rode in Jefferson&#x27;s phaeton during their tour of the Northeast in 1791, a total of 920 miles. They were accompanied by James Hemings.

Queen Victoria was particularly associated with the phaeton and there are prints and photos of her driving in them both before and throughout her reign. Its openness put her in danger and there were assassination attempts made on her life while in one by Edward Oxford in 1840 and by Henry Holford in 1846. In her later years she enjoyed travelling in a phaeton drawn by a single donkey or mule, and there are examples of this type in the Royal Collection. 

Another was put to use by Queen Elizabeth II each June from 1978 to 2011 during the official Queen&#x27;s Birthday celebrations, when she travelled to and from Trooping the Colour on Horse Guards Parade in an ivory-mounted phaeton carriage made in 1842 for her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria.

A social statement of a different kind was made during the 1880s by Valerie, Lady Meux, who defied London Society by driving herself in a high phaeton drawn by zebras. Yet another was the use of such carriages by revolutionaries to carry out the 1907 Tiflis bank robbery.

<doc id="911086" wikidata="Q3707041" url="?curid=911086" title="Die Bajadere (polka)">
<text>&quot;Die Bajadere&quot; is one of Johann Strauss II&#x27;s polkas, Op. 351. A &quot;bajadere&quot; was a temple dancer in the European vision of legendary India being popularized by the first translations of Indian classic literature into European languages. The European view melded all the world east of Suez into an exotic locale. The themes of &quot;Die Bajadere&quot; were drawn from the score of Strauss&#x27;s first operetta, &quot;Indigo und die vierzig Räuber&quot; (&quot;Indigo and the Forty Thieves&quot;), loosely based on the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, which premiered in 1871 at the Theater an der Wien in Vienna.

&#x27;Die Bajadere&#x27; begins in the key of A major and has two complete sections in the same key before a brief Intrada heralds the Trio section of the work. The Trio section, in D major is heavily accented in the 1st part but is more lyrical in the second. After a general repeat of the same A major 1st part and its successive 2nd one, the polka proceeds into a frenzy, heavily-chorded phrase with an abrupt conclusion, all in the home key.

The work has been performed at two editions of the Neujahrskonzert of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra: first time being the 2005 edition conducted by Lorin Maazel and second time as the first encore of the 2025 edition conducted by Riccardo Muti.

Marius Petipa&#x27;s ballet &quot;La Bayadère&quot; premiered at the Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, February 4, 1877.

<text>Das Veilchen vom Montmartre (&quot;The Violet of Montmartre&quot;) is an operetta in 3 acts by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán. The libretto was written by Julius Brammer and Alfred Grünwald. It premiered in Vienna at the Johann Strauss Theater on 21 March 1930.

==Roles==
==&quot;A Kiss in Spring&quot;==
For the 1932 performances at the Alhambra Theatre in London the title was changed to &quot;A Kiss in Spring&quot; and the score was re-worked and supplemented by Herbert Griffiths (who had previously worked on the English adaption of &quot;Walzer aus Wien&quot;). There were additional orchestrations by a distinguished set of musicians: Constant Lambert, Arthur Wood, Alfred Reynolds and Walford Hyden. The choreography was by Frederick Ashton and the dancers included a young Alicia Markova as well as Harold Turner, Walter Gore and Prudence Hyman.

====Deluxe edition singles====
* &quot;Busy Child (Sta Remix)&quot; is the first and only one of two official singles released from &quot;Vegas (Deluxe Edition)&quot;. This is one of the better-known remixes from the album. After the release of &quot;Vegas (Deluxe Edition)&quot;, the Crystal Method posted it on their Myspace page, and it remains there today. The single was released on August 28, 2007.
* &quot;High Roller (Myagi Remix)&quot; is another popular remix from &quot;Vegas (Deluxe Edition)&quot;. Despite its popularity, it has not been released as a single. The song is known for being used in the trailer for the movie &quot;Push&quot;. On an internet poll in early 2009, people were asked which of the remixes from &quot;Vegas&quot; was their favorite. &quot;High Roller (Myagi Remix)&quot; won by a landslide. On the same site that conducted the poll (http://www.thecrystalmethod.org), a contest was set up to ask questions to Myagi himself by the public. He would choose what he thought were the best questions and use those in the interview. People selected could get a chance to get special prizes, like an autographed copy of Myagi&#x27;s recent album, &quot;3 Years of Sunrise&quot;. Even people who submitted questions were put into a drawing for prizes. &quot;High Roller (Myagi Remix)&quot; was also the only other remix from &quot;Vegas (Deluxe Edition)&quot; to be put on the band&#x27;s Myspace page after the release of the album, besides &quot;Busy Child (Sta Remix)&quot;. Like &quot;Busy Child (Sta Remix)&quot;, the song &quot;High Roller (Myagi Remix)&quot; remains on the band&#x27;s Myspace today.
* &quot;Cherry Twist (deadmau5 Remix)&quot; is the second official remix single released from &quot;Vegas (Deluxe Edition)&quot;, remixed by deadmau5.

==Artists==
*All production and mixing by the Crystal Method (Scott Kirkland and Ken Jordan).
*All tracks written and composed by Scott Kirkland and Ken Jordan, except &quot;Comin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;Jaded&quot;, which were also co-written by Trudie &quot;Trixie&quot; Reiss.
*Vocals on &quot;Comin&#x27; Back&quot; and &quot;Jaded&quot; are performed by Trixie Reiss.

<text>:&quot;See also The Gay Hussar restaurant, and Tatárjárás (disambiguation)&quot;

The Gay Hussars is an operetta in three acts composed by Emmerich Kálmán. The piece was Kalman&#x27;s first operetta and a hit throughout Europe and America. The first version, in Hungarian, Tatárjárás, with libretto by Karl von Bakonyi and Andor Gábor, premiered at the Vígszinház in Budapest on 22 February 1908. The German version, Ein Herbstmanöver, with libretto by K. von Bakonyi and Robert Bodanzky, premiered in Vienna on 22 January 1909. It was so popular there that it prompted Kalman to move to Vienna.

== English adaptations ==
Its New York premiere, as &quot;The Gay Hussars&quot;, adapted by Maurice Brown Kirby with lyrics by Grant Stewart, was at the Knickerbocker Theatre on 29 July 1909 with W. H. Denny. Another English adaptation played in London as Autumn Manoeuvres, opening in 1912 at the Adelphi Theatre with Robert Evett. The piece then toured in Britain.

== Selected recordings ==
A version of &quot;Autumn Manoeuvers&quot; was recorded in 2003 by Ohio Light Opera.

<text>Zsuzsi kisasszony (literally &quot;Miss Suzy&quot;, also known as &quot;Miss Springtime&quot; and &quot;Die Faschingsfee&quot;) is an operetta in 3 acts by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán. It premiered at the Vig theatre in Budapest on February 23, 1915. The Hungarian language libretto was by Martos and M. Bródy. As &quot;Miss Springtime&quot;, it opened, in heavily revised form, on Broadway in 1916.

With a German libretto by Alfred Maria Willner and Rudolf Österreicher, a revised version of the music premiered as &quot;Die Faschingsfee&quot; (&quot;The Carnival Fairy&quot;) in Vienna, at the Johann Strauss Theater, on 21 September 1917. A further revision of &quot;Die Faschingsfee&quot; was done for Berlin, with a larger role for the leading lady, and it is the Berlin version that is most often seen today. In 2012, an English translation of the Berlin version was done at the Ohio Light Opera under the title &quot;Miss Springtime&quot;, but the recording made of that production was eventually released in 2013 under the title &quot;The Carnival Fairy&quot;.

==Roles in &quot;Zsuzsi Kisasszony&quot;==
==Roles in &quot;Die Faschingsfee&quot;==
==Synopses==
The plot of &quot;Zsuzsi Kisasszony&quot; concerns Zsuzsi, a small-town girl who runs off to Budapest with Falsetti, a famous tenor, only to return, somewhat the wiser, to her old home and Péterfy, her old sweetheart.

The plot of &quot;Die Faschingsfee&quot; revolves around an artist, Victor, who in defending the honor of an unknown woman (Princess Alexandra Maria, as it turns out) offends his patron and loses a large stipend. In the end, all comes out right.

<doc id="911127" wikidata="Q1093440" url="?curid=911127" title="Australian Citizens Party">
<text>The Australian Citizens Party (ACP), formerly the Citizens Electoral Council of Australia (CEC), is a minor political party in Australia affiliated with the international LaRouche Movement which was led by American political activist and conspiracy theorist Lyndon LaRouche.

The party has pushed conspiracy theories, including that international action on climate change and indigenous land rights are part of a conscious fraud masterminded by Prince Philip, as part of the British Royal Family’s scheme to depopulate the planet. It ‘believes Prince Philip is trying to break up nation-states through the World Wide Fund for Nature and is involved in a &quot;racist plot to splinter Australia&quot;’.

Founded in 1988, the party has been led by Craig Isherwood ever since.

== History ==
The original CEC was established in 1988 by residents of the Kingaroy region of Queensland. CEC candidate Trevor Perrett won the 1988 Barambah state by-election in Queensland, after former Queensland Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen resigned from State Parliament in 1987. However, Perrett switched to the National Party in December 1988. Members of the Australian League of Rights, an extreme right-wing group led by Eric Butler, tried unsuccessfully to take over the new party. Its purpose was to lobby for binding voter-initiated referendums.

By 1989, the CEC leadership was under the influence of the Lyndon LaRouche movement. By 1992, the CEC identified itself as the Australian branch of the broad international LaRouche movement. National Secretary Craig Isherwood moved the headquarters from rural Queensland to a Melbourne suburb, with direct communications links to LaRouche&#x27;s US headquarters established.

In 1996, then-Liberal Party MP Ken Aldred, was disendorsed by the Liberal Party after using parliamentary privilege to make allegations of involvement in espionage and drug trafficking against a prominent Jewish lawyer and a senior foreign affairs official, using documents that were later found to be forged, supplied to him by the CEC.

In 2004, the CEC received the largest contribution of any political party, $862,000 from a central Queensland cattle farmer and former CEC candidate named Ray Gillham. The party collected $2.3 million in donations in 2020-21. The party’s leader is National Secretary and National Treasurer Craig Isherwood of Melbourne, who has been an election candidate for the party numerous times.

== Platform ==
The ACP, citing historic figure King O&#x27;Malley as inspiration, lobbied for &quot;the establishment of a National Bank and State Banks to provide loans at 2% or less to agriculture (family farms), industry and for infrastructure development&quot;, launching a petition in 2002 to drive support with a full page advertisement in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper. In early 2008 the CEC started campaigning for a &quot;Bank Homeowners Protection Bill of 2008&quot;, calling for legislation in the spirit of the Australian moratorium laws enacted in the 1920s and 1930s.

The party follows the LaRouche line of denying the theory of anthropogenic global warming; it claimed in 2009 that the Copenhagen Summit, a climate conference occurring that year, was planning &quot;massive population genocide‚ on a scale that would make Adolf Hitler blush&quot; and the establishment of a &quot;world government&quot;. The party espouses the claim that the Port Arthur massacre, in which Martin Bryant murdered 35 people and injured 37 others, was instigated by mental health institute the Tavistock Institute on the orders of the royal family, and that the Australian Liberal Party was founded by pro-Hitler fascists.

The CEC&#x27;s policies have included introducing a national Glass-Steagall Act to &quot;break up the banks&quot;, establishing a national bank, introducing a moratorium on home &amp; farm foreclosures, constructing high speed rail and the Bradfield Scheme, joining China&#x27;s Belt and Road Initiative, shutting down Pine Gap and opposing the existence of climate change among others.

== Criticism ==
The Anti-Defamation Commission of the Australian branch of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith (an international Jewish organisation) has published a Briefing Paper with details of the CEC&#x27;s alleged antisemitic, anti-gay, anti-Aboriginal and racist underpinnings. The document cites CEC publications and quotes former CEC members. The CEC in turn published a response to the ADC&#x27;s stating it was an antiracist organisation. 

Former members of the CEC and families of current members have accused the group of &quot;brainwashing&quot; members and engaging in campaigns involving &quot;dirty tricks&quot;. For example, former CEC staffer Donald Veitch has claimed that new recruits undergo &quot;deprogramming sessions&quot; and that recruits are probed for sexual peccadilloes. Veitch has stated: &quot;The mind control operations commenced by Lyndon LaRouche in the USA in the mid-1970s are still being practised today within his movement in Australia&quot;.

== Electoral results ==

Despite running in &quot;almost every election of the past two decades&quot;, in no election has the CEC ever garnered more than 2% of the vote.

At the 2007 federal election, the CEC&#x27;s previous form continued. Its first preference votes in the lower house was 27,879 (0.22%), and 8,677 (0.07%) in the upper house, both results were 0.14% down from 2004.

At the 2016 federal election, CEC fielded senate candidates in every state and the Northern Territory and seven candidates for seats in the House of Representatives. Nationally, the party received 5,175 votes (0.04%) in the lower house and 9,850 votes (0.07%) in the upper house.

<doc id="911131" wikidata="Q3772686" url="?curid=911131" title="Racial integration">
<text>Racial integration, or simply integration, includes desegregation (the process of ending systematic racial segregation), leveling barriers to association, creating equal opportunity regardless of race, and the development of a culture that draws on diverse traditions, rather than merely bringing a racial minority into the majority culture. Desegregation is largely a legal matter, integration largely a social one.

==Distinguishing &quot;integration&quot; from &quot;desegregation&quot;==

Morris J. MacGregor Jr. in his paper &quot;Integration of the Armed Forces 1940–1969&quot;, writes concerning the words &quot;integration&quot; and &quot;desegregation&quot;:

In recent years many historians have come to distinguish between these like-sounding words... The movement toward desegregation, breaking down the nation&#x27;s Jim Crow system, became increasingly popular in the decade after World War II. Integration, on the other hand, Professor Oscar Handlin maintains, implies several things not yet necessarily accepted in all areas of American society. In one sense it refers to the &quot;levelling of all barriers to association other than those based on ability, taste, and personal preference&quot;; in other words, providing equal opportunity. But in another sense integration calls for the random distribution of a minority throughout society. Here, according to Handlin, the emphasis is on racial balance in areas of occupation, education, residency, and the like.

From the beginning the military establishment rightly understood that the breakup of the all-black unit would in a closed society necessarily mean more than mere desegregation. It constantly used the terms integration and equal treatment and opportunity to describe its racial goals. Rarely, if ever, does one find the word desegregation in military files that include much correspondence.

Similarly, Keith M. Woods writes on the need for precision in journalistic language: &quot;&quot;Integration&quot; happens when a monolith is changed, like when a black family moves into an all-white neighborhood. Integration happens even without a mandate from the law. &quot;Desegregation&quot;,&quot; on the other hand, &quot;was the legal remedy to segregation.&quot; In 1997, Henry Organ, who identified himself as &quot;a participant in the Civil Rights Movement on the (San Francisco) Peninsula in the &#x27;60s ... and ... an African American,&quot; wrote that the &quot;term &#x27;desegregation&#x27; is normally reserved to the legal/legislative domain, and it was the legalization of discrimination in public institutions based on race that many fought against in the 1960s. The term &#x27;integration,&#x27; on the other hand, pertains to a social domain; it does and should refer to individuals of different background who opt to interact.&quot;

In their book &quot;By the Color of Our Skin&quot; (1999) Leonard Steinhorn and Barbara Diggs-Brown also make a similar distinction between &quot;desegregation&quot; and &quot;integration&quot;. They write &quot;... television has ... give[n] white Americans the sensation of having meaningful, repeated contact with blacks without actually having it. We call this phenomenon virtual integration, and it is the primary reason why the integration illusion – the belief that we are moving toward a colorblind nation – has such a powerful influence on race relations in America today.&quot; Reviewing this book in the libertarian magazine &quot;Reason&quot;, Michael W. Lynch sums up some of their conclusions as &quot;Blacks and whites live, learn, work, pray, play, and entertain separately...&quot; Then, he writes: 
The problem, as I see it, is that access to the public spheres, specifically the commercial sphere, often depends on being comfortable with the norms of white society. If a significant number of black children aren&#x27;t comfortable with them, it isn&#x27;t by choice: It&#x27;s because they were isolated from those norms. It&#x27;s one thing for members of the black elite and upper middle class to choose to retire to predominantly black neighborhoods after a lucrative day&#x27;s work in white America. It&#x27;s quite another for people to be unable to enter that commercial sphere because they spent their formative years in a community that didn&#x27;t, or couldn&#x27;t, prepare them for it. Writes [Harvard University sociologist Orlando] Patterson, &quot;The greatest problem now facing African-Americans is their isolation from the tacit norms of the dominant culture, and this is true of all classes.&quot;
===Distinction not universally accepted===
Although widespread, the distinction between &quot;integration&quot; and &quot;desegregation&quot; is not universally accepted. For example, it is possible to find references to &quot;court-ordered integration&quot; from sources such as the &quot;Detroit News&quot;, PBS, or even Encarta.
These same sources also use the phrase &quot;court-ordered desegregation&quot;, apparently with exactly the same meaning; the &quot;Detroit News&quot; uses both expressions interchangeably in the same article.

When the two terms are confused, it is almost always to use &quot;integration&quot; in the narrower, more legalistic sense of &quot;desegregation&quot;; one rarely, if ever, sees &quot;desegregation&quot; used in the broader cultural sense.

<doc id="911132" wikidata="Q4638057" url="?curid=911132" title="Arizona Lady">
<text>Arizona Lady is an operetta in two acts by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán. The libretto was written by Alfred Grünwald and Gustav Beer. Left unfinished at the time of Kálmán&#x27;s death in 1953, the score was completed by his son, Charles Kálmán. The story concerns Lona, a charming Hungarian immigrant, now a rancher. She hires a new ranch foreman, Roy, a cowboy with a questionable past. Roy is reluctant to work for a woman but intrigued by her prize racehorse, Arizona Lady; the two inevitably fall in love, but many complications ensue. 

The piece premiered as a broadcast in Munich on 1 January 1954, and on stage in Bern, at the Stadttheater, on 14 February 1954. Arizona Lady&#x27;s American premiere was directed by Bill Walters, with a new English translation by Gerald Frantzen and Hersh Glagov, by Chicago Folks Operetta in July 2010, at Stage 773 in Chicago, Illinois. Arizona Opera mounted a production in 2015, and Ohio Light Opera performed it several times in the summer of 2023.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
In 1920s Arizona, a Hungarian woman, Lona Farrell, whose father had emigrated to the US to search for gold, now runs the Sunshine Ranch. She fires her foreman, Jim Slaughter, for having tried to kiss her, and hires a stranger, Roy Dexter from Colorado, despite the concerns of Sheriff Harry Sullivan, who suspects that &quot;Roy Dexter&quot; may actually be the notorious outlaw, Burt Morton. But there is one condition on Roy&#x27;s employment; he must never even mention the word &quot;love&quot; to Lona; she&#x27;s had enough of that. Despite that, the sexual tension between Lona and Roy is manifest from the beginning. Roy is reluctant to work for a woman but is intrigued by Lona and her prize racehorse, Arizona Lady.

Arizona Lady is a temperamental filly owned by Lona, and part of the foreman&#x27;s job is to ride her at the big race in the Arizona State Fair. Roy succeeds in taming Arizona Lady, but is thrown in the race because the girth of his saddle has been cut by Jim Slaughter, who wins the race riding Mexican Cavalier, owned by the wealthy Lopez Ibanez. As a result of a bet on the race, Lona is now engaged to Sheriff Sullivan. At their engagement party, Bonita, a hired dancer from the Paradise Bar, identifies Roy as Burt Morton, and Roy is carted off to jail as news arrives that Arizona Lady has been stolen.

Meanwhile, Nellie Nettleton, proprietor of a mobile general store, meets young Chester Kingsbury, Jr., the son of a meat-packing millionaire who has sent him to the Sunshine Ranch to toughen him up. They deal with money troubles and with problems caused by Nellie&#x27;s sister, Magnolia, who has told her fiancé that her Magnolia&#x27;s illegitimate baby is really Nellie&#x27;s.

In jail, Roy meets the drunken vagabond Algernon Galahed Bentschley, who leads him to a tunnel he has dug that leads, not only out of the jail, but across the border into Mexico. They proceed to the Paradise Bar, which straddles the border; on the left side, there is Prohibition, on the right, Mexico and freedom. The Sheriff turns up, and Roy says he will cross the line back into Arizona to surrender to him, but only if he can have ten minutes to speak to Lona alone. He explains that his name truly is not &quot;Roy Dexter&quot;—but it is not &quot;Burt Morton&quot;, either. He is really known as the &quot;Colorado Kid&quot;, and he has long been pursuing Burt Morton, who killed his father. The Sheriff reenters, and tells Roy that he is free to go, that Jim Slaughter, who was the real Burt Morton, has been arrested, along with Sr. Ibanez, and that Arizona Lady has been recovered. Lona asks Roy to stay, but he says that he wants no payment or reward, but that if there is one thing he wants to take away from the Sunshine Ranch, it is Arizona Lady. She agrees to let the filly go.

Three months later, Lona and her entourage visit Kentucky, where the Derby is about to run. Lona and the Sheriff are not married yet, but they make another bet; if Arizona Lady wins this time, Lona will marry the Sheriff at once. The horse does indeed win, but Sheriff Sullivan, recognizing that Lona is really in love with &quot;Roy&quot;, declares that the wedding will go on, with a slight change of bridegroom.

<doc id="911134" wikidata="Q2174811" url="?curid=911134" title="Rufus W. Peckham">
<text>Rufus W. Peckham (November 8, 1838 – October 24, 1909) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1896 to 1909, and is the most recent Democratic nominee approved by a Republican-majority Senate. He was known for his strong use of substantive due process to invalidate regulations of business and property. Peckham&#x27;s namesake father was also a lawyer and judge, and a U.S. Representative. His older brother, Wheeler Hazard Peckham (1833–1905), was one of the lawyers who prosecuted William M. Tweed and a failed nominee to the Supreme Court.

==Biography==
Peckham was born in Albany, New York, to Rufus Wheeler Peckham and Isabella Adeline Lacey; his mother died when he was only nine. Following his graduation from The Albany Academy, he followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps as a lawyer, being admitted to the bar in Albany in 1859 after teaching himself law by studying in his father&#x27;s office. After a decade of private practice, Peckham served as the Albany district attorney from 1869 to 1872. Peckham then returned to private legal practice and served as counsel to the City of Albany, until being elected as a trial judge on the New York Supreme Court in 1883. In 1886, Peckham was elected to the New York Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. While sitting as an associate judge on the Court of Appeals, Peckham also served as a member of the Albany Law School Board of Trustees. His appointment to the New York Court of Appeals was the third position that Peckham had held after his father, who had also served as the Albany D.A., on the New York Supreme Court, and finally on the Court of Appeals until his death in the 1873 &quot;Ville du Havre&quot; sinking.

Peckham was active in local Democratic politics, and served as a New York delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention. He was also a confidant to such tycoons as J. Pierpont Morgan, Cornelius Vanderbilt, and John D. Rockefeller. Many believed these relationships predisposed Peckham to favor business interests while on the Supreme Court.
Rufus Peckham&#x27;s brother Wheeler was a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court by President Grover Cleveland, in 1894. However, this nomination was caught in the middle of a political tug-of-war between Cleveland and New York Senator David Hill, and Wheeler was the second nominee of Cleveland&#x27;s that Hill managed to block; Senator Edward Douglass White was instead confirmed to the Court. By the time another seat on the Court was vacant after the death of Howell Edmunds Jackson in 1895, Hill was weakened politically and Cleveland turned to Rufus Peckham, who was confirmed within six days on December of that year (by a Republican-controlled Senate). He was sworn into office on January 6, 1896. Peckham remains the last Supreme Court Justice seated by a Democratic president when the Senate had a Republican majority.

Peckham&#x27;s stint on the Court has been called by many scholars the height of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; constitutionalism, during which the Court regularly struck down efforts to regulate labor standards and relations. Peckham&#x27;s most famous opinion was his majority opinion in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; (1905), in which the Court invalidated a limitation on bakers&#x27; working hours to sixty per week as being contrary to the individual right to freely contract, and as being unnecessary to protect health or safety. In the same opinion, Peckham upheld other workplace regulations relating to baker&#x27;s facilities that he did believe justified limitations on the freedom of contract.
Beyond &quot;Lochner&quot;, Peckham is best known for expansively interpreting the Sherman Antitrust Act as prohibiting all restraints of trade, rather than only those already blocked under existing common law. His opinions on civil rights for African Americans are remarkable only for the abandonment of his usual anti-statism in voting to uphold Jim Crow laws–– the most notable being &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; (1896), in which he silently joined the majority. On the other hand, he and Justice David Josiah Brewer were far more likely than any of their colleagues to vote in favor of Chinese litigants in the many immigration cases that came before the Court.

Justice Peckham authored the landmark decision in &quot;Ex parte Young&quot; (1908), which held that a federal court may issue an injunction against a State officer to prevent the enforcement of an invalid State law.

Peckham served on the Court until his death from cardiovascular disease on October 24, 1909, at age 70, writing 303 opinions and dissenting only nine times. His death came during what biographer Willard King calls &quot;[p]erhaps the worst year in the history of the Court&quot; – the term from October 1909 to May 1910 – when two justices died, the other being David J. Brewer, and another justice, William Henry Moody, became fully incapacitated, while Chief Justice Melville Fuller&#x27;s health declined.

==Family and burial==
He was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York, later to be joined by his wife, Harriette Maria Arnold (December 13, 1839 - July 25, 1917). They outlived both of their sons: Henry Arnold (August 6, 1868 – February 16, 1907) and Rufus W. Jr. (January 28, 1870 – September 16, 1899). Mrs. Peckham was also the paternal aunt of heiress Dorothy Arnold, whose disappearance on December 12, 1910 was referenced, in 1928, as &quot;the great search of the age&quot; by United Press Associations (now UPI).

<doc id="911135" wikidata="Q1400307" url="?curid=911135" title="Mark Helprin">
<text>Mark Helprin (born June 28, 1947) is an American-Israeli novelist, journalist, conservative commentator, Senior Fellow of the Claremont Institute for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy, Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, and Member of the Council on Foreign Relations. While Helprin&#x27;s fictional works straddle a number of disparate genres and styles, he has stated that he &quot;belongs to no literary school, movement, tendency, or trend&quot;.

==Biography==
Helprin was born in Manhattan, New York City, in 1947. His father, Morris Helprin, worked in the film industry, eventually becoming president of London Films. His mother was actress Eleanor Lynn, who starred in several Broadway productions in the 1930s and 40s. In 1953 the family left New York City for the prosperous Hudson River valley suburb of Ossining, New York. He was raised on the Hudson River and was educated at the Scarborough School, graduating in 1965. He later lived in the British West Indies. Helprin holds degrees from Harvard University (B.A. 1969), and Harvard&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (M.A. 1972). Helprin&#x27;s postgraduate study was at Princeton University and Magdalen College, Oxford, University of Oxford, 1976–77. During the late 1970s, he became an Israeli citizen. He served in the Israeli infantry and the Israeli Air Force. Helprin is married to Lisa (Kennedy) Helprin. They have two daughters, Alexandra and Olivia. They live on a 56-acre farm in Earlysville, Virginia, and like his father and grandfather who had farms before him, Helprin does much of the work on his land.

==Novels, short stories and periodicals==
Helprin states that his literary creation &quot;always starts with something very small&quot;. &quot;I can sit down to write a story just by thinking of the first two words of a Scott Fitzgerald story: &#x27;This Jonquil&#x27;—it&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s name. This always gets me in the mood to write. We create nothing new—no one has ever imagined a new color—so what you are doing is revitalizing. You are remembering, then combining, altering. Artists who think they&#x27;re creating new worlds are simply creating tiny versions of this world.&quot; His inspirations include Dante, Shakespeare, Melville and Mark Twain.

His first novel, published in 1977, was &quot;Refiner&#x27;s Fire: The Life and Adventures of Marshall Pearl, a Foundling&quot;. The 1983 novel &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; is a sometimes fantastic tale of early 20th century life in New York City. He published &quot;A Soldier of the Great War&quot; in 1991. &quot;Memoir from Antproof Case&quot;, published in 1995, includes long comic diatribes against the effects of coffee. Helprin published &quot;Freddy and Fredericka&quot;, a satire based on Prince Charles and Princess Diana, in 2005. &quot;In Sunlight and in Shadow&quot; was released in 2012, and has been described as an extended love song to New York City. &quot;Paris In The Present Tense&quot; was published in 2017.

Helprin has published three books of short stories: &quot;A Dove of the East &amp; Other Stories&quot; (1975), &quot;Ellis Island &amp; Other Stories&quot; (1981), and &quot;The Pacific and Other Stories&quot; (2004). He has written three children&#x27;s books, all of which are illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg: &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;A City in Winter&quot;, and &quot;The Veil of Snows&quot;. His works have been translated into more than a dozen languages.

Helprin&#x27;s writing has appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for two decades. He writes essays and a column for the &quot;Claremont Review of Books&quot;. His writings, including political op-eds, have appeared in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; (for which he was a contributing editor until 2006), &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, &quot;National Review&quot;, &quot;American Heritage&quot;, and other publications.

==Controversy==
A 16 October 1992 article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; by Helprin is entitled &quot;I Dodged the Draft and I Was Wrong&quot;. Adapted from a speech he had given at West Point, he said his poor eyesight made him ineligible for service in the US military, but was no impediment to fighting in the Israeli Defense Force.

Helprin wrote an op-ed published in the May 20, 2007 issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, in which he argued that intellectual property rights should be assigned to an author or artist as far as Congress could practically extend them. The overwhelmingly negative response to his position in the blogosphere and elsewhere was reported on &quot;The New York Times&quot;″s blog the next day. Helprin was said to be shocked by the response.

In April 2009, HarperCollins published Helprin&#x27;s &quot;writer&#x27;s manifesto&quot;, &quot;Digital Barbarism&quot;. In May, Lawrence Lessig penned a review of the book entitled &quot;The Solipsist and the Internet&quot; in which he described the book as a response to the &quot;digital putdown&quot; heaped upon Helprin&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot; op-ed. Lessig called Helprin&#x27;s writing &quot;insanely sloppy&quot; and also criticized HarperCollins for publishing a book &quot;riddled with the most basic errors of fact.&quot;

In response to such criticisms, Helprin wrote a long defense of his book in the September 21, 2009 edition of &quot;National Review&quot;, which concluded: &quot;&quot;Digital Barbarism&quot; is not as much a defense of copyright as it is an attack upon a distortion of culture that has become a false savior in an age of many false saviors. Despite its lack of mechanical perfections, humanity, as stumbling and awkward as it is, is far superior to the machine. It always has been and always will be, and this conviction must never be surrendered. But surrender these days is incremental, seems painless, and comes so quietly that warnings are drowned in silence.&quot;

==Honors and accomplishments==
A Fellow of the American Academy in Rome and a former Guggenheim Fellow, Helprin has been awarded the National Jewish Book Award for &quot;Ellis Island and Other Stories&quot; and the Prix de Rome from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.

He is also a senior fellow at the Claremont Institute for the Study of Statesmanship and Political Philosophy. In 1996 he served as a foreign policy advisor and speechwriter to presidential candidate Bob Dole.

In May 2006, the &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; published a list of American novels, compiled from the responses to a short letter [from the NYT Book Review] to a couple of hundred prominent writers, critics, editors and other literary sages that asked them to identify the single best work of American fiction published in the last 25 years. Among the 22 books to have received multiple votes was Helprin&#x27;s &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

In 2006 Helprin received the Peggy V. Helmerich Distinguished Author Award. This award is presented annually by the Tulsa Library Trust.

On November 8, 2010, in New York City, Helprin was awarded the 2010 Salvatori Prize in the American Founding by the Claremont Institute.

&quot;A City in Winter&quot; won the World Fantasy Award for Best Novella in 1997.

Long Island&#x27;s only tertiary care and a Level 1 Adult and Pediatric Trauma Center, the hospital is ranked as the 12th best in New York and 10th in the New York metropolitan area by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The hospital campus also includes a rooftop helipad to better serve critical cases.

Stony Brook University Hospital has been named one of America’s 100 Best Hospitals by Healthgrades each year since 2019.

== History ==
In November 2008, Stony Brook University Hospital and Southampton Hospital announced that the New York State had approved a comprehensive alliance between the two health care facilities to bring new and strengthened clinical services to the South Fork of Suffolk County. Southampton Hospital was the third East End hospital (in addition to Peconic Bay Medical Center in Riverhead and Eastern Long Island Hospital in Greenport) to affiliate with SBUH.

As of January 2015, Stony Brook University Hospital and Southampton Hospital can move forward with a proposed affiliation agreement following a unanimous vote at the State University of New York (SUNY) Board of Trustees meeting in Albany. The two hospitals have been formally affiliated since 2008, as recommended by the Berger Commission Report issued by New York State Department of Health in 2006.

In June 2020, Stony Brook University Hospital was the site of a bomb threat when 33-year-old Robert Roden walked into the emergency room armed with three explosive devices, a pellet gun and a hatchet; an FBI search of his house discovered Roden&#x27;s bedroom was booby-trapped with explosives and contained numerous AR-15s. Roden was charged with second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, second-degree criminal contempt, and two counts of third-degree criminal possession of a controlled substance.

==About==

=== Education ===
The Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University is responsible for the preclinical and clinical education of medical students (current enrollment: 450). As the only School of Medicine in the region, it offers excellent research and clinical opportunities and has attracted a faculty of national and international renown. There are 21 residency training programs active in the School of Medicine, comprising over 500 full-time residents. Many of these residents also provide care at other nearby hospitals, including the VA Hospital at Northport, Winthrop-University Hospital, Eastern Long Island Hospital, Peconic Bay Medical Center, and Southampton Hospital.

On the same campus as the hospital are the Schools of the Health Sciences Center which consist of four professional schools: the School of Dental Medicine, Health Professions, Nursing and Social Welfare. These four schools offer professional education to over 3,000 students and conduct programs of research, service and continuing professional education. Professional, technical and laboratory resources support the academic activities of the students and faculty.

=== Awards ===
The hospital ranked nationally in two specialties on the 2021 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. The hospital ranked as #41 in Neurology and Neurosurgery, and #49 in orthopedics. The hospital also ranked as the 12th best in the state.

== Facilities ==
Designed by noted Chicago architect Bertrand Goldberg, construction on the complex began in 1976, and the smallest building, the Basic Sciences Health Tower, was completed that year. Two years later, the Clinical Sciences Tower was completed. Finally, in 1980, the Hospital itself was built. The complex of three buildings is located on the &quot;East Campus&quot;, and is separated from the rest of Stony Brook University by Nicolls Road. The buildings are 334 feet tall and have a dominating presence over the university skyline, and they can be seen from miles away across Suffolk County.

In September 2008, SBUH opened Phase I of its first major renovation known as the Major Modernization Project. It was the first such renovation of the 28-year-old facility. It includes a new wing, which houses the Woman and Infants Center, an expanded Emergency Department and a Surgical Suite with an OR Pharmacy.

Located a short walk away from SBUH is the Center for Outpatient Services at Stony Brook University, which opened its doors in March 2007. Service areas within the Center include The Imaging Center (which is home to a 40-slice positron emission tomography/computed tomography PET/CT camera), the Center for Pain Management, and the Outpatient Cancer Center, which includes the Carol M. Baldwin Breast Care Center, Medical Oncology, Pediatric Hematology/Oncology and Surgical Oncology. The new facility offers easy access, free parking and valet services, spacious and tranquil public areas and on-site food services.

A new Heart Center was opened inside the hospital in 2005, containing a new Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU), Cardiac Acute Care Unit (CACU), angioplasty suites (catheterization labs), and electrophysiology labs.

The Stony Brook College campus is also ranked as a top 100 university in the US by US News.

The hospital has 106 beds. It is affiliated with The Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University, and is a member of Stony Brook Medicine. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 and beyond throughout the Long Island region. Stony Brook Children&#x27;s Hospital features the only pediatric Level 1 Trauma Center in the region, and one of few in the state.

=== History ===
Stony Brook Children&#x27;s Hospital originally opened up in 2010 under the name of Stony Brook Long Island Children&#x27;s Hospital. SBCH originally consisted of pediatric units within the adult hospital. The project to build a new children&#x27;s hospital building was announced in 2013 by university officials; and construction started in 2014.

In 2017, the hospital was verified as a Level 1 Pediatric Trauma Center by the American College of Surgeons after meeting the stringent requirements.

The hospital opened up a new four story expansion to the children&#x27;s hospital in 2019. The expansion consisted of 71,500 square-feet, and expansive amenities designed to ease fears of patients including playrooms for children and teens. The hospital also opened up a new Ronald McDonald family room to serve the parents and children.

In 2024, the hospital raised $23 million to build a 60,000-square-foot Ronald McDonald House at Stony Brook Hospital, the first in Suffolk County.

<doc id="911140" wikidata="Q285116" url="?curid=911140" title="Bruce Fairbairn">
<text>Bruce Earl Fairbairn (December 30, 1949 – May 17, 1999) was a Canadian record producer. He was active as a producer from 1976 to 1999, and is considered one of the best of his era. His most successful productions are &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; by Bon Jovi, &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, &quot;Pump&quot;, and &quot;Get a Grip&quot; by Aerosmith, &quot;The Razors Edge&quot; by AC/DC, and &quot;Balance&quot; by Van Halen, each of which sold at least three million copies. He was originally a trumpet player, then started a career as a record producer for Canadian rock band Prism. Fairbairn won the Canadian music industry Producer of the Year Juno Award three times. He produced albums for many well-known international artists such as Loverboy, Blue Öyster Cult, Bon Jovi, Poison, Aerosmith, AC/DC, Scorpions, Van Halen, Chicago, The Cranberries, INXS, Kiss and Yes. His style was notable for introducing dynamic horn arrangements into rock music productions. Fairbairn died suddenly on May 17, 1999, due to unknown causes.

==Career==

===Early life and Prism===
Fairbairn played the trumpet since the age of 5, as well as studying piano. Until the age of 16, he was a trumpetist in community groups. While in the 10th grade at Vancouver&#x27;s Prince of Wales Secondary School, Fairbairn founded his first band The Spectres, managed by Bruce Allen, who would remain with Fairbairn through his career.

In the early 1970s, Fairbairn started producing while he was part of the Vancouver jazz-rock group Sunshyne, in which he played both trumpet and horn. There he met bandmate Jim Vallance, who would go on to become one of the most successful songwriters in the music industry and an important music associate. After Vallance left Sunshyne in 1973, Fairbairn changed Sunshyne&#x27;s format to blues-rock-pop. Fairbairn recruited guitarist Lindsay Mitchell, from Vancouver band Seeds of Time, as singer-songwriter and frontman. Fairbairn worked through 1974 to land a recording contract for Sunshyne, using demos of two songs written by Mitchell. By mid-1975, when Fairbairn could not close a record deal for Sunshyne, he approached Vallance for assistance. Vallance reworked the arrangements on the Mitchell songs and supplied three of his own at Fairbairn&#x27;s request. One of the Vallance songs, &quot;Open Soul Surgery&quot; impressed an executive at record label GRT, who signed Fairbairn&#x27;s group to a recording contract in 1976.

Over the next year, Fairbairn produced an album using musicians from both Sunshyne and Seeds of Time (including himself). The newly renamed band Prism released its debut album in 1977. The album reached platinum status in Canada, with sales in excess of 100,000 albums by 1978.1 Fairbairn himself, however, elected not to be a member of Prism, and is credited only as producer and as a session musician on the album, and he did not play with Prism in any live performances.
Fairbairn produced Prism&#x27;s next three albums, all of which went platinum or double platinum in Canada. In 1980, Fairbairn won his first of three Canadian music industry Producer of the Year Juno Awards for Prism&#x27;s third album, &quot;Armageddon&quot;.

===Loverboy===
In 1980, while still working with Prism, Fairbairn started production work on the debut album for Canadian rock band Loverboy. The self-titled album &quot;Loverboy&quot; would be the first Fairbairn production to break through in the lucrative US market and launch Fairbairn&#x27;s international success.

Fairbairn&#x27;s productions attracted a growing list of international artists to Vancouver&#x27;s Little Mountain Sound Studios to work with him and his protégé Bob Rock. Over the next 5 years, Fairbairn&#x27;s work on Blue Öyster Cult&#x27;s 1983 album &quot;The Revölution by Night&quot;, Krokus&#x27; 1984 album &quot;The Blitz&quot;, and Canadian band Honeymoon Suite&#x27;s arena rock 1985 album &quot;The Big Prize&quot; continued Fairbairn&#x27;s string of international hits.

===&quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;===
Fairbairn&#x27;s biggest commercial success is Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; (1986), which made him a top-rate international producer. The album has sold over 28 million copies worldwide. &quot;Bruce Fairbairn was a trumpet player,&quot; noted Jon Bon Jovi in 2007. &quot;You couldn&#x27;t get him on a guitar. And, for the first time, we were allowed to be us in the studio.&quot;

&quot;I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to work with so many different talents,&quot; Fairbairn noted, &quot;but Bon Jovi may be the finest. There was record company pressure to deliver the hits, but they were a joy. People seem to concentrate so much on their success that they lose sight of how good these guys are.&quot;

===&quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;===
His next major production, Aerosmith&#x27;s 1987 album &quot;Permanent Vacation&quot;, was another international success and generated a series of hits including &quot;Dude (Looks Like a Lady)&quot;, &quot;Angel&quot;, and &quot;Rag Doll&quot;. Steven Tyler said that Fairbairn was instrumental in the creation of the album and &quot;helped relight the fire under Aerosmith&quot;.

===Continued international success===
In 1988, Fairbairn produced the Bon Jovi album &quot;New Jersey&quot;, which holds the record for the hard rock/glam metal album to spawn the most Top 10 singles, with five singles charting in the Top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, selling over seven million copies in the United States. Fairbain also produced Aerosmith&#x27;s follow-up, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Pump&quot;, which had sales in excess of seven million and was widely acclaimed by critics, and won him another &quot;Producer of the Year&quot; Juno Award.

In the 1990s, Fairbairn worked with a string of internationally influential hard rock acts. In 1990 he produced AC/DC&#x27;s &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;, and Poison&#x27;s &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;. In 1993, he produced another Aerosmith commercial hit, &quot;Get a Grip&quot;, which racked up sales of seven million and solidified the band&#x27;s growing representation as international media stars. Next, Fairbairn produced Scorpions&#x27; &quot;Face the Heat&quot; and in 1995 Van Halen&#x27;s &quot;Balance&quot;. Also in 1995, Fairbairn went to Vallance&#x27;s Armoury Studios in Vancouver to work on Chicago&#x27;s &quot;Night and Day: Big Band&quot;, and liked the studio so much he bought it from Vallance the following year.

In late 1996, and through early 1997, Fairbairn produced INXS&#x27; comeback album &quot;Elegantly Wasted&quot; which, while garnering mixed reviews, obtained sales that were higher than the band&#x27;s previous albums. Also, Fairbairn produced The Cranberries&#x27; &quot;To the Faithful Departed&quot;, and Kiss&#x27; reunion-album &quot;Psycho Circus&quot;.

His last fully completed project was the Atomic Fireballs&#x27; &quot;Torch This Place&quot; for Atlantic Records in 1998, which Fairbairn described as &quot;a return to my brass roots&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
During the mixing sessions for Yes&#x27; &quot;The Ladder&quot;, on May 17, 1999, Fairbairn was found dead by Yes singer Jon Anderson and Armoury Studios manager Sheryl Preston in his Vancouver home. He was survived by his wife, Julie, with whom he had three sons: Scott, Kevin, and Brent. Bob Rock explained that, on the week Fairbairn died, the two were to travel to New York to meet Bon Jovi for another album together.

A memorial, &quot;A Celebration of the Life of Bruce Earl Fairbairn&quot;, held at the Chan Centre for the Performing Arts, was attended by more than 300 people. Highlighted by reminiscences from close friends, the event included musical performances from Jon Anderson and Steve Howe performing the song &quot;Nine Voices&quot; from Yes&#x27; &quot;The Ladder&quot; sessions, as well as Tom Keenlyside, guitarist David Sinclair and finally, &quot;Taps&quot; played on Bruce&#x27;s trumpet by son Brent.

In March 2000, Fairbairn was posthumously awarded the Canadian Music Hall of Fame Juno Award for his work.

His interviews concerning &quot;The Ladder&quot; represent some of his final moments on camera, included in short sections as part of the bonus material on Yes&#x27; &quot;Live at the House of Blues&quot; DVD.

<text>The , branded as the , is a hybrid light rail/tram line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei). The Arakawa Line is the sole survivor of Tokyo&#x27;s once-extensive Tokyo Toden streetcar system. It is one of the only two tram lines in Tokyo, besides the Tokyu Setagaya Line.

== History ==
The line was originally constructed by the as a part of their extensive network, with the oldest section still operating today opened in 1913. The line was at threat of being shut down along with the rest of Tokyo&#x27;s streetcar system in the 1960s, but concerted opposition from residents prevented this and parts of lines 27 (Minowabashi-Akabane) and 32 (Arakawa-Waseda) were merged to form the line as it is today. The line was sold to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation in 1974, which renamed it the Toden Arakawa Line.

The Toden Arakawa Line operates between the terminals at Minowabashi Station and Waseda Station. It runs along Meiji Street between Asuka-yama Station and Oji Eki-mae Station. Otherwise, it operates on its own tracks. Presently, single driver-operated cars make the trip in 50 minutes. The gauge is . The line is fully double-track, and draws 600 V electrical supply.

Two Toden Arakawa trams (one in revenue earning service, the other undergoing brake testing) collided on June 13, 2006 near the Minowabashi terminus, injuring 27 people.

==Sights==
The Toden Arakawa Line operates in northern and eastern Tokyo outside the main tourist areas. The terminus at Minowabashi is near the historical site of Edo&#x27;s red-light district Yoshiwara which features a completely covered shopping street, several blocks long, in the once common &quot;Ameyoko&quot; style (a shōtengai).

==In literature==
In Haruki Murakami&#x27;s novel &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, protagonist Toru Watanabe takes the line to near Ōtsuka Station: &quot;I sat in the last seat and watched the ancient houses passing close to the window. The tram almost touched the overhanging eaves... The tram snaked its way through this private back-alley world.&quot;

<text>The Arusha Accords, officially the Peace Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Rwandaand the Rwandan Patriotic Front, also known as the Arusha Peace Agreement or Arusha negotiations, were a set of five accords (or protocols) signed in Arusha, Tanzania, on 4 August 1993, by the government of Rwanda and the rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), under mediation, to end a three-year Rwandan Civil War. Primarily organized by the Organisation of African Unity and the heads of state in the African Great Lakes region, the talks began on 12 July 1992, and ended on 4 August 1993, when the accords were finally signed.

==Agreements==

The Arusha Accords envisioned the establishment of a Broad-Based Transitional Government (BBTG), which would include the insurgent RPF and the five political parties that had composed a temporary government since April 1992 in anticipation of general elections. The Accords included other points considered necessary for lasting peace: the rule of law, repatriation of refugees both from fighting and from power sharing agreements, and the merging of government and rebel armies.

Of twenty-one cabinet posts in the transitional government, the National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (MRND), the former ruling party, was given five, including the Defence portfolio. The Rwandan Patriotic Front got the same number, including the portfolio of the Interior and the role of Vice-Prime Minister. The major opposition party, the Republican Democratic Movement (MDR), was given four posts, including the office of Prime Minister, assigned to Faustin Twagiramungu. The Social Democratic Party and the Liberal Party were each given three portfolios, while the Christian Democratic Party was given one. The Broad Based Transitional Government never materialized. Juvénal Habyarimana and the MRND stalled the negotiations.

The Rwandan Patriotic Front was granted participation in the national assembly. It was agreed upon by both parties that RPF troops would not only be allowed to join the national Rwandan army, but make up at least half of the officer positions. The Accords also provided for establishment of a military composed of sixty percent government troops and forty percent from the Rwandan Patriotic Front.

It was agreed that the transitional government and national assembly would be established no more than thirty-seven days after the signing of the Accords. The transitional period was limited to twenty-two months, after which general elections would be held.

The delegations signed the protocol on 3 August 1993, and President Habyarimana and RPF president Alexis Kanyarengwe signed the following day.

==Impact==
Intended as a negotiation for the sharing of power between the rebels and the Rwandan government, the talks produced an agreement that favored the Rwandan Patriotic Front because of disagreements within the government. The government delegation was led by the opposition Foreign Minister, Boniface Ngulinzira (MDR), until President Habyarimana replaced him with Defense Minister James Gasana (MRND) in January 1993. The Arusha Accords stripped many powers from the office of the President, transferring them to the transitional government. In a speech on 15 November 1992, Habyarimana referred to the Arusha Accords as &quot;scraps of paper&quot; and ridiculed his opponents for shunning elections. According to André Guichaoua, this did not reflect opposition to the peace accords as such:

The agreement moreover unsettled numerous soldiers who feared an overall demobilization as a consequence of the army merger provision in the agreement. This is a contributory factor in explaining the ensuing genocide the year after.

On 5 October 1993, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 872, which established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). Its objective was assistance in and supervision of implementation of the Arusha Accords. The initial UN presence was 2,548 military personnel, the biggest national contingent being 440 Belgian soldiers. The head of the mission was Jacques-Roger Booh-Booh.

On 6 April 1994, the airplane of Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprien Ntaryamira (also a Hutu) was shot down as it flew towards the Kigali airport. Responsibility for the attack is a matter of contention, with both the Hutu extremists and the RPF under suspicion. The assassination was a catalyst for the Rwandan genocide. It was one of several assassinations that occurred with similar political motives as moderates were targeted by the CDR, the hardline faction once part of the MRND. Soldiers of UNAMIR were present before, during, and after the violence. The limitations of the UN, due to national sovereignty and the need to remain impartial when conducting Chapter 6 peacekeeping operations, led to the impotence of UNAMIR to do anything more than bear witness to the genocide and protect refugees at a limited number of sites. After 10 Belgian soldiers were killed in April 1994, the Belgian contingent was removed from Rwanda and the size of the mission reduced to around 270 personnel. Belgian soldiers abandoned refugees labelled ibiyitso at the Ecole Technique Officiele, who were then slaughtered by the Interahamwe and other Pawa collaborators. International powers such as France, the UK and the US did not have the political motivation to send troops or financial support for UNAMIR, although many of these countries were able to remove their foreign nationals from danger. The Ghanaian, Tunisian and Bangladeshi UNAMIR soldiers who stayed saved the lives of tens of thousands of refugees at various sites, including Amahoro stadium and Hotel Mille-Collines.

<text>Slan is a science fiction novel by American-Canadian writer A. E. van Vogt, as well as the name of the fictional race of superbeings featured in the novel. The novel was originally serialized in the magazine &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (September–December 1940). It was subsequently published in hardcover in 1946 by Arkham House, in an edition of 4,051 copies. In 2016, &quot;Slan&quot; was awarded the Retro-Hugo Award for Best Novel for 1941.

== Plot ==
Slans are evolved humans, named after their alleged creator, Samuel Lann. They have the psychic abilities to read minds and are super-intelligent. They possess near limitless stamina, &quot;nerves of steel,&quot; and superior strength and speed. When Slans are ill or seriously injured, they retreat into a healing trance. However, the human dictator Kier Gray leads a campaign to exterminate the Slans.

There are two kinds of Slans. One type has tendrils on their heads and can read the minds of ordinary humans and telepathically communicate with other Slans. The tendrils are golden-colored, making it easy to spot them. These Slans are hunted to near extinction. The other type is tendrilless, equally as intelligent as the tendrilled kind but without psychic abilities, except the ability to hide their thoughts from the first type of Slan. 

As the novel begins, nine-year-old Jommy Cross (a telepathic Slan of the first type) travels with his mother to the capital, Centropolis. They are discovered and Jommy&#x27;s mother is killed, while Jommy flees. Jommy Cross is not only the heir to the brilliant inventions of his father, but he represents the last hope of the Slan race to save it from genocide. In fulfilling his mission, he seeks to destroy Kier Gray, and, in their final confrontation, discovers an astonishing secret.

==Reception==
Groff Conklin, reviewing a 1951 edition, described &quot;Slan&quot; as &quot;a little overblown, considerably melodramatic, but still [a] really gripping adventure story.&quot; P. Schuyler Miller called &quot;Slan&quot; &quot;van Vogt&#x27;s first and most famous novel, perhaps his best.&quot; In a back-cover blurb in the 1998 Orb edition, Charles de Lint says this: &quot;Over fifty years on from when it first saw print, van Vogt&#x27;s &quot;Slan&quot; is still one of the quintessential classics in the field that other SF novels will inevitably be measured against.&quot;

R. D. Mullen reported &quot;Slan&quot; to be &quot;perhaps the most widely read, and perhaps the best of [van Vogt&#x27;s] novels.&quot; He described the situation of the Slan minority in the imagined society as &quot;obviously intended&quot; as analogous to &quot;the position of the Jews in the Third Reich&quot;, though in the novel &quot;there actually is a secret world-wide conspiracy, and the Slans actually do control the world in much the same way as is imagined about the Jews by students of The Protocols of Zion.&quot;

== &quot;Fans are slans&quot; ==
In American science fiction fandom, the slogan &quot;Fans are slans&quot; quickly developed, making the analogy between science fiction fans, perceived as harassed because of their greater intelligence and imaginative capacity, and the slans in the novel, who are persecuted for their superior mental abilities. Although some regard the usage as a sign of fandom&#x27;s elitism, along with the related term &quot;mundane&quot; for non-fans, others regard it as a natural reaction to the disapproval of science fiction fans by the broader culture. The related term &quot;slan shack&quot; came to be used in fanspeak for a home occupied primarily by fans. The first Slan Shack to bear that name was established in 1943 in Battle Creek, Michigan by Al and Abby Lou Ashley, Walt Liebscher, E. Everett Evans and fan artist Jack Wiedenbeck. Others have included the Bozo Bus Building in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Lytheria in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

== &quot;Toward the Terra&quot; ==
The manga and anime series &quot;Toward the Terra&quot; is influenced by &quot;Slan&quot;. Both stories feature a hero named Jommy/Jomy, who discovers that he is a member of a race of telepathic mutants, who are persecuted by artificial general intelligence and non-telepathic humans brainwashed by them.

== 2007 sequel ==
American science fiction author Kevin J. Anderson completed the sequel to &quot;Slan&quot;, titled &quot;Slan Hunter&quot;, that includes content from an unfinished draft by van Vogt. It was published July 10, 2007, and credited to both Van Vogt and Anderson. Van Vogt&#x27;s widow Lydia van Vogt previously gave permission to publish her introduction online, which partly deals with the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease that van Vogt struggled with at the end of his life.

<text>The United Citizens Party (UCP) is an American political party first organized in 1969 in the U.S. state of South Carolina by John Roy Harper II and others, in response to the state Democratic Party&#x27;s opposition to nominating black candidates. The party&#x27;s objective was to elect blacks to the legislature and local offices in counties with black majority populations. The party ran candidates in 1970 and 1972; as a result in 1970 the first three black candidates were elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives since Reconstruction.

==History==
===Original formation===
The first president was John Roy Harper II, named at the first annual convention on April 13, 1970; he later served as party chairman. Harper stated that he had split from the Democratic Party due to the party&#x27;s refusal to nominate Black candidates. The party&#x27;s candidate in 1970 was Thomas Broadwater for Governor. The party&#x27;s founding document stated that it was creating “a separate party running people who will do what we, the people, want done,” and that, “furthermore, whites have never publicly promised Black folks nothing-we need to divorce.”

In 1972 the party was able to secure a line on the ballot for George McGovern in his campaign against Richard Nixon via fusion voting. The 1972 elections also marked the entry of Black South Carolinian Democrats to the House, largely due to the efforts of the UCP, despite the party electing no stand-alone candidates. In 1974, the political scientists Hanes Walton Jr. and William H. Boone cited the UCP up to that point as an example of a successful sub-national African American political party.

===1st Refoundation===
Since 1972 the party stood no additional candidates, largely going dormant, however, in 1986 new election laws passed in South Carolina requiring a party to run candidates in at least every other general election. In 1988, the New York based New Alliance Party filed the paperwork to run a candidate for the UCP line, Lenora Fulani, for President of the United States. She ran again as a UCP candidate in her 1992 run for president. During this period Fulani changed the name of the party to the Patriot Party (PP) and was also simultaneously working with supporters of Ross Perot to make a national political party for Perot.

For his second bid for president in 1996, Perot&#x27;s newly formed Reform Party (RP) also secured ballot access in South Carolina, meaning Perot appeared twice, once for the RP, and the other for the PP. The PP would earn Perot 36,913 votes in South Carolina, to the Reform Party&#x27;s 27,464. The combined 64,386 votes was 5.60% of the electorate. However, with an established state branch of the Reform party, Perot&#x27;s supporters migrated, leaving the PP dormant.

===2nd Refoundation===
In 2000, Michael Avey, then a professor of political science at Lander College, with some activist friends, took over the dormant PP and wrote to the Federal Election Commission requesting federal recognition for changing the name back to the United Citizens Party. Ralph Nader ran as the UCP nominee in his 2000 bid for president, earning him 20,279 votes or 1.47% of the electorate. The party&#x27;s original founder Harper has come out in support of Avey&#x27;s restored party, applauding his efforts to make a party for Black Americans stating that &quot;The problems and inequities the United Citizens Party identified 30 year ago are still problems today. Sure, there have been a number of black legislators elected, but not enough to make difference without the support of white Democrats, which too rarely happens. The [Democratic] Party gives lip service to the needs of the black community and working people, but it stops there.&quot;

In the 2002 election for the Second Congressional District in South Carolina, Mark Whittington received 17,189 votes or 10.03% of the total. Activist and political operative Kevin Alexander Gray was a gubernatorial candidate representing the South Carolina United Citizens’ Party and the South Carolina Green Party. He did not collect the required number of signatures to be on the ballot, and consequently ran as a write-in candidate.

==== 2004 Presidential Elections ====
In presidential election of 2004, the UCP chose to nominate the Socialist Party candidate Walt Brown for president. Brown received 2,124 votes or about 0.1% of the total 1,617,730.

In 2006, the Party endorsed John &quot;JC&quot; Nelums for State House District 79 (Kershaw, Richland) and did not cross-endorse candidates of any other party.

==== 2008 Presidential Elections ====
On March 29, 2008, the party endorsed Barack Obama via convention for the 2008 presidential election, but the nomination was not accepted. Obama appeared on the ballot as solely as the candidate of the Democratic Party.

In 2010, the party cross-endorsed former football player Morgan Bruce Reeves for governor, alongside the South Carolina Green Party. Reeves received 0.9% of the vote. On the November 2014 ballot, the party nominated Reeves for Governor and David Edmond for Commissioner of Agriculture. Reeves received 0.5% of the vote.

In 2018 and 2022, Chris Nelums ran as a United Citizens Party candidate for Commissioner of Agriculture. In 2018 Nelums received 118,671 votes, or 8.85% of the vote; in 2022, he received 95,625 votes, or 6.84% of the vote.

<doc id="911178" wikidata="Q4417454" url="?curid=911178" title="Silver certificate (United States)">
<text>Silver certificates are a type of representative money issued between 1878 and 1964 in the United States as part of its circulation of paper currency. They were produced in response to silver agitation by citizens who were angered by the Fourth Coinage Act, which had effectively placed the United States on a gold standard. The certificates were initially redeemable for their face value of silver dollar coins and later (for one year from June 24, 1967, to June 24, 1968) in raw silver bullion. Since 1968 they have been redeemable only in Federal Reserve Notes and are thus obsolete, but still valid legal tender at their face value and thus are still an accepted form of currency.

Large-size silver certificates, generally longer and wider than modern U.S. paper currency, (1878 to 1923) were issued initially in denominations from to (in 1878 and 1880) and in 1886 the , , and were authorized. In 1928, all United States bank notes were re-designed and the size reduced. The small-size silver certificate (1928–1964) was only regularly issued in denominations of , , and . The complete type set below is part of the National Numismatic Collection at the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History.

==History==
The Coinage Act of 1873 intentionally omitted language authorizing the coinage of &quot;standard&quot; silver dollars and ended the bimetallic standard that had been created by Alexander Hamilton. While the Coinage Act of 1873 stopped production of silver dollars, it was the 1874 adoption of Section 3568 of the Revised Statutes that actually removed legal tender status from silver certificates in the payment of debts exceeding five dollars. By 1875 business interests invested in silver (e.g., Western banks, mining companies) wanted the bimetallic standard restored. People began to refer to the passage of the Act as the Crime of &#x27;73. Prompted by a sharp decline in the value of silver in 1876, Congressional representatives from Nevada and Colorado, states responsible for over 40% of the world&#x27;s silver yield in the 1870s and 1880s, began lobbying for change. Further public agitation for silver use was driven by fear that there was not enough money in the community. Members of Congress claimed ignorance that the 1873 law would lead to the demonetization of silver, despite having had three years to review the bill prior to enacting it to law. Some blamed the passage of the Act on a number of external factors including a conspiracy involving foreign investors and government conspirators. In response, the Bland–Allison Act, as it came to be known, was passed by Congress (over a presidential veto) on February 28, 1878. It did not provide for the &quot;free and unlimited coinage of silver&quot; demanded by Western miners, but it did require the United States Treasury to purchase between  million and  million of silver bullion per month from mining companies in the West, to be minted into coins.

===Large-size silver certificates===

The first silver certificates (Series 1878) were issued in denominations of through . Reception by financial institutions was cautious. While more convenient and less bulky than dollar coins, the silver certificate was not accepted for all transactions. The Bland–Allison Act established that they were &quot;receivable for customs, taxes, and all public dues,&quot; and could be included in bank reserves, but silver certificates were not explicitly considered legal tender for private interactions (i.e., between individuals). Congress used the National Banking Act of July 12, 1882, to clarify the legal tender status of silver certificates by clearly authorizing them to be included in the lawful reserves of national banks. A general appropriations act of August 4, 1886, authorized the issue of , , and silver certificates. The introduction of low-denomination currency (as denominations of U.S. Notes under were put on hold) greatly increased circulation. Over the 12-year lifespan of the Bland–Allison Act, the United States government would receive a seigniorage amounting to roughly  million (between and  million per year), while absorbing over 60% of U.S. silver production.

===Small-size silver certificates===

Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh (1909–13) appointed a committee to investigate possible advantages (e.g., reduced cost, increased production speed) to issuing smaller sized United States banknotes. Due in part to the outbreak of World War I and the end of his appointed term, any recommendations may have stalled. On August 20, 1925, Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon appointed a similar committee and in May 1927 accepted their recommendations for the size reduction and redesign of U.S. banknotes. On July 10, 1929, the new small-size currency was issued.

In keeping with the verbiage on large-size silver certificates, all the small-size Series 1928 certificates carried the obligation &quot;This certifies that there has (or have) been deposited in the Treasury of the United States of America X silver dollar(s) payable to the bearer on demand&quot; or &quot;X dollars in silver coin payable to the bearer on demand&quot;. This required that the Treasury maintain stocks of silver dollars to back and redeem the silver certificates in circulation. Beginning with the Series 1934 silver certificates the wording was changed to &quot;This certifies that there is on deposit in the Treasury of the United States of America X dollars in silver payable to the bearer on demand.&quot; This freed the Treasury from storing bags of silver dollars in its vaults, and allowed it to redeem silver certificates with bullion or silver granules, rather than silver dollars. Years after the government stopped the redemption of silver certificates for silver, large quantities of silver dollars intended specifically to satisfy the earlier obligation for redemption in silver dollars were found in Treasury vaults.

The 1928 and 1934 series one-dollar silver certificate came to be known as a Funnyback because of the image on the reverse. People called the note the Funnyback based on the dramatically lighter green ink used on the reverse and unusually large font which was used for the word &quot;ONE&quot; in the center of the design. The obverse carries the portrait of the first American president, George Washington. 

As was usual with currency during this period, the year date on the bill did not reflect when it was printed, but rather a major design change. Under the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the authority to issue silver certificates was given to the U.S. Secretary of Treasury. Additional changes, particularly when either of the two signatures was altered, led to a letter being added below the date. One notable exception was the Series 1935G silver certificate, which included notes both with and without the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on the reverse. 1935 dated one dollar certificates lasted through the letter &quot;H&quot;, after which new printing processes began the 1957 series. In some cases printing plates were used until they wore out, even though newer ones were also producing notes, so the sequencing of signatures may not always be chronological. Thus some of the 1935 dated one dollar certificates were issued as late as 1963.

===World War II Issues===

In response to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the Hawaii overprint note was ordered from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing on June 8, 1942 (all were made-over 1934–1935 bills). Issued in denominations of , , , and , only the was a silver certificate, the others were Federal Reserve Notes. Stamped &quot;HAWAII&quot; (in small solid letters on the obverse and large hollow letters on the reverse), with the Treasury seal and serial numbers in brown instead of the usual blue, these notes could be demonetized in the event of a Japanese invasion. Additional World War II emergency currency was issued in November 1942 for circulation in Europe and Northern Africa. Printed with a bright yellow seal, these notes ($1, , and ) could be demonetized should the United States lose its position in the European or North African campaigns.

===&quot;Star notes&quot;===
When a bill is damaged in printing it is normally replaced by another one (the star replaces a letter at the edge of the note). To keep the amounts issued consistent, these replacement banknotes are normally indicated by a star in the separately sequenced serial number. For silver certificates this asterisk appears at the beginning of the serial number.

===End of the silver certificates===

In the nearly three decades since passage of the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the annual demand for silver bullion rose steadily from roughly 11 million ounces (1933) to 110 million ounces (1962). The Acts of 1939 and 1946 established floor prices for silver of 71 cents and 90.5 cents (respectively) per ounce. Predicated on an anticipated shortage of silver bullion, Public Law 88-36 (PL88-36) was enacted on June 4, 1963, which repealed the Silver Purchase Act of 1934, and the Acts of July 6, 1939, and July 31, 1946, while providing specific instruction regarding the disposition of silver held as reserves against issued certificates and the price at which silver may be sold. It also amended the Federal Reserve Act to authorize the issue of lower denomination notes (i.e., and ), allowing for the gradual retirement (or swapping out process) of silver certificates and releasing silver bullion from reserve. In repealing the earlier laws, PL88-36 also repealed the authority of the Secretary of the Treasury to control the issue of silver certificates. By issuing Executive Order 11110, President John F. Kennedy was able to continue the Secretary&#x27;s authority. While retaining their status as legal tender, the silver certificate had effectively been retired from use.

In March 1964, Secretary of the Treasury C. Douglas Dillon halted redemption of silver certificates for silver dollar coins; during the following four years, silver certificates were redeemable in uncoined silver &quot;granules&quot;. All redemption in silver ceased on June 24, 1968. While there are some exceptions (particularly for some of the very early issues as well as the experimental bills) the vast majority of small sized one dollar silver certificates, especially non-star or worn bills of the 1935 and 1957 series, are worth little or nothing above their face values. They can still occasionally be found in circulation.

These children are major characters in &quot;Rama Revealed.&quot; After a twelve-year journey, they arrive in the vicinity of the star Sirius, where all eight rendezvous with a Raman Node. This part of the story is written in the perspective of Nicole through their diary.

At the Node they are subjected to physiological tests for a year while Rama is refurbished, and they are eventually sent back to the Solar System, this time to collect two thousand more representatives of humanity. An Earth agency, known as the ISA, receives the message from Rama requesting two thousand humans. Upon its reception, the message is kept secret and, under the guise of a new Martian colony, the ISA starts acquiring its payload. The ISA selects a handful of their own representatives; meanwhile, they selectively gather convicts and promise them freedom if they are chosen to be a colonist. The payload is subdivided into three ships: the &quot;Nina&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa Maria&quot; that arrive sequentially at Rama. At this point the colonists believe everything is a hoax (despite the colossal size of Rama) created by the ISA. With that discontent as the tone upon their arrival, Rama III heads back to deep space with its new payload.

Soon an aggressive group of humans, led by a mob boss, seizes control of the human colony and begins a war of annihilation and propaganda against one of the other species occupying the massive spacecraft. The original astronauts and their children find themselves powerless to prevent the genocide. However, the aggressive behavior of the human species does not go unnoticed: Another species, unknown to the humans, observes their behavior and starts considering a possible counterattack.

Meanwhile, Rama III determines that total escalation of the conflict is imminent and transmits an emergency signal to its ancient constructors. The book ends with a cliffhanger, on the eve of the execution of one of the original astronauts.

== Reception ==
A New York Times review prior to the book&#x27;s release on September 1, 1991 reports the book features few events, is primarily philosophical and builds on the story of the previous two in the series. A 1998 review rated the book 2.5/5, mentioning that although there are highlights in the story, it deteriorates in the book&#x27;s second half, reporting an overall poor storytelling through the use of stock characters. Another negative 1999 review is critical of the emphasis of Nicole&#x27;s recounted childhood stories, but that the plot development is important to understand the later novel which they consider an improvement, Rama Revealed.

<doc id="911188" wikidata="Q3832859" url="?curid=911188" title="Hankyu Takarazuka Main Line">
<text>The is a Japanese railway line operated by the private railway operator Hankyu Railway. It connects Umeda Station in downtown Osaka with Takarazuka Station in Takarazuka, Hyogo.

It has a branch line, the Minoo Line, and the Nose Electric Railway is another longer branch line. The Imazu Line connects at Takarazuka, but it is treated as a branch of the Kobe Line.

The Takarazuka Main Line is commonly called the for short, but the name Takarazuka Line is sometimes used as the name for the network composed of the main line and the branches.

The line has numerous sharp curves from the line&#x27;s origins as a tramway, built and opened by its predecessor . The sharp curves have long hindered high speed operation, contrasting to the Hankyu&#x27;s other main lines, Kobe and Kyoto.

==History==
The Minoo Arima Electric Tramway opened the entire line on 10 March 1910 as 1435mm gauge dual track, electrified at 600 VDC. Although the line was not a prospect interurban as Takarazuka was not a big city, it saw initial success thanks to the company&#x27;s aggressive measures. It strategically developed housing areas along the line for the increasing white-collar population who would commute to central Osaka by train. It also opened a zoo in Minoo (on the Minoo Line) in November 1910, a hot spring in Takarazuka in May 1911, and a ballpark in Toyonaka in 1913.

The track between Umeda and Jūsō was shared with the Kobe Line from 1920 to 1926 when the original double track was replaced by an elevated four-track line.

In comparison with the Kobe Line, cars used on the Takarazuka Line were small and old. Larger (Kobe Line standard) cars could not operate on the line until 1952 due to its small structure gauge. Small cars were eliminated in December 1963.
On 24 August 1969 the voltage was raised to 1500 VDC.
As the commuters increased, Hankyu&#x27;s first 10-car operation began on the Takarazuka Line in March 1982, but 10 car trains were discontinued again in December 2022.

Following the elevation work of Kawanishi-Noseguchi Station, through services to Nose Electric Railway began on 17 November 1997.

Since the 1970s there have been plans to build a spur line to Itami Airport from Sone Station. Although Hankyu shelved the plans in the 1980s due to capacity constraints, the plans were reportedly revived in 2017 and remain under consideration as of 2018.

<doc id="911189" wikidata="Q7528337" url="?curid=911189" title="Sir Michael Duff, 3rd Baronet">
<text>Sir Charles Michael Robert Vivian Duff, 3rd Baronet (3 May 1907 – 3 March 1980) was a British socialite who was Lord Lieutenant first of Caernarvonshire, and then of Gwynedd.

==Family==

Duff was the only son of Sir Robert George Vivian Duff, 2nd Baronet, of Vaynol (d.1914), and his wife, Lady Juliet Lowther (1881–1965), only child of the 4th Earl of Lonsdale by his wife, Constance Robinson, Marchioness of Ripon. His maternal grandmother was a sister of the 13th and 14th Earls of Pembroke and Montgomery, and a daughter of the Rt. Hon. Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea, the half-Russian younger son of the 10th Earl of Pembroke, and a good friend to Florence Nightingale. He had one sibling, Victoria Maud Veronica Duff (1904–1967, married John Edward Tennant). His stepfather from 1919 until 1926 was Major Keith Trevor.

He was a godson of Mary of Teck (queen of King George V). Handsome and good-mannered, he was famed as a host and raconteur. He inherited the Welsh estate of Vaynol (also known by its Welsh spelling &#x27;Faenol&#x27;), the slate of which was the principal source of the family&#x27;s wealth. Surrounded by the estate&#x27;s seven-mile-long stone wall, the Duffs lived in Vaynol New Hall, which had been built in 1800. The medieval Vaynol Old Hall, also on the estate, was occupied by the farm manager and later the estate manager.

In 1928, Sir Michael assumed the additional surname of Assheton-Smith, only to renounce it in 1945. In 1930, he was a godfather to Antony Armstrong-Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon, later husband of Princess Margaret. He served as High Sheriff of Anglesey for 1950. He then served as Mayor of Caernarvon, High Sheriff of Caernarvonshire (1932) and Lord Lieutenant of both Caernarvonshire and of Gwynedd.

He was a practical joker, one of his favourite pranks being to dress up as Queen Mary and pay surprise visits to friends - until he bumped into the Queen herself in a neighbour&#x27;s hall. He also wrote a light novel, &quot;The Power Of A Parasol&quot;.

==Marriages==
Sir Michael Duff-Assheton-Smith, as he then was, married first, on 5 March 1935, the Hon Millicent Joan Marjoribanks (born 1906), daughter of the 3rd and last Baron Tweedmouth. They divorced in July 1936, and the marriage was annulled in 1937.

Sir Michael Duff, as he had subsequently become, married as his second wife, on 14 July 1949, Lady (Alexandra Mary Cecilia) Caroline Paget (1913–73), the eldest daughter of Charles Paget, 6th Marquess of Anglesey, and his wife, Lady Marjorie Manners, the eldest daughter of Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland. Lady Caroline was at the time, according to James Lees-Milne, diary 9th Oct 1949, pregnant, the father being Duff Cooper - her uncle by marriage. This pregnancy ended in a stillbirth. The Duffs subsequently adopted a son, Charles David Duff (b. 1950), who became a theatre historian.

A documentary screened on BBC Two Wales in 2005 (&quot;Faenol: Secrets Behind the Wall&quot;) featured Charles Duff discussing his childhood, the bisexuality of his adoptive parents, their marriage of convenience, and the details of his parentage. He did not inherit the estate, and when it was sold all the records were burnt, so compounding the mystery. In another interview for the BBC (&quot;Wall Of Silence&quot;, BBC Wales website) Charles said of Vaynol: &quot;It was a place of great conviviality and energy and joy.&quot; However, by the time Charles was in his teens, Sir Michael had come to believe that his second marriage and the adoption of his son had been grave errors, and according to Charles Duff, &quot;he started to demonise both my mother and myself.&quot; Although appearances were maintained, neither could then do much right in Sir Michael&#x27;s opinion. By this time the house and estate were also in decline. (Prior to the Second World War there had been 17 gardeners.)

==The Duff Estate==
The Vaynol estate, in northern Wales, close to the Anglesey estate at Plas Newydd, passed out of Duff family hands, the last main portion including the demesne within the walls being sold off in 1984. This had come into the family via Mary Assheton-Smith, niece and heiress of the famous squire Assheton-Smith, the celebrated foxhunter.

<doc id="911202" wikidata="Q736843" url="?curid=911202" title="Willard Metcalf">
<text>Willard Leroy Metcalf (July 1, 1858March 9, 1925) was an American painter born in Lowell, Massachusetts. He studied at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and later attended Académie Julian, Paris. After early figure-painting and illustration, he became prominent as a landscape painter. He was one of the Ten American Painters who in 1897 seceded from the Society of American Artists. For some years he was an instructor in the Women&#x27;s Art School, Cooper Union, New York, and in the Art Students League, New York. In 1893 he became a member of the American Watercolor Society, New York. Generally associated with American Impressionism, he is also remembered for his New England landscapes and involvement with the Old Lyme Art Colony at Old Lyme, Connecticut and his influential years at the Cornish Art Colony.

==Early years==
Born into a working-class family, Metcalf began painting in 1874. In 1876 he opened a studio in Boston, and received a scholarship at the Boston Museum school, where he studied until 1878. In 1882 he held an exhibition at the J. Eastman Chase Gallery in Boston, the sales from which financed a study trip abroad.

Metcalf left for Europe in September 1883, and did not return to the United States until late 1888. During that time he traveled and painted, studying first in Paris with Gustave Boulanger and Jules-Joseph Lefebvre, subsequently going to England and Pont-Aven, Brittany. In the winter of 1884 he apparently met John Twachtman in Paris, and painted at Grez-sur-Loing alongside other American artists, including Theodore Robinson. His landscapes at this time were traditional renditions of peasant scenes, in the manner of Jean Millet. By 1886 Metcalf was painting in Giverny, evidently the first American painter to visit there. Soon thereafter he traveled to Algeria and Tunisia, returning to Giverny in the summers of 1887 and 1888, in the company of other American painters.
==Return to America==

Upon his return to the United States Metcalf had a solo exhibition at the St. Botolph Club in Boston. After living briefly in Philadelphia, in 1890 he opened a studio in New York, working for several years as a portrait painter, illustrator, and teacher. In 1895 he painted at Gloucester, Massachusetts, and ceased to work as an illustrator. In the late 1890s he appears to have painted little, and his contributions to the first few exhibitions of The Ten were disappointing. At the time Metcalf led a lavish social life that included heavy drinking.

In 1899 Metcalf joined his friends Robert Reid and Edward Simmons in painting murals for a New York courthouse; in this genre he was no more successful than he had been as an illustrator and portraitist. Metcalf&#x27;s model for the murals was Marguerite Beaufort Hailé, a stage performer twenty years his junior, whom the artist would marry in 1903.

==Maturity==
In preparation for a mural commissioned by a tobacco company, Metcalf traveled to Havana, Cuba in 1902, to make painted studies. That year he also produced a series of notable landscapes, including &quot;The Boat Landing&quot; and &quot;Battery Park-Spring&quot;. These works were characterized by a new freshness of execution and lightness of palette. In 1904 he resided and painted steadily in Clark&#x27;s Cove, Maine. By 1905, at the encouragement of his friend Childe Hassam, he began summering in Old Lyme, working as both painter and teacher, and held successful exhibitions in New York and again at the St. Botolph Club. His expertly handled, subtle views of the New England landscape met with steady critical and financial success.

In 1907 &quot;May Night&quot; won the Corcoran Gallery of Art&#x27;s gold medal, was honored with the top purchase prize of $3,000, and became the first contemporary American painting to be bought by that institution. It remains one of Metcalf&#x27;s best known works and is now in the collection of the National Gallery of Art. In the same year his marriage to Marguerite dissolved when she eloped from Old Lyme with one of Metcalf&#x27;s male students.

=== Cornish Art Colony ===
Metcalf frequently visited the Cornish Art Colony, centered in the villages of Plainfield and Cornish, New Hampshire between 1909 and 1921, often during the quiet winter seasons when many of the colony&#x27;s residents had returned to the city. The colony stretched over gentle, open hills along the Connecticut River with views of Mount Ascutney in Vermont, a landscape which garnered it comparisons to Tuscany and a crop of Italianate summer homes. In 1909, Louis Shipman, a playwright and husband of landscape architect Ellen Biddle Shipman, invited Metcalf to join him for a winter in Plainfield, at his estate there, Brook Place.

Metcalf would return faithfully for many winters, and at least one summer after that. He was good friends with colonist Charles Platt, on whose Cornish estate he honeymooned, with his second wife, Henriette Alice McCrea-Metcalf in 1911. Varying year to year, he stayed with the Shipmans, or a converted grist mill close to the village of Plainfield. His frequent Cornish muse was Blow-me-down Brook, a small creek which runs through the area, and passed along his residence. Other works depict the hills, the Shipman residence or other country buildings. His production in Cornish exemplified and elevated his reputation for painting modest and intimate scenery of the changing seasons, elements which are represented in his work from the time. The pieces he produced in the Cornish area brought an unusual time of social, critical and commercial success in his life, so often filled with personal tumult. His paintings were compared with the poetry of Robert Frost, Walt Whitman, and other writers, earning him a reputation, in the words of one critic, as the &quot;poet laureate of the New England hills.&quot;

While at the colony he painted around 35 landscapes, including &quot;Blow-Me-Down&quot; (1911), &quot;The Village-September Morning&quot; (1911) and &quot;The White Veil&quot; (1909) and the lovely, masterful &quot;Cornish Hills&quot; (1911).
=== Later works, death, and legacy ===

Metcalf continued to hold one-man shows in New York and Boston. During the 1910s he traveled incessantly in search of painting sites. In 1913 he spent nine months painting in Paris, Norway, England, and Italy; in the U.S., in addition to Cornish and Plainfield, New Hampshire, Metcalf lived and painted in Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine, where in 1920 he painted &quot;Benediction&quot; (now lost), a nocturne. In 1923 the painting sold for $13,000, then a record price for the work of a living American artist.

His familial strife continued when, after having two children, he and Henrietta divorced in 1920, which spurred a period of drinking and decreased productivity. However, he rebounded and painted for a number of years in Vermont, possibly returning briefly to Cornish.

The Corcoran Gallery held a large exhibition of Metcalf&#x27;s work in 1925, during which the artist died of a heart attack in New York City, on March 6. He was 66.

The Florence Griswold House, where Metcalf visited and stayed in Old Lyme between 1905 and 1907, now houses the largest public collection of Metcalf&#x27;s paintings and personal artifacts. A number of American museums have collected artworks by Metcalf, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the De Young Museum, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Worcester Art Museum, the Ruth Chandler Williamson Gallery at Scripps College, the Library of Congress, the Amon Carter Museum of American Art, the Dallas Museum of Art, the Terra Foundation for American Art, Colby College Museum of Art, Yale University Art Gallery, Mead Art Museum at Amherst College, Historic Deerfield, Smith College Museum of Art, and the Seattle Art Museum. Works also appear in international collections, such as Madrid&#x27;s Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum.

His ashes were scattered in Cornish, New Hampshire, by his longtime friend Charles Platt.

<doc id="911215" wikidata="Q2777749" url="?curid=911215" title="Summer Hill, New South Wales">
<text>Summer Hill is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Summer Hill is located 7 kilometres west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Inner West Council.

Summer Hill is a primarily residential suburb of Sydney&#x27;s Inner West, adjoining two of Sydney&#x27;s major arterial roads, Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road. The first land grant was made in 1794 to former convict and jailor Henry Kable, and the suburb began growing following the opening of the railway station on the Main Suburban railway line, in 1879.

By the 1920s, the suburb had become relatively upper class, with large estates and mansions built throughout the suburb. Some of these still exist today. Following a transition to a working-class suburb in the mid-20th century, when many of the large estates were demolished or subdivided, the suburb today has a &quot;village&quot; character and a mix of medium-density apartment blocks and federation houses.

==Characteristics==

Summer Hill&#x27;s boundaries are Parramatta Road and Liverpool Road to the north, the rear of the properties on the west side of Prospect Road (with a detour around Trinity Grammar School) to the West, Old Canterbury Road to the south, and the Inner West Light Rail to the east. North of Summer Hill is the suburb of Haberfield, to the east is Lewisham, to the south is Dulwich Hill, and to the west is Ashfield.

Summer Hill has a mix of Federation-era houses, with medium density apartment blocks near the railway station. Local independent business people run most of the shops. The local council has defined a village character for the suburb. Summer Hill is a suburb rich in heritage. More than one hundred properties are heritage listed, and the strong feelings of some residents of the suburb towards protecting the local architecture has seen the introduction of a heritage review, which is expected to add more properties to the heritage register.

Despite formerly being working class, Summer Hill and many of the surrounding suburbs have gradually undergone gentrification over recent years. Culturally, Summer Hill is a blend of medium-density European Sydney suburbia, with Italian influences (which are most evident in Leichhardt to the east and Haberfield to the north), Asian (mainly Chinese) influences (which are most strongly evident in Ashfield to the West), and smaller influences from many other cultures.

==History==

===Aboriginal Anthropology===
Before the First Fleet arrived at Port Jackson in 1788, what is now known as Summer Hill was part of a larger area where people of the Wangal and Cadigal nations lived. There is research to show in the greater Sydney region 8000 - 10000 Aboriginal people were resident, fluctuating on seasons and during tribal conflicts. What is now called the Hawthorne Canal (originally Long Cove Creek) appears to have been the boundary between the Cadigal and Wangal Aboriginal nations. Today there is a small park in Summer Hill, called Cadigal Reserve, located at 1-4 Grosvenor Crescent. A bronze plaque placed by Ashfield Council names the reserve after the Cadigal (Eora) group of Koori people. Iron Cove and the mangrove-lined estuaries of the Long Cove and Iron Cove Creeks would have provided a good source of fish and molluscs, the most common food of the coastal tribes in the Sydney Basin.

In the early days of the colony, the land between Iron Cove and the Cooks River was known as the Kangaroo Ground. This suggests that the land was open terrain favoured by kangaroos, that they were common in the area and may have formed a significant part of the Aboriginal diet.

===European settlement===
The first land grant in this area was for a farm in 1794, to former convict and jailor Henry Kable. The land in the eastern corner of Summer Hill was an additional grant of made to Henry Kable in 1804. This eastern corner would subsequently become part of the estate of James Underwood. Underwood died in 1844 and left a will so complicated that it required special legislation before it could be subdivided.

An early known use of the name &quot;Summer Hill&quot; was on Saturday 8 December 1849 when The Bathurst Free Press reported it as the residence of James and Ann Bennett who were tried and convicted of participation in the Wellington Mail Robbery. However, the location reported most likely refers to the place now known as Summer Hill Creek, near Orange, New South Wales. The name was used in 1876, for a land subdivision adjacent to the present-day St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church. The name Summer Hill is thought to be a name chosen by the land sub-divider, presumably based on an attachment for England. Local historians regard the suggestion that the name is a derivation of &quot;Sunning Hill&quot; as a dubious story which has no substance.

Summer Hill&#x27;s largest mansion, &quot;Carleton&quot; (now the Grosvenor Hospital&#x27;s main building), was built in the early 1880s on Liverpool Road for Charles Carleton Skarrat. The suburb boomed with the opening of the railway station in 1879, and was followed by subdivision of much of the surrounding area. Between 1880 and 1910, the area became an upper-class suburb, and was a popular choice for professionals in banking and insurance who worked in the city. Subdivision of gardens for housing continued in the 1920s and 1930s, and socioeconomically the suburb changed as some of the wealthier inhabitants moved to the North Shore. Demolition of most of the surviving mansions in the 1970s allowed erection of home units, especially within walking distance of the railway station.

== Heritage listings ==
Summer Hill has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Grosvenor Crescent: Lewisham Sewage Aqueduct

==Climate==
The nearest site to Summer Hill is the Canterbury Racecourse AWS which is located several km to the south west of Summer Hill town centre.
==Churches and other places of worship==
There are a number of places of worship in Summer Hill. St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church was built in 1874, and is the oldest known building in the suburb. There is also a small primary school associated with the church and located next to it. The building was originally a private home known as &quot;Kelvin Grove&quot;, and owned by Mrs Jane Drynan. Much of the exterior of the church is original but none of the internal walls were retained when the building was converted into a church. Following Drynan&#x27;s death, Kelvin Grove was owned or leased by a succession of different people, including the Haberfield real-estate developer Richard Stanton, Croydon brick-maker William Downton, and two sisters named Freeman (one of whom was a nurse). In the 1920s and 1930s Kelvin Grove may have been used as a nursing home. The first mass was celebrated in Kelvin Grove on St Patrick&#x27;s day 1946, giving the church its name.

St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church has three distinctive internal transept arches, and was designed by a Presbyterian, Alexander Leckie Elphinstone Junior. The foundation stone was laid in 1883, and the top of the spire completed in 1906. The fast construction period, unusual for that time, was indicative of the area&#x27;s affluence. 

Recent Asian influences in Summer Hill have brought about the introduction of non-Christian places of worship. The Wong Tai Sin (or Kwan Yin Kur) temple is located on the corners of Kensington Road and Liverpool Road in a building that was a Masonic temple in the 1920s. The same building was converted into the current temple; the lower floor houses the Taoist deity of Wong Tai Sin, and the upper floor houses the Buddhist Bodhisattva of Kwan Yin.

==Schools==

Trinity Grammar School in Prospect Road is a private school catering for boys from Pre-K to Year 12. The schools&#x27;s site has been in continuous use for education for 120 years. The headmaster&#x27;s house at Trinity was erected circa 1877. The site operated as several different teaching institutions until it was purchased by the Anglican Church, becoming known as Trinity Grammar School in 1925. Trinity Grammar is one of many wealthy schools in New South Wales, and has previously received some of the largest government subsidies, when comparing total government subsidies per school. An expansion plan by Trinity involving the demolition of houses in nearby Seaview Street caused controversy in 2007. The development was nonetheless approved by the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.

Summer Hill Public School, located in Moonbie Street, is a primary school that caters for students from Kindergarten to Year 6. It offers a selective program, known as Opportunity Classes, for Year 5 and 6 students under the New South Wales Government&#x27;s Opportunity Class program. The school was established in 1883 in a wooden shed on of land that had been resumed from James Bartlett. The older buildings currently used at the school date back to 1913 while more modern buildings were constructed in 1977, 1998 and 2010. The school, designed in the Victorian Classical style, is listed on the Register of the National Estate.

Saint Patrick&#x27;s Catholic School is a private primary school, close to Summer Hill Public School.

==Commercial area==

Summer Hill&#x27;s shopping precinct is centred around a small town square with good pedestrian access, and is surrounded by cafés and restaurants along Lackey and Smith Streets. The suburb is very small by Australian standards, having a population of just over 6000, in an area of 110 hectares. It features some fine examples of architecture from the 19th and early 20th century.

The Summer Hill flour mill was built circa 1922, utilising the north–south goods railway line that was constructed during World War I. The silos were added from the 1950s onwards. The flour mill has been owned by various companies, including Mungo Scott, Allied Flour &amp; Starch and Goodman Fielder, and then Allied Mills. In October 2007, the mills were sold to a developer, EG Funds Management, who have since redeveloped the mill site into a residential and commercial precinct. The precinct is a site for a regular community market for produce and artisan goods. 

==Transport==

In Summer Hill on the day of the 2016 Census, the most common methods of travel to work for employed people were: Train 36.0%, Car, as driver 32.9%, Walked only 4.0%, Worked at home 3.8% and Train and bus 3.5%. Summer Hill is close to the main thoroughfares of Liverpool Road and Parramatta Road; although they are quite congested at peak times.

From 1915, Summer Hill was served by trams from Hurlstone Park. Trams left New Canterbury Road and went down Prospect Road, then swung right onto Smith Street. They turned onto Lackey Street, where they went right and terminated at the station. Low usage and rival buses saw the line closed in 1933, however some remains can be seen.
Summer Hill railway station is located on the Main Suburban railway line. The railway station was opened on 15 September 1879, and most of the local shops are clustered close to the station.

There are two stations serving Summer Hill on the Inner West Light Rail. These are - Lewisham West (adjacent to the former flour mill on the border with Lewisham) and Taverners Hill (near Parramatta Road). Access to the city is quicker by train, but the light rail may be used for some cross-regional journeys. It also interchanges with Dulwich Hill railway station on the Bankstown railway line.

There are four Transit Systems routes that service the area - the 480 and 483 follow routes along Parramatta Road and then Liverpool Road, the 461 travels along Parramatta Road and the 413 travels along Junction Road. Additionally, the N70, N71 and N80 NightRide buses on Parramatta Road run between Central and Penrith, Richmond and Hornsby respectively.

The area is also gradually becoming more bicycle friendly, with several bicycle paths in the suburb. A local group, &quot;Friends of the Greenway&quot; wish to see a bicycle and walking corridor built alongside the light rail.

<text>Judicial Watch (JW) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit American conservative activist group that files Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuits to investigate claimed misconduct by government officials. Founded in 1994, Judicial Watch has primarily targeted Democrats, in particular the administrations of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, as well as Hillary Clinton&#x27;s role in them. It was founded by attorney Larry Klayman, and has been led by Tom Fitton since 2003.

The organization has filed lawsuits against government climate scientists. Judicial Watch has made numerous false and unsubstantiated claims that have been picked up by right-wing news outlets and promoted by conservative figures. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly cited false claims by Judicial Watch about voter fraud. Various courts have dismissed the vast majority of its lawsuits.

==History==

Judicial Watch was founded in 1994 by attorney and right-wing activist Larry Klayman. Before leaving the organization in 2003, Klayman hired Tom Fitton, who became president of the organization. In October 2016, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Judicial Watch&#x27;s strategy is simple: Carpet-bomb the federal courts with Freedom of Information Act lawsuits.&quot; As of 2016, the organization had nearly fifty employees. Judicial Watch calls itself a nonpartisan educational foundation as well as a media organization. According to the &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;the group has forced the release of government records that would otherwise have been kept from the public.&quot; Critics accuse JW of &quot;weaponizing the Freedom of Information Act for political purposes.&quot;

===Clinton Administration===

Judicial Watch came to public attention after filing eighteen lawsuits against the administration of Democratic U.S. President Bill Clinton and other figures in the Clinton administration. An early lawsuit was filed by Judicial Watch on behalf of the Western Center for Journalism (WCJ) in 1998. The lawsuit alleged a retaliatory audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The WCJ was investigating the death of Clinton deputy White House counsel Vince Foster at the time.

The organization received considerable financial support from prominent Clinton critics, including US$7.74 million from conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. This led Clinton administration officials to accuse Judicial Watch of &quot;abusing the judicial system for partisan ends&quot;.

=== Bush administration ===
Judicial Watch was involved in a legal dispute with Vice President Dick Cheney in 2002 when the group filed a shareholder lawsuit against Halliburton. The lawsuit, which accused Halliburton of accounting fraud, alleged that &quot;when Mr. Cheney was chief executive of Halliburton, he and other directors inflated revenue reports, boosting Halliburton&#x27;s share price.&quot; As reported by &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; the court filing claims the oil-field-services concern overstated revenue by a total of $445 million from 1999 through the end of 2001.

In July 2003 Judicial Watch joined the environmental organization Sierra Club in suing the George W. Bush administration for access to minutes of Vice President Dick Cheney&#x27;s Energy Task Force.

===Obama administration===

Judicial Watch filed over twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails.

In February 2016, District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch&#x27;s motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the FOIA by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.

In March 2020, federal district court judge Royce Lamberth ruled that Clinton must provide a deposition. A three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Lamberth&#x27;s ruling in August. The full DC Circuit Court unanimously declined to hear an appeal in October, allowing the panel decision to stand. In March 2021, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by Judicial Watch.

===Trump administration===

In 2020 Judicial Watch obtained copies of emails related to the Steele Dossier through a FOIA lawsuit. 

In the months prior to the 2020 election, Judicial Watch filed or threatened lawsuits against several states related to alleged inaccuracy of their voter rolls, demanding that nearly two million names be purged. 

In October 2020, the group sued the state of California, claiming a law requiring corporations doing business in the state to have directors from sexual or racial minorities is unconstitutional, asserting &quot;The legislation&#x27;s requirement that certain corporations appoint a specific number of directors based upon race, ethnicity, sexual preference, and transgender status is immediately suspect and presumptively invalid and triggers strict scrutiny review by the court.&quot; In April 2022, a California judge agreed. In December 2022, a California appeals court also agreed.

A 2020 study by researchers from Northeastern, Harvard, Northwestern and Rutgers universities found that Judicial Watch was among the top five most shared fake news domains in tweets related to COVID-19, the others being &quot;The Gateway Pundit&quot;, &quot;InfoWars&quot;, &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot; and Natural News.

==Activities and controversies==

Judicial Watch&#x27;s main targets have been Democrats, particularly Bill and Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration.

===Commerce Department trade mission scandal===
In 1995, Judicial Watch, Inc. filed an action in the District Court under the FOIA, seeking information from the Department of Commerce (DOC) regarding DOC&#x27;s selection of participants for foreign trade missions. In May 1995, following a search in response to Judicial Watch&#x27;s FOIA requests, DOC produced approximately 28,000 pages of nonexempt information and withheld about 1,000 documents as exempt. Disputes arose between the parties over the adequacy of DOC&#x27;s search, and Judicial Watch charged that some DOC officials had destroyed or removed responsive documents. In December 1998, following discovery, the District Court granted partial summary judgment to Judicial Watch and ordered DOC to perform a new search. During the investigation, Nolanda B. Hill, a business partner of Commerce Secretary Ron Brown testified that Brown had told her that first lady Hillary Clinton was the driving force behind the efforts to raise as much money as possible for President Clinton&#x27;s reelection and the DNC. And further that, &quot;...companies were being solicited to donate large sums of money in exchange for their selection to participate on trade missions of the Commerce Department.&quot;

===Vince Foster conspiracy theory===

Judicial Watch helped promote the conspiracy theory that Vince Foster was murdered by the Clintons, and still has yet to provide convincing proof.

===White House visitor logs===

August 10, 2009 Judicial Watch sent a FOIA request to the US Secret Service asking that official White House visitor logs be made public. In August 2011, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell ordered the agency to process the group&#x27;s data request. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia partially affirmed the decision, holding that the Secret Service did not have to produce records of visitors to the president&#x27;s office.

===False Nancy Pelosi claims===

In 2010, Judicial Watch made inaccurate claims about air travel spending by Nancy Pelosi&#x27;s congressional delegation; Judicial Watch&#x27;s claims were picked up by the conservative conspiracy site &quot;WorldNetDaily&quot;. Judicial Watch also made false claims about Pelosi&#x27;s air travel in 2008.

===Operation Neptune Spear===

Osama bin Laden, leader of the terror group al-Qaeda, was killed in Pakistan on May 1, 2011, in a joint operation by the United States Navy SEALs and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). This operation was code-named &quot;Operation Neptune Spear&quot;. On May 2, 2011, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA request with the Department of Defense and the CIA for photographs and videos of bin Laden taken during or after the operation.

The government failed to produce any records within the required twenty days. In order to force compliance, Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the DOD and CIA on June 8, 2011. On January 31, 2014, after legal wrangling, the Pentagon released &quot;Operation Neptune Spear&quot; documents to Judicial Watch. One email had the subject line OPSEC Guidance / Neptune Spear and is proof that days after the original FOIA request U.S. Special Operations Commander, Admiral William McRaven ordered his subordinates to immediately destroy any Osama bin Laden photos they may have had.

===Bill Clinton/Taylor Branch tapes===

In 2012, Judicial Watch sued the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in an attempt to force NARA to declare audio tapes held at the William J. Clinton Presidential Library and Museum of Bill Clinton to be presidential records, seize them, and release them to Judicial Watch. During Clinton&#x27;s tenure in office, he had allowed historian Taylor Branch to interview him privately for a book Branch was planning to write. It was published in 2009 under the title &quot;The Clinton Tapes&quot;. NARA had declined to deem the tapes to be &quot;presidential records&quot;, and the federal judge dismissed the lawsuit stating that &quot;the relief that plaintiff seeks – that the Archivist assume &#x27;custody and control&#x27; of the audiotapes – is not available under the PRA.&quot; This case was called the &quot;Clinton socks case&quot; by former president Trump because the tapes were said to have been stored in Clinton&#x27;s socks drawer.

===Kennedy assassination records===

Judicial Watch filed a FOIA lawsuit against the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) to obtain the records from Robert F. Kennedy&#x27;s time as the Attorney General. The records covered sensitive intelligence operations conducted during the John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson administrations.

===Hillary Clinton email lawsuits===

Judicial Watch has currently filed twenty FOIA lawsuits involving the Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#x27;s emails.

On February 8, 2016, the FBI confirmed it was investigating Hillary Clinton&#x27;s use of a private email server during her time as Secretary of State. The Bureau was forced to formally acknowledge the investigation due to an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by Judicial Watch. FBI director James Comey had previously referenced the investigation, although the FBI had declined to confirm or deny it in court filings.

A federal judge ruled on February 23, 2016, that top aides to Hillary Clinton could be questioned under oath by Judicial Watch about her use of a private email server as secretary of state. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted Judicial Watch&#x27;s motion for discovery into whether the State Department and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton deliberately thwarted the Freedom of Information Act by using a private email server to obscure her communications from public records requests.

In May 2016 U.S. District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan granted &quot;discovery&quot; to Judicial Watch into former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton&#x27;s email system. This ruling allowed Judicial Watch to question two close Clinton aides, Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills, under oath. In a separate FOIA lawsuit concerning Hillary Clinton and the Benghazi terrorist attack, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth ruled Judicial Watch can conduct discovery into the email practices of Clinton and her top aides.

In a separate case, on March 29, 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth granted Judicial Watch limited discovery, citing potential bad faith by the government in responding to requests for documents related to talking points provided to Susan Rice in response to the Benghazi attack.

A FOIA lawsuit by Judicial Watch led to the release of 2,800 e-mails from Clinton aide Huma Abedin that were found on the laptop computer of Anthony Weiner, Abedin&#x27;s estranged husband. Five of the e-mails were classified.

===False claims about George Zimmerman protests===

In 2013, Judicial Watch claimed that the Department of Justice under the Obama administration organized protests against George Zimmerman after the Trayvon Martin shooting; &quot;PolitiFact&quot; said that this was &quot;mostly false&quot; and that while Justice Department employees were sent to Florida, they &quot;were sent with the idea of keeping the situation peaceful and calm, not to instigate or condone protests or violence.&quot;

===Islamic State in Mexico scares===

In 2014 and 2015, Judicial Watch falsely claimed that Islamic State (ISIS) had set up camp in Mexico; Judicial Watch&#x27;s claims were picked up by several right-wing news outlets.

===Collaboration with Steve Bannon and &quot;Breitbart News&quot;===

In 2013, Judicial Watch collaborated with Steve Bannon, executive chairman of the alt-right website &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, on the film &quot;District of Corruption&quot;, which critiqued the Obama administration. Judicial Watch paid Bannon&#x27;s group Victory Film Project $382,143 for the film. &quot;Politico&quot; described the film as an &quot;infomercial for the work of Judicial Watch&quot;.

Judicial Watch has advertised on &quot;Breitbart&quot; for a number of years. Judicial Watch&#x27;s president Tom Fitton said &quot;Liberal activists want to destroy Breitbart, but we won&#x27;t be cowed&quot;.

===Murder of Seth Rich conspiracy theory===

In 2017, Judicial Watch requested documents related to the death of DNC staffer Seth Rich; Seth Rich&#x27;s death led to debunked right-wing conspiracy theories alleging that Hillary Clinton or the Democratic Party had him killed.

===False voter fraud claims===

In August 2017, Judicial Watch falsely alleged that 11 California counties had more registered voters than their estimated populations of citizens eligible to vote; the claims were picked up by outlets such as &quot;Breitbart News&quot; and Russian propaganda network RT (Russia Today). Judicial Watch counted &quot;inactive voters&quot; in its tally, which is a list of people that California maintains of people who have been removed from active rolls after a mail ballot, voter guide or other official document was returned as undeliverable; California keeps such a list as a fail-safe in case eligible voters have been erroneously categorized as &quot;inactive&quot;. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said Judicial Watch&#x27;s claims were &quot;baseless&quot;, and &quot;bad math and dubious methodology&quot;. When the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; asked Judicial Watch to share its analysis of voter registration in California, Judicial Watch declined. Judicial Watch&#x27;s voter fraud claims came in the wake of President Donald Trump&#x27;s false claims of extensive voter fraud in California during the 2016 presidential election. Trump has subsequently repeatedly promoted Judicial Watch&#x27;s false claims about voter fraud.

On February 3, 2020, the day of the Iowa caucuses in the Democratic presidential primary, JW president Tom Fitton suggested that voter fraud was afoot in Iowa by falsely claiming that &quot;eight Iowa counties have more voter registrations than citizens old enough to register.&quot; The false assertion went viral on social media. Iowa&#x27;s Secretary of State, Paul Pate, a member of the Republican Party, debunked Fitton&#x27;s claim by linking to official voter registration data.

Fitton has made alarmist claims about voter fraud, saying &quot;We have all heard about voter fraud and the attempts by liberal media organs like the &quot;New York Times&quot; and Ivory Tower academics to dismiss it as a nonexistent problem. But is it real, widespread, and substantial to the point that it can decide elections.&quot;

===False claims about Trump Nazi billboard===

In 2017, Judicial Watch claimed that taxpayer money went into a billboard which depicted President Donald Trump as a Nazi. Further investigation showed that &quot;while the owner of the billboard founded the group that received city funding for the Art Detour event during which the Trump image went up, the billboard project itself did not receive city funding&quot;.

===Lawsuits against climate scientists===

Judicial Watch has filed lawsuits seeking to force the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to release the correspondence of climate scientists who published a 2015 study in the journal &quot;Science&quot;. The study had debunked one of the common claims made by those who reject the scientific consensus on climate change, namely that there existed global warming &quot;hiatus&quot; between 1998 and 2012. The Climate Science Legal Defense Fund (CSLDF), American Meteorological Society and Union of Concerned Scientists condemned Judicial Watch, saying that the disclosure of private communications between scientists &quot;would harm (or halt altogether) government scientists&#x27; ability to collaborate with colleagues, damage the government&#x27;s ability to recruit or retain top scientists, and deter critically important research into politically charged fields like climate change&quot;. The Judicial Watch lawsuit was inspired by Rep. Lamar Smith, a climate change denier who had accused the authors of the study of &quot;alter[ing] data&quot; to &quot;get the politically correct results they want.&quot;

===Mueller and FBI investigations into Russian interference===

In 2017, Judicial Watch helped to stoke Republican attacks against Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton has called for the Special Counsel investigation to be shut down, arguing that prosecutors in the probe were too biased against President Trump to conduct a credible investigation, a claim rejected by Republican Senators Thom Tillis and Bob Corker. Fitton furthermore called for shutting down the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) based on the claim that the Obama administration had turned it into a &quot;KGB-type operation.&quot;

===Accusations against the Clinton Foundation===
In January 2018, Judicial Watch president Tom Fitton repeated accusations against the Clinton Foundation that it had funneled money intended for charity work in Haiti to pay for Chelsea Clinton&#x27;s wedding. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; fact-checked the claim a year earlier and found that it was &quot;lacking any evidence&quot;.

=== George Soros smears ===
In October 2018, Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch stirred controversy when he appeared on Lou Dobbs&#x27; Fox Business show and used what many described as an anti-Semitic trope to suggest that the State Department was &quot;Soros-occupied&quot; territory. The remark echoed the anti-Semitic trope of a &quot;Zionist-occupied government&quot; to refer to Jewish control of the U.S. government. After widespread condemnation, Fox stated that Farrell would no longer be booked.

Farrell promoted the unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that a migrant caravan traveling through Central America towards the United States was being directed or funded by the &quot;Soros-occupied State Department&quot;. Judicial Watch had been engaged in what NPR described as a &quot;full-throated campaign against Soros&quot;. Among other things, Judicial Watch raised money by running ads with a call to action: &quot;Expose Soros!&quot;

===Senator&#x27;s letters to IRS===
According to Media Matters for America, in 2015, Judicial Watch claimed that three newly obtained letters sent by Democratic senator Carl Levin to the commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service &quot;discuss how to target conservative groups the senator claimed were &#x27;engaged in political activities&#x27;.&quot; Media Matters for America reported that Judicial Watch provided a link to the documents on its site, but said it failed to note that one Levin letter did not mention conservatives, while the other two mentioned an equal number of liberal/Democrat and conservative/Republican entities. The Judicial Watch claim was amplified by several conservative media outlets.

=== Statue removal ===
Judicial Watch has sought to remove a statue of Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa from downtown Tucson. Judicial Watch said the statue &quot;needs to go&quot; because &quot;Pancho Villa did great harm to people.&quot;

=== 2020 election voter suppression ===
In 2020, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton urged attendees of an event organized by the Council for National Policy to prevent mail-in ballots from being sent to voters, saying &quot;We need to stop those ballots from going out, and I want the lawyers here to tell us what to do.&quot;

==Larry Klayman lawsuits==

In 2003, Judicial Watch founder Larry Klayman left the organization to run for the United States Senate from Florida. In 2006, Klayman sued Judicial Watch and its president, Tom Fitton. Judicial Watch asserted several claims against Klayman as well; in 2019, Judicial Watch obtained a $2.8 million verdict against Klayman on its claims of breaches of the severance agreement and trademark infringement.

In 2012, a Judicial Watch employee falsely told Orly Taitz that Klayman had been convicted of not paying child support (Klayman had been indicted, but the charges were later dismissed). Taitz then published the employee&#x27;s comment on her website. Klayman sued Judicial Watch for defamation, and in 2014, a federal jury awarded Klayman $156,000 in compensatory damages and $25,000 in punitive damages.

In 2017, Freedom Watch (Klayman&#x27;s successor organization to Judicial Watch) unsuccessfully sued Judicial Watch and the American Conservative Union (ACU), alleging they violated the Sherman Act by colluding to prevent Freedom Watch from participating at the ACU&#x27;s Conservative Political Action Conference.

Klayman had represented three individuals who sued Judicial Watch, his former employer and client, but he failed to obtain Judicial Watch&#x27;s consent to waive his conflict of interest. Klayman maintained that the D.C. Bar had &quot;recognized there was no evidence of dishonesty or personal gain&quot;. In 2020, however, the D.C. Court of Appeals suspended Klayman&#x27;s license for 90 days and ordered him to complete a class on legal ethics.

==Peter Paul lawsuit==

In 2007, former donor Peter F. Paul sued Judicial Watch, accusing it of using his name to raise more than $15 million to support his lawsuit against Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton while doing little to advance his case. All of Paul&#x27;s claims were dismissed.

==Funding==

As of 2016, Judicial Watch had an annual budget of about $35 million. Between 1997 and 2002 Judicial Watch received $7,069,500 in 19 grants from a handful of foundations. The bulk of this funding came from three foundations: the Sarah Scaife Foundation, a funder of politically conservative causes; The Carthage Foundation, which merged into the Sarah Scaife Foundation in 2014; and the John M. Olin Foundation, Inc. As of 2010, the Sarah Scaife Foundation was the group&#x27;s largest contributor.

<doc id="911229" wikidata="Q1051896" url="?curid=911229" title="Cavity ring-down spectroscopy">
<text>Cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) is a highly sensitive optical spectroscopic technique that enables measurement of absolute optical extinction by samples that scatter and absorb light. It has been widely used to study gaseous samples which absorb light at specific wavelengths, and in turn to determine mole fractions down to the parts per trillion level. The technique is also known as cavity ring-down laser absorption spectroscopy (CRLAS).

A typical CRDS setup consists of a laser that is used to illuminate a high-finesse optical cavity, which in its simplest form consists of two highly reflective mirrors. When the laser is in resonance with a cavity mode, intensity builds up in the cavity due to constructive interference. The laser is then turned off in order to allow the measurement of the exponentially decaying light intensity leaking from the cavity. During this decay, light is reflected back and forth thousands of times between the mirrors giving an effective path length for the extinction on the order of a few kilometers.

If a light-absorbing material is now placed in the cavity, the mean lifetime decreases as fewer bounces through the medium are required before the light is fully absorbed, or absorbed to some fraction of its initial intensity. A CRDS setup measures how long it takes for the light to decay to 1/&quot;e&quot; of its initial intensity, and this &quot;ringdown time&quot; can be used to calculate the concentration of the absorbing substance in the gas mixture in the cavity.

==Detailed description==

Cavity ring-down spectroscopy is a form of laser absorption spectroscopy. In CRDS, a laser pulse is trapped in a highly reflective (typically R &gt; 99.9%) detection cavity. The intensity of the trapped pulse will decrease by a fixed percentage during each round trip within the cell due to absorption, scattering by the medium within the cell, and reflectivity losses. The intensity of light within the cavity is then determined as an exponential function of time.

:formula_1

The principle of operation is based on the measurement of a decay rate rather than an absolute absorbance. This is one reason for the increased sensitivity over traditional absorption spectroscopy, as the technique is then immune to shot-to-shot laser fluctuations. The decay constant, τ, which is the time taken for the intensity of light to fall to 1/e of the initial intensity, is called the ring-down time and is dependent on the loss mechanism(s) within the cavity. For an empty cavity, the decay constant is dependent on mirror loss and various optical phenomena like scattering and refraction:

:formula_2

where &quot;n&quot; is the index of refraction within the cavity, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light in vacuum, &quot;l&quot; is the cavity length, &quot;R&quot; is the mirror reflectivity, and &quot;X&quot; takes into account other miscellaneous optical losses. This equation uses the approximation that ln(1+&quot;x&quot;) ≈ &quot;x&quot; for &quot;x&quot; close to zero, which is the case under cavity ring-down conditions. Often, the miscellaneous losses are factored into an effective mirror loss for simplicity. An absorbing species in the cavity will increase losses according to the Beer-Lambert law. Assuming the sample fills the entire cavity,

:formula_3

where α is the absorption coefficient for a specific analyte concentration at the cavity&#x27;s resonance wavelength. The decadic absorbance, &quot;A&quot;, due to the analyte can be determined from both ring-down times.

:formula_4

Alternatively, the molar absorptivity, ε, and analyte concentration, &quot;C&quot;, can be determined from the ratio of both ring-down times. If &quot;X&quot; can be neglected, one obtains

:formula_5
When a ratio of species&#x27; concentrations is the analytical objective, as for example in carbon-13 to carbon-12 measurements in carbon dioxide, the ratio of ring-down times measured for the same sample at the relevant absorption frequencies can be used directly with extreme accuracy and precision.

==Advantages of CRDS==
There are two main advantages to CRDS over other absorption methods:

First, it is not affected by fluctuations in the laser intensity. In most absorption measurements, the light source must be assumed to remain steady between blank (no analyte), standard (known amount of analyte), and sample (unknown amount of analyte). Any drift (change in the light source) between measurements will introduce errors. In CRDS, the ringdown time does not depend on the intensity of the laser, so fluctuations of this type are not a problem. Independency from laser intensity makes CRDS needless to any calibration and comparison with standards.

Second, it is very sensitive due to its long pathlength. In absorption measurements, the smallest amount that can be detected is proportional to the length that the light travels through a sample. Since the light reflects many times between the mirrors, it ends up traveling long distances. For example, a laser pulse making 500 round trips through a 1-meter cavity will effectively have traveled through 1 kilometer of sample.

Thus, the advantages include:
*High sensitivity due to the multipass nature (i.e. long pathlength) of the detection cell.
*Immunity to shot variations in laser intensity due to the measurement of a rate constant.
*Wide range of use for a given set of mirrors; typically, ±5% of the center wavelength. 
*High throughput, individual ring down events occur on the millisecond time scale.
*No need for a fluorophore, which makes it more attractive than laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) for some (e.g. rapidly predissociating) systems.
*Commercial systems available.

==Disadvantages of CRDS==
*Spectra cannot be acquired quickly due to the monochromatic laser source which is used. Having said this, some groups are now beginning to develop the use of broadband LED or supercontinuum sources for CRDS, the light of which can then be dispersed by a grating onto a CCD, or Fourier transformed spectrometer (mainly in broadband analogues of CRDS). Perhaps more importantly, the development of CRDS based techniques have now been demonstrated over the range from the near UV to the mid-infrared. In addition, the frequency-agile rapid scanning (FARS) CRDS technique has been developed to overcome the mechanical or thermal frequency tuning which typically limits CRDS acquisition rates. The FARS method utilizes an electro-optic modulator to step a probe laser side band to successive cavity modes, eliminating tuning time between data points and allowing for acquisition rates about 2 orders of magnitude faster than traditional thermal tuning.
*Analytes are limited both by the availability of tunable laser light at the appropriate wavelength and also the availability of high reflectance mirrors at those wavelengths.
*Expense: the requirement for laser systems and high reflectivity mirrors often makes CRDS orders of magnitude more expensive than some alternative spectroscopic techniques.

<text>Dhar is a city located in Dhar district of the Malwa region in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The city is the administrative headquarters of the Dhar district. Before Indian independence from Great Britain, it was the capital of the Dhar princely state.
== Location ==
Dhar is situated between 21°57&#x27; to 23°15&#x27; N and 74°37&#x27; to 75°37&#x27; E. The city is bordered in the north by Ratlam, to the east by parts of Indore, in the south by Barwani, and to the west by Jhabua and Alirajpur. The town is located west of Mhow. It is located above sea level. It possesses, alongside its old ramparts, many buildings which contain records of cultural, historical and national importance.

== Historic places and monuments ==

The most visible parts of ancient Dhar are the massive earthen ramparts, which are best preserved on the western and southern sides of the town. These were most likely built at beginning of the 9th century. Wall remains show that the city was circular in plan and surrounded by a series of tanks and moats, similar to the city of Warangal, in the Deccan. The circular ramparts of Dhar, unique in north India and an important legacy of the Paramāras, are unprotected and have been slowly dismantled by brick-makers and others using the wall material for construction. On the north-east side of the town, the ramparts and moats have disappeared beneath modern homes and other buildings. There are many stepwells of various periods in Dhar which are dried or filled with sewage and trash. Till now, 46 stepwells are listed in the Dhar premises, and a work of reviving those stepwells is an ongoing plan for the year 2024. 

===Fort===

The historic parts of Dhar are dominated by an impressive sandstone fortress on a small hill. The fortress is thought to have been built by Muhammad bin Tughluq, the Sultan of Delhi, most likely on the site of the ancient Dhārāgiri mentioned in early sources. One of the gateways, added later, dates to 1684–85 in the time of &#x27;Ālamgīr. Inside the fort there is a deep rock-cut cistern of great age, and a later palace of the Mahārāja of Dhar that incorporates an elegant pillared porch from the Mughal period, possibly built in the mid-17th century. The palace area houses an outdoor museum with a small collection of temple fragments and images dating to medieval times.

===Museum===
Inside the fort, a large number of sculptures and antiquities from Dhar and its neighbourhood are kept in utilitarian buildings constructed in the late 19th century. Some pieces from the collection have been moved to Mandu where the Department of Archaeology, Museums and Archives has created a museum with a range of displays in the &#x27;Barnes Koti&#x27;, a Sultanate-period building used by Captain Ernest Barnes, the political agent of the Bhopawar agency.

===Tomb of Shaykh Changāl===
On the overgrown ramparts of the medieval city, overlooking the old moat, is the tomb of Shaykh Abdullah Shāh Changāl, a warrior saint. The earliest evidence for the tomb comes from an inscription of 1455; the building was entirely rebuilt in the second half of the 20th century.
===Iron Pillar===
One of the most significant historical attractions at Dhār is the ancient iron pillar. Fragments of it are at the Lat Mosque where the three surviving portions are displayed outside the mosque on a platform thanks to the conservation efforts of the Archaeological Survey of India. The pillar, which was nearly 13.2 m high according to the most recent assessment, carries several inscriptions, the most important recording a visit by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1598 while on a military campaign in the Deccan. The pillar&#x27;s original stone footing is displayed nearby.
===Lat Mosque===

The Lat Masjid, or &#x27;Pillar Mosque&#x27;, located to the south of the town, was built as the Jami&#x27; Mosque by Dilawar Khan in 1405. It derives its name from the iron pillar (&quot;lāṭ&quot; in Hindi), which lies in the immediate campus of the mosque. 
===Kamāl Maulā Campus===
The Kamāl Maulā is a spacious enclosure containing a number of tombs, the most notable being that of Shaykh Kamāl Mālvī or Kamāl al-Dīn (&quot;circa&quot; 1238–1331). Kamāl al-Dīn was a follower of Farīd al-Dīn Gaṅj-i Shakar (&quot;circa&quot; 1173–1266) and the Chishti saint Nizamuddin Auliya (1238–1325) and migrated to Malwa with his brother in the late 1200s. His descendants have served as custodians of Kamāl al-Dīn&#x27;s tomb in an unbroken line for 700 years.
===Bhoj Shala===
Except for the Mihrab and Minbar, which were purpose-built for the monument, the hypostyle hall immediately next the tomb of Kamāl Maula is made of recycled temple columns and other architectural parts. It is similar to the Lāṭ Masjid, but was built earlier, as an inscription from 1392 described records of repairs by Dilāwar Khān. In 1903, a Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions from the time of Arjunavarman (&quot;circa&quot; 1210–15) were found in the walls of the building by K. K. Lele, Superintendent of Education in the Princely State of Dhar. The engraved inscriptions are displayed inside the entrance. One text includes parts of a drama called &quot;Vijayaśrīnāṭikā&quot; composed by Madana, the king&#x27;s preceptor, or &#x27;Bālasarasvatī&#x27;. Other tablets noted by Lele include a slab inscribed with the &quot;Kūrmaśataka&quot; – verses in praise of the Kūrma incarnation of Viṣhṇu – and serpentine inscriptions containing the grammatical rules of the Sanskrit language. These finds, particularly the grammatical inscriptions, prompted Lele to name the building Bhoj Shala, or &#x27;Hall of Bhoja&#x27;, in reference to King Bhoja (&quot;circa&quot; 1000–55), the author of several works on poetics and grammar such as the famous &quot;Sarasvatīkaṇṭhābharaṇa&quot; or &#x27;Necklace of Sarasvatī&#x27;. In 1908, C. E. Luard did not follow Lele in using the term Bhoj Shala but mentions traditions describing the building as &#x27;Raja Bhoja&#x27;s school&#x27;.

===Cenotaphs and Old City Palace===
The old city palace of the Puar (Pawar) clan, a branch of the Marathas, is now used as a school. It is a plain, medium-sized building built around 1875. A marble statue of the Jain goddess Ambikā, discovered on the site of the palace in 1875, is now in the British Museum. Of the same time period as the palace are a collection of domed cenotaphs of the Pawar rulers on the edge of the large tank known as Muñj Talab. The name of the tank was probably derived from Vākpati Muñja (10th century), the first Paramāra king that entered Mālwa and made Ujjain his main administrative seat.
===Tomb of Shaykh Zahīr al-Dīn Qādirī===
The tomb said to be that of Shaykh Zahīr al-Dīn Qādirī, a contemporary of Kamāl-al-Dīn, stands in the fields on the western side of the old circular city.
===Tomb of Bugḍe Pīr===
On the east side of the old town the tomb of Tāj al-Dīn &#x27;Aṭā&#x27;ullah. Popularly known as Bugḍe Pīr, the building is a small domical structure of the seventeenth century. &#x27;Aṭā&#x27;ullah was born in 1578-79 and enjoyed the patronage of Nur Jahan.

===Agency House===
Another colonial era building at Dhar, located outside the old town on the road to Indore, is the Agency House. It was built by the Public Works Department during British rule and was the center of the administration of Dhar State and the Central India Agency. The building has been abandoned and is now in ruins.

===Jheera Bagh===

In the 1860s, the Powars built a palace at Hazīra Bāgh, adjacent to the road to Māṇḍū. Known as the Jheera Bāgh Palace, the complex was renovated by Mahārāja Anand Rao Pawar IV in the 1940s and is now run as a heritage hotel. Designed in an unpretentious art deco style, it is considered to be one of the most elegant and forward-looking examples of early modern architecture in North India.

== Political history ==
The town of Dhar, derived from &quot;Dhārā Nagara&quot; (&#x27;city of sword blades&#x27;), is of considerable antiquity, the first reference to it appearing in an inscription in Jaunpur during the Maukhari dynasty (6th century). Dhar rose to prominence when it was made the primary seat of the Paramara chiefs of Malwa by Vairisiṃha (&quot;circa&quot; 920-45 CE). Vairisimha appears to have transferred his headquarters to Dhar from Ujjain. During the rule of the Paramāras, Dhar was a respected centre of culture and learning, especially under the rule of King Bhoja (circa 1000–1055). The wealth and splendor of Dhar drew the attention of competing dynasties in the 11th century. The Cāḷukyas of Kalyāṇa under Someśvara I (circa CE 1042–68) captured and burnt the city, also occupying Māṇḍū (ancient Māṇḍava). Dhar was subsequently sacked by the Cāḷukyas of Gujarāt under Siddharāja. The devastation and political fragmentation caused by these wars meant that there was no significant opposition when Ala ud din Khilji, the Sultān of Delhi, dispatched an army to Mālwa in the early 14th century. The region was annexed to Delhi, and Dhar was made the capital of the province under &#x27;Ayn al-Mulk Mūltānī, who served as governor until 1313. The events that occurred during the following seventy years are unclear, but some time in A.H. 793/C.E. 1390-91 Dilawar Khan was appointed &quot;muqṭi&quot; of Dhar (and also the governor of Mālwa) by Sulṭān Muḥammad Shāh. Dilāwar Khān took the title &#x27;Amīd Shāh Dā&#x27;ūd&#x27; and mandated the &quot;khutba&quot; to be read in his name in A.H. 804/C.E. 1401-02, thereby establishing himself as an independent sulṭān. Upon his death in 1406, his son Hoshang Shah became king, with his capital situated in Māṇḍū. In the time of Akbar, Dhar fell under the dominion of the Mughals, and remained under Mughal control until 1730, when the town was conquered by the Marathas.

In late 1723, Bajirao, at the head of a large army and accompanied by his lieutenants Malharrao Holkar, Ranoji Shinde (Scindia) and Udaji Rao Pawar, swept through Malwa. A few years earlier, the Mughal Emperor had been forced to relinquish to the Marathas the right to collect &quot;Chauth&quot; taxes in Malwa and Gujarat. This levy was financially beneficial to the Maratha caste, as both the king Shahu and his Peshwa, Bajirao, were in large amounts of debt at the time. Agriculture in the Deccan depended heavily on the timeliness and duration of the monsoons. The most important source of royal revenue was, therefore, the C&quot;hauth&quot; (a 25% tax on produce) and S&quot;ardeshmukhi&quot; (a ten per cent surcharge) exacted by the Marathas. The revenues the Marathas collected from their own lands were not sufficient to run the administration of their state and finance their large military expenditure, as their government was focused on conquest and not economic development.

The Marathan armies eventually defeated the Mughal governor and attacked the capital Ujjain. Bajirao established military outposts in the country as far north as Bundelkhand.

Towards the end of the 18th century and in the early part of the 19th century, the Marathan state was subject to a series of spoliations by Scindia of Gwalior and Holkar of Indore, (descendants of Ranoji Scindia and Malharao Holkar), but was saved from annihilation by the strong rule of the adoptive mother of the fifth raja.

===Dhar State===

After the Third Anglo-Maratha War of 1818, Dhar fell under British rule. The Dhar State was designated as a princely state of India, in the Bhopawar Agency of the Central India Agency. It included several Rajput and Bhil feudatories and had an area of . The state was confiscated by the British after the Revolt of 1857. In 1860, it was restored to Raja Anand Rao III Pawar, then a minor, with the exception of the detached district of Bairusia which was granted to the Begum of Bhopal. Anand Rao, who received the personal title Maharaja and the KCSI in 1877, died in 1898; he was succeeded by Udaji Rao II Pawar.

=== Dhar Thikanas ===
A separate department whose purpose was to superintend &quot;Thakurs&quot; and &quot;Bhumias&quot;, called &quot;Department of Thakurans, Bhumians and Thikanejat&quot;, was established in 1921. At the time there were 22 such estates in the state of Dhar.

The &quot;jagir&quot; lands of the nobles of Dhar (feudatory estates), all of whom paid tribute to the Darbar, were divided between Thakurs and Bhumias.
The Thakurs, with a few exceptions, were Rajput landholders whose estates were located in the north of the state. Locally, the Thakurs were called Talukdars and their holdings called &quot;kothari&quot;. By caste, there were 8 Rathore Rajputs, one Pawar and one Kayasth.

The Bhumias, or &quot;Allodial&quot; Chiefs, were all Bhilalas, a clan claiming to be of mixed Bhil and Rajput (Chauhan) descent. Their grants were originally obtained from the Darbar on the understanding that they would keep the peace among the Bhils and other hill tribes. They paid yearly tribute to the Darbar, in turn receiving cash allowances (Bhet-Ghugri), an ancient feudal custom.

=== Political representation and Royal Legacy ===
Bhartiya Janata Party politician Neena Vikram Verma serves as a member of the Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly for the Dhar-Vidhan-Sabha Constituency.

In 2024, Savitri Thakur of the Bharatiya Janata Party was elected as a Member of Parliament representing the Dhar constituency.

Maharaja Shrimant Hemendra Singh Rao Pawar is the present titular head of the Kshatriya Maratha Pawar (Puar) dynasty of the State of Dhar.

== Demographics ==
As of the 2011 Indian Census, Dhar had a total population of 93,917, of which 48,413 were males and 45,504 were females. 11,947 were between 0 and 6 years old. The total number of literate people in Dhar was 68,928. 73.4% of the population was literate, with a male literacy rate of 78.1% and a female literacy rate of 68.4%. The literacy rate of the 7+ population in Dhar was 84.1%, of which the male literacy rate was 89.9% and the female literacy rate was 78.0%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 7,549 and 16,636 respectively. As of 2011, Dhar has 18531 households.

This is an increase from the 2001 India census, when Dhar had a population of 75,472, of which males constituted 52% and females 48%. In 2001, Dhar had an average literacy rate of 70%, higher than the national average of 59.5%. Male literacy was 76% and female literacy was 63%. In 2001, 14% of the population of Dhar was under 6 years of age.

===Religion===
The majority of the population adheres to Hinduism, with significant groups following Islam and Jainism.

== Postal information ==

In 1897, primitive stamps with entirely native text were issued. The second definitive issue bore the name &quot;Dhar State&quot; in Latin script; with a total of 8 stamps. Since 1901, Indian stamps have been in use in Dhar.

==Discovery of Dinosaur Fossils==
Dhar, being part of the Lameta Formation, is well known for the discovery of fossils of dinosaurs, dinosaur nests, shark teeth, tree fossils, and marine mollusks. These fossils are very well preserved due to the Deccan volcanism causing a flow of volcanic lava over them. Fossils of Titanosaurus, Isisaurus, Indosaurus, Indosuchus, Laevisuchus and Rajasaurus have been discovered here.

Unique eggs have been discovered in Dhar region which indicates that the species reproduced like birds and the first egg within egg (ovum-in-ovo) or multi-shelled egg has been discovered here.

== Notable people ==
Baji Rao II, the last of the Peshwas, was born in Dhar.

<doc id="911238" wikidata="Q112251" url="?curid=911238" title="Alfred Grünwald (librettist)">
<text>Alfred Grünwald (1884–1951) was an Austrian author, librettist, and lyricist. Some of his better-known works were written in conjunction with the composers Franz Lehár, Emmerich Kálmán, Oscar Straus, Paul Abraham, and Robert Stolz.

==Life and career==
Grünwald was born on 16 February 1884 in Vienna. Following his schooling, he worked in a number of jobs, including as supernumerary, chorister, and for a theatrical agency, before turning to writing as theatre critic for a Vienna newspaper. From 1909, he wrote Kabarett sketches and librettos for operettas, often collaborating with Julius Brammer.

As a Jew, he was arrested after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria in 1938. When he was temporarily released, the family fled to Paris, then in 1940 via Casablanca and Lisbon to New York City. During World War II he was employed for a time with the Office of War Information translating American songs for transmission by radio to Germany.

A number of Grünwald&#x27;s librettos were produced on Broadway. These included &quot;Countess Maritza&quot; (1926), &quot;The Yankee Princess&quot; (1922), &quot;The Circus Princess&quot; (1927), and &quot;The Duchess of Chicago&quot; (1929). He also wrote a number of comedies, including &quot;Dancing Partner&quot; (1930), written in collaboration with Alexander Engel and produced on Broadway by David Belasco. He was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers.

Grünwald died on 24 February 1951 in Forest Hills, Queens, New York City.

His son Henry A. Grunwald was a journalist and diplomat (US ambassador to Austria from 1988 to 1990).

<text>Sir Nicholas Hardwick Fairbairn, (24 December 1933 – 19 February 1995) was a Scottish politician and advocate. He was the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Kinross and Western Perthshire from October 1974 to 1983, and then for Perth and Kinross until his death in 1995. He was Solicitor General for Scotland from 1979 to 1982.

==Early life==
Nicholas Fairbairn was born in Edinburgh on 24 December 1933, the third child and second son of Mary Ann More-Gordon and Ronald Fairbairn, a psychoanalyst. 

According to Fairbairn&#x27;s autobiography &quot;A Life is Too Short&quot; (1987), his father adopted the maternal role after his mother rejected him at birth. Fairbairn describes their relationship from when he could converse with his father, for the next 20 years until old age affected his father, like that of twins with his father treating him as &quot;his equal and confidant&quot;. Fairbairn credited this relationship as enabling him to &quot;withstand the trauma and rejection I felt... enabled me to feel secure for the rest of my life against any rejection or misfortune... made me profoundly in awe of father figures and left me with a consistent feeling... that I am still a child.&quot; Fairbairn also said he was named after Saint Nicholas as he was born on Christmas Eve.

He was educated at Loretto School and the University of Edinburgh, where he graduated with an MA and an LLB. At the age of 23, he was called to the Scots Bar.

In 1962, he married into the Scottish aristocracy—his wife, Hon. Elizabeth Mackay, was the daughter of the 13th Lord Reay. They had four children and divorced in 1979. 

In 1966 Fairburn had an affair with Esther Rantzen. In her autobiography she wrote:
He began in Conservative politics by standing in the Edinburgh Central seat (which had been a Labour-held marginal seat during the 1950s) in 1964 and 1966, positioning himself as a liberal Conservative.

==Political career==
Fairbairn&#x27;s career took off in the early 1970s. In 1972 he was appointed a Scottish Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC). After the former Prime Minister Alec Douglas-Home announced his retirement from Parliament between the 1974 elections, Fairbairn was selected to succeed him. He won the seat in October 1974 with a majority of just 53 votes over the Scottish National Party.

His right-wing views endeared him to Margaret Thatcher, and when she formed her Government after winning the 1979 general election she appointed him Solicitor-General for Scotland. On one occasion he wrote that the functions of this office were &quot;to form a second pair of hands and often a first brain for the Lord Advocate&quot;. When the Conservatives were elected Fairbairn was the only Scottish QC in the Scottish Parliamentary Conservative Party, and it is thought that as a senior advocate of some considerable achievement in the criminal courts, he fully expected to be appointed Lord Advocate. However, his colourful opinions and reputation are thought to have impelled the then Lord Justice General, Lord Emslie, to tell Thatcher that the Scottish judiciary and legal profession were deeply opposed to having such a man as the senior law officer in Scotland. That led Thatcher to offer Fairbairn the secondary post of Solicitor-General for Scotland, and give the post of Lord Advocate to the then Dean of the Faculty of Advocates, J P H Mackay QC, who was then not even a member of the Conservative Party.

Fairbairn was known at Parliament for his flamboyant Scottish baronial tartan dress. He always carried a silver miniature, working revolver on a chain attached to his belt. He was reputedly the only MP to use the House of Commons Parliamentary snuff box. He had a mistress, Pamela Milne, who attempted suicide at his London home in 1981. 

Just as it seemed he had managed to survive, a major controversy emerged in Glasgow. A prosecution was dropped in a case involving the gang rape and mutilation of a young woman after doctors determined she was too traumatized to serve as a credible witness. One journalist telephoned the Solicitor-General to ask why, and Fairbairn told him. This was a major breach of protocol, and Fairbairn had to resign. 

In his resignation letter of 21 January 1982, he admitted to making &quot;errors of judgment&quot; in his dealings with the press and that in the circumstances &quot;I ought no longer to remain in office as Solicitor-General for Scotland&quot;. After a media campaign, a private prosecution was brought by the victim in 1982 under ancient Scottish law. It was known as the Carol X case. All three of the perpetrators were convicted, with one sentenced to 12 years in prison.

In reporting his resignation, &quot;The Glasgow Herald&quot; claimed that &quot;it was clear&quot; that his decision to leave office &quot;had been forced upon him.&quot; According to the &quot;Herald&quot; up until the point he went to see Thatcher in the Prime Minister&#x27;s room in the House of Commons, he &quot;apparently had not considered resignation&quot;. However, when he arrived he was &quot;confronted by a letter of resignation already typed out for him to sign.&quot; After a ten minute discussion he, &quot;with some reluctance&quot;, agreed resignation was the best course of action. Matthew Parris noted that despite the manner of his departure he showed loyalty to Thatcher whom he described afterwards as &quot;probably the warmest and kindest human being that those who have met her have ever encountered&quot;.

Fairbairn was again in the news in October 1982 when he was cited in the divorce case of investment consultant Alasdair MacInnes, having had an affair with MacInnes&#x27; wife Suzanne (whom Fairbairn ultimately married in 1983). When this was reported he launched an attack on the press for what he viewed as its &quot;hypocritical moral crusades&quot;.

In 1983, Fairbairn was elected an honorary Fellow of the International Academy of Trial Lawyers, and he became a Trustee of the Royal Museums of Scotland in 1987. He was also President of the Society for the Preservation of Duddingston Village (an eastern suburb of Edinburgh).

Fairbairn was knighted in the 1988 Birthday Honours for political service.

==Views==
&quot;The Independent&quot; said about Fairbairn&#x27;s politics, &quot;At heart he was a libertarian who wanted to espouse human rights and civil liberties. Realising the temper of the times, he moved during the Seventies to the radical right: the clash this involved with his instinctive penchant for moral and personal freedom made him an anarchist of the right&quot;.

He called members of the band Throbbing Gristle &quot;wreckers of civilisation&quot; in 1976 in a row over public funding of the arts. He also criticised Scottish performers Simple Minds and Annie Lennox for taking part in the 1988 Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute concert in Wembley Stadium, describing them as &quot;left-wing scum&quot;. Fairbairn was quoted: &quot;These so-called stars like Annie Lennox and Jim Kerr are just out to line their own pockets... and what Annie Lennox and Jim Kerr said at Wembley came out of no love for Nelson Mandela. It came from a desire to make money.&quot;

Fairbairn was a staunch supporter of Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which prohibited local authorities from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot;. He described the gay tenor Peter Pears as suffering from the &quot;morbid squint&quot; of homosexuality. 

During parliamentary debates in 1994 regarding equalising the age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual acts, Fairbairn was called to order when he graphically described an act of anal sex between men, which he considered a &quot;psycho-pathological perversion&quot;. He voted against equalising the age of consent in 1994 although earlier in his career had been a supporter of the Scottish Minorities Group, a Scottish gay rights organisation.

==Final years==
In 1983 he married Suzanne Mary Wheeler, known as Lady Sam Fairbairn.

Fairbairn had stated that he would stand down at the 1997 general election, but he died before then, at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, on 19 February 1995, aged 61. The cause was liver disease, a consequence of longstanding alcoholism. In the subsequent by-election, his seat was won by Roseanna Cunningham of the Scottish National Party, with the Conservatives falling to third place.

==Posthumous allegations of child abuse and sexual assaults==

Though he was never charged with any offence, allegations of child molestation against Fairbairn emerged after his death. He was also posthumously accused of sexual assault against an adult female. It was also alleged that his name was included on a list of &#x27;VIPs&#x27; who frequented a &#x27;paedophile-friendly&#x27; guest house in London; however, these specific claims are widely regarded as a hoax.

<text>Nicolas Leblanc (; December 6, 1742 – January 16, 1806) was a French chemist and surgeon who discovered how to manufacture soda ash from common salt.

== Earlier days ==
Leblanc was born in Ivoy le Pré, Cher, France on 6 December 1742. His father, a minor official at an iron works, died in 1751. Leblanc was sent to Bourges to live with Dr. Bien, a close family friend. Under the influence of his guardian, Leblanc developed an interest in medicine. When Bien died in 1759, Leblanc enrolled at the École de Chirurgie (College of Surgeons) in Paris to study medicine.

Graduating with a master&#x27;s degree in surgery, Leblanc opened a medical practice. He married in 1776, and the couple&#x27;s first child followed three years later. Unable to provide adequately for his family on the medical fees he obtained from his patients, Leblanc in 1780 accepted a position as the private physician to the household of the Louis Philip II, Duke of Orléans.

== The Leblanc process ==
In 1775, the French Academy of Sciences offered a prize for a process whereby soda ash could be produced from salt. The French Academy wanted to promote the production of much-needed sodium carbonate from inexpensive sodium chloride.

By 1791, Nicolas Leblanc had succeeded in producing sodium carbonate from salt by a 2-step process. In the first step, sodium chloride is mixed with concentrated sulfuric acid at temperatures of 800–900 °C; hydrogen chloride gas is evolved, leaving solid sodium sulfate. In the second step, the sodium sulfate is crushed, mixed with charcoal and limestone and again heated in a furnace.

The prize was awarded to Nicolas Leblanc for a process which used sea salt and sulfuric acid as the raw materials. Later a plant (of his own) was in operation producing 320 tons of soda ash per year. The process, however, is now obsolete and is superseded by the Solvay process.

== Final days ==
Two years later the plant was confiscated by the French revolutionary government, which refused to pay him the prize money he had earned ten years earlier.

In 1802 Napoleon returned the plant (but not the prize) to him, but by then Leblanc could not afford to run it. He committed suicide by a gunshot to the head in 1806.

== Legacy ==

William Losh visited Paris to study Leblanc&#x27;s process. In 1807, Losh, Wilson and Bell opened the first alkali works in England that used the Leblanc process, at Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne.

<text>USS &quot;Virginia&quot; (SP-274) was a yacht in the United States Navy.

She was constructed in 1910 by Elco at Bayonne, New Jersey. The ship was purchased by the Navy on 5 May 1917 from Mr. Daniel W. Smith of Detroit and delivered to the Government on 2 July.

To avoid the confusion of having several ships of the same name, the Navy discarded her name and referred to her simply as &quot;SP-274&quot;, though references to her as &quot;Virginia (SP-274)&quot; in the Navy Register for 1918 indicate that she probably retained her name informally. Commissioned on 10 August 1917, &quot;SP-274&quot; was assigned to the 9th Naval District section patrol; and, although the records are unclear, she probably operated out of Detroit, conducting patrols on Lake Michigan.

She served until 12 August 1919, at which time her name was struck from the Navy Register; and, by 18 March 1920, she had sunk at the Detroit Dock. Here again, the records are unclear with regard to whether she sank before or after being struck. In any event, her sunken hulk was sold to J. A. Nicholson of Morris Heights, New Jersey, on 1 April 1920.

<doc id="911254" wikidata="Q6270707" url="?curid=911254" title="Jon Fishman">
<text>Jon Fishman (born February 19, 1965) is an American drummer and co-founder of the band Phish, which was, in part, named after him. He is credited with co-writing nineteen Phish songs, eight with a solo credit.

==Early life==
Fishman was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Syracuse, New York. Fishman had a passion for the drums from an early age and emulated John Bonham, the drummer for Led Zeppelin, Bill Bruford of Yes and King Crimson, along with Keith Moon of The Who. He went to Jamesville-Dewitt High School in a suburb of Syracuse. After graduation in 1983, he attended the University of Vermont to study engineering. Shortly after his arrival, he met Mike Gordon and Trey Anastasio and founded the band Phish. Deciding against engineering, he and Anastasio transferred to Goddard College.

==Musical career==
=== Phish ===
The band Phish was named after him (he is commonly referred to as &quot;Fish&quot; among many other nicknames) though other explanations for the name have been given. In addition to drumming, he also sings back-up vocals and occasionally lead-vocals (usually on cover songs, most of them humorous – the best examples are Prince&#x27;s &quot;Purple Rain&quot;, Syd Barrett’s &quot;Love You&quot;, and &quot;Terrapin&quot;, Neil Diamond&#x27;s &quot;Cracklin&#x27; Rosie&quot;, Will Smith&#x27;s song &quot;Gettin&#x27; Jiggy Wit It&quot;, and Syd Barrett-era Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Bike&quot;). Worthy of note are his more serious vocal efforts, including lead vocals on Phish&#x27;s cover of the Talking Heads song &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot;, and his vocal duties on the Phish originals, &quot;The Moma Dance&quot;, &quot;Taste&quot;, and &quot;Ghost&quot;. He is well known on tour for his Electrolux vacuum cleaner solos and playing while wearing a donut-printed muumuu dress. He has admitted to taking acid before playing early in the band&#x27;s career.

Fishman regularly performs with Phish wearing a blue muumuu dress with a pattern of red annuli. In 2015, Phish filed to trademark the pattern on Fishman&#x27;s dress, but the request was tentatively denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.

==Equipment==
Fishman uses a variety of drums and cymbals on his kit; brands such as Noble &amp; Cooley, Gretsch, Ludwig, Yamaha, Ayotte, Eames, Zildjian, Sabian, Paiste, and Wuhan. He also uses Remo drum heads, Vic Firth drum sticks, and LP percussion accessories. 
His setup consists of:
*22x14 AYOTTE round badge bass drum.
*6x6 Noble &amp; Cooley tom (in Black Finish)
*8x7 Noble &amp; Cooley tom
*10x7 Noble &amp; Cooley tom
*12x8 Noble &amp; Cooley tom
*14x12 Gretsch Floor Tom
*16x14 Gretsch Floor Tom
*14x6.5 Ayotte 18-Ply Maple Snare (or 14x6.5 Precision 21-Ply Maple Snare w/ custom 3D phish logo).

Cymbals include:
*14&quot; hi-hats (Zildjian K Light Hats)
*13&quot; Paiste Mega Cup Chime
*15&quot; Istanbul Agop Medium Thin Crash
*8&quot; Zildjian A Custom Splash
*16&quot; Zildjian K Thin Crash
*17&quot; Sabian Cymbals HH Crash
*21&quot; Sabian AA Dry Ride
*20&quot; Zildjian A Custom Flat Ride w/ rivets
*18&quot; Zildjian Oriental China Trash
*22&quot; Zildjian Pang

He uses an LP Black Beauty cowbell, an LP Rock Ridge Rider cowbell, and a set of 4 LP temple blocks.

He uses Vic Firth drum sticks. His preferred &quot;perfect pair&quot; is the Peter Erskine Ride Stick and the SD4 Combo. He uses TG12 Sticks for practice, Vic Firth and Regal Tip Brushes, and Vic Firth T1 Mallets.

He uses Remo drum heads. His preferred setup:
*Snare: Coated Ambassador; Bottom: Clear Diplomat
*Toms: Clear Emperors; Bottoms: Clear Emperors
*Kick: Coated Powerstroke 3; Bottoms: Ebony Ambassador

Fishman&#x27;s Vacuum-A baby blue Electrolux vacuum cleaner (a.k.a. the vac or &#x27;lux) has been in the repertoire (played as an instrument by Fishman) since circa 1989. An earlier, 1967 model was donated to the Hard Rock Cafe 1/29/93. The currently in-use model is circa 1965.

On rare occasions, Fishman will play the theremin.

Perhaps the most recognizable part of his kit however, is the orange circle print muumuu he wears almost every performance and as such has become a de facto symbol of the band. He has been known to wear other clothes with the orange symbol as well.

==Other musical projects==
Fishman was a past member of the Vermont band &quot;Touchpants&quot; and no longer participates. He also used to play drums in the rock band Pork Tornado, and performed with the Jazz Mandolin Project for several years. He has been a member of two large musical collectives, The Everyone Orchestra and The Village. In 2007, he emerged from semi-retirement to perform a series of shows with the Yonder Mountain String Band, including a large portion of their set at the Rothbury Music Festival which happened the summer of 2008.
The Mimi Fishman Foundation is a nonprofit organization started by Jon to raise money for various charities, especially for charities that benefit the visually impaired. The charity was named for Jon&#x27;s mother, Mimi, who was diagnosed with glaucoma. Fishman was also announced as a member of fellow Phish member Trey Anastasio&#x27;s new side-project Ghosts of the Forest.

== Personal life ==
Fishman and his five children Ella Cynthia, 21, Jack Bradley, 19, Rose (Rosie) Lorelei, 15, Lily Millay, 13, Fredrick (Freddie) George, 9, live in Lincolnville, Maine. The family appeared on an episode of the Magnolia Network home restoration series &quot;Maine Cabin Masters&quot; in March 2018. He is a fan of the deathgrind band Cattle Decapitation and guested on their 2019 album, Death Atlas.

=== Radio ===
He has hosted a radio show on WBFY-LP, a community radio station in Belfast, Maine, since 2017. The show was originally called the Jonny B. Fishman Radio Show, but has since changed its name to The Errant Path. Fishman hosts the show weekly on Thursday evenings when Phish is not on tour.

=== Politics ===
Fishman was inspired by former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic to take action in his local elections. Fishman publicly endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in both the 2016 and 2020 democratic primaries. Fishman cites Sanders leadership in Burlington and dedication to upholding the arts as primary factors for his support. In 2017, he was voted a selectman of Lincolnville, Maine.

<text>The seventh USS &quot;Virginia&quot; (SP-746) was a motor boat in the United States Navy.

&quot;Virginia&quot; was built in 1906 at City Island in Bronx, New York. It was used by the Maine lobster warden, and was acquired by the Navy on 13 July 1917 under free lease from the state of Maine.

Though officially designated &quot;SP-746&quot; on the Naval Register, &quot;Virginia&quot; retained her name informally while in naval service. The Navy Directory for 1918 lists her as &quot;Virginia (SP-746)&quot; and indicates that she was assigned to the 1st Naval District. The vessel conducted patrols out of the section base located at Machias, Maine.

She served the Navy until she was returned to her owner on 28 January 1919 when her name was struck from the Navy List.

<text>The New Zealand Herald is a daily newspaper published in Auckland, New Zealand, owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment, and considered a newspaper of record for New Zealand. 

It has the largest newspaper circulation in New Zealand, peaking at over 200,000 copies in 2006, although circulation of the daily &quot;Herald&quot; had declined to 100,073 copies on average by September 2019. 

The &quot;Herald&quot;″s publications include a daily paper; the &quot;Weekend Herald&quot;, a weekly Saturday paper; and the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot;, which has 365,000 readers nationwide. The &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; is the most widely read Sunday paper in New Zealand.

The paper&#x27;s website, nzherald.co.nz, is viewed 2.2 million times a week and was named Voyager Media Awards&#x27; News Website of the Year in 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023. In 2023, the &quot;Weekend Herald&quot; was awarded Weekly Newspaper of the Year and the publication&#x27;s mobile application was the News App of the Year.

Its main circulation area is the Auckland region. It is also delivered to much of the North Island, including Northland, Waikato, King Country, Hawke&#x27;s Bay, Bay of Plenty, Manawatū, and Wellington.

== History ==

&quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; was founded by William Chisholm Wilson, and first published on 13 November 1863. Wilson had been a partner with John Williamson in the &quot;New Zealander&quot;, but left to start a rival daily newspaper as he saw a business opportunity with Auckland&#x27;s rapidly growing population. He had also split with Williamson because Wilson supported the war against the Māori (which the &quot;Herald&quot; termed &quot;the native rebellion&quot;) while Williamson opposed it. The &quot;Herald&quot; also promoted a more constructive relationship between the North and South Islands.

After the &quot;New Zealander&quot; closed in 1866, &quot;The Daily Southern Cross&quot; provided competition, particularly after Julius Vogel took a majority shareholding in 1868. First published as &quot;The Southern Cross&quot; (without &quot;daily&quot; in its title) in 1843 by William Brown, it became a daily publication in 1862, with its name modified to &quot;The Daily Southern Cross&quot;. Vogel sold out of the paper in 1873 and Alfred Horton bought it in 1876.

In 1876 the Wilson family and Horton joined in partnership and &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; absorbed &quot;The Daily Southern Cross&quot;.

In 1879 the United Press Association was formed so that the main daily papers could share news stories. The organisation became the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) in 1942. In 1892, the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot;, &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, and &quot;Press&quot; agreed to share the costs of a London correspondent and advertising salesman. The NZPA closed in 2011. 

The Wilson and Horton families were both represented in the company, known as Wilson &amp; Horton, until 1996 when Tony O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s Independent News &amp; Media Group of Dublin purchased the Horton family&#x27;s interest in the company. At some point, the company was purchased by APN NZ, a New Zealand subsidiary of APN News &amp; Media. In April 2007, APN NZ announced it was outsourcing the bulk of the &quot;Herald&quot;″s copy editing to an Australian-owned company, Pagemasters. &quot;The Herald&quot; is now owned by New Zealand Media and Entertainment, formed in 2014. That company was owned by Sydney-based APN News &amp; Media and the Radio Network, formerly owned by the Australian Radio Network.

In November 2012, two months after the launch of its new compact format, APN News and Media announced it would be restructuring its workforce, cutting eight senior roles from across the &quot;Herald&quot;″s range of titles.

=== Notable contributors ===
* Dita de Boni was a columnist for the newspaper, writing her first columns for the NZ Herald in 1995. From 2012 to 2015 she wrote a business and politics column until – after a series of articles increasingly critical of the Key government – the &quot;Herald&quot; discontinued her column for financial reasons. 
*Gordon Minhinnick was a staff cartoonist from the 1930s until his retirement in the 1980s. 
*Malcolm Evans was dismissed from his position as staff cartoonist in 2003 after the newspaper received complaints about his cartoons on the conflict between Israel and Palestine.
*Laurence Clark was the daily political cartoonist from 1987 to 1996 and continued to publish cartoons weekly in the &quot;Herald&quot; until 2000.
*William Berry, editor of the New Zealand Herald in 1875 and the Daily Southern Cross in 1877
* William Lane, Leader writer from 1900 then appointed editor in 1913.

=== Format ===
On 10 September 2012, the Herald moved to a compact format for weekday editions, after 150 years publishing in broadsheet format. The broadsheet format was retained for the &quot;Weekend Herald&quot;.

== Political stance and editorial opinion ==
&quot;The Herald&quot; is traditionally a centre-right newspaper and was given the nickname &quot;Granny Herald&quot; into the 1990s.

The &quot;Herald&quot; stance on the Middle East is supportive of Israel, as seen most clearly in its 2003 censorship and dismissal of cartoonist Malcolm Evans following his submission of cartoons critical of Israel.

In 2007, an editorial strongly disapproved of some legislation introduced by the Labour-led government, the Electoral Finance Act, to the point of overtly campaigning against the legislation.

== Brands ==
===&quot;The Weekend Herald&quot;===
In 1998 the &quot;Weekend Herald&quot; was set up as a separate title and the newspaper&#x27;s website was launched.

=== &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; ===
A compact-sized Sunday edition, the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot;, was first published on 3 October 2004 under the editorship of Suzanne Chetwin and then, for five years, by Shayne Currie. It won Newspaper of the Year for the calendar years 2007 and 2009 and is New Zealand&#x27;s most-read Sunday newspaper. In 2010, the &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot; started a campaign to reduce the legal blood alcohol limit for driving in New Zealand, called the &quot;Two Drinks Max&quot; campaign. The paper set up a campaign Facebook page, a Twitter account, and encouraged readers to sign up to the campaign on its own website. It is currently edited by Alanah Eriksen.

=== &quot;Herald Online&quot; website ===
The newspaper&#x27;s online news service, originally called &quot;Herald Online&quot;, was established in 1998. It was redesigned in late 2006, and again in 2012. The site was named best news website at the 2007 and 2008 Qantas Media Awards, won the &quot;best re-designed website&quot; category at the 2007 New Zealand NetGuide Awards, and was one of seven newspaper sites named an Official Honouree in the 2007 Webby Awards. A paywall was added for &quot;premium content&quot; starting on 29 April 2019.

== Editors ==
*&quot;Managing editor&quot;: Murray Kirkness
*&quot;Weekends editor&quot;: Stuart Dye

== Regular columnists ==
* Deborah Coddington, &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot;
* Matt McCarten, &quot;Herald on Sunday&quot;

== Issues and controversies ==

=== Mistaken identity incident ===
In July 2014, the &quot;Herald&quot; published a front-page story about the death of Guy Boyland, a New Zealand-born soldier killed in Gaza. The paper pulled a photograph of the television star Ryan Dunn, killed in 2011, from Boyland&#x27;s Facebook page, erroneously claiming it was of Boyland. When the &quot;Herald&quot;″s mistake was revealed, the paper issued apologies to Boyland&#x27;s family, his friends, and the paper&#x27;s readers. In a 2016 study by Philippa K. Smith and Helen Sissons, the authors said the mistake was caused by &quot;a series of lapses in the newsroom&quot;. They concluded that the incident caused damage to the &quot;Herald&quot; reputation, which it tried to repair by apologising. The &quot;Herald&quot; promised to reform its newsroom processes.

=== Ethics incident ===
In July 2015, the New Zealand Press Council ruled that &quot;Herald&quot; columnist Rachel Glucina had failed to properly represent herself as a journalist when seeking comment from Amanda Bailey on a complaint she had made about Prime Minister John Key repeatedly pulling her hair when he was a customer at the cafe in which she worked. The &quot;Herald&quot; published Bailey&#x27;s name, photo, and comments after she had retracted permission for Glucina to do so. The council said there was an &quot;element of subterfuge&quot; in Glucina&#x27;s actions and that there was not enough public interest to justify her behaviour. In its ruling the council said that &quot;The &quot;NZ Herald&quot; has fallen sadly short of those standards in this case.&quot; The &quot;Herald&quot;″s editor denied the accusations of subterfuge. Glucina subsequently resigned from the newspaper.

=== COVID-19 disinformation ===
In 2020, the &quot;New Zealand Herald&quot; ran inserts provided by the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, the official mouthpiece of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pushing Chinese state disinformation about COVID-19. The newspaper subsequently deleted the story from its website.

=== 2024 Hobson&#x27;s Pledge advertisement ===
On 7 August 2024, lobby group Hobson&#x27;s Pledge published a full-page advertisement in &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; calling for the &quot;restoration of the foreshore and seabed to public ownership.&quot; The advertisement drew criticism from Te Pāti Māori, who responded they would be cease engaging with &quot;The Herald&quot; until the newspaper and its owners NZME issued a public apology and amended their publishing standards.

<text>USS &quot;Virginia&quot; (SP-1965) was a two-masted, auxiliary schooner in the United States Navy.

&quot;Virginia&quot;, built in 1902 by F. W. McCullough at Norfolk, Virginia, was acquired by the US Navy on Christmas Eve of 1917 under free lease from W. M. Holland of Norfolk.

In Navy records, she does not appear as an active unit until July 1918 when she was listed in the Navy Directory as a unit of the 5th Naval District section patrol force — probably operating in and around Norfolk. Initially, she retained the name &quot;Virginia&quot; semi-officially and was so listed in several editions of the 1918 Navy Directory. However, after December 1918, she was carried on all Navy records as USS &quot;SP-1965&quot;, but frequently with a parenthetical &quot;Virginia&quot; added after the official designation. The schooner served the Navy until 3 January 1919 when her name was struck from the Navy List, and she was returned to her owner.

<doc id="911267" wikidata="Q2688704" url="?curid=911267" title="Rufus Wheeler Peckham (1809–1873)">
<text>Rufus Wheeler Peckham (December 20, 1809 – November 22, 1873) was an American jurist and politician who served in the United States House of Representatives for New York&#x27;s 14th congressional district from 1853 to 1855.

Aside from his time in Congress, Peckham served on the New York Supreme Court and New York Court of Appeals. Two of his sons were nominated to the Supreme Court of the United States, the younger of whom, Rufus W. Peckham, was successfully confirmed by the Senate.

Peckham ultimately died in the November 1873 sinking of the SS Ville du Havre.

==Early life==
Peckham was born in Rensselaerville, New York, in Albany County on December 20, 1809, to Peleg Benjamin (1762–1828) and Desire (Watson) Peckham (1767–1852). Raised in Cooperstown, New York, he attended Hartwick Seminary.

Peckham graduated from Union College at Schenectady in 1827, where he was an early member of the Kappa Alpha Society. After reading law under Greene C. Bronson and Samuel Beardsley, he was admitted to the bar in 1830. Alongside his brother, George W. Peckham, and brother-in-law, Joseph Colt, he opened a successful private law firm.

== Political career ==
Appointed by Governor William L. Marcy, Peckham served as the district attorney of Albany County from 1838 to 1841. In 1845, Peckham ran for Attorney General of New York, but he lost the New York State Legislature&#x27;s vote to John Van Buren.

Peckham was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives from New York&#x27;s 14th District, serving in the 33rd United States Congress from March 4, 1853, until March 3, 1855. During his term, he was the chairman of the House Committee on Revolutionary Claims. Additionally, Peckham was a vocal opponent of the 1854 Kansas–Nebraska Act for violating the terms of the 1820 Missouri Compromise.

== Judicial career ==
Peckham returned to legal practice in a partnership with Judge Lyman Tremain until he was elected to serve as a justice of the New York Supreme Court for the Third Judicial District from 1861 until 1869. He then sat as an associate judge on the New York Court of Appeals from May 17, 1870, until his death.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===

Peckham had three sons by his first wife, Isabella Adoline Lacey, who died on April 4, 1848, at the age of 35. Rufus Wheeler Peckham (1838–1909) followed in his namesake father&#x27;s footsteps as a lawyer and in three of the positions that his father had held in New York: as the Albany district attorney (1869–1872), as a New York Supreme Court judge (1883–1886), and as a judge on the New York Court of Appeals (1886–1895). He remarried to Mary Elizabeth Foote (1830–1873).

The younger Peckham never went into Congress, however, but served on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1895 until his death. Peckham&#x27;s oldest son, Wheeler Hazard Peckham (1833–1905), was also a lawyer who practiced in New York City. Wheeler was also nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court but the Senate failed to confirm him. Peckham had another son named Joseph Henry, who died at the age of 17 on April 2, 1852.

=== Death ===

Peckham and his second wife, Mary, were among 226 passengers and crew of the steamer SS &quot;Ville du Havre&quot; lost at sea, while the couple were en route to southern France to improve his failing health. The ship sank after colliding with the Scottish vessel &quot;Loch Earn&quot; in the north Atlantic Ocean on November 22, 1873; Peckham&#x27;s last words were reported to be, &quot;Wife, we have to die, let us die bravely.&quot; His remains were never recovered, and a cenotaph was erected at Albany Rural Cemetery in Menands, New York.

Upon Peckham&#x27;s death, the New York State Bar Association published a book compiling remembrances held at the New York Court of Appeals, state bar association, New York City courts, Rensselaer County bar association, Greene County bar association, and various courthouses across New York State.

<text>A rubefacient is a substance for topical application that produces redness of the skin, e.g. by causing dilation of the capillaries and an increase in blood circulation. It has sometimes been used to relieve acute or chronic pain, but there is limited evidence as to its efficacy, and as of 2014 the best evidence does not support using gels and creams containing rubefacients for this purpose.

==Examples==
Common medicinal rubefacients include:
*Salicylates, such as methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen)
*Nicotinate esters
*Capsaicin, derived from chili pepper, &quot;Capsicum minimum&quot;, &quot;incites irritation without rubefaction&quot;
*Isopropanol (rubbing alcohol)
*Menthol
*Minoxidil
*Thurfyl nicotinate (Trafuril)
Common herbal rubefacients include:
*Cloves (&quot;Syzygium aromaticum&quot;)
*Garlic (&quot;Allium sativum&quot;)
*Ginger (&quot;Zingiber officinale&quot;)
*Horseradish &quot;(Cochlearia armoracia&quot;)
*Mustard (&quot;Brassica alba&quot; or &quot;Brassica nigra&quot;)

<text>Henry Martyn Robert (May 2, 1837 – May 11, 1923) was an American Army General, engineer, and author. In 1876, Robert published the first edition of his reference manual of parliamentary procedure, &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;, which remains today 150 years later, as the most common parliamentary authority on democratic parliamentary procedure in the United States.

==Life and career==
Robert was born in Robertville, South Carolina, and raised in Ohio, where his father moved the family because of his strong opposition to slavery. Robert&#x27;s father, Reverend Joseph Thomas Robert, later became the first president of historically black Morehouse College, where there is a dormitory on the campus named after him. 

Robert was nominated to West Point and graduated fourth in his class in 1857, becoming a military engineer. Under command of Silas Casey during the Pig War, he built fortifications on San Juan Island. In the American Civil War, he was assigned to the Corps of Engineers and worked on the defenses of Washington, D.C., Philadelphia, and several New England ports.

Robert served as Engineer of the Army&#x27;s Division of the Pacific from 1867 to 1871. He then spent two years improving rivers in Oregon and Washington and six years developing the harbors of Green Bay and other northern Wisconsin and Michigan ports. He subsequently improved the harbors of Oswego, New York, Philadelphia, and Long Island Sound and constructed locks and dams on the Cumberland and Tennessee rivers. From 1890 to 1891 he served as a member of the Board of Commissioners for the District of Columbia. As Southwest Division Engineer from 1897 to 1901, Robert studied how to deepen the Southwest Pass of the Mississippi River.

Robert was president of the Board of Engineers from 1895 to 1901. He received a tombstone promotion to brigadier general and was appointed Chief of Engineers on April 30, 1901, just before he retired from the Army on May 2, 1901. Following retirement, he chaired the board of engineers that designed the Galveston, Texas seawall following the Galveston hurricane of 1900.

Robert died in Hornell, New York, and is buried at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Robert is most famous for his &quot;Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies&quot; (later known as &quot;Robert&#x27;s Rules of Order&quot;)—a collection of rules regarding parliamentary procedure, published in 1876. He wrote the manual in response to his poor performance leading a meeting at the First Baptist Church in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The meeting erupted into open conflict because of concerns about local defense, and he resolved to learn about parliamentary procedure before attending another meeting. The rules are loosely based on procedures used in the United States House of Representatives, but the rule book was not intended for use in national and state legislatures. At the time, Robert was a resident of Haworth, New Jersey.

<text>Jhabua is a town and a municipality in Jhabua district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the administrative headquarters of Jhabua District.

Recently the district has got international recognition because of its endemic hen species &quot;kadaknath&quot;. It has been granted the GI tag.

==History==
The ancestor of the family was Rao Bar Singh a.k.a. the Birji, fifth son of Jodha of Mandore of Marwar. His descendant, Kunwar Kesho Das or Kishan Das, founded Jhabua in 1584.

Raja Kesho Das was first Raja of Jhabua 1584/1607. He was granted the title of Raja by the Emperor of Delhi, as a reward for a successful campaign in Bengal, and for punishing the Bhil chiefs of Jhabua who had murdered an Imperial Viceroy of Gujarat. 

Khushal Singh was the ruler of Jhabua in 1698, he gave much of his lands to his brothers and sons and was too weak to rule his state effectively. This allowed the Marathas to actively invade Jhabua on a regular basis. Raja Shiv Singh was an infant and therefore the states administration during this time was managed by the raja&#x27;s mother and the nobles. The Marathas under Holkar took advantage of this situation to take control of Jhabua. The threat from Jai Singh of Sailana forced the nobles of Jhabua to rely on Maratha protection, Holkar thus sent his officers to manage the states affairs. Jhabua later came under British protection in 1817 A.D. and was under the Bhopawar Agency of the Central India Agency and in 1927 it became part of the Malwa Agency.There were 20 families of rank in the state who paid £1500 to the Holkars and £2500 to their own chief. 
In 1875 the state had a population of 55,000 and a revenue of £22,500. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, Jhabua&#x27;s last ruler signed the accession to the Indian Union on 15 June 1948, and Jhabua became part of the newly created Madhya Bharat state, which in 1956 was merged into Madhya Pradesh. 

===Jhabua Princely State===

Jhabua was the capital of a princely state of the British Raj&#x27;s Central India, in the Bhopawar agency. Its area, with the dependency of Rutanmal, was approx . The Rajas of Jhabua belonged to the Rathor dynasty.

===Post-Independence===
After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, its rulers acceded to India, and Jhabua became a part of the newly created Madhya Bharat state, which in 1956 was merged into Madhya Pradesh.

Bhabhara which was once part of the Jhabua district, is the place where Chandrasekhar Azad, the freedom fighter spent his early life when his father Pandit Sitaram Tiwari was serving in the erstwhile estate of Alirajpur. But, when Alirajpur district (which was once the part of Jhabua district) got separated from Jhabua, Bhabhra became the part of Alirajpur district.

<doc id="911275" wikidata="Q7992219" url="?curid=911275" title="Wheeler Hazard Peckham">
<text>Wheeler Hazard Peckham (January 1, 1833 – September 27, 1905) was an American lawyer from New York and an unsuccessful nominee to the Supreme Court of the United States.

==Early life==
Peckham was born in Albany, New York, on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1833 to Rufus Wheeler Peckham and Isabella Adoline; his mother died when he was 15. He was educated at The Albany Academy and at his father&#x27;s alma mater, Union College, where he joined Kappa Alpha Society before leaving early due to poor health. Peckham studied law at his father&#x27;s partnership with Lyman Tremain and was also among the first students to attend Albany Law School. Peckham then left New York to practice in the northwestern United States, where he became what the &quot;New York Times&quot; called &quot;one of the best known attorneys in that part of the country.&quot;

==Legal practice==
Poor health caused him to return to New York City in 1867, where he established the firm of Miller &amp; Peckham and gained fame first as a constitutional lawyer, and later as a special prosecutor for the State. He was involved in the unsuccessful prosecution of Mayor A. Oakey Hall in 1872, and also prosecuted former Tammany Hall leader &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed with Tremain in 1873. Peckham again represented the State against Tweed in 1876, when he won a $6 million verdict in a civil fraud suit.

Championed by his brother and businessman Daniel Manning, Peckham was appointed by Governor Grover Cleveland as New York County District Attorney on November 30, 1883, to fill the vacancy caused by the death of John McKeon, despite pressure from a barrage of applicants. However, Peckham tendered his resignation a mere eight days after taking the oath of office, citing ill health. He then returned to private practice in the Wall Street offices of Miller, Peckham &amp; Dixon, where he focused primarily on civil practice. Peckham also served as the President of the New York City Bar Association from 1892 to 1894.

==Nomination to U.S. Supreme Court==
In 1894, Cleveland, who was then in his nonconsecutive second term as President, nominated Peckham to replace Samuel Blatchford on the U.S. Supreme Court. However, the nomination was caught in the middle of a political tug-of-war between Cleveland and New York Senator David B. Hill, and Wheeler became the second nominee of Cleveland that Hill managed to block, by a vote of 32-41 on February 16, 1894. Senator Edward Douglass White was instead confirmed to the Court. By the time another seat on the Court was vacant after the death of Howell E. Jackson in 1895, Hill had been weakened politically, and Cleveland turned to Wheeler&#x27;s brother, Rufus, who was confirmed within six days.

==Social role==
Peckham was one of the most famed New York City lawyers of his time, and an active participant in New York City politics and society. He presided over social events as a member and president of the City Club, and he advocated for reform of &quot;municipal degradation:&quot;

The issue is simply one of men. You cannot remedy matters by law nor by system, you have got to remedy it by the simple expedient of turning out the maladministrators and putting in their places men who are honest and capable. We must organize a power that will overcome present conditions and put in office men who are capable and aggressively so. Vice, that has awakened such an outburst of public opinion, is but one of the things that must go.

==Family==
His father, Rufus Wheeler Peckham, was also a lawyer, and a New York Court of Appeals judge and congressman. His brother, also named Rufus Wheeler Peckham, was also a New York lawyer, state court judge, and U.S. Supreme Court Justice.

==Legacy==
Peckham is buried in the Peckham family plot at Albany Rural Cemetery, along with his wife, Annie Aertsen Keasbey (1826, Salem, New Jersey – October 30, 1916), whom he married in 1855. His father, who was lost at sea, also has a cenotaph there.

<text>CSV &quot;Virginia II&quot; was a Confederate Navy steam-powered ironclad ram laid down in 1862 at the William Graves&#x27; shipyard in Richmond, Virginia. Acting Constructor William A. Graves, CSN, was the superintendent in charge of her construction. In order to conserve scarce iron plating, he ordered the ship&#x27;s armored casemate shortened from the specifications given in John L. Porter&#x27;s original building plans; in addition, the ship&#x27;s iron-plating, while six inches thick on the casemate&#x27;s forward face, was reduced to five inches on her port, starboard, and aft faces. Due to the shortening of her casemate, the number of her cannon were reduced to a single 11&quot; smoothbore, a single 8&quot; rifle, and two 6.4&quot; rifles.

The &quot;Virginia II&quot; was named after the more famous Confederate ironclad, , also called the because of the ship&#x27;s origins as a Union frigate. The original &quot;Virginia&quot;&#x27;s success at the Battle of Hampton Roads caused &quot;gunboat associations&quot; to emerge around the South, mainly driven by women; their efforts helped with the construction of the &quot;Virginia II&quot;.

==Construction==
Money to help with the construction of this ironclad was largely contributed by the Richmond chapter of the &quot;Ladies Aid and Defense Society&quot; (called the &quot;National Defense Association&quot;), which adopted the ironclad in early April 1862 for the defense of Richmond. The chairman was Maria Gaitskell Clopton. It is estimated that the society contributed more than $30,000 towards &quot;Virginia II&quot;″s construction.

By November 1862, John Mercer Brooke was able to report that she was &quot;pretty well advanced, frames up, clamps in, etc...She will be a strong and fine vessel.&quot;

However, after this promising start, significant delays plagued the new ironclad. It was not until more than a year after she was laid down that &quot;Virginia II&quot; was finally launched without incident on June 29, 1863. &quot;She glided into the water &#x27;like a thing of life&#x27; amid the prolonged cheers of the spectators.&quot; However, she suffered from further fitting-out delays and was not fully commissioned until May 18, 1864, almost a year later; she was made the flagship of the James River Squadron (replacing in this role).

==Career==

&quot;Virginia II&quot; went into action on June 21, 1864, as the flagship of Commodore John K. Mitchell, during the engagement between the James River Squadron and Federal ships in Trent&#x27;s Reach. But the ironclad developed mechanical problems when an errant chain from the nearby &quot;Richmond&quot; became entangled in her propeller, and she could no longer participate in the battle.

On August 13, the &quot;Virginia II&quot; participated in the attack on the Union forces at Dutch Gap. The &quot;Canonicus&quot;-class monitor, , and her gunboats joined in the battle, but could not effectively train their guns, though they did manage to fire two shots that hit &quot;Virginia II&quot;. On August 17, she participated in the capture of Signal Hill, shelling the Union defenses from 3 p.m. until 9 p.m. before finally ceasing fire.

From September 29 through October 1, the &quot;Virginia II&quot; and the rest of the squadron attacked New Market Heights and Fort Harrison in conjunction with the Confederate Army; it was the largest operation north of the James River since Cold Harbor and would remain so until the end of the war. Once again, though, the &quot;Virginia II&quot; suffered difficulty, delaying her entrance into the battle. She had just received a new cannon, and in the rush to leave the dock, the supply ship &quot;Gallego&quot; became entangled in her anchor chain, causing the &quot;Gallego&quot; to sink.

In their routine patrol of the James River, the squadron was surprised to discover, on the morning of October 22, that the Union Army had finished fortifying Cox Hill. To cover the retreat of the Confederate wooden vessels, &quot;Virginia II&quot; approached the battery, followed by two ironclads, and effected a retreat upstream to Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. During this, the &quot;Virginia II&quot;″s smokestack was riddled by shells. Though caught by surprise, this small action helped determine the effectiveness of the ironclads&#x27; armored casemates against close rifled cannon fire, and in the case of the &quot;Virginia II&quot;, the results were favorable: her casemate withstood 7 direct hits by 100-pound conical iron &quot;bolts,&quot; which barely dented her plating.

On December 7 &quot;Virginia II&quot;, along with the &quot;Fredericksburg&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot;, steamed down to Fort Brady near Trent&#x27;s Reach and near sunset exchanged cannon fire with the fort until darkness fell.

===Battle of Trent&#x27;s Reach===
Her final action took place on January 23–24, 1865 when the James River Squadron, including ironclads &quot;Richmond&quot;, and &quot;Fredericksburg&quot;, with five smaller vessels, made a second unsuccessful attempt to circumvent obstructions in Trent&#x27;s Reach. A reliable report indicated there was a passage through, as a result of a freshet of melting ice. To avoid the risk of collision, the gunboats and tenders were lashed to the starboard sides of the ironclads; &quot;Virginia II&quot; accreted to her bulk the gunboats and , with the torpedo boat in tow. After passing the Union batteries at Fort Brady sometime after 8 p.m., the &quot;Virginia II&quot; accidentally beached &quot;Torpedo&quot; by cutting too close to the shore. The captain of &quot;Nansemond&quot; untied his ship from &quot;Virginia II&quot; in an attempt to free &quot;Torpedo&quot;. The fleet continued on and reached the obstructions at Trent&#x27;s Reach.

Again &quot;Virginia II&quot; ran into trouble, this time running aground; the smaller ships tried to free her for three hours. Only two ships made it through, the rest were either running aground or helping the ones that had already run aground. Dawn came with most of the squadron in full view of the Union fortifications at Battery Parsons, and they had to suffer fire until the water rose high enough to allow them to finally retreat. In late morning, just as the water was high enough to re-float &quot;Virginia II&quot;, the Union fleet arrived and added its firepower. This time it was much more deadly: the double-turreted monitor was able to pierce her armor with its shot. &quot;Virginia II&quot; and the rest of the squadron retreated upstream until they were safely under the cover of Confederate Battery Dantzler. They attempted to run past again that night, but Union soldiers had erected a huge light illuminating the obstructions; this, combined with several other factors, forced the attempt to be abandoned.

While leaving, &quot;Hampton&quot; managed to entangle her screw propeller in &quot;Virginia II&quot;″s anchor chain. They suffered more heavy fire on their return upriver from Fort Brady, and &quot;Virginia II&quot; ran aground again before making it to the safety of Chaffin&#x27;s Bluff. The ship had at least six killed and more than a half dozen wounded from the action; she also suffered heavy battle damage which required extensive repairs. Her smokestack was destroyed, the engines broke down, and her iron armor and underlying wooden framework were damaged.

==Destruction of &quot;Virginia II&quot;==

Her repairs had just been completed when &quot;Virginia II&quot; and the other Confederate warships of the James River Squadron were ordered destroyed by squadron commander Admiral Raphael Semmes to prevent their capture by rapidly advancing Union forces during the evacuation and fall of Richmond on April 3, 1865.

Following the war&#x27;s end, most of the wreck of &quot;Virginia II&quot; was raised for salvage.

<text>Dinesh Mongia (born 17 April 1977) is a former Indian cricketer and politician. Mongia has appeared in limited over internationals for India. With India, Mongia was a member of the Indian team that was one of the joint-winners of the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, which the title was also shared with Sri Lanka, and was a member of the team that were runners-up in the 2003 Cricket World Cup.

==Domestic career==
Mongia in domestic cricket career scored 8,100 runs at an average of just under 50 and his highest score being an unbeaten 308.

In 2004, he signed for Lancashire as an overseas player when Stuart Law was injured. In 2005 he was signed by Leicestershire on a full-time contract.

Mongia plays for the Lashings World XI team. He also played for Chandigarh Lions in the now defunct Indian Cricket League.

==First Indian T20 cricketer==
Mongia is the first Indian cricketer to play a T20 match, playing for Lancashire against Leicestershire in the 2004 Twenty20 Cup. He played for Lancashire in the 2004 County Championship.

==International career==
He made his ODI debut in 2001 against Australia without much success. However, in his fifth match, he scored his first half-century (71 off 75 balls) against England. In 2002, almost a year after his debut, he picked up his first and only century (an unbeaten 159 off just 147 balls against Zimbabwe) to win the Man of the Match award. He was also named the Man of the Series in that tour. Suspicions remained, however, that kinks in his technique could be exposed on more challenging tracks abroad, and indifferent displays in England resulted in him being relegated to a bit-part role in the tours that followed.

He forced his way back into the 2003 Cricket World Cup squad, where India lost the final against Australia. But after a string of below-par performances, he was dropped from the Indian side in April 2005.

He was again selected in the Indian team in 2006 for the Tri-Series in Sri Lanka. However, the tournament was affected by the pull out of the third team, South Africa, due to a bomb explosion in Colombo, and by incessant rain. Instead, Mongia got an opportunity in the September 2006 tri-series against Australia and West Indies in Malaysia, where he made an unbeaten 68 in the final group game against Australia, although India lost the game and were unable to reach the final.

==Politics==
Mongia joined Bharatiya Janata Party in December 2021, ahead of the 2022 Punjab Legislative Assembly election.

<text>Robert Young Pelton is a Canadian-American author, journalist, and documentary film director. Pelton&#x27;s work usually consists of conflict reporting and interviews with military and political figures in war zones.

Pelton has been present at several struggles, such as the Battle of Qala-i-Jangi in Afghanistan, the Battle of Grozny (1999–2000) in Chechnya, the rebel siege to control Monrovia in Liberia, and the siege on Villa Somalia in Mogadishu. He spent time with the Taliban, the Northern Alliance (pre-9/11), the CIA during the hunt for Osama bin Laden and with both insurgents and Blackwater security contractors during the war in Iraq. Robert has been with ground forces on ~40 occasions.

Pelton&#x27;s survival and political guide &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot;, provides information for people who work and travel in high-risk zones, and is a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller. He was also the host of the Discovery Travel Channel series entitled Robert Young Pelton&#x27;s &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot; from 1998 to 2003. Currently residing in Los Angeles, Pelton writes books and produces documentaries on war-related subjects.

==Early life==
Pelton was born July 25, 1955, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. At age 10, he began attending Grade 6 at Saint John&#x27;s Cathedral Boys&#x27; School in Selkirk, Manitoba. The school is acclaimed for a wilderness curriculum featuring one thousand mile canoe trips, snowshoe marathons, raising animals, and advanced study of Latin, history, and religion. Later, an offshoot/affiliate school (St John&#x27;s Ontario) became known for the deaths of a number of students in what became known as the Lake Timiskaming tragedy.

==Career==
At age 17, Pelton began in the Toronto mailroom of the ad agency BBDO before being promoted to copywriter. He then worked for various multimedia companies that did product launches, which led to him working for Apple Inc., where he worked on the Lisa and later the Macintosh launch. His first break as a writer came in 1991, when he reported on the Camel Trophy, an annual competition by Land Rover across difficult terrain in Africa. Pelton competed for the U.S. team and published his account in &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot;.

In 1993, Pelton purchased the name of the &quot;Fielding&#x27;s Travel Guide&quot; from William Morrow and Company and published a couple of traditional guides that were focused toward younger, independent travelers.

Pelton licensed data-based travel content to companies such as Microsoft and IBM, selling his businesses to turn full-time to conflict coverage in the mid-1990s. He began with a two-book deal from Random House (&quot;The Adventurist&quot; and &quot;Come Back Alive&quot;), a television series from Discovery (&quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot;), and a major web event with ABC News called &quot;Dangerous Places&quot;. Pelton created the concept of &quot;solo&quot; or &quot;solo journalist&quot;. defined as a person who provides text, video, photos, and audio from remote regions without support. He founded the website Dangerous Magazine at which he published his own and other writers&#x27; articles about adventure travel.

In January 2003, Pelton was on assignment for &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot; in the Darién Gap when he and two 22-year-old travelers were abducted by the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia. The trio was held in the jungle for 10 days before being released.

Pelton contributed to &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot; as both a contributing editor and a columnist from January 2001 to 2007. In December 2007, he released an article on Blackwater Worldwide. He was involved in negotiations with the President of Equatorial Guinea regarding the early release of coup plotters Simon Mann and Nick du Toit, who had worked for Executive Outcomes in the mid-1990s. The story was documented in the May 2008 &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; article &quot;How to Stage a Coup&quot;.

In 2006, Pelton teamed up with Eason Jordan, former head of international news for CNN, and several others to launch Iraq Slogger, a clearinghouse of news and information coming out of Iraq during the Iraq War. The site was intended to aggregate articles by both foreign correspondents and Iraqi journalists, as well as nonprofessionals. According to Pelton, the site had insufficient income and ceased operations in 2009.

In December 2008, Pelton travelled the Horn of Africa with both pirates and an anti-piracy crew researching the industry. Pelton resumed immersion-style coverage in January of 2009 by going inside the U.S. Army&#x27;s controversial Human Terrain System. Around that time, he also spent a year as an advisor to NATO&#x27;s Afghanistan commander.
In 2008, Pelton and Jordan founded AfPax Insider, a newsgathering and research service in Afghanistan and Pakistan modeled on Iraq Slogger. The venture provided free content on its website and was partially funded by the U.S. military. Controversy arose when a Defense Department official who was operating an unauthorized spy ring allegedly diverted funds that were intended to pay the open-source project. According to Jordan, the venture never had a &quot;full-fledged launch&quot; into offering a premium subscription service to private clients, and due to insufficient funding, remained a free website until it became inactive in August 2009.

In 2011, Pelton created Somalia Report. With assistance from around 140 locals and western editors, Pelton provided ground coverage of al-Shabaab, pirates, governments, contractors, intelligence groups, and regular people on a 24/7 information website.

In June of 2015, Pelton started publishing the Migrant Report to track the movement of refugees and migrants. The venture was sponsored by a non-profit organization in Malta. and provided in-depth coverage from Libya, Myanmar, and Bangladesh.

===Books===

;&quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot;

Pelton&#x27;s first major writing project was his self-published guide to conflict, &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot;. The New York Times described it as &quot;One of the oddest and most fascinating travel books to appear in a long time&quot;. CNN called the book a &quot;compendium of the world&#x27;s frightful places.&quot;

The first edition was written in 1993; it currently is in its fifth edition from Harper Resource.

;&quot;The Adventurist&quot;
&quot;The Adventurist&quot; is Pelton&#x27;s autobiography that covers his childhood and an assortment of later travel experiences around the world up until 1999.

;&quot;Come Back Alive&quot;

A real-world survival guide, written in a humorous style.

;&quot;Hunter, Hammer and Heaven, Three Worlds Gone Mad&quot;
A 2002 book on Pelton&#x27;s journey into three wars in three tiny countries Chechnya, Sierra Leone, and Bougainville, which were examples of a jihad against the Russians, a mercenary war for resources, and an eco war to preserve a native lifestyle.

;&quot;Licensed to Kill, Hired Guns in the War on Terror&quot;
Pelton has written about contemporary private military contractors, as well as his experiences with US Special Forces in the opening weeks in the War on Terror. Of &quot;Licensed to Kill&quot;, one reviewer summarized: &quot;He is a journalistic story-quilt of characters engaged as private security contractors and mercenaries in a variety of settings from Afghanistan to Equatorial Guinea... The pages turn... because Pelton&#x27;s stories are intrinsically interesting.&quot; The book was reviewed by author and filmmaker Sebastian Junger (&quot;An incredible look into the murky and virtually impenetrable world of private military contractors . . . Pelton may well have seen the future.&quot;) and terrorism expert Peter Bergen (&quot;A rollicking read that takes the reader inside the murky world of military contractors—from the craggy passes of the Afghan-Pakistan border to the extreme danger of Baghdad&#x27;s airport road, to the diamond fields of Africa. &quot;Licensed to Kill&quot; is not only a great travelogue, [but] it also has some important things to say about the brave new world of privatized violence&quot;).

;&quot;Raven&quot;
&quot;Raven&quot;, Pelton&#x27;s only novel, is a fictionalized account of his early life interwoven with experiences in the Pacific Northwest.

;&quot;Civilian Warriors&quot;
In July 2013, Pelton stated in an interview with Spy Talk&#x27;s Jeff Stein that Erik Prince had come to him to fix a ghostwritten autobiography that Prince had been unsuccessfully trying to publish since February 2008 with Regnery and again in 2010 with Simon &amp; Schuster. According to the interview, Pelton rewrote Prince&#x27;s book, hired a fact-checker to remove numerous plagiarized passages from the previous writers, and dissuaded Prince from self-publishing, getting Prince a US$1 million advance from Adrian Zackheim at Penguin Publishing.

===Magazines===
In late 2001, Pelton began writing feature stories for &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot; and then continued writing a column until 2009 entitled, &quot;Pelton&#x27;s World&quot; for &quot;National Geographic Adventure&quot;. His feature stories for &quot;National Geographic&quot; covered his journeys into Afghanistan, Iraq, and Colombia.

Pelton has written for and been profiled in numerous magazines including &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Friend&quot; by Tim Cahill in &quot;Men&#x27;s Journal&quot; and Outside magazine covering topics such as Blackwater, the U.S. military Human Terrain System, South African mercenaries, and American military volunteers in rebel-held Burma. He also has written about his time with Somali pirates and maritime anti-piracy security teams for &quot;Bloomberg Businessweek&quot; and security contractors in Iraq for &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot;.

In May 2014, &quot;Vice&quot; magazine released a multimedia event which featured Pelton traveling with photographer Tim Freccia and with a former Lost Boy, Machot Lap Thiep, to South Sudan at the height of the fighting. It was the first time in Vice&#x27;s 21-year history that a single author and single photographer created an entire issue on one topic. The 130-page, 50,000-word article was also released online In conjunction, a three-parter 40-minute documentary film entitled &quot;Saving South Sudan&quot; accompanied the article. 

===Graphic novels===
Artist Billy Tucci illustrated and wrote a 64-page illustrated novel entitled &quot;Roll Hard&quot; based on one of Pelton&#x27;s chapters in &quot;Licensed to Kill&quot;. The book documents the true story of a team of Blackwater misfits who must travel up and down the most dangerous road in Iraq. Pelton rode every mission with the team for a month, which routinely came under attack. After Pelton left the team, they were hit by an IED with one fatality and a number wounded. &quot;Wired&quot; magazine described it as &quot;At a time when comics are still dominated by busty babes, zombies, and superheroes wearing tights, Pelton and Tucci&#x27;s gritty, journalistic portrayal of America&#x27;s fighters-for-hire is a profound departure.&quot;

&quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; described the book: &quot;While that&#x27;s a prime setup for endless scenes of action-movie carnage, the narrative instead focuses on the men as professionals and what makes them put their lives on the line for a daily payout around $600. It&#x27;s that spotlight on the humanity of the contractors that make this an engaging read, and artist Tucci (Sgt. Rock: The Lost Battalion) turns in understated, realistic artwork that is among the finest of his career. While the role of contractors in the Iraq conflict is controversial, this gives it a human face.&quot;

=== Rebel, Jihadi, and Insurgent Groups ===
In order to gain access, Pelton has spent an unusual amount of time living with, traveling with, and documenting some of the world&#x27;s well-known insurgent groups. Some of the groups Pelton has lived with and interviewed include: the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan, the LURD in Liberia, MILF in the Southern Philippines, Bougainville Revolutionary Army, the Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army in Southern Sudan, the Taliban in Afghanistan, the FARC, and AUC in Colombia, the Chechen rebels and the Karen National Liberation Army, the Karen National Union and the Free Burma Rangers in Burma His access and interviews initially were to create &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot;. His unusual and death-defying efforts to get this access soon then morphed into his TV series and then into a series of other books and film projects.

Pelton has described and shown how he gets access and world exclusive interviews in his TV series &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot; for the Discovery Channel, investigating and reporting from the inside the drug business in Colombia and Peru, the &quot;mafia&quot; in Georgia and Turkey, and bounty hunting in Mexico.

===Television series===
Pelton executive produced and hosted seven one-hour specials for Discovery from 1998 until 2003. Pelton travels to meet rebel leaders in Afghanistan, Chechnya, the Philippines, Colombia, West Africa, and even militias in the United States. His list of interviews includes Afghan leaders like Massoud and General Dostum, African child soldiers and rebels in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Sudan, Colombian rebels included the FARC&#x27;s Mono Jojoy, Alphonso Cano, and Marulando, along with many other wanted leaders. One of his most well-known interviews is his exclusive interview of &quot;American Taliban&quot; John Walker Lindh. His interview was featured on CNN and became the first time an American al Qaeda member had been interviewed after 9/11.

===Documentaries===

After the publication of his book &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Dangerous Places&quot; by Fielding Worldwide and then Harper Collins Pelton was a popular talk show guest. His solo efforts to &quot;Dangerous Places&quot; were featured by ABC News in a multi-part series on ABCNews.com.

<doc id="911310" wikidata="Q948447" url="?curid=911310" title="Leon Kass">
<text>Leon Richard Kass (born February 12, 1939) is an American physician, scientist, educator, and public intellectual. Kass is best known as a proponent of liberal arts education via the &quot;Great Books,&quot; as a critic of human cloning, life extension, euthanasia and embryo research, and for his tenure as chairman of the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics from 2001 to 2005. Although Kass is often referred to as a bioethicist, he eschews the term and refers to himself as &quot;an old-fashioned humanist. A humanist is concerned broadly with all aspects of human life, not just the ethical.&quot;

Kass is the Addie Clark Harding Professor Emeritus in the College and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago, Senior Fellow Emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, and the Dean of the Faculty at Shalem College in Jerusalem. His books include &quot;Toward A More Natural Science: Biology and Human Affairs&quot;; &quot;The Hungry Soul: Eating and the Perfecting of our Nature&quot;; &quot;Life, Liberty, and the Defense of Dignity: The Challenge for Bioethics&quot;; &quot;The Beginning of Wisdom: Reading Genesis&quot;; and &quot;What So Proudly We Hail: The American Soul in Story, Speech, and Song&quot;.

&quot;For his students and readers,&quot; Yuval Levin summarizes, &quot;Leon Kass has laid out a path of inquiry showing that those questions that bedevil us most today have been with us for countless generations, and have to do not with the latest modern excess, but with man’s unchanging nature, wants, needs, and potential. It is a path...that opens with a question: How does man thrive?&quot;

==Early life and education==
Kass was born in Chicago to Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. He described his family as &quot;Yiddish speaking, secular, and socialist.&quot; Although his upbringing was not religious, it was moralist: &quot;Morality, not Judaism, was the religion of our home, morality colored progressively pink with socialism, less on grounds of Marxist theory, more out of zeal for social justice and human dignity.&quot; He would not begin to explore his religious heritage until later in his career.

Kass enrolled in the University of Chicago at age 15, graduating from the college with a degree in biology in 1958. The college was well known for its extensive core curriculum, and Kass studied the &quot;great books&quot; then prescribed by Chicago&#x27;s core. &quot;I became a devotee of liberal education . . . with a special fondness for the Greeks.&quot; He graduated from the University of Chicago&#x27;s medical school in 1962 and, following an internship in medicine at the Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, completed a PhD in biochemistry at Harvard University in 1967, working in the laboratory of Nobel laureate Konrad Bloch. Around this time Kass began to develop an interest in morality in medicine and in bio medical ethics, instigated partly as a result of reading Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences.&quot;

In 1961, Kass married the former Amy Apfel, a fellow graduate of the College of the University of Chicago. As instructors in the college in later years, they would frequently teach seminars together. Their scholarly collaborations include several articles on marriage and courtship and a reader on the subject. In 2011, they published a joint project, &quot;What So Proudly We Hail&quot;, that uses literature to examine the American soul. Amy Kass died of complications from ovarian cancer and leukemia on August 19, 2015.

Leon and Amy Kass went to Holmes County, Mississippi, during the summer of 1965 to do civil rights work. Working with the Medical Community for Human Rights and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), the Kasses &quot;lived with a farmer couple in the Mount Olive community, in a house with no telephone, hot water, or indoor toilet. They visited many families in the community, participated in their activities, and helped with voter registration and other efforts to encourage the people to organize themselves in defense of their rights.&quot; Later that fall, Kass wrote a letter to his family and friends detailing his and his wife&#x27;s experiences and appealing to them to donate to the Civil Rights Movement.

The character of the rural, poor, and uneducated African Americans with whom they lived and worked contrasted with his colleagues at Harvard and other elite universities. It was this experience, he later said, that
caused me to shed my enlightenment faith and ultimately begin a journey in which Jewish thought would ultimately come to play a more prominent part. Why, I wondered then, was there more honor, decency, and dignity among the impoverished and ignorant but church-going black farmers with whom we had lived than among my privileged and educated fellow graduate students at Harvard, whose progressive opinions I shared but whose self-absorption and self-indulgence put me off. If poverty and superstition were the cause of bad character, how to explain this?
==First forays into bioethics==

After completing his doctorate, Kass conducted molecular biology research for the National Institutes of Health, authoring several scientific papers while serving in the U.S. Public Health Service. His early interest in bioethics was stimulated by Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; and C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Abolition of Man&quot;, both of which he read at the suggestion of Harvey Flaumenhaft. In these books, Kass saw examples of &quot;how the scientific project to master nature could, if we are not careful, lead to our dehumanization, via eugenics, drug-induced contentment, and other transformations of human nature, possibilities already foreseeable in the new biology. . . . Will man remain a creature made in the image of God, aspiring to align himself with the divine, or will he become an artifact created by man in the image of God-knows-what, fulfilling the aspirations only of human will? . . . I soon shifted my career from doing science to thinking about its human meaning.&quot;

In 1967, Kass read an article by Joshua Lederberg in the &quot; Washington Post&quot; suggesting that humans could one day be cloned, permitting the perpetuation of the genotypes of geniuses. In a letter to the editor, Kass made a moral case against cloning and suggested that &quot;the programmed reproduction of man will, in fact, dehumanize him.&quot; Thus began a second career of writing on bioethics, including essays on organ transplantation, genetic screening, in vitro fertilization, cloning, the conquest of aging, assisted suicide, medical ethics, and biotechnology. Kass was also involved in founding the Hastings Center. In 1970, he left the laboratory at NIH to become the executive director of the Committee on Life Sciences and Social Policy at the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, which produced the first public document that tried to assess the ethical and social consequences of the coming advances in biotechnology.

== Teaching experience ==

As he moved from biology to bioethics, Kass also moved from full-time research into teaching, first at St. John&#x27;s College from 1972 to 1976, Georgetown University from 1974 to 1976, and at Chicago from 1976 onward. At St. John&#x27;s, Kass taught in the Great Books program as well as in-depth studies of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;De Anima&quot; and &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; and Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. At the University of Chicago, Kass taught courses across the humanities and sciences, including both undergraduate and graduate seminars in the &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; and &quot;Meno&quot;, Lucretius, human passions, science and society, Rousseau&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Origin of Inequality&quot;, Genesis, Darwinism, Descartes&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, classical geometry, Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, marriage and courtship, Exodus, and biotechnology.

Along with his wife and other colleagues, Kass cofounded in 1977 the &quot;Human Being and Citizen&quot; common core course at Chicago, today the most popular humanities core course at Chicago, devoted to exploring the conflicts between conceptions of what constitutes a good human being/individual versus the demands that society or the State tries to impose upon us. In 1983, he, Allan Bloom, and James M. Redfield founded the &quot;Fundamentals: Issues and Texts&quot; program. Kass taught in and chaired this program for eighteen years. He won the University of Chicago&#x27;s Llewellyn John and Harriet Manchester Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching in 1983 and the Amoco Foundation Award for Distinguished Contributions to Undergraduate Teaching in 1993.

==Views on rape==

In his 1992 article &quot;Regarding Daughters and Sisters&quot;, an examination of the Biblical story of Dinah, Kass writes that &quot;rape is a capital offense, a crime worse even than murder. For the rapist, says the book of Deuteronomy, &#x27;death by stoning.&#x27; It has never seemed to me too cruel or excessive a punishment.&quot; However, he criticizes the modern conception of rape &quot;as a violation of the will, not a violation of womanliness.&quot; Womanliness, for Kass, requires modesty rather than power. He concludes:Many lonely women, more than can safely admit it, secretly hope to meet a gentleman; but the vast majority steadfastly refuse to be ladies—indeed, no longer know what it means. Small wonder, then, so much sexual harassment and even rape. When power becomes the name of the game, the stronger will get his way.
Under such circumstances, one cannot exactly blame women for wanting to learn how to defend themselves against sexual attack. But, addressing the symptom not the cause, the remedies of karate and “take back the night”—and, still more, the shallow beliefs about sexual liberation that support these practices—can only complete the destruction of healthy relations between man and woman. For, truth to tell, the night never did and never can belong to women, except for the infamous women-of-the-night. Only a restoration of sexual self-restraint and sexual self-respect—for both men and women—can reverse our rapid slide toward Schechem.

==President&#x27;s philosopher==

As the stem cell controversy brewed in the late 1990s and into 2001, President George W. Bush had to decide whether to allow federal funding for research on stem cells derived from embryos. Many scientists were advocating the removal of limits on embryonic stem cell research, but critics expressed concern about what they characterized as the wanton destruction of human life. In an August 2001 speech, Bush announced that he would support funding research on stem cell lines already created—&quot;where the life and death decision has already been made&quot;—but not on lines created by the further destruction of embryos. And because &quot;[e]mbryonic stem cell research is at the leading edge of a series of moral hazards,&quot; Bush said, he would create the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics, to be led by Kass and with a mandate to &quot;monitor stem cell research, to recommend appropriate guidelines and regulations, and to consider all of the medical and ethical ramifications of biomedical innovation.&quot; As the council was appointed and prepared to begin meeting in early 2002, Kass received a great deal of media attention, especially due to his reputation for pessimism and concern about the moral implications of scientific progress with respect to health and life issues. Calling him &quot;the president&#x27;s philosopher,&quot; &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; noted that &quot;he tends to dwell on the dark side of modern medicine. . . . Kass has tried to raise the public&#x27;s consciousness of emerging technology&#x27;s risks to values that humanity holds dear.&quot; The council from its inception was charged by Bush to consider these larger questions, well beyond the domain of stem cell research. The first specific task of the council, according to the executive order creating it, was &quot;to undertake fundamental inquiry into the human and moral significance of developments in biomedical and behavioral science and technology.&quot;

The composition of the council was also subject to controversy. Kass was accused of &quot;stacking the deck&quot; with philosophers, scientists, and public intellectuals likely to oppose &quot;unfettered medical research in the area of stem cells, therapeutic cloning, and reproductive cloning. Given that fact, researchers had better worry a lot about what the Council is likely to recommend to the president.&quot; Critics also charged that Kass eliminated those who disagreed with him, such as Elizabeth Blackburn and William May, and replacing them with opponents of cloning. Kass replied to these criticisms by saying that the council was more intellectually diverse than prior bioethics commissions precisely because it included opponents of abortion. (Previous commissions had &quot;excluded representatives of the right to life movement.&quot;) Also, the council members Robert George, Francis Fukuyama and James Q. Wilson debated with stark disagreement their opposing points of view on the biological status of the human embryo and came to no agreed conclusions. Since Bush had deliberately created the council to debate and clarify the issues without necessarily reaching consensus, Kass said that he welcomed disagreement within the council: &quot;This council is easily the most intellectually and ethically diverse of the bioethics commissions to date. We have worked with mutual respect while not papering over our differences. No one who has attended any of our meetings or read the transcripts can believe that we do anything but serious and careful work, without regard to ideology, partisan politics or religious beliefs.&quot;

The council has been renewed by executive order every two years since 2001, and the subjects it considered ranged beyond the stem cell battles during which it was established. Kass sought throughout to develop a &quot;richer&quot; bioethics, attentive to larger human and philosophical questions at the root of bioethical dilemmas, and he lamented that the council was pigeonholed: &quot;The Council came into existence identified as the &#x27;stem cell council,&#x27; and people on all sides of the embryo research debate seem to care more about the Council&#x27;s views on this subject than about anything else. Not by our choice—and certainly not by mine—the Council was born smack in the middle of &#x27;embryoville,&#x27; and it has never been able to leave this highly political field.&quot; Despite the public&#x27;s narrow conception of its work, during Kass&#x27;s chairmanship, the Council produced five book-length reports, a white paper, and a humanistic reader on ten topics generally neglected in the bioethics literature.

Kass described the council&#x27;s work as &quot;public bioethics,&quot; rejecting previous approaches that favored government by self-appointed &quot;experts&quot;—scientific or bioethical—and presenting the issues in terms accessible to the broader public and its political representatives. He sought a &quot;richer&quot; inquiry that debates &quot;ends as well as means,&quot; and the council&#x27;s reports addressed larger human questions, &quot;not merely administrative or regulatory ones.&quot; He said that it presented all sides of ethical issues in order to create a more substantive moral discourse. &quot;A proper bioethics must lead public reflection on the ways in which new biotechnologies may affect those things that matter most regarding how human lives are lived,&quot; Kass wrote. &quot;This means beginning by reflecting upon the highest human goods and understanding the latest technological advances in this light.&quot; Eschewing much of the language and theoretical framework of academic bioethics, Kass drew on literary, philosophical, and theological sources to inform the council&#x27;s discussion. At the council&#x27;s first meeting, he led a discussion of &quot;The Birth-Mark,&quot; a short story by Nathaniel Hawthorne.

Kass stepped down as chairman of the Council in October 2005 and remained a member of the council until 2007. He returned to positions at the American Enterprise Institute and the University of Chicago.

==Views on bioethics==

===Biotechnology and medical enhancement===
While welcoming biotechnology for its therapeutic promise—to cure disease, relieve suffering, and to restore health and wholeness—Kass worries about its uses for enhancement (boosting capability beyond what is given naturally and even altering human nature). While biotechnology offers great promise for health care, it has applications for &quot;many other ends, good ones and bad.&quot; Biotechnology can be employed to produce &quot;better children, superior performance, ageless bodies, and happy souls.&quot; Kass argues that biotechnology may eventually be used as a substitute for virtue, hard work, study, or love in order to &quot;fulfill our deepest human desires,&quot; but in the end lowering the reach of those desires only to those objects that can be realized technologically. His worries about biotechnology stem from what he calls &quot;the technological disposition,&quot; which transforms the meaning and character of human life by believing that &quot;all aspects of life can be rationally mastered through technique.&quot;

===Stem cell research===
Kass has been a consistent critic of embryo research, including embryonic stem cell research, because of its &quot;exploitation&quot; and &quot;destruction&quot; of nascent human life. Although he claims to be agnostic about the moral standing of an early human embryo, he worries about treating human life, at whatever stage, merely as a natural resource. &quot;There is something deeply repugnant and fundamentally transgressive about such a utilitarian treatment of prospective human life,&quot; he writes. But because he recognized the potential of such cells for medical research, he led the President&#x27;s Council on Bioethics to examine alternative avenues of obtaining pluripotent stem cells: &quot;Pluripotent cells might be obtainable from already dead (not just unwanted or doomed but actually dead) embryos, some of whose individual cells might nonetheless still be viable; from living embryos by nondestructive biopsy; from bioengineered, embryo-like artifacts; and from reprogrammed body cells, taken from children or adults, that are induced to return to the undifferentiated state of pluripotency. . . . We should be hopeful that a technological solution to our moral dilemma might soon be found and that this divisive piece of our recent political history will soon come to an end.&quot;

In 2007, in two separate studies, research teams led by James Thomson and Shinya Yamanaka created induced pluripotent stem cells from adult cells, meaning that the destruction of embryos for stem cells might no longer be necessary. In 2009, the reprogramming technique was further improved, as skin cells were returned to pluripotency by the transfer of a few exogeneous genes and without the use of foreign viruses as vectors. Robert P. George praised Kass as the driving intellectual force against embryo-killing and in favor of finding alternative methods of obtaining pluripotent stem cells: &quot;All along, it was Dr. Kass who said that reprogramming methods would, if pursued vigorously, enable us to realize the full benefits of stem cell science while respecting human dignity.&quot;

===Human cloning===
Kass supports a universal ban on the cloning of humans on the grounds that cloning is an affront to morality and human dignity. In a 1997 article in &quot;The New Republic&quot; entitled &quot;The Wisdom of Repugnance,&quot; Kass suggests that we should respect the revulsion most people feel about cloning human beings, just as we respect their supposed revulsion at incest and cannibalism. &quot;In crucial cases,&quot; he writes, &quot;repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason&#x27;s power fully to articulate it.&quot; Kass writes that modern ethical discourse, which emphasizes autonomy, equity, and utility, fails to provide the moral guidance that the modern world demands:
Repugnance, here as elsewhere, revolts against the excesses of human willfulness, warning us not to transgress what is unspeakably profound. Indeed, in this age in which everything is held to be permissible so long as it is freely done, in which our given human nature no longer commands respect, in which our bodies are regarded as mere instruments of our autonomous rational wills, repugnance may be the only voice left that speaks up to defend the central core of our humanity. Shallow are the souls that have forgotten how to shudder.
A society that tolerates cloning, Kass writes, &quot;has forgotten how to shudder [and] always rationalizes away the abominable.
A society that allows cloning has, whether it knows it or not, tacitly said yes to converting procreation into manufacture and to treating our children as pure projects of our will.&quot;

In response to Kass, other ethicists have argued that reactions of repugnance or disgust are not a valid basis for banning cloning because such feelings are subjective, dictated by cultural norms, and change over time. Fritz Allhoff of the American Medical Association Division of Bioethics contends that &quot;racial integration once elicited the same sentiments of repugnance that Kass claims that cloning elicits now; surely public sentiment should not be taken as a moral guide.&quot; Martha Nussbaum has advanced a broader argument against using feelings of disgust as a basis for policymaking, writing that &quot;laws and social rules&quot; should be based on &quot;substantive harm, rather than on the symbolic relationship an object bears to our anxieties.&quot;

In addition to opposing cloning on the grounds of repugnance, Kass has also argued that cloning constitutes an &quot;unethical experiment upon the resulting child-to-be&quot;; creates confusions of identity and individuality; &quot;turns begetting into making&quot;; and, by giving parents control over a child&#x27;s genetic make-up, exacerbates the &quot;dangerous&quot; idea of parental control over children&#x27;s lives and prospects. &quot;One must never forget that these are human beings upon whom our eugenic or merely playful fantasies are to be enacted,&quot; he writes.

===Concern for the natural===
Although he appreciates that human beings are always modifying what is naturally given, Kass worries about the lack of standards for human life in a world in which human nature is treated as utterly malleable and in which the boundaries of human life are all eroded. Kass places &quot;special value on the natural human cycle of birth, procreation and death&quot; and views death as a &quot;necessary and desirable end&quot; and the human and human aspirations that are derived from it. He views human mortality as a blessing in disguise, and he has opposed deliberate efforts to increase maximum human life expectancy in pursuit of biological immortality. Kass was an early critic of the widespread use of reproductive technologies like in vitro fertilization, partly because he was concerned that their use obscures truths about the essence of human life and society that are embedded in the natural reproductive process. (He later endorsed the marital use of in vitro after Louise Brown was born in 1978.)

Kass sees human cloning as a natural progression from the decoupling of sex and procreation, begun with in vitro fertilization: &quot;Cloning turns out to be the perfect embodiment of the ruling opinions of our new age. Thanks to the sexual revolution, we are able to deny in practice, and increasingly in thought, the inherent procreative teleology of sexuality itself. But, if sex has no intrinsic connection to generating babies, babies need have no necessary connection to sex. . . . For that new dispensation, the clone is the ideal emblem: the ultimate &#x27;single-parent child.&#x27;&quot; As in his other writings, Kass emphasizes the connection of reproduction to marriage and family life: &quot;No child conceived with the aid of assisted reproductive technologies should be denied the lineage and biological ties to two parents that all children born &#x27;naturally&#x27; have. No child should have to say, &#x27;An embryo was my father.&#x27;&quot;

In his first book, Kass proposed that modern science could become a &quot;more natural science&quot; that would be both Aristotelian and Darwinian in its comprehensive understanding of nature. Such a science could move &quot;from nature to ethics.&quot; &quot;A more natural science might be useful for ethics,&quot; because it would show how ethics is &quot;part of nature,&quot; and so &quot;the natural, rightly understood, might even provide some guidance for how we are to live&quot; (xi, 346-48).

But then, in 2002, with the publication of his essay &quot;The Permanent Limitations of Biology,&quot; he repudiated his &quot;more natural science&quot; of biological ethics. He spoke of &quot;the insufficiency of nature for ethics&quot; and &quot;the difficulty in looking to biology--even a more natural science more true to life--for very much help in answering the questions about how we are to live&quot; (296-97).

== Philosophical studies ==
For much of his career, Kass&#x27;s scholarship moved away from the practical issues of bioethics to issues of human nature and human good, and nearly all of his teaching at Chicago has been about these topics. Yet despite his stated interest in &quot;the natural,&quot; Kass does not hold to any traditional teaching of &quot;natural law,&quot; and he does not derive any moral rules from nature. Rather, he sees human nature as offering, at most, intimations and &quot;pointings&quot; toward human flourishing and human fulfillment, but pointings in need of both cultural encouragement and restraint if humans are to become the upright animal advertised in his special posture.

== Biblical studies ==
In addition to his studies in natural philosophy and philosophical anthropology, Kass has in recent years been teaching and writing about the Hebrew Bible, especially the book of Genesis. Kass&#x27;s interest in the Bible began with weekly invitational readings of Genesis that he and his wife, Amy, had organized for students while teaching at the University of Chicago. In his 2009 Jefferson Lecture, Kass said that he found in the Bible &quot;an account of human life that can more than hold its own with the anthropological and ethical teachings offered by the great poets and philosophers,&quot; with &quot;teachings of righteousness, humaneness, and human dignity . . . that were undreamt of in my prior philosophizing.&quot; Kass reads the text philosophically, not theologically, in the belief that this text, thoughtfully read, has much to teach everyone—believers and non-believers alike—about the human condition and how it may be improved. His full lengthy commentary on Genesis, based on his teaching of the text over twenty years, is addressed primarily to the &quot;children of skeptics&quot; (such as himself). He concludes:Long dwelling with the book of Genesis, and ever marveling at its beauty, its profundity, and, above all, its power to illuminate and lift the soul, this exhilarated reader of Genesis stands before it on his intellectual knees, filled with awe and gratitude for a text that makes such insights possible. I dare to hope that, with my book as a companion, other wisdom-seeking readers may enjoy a similar experience.
In his book on Exodus, what Kass says about the Divine Presence in the Tabernacle suggests an atheistic religiosity: religious feelings of transcendence, of being in touch with God, but without believing any religious doctrines about the real existence of God. God &quot;exists&quot; only in the minds and actions of people who feel awe and reverence in their experience of &quot;the ecstatic passions of Dionysus&quot; elicited by religious ceremony (430). If Israel were to stop worshipping God, then God would be dead. He would &quot;go into eclipse,&quot; and He would &quot;cease to be&quot; (500-503, 598, 603, 689).

== Honors and awards ==

Kass was named the 2009 Jefferson Lecturer by the National Endowment for the Humanities. The Jefferson Lecture is &quot;the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities.&quot; Kass&#x27;s lecture, delivered at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., on May 21, 2009. was entitled &quot;Looking for an Honest Man: Reflections of an Unlicensed Humanist&quot;. In his lecture, he expressed the view that science has become separated from its humanistic origins and the humanities have lost their connection to metaphysical and theological concerns.

In addition to his teaching awards from the University of Chicago, Kass also received the Harvard Centennial Medal and the Intercollegiate Studies Institute&#x27;s Gerhard Niemeyer Award in 2003 and the inaugural Bradley Prize from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in 2004. He has been given honorary degrees by the University of Dallas (1997), the Spertus Institute of Jewish Studies (2001), Carthage College (2002), and Yeshiva University (2003). Kass is a fellow of the Hastings Center.

==Family==

<text>Pygmy geese are a group of very small &quot;perching ducks&quot; in the genus Nettapus which breed in the Old World tropics. They are the smallest of all wildfowl. As the &quot;perching ducks&quot; are a paraphyletic group, they need to be placed elsewhere. The initially assumed relationship with the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae has been questioned, and it appears they form a lineage in an ancient Gondwanan radiation of waterfowl, within which they are of unclear affinities. An undescribed fossil species from the late Hemphillian (5.0–4.1 mya) of Jalisco, central Mexico, has also been identified from the distal end of a tarsometatarsus. It is only record of the genus in the New World.

The genus &quot;Nettapus&quot; was erected by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt in 1836. The name is from Ancient Greek &quot;nētta&quot; meaning &quot;duck&quot; and &quot;pous&quot; meaning &quot;foot&quot;. It was thought that the type species, the African pygmy goose (&quot;Nettapus auritus&quot;), possessed the feet and body of a duck and the neck of a goose.

There are three extant species in the genus:
Pygmy geese have short bills, rounded heads and short legs. They nest in tree holes.

<text>Richard S. Lyon (born February 25, 1958) is an American puppeteer, actor, and puppet designer and builder. He has worked for The Jim Henson Company as one of the operators of Big Bird. He appeared on Broadway originating the roles of Trekkie Monster, Nicky, the blue Bad Idea Bear, and other characters in the Tony Award-winning musical &quot;Avenue Q&quot;, a musical for which he designed and created all of the puppets. In the fall of 2005 he reprised his roles in the production of the show in Las Vegas for eight months before returning to the Broadway cast. Rick was a puppeteer on Sesame Street for 15 seasons, from 1987 to 2002. He also worked with Nickelodeon on the Stick Stickly project and on the &quot;Me + My Friends&quot; pilot. He was a lead puppeteer for the first season of Comedy Central&#x27;s television program &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;. Rick has also appeared numerous times on &quot;The Late Show with Stephen Colbert&quot;, for which he also provided the puppets he performed. Rick puppeteered a xenomorph chest burster in an &quot;Alien&quot; parody sketch with guest star Sigourney Weaver, and Yoda, Kermit the Frog, and Big Bird in satirical sketches, a pair of singing pants, and the Number Two. He also performed the Kukla, Fran, and Ollie-inspired puppets for the black and white throwback clip on the &quot;15th Episode Anniversary Show&quot; of &quot;At Home with Amy Sedaris&quot;.

Lyon&#x27;s company, The Lyon Puppets, maintains a large permanent workshop outside New York City in New Jersey. In addition to building all of the Broadway and Las Vegas &quot;Avenue Q&quot; puppets, the company has built puppets for the original West End production of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; in London, the US national tour, and international productions in Brazil, Mexico, Australia, Switzerland, Germany, France, and China. Rick frequently coaches actors in puppetry for productions of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; for which he provides puppets. He also directed a production of &quot;Avenue Q&quot; at Smithtown PAC.

He studied theater at Penn State University and puppetry at the Institute of Professional Puppetry Arts in Connecticut and the Institut International de la Marionnette in France.

<doc id="911335" wikidata="Q229682" url="?curid=911335" title="Zumbi">
<text>Zumbi ( – November 20, 1695), also known as Zumbi dos Palmares (), was a Brazilian quilombola leader and one of the pioneers of resistance to enslavement of Africans by the Portuguese in colonial Brazil. He was also the last of the kings of the Quilombo dos Palmares, a settlement of Afro-Brazilian people who liberated themselves from enslavement in the present-day state of Alagoas, Brazil. He is revered in Afro-Brazilian culture as a symbol of African freedom.

==Quilombos==
&quot;Quilombos&quot; were communities in Brazil founded by individuals of African descent who escaped slavery (these escaped slaves are commonly referred to as maroons). Members of quilombos often returned to plantations or towns to encourage their former fellow Africans to flee and join the quilombos. If necessary, they brought others by force and sabotaged plantations. Anyone who came to quilombos on their own were considered free, but those who were captured and brought by force were considered slaves and continued to be so in the new settlements. They could be considered free if they were to bring another captive to the settlement. Women were also targets of capture, including black, white, Indian and mulatas (women of mixed African and European ancestry), who were forcibly relocated to Palmares. Some women, however, fled voluntarily to Palmares to escape abusive spouses and/or masters. Since small in numbers, men were also recruited to join Palmares and even Portuguese soldiers fleeing forced recruitment were sought out.

Palmares was established around 1605 by 40 enslaved central Africans who fled to the heavily forested hills that parallel the northern coast of Brazil. Portuguese authorities called this area Palmares, due to its many palm trees, and were locked in deadly clashes with it for much of the 17th century.

Quilombo dos Palmares was a self-sustaining kingdom of Maroons escaped from the Portuguese settlements in Brazil, &quot;a region perhaps the size of Portugal in the hinterland of Pernambuco&quot;. At its height, Palmares had a population of more than 30,000. Palmares developed into a confederation of 11 towns, spanning rugged mountainous terrain in frontier zones across the present day states of Alagoas and Pernambuco. Palmares was an autonomous state based on African political and religious customs that supported itself though means of agriculture, fishing, hunting, gathering, trading, and raiding nearby Brazilian plantations and settlements.

==Origins==
Zumbi&#x27;s mother Sabina was a sister of Ganga Zumba, who is said to have been the son of princess Aqualtune, daughter of an unknown King of Kongo. It is unknown if Zumbi&#x27;s mother was also daughter of the princess, but this still makes him related to the Kongo nobility. Zumbi and his relatives are of Central African descent. They were brought to the Americas after the Battle of Mbwila. 

The Portuguese won the battle eventually, killing 5,000 men, and captured the king, his two sons, his two nephews, four governors, various court officials, 95 title holders and 400 other nobles who were put on ships and sold as slaves in the Americas. It is very probable that Ganga and Sabina were among these nobles. The whereabouts of the rest of the individuals captured after the Battle of Mbwila is unknown. Some are believed to have been sent to Spanish America, but Ganga Zumba, his brother Zona and Sabina were made slaves at the plantation of Santa Rita in the Captaincy of Pernambuco in what is now northeast Brazil. From there, they escaped to Palmares.

==Early life==
Zumbi was born free in Palmares in 1655, believed to be descended from the Congo. He was captured by the Portuguese and given to a missionary, Father António Melo, when he was approximately six years old. Father António Melo baptized Zumbi and gave him the name of Francisco. Zumbi was taught the sacraments, learned Portuguese and Latin and built a Kongo kingdom in Palmares. 

Despite attempts to subjugate him, Zumbi escaped in 1670 and, at the age of 15, returned to his birthplace. Zumbi became known for his physical prowess and cunning in battle and he was a respected military strategist by the time he was in his early twenties.

==King of the Quilombo dos Palmares==
By 1678, the governor of the captaincy of Pernambuco, Pedro Almeida, weary of the longstanding conflict with Palmares, approached its king Ganga Zumba with an olive branch. Almeida offered freedom for all runaway slaves if Palmares would submit to Portuguese authority, a proposal which Ganga Zumba favored. But Zumbi – who became the commander-in-chief of the Kingdom&#x27;s forces in 1675 – was distrustful of the Portuguese. Further, he refused to accept freedom for the people of Palmares while other Africans remained enslaved. He rejected Almeida&#x27;s overture and challenged Ganga Zumba&#x27;s kingship. In 1678, Zumbi killed his uncle Ganga Zumba. Zumbi sought to implement a far more aggressive stance against the Portuguese 

Vowing to continue the resistance to Portuguese oppression, Zumbi became the new king of Palmares. Zumbi&#x27;s determination and heroic efforts to fight for Palmares&#x27; independence increased his prestige. Predictably, when Zumbi gained authority, tensions with the Portuguese quickly escalated. Between 1680 and 1686, the Portuguese mounted six expeditions against Palmares at significant cost to the royal treasury, but they all failed to defeat Palmares.

In 1694, fifteen years after Zumbi assumed kingship of Palmares, the Portuguese colonists under the military commanders Domingos Jorge Velho and Bernardo Vieira de Melo launched an assault on the Palmares. They made use of artillery as well as a fierce force of Brazilian Indian fighters, which took 42 days to defeat the kingdom. 

On February 6, 1694, after 67 years of conflict with the cafuzos, or Maroons, of Palmares, the Portuguese succeeded in destroying Cerca do Macaco, the kingdom&#x27;s central settlement. Some resistance continued, but on November 20, 1695 Zumbi was killed and decapitated, his head displayed on a pike to dispel any legends of his immortality.

Although it was eventually crushed, the success of Palmares through most of the 17th century greatly challenged colonial authority and would stand as a beacon of slave resistance in the times to come.

==Part of Afro-Brazilian folklore==
His contemporary slaves believed him to be a demigod. It was believed throughout the country by slaves that his strength and courage were due to the fact that he was possessed by Orixas, African spirits, and was therefore half-man, half-god. Others thought that he was the son of Ogum.

==Importance today==

November 20 is celebrated, chiefly in Brazil, as a day of Afro-Brazilian consciousness. The day has special meaning for those Brazilians of African descent who honour Zumbi as a hero, freedom fighter, and symbol of freedom. Zumbi has become a hero of the 20th-century Afro-Brazilian political movement, as well as a national hero in Brazil. Today, Zumbi is considered a hero of great magnitude amongst Afro-Brazilians who celebrate his courage, leadership qualities, and heroic resistance to Portuguese colonial rule.

<text>Otakar Ševčík (22 March 185218 January 1934) was a Czech violinist and influential teacher. He was known as a soloist and an ensemble player, including his occasional performances with Eugène Ysaÿe.

==Biography==

Ševčík was born in Horažďovice, Bohemia, Austrian Empire. His father was the local village schoolmaster. Although he received his first music lessons from his father, he studied under Antonín Bennewitz at the Prague Conservatory (1866–1870) during which period a disease caused him to have his left eye enucleated. He was also taught by Hans Sitt. He began his career in 1870 as concertmaster of the Mozarteum concerts in Salzburg, where he also taught.

After 1873, he was concertmaster at the Prague Interim (Provisional) Theatre and the Komische Opera at the Ring Theatre in Vienna. From 1875-92 he was professor of violin at the music school of the Russian Music Society in Kiev, at the same time appearing frequently as soloist.

In 1892 he became head of the violin department at the Prague Conservatory, where he remained until 1906. He then taught privately in Písek. In 1909, he became director of the Violin Department at the Vienna Music Academy, until 1918, when at the end of World War I his nationality forced him to leave his position. He returned to the Prague Conservatory, where he stayed until 1921. After that he travelled in the United States and Great Britain as a well known teacher. He died in Písek, in the modern-day Czech Republic.

Ševčík taught violin at the Imperial Royal Academy of Music in Vienna, from 1909. He visited the United States four times between 1922 and 1932 to teach.

Ševčík was famous as a violin teacher in Salzburg, Vienna, Prague, Kharkiv, Kiev, London, Boston, Chicago, and New York City.

His violin studies and violin methods were published in several books and are still important as major teaching tools. These studies include &quot;The Little Ševčík&quot;, an elementary violin tutor, which teaches the semitone system in 149 exercises, the &quot;School of Violin Technics&quot; (&quot;Schule der Violintechnik&quot;, four parts, 1880), First Position, vol. II, 2nd to 7th Positions, and Vol. III, Shifting, and Preparatory Exercises in Double-Stopping, Opus 9, and the &quot;Schule der Bogentechnik&quot; (six parts, 1893).

<text>Joshua Micah Jesajan-Dorja Marshall (born February 15, 1969) is an American journalist and blogger who founded &quot;Talking Points Memo.&quot; A liberal, he currently presides over a network of progressive-oriented sites that operate under the &quot;TPM Media&quot; banner and average 400,000-page views every weekday and 750,000 unique visitors every month.

Marshall and his work have been profiled by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, &quot;National Public Radio&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;, &quot;Bill Moyers Journal&quot;, and &quot;GQ&quot;. Hendrik Hertzberg, a senior editor at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, compared Marshall to the influential founders of &quot;Time&quot; magazine, saying: &quot;Marshall is in the line of the great light-bulb-over-the-head editors. He&#x27;s like Briton Hadden or Henry Luce. He&#x27;s created something new.&quot;

==Early life and career==
Marshall was born in St. Louis, Missouri. Marshall&#x27;s father was a professor of marine biology. His mother died when he was young.

He is a graduate of the Webb Schools of California and Princeton University and earned a PhD in American history from Brown University. In the mid-1990s, Marshall designed websites for law firms and published an online news site about Internet law, which included interviews with prominent scholars such as Lawrence Lessig.

Marshall began writing freelance articles about Internet free speech for &quot;The American Prospect&quot; in 1997 and was soon hired as an associate editor. He worked for the &quot;Prospect&quot; for three years and in 1999 moved to D.C. to become their Washington editor.
He often clashed with the top editors at the &quot;Prospect&quot;, over both ideology and the direction of the website.

==Talking Points Memo==

===History===

Inspired by political bloggers such as Mickey Kaus and Andrew Sullivan, Marshall started &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; during the 2000 Florida election recount. &quot;I really liked what seemed to me to be the freedom of expression of this genre of writing,&quot; Marshall told the &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot;. &quot;And, obviously, given the issues that I had with the &quot;Prospect&quot;, that appealed to me a lot.&quot;

He left his job at the &quot;Prospect&quot; early in 2001 and continued to blog while writing for &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, &quot;Salon.com&quot;, and the &quot;New York Post&quot;. In 2002, Marshall used &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; to report on Trent Lott&#x27;s controversial comments praising Strom Thurmond&#x27;s 1948 presidential run as a segregationist. According to Harvard Kennedy School, Marshall was instrumental in fueling the ensuing scandal that eventually led to Trent Lott&#x27;s resignation as Senate Minority Leader.

As a result of the Lott story, traffic to &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; spiked from 8,000 to 20,000 page views a day. In the fall of 2003, as people focused on the failure to find WMD&#x27;s in Iraq, there was a new surge of traffic to the site; &quot;I remember there being peak days of 60,000-page views, which was really incredible.&quot; Marshall started selling ads on his site and by the end of 2004 was earning $10,000 a month, making him one of a handful of what &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; dubbed &quot;elite bloggers&quot; who earned enough money to make blogging a full-time occupation. 

During the 2008 US election campaign, many independent news sites and political blogs saw a wave of &quot;explosive growth&quot;. &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; experienced the largest surge in traffic, growing from 32,000 unique visitors in September 2007 to 458,000 unique visitors in September 2008, a 1,321% year-to-year increase in the size of its audience.

===Launching TPM Media===

In 2005, Marshall launched &quot;TPMCafe&quot;. This site features a collection of blogs about a wide range of domestic and foreign policy issues written by academics, journalists and former public officials among others.

Marshall expanded his operation again in 2006, launching &quot;TPMmuckraker&quot;. The site focuses on political corruption, and was originally staffed by Paul Kiel and Justin Rood. Rood has since moved on to &quot;ABC&quot; and its blog &quot;The Blotter&quot;. Kiel has recently been joined by two new staff reporter-bloggers, Laura McGann and Spencer Ackerman. &quot;TPMmuckraker&quot; has attempted to organize its readers to plow through and read document dumps by governmental entities engaging in cover-ups.

&quot;TPM Media&quot; operates out of an office in Manhattan and currently employs seven reporters, including two in Washington.

===U.S. attorney controversy===
In 2007, Marshall was instrumental in exposing another national controversy — the politically motivated dismissal of U.S. attorneys by the Bush administration. Marshall won The Polk Award for Legal Reporting for his coverage of the story, which &quot;led the news media&quot; and &quot;connected the dots and found a pattern of federal prosecutors being forced from office for failing to do the Bush Administration&#x27;s bidding.&quot; &quot;Columbia Journalism Review&quot; also credited Marshall&#x27;s news organization for being &quot;almost single-handedly responsible for bringing the story of the fired U.S. Attorneys to a boil.&quot; The ensuing scandal resulted in the resignations of several high-level government officials; the Polk award in particular honored Marshall for his &quot;tenacious investigative reporting&quot; which &quot;sparked interest by the traditional news media and led to the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.&quot;

After a weekend writer noticed that the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas was being replaced with a former adviser to Karl Rove, Marshall discovered that U.S. Attorney Carol Lam was also being asked to resign. Carol Lam successfully prosecuted Republican California Representative Duke Cunningham on bribery charges and was in the middle of an ongoing criminal investigation into a congressional scandal of historic proportions. &quot;I was stunned by it,&quot; Marshall told the &quot;Financial Times&quot;. &quot;Normally, in a case like that, the prosecutor would be untouchable.&quot;

National newspapers were slow to pick up the story. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Washington bureau chief Jay Carney went so far as to accuse Marshall of &quot;seeing broad partisan conspiracies where none likely exist.&quot; By the time &quot;The New York Times&quot; first reported on Lam&#x27;s firing (on page 17), Marshall and his news sites had already posted 15 articles on the story.

Two months after posting his accusatory article, Carney apologized to Marshall. &quot;Josh Marshall at TalkingPointsMemo and everyone else out there whose instincts told them there was something deeply wrong and even sinister about the firings... deserve tremendous credit.&quot; Carney went on to write, &quot;I was wrong. Very nice work, and thanks for holding my feet to the fire.&quot;

For doggedly pursuing the story, Arianna Huffington nominated Joshua Marshall and the &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; team to the Time 100.

==Personal life==

Marshall married Millet Israeli in March 2005, and the couple live in New York City with their sons Sam and Daniel.

<text>In computing, a data source name (DSN, sometimes known as a database source name, though &quot;data sources&quot; can comprise other repositories apart from databases) is a string that has an associated data structure used to describe a connection to a data source. Most commonly used in connection with ODBC, DSNs also exist for JDBC and for other data access mechanisms. The term often overlaps with &quot;connection string&quot;. Most systems do not make a distinction between DSNs or connection strings and the term can often be used interchangeably.

DSN attributes may include, but are not limited to:

* the name of the data source
* the location of the data source
* the name of a database driver which can access the data source
* a user ID for data access (if required)
* a user password for data access (if required)

The system administrator of a client machine generally creates a separate DSN for each relevant data source.

Standardizing DSNs offers a level of indirection; various applications (for example: Apache/PHP and IIS/ASP) can take advantage of this in accessing shared data sources.

== Types of data source name ==
Two kinds of DSN exist:

* Machine DSNs – stored in collective configuration files (e.g., /etc/odbc.ini, ~/.odbc.ini) and/or system resources (e.g., Windows Registry HKLM\Software\ODBC\odbc.ini)
* File DSNs – stored in the filesystem with one DSN per file

These are further broken down into
* System DSNs – accessible by any and all processes and users of the system, stored in a centralized location (e.g., , )
* User DSNs – accessible only by the user who created the DSN, stored in a user-specific location (e.g., , )

== Example of use ==
Software (e.g., Crystal Reports, Microsoft Excel, PHP, Perl, Python, Ruby) users can submit CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) queries to a data source by establishing a connection to the DSN.

ASP (VBScript) code to open a DSN connection might look like the following:
Dim DatabaseObject1
Set DatabaseObject1 = Server.CreateObject(&quot;ADODB.Connection&quot;)
DatabaseObject1.Open(&quot;DSN=example;&quot;)
In PHP using the PEAR::DB package to open a connection without an external DSN (a &quot;DSN-less connection&quot;, i.e., using a Connection String), the code might resemble the following
require_once(&quot;DB.php&quot;);
//$dsn = &quot;&lt;driver&gt;://&lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;database&gt;&quot;;
$dsn = &quot;mysql://john:pass@localhost:3306/my_db&quot;;
$db = DB::connect($dsn);
PHP with PDO.

$dsn = &quot;mysql:host=localhost;dbname=example&quot;;
$dbh = new PDO($dsn, $username, $password);
In Perl, using the Perl DBI module, each driver has its own syntax for the DSN attributes. The only requirement that DBI makes is that all the information, except for username and password is supplied in a single string argument.
my $dsn = &quot;DBI:Pg:database=finance;host=db.example.com;port=$port&quot;;
 $dsn = &quot;DBI:mysql:database=$database;host=$hostname;port=$port&quot;;
 $dsn = &quot;DBI:Oracle:host=$host;sid=$sid;port=$port&quot;;
 $dsn = &quot;DBI:SQLite:dbname=$dbfilename&quot;;

my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect($dsn,&#x27;username&#x27;,&#x27;password&#x27;);

* Datasource
* ADO.NET
* JDBC
* ODBC
* OLE DB

<doc id="911356" wikidata="Q3830199" url="?curid=911356" title="Lenny McLean">
<text>Leonard John McLean (9 April 1949 – 28 July 1998) was an English unlicensed boxer, bouncer, bodyguard, businessman and actor. He was known as &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, &quot;the King of the Cobbles&quot; and &quot;the hardest man in Britain&quot;.

McLean&#x27;s pugilist reputation began in the East End of London in the late 1960s and was sustained through to the late 1980s. He stated in his autobiography that he had been involved in between 2,000 and 3,000 unlicensed fights. In his prime, the tall McLean weighed over and was considered the &quot;unofficial heavyweight champion of Great Britain&quot;.

Along with being an unlicensed boxer, McLean was an enforcer in London&#x27;s criminal underworld. As a respected and feared figure, he often associated with infamous criminals such as the Kray twins, Ronnie Biggs and Charles Bronson. He was also known in the London nightclub scene as a bouncer, where he often managed security, including 1980s celebrity hangouts, such as Garth Crooks&#x27;s Team of the Week Club, in Hounslow.

In his later life, McLean became an actor, and received praise for playing Barry the Baptist in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 1998 gangster comedy film &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;. He died in July 1998, shortly before the film&#x27;s release.

==Early life==
Lenny McLean was born into a large, working-class family in Hoxton in the East End of London. His father, Leonard John McLean Sr., had been a Royal Marine during the Second World War, but after being debilitated by a near-fatal disease which he contracted in India, he became a petty criminal and swindler. He died when Lenny was four years old.

Lenny&#x27;s mother, Rose, married again to Jim Irwin, who was also a career petty criminal. Irwin was a violent alcoholic, who physically abused Lenny and his brothers for many years. By the age of ten, McLean had suffered many broken bones. However, when Lenny&#x27;s infant brother Raymond was beaten brutally with a belt, McLean&#x27;s great-uncle Jimmy Spinks, a local gangster, attacked Irwin, nearly killing him, and threatened to cut his throat should he ever need to return to protect the children.

McLean admired his great-uncle thereafter and when he became a street fighter, he said that he considered every victory to be won on behalf of his vulnerable younger self. He expressed the rage resulting from his abusive childhood with such abandon that it often took several men to separate him from his defeated opponent, gaining him the nickname &quot;Ten Men Len&quot; because of how many men were needed to restrain him. McLean&#x27;s son Jamie later said, &quot;My dad wasn&#x27;t a born fighter. He was uneducated and a product of his upbringing, traumatised by what he’d been through, and probably had mental health problems as a result of all that. Fighting was all he knew.&quot;

==Unlicensed boxing==
During his teenage years, McLean mixed with various local criminals. He was arrested for petty crimes and served 18 months in prison. After he was fired from his first legitimate job for beating up his foreman, he worked odd jobs. By the age of fifteen, McLean realised he could earn a living from fighting and pursued it as his main means of income.

McLean&#x27;s first unlicensed boxing match came about as a result of a chance meeting while in his late teens. When his car broke down in the Blackwall Tunnel, he abandoned it and went to buy a replacement from an associate named Kenny Mac, a gypsy used-car salesman in Kingsland Road, Hackney, only to find the replacement quickly failed too. McLean returned later to demand his money back. Instead of refunding McLean, Mac offered to give McLean a new car in exchange for him fighting in one of Mac&#x27;s unlicensed boxing bouts later that night in Mac&#x27;s yard. McLean&#x27;s opponent lasted less than a minute against him, earning McLean £500, a considerable prize at the time. Mac and McLean became friends and on numerous later bouts Mac acted as McLean&#x27;s boxing manager. McLean became the best-known bare-knuckle street fighter in Britain.

When Frank Warren formed the National Boxing Council in the 1970s, it allowed the toughest underground fighters in Britain to compete legally. McLean, unable to become a licensed boxer due to his violent reputation and lengthy criminal record, entered the world of unlicensed boxing, which, although legal, was not sanctioned by the British Boxing Board of Control. He quickly became one of its brightest stars and had a fearsome reputation.

McLean had a famous trilogy of unlicensed matches with arch-rival Roy &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Shaw. McLean lost to Shaw once via verbal submission, which McLean justified by claiming his gloves had been tampered with, reducing their maneuverability. McLean beat Shaw in a rematch with a dramatic first-round knockout, in which Shaw was physically knocked out of the ring. In their final bout, McLean ended the feud with a brutal first-round knockout at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London in September 1978.

McLean, who in his prime was tall and weighed over , boasted that he could beat anybody, in either a legitimate match or in an unlicensed match with or without gloves. He reputedly sent out challenges to many of the famous boxers of the day, including Muhammad Ali and Mr. T, though neither contest materialised. McLean lost some face as he was challenged by the &quot;King of the Gypsies&quot; Bartley Gorman, but did not accept the fight. He was offered a fight with professional boxer David &quot;Bomber&quot; Pearce, the hard-hitting British heavyweight champion from Newport. McLean declined to fight Pearce; he later commented that was the only time in his career he had doubts.

Large portions of McLean&#x27;s career cannot be verified, since his fights were unsanctioned by the boxing authorities. He was known to have lost several fights, although he always maintained that he had never lost a fight &quot;on the cobbles&quot; or outside the ring. In unlicensed matches, he was twice stopped by Cliff Field. Field had been beaten by Pearce&#x27;s brother, &#x27;Bimbo Pearce&#x27;, and twice beaten by Johnny &quot;Big Bad&quot; Waldron. McLean also lost via KO to George &quot;Pappy&quot; Langley and on points to Kevin Paddock. In his autobiography, McLean claimed to have competed in almost 4,000 fights over three decades, and said he won the large majority of these.

==Other professions==
With his fame as an unlicensed boxer, McLean became known as &quot;The King of Bouncers&quot; around many of the clubs and pubs in London. He held joint ownership of a public house in the East End of London named the &quot;Guv&#x27;Nors&quot; along with Charlie Kray, elder brother of the Kray twins, reputed to be the &quot;most legitimate&quot; of the three brothers.

McLean was also described as a &quot;fixer&quot; and a &quot;minder&quot;, meaning a bodyguard, for criminals and celebrities including Mike Reid, Boy George, and the casts of television shows such as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;. According to McLean&#x27;s autobiography, his name was useful for the smooth progress of various criminal dealings, and to warn off members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army and the Mafia.

In 1992, McLean released an album of Elvis Presley covers. The album was entitled &quot;Lenny Sings...&quot;. He claimed &quot;The King meets The Guvnor. It&#x27;s sure to be a winner.&quot; His lead single &quot;Blue Suede Shoes&quot; failed to break into the top 200 and the album was subsequently scrapped.

==Acting career==
McLean was featured prominently in a television documentary on nightclub security staff, titled &quot;Bounce: Behind The Velvet Rope&quot;. He gravitated towards acting after being introduced to an acting agent by his show-business friends Mike Reid and Freddie Starr, for whom he had &quot;minded&quot;. He also made industry connections by &quot;minding&quot; the casts of television shows such as &quot;EastEnders&quot; and &quot;The Bill&quot;.

After playing a brief unbilled cameo as a ringside spectator in the drama film &quot;The Krays&quot; (1990), McLean played gangster Eddie Davies in ITV&#x27;s customs drama &quot;The Knock&quot; and had a small part as a police chief in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; (1997). His largest and most famous role was in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot; (1998), playing the part of criminal enforcer &#x27;Barry the Baptist&#x27;.

==Personal life==

At age 12, he was 4 ft 2 and weighed 8 stone. At age twenty, McLean married Valerie. They later had two children, a son named Jamie and a daughter named Kelly. McLean described his family as his &quot;rock,&quot; whose existence helped him to reject a life solely devoted to crime, and for whom he maintained some self-control during his fights. His daughter Kelly, a mother of two, has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and says doctors told her that McLean likely had a version of the disorder himself.

Being a famous figure in unlicensed boxing, McLean made fans as well as enemies, such as the supporters of his boxing rivals and disgruntled punters who had lost money betting on McLean&#x27;s opponents. McLean also had enemies from years of ejecting people from pubs and clubs. He suffered two bullet wounds from separate attacks, and was attacked from behind and stabbed on two occasions. One of the assailants, Barry Dalton, a former bare-knuckle fighter who ran protection rackets across London, had a falling out with McLean and confronted him with a shotgun at his home while his children were in the house. McLean said that he later caught up with Dalton and punished him. Dalton had made many other enemies, and was found dead with a bullet in his head in 1992, a murder for which McLean asserted his innocence. It was stated that the murder of Dalton was ordered by a gang of East London gangsters and that McLean was uninvolved, though the murder has not been officially solved.

===1992 court case===
In 1992, McLean was working as the head doorman at the Hippodrome in London&#x27;s Leicester Square, when he ejected a man named Gary Humphries, who suffered from serious mental health problems and was reportedly on drugs, streaking through the nightclub, urinating on the floor and harassing women. McLean admitted to &quot;giving him a backhander.&quot; Humphries died later that night and had a broken jaw and severe neck injuries. McLean was arrested for the murder of Humphries. McLean immediately protested his innocence, and claimed the police had a vendetta against him because of his association with the Krays.

McLean&#x27;s charge was reduced to manslaughter, of which he was cleared at the Old Bailey when it emerged that Humphries had been in a scuffle with the police after being ejected from the nightclub. Reportedly, the police had forcefully restrained him with a stranglehold. Professor Gresham, a pathologist who had worked on many high-profile murder cases, gave evidence that the stranglehold applied by the police probably caused the neck injuries which led to Humphries&#x27; death. However, it was determined that McLean was responsible for Humphries&#x27; broken jaw. Charged with, and found guilty of, grievous bodily harm, McLean served an 18-month prison sentence.

===Death===
During the filming of Guy Ritchie&#x27;s &quot;Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels&quot;, McLean fell ill with what he believed to be flu. He was diagnosed with pleurisy. A further X-ray examination proved he was suffering from lung cancer, which had metastasised to his brain. He died shortly afterwards on 28 July 1998, in Bexley, London, a few weeks prior to the release of the film. Ritchie dedicated the film to him and had its billboards changed to feature McLean in tribute.

==Biographies==
McLean&#x27;s autobiography, titled &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, written with Peter Gerrard, was published in August 1998, shortly after McLean&#x27;s death. It had an initial print run of 3,000 copies, but took off and soon occupied the number one position on the bestsellers&#x27; lists. In 2001, Gerrard authored another book about McLean, titled &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor: A Celebration&quot;.

McLean&#x27;s widow, Valerie, co-authored &quot;Married To The Guv&#x27;nor&quot; with Gerrard in 2003, and produced a foreword to the 2007 book about McLean by Anthony Thomas titled &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor Through The Eyes Of Others&quot;. In October 2017, &quot;The Guv&#x27;nor Revealed – The Untold Story of Lenny McLean&quot; by Thomas and Lee Wortley was released. In July 2018, McLean&#x27;s daughter Kelly released the book &quot;My Dad: The Guv&#x27;nor&quot; with ghostwriter Lee Wortley.

==Film adaptions==
In his autobiography, McLean recounts that various film studios had expressed an interest in making a film based on his life and career in unlicensed boxing. McLean wanted Craig Fairbrass to portray him as he had known the actor for some time, and considered Fairbrass resembled himself as a younger man. McLean travelled to Hollywood to discuss the matter with film studio executives, but their preference for Sylvester Stallone for the part caused McLean to discontinue negotiations. One supposed film promoter, later found to have been a conman, took more than a million pounds from McLean and disappeared. The plan fell into hiatus on McLean&#x27;s death.

&quot;The Guv&#x27;nor&quot;, a documentary about McLean&#x27;s life, as seen through the eyes of his son Jamie, was released in 2016. The drama film &quot;My Name Is Lenny&quot; was released in 2017, featuring Australian actor Josh Helman in the title role, and Michael Bisping as Roy &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Shaw. A reviewer for &quot;The Times&quot; said Helman was &quot;woefully miscast&quot; as McLean.

<text>The spot-bellied eagle-owl (Ketupa nipalensis), also known as the forest eagle-owl is a large bird of prey with a formidable appearance. It is a forest-inhabiting species found in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. This species is considered part of a superspecies with the barred eagle-owl (&quot;Ketupa sumatrana&quot;), which looks quite similar but is allopatric in distribution.

==Taxonomy==
The spot-bellied eagle-owl, like its close relative, the barred eagle-owl, is one of the species that would have to be moved into &quot;Ketupa&quot; if that genus is to be retained, according to mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data (Olsen &quot;et al.&quot; 2002). Unlike the &quot;fish owls&quot; that were also considered to be included in &quot;Ketupa&quot;, the barred and the spot-bellied species are not closely tied to riparian habitats and piscivorous eating habits. However, all eagle-owls and fish owls (as well as the snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandianus&quot;)) were at one point deemed insufficiently distinct to warrant separate genera and until fairly recently authors generally treat all within the genus &quot;Bubo&quot;. Due to its forest-dwelling habits and some superficial characteristics, it has been wondered by some authors if the spot-bellied eagle-owl is related to the rainforest-dwelling eagle-owls of Africa, namely the Fraser&#x27;s (&quot;Ketupa poensis&quot;) and similarly-sized Shelley&#x27;s eagle-owl (&quot;Ketupa shelleyi&quot;). However, more extensive genetic research indicates paraphyly with no recent common ancestor between the &quot;Ketupa&quot; owls and the more &quot;typical&quot; &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. Therefore the &quot;Ketupa&quot; owls (including the spot-bellied eagle-owl) are now widely considered as belonging to a distinct genus.

==Description==

The spot-bellied eagle-owl is a large species of owl. It measures from in length. It is the sixth longest owl in the world on average and has the ninth longest wings of any living owl. The widely reported weight range for this species is , but this is probably towards the low end (possibly from &quot;K. n. blighi&quot;) or is possibly representative only of smaller males. That body mass range is similar to that of the larger race of barred eagle-owl, which are in all races considerably smaller going on total length, standard measurements and appearance. One female shot near Haputale in the Badulla District of Sri Lanka, where the owls are smaller than to the north, was found to have weighed . Perhaps a more correct average weight range for the species is . A large owl, presumed as an eagle-owl, recorded on the illegal wildlife trade from India purportedly weighed . The ear-tufts of the spot-bellied are very long and conspicuously of variable length, giving them a somewhat scraggly appearance at the tips. The ear-tufts of the spot-bellied eagle-owl measure in length. The spot-bellied eagle-owl has feathered legs and feet, like most eagle-owls, but the terminal digits of the toes are bare before the talons. The feet and talons are as formidable as any eagle-owl, being very large, heavy and powerful for their size. This species typically measures in wing chord length, in tail length, in tarsal length and in culmen length. The subspecies of spot-bellied eagle-owl found on Sri Lanka, &quot;K. n. blighi&quot;, is linearly about 10% smaller than the birds found further north in India but about the same size as owls from the southern tip of India. &quot;K. n. blighi&quot; has a wing chord length of , a tail length of , a longer tarsus than northern birds at and a culmen length of . One bird from Sri Lanka had a middle talon of , a toe length of and a wingspan of . The reported talon length above is very large relative to the size of this owl – the Eurasian eagle-owls found in Spain (&quot;Bubo bubo hispanus&quot;), although relatively small compared to other Eurasian eagle-owl races, were shown to have smaller talon lengths than the Sri Lankan spot-bellied eagle-owl. Other than size, the only feature that distinguishes northern birds from Sri Lankan birds is an ill-defined band of honey-brown colour on the pectorals.
The spot-bellied eagle-owl is overall a stark, grayish-brown bird, with dark, coarse brown coloration over the back and upper wings. The throat and underparts are mainly pale fulvous in color with black and white horizontal stripes along the flanks of the body that become broad spots on the abdomen and undertail coverts. On the wings, the primaries are dark brown with lighter brown stripes and the secondaries are more heavily barred with buff-brown coloration. The lores are covered in bristly feathers and the cheeks are brownish-white with black feather shafts. The large ear-tufts slant off to the sides. Juveniles birds are distinct from adult birds, being a much paler grayish-cream overall with fairly heavy brownish barring. Distinguishing the spot-bellied eagle-owl is relatively straightforward, since other Indian and southeast Asian eagle owls do not generally dwell in deep forests as does this species. The spot-bellied is the largest of the owls in its range other than the tawny fish owl (&quot;Ketupa flavipes&quot;), which is restricted in both habitat and diet to mountain streams. The brown fish owl (&quot;Ketupa zeylonensis&quot;), which is quite different in colouring if seen reasonably well, is slightly smaller linearly than the spot-bellied eagle-owl and is found in more wetland-based (and often somewhat more degraded) habitats. The subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo hemachalana&quot;) found in the Himalayas may inhabit higher elevations of the same mountains where the spot-bellied eagle-owl dwells in the lower elevations in the forested foothills but there their ranges barely abut. The Indian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bengalensis&quot;) (typically found in wooded vicinities of rocky areas) is around 10% smaller than the spot-bellied; the dusky eagle-owl (&quot;Ketupa coromanda&quot;) (typically found in woods near wetlands) is around 15% smaller; and the brown wood owl, the largest &quot;Strix&quot; widely found in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia, is around 35% smaller. Furthermore, the colouring and markings of the spot-bellied eagle-owl are distinctive from all but the barred eagle-owl, which it does not co-exist with in the wild. The barred and spot-bellied eagle-owls are immediately distinguished in the field from other eagle-owls by their pale-looking, sideways slanting ear-tufts, and the degree of feathering on the legs and feet. This species pair unlike sympatric eagle-owls has horizontal rather than vertical underside markings (which coalesce somewhat in the barred eagle-owl to barring, but appear as almost continuous spotting on the spot-bellied eagle-owl) over a much paler ground colour, while the back is slightly grayer looking, lacking any warmer brown or tawny tones.

===Voice===
This owl is noted for its strange, human-sounding call, and it has been suggested that it is the same as the cryptid known as &quot;ulama&quot; or &quot;Devil Bird&quot; in Sri Lanka. A local name is Maha Bakamuna (&quot;large horned owl&quot;). According to http://www.cryptozoology.com, in July 2001 it was confirmed that &quot;ulama&quot; description perfectly matches spot-bellied eagle-owl. This call consists of a scream, which rises and then falls in tone. The territorial call of the species consists of low hoots with two-second intervals between &quot;hoo&quot;s. The voice is booming, deep and carries quite far. It is usual for forest-dwelling owls (and many different kinds of birds) to have an extensive and complex range of vocalizations since vision is more limited than in open or semi-open habitats. However, the spot-bellied eagle-owl has relatively small ear openings, even for a member of the genus &quot;Bubo&quot;, suggesting that some territorial behaviour is carried out visually instead of auditorily.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species is distributed through the Lower Himalayas from Kumaon east to Burma, thence to central Laos and central Vietnam. They are found throughout the Indian subcontinent and peninsular Southeast Asia, reaching the southernmost limits of their range in Sri Lanka and 12 degrees north in southern Thailand. The spot-bellied eagle-owl dwells mainly in primary or older second growth forests. Potentially, they can come to inhabit nearly all varieties of land-based habitats but prefer those such as dense, evergreen forests or moist deciduous forests within their range, though they do extend into tropical valleys, &quot;terrai&quot; and &quot;shola&quot; in the lower hills of India. Although often considered uncommon to somewhat rare, recent photographic evidence indicates that they are widely found in different parts of India and may simply avoid detection, so long as appropriate wooded habitat remains. They are found in a range of climates from the temperate woodlands of Nepal to the humid, tropical rainforest of Southeast Asia. However. the spot-bellied eagle-owl is mainly a species of tropical and subtropical foothills, mostly distributed at elevations of , but it can be found from sea-level to , the latter in the Transhimalayas.

==Behaviour==

The spot-bellied eagle-owl is nocturnal and often spends its day hidden in the dense foliage of large forest trees. However, they have been observed on the move and even hunting during the day, especially in forests with minimal human disturbance. Their activity normally picks up at dusk as they begin to hunt. In larger forest owls, a partially diurnal behaviour is not uncommon. The bright whitish colouration, overlaid with brownish cross-bars, forming a brow over the eyes to the front of the ear-tufts is theorised to play a primary role in expression of behavioural intent.

===Diet===
This is a very powerful and bold predatory owl, which is assuredly at the top of the avian food chain in its forested range. However, no extensive study of its dietary habits is known. Even in larger eagle-owls such as the Eurasian eagle-owl, although they can and do prey on a wide range of prey including impressively large prey, most of the diet consists of small mammals, often small rodents such as voles and rats. There is no reason to assume that the spot-bellied eagle-owl does not also take a very large quantity of relatively small prey such as rodents until complete dietary studies are known. However, almost all of the prey thus far reported for this species is very large and impressive, much of it being presumably as heavy or heavier than the eagle-owls themselves. Due to being most widely reported as being chased and eaten by spot-bellied eagle-owls has led some authors to list their primary prey as pheasants. Among these, junglefowl (&quot;Gallus&quot; sp.) and kalij pheasants (&quot;Lophura leucomelanos&quot;), both weighing from , are commonly eaten, as well as Indian peafowl (&quot;Pavo cristatus&quot;), which can weigh anything from . The spot-bellied eagle-owl pounces on gamebirds while they&#x27;re asleep on their perches in trees or bamboo clumps, often killing them in seconds with their powerful talons. Cases, where they&#x27;ve followed peafowl to their roosts and then pulled them out at sundown, have been reported. It also consumes an array of mammals, from small rodents to large prey such as apparent adults of golden jackals (&quot;Canis aureus&quot;), hares (&quot;Lepus&quot; ssp.), large Indian civets (&quot;Viverra zibetha&quot;), Indian spotted chevrotains (&quot;Moschiola indica&quot;), and even young muntjacs (&quot;Muntiacus&quot; sp.). These larger mammals are likely as much as or even more. While most reported prey appear to be largely terrestrial, they are known to capture arboreal prey including Indian giant squirrel (&quot;Ratufa indica&quot;) and juvenile purple-faced langur (&quot;Trachypithecus vetulus&quot;). Additionally, they are considered a potential threat to toque monkeys (&quot;Macaca sinica&quot;), and one apparently caught an Indian flying fox (&quot;Pteropus giganteus&quot;) from its tree roost. Due to the capture of diurnal prey such as giant squirrel, partial daytime foraging habits have been inferred for the spot-bellied eagle owl. They will also opportunistically prey upon snakes, lizards (including large monitor lizards) and fish. Like several of the eagle-owls and fish owls but unlike most owls, the spot-bellied eagle-owl has been recorded as feeding on carrion. Thus far, they&#x27;ve been seen feeding on the carcases of goats (&quot;Capra aegagrus hircus&quot;) and tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;).

===Breeding===

This species&#x27; nesting season is from December to March, however, an egg has been recorded as late as June in Cachar. Most nesting sites are in large, spacious tree hollows. Alternately, they use abandoned stick nests made by other large birds, in many cases those previously built by eagles, vultures or kites. They&#x27;ve additionally been recorded as nesting in caves and sheltered fissures of rock walls. In this species, only one egg has ever been recorded per clutch and this is only one of three amongst all owl species (besides the buffy fish owl (&quot;Ketupa ketupu&quot;) and the barred eagle-owl) where this is known to be the case. The egg is white and round ovoid in shape with a smooth surface, averaging in size, and are thus around the same size as the eggs of the largest living owls, the Eurasian eagle-owl and Blakiston&#x27;s fish owl (&quot;Ketupa blakistoni&quot;). It has been reported that both sexes engage in incubation but this may not be the case (male owls generally do little to no incubating in eagle-owls), with the male more likely temporarily covering the eggs while the female flies off for a short period. Few further details are known of their breeding biology, including the brooding and fledging stages due to this species reportedly being very fierce and aggressive in defence of their nests. Anecdotes have claimed that some rather serious injuries have been incurred in the process of approaching spot-bellied eagle-owl nests, thus caution and distance from active nests is recommended.

==Status==
This species is generally uncommon, likely needing large hunting and breeding territories and thus occurs at low densities. However, it continues to occur over a large range and is not thought to be conservation dependent. Areas where deforestation occurs are likely to be vacated by this species, which is perhaps the only widespread threat faced by this owl. Despite its unknown and probably declining population size, the spot-bellied eagle-owl is evaluated as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

<text>Walter William Pierce (April 2, 1927 – July 31, 2015) was an American starting pitcher in Major League Baseball between 1945 and 1964 who played most of his career for the Chicago White Sox. He was the team&#x27;s star pitcher in the decade from 1952 to 1961, when they posted the third best record in the major leagues, and received the Sporting News Pitcher of the Year Award for the American League (AL) in and after being runner-up in both 1953 and 1955. A seven-time All-Star, he led the American League (AL) in complete games three times despite his slight build, and in wins, earned run average (ERA) and strikeouts once each. He pitched four one-hitters and seven two-hitters in his career, and on June 27, came within one batter of becoming the first left-hander in 78 years to throw a perfect game.

He was one of the principal figures in Chicago&#x27;s fierce rivalry with the New York Yankees; particularly notable were his matchups with Whitey Ford, with the two left-handers opposing one another as starters 14 times from 1955 to 1960. Pierce&#x27;s record suffered from pitching so much against New York – who he faced more often than any other team – when the Yankees dynasty was at its peak; but although his career record against New York was only 25–37, that was still slightly better than the 27–41 mark compiled by National League (NL) championship teams over 11 World Series against the Yankees during the same period.

After joining the San Francisco Giants in 1962, Pierce played a pivotal role in helping them win the NL pennant, going 12–0 in home games and getting a three-hit shutout and a save in a three-game playoff against the Los Angeles Dodgers to clinch the title. His 1,999 career strikeouts were the fifth most by a left-hander when he retired, and his AL total of 1,842 ranked ninth in league history. He also ranked tenth among left-handers in career wins (211), sixth in games started (432) and games pitched (585), eighth in shutouts (38) and ninth in innings pitched (). He holds the White Sox franchise record for career strikeouts (1,796), and his club marks of 186 wins, 2,931 innings and 390 starts are team records for a left-hander. The White Sox retired his number 19 in 1987, and unveiled a statue in his honor at U.S. Cellular Field in 2007; he was selected to the White Sox All-Century Team in 2000.

==Early baseball career==

===Youth baseball===
The son of pharmacist Walter Pierce and his wife Julia, Billy Pierce grew up in Highland Park, Michigan, and showed his first interest in baseball at age ten. He recalled: &quot;I refused to have my tonsils removed. My folks offered me a major league baseball and a good glove if I&#x27;d have the operation. I took the payola. It really was a thrill to throw around that &#x27;league&#x27; ball.&quot; After starting out as a first baseman, he switched to pitching to emulate his hero, Detroit Tigers star Tommy Bridges, who like Pierce had a slight build. He attended Highland Park Community High School where his teammates included future major league pitcher Ted Gray, and pitched six shutouts as a junior in 1944, earning the nickname &quot;Mr. Zero&quot;. He was the starting and winning pitcher in an East-West All-American Boys&#x27; Game sponsored by &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, held on August 7, 1944, at the Polo Grounds in New York, with Connie Mack managing Pierce&#x27;s East All-Stars; one reporter wrote, &quot;His fast ball was amazing when one considers that he only weighs 140 pounds. In civilian attire he seemed very slender.&quot; The West team included catcher and future Hall of Fame center fielder Richie Ashburn, who was hitless in two at bats against Pierce. The game was held as a benefit for World War II community memorials, and two days prior to the event the participating players were guests of Babe Ruth on his weekly radio program. Pierce was voted the game&#x27;s outstanding player, winning a four-year scholarship to the college of his choice. &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; sports editor Dale Stafford, who chaperoned him to New York, later told a fellow writer, &quot;I never saw such a clean-living youngster. On our trip to New York for the East-West game, Billy kept a diary. One morning I found it open to this entry: &#x27;Here it is ten o&#x27;clock and Mr. Stafford still hasn&#x27;t gone to bed.&#x27;&quot; Pierce downplayed the experience of pitching in a major league stadium, stating, &quot;I was not nervous at the Polo Grounds, as I&#x27;ve pitched several games in Briggs Stadium back home. I&#x27;ve worked out there with the Tigers, and they, the Red Sox and the Phillies have been interested in me. But my folks and I decided that I&#x27;d make up my mind about playing pro ball after I graduated from high school.&quot; After considering studying medicine at the University of Michigan, he signed with his hometown Tigers for a bonus of $15,000.

==Major League Baseball==

===Detroit Tigers (1945, 1948)===
He made the Tigers team in spring training 1945 before finishing high school and without having played in the minor leagues, but sat on the bench before making his major league debut in June 1945, just a few weeks after his 18th birthday. He made three relief appearances that month and two more in September after a two-month stint with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League under manager Bucky Harris, and was on the Detroit roster for the team&#x27;s victory in the 1945 World Series although he did not appear in any games. He had a remarkably unassuming presence; Paul Richards, then a catcher for the Tigers, later recalled occasionally going to his neighborhood drugstore. One day, Pierce went up to him at practice and asked why Richards never talked to him at the store, with Richards replying that he didn&#x27;t know what Pierce was talking about; Pierce answered that the drugstore was his family&#x27;s, and Richards slowly realized that Pierce had been the clerk behind the counter each time he went in.&lt;ref name=&quot;James/Neyer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierce was sent back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team&#x27;s front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was attributed to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider to be one of the most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce&#x27;s high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as to whether it was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.

===Chicago White Sox (1949–1961)===
In his first seasons with White Sox, Pierce&#x27;s control problems continued; his 137 walks in 1950 tied him for the fourth most ever by an AL left-hander. But those seasons also included indications of his developing excellence, as well as the struggles he would face in gaining run support. On May 29, 1949, in just his sixth start with Chicago (and the 11th of his career), the 22-year-old Pierce was matched against 42-year-old Negro league legend Satchel Paige in a road game against the defending World Series champion Cleveland Indians. The pitchers&#x27; duel went into the 11th inning, when Pierce walked leadoff hitter Ken Keltner, followed by two bunt singles. After Pierce was replaced by a reliever and the next batter lined to shortstop Luke Appling, Lou Boudreau singled to give Cleveland a 2–1 win; Pierce had himself scored Chicago&#x27;s only run after singling in the eighth inning. And on June 15, 1950, against the World Series champion Yankees, Pierce got his first career shutout – a 5–0 one-hitter, interrupted by rain delays in the second, fourth and fifth innings totaling over an hour and a half, with the only hit being Billy Johnson&#x27;s single in the fifth inning.

==Early 1950s==

===Development of style===
Over 13 seasons with the White Sox, Pierce was the ace of the pitching staff, leading the team in wins nine times and in strikeouts eight times. He was Chicago&#x27;s Opening Day starter seven times (1951–52, 1954, 1956–59), and started the home opener in 1953 and 1961. He had an outstanding fastball and an excellent curveball, and in 1951 added the slider (for which he used his motion for the curve rather than the fastball) as a third strong pitch, as well as a changeup. He worked quickly with an over-the-top motion, dropping his back shoulder in a style similar to that later used by Sandy Koufax. In 1957, Paul Richards noted of Pierce&#x27;s early style: &quot;He had a tendency to windmill in his delivery, which makes the ball spin too much and takes the life out of it. He flashed his curve-the Yankees always knew when he was throwing a curve. But mainly Bill didn&#x27;t want to throw anything but fast balls in the old days. He laughed at the change-of-pace and the slider, so most of the strong right-hand hitters were laying back for him, waiting for a fast ball down the middle.&quot; After Pierce finally tried the slider against the Yankees, to great effect, Richards noted, &quot;Then, for a while there, he began throwing nothing but sliders. He finally learned about that, too. Even today Pierce will pitch a whole ball game and almost never throw anything but fast balls. But only on certain days.&quot; Yankees star Joe DiMaggio was among those praising Pierce&#x27;s ability, reportedly remarking, &quot;That little so-and-so is a marvel. So little – and all that speed. And I mean speed! He got me out of there on a fastball in the ninth that I&#x27;d have needed a telescope to see.&quot; Richards became Chicago&#x27;s manager in 1951, and worked with Pierce to develop his two new pitches and slow down his pace, as well as significantly improve his control; Pierce later recalled, &quot;I learned to control my fastball better [...] Developing the slider helped me tremendously because it gave me a third out pitch. I threw it almost as hard as my fastball, but I could throw it for strikes better than the fast ball or good curve ... Richards made me work on it, and it took me about two years before it was consistent.&quot; After issuing 249 walks in 391 innings in 1949–1950, Pierce gave up only 73 walks in 240 innings in 1951, and averaged more than 3 walks per 9 innings in three seasons afterward. His 1951 ERA of 3.03 was fourth best in the league, and he ranked sixth in 1952 with a mark of 2.57. On September 21, 1952, he broke Doc White&#x27;s 1907 club record of 141 strikeouts by a left-hander, ending the season with 144.

On April 16, 1953, against the St. Louis Browns (the second game of the season, and Chicago&#x27;s home opener) Pierce pitched his second one-hitter, a 1–0 victory in which he allowed only a seventh-inning double by Bobby Young; the White Sox gained only two singles in the contest, and scored on a walk, sacrifice hit, error and sacrifice fly. Pierce was chosen to start the All-Star Game for the AL – the first White Sox pitcher ever to do so – and allowed only one hit through three innings (a single by Stan Musial). Boston Red Sox star Ted Williams recalled of the game: &quot;It was a hot day at Crosley Field and I remember being so concerned for little Billy Pierce of the White Sox. Billy probably threw harder than anybody for a guy his size, he had a real big delivery, nice to look at, and he had overcome a lot. I understand he had had epilepsy, and I was really pulling for him. He was a nervous little guy, and here he was starting his first All-Star game in a bandbox park that&#x27;s tough to pitch in, and against Robin Roberts to boot. Pierce held them in the palm of his hand that day. He threw the ball right by everybody.&quot;

During the early 1950s, Richards preferred to arrange his rotation so that Pierce started only every fifth or sixth day, holding him back against weaker teams but using him more often for big games against the powerful Yankees and Indians. Catcher Sherm Lollar later observed that although it was essentially a compliment to Pierce&#x27;s ability, he might have picked up more victories and won 20 games sooner in his career had he faced each opponent more equally. With a 1–0 two-hitter at Washington on August 3, in which the White Sox won on an unearned run in the ninth inning with a hit batter, error and sacrifice fly, Pierce began a streak of consecutive scoreless innings – the longest such streak in the AL between 1926, when Ted Lyons had a 41-inning streak for the White Sox, and 1968; it remains the fifth longest ever by a left-hander, and the longest by an AL southpaw since 1905. The streak ended when he allowed two unearned runs against the Browns in the sixth inning on August 19; two additional earned runs in the tenth inning ended his streak, dating to July 29, of innings without an earned run, and gave him a 4–3 loss. He led the league in strikeouts (186) and was second in ERA (2.72), and on September 27 started for the White Sox in the final game in Browns history, winning 2–1 in 11 innings at St. Louis. His seven shutouts that season were the second most by an AL left-hander since 1916, matched only by Hal Newhouser&#x27;s 1945 total of eight.

====Progress interrupted====
Pierce&#x27;s 1954 season was interrupted when he reported pain in his left arm in a May 25 win over Cleveland; after several days of difficulty in determining the problem, he had oral surgery to remove an infected wisdom tooth and adjacent molar on June 3. He did not pitch again until June 20, but a lack of arm strength caused him to be ineffective in that start before slowly coming back with two relief appearances and another poor start, finally picking up wins with consecutive 3–0 shutouts on July 5 and 11, the latter being his fourth career two-hitter. It was later reported that the tooth problem had possibly existed as early as spring training, when Pierce initially suffered arm problems. But although he recorded only nine wins that season, he was one of just four pitchers to defeat the Indians three times as they racked up a league-record 111 victories, after also having been one of four pitchers to defeat the champion Yankees four times in 1953.

Playing the Yankees on June 25, 1953, he was part of a rare defensive shift; leading 4–2 in the ninth inning, he was moved to first base, with Harry Dorish entering in relief. Pinch hitter Don Bollweg barely beat out a bunt single to first base, but Pierce than recorded a putout on Gil McDougald&#x27;s grounder to third base. He then retook the mound, and after issuing a walk, gained the final two outs to finish the victory; the White Sox set an AL record by using five first basemen in the game. Pierce was also an excellent baserunner, and was used as a pinch runner 30 times between 1949 and 1957 – even scoring as a substitute for three-time stolen base champion Minnie Miñoso in a 5–4 victory over the Yankees on June 22, 1956.

==Late 1950s==

===Peak years===

In 1955 Pierce again started the All-Star Game, going into the All-Star break with a record of just 5–6 in spite of his 2.11 ERA; in his last two starts before the break, he suffered back-to-back 1–0 losses to Early Wynn and Bob Lemon of the Indians. In the All-Star Game he allowed only one baserunner through three innings (a leadoff single by Red Schoendienst, who was thrown out on a steal attempt); he staked the AL to a 4–0 lead, but the National League came back for a 6–5 win in 10 innings after scoring five runs off Whitey Ford in the seventh and eighth innings. Pierce ended the season with the league lead in ERA (although his record was just 15–10), with his mark of 1.97 being the lowest by a major league pitcher between Hal Newhouser in 1946 (1.94) and Sandy Koufax in 1963 (1.88); he led the major leagues by nearly two thirds of a run, with Ford having the next best mark at 2.63. Total Baseball has rated Pierce as the best pitcher in the major leagues in 1955, after having placed him among the AL&#x27;s top five pitchers each year from 1951 to 1953.

In 1956 he started his third All-Star Game, but was charged with the loss despite allowing only one run in three innings. Buoyed by the arrival of rookie shortstop Luis Aparicio, who sparked the team in leading the league in stolen bases, the White Sox enjoyed a two-month offensive surge from June 4 to August 3 in which they averaged eight runs in Pierce&#x27;s 13 starts; he won 11 of the games, losing only those immediately before and after the All-Star break, the latter being a 2–1 loss to Ford and the Yankees. He became the first White Sox pitcher since 1941 to win 20 games, was second in the AL with a career-high 192 strikeouts (a team record for left-handers until Gary Peters had 205 in 1964), and was named AL Pitcher of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;, outpolling Ford (who had edged him in a close 1955 vote) by a margin of 117 to 52; he also finished fifth in voting for the AL Most Valuable Player Award. In 1957 Pierce became the first White Sox pitcher since Red Faber (1920–1922) to earn 20 victories in consecutive seasons; he tied Jim Bunning for the league lead, and bested him in voting for AL Pitcher of the Year. He had six consecutive complete game victories from May 16 to June 8 in which his total ERA was 0.64, with two 1–0 victories in ten innings including his sixth career two-hitter on June 4 against the Red Sox; the White Sox scored just nine total runs over the last five games in that stretch. Despite the presence of such popular players as Miñoso, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox, Pierce was chosen as the player most popular with White Sox fans in a 1957 spring training poll of sportswriters. A separate poll of managers, coaches, writers and broadcasters named him Chicago&#x27;s best fielding pitcher, best pitcher at holding runners to first base, and best pitcher for crucial games, as well as the team&#x27;s most nervous player on the field.

====End of peak====
In 1958 he was second in the league in both wins (17) and ERA (2.68); his seventh two-hitter, a 1–0 win on June 21 against the Baltimore Orioles in which the White Sox scored only an unearned run in the first inning, was followed by the greatest game of his career. On June 27 against the Senators, he retired the first 26 batters before pinch hitter Ed Fitz Gerald lined Pierce&#x27;s first pitch down the first base line for an opposite-field double that landed about a foot from the foul line. Pierce then struck out Albie Pearson on three pitches to end the game; only twice did he go to a three-ball count. The lone hit marred what would have been a remarkable accomplishment; not only had no left-hander pitched a perfect game since Lee Richmond in 1880, but only one AL left-hander (Mel Parnell in 1956) pitched even a no-hitter between 1931 and 1962. Although disappointed by the near miss, Pierce praised his teammates for their defensive work, saying, &quot;Give Luis plenty of credit. And Sherm really mixed &#x27;em up beautifully. The big thing is that we won.&quot; At a Capitol lunch with several White Sox players during the following year&#x27;s pennant race, Vice President Richard Nixon told Pierce that he had watched the game on television, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m a Washington fan, but that was one night I was rooting for the White Sox.&quot; In a 1982 interview, Pierce said, &quot;The book on Fitz Gerald was that he was a fastball hitter on the first ball and liked it inside where he could pull it. So we threw him a curve away and he hit into right for a solid hit. I didn&#x27;t feel that badly about it, really. It didn&#x27;t mean that much at the moment. But now ... well, now I wish I had got it. It would have been nice.&quot; His streak of 33 consecutive scoreless innings was ended with an unearned run in the seventh inning on July 1.

Pierce tied for the league lead in complete games each year from 1956 to 1958, and was again selected for the All-Star team each year from 1957 to 1959 and again in 1961, although he only appeared in the 1957 game in which he retired his first five batters before allowing three runs. On June 11, 1959, he pitched his fourth and final one-hitter, a 3–1 victory at Washington in which he allowed only a third-inning double by Ron Samford, who scored after three two-out walks, the last to Harmon Killebrew; the White Sox won on a two-run double in the ninth inning by Jim Landis off Senators starter Camilo Pascual. Pierce had the longest outing of his career on August 6 in a road game against the Orioles, pitching 16 innings in a contest that ended in a 1–1 tie after 18 frames; it proved to be the last time in his career that he pitched into extra innings. After losing his next two starts, pulling a back muscle and straining the ligaments in his right hip against the Kansas City Athletics in the third inning on August 15, he was out of action until a 2–1 win over Kansas City on September 7.

Manager Al López&#x27; decision not to start Pierce in the 1959 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was highly controversial. After Cy Young Award winner Early Wynn started for Chicago in Game 1, Lopez chose to start Bob Shaw (18–6 in the regular season) and Dick Donovan (9–10) in the next two contests, which the White Sox lost by scores of 4–3 and 3–1. Pierce was held back until Game 4, and relieved in each of the final three games of the Series, allowing only two hits and no runs in four innings of work. In Game 4 he entered in the fourth inning with Chicago trailing 4–0, and pitched a hitless three innings before being pulled for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, when the Sox tied the game; the Dodgers went on to win 5–4. In Game 5 he entered in the eighth inning to protect a 1–0 lead, but only issued an intentional walk before Lopez again changed pitchers; the White Sox held on for the 1–0 win. Lopez even chose to start Wynn in Game 6 on two days&#x27; rest, but he was ineffective, and Chicago was behind 8–3 by the time Pierce was brought in to start the eighth inning; the Dodgers later added a run in the ninth inning to complete the 9–3 win and capture the Series championship. Being used out of the bullpen was a deep letdown for Pierce, who said in a 1982 interview, &quot;Other guys, Early Wynn and Bob Shaw, had better years than I did that year. And against the left-handed-heavy lineup the Dodgers threw at us, Al wanted his right-handers like Dick Donovan. There was no question I was disappointed, but I understood.&quot; However, there have been suggestions that Lopez&#x27; decision had other, undisclosed motivations; noting his surprise that Lopez chose to use Pierce out of the bullpen, outfielder Al Smith recalled, &quot;We all knew why Al López didn&#x27;t pitch him, but we never told anyone and I won&#x27;t say now. I will say that I thought he should have pitched. He&#x27;d been pitching all year, hadn&#x27;t he?&quot;

==Offensive support==
Although they never finished below third place from 1952 through 1960, the &quot;Go-Go White Sox&quot; were a team which thrived on speed, defense and pitching rather than hitting, and Pierce struggled for offensive support throughout his time with the club. Both Richards and Lopez – who became Chicago&#x27;s manager in 1957 – placed a low emphasis on offense, with Lopez expressing his philosophy that &quot;all a team really needed was pitching and defense, because if you didn&#x27;t allow the other team to score, eventually they would give you a run, and you&#x27;d win the game.&quot; Nellie Fox, who was also Pierce&#x27;s roommate, turned to him on one occasion when the White Sox picked up a run following a scoring drought and said, &quot;Here&#x27;s your run. Now go out there and hold it.&quot; Although AL teams averaged 4.46 runs per game from 1949 through 1961, and the White Sox averaged 4.53 runs in games started by their other pitchers, they averaged only 4.20 runs in Pierce&#x27;s starts – a figure which drops to 4.07 if the two-month scoring outburst in 1956 is discounted; in over two thirds of his losses with Chicago (105 of 152), and fully one third of his starts (130 of 390), they scored two or fewer runs. They averaged 3.7 runs in his 1953 starts, and 3.6 runs in his 1955 starts; even in 1959, when the pennant-winning White Sox averaged 4.29 runs per game, they averaged only 3.36 runs in Pierce&#x27;s starts. By 1955 it was regularly noted that Chicago&#x27;s offensive struggles were placing undue pressure on the pitching staff, wearing them out with &quot;one tense game after another, never having a comfortable margin that might permit a little breather now and then&quot;; Pierce was described as &quot;the unluckiest pitcher in the majors&quot; that year due to the lack of scoring. But in contrast, when he had a reasonable level of offensive backing he was far more successful, posting a record of 30–11 when Chicago scored four runs and 99–10 when they scored five or more; from September 1951 through May 1958, he was 71–6 when they scored at least four runs and 55–1 when they scored at least five.

==Yankees rivalry==
Pierce played a major role in keeping the White Sox competitive with the powerhouse Yankees through most of the 1950s, and after a rough period from June 1951 to July 1952 in which he dropped 10 of 11 decisions to New York (despite a respectable 3.69 ERA in those games), he held his own against the Yankees, posting a record of 21–21 from August 1952 through the 1960 season. Ironically, the turnaround in his fortunes against the Yankees followed one of Chicago&#x27;s most crushing defeats to their rivals; on July 29, 1952, he left with a 7–3 lead and one out in the eighth inning, only to see the Yankees come back against the White Sox bullpen to win 10–7 on Mickey Mantle&#x27;s grand slam in the ninth. Years later, Pierce still recalled the game as being one of his most frustrating outings. He faced Whitey Ford 15 times in his career (more than against any other pitcher), including a 1–0 loss on May 17, 1955, a 3–2 loss in 10 innings on June 5 later that year, a 2–1 loss on July 15, 1956, a 3–2 loss in 11 innings on September 18 of that year (in which the Yankees clinched the pennant on Mantle&#x27;s 50th home run in the final frame), a 3–1 win on May 21, 1957, and a 4–3 win in 11 innings on April 30, 1959.

By the 1957 season, Shirley Povich of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; expressed a clear preference for Pierce over Ford, writing that anyone doubting Pierce&#x27;s place as the league&#x27;s top left-hander was &quot;risking committal as an incurable psycho who can neither read the figures nor respond to reason.&quot; Pierce&#x27;s 4–3 win over the Yankees on July 28, 1959, put the White Sox in first place, where they stayed for the remainder of the season to take their first pennant in 40 years; it was his 160th victory with Chicago, breaking Doc White&#x27;s team record for wins by a left-hander (he broke White&#x27;s club records for career games and innings by a left-hander the same year). In late 1958, sportswriter Edgar Munzel wrote, &quot;The primary difference between Pierce and Ford, in their long-standing duel for southpaw supremacy in the American League, is that Pierce is pitching for a woefully weak hitting team, while Ford is backed by the league&#x27;s most powerful offensive machine... An even greater boon to Whitey is the fact that he doesn&#x27;t have to face the Yankees.&quot; Of Pierce, who he described as the top White Sox pitcher for the past decade, he added, &quot;Normally, he&#x27;s lucky if he&#x27;s supported with as many as two runs when he faces the Yankees.&quot;

Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv recalled of the rivalry, &quot;I always remember the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they&#x27;d get beat, Mantle would hit a home run.&quot; New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, &quot;The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave &#x27;em to me, and I think he gave &#x27;em to most of us – was Billy Pierce.&quot; Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago for the first half of the 1953 season, said, &quot;Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was right up there on a par with Ford.&quot; Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, &quot;Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic &#x27;stylish&#x27; left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds.&quot; Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.

==Later career==
In his last two seasons with Chicago, Pierce posted records of just 14–7 and 10–9, but a shaky bullpen contributed to his middling record; although he left the game with a lead in the sixth inning or later 15 times in those seasons, White Sox relievers failed to protect that lead seven times. Indeed, Pierce was seen to be the team&#x27;s only consistently effective starter in 1960, picking up eight complete-game victories by mid-August. On June 20, 1961, Pierce broke Ed Walsh&#x27;s White Sox record of 1,732 career strikeouts.

===San Francisco Giants (1962–1964)===
On November 30, 1961, he was traded to the San Francisco Giants along with Don Larsen in exchange for four players (three of them pitchers) who had spent most or all of 1961 in the minor leagues. Giants manager Alvin Dark declared his intent to use Pierce as the ace of a young pitching staff that included developing talents such as Juan Marichal, Gaylord Perry and Mike McCormick. Unlike the White Sox, the Giants featured a powerful offense which included Willie Mays, Willie McCovey and Orlando Cepeda, and Pierce took advantage of the improved run support with his new team, winning his first eight starts before suffering a 4–3 loss on June 7. His first start on April 13 was a deeply rewarding one, after a rough spring training in which he recorded a 16.45 ERA. Facing the Cincinnati Reds, he retired the first 13 batters and allowed only two hits in innings. The crowd of 23,755 gave him a roaring ovation, and he later said, &quot;The cheers really got to me inside. Fans nowhere could have been more wonderful. I felt it way down deep.&quot;

The Giants were credited with pulling off the best deal of the year, with Larsen and Pierce – &quot;the little southpaw chatterbox&quot; – leading the team to the best record in the major leagues through early June. In a road game against the Reds on June 14, he allowed a leadoff double to Vada Pinson, but was then accidentally spiked in the left ankle while covering first base on a groundout by Don Blasingame, an injury which required 14 stitches. Pulled from the game after just of an inning, he took the loss when Pinson later scored and the Giants were shut out 8–0. The injury likely cost him what would have been his eighth All-Star selection, and he did not return to the field until he lasted only three innings in a loss on July 15; he then made three relief appearances before picking up a win on August 2. But over the course of the year he proved to be a pitcher who thrived in blustery Candlestick Park, winning all 11 of his home starts as the Giants tied the Dodgers for the NL pennant with a record of 101–61, forcing a three-game playoff. Against the Dodgers on August 11 he earned his 200th career victory, with McCovey&#x27;s three-run home run off eventual Cy Young winner Don Drysdale giving the Giants a 5–4 win and ending Drysdale&#x27;s 11-game win streak.

Pierce started the first game of the playoff against the Dodgers on October 1, opposing Sandy Koufax, and pushed his Candlestick record to 12–0 with a three-hit 8–0 victory in which only two Dodgers reached second base; he described it as &quot;the most satisfying game I ever pitched.&quot; Former NL umpire Babe Pinelli, watching from the press box, remarked, &quot;Look at him fire that fast one! He&#x27;s been in so many clutch games that they&#x27;re nothing to him!&quot; After the Dodgers tied the series in Game 2, he came back in Game 3 on October 3 to pitch the ninth inning with a 6–4 lead, and retired all three batters he faced to clinch the Giants&#x27; first pennant in San Francisco, being mobbed by his teammates upon the final out. Against the Yankees in the World Series, he started Game 3, and went into the bottom of the seventh inning with no score; but he allowed three runs in the seventh inning (one of them unearned after two outfield errors), and took the 3–2 loss. He came back with another brilliant outing in Game 6 at Candlestick Park against Whitey Ford, not allowing a baserunner until the fifth inning and finishing with a three-hit 5–2 victory to tie the Series at three games each; he only allowed three runners to reach second base, and only went to a three-ball count four times. Although his two Series appearances both came after his peak years were behind him, Pierce posted a career Series ERA of 1.89 in 19 innings.

====Last seasons====
Given his brilliance in home games in 1962, it was no surprise that Pierce was chosen to start the Giants&#x27; home opener in 1963, and he responded with the last shutout of his career – a 7–0 win over the Houston Colt .45s. He achieved his Candlestick success despite often discarding one of his primary pitches, the low curve, saying, &quot;How many left-handers come into this park and win with that pitch on a windy afternoon?&quot; He instead altered the location of his pitches, throwing outside to left-handers to get them to hit to left field, taking advantage of the wind which kept the ball in the air longer; two-time AL batting champion Pete Runnels observed that Pierce pitched to him completely differently upon changing leagues. His home win streak ended in his next start on April 20, a 4–0 loss to the Chicago Cubs; he gradually moved to the bullpen over the course of the 1963 season, and was used almost exclusively in relief in 1964. On September 10, 1964, against the Dodgers, in what was later called &quot;Billy the Kid&#x27;s last fight,&quot; he made his first start in over a year and the last of his career, pitching innings and gaining a 5–1 win. He made one more appearance in relief on October 3, falling one strikeout short of 2,000, and announced his retirement the next day as the season came to an end. In an 18-season career, Pierce posted a 211–169 record with a 3.27 ERA in innings; only twice (1948 and 1963) did he post an ERA of 4.00 or higher, and never in a season of at least 100 innings. He completed 193 of his 432 starts, including 38 shutouts, and also had 32 saves among his 585 total games pitched. His 186 career victories with the White Sox rank fourth on the club&#x27;s all-time list, behind Hall of Famers Ted Lyons, Red Faber and Ed Walsh. His White Sox record of 456 career games by a left-hander was broken by Wilbur Wood in 1974.

Listed at 5 ft 10 in (1.78 m) and 160 pounds (73 kg), Pierce was also among the more diminutive pitchers to enjoy great success, and is likely the smallest pitcher since the 1920s to win 200 games. Sherm Lollar, his catcher for ten years in Chicago, noted that his lack of size didn&#x27;t diminish his velocity, noting, &quot;He isn&#x27;t too big, but he has wonderful coordination. And he sure is pretty to watch, the way he pumps and rocks and throws. Sometimes, when I&#x27;m not catching a game, I&#x27;ll just go off to one side and watch him pitch.&quot; And Paul Richards noted, &quot;Pierce is a perfectionist who has achieved maximum potential out of the equipment nature gave him.&quot; Pierce&#x27;s size also belied his durability, as he was one of the few pitchers under in height to lead the league in complete games since the 1920s, with Ned Garver, Frank Lary, Camilo Pascual and Fernando Valenzuela – all of whom were an inch taller and outweighed Pierce by at least 20 pounds – being the only other pitchers under six feet tall to lead the league more than once since the early 1930s. He remains the last pitcher to lead the AL in complete games three years in a row.

==Retirement==

Through the 1950s, Pierce generally spent the offseason helping his father run the family&#x27;s Detroit pharmacy. He did not pursue a coaching career, even though a 1963 spring training poll of sportswriters had named him the top managerial prospect on the Giants. After leaving baseball, he was a White Sox television color analyst in 1970, briefly a partner in Oldsmobile and Cadillac dealerships, a stockbroker, then worked as a sales and public relations representative for the Continental Envelope company from 1974 until retiring in 1997. He also worked as a White Sox scout, discovering 1983 Rookie of the Year Ron Kittle. The White Sox retired his number 19 in 1987; he is one of only eight players so honored. He was named to the Sox Team of the Century in 2000, and was inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2003. On October 4, 2005, Pierce threw out the first pitch before Game 1 of the AL Division Series against the Red Sox (a 14–2 win), as the White Sox began the postseason which culminated in the 2005 World Series title – their first championship in 88 years. In 2006, he was inducted into the Chicagoland Sports Hall of Fame.
On July 23, 2007, the White Sox unveiled a statue in Pierce&#x27;s honor in the center field concourse of U.S. Cellular Field, joining likenesses of Charles Comiskey, Minnie Miñoso, Carlton Fisk, Luis Aparicio and Nellie Fox. Sculptors had borrowed photographs and measured his face, leading him to comment, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why; it isn&#x27;t the same measurement it was in the &#x27;50s.&quot; Adding that he hoped statues of Hall of Fame shortstop Luke Appling and pitcher Ted Lyons – both stars of the 1930s and 1940s – might be added in the future, he nonetheless admitted his excitement over the honor, saying, &quot;I think of it more, in times to come, when my grandkids go out to the park, they&#x27;ll see it. It&#x27;s going to be there for years.&quot; The book &quot;&quot;Then Ozzie Said to Harold...&quot;: The Best Chicago White Sox Stories Ever Told&quot;, coauthored by Pierce, was published in March 2008.

Pierce married Gloria McCreadie, who he had dated since high school, on October 22, 1949, and they have three children, William Reed (born July 6, 1953), Patricia &quot;Patti&quot; Crowley (born October 4, 1955) and Robert Walter (born July 16, 1958). Pierce told one interviewer of his wife, &quot;She&#x27;s not only a loyal fan, but a smart one, and there was the day I had to go to Marty Marion – he was the White Sox manager then – and tell him that he&#x27;d better change our bunt sign because Gloria had stolen it, so very likely the opposition would be stealing it too.&quot; Although he had by then been traded to the Giants, following the 1962 season they relocated from Birmingham, Michigan to the southwest Chicago suburb of Evergreen Park. (For several years while he was with the White Sox, they had also maintained a summer residence in the south side&#x27;s landmark Flamingo-on-the-Lake Apartments, where teammate Jim Rivera and his family also lived.) He remained a member of the White Sox community relations department into his late 80s, making frequent public appearances in the Chicago area. In addition, beginning in 1993 he headed the not-for-profit Chicago Baseball Cancer Charities, a cause he began supporting after Nellie Fox&#x27;s death in 1975 at age 47. On June 29, 2013, the White Sox gave out souvenir statuettes of Pierce to fans at that day&#x27;s game against the Cleveland Indians, and he threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Pierce died in Palos Heights, Illinois, on July 31, 2015, at the age of 88 from gallbladder cancer. Pierce was a 33rd Degree Mason of Evergreen Park Lodge; his funeral was held at Evergreen Park Presbyterian Church, and he was entombed in Chapel Hill Gardens South Cemetery in Oak Lawn, Illinois.

==Hall of Fame candidacy==
Pierce has not been elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame (as of 2024). In the five years he was on the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America ballot (1970–1974), Pierce never drew more than 1.9% of the votes cast. However, in October 2014 he was selected for the first time by the BBWAA&#x27;s overview committee to be one of ten candidates on the Golden Era Committee ballot for possible induction in 2015. He and the other candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie Miñoso, all fell short of selection. On November 5, 2021, he was selected to the final ballot for the National Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Golden Days Era ballot for consideration for the Class of 2022, but received three votes or less of the necessary twelve votes.

<doc id="911371" wikidata="Q312690" url="?curid=911371" title="Kosuke Kitajima">
<text>is a Japanese retired breaststroke swimmer. He won gold medals at the men&#x27;s 100 m and 200 m breaststroke events at the 2004 Summer Olympics, and the 2008 Summer Olympics – becoming the first and only swimmer to sweep the breaststroke events at consecutive Olympic games.

==Major achievements==
Kitajima, who was born in Tokyo, was the world record holder in the 100 m breaststroke that he set at the 2008 Beijing Olympics – this mark was broken by Brenton Rickard. He was also bronze medal winner in the same Olympics in the 4×100 m medley relay. He edged out his main rival Brendan Hansen who finished fourth while Kitajima won the gold medal and set the new world record.

He received four gold medals, one silver and two bronze medals in total at the 2004, 2008 and 2012 Olympics.

His most significant rival in the breaststroke was the American swimmer Brendan Hansen. They dueled at events such as the 2005 World Championships, 2004 Summer Olympics and 2003 World Championships. Kitajima set both world records for 100 m and 200 m breaststroke in the latter occasion. Later his best in 200 m was overcome by Dimitri Komornikov and then by Hansen, who also broke Kitajima&#x27;s record in the 100 m. Kitajima regained the world record (58.91) in the 100 m at the 2008 Summer Olympics. Kitajima regained the 200 m breaststroke world record in June 2008 at the Japan Open. His time of 2:07.51 shaved nearly a second off the previous record of 2:08.50 set by Hansen in 2006.

During the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Kitajima generated buzz for his primal screams of exuberance after edging out Hansen in the 100 m and 200 m breaststroke for the gold. At a pool side interview (3&#x27;24&quot;) following his victory in the 100 m, Kosuke Kitajima also popularised the phrase &#x27;cho-kimochi-ii,&#x27; meaning &quot;I feel really good.&quot; The word went on to win the 2004 U-Can Neologisms and Vogue Words contest.

During his gold medal-winning 100 m breaststroke race at the 2004 Olympics, he used an illegal dolphin kick on a pull-out, although he was not disqualified, and the rules were changed less than one year later to allow a single dolphin kick after the start and after each turn.

Kitajima retired in April 2016 after missing qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. He was attempting to qualify for his fifth Olympics.

==Personal bests==
In long course swimming pools Kitajima&#x27;s bests are:

* 50 m breaststroke: 27.30 (13 April 2010)
* 100 m breaststroke: 58.90 (3 April 2012)
* 200 m breaststroke: 2:07.51 (8 June 2008)

<doc id="911372" wikidata="Q2140453" url="?curid=911372" title="Street theatre">
<text>Street theatre is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in outdoor public spaces without a specific paying audience. These spaces can be anywhere, including shopping centres, car parks, recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. Performers range from buskers to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance spaces, promote their mainstream work, or are commissioned for events such as street festivals, children&#x27;s shows, or parades. 

The logistics of doing street theatre necessitate simple costumes and props, and often there is little or no amplification of sound, with actors depending on their natural vocal and physical ability. This issue with sound has meant that physical theatre, including dance, mime and slapstick, is a very popular genre in an outdoor setting. The performances need to be highly visible, loud and simple to follow in order to attract a crowd.

Street theatre should be distinguished from other more formal outdoor theatrical performances, such as performances in a park or garden, where there is a discrete space set aside (or roped off) and a ticketed audience.

In some cases, street theatre performers have to get a licence or specific permission through local or state governments in order to perform. Many performers travel internationally to certain locations of note.

Street theatre is arguably the oldest form of theatre in existence: most mainstream entertainment mediums can be traced back to origins in street performing, including religious passion plays and many other forms. More recently performers who, a hundred years ago, would have made their living working in variety theatres, music halls and in vaudeville, now often perform professionally in the many well-known street performance areas throughout the world. Notable performers that began their careers as street theatre performers include Robin Williams, David Bowie, Jewel and Harry Anderson.

Street theatre is a way to make traditional theatre accessible for those who may not be able to otherwise attend or afford tickets. The audience typically consists of anyone and everyone who wants to watch and for most performances is free public entertainment.

==Reasons for staging work on the street==

Performance artists with an interest in social activism may choose to stage their work on the street as a means of directly confronting or engaging the public. For example, multimedia artist Caeser Pink and his group of performers known as The Imperial Orgy staged a piece titled &quot;Our Daily Bread&quot; that brought performers onto the streets of the New York&#x27;s financial district to ceremoniously lay loaves of Wonder Bread along the sidewalks, each with an advertisement from Satan offering to buy people&#x27;s souls in exchange for material possessions. The performance caused an uproar when police were called out and bomb-sniffing dogs were brought in to inspect the loaves of bread for explosives.

Other artists consider a paying, theatre-going public to be unrepresentative of the public to whom they are trying to communicate, and performing to &#x27;the man on the street&#x27; may be considered a more democratic form of dissemination.

Some contemporary street theatre practitioners have extensively studied pre-existing street and popular theatre traditions, such as Carnival, commedia dell&#x27;arte etc. and wish to present them in a situation close to their original context.

Whatever the reason for choosing the street, the street is a place with a different set of possibilities than the conventional theatre space. Sue Gill of Welfare State International argues that a street theatre performance is not a lesser form than an indoor performance, nor is it simply taking what you do on stage and placing it outdoors, but a form with an energy and an integrity of its own.
Many companies are politically motivated and use street theatre to combine performance with protest. This has occurred through the guerrilla theatre of San Francisco Mime Troupe, The Living Theatre, the carnivalesque parades of Bread and Puppet Theatre, and the work of Ashesh Malla and the Sarwanam Theatre Group of Nepal.

A character-based street theatre which developed in the 1960s and 1970s was developed by groups like Lumiere and Son, John Bull Puncture Repair Kit, Exploded Eye and Natural Theatre Company. The performances were unannounced and featured characters who acted out a pre-arranged scenario, looking beautiful or surreal or simply just involving passers by in conversation. They did not seek to trick in a &quot;Candid Camera&quot; way, but rather invited the audience to pretend along with them. No amount of planning or rehearsal could dictate what would happen.

Another example would be Natural Theatre&#x27;s Pink Suitcase scenario. A number of smartly dressed people carrying bright pink suitcases enter a set of streets or buildings. They search for and miss their companions. In their search they get on buses, hail cabs, end up in shop windows, etc. By the time they meet up at a pre-arranged spot with the help of passers-by, perceptions of the area have changed and shopping has ceased for at least a few moments. The humour is universal and this piece has been seen in nearly seventy countries. It is usually performed by four or five actors, but has been done with twenty-five.

==Interactive street theatre==
Interactive street theatre is a combination of two separate art forms, street theatre and interactive art.

Unlike other interactive art, the presentation of interactive street theatre is outside in a public place and most of the time at festivals. The audience of interactive street theatre consists of passers-by who stop to participate on a voluntary basis. The nature of this type of performance is temporary, generally lasting only a few hours, and is considered much more accessible and easier to participate in than in a gallery or a museum, as those who might not have ever been to a theatre or museum can participate in interactive street theatre.

Some interactive art installations allow visitors to walk in, on, and around them, or allow them to play with the object of the installations. Another way interactive theatre is done is that spectators themselves become part of the artwork. There are also types of interactive street theatre where that spectator becomes an active part of the show and works together with the artist to create a magnificent collective art piece.

===Peru===
In Peru, interactive street theatre was used to raise awareness of the many misconceptions of family planning and use of contraceptives. The play &quot;Ms. Rumors&quot; was performed as a means of promoting a much greater understanding of information regarding contraceptives and planned parenthood. The play told the audience the truth about contraceptives through the character of a pharmacist, which in turn contradicted the false claims that the character Ms.Rumors suggested. The play lasted around four months and was around twenty minutes long. The performance was followed by a forum to discuss any questions the audience had about parent planning, which worked better than private counselling since people would have the support of their peers, and the answers would educate the entire group. The play &quot;Ms. Rumors&quot; focused on the information that is usually misrepresented regarding birth control pills or &quot;the pill&quot;. One of the rumours about birth control pills is that they can cause side effects such as cancer, which is false. The public play was placed in the city plazas and also outside of hospitals and clinics where people are possibly going to receive information regarding parent planning and contraceptives. The significance of this play was that it promoted safe sex information that protects against unwanted pregnancies or sexually transmitted diseases that can be caused by unprotected sex. It educated the public on misinformation such as condoms being uncomfortable, contraceptives causing abortions, and many other misconceptions that were made up due to lack of knowledge on contraceptives and family planning.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, interactive street theater was used to raise awareness to health causes such as AIDS or HIV and how certain behaviours promote the increase of the virus. Puppet shows were performed in the streets to educate the public of how deadly contracting aids or HIV virus is. The show consisted of the main character having aids and transmitting the disease to others, which ultimately led to the death of the character and the transmission of it to other people as well. Having these performances played in public will raise awareness to the deadly virus, that many people may not have had knowledge of. It educated the audience about risks, and how to avoid them with safer behaviours they could do to prevent contracting the virus. It also educated the viewers on different, and much safer behaviours to use in order to stop transmitting the virus to others. This awareness could work to increase the knowledge of the virus, and educate the public on methods to decrease the transmutation of the disease.

<doc id="911377" wikidata="Q7547731" url="?curid=911377" title="Snickerdoodle">
<text>A snickerdoodle is a type of cookie made with flour, fat, sugar, and salt, and rolled in cinnamon sugar. Eggs may also sometimes be used as an ingredient, with cream of tartar and baking soda added to leaven the dough. Snickerdoodles are characterized by a cracked surface and can be either crisp or soft depending on the ingredients used.

Snickerdoodles are often referred to as &quot;sugar cookies&quot;. However, traditional sugar cookies are often rolled in white sugar whereas snickerdoodles are rolled in a mixture of white sugar and cinnamon. Cream of tartar is added for its signature texture as another main difference.

== Etymology ==
&quot; Joy of Cooking&quot; claims that snickerdoodles are probably German in origin, and that the name is a corruption of the German word &quot;Schneckennudel&quot;, a Palatine variety of &quot;Schnecken&quot;. It is also possible that the name is simply a nonsense word with no particular meaning, originating from a New England tradition of whimsical cookie names. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; claims the word&#x27;s origin is &quot;uncertain&quot;, and possibly a portmanteau of the word &quot;&quot;, an onomatopoeic English word with Scottish roots that indicates a &quot;smothered laugh&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, a German loanword into English meaning a &quot;simple or foolish fellow&quot;, originally derived from the Low German &quot;dudeltopf&quot;, meaning &quot;simpleton, noodle, night-cap&quot;. The earliest use of the word recorded by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from 1889.

== Ingredients ==

Snickerdoodles have traditionally been made with a blend of shortening and butter. Some updated modern recipes have replaced shortening (a hydrogenated fat) with different varieties of oil. Before being baked, the cookie dough balls are rolled in cinnamon sugar which can vary the intensity of cinnamon flavor, with some recipes using a 1:1 ratio of cinnamon to sugar. The process of making the cookie dough is similar to many other cookies; first the fat and sugar are creamed together until pale and fluffy, then an egg is whisked in, and the flour is added last.
Some recipes recommend using cream of tartar as the raising agent, rather than baking soda, to give the cookie an extra tangy taste.
Once the dough is mixed, it is divided into equal portions and each portion is rolled by hand to make a ball. Then each ball is rolled in a mixture of sugar and cinnamon. The spiced and sugared balls are then placed on baking paper on a baking tray, spaced well apart to allow for the ball to spread as it cooks, slightly candying the sugar and spice coating.

== Food trends ==
The cookie is common to Mennonite and Amish communities and was a favorite treat of the Indiana poet James Whitcomb Riley.

In more recent times, the snickerdoodle cookie has transformed into a popular flavor of desserts, sugary sweets, drinks, candies, etc. For example, General Mills created a snickerdoodle flavored Chex Mix Muddy Buddies to their snack line. During the 2014 holiday season, Dunkin&#x27; Donuts unveiled a snickerdoodle cookie latte on their holiday menu. In addition to a snickerdoodle latte, Nestlé Coffee-Mate introduced their take on the cookie in the form of a coffee creamer. Brands such as Braum&#x27;s Ice Cream and Prairie Farms have dedicated an ice cream flavor to the popular cookie.

<doc id="911380" wikidata="Q4121506" url="?curid=911380" title="The Sworn Book of Honorius">
<text>The Sworn Book of Honorius (, also &quot;Liber sacer&quot;, &quot;sacratus&quot; or &quot;consecratus&quot;) is a medieval grimoire purportedly written by Honorius of Thebes. The Latin word &quot;juratus&quot;, which is typically translated &quot;sworn&quot;, is intended to mean &quot;oathbound&quot;. Its name comes from the alleged compiler Honorius of Thebes, son of Euclid.

The book is one of the oldest existing medieval grimoires as well as one of the most influential.

==Historical references==
Its date of composition is uncertain, but it is possibly mentioned as &quot;Liber Sacer&quot; in the 13th century, apparently asserting a date in the High Middle Ages. The first certain historical record is the 1347 trial record of Étienne Pépin from Mende, Gévaudan, in the Kingdoms of France and Navarre. Johannes Hartlieb (1456) mentions it as one of the books used in necromancy. The oldest preserved manuscript dates to the 14th century, Sloane MS 3854 (fol 117-144). Sloane MS 313, dating to the late 14th or early 15th century, was once in the possession of John Dee.

The first printed manuscript of this work did not appear until 1629.

==Content==

The &quot;Sworn Book&quot; is supposedly the product of a conference of magicians who decided to condense all of their knowledge into one volume. In 93 chapters, it covers a large variety of topics, from how to save one&#x27;s soul from purgatory to catching thieves or finding treasures. It has many instructions on how to conjure and command demons, to work other magical operations and knowledge of what lies in Heaven among other highly sought information. Like many grimoires, it has lengthy dissertations for proper operation and seals to be used.

The author says, &quot;I, Honorius, have laid out the works of Solomon in such a manner in my book,&quot; indicating that his sourcebooks are (falsely) attributed to Solomon. The &quot;Sworn Book&quot; features the Seal of Solomon and contains ritual elements which are characteristic of the Pseudo-Solomonic corpus of magical literature. Indeed, the so-called &quot;northern European&quot; or &quot;London&quot; version of the &quot;Sworn Book&quot; uses prayers from the glossed version of the &quot;Notory Art&quot; (Ars Notoria), a medieval treatise on angelic magic attributed to King Solomon. 

Berengario Ganell&#x27;s version of the &quot;Sworn Book&quot;, contained within his &quot;Best of the Sacred Magic&quot; (&quot;Summa Sacrae Magicae&quot;), uses the fifty-one prayers from the little prayer book called &quot;The Book of Three Souls&quot; (&quot;Liber Trium Animarum&quot;) rather than those found in the &quot;Notory Art&quot;. 

==Author==
The purported author, Honorius of Thebes, is a possibly mythical character from the Middle Ages. Considerable mystery still exists about the identity of Honorius. Honorius of Thebes is also claimed to be the creator of the Theban alphabet, in Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;De Occulta Philosophia&quot; (1533) and Johannes Trithemius&#x27;s &quot;Polygraphia&quot; (1518).

According to the &quot;Sworn Book of Honorius&quot;, he is supposed to be &quot;the son of Euclid, master of the Thebians&quot;. The book, however, provides little elucidation as to who this might be; no sources to substantiate the claim are given. The reader might assume that Thebes in Greece is intended, but no better context can be inferred.

<doc id="911396" wikidata="Q2296926" url="?curid=911396" title="Force-feeding">
<text>Force-feeding is the practice of feeding a human or animal against their will. The term gavage (, , ) refers to supplying a substance by means of a small plastic feeding tube passed through the nose (nasogastric) or mouth (orogastric) into the stomach.

== Of humans ==

=== In psychiatric settings ===
Within some countries, in extreme cases, patients with anorexia nervosa who continually refuse significant dietary intake and weight restoration interventions may be involuntarily fed by force via nasogastric tube under restraint within specialist psychiatric hospitals. Such a practice may be highly distressing for both anorexia patients and healthcare staff.

=== In prisons ===
Some countries force-feed prisoners when they go on hunger strike. It has been prohibited since 1975 by the Declaration of Tokyo of the World Medical Association, provided that the prisoner is &quot;capable of forming an unimpaired and rational judgment.&quot; The violation of this prohibition may be carried out in a manner that can be categorised as torture, as it may be extremely painful and result in severe bleeding and spreading of various diseases via the exchanged blood and mucus, especially when conducted with dirty equipment on a prison population.

====Canada====
The Canadian government rejects the Declaration of Tokyo as made by the World Medical Association, and carries out the force-feeding of inmates against their will who reject any nourishment.

==== China ====
Uyghur Muslim prisoners in detention centers and internment camps have been reported to have been force-fed pork in direct contravention of their religious restrictions on the consumption of pork.

====United Kingdom====
Suffragettes who had been imprisoned while campaigning for votes for women went on hunger strike and were force fed. This lasted until the Prisoners Act of 1913, also known as the Cat and Mouse Act, whereby debilitated prisoners would be released, allowed to recover, and then re-arrested. Rubber tubes were inserted through the mouth (only occasionally through the nose) and into the stomach, and food poured down; the suffragettes were held down by force while the instruments were inserted into their bodies, which has been likened to rape. In a smuggled letter, Sylvia Pankhurst described how the warders held her down and forced her mouth open with a steel gag. Her gums bled, and she vomited most of the liquid.

Emmeline Pankhurst, founder of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union, was horrified by the screams of women being force-fed in HM Prison Holloway. She wrote: &quot;Holloway became a place of horror and torment. Sickening scenes of violence took place almost every hour of the day, as the doctors went from cell to cell performing their hideous office. ...I shall never while I live forget the suffering I experienced during the days when those cries were ringing in my ears.&quot; When prison officials tried to enter her cell, Pankhurst, in order to avoid being force-fed, raised a clay jug over her head and announced: &quot;If any of you dares so much as to take one step inside this cell, I shall defend myself.&quot;

In 1911, Wiliam Ball, a male working class supporter who had broken two windows and consequently been sentenced to two months, was given this treatment and then separated from contact with his family, leading to his clandestine transfer to a mental hospital. This case was taken up by groups such as WSPU and the Men&#x27;s League for Women&#x27;s Suffrage, whose pamphlet on the case had the subtitle &quot;Official Brutality on the increase.&quot;
The first woman in Scotland to be force fed was Ethel Moorhead, in Calton Jail, who despite being under medical supervision became seriously ill. The governor, Major William Stewart, argued that her illness was not caused by the feeding regime, but also said: We must face the fact that artificial feeding is attended with risk and we must teach [suffragette prisoners] that, while we appreciate the risks, we are quite prepared to go on and will not be deterred from detaining people like [Moorhead] because there is a risk to their health, if we take the necessary steps to make sure their detention is effective... They have the idea that they can frighten us by pointing out the risk to health.

But the governor also recognised that there was a risk of the public deciding that prison authorities were &quot;going too far&quot;. After Moorhead&#x27;s release, the WPSU published a handbill, &quot;Scotland Disgraced and Dishonoured&quot;, with Moorhead describing her experience being fed by force:
The tube filled up all my breathing space, I couldn&#x27;t breathe. The young man began pouring in the liquid food.

I heard the noises I was making of choking and suffocationuncouth noises human beings are not intended to make and which might be made by a vivisected dog. Still he kept on pouring.

In 1914, Frances Parker, another Scottish suffragette, was being force-fed by the rectum (a nutrient enema, a standard procedure before the invention of intravenous therapy) and once by the vagina in the Perth prison:

Djuna Barnes, an American journalist, agreed to submit to force-feeding for a 1914 &quot;New York World&quot; magazine article. Barnes wrote, &quot;If I, play acting, felt my being burning with revolt at this brutal usurpation of my own functions, how they who actually suffered the ordeal in its acutest horror must have flamed at the violation of the sanctuaries of their spirits.&quot; She concluded, &quot;I had shared the greatest experience of the bravest of my sex.&quot;

Authorities within the United Kingdom used forcible feeding techniques against Irish Republicans during their struggle for independence. In 1917 the Irish republican leader Thomas Ashe died as a result of complications from such a feeding while incarcerated at Dublin&#x27;s Mountjoy Jail. In 1973 four Irish Republican prisoners were force fed over a 200-day period. Gerry Kelly, Hugh Feeney and sisters Dolours and Marian Price were force-fed while on hunger strike in separate British prisons. In 1974 two Irish Republican Army members (Michael Gaughan (Irish republican) and Frank Stagg (Irish republican) were force-fed while on hunger strike. Gaughan was subjected to 17 force-feedings during a hunger strike in HM Prison Wakefield, England. Gaughan had demanded repatriation to Ireland, an end to solitary confinement and no prison work. The force-feeding procedure was described: &quot;Six to eight guards would restrain the prisoner and drag him or her by the hair to the top of the bed, where they would stretch the prisoner’s neck over the metal rail, force a block between his or her teeth and then pass a feeding tube, which extended down the throat, through a hole in the block.&quot; In 1974 Frank Stagg was force-fed for 68 days and survived but died on another hunger strike in 1976.

====United States====

Ethel Byrne was the first female political prisoner in the United States to be subjected to force feeding after she was jailed at Blackwell Island workhouse on January 22, 1917, for her activism in advocating for the legalization of birth control. She subsequently went on a hunger strike and refused to drink water for 185 hours.
Under United States jurisdiction, force-feeding is frequently used in the U.S. military prison in Guantanamo Bay, prompting in March 2006 an open letter by 250 doctors in &quot;The Lancet&quot;, warning that the participation of any doctor is contrary to the rules of the World Medical Association.

In the 2009 case &quot;Lantz v. Coleman&quot;, the Connecticut Superior Court authorized the state Department of Correction to force-feed a competent prisoner who had refused to eat voluntarily. In 2009, terrorist Richard Reid, known as the &quot;shoe bomber,&quot; was force-fed while on a hunger strike at the United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX, the federal supermax prison in Colorado. Hundreds of force-feedings have been reported at ADX Florence.

Forced feeding has also been used by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement against detained asylum seekers on hunger strike. In February 2019, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights expressed that such treatment of detainees could constitute a breach of the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Associated Press quoted one 22-year old asylum seeker who alleged that &quot;he was dragged from his cell three times a day and strapped down on a bed as a group of people poured liquid into tubes inserted into his nose.&quot;

====Soviet Union====

Soviet dissident Vladimir Bukovsky described how he was force-fed: 

&quot;The unfortunate patients had their mouth clamped shut, had a rubber tube inserted into their mouth or nostril. They keep on pressing it down until it reaches your esophagus. A funnel is attached to the other end of the tube and a cabbage-like mixture poured down the tube and through to the stomach. This was an unhealthy practice, as the food might have gone into their lungs and caused pneumonia.&quot;

==== United Nations War Crimes Tribunal ====
On December 6, 2006, the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal at The Hague approved the use of force-feeding of Serbian politician Vojislav Šešelj. They decided it was not &quot;torture, inhuman or degrading treatment if there is a medical necessity to do so... and if the manner in which the detainee is force-fed is not inhuman or degrading.&quot;

====Israel====
In 2015, the Knesset passed a law allowing the force-feeding of prisoners in response to a hunger strike by a Palestinian detainee who had been held for months in administrative detention. Israeli doctors refused to feed Mohammad Allan against his will, and he resumed eating after the Supreme Court temporarily released him.

====Greece====
Forced feeding has been ordered by Greek courts against hunger strikes at different times including in 2021 when a Greek prosecutor proposed the force-feeding of Dimitris Koufontinas in the effort of stopping Koufontinas&#x27;s 65 day hunger and water strike which started in February 2021. The doctors of the hospital of Lamia, where Koufodinas was hospitalised refused to administer force feeding procedures, a Greek doctors&#x27; union has called the practice torture. A similar situation played out in 2014 when 21 year old convicted anarchist bank robber and childhood friend of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, Nikos Romanos who engaged in a hunger-strike for access to education which lead to a force-feeding being ordered. Romanos successfully resisted the force-feeding order with the help of his doctors. Romanos terminated his hunger-thirst strike after 30 days having won access to a university education.

====Other forms====
Force-feeding of pernicious substances may be used as a form of torture and/or physical punishment. While in prison in northern Bosnia in 1996, some Serbian prisoners have described being forced to eat paper and soap.

Sometimes it has been alleged that prisoners are forced to eat foods forbidden by their religion. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; has reported that Muslim prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison under the U.S.-led coalition described in sworn statements having been forced to eat pork and drink alcohol, both of which are strictly forbidden in Islam (see Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse).

===Of babies===

According to &quot;Infant feeding by artificial means: a scientific and practical treatise on the dietetics of infancy&quot;, a French system of feeding newborn or premature babies who could not suckle was known as &quot;gavage&quot;. Sadler dates its origin to 1874 and quotes Étienne Stéphane Tarnier, a pioneer perinatologist, describing the procedure. 
 Nowadays, infants in a neonatal intensive care unit are likely to be fed by nasogastric or sometimes orogastric tubes.

===For girls before marriage===

Force-feeding used to be practiced in North Africa and still is in Mauritania. Fatness was considered a marriage asset in women; culturally, voluptuous figures were perceived as indicators of wealth. In this tradition, some girls are forced by their mothers or grandmothers to overeat, often accompanied by physical punishment (e.g., pressing a finger between two pieces of wood) should the girl not eat. The intended result is a rapid onset of obesity, and the practice may start at a young age and continue for years. This is still the tradition in the rather undernourished Sahel country Mauritania (where it is called leblouh), where it induces major health risks in the female population; some younger men no longer insist on voluptuous brides, but traditional beauty norms remain part of the culture.

===In slavery===
Some Africans on the Middle Passage journey to slavery in the United States tried to take their own lives by starving themselves, and were force fed with a contraption called the &quot;speculum orum&quot;. This device forced the slave&#x27;s mouth open in order to be fed.

== Of domestic animals ==

Force-feeding has been used to prepare animals for slaughter. In some cases, such as is the case with ducks and geese raised for foie gras and peking duck, it is still practiced today.

=== In farming ===
Force-feeding is also known as gavage, from the verbal noun form of the French verb &quot;gaver&quot; meaning &quot;to gorge&quot;. This term specifically refers to force-feeding of ducks or geese in order to fatten their livers in the production of foie gras.

Force-feeding of birds is practiced mostly on geese or male Moulard ducks, a Muscovy/Pekin hybrid. Preparation for gavage usually begins four to five months before slaughter. For geese, after an initial free-range period and treatment to assist in esophagus dilation (eating grass, for example), the force-feeding commences. Gavage is performed two to four times a day for two to five weeks, depending on the size of the fowl, using a funnel attached to a slim metal or plastic feeding tube inserted into the bird&#x27;s throat to deposit the food into the bird&#x27;s crop (the storage area in the esophagus). A grain mash, usually maize mixed with fats and vitamin supplements, is the feed of choice. Waterfowl are suited to the tube method due to a non-existent gag reflex and an extremely flexible esophagus, unlike other fowl such as chickens. These migratory waterfowl are also said to be ideal for gavage because of their natural ability to gain large amounts of weight in short periods of time before cold seasons.

In modern Egypt, the practice of fattening geese and male Muscovy ducks by force-feeding them various grains is present, unrelated to foie gras production, but for general consumption. This is done by hand rather than by tube, as is European force-feeding. However, this practice is not widespread on commercial farms, and is done mostly by individuals. The term used for this is &quot;tazġīṭ&quot; (), from the verb &quot;zaġġaṭ(a)&quot; ().

Shen Dzu is a similar practice of force-feeding pigs.

===In scientific research===
Gavage is used in some scientific studies such as those involving the rate of metabolism. It is practiced upon various laboratory animals, such as mice. Liquids such as medicines may be administered to the animals via a tube or syringe.

<doc id="911407" wikidata="Q5435395" url="?curid=911407" title="Farl">
<text>A farl is any of various quadrant-shaped flatbreads and cakes, traditionally made by cutting a round into four pieces. In Ulster, the term generally refers to soda bread (soda farls) and, less commonly, potato bread (potato farls), which are also ingredients of an Ulster fry.

It is made as farls (that is to say, flat rounds about 3/4 inch thick which are then cut into quarters). Modern commercially mass-produced potato farls, however, are often rectangular in form.

In Scotland today, the word is used less than in Ulster, but a farl can be a quarter piece of a large flat scone, bannock, or oatcake. It may also be used for shortbread when baked in this particular shape.

==Etymology==
&quot;Farl&quot; is a shorter form of &quot;fardel&quot;, the word once used in some parts of Lowland Scotland for &quot;a three-cornered cake, usually oatcake, generally the fourth part of a round&quot;. In earlier Scots, meant a fourth or quarter.

==Method==
A farl is made by spreading the dough on a girdle or frying pan in a rough circular shape. The circle is then cut into four equal pieces and cooked. Once one side is done the dough is flipped to cook the other side.

<text>Japan competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Japanese athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games in the modern era since 1912 except for two editions; it was not invited to the 1948 Summer Olympics in London for its role in World War II, and was also part of the US-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The Japanese Olympic Committee sent a total of 306 athletes, 139 men and 167 women, to compete in 27 sports. For the first time in its Olympic history, Japan was represented by more female than male athletes.

Japan left Athens with a total of 37 medals (16 gold, 9 silver, and 12 bronze), finishing fifth in the overall medal rankings. This was also the nation&#x27;s most successful Olympics, winning the largest number of gold and overall medals in non-boycotting games and surpassing three gold medals short of the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne. Ten of these medals were awarded to the athletes in judo, eight in swimming, six in wrestling, four in gymnastics, and two each in athletics and synchronized swimming. Eight Japanese athletes won more than a single Olympic medal in Athens. Japan&#x27;s team-based athletes came strong and successful in Athens, as the baseball and softball teams managed to produce two bronze medals.

Among the nation&#x27;s medalists were freestyle wrestlers Saori Yoshida and Kaori Icho, who both claimed their gold medals in women&#x27;s wrestling for the first time, and judoka Tadahiro Nomura and Ryoko Tani, who both successfully defended Olympic titles in their respective classes. Swimmer Kosuke Kitajima became the most successful Japanese athlete in these games, striking a breaststroke double with two golds and adding a bronze to his career hardware for the team in men&#x27;s medley relay. Meanwhile, synchronized swimmers Miya Tachibana and Miho Takeda managed to repeat their silver medals from Sydney in both women&#x27;s duet and team routines. Takehiro Kashima, Hiroyuki Tomita, and Isao Yoneda claimed two individual medals each in men&#x27;s artistic gymnastics, including their coveted gold in the team all-around.

On August 29, 2004, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Hungary&#x27;s Adrián Annus hammer throw title after failing the doping test, and the gold medal was subsequently awarded to Koji Murofushi at the conclusion of the Games, making him the nation&#x27;s first ever Olympic champion in the field event.

Japanese athletes have so far achieved qualifying standards in the following athletics events (up to a maximum of 3 athletes in each event at the &#x27;A&#x27; Standard, and 1 at the &#x27;B&#x27; Standard). The team was selected based on the results of the 2004 Japan Championships in Athletics.

Koji Murofushi originally claimed a silver medal in men&#x27;s hammer throw. On August 29, 2004, the International Olympic Committee stripped off Hungary&#x27;s Adrián Annus hammer throw title after failing the doping test. Following the announcement of Annus&#x27; disqualification, Murofushi&#x27;s medal was eventually upgraded to gold.

<doc id="911430" wikidata="Q3179173" url="?curid=911430" title="Physical theatre">
<text>Physical theatre is a genre of theatrical performance that encompasses storytelling primarily through physical movement. Although several performance theatre disciplines are often described as &quot;physical theatre&quot;, the genre&#x27;s characteristic aspect is a reliance on the performers&#x27; physical motion rather than, or combined with, text to convey storytelling. Performers can communicate through various body gestures (including using the body to portray emotions).

==Common elements==
Certain institutions suggest that all physical theatre genres share common characteristics, although individual performances do not need to exhibit all such characteristics to be defined as physical theatre. Research into the training or &quot;work&quot; of physical theatre artists cites an amalgamation of numerous elements adopted as a means to further inform the theatrical research/production. These elements include:

* Inter-disciplinary origins, spanning music, dance, visual art, etc., as well as theatre
* Challenging the traditional, proscenium arch, and the traditional performer/audience relationship (also known as &quot;breaking the fourth wall&quot;).
* Encouraging audience participation, any interaction that occurs physically throughout the course of a performance.

Some practitioners, such as Lloyd Newson, despite being the first company to incorporate the term Physical Theater into his company&#x27;s title (DV8 Physical Theater), have expressed concern that the expression is now being used as a &quot;miscellaneous&quot; category, which includes anything that does not fall neatly into literary dramatic theater or contemporary dance. Newson is also frustrated that many companies and performers who describe what they do as physical theatre lack physical skills, training and/or expertise in movement. As such, contemporary theatre approaches (including post-modern performance, devised performance, visual performance, post-dramatic performance, etc.), while having their own distinct definitions, are often simply labelled &quot;physical theatre&quot; for no other reason than they are unusual in some way.

Dance that is of a theatrical nature can also be problematic. A dance piece may be called &quot;physical theatre&quot; simply because it includes elements of spoken word, character, or narrative. However, although it is theatrical and physical, it may not necessarily share anything in common with the physical theatre tradition.

==Modern physical theatre==

A modern physical theatre has grown from a variety of origins. Mime and theatrical clowning schools, such as L&#x27;École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq in Paris, have had a big influence on many modern expressions of physical theatre. Practitioners such as Steven Berkoff and John Wright received their initial training at such institutions. Contemporary dance has also had a strong influence on what we regard as physical theatre, partly because most physical theatre requires actors to have a certain level of physical control and flexibility. These qualities are rarely found in those who do not have some sort of movement background. Modern physical theatre also has strong roots in more ancient traditions such as &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;, and some suggest links to the ancient greek theatre, particularly the theatre of Aristophanes.

Another physical theatre tradition started with the French master Etienne Decroux (father of corporeal mime). Decroux&#x27;s aim was to create a theatre based on the physicality of the actor, allowing the creation of a more metaphorical theatre. This tradition has grown, and corporeal mime is now taught in many major theatrical schools.

Daniel Stein, a teacher out of the lineage of Etienne Decroux, has this to say about physical theatre:
&#x27;I think physical theatre is much more visceral and audiences are affected much more viscerally than intellectually. The foundation of theatre is a live, human experience, which is different from any other form of art that I know of. Live theatre, where real human beings are standing in front of real human beings, is about the fact that we have all set aside this hour; the sharing goes in both directions. The fact that it is a very physical, visceral form makes it a very different experience from almost anything else that we partake of in our lives. I don’t think we could do it the same way if we were doing literary-based theatre.&#x27; 
Arguably, the point at which physical theatre became distinct from pure mime is when Jean-Louis Barrault (a student of Decroux) rejected his teacher&#x27;s notion that the mime should be silent. If a mime uses their voice then they would have a whole range of possibilities open to them that previously would not have existed. This idea became known as &quot;Total Theatre&quot; and Barrault advocated that no theatrical element should assume primacy over another: movement, music, visual image, text etc. He viewed each element as equally important, and believed that each should be explored for their possibilities.

Barrault was a member of Michel Saint-Denis&#x27;s company, alongside Antonin Artaud. Artaud has also been highly influential in shaping what has become known as physical theatre. Artaud rejected the primacy of the text and suggested a theatre in which the proscenium arch is disposed of to have a more direct relationship with the audience.

Eastern theatre traditions have influenced some practitioners who have then influenced physical theatre. A number of Oriental traditions have a high level of physical training, and are visual masterpieces. The Japanese Noh tradition, in particular, has often been often upon. The energy and visual nature of Balinese theatre fascinated Antonin Artaud and he wrote extensively on it. Noh has been important for many practitioners including Lecoq, who based his neutral mask on the calm mask of Noh. Jerzy Grotowski, Peter Brook, Jacques Copeau and Joan Littlewood have all been consciously influenced by Noh. Alongside contemporary western practitioners, certain Japanese theatre practitioners were influenced by their own traditions. Tadashi Suzuki drew partly on Noh and his students and collaborators have disseminated his highly physical training into the west. This has particularly happened through Anne Bogart&#x27;s collaboration with him, and the simultaneous training of her actors in both the Viewpoints method and Suzuki training. As well as Suzuki, the Butoh Movement, which originated from Tatsumi Hijikata and Kazuo Ohno contained elements of Noh imagery and physicality. Butoh, again, has been influencing Western practitioners in recent years, and has certain similarities with Lecoq&#x27;s mime training in terms of ideas (impression and consequential embodiment of imagery, use of mask, etc.)

Besides a gradual infusion of ideas from outside the Western theatre tradition, influences have arisen from within in theatre as well starting with Konstantin Stanislavski. Later in life, Stanislavski began to reject his own ideas of naturalism, and started to pursue ideas relating to the physical body in performance. Meyerhold and Grotowski developed these ideas and began to develop actor training that included a very high level of physical training. Peter Brook influenced and developed this work.

Contemporary dance has added significantly to this mix, starting particularly with Rudolf von Laban. Laban developed a way of looking at movement outside codified dance, and was instrumental in envisioning and creating movement not just for dancers but for actors as well. Later on, the Tanzteater of Pina Bausch and others looked at the relationship between dance and theatre. In America, the postmodern dance movement of the Judson Church Dance also began to influence theatre practitioners, as their suggestions for movement and somatic training are equally accessible for those with dance training as those with theatre training. Indeed, Steve Paxton taught theatre students at Dartington College of Arts and other institutions.

<doc id="911449" wikidata="Q4570604" url="?curid=911449" title="Jarmann M1884">
<text>The Jarmann M1884 is a Norwegian bolt-action repeating rifle designed in 1878 adopted in 1884. The Jarmann&#x27;s adoption, and subsequent modifications, turned the Norwegian Army from a fighting force armed with single-shot black-powder weapons into a force armed with modern repeating weapons firing smokeless ammunition. Several thousand were manufactured to equip the Norwegian Armed Forces in the 1880s, and it also saw some, though very limited, use in Sweden. The design is unique, and was the brainchild of Norwegian engineer Jacob Smith Jarmann. After the design had been phased out of the Norwegian Army, a number of the weapons were rebuilt as harpoon guns.

==Description==
The Jarmann M1884 fired a 10.15 mm black powder cartridge in an 8-round, tubular magazine in which the rounds were lined up in a tube below the barrel. It has a non-rotating bolt (the part of the action that seals the rear end of the barrel) locked by a rotating bolt handle, and reputedly a smooth action. However, this action is not considered strong enough to fire modern ammunition, since the only locking is provided by the rotating bolt handle.

Jacob Smith Jarmann designed his first breech-loading rifle—firing cardboard cartridges—in 1838, but this was turned down by the armed forces at the time. The logic was that a rifle capable of firing 13 shots a minute would be impossible to resupply with enough ammunition. In the 1870s, he stepped down from the daily running of his workshop to work on his newly invented bolt-action rifle. According to the patent, three particulars were considered new and unique with the action he had developed:
*The extractor, which not only pulled the spent round out of the breech, but also served to limit the bolt&#x27;s rearward motion.
*The design of the rotating bolt handle, which served to lock the bolt to the receiver in the forward position.
*The way the extractor was secured to the body of the bolt.
Another interesting oddity is that the Jarmann action does not have a separate ejector, but instead relies on the fact that the extractor pushes the spent round down onto the elevator. The resulting friction was enough to safely eject the round from the receiver.

The design was first tested by a joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission. Their first tests were favorable but highlighted the desirability of a repeating weapon, that is, a weapon with a magazine. Several magazine-fed prototype rifles were built—Ole Herman Johannes Krag, the designer of the Krag–Petersson and the Krag–Jørgensen repeating rifles, designed two different magazines for the Jarmann rifle: one virtually identical to the magazine used on the Krag–Petersson, one which was the forerunner for the magazine he used on the Krag–Jørgensen. Jacob Smith Jarmann himself also made several prototypes, mainly with tubular magazines under the barrel or detachable magazines mounted sideways over the bolt. The latter was considered unusable in the field, and in the end a tubular magazine was selected for the weapon. The magazine is similar to the Kropatschek tubular magazine and may have been inspired by it, although it is just as possible that the magazine is inspired by the Krag–Petersson magazine.

Despite being a trailblazer with its then-pioneering design, the Jarmann M1884 cannot be considered successful. The combination of tubular magazine and centerfire ammunition has been referred to as &quot;too excitable&quot;, especially when used with pointed bullets. Also, the balance of the weapon changed with every shot fired. However, both of these issues are common to all firearms that use tubular magazines.

The first Jarmann design was firmly a single-shot weapon, and Jacob Smith Jarmann was reportedly at first unwilling to design a magazine for it. This may explain why the magazine and bolt do not always work well together.

The sights on the Jarmann M1884, as first issued, were graduated from 200 m to 1600 m. There was an additional sidemounted volley sight, intended for indirect volley fire over long distances, from 1600 m to 2400 m. To be effective, an entire company would have to fire at the same time, which would ensure that at least some of the bullets found their targets. During production, the sights were modified, and M1884s with serial numbers higher than 4330 also had a battle sight fitted to the backside of the sight leaf, which could be revealed by folding the leaf fully forward. The battle sight was set to a fixed range of about 430 m (470 yd), close to the maximum point-blank range of the weapon.

During testing to determine the correct graduation of the sights the rifle commission used improved ammunition, which increased the muzzle velocity to about 485 to 500 m/s.

==Ammunition==
The aforementioned Norwegian-Swedish commission also designed the 10.15 x 61R cartridge that the various prototypes as well as the service weapon were chambered for. Originally a black-powder round with a paper-wrapped lead bullet, it was later loaded with smokeless powder and a full metal jacket bullet. More than 5 million cartridges were manufactured for the M1884, in addition to several thousand specialty cartridges. The following different variations on the 10.15 x 61R cartridge have been identified:
*10.15 Ball, rounded tip, lead bullet wrapped in paper, black powder (possibly testing-only round)
*10.15 Ball, flat tip, lead bullet wrapped in paper, black powder
*10.15 Ball, flat tip, full metal jacket, smokeless powder
*10.15 Gallery, round lead bullet (for use indoors or at short ranges)
*10.15 Gallery, same as above but with a ring crimped around the neck of the case
*10.15 Blank, unpainted wooden &#x27;bullet&#x27;, smooth case
*10.15 Blank, same as above but with six long ridges pressed into the case
*10.15 Blank, same as above but with six long and six short ridges pressed into the case
*10.15 Dummy, red wooden &#x27;bullet&#x27; going all the way to the bottom of the case, six long and six short ridges pressed into the case, and two rings crimped around the neck of the case
*10.15 Dummy, as above but with just the six long ridges and rings around the neck
*10.15 Dummy, as above but with brown wooden &#x27;bullet&#x27; and two rings crimped around the neck of the case (tests only).
*10.15 Harpoon round, a blank round crimped shut, used only in the M28 harpoon gun
*10.15 Harpoon round, as above but closed with a crimped lid

==Accuracy==
The Jarmann rifle was a remarkably accurate rifle for its time. In 1886, the joint Norwegian-Swedish rifle commission, which had selected the Jarmann, created a list of the ballistic properties of all the rifles tested. It is clear from the list, reproduced below, that the Jarmann M1884 was significantly better than the other rifles tested, although in part this must be due to the higher muzzle velocity of the Jarmann.

The rifle commission found that the Jarmann with its 10.15 mm bullet had a maximum point-blank range of with a 1.8 m (6 ft) target. At a range of 600 metres (660 yd) it did not spread more than 61 cm (24 in) with uncoated lead bullets and 46 cm (18 in) with jacketed bullets. This compared very favorably to the Remington M1867, then the Norwegian standard weapon, with maximum point-blank range of 300 m (330 yd) and spread at 600 m of 96 cm (38 in).

In comparison, the Gras rifle displayed a spread of 89 cm (35 in) and the Mauser rifle (presumably a Gewehr 71) had a spread of 80 cm (31.5 in), both at 600 m (660 yd).

==Service==

Despite the problems with the weapon, no fewer than 30,000 were manufactured for the Norwegian armed forces in the decade between its adoption in 1884 and the later adoption of the Krag–Jørgensen in 1894. A further 1500 were manufactured for the Swedish Navy in the same period. In Norwegian service, it replaced the Remington M1867 and the last few kammerladers still in use.

When the weapon was chosen and first issued, the military considered it a very good weapon. It had a good rate of fire and had less than half the spread of the Remington M1867 at 600 m (46 versus 96 cm). It was later eclipsed, however by the radical development of firearms at the time. Within a decade it was phased out and replaced by the Krag–Jørgensen rifle. Even though it was phased out, several second-line units were issued the weapon in 1905, when war between Norway and Sweden was considered imminent.

Towards the end of their use in the armed forces, the original black powder cartridges were replaced by cartridges filled with smokeless powder. Despite the increase in muzzle velocity, the sights were not altered, thus radically decreasing the accuracy of the rifle.

==Fate of the Jarmanns==
Jarmann M1884s in their original condition are now extremely rare. During the 1920s and 1930s, a number of the surplus rifles was either sold to civilians or rebuilt into M28 harpoon guns.
From the mid-1920s and until the German invasion of Norway, it was possible for civilians to buy surplus Jarmann rifles for about a quarter of what a brand-new Krag–Jørgensen would cost. Despite the reasonable price, it appears that very few were sold. Attempts were also made to sell the rifles and ammunition abroad. In 1929, about 5000 rifles were sold to a German firm, but the fate of these Jarmanns is unknown. In 1936 King Ibn Saud from Saudi Arabia initiated talks to buy 20,000 Jarmanns with ammunition for his police force, but the request was turned down by the Norwegian parliament, who claimed that the sale of such outdated weapons would reflect badly upon Norway. In 1938 a private investor — Trygve G. Hygen, a former captain in the Norwegian Army — caused a minor international incident when he offered to sell Jarmann rifles to Ceylon. The British Consulate General complained to the Norwegian government, pointing out that Ceylon was British and they wanted full control of all weapons sold there. The Norwegian government reprimanded Hygen, and the offer was withdrawn. Attempts were also made by Hygen to sell Jarmanns to Lithuania, Cuba, Nicaragua, Bulgaria, Italy and the Netherlands, but without any takers.
Some reports indicate that the Germans melted a significant number down the last remaining Jarmann rifles in military warehouses during the Nazi occupation. The Germans still gave the rifle a designation, despite being considered too obsolete for their use, the Jarmann M1884 received the designation Gewehr 351(n).

==M28 Harpoon gun==

Between the wars, several Norwegian gunsmiths attempted to create harpoon guns, intended for hunting seals and shooting rescue lines to boats in distress. Seeing a ready market, and having access to the several thousand Jarmanns in storage, Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk designed a harpoon gun referred to as the M28.

==Comparison with contemporary rifles==
The Jarmann was, at the time of its adoption, considered a good weapon. By comparing it to the Remington M1867, which was the standard-issue rifle in the Norwegian Army, as well as against the standard service rifles of Germany, France and the United Kingdom at the time it is clear that the Jarmann indeed was an excellent weapon for its time, particularly in its accuracy and range.
