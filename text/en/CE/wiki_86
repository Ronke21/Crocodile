<text>The Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF; ) is the air and space force of Canada. Its role is to &quot;provide the Canadian Forces with relevant, responsive and effective airpower&quot;. The RCAF is one of three environmental commands within the unified Canadian Armed Forces. As of 2020, the Royal Canadian Air Force consists of 12,074 Regular Force and 1,969 Primary Reserve personnel, supported by 1,518 civilians, and operates 258 manned aircraft and nine unmanned aerial vehicles. Lieutenant-General Eric Kenny is the current Commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force and Chief of the Air Force Staff.

The Royal Canadian Air Force is responsible for all aircraft operations of the Canadian Forces, enforcing the security of Canada&#x27;s airspace and providing aircraft to support the missions of the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army. The RCAF is a partner with the United States Air Force in protecting continental airspace under the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The RCAF also provides all primary air resources to and is responsible for the National Search and Rescue Program.

The RCAF traces its history to the Canadian Air Force, which was formed in 1920. The Canadian Air Force was granted royal sanction in 1924 by King George V to form the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1968, the RCAF was amalgamated with the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Army, as part of the unification of the Canadian Forces. Air units were split between several different commands: Air Defence Command (ADC; interceptors), Air Transport Command (ATC; airlift, search and rescue), Mobile Command (tactical fighters, helicopters), Maritime Command (anti-submarine warfare, maritime patrol), as well as Training Command (TC).

In 1975, some commands (ADC, ATC, TC) were dissolved, and all air units were placed under a new environmental command called simply Air Command (AIRCOM; ). Air Command reverted to its historic name of &quot;Royal Canadian Air Force&quot; in August 2011.

The Royal Canadian Air Force has served in the Second World War, the Korean War, the Persian Gulf War, as well as several United Nations peacekeeping missions and NATO operations. As a NATO member, the force maintained a presence in Europe during the second half of the 20th century.

==History==
===1920–1945: Pre-unification===
The Canadian Air Force (CAF) was established in 1920 as the successor to a short-lived two-squadron Canadian Air Force that was formed during the First World War in Europe. Wing Commander John Scott Williams was tasked in 1921 with organizing the CAF, handing command over later the same year to Air Marshal Lindsay Gordon. The new Canadian Air Force was a branch of the Air Board and was chiefly a training militia that provided refresher training to veteran pilots. Many CAF members also worked with the Air Board&#x27;s Civil Operations Branch on operations that included forestry, surveying and anti-smuggling patrols. In 1923, the CAF became responsible for all flying operations in Canada, including civil aviation. In 1924, the Canadian Air Force, was granted the royal title, becoming the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). Most of its work was civil in nature, with forest patrols of the northwest a major part of its operations; however, in the late 1920s other agencies took up most civil tasks, with the notable exception of aerial photography surveys, and the RCAF evolved into more of a military organization. After budget cuts in the early 1930s, the air force began to rebuild.
====Second World War====
During the Second World War, the RCAF was a major contributor to the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan and was involved in operations in the United Kingdom, Europe, the north Atlantic, North Africa, southern Asia, and with home defence. Eight thousand, eight hundred and sixty-four Americans came north to volunteer for the RCAF and over 850 died in action. By the end of the war, the RCAF had become the fourth largest Allied air force.
During World War II the RCAF was headquartered at a six-storey office building at 20-23 Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields (built 1937), London. A commemorative plaque can be found on the outside of the building.

====1945–1968====
After the war, the RCAF reduced its strength. Because of the rising Soviet threat to the security of Europe, Canada joined NATO in 1949, and the RCAF established No. 1 Air Division RCAF consisting of four wings with three fighter squadrons each, based in France and West Germany. In 1950, the RCAF became involved with the transport of troops and supplies to the Korean War; however, it did not provide RCAF combat units. Members of the RCAF served in USAF units as exchange officers and several flew in combat. Both auxiliary and regular air defence squadrons were run by Air Defence Command. At the same time, the Pinetree Line, the Mid-Canada Line and the DEW Line radar stations, largely operated by the RCAF, were built across Canada because of the growing Soviet nuclear threat. In 1957, Canada and the United States created the joint North American Air Defense Command (NORAD). Coastal defence and peacekeeping also became priorities during the 1950s and 1960s.

===1968–present: Unification===

In 1968, the Royal Canadian Navy, Royal Canadian Air Force and Canadian Army were amalgamated to form the unified Canadian Forces. This initiative was overseen by the Defence Minister, Paul Hellyer. The controversial merger maintained several existing organizations and created some new ones: In Europe, No. 1 Canadian Air Group, operated Canadair CF-104 Starfighter nuclear strike/attack and reconnaissance under NATO&#x27;s Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force; Air Defence Command: operated McDonnell CF-101 Voodoo interceptors, CIM-10 Bomarc missiles and the SAGE radar stations within NORAD; Air Transport Command: provided strategic airlift for the NATO and UN peacekeeping missions; and Training Command. Aviation assets of the Royal Canadian Navy were combined with the RCAF Canadair CP-107 Argus long-range patrol aircraft under Maritime Command. In 1975, the different commands, and the scattered aviation assets, were consolidated under Air Command (AIRCOM).
In the early 1990s, Canada provided a detachment of CF-18 Hornets for the air defence mission in Operation Desert Shield. The force performed combat air patrols over operations in Kuwait and Iraq, undertook a number of air-to-ground bombing missions, and, on one occasion, attacked an Iraqi patrol boat in the Persian Gulf.

In the late 1990s, Air Command&#x27;s CF-18 Hornets took part in the Operation Allied Force in Yugoslavia, and in the 2000s, AIRCOM was heavily involved in the Afghanistan War, transporting troops and assets to Kandahar. Later in the decade-long war, AIRCOM set up a purpose-specific air wing, Joint Task Force Afghanistan Air Wing, equipped with several CH-146 Griffon and CH-147 Chinook helicopters, CC-130 Hercules, CU-161 Sperwer and leased CU-170 Heron UAVs in support of the Canadian Forces and ISAF mission. The wing stood down on 18 August 2011.

From 18 March to 1 November 2011, the RCAF was engaged in Operation Mobile, Canada&#x27;s contribution to Operation Unified Protector in Libya. Seven CF-18 Hornet fighter aircraft and several other aircraft served under Task Force Libeccio as part of the military intervention.

On 16 August 2011, the Government of Canada announced that the name &quot;Air Command&quot; was being changed to the air force&#x27;s original historic name: Royal Canadian Air Force (along with the change of name of Maritime Command to Royal Canadian Navy and Land Force Command to Canadian Army). The change was made to better reflect Canada&#x27;s military heritage and align Canada with other key Commonwealth countries whose military units use the royal designation.
The RCAF adopted a new badge in 2013, which is similar to the pre-unification RCAF badge (although placed in the modern frame used for command badges). The Latin motto of Air Command which was the motto of the Canadian Air Force when first formed after the First World War (before it became the Royal Canadian Air Force in 1924) was retained. Though traditional insignia for the RCAF was restored in 2015, there has been no restoration of the traditional uniforms or rank structure of the historical service (apart from a rank of &quot;aviator&quot;, which replaced that of &quot;private&quot; in 2015).

On 17 April 2014, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that Canada was dispatching six CF-18s and military personnel to assist NATO in operations in Eastern Europe.

===Future inventory===
====Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II====

On 28 March 2022, the Government of Canada announced that the competition had placed the F-35A first and planned to buy 88 aircraft. On 9 January 2023, the Government of Canada officially ordered 88 F-35As. Previously, a unique Canadian CF-35 variant was proposed that would differ from the F-35A by adding a drogue parachute and possibly an F-35B/C-style refuelling probe. In 2012, it was revealed that the CF-35 would employ the same boom refuelling system as the F-35A. Following the 2015 Federal Election the Liberal Party, whose campaign had included a pledge to cancel the F-35 procurement, formed a new government and commenced an open competition to replace the existing CF-18 Hornet. 

====General Atomics MQ-9B SkyGuardian====
On 19 December 2023, the Government of Canada announced that a contract was signed for 11 MQ-9B drones, 219 Hellfire missiles, and 12 Mk82 500-pound bombs in a deal worth $2.49 billion CAD. The drones are expected to be first delivered in 2028 with full operation expected in 2033. The drones are to be stationed in 14 Wing Greenwood, N.S. with 55 personnel and with 25 personnel at 19 Wing Comox, B.C. and in Ottawa with 160 staff to control the drones. Personnel will also forward deploy to northern Canada as needed.

====Boeing P-8A Poseidon====
On November 30, 2023, the Government of Canada finalized a government-to-government agreement with the US government for the acquisition of up to 16 P-8A Poseidon aircraft for the RCAF. Fourteen multi-mission aircraft will be procured, with options for up to two additional aircraft.

===Weapons and other equipment===
Weapons systems are used by the CF-18 Hornet, CP-140 Aurora, CH-146 Griffon and the CH-148 Cyclone.

== Structure ==
The commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force, at National Defence Headquarters in Ottawa, commands and provides strategic direction to the Air Force. The commander of 1 Canadian Air Division and Canadian NORAD Region, based in Winnipeg, is responsible for the operational command and control of Royal Canadian Air Force activities throughout Canada and worldwide. 2 Canadian Air Division was established in June 2009, and consists of training establishments. The other division, 3 Canadian Space Division, was established in 2022.

, there are 15 wings across Canada, 13 operational and 2 used for training. Wings represent the grouping of various squadrons, both operational and support, under a single tactical commander reporting to the operational commander. Ten wings also include a Canadian Forces base along with other operational and support units.

The rank of general is held when an air officer is Chief of the Defence Staff. The last air force officer who served as Chief of the Defence Staff was General Thomas J. Lawson, who was appointed to the position in 2012. The commander of the Royal Canadian Air Force holds the rank of lieutenant-general. Divisions are commanded by major-generals. Brigadier-generals are typically second-in-command of a division. Wings are commanded by colonels. Squadrons are commanded by lieutenant-colonels. Majors are typically second-in-command of squadrons, or flight commanders. Captains, lieutenants and second lieutenants are the junior level leaders in RCAF squadrons and headquarters.

== Ranks ==

===Commander-in-Chief===
===Officers===
===Non-commissioned members===
On 1 April 2015, the rank structure and insignia changed. The rank of private was replaced with that of aviator, represented with a propeller for the rank insignia. The previously used term &quot;leading aircraftman&quot; was considered not to be gender neutral. The rank insignia were also changed: enlisted ranks were changed from gold to pearl-grey (silver) and officers rank braid was changed from gold to pearl-grey on black, similar to the pattern used before unification of Canada&#x27;s armed forces in 1968. A revival of the former rank titles of the RCAF did not occur, however, as such an extensive change was considered &quot;too complicated and confusing&quot;. Instead, the current rank titles were retained (with the exception of aviator). The Royal Flying Corps, considered to be a predecessor of the RCAF, used rank titles similar to the existing rank titles of the RCAF.

==Symbols==
===Badge===

The badge of the Royal Canadian Air Force consists of:
* St. Edward&#x27;s Crown
* An eagle superimposed on a circlet
* A compartment of maple leaves
* Motto: (Latin for &#x27;Such is the pathway to the stars&#x27;)

===Roundels===
Roundels used from 1920 until 1945 were usually the same as Royal Air Force roundels although not all variations were used and colours were matched to locally available paints. On 5 July 1940, the RCAF was authorized to introduce the maple leaf into the roundel in place of the red centre. However, a large amount of RCAF planes still continued to use the RAF roundel until 1945 since their aircraft, including those built in Canada all came through RAF channels.
==Stamps==
On 9 November 1984, Canada Post issued &quot;Air Force&quot; as part of the Canadian Forces series. The stamps were designed by Ralph Tibbles, based on an illustration by William Southern. The 32¢ stamps are perforated 12 x 12.5 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

<text>Projector (stylized : projector, or on the reissue p.r.o.j.e.c.t.o.r.) is the fourth studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity. It is the final Dark Tranquillity album to feature guitarist Fredrik Johansson.

==Lineup change==
In January 1999, with the album recorded months prior, and its release months ahead, Johansson and Dark Tranquillity mutually split, due to Johansson wanting to focus on his family and his day job. Bassist Martin Henriksson replaced Johansson on guitar, and Michael Nicklasson joined the band afterward, taking Henriksson&#x27;s former position on bass guitar.

The introduction of piano, keyboards, and electronics — and their desire to integrate these elements into its sound — led the band to hire Martin Brändström as a full-time keyboardist. With the lineup, they played live bonus tracks of the reissue of this album and filmed a music video for &quot;ThereIn&quot;.

==Style==
&quot;Projector&quot; marked a noteworthy progression in the band&#x27;s style, featuring piano and clean guitar work akin to that of gothic metal. Vocalist Mikael Stanne&#x27;s prevalent use of clean vocals, featured sparsely on previous albums &quot;Skydancer&quot; and &quot;The Gallery&quot;, differentiated this release from their previous work. Because of its deviation from the band&#x27;s previous efforts, &quot;Projector&quot; was met with a mixed reception by longtime fans, though it also attracted a fair number of new listeners.

==Track listing==


==Release history==
The limited edition digipak includes the bonus track &quot;Exposure&quot;. However, there were problems with the pressings because not all the digipaks include &quot;Exposure&quot; and there are some traditional releases that include the track. The Japanese version of the album has different cover art and includes a booklet with more photos and biographical information. The 2009 reissue has digitally remastered audio.

<doc id="931420" wikidata="Q2824012" url="?curid=931420" title="Adam Stern">
<text>Adam James Stern (born February 12, 1980) is a Canadian former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder who played for the Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, and Milwaukee Brewers from 2005 to 2010.

Stern is the second Jewish player from Canada in major league history (following Goody Rosen). He, Kevin Youkilis, and Gabe Kapler set a record for most Jewish players on a team at once since the expansion era.

==Early life and college career==
Stern was born in London, Ontario. He is Jewish on his father&#x27;s side. In his youth, Stern participated in baseball, track and field, and volleyball.

Stern played for the London Badgers Baseball Club in London, Ontario from the age of 16 to the age of 18.

Stern played three years on a baseball scholarship at the University of Nebraska, from which he graduated with a Sociology degree. He hit .356 as a sophomore in 2000 to earn 2nd-Team All-Big 12 honors. After the 2000 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. In 2001, he appeared in the College World Series, and was named First-Team Academic All-Big 12, as well as an All-Big 12 Honorable Mention, after hitting .292 with 68 runs and 27 stolen bases in 64 games.

Stern was drafted twice: first, by the Toronto Blue Jays in the 22nd round (651st overall) of the 1998 MLB draft, and then by the Atlanta Braves in the 3rd round (105th overall) of the 2001 MLB draft, before moving to the Boston Red Sox in 2004 as a Rule 5 draft pick.

==Minor league career==
In 2002, Stern stole 40 bases in 48 attempts for Myrtle Beach in the Carolina League.

In 2004, while playing for the Greenville Braves, Stern started in left field for the Southern League&#x27;s Eastern Division All-Star team, and was named an outfielder on the league&#x27;s year-end All-Star club. He hit .322 with 64 runs, 26 doubles, and 27 stolen bases in 102 games. He ranked 3rd in the league in hitting, 8th with a .378 on-base percentage, and 9th with a .480 slugging percentage. His 27 steals were 3rd-most in the Braves system, and he had 41 multi-hit games in 99 starts. He was named Atlanta&#x27;s Double-A Player of the Year. Stern missed 26 games to play for Team Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where he hit .250 (8-for-32) with 4 RBIs and 9 runs in 9 games.

The Boston Red Sox made Stern a Rule 5 draft selection from the Braves in 2004. In 2005, he batted .321 (26-for-81) with 8 doubles, 14 RBIs, and 3 steals during a pair of rehab stints with Pawtucket, including a 21-game hitting streak.

In 2009, while playing for the Huntsville Stars, as of July 9 Stern was second in the Southern League in steals (27), runs (58), and triples (6), and third in hits (95). Stern was selected to be a starting right fielder for the Southern League North Division All Star team, with the game to be played July 14 in Birmingham. Promoted to Nashville, he batted .310.

In 2010, he batted .325/.399/.462 for Nashville, in 86 games.

==Major league career==

===Boston Red Sox (2005–06)===
Stern made his major league debut with the Red Sox on July 7, 2005. His debut was delayed first by a fractured right thumb he sustained while sliding in spring training, then by a hamstring injury.

On August 8, 2005, while playing for the Red Sox, Stern took the field in the 9th inning along with Kevin Youkilis and Gabe Kapler, setting a &quot;record&quot; for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in American League history and the most in Major League Baseball history since four Jews took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941.

He played all three outfield positions in 2005, but was used primarily in right field. Due to injuries in 2005, Stern fell short of the time Rule 5 picks are required to be on a 25-man major league roster. After spending 18 days on the roster to start the 2006 season (during which he made a game-saving catch against the Devil Rays), as required to fulfill his Rule 5 obligations, Stern was optioned to Pawtucket on April 20. With the Red Sox, he again played all three outfield positions in 2006, but was used primarily in center field.

Over the first two years of his major league career, he played errorless defense with better than average range at each position.

===Baltimore Orioles (2007–08)===
On October 3, 2006, Stern passed through waivers and was traded by the Red Sox to the Baltimore Orioles to complete a deal for catcher Javy López and cash.

In January 2007, Stern reached a one-year deal with the Orioles. Limited to 14 games in spring training, because of a strained right oblique muscle and a bout of food poisoning, Stern was 5–18 with 3 walks, 3 strikeouts, and 3 stolen bases in 3 attempts. On March 28, the Orioles optioned Stern to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides. Norfolk vice president Jim Duquette noted, &quot;With Stern, we didn&#x27;t feel like we had the opportunity to see an awful lot of him, and we feel like he needs more time down in the minor leagues. He was one of the guys we were talking about all spring.&quot;

Stern was called up to the Orioles on April 17 to replace Corey Patterson, who was placed on the bereavement list. He appeared in two games, playing three innings in the outfield with no plate appearances. He was released by the Orioles on June 10, 2008.

===Milwaukee Brewers (2009–10)===
Stern signed a minor league contract with the Milwaukee Brewers in January 2009. Stern had an excellent spring, batting .432 with 12 RBIs and 6 stolen bases in 42 at bats. He said: &quot;You try to put together a good spring so they&#x27;ll notice.&quot; &quot;He had a good spring for us&quot;, said general manager Doug Melvin. &quot;He was swinging the bat good (in Nashville). He can do a lot of things. He gets after it pretty good.&quot;

He was called up to the active roster on May 11, 2010, from AAA Nashville where he was batting .349 in 12 games when Carlos Gómez was placed on the disabled list. He said: &quot;Any time you get to put a big league uniform on you look forward to it. I&#x27;m excited for the opportunity.&quot;

He made his first appearance for the Brewers on May 14. It was his first appearance playing in the majors since the 2007 season, and his first at bat since the 2006 season. He said: &quot;I&#x27;m just happy that they gave me an opportunity to get back to the big leagues. I know how tough it is to get back here, and that makes me appreciate it that much more.&quot; Stern filed for free agency following the conclusion of the 2010 season.

==Team Canada==
On March 8, 2006, Stern had a superb game for Team Canada against the United States in the first World Baseball Classic, just a double short of hitting for the cycle, including an inside-the-park home run, and driving in 4 runs. He also made a couple of excellent catches in center field. Canada won the game 8–6, pulling off the biggest upset of the tournament. In the series, he batted 6 for 9.

In January 2007, he was awarded the first Stubby Clapp Award at the fifth annual Baseball Canada fund raiser.

In March 2008, he played for Team Canada in Taiwan as they competed in an 8-team tournament for a berth in the 2008 Summer Olympics. They won one of the three tickets to the Summer Games, joining Taiwan and South Korea. Stern played center field for Team Canada in all seven of their games at the Olympics, contributing four runs, four hits and three RBIs.

In March 2009, Stern played for Team Canada in the 2009 World Baseball Classic.

==Post-playing career==
In 2013, Stern rejoined the Red Sox as a scout, and is now scouting for the Kansas City Royals. He owns Centrefield Sports, a multi-purpose facility and is the Director of Player Development for the Great Lake Canadians.

<text>The direct pathway, sometimes known as the direct pathway of movement, is a neural pathway within the central nervous system (CNS) through the basal ganglia which facilitates the initiation and execution of voluntary movement. It works in conjunction with the indirect pathway. Both of these pathways are part of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loop.

==Overview of neuronal connections and normal function==

The direct pathway passes through the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus, which are parts of the basal ganglia. It also involves another basal ganglia component the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. In a resting individual, a specific region of the globus pallidus, the internal globus pallidus (GPi), and a part of the substantia nigra, the pars reticulata (SNpr), send spontaneous inhibitory signals to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus, through the release of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Inhibition of the inhibitory neurons that project to the ventral anterior nucleus (VA), which project to the motor regions of the cerebral cortices of the telencephalon, leads to an increase in activity in the motor cortices, thereby promoting muscular action.

When the pre-frontal region of the cerebral cortex, which is generally involved in decision making and planning, determines that a particular motor activity will be executed, it sends activating signals to the motor cortices. The motor cortices send signals through the basal ganglia to refine the choice of muscles that will participate in the movement and to amplify the activity in the motor cortices that will drive the muscle contractions.
In the direct pathway, the motor cortices send activating signals to the caudate and putamen (which together form the dorsal striatum). The cells of the direct pathway in the caudate and putamen that receive these signals are inhibitory and, once they become activated, send inhibitory signals to the GPi and SNpr and stop activity there. Before activation of the direct pathway, these two nuclei were actively sending inhibitory signals to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, which prevented the development of significant activity in the motor cerebral cortices. This behavior ceases on activation of the direct pathway. The net effect is to allow the activation of the ventral lateral nucleus which, in turn, sends activating signals to the motor cortices. These events amplify motor cortical activity that will eventually drive muscle contractions.

==Diseases involving the direct pathway==

Interruption or dysfunction of the direct pathway results in hypokinesia, which is, in general terms, a disease which leads to a lack of motion in our body.

<text>Vidisha (विदिशा, formerly known as Bhelsa and known as Besnagar and Bhaddilpur in ancient times) is a city in Indian state of Madhya Pradesh and the administrative headquarters of Vidisha district. It is located 62.5 km northeast of the state capital, Bhopal. The name &quot;Vidisha&quot; is derived from the nearby river &quot;Bais&quot;, mentioned in the Puranas.

The district was created as Bhilsa District in 1904 by joining the tehsils of Vidisha (also known as Bhilsa) and Basoda (but not Basoda State) which were then part of Gwalior state. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, the former princely state of Gwalior became part of Madhya Bharat state, which was formed in 1948.

Vidishā was the administrative headquarters of Bhelsa, or Bhilsa, during the Medieval period. It was renamed Vidisha in 1956. Vidisha is also amongst the 112 Aspirational District in the Aspirational District Programme launched by NITI Aayog in 2018. 
Towards the seventh or eighth century, Bhadravati was raised from its ruins by a Bheel chieftain, who surrounded it with walls, and gave it the name of Bhilsa. When, in the year 1230, the Emperor Altamsh took possession of it, it was the seat of a Rajpoot prince of the Chohan clan. It was not, however, finally wrested from the Hindoos until the year 1570, under Akbar.

==Demographics==

As of the 2011 Census of India, Vidisha had a population of 155,959. Males constitute 53.21% of the population and females 46.79%. Vidisha has an average literacy rate of 86.88%, higher than the national average of 74.04%: male literacy is 92.29%, and female literacy is 80.98%. In Vidisha, 15% of the population is under 6 years of age.

==History==
===Besnagar===

The town is situated east of the Betwa River, in the fork of the Betwa and Bes rivers, 9 km from Sanchi. The town of Besnagar, 3 km from present-day Vidisha on the west side of the river, became an important trade centre in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, under the Shungas, Nagas, Satavahanas, and Guptas, and was mentioned in the Pali scriptures. The Emperor Ashoka was the governor of Vidisha during his father&#x27;s lifetime. His Buddhist Empress Vidisha Devi who was also his first wife, was brought up in Vidisha. It finds mention in Kalidasa&#x27;s &quot;Meghaduta&quot;.

The ruins of Besnagar were inspected by Alexander Cunningham in 1874–1875. Remains of a large defensive wall were found on the western side of the city. Ancient Buddhist railings were also found just outside of the city, which had probably adorned a stupa. Numerous coins were found, including nine coins of the Western Satraps.

The Heliodorus Pillar is a stone column, which was constructed in about 150 BCE. This stone column was erected by the Greek ambassador of the Indo-Greek King Antialcidas, who came to the court of Bhagabhadra, a possible Sunga king. Dedicated to Lord Vāsudeva, this column was constructed in front of the temple of Vāsudeva. The pillar is situated about four kilometers away from the city on Vidisha-Ganj Basoda SH-14, located on the northern bank of the Vais River. It is a 20 feet and 7 inches tall stone pillar, commonly called &quot;Kham Baba&quot;. The script used in the inscription is Brahmi but the language is Prakrit, recording that Heliodorus erected the pillar as a Garuda Stambha to pay homage to Lord Vasudeva, who was later integrated as a manifestation of Lord Vishnu.

===Emergence as Bhelsa===

Besnagar was known as Bhelsa during the medieval period. It became famous for the temple of Sun god Bhillasvamin. It was ruled by the Later Gupta king Devagupta of Malwa and Rashtrakuta king Krishna III. The name is first noted in an inscription of 878 CE by a merchant Hatiaka of Paravada community. The 12th-century Tri-shashthi-shalaka-purusha-charitra mentions an image of Bhillasvamin at Vidisa, along with a copy of Jivant Swami buried in the sand. Minhajuddin&#x27;s Tabaqat-i-Nusiri states that the temple was destroyed by Iltutmish in 1233–34 CE.

In 1293, Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate sacked the city as a general of Sultan Jalaluddin. The attack was illustrative of Vidisha&#x27;s importance in the medieval era. In 1532 Bhilsa was sacked by Bahadur Shah of Gujarat Sultanate. It then passed on to the Malwa Sultans, the Mughals and the Scindias.

=== Jainism in Vidisha ===
Vidisha is considered to be Puranakshetras Jain tirtha. Vidisha is also believed to be the birthplace of Shitalanatha, the tenth tirthankar. There are 14 temples in Vidisha, among which Bada Mandir, Bajramath Jain temple, Maladevi temple, Gadarmal temple and Pathari Jain temple, built between 9th-10th centuries CE, are the most prominent. These temples are rich in architecture.

==Historic places and monuments==

Near the eastern edge of the old town are the remains of a large temple of the late Paramara period known as the Bijamaṇḍal. The building was probably started in the second half of the 11th century. That it was never finished is evidenced by the unfinished carved niches and architectural pieces found round the base of the temple plinth. On top of the plinth is a small mosque made using pillars, one of which has an inscription dating probably from the time of king Naravarman (&quot;circa&quot; 1094–1134). It is a devotional inscription revering Carccikā (i.e. Cāmuṇḍā), of whom he was a devotee. The &quot;miḥrāb&quot; suggests the mosque was constructed in the late 14th century. To one side of the Bijamaṇḍal is a store house of the Archaeological Survey of India containing many sculptures collected in the neighbourhood. A step-well of the 7th century is in the same campus and has, beside the entrance, two tall pillars with Kṛṣṇa scenes. These are the earliest Kṛṣṇa scenes in the art of central India. The dimensions of Bijamandal Temple at Vidisha are comparable to those of Konark in Orissa.

Lohangi Pir is a rock formation in Vidisha District that derives its name from Shaykh Jalal Chishti, a saint who was locally known as Lohangi Pir. This small domed building is a tomb, which has two Persian inscriptions on it. One of the inscriptions dates back to 1460 CE, while the other is from 1583 CE. The tank and a large bell-capital dating back to the 1st century BCE can be seen on the nearby hill. Near the tomb are the remains of a medieval temple that survived as a pillared crypt. These are dedicated to Goddess Annapurna. Lohangi is a large rock right in the heart of Vidisha, within walking distance of the railway station, is of religious and historical significance in the region.

Udaygiri is less than 10 km from Vidisha town. It is a series of at least 20 caves, containing both Hindu and Jain sculptures from the Gupta Era, sometime between the 4th and 5th century CE. According to Jain texts, Tirthankara Sheetal Nath attained nirvana here. It is basically a small hill where intricate sculptures have been cut out of the rocks.

Maladevi temple is a grand Portal of ninth century CE, situated on the eastern slope of a hill and built on a huge platform cut out of the hillside and strengthened by a massive retaining wall, Maladevi temple&#x27;s imposing structure provides a panoramic valley view, in Gyaraspur, about 40 km from Vidisha along NH-86.

Hindola Torana - Hindola means a swing and Torana is an arched gate - is a magnificent artwork of the 9th century or medieval period, situated in Gyaraspur. It is a developed, ornamental and decorated arched gate made of sandstone. On both of its pillars, Lord Vishnu&#x27;s ten incarnations are engraved. Near it, four carved and sculpted pillars and beams seem to be the ruins of Trimurthy temple set on one raised platform, as Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Goddess Parvati and their servants are sculpted on these pillars and beams. The gate may be an entrance gate for a temple for Vishnu, Shiva or Thirumurthy.

Bajramath Temple is situated in Gyaraspur, on NH-146 behind the Sub-Judicial Magistrate and Tehsildar&#x27;s Office. The temple faces the east, and was a Hindu temple later transformed into a Jain temple. It is just opposite the hill on which Maladevi temple is situated.

Dashavtar Temple is situated on the north of the local lake, where ruins of a group of small Vaishnava shrines can be found. These small Vaishnava shrines are popularly known as Sadhavatara Temple. The temple comprises a large open pillared hall, in which the pillars are dedicated to the ten incarnations of Vishnu. These pillars date back from 8th to 10th century CE. Towards the western bank of the lake lie the ruins of sati pillars that date back to 9th or 10th century CE. One of these pillars is carved with four sculptured faces that depict a seated group of Hara-Gauri.

Girdhari Temple, which is known for its sculptures and fine carvings, is a popular attraction in Sironj. The ancient shrines of Jatashankar and Mahamaya are located close to this temple. Jatashankar Temple is situated 3 km towards the south-west of Sironj in the forest area. On the other hand, Mahamaya Temple is situated 5 km south-west of Sironj.

Udayeshwara Temple, located in Udaipur village of the Basoda Tehsil, is one of the most prominent Hindu shrines in the region. The inscriptions found in this temple suggest that the Udaipur Town was founded by the Parmara King Udayaditya during the 11th century CE. Other inscriptions found at the temple suggest that Parmara King Udayaditya dedicated it to Lord Shiva.

<doc id="931438" wikidata="Q6025117" url="?curid=931438" title="Indirect pathway">
<text>The indirect pathway, sometimes known as the indirect pathway of movement, is a neuronal circuit through the basal ganglia and several associated nuclei within the central nervous system (CNS) which helps to prevent unwanted muscle contractions from competing with voluntary movements. It operates in conjunction with the direct pathway.

== Overview of connections and function ==
The indirect pathway originates in the D2 subtype of the striatal medium spiny neuron, which respond to the absence of continuous dopamine signal. The indirect pathway passes through the caudate, putamen, and globus pallidus, which are parts of the basal ganglia. It traverses the subthalamic nucleus, a part of the diencephalon, and enters the substantia nigra, a part of the midbrain. In a resting individual, a specific region of the globus pallidus, known as the internus, and a portion of the substantia nigra, known as the pars reticulata, send spontaneous inhibitory signals to the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) of the thalamus, through the release of GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter. Inhibition of the excitatory neurons within VL, which project to the motor regions of the cerebral cortices of the telencephalon, leads to a reduction of activity in the motor cortices, and a lack of muscular action.

When the prefrontal cortex, which is generally involved in decision making and planning, determines that motor activity be executed, it sends activating signals to the motor cortices. The motor cortices send activating signals to the direct pathway through the basal ganglia, which stops inhibitory outflow from parts of the globus pallidus internus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The net effect is to allow the activation of the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus which, in turn, sends activating signals to the motor cortices. These events amplify motor cortical activity that will eventually drive muscle contractions.

Simultaneously, in the indirect pathway, the motor cortices send activating signals to the caudate and putamen. The cells of the indirect pathway in the caudate and putamen that receive these signals are inhibitory and, once activated, they send inhibitory signals to the globus pallidus externus, reducing the activity in that nucleus. The globus pallidus externus normally sends inhibitory signals to the subthalamic nucleus. On activation of the indirect pathway, these inhibitory signals are reduced, which allows more activation of the subthalamic nucleus. Subthalamic nucleus cells can then send more activating signals to some parts of the globus pallidus internus and substantia nigra pars reticulata. Thus, parts of these two nuclei are driven to send more inhibitory signals to the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus, which prevents the development of significant activity in the motor cerebral cortices. This behavior prevents the activation of motor cortical areas that would compete with the voluntary movement.

== Clinical significance==
Interruption or dysfunction of the indirect pathway of movement results in hyperkinesia, or dyskinesias, which are, in general, diseases which lead to the production of additional involuntary muscle activity.

<doc id="931449" wikidata="Q5467738" url="?curid=931449" title="Ford Essex V6 engine (UK)">
<text>The Ford Essex V6 engine is a 60° V6 engine built between 1966 and 1988 by the Ford Motor Company in the United Kingdom and until 2000 in South Africa although mostly in the Ford engine plant of Dagenham, Essex, which gave the engine its name. It is closely related to the Ford Essex V4 engine produced in displacements of 1.7 L and 2.0 L. Both engines share many parts since the Essex V6 was directly derived from the Essex V4; the 2.0 L Essex V4 and the 3.0 L Essex V6 in fact have exactly the same bore and stroke and share various components. In the same era, the Ford Cologne V6 engine was produced.

==History==
The Essex V4 and V6 were mainly designed to replace the outdated and ageing inline-four and six-cylinder Ford Zephyr engines. It was produced in four capacities: , , , , with the 3.0-litre version being the most common and widely used. These engines were fitted to a wide range of vehicles, from Ford Transit vans to sedans, coupés like the Ford Capri and sports cars like TVRs and Marcos.

The earlier versions of engine were rated at and of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads which improved the power and torque to produce SAE or DIN at 5000 rpm and SAE or DIN of torque at 3000 rpm. At the same time, the oil dipstick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design.

The shape of the inlet ports was also changed from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old 40 DFAV Weber carburetor that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the 38 DGAS Weber carburetor, the air filter housing was also changed and later around 1976 a hot air intake was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the exhaust manifold or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up more quickly. The carburetor was also modified again, a return-style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum-operated choke in the air filter housing were also added. This, and a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control.

The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones. Aftermarket steel, aluminium, and alloy gears have been produced as replacements to prevent the gear from stripping its teeth: this is commonly due to overheating causing the nylon to weaken. This is one of the two major weak points of the Essex V-engines, the other being the hexagonal oil pump spindle / shaft which can round off, or even break.

The 2.5 L engine was rated at SAE gross or DIN and peak torque was rated at SAE gross or DIN. The 2.5-litre version ended production in 1977 along with the Essex V4 engine. The V6 engine as used in the Ford Capri RS 3100 was essentially a 3.0 L engine bored out by or 60 thousandths of an inch from to . It was capable of at 5000 rpm and of torque at 3000 rpm. It featured blue rocker covers in order to distinguish the engine from the usual 3.0 L engine and it also featured hand-polished and ported inlet and exhaust ports. Only 250 RS 3100s were produced for homologation purposes, making original 3.1-litre engines very rare, although modified engines bored +0.60 are common, one of the first 50 engines which was in a RS 3100 that was free for car magazines to review and test in fact had instead of the of the rest of road going RS 3100s, this was achieved with a higher lift camshaft. These figures vary somewhat depending on the source. The Essex V6 also formed the base for the 3.4 L Cosworth GAA born in May 1972 and designed by Mike Hall, also responsible for designing Cosworth&#x27;s famous DFV Engine. The GAA had the benefit of bores, DOHC aluminium alloy heads, Lucas mechanical fuel injection, a dry sump oiling system and a steel crankshaft and generated at 9,000 rpm and of torque. Mike Hall&#x27;s intention was to design the cylinder heads so that 3 spark plugs per cylinder could be fitted, but this idea was dropped since there was no appreciable increase in power or torque. The original objective was an engine with a minimum of ; this objective was exceeded, with the engine making in the first test run. This engine was used in the racing version of the Capri RS 3100, competing successfully in the European Touring Car Championship, as well as in Formula 5000 single-seaters. One hundred kits were also sold by Ford Motorsport.

Ford RS dealerships also offered a number of performance modifications for the Essex V6, called the &quot;GP1&quot; (Group 1) and &quot;Series X&quot;, the GP1 package offered a 40 DFI5 Weber carburetor, a camshaft kit, larger, , inlet and exhaust valves, double valve springs, specially selected connecting rods and forged high compression pistons giving a power output of around . The Series X modifications offered the same larger inlet and exhaust valves as the GP1, but also offered a new inlet manifold designed for three twin-choke 42 DCNF Weber carburetors fed by an electric fuel pump which boosted power up to and , however the standard camshaft was retained.


Earlier versions of the 3.0-litre engine (pre-October 1971) were fueled by a twin-choke 40 DFAV Weber carburetor, which had some inherent faults in its design which caused it to run too rich and cause bore wash. It was subsequently replaced by a more modern twin-choke 38 DGAS Weber carburetor which effectively solved the problems of the earlier carburetors, and was used for the 3-litre V6 until the end of its production. The 2.5-litre V6 used a single barrel Ford carburetor which was also used in the low-compression variants of the 3.0-litre Essex V6 used in the Ford Transit. Unusually, the Essex V6 was designed so that the same block could serve in both diesel (compression ignition) and petrol applications, although the diesel version never reached production. Traces of its diesel design lie in the very heavy construction using Heron cylinder heads and the necessity for dished pistons to decrease compression for the petrol engine. The cast iron Essex V6 is a heavy engine due to its sturdy design, weighing , more than the aluminium alloy Rover V8, for example, the Essex V6 also has a very heavy yet sturdy four-main bearing crossplane crankshaft with large main journals, and a heavy flywheel in order to smooth out the power delivery, sometimes Essex V6 engines are referred to as an &quot;Essex lump&quot; referring to the weight of these engines. In spite of its heaviness, the Essex V6 was used as the main workhorse and a high performance option for medium to full-sized cars like the Capri the Granada and Transit. Ford supplied Essex V6-powered Transit vans to the police and ambulance services in the UK from the late 1960s until 1989, when it was replaced by more modern engines such as the fuel injected 2.8 and 2.9 L Ford Cologne V6 engine although the Essex V6 was even used until April 2000 in South Africa.
TVR contracted the company Broadspeed to develop a turbocharging system for their TVR 3000S turbo. In lieu of fuel injection, the carburettor was run inside a pressurized box atop the engine, and the turbocharger itself was mounted low and forward in the engine compartment, requiring the exhaust manifolds to exit forward. The compression ratio was lowered from 9.0:1 to 8.0:1 to reduce the engine&#x27;s internal stresses. Turbocharging substantially increased horsepower, from and torque from .

Broadspeed also designed a turbocharging system for the Mk1 Ford Capri 3.0, available since early 1970 these Capris were known as &quot;Broadspeed Bullet Capris&quot;. The engine was heavily modified and included modified cylinder heads, a high-lift camshaft, a re-jetted carburetor, a completely blueprinted rotating assembly, lowered 8.2:1 compression ratio, a modified inlet manifold and exhaust system using a single turbocharger. Their power was substantially increased (by 63%) from . Similar to the TVR 3000S&#x27; turbocharging system, it used a &quot;blow-through carburettor&quot; system in which the standard but re-jetted 38 DGAS Weber carburetor was run inside a pressurised airbox. Performance figures further increased with the uprated post-October 1971 versions of the engine. The company Janspeed, well known for their high performance exhaust systems, also designed a turbocharging system for the Ford Essex 3.0 L and 1.6 – 2.0 L OHC engines, although these were much simpler than the turbocharging system offered by Broadspeed, Janspeed promised a 25% increase in horsepower, boosting the engine&#x27;s power output from to around using a single Roto-Master turbocharger mounted directly on top of the left bank of the engine providing of boost.

The 2.5 L and 3.0 L engines share the same block, connecting rods and bore, differing only in crank throw and pistons, 3.0 L pistons have a length of and 2.5 L pistons have a length of / 

Companies like Specialised Engines, Essex engines and Ric Wood have professionally built and developed large displacement 3.2 L, 3.4 L and even 4.0 L conversions and forced induction conversions for the Essex V6 with power outputs reaching as high as .


==US emissions certification==

In 1977, Californian company Olson Engineering, Inc. was contracted by TVR to design modifications to the Essex V6 such that it could be emissions-certified for use in the United States. This allowed TVR to sell its Essex-engined M Series cars in that market for the 1978 and 1979 model years. An owner&#x27;s handbook supplement for US Federal models indicates that the emissions control system used a catalytic converter, exhaust gas recirculation, and secondary air injection. A shipment of approximately twenty 3000Ss arrived in September 1979, and were marked by the import company as being emissions compliant without the Olson Engineering emissions kit actually having been fitted. Dealers were made aware of this fact, but were each apparently coerced into buying at least two of the non-compliant cars with the threat of withholding spare parts for other TVR models. One dealer explained the situation to a customer who happened to work for the US government in an emissions-regulation capacity, and he reported the violation to the authorities. The cars were then impounded. During the long period of time during which Martin Lilley attempted to communicate with US customs officials to resolve the situation, the cars were neglected and stored outside, where they deteriorated and were vandalized. The cars were eventually re-exported, repaired, and sold in Germany, but the short-term financial impact of the unsalable cars (worth over £100,000 in total) was damaging to the development of the M Series replacement, the Tasmin.

==South Africa==

In South Africa, the engine continued in production from 1982 up to April 2000 for use in the Sapphire Saloon and Sierra vehicles, and Courier pick-ups. Late in its production life it was fitted with Lucas controlled electronic fuel injection designed by SAMCOR (South African Motor Corporation – now Ford SA) in co-operation with the University of Pretoria&#x27;s engineering department. This conversion resulted in a power increase from to of the standard 3.0 version, and for the fuel injection version, plus a useful boost to fuel economy. Only about 1,600 of the EFI variants were produced during 1992 and 1993. In October 1997, the 3.0L was enlarged to 3.4L by boring the cylinders and a new crankshaft with a stroke of giving a displacement of , this was done for the engine to be better suited to 4x4 vehicles where torque is needed. The 3.4 version produced and . All 3.4 variants used the 38DGAS Weber carburetor with venturis. Production tooling at the factory was scrapped and sold in 2000, to make way for the production of a new four cylinder OHC engine, the remaining old stock of 3.4 L Engines started to be sold as assembled crate engines, these engines had some differences from the 2.5 3.0 and 3.1 L Dagenham built engines such as: Ford Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 forged connecting rods, German made pistons with moly coating, smaller crank journals which reduced bearing speed, more aggressive camshaft timing and higher lift, larger inlet valves, shaft mounted rockers from Ford&#x27;s Cologne 2.8 / 2.9 V6 engine, unique cylinder head castings with extra oil galleries, solid pushrods with no oiling holes, unique exhaust manifold bolt pattern due to the head castings also being unique to the 3.4-litre engine and an improved inlet manifold with larger runners and an improved plenum chamber. From 1966 to 1998, the 3.0L was also used in industrial applications such as generator plants, airport vehicles, milk vans, jet boats (Hamilton jet) and even river barges.

<text>Jianguomen () was a gate in the city wall that once stood in Beijing and is now a transportation hub to the east of city centre. At Jianguomen bridge, the eastern 2nd Ring Road divides Jianguomen Inner Street to the west from Jianguomen Outer Street to the east.

A sub-district, [[Jianguomen Subdistrict]] is named after the gate. It is part of the Dongcheng district.

==History==
Jianguomen was not one of the 16 original gates in Beijing&#x27;s 15th century Ming-era city wall. The gate was an opening on the east side of Beijing&#x27;s inner city wall that was created in 1939 during the Japanese occupation of the city to enable access to the industrializing eastern suburbs of the city. The gate was formally named the &quot;Jianguomen&quot; in November 1945. At that time Beiping, as the city was then known, returned to Chinese rule.

The oldest landmark at Jianguomen is the famous Beijing Ancient Observatory.
In the 1970s, numerous embassies of Western countries opened in the area northwest of Jianguomen. In 1973, the Beijing Friendship Store was moved from Wangfujing to Jianguomen Outer Street. The Jianguo Hotel, just east of Jianguomen, opened in 1982, was the first Sino-foreign hotel joint venture in Beijing.

==Local transit==
The Jianguomen Station of the Beijing Subway is an interchange station for Lines 1 and 2 of the Beijing Subway. Many Beijing Bus routes stop at Jianguomen South (建国门南).

<text>Kevin Ronald Nicholson (born March 29, 1976) is a Canadian former professional baseball shortstop. He played part of the season for the San Diego Padres of Major League Baseball, and for the Canadian Olympic baseball team in 2004.

==Career==
Nicholson was drafted by the California Angels in the 43rd round (1182nd overall) of the 1994 MLB draft, but did not sign, choosing instead to attend Stetson University, where he played college baseball under head coach Pete Dunn. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Wareham Gatemen of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named the league&#x27;s MVP. In 1997, he was named conference Player of the Year.

In the 1997 MLB draft he was chosen in the first round, 27th overall, by the San Diego Padres.

Nicholson spent three seasons in the minors, playing in 1998 and 1999 with the Class AA Mobile Bay Bears, and in 1999 had a batting average of .288 with 13 home runs and 81 RBIs. Nicholson played 37 games for the Padres in 2000.

He later spent time in the Colorado Rockies, St. Louis Cardinals, and Pittsburgh Pirates organizations, but never saw action for their major league clubs.

He was a member of the Canadian national baseball team for several years. In 2001, he was with their Baseball World Cup team, and was a member of Team Canada&#x27;s fourth place team in the 2004 Summer Olympics. He played for Canada at the inaugural World Baseball Classic in 2006, being the last season in which Nicholson played professionally, appearing with the Somerset Patriots of the independent Atlantic League.

His final appearance for Team Canada came at the 2007 Baseball World Cup.

<doc id="931466" wikidata="Q126708360" url="?curid=931466" title="Andy Warhol's Exposures">
<text>Exposures, also known as Andy Warhol&#x27;s Exposures, is a 1979 book by the American artist Andy Warhol and his collaborator Bob Colacello. The first edition of the book was published by Andy Warhol Books, an imprint of Grosset &amp; Dunlap.

== Background ==
Pop artist Andy Warhol was a photography enthusiast who famously carried around a Polaroid camera in the 1970s. He used Polaroids as the basis of his commissioned silkscreen portraits.

In 1976, Warhol and Bob Colacello, editor of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Interview&quot; magazine, both purchased a Minox 35EL camera while they were in Bonn. Considering the amount of traveling they did, Warhol suggested that they should do a photography book together with the photos they took at social events and business trips. Warhol liked how small and sleek the camera looked, comparing it to a &quot;&#x27;spy&#x27; camera because it takes pictures without arousing the notice of the subject.&quot;

Photographer Christopher Makos was hired as the art director for the book to do the layout.

== Content ==

The book contains over 250 previously unpublished photographs of Warhol&#x27;s famous friends and anecdotes. The subjects include Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger, Truman Capote, Jackie Onassis, Liza Minnelli, Halston, Calvin Klein, Muhammad Ali, Diana Vreeland, and Yves Saint Laurent among others. &quot;I have a Social Disease. I have to go out every night,&quot; Warhol wrote as tells stories of his adventures. He told the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Most of the people we took are people we see all the time ... It&#x27;s a business, but then you become best friends with some of them. I like everyone to be my best friend, but I try not to get too involved.&quot;

However, many of the stories in the book were Colacello&#x27;s and he recalled in his book &quot;Holy Terror: Andy Warhol Up Close&quot; that this caused some resentment: &quot;I hated the fact that I was ghostwriting again, that every time I typed &#x27;I&#x27; it was Andy, not me. When I&#x27;d worked on the &quot;Philosophy&quot; book that had seemed liberating, but now it felt humiliating, especially since the stories &#x27;I&#x27; was telling were mine, not Andy&#x27;s. In some cases. I put Andy at scenes where only I had been. It was a form of lying of course, but there was no other way to write an Andy Warhol book, no more Warhol way.&quot;

== Release ==
Warhol and Colacello formed a co-publishing company, Andy Warhol Books, which was marketed and distributed by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. They received 50% of the profits and a $35,000 advance but they had to pay the production costs. Production took longer than anticipated and most of their advance was used to cover the expenses.

The book was released on October 15, 1979. The first print of 25,000 sold out within a week of publication. The book cost $25, but there were limited edition copies for $500 that included a silkscreen print signed by Warhol. 

In November 1979, Warhol embarked on a 3-week book tour to promote &quot;Exposures&quot;. 

== Reception ==
Paul Weingarten of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;The book is a paean to the &#x27;glitterati&#x27; who flock to Studio 54 and all the chic watering holes. Its text is breathlessly gossipy, and its pictures, all black and white (he hasn&#x27;t learned to take color ones yet), chronicle the antics of Warhol&#x27;s acquaintances and friends.&quot;

William S. Murphy wrote for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;: &quot;From a technical standpoint, the pictures in this volume are atrocious, which really enhances the book&#x27;s charm. He lights each frame with a booming strobe flash in a style similar to the work of Arthur Fellig, best known as Weegee ... The text covering his nighttime adventures in Manhattan is superb. And one must credit his pictures for one quality. they are indeed candid.&quot;

Marian Christy of &quot;The&quot; &quot;Boston Globe&quot; praised Warhol&#x27;s humor in the book, writing &quot;Warhol has simply given humor a new style ... Pop art has become pop humor.&quot; &quot;Andy Warhol even knows how to make fun of himself. He shared precious tidbits about his private terrors,&quot; she added.

<doc id="931470" wikidata="Q7278343" url="?curid=931470" title="Ra-Ra Zoo">
<text>Ra-Ra Zoo was an English-based contemporary circus theatre company, active (August 1984 - September 1994), a seminal group who created self devised physical theatre performance for theatres using comedy and circus skills. Founded by Sue Broadway, Stephen Kent, David Spathaky and Sue Bradley while they were all working and staying together at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 1984.

In 2018, the UK &quot;Guardian&quot; newspaper named them as one of the 25 most influential aspects of the 250 year history of circus in the West.
The first public performance was at the infamous Tunnel Club hosted by Malcolm Hardee in the East End of London. Notably, the normally vocal audience were unusually silenced by a wordless version of their signature teacup act.

Their first full show at the Battersea Arts Centre was as part of the London International Mime Festival in January 1985, their first theatre show, sub-titled, &quot;Juggling With A Social Conscience&quot;.

They subsequently toured internationally for ten years playing in theatres notable to Africa, South America, Australia and extensively in Europe. Their show under the joint Artistic Direction of David Spathaky and Sue Broadway combined the ethos of &#x27;alternative&#x27; comedy of the 1980 with a 1970s revival of circus skills, variously called &#x27;Neo-circus or new variety by them or contemporary circus&#x27; by other people, it largely promoted a reinvention of circus focusing on human skill and generally without presenting animal acts. Their background in street performing, The Amazing Mendezies and in the influential Circus Oz (of which Sue Broadway was a founding member) gave the show an irreverent, fast-paced, avant-garde, surrealist feel.

== Productions ==

They produced several different shows and were occasionally given some financial support in the UK by the Arts Council and other grants. They also produced several large scale community shows, were touring two shows at the same time in the early 1990s and created jobs for more than twenty five people simultaneously during production periods.

They notably adhered to a political commitment of a balance of men and women on stage and off and of equal pay for all company members throughout their existence.

Shows included:

*Juggling With A Social Conscience.
*My Life on a Plate of Toast — Several versions - chamber circus 4 people on stage
*Domestic Bliss - a touring seven person theatre circus show
*Stop Laughing This Is Serious - touring 7-person theatre circus show
*Fabulous Beasts - touring seven-person theatre circus show
*Gravity Swing- touring seven-person theatre circus show
*Angels and Amazons - all-woman 3-person clown show
*Swan - a community circus
*White Snake - A large-scale community circus opera (50 performers) combining professional and non-professional performers, trainers from China, original libretto and commissioned music.
*Cabinet of Curiosities - A &#x27;chamber circus&#x27; - 4 people on stage
*Broadway Belles - All-women cabaret show
*The Mast - a site-specific outdoor aerial rig at the Albany Empire in Deptford and the Henley Regatta.
*The Plymouth Theatre Royal Cleaners - a commissioned intervention at a patrons&#x27; end of season party.

== Influence ==
Ra-Ra Zoo was influenced by the agitprop and political theatre of the late 1960s and early 70&#x27;s and the ritual theatre and &#x27;Happenings&#x27; associated with the time notably the &#x27;Grand Magic Circus&#x27;, &#x27;Circus Oz&#x27;, &#x27;The People Show&#x27;, &#x27;Cunning Stunts&#x27;, &#x27;The Festival of Fools&#x27; in Amsterdam and the German choreographer Pina Bausch. Political influence came from the 1970s wave of the feminist movement and direct action politics such as the protests at Greenham Common in the UK and the resurgence of &#x27;theatre&#x27; as political activism.

Ra-Ra Zoo influenced in turn many others as the company employed over a hundred people during its existence and played to many thousands of people worldwide. They spawned and encouraged, directly and indirectly, many offshoots including The Circus Space, (now NCCA) The Gandini Juggling Project, The Flying Gorillas, No Ordinary Angels, Le La Les, Broadway and Co., and Stretch People.

Founder Sue Broadway returned to lead Circus Oz as Artistic Director and helped direct the circus elements of the Sydney Olympics opening ceremony.

Founder Dave Spathaky was in semi retirement from 1994 but after surgery in 2008 is producing and occasionally performing as The Great Davido.
Founder Stephen Kent is a renowned musician and alongside his performing hosts a weekly radio show of world music.

Mark Digby and Ali Houiellebecq who met while in RRZ and formed &#x27;La le les&#x27; which toured successfully for many years.

Longtime member Lindsey Butcher, dancer, juggler and aerialist subsequently formed Gravity &amp; Levity.

Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala left Ra-Ra Zoo in 1992 to form the Gandini Juggling

==Media visibility==
Although generally politically opposed to recorded media, the company performed on television on programs for young people such as &quot;No. 73&quot;, &quot;Blue Peter&quot;, guest spots on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; and elsewhere. They also featured on a broadcast pilot for C4 with Spike Milligan &quot;The Last Laugh before TVAM&quot;. Dave Spathaky and Sue Broadway appeared together on TV shows worldwide, several times successfully beating their own world plate spinning record.

==Early days==
In early days they played on the emerging &#x27;New Variety&#x27; and alternative cabaret circuit and were the very first performers on stage at the newly reopened Hackney Empire in East London on 9 December 1986. They subsequently played several successful seasons there with their full-length shows.

==World touring==
Their extensive touring was sometimes partly funded by the British Council but also self-produced. They represented the UK at World Expos in Vancouver, Canada, in 1986 and in Brisbane, Australia, in 1988.

==Death or resurrection?==

Ra-Ra Zoo&#x27;s last full show to date &#x27;Cabinet of Curiosities&#x27; toured in 1993/4 and like their first full show (in 1995) was in the London International Mime Festival (in 1994), the last show of that tour was at the Liverpool Everyman also in 1994.

==Reprise==
In 2011 founders Dave Spathaky, Sue Broadway (with musician Thom Podgoretsky) performed at the Cork Midsummer Festival and the Glastonbury Festival but have currently no plans for new Ra-Ra Zoo productions in the pipelines but an online project in 2020 called &#x27;Clown Power Live&#x27; at: http://zoological.ie, during the anthropause, contain collaborative elements between Sue Broadway &amp; Dave Spathaky.

<text>Fuxingmen Outer Street () is a major street in urban Beijing. It forms part of the extended Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

It starts at Fuxing Road in the west and ends at Fuxingmen Bridge in the east.

It is a major commercial hub of Beijing, dwarfed only by its more eastern counterparts -- Xidan and Wangfujing.

The Chang&#x27;an Market lies in this location.

Until 2003, the nationwide committee building of the All-China National Trade Union sat along the street for 50 years until it was detonated and demolished. A new building is expected in a few years&#x27; time.

<text>Fuxing Road () is a road in western Beijing, China, forming part of the extended Chang&#x27;an Avenue.

The entire road lies within the confines of Haidian District. It is believed to run from Gongzhufen on the West 3rd Ring Road through to the West 5th Ring Road; however, maps indicate its path from Muxidi Bridge (just before the West 3rd Ring Road) to Yuquanlu (just after the West 4th Ring Road).

The Wukesong Indoor Stadium, a venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics, runs alongside the road. The venue has since then been renamed the &quot;MasterCard Center&quot;.

<text>Chaowai Subdisrict () is a subdistrict inside Chaoyang District, Beijing, China. It is bordering Sanlitun and Dongzhimen Subdistricts to the north, Hujialou Subdistrict to the east, Jianwai Subdistrict to the south, Dongsi, Chaoyangmen and Jianguomen Subdistricts to the west. Tt has a total population of 33,212 as of the 2020 census.

The name of this subdistrict refers to the area to the east (i.e. &quot;outside&quot; of) Chaoyangmen Gate of Ming city wall.

== History ==

== Administrative Division ==

As of 2021, there are 7 communities within the subdistrict:
== Landmarks ==
Four massive buildings—the Fulllink Tower, Union Plaza, China Life Tower and Prime Tower—sit along the southwestern part of the area. This is matched with a lot of residential high-rises in the northwest.

The northern central area is home to Dongyue Temple at Shenlu Road. The southern central area is full of even newer modern high-rise buildings, such as Chaowaimen, an office building which is nearing completion.

The northeastern area is home to a smorgasbord of banks, including a sizeable building belonging to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The southeastern part, meanwhile, is a technology hub, home to the Bainaohui complex, which has numerous PC-related shops. Next to Bainaohui is the well-known Landao Tower.

The Chaowai area overlaps with the Dongdaqiao crossing.

Chaowai is a hub for nightlife activity. Two KTV shops, plenty of restaurants, and the decor, make this part of the city appear like night doesn&#x27;t affect its activity. Meanwhile, the ongoing development continues throughout the night.

The Chaowai region has traffic problems of its own. Traffic on Chaoyangmen Outer Street is often congested, especially at peak times. Both ends of the Chaowai region are served by Beijing underground (the eastern end will soon be hooked up with Line 10 of the Beijing underground rail network).

Chaoyangmen Outer Street runs through the centre of the region.

<doc id="931479" wikidata="Q530957" url="?curid=931479" title="John Lone">
<text>John Lone (; born October 13, 1952) is a Chinese-American retired actor. He starred as Puyi in the Academy Award-winning film &quot;The Last Emperor&quot; (1987), for which he was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor.

A veteran of the East West Players, he appeared in numerous high-profile screen and stage roles throughout the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, in films like &quot;Iceman&quot;, &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, &quot;The Shadow&quot;, and &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot;. He was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Male for his performance in &quot;The Moderns&quot;.

==Biography==
Lone was born in 1952 as Ng Kwok-leung () in British-ruled Hong Kong.

He was raised in an orphanage and later adopted by a woman from Shanghai. At age 7, he was sent to train in the style of the Peking opera at Hong Kong&#x27;s Chin Chiu Academy, where he was trained in singing, dance, and classical Chinese theater techniques. It was here that he was given the name Johnny; he chose the surname Lone to reflect the fact that he was an orphan and for its similarity to Leung, part of his given name.

Lone declined an offer to join a Belgian dance company and a contract to make Kung fu films, and he accepted a sponsorship by an American family. He moved to Los Angeles and spent three years taking night classes at Santa Ana College to improve his English. In 1972, he married fellow student Nina Savino and gained American citizenship. They divorced in 1979. In 1978, he graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in Pasadena, California.

==Career==
Due to the lack of roles in Hollywood for people of East Asian descent at the time, Lone was often left to play minor parts on television. Lone was with the East West Players, an Asian-American theatre organization, for 10 years before Mako offered him a role as an Asian emigrant trying to assimilate in David Henry Hwang&#x27;s first play &quot;FOB.&quot; Lone starred alongside Tzi Ma and his performance garnered him an Obie Award in 1981.

One of his early film roles was as the cook in &quot;King Kong&quot;. His first major role in films was as the title character in &quot;Iceman&quot;. In 1985, John Lone played the gang leader Joey Tai in Michael Cimino&#x27;s &quot;Year of the Dragon&quot;, for which he was nominated the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Impressed by Lone&#x27;s performance, Cimino recommended Lone to his longtime friend Bernardo Bertolucci, who was casting for &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;. Bertolucci met Lone while casting in Los Angeles and chose him as Puyi at first sight. Lone portrayed Puyi at different stages of his life, from an 18-year-old to a man in his sixties. In preparation for his role, he visited China to study the body language of the elderly. He was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama at the 45th Golden Globe Awards in 1988 for his performance. He and Joan Chen presented the Academy Award for Best Documentary Short Film at the 1988 Academy Awards.

In 1987, David Henry Hwang and John Dexter were casting for Hwang&#x27;s play &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;. Hwang knew of Lone&#x27;s Peking opera training and thought of him for the part of Song Liling, an opera singer. He sent him a copy of the script, but Lone was too busy to respond. In 1991, David Cronenberg prepared to direct the film adaptation of &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, and invited Lone to play Song Liling. After a three-hour meeting with Cronenberg, Lone agreed to play Song. Lone did his own singing for the film. 

In the 1995 film &quot;The Hunted,&quot; Lone played assassin Kinjo alongside Christopher Lambert. Other international film appearances included the role of corrupt Hong Kong cop Ricky Tan in &quot;Rush Hour 2&quot; (2001) and the antagonist Shiwan Khan in &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994).

Lone&#x27;s focus then shifted to the Chinese market.&quot;&quot; He played the Qianlong Emperor in the 30-episode television drama series &quot;Qianlong and the Fragrant Concubine&quot; (乾隆与香妃) in 2004. He also appeared in the title role of Kangxi Emperor, in &quot;Records of Kangxi&#x27;s Travel Incognito&quot; (1998–2007), a Chinese television series about the Manchu-ruling Qing Empire monarch.

His most recent film role was 2007&#x27;s &quot;War&quot;, co-starring Jet Li and Jason Statham.

<text>Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (, &quot;ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase&quot;, &quot;UCH-L1&quot;) is a deubiquitinating enzyme.

== Function ==

UCH-L1 is a member of a gene family whose products hydrolyze small C-terminal adducts of ubiquitin to generate the ubiquitin monomer. Expression of UCH-L1 is highly specific to neurons and to cells of the diffuse neuroendocrine system and their tumors. It is abundantly present in all neurons (accounts for 1-2% of total brain protein), expressed specifically in neurons and testis/ovary.

The catalytic triad of UCH-L1 contains a cysteine at position 90, an aspartate at position 176, and a histidine at position 161 that are responsible for its hydrolase activity.

== Relevance to neurodegenerative disorders ==
A point mutation (I93M) in the gene encoding this protein is implicated as the cause of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in one German family, although this finding is controversial, as no other Parkinson&#x27;s disease patients with this mutation have been found.

Furthermore, a polymorphism (S18Y) in this gene has been found to be associated with a reduced risk for Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This polymorphism has specifically been shown to have antioxidant activity.

Another potentially protective function of UCH-L1 is its reported ability to stabilize monoubiquitin, an important component of the ubiquitin proteasome system. It is thought that by stabilizing the monomers of ubiquitin and thereby preventing their degradation, UCH-L1 increases the available pool of ubiquitin to be tagged onto proteins destined to be degraded by the proteasome.

The gene is also associated with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, and required for normal synaptic and cognitive function. Loss of Uchl1 increases the susceptibility of pancreatic beta-cells to programmed cell death, indicating that this protein plays a protective role in neuroendocrine cells and illustrating a link between diabetes and neurodegenerative diseases.

Patients with early-onset neurodegeneration in which the causative mutation was in the UCHL1 gene (specifically, the ubiquitin binding domain, E7A) display blindness, cerebellar ataxia, nystagmus, dorsal column dysfunction, and upper motor neuron dysfunction.

== Ectopic expression ==

Although UCH-L1 protein expression is specific to neurons and testis/ovary tissue, it has been found to be expressed in certain lung-tumor cell lines. This abnormal expression of UCH-L1 is implicated in cancer and has led to the designation of UCH-L1 as an oncogene.
Furthermore there is evidence that UCH-L1 might play a role in the pathogenesis of membranous glomerulonephritis as UCH-L1 de novo expression in podocytes was seen in PHN, the rat model of human mGN.
This UCH-L1 expression is thought to induce at least in part podocyte hypertrophy.

== Protein structure ==

Human UCH-L1 and the closely related protein UCHL3 have one of the most complicated knot structure yet discovered for a protein, with five knot crossings. It is speculated that a knot structure may increase a protein&#x27;s resistance to degradation in the proteasome.

The conformation of the UCH-L1 protein may also be an important indication of neuroprotection or pathology. For example, the UCH-L1 dimer has been shown to exhibit the potentially pathogenic ligase activity and may lead to the aforementioned increase in aggregation of α-synuclein. The S18Y polymorphism of UCH-L1 has been shown to be less-prone to dimerization.

== Interactions ==

Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 has been shown to interact with COP9 constitutive photomorphogenic homolog subunit 5.

UCH-L1 has also been shown to interact with α-synuclein, another protein implicated in the pathology of Parkinson disease. This activity is reported to be the result of its ubiquityl ligase activity which may be associated with the I93M pathogenic mutation in the gene.

Most recently, UCH-L1 has been demonstrated to interact with the E3 ligase, parkin. Parkin has been demonstrated to bind and ubiquitinylate UCH-L1 to promote lysosomal degradation of UCH-L1.

<text>Parkin is a 465-amino acid residue E3 ubiquitin ligase, a protein that in humans and mice is encoded by the &quot;PARK2&quot; gene. Parkin plays a critical role in ubiquitination – the process whereby molecules are covalently labelled with ubiquitin (Ub) and directed towards degradation in proteasomes or lysosomes. Ubiquitination involves the sequential action of three enzymes. First, an E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme binds to inactive Ub in eukaryotic cells via a thioester bond and mobilises it in an ATP-dependent process. Ub is then transferred to an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme before being conjugated to the target protein via an E3 ubiquitin ligase. There exists a multitude of E3 ligases, which differ in structure and substrate specificity to allow selective targeting of proteins to intracellular degradation.

In particular, parkin recognises proteins on the outer membrane of mitochondria upon cellular insult and mediates the clearance of damaged mitochondria via autophagy and proteasomal mechanisms. Parkin also enhances cell survival by suppressing both mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptosis. Mutations are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, leading to neuronal death in Parkinson&#x27;s disease and aberrant metabolism in tumourigenesis.

==Structure==
The precise function of parkin is unknown; however, the protein is a component of a multiprotein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex which in turn is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system that mediates the targeting of proteins for degradation. Mutations in this gene are known to cause a familial form of Parkinson&#x27;s disease known as autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson&#x27;s disease (AR-JP). Moreover, parkin is described to be necessary for mitophagy (autophagy of mitochondria).

However, how loss of function of the parkin protein leads to dopaminergic cell death in this disease is unclear. The prevailing hypothesis is that parkin helps degrade one or more proteins toxic to dopaminergic neurons. Putative substrates of parkin include synphilin-1, CDC-rel1, cyclin E, p38 tRNA synthase, Pael-R, synaptotagmin XI, sp22 and parkin itself (see also ubiquitin ligase). Additionally, parkin contains a C-terminal motif that binds PDZ domains. Parkin has been shown to associate in a PDZ dependent manner with the PDZ domain containing proteins CASK and PICK1.
Like other members of the RING-between-RING (RBR) family of E3 ligases, parkin possesses two RING finger domains and an in-between-RING (IBR) region. RING1 forms the binding site for E2 Ub-conjugating enzyme while RING2 contains the catalytic cysteine residue (Cys431) that cleaves Ub off E2 and transiently binds it to E3 via a thioester bond. Ub transfer is aided by neighbouring residues histidine His433, which accepts a proton from Cys431 to activate it, and glutamate Glu444, which is involved in autoubiquitination. Together these form the catalytic triad, whose assembly is required for parkin activation. Parkin also contains an N-terminal Ub-like domain (Ubl) for specific substrate recognition, a unique RING0 domain and a repressor (REP) region that tonically suppresses ligase activity.

Under resting conditions, the tightly coiled conformation of parkin renders it inactive, as access to the catalytic RING2 residue is sterically blocked by RING0, while the E2 binding domain on RING1 is occluded by Ubl and REP. Activating stimuli disrupt these interdomain interactions and induce parkin to collapse along the RING1-RING0 interface. The active site of RING2 is drawn towards E2-Ub bound to RING1, facilitating formation of the Ub-thioester intermediate. Parkin activation requires phosphorylation of serine Ser65 in Ubl by serine/threonine kinase, PINK1. Addition of a charged phosphate destabilises hydrophobic interactions between Ubl and neighbouring subregions, reducing autoinhibitory effects of this N-terminus domain. Ser65Ala missense mutations were found to ablate Ub-parkin binding whilst inhibiting parkin recruitment to damaged mitochondria. PINK1 also phosphorylates Ub at Ser65, accelerating its discharge from E2 and enhancing its affinity for parkin.

Although structural changes following phosphorylation are uncertain, crystallisation of parkin revealed a cationic pocket in RING0 formed by lysine and arginine residues Lys161, Arg163 and Lys211 that forms a putative phosphate binding site. Considering that RING0 is unique to parkin and that its hydrophobic interface with RING1 buries Cys431 in inactive parkin, targeting of phosphorylated Ub and/or Ubl towards this binding niche might be critical in dismantling autoinhibitory complexes during parkin activation.

==Function==

===Mitophagy===
Parkin plays a crucial role in mitophagy and clearance of reactive oxygen species. Mitophagy is the elimination of damaged mitochondria in autophagosomes, and is dependent on a positive feedback cycle involving synergistic action of parkin and PINK1. Following severe cellular insult, rundown of mitochondrial membrane potential prevents import of PINK1 into the mitochondrial matrix and causes it to aggregate on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM). Parkin is recruited to mitochondria following depolarisation and phosphorylated by PINK1, which simultaneously phosphorylates Ub pre-conjugated to mitochondrial membrane proteins. PINK1 and Ub phosphorylation facilitate parkin activation and further assembly of mono- and poly-Ub chains. Considering the proximity of these chains to PINK1, further phosphorylation of Ub at Ser65 is likely, potentiating parkin mobilisation and substrate ubiquitination in a self-reinforcing cycle.

Parkin substrates include mitofusins Mfn1 and Mfn2, which are large GTPases that promote mitochondria fusion into dynamic, tubular complexes that maximise efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. However, upon mitochondrial damage, degradation of fusion proteins is necessary to separate them from the network via mitochondrial fission and prevent the corruption of healthy mitochondria. Parkin is therefore required before mitophagy as it ubiquinates Mfn1/2, labelling it for proteasomal degradation. Proteomic studies identified additional OMM proteins as parkin substrates, including fission protein FIS, its adaptor TBC1D15 and translocase TOMM20 and TOMM70 that facilitate movement of proteins such as PINK1 across OMM. Miro (or RHOT1/RHOT2) is an OMM protein critical for axonal transport, and may be ubiquitinated and targeted towards proteasomal degradation by parkin. Miro breakdown produced a marked decrease in migration of compromised mitochondria along axons of mouse hippocampal neurons, reinforcing the importance of parkin in segregating defective mitochondria from their functioning counterparts and limiting the spatial spread of mitochondrial dysfunction, prior to autophagy.

During mitophagy, parkin targets VDAC1, a voltage-gated anion channel that undergoes a conformational change upon mitochondrial membrane depolarisation, exposing a cytosolic domain for ubiquitination. Silencing of VDAC1 expression in HeLa cells significantly reduced parkin recruitment to depolarised mitochondria and their subsequent clearance, highlighting the critical role of VDAC1 as a selective marker of mitochondrial damage and instigator of mitophagy. Following Ub conjugation, parkin recruits autophagy receptors such as p62, TAX1BP1 and CALCOCO2, facilitating assembly of autophagosomes that digest defective mitochondria.

===Cell survival===

Through activation of NF-κB signalling, parkin enhances survival and protects cells from stress-induced apoptosis. Upon cellular insult, parkin activates the catalytic HOIP subunit of another E3 ligase LUBAC. HOIP triggers assembly of linear Ub polymers on NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO), potentiating transcription of mitochondrial GTPase OPA1. Increased OPA1 translation maintains cristae structure and reduces cytochrome C release from mitochondria, inhibiting caspase-mediated apoptosis. Importantly, parkin activates HOIP with greater potency than other LUBAC-associated factors HOIL-1 and sharpin, meaning that parkin mobilisation significantly enhances tolerance to moderate stressors.

Parkin possesses DNA binding affinity and produces a dose-dependent reduction in transcription and activity of pro-apoptotic factor p53. Transfection of &quot;p53&quot; promoter with truncated versions of parkin into SH-SY5Y neurons revealed that parkin directly binds to the &quot;p53&quot; promoter via its RING1 domain. Conversely, parkin may be a transcriptional target of p53 in H460 lung cells, where it mediates the tumour suppressor action of p53. Considering its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, parkin aids p53 in maintaining mitochondrial respiration while limiting glucose uptake and lactate production, thus preventing onset of the Warburg effect during tumourigenesis. Parkin further elevates cytosolic glutathione levels and protects against oxidative stress, characterising it as a critical tumour suppressor with anti-glycolytic and antioxidant capabilities.

==Clinical significance==

===Parkinson&#x27;s disease===
PARK2 (OMIM *602544) is the parkin gene that may cause a form of autosomal recessive juvenile Parkinson disease (OMIM 600116) due to a mutation in the parkin protein. This form of genetic mutation may be one of the most common known genetic causes of early-onset Parkinson disease. In one study of patients with onset of Parkinson disease prior to age 40 (10% of all PD patients), 18% had parkin mutations, with 5% homozygous mutations. Patients with an autosomal recessive family history of parkinsonism are much more likely to carry parkin mutations if age at onset is less than 20 (80% vs. 28% with onset over age 40).

Patients with parkin mutations (PARK2) do not have Lewy bodies. Such patients develop a syndrome that closely resembles the sporadic form of PD; however, they tend to develop symptoms at a much younger age.
In humans, loss-of-function mutations in parkin &quot;PARK2&quot; gene have been implicated in 50% of inherited and 15% of juvenile-onset sporadic forms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease (PD). While PD is traditionally regarded a late-onset neurodegenerative condition characterised by alpha-synuclein-enriched Lewy bodies, autosomal recessive PD due to parkin mutations is often early onset and lack the ubiquitinated protein deposits pathognomonic for sporadic PD. Parkin-mutant PD could also involve loss of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus alongside the hallmark degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, its symptoms resembles those of idiopathic PD, with patients presenting with resting tremors, postural instability and bradykinesia.

While mitochondria are essential for ATP generation in any eukaryotic cell, catecholaminergic neurons are particularly reliant on their proper function for clearance of reactive oxygen species produced by dopamine metabolism, and to supply high energy requirements of catecholamine synthesis. Their susceptibility to oxidative damage and metabolic stress render catecholaminergic neurons vulnerable to neurotoxicity associated with aberrant regulation of mitochondrial activity, as is postulated to occur in both inherited and idiopathic PD. For example, enhanced oxidative stress in neurons, skeletal muscle and platelets, corresponding with reduced activity of complex I in the electron transport chain were reported in PD patients, while deletions in the mitochondrial genome were found in the SNpc.

In accordance with its critical role in mitochondrial quality control, more than 120 pathogenic, PD-inducing mutations have been characterised on parkin. Such mutations may be hereditary or stochastic and are associated with structural instability, reduced catalytic efficiency and aberrant substrate binding and ubiquitination. Mutations can generally be categorised into three groups, depending on their location. Firstly, those clustered around Zn-coordinating residues on RING and IBR might compromise structural integrity and impair catalysis. A second class of mutations, including Thr240Arg, affect residues in and around the E2 binding site and alter autoinhibition of RING1 by REP. Finally, Cys431Phe and Gly430Asp mutations impair ligase activity at the catalytic site and significantly reduce parkin function.

The discovery of numerous non-mitochondrial parkin substrates reinforces the importance parkin in neuronal homeostasis, beyond its role in mitochondrial regulation. Potent neuroprotective abilities of parkin in attenuating dopaminergic neurotoxicity, mitochondrial swelling and excitotoxicity were demonstrated in cell cultures over-expressing parkin, although the existence of such mechanisms at physiological parkin levels &quot;in vivo&quot; is yet unconfirmed. Another parkin substrate, synphilin-1 (encoded by &quot;SNCAIP&quot;), is an alpha-synuclein interacting protein that is enriched in the core of Lewy bodies and ubiquitinated by parkin in a manner abolished by familial PD-associated mutations. Parkin might promote aggregation of alpha-synuclein and synphilin-1 into Lewy bodies, which are conjugated to Lys63-linked poly-Ub chains and directed towards autophagic degradation. Parkin mutations therefore inhibit this mechanism, leading to toxic accumulation of soluble proteins that overloads the proteasome. Protein aggregation triggers neuronal toxicity, whilst accounting for lack of ubiquitinated Lewy bodies in parkin-mutant PD. Similarly, native parkin reduces death of SH-SY5Y neurons by ubiquitinating other Lewy body constituents, such as the p38 subunit of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase complex and far upstream element-binding protein 1 through addition of Lys48-linked poly-Ub chains and directing them towards proteasomal degradation. Parkin also influences axonal transport and vesicle fusion through ubiquitination of tubulin and synaptotagmin XI (SYT11) respectively, giving it a modulatory role in synapse function.

Finally, parkin protects dopaminergic neurons from cytotoxicity induced by PD-mimetic 6-OHDA, mediated by suppression of neuronal p53 expression and its downstream activation of the apoptotic cascade. Several PD-associated parkin mutations are localised to RING1 and might impair its ability to bind and downregulate the &quot;p53&quot; promoter, leading to enhanced p53 expression. Parkin-mutant PD patients also exhibit a four-fold elevation in p53 immunoreactivity, insinuating that failure of parkin-mediated anti-apoptosis might be involved in etiology of PD.

===Tumourigenesis===
Consistent with parkin&#x27;s potent anti-tumourigenic abilities, negative mutations and deletions have been reported in various tumours. For example, &quot;PARK2&quot; copy number was reduced in 85% of glioblastoma samples while lung cancers were associated with heterozygous deletion of &quot;PARK2&quot; at 6q25-q27 locus. Parkin deficiency further diminished disease-free survival in infrared-irradiated mice without increasing tumour incidence rate, suggesting that parkin deficiencies increase susceptibility to tumour-promoting events, rather than initiating tumour formation. Similarly, chromosomal breaks in &quot;PARK2&quot; suppressed expression of afadin scaffold protein in breast cancer, thereby comprising epithelial integrity, enhancing metastatic potential and worsening overall prognosis. Haploinsufficient &quot;PARK2&quot; expression, either due to reduced copy number or DNA hypermethylation, was further detected in spontaneous colorectal cancer where it accelerated all stages of intestinal adenoma development in mouse models. Parkin is therefore a potent modulator of tumour progression, without directly instigating tumourigenesis.

<text>Robert Thomas Ducey (born May 24, 1965) is a Canadian former professional baseball outfielder who played for six teams in Major League Baseball (MLB). In 2020, Ducey was named hitting coach for the Fubon Guardians of the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL).

==Career==
Born in Toronto, Ontario and raised in Cambridge, Ducey graduated from Seminole Community College, and was first signed by the Toronto Blue Jays in . After playing in the Blue Jays&#x27; organization from to , he moved on to the California Angels (1992), Texas Rangers (–), Seattle Mariners (–), Philadelphia Phillies (–, 2000-) and Montreal Expos (2001), with a brief return to Toronto in 2000. He ended his 13-year major league career with a .242 batting average and 31 home runs in 703 games.

Ducey was part of a Major League anomaly in 2000, when he was traded by the Phillies to the Blue Jays on July 26 for minor league pitcher John Sneed, and was then traded by the Blue Jays back to the Phillies on August 7 for Mickey Morandini.

Ducey served as a designated hitter for Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics, which finished in fourth place. As a result, he became the first Canadian to have played for both of Canada&#x27;s MLB teams, Expos and Blue Jays, in addition to the Canadian Olympic team. Matt Stairs, Denis Boucher and Shawn Hill are the only other Canadian ballplayers to achieve such distinction.

Subsequently, Ducey spent one year each in the New York Yankees&#x27; and Expos organizations as a minor league hitting coach, before being hired in 2006 by the Blue Jays as a talent scout. His responsibilities included covering both the major and minor leagues, as well as spring training camp before moving to the Pacific Rim department. In October 2009, he was dismissed by then-new Jays general manager Alex Anthopoulos when coverage of Asia was not a priority for the organization.

Afterwards, Ducey was hired to scout for the Tampa Bay Rays in the 2011 season, then joined the Phillies minor league system in 2014, again serving as a hitting coach.

==Highlights==
In 1986, Ducey was honored with the prestigious Tip O&#x27;Neill Award, and later was inducted in the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 2013. Following his induction, Ducey joined Terry Puhl and Larry Walker as the only Canadian baseball players to achieve both of those milestones.

In between, Ducey gained induction into the Cambridge Sports Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Personal life==
Rob currently lives in Tarpon Springs, Florida, with his wife Yanitza and their sons Thomas and Aaron and their daughter Jenaka.

<text>Philip Leslie Graham (July 18, 1915 – August 3, 1963) was an American newspaperman. He served as publisher and later co-owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and its parent company, The Washington Post Company.

During his years with the Post Company, Graham helped &quot;The Washington Post&quot; grow from a struggling local paper to a national publication and the Post Company expand to own other newspapers as well as radio and television stations. He was married to Katharine Graham, a daughter of Eugene Meyer, the previous owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;.

Graham, who had bipolar disorder, died by suicide in 1963, after which Katharine took over as publisher, making her one of the first women in charge of a major American newspaper.

== Early life and education ==
Graham was born to a Lutheran family in Terry, South Dakota. He was raised in Miami where his father, Ernest R. (&quot;Cap&quot;) Graham, made a career in farming and real estate, and was elected to the State Senate. His mother, the former Florence Morris, had been a schoolteacher in the Black Hills of South Dakota. Graham was one of four children. One half brother, Bob Graham, was a former governor of the state of Florida (1979–1987) and a former United States Senator representing Florida from 1987 to 2005.

Graham attended Miami High School and graduated from the University of Florida in 1936, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, and from Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; and earned a &quot;magna cum laude&quot; degree, in 1939. Graham was a member of both Florida Blue Key and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Florida Upsilon chapter) and was both a fraternity brother and roommate of the late Senator George A. Smathers whom he had been close to since attending Miami High School with Smathers. In 1939–1940 he was law clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice Stanley F. Reed, and the following year he was clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter, who had been one of his professors at Harvard.

During World War II, Graham enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces as a private in 1942 and rose to the rank of major by war&#x27;s end. He worked as an assistant to William Donovan, head of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). In 1944 Graham was recruited into the &quot;Special Branch, a super-secret part of Intelligence, run by Colonel Al McCormick&quot;. He later worked under General George Kenney, commander of the Allied Air Forces in the Southwest Pacific. His wife followed him on military assignments to Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania up until 1945, when he went to the Pacific theater as an intelligence officer of the Far East Air Force, which was created in August 1944.

== Career at The Washington Post Company ==
In 1946, when his father-in-law, &quot;Washington Post&quot; publisher Eugene Meyer, was named the first president of the World Bank, he passed the position of publisher to Graham. When Meyer left the World Bank later that year, he took the title of chairman of the board of the Washington Post Company, leaving Graham as publisher.

In 1948, Meyer transferred his actual control of the Post Company stock (the company was privately owned) to his daughter and her husband. Katharine Graham received 30 percent as a gift. Phil received 70 percent of the stock, his purchase financed by his father-in-law. Meyer remained a close adviser to his son-in-law until his death in 1959, at which time Graham assumed the titles of President and Chairman of the Board of the Post company.

=== Leadership of company under Graham ===
* In 1949, the Post Company purchased a controlling ownership interest in Washington radio station WTOP, jointly owned with CBS. This marked the beginnings of the Post Company&#x27;s involvement in broadcasting. The following year the &quot;Post&quot;/CBS joint venture bought the CBS-affiliated television station in Washington, and changed the call letters to WTOP-TV (later WDVM-TV, and now WUSA-TV), and in 1953 the company bought WMBR radio and WMBR-TV (now WJXT) in Jacksonville, Florida. The company gained full ownership of the WTOP stations in 1954.
* In 1954, the Post Company bought the competing morning newspaper, the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;, for $8.5 million. The &quot;Post&quot; kept most of the &quot;Times-Herald&quot;&#x27;s advertising, features, columnists and comics — and most of its readers. It immediately jumped ahead of the &quot;Evening Star&quot;, the city&#x27;s prominent afternoon paper, in circulation, and in 1959, it passed the Star in advertising linage.
* In 1961, the Post Company purchased the controlling stock interest in &quot;Newsweek&quot; from the Vincent Astor Foundation. When the deal was closed in New York City, Graham wrote a check for $2,000,000 as a down payment on the $8,985,000 purchase price.
* In 1962, the Post Company again expanded into the magazine field by buying &quot;Art News&quot;, the most widely read monthly in the art field, and &quot;Portfolio&quot;, a hard-cover art quarterly, from Albert M. Frankfurter.

== Involvement in politics ==
While running the &quot;Washington Post&quot; and other parts of the Post Company, Graham played a backstage role in national and local politics.

In 1954, Graham was the leading force behind the founding of the Federal City Council, a highly influential group of business, civic, education, and other leaders interested in economic development in Washington, D.C.

In 1960, he helped persuade his friend John F. Kennedy to take Lyndon Johnson on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate, talking frequently to both during the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, California. During the 1960 campaign, he wrote the drafts for several speeches that Johnson gave. After Kennedy and Johnson were elected in November, he successfully lobbied for the appointment of Douglas Dillon as Secretary of the Treasury, and frequently discussed other appointments with Kennedy. In the years after Kennedy&#x27;s inauguration, he wrote occasional drafts of speeches, primarily for Johnson, but also for the President and for Robert F. Kennedy.

In 1961, Kennedy named Graham to serve as an incorporator for the Communications Satellite Corporation, known as COMSAT, a joint venture between the private sector and government for satellite communications. In October 1961, he was appointed chairman of the group.

== Mental health problems and death ==

In Katharine Graham&#x27;s book &quot;Personal History&quot;, she notes that her husband was always intense and spontaneous, but occasionally lapsed into periods of depression. In 1957, he had a severe manic episode and, at the time, no medicines were available for effective treatment. He retired to the couple&#x27;s farm in Marshall, Virginia, to recuperate. Thereafter, periods in which he functioned brilliantly alternated with periods in which he was morose and erratic and isolated himself. He often drank heavily (something he had done prior to 1957), and would become extremely argumentative and blunt.

Through the Post Company&#x27;s &quot;Newsweek&quot; arm, Graham eventually met Australian journalist Robin Webb, and in 1962 they began an affair. In 1963, he and Webb flew to Arizona; he appeared at a newspaper publishing convention inebriated and/or manic. At the microphone he made a number of provocative comments, including the revelation that Kennedy was sleeping with Mary Pinchot Meyer. His assistant, James Truitt, called for his doctor, Leslie Farber, who flew in by private jet, as did (subsequently) Graham&#x27;s wife. Graham was sedated, bound in a straitjacket, and flown back to Washington. He was committed for five days to Chestnut Lodge, a psychiatric hospital in Rockville, Maryland.

Graham then left his wife for Robin Webb, announced to his friends that he planned to divorce his wife and immediately remarry, and indicated that he wanted to purchase sole control of the Post Company. In June, in a fit of depression, he broke off his affair and returned home. On June 20, 1963, he entered Chestnut Lodge for the second time, and was formally diagnosed with manic depression (now called bipolar disorder). He was treated with psychotherapy.

Graham later made repeated requests of his doctors to be allowed a short stay away from the hospital, and was &quot;quite noticeably much better&quot;, according to his wife. On August 3, 1963, he was permitted to go to their farmhouse in Virginia, Glen Welby, for the weekend. There, Graham killed himself with a shotgun while his wife was in another part of the retreat. His body was found in a bathroom about 1:00 pm. He was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Washington, D.C.
During probate, Katharine Graham&#x27;s lawyer challenged the legality of her husband&#x27;s last will, written in 1963 in favor of his mistress. Edward Bennett Williams testified that Graham had not been of sound mind when he had instructed Williams to draw up his final will. Williams said that he had, at the same time he prepared the will, written a memorandum for the file stating that Graham was mentally ill, and that he was preparing the will at Graham&#x27;s direction only to maintain their relationship. The judge in the case ruled that Graham had died intestate. A compromise was eventually reached whereby Katharine Graham gave up part of her inheritance in favor of her children.

== Posthumous honors ==
On March 16, 1970, the ABC affiliate station in Miami, Florida (then WLBW-TV), changed their call letters to honor Phil to WPLG-TV; The Washington Post Company (later called Post-Newsweek Stations, and now known as the Graham Media Group) owned the station until it was sold to Berkshire Hathaway in 2014.

== &quot;First rough draft of history&quot; ==

In April 1963, Graham delivered a speech to the overseas correspondents of &quot;Newsweek&quot; in London:

The phrase &quot;first rough draft of history&quot; may have been popularized by Graham, but it did not originate with him. It had been used repeatedly in the &quot;Post&quot; in the 1940s and the earliest known use was by Alan Barth: &quot;News is only the first rough draft of history,&quot; and earlier expressions of similar sentiments dating to the first decade of the 20th century.

== Personal life ==
On June 5, 1940, he married Katharine Meyer, a daughter of Eugene Meyer, a multi-millionaire and the owner of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, then a struggling newspaper. The couple settled down in a two-story row house.

Their first baby died at birth. Four children followed: Elizabeth (&#x27;Lally&#x27;) Morris Graham, now Weymouth (born July 3, 1943), Donald Edward Graham (born April 22, 1945), William Welsh Graham (1948–2017), and Stephen Meyer Graham (born 1952).

<doc id="931527" wikidata="Q36866" url="?curid=931527" title="Bình Dương province">
<text>Bình Dương is a province of Vietnam. It is located in the Southeast region of the country and the Southern Key Economic Zone, bordering Bình Phước province to the north, Ho Chi Minh City (Sài Gòn) to the south and southwest, Tây Ninh province to the west, and Đồng Nai province to the east. The province was created from Sông Bé province on 1 January 1997.

Bình Dương is considered to be the gateway to Ho Chi Minh City, the economic cultural centre and most populous city of the country. Endowed with convenient geography conditions, Bình Dương has an extremely important road network. Major highways of the country cross Bình Dương such as Ho Chi Minh Highway, National Route 13 and 14, Ho Chi Minh City Ring Road 3 and 4, Ho Chi Minh City–Chơn Thành–Hoa Lư Expressway and the Trans-Asian Highway (AH1, AH17) with other major provincial roads. Bình Dương is only from Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport and important ports in the southern part of the province and in the northern part is under . All of the advantages create favourable conditions to achieve social and economic development.

==Geography==
Bình Dương province is situated on relatively level terrain, and is crossed by the Saigon, Đồng Nai, and Bé rivers. It also has some hills. Bình Dương can be seen from the Lái Thiêu central church. Although Bình Dương is flat, it is higher than Ho Chi Minh City. Across Bình Dương there are many different topographic regions, including low mountainous terrain with slight undulation, flat plains and alluvial valleys. There are some low mountains, including Châu Thới in Dĩ An and Cậu mountain (also called Lấp Vò) in Dầu Tiếng district and some low hills. Natural effects have created many different types of landform including worn areas, accumulative areas (due to the deposition of corrosive materials in the flow) and some areas that are worn, accumulative and depositional at the same time. This is due to rainfall and the flow affecting the ground, with the effects of wind, temperature, climate, the erosion and collapse due to gravity of the geology. The impact took place over millions of years.

===Climate===
Bình Dương&#x27;s climate, like the climate of the rest of the Southeast region, is hot and rainy, with high humidity. It has a tropical monsoon climate, divided into two distinct dry and wet seasons. The rainy season usually starts in May and lasts until late October. In the early months of the rainy season, there are regular short but heavy showers, while July, August, and September usually have continuous rain, sometimes lasting for 1–2 days. Bình Dương seldom experiences typhoons and is only otherwise affected by local storms. The average annual temperature in Bình Dương is , with the highest temperature recorded reaching , but the overnight low can fall to . In the dry season, the average annual humidity is between 76–80%, with the highest at 86% in September and the lowest at 66% in February. The average rainfall each year is 1,800–2,000 mm, but rainfall at Sở Sao crossroads in Bình Dương regularly measures up to 2,113.3 mm.

==Demographics==
Originally, the area now known as Bình Dương was heavily forested, and was dominated by peoples of the Xtiêng, Chơ Ro, Mnong, and Khmer Krom ethnic groups. In the 17th century, however, ethnic Vietnamese settlers arrived in the region from the east. Most were peasants, seeking to escape poverty by gaining land of their own. There were also a number of refugees from a war between two feudal houses. In 1698, there were enough people in the area that a prominent Vietnamese general was sent to establish official institutions and enforce law. From that point, Bình Dương developed rapidly, with extensive clearance of forests to make room for crops. The province is now dominated by ethnic Vietnamese.

==Administrative divisions==
Bình Dương is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:

* Four districts:
** Bàu Bàng
** Bắc Tân Uyên
** Dầu Tiếng
** Phú Giáo
* Five provincial cities:
** Thủ Dầu Một (capital)
** Dĩ An
** Thuận An
** Tân Uyên 
** Bến Cát

They are further subdivided into four commune-level towns (or townlets), 42 communes, and 45 wards.

==Economy==
The area is considered to be good cropland, and agriculture is an important industry in the province. Bình Dương is also home to a significant manufacturing industry, and in the first half of 2004, the province had the second highest levels of foreign investment in Vietnam. Nike, Adidas, H&amp;M, Lego, McDonald&#x27;s, etc. have set up factories to manufacture goods they sell locally and abroad in the province. The southern cities Dĩ An and Thuận An of the province are highly urbanised and are now encompassed within the Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area.

In the first half of 2018, foreign investment in Bình Dương totaled US$850 million, more than 60% of the target. Since 2016, the province has attracted US$5.7 billion worth of FDI. At its current growth rate, Bình Dương will exceed the target of US$7 billion set for its 5-year plan until 2020. In 2019, Bình Dương has targeted a GRDP of 8.4–8.6% and a per capita income of VND140 million (more than US$6,030).

Thủ Dầu Một is the economic and administrative center of Bình Dương province. Located in the southern key economic region and the Ho Chi Minh City region, Thủ Dầu Một lies on HCM City&#x27;s radial arterial road and the HCM City-Thủ Dầu Một-Chơn Thành Expressway. The administration of Thủ Dầu Một has exerted efforts to increase the proportion of services and industry in the city.

Japan is currently the largest foreign investor among 64 countries and territories investing in the southern province of Bình Dương with 304 valid projects worth nearly US$5.7 billion.

== Transport ==
National Highway 13 is a vital strategic route in Vietnam&#x27;s road network. It originates in Ho Chi Minh City and stretches the entire length of Binh Phuoc province from south to north, connecting to Cambodia and onwards to the borders of Thailand and Laos. This highway holds immense strategic value for both military and economic purposes. National Highway 14, running from Tay Ninh through Dau Tieng to Chon Thanh, Dong Xoai, and Bu Dang in Binh Phuoc province, traverses the Central Highlands region. It serves as a crucial strategic route, both during times of war and in the pursuit of peaceful national development.

===Airway===
As of 2011, Phú Lợi Airport and Phú Giáo Airport were the only two remaining airports in the province; however, both are used for military reserve purposes. Bình Dương is located 10 to 15 kilometers from Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport.

=== Rail transport ===
Binh Duong province is home to two railway stations along the North-South Railway line: Song Than station and Di An station. As of June 5, 2019, Di An station has become the main passenger station, replacing Song Than due to its convenient location near residential areas and industrial parks. Consequently, the railway sector has discontinued passenger services at Song Than station. Previously, Binh Duong province was also served by the Saigon - Loc Ninh railway line, which connected at Di An station and facilitated the transportation of rubber latex from Binh Phuoc province.

=== Becamex Tokyu Bus === 
The Becamex Tokyu Bus is a public transportation service launched as part of a joint venture between Vietnam&#x27;s Becamex IDC Corporation and Japan&#x27;s Tokyu Corporation. This bus system operates in the Bình Dương province, primarily serving Bình Dương New City. Since its inception in 2014, the Becamex Tokyu Bus has played a crucial role in providing sustainable, eco-friendly public transport, connecting residential areas, commercial centers, and industrial parks. The bus system is part of the larger urban development plan, reducing traffic congestion and promoting the use of public transport in this rapidly developing region. It also enhances accessibility for both local workers and residents, contributing to Bình Dương’s ongoing economic growth and urbanization.

<text>Jason Royce Dickson (born March 30, 1973) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher.

Dickson is a graduate of Northeastern Oklahoma A&amp;M College. He played for the Somerset Patriots and was drafted by the California Angels in the 6th round of the 1994 MLB Amateur Draft. He was part of Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics which finished in fourth place.

Called up to the California Angels squad on August 21, 1996, the first batter he faced was Derek Jeter, who homered off Dickson&#x27;s third Major League pitch. Dickson was named to the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game as a 24-year-old representing the Anaheim Angels. He finished his first full season with 13 wins and a 4.29 ERA but struggled the next year, going 10–10 with a 6.05 ERA. Over four seasons in the majors, Dickson had a 26–25 record and 4.99 career ERA. However, injuries all but nullified his once promising career. In 1996, he won the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame&#x27;s Tip O&#x27;Neill Award.

Raised in Miramichi, New Brunswick, Dickson has been a supporter of the New Brunswick Liberals and campaigned for them in the 2003 election. It was reported in the March 7, 2006 &quot;Times &amp; Transcript&quot; where he was considering running for the Liberals in the next provincial election. He ran for and lost the right to run for the Liberals in the riding of Miramichi-Bay du Vin at a May 28, 2006 nominating convention placing third in a field of four candidates with 91 of 531 total votes.

He is now a pitcher for the Chatham Ironmen of the New Brunswick Senior Baseball League. On June 22, 2016, he was acclaimed as Baseball Canada President at the organization&#x27;s Annual General Meeting in Toronto.

<text>USS &quot;Helm&quot; (DD-388) was a &quot;Bagley&quot;-class destroyer in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Rear Admiral James Meredith Helm. &quot;Helm&quot; received 11 battle stars for her World War II service in the Pacific.

==Pre-war==
&quot;Helm&quot; was launched by Norfolk Navy Yard on 27 May 1937; sponsored by Mrs. J. M. Helm, widow; and commissioned on 16 October 1937, with Lt. Comdr. P. H. Talbot in command.

After shakedown, &quot;Helm&quot; operated in the Caribbean until March 1938. Following summer exercises, she was attached to the newly formed Atlantic Squadron on 1 October 1938. Early in 1939, she deployed with Carrier Division 2 in the Caribbean for Fleet Problem XX. After being transferred to the West Coast in May 1939, &quot;Helm&quot; engaged in fleet exercises and screening maneuvers out of San Diego and the Hawaiian Islands.

==Pearl Harbor==
At 0755 on the morning of 7 December 1941, &quot;Helm&quot; had just turned into West Loch in Pearl Harbor, en route to deperming buoys, when Japanese carrier planes attacked the naval base. &quot;Helm&quot; was the only ship under way at the beginning of the attack. The destroyer manned her guns and brought down at least one of the attackers while she was strafed and slightly damaged by two bombs close aboard. At 0817, through the flames and smoke, &quot;Helm&quot; left West Loch Channel and sped to the open sea through the Pearl Harbor Inlet. As she left the channel, a lookout on board spotted a Japanese miniature submarine, &quot;HA. 19&quot;, snagged on a reef. &quot;Helm&quot; turned hard right toward the enemy submarine, shot and missed. The two-man sub broke free and submerged but it snagged again. Trying to escape from the sub, one crewman drowned. The other was washed ashore and became the United States&#x27; first World War II prisoner of war. After the attack, &quot;Helm&quot; joined the task group of carrier USS &quot;Saratoga&quot;, just arrived from San Diego, and served as a screening ship and anti-aircraft guard.

==1942==
The destroyer sailed 20 January 1942 on a special mission to rescue Department of the Interior workers from Howland and Baker islands. Using her whaleboat &quot;Helm&quot; brought off six men from the two islands 31 January. She was attacked by a Japanese patrol bomber later that day. Her gunners drove off the attacker and the ship returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 February.

===New Hebrides operations===
Following a round trip voyage to San Diego, &quot;Helm&quot; departed Pearl Harbor 15 March 1942, escorting an advance base party to the New Hebrides. She arrived at Efate on 19 March and for the next few weeks escorted ships in that area while U.S. bases were consolidated. She rescued 13 survivors from SS &quot;John Adams&quot; on 9 and 4 May from the oiler &quot;Neosho&quot;, sunk in the Battle of the Coral Sea on 17 May. These men were taken to Brisbane, Australia, where &quot;Helm&quot; joined the Australian-US Task Force 44, under Rear Admiral Victor Crutchley, on 19 May.

For the next two months &quot;Helm&quot;, performed escort duty along the Australian Coast. The fleet was then assembling for the first offensive amphibious operation in the Pacific, the capture of Guadalcanal. &quot;Helm&quot; departed Auckland, New Zealand, on 22 July for the Fiji Islands. Following practice landings Admiral Turner&#x27;s fleet suddenly struck Guadalcanal and Tulagi, arriving off the beaches on 7 August and catching the Japanese completely by surprise. The destroyer screened the transports as troops disembarked, shooting down several attacking aircraft during the first two days.

===Battle of Savo Island===
With the cruisers &quot;Vincennes&quot;, &quot;Quincy&quot;, and , &quot;Helm&quot; patrolled the waters around Savo Island the night of 7 August and, as night fell on 8 August, the four ships and destroyer &quot;Wilson&quot; took up patrol between Savo and Florida Islands. Another group of two cruisers and two destroyers patrolled to the south, and picket destroyers &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Ralph Talbot&quot; were stationed to the northwest of Savo Island. Poor planning and decision-making had allowed Admiral Mikawa&#x27;s cruisers and destroyers to approach Savo Island undetected. Failures in search and identification had prevented early analysis of the dangerous situation, and the inadequate two-ship screen off Savo Island had not warned of the Japanese ships. The alarm was sounded by destroyer &quot;Patterson&quot; at about 01:43, just seconds before two torpedoes ripped into HMAS &quot;Canberra&quot; in the southern group. Soon both formations of cruisers were battling the fierce Japanese attack. &quot;Helm&quot;, on the port bow of &quot;Vincennes&quot;, turned back to help the stricken cruisers. She stood by &quot;Astoria&quot;, brought survivors to transports off Guadalcanal, and withdrew with the remainder of the force to Nouméa on 13 August. The Battle of Savo Island was a disaster, but the Japanese failed to press their attack on the defenseless transports at Guadalcanal. Much desperate fighting followed but the Americans had come to stay.

For the next few weeks &quot;Helm&quot; remained in the dangerous waters near Guadalcanal, escorting transports and patrolling. She sailed to Brisbane on 7 September and departed the next day to provide escort protection for transports between Australia and New Guinea.

==1943==
The veteran destroyer remained on this duty for some months. On 15 May 1943, &quot;Helm&quot; assisted in the search for survivors from the Australian hospital ship &quot;Centaur&quot; that had been torpedoed and sunk by Japanese submarine I-177, south east of Cape Moreton, near Brisbane. Later it escorted LST&#x27;s to Woodlark Island for an unopposed landing in June 1943 and protected the important base at Milne Bay. As MacArthur&#x27;s army prepared to move into New Britain under naval cover, &quot;Helm&quot; bombarded Gasmata on 29 November 1943 and sortied from Milne Bay again on 14 December under Admiral Crutchley for the capture of Cape Gloucester. &quot;Helm&quot; helped in the pre-invasion bombardment, fired close-support missions after the initial landings, and performed screening duties as transports unloaded. The operation by Admiral Barbey&#x27;s VII Amphibious Corps was a smooth and successful one and, as soon as the position was secured, &quot;Helm&quot; and the rest of Admiral Crutchley&#x27;s fleet moved to Saidor, where Admiral Barbey performed one of his famous amphibious &quot;hops.&quot; The destroyer screened the cruiser force as it prevented attack by surface and air forces from seaward.

==1944==
&quot;Helm&quot; continued her escort duty in the Guadalcanal and Milne Bay areas until departing on 19 February 1944 for Pearl Harbor. The ship proceeded thence to Mare Island Navy Yard escorting the battleship &quot;Maryland&quot;, and arrived on 4 March.

&quot;Helm&quot; departed San Francisco on 5 May 1944. After arrival in Pearl Harbor five days later she engaged in refresher training in Hawaiian waters. She arrived Majuro on 4 June and Kwajalein on 7 June to join the naval force assembling for the next step in America&#x27;s amphibious sweep across the Pacific, the invasion of the Marianas. She joined Vice Admiral Mitscher&#x27;s famed Task Force 58 and sailed with it from Kwajalein on 7 June. The fast carrier group guarded the western approaches to the islands from 11 to 13 June and provided air support for the landings, which were carried out by Admiral Kelly Turner&#x27;s amphibian group 1,000 miles from the nearest advance base at Eniwetok. The carrier task forces returned from a strike on the Bonin Islands on 18 June and deployed to repel the Japanese fleet as it closed the Marianas for a decisive naval battle. The great fleets approached each other on 19 June for the biggest carrier engagement of the war. As four large air raids hit the American fleet formation, fighter cover from &quot;Helm&quot;&#x27;s task group and surface fire from the ships annihilated the Japanese planes. With able assistance from American submarines, Mitscher succeeded in sinking two Japanese carriers while inflicting such staggering losses on the enemy naval air arm that the battle was dubbed the &quot;Marianas Turkey Shoot.&quot; Admiral Spruance had succeeded in protecting the invasion force in a battle the importance of which was well understood by the Japanese. Admiral Toyoda had said on 15 June: &quot;The fate of the Empire rests on this one battle,&quot; repeating the words of Admiral Togo at the Battle of Tsushima.

Following the decisive Battle of the Philippine Sea, &quot;Helm&quot; and the fast carriers turned their attention to neutralizing the enemy bases on the Bonin and Volcano Islands and supporting the invasion of Guam. The mobile carrier groups, screened by destroyers and cruisers, also began attacks on the Palau Islands on 25 July 1944. With occasional respite at Eniwetok or Ulithi, the carriers attacked Iwo Jima and other islands in the western Pacific until well into September. &quot;Helm&quot; sank a small Japanese freighter off Iwo Jima on 2 September and later that day surprised and sank a small cargo ship.

&quot;Helm&quot; and her carrier group arrived in Seeadler Harbor on 21 September 1944. They sortied again on 24 September; and, after ground support strikes in the Palaus, rendezvoused with the entire task force of seventeen carriers with their supporting and screening vessels for an important sweep to the west. Strikes were launched against Okinawa on 10 October; after which the carriers turned to their real objective, the airfields and military installations on Formosa. In a devastating 3-day attack carrier planes did much to destroy that island as a supporting base for the Japanese in the battle of the Philippines and other invasions to come. Enemy planes retaliated with heavy and repeated land-based attacks. &quot;Helm&quot; brought down one bomber with her 5-inch guns on 13 October and assisted in shooting down several more.

Following the Formosa Air Battle, a convincing demonstration of the power and mobility of sea power, Task Force 38 returned to the east coast of Luzon to strike enemy air bases in the Philippines to neutralize Japanese air power during the invasion of Leyte. By 24 October it was clear that the assault on Leyte had called forth one final effort on the part of the Japanese to destroy the American fleet. Its three major fleet units moved toward the Philippines. The Northern Group was to lure the American carriers northward away from Leyte, before the others converged on the assault area in Leyte Gulf for a two-pronged death blow. In for the historic Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Helm&quot; with Rear Admiral Davison&#x27;s Task Group 38.4 turned her attention toward Admiral Kurita&#x27;s Center Force. Planes from the carriers struck the Japanese ships near mid-day in the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, sinking giant battleship &quot;Musashi&quot; and damaging other heavy ships.

While two of the other phases of this great battle, the Battle off Samar and the Battle of Surigao Strait, were being fought, Admiral Halsey took the bait and led the carrier groups north to engage the decoy fleet of Admiral Ozawa. Screened by &quot;Helm&quot; and other surface units, the carriers made air contact on 25 October and, in a series of devastating strikes, sank four Japanese carriers and a destroyer. The great sea battle was thus ended, with the invasion of Leyte secured and the Japanese fleet no longer an effective fighting unit.

&quot;Helm&quot; and the carriers resumed direct support of ground operations on Leyte on 26 October. In addition to air attacks by land-based Japanese aircraft, the group also experienced submarine attack on 28 October. &quot;Helm&quot; and companion destroyer &quot;Gridley&quot; made a contact around noon and, as the carriers cleared the area, the two ships dropped depth charges and sank &quot;I-46&quot;. Two carriers, &quot;Franklin&quot; and &quot;Belleau Wood&quot;, were damaged on 30 October by suicide planes. That night the group retired toward Ulithi, where it arrived on 2 November after over two months of almost continuous service.

Departing Ulithi again on 5 November 1944, &quot;Helm&quot; and her carrier group returned to the Philippines for strikes against Japanese shipping and shore targets, returning on 20 November. &quot;Helm&quot; was then detached from Task Group 38.4 and steamed from Ulithi for Manus on 20 November. Arriving two days later, the ship began preparations for the next important amphibious operation in the Philippine campaign, the landings at Lingayen Gulf on Luzon. &quot;Helm&quot; departed on 27 December with a large task group bound for Lingayen Gulf.

==1945==
As the ships entered the Sulu Sea, heavy air attacks began. The Japanese struck with suicide planes on 4 January 1945 and sank escort carrier &quot;Ommaney Bay&quot;. Gunfire from &quot;Helm&quot; and the other screening ships took a heavy toll of the attackers. From 6 to 17 January the destroyer operated with carriers west of Lingayen Gulf providing air support for these important landings. The ships departed on 17 January and arrived in Ulithi six days later.

As the great naval task force assembled for the invasion of Iwo Jima, next stop on the island road to Japan, &quot;Helm&quot; sailed on 12 February in the screen of a group of escort carriers, arriving off the volcanic island fortress on 16 February. She screened the carriers during the preliminary strikes and protected them while they lent close support to the invasion, which began on the 19th. The carrier groups were hit repeatedly by desperate air attacks, with &quot;Helm&quot; and the other destroyers accounting for many suicide and torpedo planes. When escort carrier &quot;Bismarck Sea&quot; was sunk in a suicide attack on 21 February, &quot;Helm&quot; rescued survivors and brought them to the transport anchorage next day.

The veteran destroyer continued screening operations off Iwo Jima until 7 March when she steamed toward Leyte for repairs. She was soon underway again, however, for the last and largest of the Pacific amphibious operations, the invasion of Okinawa. Sailing on 27 March, she joined escort carrier groups off the island for pre-invasion strikes; and, after the historic assault on 1 April, for ground support operations. During her stay off Okinawa the destroyer shot down many suicide planes which menaced the carriers during fanatical, last-ditch efforts by the Japanese to repel the invasion. &quot;Helm&quot; steamed to Leyte on 19 June with Okinawa secured.

==Post-war==
Following the Okinawa operation &quot;Helm&quot; served as an escort and patrol ship out of Ulithi and Leyte, and helped to search for survivors of ill-fated &quot;Indianapolis&quot; from 3 to 6 August 1945. The ship was steaming toward Ulithi from Okinawa when the war ended on 15 August. She returned to Okinawa and finally to Iwo Jima to join the Bonins patrol, for air-sea rescue work until 8 September. The destroyer then sailed to Sasebo, Japan, where she served as shipping guide and patrol vessel until returning to Okinawa on 26 September. After another stay in Japan, the ship departed for Pearl Harbor and San Diego on 29 October.

She returned to the United States on 19 November, then sailed back to Pearl Harbor where she was decommissioned on 26 June 1946. &quot;Helm&quot; was used that summer as a target ship during the historic Operation Crossroads atomic tests in the Pacific, and her hulk was sold to Moore Dry Dock Co., Oakland, California, in October 1947 for scrapping.

<text>The Battle of the Sexes is a game where male and female contestants challenge each other on trivia questions. The principle of the game is to demonstrate the imbalance between male and female genders as they compete. The concept was created by Perth radio announcer Paul Redman.

== History ==
The game initially began as a regular call-in radio contest, whereby one male and one female contestant would compete answering trivia questions. A leaderboard by gender was kept from day-to-day. The concept spread to Austereo&#x27;s affiliated radio stations across Australia, including FOX FM&#x27;s Tracy Bartram and Matt Tilley. The segment became a daily staple of the 2Day FM Morning Crew with Wendy Harmer.

In 1998, the concept was adapted into a short-lived television show on Network Ten hosted by Ed Phillips. It only lasted for two series with the girls winning them both (25-24 and 25-21). The number of episodes depended on the number of wins it took to 25.

The concept lives on in radio, as well as in a series of board games which allow the game to be played at home. It has also been adopted by MTV, uniting cast members from &quot;The Real World&quot; and &quot;Road Rules&quot; for a chance at money.

<doc id="931540" wikidata="Q668349" url="?curid=931540" title="Kylix">
<text>In the pottery of ancient Greece, a kylix ( , ; ; also spelled &quot;cylix&quot;; : kylikes , ) is the most common type of cup in the period, usually associated with the drinking of wine. The cup often consists of a rounded base and a thin stem under a basin. The cup is accompanied by two handles on opposite sides.

The inner basin is often adorned in the bottom so that as the liquid is consumed an image is revealed; this adornment is usually in a circular frame and called a tondo. There are many variations of the kylikes, other cups available in the era include the skyphos, or the kantharoi. Kylikes were also popular exports, being the most common pottery import from Attica found in Etruscan settlements.

==Etymology==

The Greek word &quot;kylix&quot;, meaning &#x27;cup&#x27;, could refer to both a drinking vessel as well as the cup shape of a flower. It is possibly related to the Latin word &quot;calix&quot;, also meaning &#x27;cup&#x27;, and may have originally been borrowed from a non-Indo-European language. Kylix appears to in antiquity refer to the characteristic wide and short shape of the vessel and may have referred to many types of drinking vessels.

Some types of kylikes have their own names with their own etymology. One such variety is komast cups, where &quot;komast&quot; refers to the name of the type of drunken figures painted on them, which is characteristic of the style. Another uniquely named type is a Siana cup, which is named after a site in Rhodes where it was originally found. The last major variety that has a specific name is the Little-Master cup, which is translated from German which references the small scale of the adornments on the cup.

==Purpose==

Kylikes are most famous for their association with symposiums and wine, where the set of kylikes could match the &quot;kraters&quot;, which are the mixing vessels for diluting wine. These symposiums included various vessels for the preparation and drinking of wine and often were adorned with images of Dionysus and his worshippers. However, the images in the &quot;tondo&quot; contained a variety of themes meant to surprise and amuse the party guest.

One such theme is that of sailing, often adorning mixing vessels in the late 6th century, ships and other maritime scenes were popular, as there were comparisons made between symposiums and sailing in literature of the time. Other themes would include humorous designs, including on the base of the cup, such as the male genitals on the Bomford cup, a late 6th century kylix.

At symposiums the process of mixing the wine was completed by a master of ceremonies then passed around by a young male slave. The mixing of the wine and small drinking vessels are believed to possibly be an effort to allow a guest to enjoy his wine, but also avoid a drunken scandal, by encouraging moderation and lowering alcohol content. Thus the shape of the kylix may have been an ideal shape for not only displaying art, but also for the reclined positions that men would sit or lay in while drinking at symposiums. The short broad shape allowed for reclined drinking with minimal risk of spilling. The handles allowed the guests to play kottabos, where a guest would put their right index finger into one of the handles and attempt to fling the last of their wine into a target, often a container on a pedestal or floating in a pool, in order to win a prize.

==Subtypes==

There are many types of kylix that have been defined by archaeologists, often denoting a regional variance or chronological difference. One of the major features of early cups is if they have an offset lip or not, the lack of an offset lip means that if one were to place the cup on a flat surface the lip would be parallel to the surface the cup is set on rather than angled in some way.

Of the majorly chronological types there are types A, B and C. Type A developed in the late 6th century BCE and fade out of production by the early 5th century. This type is characterized by a smooth profile, lack of an offset lip and a wide, short stem. These cups also featured both red and black figure art, sometimes on the same cup called bilingual kylix.

Type B is very reminiscent of Type A, except the stems are thinner and has a more curved joining from the basin to the stem of the cup. This type is the most common found in Etruscan tombs.

Type C is less common than types A and B and sometimes has an offset lip and can have carving or molding on the base of the stem. However, they are less decorative than previous types and are often solid black in color and may only be decorated in the &quot;tondo&quot;.

For the stylistic and locational types continue to be definitions based on the presence of an offset lip as well as the types of decorations present on the cups. One such type is the komast cup developed in Athens and inspired by Corinthian pottery; it is defined by a narrow lip and sharp offset paired with a short, flared stem. This type is also defined with a decoration of drunken parties portrayed on the outside of the cup which grants this style its name.

Another type is the Siana cup; this style is known for its tall feet and lips when compared to the komast cups. They are also defined with a decorated &quot;tondo&quot; and are decorated in a style reminiscent of eastern Greek traditions. Their decorations can be large when compared to those of other types, often covering from foot to lip, or having layers of decoration to cover the outside of the cup. When compared to Little-Master cup, their basins are deeper and have a less defined lip.

Little-Master cups are named for the small details in their decorative elements, they are characterized by half globe basins and tall thin stems. They can often be divided into two more specific styles, lip cups and band cups. Lip cups have a more offset lip, often focusing on the lower parts of the cup. Band cups on the other hand are mostly black save for a band of decoration all around the cup often containing images of people. Stemless cups are known for their lack of stem and most surviving examples are plain black and lacking decoration.

==Decoration and construction==

Kylikes are most famous for their adornments; adorned kylikes were part of a set used for special occasions such as a symposium, the most common kylikes were of a solid color without adornment. If present, the &quot;tondo&quot; contains either black-figure or red-figure styles of the 6th and 5th century BC, and the outside was also often painted; an example of a &quot;tondo&quot; can be seen to the left. Black glaze type B kylikes appear to have been a popular export to Etruscan settlements and are not as commonly found in the Athens area, where it is believed they developed. This may suggest that these were made with the intention of exporting these kylikes.

Some of the earliest designs found on kylix include spiked flower designs and whorled shells. These designs could be paired with chevrons or dot designs between the whorls or spiked flowers to fill space, although this was more common with whorled designs. Later designs included the presence of roosters, which is believed to be reminiscent of the fact that an older man may gift a young man a rooster as a sign of love. It is debated if this is the reasoning behind the presence of roosters as cock fighting was also a common form of entertainment at the time, many other common symbols seen in the art of kylikes are similarly debated in meaning. At other times the meaning is less debated, as in some kylikes there are sexually explicit images portrayed as were scenes of parties. Many kylikes also drew from mythological stories in their art. A few of the more famous painters of the time were Onesimos, Makron, and Douris.

Ridged varieties of kylix have much more variety in shape and appear to have less consistent qualities of craftsmanship than those with smooth profiles. This may be due to smooth profiled kylikes being intended for more elite consumers who could pay for more carefully made and decorated pieces. Kylikes that had been polished or had their pores filled with slip made better drinking vessels as they did not absorb the liquid they contained. Most kylikes were made of ceramics however, but it is believed they were modeled after metal drinking vessels of the elite.

==Famous pieces==
Individual kylikes with articles include: 
*Arkesilas Cup, very unusual because it shows a then-living political figure, Arkesilaos II, king of Kyrene (died 550 BC). It is dated to about 565/560 BC, and is now in Paris.
*Dionysus Cup, famous for its painting, 540–530 BC. It is one of the masterpieces of the Attic black-figure potter Exekias and one of the most significant works in the Staatliche Antikensammlungen in Munich.
*Berlin Foundry Cup, a red-figure kylix from the early 5th century BC. It is the name vase of the Attic vase painter known conventionally as the Foundry Painter. Its most striking feature is the exterior depiction of activities in an Athenian bronze workshop or foundry. It is an important source on ancient Greek metal-working technology.
*Brygos cup of Würzburg, an Attic red-figure kylix from about 480 BC. It was made by the Brygos potter and painted by the man known as the Brygos Painter. Its symposium scenes are some of the best-known images of Greek pottery.

<text>The Ngonye Falls or Sioma Falls is a waterfall on the Zambezi river in Western province Zambia, near the town of Sioma and a few hundred kilometres upstream from the Victoria Falls. Situated in the southern part of Barotseland, the falls are a day&#x27;s journey by car from the capital, Lusaka. Their inaccessibility makes them much less known than Victoria Falls. The Ngonye Falls Community Partnership Park is located at the falls.

The falls are formed by the erosion of a hard sandstone layer to form the drop. Their height is only , but the width of the falls is impressive. They form a broad crescent, interrupted by rocky outcrops.

Upstream from the falls, the river is broad and shallow as it flows across the Kalahari sands, but below the falls extensive white water rapids exist, as the river is hemmed in by gorges cut into sandstone rock.

<doc id="931556" wikidata="Q7314296" url="?curid=931556" title="Reproduction fees">
<text>Reproduction fees are charged by image collections for the right to reproduce images in publications. This is not the same as a copyright fee, but is charged separately, as is the cost of the provision of the image. It can be charged where an image is out of copyright, and reflects the possession of the image by a collection.

Image collection charges vary according to the media (books, magazines, TV, Internet etc.), and print run. Some charge a lower fee for not-for-profit publications. In the case of the Web, none appear to grant use in perpetuity, but for small blocks of time — 3 months, 6 months, etc. Some institutions employ specialist firms to administer their copyrights and reproduction fees.

In recent years the money asked per image can be so great as to make the publication of limited-market topics un-viable, by the time the other production costs are factored in. This is likely to have a deleterious effect on the future health of specialist academic publishing worldwide. The expansion of public domain image resources appear to be the way of overcoming this problem.

On the other hand, the fees can help a collection to balance its finances.

<doc id="931585" wikidata="Q5354613" url="?curid=931585" title="Elections in Angola">
<text>Elections in Angola take place within the framework of a multi-party democracy. The National Assembly is directly elected by voters, while the leader of the party or coalition with the most seats in the National Assembly automatically becomes President.

==Electoral history==
Although Angola had sent representatives to the Portuguese Parliament in the early 19th century, it was not until the 1920s that the Portuguese authorities consented to the creation of a legislative body in the territory. In 1922 a Legislative Council was established, elected by Portuguese settlers. However, the council was suppressed following the 1926 coup in Portugal.

In 1955 a new Legislative Council was established, although only those officially classed as &quot;civilised&quot; were allowed to vote. This effectively limited the franchise to European settlers, most mulattos and a small number of Europeanised Africans (&quot;Assimilados&quot;). In May 1972 the Portuguese parliament passed the Organic Law for the Overseas Territories, which provided for greater autonomy for overseas territories; this created a 53-member Legislative Assembly for Angola, of which 32 would be elected, with the remainder nominated by public services, religious groups and business groups. Elections were held in March 1973, but due to continued restrictions on suffrage, only 584,000 people registered to vote out of a total population of 5,673,046. Around 86% of those registered cast votes, and the elected members included 29 Europeans and 24 Africans.

Following independence in 1975, the outbreak of the Angolan Civil War delayed the country&#x27;s first post-independence elections until 1980. By then, the MPLA had created a one-party state. It organised indirect elections, in which voters elected carefully vetted candidates to electoral colleges, who in turn elected the National Assembly. The next elections were due to be held in 1983, but they were delayed until 1986 due to the ongoing war. When they were held, it was under the same indirect system.

The Bicesse Accords ended the civil war in 1991 and saw the introduction of multi-party democracy. General elections were held in 1992, with the President being elected by the public for the first time. The MPLA won 129 of the 220 seats in the National Assembly, whilst UNITA emerged as the main opposition party with 70 seats. José Eduardo dos Santos of the MPLA and Jonas Savimbi of UNITA received the most votes in the first round of the presidential elections, but Savimbi claimed the election had been rigged, despite United Nations observers stating that they had been mostly free and fair. He refused to participate in the runoff, and restarted the civil war.

The civil war ended in 2002 following Savimbi&#x27;s death. However, elections were delayed until 2008. The MPLA received over 80% of the vote, winning 191 of the 220 seats in the National Assembly. Presidential elections were scheduled for 2009, but a new constitution promulgated in 2010 scrapped direct elections for the presidency, with the leader of the largest party in the National Assembly automatically becoming president. The next elections in 2012 saw another landslide victory for the MPLA, although their vote share was reduced to 72% and they lost 16 seats.

==Electoral system==

===President===
The 1992 constitution provided for the direct election of the president. However, this was abolished by the 2010 constitution, which in Article 109 states that &quot;the individual heading the national list of the political party or coalition of political parties that receives the most votes in the general election shall be elected President of the Republic and Head of the Executive&quot;.

===National Assembly===
The electoral system for the National Assembly is based on the electoral law passed on 1 November 1991. The 220 members are elected in two ways: 90 are elected from 18 five-seat constituencies and 130 from a single nationwide constituency, both using closed list proportional representation. The D&#x27;Hondt method is used for seat allocation in the provincial constituencies and a simple quota largest remainder method is used for the nationwide constituency.

Voters must be at least 18 years old and hold Angolan citizenship. They can be disqualified by having an undischarged bankruptcy or criminal conviction, being declared insane, or holding dual nationality. Candidates must be at least 35 years old and hold Angolan citizenship. Members of the government, judiciary and armed forces and chairs of boards of state-owned companies are ineligible for election.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics, five boxing events were contested. All of the boxing was conducted on 27 October. The event was held in the Northampton Institute in Clerkenwell, East London.

There were three rounds in each bout, with the first two rounds being three minutes long and the last one going four minutes. Two judges scored the match, giving 5 points to the better boxer in each of the first two rounds and 7 to the better boxer in the third round. Marks were given to the other boxer in proportion to how well he did compared to the better. If the judges were not agreed on a winner at the end of the bout, the referee could either choose the winner or order a fourth round.

<text>The abbey of Saint-Martin-du-Canigou (Catalan: &quot;Sant Martí del Canigó&quot;) is a monastery built in 1009 in the Pyrenees of Northern Catalonia on Canigou mountain in present-day southern France near the Spanish border.

Pau Casals wrote a composition entitled &quot;Sant Martí del Canigó&quot; for Orchestra.

==Location==
The monastery is located on the territory of the commune of Casteil, in the Pyrénées-Orientales &quot;département&quot;.

==History==
The original Romanesque style monastery was built from 1005 to 1009 by Guifred II, Count of Cerdanya (Fr. &quot;Cerdagne&quot;), in atonement for the murder of his son and was populated by Benedictine monks.

In 1050, Guifred II died at the monastery he had built after having become a monk there 15 years before. In 1051 a messenger set forth to visit religious houses throughout Europe to solicit prayers for Guifred. He brought a parchment, a mortuary roll, upon which at each stop were added words of prayer and respect. This parchment has survived and scholars (including Léopold Delisle with his &quot;Rouleaux des Morts du IX au XV Siecle&quot; of 1866) have used it to discover differences in culture between northern and southern Europe in a single given year. Some of the discoveries from this important document include that southern culture was more staid and bound by custom while the northern culture more free form and experimental in their writing styles, use of words and grammar.

The monastery was damaged in the Catalan earthquake of 1428.
The monastery was secularized in 1782 by Louis XVI. The monastery was abandoned by the monks in 1783-1785 and fell into disrepair.

During Reign of Terror in the years 1793-1794, the abbey was closed, and its contents scattered. The buildings were then transformed into a stone quarry for nearby residents, the capitals of the cloister were looted, as well as sculptures and furniture.

In 1902, the bishop of Elne and Perpignan, because of his Catalan background, began to restore the ruins radically, work that was completed in 1932. Today it is occupied by the Catholic Community of the Beatitudes.

==Buildings==

The abbey consists of two churches in the First Romanesque style; the lower church, dedicated to St. Mary, and the upper, dedicated to St. Martin. This building is indexed in the Base Mérimée, a database of architectural heritage maintained by the French Ministry of Culture, under the reference PA00103981.

*The lower church is predominantly black, and vault height rarely exceeds 3 meters. The eastern part (apses and adjacent bay) probably dates back to the consecration of 1009, while the rest of the building dates from the years 1010–1020, in conjunction with work after acquiring the relics of St. Ganders and new consecration of the church.
*The upper church was built between the years 1010-1020 (at the same time as the expansion of the lower church). Its construction required the strengthening of the columns of the lower church, which were enclosed in square piles. Similar to the lower church, the Saint-Martin church is composed of three naves separated by monolithic columns and barrel vaulted semicircular (except between the third and fourth bay, where the pair of support is cruciform in shape and arch supports). 
*The gatehouse is no longer than 19 meters after being damaged in the 1428 earthquake. It was never fully restored.

The rest of the convent buildings date from the early 20th century.

===The cloister===
Since the restorations of 1900-1920 it is difficult to imagine the original appearance of the cloister. 
The cloister once had two levels, the first built in the early 11th century and the second to the late 12th century. The lower level, which showed vaulted galleries and semicircular arches was bare of any decoration. Nowadays, there remain only three galleries that have been heavily restored, lacking their original character. The upper level, had marble capitals, which were scattered after the closure of the monastery during the French Revolution. The restoration recovered some, which were incorporated in the new southern gallery.

<text>ABKCO Music &amp; Records, Inc. (Allen &amp; Betty Klein Company) is an American independent record label, music publisher, and film and video production company. It owns and/or administers the rights to music by Sam Cooke, the Rolling Stones, the Animals, Herman&#x27;s Hermits, Marianne Faithfull, Dishwalla, the Kinks as well as the Cameo Parkway label, which includes recordings by such artists as Chubby Checker, Bobby Rydell, the Orlons, the Dovells, Question Mark &amp; the Mysterians, the Tymes and Dee Dee Sharp. Until 2009, ABKCO administered Philles Records and its master recordings, including hits by the Righteous Brothers, the Ronettes, the Crystals and others (via a licensing deal with EMI Music Publishing, which owned the Philles catalog since the mid-1990s). The label is infamous for its management contracts and lawsuits by its founder Allen Klein, the latter of which persisted until his death.

ABKCO Records is currently distributed by Universal Music Distribution, which also controls distribution of the Rolling Stones&#x27; post-ABKCO catalog through Polydor Records and Interscope Records.

In addition to music, ABKCO controls the rights to Alejandro Jodorowsky&#x27;s early films, including &quot;Fando y Lis&quot;, &quot;El Topo&quot;, and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;. Additionally, they served as a production company on Regina King’s 2020 film &quot;One Night in Miami&quot;, in which Sam Cooke is a central character.

Selected soundtrack releases from the label include the films &quot;Joy&quot;, &quot;Safety Not Guaranteed&quot;, &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot;, &quot;Fast Five&quot;, &quot;The Worlds End&quot;, &quot;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World&quot;, &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot;, &quot;The Men Who Stare At Goats&quot;, and the films of director Wes Anderson, starting from &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot; onwards. The label has also released soundtracks for the television shows &quot;Big Little Lies&quot;, &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, and &quot;Californication&quot;.

==History==
ABKCO is the successor company to a business that was founded in 1961 as Allen Klein &amp; Co. Allen Klein (1931–2009) was then a business manager specializing in music clients including Bobby Darin and Sam Cooke and, later, managed the Rolling Stones and the Beatles. ABKCO Industries was founded in 1968 as an umbrella company involved in management, music publishing, film, TV and theatrical production. (The acronym stood for &quot;Allen &amp; Betty Klein and COmpany,&quot; although Klein would often joke that it stood for &quot;A Better Kind of COmpany&quot;). Later that year, ABKCO acquired the Cameo-Parkway Records catalog along with a manufacturing facility which the company later used to produce records by several of its artists, including the Beatles and Rolling Stones.

The label had been heavily criticized by many fans for keeping the Cameo-Parkway material unavailable until 2005. ABKCO&#x27;s licensing policy prevented releasing the original version of songs for compilations. ABKCO sat on the entire catalog of music from artists such as Bobby Rydell and Chubby Checker. Some original artists had to re-record their hits for inclusion on bargain-basement oldies LP&#x27;s. Checker was forced to re-record his hits such as &quot;The Twist&quot;.

ABKCO is active in the release of compilations and reissues from its catalogs, film and commercial placement of its master recordings and music publishing properties. Jody Klein, president of ABKCO, has been credited in the liner notes of the recordings in not only getting the Cameo-Parkway recordings (which he partially owns) finally released, but also overseeing an extensive remastering of the Rolling Stones, the Animals, Herman’s Hermits, and Sam Cooke&#x27;s 1960s recordings. Allen Klein died in 2009.

==Lawsuits==
In January 1970, the Beatles signed a music publishing management contract with ABKCO Industries. At some point after the contract was terminated, ABKCO sued the group, a suit resolved in 1977 when the Beatles paid ABKCO $4.2 million; other ABKCO Beatles-related lawsuits continued for at least a decade.

One such case would include &quot;ABKCO Music, Inc. v. Harrisongs Music, Ltd.&quot; Former Beatle George Harrison (under Harrison Interests) was sued by Bright Tunes Music Corporation over the similarities between Harrison&#x27;s &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot; (by the Chiffons), the rights of which were owned by Bright Tunes. At the time, ABKCO was managing work released by Harrison, as well as other material by the Beatles, which meant that they were defendants in the case; that is, until ABKCO made a successful motion to acquire Bright Tunes and all of their copyrights, after years of negotiation. Another lawsuit was then initiated by ABKCO against Harrison Interests over the similarities between &quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;He&#x27;s So Fine&quot;. Eventually, the case was ruled as copyright infringement on the part of Harrison, which resulted in him paying damages for the infringement; however, ABKCO was also found guilty of breaching their fiduciary duty by purchasing Bright Tunes with intimate knowledge of the defendant&#x27;s defense in the case, indicating that ABKCO was withholding the earnings from their acquisition, which was to be paid to Harrison Interests with interest. The decision was appealed by both parties, but the district court&#x27;s decision was upheld by the appellate court.

ABKCO sued the Verve over their song &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, which samples the Andrew Oldham Orchestra recording of &quot;The Last Time&quot; by the Rolling Stones. In May 2019, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones handed back the rights to all future royalties of the songs to the Verve (having split ties with ABKCO Records).

In July 2008, ABKCO filed a lawsuit against Lil Wayne for copyright infringement and unfair competition, specifically referring to the track &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; on his album &quot;Tha Carter III&quot;. In the lawsuit, ABKCO claims that the song was obviously derived from the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Play with Fire&quot;, a song for which ABKCO owns the rights. As a result, &quot;Playing with Fire&quot; was removed from the online music track listings of &quot;Tha Carter III&quot; album.

==Pop culture references==
&quot;Beware of Darkness&quot; is a song by George Harrison that featured on his first post-Beatles album &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot;. When he was demo-ing this song for Phil Spector during 1970 he jokingly changed one line of the lyrics to &quot;Beware of ABKCO&quot;. This became the name of a 1994 bootleg album containing the recordings from that session.

<text>Robert Montgomery Bird (February 5, 1806 – January 23, 1854) was an American novelist, playwright, and physician.

==Early life and education==
Bird was born in New Castle, Delaware, on February 5, 1806. He was born into a pioneer family. His father was a prosperous partner in the firm of Bird and Riddle, Navy agents. Following the death of his father when Bird was four years old, his mother and brothers moved to Philadelphia, but he was taken in by a rich uncle, Nicholas Van Dyke, in New Castle. Bird then attended New Castle Academy, where he was encouraged to develop his musical skills. He later wrote that his school years were not pleasant. After attending the New Castle Academy and Germantown Academy, he graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1824. 

Bird started to write commentary on Latin, American, and English literature, particularly the Elizabethan playwrights. He then started to write short poems and fiction during his time in medical school. He had little passion for medicine. By 1827, he had published items in the &quot;Philadelphia Monthly Magazine&quot; along with two comedies, &quot;&#x27;Twas All for the Best&quot; and &quot;News of the Night&quot;. After graduating from medical school, he attempted to begin a medical practice, but became discouraged after one year and left medicine to pursue a literary career.

==Career==
In a small notebook labeled &quot;Useful Works- if well prepared,&quot; Bird set his goal to write nine biographies, thirty volumes of miscellaneous studies, three volumes of tales, some select novels of Boccaccio, the Arabian nights, eleven tragedies, twelve comedies, thirty three melodramas, and twenty-five novels. He did not approach his career casually. When he learned of Forrest&#x27;s contest, he entered. And, in 1828, Bird&#x27;s play &quot;Pelopidas&quot; won a $1000 prize offered by the actor Edwin Forrest, but was never produced because Forrest found the play unsuitable to highlight his strengths as a performer. With Forrest&#x27;s guidance, Bird wrote another play, &quot;The Gladiator&quot;, which was produced in 1831. It was perfect to showcase Forrest&#x27;s muscular acting style. It also went really well in the theatre. It was the first play to be performed so often in the author&#x27;s lifetime. This launched Bird as a playwright. Bird and Forrest quickly became friends. Bird wrote several other plays for Forrest, some of them being &quot;Oralloossa, Son of the Incas&quot; and &quot;The Broker of Bogota&quot;. Forrest had promised to pay Bird more for these plays if they proved successful. Though they were, Forrest refused to give Bird additional money. He did not want to share in his success (which must have been at least a hundred thousand dollars on &quot;Gladiator&quot; alone). Bird&#x27;s frustration with Forrest pushed him into writing novels. These include &quot;Calavar&quot; (1834), &quot;The Infidel&quot; (1835), &quot;The Hawks of Hawk-Hollow&quot; (1835), &quot;Sheppard Lee&quot; (1836), &quot;Nick of the Woods&quot; (1837) (his most successful novel), and &quot;The Adventures of Robin Day&quot; (1839). &quot;Calavar&quot; and &quot;The Infidel&quot; are notable for their graphic and accurate details and descriptions of Mexican history. In an 877-page study of American literature from the Revolutionary War through 1940, scholar Alexander Cowie found &quot;The Hawks of Hawk-Hollow&quot; second only to &quot;Logan&quot; by John Neal (1822) in its level of incoherence. His final novel was &quot;A Belated Revenge&quot;, and it was finished by his son, Frederick M. Bird (1889).

Bird also pursued a number of other interests. In 1837, he began a career as a journalist, working as the Associate Editor for &quot;The American Monthly Magazine.&quot; He became the editor of the &quot;North American Magazine and United States Gazette&quot; in 1847. He also taught medicine at the Pennsylvania Medical College and ran for Congress in 1842 (an attempt which was later aborted).

The five years from 1834 to 1839 were filled with too much activity: six novels and a part of a seventh, his marriage, the birth of his son, and his final bitter quarrel with Forrest. According to Christopher Looby, &quot;Bird&#x27;s biographers say that the intensity of these literary labors led to a breakdown of his health, possibly including a mental disorder, and that he retired to a farm on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1840 to restore himself.&quot;

In 1853, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

He then changed his occupation again. He became the Professor of the Institutes of Medicine and Materia Medica at the Pennsylvania Medical College in Philadelphia (1841–1843). During this period he met Senator John M. Clayton, became interested in politics, was a delegate to the Whig Convention in Baltimore in 1844, and in 1848 wrote a campaign biography of General Zachary Taylor. He then bought a third interest in the Philadelphia &quot;North American and United States Gazett&quot;. This was his final profession. He became ill in the early winter of 1853, and it was too late to seek remedy in a change of occupation. He died on January 23, 1854, of effusion of the brain. 

He is buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery in Philadelphia.

<text>At the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, nine wrestling events were contested, all for men. There were four weight classes in Greco-Roman wrestling and five weight classes in freestyle wrestling.

Greco-Roman reappeared for the first time since the 1896 Summer Olympics, with weight classes for the first time. The number of classes in freestyle was reduced from 7 to 5, with the light fly, fly, and welterweight classes dropped but the middleweight added. The addition of the 4 Greco-Roman classes brought the total number of events in wrestling up to 9.

<text>Thomas Blacklock (10 November 1721 – 7 July 1791) was a Scottish poet who went blind in infancy.

==Life==
He was born near Annan, Dumfriesshire (now Dumfries and Galloway), of humble parentage, and lost his sight as a result of smallpox when six months old. He began to write poetry at the age of 12, and studied for the Church. He was appointed minister of Kirkcudbright, but was objected to by the parishioners on account of his blindness, and gave up the presentation on receiving an annuity.

During the 1750s he was sponsored by the empiricist philosopher David Hume.

He then retired to Edinburgh, where he took in boarders and became a tutor, with considerable success. He studied divinity and was made D.D. in 1767 from the Marischal College (later part of the University of Aberdeen).

He published miscellaneous poems, some of which are preserved in the &quot;Village Hymns for Social Worship&quot; written by Asahel Nettleton and published in 1826. He is chiefly remembered for having written a letter in 1789 to Robert Burns, which had the effect of dissuading him from going to the West Indies, indirectly saving his life since the ship sank on the voyage. 

The building in which he lived (at the corner Chapel Street and West Nicolson) now contains two pubs: Peartree House and The Blind Poet (the walls of which are decorated with a number of Blacklock&#x27;s poems).

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Scottish Freemasonry in Journeymen Lodge of Dumfries, No.62, in 1754. The Lodge was renamed Thistle in 1803. Soon after moving to Edinburgh he Affiliated to Holyrood House (St. Luke&#x27;s), No.44, (Edinburgh), formally doing so on 18 April 1766. His Masonic relationship with his friend and fellow Freemason, Robert Burns, has been mentioned elsewhere but remains to be fully explored.

==Death==
He died at his home in Crichton Street (off Chapel Street), Edinburgh, and was buried in the adjacent churchyard of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel of Ease on Buccleuch Street. The grave lies on the west wall slightly to the north-west of the church.

<doc id="931637" wikidata="Q7648643" url="?curid=931637" title="Susanna Blamire">
<text>Susanna Blamire (12 January 1747 – 1794) was an English Romantic poet, sometimes known as &#x27;The Muse of Cumberland&#x27; because many of her poems represent rural life in the county and, therefore, provide a valuable contradistinction to those amongst the poems of William Wordsworth that regard the same subject, in addition to those of the other Lake Poets, especially those of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and in addition to those of Lord Byron, on whose &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot; her works may have had an influence. Blamire composed much of her poetry outside, sat beside a stream in her garden at Thackwood. She also played the guitar and the flageolet, both of which she used in the process of the composition of her poetry.

Blamire has been described as &#x27;unquestionably the greatest female poet of [the Romantic] age&#x27; and, by Jonathan Wordsworth, a great-nephew of William Wordsworth, &#x27;as important as the other Romantic poets writing during the eighteenth century&#x27;.

Blamire&#x27;s song &#x27;And Ye shall walk in silk attire&#x27;, referenced by Charles Dickens in &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; is well known. Her magnum opus is &quot;Stoklewath, or The Cumbrian Village&quot;.

==Life==
Blamire was born at Cardew Hall, near Cardew, Cumberland, on 12 January 1747. Her parents were William Blamire, a farmer who died in 1758, and Isabella Simpson of Stockdalewath who died in 1753. Left an orphan, she went to live with her mother&#x27;s sister Mary who farmed at Thackwood, Stockdalewath. She was educated at the Dame school at Raughton Head, before being privately tutored, at home, by masters from the Sebergham Grammar School, where the poet Joseph Relph had been Headmaster.

===Social milieu===
Her brother William, who married to a sister of John Christian Curwen was the father of William Blamire, who served as High Sheriff of Cumberland and MP for Cumberland. Another brother, Richard, was a bookseller in London who published many of William Gilpin&#x27;s work regarding the picturesque. Through these brothers, Susanna was introduced to the London literary milieu. Her sister married Colonel Graham of Gartmore, who was an officer in the Highland regiment, through whom she had contacts in Scotland. Susannah went as her sister&#x27;s companion on trips to The Scottish Highlands, London and Ireland
In Carlisle, Susanna encountered Catharine Gilpin of Scaleby Castle, who became a friend and possibly, according to Mandell Creighton, a co-author in verse. Through another aunt, Mrs Fell, who was a curates wife from Chilingham, Blamire befriended the aristocratic Tankerville family: there was talk of a possible marriage between her and the family&#x27;s eldest son, Lord Ossulton, but the social mores of the milieu prevented the same, and he was sent abroad. She remained unmarried. Blamire was also a friend of the philosopher William Paley.

===Illness and Death===

Blamire suffered from a recurrent and severe form of rheumatic heart disease, which killed her at the age of 47.

She died on 5 April 1794 in Carlisle and is buried by her own request at Raughton Head chapel.

==Works==
Blamire often composed her poetry beside a stream in the garden at her residence at Thackwood. She also played the guitar and the flageolet, which she sometimes played whilst composing. She circulated her work privately, and pinned it to trees, and little of it was published during her lifetime. However, some of her poetry was published in single sheets, anthologies, and magazines, during her lifetime. Anonymously, to the &quot;Scots Musical Museum&quot;, Blamire contributed songs in Lallans: &quot;What ails this Heart o&#x27; Mine?&quot;, and &quot;The Siller Croun&quot; (alias &quot;And ye shall walk in Silk Attire&quot;). With &quot;The Waefu&#x27; Heart&quot;, these three of her works were set to music by Joseph Haydn. These three songs were set to remarkably fitting music by Haydn and can be heard sung on CDs by &#x27;Haydn Trio Eisenstadt&#x27; with Lona Anderson, soprano: &#x27;The Siller Croun&#x27; (Hob.XXX1a:260; &#x27;The Waefu&#x27; Heart&#x27; (Hob.XXX1a:9/bis); &#x27;What Ails this Heart o&#x27; Mine&#x27; (Hob.XX1a:244). Haydn used a German translation of the three lyrics to understand their emotional tone and was given Susanna&#x27;s original English lyrics for the metre. He pitched the pathos of his music perfectly.

Her complete works were first compiled and published, by Patrick Maxwell of Edinburgh and Henry Lonsdale of Carlisle, in 1842, as &quot;The Poetical Works of Miss Susanna Blamire, The Muse of Cumberland&quot;. These two publishers had collected her manuscripts since 1836. Her corpus contains Gothic allegories in Standard English; songs in the Scots dialect, such as &quot;What ails this Heart o&#x27; Mine&quot;; songs in the Cumberland dialect, such as &#x27;Wey, Ned! Man!&#x27;, which are comparable to poems in the same dialect by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge in their &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;; colloquial epistles addressed to friends; and the use of heroic couplets, in &quot;Stoklewath or the Cumbrian Village&quot;, an intricate depiction of rural life that is her most accomplished poem. Patrick Maxwell, aforementioned, claimed that Blamire was &quot;unquestionably the best female writer of her age&quot;.

She has been credited with anticipating the Romantic conception of the world immortalized by William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Furthermore, her poem &quot;The Nun&#x27;s Return to the World [...]&quot; may have been an influence on Lord Byron&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of Chillon&quot;: Indeed, the late Professor Jonathan Wordsworth of St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in his lecture at the dedication service of Susanna&#x27;s bicentenary memorial tablet in Carlisle Cathedral on 20 March 1994, said: &#x27;We might be listening to Byron&#x27;s Prisoner of Chillon.&#x27; Some evidence for this attribution is as follows: Blamire&#x27;s half-sister, Bridget (1757-1832), offspring of Susanna Blamire&#x27;s father&#x27;s second marriage, took a huge interest in Susanna&#x27;s poetic manuscripts, some of which she had prepared for publication. She married George Brown, a lawyer and Freeman of the City of Newcastle-on-Tyne. Following his premature death in 1795, she established Newbottle School, at Houghton-le Spring, County Durham, six miles from Anabella Milbanke’s house in Seaham. It is quite possible that Byron could have read a manuscript or a transcript of Blamire&#x27;s poems whilst at Seaham Manor, immediately after his marriage to Milbanke in 1815. Also, Bridget&#x27;s son, William, (born 1787) was a tutor to Annabella until shortly after her marriage to Byron in 1815.

Another interesting connection was through Susanna&#x27;s niece Mary née Blamire and her husband, The Revd Thomas Young [my great x2 grandparents], who was educated with William Wordsworth at Hawkshead Grammar School and later was Senior Tutor at Trinity College, Cambridge (from 1806) during Byron&#x27;s time as an undergraduate there. Young came from a statesman&#x27;s family at Cumdivock, Near Carlisle, only three miles from The Blamire&#x27;s family house, The Oaks, at Dalston and six miles from Thackwood Manor, where Susanna and her nephew, William Blamire MP, High Sheriff and Chief Tithe Commissioner had lived. So, it is certainly possible that an academic like Young, living so closely in a rural community could have known of or read Susanna&#x27;s writings. The Byron scholar, Professor Jerome McGann, of the University of Virginia, believed: ‘It seems quite possible that Susanna’s poem was in Byron’s mind when he wrote The Prisoner of Chillon.’.

===Reception of Poetry===
Charles Dickens in his &quot;The Old Curiosity Shop&quot; (1841, end of chapter 66) had quoted its first two lines:

&quot; &#x27;Sir&#x27; said Dick (Swiveller), ... &#x27;we&#x27;ll make a scholar of the poor Marchioness yet! &quot;And she shall walk in silk attire, and siller have to spare,&quot; or may I never rise from this bed again!&#x27; &quot;.

Hugh MacDiarmid praised her in a radio broadcast in 1947, as &quot;this sweet Cumbrian singer&quot;. He insisted that her Scottish songs are &quot;the high-water mark of her achievement … so good that they can be set beside the best that have ever been produced by Scotsmen writing in their own tongue&quot;. Jonathan Wordsworth, a great-nephew of William Wordsworth, dubbed her, in 1994, &quot;The Poet of Friendship&quot;, predicting on BBC Radio Cumbria in 1998 that &quot;Susanna will eventually be seen as important as the other Romantic poets writing during the eighteenth century, and should be more widely read&quot;. In &quot;The New Penguin Book of Romantic Poetry&quot; he likened Blamire&#x27;s social position to that of Jane Austen:

‘the well-to-do maiden aunt’s life of good works and humorous observation&#x27;.

<text>Christopher Peter Mears (born January 20, 1978) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher and current coach who currently serves as the pitching rehab lead for the Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball (MLB). Mears previously played in MLB for the Detroit Tigers in 2003, and served as a pitching coordinator with the Boston Red Sox. As a player, the native of Ottawa, Ontario, threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed (13 stone, 8 pounds).

==Playing career==
Mears attended Lord Byng Secondary School in Vancouver, British Columbia, and was a fifth-round selection of the Seattle Mariners in the 1996 Major League Baseball draft. He spent seven seasons in the Mariners&#x27; farm system, making it as far as their Double-A San Antonio Missions farm club before drawing his release following the 2002 season. Shortly thereafter, Mears signed with the Detroit Tigers and opened 2003 with Detroit&#x27;s Triple-A team, the Toledo Mud Hens. He spent the first two months of the 2003 season in Toledo before having his contract purchased by the Tigers on June 29.

Mears spent his first nine weeks of big-league service in the Detroit bullpen, pitching fairly effectively and posting five saves. At the beginning of September, he was placed in Detroit&#x27;s starting rotation, but his starting tenure was short-lived. The 2003 Tigers, who finished with the worst record in baseball since the 1962 Mets, were desperate for reliable pitching, but Mears proved inadequate as a starter, never pitching more than 4 innings per outing and racking up an earned run average over 10. After three starts, he spent the remainder of the 2003 season in the Tigers bullpen. His season total of five saves tied him for the team lead with Franklyn Germán.

Mears was returned to the minor leagues by Detroit for the 2004 season, before being released at season&#x27;s end. He was part of Team Canada in the 2004 Summer Olympics, who finished in fourth place. Mears split 2005 between the Double-A affiliate of the St. Louis Cardinals and the Triple-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves before retiring following the season.

During his Major League career, Mears appeared in 29 games pitched and worked 41 innings, allowing 50 hits and 11 bases on balls. He struck out 21.

==Post-playing career==
In September 2015, Mears was promoted from being a Midwestern United States area scout to a role as the national pitching cross-checker for the Boston Red Sox. In January 2020, he was promoted to the role of pitching coordinator with the Red Sox.

On January 30, 2025, Mears was named the pitching rehab lead for the Cleveland Guardians.

<doc id="931651" wikidata="Q526994" url="?curid=931651" title="Mathilde Blind">
<text>Mathilde Blind (born Mathilda Cohen; 21 March 1841 – 26 November 1896), was a German-born English poet, fiction writer, biographer, essayist and critic. In the early 1870s she emerged as a pioneering female aesthete in a mostly male community of artists and writers. By the late 1880s she had become prominent among New Woman writers such as Vernon Lee (Violet Paget), Amy Levy, Mona Caird, Olive Schreiner, Rosamund Marriott Watson, and Katharine Tynan. She was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne, William Michael Rossetti, Amy Levy, Edith Nesbit, Arthur Symons and Arnold Bennett. Her much-discussed poem &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; presents a distinctly feminist response to the Darwinian theory of evolution.

==Early life==
Blind was born in Mannheim, Germany, the older child of a banker named Jacob Abraham Cohen and his second wife, born Friederike Ettlinger. She had a brother, Ferdinand, two half-brothers (Meyer Jacob &quot;Max&quot; Cohen, from his father&#x27;s first marriage, and Rudolf, from the marriage of Friederike and Karl Blind), and a half-sister, Ottilie, also from the marriage of Friederike and Karl Blind. Cohen died in 1848, the same year her mother remarried to Karl Blind, who was involved in the Baden insurrection of 1848. They immigrated to London in 1852, and it was around the time of the move that she took her stepfather&#x27;s name.

In London, Blind attended the Ladies&#x27; Institute, St John&#x27;s Wood, where she was a friend of future novelist Rosa Nouchette Carey. Much of the evidence for this period in Blind&#x27;s life is contained in a 55-page typescript in the British Library, a fragmentary story of a precocious, rebellious girl who is expelled from the Ladies&#x27; Institute for her freethinking, and who then travels to Switzerland for a long stay with maternal relatives in Zürich, before embarking on an unaccompanied walking tour through the Alps – highly unusual at that time for a single woman. The protagonist&#x27;s name in the typescript is Alma, but her experiences parallel closely those of Blind herself, and some of the names in the Zürich section of the narrative are those of people Blind actually knew in her adolescent years.

While in Switzerland she was barred as a woman from entry to lectures at the University of Zürich, but spent much time in the company of revolutionary colleagues of her mother and stepfather. She also took private lessons from the renowned philosopher and Sanscrit scholar Kuno Fischer. In 1854 Fischer had begun work on his &quot;History of Modern Philosophy: Descartes and His School&quot;, completed in 1865, which among other things had a direct influence on Friedrich Nietzsche. In Fischer&#x27;s account of Baruch Spinoza and his ideas, Nietzsche recognized a kindred philosophical spirit. The two philosophers share a radical philosophy of immanence and the negation of all transcendence, a philosophical outlook also shared by Ludwig Feuerbach and by David Strauss, whose &quot;The Old Faith and the New: A Confession&quot; Blind translated 23 years after studying with Fischer. All four thinkers, and the adult Blind, reject teleology – the idea that there is an end goal or ultimate purpose to things. For them the immanent world, devoid of inherent purpose, constitutes the horizon of being and the sole possible source of value. This philosophical outlook informs all of Blind&#x27;s writing, and caused the publisher of &quot;The Prophecy of St. Oran and Other Poems&quot;, Newman &amp; Co., to withdraw the book from circulation. As William Michael Rossetti wrote to Ford Madox Brown, Newman &amp; Co. &quot;had got frightened by somebody about the atheistic character of the book, and had determined to sell it no more&quot;.

In 1866, Blind&#x27;s brother Ferdinand failed in an attempt to assassinate Otto von Bismarck, then chancellor of the North German Confederation, and committed suicide in prison. He was motivated in part by his stepfather Karl Blind and other revolutionary exiles living in London, who were outraged by the way Bismarck treated the German states like pawns in his empire-building strategy. Many years later, Blind shared with her friend Moncure Conway the contents of a letter she had received from her brother in the spring of 1866. She and Ferdinand had been apart since 1864, when he left London in his 18th year to study in Germany. During his university years he also participated in the left-wing opposition to Bismarck, and after graduating in March 1866, during a hiking tour of Bavaria and Bohemia, he wrote to Blind describing the depth of his opposition to Bismarck: &quot;As I wandered through the blooming fields of Germany, that were so soon to be crushed under the iron heel of war and saw the number of youths pass by that were to lose their lives for the selfish aims of the few, the thought came quite spontaneously to punish the cause of so much evil, even if it were at the cost of my life.&quot; The first, pseudonymous volume of poetry she published in the wake of Ferdinand&#x27;s death (&quot;Poems&quot;, published by Claude Lake, 1867) is dedicated to her early mentor, the Italian revolutionary Giuseppe Mazzini, but the poems themselves also evoke the memory of Ferdinand. As James Diedrick remarked, the book &quot;gains both biographical and literary significance when viewed as a &#x27;double-voiced&#x27; volume that simultaneously celebrates Mazzini&#x27;s victorious republicanism and obliquely honors Ferdinand, his ghostly double, whose squandered idealism and sacrifice haunt the margins of its pages.&quot;

Blind&#x27;s early political affiliations were shaped by the foreign refugees who frequented her stepfather&#x27;s house, including Giuseppe Mazzini, for whom she entertained a passionate admiration and about whom she would publish reminiscences in the &quot;Fortnightly Review&quot; in 1891. Other revolutionaries who frequent her mother and stepfather&#x27;s house in St. John&#x27;s Wood included Karl Marx and Louis Blanc. Her early commitment to women&#x27;s suffrage was influenced by her mother&#x27;s friend Caroline Ashurst Stansfeld, who was active in the British feminist movement from its origins in the 1840s. These radical affiliations are manifested in Blind&#x27;s politically charged poetry, and in her own unbending commitment to reform. As Richard Garnett observed, in the society of political refugees and radicals Blind was raised in, &quot;admiration must necessarily be reserved for audacity in enterprise, fortitude in adversity... anything breathing unconquerable defiance of the powers that were.&quot;

==Career==
In the early 1870s, after abandoning the male pseudonym she used for her first volume of verse, Blind emerged as a force to be reckoned with in London&#x27;s literary bohemia. In early January 1870 she delivered a lecture on Percy Bysshe Shelley at the Church of Progress in London, stressing the poet&#x27;s political radicalism. In July of that year she published a review-essay on William Michael Rossetti&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Poetical Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot; in &quot;The Westminster Review&quot; that earned the praise of Algernon Charles Swinburne and gained her entry into a formerly all-male group of &quot;Shelleyites&quot; that included Swinburne, Rossetti, and Richard Garnett, a man who would remain Blind&#x27;s friend and literary adviser throughout her life. A year after this essay appeared, Blind began publishing poetry and nonfiction in &quot;Dark Blue&quot;, a new Oxford-based journal that during its short run published prose and art by many of Britain&#x27;s leading Pre-Raphaelites and aesthetes. Her wide-ranging publications in this journal are those of a daring feminist aesthete: she wrote sexually subversive poems about haunted lovers, an erudite essay on Icelandic poetry, and a short story exploring the corrosive effects of class divisions on human relations. In the fall of 1872, as her association with &quot;Dark Blue&quot; was ending, she began reviewing contemporary poetry and fiction for the &quot;Athenaeum&quot;, where over the next 15 years she passed judgement on a wide range of contemporary writers, ranging from William Morris to Margaret Oliphant. At the end of 1871 she published &quot;Selections from the Poems of Percy Bysshe Shelley&quot; for the Tauchnitz Collection of British Authors, containing an introductory &quot;Memoir&quot; of Shelley&#x27;s life. In the following year, she brought out her translation of David Strauss&#x27;s &quot;The Old Faith and the New: A Confession&quot;, which established her reputation as a daring freethinker, following in the footsteps of George Eliot, who had translated &quot;The Life of Jesus&quot; in 1853. The generic range of these early works (poetry, fiction, criticism, biography, translation), as well as their subject matter and themes (female autonomy and agency, anti-theism, aestheticism, the relationship of literary and political radicalism), indicates the aesthetic principles and themes that would characterize the remainder of Blind&#x27;s career, while emphasizing the cosmopolitan nature of her sensibility and outlook.

Despite her diverse literary interests, Blind remained devoted to poetry, as is evident in an 1869 letter to Richard Garnett: &quot;My only real intense life has been for a long time in writing, and when I cannot swim and float about in the enchanted waters of poetry I am like a fish out of water. I gasp and pant for want of the proper element to breathe in.&quot; Blind&#x27;s visits to Scotland in the 1870s and 1880s inspired two poems of considerable compass and ambition: the narrative poem &quot;The Prophecy of St. Oran&quot; (published in 1881, but written some years earlier) and &quot;The Heather on Fire&quot; (1886), a denunciation of the Highland clearances. Both are full of impassioned eloquence and energy, and &quot;The Prophecy&quot; in particular has an ample share of the quality Matthew Arnold called &quot;Celtic magic&quot;.

As Blind&#x27;s reputation as a poet began to rise in the 1880s, she undertook a number of other ambitious literary projects, including two highly praised biographies for the Eminent Women Series edited by John Henry Ingram. The first of these was also the first biography of the novelist George Eliot (1883; new edition 1888), and the second was a life of Madame Roland (1886), one of the leaders of the Girondins faction during the French Revolution. While writing the latter she lived mainly in Manchester, to be near the painter Ford Madox Brown (who was involved in decorating the town hall with frescoes) and his wife. Brown also painted Blind&#x27;s portrait during this period. Brown and Blind were emotionally intimate from the mid-1870s until Brown&#x27;s death in 1893, although this devotion caused considerable turmoil in his family.

Blind&#x27;s only novel, &quot;Tarantella&quot;, a prose romance, is a remarkable work in many ways, but was neither a commercial nor a popular success. Richard Garnett wrote that &quot;the fate of this remarkable book is one of the injustices of literature.&quot; Noting that &quot;it has an exciting story, interesting characters, ease and naturalness of dialogue,&quot; and &quot;is the receptacle of much of the writer&#x27;s most serious thought and intense personal feeling,&quot; Garnett attributes the novel&#x27;s failure to attract a wide audience to the preference for realism and the &quot;minute analysis of character&quot; in the mid-1880s. &quot;Tarantella&quot;, by contrast, &quot;is very romantic, very idealistic, very eloquent, and not in the least concerned with minutiae.&quot; Garnett concludes that &quot;now that the taste for romance has revived,&quot; Blind&#x27;s novel &quot;ought to have another chance of taking its rightful place.&quot; While the novel was translated into French in 1893, and reprinted in a single-volume format the same year by T. Fisher Unwin, its coexistence alongside similarly philosophical fictions, including Vernon Lee&#x27;s &quot;A Phantom Lover&quot; (1890), Olive Schreiner&#x27;s &quot;Dreams&quot; (1890), and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Portrait of Dorian Gray&quot; (1891), did not improve its fortunes.

In 1889, Blind published &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;, whose title poem is an ambitious response to Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution. The poem was widely reviewed and discussed and did much to enhance Blind&#x27;s reputation; in the 20 July issue of the &quot;Athenaeum&quot; the reviewer breathlessly reported that &quot;we have known her book to be read on the Underground Railway, and the reader to be so absorbed... as to be carried unawares several stations past his destination.&quot; The importance of this poem was later reinforced by an 1899 edition with an introduction by the evolutionary biologist Alfred Russel Wallace.

In 1890, Blind was the subject of a profile in &quot;Woman&quot;, the magazine that Arnold Bennett would write for and edit in the 1890s. &quot;A Chat With Mathilde Blind&quot; in the &quot;Notes on Notables&quot; section of the 3 July issue begins by stating that &quot;everyone familiar with the current thought and literature of the day knows the name of Mathilde Blind.&quot; The anonymous writer then praises in turn &quot;the admirable Life of Madame Roland... certainly the most graphic and accurate picture of the great revolutionary heroine ever penned in England, or, for that matter, in France,&quot; and Tarantella, a &quot;quaint, weird story, full of imagination and suggested thought.&quot; However, &quot;it is as a poetess that Miss Blind has scored her greatest triumphs,&quot; the writer continues, noting that the verses in &quot;The Prophecy of St. Oran and Other Poems&quot; &quot;made an instant mark, many of them becoming rapidly popular,&quot; and adding that &quot;&quot;The Heather on Fire&quot;, &#x27;The Sower&#x27;, &#x27;The Dead&#x27;, and &#x27;The Street Children&#x27;s Dance&#x27; are even now being constantly reprinted wherever the English language is read and spoken throughout the world.&quot; After recording that Blind considers &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot; her &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the writer describes the sensation caused by Blind&#x27;s translation of &quot;The Journal of Marie Bashkirtseff&quot; (1890), &quot;that strange laying bare of a woman&#x27;s soul, only to be compared in its nude intensity to the confessions of Jean Jacques Rousseau and &quot;Le Journal des Goncourt&quot;.&quot;

Blind travelled widely in Italy and Egypt in the early 1890s, partly drawn by the love of nature and antiquity and partly due to her failing health. The influence of these travels is manifest in &quot;Dramas in Miniature&quot; (1891), &quot;Songs and Sonnets&quot; (1893), and especially &quot;Birds of Passage&quot; (1895). Arnold Bennett&#x27;s pseudonymous review of &quot;Birds of Passage&quot; in the 22 May issue of &quot;Woman&quot;, when he was assistant editor of the magazine, indicates the quality of poetry Blind was writing just a few years before her death. &quot;Miss Blind sings in many modes—she is probably more various than any other woman-poet in English literature,&quot; Bennett writes, &quot;and in all her songs there is an original, intimately personal accent which one can catch, but not imprison within a paragraph.&quot; Bennett adds that Blind &quot;excels in lyric verse,&quot; noting that many of the poems in the new volume, including &quot;Prelude&quot; and &quot;A Fantasy&quot;, &quot;are distinguished achievements, and they show, I think, a more complete technique than anything even in &quot;Dramas in Miniature&quot;. While admiring the &quot;Songs of the Orient&quot; in the volume, Bennett concludes that &quot;for myself I would rather have her sing of England. Take the fine poem &#x27;Noonday Rest&#x27;, written on Hampstead Heath under the willows—&#x27;Sometimes they lose a leaf, which, flickering slow,/Faints on the sunburnt leas.&#x27; How wonderfully [this] suggests the intolerable heat of a scorching noon! This poem is perhaps the best in the book, a book that contains nothing trivial, nothing shallow, nothing that is not poetry.&quot;

Blind died in London on 26 November 1896, bequeathing to Newnham College, Cambridge, the greater part of her property, which had mostly come to her late in life as a legacy from a half-brother Meyer Jacob (&quot;Max&quot;) Cohen. She was cremated in Woking, and her ashes were later placed in a monument erected by a friend and sponsor, Ludwig Mond, and designed by Édouard Lantéri in St Pancras Cemetery.

==Assessment==
More recently Blind has attracted the attention of women&#x27;s literature scholars. As one website puts it, &quot;Her burning sense of political and social injustice runs like a unifying thread through her work. Her poetry combines great beauty of sound and image with vigorous narrative, delineation of character, emotional expressiveness, and engagement with intellectual ideas.&quot; The site mentions George Eliot, George Sand and Elizabeth Barrett Browning as her influences. Isobel Armstrong, re-evaluating the longer works, notably &quot;The Heather on Fire&quot; and &quot;The Ascent of Man&quot;&quot;, saw in them &quot;a gendered tradition in women&#x27;s poetry of the nineteenth century&quot;. She noted that Blind, by re-configuring &quot;a new myth of creativity and gender&quot;, demonstrated the best that this tradition could achieve in social and political analysis.

<doc id="931653" wikidata="Q255576" url="?curid=931653" title="Mountain nyala">
<text>The mountain nyala (Amharic: የተራራ ኒዮላ) (Tragelaphus buxtoni) or balbok, is a large antelope found in high altitude woodlands in a small part of central Ethiopia. It is a monotypic species (without any identified subspecies) first described by English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1910. The males are typically tall while females stand at the shoulder. Males weigh and females weigh . The coat is grey to brown, marked with two to five poorly defined white strips extending from the back to the underside, and a row of six to ten white spots. White markings are present on the face, throat and legs as well. Males have a short dark erect crest, about high, running along the middle of the back. Only males possess horns.

The mountain nyala are shy and elusive towards human beings. Four to five individuals may congregate for short intervals of time to form small herds. Males are not territorial. Primarily a browser, the mountain nyala may switch to grazing occasionally. Females start mating at two years of age, and males too become sexually mature by that time. Gestation lasts for eight to nine months, after which a single calf is born. The lifespan of a mountain nyala is around 15 to 20 years.

The typical habitat for the mountain nyala is composed of montane woodlands at an altitude of . Human settlement and large livestock population have forced the animal to occupy heath forests at an altitude of above . Mountain nyala are endemic to the Ethiopian highlands east of the Rift Valley, between 6°N and 10°N. Up to half of the total population of the mountain nyala occurs in the area of Gaysay, in the northern part of the Bale Mountains National Park. The mountain nyala has been classified under the Endangered category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). Their influence on Ethiopian culture is notable, with the mountain nyala being featured on the obverse of Ethiopian ten cents coins.

==Taxonomy==

The mountain nyala was first described by English naturalist Richard Lydekker in 1910. Its scientific name is &quot;Tragelaphus buxtoni&quot;. The species has been classified under the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; of the family Bovidae. The mountain nyala was first brought to England in 1908 by Major Ivor Buxton, after whom the species has been named. Major Buxton, who had returned from a hunting trip in Ethiopia, first presented a specimen he had shot to British taxidermist Rowland Ward, who later on notified Lydekker about the discovery. It was the last large antelope to be discovered in Africa. The spiral horns and white markings on the face and across the flanks established it as a species of &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;. Lydekker believed that the species was related more closely to the nyala (&quot;T. angasii&quot;) than to the two kudu species (then placed under the genus &quot;Strepsiceros&quot;). In fact, mountain nyala&#x27;s similarity to both &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; and &quot;Strepsiceros&quot; led to the merger of the latter into the former genus.

In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro of the University of KwaZulu-Natal (Durban) carried out a mitochondrial analysis of the nine &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The results showed that the mountain nyala is sister taxon to bushbuck (&quot;T. scriptus&quot;), sitatunga (&quot;T. spekii&quot;) and bongo (&quot;T. eurycerus&quot;) in the mitochondrial tree (phylogenetic relationships obtained using mitochondrial data). However, in the nuclear tree, bushbuck, mountain nyala and sitatunga plus the bongo are three equal branches. Hence the mountain nyala forms a monophyletic clade with these three species. The greater kudu clade split from the clade formed by mountain nyala, bongo, sitatunga and bushbuck approximately 8.6 million years ago.

==Description==

The mountain nyala is a large sexually dimorphic bovid. The head-and-body length is approximately in males and in females. The males are typically tall while females stand at the shoulder. Males weigh and females weigh . The bushy tail reaches the heel, and is long. The sensitive ears are large and lined with white hair.

The coat is grey to brown, marked with two to five poorly defined white strips extending from the back to the underside, and a row of six to ten white spots. White markings are present on the face, throat and legs as well. The white chevron between the eyes and the white patch on the throat are among the most conspicuous markings. The chest and the rump are white. The lower part of the legs are pale on the inside and clear white spots are present just above the hooves. The coat is fawn brown in male juveniles, and grows darker with age, eventually becoming charcoal in old bulls. Males have a short dark erect crest, about high, running along the middle of the back, from the neck to the tail. Coat texture may vary from smooth to rough, probably by season. Females resemble the red deer hind in size and proportions. Female juveniles are a bright rufous, and old females are as grey as young males. Females have two pairs of inguinal nipples.

Only males possess horns, whose maximum recorded length is . Horns appear as cream-coloured nubs at around six months and start growing in a spiral pattern, reaching full growth by two years. The horns have only one or two spirals, though a few males have been reported to have two-and-a-half turns. The final form might vary in different males – the horns could form well-defined spirals, or could diverge in a structure similar to a lyre, resembling the horns of an impala, but with the final spiral incomplete. Growth rings are visible on the horn sheaths, but the annual patterns might be difficult to comprehend. Though the horns might wear out with age, the cream colour of the tips persists.

The mountain nyala resembles the greater kudu in that both have an array of white spots along their flanks and possess spiral horns. However, the greater kudu can be told apart from the mountain nyala due to the former&#x27;s greater height and paler colour. Moreover, the horns in greater kudu have two to three spirals, and the tips are farther apart. Another species similar to the mountain nyala is the nyala, but the latter can be easily distinguished from the former due to its smaller size and a fringe of long hair along its throat and neck. The horns of nyala, though very similar, are slender and narrower.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The mountain nyala are shy and elusive towards human beings. They spend the night on the edges of forests, feeding part of the time. To avoid human disturbance, they choose to navigate at night. They come out in morning and late afternoon to browse in grasslands. They generally seek cover in woodlands and heather thickets when it is very hot or cold. Feeding may occur in midday, but is interspersed with resting intervals. They tend to come out when it is overcast or raining. In the dry season (November to March), given the dilapidated state of grasslands, the mountain nyala travel up to the wooden areas rich in ericaceous heath.

Four to five individuals may congregate for short intervals of time to form small herds. However, groups containing as many as 100 individuals have been reported from the Bale Zone, composed of several family units moving in and out periodically. Size and longevity of such large herds depends upon the season, habitat type and the time of the day. Female and juvenile groups have adult females accompanied by a calf of her previous year and another of the current year. These groups are led by adult males, depending on the presence of oestrus. Bachelor herds are formed by non-dominant adult bulls and young males, consisting of up to 13 individuals. Mixed sex groups may also be formed. Old bulls tend to lead a solitary life, though they may occasionally visit female herds looking for females in oestrus. Dominance hierarchies are observed in both sexes.

Males are not territorial, and have home ranges covering in the wet season. Females and juveniles, on the other hand, occupy much smaller ranges of about in the wet season. Dry season ranges are much larger than the wet season ones for both sexes. Males often wrestle using their horns. Though usually silent, the mountain nyala may &quot;cough&quot; noticing a potential threat, or utter a low bark if the threat is more serious. The leopard is the main predator of the mountain nyala.

===Diet===
Primarily a browser, the mountain nyala may switch to grazing occasionally. It feeds on low-height herbs, bushes, shrubs and general foliage. They might even eat lichens, ferns and aquatic plants. Grasses are specially preferred during the early wet season. They pick up fallen leaves and use their horns to reach higher branches. Favoured species include &quot;Artemisia afra&quot; (African wormwood), &quot;Hypericum revolutum&quot;, &quot;Kniphofia foliosa&quot;, &quot;Solanum sessilistellatum&quot; and &quot;Hagenia abyssinica&quot; leaves. They prefer &quot;Alchemilla rotti&quot;, &quot;Helichrysum splendidum&quot; and lower foliage of &quot;Lobelia rhynchopetalum&quot;.

===Reproduction===
Females start mating at two years of age, and males too become sexually mature by that time. Sexual dimorphism, larger home ranges for males, and a female-biased population indicate polygyny in the species. The mountain nyala breed throughout the year, but the peak occurs in December. Prior to and during the breeding season the adult males tend to get associated with mixed sex herds. Bulls continuously follow receptive females and test their vulvas. Three to four males may seek a single female, and, if equally ranked in hierarchy, may engage in circling displays. In these displays the males move very slowly and stiffly, with the crest on the back erect and the tail raised. They are less likely to engage in aggressive fights, which, if they happen, last only for a brief period. Flehmen follows vulva-testing.

Gestation lasts for eight to nine months, after which a single calf is born. In the Bale Mountains National Park, births occur throughout the year, but peak from September to November. Calves remain in cover for the first few weeks after birth. The calves remain close to their mothers for nearly two years. The young females may get pregnant by then. The young males, as they mature by two years, are challenged by other males and driven out of their herds. The lifespan of a mountain nyala is around 15 to 20 years.

==Habitat and distribution==

The typical habitat for the mountain nyala is composed of montane woodlands at an altitude of . The vegetation generally includes African juniper (&quot;Juniperus procera&quot;), &quot;Afrocarpus gracilior&quot;, and &quot;Olea&quot; at lower levels and &quot;Hagenia abyssinica&quot;, juniper, and &quot;Hypericum revolutum&quot; in the upper reaches. They often visit the edges of montane grasslands at , which is covered with &quot;Artemisia afra&quot;, &quot;Kniphofia&quot;, and evergreen &quot;Hypericum&quot; species.

Nowadays the continuous blocks of woodland habitat have been reduced to a series of pockets, interspersed in large cultivated lands. Human settlement and large livestock population have forced the animal to occupy heath forests at an altitude of above rich in &quot;Erica arborea&quot;, &quot;Erica trimera&quot;, &quot;Hypericum&quot;, &quot;Euphorbia&quot;, and &quot;Helichrysum&quot; species. They may even be forced into afroalpine grasslands containing &quot;Alchemilla&quot; and &quot;Festuca&quot; species, at an altitude of up to . In the eastern borders of its range, the mountain nyala has usually been observed to occupy areas at lower altitudes of about .

Mountain nyala are endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands east of the Rift Valley, between 6°N and 10°N. Their former range was from Mount Gara Muleta in the east to Shashamene and the northern Bale Zone to the south. Up to half of the total population of the mountain nyala occurs in the area of Gaysay, in the northern part of the Bale Mountains National Park. Smaller relict populations occur in Chercher, mountains such as Chilalo in Arsi Zone, and the western Bale. A study identified an area of on the southern escarpment of the Bale Mountains as the most sustainable habitat for the mountain nyala.

==Threats and conservation==

Major threats to the survival of the mountain nyala include illegal hunting, habitat destruction, encroachment by livestock, predation of calves by dogs, expansion of montane cultivation and construction at high altitudes. The animal is extensively hunted for its horns and meat. The meat is utilised in local medicine and for making nipples for traditional milk bottles. Impact of trophy hunting programs is obscure, and current trophy hunting quotas may be unsustainable in the long term although, if well regulated, trophy hunting could play an important role in the long term management of this species.

The mountain nyala has been classified under the Endangered category of the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). It has not been listed under the Washington Convention (CITES). Though legal protection has been fully ensured for the species, the implementation has not been so effective. In 1991, there was widespread unrest in Ethiopia during which several mountain nyala were killed and the population in the Bale Mountains National Park fell to 150. After the Bale Mountains National Park, the small Kuni-Muktar Mountain Nyala Sanctuary was established in 1990 was established as a second protected area. But by 1996 the sanctuary had been so severely affected by deforestation, poaching, cultivation and gully erosion, that the populations soon disappeared from there.

In the 1960s, the population was estimated at 7,000 to 8,000 (and perhaps up to 12,500). This declined sharply to 2,000 to 4,000 individuals in the 1980s. The population is decreasing even now. The mountain nyala is feared to be extinct in the eastern and southern extremes of its range, though a few probably survive in Chiro (Asebe Teferi) and the border between Bale and Sidamo, south of Kofele. Apart from Gaysay about 80 to 120 mountain nyala occur in the rest of the Bale Mountains National Park, and a few hundred occur in the areas in the vicinity of the national park.

==Relationship with humans==

The influence of the mountain nyala, as well as the nyala, on Ethiopian culture can not be ignored. Although nyala is a South African word, several prominent businesses such as Nyala Motors use it in their names. The nyala and mountain nyala often regularly appear on walls, commercial products and tourist curios. The mountain nyala is featured on the obverse of the Ethiopian ten cents coin.

Mountain nyala are hunted by humans, for instance, by the Oromo people. The Oromo do not hunt these animals in general, except for a day close to Easter, when all able-bodied men set out on horses for a hunt.

<text>John Bodenham (c. 1559–1610), an English anthologist, was the patron of some of the Elizabethan poetry anthologies.

==Life==
Bodenham was the eldest of the five children of William Bodnam, a London grocer, and Katherine Wanton of York.
He was educated at Merchant Taylors&#x27; School.

According to Arthur Henry Bullen in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Bodenham did not himself edit any of the Elizabethan miscellanies attributed to him by bibliographers. He simply projected the publication of them and befriended their editors.

<text>George Henry Boker (October 6, 1823 – January 2, 1890) was an American poet, playwright, and diplomat.

==Early years and education==
Boker was born in Philadelphia. His father was Charles S. Boker, a wealthy banker, whose financial expertise weathered the Girard National Bank through the panic years of 1838–40, and whose honour, impugned after his 1857 death, was defended many years later by his son in &quot;The Book of the Dead.&quot; Charles Boker was also a director of the Mechanics National Bank.

Boker was brought up in an atmosphere of ease and refinement, receiving his preparatory education in private schools, and entering Princeton University in 1840. While there he helped found, and was first editor of, the college literary magazine, the &quot;Nassau Monthly&quot; (now the &quot;Nassau Lit&quot;).

He was left in easy circumstances, and was able to devote his time to literature, as well as boxing and dancing.

Charles Godfrey Leland, a relative, recounted:

Boker graduated from Princeton in 1842. His marriage to Julia Riggs, of Maryland, followed shortly after, while he was studying law, a profession which was to serve him in good stead during his diplomatic years, but which he gave up for the stronger pull of poetry.

==Literary recognition==
In 1848 his first volume of verse, &quot;The Lessons of Life, and other Poems&quot;, was published.

Also, he met Bayard Taylor and Richard Henry Stoddard, who would be long-lasting friends. This group of young men supported and encouraged each other in the face of official journalistic criticism.

Launched in the literary life, Boker began to write assiduously. His first play, &quot;Calaynos&quot;, went into two editions during 1848, and the following year was played by Samuel Phelps at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre, London, May 10. This tragedy is notable for its depiction of the racial issues between the Spanish and the Moors.

This was soon followed by other plays. The next to be staged was a comedy, &quot;The Betrothal&quot; (1850). Two other tragedies from this time are &quot;Anne Boleyn&quot; (1850) and &quot;Leonor de Guzman&quot; (1853).

During this time, in correspondence with his friends, Boker was determining to himself the distinction between &quot;poetic&quot; and &quot;dramatic&quot; style. But Boker was not wholly wed to theatrical demands; he still approached the stage in the spirit of the poet who was torn between loyalty to poetic indirectness, and necessity for direct dialogue.

&quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;, (1853) is the play he is most well-remembered for. It is a verse tragedy based on the story of Paolo and Francesca from the fifth canto of Dante&#x27;s Inferno. Boker published the original version, called the reading version, but used an acting version for the stage which had more directness and dramatic flow. This allowed for a compromise between the poet of the reading version and the demands of the theatre. &quot;&quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot; is one of our finest verse dramas, certainly the best American romantic tragedy written before the twentieth century.&quot;

The American Civil War not only turned Boker&#x27;s pen to the Union Cause, but changed him politically from a Democrat to a staunch Republican. In fact, his name is closely interwoven with the rehabilitation of the Republican party in Philadelphia. His volume &quot;Poems of the War,&quot; was issued in 1864.

In 1862, the Union League Club was founded, with Boker as the leading spirit; through his efforts the war earnestness of the city was concentrated here; from 1863 to 1871 he served as its secretary; from 1879 to 1884 as its president. But Boker&#x27;s thoughts were also concerned with poetry. In 1869, Boker issued &quot;Königsmark, The Legend of the Hounds and other Poems&quot;, and this ended his dramatic career until his return from abroad.

==Diplomatic activities==
President Ulysses S. Grant sent Boker to Constantinople, as U.S. Minister (his appointment dated November 3, 1871)—an honor undoubtedly bestowed in recognition of his national service. Here he remained four years, &quot;and during that time secured the redress for wrongs done American subjects by the Syrians, and successfully negotiated two treaties, one having reference to the extradition of criminals, and the other to the naturalization of subjects of little power in the dominions of the other.&quot;

Boker&#x27;s initial enthusiasm for Turkish scenery and culture was unbounded, but after a time, his ignorance of the tongue, and distrust of interpreters, contributed to his frustration. By the time his Government was ready to transfer him to another post he was glad to leave Turkey. Despite this, he had developed his diplomatic skills and shown a talent for cultivating personal contacts.

In 1875, he was transferred to Russia, which was considered a more prestigious position.

The new political administration resulting from the 1876 American election viewed Boker unfavorably. Despite securing support from Emperor Alexander II of Russia, Boker was recalled in 1878.

==Later years==

On January 15, 1878, Boker withdrew from diplomatic life, returning to the United States. At this time he was depressed, feeling that both his literary and diplomatic careers had been failures.

In 1882 Lawrence Barrett mounted a revival of &quot;Francesca da Rimini&quot;. This brought more public interest in Boker and his other work, which necessitated the reprinting of several of his books. In 1884, he was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

His home in Philadelphia—one of the literary centres of the time,—bore traces of his Turkish stay—carpets brought from Constantinople, Arabic designs on the draperies, and rich Eastern colours in the tapestried chairs.

Boker was also a director of the Mechanics National Bank of Philadelphia for several years later in his life.
Boker died on January 2, 1890, in Philadelphia and was interred at Laurel Hill Cemetery.

In addition to the works already mentioned, Boker also wrote hundreds of sonnets. A collection of these, &quot;Sequence on Profane Love&quot;, was discovered in manuscript after his death, and published in 1927. He has been compared to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow as one of the premier American sonnet writers.

<text>:&quot;&quot;MLisp&quot; is also another name for Mocklisp, a stripped-down version of Lisp used as an extension language in Gosling Emacs.&quot;

MLISP is a variant of Lisp with an Algol-like syntax based on M-Expressions, which were the function syntax in the original description of Lisp by John McCarthy. McCarthy&#x27;s M-expressions were never implemented in an exact form.

MLISP was first implemented for the IBM 360 by Horace Enea and then reimplemented for the PDP 10 by David Canfield Smith. This second implementation also supported a special kind of lambdas (&quot;FEXPR&quot;), which do not evaluate their arguments. As in Lisp-1 or Scheme, there was a single namespace for variables and functions.

While MLISP was just a preprocessor with an alternative, more reader-friendly syntax for Lisp, the descendant MLISP 2 introduced new concepts:

* interactive interpretation of programs instead of compilation
* extensibility with a syntax description language (see hygienic macros)
* pattern matching
* backtracking by the use of closures on a stack and indices for continuations

MLISP2 was called a transitional language by the authors. Larry Tesler improved the pattern matching system to implement a successor language called LISP70, which was only completed to a preliminary version. Though this path of LISP evolution is widely neglected, it resembles some features, later found in ML or Scheme.

M-LISP (MetaLISP) by Robert Muller is an unrelated language from 1989–1992. It was &quot;a hybrid of M-expression LISP and Scheme&quot;.

== See also ==
There have been multiple implementations of infix-notation Lisps and Lisp-like or Lisp-derived languages. Some notable examples include:

* Dylan, which originated in Apple&#x27;s Newton project
* CGOL

<doc id="931658" wikidata="Q1376133" url="?curid=931658" title="Horatius Bonar">
<text>Horatius Bonar (; 19 December 180831 July 1889) was a Scottish churchman and poet who was a contemporary and acquaintance of Robert Murray M&#x27;cheyne. He is principally remembered as a prodigious hymnodist. Friends knew him as Horace Bonar. Licensed as a preacher, he did mission work in Leith for a time, and in November 1837 he settled at Kelso as minister of the new North Church founded in connection with Thomas Chalmers&#x27;s scheme of church extension. He became exceedingly popular as a preacher, and was soon well known throughout Scotland.

==Life==
He was the son of James Bonar (1758–1821), Solicitor of Excise for Scotland, and his wife Marjory Pyott Maitland. The family lived in the Broughton district of Edinburgh. 

He came from a long line of ministers who served a total of 364 years in the Church of Scotland. One of eleven children, his brothers John James and Andrew Alexander were also ministers of the Free Church of Scotland. Horatius studied Divinity at University of Edinburgh and was ordained as a minister for the Church of Scotland in 1838 at the North Church in Kelso. In the Disruption of 1843 he left the established church and joined the Free Church of Scotland. In 1866 he moved to the newly built Chalmers Memorial Church in Edinburgh.

He married Jane Catherine Lundie in 1843 and five of their (nine) young children died in succession. Towards the end of their lives, one of their surviving daughters was left a widow with five small children and she returned to live with her parents.

In 1853, Bonar received an honorary Doctor of Divinity degree from the University of Aberdeen.

He died at this home, 10 Palmerston Road in the Grange, 31 July 1889. They are buried together in the Canongate Kirkyard in the lair of Alexander Bonar (and his parents), near the bottom of the eastern extension.

==Family==

He married 16 August 1843, Jane Catherine (died 3rd December 1884), third daughter of Robert Lundie, minister of Kelso, and had issue — 
*Mary Lundie, born 14 June 1844 (married 29 August 1876, George Theophilus Dodds, M&#x27;All Mission, Paris)
*James, born 25 May, died 19 July 1847
*Marjory Emily Jane, born 29 August 1849, died 28 June 1850
*Christian Cornelia, born 10 October 1852, died 17 July 1869
*Lucy Jane, born 22 September 1854, died 20 August 1858
*Eliza Maitland, born 10 September 1857
*Horatius Ninian, sometime minister of United Free Church, Saltoun, born 2 April 1860
*Emily Florence, born 26 December 1861 (married 2 August 1894, Duncan Clark MacNicol, minister of Stockbridge United Free Church, Edinburgh)
*Henry Robert, born 17 December 1865, died 26 March 1869.

He was brother to the Rev. John James Bonar of Greenock (1803–1891).

==Service==
He entered the Ministry of the Church of Scotland. At first he was put in charge of mission work at St. John&#x27;s parish in Leith and settled at Kelso. He joined the Free Church at the time of the Disruption of 1843, and in 1867 was moved to Edinburgh to take over the Chalmers Memorial Church (named after his teacher at college, Dr. Thomas Chalmers). In 1883, he was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Free Church of Scotland.

==Works==
He was a voluminous and highly popular author. He also served as the editor for &quot;The Quarterly journal of Prophecy&quot; from 1848 to 1873 and for the &quot;Christian Treasury&quot; from 1859 to 1879. In addition to many books and tracts was a prolific hymnodist; many of his hymns, e.g., &quot;I heard the voice of Jesus say&quot; and &quot;Blessing and Honour and Glory and Power,&quot; became known all over the English-speaking world. A selection of these was published as &quot;Hymns of Faith and Hope&quot; (3 series). His last volume of poetry was &quot;My Old Letters&quot;. Bonar was also author of several biographies of ministers he had known, including &quot;The Life of the Rev. John Milne of Perth&quot; in 1869, and in 1884 &quot;The Life and Works of the Rev. G. T. Dodds&quot;, who was married to Bonar&#x27;s daughter and who died in 1882 while serving as a missionary in France.

His hymns, which number over 140, include:
*All Praise to Him Who Built the Hills
*All That I Was
*Fill thou my life, O Lord, my God
*I heard the Voice of Jesus say
*I Was a Wandering Sheep
*Thy way, not mine, O Lord
*Not What I Am, O Lord, but What Thou Art
*Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face
*A few more years shall roll
*Come Lord and tarry not
*O love of God, how strong and true
*Go, Labour on: Spend and Be Spent

Some of his books include:
*
*
* 
* – commentary on Acts, Romans, and 1 Corinthians and 2 Corinthians ASIN B002ZJRS9K
* – commentary on the Book of Revelation ASIN B002ZRQ55U

<text>Archibald Bower (17 January 1686 – 3 September 1766) was a Scottish historian, now noted for his complicated and varying religious faith, and the accounts he gave of it, now considered by scholars to lack credibility.

Educated at the Scots College, Douai, Bower became a Jesuit in Rome. He joined the Church of England a while after returning to London in 1726. He wrote a &quot;History of the Popes&quot; (1748–66, 7 volumes). This work was drawn into a damaging controversy concerning his apparent return to the Jesuit or Catholic fold. By the end of his life, it appeared he had changed religion three times.

==Life==
===Early life===
He was born on 17 January 1686 at or near Dundee. In 1702 he was sent to the Scots College, Douai; he then went to Rome, and was admitted to the Society of Jesus on 9 December 1706. After a novitiate of two years, he went in 1712 to Fano, where he taught classics till 1714, when he moved to Fermo. In 1717 he was recalled to Rome to study divinity in the Roman College, and in 1721 was transferred to the college of Arezzo, remaining till 1723, and became reader of philosophy. He was next sent to Florence, and the same year moved on to Macerata, where he stayed till 1726. By then he was, probably, professed of the four vows (his own statements concerning himself may not be reliable).

The turning-point in Bower&#x27;s career was his transfer from Macerata to Perugia, and his departure from there to England in 1726. Jesuit records show that the Order sent him to England. Bower gave a quite different story in &quot;Answer to a Scurrilous Pamphlet&quot; (1757). Another account had been previously published by Richard Baron in 1750, allegedly based on the story Bower gave of his &quot;escape&quot; to Dr. Hill, chaplain to the archbishop of Canterbury. A third account is printed at the end of &quot;Bower and Tillemont compared&quot; (1757) by Douglas.

===In England===
On his arrival in England in June or July 1726 Bower became acquainted with Edward Aspinwall, formerly a Jesuit, who introduced him to Samuel Clarke. After several meetings with Aspinwall, Clarke, and George Berkeley, he withdrew from the communion of the Roman Catholic church, and left the Society of Jesus. He wrote that he was then for six years a Protestant of no particular denomination, before he conformed to the church of England. In fact, he was making tentative contact with the Jesuits in the early 1730s.

Through the royal physician Thomas Goodman, Bower obtained a recommendation to Lord Aylmer, who wanted a classical tutor. He was for several years on close terms with Aylmer and was introduced to his connections, including George Lyttelton, who became a loyal friend. He took on a tutoring post, the education of the son of a Mr. Thompson, of Cooley, Berkshire; he switched after a year to Aylmer&#x27;s household.

Bower was reconciled to the Catholic church in 1744 by the Jesuit, Philip Carterest. This reconversion was preceded by negotiations of over a decade, and financial arrangements. Bower, however, soon again grew dissatisfied with his situation. He began a correspondence with Father Sheldon, the Jesuit provincial; and he received back his invested funds on 20 June 1747.

On the death of Francis Say, keeper of Queen Caroline of Ansbach&#x27;s library (10 September 1748), Bower obtained the place through the interest of Lyttelton with the prime minister Henry Pelham. The next year (4 August 1749), he married a niece of Bishop William Nicolson, a daughter of a clergyman of the Church of England. This lady had a fortune, and a child by a former husband. He had already been engaged in a treaty of marriage, which did not take effect, in 1745. In April 1754 Lyttelton appointed him clerk of the buck-warrants.

===Death===
Bower died on 3 September 1766, and was buried in St Marylebone Parish Church&#x27;s churchyard. The epitaph on his tomb describes him as &quot;a man exemplary for every social virtue, justly esteemed by all who knew him for his strict honesty and integrity, a faithful friend, and a sincere christian&quot;. He bequeathed all of his property to his wife, who attested that he died a Protestant (&quot;London Chronicle&quot;, 11 October 1766).

==Works==
While he resided with Lord Aylmer, Bower wrote &quot;Historia Literaria&quot;, a monthly review that appeared from 1730 to 1734. During the following nine years (1735–1744), he was employed on the &quot;Universal History&quot;, to which he contributed the history of Rome. He was paid to revise its second edition.

On 25 March 1747 Bower issued proposals for printing by subscription his &quot;History of the Popes&quot;. He explained that researches designed to vindicate papal supremacy had had the opposite effect on him. He presented the first volume to the king 13 May 1748. The second volume appeared in 1751, and towards the end of 1753 the third volume, which brought down his history to the death of Pope Stephen II in 757. It was in 1754 that the first serious attack was made on the work, in a pamphlet by Alban Butler, published anonymously at Douai as &quot;Remarks on the two first volumes of the late Lives of the Popes; in letters from a Gentleman to a Friend in the Country.&quot;

A controversial storm then broke over Bower. Letters addressed by Bower to the provincial of the Jesuits fell into the hands of Sir Henry Bedingfield, who asserted that they showed Bower was a Catholic. Bower maintained that these letters were forgeries by the Jesuits. Then, John Douglas published in 1756 a pamphlet supporting the genuineness of the letters; and testimony of a Mrs. Hoyles whom Bower had converted. There was a reply from Bower&#x27;s side, and Douglas published a second tract, &quot;Bower and Tillemont compared&quot; (1757), in which he argued that the &quot;History of the Popes&quot;, especially the first volume, was in effect a translation of the work of Louis-Sébastien Le Nain de Tillemont. In 1757 Bower brought out three long pamphlets, and Douglas followed with &quot;A Full Confutation of all the Facts advanced in Mr. Bower&#x27;s Three Defences&quot; (1757), and &quot;A Complete and Final Detection of A——d B——r&quot; (1758), with documentation from Italy, and arguing that Bower was an imposter.

David Garrick, once a friend of Bower, threatened to write a farce in which Bower was to be introduced on the stage as a mock convert. Bower replied with personal attacks and rebuttals. Before the controversy had ended, he published his fourth volume, and in 1757 an abridgment of the first four volumes of his work was published in French at Amsterdam.

In 1761 Bower seems to have had a hand in the anonymous &quot;Authentic Memoirs concerning the Portuguese Inquisition, in a series of letters to a friend&quot;. Around the same time he produced the fifth volume of his &quot;History of the Popes&quot;, with a summary of his dealings with Catholics. The rest of his history did not appear till just before the author&#x27;s death, when the sixth and seventh volumes were published together; but with the period from 1600 to 1758 covered in 26 pages. The &quot;History of the Popes&quot; was reprinted with a continuation by Samuel Hanson Cox, in 3 vols., Philadelphia, 1844–5.

<text>In epidemiology a susceptible individual (sometimes known simply as a susceptible) is a member of a population who is at risk of becoming infected by a disease.

== Susceptible individuals ==

Susceptibles have been exposed to neither the wild strain of the disease nor a vaccination against it, and thus have not developed immunity. Those individuals who have antibodies against an antigen associated with a particular infectious disease will not be susceptible, even if they did not produce the antibody themselves (for example, infants younger than six months who still have maternal antibodies passed through the placenta and from the colostrum, and adults who have had a recent injection of antibodies). However, these individuals soon return to the susceptible state as the antibodies are broken down.

Some individuals may have a natural resistance to a particular infectious disease. However, except in some special cases such as malaria, these individuals make up such a small proportion of the total population that they can be ignored for the purposes of modelling an epidemic.

== Mathematical model of susceptibility ==

The proportion of the population who are susceptible to a particular disease is denoted &quot;S&quot;. Due to the problems mentioned above, it is difficult to know this parameter for a given population. However, in a population with a rectangular population distribution (such as that of a developed country), it may be estimated by:

:formula_1

Where &quot;A&quot; is the average age at which the disease is contracted and &quot;L&quot; is the life expectancy of the population. To understand the rationale behind this relation, think of &quot;A&quot; as the length/amount of time spent in the susceptible group (assuming an individual is susceptible before contracting the disease and immune afterwards) and &quot;L&quot; as the total length of time spent in the population. It thus follows that the proportion of time spent as a susceptible is A/L and, in a population with a rectangular distribution, the proportion of an individual&#x27;s life spent in one group is representative of the proportion of the population in that group. 

The advantage of estimating &quot;S&quot; in this way is that both the average age of infection and life expectancy will be well documented, and thus the other parameters needed to calculate &quot;S&quot; will be easily at hand.

The parameter &quot;S&quot; is important in the mathematical modelling of epidemics.

== Susceptibility in virology ==

Viruses are only able to cause disease or pathologies if they meet several criteria:

#The virus is able to enter the cell (called a susceptible state)
#There is a sufficient number of viruses within the cell
#The virus is able to replicate within the cell (called a permissive state)

Hence susceptibility only refers to the fact that the virus is able to get into the cell, via having the proper receptor(s), and as a result, despite the fact that a host may be susceptible, the virus may still not be able to cause any pathologies within the host. Reasons for this are varied and may include suppression by the host immune system, or abortive measures taken by intrinsic cell defenses.

<text>Andrew Kennedy Hutchison Boyd (3 November 1825 – 1 March 1899) was a Scottish writer, who originally intended for the English Bar but entered the Church of Scotland, and was minister at St. Andrews.

==Life==

He was born on 3 November 1825 in the manse of Auchinleck in Ayrshire, the son of James Boyd. He was educated at Ayr Academy. The family moved to the manse at Ochiltree in 1833. His father became minister of the Tron Kirk in Glasgow after he left home.

Boyd later studied at King&#x27;s College School and at the Middle Temple, London, training as an English barrister. Returning to the university of Glasgow, he qualified for the ministry of the national church. He graduated B.A. at Glasgow in April 1846, and at the end of 1850 was licensed as a preacher by the presbytery of Ayr.

For several months Boyd was assistant in St. George&#x27;s parish, Edinburgh, and on 18 September 1851 he was ordained parish minister of Newton-on-Ayr, where he succeeded John Caird. In 1854, he became minister of Kirkpatrick-Irongray, near Dumfries. Here he remained five years, maturing his pulpit style, and, writing under his initials of &quot;A. K. H. B.,&quot; steadily gaining reputation in &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot; with his &quot;Recreations of a Country Parson.&quot;
In April 1859, Boyd was appointed to the parish of St. Bernard&#x27;s, in Stockbridge, Edinburgh, and found the presbytery exercised on the question of decorous church service, raised by the practice and advocacy of Robert Lee. Boyd sympathised with the desire for a devout and graceful form of worship, and he was afterwards a member of the Churcli Service Society. In 1864 the university of Edinburgh conferred on him the honorary degree of D.D.
In 1865, Boyd succeeded Park as minister of the first charge, St. Andrews. Boyd urged the question of an improved ritual in the services of the national church, and in 1866, on the initiative of his presbytery, a committee was appointed by the general assembly to prepare a collection of hymns. The hymnal compiled by the committee, with Boyd as convener, was published in 1870, and enlarged in 1884. St. Andrews University conferred on him the degree of LL.D. in April 1889.

In May 1890, he was appointed moderator of the general assembly. His closing address was published as &quot;Church Life in Scotland: Retrospect and Prospect&quot; (Edinburgh, 1890). One of his last public services was the reopening, on 11 July 1894, of the renovated church of St. Cuthbert&#x27;s, Edinburgh. Early in 1895, he was seriously ill, but recovered, only to lose his wife who had nursed him back to health. In the winter of 1898–1899, he had a recurrence of ill-health and went to Bournemouth to recuperate. He resumed work on sermons and essays, but on 1 March 1899 he died by misadventure, having taken carbolic lotion (a 1-in-40-parts mixture of carbolic acid in water) in mistake for a sleeping-draught.

He was interred in the Eastern Cemetery of St Andrews (south of the cathedral), against the south wall, with his first wife.

==Family==
Boyd married, in 1854, Margaret Buchanan, eldest daughter of Captain Kirk (71st regiment) of Carrickfergus in Ireland. She predeceased him in 1895. Their sons included Frank Mortimer Boyd a journalist and author, Rev Herbert Buchanan Boyd and Charles Walter Boyd secretary to Cecil Rhodes and of the Rhodes Trust.

In 1897, he married, following Margaret&#x27;s death in 1895, Janet Balfour, daughter of Mr. Leslie Meldrum of Devon House near Clackmannan. She survived him, with five sons and one daughter of his first wife&#x27;s family.

<text>Zachary Boyd (1585–1653) was a Scottish minister and university administrator who wrote many sermons, scriptural versifications and other devotional works. He served as Dean of Faculties, Rector and Vice-Chancellor at the University of Glasgow during the 1630s and 1640s, and bequeathed a generous legacy to the university including his library and large manuscript collection of unpublished sermons and verse.

==Life==
Boyd was born into the family of Boyd of Pinkhill, Ayrshire. He first studied at the University of Glasgow and then went to Saumur in France. There he followed courses of his kinsman Robert Boyd and in 1611 became Regent Professor. He returned to Glasgow in 1621 and became Minister of Barony Parish in 1625. During the 1630s and 1640s he served as Dean of Faculties, Rector and Vice-Chancellor of the Glasgow University.

He was a moderate royalist who, like many faculty members at Glasgow, was initially reluctant to subscribe to the National Covenant in 1638, though in time he did so. As a Scottish Presbyterian his primary concern during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms was to guarantee Presbyterian church government in Scotland. In a poem about the Battle of Newburn Boyd celebrated the Scottish victory but stopped short of saying that the King himself had been defeated. After many magistrates and ministers subsequently fled Glasgow, Boyd remained behind and met Oliver Cromwell in October 1648: Cromwell was advised to &#x27;pistol the scoundrel&#x27; but instead invited Boyd for dinner.

==Works==
Three collections of Boyd&#x27;s verse were printed during his lifetime. &quot;The Garden of Zion&quot; (1644) is a two-volume work that versifies Job, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, the Song of Solomon, and other Old Testament songs. Boyd sought to have his rhymed psalter (printed in 1644) and scriptural songs (1645) accepted as the standard text for use in England and Scotland. Though the Scottish General Assembly sent his psalms to the Westminster Assembly for consideration, Robert Baillie criticized Boyd for his &quot; in seeking to have his psalter adopted. These books were printed by George Anderson, an unofficial printer to the university whom Boyd supported during his time as Vice-Chancellor.

His printed prose consists of a variety of devotional works. The largest is the prose treatise &quot;Last Battell of the Soule in Death&quot; (Edinburgh, 1628), a text written in the &quot;Ars moriendi&quot; tradition to offer solace to those approaching death. &quot;Cleare Forme of Catechising&quot; (Glasgow, 1639) is a children&#x27;s catechism. &quot;A Sermon of Preparation to the Communion and A Sermon for the Day of the Sacrament&quot; (Edinburgh, 1629) and &quot;Two Orientall Pearles, Grace and Glory&quot; (Edinburgh, 1629) made a small number of Boyd&#x27;s sermons available in print, but Boyd left over 250 more in manuscript.

Boyd also left a substantial quantity of scriptural versifications. Boyd&#x27;s autograph manuscripts, which are held at Glasgow University Library, include &quot;Zions Flowers&quot; (or &#x27;Christian Poems for Spiritual Edification&#x27;), the didactic set of exercises &quot;The English Academie &quot;and versified Gospels entitled &quot;The Four Evangels.&quot; &quot;Zions Flowers&quot; versifies nineteen biblical narratives from the Old Testament, such as &#x27;Pharaoh&#x27;s Tyrannie and Death&#x27;, &#x27;David and Goliath&#x27; and &#x27;Destruction of Sodom&#x27;. Known collectively as &#x27;Boyd&#x27;s Bible&#x27; – though Boyd never did versify the entire Bible – these poems&#x27; critical estimation has never been high: representative is the nineteenth-century writer John Marshall Lang&#x27;s opinion that Boyd &#x27;was not a poet, yet he was something more than a mere doggerel rhymer [...] the commendable features are often marred not merely by rugged verse, but also by hard and unsympathetic thought.&#x27; Boyd&#x27;s versifications are remarkable for the extent to which they contain phrases and imagery appropriated from Josuah Sylvester&#x27;s translation of Guillaume de Saluste Du Bartas&#x27; &quot;Semaines&quot; and Sylvester&#x27;s other works. Boyd&#x27;s Deed of Mortification indicated that a portion of the money he donated to Glasgow was to be used for printing his poems; it never was. However, the bibliographer Gabriel Neil did print four poems from &quot;Zion&#x27;s Flowers&quot; in 1855, and David Atkinson produced an edition of Boyd&#x27;s Selected Sermons for the Scottish Text Society in 1989.

<text>International King of Sports is an annual televised multi-sport competition. The events are mostly sports rarely undertaken outside of this competition, and often resemble comic variants of standard track and field sports.

Adam Horder (Australia) was the winner in 2002. The winner of the 2004 competition was Jamie Quarry (Great Britain).

The television programme of &quot;International King of Sports&quot; was produced by Endemol, and in the UK was broadcast on Five. It was presented by Helen Chamberlain and Mark Robson, with commentary from Alan Parry.

The programme won a bronze award in the Game Show category at the Montreux Television Festival in 2003.

<text>Edward Bradley (25 March 1827 – 12 December 1889) was an English clergyman and novelist. He was born in Kidderminster and educated at Durham University from which he took his pen name Cuthbert Bede. His most popular book was &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green&quot;, on the experiences of an Oxford undergraduate. There was a sequel, &quot;Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green&quot;. &quot;Tales of College Life&quot; (often bound with it), introduces the character of &quot;Mr Affable Canary&quot;. The celebrated illustrations to the Verdant Green books were the work of the author.

==Life==

He was the second son of Thomas Bradley, surgeon of Kidderminster, who came of a somewhat ancient Worcestershire and clerical family. A brother, Thomas Waldron Bradley, was author of two novels, &quot;Grantley Grange&quot; (1874) and &quot;Nelly Hamilton&quot; (1875), while an uncle, William Bradley of Leamington, wrote &quot;Sketches of the Poor by a retired Guardian&quot;.

After education at the Kidderminster Grammar School, Bradley went up in 1845 to University College, Durham, where he was Thorp Scholar and Foundation Scholar. He graduated B.A. in 1848, and took his licentiateship of theology in 1849. Not being of age to take orders, he appears to have stayed a year at Oxford, pursuing various studies, though he never matriculated, and while there he formed a lifelong friendship with John George Wood.

For a year or so he worked in the clergy schools at Kidderminster. In 1850, he was ordained by the Bishop of Ely, Thomas Turton, and appointed to the curacy of Glatton-with-Holme in Huntingdonshire. He remained there over four years, during which he described for the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; the extensive work of draining Whittlesey Mere, then being carried out by William Wells of Holmewood.

In 1857, Bradley was appointed vicar of Donington in Shropshire. From 1859 to 1871, he was rector of Denton-with-Caldecote, Huntingdonshire. In 1871, he became rector of Stretton, Rutland, where he carried through a much-needed restoration of the church, at a cost of nearly £2,000. To raise the funds he gave lectures in Midland towns, and was much in demand as an authority upon &quot;Modern Humourists&quot;, &quot;Wit and Humour&quot; and &quot;Light Literature&quot;.
Bradley was a friend and associate of George Cruikshank, Frank Smedley, Mark Lemon, and Albert Smith (for whose serials, &quot;The Month&quot;, &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot; and &quot;The Town and Country Miscellany&quot;, he began to write about 1850). He generally wrote for the press under the pen name &#x27;Cuthbert Bede&#x27;, the names of the two patron saints of Durham.

His one marked literary success was obtained in 1853, when he produced &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green. With numerous illustrations designed and drawn on the wood by the author&quot;. Bradley had the greatest difficulty in finding a publisher, but part i. was eventually issued by Nathaniel Cooke of the Strand as one of his shilling &quot;Books for the Rail&quot; in October 1853. Part ii. appeared in 1854, and part iii. in 1856. The three parts were then bound in one volume, of which 100,000 copies had been sold by 1870; subsequently the book was issued in a sixpenny form, and the sale was more than doubled. The total amount that Bradley received for his work was £350. The three original parts were scarce and fetched over five guineas in 1890. The picture of &#x27;Master Verdant kissing the Maids on the Stairs after his return from Oxford College&#x27; was omitted from the later editions.
&quot;The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green&quot; contains portraits of Dr. Plumptre, vice-chancellor 1848–62, Dr. Bliss, registrar of the university, and &#x27;the waiter at the Mitre,&#x27; while Mr. Bouncer reproduces many traits of the Rev. J. G. Wood. 
Verdant Green himself is a kind of undergraduate Samuel Pickwick, and the book is full of harmless fun. 
When we regard the difficulty of the subject, the general fidelity with which one side of university life is depicted, and the fact that Bradley was not himself an Oxford man, we can scarcely refuse a certain measure of genius to the author. 
Hippolyte Taine used it effectively (together with &quot;Pendennis&quot; and &quot;Tom Brown at Oxford&quot;) as material for his tableau of an English university in his &quot;Notes sur l&#x27;Angleterre&quot;. A sequel by Bradley, produced many years later as &quot;Little Mr. Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green&quot; (1878), did not approach the original in vigour, nor can much success be claimed for the Cambridge rival of &quot;Verdant Green&quot;, &quot;The Cambridge Freshman, or Memoirs of Mr. Golightly&quot; (1871), by Martin Legrand (i.e. James Rice), with illustrations by &#x27;Phiz&#x27;.
In 1883, on the presentation of Lord Aveland, Bradley left Stretton for the vicarage of Lenton with Hanby, near Grantham. There, as elsewhere, he was indefatigable as a parochial organiser, establishing a free library, a school bank, winter entertainments, and improvement societies.

He died, greatly regretted by all who came into contact with his kindly personality, at the vicarage, Lenton, on 12 December 1889. He was buried in the churchyard of St Nicholas&#x27; Church, Stretton, which he had laid out during his incumbency there.

==Family==
In December 1858 he married Harriet Amelia, youngest daughter of Samuel Hancocks of Wolverley, Worcester. He left two sons, the artist Cuthbert Bradley and the Rev. Henry Waldron Bradley. Another son, William Hancocks Bradley, died in 1874, aged 12.

==Works==

Commencing with &quot;Bentley&#x27;s&quot; in 1846, Bradley (as E. B. or &#x27;Cuthbert Bede&#x27;) contributed to a great number of papers and periodicals, including &quot;Punch&quot; (1847–55), &quot;All the Year Round,&quot; &quot;Illustrated London Magazine&quot; (1853–55), &quot;The Field,&quot; &quot;St. James&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s&quot; magazines, &quot;Leisure Hour,&quot; &quot;Quiver,&quot; &quot;Notes and Queries&quot; (1852–1886), &quot;The Boy&#x27;s Own Paper&quot;, &quot;London Figaro&quot; and the &quot;Illustrated London News,&quot; for which paper he conducted a double acrostic column, commencing 30 August 1856. He claimed to have reintroduced the double acrostic into England.

He wrote under the name of &#x27;Cuthbert Bede, BA&#x27; a few novels and tales, &quot;Fairy Fables&quot; (1858), &quot;Glencraggan&quot; (1861), &quot;Fotheringhay&quot; (1885), etc. His most popular book was &quot;The Adventures of Mr. Verdant Green&quot;, on the experiences of an Oxford undergraduate. There was a sequel, &quot;Little Mr Bouncer and his friend Verdant Green&quot;. &quot;Tales of College Life&quot; (often bound with it), introduces the character of &quot;Mr Affable Canary&quot;. The celebrated illustrations to the Verdant Green books were the work of the author.

<text>James Bramston (c. 1694–1743) was an English poet who specialised in satire and parody. He was also a pluralist cleric of the Church of England.

==Family==
The son of Col. Francis Bramston, a guards officer, he was born at Skreens, near Chelmsford, Essex, and educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. Sir John Bramston (1577–1654), Lord Chief Justice of the King&#x27;s Bench, was his great-grandfather.

==Priesthood==
Bramston took holy orders in the Anglican church and was appointed Chaplain to the 2nd Dragoon Guards in 1721. By 1724 he was married, and in that year became Rector of Lurgashall in 1724, then Vicar of neighbouring Harting, West Sussex in 1725. He was reinstated at Lurgashall in 1739 and named Vicar of Westhampnett, near Chichester on the same day. He held these and some other preferments as a pluralist until his death.

Bramston&#x27;s legacy to Lurgashall Church partly paid for rebuilding the chancel. He died on 22 December 1743 and was buried at Chalton, Hampshire. He was survived by his wife, Elizabeth.

==Verses==
Bramston&#x27;s verses include &quot;The Art of Politics&quot; (1729), in imitation of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Ars Poetica&quot;, (&quot;What&#x27;s not destroy&#x27;d by Time&#x27;s devouring Hand? Where&#x27;s Troy, and where&#x27;s the Maypole in the Strand?&quot;) and &quot;The Man of Taste&quot; (1733), in imitation of Alexander Pope (&quot;Sur loins and rumps of beef offend my eyes,/Pleas&#x27;d with frogs fricasseed and coxcomb pies.&quot;) His &quot;Ignorami lamentatio super legis communis translationem ex Latino in Anglicum&quot; (1736), dedicated by &quot;Ambi-dexter Ignoramus&quot; to &quot;Dulmannum&quot;, satirizes lawyers. It is written in Dog Latin hexameters. He also parodied John Philips&#x27;s &quot;The Splendid Shilling&quot; in &quot;The Crooked Sixpence&quot;.

<text>Anna Eliza Bray (born Kempe, afterwards Stothard; 25 December 1790 – 21 January 1883) was an English historical novelist. She also wrote several non-fiction works.

==Biography==
Anna Eliza Kempe was born in the parish of Newington, Surrey on 25 December 1790, to John Kempe, a bullion porter in the Royal Mint, and Ann, daughter of James Arrow of Westminster. Kempe planned to be an actress, and her public appearance at the Bath Theatre was duly announced for 27 May 1815. However, she caught a severe cold on her journey, which prevented her appearance, and the opportunity was lost. In February 1818, she married Charles Alfred Stothard, son of the noted painter Thomas Stothard R. A. They travelled to France, and her first work consisted of &quot;Letters written during a Tour in Normandy, Brittany, &amp;c., in 1818&quot;.

As an artist, her husband was devoted to illustrating the funerary monuments of Great Britain, but on 28 May 1821 he fell off a ladder and died in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, Bere Ferrers, Devon, while collecting materials for his work &quot;The Monumental Effigies of Great Britain&quot;. She had one child by him, a daughter (born 29 June 1821, died 2 February 1822). In 1823 she produced a memoir of her late husband and undertook to complete the book he had left unfinished, with the aid of her brother Alfred John Kempe. She eventually did so and the work appeared in 1832. She left the original drawings of his work to the British Museum on her death.

Many years later she provided the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; with reminiscences of her father-in-law, Thomas Stothard, R. A. These were afterwards (1851) expanded into a life of that artist.

A year or two after Stothard died, Anna Eliza married Edward Atkyns Bray, Vicar of Tavistock. She then began writing historical novels, and from 1826 to 1874 produced at least a dozen. Some, such as &quot;The Talba, or the Moor of Portugal&quot; (1830) deal with foreign life, but her most popular ones revived the principal families of the counties of Devon and Cornwall, such as the Trelawneys of Trelawne, the Pomeroys, and the Courtenays of Walreddon. They proved so popular that a set of ten volumes by Longmans appeared in 1845–1846 and was reprinted by Chapman &amp; Hall as late as 1884. While she was living in Tavistock, Bray discovered and took up a young lady&#x27;s maid, Mary Colling, who had produced a book of poetry, which Bray arranged to have published.

Ann Bray&#x27;s second husband died in 1857. She then moved to London, where she selected and edited some of his poetry and sermons, before returning to original work. Her last years were embittered by a report that on a visit to Bayeux in 1816, she had stolen a piece of the Bayeux Tapestry. However, her character was cleared by correspondence and leading articles that appeared in the &quot;Times&quot;. She died in London on 21 January 1883. Her autobiography up to 1843 was published by her nephew, John A. Kempe, in 1884, although it is sketchy and inaccurate. It depicts an accomplished and kindly woman, proud of her own creations and enthusiastic in praise of the literary characters she knew.

==Other works==
Bray wrote many other works in addition to those mentioned so far. They included &quot;The Borders of the Tamar and the Tavy&quot; (1836, 3 vols.), which describes in a series of letters to Southey the traditions, legends and superstitions that surround the town of Tavistock, on the borders of the River Tamar and the River Tavy. It was reviewed by Southey himself in the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. The remainder copies were issued with a new title page by H. G. Bohn in 1838, and a new edition compressed by Mrs Bray herself into two volumes appeared in 1879. Also connected with South-West England are a series of tales for &quot;young people&quot; on the romantic legends connected with Dartmoor and North Cornwall, entitled, &quot;A Peep at the Pixies, or Legends of the West&quot; (1854).

In 1841, her &quot;The Mountains and Lakes of Switzerland, with Notes on the Route there and back&quot; was published. After a silence of some years she issued three compilations in French history in 1870, &quot;The Good St. Louis and his Times&quot;, &quot;The Revolt of the Protestants of the Cevennes&quot;, and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;. These were reported by the author of her entry in the Dictionary of National Biography in 1886 to be &quot;pleasantly written, but lacked historical research that could have made them of permanent value&quot;.

Among her other works are &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;Trelawney&quot;, and &quot;The White Hoods: an Historical Romance&quot;.

<text>&quot;Feeling This&quot; is a song by American rock band Blink-182 for their untitled fifth studio album (2003). The song is the opening track on the album and was released as its lead single on October 6, 2003, through Geffen Records. It was written by guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker, and was produced and mixed by Jerry Finn. The song originated on the first day of producing the album. Its lyrics are purely sexual in nature; the band juxtaposes lust and passion between verses and choruses, thematically connected with a wistful, regretful tone.

The song features a Latin-inspired backbeat in the chorus, and the song ends in a melodic, harmonized duet split between DeLonge and Hoppus. Elements of the song were inspired by rock groups Led Zeppelin and the Beach Boys. The song&#x27;s music video, photographed by David LaChapelle, depicts a dystopian correctional facility that is overtaken by its inmates. An early version of the song, erroneously titled &quot;Action&quot;, was released on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;.

&quot;Feeling This&quot; received critical acclaim and peaked at number two on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart in late 2003. It was also a top-20 hit in the United Kingdom and Australia. The digital single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2005. Blink-182 has performed &quot;Feeling This&quot; in a number of live appearances, including on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;.

==Background==

&quot;Feeling This&quot; was the first track that was recorded for &quot;Blink-182&quot; in early 2003. On the first day of pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it was the first time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. &quot;I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I just feel like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing,&quot; said Barker at the time.

The lyrics were written with Hoppus and DeLonge going into separate rooms—Hoppus writing the choruses and DeLonge writing the verses. The two had not spoken to each other about the lyrics ahead of time, and it turned out that the two had both written about sex. When put together, the song represents the lustful side of sex during the verses, the passionate side in the bridge and the romantic side in the chorus, creating a juxtaposition between both voices. It has been interpreted as a description for failed romance, one that &quot;illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence and regret.&quot; For Barker, the song&#x27;s drum track was &quot;super in respect to John Bonham. [...] We were kind of messing around with the verse. It’s like, &#x27;Well, I want to do a four-bar drum intro and just see how it works for the song.&#x27; And we never second-guessed it. We were like, &#x27;That sounds rad.&#x27;&quot;

According to engineer Ryan Hewitt, the track contains &quot;four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing.&quot; The song was recorded &quot;part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout,&quot; and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker&#x27;s drum kit to tailor the natural ambience of the home it was recorded in. Upon playback of a rough mix of the song, the engineer automated the music to fade at the song&#x27;s conclusion, but mistakenly forgot to do the same for the vocal tracks. Hoppus, who had been listening to the Beach Boys at the time, liked the a cappella interplay of their voices. All agreed to keep it in the final version of the song.

==Composition==
The song is composed in the key of E major and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 173 beats per minute. The vocal range spans from E3 to B4.

&quot;Feeling This&quot; opens with flanged drums. Although computer technology offered it during the album’s production, according to Hoppus, the band opted to produce the effect &quot;the old school way&quot;, opting for two tape machines. Originally taking root as a faster-paced drum &#x27;n&#x27; bass-inspired track, Barker imitated that genre&#x27;s groove on open hi-hats. The influence of John Bonham is most explicit in the song&#x27;s first few seconds, in which Barker performs eighth-note triplets on his bass drum, much like the Led Zeppelin song &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; (1969). Following a sample from &quot;Captain America&quot; (1990)—&quot;Get ready for action!—the song moves into a &quot;stabbing guitar rhythm&quot; over the verses, which are &quot;half-barked&quot; and contain delivery reminiscent of hip-hop. The &quot;harmony-rich&quot; chorus of the song, which contains the refrain &quot;Fate fell short this time, smile fades in the summer / Place your hand in mine, I&#x27;ll leave when I wanna&quot;, is replete with a &quot;syncopated Latin-flavored backbeat.&quot; In the chorus, Barker plays a cowbell, which he initially included as a joke, believing Hoppus and DeLonge would &quot;hate it.&quot;

The song is particularly memorable for a section of the chorus of the song (right before the bridge begins), in which guitarist Tom DeLonge sings the vocals loudly and off-key. According to the liner notes for &quot;Blink-182&quot;, DeLonge stated that the recording was done in a living room at the home previously mentioned, with microphones away. The end of the song is a melodic duet between the band&#x27;s two vocalists, both singing conflicting but harmonizing parts.

==Release==
Blink-182 first performed &quot;Feeling This&quot; alongside other new songs from &quot;Blink-182&quot; during their performances at the 2003 Reading and Leeds festivals. The band picked &quot;Feeling This&quot; as the first single because they felt it representative of the transition they had undergone since their fourth studio album, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; (2001). A slightly different version of the song had been released previously as part of the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; under the erroneous title &quot;Action&quot;. Barker explained in an interview that &quot;&#x27;Action&#x27; just sounded kind of dorky to us. Like we would always call it &#x27;Feeling This&#x27; and then someone at our label, I think, like wrote it as &#x27;Action&#x27; one time and sent out singles to people. And it was always supposed to be &#x27;Feeling This&#x27;.&quot;

To promote &quot;Blink-182&quot;, the group performed &quot;Feeling This&quot;, as well as their past hit &quot;Dammit&quot; on &quot;Total Request Live&quot; on November 11, 2003, and on the late-night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; in November 26, 2003. Richard Cheese covered the song on their 2004 album &quot;I&#x27;d Like a Virgin&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Feeling This&quot; debuted at number 40 on &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart on October 18, 2003, jumping to number 13 in its second week, which was at that time the fourth-biggest move in the history of that chart. The song moved upwards on the chart over the following weeks, eventually achieving a peak of number two (behind Linkin Park&#x27;s hit &quot;Numb&quot;) on November 29, 2003. It remained at number two for two more weeks before dropping to number three, after which it continued dropping before exiting the top 20 on February 21, 2004. In total, it spent twenty-six weeks on the chart. It spent eight weeks on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles, which acts as an extension to the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart; it peaked at number two on December 20, 2003.

In the United Kingdom, &quot;Feeling This&quot; debuted at number 15 on the UK Singles Chart for the week ending date November 30, 2003. It dropped to number 35 the following week before exiting the chart on December 28; in all, it spent ten weeks on the chart.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Feeling This&quot; received favorable reviews from music critics. Kelefa Sanneh, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot; felt the song was an &quot;appealing hybrid,&quot; while noting the growing popularity of emo could have influenced the &quot;more anguished&quot; tone. Greg Kot of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the vocal harmonies, calling them reminiscent of Queen. Joshua Klein of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; similarly complimented the interplay between DeLonge and Hoppus and its &quot;multiple-perspective portrait of first love.&quot; Andy Doerschuk of &quot;Drum!&quot; praised Barker&#x27;s &quot;fat, syncopated beat&quot; and noted elements of Bonham as well as James Brown&#x27;s drummers. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Jenny Eliscu made note of its &quot;catchy hooks&quot;, while Stephen Thompson, writing for &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, considered it among many songs on the album that were &quot;straightforwardly conventional.&quot;

==Music video==

The video follows students at a dystopian-based correctional facility who rebel and take over the establishment, intertwined with shots of the band performing outside the prison in a cage, providing a &quot;soundtrack to the chaos.&quot; Hoppus described their idea for the facility: &quot;It&#x27;s kind of a combination of prep school and reform school, and it&#x27;s very repressed and kids are being held down. There is a lot of authority and a lot of strict regimen, and the kids lash out and take over the school and destroy the place.&quot; The band&#x27;s main goal for the video was for it to resemble an art piece, much in the same way they viewed the production of the album, to keep in line with tone. To this end, they enlisted director David LaChapelle. LaChapelle&#x27;s input—which &quot;ranges from an evil prison warden cracking a whip at marching school kids to escapees ripping their uniforms and doing acrobatic moves down the hallways&quot;—was regarded by the band as &quot;completely wacked out and twisted, which is exactly what we love.&quot;

In the narrative, the boys and girls are separated at the school and sexually repressed, and release their energies when they meet between a glass window. The entire music video was shot on September 30, 2003, at the abandoned Lincoln Heights Jail north of downtown Los Angeles, only a few days ahead of its premiere.

<text>Henry Brooke (1703 – 10 October 1783) was an Irish novelist and dramatist. He was born and raised at Rantavan House near Mullagh, a village in the far south of County Cavan in Ireland, the son of a clergyman, and he later studied law at Trinity College, Dublin, but embraced literature as a career.

Brooke&#x27;s father was The Reverend William Brooke, the well-off Church of Ireland Rector of Killinkere and Mullagh within the Church of Ireland Diocese of Kilmore. Henry first began his career as a poet. His now forgotten philosophical poem &quot;Universal Beauty&quot; was published in 1735, and Alexander Pope thought its sentiments and poetry fine. He then turned dramatist by adapting extant plays, such as &quot;The Earl of Essex.&quot; He wrote from the Tory point of view and became one of the most important figures in Augustan drama, although not for his successes. 

His &quot;Gustavus Vasa&quot; (1739) has the distinction of being the first play banned by the Licensing Act 1737. The play concerned the liberation of Sweden from Denmark in 1521 by &quot;Riksföreståndare&quot; (Protector of the Realm or Regent) Gustav Vasa (who later became King Gustav I of Sweden). Sir Robert Walpole believed that the villain of the play resembled him. Further, a facetious &quot;attack&quot; on it was the first public writing of Samuel Johnson, whose &quot;A Complete Vindication of the Licensers of the English Stage&quot; feigns support for Walpole while it drives the censor&#x27;s argument to &quot;reductio ad absurdum.&quot;

Brooke lived in Ireland most of his life, but he spent time in London when his plays were on the stage. In politics, he was somewhat radical in arguing publicly for loosening the laws persecuting Roman Catholics in the United Kingdom. His daughter Charlotte Brooke was herself an important figure in the history of Irish literature, publishing &quot;Reliques of Irish Poetry&quot; (1789) and working to increase the profile of Irish language poetry.

Later, his &quot;Earl of Essex&quot; came back to the boards in a revival. Again, Samuel Johnson offered his public support of Brooke, but when he heard the Earl saying at the end of Act II, &quot;Who rules o&#x27;er free men must himself be free,&quot; Johnson replied, &quot;Who drives fat oxen must himself be fat.&quot; Although Johnson was objecting to the misuse and overuse of &quot;freedom&quot; and was at that time in a vexatious debate over the United States War of Independence (saying, &quot;Why is it that we hear the loudest cries for liberty from the drivers of Negroes?&quot;), Brooke was mortified by Johnson&#x27;s parody and changed the line for his &quot;Collected Works&quot;.

Brooke had a difficult life and made a very poor living. The Licensing Act 1737 robbed him of his primary avenue to making a living, for, after the Act, he was the first man banned by it. Whatever fame this lent him was made up for by his inability to get new plays performed. His greatest commercial successes came from the &quot;Earl of Essex&quot; and his two novels, &quot;The Fool of Quality&quot; (1760-1772) and &quot;Juliet Grenville&quot; (1774), which are two of the finest sentimental novels. John Wesley was so fond of &quot;The Fool of Quality&quot;, in which Brooke declares his belief in universal salvation, that he sought to have a copy of it given out to all new Methodist churches.

He had twenty-two children. Of these, only Charlotte survived adolescence. She shepherded his &quot;Works&quot; through the press after his death.

<doc id="931702" wikidata="Q7498705" url="?curid=931702" title="Shirley Brooks">
<text>Charles William Shirley Brooks (29 April 1816 – 23 February 1874) was an English journalist and novelist. Born in London, he began his career in a solicitor&#x27;s office. Shortly afterwards he took to writing, and contributed to various periodicals. In 1851 he joined the staff of &quot;Punch&quot;, to which he contributed &quot;Essence of Parliament,&quot; and on the death of Mark Lemon in 1870 he succeeded him as editor. He published a few novels, including &quot;Aspen Court&quot; and &quot;The Gordian Knot&quot;.

==Life==
Brooks was the son of William Brooks, architect, who died on 11 Dec. 1867, aged 80, by his wife Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of William Sabine of Islington. He was born at 52 Doughty Street, London, 29 April 1816. After his earlier education he was articled, on 24 April 1832, to his uncle, Mr. Charles Sabine of Oswestry, for the term of five years, and passed the Incorporated Law Society&#x27;s examination in November 1838, but there is no record of his ever having become a solicitor.

During five sessions he occupied a seat in the reporters&#x27; gallery of the House of Commons, as the writer of the parliamentary summary in the &quot;Morning Chronicle.&quot; In 1853 he was sent by that journal as special commissioner to inquire into the questions connected with the subject of labour and the poor in Russia, Syria, and Egypt. His letters from these countries were afterwards collected and published in the sixth volume of the &quot;Travellers&#x27; Library,&quot; under the title of the &quot;Russians of the South.&quot;

As of 1842, he signed his articles which were appearing in &quot;Ainsworth&#x27;s Magazine&quot; as Charles W. Brooks. His second literary signature was &quot;C. Shirley Brooks&quot;, and finally he became Shirley Brooks. His full Christian names were Charles William Shirley, the last being an old name in the family. His first magazine papers, among which were &quot;A Lounge in the Œil de Bœuf,&quot; &quot;An Excursion of some English Actors to China,&quot; &quot;Cousin Emily,&quot; and &quot;The Shrift on the Rail,&quot; brought him into communication with Harrison Ainsworth, Laman Blanchard, and other well-known men, and he soon became the centre of a strong muster of literary friends, who found pleasure in his wit and social qualities. As a dramatist he frequently achieved considerable success, without, however, once making any ambitious effort—such, for example, as producing a five-act comedy. His original drama &quot;The Creole, or Love&#x27;s Fetters,&quot; was produced at the Lyceum 8 April 1847 with marked applause. A lighter piece, entitled &quot;Anything for a Change,&quot; was brought out at the same house 7 June 1848. Two years afterwards, 5 Aug. 1850, his two-act drama, the &quot;Daughter of the Stars,&quot; was acted at the New Strand Theatre. The exhibition of 1851 gave occasion for his writing &quot;The Exposition: a Scandinavian Sketch, containing as much irrelevant matter as possible in one act,&quot; which was produced at the Strand on 28 April in that year.

In association with John Oxenford, he supplied to the Olympic, 26 Dec. 1861, an extravaganza entitled &quot;Timour the Tartar, or the Iron Master of Samarkand,&quot; the explanatory letterpress stating that a trifling lapse between the year 1361 and the year 1861 occasionally occurs. Amongst his other dramatic pieces are &quot;Guardian Angel,&quot; a farce, &quot;Lowther Arcade,&quot; &quot;Honours and Tricks,&quot; and &quot;Our New Governess.&quot;

Brooks was in his earlier days a contributor to many of the best periodicals. He was a leader writer on the &quot;Illustrated London News,&quot; to which journal at a later period he furnished a weekly article under the name of &quot;Nothing in the Papers.&quot; He conducted the &quot;Literary Gazette&quot; 1858–9, and edited &quot;Home News&quot; after the death of Robert Bell in 1867. To a volume edited by Albert Smith in 1849, called &quot;Gavarni in London,&quot; he furnished three sketches — &quot;The Opera,&quot; &quot;The Coulisse,&quot; and &quot;The Foreign Gentleman;&quot; and in companionship with Angus B. Reach he published &quot;A Story with a Vengeance&quot; in 1852. At thirty-eight years of age he began to assert his claim to consideration as a popular novelist by writing &quot;Aspen Court: a Story of our own Time.&quot; He then allowed five years to elapse before he made his second venture as a novelist. He did so as the author of a twelve-installment serial fiction, the &quot;Gordian Knot,&quot; from January 1858; but this work, illustrated by John Tenniel, remained unfinished for upwards of two years.

Brooks&#x27;s important connection with &quot;Punch&quot; began in 1851. He made use of the name &quot;Epicurus Rotundus&quot; as the signature to his articles. For the rest of his life he was a contributor to the columns of the periodical, and in 1870 he succeeded Mark Lemon as editor. One of his best known series of articles was &quot;The Essence of Parliament,&quot; a style of writing for which he was peculiarly fitted by his previous training in connection with the &quot;Morning Chronicle.&quot;

On 14 March 1872 Brooks was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. 

In January, 1874 he was a founder member of the Cremation Society of Great Britain, set up to campaign for the legalisation of cremation, but within a few weeks he had died.

Death found him in the midst of his books and papers working cheerfully amongst his family. Two articles, &quot;Election Epigrams&quot; and &quot;The Situation,&quot; were written on his death-bed, and before they were published he was dead. He died at 6 Kent Terrace, Regent&#x27;s Park, London, on 23 February 1874, and was buried in Kensal Green Cemetery on the 28th.

He married Emily Margaret, daughter of Dr. William Walkinshaw of Naparima, Trinidad. She was granted a civil list pension of £100 on 19 June 1876, and died on 14 May 1880. Their son, Reginald Shirley Brooks, was also a journalist.

<text>Maria Gowen(or Gowan) Brooks (pen name, A Lover of Fine Arts and María Del Occidente; 1794 – November 11, 1845) was an American poet. She impressed Edgar Allan Poe and the English Poet Laureate, Robert Southey, who promoted her best-known poem &quot;Zophiël&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Abigail Gowen was born in Medford, Massachusetts, 1794. Her father was a man of literary tastes, and she was exposed to a lot of poetry at home. By age nine, she had memorized a large quantity of prose. When Abigail was thirteen, her father died, bankrupt. She was taken under the care of a her widowed brother-in-law John Brooks, a Boston merchant who was more than thirty years older than she was. As her legal guardian, he proposed to her when she was 14 and they married when she was 16. She became the stepmother of his two children and the couple had an unhappy marriage, especially after John lost his fortune in investments related to the War of 1812.

==Career==
With the family&#x27;s financial reverses and living in comparative poverty, Abigail began to write poetry as consolation. Around this time, she changed her name to &quot;Maria Abigail&quot;, which would eventually become, simply, &quot;Maria&quot;. Also around this time, at age nineteen, she had written her first epic poem. It is described as a &quot;metrical romance&quot;, which she never published.

In the hopes of earning some income, in 1820 Brooks published her first collection of poetry, &quot;Judith, Esther, and other Poems&quot;, under the pseudonym &quot;A Lover of Fine Arts&quot;. In 1823, the husband died, and Brooks went to live with her brother on his coffee plantation in Manzanas, Cuba. He died soon after her arrival, which left her with a &quot;settled income&quot;. During this time, she began to write the poem she would become most famous for: &quot;Zophiël, or the Bride of Seven&quot;, based on the story of Sara in the Book of Tobit.

In 1824, Brooks made a sojourn to Canada, where she became engaged to a Canadian soldier she had met in New England (prior to John Brooks’ death). However, they became estranged, &quot;through a series of misunderstandings&quot;, and Brooks subsequently attempted suicide, twice. Upon returning to the United States, in 1825, she published the first canto of &quot;Zophiël&quot; in Boston. In 1826, Brooks began a correspondence with the English Poet Laureate, Robert Southey, who praised her work heartily and gave her the pseudonym &quot;María Del Occidente&quot; (Maria of the West). He regarded her as &quot;the most impassioned and imaginative of all poetesses&quot;, but time did not sustain this verdict. She also caught the attention of Edgar Allan Poe. He, too, praised her work, and often mentioned her favorably in his literary reviews.

Brooks finished &quot;Zophiël&quot; in 1829, but did not publish it immediately. First, she took her son, Horace Brooks, to Hanover, New Hampshire, to try to enroll him at West Point. She was unsuccessful. However, in the same year, she visited Paris, and there met the Marquis de Lafayette, a man renowned for his heroic services in the American Revolutionary War. He was easily able to secure a position at West Point for Brooks&#x27;s son, who went on to be modestly successful there.

In 1831, she went to England and spent a few weeks at Southey&#x27;s home. There, he oversaw the publishing of &quot;Zophiël&quot; in London. She then returned to the United States and lived in New England for approximately twelve years. In 1843, she serially published a &quot;prose account of her unhappy love affair&quot;, called &quot;Idomen; or, the Vale of Yumuri&quot;, in a Boston newspaper. In December of the same year, she returned to her Cuban estate and published another poem, &quot;Ode to the Departed&quot;.

She died in 1845, at age 51, of tropical fever. She had been working on a romance at the time, &quot;Beatriz, Beloved of Columbus&quot;, which was never published. She was buried in Limonar Church Cemetery in Matanzas, Cuba.

<doc id="931720" wikidata="Q332595" url="?curid=931720" title="John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton">
<text>John Cam Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton, (27 June 1786 – 3 June 1869), known as Sir John Hobhouse, Bt, from 1831 to 1851, was an English politician and diarist.
==Early life==
Born at Redland near Bristol, Broughton was the eldest son of Sir Benjamin Hobhouse, 1st Baronet, and Charlotte, daughter of Samuel Cam. He was educated at Westminster School, and at Trinity College, Cambridge where he graduated in 1808. Broughton took the Hulsean prize in 1808 for his &quot;Essay on the Origin and Intention of Sacrifices&quot;. At Cambridge he founded the Whig Club and the Amicable Society.

==Friendship with Lord Byron and mainland European journeys==
While at Cambridge Broughton became good friends with Lord Byron, who accompanied him on a tour through Spain, Greece and Turkey in 1809. Hobhouse was present at the Battle of Dresden in August 1813, and, following the Coalition armies into France, he saw Louis XVIII enter Paris in May 1814.

In 1815 Broughton was again in Paris after the return of Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba (see &quot;Hundred Days&quot;), and showed his dislike of the House of Bourbon and his sympathy with Bonaparte by writing in 1816 a pamphlet entitled &quot;The substance of some letters written by an Englishman resident in Paris during the last reign of the emperor Napoleon&quot;. This caused some offence in England and more in France, and the French translation was seized by the government. Both the translator and the printer were imprisoned.

A further period of travel with Byron followed, and at this time Hobhouse wrote some notes to the fourth canto of &quot;Childe Harold&quot;. This canto was afterwards dedicated to him, and a revised edition of a part of his notes entitled &quot;Historical illustrations of the fourth canto of &quot;Childe Harold&quot; containing dissertations on the ruins of Rome and an essay on Italian literature&quot;, was published in 1818. He shared Byron&#x27;s enthusiasm for the liberation of Greece. After the poet&#x27;s death in 1824, Hobhouse proved his will, and superintended the arrangements for his funeral.

==Parliament==
In February 1819 Hobhouse was the Radical candidate at a by-election for the representation of the City of Westminster, but he failed to secure election. He had already gained some popularity by writing in favour of reform, and in 1819 spoke the following words: &quot;I am a man chosen for the people, by the people; and, if elected, I will do no other business than that of the people&quot;. 

In the same year (1819) he issued &quot;A defence of the People in reply to Lord Erskine&#x27;s &quot;Two Defences of the Whigs,&quot;&quot; followed by &quot;A trifling mistake in Thomas, Lord Erskine&#x27;s recent preface&quot;. The House of Commons declared this latter pamphlet a breach of privilege. Hobhouse was arrested for the pamphlet on 14 December 1819. In spite of an appeal to the court of king&#x27;s bench, he remained imprisoned in Newgate Prison until the end of the following February. However this proceeding only increased his popularity, and at the general election of 1820 he was returned for Westminster.

In parliament Hobhouse proved a valuable recruit to the Reform party, and is credited with the invention of the phrase &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s (Loyal) Opposition&quot; made in 1826 during a speech in the House of Commons.

Having succeeded his father as 2nd baronet in 1831, Hobhouse was appointed secretary at war in the Whig administration of Lord Grey in February 1832, and was made a Privy Councillor. He effected some reforms and economies during his tenure of this office (he was responsible for the passing of the Vestry Act 1831), but, unable to carry out all his wishes.

Hobhouse became Chief Secretary for Ireland in March 1833. He had only held this post for a few weeks when, in consequence of his refusal to vote with the government against the abolition of the Doors and Windows Tax, he resigned both his office and his seat in parliament. At the subsequent election he was defeated.

Hobhouse joined the cabinet as First Commissioner of Woods and Forests when Lord Melbourne became Prime Minister in July 1834, and about the same time Hobhouse was returned at a by-election as one of the members for Nottingham. In Melbourne&#x27;s government of 1835 he was President of the Board of Control, in which position he strongly supported the Indian policy of Lord Auckland. He returned to the same office in July 1846 as a member of Lord John Russell&#x27;s cabinet.

In February 1851 Hobhouse went to the House of Lords as Baron Broughton, of Broughton-de-Gyfford in the County of Wiltshire. He left office when Russell resigned in February 1852.

==Later life==
In 1840 Hobhouse was appointed Colonel of the Wiltshire Militia; although disembodied, the regiment received the &#x27;Royal&#x27; prefix a year later. When the Militia was reformed in 1852 he retained the colonelcy. He gave up the command in 1859 and was appointed the regiment&#x27;s Honorary Colonel.

In 1852 Hobhouse was also made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB), and took little part in political life, being mainly occupied in literary pursuits and in correspondence. Lord Broughton was a partner in Whitbread&#x27;s brewery and a fellow of the Royal Society. He was one of the founders of the Royal Geographical Society which formed on 16 July 1830.

In the opinion of the author of his biography in the Encyclopaedia Britannica (1911) he was a good classical scholar, and although not eloquent, an able debater.

==Family==
Lord Broughton married Lady Julia, daughter of George Hay, 7th Marquess of Tweeddale, in 1828. They had three daughters. Lady Julia died of tuberculosis in April 1835.

Hobhouse died in London on 3 June 1869. Being without heir male, the barony lapsed on his death. The baronetcy passed to his nephew, Charles Parry Hobhouse.

<text>George Douglas Brown (26 January 1869 – 28 August 1902) was a Scottish novelist, best known for his highly influential realist novel &quot;The House with the Green Shutters&quot; (1901), which was published the year before his death at the age of 33.

==Life and work==
Brown was the illegitimate son of a farmer and a woman of Irish descent. He went to school at Ochiltree, Coylton, and Ayr, his academic performance allowing him to study Classics at the University of Glasgow and at Balliol College, Oxford. However his studies were interrupted by the illness of his mother; he returned to Ayrshire to nurse her, but she died, and in 1895 he barely passed his final examinations. He travelled to London and worked as a journalist, contributing articles and stories to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, as well as a part-time editor and reader for publishing houses. At one point he was a staff writer for &quot;Sandow&#x27;s Magazine of Physical Culture&quot;. In 1899 he published &quot;Love and a Sword&quot; under the pseudonym Kennedy King, the same pseudonym he used for his articles. The next year he started work at Haslemere on &quot;The House with the Green Shutters&quot;, which was published in 1901 under the pseudonym George Douglas. The book was a success, and he planned a second novel to be called &quot;The Incompatibles&quot;, but shortly afterwards he contracted pneumonia and died at the home of his friend and publisher Andrew Melrose.

The novel gives a strongly outlined picture of the harder and less genial aspects of Scottish life and character, and was regarded as a useful corrective to the more roseate presentations of the kailyard school of J. M. Barrie and Ian Maclaren. Reprinted frequently throughout the twentieth century, it was most recently re-issued by Birlinn of Edinburgh. An annual event in Brown&#x27;s memory, The Green Shutters Festival of Working Class Writing, is held in Ochiltree, the town believed to be the model for the village of Barbie.

In December 2004, the house in which he was born was gutted by fire.

As of August 2007, the house in which he was born in Ochiltree has been re-opened as &quot;The Green Shutters Pub&quot;. A memorial plaque is allocated on the outside wall.

The house is now used as a pharmacy.

<text>Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga is a Costa Rican parasitoid wasp whose host is the spider &quot;Leucauge argyra&quot;. The wasp is unusual in modifying the spider&#x27;s web building behavior to make a web made of very strong lines designed to support the wasp&#x27;s cocoon without breaking in the rain.

== Habitat ==
&quot;Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga&quot; is indigenous to Costa Rica. Its ideal habitat would include good sources of food, mating sites, and a stable population of their host spider. This parasitic wasp feeds on sugar and nectar and tends to be near heavy vegetation. The wasp prefers heavy vegetation because this provides both a good mating site as the wasps mate on tips of leaves and protection during development. Heavy vegetation provides thick undergrowth where the spider can spin their webs providing protection from heavy rains and winds.

==Reproduction==

&quot;Hymenoepimecis argyraphaga&quot; wasps have a haplodiploid genetic system, meaning unfertilized eggs will become males and fertilized eggs will become females. Wasp reproduction ratios can change based on seasonal changes and environmental stress. Depending on these factors, the egg will either be fertilized or be unfertilized. Males seek out females for reproduction, but seem to fly in random patterns above the undergrowth. They encounter females after they emerge from their cocoons and leave the underbrush. While the males seem to fly in random patterns, they locate the females within minutes, suggesting a long range pheromone. The male will land on the female and copulate which takes roughly 10 seconds. There has been no observed aggression between wasps when reproducing.

== Development ==
After copulation, the female wasp must find a host for her egg. First she must immobilize the host using venom from her ovipositor. This can be done in two different ways, she could either use a method of attack or a deceiving method. For the method of attack, the wasp would hover over its host until it had an opening to swing down and capture it by threading its legs through the web to tightly pin down the host. It would then jab the host repeatedly with the ovipositor, while injecting the host with venom. For the deceiving method, the wasp would act as if it was caught in the spiders web and lay still on its back. When the spider approaches, the wasp will grab onto the host and sting repeatedly until the spider stops struggling so the wasp can insert the ovipositor into the spider&#x27;s cephalothorax and continuously sting for 2 minutes. Once the host is paralyzed, the wasp has 5-10 minutes until the paralysis wears off. The wasp will then use the ovipositor to probe for existing eggs or larvae in the spider, and if she finds any, she will remove them to replace with her own egg. The egg is glued to the abdomen of the spider. 2-3 days later the first-instar larva will hatch, and partially emerge from the egg. The first instar will create a large hole in the spider&#x27;s abdomen in order to access the hemolymph. The larva will then feed on the hemolymph, creating a hardened saddle. During this time, the spider goes on about its normal web building and insect-catching behavior for the next one to two weeks. In another 2-3 days the second-instar larva will hatch and insert its hook-like structure into the hemolymph saddle and completely emerges from its egg. When the larva is ready to pupate, it releases a chemical induction that causes the host to spin a special web to make a cocoon for the larva, the design of which is completely different from any it has ever made, and then to sit motionless in the middle of this web. Even if the larva is removed prior to the web-building process, the spider still engages in aberrant web-spinning. Once the cocoon has been made the larva will kill its host and pupate. Seven days later metamorphosis happens and the wasp will live for 2-3 weeks.

== Behavior alterations of &quot;Plesiometa argyra&quot; ==
Normal web weaving consists of several steps:
#Build non-sticky frame lines attached to supporting objects and a few initial radial lines. This process sometimes involves establishing connections with surrounding objects by floating a line in the wind and hoping it catches somewhere.
#Add more non-sticky radial lines attached to these frame lines, in some cases adding at the same time less peripheral, &quot;secondary&quot; frame lines.
#Add several tight loops of non-sticky silk at the hub of the web.
#Lay a loose &quot;temporary&quot; spiral of non-sticky silk, starting near the hub and ending near the edge of the web with about five times the spacing of the final sticky silk.
#Draw the tight spiral of sticky silk starting at the edge of the web and working inward, and removing during the same process the loose spiral.
#Remove lines at the center of the hub, leaving a hole or (in some species) replacing them with other lines

The modified web that the larva causes the spider to build consists of several heavily reinforced radial lines that are attached directly to the substrate; sometimes one or more frame lines or vestiges of a &quot;temporary&quot; spiral are also included. The reinforced lines are built using a subset of the same sequence of movements that the spider performs during the construction of frame lines in the normal web, repeated many times over. Thus the larva appears to be able to induce very specific behavioral responses in the spider.

The lifecycle of the wasp was filmed for the BBC series &quot;Life in the Undergrowth&quot; (programme 4 in the series, &quot;Intimate Relations&quot;).

<doc id="931735" wikidata="Q667504" url="?curid=931735" title="Mu Arae">
<text>Mu Arae (μ Arae, abbreviated Mu Ara, μ Ara), often designated HD 160691, officially named Cervantes , is a main sequence G-type star approximately 50 light-years away from the Sun in the constellation of Ara. The star has a planetary system with four known extrasolar planets (designated Mu Arae b, c, d and e; later named Quijote, Dulcinea, Rocinante and Sancho, respectively), three of them with masses comparable with that of Jupiter. Mu Arae c, the innermost, was the first hot Neptune or super-Earth discovered.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;μ Arae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Mu Arae&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. HD 160691 is the entry in the Henry Draper Catalogue.

The established convention for extrasolar planets is that the planets receive designations consisting of the star&#x27;s name followed by lower-case Roman letters starting from &quot;b&quot;, in order of discovery. This system was used by a team led by Krzysztof Goździewski. On the other hand, a team led by Francesco Pepe proposed a modification of the designation system, where the planets are designated in order of characterization. Since the parameters of the outermost planet were poorly constrained before the introduction of the 4-planet model of the system, this results in a different order of designations for the planets in the Mu Arae system. Both systems agree on the designation of the 640-day planet as &quot;b&quot;. The old system designates the 9-day planet as &quot;d&quot;, the 310-day planet as &quot;e&quot; and the outer planet as &quot;c&quot;. Since the International Astronomical Union has not defined an official system for designations of extrasolar planets, the issue of which convention is &#x27;correct&#x27; remains open, however most subsequent scientific publications about this system appear to have adopted the Pepe &quot;et al.&quot; system, as has the system&#x27;s entry in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia.

In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched NameExoWorlds, a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars. The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names. In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Cervantes for this star and Quijote, Dulcinea, Rocinante and Sancho, for its planets (b, c, d, and e, respectively; the IAU used the Pepe &quot;et al&quot; system).

The winning names were those submitted by the Planetario de Pamplona, Spain. Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra (1547–1616) was a famous Spanish writer and author of &quot;El Ingenioso Hidalgo Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;. The planets are named after characters of that novel: Quijote was the lead character; Dulcinea his love interest; Rocinante his horse, and Sancho his squire.

In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.

== Stellar characteristics ==

According to measurements made by the Gaia astrometric satellite, Mu Arae exhibits a parallax of 64.0853 milliarcseconds as the Earth moves around the Sun. When combined with the known distance from the Earth to the Sun, this means the star is located at a distance of . Seen from Earth it has an apparent magnitude of +5.15 and is thus visible to the naked eye.

Asteroseismic analysis of the star reveals it is approximately 10% more massive than the Sun and significantly older, at around 6.34 billion years. The radius of the star is 28% greater than that of the Sun and it is 90% more luminous. The star contains twice the abundance of iron relative to hydrogen of the Sun and is therefore described as metal-rich. Mu Arae is also more enriched than the Sun in the element helium.

Mu Arae has a listed spectral type of G3IV–V. The G3 part means the star is similar to the Sun (a G2V star). The star may be entering the subgiant stage of its evolution as it starts to run out of hydrogen in its core. This is reflected in its uncertain luminosity class, between IV (the subgiants) and V (main sequence dwarf star stars like the Sun).

== Planetary system ==


=== Discovery ===
In 2001, an extrasolar planet was announced by the Anglo-Australian Planet Search team, together with the planet orbiting Epsilon Reticuli. The planet, designated Mu Arae b, was thought to be in a highly eccentric orbit of around 743 days. The discovery was made by analysing variations in the star&#x27;s radial velocity (measured by observing the Doppler shift of the star&#x27;s spectral lines) as a result of being pulled around by the planet&#x27;s gravity. Further observations revealed the presence of a second object in the system (now designated as Mu Arae e), which was published in 2004. At the time, the parameters of this planet were poorly constrained and it was thought to be in an orbit of around 8.2 years with a high eccentricity. Later in 2004, a small inner planet designated Mu Arae c was announced with a mass comparable with that of Uranus in a 9-day orbit. This was the first of the class of planets known as &quot;hot Neptunes&quot; to be discovered. The discovery was made by making high-precision radial velocity measurements with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph.

In 2006, two teams, one led by Krzysztof Goździewski and the other by Francesco Pepe independently announced four-planet models for the radial velocity measurements of the star, with a new planet (Mu Arae d) in a near-circular orbit lasting approximately 311 days. The new model gives revised parameters for the previously known planets, with lower eccentricity orbits than in the previous model and including a more robust characterization of the orbit of Mu Arae e. The discovery of the fourth planet made Mu Arae the second known four-planet extrasolar system, after 55 Cancri.

=== System architecture and habitability ===
The Mu Arae system consists of an inner Uranus-mass planet in a tight 9-day orbit and three massive planets, probably gas giants, on wide, near-circular orbits, which contrasts with the high-eccentricity orbits typically observed for long-period extrasolar planets. The Uranus-mass planet may be a chthonian planet, the core of a gas giant which has had its outer layers stripped away by stellar radiation. Alternatively it may have formed in the inner regions of the Mu Arae system as a rocky &quot;super-Earth&quot;.

The inner gas giants &quot;d&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are located close to the 2:1 orbital resonance which causes them to undergo strong interactions. The best-fit solution to the system is actually unstable: simulations suggest the system is destroyed after 78 million years, which is significantly shorter than the estimated age of the star system. More stable solutions, including ones in which the two planets are actually in the resonance (similar to the situation in the Gliese 876 system) can be found which give only a slightly worse fit to the data. A 2022 study finds a stable orbital fit to the system, and estimates a lower limit on the system inclination of about 20°.

Astrometric observations using the Hubble Space Telescope have not detected any of the known planets, but have set upper limits on the masses of the outer three planets: planet b is , planet d is , and planet e is . Searches for circumstellar discs show no evidence for a debris disc similar to the Kuiper belt around Mu Arae. If Mu Arae does have a Kuiper belt, it is too faint to be detected with current instruments.

The gas giant planet &quot;b&quot; is located in the liquid water habitable zone of Mu Arae. This would prevent an Earth-like planet from forming in the habitable zone, however large moons of the gas giant could potentially support liquid water. On the other hand, it is unclear whether moons sufficiently massive to retain an atmosphere and liquid water could actually form around a gas giant planet, due to a theorized scaling law between the mass of a planet and its satellite system. In addition, measurements of the star&#x27;s ultraviolet flux suggest that any potentially habitable planets or moons may not receive enough ultraviolet to trigger the formation of biomolecules. Planet &quot;d&quot; would receive a similar amount of ultraviolet to the Earth and thus lies in the ultraviolet habitable zone. However, it would be too hot for any moons to support surface liquid water.

<text>Joint Expeditionary Base–Little Creek (JEB–LC), formerly known as Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek and commonly called simply Little Creek, is the major operating base for the Amphibious Forces in the United States Navy&#x27;s Atlantic Fleet. The mission of the Naval Amphibious Base is to provide required support services to over 15,000 personnel of the 27 homeported ships and 78 resident and/or supported activities. The base&#x27;s combination of operational, support, and training facilities are geared predominantly to amphibious operations, making the base unique among bases of the United States and Allied Navies. 

The Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek is the largest base of its kind in the world. It comprises four locations in three states, including almost 12,000 acres (4,900 ha) of real estate. Its Little Creek location in Virginia Beach, Virginia, totals 2,120 acres (860 ha) of land. Outlying facilities include 350 acres (140 ha) located just north of Training Support Center Hampton Roads in Virginia Beach and 21 acres (8.5 ha) known as Radio Island at Morehead City, North Carolina, used for U.S. Coast Guard ships and personnel as well as serving as an amphibious embarkation and debarkation area for U.S. Marine Corps units at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. It is also home to the Naval School of Music.

On October 1, 2009, Little Creek and the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Story completed a two-year merger into one joint base, officially named Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek–Fort Story.

==History==
===World War II===
On July 16, 1942, a U.S. Navy truck drove off Shore Drive, the scenic highway along the south shore of the Chesapeake Bay between the resort areas of Ocean View in Norfolk and Virginia Beach in Princess Anne County. The resort town was located on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean several miles south of Cape Henry, at the entrance to the bay. Near an inlet called &quot;Little Creek&quot;, the truck stopped in a waterlogged bean field of the Whitehurst family&#x27;s farm. For days thereafter, trucks loaded with lumber and equipment rolled into the area in almost continuous succession. The reason for this mass assault in a bean field northeast of Norfolk was that, early in World War II, Navy planners saw a necessity for landing large numbers of American troops on foreign shores in the face of enemy gunfire. That such operations would be difficult was also evident. New methods and techniques in landing troops would have to be developed. Training would be needed before sufficient men were proficient in the complicated art of the amphibious assault, which would enable U.S. troops to drive to the heart of the enemy.

The base was initially established in the farmland of Princess Anne County. During the early phases of World War II the base was a combination of farmland and swamps. Four bases were constructed on this area: Camp Bradford, Camp Shelton, U.S. Naval Frontier Base, and Amphibious Training Base. Camps Bradford and Shelton were named for the former owners of the land. Camp Bradford was a training base for Navy Seabees, but in 1943 it was changed into a training center for the crews of landing ship, tanks. Camp Shelton was an armed guard training center for bluejackets serving on board merchant ships as gun crews. At the end of World War II it served as a separation center. The Frontier Base was the forwarding center for amphibious force personnel and equipment destined for the European theater. The Amphibious Training Base (also known as &quot;Little Creek&quot;) was the center for all types of amphibious training and the training of ship&#x27;s crews for landing ship medium, landing craft infantry, and landing craft utility; landing craft mechanized and landing craft vehicle personnel boat crews were also trained at Little Creek.

In a few months, the trained men who were to land fighting forces from Africa to Normandy were ready for sea. During World War II, over 200,000 Naval personnel and 160,000 Army and Marine Corps personnel trained at Little Creek.

===Post-World War II===
The four bases were partially inactivated at the end of hostilities of World War II. Shortly thereafter, however, the bases at Little Creek, because of their central location on the Atlantic coast, excellent and varied beach conditions, proximity to the naval facilities of Norfolk, berthing facilities for amphibious ships through the size of LSTs, and other advantages, were consolidated into the present installation and renamed the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek with a commissioning date of August 10, 1945. It was designated a permanent base in 1946.

Growing over the years to meet the needs of the amphibious force, the base has developed into one of the most modern in the Navy. Thousands of men and women from all branches of the Armed Forces, as well as military students from foreign nations, now pass through the gates of the Naval Amphibious Base yearly for training in amphibious warfare. Today nearly 13,000 sailors, Marines, and civilian employees are assigned to the various stations or attend schools at the Naval Amphibious Base, Little Creek in support of the Navy/Marine Corps team.

==Ferry Road==
The base remains bisected by a finger of land not part of the base. The land includes Ferry Road, a rail line, and the docks serving former cross-bay rail barge traffic of the defunct Bay Coast Railroad, formerly the Eastern Shore Railroad, to Cape Charles, Virginia. Ferry Road, crossed by the base&#x27;s &quot;Guam Road-Amphibious Drive bridge&quot;, once served the defunct Little Creek-Cape Charles Ferry which transported passengers and motor vehicles across the mouth of the bay to Cape Charles and Kiptopeke until replacement in 1964 by the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel.

<text>Leoben () is a Styrian city in central Austria, located on the Mur river. With a population in 2023 of about 25,140 it is a local industrial centre and hosts the University of Leoben, which specialises in mining. The Peace of Leoben, an armistice between Austria and France preliminary to the Treaty of Campo Formio, was signed in Leoben in 1797.

The Justice Centre Leoben is a prison designed by architect Josef Hohensinn, which was completed in 2005.

==Name==
Leoben was attested in historical sources as &quot;Liupina&quot; in AD 904. The name is of Slavic origin, meaning &#x27;beloved&#x27;, and is derived from the root &quot;ljub-&quot; &#x27;love&#x27;.

== Geography ==
Leoben is located in the Mur Valley, around eight kilometres east of Sankt Michael in Obersteiermark and 15 kilometres west of Bruck an der Mur. The old town centre was founded in the &quot;Murschleife&quot;, a meander. Today Leoben stretches on both sides of the river.

The area of the municipality is around 108 km², of which almost 79% is forested. The lowest point in the town is 515 metres above sea level, the highest point is the summit of the Wetterkogel at 1643 metres above sea level.

== Past and present ==
Leoben is known as the “Gateway to the Styrian Iron Road”. The 13th-century Main Square features the Hackl House with its baroque façade in red and white. The City Parish Church, St. Francis Xavier, built in 1660, comprises a 17th-century interior and is considered one of the most significant Jesuit churches in Austria. Also of note is the Art Nouveau Lutheran church which is at the upper end of the Franz-Josef-Strasse.

The oldest convent for women in Styria is Göss Abbey. Founded in 1020 A.D., it was run by the Benedictine nuns until it was dissolved in 1782 and made the see of short-lived Diocese of Leoben. The early Romanesque crypt is of note as is the &#x27;Gösser Ornat,&#x27; which can be seen in Vienna (Museum for Applied Arts). Next to the convent is the Gösser brewery, which includes a brewery museum.

Current cultural events include classical concerts in the Congress Leoben, productions of the Summer Philharmonic in July and performances of local and guest productions in the oldest operating theatre in Austria.

DSV Leoben is an Austrian association football club based in Leoben. The club currently play in Austrian 2. Liga, the second tier of Austrian Football. They play at the Donawitz Stadium.

== Tradition &amp; avantgarde ==
Leoben was shaped for centuries by the trade in iron and the research in raw materials carried out at the University of Leoben, which was founded in 1840. Mining traditions still play an important part in city life. Examples are the Miners&#x27; Parade, the St. Barbara Celebration or the &quot;Ledersprung&quot; (&quot;Leather Jump&quot;). The Gösser Kirtag, a street fair, takes place on the Thursday after the first Sunday in October and attracts tens of thousands of visitors to Leoben.

Other components of the vigorous cultural life of the &quot;Mining City&quot; include classical concerts in the Congress Leoben, productions of the Summer Philharmonics in July and performances of locally created and guest productions in the oldest still-running theatre in Austria.

<text>Leochares () was an ancient Greek sculptor from Athens, who lived in the 4th century BC.

==Works==

Leochares worked at the construction of the Mausoleum of Mausolos at Halicarnassus, one of the &quot;Seven Wonders of the Ancient World&quot;. The &quot;Diana of Versailles&quot; is a Roman copy of his original (). He is also thought to be the creator of the celebrated &quot;Apollo Belvedere&quot;, of which a Roman copy is currently housed in Vatican City.

Of his portrait-statues, the most celebrated were those of Philip, Alexander, Amyntas III, Olympias, and Eurydice I, which were made of ivory and gold, and were placed in the Philippeion, a circular building in the Altis at Olympia, erected by Philip II of Macedon in celebration of his victory at Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC).

<doc id="931758" wikidata="Q249107" url="?curid=931758" title="Kevin Richardson (musician)">
<text>Kevin Scott Richardson (born October 3, 1971) is an American pop singer, best known as a member of the vocal group the Backstreet Boys. Richardson was inducted into the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame with his cousin and bandmate Brian Littrell in 2015.

== Early life ==
Kevin Scott Richardson was born on October 3, 1971, in Lexington, Kentucky, the son of Ann Clyde (née Littrell) (June 11, 1943–January 22, 2022), homemaker, and Jerald Wayne Richardson Sr. (December 27, 1941–August 26, 1991), an outdoorsman, military veteran, construction worker, fireman, camp manager and handyman.

Growing up, Richardson lived on a 10-acre farm with his parents and two older brothers (Jerald Wayne Jr. and Tim), one of whom is a model, for 9 years, and later lived in a log cabin at Cathedral Domain Camp, an Episcopal church-owned youth camp which his father ran, where he worked as a camp counselor, met his best friend Keith, singer and now bodyguard, and was a regular at the camp talent shows until he was 18. In school he played little league baseball and football, which led him to play football in high school and being captain of his team called the Estill Engineers. Along with the other Backstreet Boys, Richardson took a DNA test which revealed that he is 44.1% English, 36.2% North and West European, and 19.7% Irish, Scottish, and Welsh.

At a young age, Richardson loved music and started learning to play the piano by ear when he was nine. He sang in his church&#x27;s choir since he was a child and was a part of his community and high school theater. He got his first keyboard when he was a high school freshman. It was just a short time before he was entertaining in restaurants and at weddings in a band called Paradise, which did covers of Bobby Brown and Journey. He also adored performing, participating in the school theater, was a member of the school&#x27;s drama club, and sang in the chorus. The latter ultimately won out of his two loves, acting and music. He was also a member of the chess club, Spanish club and participated in various school plays such as &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; and &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; at Estill County High School in Kentucky, where he was voted &quot;Most Popular&quot;, &quot;Best Dressed&quot;, &quot;Best Dancer&quot;, &quot;Best Look&quot; and &quot;Best Looking&quot;. He also was in a lot of talent shows, one where he sang a duet with a female classmate and played in a band where he was on the drums and another where he sang a song he wrote with Keith called As Time Goes By. His father Jerald Wayne Richardson died on August 26, 1991, after a two-year battle with cancer, when Kevin was 19.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
After graduating high school in 1989, Richardson spent the summer working at a Pizza Hut and tobacco farms, while helping out at the cathedral domain and was torn between entering the Air Force to join the Air Force band, or following the lure of performing by attending the New York American Music and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan. With encouragement from his father in 1990, Richardson quit his job, packed up and drove to Orlando, Florida with his best friend Jimmy, where he got a job as a cast member and performer at Walt Disney World. He played various characters, including Aladdin, one of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Prince Eric, Tigger, and Sebastian the Crab in the Little Mermaid show. He was also a backstage tour guide at MGM studios. At night, he did dinner theater, playing an Italian gangster in a musical review performing various songs from the musicals Chicago, Guys and Dolls, and Cabaret.

In June 1991, Richardson got a call from his mother, telling him that his father had taken a turn for the worse with his colon cancer. Richardson&#x27;s father was diagnosed in October 1990, but his family did not tell Richardson so that he would not worry. After the phone call, Richardson moved back home to Kentucky and stayed with his family. On August 26, 1991, Richardson&#x27;s father died. Richardson stayed in Kentucky for almost a year, then after encouragement from his mother, he went back to Florida to follow his dreams of a music career. He continued to work at Disney while also earning a living as a model, writing music, performing in dinner clubs, teaching ballroom dancing as a certified Latin and ballroom dance instructor, and was an extra for the film &quot;My Girl.&quot;&lt;ref name= &quot;BoxTree/Macmillan Publishers&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Florida, he got a job with a friend who had written a musical, he gave him a part and helped him get back on his feet again.

=== Backstreet Boys ===
In March 1993, Richardson was going to auditions at MGM Studios when a friend told him about &quot;Three guys who sang a capella all the time.&quot; Around the same time, he was working at a convention as an atmosphere dancer when he met a woman named Lisa Fischetti, whose husband was Lou Pearlman&#x27;s right-hand man for 12 years. After seeing an ad about the vocal group, called the Backstreet Boys, he went to check them out, auditioned, and joined the group. However, after joining, the group was still looking for one more member, so Richardson called Brian Littrell, who is Richardson&#x27;s first cousin (Littrell&#x27;s father and Richardson&#x27;s mother are siblings), to ask him to audition for the group. Littrell was immediately accepted, and the next day, he joined the group.

Richardson is the oldest member and is often known as the big brother of the group. In November 1999, he was named &quot;People Magazine&quot; ″s Sexiest Pop Star, and the band signed a new $60 million deal with Jive Records. Richardson was a part of the group until June 2006, when he announced his departure from the group to pursue other projects and to start a family and &quot;move on with the next chapter of [his] life.&quot; He recorded five albums with the group in 13 years. On June 23, 2006, he issued the following statement on the band&#x27;s official website:

After 13 years of what can only be described as a dream come true, I have decided that it is time to leave the Backstreet Boys. It was a very tough decision for me, but one that was necessary in order to move on with the next chapter of my life. Howie, Brian, A.J., and Nick will always be my little brothers and have my utmost love and support. I would like to thank the Backstreet fans for all the beautiful memories we have shared together and look forward to including you in the next phase of my life. I wish my brothers continued success and look forward to their new album.

On November 23, 2008, for the first time since leaving the group, Richardson rejoined his former bandmates on stage in Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles, performing the encore, &quot;Shape of My Heart&quot; with the group.

The Backstreet Boys, including Richardson, appeared on the November 4, 2010, episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show.&quot; Richardson first appeared in a pre-taped segment in which they surprised a fan who thought she was merely being flown in to participate in a &quot;Backstreet Boys&#x27; Biggest Fan&quot; contest. Moments later, Richardson joined the group in the show&#x27;s studio and performed &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; live with them.

On July 1, 2011, Richardson again joined the Backstreet Boys on stage at the Staples Center, Los Angeles, as part of the NKOTBSB Tour, performing &quot;I Want It That Way&quot; with the group and the mash-up at the end of the show along with NKOTB members.

On October 25, 2011, episode of &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest,&quot; Richardson stated that he was going to be at a Backstreet Boys beach party in Nassau, Bahamas on December 3, 2011. The party is part of the group&#x27;s second annual cruise. In addition to being at the party, Richardson performed several songs with the group on the boat in the evening (&quot;Drowning&quot; and &quot;I Still...&quot;). In the announcement, he also stated that he would love to perform with the group again regularly. The group had hinted at a possible return for Richardson during the beach party, but nothing was confirmed.

Several months later, before the group&#x27;s European tour with New Kids on the Block, Richardson had flown out to London with Nick and AJ in April 2012. Fans at the airport asked if he was back with the group and why he was with them. Richardson stated that he was only there to hang out with them. On April 29, 2012, during a live show in London, England, Backstreet Boys confirmed that Richardson was back permanently with the group and would be recording a new album with them in July 2012. Richardson also appeared along with the group on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; on July 17, 2012, announcing his return, their new album, and their first performance as a five-piece group for the first time together since 2006 at the morning show&#x27;s Summer Concert Series on August 31, 2012. It was also his first TV appearance with the group since he returned. Regarding his return, Richardson gave the following statement about why he had left the group: &quot;I&#x27;m a person that always follows my heart and follows my gut, and my heart said now&#x27;s the time. It just felt right. I feel inspired to make music again with these guys, and you know, when I left, it had nothing at all to do with our relationship. It just had to do with me just needing to be inspired, so I had to step away for a while.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot; on July 24, 2012, Richardson explained that he returned to the group because he realized how much joy singing and music gave him. He cited his holiday show with Rob Gonzalez called &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; (December 18, 2011, in Los Angeles), which helped him rediscover his love of music and how much he missed it.

=== Solo career ===
Outside the group, Richardson completed various projects. He composed the soundtrack to the animated film &quot;The Spirit Bear&quot; in 2003, which was set to be released in 2010 after several years of delay.

In August 2003, Kevin joined forces with longtime friend Keith McGuffey and opened a Music Academy called The Music Workshop in Louisville, Kentucky. The academy opened to help others learn the &#x27;tricks of the trade&#x27; of the music industry – studio technology, songwriting, and contract negotiations.

On December 18, 2011, Richardson headlined a Christmas concert titled &quot;Home for the Holidays&quot; with Rob Gonzalez. The concert was hosted by Montage Beverly Hills luxury hotel, benefiting the Angeles Clinic Foundation of Los Angeles.

In 2012, Richardson began working on his first solo album. During the 2013 Backstreet Boys cruise, when each member had their events, Richardson performed an event called Cover Story, where he performed various covers of songs. He had mentioned that he would release an album called &quot;Cover Story.&quot; The album would include songs that have influenced him over the years. The album was supposed to be released in 2012 but was delayed as he returned as an active member of the Backstreet Boys the same year. On May 9, 2015, he posted on YouTube a new track he recorded from his &quot;Cover Story&quot; album that he planned to release in 2015. The song was &quot;She&#x27;s Got a Way,&quot; a cover of the Billy Joel song. As of 2022, the album has not been released.

=== Modeling career ===
Richardson has been a model for Versace. He also modeled for Vogue and is a brand ambassador for TAG Heuer.

=== Acting career ===
Along with the rest of the Backstreet Boys, Richardson has made appearances on &quot;Arthur&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, and &quot;This Is the End&quot;.

During the Backstreet Boys&#x27; hiatus in 2003, Richardson went into acting. He played the role of smooth-talking lawyer Billy Flynn in the Broadway production of &quot;Chicago&quot;. He was a part of the show in New York City (January 20 – March 9), Pittsburgh (July 26–27), San Francisco (August 6–24), and the West End of London (September 22 – November 1). In 2003, he made an appearance on &quot;Punk&#x27;d&quot; where he got punk&#x27;d by Ashton Kutcher.

Richardson, along with Howie D., appeared in Krystal Harris &#x27;s music video &quot;Supergirl!&quot;, from &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot; soundtrack.

After leaving the group, he returned to performing in &quot;Chicago.&quot; On November 14, 2006, he returned to New York City with many &quot;Chicago&quot; alumni for the 10th anniversary of the show. From late November to December 3, 2006, Richardson played the role of Billy Flynn in Toronto, and in Japan in February 2007. He returned to Japan with the show in September 2009 through early October and then in Louisville, Kentucky, from October 29 to November 1, 2009.

Richardson also filmed some movies during his time away from the group. His first film was the 2009 Christian drama &quot;Love Takes Wing&quot;, based on a book by Janette Oke, playing the part of Cyrus in 2009.

Richardson filmed some small independent movies in 2010. He starred in &quot;The Bloody Indulgent&quot;, a vampire-themed musical film, also starred opposite Susan Traylor, Daniela Sea, Pleasant Gehman, Garrett Swann and Michael Maize in Steve Balderson&#x27;s feature film drama &quot;The Casserole Club&quot;. Richardson had won an Independent Vision Award for Best Actor in the film at Vision Fest in New York City in 2011. and a short film &quot;Unwound&quot; in 2011. It is an entry for Producers Guild of America premiere Weekend Shorts Event contest to benefit the Debra Hill Foundation. The short film only took 51 hours from script to final cut.

In 2013, Richardson and the other Backstreet Boys appeared as fictional versions of themselves in the comedy film &quot;This Is the End.&quot;

In 2015, Richardson filmed an independent film called &quot;If I Could Tell You,&quot; a short movie about infertility, which was released in 2016, where he also talked about his struggle with having children.

== Charity ==
Just Within Reach (JWR) was formed by Richardson and started in honor of his father, Jerald Wayne Richardson. Richardson wanted to name the foundation after his father, whom he lost to cancer. Richardson formed the JWR foundation to provide environmental education and promote personal responsibility and accountability concerning the health of the Earth. The foundation was founded in January 2001. He also ran with the Olympic torch for the foundation in Los Angeles, California, on January 15, 2001, and did various events for the foundation. It has been many years since he has done anything with the foundation and reportedly closed it.

== Personal life ==
Richardson is a first cousin of fellow Backstreet Boys member Brian Littrell and first cousin once removed of Baylee Littrell, son of Brian.

Richardson has been married to Kristin Kay Willits, a dancer, actress, photographer, and model, since 2000. They met when they both worked together at Disney World in June 1992. Kristin was dancing in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; as a jello-mold and a maid while playing the character of Snow White in &quot;The Lion King&quot; Show. She was also part of Radio City Rockettes in 1994 and one of Cher&#x27;s dancers on her &quot;Do You Believe&quot; tour. Kristin was also featured in one of the Backstreet Boys&#x27; earliest videos, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Break Your Heart,&quot; and as one of the dancers at the American Music Awards in 1999. They dated privately on and off for 7–8 years, breaking up in 1996 and getting back together in late 1997/early 1998.

<text>The lesser kudu (Tragelaphus imberbis) is a medium-sized bushland antelope found in East Africa. The species is a part of the ungulate genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; (family Bovidae), along with several other related species of striped, spiral-horned African bovids, including the related greater kudu, the bongo, bushbuck, common and giant elands, nyala and sitatunga. It was first scientifically described by English zoologist Edward Blyth (1869). 

The lesser kudu’s nose-to-tail length is typically . Males reach about at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh and females . Horns are present only on males. The spiral horns are long, and have 2-2.5 complete twists. The lesser kudus have very distinctive physical markings; females and juveniles have a golden-brown coat, with white vertical stripes on their sides, while the males develop into a dark grey colour—after about two years—and grow a pronounced “streak” of shaggy hair down the centre of their backs. Males retain the golden-brown color only on the shins, with the top of each thigh having a darker black band separating it from the grey body. The inner thighs are white. Males also have distinct black “masks” on their faces, with a black underside going up to the sternum. Males and females both display a series of unique white markings and patches, including white lips, two small spots on both cheeks, a spot at the base of each ear, two spots between the eyes, white eyelids, a white throat patch, and a patch of white atop the chest. These markings may aid in camouflaging and hiding amidst shrubbery, as well as helping to cool specific areas of the body by being white.

A pure browser, the lesser kudu subsists off of foliage from tall bushes, trees (fresh branch shoots, twigs) and herbaceous perennial plants. Despite seasonal and local fluctuations, foliage from trees and shrubs constitutes 60–80% of their diet throughout the year. The lesser kudu is mainly crepuscular, preferring to be active after dusk until the dawn hours, seeking shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. The lesser kudu exhibits no territorial behaviour, and fights are rare. While females are gregarious, adult males prefer being solitary. No fixed breeding season is seen; births may occur at any time of the year. The lesser kudu inhabits dry bushland regions, bordering on arid grasslands, as well as scrubland and light open forest habitat.

The lesser kudu is native to Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is possibly extirpated from Djibouti. It may have been present in Saudi Arabia and Yemen as recently as 1967, though its presence in the Arabian Peninsula is still controversial. The total population of the lesser kudu has been estimated to be nearly 118,000, with a decreasing trend in populations. One-third of the populations survive in protected areas. Presently, the International Union for Conservation of Nature rates the lesser kudu as &quot;near threatened&quot;.

==Taxonomy and genetics==
The scientific name of the lesser kudu is &quot;Tragelaphus imberbis&quot;. The animal is classified under the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; in family Bovidae. It was first described by the English zoologist Edward Blyth in 1869. The generic name, &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;, derives from Greek word &quot;tragos&quot;, meaning a male goat, and &quot;elaphos&quot;, which means a deer, while the specific name &quot;imberbis&quot; comes from the Latin term meaning unbearded, referring to this kudu&#x27;s lack of mane. The vernacular name kudu (or koodoo) may have originated from the Khoikhoi &quot;kudu&quot;, or via the Afrikaans &quot;koedoe&quot;. The term &quot;lesser&quot; denotes the smaller size of this antelope as compared to the greater kudu.

In 1912, the genus &quot;Ammelaphus&quot; was established for just the lesser kudu by American zoologist Edmund Heller, the type species being &quot;A. strepsiceros&quot;. The lesser kudu is now typically placed in &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;. However, a 2011 publication by Colin Groves and Peter Grubb argues for the lesser kudu&#x27;s renewed placement in the genus &quot;Ammelaphus&quot; on the grounds that this species is part of the earliest-diverging lineage of its tribe, having split from the main lineage before it separated into &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; and &quot;Taurotragus&quot;.

In 2005, Sandi Willows-Munro (of the University of KwaZulu-Natal) and colleagues carried out a mitochondrial analysis of the nine &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; species. mtDNA and nDNA data were compared. The results showed that the tribe Tragelaphini is monophyletic with the lesser kudu basal in the phylogeny, followed by the nyala (&quot;T. angasii&quot;). On the basis of mitochondrial data, the lesser kudu separated from its sister clade around 13.7 million years ago. However, the nuclear data show that lesser kudu and nyala form a clade, and collectively separated from the sister clade 13.8 million years ago.

The lesser kudu has 38 diploid chromosomes. However, unlike others in the subfamily Tragelaphinae, the X chromosome and Y chromosome are compound and each is fused with one of two identical autosomes.

The lesser kudu is a spiral-horned antelope. The head-and-body length is typically between . Males reach about at the shoulder, while females reach . Males typically weigh and females . The bushy tail is long, white underneath and with a black tip at the end.

Distinct signs of sexual dimorphism are seen in the antelope. The male is considerably larger than the female. The females, as well as juveniles, have a rufous coat, whereas the males become yellowish grey or darker after the age of 2 years. The male has a prominent black crest of hair on the neck, but this feature is not well-developed in the female. One long white stripe runs along the back, with 11–14 white stripes branching towards the sides. The chest has a central black stripe, and no throat beard is present. A black stripe runs from each eye to the nose and a white one from each eye to the centre of the dark face. A chevron is present between the eyes. The area around the lips is white, the throat has white patches, and two white spots appear on each side of the lower jaw. The underparts are completely white, while the slender legs are tawny and have black and white patches. The lesser kudu is characterised by large, rounded ears. Its tracks are similar to the greater kudu&#x27;s. Females have four teats. The average lifespan is 10 years in the wild, and 15 years in captivity.

Horns are present only on males. The spiral horns are long, and have two to two-and-a-half twists. The base circumference is . The slender horns are dark brown and tipped with white. Male young begin developing horns after 6-8 months, which reach full length after 3 years.

==Ecology and behaviour==

The lesser kudu is mainly active at night and during the dawn, and seeks shelter in dense thickets just after the sunrise. It can camouflage so well in such dense vegetation that only its ears and tail can indicate its presence. The midday is spent in rest and rumination in shaded areas. The animal spends about equal time foraging, standing and lying, and roaming. As a thin tragelaphine, the lesser kudu can move readily through dense vegetation with ease. The lesser kudu is a shy and wary animal. When alarmed, the animal stands motionless. If it senses any approaching predator, it gives out a short sharp bark, similar to the bushbuck&#x27;s, then makes multiple leaps up to high with an upraised tail. If captured by the predator, the victim gives a loud bleat.

Lesser kudus are gregarious in nature, especially females. No distinct leader or any hierarchy is noted in the social structure; with no territorial behavior, fights are uncommon. While fighting, the lesser kudus interlock horns and try pushing one another. Mutual grooming is hardly observed. Unlike most tragelaphines, females can be closely associated for several years. One to three females, along with their offspring, may form a group. Juvenile males leave their mothers when aged a year and a half, and may form pairs. However, at the age of 4-5 years, males prefer a solitary lifestyle and avoid one another, though four or five bulls may share the same home range. Lesser kudu do not usually associate with other animals, except when they feed in the same area.

===Diet===

A pure browser, the lesser kudu feeds on foliage from bushes and trees (shoots, twigs) and herbs. It also eats flowers and fruits if available, and takes small proportions of grasses, usually in the wet season. Despite seasonal and local variations, foliage from trees and shrubs constitutes 60-80% of the diet throughout the year. Foliage from creepers and vines (such as &quot;Thunbergia guerkeana&quot; and some species of Cucurbitaceae and Convulvulaceae) forms 15-25% of the diet in the wet season. Fruits are consumed mainly in the dry season. Olfactory searching, much in the same posture as grazing, is used to find fallen fruits (such as &quot;Melia volkensii&quot; and &quot;Acacia tortilis&quot;), while small fruits (such as &quot;Commiphora&quot; species) are directly plucked from trees. The size and structure of its stomach also suggests its primary dependence on browse.

The lesser kudu browses primarily at dusk or dawn, or nocturnally, and is sometimes associated with gerenuk and the impala. The lesser kudu and the gerenuk might compete for evergreen species in the dry season. However, unlike the long-necked gerenuk, the lesser kudu rarely consumes &quot;Acacia&quot; species, and does not stand on its hindlegs while feeding. The lesser kudu likewise does not have a great requirement for water, and can thrive in arid environments as it is able to extract sufficient moisture from succulent plants, such as the leaves of wild sisal and &quot;Sansevieria&quot; (&#x27;snake-plants&#x27;, genus &quot;Dracaena&quot;), and certain species of the poisonous Euphorbiaceae family; it drinks water readily when rains come or when sources are available.

===Reproduction===
Both the males and females become sexually mature by the time they are a year and a half old. However, males actually mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season, births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs gasping movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.

The gestational period is 7-8 months, after which a single calf is born. A female about to give birth isolates herself from her group, and remains alone for some days afterward. The newborn calf weighs . Around 50% of the calves die within the first six months of birth, and only 25% can survive after three years. In a study at Basle Zoo (Switzerland), where 43% of the offspring from captive breeding died before reaching the age of six months, the major causes of high juvenile mortality were found to be the spread of white muscle disease and deficiency of vitamin E and selenium in diets. The herd size, sex, interbreeding, and season did not play any role in juvenile mortality. The mother hides her calf while she goes out to feed, and returns mainly in the evening to suckle her young. She checks the calf&#x27;s identity by sniffing its rump or neck. In the first month, suckling may occur for 8 minutes. The mother and calf communicate with low bleats. She licks her offspring, particularly in the perineal region, and may consume its excreta.

==Habitat and distribution==
The lesser kudu inhabits dry bushland regions. It is closely associated with &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Commiphora&quot; thornbush in semiarid areas of northeastern Africa. The animal avoids open areas and long grass, preferring shaded areas with short grasses instead. Found in woodlands and hilly areas, as well, the lesser kudu is generally found at altitudes below ; though they have been recorded at heights about near Mount Kilimanjaro. While individual home ranges of these animals are in size, those of males have an average size of and those of females .

The lesser kudu is native to Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, but it is extinct in Djibouti. Largely confined to the Horn of Africa today, the species historically ranged from Awash (Ethiopia) southward through southern and eastern Ethiopia, and most parts of Somalia (except the north and the northeast) and Kenya (except the southwest). It also occurred in southeastern Sudan and northeastern and eastern parts of Uganda and Tanzania. Evidence for its existence in the Arabian Peninsula includes a set of horns obtained in 1967 from an individual shot in South Yemen and another in Saudi Arabia, as well as a recent analysis of early and middle Holocene rock art sites in Jubbah and Shuwaymis, Ha&#x27;il province, Saudi Arabia.

==Threats and conservation==
The lesser kudu&#x27;s shyness and its ability to camouflage itself in dense cover has protected it from the risks of poaching. For instance, the lesser kudu is widespread in the Ogaden region, which is rich in dense bush, despite reckless hunting by local people. However, rinderpest outbreaks, to which the lesser kudu is highly susceptible, have resulted in a steep decline of 60% in the animal&#x27;s population in Tsavo National Park in Kenya. Overgrazing, human settlement, and loss of habitat are some other threats to the survival of the lesser kudu.

The total population of the lesser kudu has been estimated to be nearly 118,000, with a decreasing trend in populations. The rate of decline has increased to 20% over two decades. Presently, the IUCN rates the lesser kudu as &quot;near threatened&quot;. Around a third of the population of the lesser kudu occurs in protected areas such as Awash, Omo and Mago National Parks (Ethiopia); Lag Badana National Park (Somalia); Tsavo National Park (Kenya); Ruaha National Park and game reserves (Tanzania), though it occurs in larger numbers outside these areas. Population density rarely exceeds 1/km2., and is generally much lower.

The handsome head of the male lesser kudu, with his elegant spiraled horns, is the symbol of the Saint Louis Zoo.

<doc id="931770" wikidata="Q450246" url="?curid=931770" title="Luis de León">
<text>Luis de León (Belmonte, Cuenca, 1527 – Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Castile, Spain, 23 August 1591), was a Spanish lyric poet, Augustinian friar, theologian and academic.

While serving as professor of Biblical scholarship at the University of Salamanca, Fray Luis also wrote many immortal works of Spanish Christian poetry and translated both Biblical Hebrew poetry and Latin Christian poetry into the Spanish language. Despite being a devout and believing Roman Catholic priest, Fray Luis was descended from a family of Spanish Jewish Conversos and this, as well as his vocal advocacy for teaching the Hebrew language in Catholic universities and seminaries, drew false accusations from the Dominican Order of the heresies of being both a Marrano and a Judaiser. Fray Luis was accordingly imprisoned for four years by the Spanish Inquisition before he was ruled to be completely innocent of any wrongdoing and released without charge. While the conditions of his imprisonment were never harsh and he was allowed complete access to books, according to legend, Fray Luis started his first post-Inquisition University of Salamanca lecture with the words, &quot;As I was saying the other day...&quot;

According to Edith Grossman, &quot;Fray Luis is generally considered the leading poet in the far-reaching Christianization of the Renaissance in Spain during the sixteenth-century. This means that as a consequence of the Counter-Reformation, and especially of the judgments and rulings of the Council of Trent, the secular Italianate forms and themes brought into Spain by Garcilaso were used by subsequent writers to explore moral, spiritual, and religious topics. The poets and humanists who were the followers of Fray Luis in the sixteenth-century formed the influential School of Salamanca.&quot;

==Early life==
Luis de León was born in Belmonte, in the Province of Cuenca, in 1527 or 1528. His parents were Lope de León and Inés de Varela, and they had five children. His father practiced law, and it was due to his profession that the family moved to Madrid in 1534, and later to Valladolid.

Luis obtained a very thorough and extensive education, and was devoted to the interpretation and translation of religious texts and ideas. He was proficient in Greek, Hebrew, and Latin.

He entered the University of Salamanca at the age of fourteen, in 1541, to study Canon Law under the care of his uncle Francisco. At some point between 1541 and 1543 (Thompson states that it was about 5–6 months after beginning his studies, while other authors often claim it was 1543), Luis abandoned his studies and instead entered the Order of the Hermits of St. Augustine. After a novitiate of uncertain duration he joined the Priory of San Pedro on 29 January 1544. The first record of León as a student of theology is in the matriculation book at the University of Salamanca for 1546-7.

In 1552, Fray Luis graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in theology from the University of Toledo and continued his education as a student of Hebrew and Biblical interpretation at the University of Alcalá de Henares.

==Academic career==

Having returned to Salamanca the previous year, in 1560 he graduated from the University of Salamanca as a licentiate (7 May) and Master of Theology (30 June), and in the following year he won the election to the Chair of St Thomas, a chair in Theology, at the same university (Salamanca was unusual in that all Chairs were subject to an election for the position). This was a minor Chair, with a limited four-year tenure. In 1565, he won the Chair of St Durandus, to which he was re-elected in 1569 (he lost it in 1573 because he was in prison while the elections took place). In 1566 he was named administrator of the Augustinian College of San Guillermo in Salamanca, and in 1567 he took on the position of vice rector of the University. In 1571 he attained the Chair of Sacred Letters as well.

While at the university, he translated classical and biblical literature and wrote on religious themes. He was widely known for his works.

==Imprisonment==
In 1571 Dominican professors Bartolomé de Medina and Castro put forth seventeen propositions to the Inquisition documenting Fray Luis&#x27; allegedly heretical opinions. His translation into Spanish and commentary of the &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; was the biggest evidence presented for their case against him. Another charge touched on his criticizing the text of the Vulgate.

As a result, he was imprisoned at Valladolid from 27 March 1572 until December 1576, fell ill and remained in bad health throughout his imprisonment. Though he suffered greatly from his isolation and less than desirable conditions, Fray Luis continued to actively write and study during his confinement.

At the end of 1576, the tables turned, and on 11 December Fray Luis was cleared of all charges and released from prison with an admonishment to be more careful and reserved in his publications and speech. He returned to Salamanca on 30 December in triumph.

Tradition has it that he began his university lecture on 29 January 1577, his first after returning from four years&#x27; imprisonment, with the words &quot;Dicebamus hesterna die&quot; (&quot;As we were saying yesterday...&quot;).

==Later life==

Fray Luis continued to teach at the university, being awarded a special chair at the end of 1576, shortly after his acquittal. In 1578 he obtained, for life, the chair of Moral Philosophy, and in 1579 was elected to the most significant chair in the university, the Chair of Holy Scripture (sometimes known as the chair of Biblical Studies or the Bible Chair).

He went on to earn a Master of the Arts degree from the University of Sahagún.

Fray Luis did not pay heed to the cautionary admonishments of the Inquisitorial committee after his earlier imprisonment. In 1582, he had another Inquisitional run-in, following three disputations held on the subject of the merits of Christ and human predestination, but was not this time imprisoned. He was absolved two years later, in 1584.

Fray Luis&#x27;s first published Spanish and Latin works emerged in 1580, some having been begun in prison; most of his works were printed during this decade. Between 1583 and 1585 he published the three books of his celebrated treatise, &quot;The Names of Christ&quot;, which he had written in prison. In 1583 also appeared the most popular of his prose works, &quot;The Perfect Wife&quot;, an instruction for newly married women.

In 1588, Fray Luis published the first collected edition of the writings of Teresa of Ávila. To produce this work, he had performed the task of collating her manuscripts, checking references and notes, and preparing a definitive text (although Teresa and León were both in Salamanca in late 1570, it is not believed they ever met in their lifetimes).

He died at the age of 64 on 23 August 1591, in Madrigal de las Altas Torres, Ávila, and is buried in Salamanca in the Priory of San Agustín. Ten days before his death he was elected Vicar General of the Augustinian Order.

==Major works==
===&quot;Cantar de los Cantares&quot; (translation of &quot;Song of Songs&quot;)===
In 1561, he began translating the Song of Songs into Spanish for his cousin, Isabel Osorio, a nun in Salamanca who could not read the Latin text, and wrote an accompanying commentary. This was León&#x27;s first major translation of a biblical text, and was probably inspired by a commentary his contemporary Arias Montano had lent to him when he passed through Salamanca in 1561.

Translation of biblical texts into Spanish had been banned by the Council of Trent, so there was a certain risk in this undertaking. The manuscript, however, was popular amongst his friends, who copied it and circulated it privately. However, the translations formed part of the accusations levelled against León when he was denounced to the Inquisition in 1572.

Because of the controversial nature of the text, it was not published until 1798.

===&quot;In Cantica Canticorum Salomonis explanatio &quot;(&quot;Commentary on the Song of Solomon&quot;)===
This was published in 1580, and built on an earlier Spanish commentary. He revised and enlarged it in a 1589 edition.

===&quot;La Perfecta Casada&quot; (&quot;The Perfect Wife&quot;)===
This book is Fray Luis’ interpretation of the Proverbs of Solomon, and was written as a moral exposition to his newly married young niece. It advises all young women on the proper behavior and duties of a married woman, both in regard to her husband and her children. The book quickly became a popular wedding gift to young women of the era, as it was an instruction manual for marriage. In addition, this book was a revolutionary defense of women’s roles in society at the time. It was first published in 1583, and was popular, appearing in six editions by 1632.

===&quot;De los Nombres de Cristo&quot; (&quot;The Names of Christ&quot;)===
Another well-known work, this was written as a guide to the layman about the essential principles of the church. It is written in dialogue form about three friends who discuss fourteen of the Scriptural names of Christ over a period of two days in a country estate. Each book ends in a lyrical meditation expressed in a poem. The predominant theme is the centrality and universality of Christ.

The work grew by stages. The first edition of 1583 is made up of only two books, considering nine names in total. The second edition of 1585 adds a third book, considering four names, and adds the name &#x27;shepherd&#x27; to the first book. Finally, the posthumous edition of 1595 includes one extra name, &#x27;lamb&#x27;. The structure of the third edition was used for the 1984 English translation.

The work quickly became popular in Spain: seven editions were printed by 1605.

===&quot;F Luysii Legionensis Augustiniani Theologiae Doctoris, &amp; Divinorum Librorum primi apud Salmanticenses interpretis explanatiorum in eosdem&quot;===
In 1589, Fray Luis published a volume of Latin commentaries on Obadiah, 2 Thessalonians, Galatians and the Song of Songs. These represent the summit of his achievement as a Biblical scholar.

===&quot;Exposición del Libro de Job&quot; (&quot;Commentary on the Book of Job&quot;)===
This is another contribution made by Fray Luis to make Scripture available to those who could not read Latin. In other words, he wanted ordinary people to be exposed to the Biblical message. The story tells of Job&#x27;s patience and suffering, and also serves as a correctional guide to man&#x27;s behavior. It is written in both verse and dialogue, to make it both enjoyable and informative. León began the work while in prison, and had completed thirty-five chapters by the end of 1580. He resumed work on it ten years later and finished the work in 1591, a few months before his death. He dedicated the work to Mother Ana de Jesús, to whom John of the Cross had dedicated his &quot;Spiritual Canticle&quot;. Fray Luis had come to know her in recent years, both in preparing the first edition of the works of Teresa of Avila, and in defending the privileges of the Discalced Carmelite nuns against proposed changes in the Teresan constitution.

It was first published in 1779.

===Twenty three original poems in Spanish===
Fray Luis composed a number of poems, the majority probably between 1559 and 1584. He did not publish them, but circulated them among his friends.

They were first published in 1631, when Quevedo printed them. The canon of Fray Luis&#x27;s poetry, as fixed by Hispanists, consists of twenty-nine poems.

See two of his most well-known examples below: &quot;The Life Removed&quot; and &quot;Ode to Salinas&quot;.

==Poetry Selections==

===&quot;The Life Removed&quot;===
In the poem &quot;The Life Removed&quot;, of which an excerpt is shown below, Fray Luis, following the &quot;beatus ille&quot; theme introduced by Horace, expounds upon the notion of choice and its consequences. He says that those irrational men who aspire to power and wealth and are guided by the talk and opinion of others will not achieve the peace, happiness, and liberty assured to those who travel the hidden path. The poem continues on to mention a ship in a storm, and how the sailors aboard are motivated only by greed and ambition, and they will not meet the harmonious end of those who travel the hidden path.
===&quot;Ode to Salinas&quot;===
Another well-known poem composed by Fray Luis is an ode written for his friend Francisco de Salinas. They frequently spoke about art and poetry, and listened to music together. Salinas was an organist and composer, who shared Fray Luis&#x27;s belief that music can make one more religious, and that it inspires man to contemplate spiritual matters. The ode, an excerpt of which is listed below, includes numerous positive images about music as a means to contemplate the divine and to overcome ignorance and foolishness.
==Later reputation==
In subsequent centuries, Fray Luis was especially praised in Spain as a poet. In 1631, the poet Francisco de Quevedo prepared an edition of León&#x27;s poems. In the eighteenth century he was the source of inspiration to various Neoclassical poets.

<doc id="931771" wikidata="Q7775258" url="?curid=931771" title="The Wishing-Chair (series)">
<text>The Wishing-Chair is a series of two novels by the English author Enid Blyton, and a third book published in 2000 compiled from Blyton&#x27;s short stories. The three children&#x27;s stories are as follows:
*&quot;Adventures of the Wishing-Chair&quot;, 1937 (publ. George Newnes, illustrated by Hilda McGavin)
*&quot;The Wishing-Chair Again&quot;, 1950 (publ. George Newnes, illustrated by Hilda McGavin)
*&quot;More Wishing-Chair Stories&quot;, 2000 (publ. Mammoth, illustrated by Anthony Lewis)

The first book, &quot;Adventures of the Wishing-Chair&quot;, is Enid Blyton&#x27;s first full-length novel — although it is episodic in nature. A TV series was made in 1998 as part of Enid Blytons Enchanted Lands.

==&quot;Adventures of the Wishing-Chair&quot;==
Mollie and Peter, searching for a birthday present for their mother, find a mysterious antiques shop which appears to be run by fairy folk. There, they find a magic Wishing-Chair with the power to grow wings and fly. After the chair rescues them from the shop, and gets them home, they decide to keep the chair in their playroom. On their first adventure, they rescue a pixie called Chinky (renamed to Binky in revised editions and Jigs in the TV series) from a giant. The pixie comes to live in their playroom, and the remainder of the book concerns the adventures of the children, as the chair takes them, and Chinky to various magical places.

==&quot;The Wishing-Chair Again&quot;==
It&#x27;s the first day of the summer holidays and Peter and Mollie are dying to go on more adventures with their Wishing-Chair. Peter inadvertently asks to go to the land of &quot;Goodness-Knows-Where&quot;, but in the process of going there the Wishing-Chair is stolen. They eventually get it back and a few days later, the Wishing-Chair only grows three wings. They end up in the Land of Slipperies and when Peter offends one of them, they retaliate by chopping all the chair&#x27;s wings off, so they get some ointment which grows the wings back.

On the next rainy day, they inadvertently grow wings on their toys and the toys end up at Mr Grim&#x27;s school where mischievous brownies are sent. They befriend a brownie called Winks and successfully get Mr Grim to relinquish the toys. Winks takes up residence in Peter and Mollie&#x27;s house and they take him on adventures, but on the last day of the holidays, he is sent back to Mr Grim&#x27;s school for being too naughty.

==&quot;More Wishing-Chair Stories&quot;==
In this final book, Mollie and Peter are home for the half-term holiday and Chinky (or Binky) and the Wishing-Chair are ready to fly away with them to magical lands. They visit the Land of Wishes, the Land of Scally-Wags and help Santa Claus deliver presents on Christmas Eve. 

Published in 2000, the book is a compilation of stories made up
from removed chapters of the previous books as well as material from &quot;Sunny Stories&quot; and &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s Omnibus!&quot;

==Television adaptation==
An animated series, &quot;Enid Blyton&#x27;s Enchanted Lands&quot;, based on stories from &quot;The Wishing Chair&quot; and &quot;The Faraway Tree&quot; series was broadcast in 1997 and 1998. A selection of episodes, &quot;The Ho Ho Wizard&quot;, &quot;The Grabbit Gnomes&quot;, &quot;Poor Lost Jigs&quot;, &quot;The Land of Dreams&quot;, &quot;The Disappearing Islands&quot;, &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Party&quot; and &quot;The Chair Clowns About&quot; were later released on VHS and DVD. The complete series was later released on VHS in 1999 on 2 separate tapes with 6 other episodes added which included: &quot;The Invisible Chair&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;The Snoogle&quot;, &quot;The Slipperies&quot;, &quot;The Land of Goodies&quot; and &quot;Mr Spells and the Wandering Castle&quot;. The voice cast were: Richard Pearce, Julia Harrison-Jones, Mark Channon, Nigel Pelgram, Adrienne Posta and David Holt. The series was made by the BBC and aired on CBBC on Choice.

==In popular culture==
The wishing-chair is briefly seen at the end of &quot;The Black Dossier&quot; by Alan Moore.

<doc id="931773" wikidata="Q3481619" url="?curid=931773" title="Shawn Hill">
<text>Shawn Richard Hill (born April 28, 1981) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres and Toronto Blue Jays. He was part of Team Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics, which finished fourth.

==Amateur career==
Hill played high-school baseball at Bishop Reding Catholic Secondary School in Milton, Ontario, Canada.

==Minor league career==
Hill was drafted by the San Diego Padres in the 33rd round, 1,012nd overall, of the 1999 MLB draft, but did not sign. He was drafted the next year draft by the Montreal Expos in the sixth round, 165th overall. In 82 minor league games Hill has a 32–24 record. He has a 3.16 earned run average (ERA) in five minor league seasons, not including 2010. In 14 minor league at-bats, Hill has four hits, one double, two home runs, seven runs batted in (RBIs) and four runs. Hill participated in the 2003 All-Star Futures Game, playing for the World team.

==Major league career==

===Montreal Expos / Washington Nationals===
Hill made his MLB debut on June 29, 2004 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Hill went 2 innings, giving up seven hits, four walks, and eight earned runs in a 17–7 loss. On July 4, 2004, Hill was the winning pitcher in what was the final game between two Canadian MLB teams, as the Expos defeated the Toronto Blue Jays, 6–4. Ironically, the game was played at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where 21 of Montreal&#x27;s home games were played in 2004. His final start of 2004 came on July 9, in which he pitched 1 innings, giving up seven hits and seven earned runs in an 11–0 loss against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Overall, Hill finished the season with a 1–2 record and an ERA of 16.00.

Hill missed all of 2005 with Tommy John surgery, and was on Canada&#x27;s provisional roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic, but he did not play. Hill returned to make a start for the Washington Nationals on May 27, 2006, against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched seven innings, allowing one earned run and five hits, striking out three batters and walking two.

<doc id="931785" wikidata="Q452570" url="?curid=931785" title="Scipione Borghese">
<text>Scipione Caffarelli-Borghese (; 1 September 1577 – 2 October 1633) was an Italian cardinal, art collector and patron of the arts. A member of the Borghese family, he was the patron of the painter Caravaggio and the artist Bernini. His legacy is the establishment of the art collection at the Villa Borghese in Rome.

==Biography==

===Early life and cardinalship===
He was born in Artena with name Scipione Caffarelli, the son of Francesco Caffarelli and Ortensia Borghese. Because his father ran into financial difficulties, Scipione&#x27;s education was paid for by his maternal uncle Camillo Borghese. Upon Camillo&#x27;s election to the papacy as Pope Paul V in 1605, he quickly conferred a cardinalship on Scipione and gave him the right to use the Borghese name and coat of arms.

In the classic pattern of papal nepotism, Cardinal Borghese wielded enormous power as the Pope&#x27;s secretary and effective head of the Vatican government. On his own and the Pope&#x27;s behalf he amassed an enormous fortune through papal fees and taxes, and acquired vast land holdings for the Borghese family.

===Cardinal===

Scipione received many honours from his uncle. He became superintendent general of the Papal States, legate in Avignon, archpriest of the Lateran and Vatican basilicas, prefect of the Signature of Grace, Abbot of Subiaco and San Gregorio da Sassola on the Coelian, and librarian of the Roman Catholic Church. He also assumed the offices of Grand Penitentiary, secretary of the Apostolic Briefs, Archbishop of Bologna, protector of Germany and the Habsburg Netherlands, of the Orders of Dominicans, Camaldolese and Olivetans, of the Shrine of Loreto and of the Swiss Guard, and numerous other ecclesiastical positions. In each of these offices the cardinal received stipends. His income in 1609 was about 90,000 scudi, and by 1612 it had reached 140,000 scudi. With his enormous wealth, he bought the villages of Montefortino and Olevano Romano from Pier Francesco Colonna, Duke of Zagarolo for 280,000 scudi.

As Cardinal Nephew (an official post until it was abolished in 1692), Borghese was placed in charge of both the internal and external political affairs of the Papal States. In addition, Paul V entrusted his nephew with the management of the finances of both the papacy and the Borghese family. 

Borghese aroused a great deal of controversy and resentment by utilizing numerous &quot;gifts&quot; from the papal government to fund Borghese family investments. Identifying rental properties as the most efficient means to ensure financial stability, he purchased entire towns and other extensive properties, including approximately one-third of the land south of Rome. Exploiting his authority as Cardinal Nephew, he often compelled owners to sell their holdings to him at substantial discounts. Borghese thus ensured that the fortunes of the family were not permanently dependent on ecclesiastical office.

Cardinal Scipione Borghese died in Rome in 1633 and is buried in the Borghese chapel in Santa Maria Maggiore.

=== Private life ===
Contemporaries commented on the near-public scandals that resulted on occasions from Scipione&#x27;s possible homosexuality, reflected in his taste for collecting art with strong homoerotic overtones. In 1605, Scipione allegedly angered his uncle the pope by bringing Stefano Pignatelli, to whom Scipione was closely attached, to Rome.

According to the later writer Gaetano Moroni, Scipione:
Scipione subsequently fell into a long and serious sickness, and only recovered when Pignatelli was allowed to come. The pope decided to keep a check on Pignatelli and had him ordained, the beginning of a career which led to him becoming a cardinal in 1621. Indeed, the Italian historian Lorenzo Cardella notes that Pignatelli was cleared twice by the Roman Inquisition of having &quot;improper influence&quot; on Cardinal Borghese.

However, more recently published espionage reports of Giovanni Antonio Marta speak against the results of such official investigation and substantially confirm the homosexual inclinations of Cardinal Scipione. They include a report of a nobleman whom Scipione was said to love &quot;to the point of insanity&quot;, and for whom he was determined to secure a cardinal&#x27;s hat; as well as a darker episode where a young man of eighteen was supposedly murdered in Scipione&#x27;s ante-chamber by his servants after leaving the cardinal&#x27;s bed.

==Building projects==

===Development of Gardens===

Borghese took special interest in the development of the extensive gardens undertaken by various artists at his Roman residences, the Palazzo Borghese on the Quirinal (primarily 1610–16) and the Villa Borghese (initiated in 1613 and elaborated for the rest of the Cardinal&#x27;s life). Both these influential gardens featured innovative elements such as waterfalls, and they incorporated dense groves of trees, which provided rural seclusion within the city.

===Restoration of Churches===

In the first half of his career, Scipione&#x27;s church building was associated with his commendatrial or titular duties; in the latter half his public patronage was more wide-ranging, intervening at San Crisogono, Santa Maria sopra Minerva, Santa Maria della Vittoria, Santa Chiara a Casa Pia, San Gregorio Magno, as well as building new churches in the nearby towns of Montefortino and Monte Compatri. During the Ludovisi papacy the major focus of Borghese&#x27;s ecclesiastical patronage was on commemorative projects. The first was the embellishment of the Caffarelli chapel in Santa Maria sopra Minerva (1620–23). The second was the massive timber catafalque decorated with life-size plaster figures designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini, erected in Santa Maria Maggiore (1622).

Borghese&#x27;s first work after entering the Sacred College where he studied was the building and decoration of the oratory chapels of St. Andrew and St. Sylvia beside San Gregorio Magno al Celio. For Borghese to complete such a project declared his devotion to the city&#x27;s Christian heritage, while also marking a gesture of respect for the great Church reformer of the previous generation. The restoration of San Sebastiano fuori le mura (November 1607 – 1614), a church built under Constantine (c. 312) housing the greatest collection of relics known at the time. San Sebastiano was in addition one of the Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome and its restoration was a key element in the pilgrimage-driven revival of the circuit. Borghese&#x27;s restoration was in effect a complete modernization: rebuilding the main façade, adding a rear entrance, and thoroughly overhauling the interior in a modern decorative idiom.

The most striking feature of the restoration is the incidence of Borghese&#x27;s name and symbols. Atop the portico&#x27;s parapet stand eagle and dragon (the Borghese symbols) statuettes; underneath is the façade dedication: Scipione Borghese, Grand Penitentiary, Cardinal and Priest of the Holy Roman Church, 1626. His coat of arms in the major panels of the ceiling&#x27;s long axis is mounted not as normal in excucheons, but directly in the frame, the keystone of the proscenium arch at the end of the nave; underneath an inscription at the base of the baldachin dome there is another inscription.

As Cardinal, Borghese took seriously his responsibility to contribute to the care and decoration of the churches under his supervision. Particularly after the death of his uncle, he seems to have utilized the embellishment of church buildings to demonstrate concern for the well-being of the faithful. The reconstruction of San Crisogono, Rome (1618–28) was probably the most costly project of redecoration undertaken in any church in the city during the early seventeenth century. Gold covers the ceiling and many other surfaces.

Such public undertakings helped Borghese rehabilitate his reputation, though he never regained his political influence.

==Art collector==

Borghese used the immense wealth that he acquired as Cardinal Nephew to assemble one of the largest and most impressive art collections in Europe. The Borghese Collection began around a collection of paintings by Caravaggio, Raphael, and Titian, and of ancient Roman art. Scipione also bought widely from leading painters and sculptors of his day. Even though later generations dispersed some of his acquisitions through sales and diplomatic gifts, the works that he assembled form the core of the holdings of the Galleria Borghese, a museum housed in the villa commissioned by Scipione (1613–15) from the architect Giovanni Vasanzio. Additional holdings were exhibited at the Villa Mondragone. His collection was poetically described as early as 1613 by Scipione Francucci.

The Satyr and Dolphin (Roman marble copy of lost Greek bronze, 4th century BCE) typifies the elegant and sensual depictions of young male figures that were prominently featured in Borghese&#x27;s collection. One of his most prized works was the Hermaphrodite (Roman copy after Greek original of 2nd century BCE). From the young sculptor Gian Lorenzo Bernini, Scipione commissioned in 1620 a realistically rendered mattress on which to lay this sensuous nude figure. Borghese is reported to have kept this statue in a specially made wooden cupboard, which he would open with a theatrical flourish to the amusement of his close friends. However, this sculpture was given in the early 19th century to Napoleon upon Camillo Borghese&#x27;s marriage to Pauline Bonaparte, sister of Napoleon, and is now in the Louvre. The Borghese collection today contains another 2nd-century copy that was found.

Pope Paul V willingly assisted his nephew&#x27;s efforts to obtain the art works that aroused his interest. In 1607, the Pope gave the Cardinal a collection of 107 paintings which had been confiscated from the painter Cavalier D&#x27;Arpino after the artist did not pay a tax bill. In the following year, Raphael&#x27;s Deposition was secretly removed from the Baglioni Chapel in the church of San Francesco in Perugia and transported to Rome to be given to Scipione through a papal motu proprio. The Borgheses were forced to provide Perugia with two excellent copies of the painting to avoid conflict with the angered city becoming violent, but the original remains in the Borghese collection.

===Caravaggio===

Among the pictures that Borghese acquired through the 1607 seizure from Cavaliere d&#x27;Arpino were two important early works by Caravaggio (both 1593, still in Galleria Borghese): a probable self-portrait, usually called Sick Bacchus, and Boy with a Basket of Fruit, an overtly homoerotic image of a youth extending a large basket of fruit seductively toward the viewer.

Borghese also greatly admired Caravaggio&#x27;s naturalistic and psychologically complex later religious paintings, such as the brooding Saint John the Baptist (1605/6), which the collector acquired from the artist&#x27;s estate shortly after his death, and the intense &quot;David with the Head of Goliath&quot; (1609/10), which represents the Biblical hero extending outwards a severed head with the features of the artist

Borghese appropriated Caravaggio&#x27;s &quot;Madonna and Child with St. Anne&quot;, a large altarpiece commissioned in 1605 for a chapel in the Basilica of Saint Peter&#x27;s, but rejected by the College of Cardinals because of its earthly realism and unconventional iconography. Recent archival research has established that Borghese intended from the early stages of the commission that the altarpiece would end up in his own collection.

===Patronage of Bernini===

Borghese&#x27;s early patronage of artist Gian Lorenzo Bernini assisted to establish him as the leading Italian sculptor and architect of the seventeenth century. Between 1618 and 1623, Bernini worked primarily for the Cardinal, creating innovative pieces that would become early touchstones of the Baroque style. For the decoration of the Villa Borghese, Bernini produced a life-sized figure of David (1623) and three sculptural groups with mythological themes.

The culminating work in this series that Bernini created for Borghese, &quot;Apollo and Daphne&quot; (1623–1625), represents an incident popular in Italian poetry of the early seventeenth century, and ultimately derived from the Metamorphoses by the ancient Roman poet Ovid. Bernini depicts Apollo reaching out toward the river nymph Daphne just as she is transformed into a laurel tree by her father in order to prevent her from being burned by the touch of the god of the sun. Understood within its original intellectual context, this group represents frustrated desire and enduring despair and pain, provoked by love.

These meanings may have had special resonance for Borghese, who, at the time, was widely ridiculed for his attraction to other men. The specific moment depicted by Bernini also was thought in the early seventeenth century to signify the fusion of genders, more explicitly depicted in the Hermaphrodite also in the Cardinal&#x27;s collection.

In 1632 Bernini executed two marble portrait busts of Borghese (both in Rome&#x27;s Galleria Borghese). These works capture the exuberance that the Cardinal&#x27;s friends admired and which his critics decried as frivolity inappropriate to his office.

===Collection===

Although he is most associated with the development of the Baroque, he also eagerly collected works of many artists of quite different styles.

Borghese&#x27;s collection includes works as diverse as Early Renaissance altarpieces such as Fra Angelico&#x27;s Last Judgment (ca 1450); examples of northern art such as two paintings of Venus (early 16th century) by Lucas Cranach; sixteenth-century Venetian paintings such as Titian&#x27;s &quot;Sacred and Profane Love&quot; (1514); and classicizing pictures such as Domenichino&#x27;s &quot;Diana&quot; (1616/7). The Cardinal even owned a very uncharacteristic work by Michelangelo, a depiction of Cupid now called &quot;The Manhattan Marble&quot;.

<doc id="931796" wikidata="Q1413128" url="?curid=931796" title="Indo-European studies">
<text>Indo-European studies () is a field of linguistics and an interdisciplinary field of study dealing with Indo-European languages, both current and extinct. The goal of those engaged in these studies is to amass information about the hypothetical proto-language from which all of these languages are descended, a language dubbed Proto-Indo-European (PIE), and its speakers, the Proto-Indo-Europeans, including their society and Proto-Indo-European mythology. The studies cover where the language originated and how it spread. This article also lists Indo-European scholars, centres, journals and book series.

==Naming==
The term &quot;Indo-European&quot; itself now current in English literature, was coined in 1813 by the British scholar Sir Thomas Young, although at that time, there was no consensus as to the naming of the recently discovered language family. However, he seems to have used it as a geographical term, to indicate the newly proposed language family in Eurasia spanning from the Indian subcontinent till the European continent. Among the other names suggested were:

* (M. Z. van Boxhorn, 1637)
* (C. Malte-Brun, 1810)
*&quot;Indoeuropean&quot; (Th. Young, 1813)
* (Rasmus C. Rask, 1815)
* (F. Schmitthenner, 1826)
* (Wilhelm von Humboldt, 1827)
* (Christian Lassen, 1830)
* (A. F. Pott, 1840)
* (G. I. Ascoli, 1854)
*&quot;aryan&quot; (F. M. Müller, 1861)
* (H. Chavée, 1867).

Rask&#x27;s &quot;japetisk&quot; or &quot;Japhetic languages&quot;, after the old notion of &quot;Japhetites&quot; and ultimately Japheth, son of the Biblical Noah, parallels the term Semitic, from Noah&#x27;s son Shem, and Hamitic, from Noah&#x27;s son Ham. Japhetic and Hamitic are both obsolete, apart from occasional dated use of term &quot;Hamito-Semitic&quot; for the Afro-Asiatic languages.

In English, &quot;Indo-German&quot; was used by J. C. Prichard in 1826 although he preferred &quot;Indo-European&quot;. In French, use of was established by A. Pictet (1836). In German literature, was used by Franz Bopp since 1835, while the term had already been introduced by Julius von Klapproth in 1823, intending to include the northernmost and the southernmost of the family&#x27;s branches, as it were as an abbreviation of the full listing of involved languages that had been common in earlier literature. &quot;Indo-Germanisch&quot; became established by the works of August Friedrich Pott, who understood it to include the easternmost and the westernmost branches, opening the doors to ensuing fruitless discussions whether it should not be &quot;Indo-Celtic&quot;, or even &quot;Tocharo-Celtic&quot;.

Today, &quot;Indo-European&quot;, is well established in English and French literature, while remains current in German literature, but alongside a growing number of uses of . Similarly, has now largely replaced the still occasionally encountered in Dutch scientific literature.

Indo-Hittite is sometimes used for the wider family including Anatolian by those who consider that IE and Anatolian are comparable separate branches.

==Study methods==

The comparative method was formally developed in the 19th century and applied first to Indo-European languages. The existence of the Proto-Indo-Europeans had been inferred by comparative linguistics as early as 1640, while attempts at an Indo-European proto-language reconstruction date back as far as 1713. However, by the 19th century, still no consensus had been reached about the internal groups of the IE family.

The method of internal reconstruction is used to compare patterns within one dialect, without comparison with other dialects and languages, to try to arrive at an understanding of regularities operating at an earlier stage in that dialect. It has also been used to infer information about earlier stages of PIE than can be reached by the comparative method.

The IE languages are sometimes hypothesized to be part of super-families such as Nostratic or Eurasiatic.

==History==

===Preliminary work===
The ancient Greeks were aware that their language had changed since the time of Homer (about 730BC). Aristotle (about 330BC) identified four types of linguistic change: insertion, deletion, transposition and substitution. In the 1st century BC, the Romans were aware of the similarities between Greek and Latin.

In the post-classical West, with the influence of Christianity, language studies were undermined by the attempt to derive all languages from Hebrew since the time of Saint Augustine. Prior studies classified the European languages as Japhetic. One of the first scholars to challenge the idea of a Hebrew root to the languages of Europe was Joseph Scaliger (1540 – 1609). He identified Greek, Germanic, Romance and Slavic language groups by comparing the word for &quot;God&quot; in various European languages. In 1710, Leibniz applied ideas of gradualism and uniformitarianism to linguistics in a short essay. Like Scaliger, he rejected a Hebrew root, but also rejected the idea of unrelated language groups and considered them all to have a common source.

Around the 12th century, similarities between European languages became recognised. In Iceland, scholars noted the resemblances between Icelandic and English. Gerald of Wales claimed that Welsh, Cornish, and Breton were descendants of a common source. A study of the Insular Celtic languages was carried out by George Buchanan in the 16th century and the first field study was by Edward Lhuyd around 1700. He published his work in 1707, shortly after translating a study by Paul-Yves Pezron on Breton.

Grammars of European languages other than Latin and Classical Greek began to be published at the end of the 15th century. This led to comparison between the various languages.

In the 16th century, visitors to India became aware of similarities between Indian and European languages. For example, Filippo Sassetti reported striking resemblances between Sanskrit and Italian.

===Early Indo-European studies===

In his 1647 essay, Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn proposed the existence of a primitive common language he called &quot;Scythian&quot;. He included in its descendants Dutch, German, Latin, Greek, and Persian, and his posthumously published &quot;Originum Gallicarum liber&quot; of 1654 added Slavic, Celtic and Baltic. The 1647 essay discusses, as a first, the methodological issues in assigning languages to genetic groups. For example, he observed that loanwords should be eliminated in comparative studies, and also correctly put great emphasis on common morphological systems and irregularity as indicators of relationship. A few years earlier, the Silesian physician Johann Elichmann (1601/02 – 1639) already used the expression &quot;ex eadem origine&quot; (from a common source) in a study published posthumously in 1640. He related European languages to Indo-Iranian languages (which include Sanskrit).

The idea that the first language was Hebrew continued to be advanced for some time: Pierre Besnier (1648 – 1705) in 1674 published a book which was translated into English the following year: &quot;A philosophical essay for the reunion of the languages, or, the art of knowing all by the mastery of one&quot;.

Leibniz in 1710 proposed the concept of the so-called Japhetic language group, consisting of languages now known as Indo-European, which he contrasted with the so-called Aramaic languages (now generally known as Semitic).

The concept of actually reconstructing an Indo-European proto-language was suggested by William Wotton in 1713, while showing, among others, that Icelandic (&quot;Teutonic&quot;), the Romance languages and Greek were related.

In 1741 Gottfried Hensel (1687 – 1767) published a language map of the world in his &quot;Synopsis Universae Philologiae&quot;. He still believed that all languages were derived from Hebrew.

Mikhail Lomonosov compared numbers and other linguistic features in different languages of the world including Slavic, Baltic (&quot;Kurlandic&quot;), Iranian (&quot;Medic&quot;), Finnish, Chinese, Khoekhoe (&quot;Hottentot&quot;) and others. He emphatically expressed the antiquity of the linguistic stages accessible to comparative method in the drafts for his &quot;Russian Grammar&quot; published in 1755:

Imagine the depth of time when these languages separated! ... Polish and Russian separated so long ago! Now think how long ago Kurlandic! Think when Latin, Greek, German, and Russian! Oh, great antiquity!

Gaston-Laurent Coeurdoux (1691 – 1779) sent a &quot;Mémoire&quot; to the French &quot;Académie des inscriptions et belles-lettres&quot; in 1767 in which he demonstrated the similarity between the Sanskrit, Latin, Greek, German and Russian languages.

Despite the above, the discovery of the genetic relationship of the whole family of Indo-European languages is often attributed to Sir William Jones, a British judge in India, who, in a 1786 lecture (published 1788) remarked:

The Sanskrit language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the Greek, more copious than the Latin, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists.

In his 1786 &quot;The Sanskrit Language&quot;, Jones postulated a proto-language uniting six branches: Sanskrit (i.e. Indo-Aryan), Persian (i.e. Iranian), Greek, Latin, Germanic and Celtic. In many ways his work was less accurate than his predecessors&#x27;, as he erroneously included Egyptian, Japanese and Chinese in the Indo-European languages, while omitting Hindi.

In 1814 the young Dane Rasmus Christian Rask submitted an entry to an essay contest on Icelandic history, in which he concluded that the Germanic languages were (as we would put it) in the same language family as Greek, Latin, Slavic, and Lithuanian. He was in doubt about Old Irish, eventually concluding that it did not belong with the others (he later changed his mind), and further decided that Finnish and Hungarian were related but in a different family, and that &quot;Greenlandic&quot; (Kalaallisut) represented yet a third. He was unfamiliar with Sanskrit at the time. Later, however, he learned Sanskrit, and published some of the earliest Western work on ancient Iranian languages.

August Schleicher was the first scholar to compose a tentative reconstructed text in the extinct &quot;common source&quot; that Van Boxhorn and later scholars had predicted (&quot;see:&quot; Schleicher&#x27;s fable). The reconstructed Proto-Indo-European language (PIE) represents, by definition, the common language of the Proto-Indo-Europeans. This early phase culminates in Franz Bopp&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Grammar&quot; of 1833.

===Later Indo-European studies===
The classical phase of Indo-European comparative linguistics leads from Bopp to August Schleicher&#x27;s 1861 &quot;Compendium&quot; and up to Karl Brugmann&#x27;s 5-volume &quot;Grundriss&quot; (outline of Indo-European languages) published from 1886 to 1893. Brugmann&#x27;s Neogrammarian re-evaluation of the field and Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s proposal of the concept of &quot;consonantal schwa&quot; (which later evolved into the laryngeal theory) may be considered the beginning of &quot;contemporary&quot; Indo-European studies. The Indo-European proto-language as described in the early 1900s in its main aspects is still accepted today, and the work done in the 20th century has been cleaning up and systematizing, as well as the incorporation of new language material, notably the Anatolian and Tocharian branches unknown in the 19th century, into the Indo-European framework.

Notably, the laryngeal theory, in its early forms barely noticed except as a clever analysis, became mainstream after the 1927 discovery by Jerzy Kuryłowicz of the survival of at least some of these hypothetical phonemes in Anatolian. Julius Pokorny in 1959 published his &quot;Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch&quot;, an updated and slimmed-down reworking of the three-volume &quot;Vergleichendes Wörterbuch der indogermanischen Sprachen&quot; of Alois Walde and Julius Pokorny (1927 – 1932). Both of these works aim to provide an overview of the lexical knowledge accumulated until the early 20th century, but with only stray comments on the structure of individual forms; in Pokorny 1959, then-recent trends of morphology and phonology (e.g., the laryngeal theory), go unacknowledged, and he largely ignores Anatolian and Tocharian data.

The generation of Indo-Europeanists active in the last third of the 20th century, such as Oswald Szemerényi, Calvert Watkins, Warren Cowgill, Jochem Schindler, Helmut Rix, developed a better understanding of morphology and, in the wake of Kuryłowicz&#x27;s 1956 &quot;L&#x27;apophonie en indo-européen&quot;, ablaut. Rix&#x27;s &quot;Lexikon der indogermanischen Verben&quot; appeared in 1997 as a first step towards a modernization of Pokorny&#x27;s dictionary; corresponding tomes addressing the noun, &quot;Nomina im Indogermanischen Lexikon&quot;, appeared in 2008, and pronouns and particles, &quot;Lexikon der indogermanischen Partikeln und Pronominalstämme&quot;, in 2014. Current efforts are focused on a better understanding of the relative chronology within the proto-language, aiming at distinctions of &quot;early&quot;, &quot;middle&quot; and &quot;late&quot;, or &quot;inner&quot; and &quot;outer&quot; PIE dialects, but a general consensus has yet to form. From the 1960s, knowledge of Anatolian began to be of a certainty sufficient stage to allow it to influence the image of the proto-language (see also Indo-Hittite).

Such attempts at recovering a sense of historical depth in PIE have been combined with efforts towards linking the history of the language with archaeology, notably with the Kurgan hypothesis. J. P. Mallory&#x27;s 1989 &quot;In Search of the Indo-Europeans&quot; and 1997 &quot;Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture&quot; gives an overview of this. Purely linguistic research was bolstered by attempts to reconstruct the culture and mythology of the Proto-Indo-Europeans by scholars such as Georges Dumézil, as well as by archaeology (e. g. Marija Gimbutas, Colin Renfrew) and genetics (e. g. Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza). These speculations about the &quot;realia&quot; of Proto-Indo-European culture are however not part of the field of comparative linguistics, but rather a sister-discipline.

<doc id="931802" wikidata="Q1089605" url="?curid=931802" title="Chunking (psychology)">
<text>In cognitive psychology, chunking is a process by which small individual pieces of a set of information are bound together to create a meaningful whole later on in memory. The chunks, by which the information is grouped, are meant to improve short-term retention of the material, thus bypassing the limited capacity of working memory and allowing the working memory to be more efficient. A chunk is a collection of basic units that are strongly associated with one another, and have been grouped together and stored in a person&#x27;s memory. These chunks can be retrieved easily due to their coherent grouping. It is believed that individuals create higher-order cognitive representations of the items within the chunk. The items are more easily remembered as a group than as the individual items themselves. These chunks can be highly subjective because they rely on an individual&#x27;s perceptions and past experiences, which are linked to the information set. The size of the chunks generally ranges from two to six items but often differs based on language and culture.

According to Johnson (1970), there are four main concepts associated with the memory process of chunking: chunk, memory code, decode and recode. The chunk, as mentioned prior, is a sequence of to-be-remembered information that can be composed of adjacent terms. These items or information sets are to be stored in the same memory code. The process of recoding is where one learns the code for a chunk, and decoding is when the code is translated into the information that it represents.

The phenomenon of chunking as a memory mechanism is easily observed in the way individuals group numbers, and information, in day-to-day life. For example, when recalling a number such as 12101946, if numbers are grouped as 12, 10, and 1946, a mnemonic is created for this number as a month, day, and year. It would be stored as December 10, 1946, instead of a string of numbers. Similarly, another illustration of the limited capacity of working memory as suggested by George Miller can be seen from the following example: While recalling a mobile phone number such as 9849523450, we might break this into 98 495 234 50. Thus, instead of remembering 10 separate digits that are beyond the putative &quot;seven plus-or-minus two&quot; memory span, we are remembering four groups of numbers. An entire chunk can also be remembered simply by storing the beginnings of a chunk in the working memory, resulting in the long-term memory recovering the remainder of the chunk.

==Modality effect==
A modality effect is present in chunking. That is, the mechanism used to convey the list of items to the individual affects how much &quot;chunking&quot; occurs.

Experimentally, it has been found that auditory presentation results in a larger amount of grouping in the responses of individuals than visual presentation does. Previous literature, such as George Miller&#x27;s The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on our Capacity for Processing Information (1956) has shown that the probability of recall of information is greater when the chunking strategy is used. As stated above, the grouping of the responses occurs as individuals place them into categories according to their inter-relatedness based on semantic and perceptual properties. Lindley (1966) showed that since the groups produced have meaning to the participant, this strategy makes it easier for an individual to recall and maintain information in memory during studies and testing. Therefore, when &quot;chunking&quot; is used as a strategy, one can expect a higher proportion of correct recalls.

==Memory training systems, mnemonic==
Various kinds of memory training systems and mnemonics include training and drills in specially-designed recoding or chunking schemes. Such systems existed before Miller&#x27;s paper, but there was no convenient term to describe the general strategy and no substantive and reliable research. The term &quot;chunking&quot; is now often used in reference to these systems. As an illustration, patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease typically experience working memory deficits; chunking is an effective method to improve patients&#x27; verbal working memory performance. Patients with schizophrenia also experience working memory deficits which influence executive function; memory training procedures positively influence cognitive and rehabilitative outcomes. Chunking has been proven to decrease the load on the working memory in many ways. As well as remembering chunked information easier, a person can also recall other non-chunked memories easier due to the benefits chunking has on the working memory. For instance, in one study, participants with more specialized knowledge could reconstruct sequences of chess moves because they had larger chunks of procedural knowledge, which means that the level of expertise and the sorting order of the information retrieved is essential in the influence of procedural knowledge chunks retained in short-term memory. Chunking has been shown to have an influence in linguistics, such as boundary perception. 

==Efficient Chunk sizes==
According to the research conducted by Dirlam (1972), a mathematical analysis was conducted to see what the efficient chunk size is. We are familiar with the size range that chunking holds, but Dirlam (1972) wanted to discover the most efficient chunk size. The mathematical findings have discovered that four or three items in each chunk is the most optimal.

==Channel capacity, &quot;Magic number seven&quot;, Increase of short-term memory==
The word &quot;chunking&quot; comes from a famous 1956 paper by George A. Miller, &quot;The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two: Some Limits on Our Capacity for Processing Information&quot;. At a time when information theory was beginning to be applied in psychology, Miller observed that some human cognitive tasks fit the model of a &quot;channel capacity&quot; characterized by a roughly constant capacity in bits, but short-term memory did not. A variety of studies could be summarized by saying that short-term memory had a capacity of about &quot;seven plus-or-minus two&quot; chunks. Miller (1956) wrote, &quot;With binary items, the span is about nine and, although it drops to about five with monosyllabic English words, the difference is far less than the hypothesis of constant information would require (see also, memory span). The span of immediate memory seems to be almost independent of the number of bits per chunk, at least over the range that has been examined to date.&quot; Miller acknowledged that &quot;we are not very definite about what constitutes a chunk of information.&quot;

Miller (1956) noted that according to this theory, it should be possible to increase short-term memory for low-information-content items effectively by mentally recoding them into a smaller number of high-information-content items. He imagined this process is useful in scenarios such as &quot;a man just beginning to learn radio-telegraphic code hears each dit and dah as a separate chunk. Soon he is able to organize these sounds into letters and then he can deal with the letters as chunks. Then the letters organize themselves as words, which are still larger chunks, and he begins to hear whole phrases.&quot; Thus, a telegrapher can effectively &quot;remember&quot; several dozen dits and dahs as a single phrase. Naïve subjects can remember a maximum of only nine binary items, but Miller reports a 1954 experiment in which people were trained to listen to a string of binary digits and (in one case) mentally group them into groups of five, recode each group into a name (for example, &quot;twenty-one&quot; for 10101), and remember the names. With sufficient practice, people found it possible to remember as many as forty binary digits. Miller wrote:

==Expertise and skilled memory effects==
Studies have shown that people have better memories when they are trying to remember items with which they are familiar. Similarly, people tend to create familiar chunks. This familiarity allows one to remember more individual pieces of content, and also more chunks as a whole. One well-known chunking study was conducted by Chase and Ericsson, who worked with an undergraduate student, SF, for over two years. They wanted to see if a person&#x27;s digit span memory could be improved with practice. SF began the experiment with a normal span of 7 digits. SF was a long-distance runner, and chunking strings of digits into race times increased his digit span. By the end of the experiment, his digit span had grown to 80 numbers. A later description of the research in &quot;The Brain-Targeted Teaching Model for 21st Century Schools&quot; states that SF later expanded his strategy by incorporating ages and years, but his chunks were always familiar, which allowed him to recall them more easily. Someone who does not have knowledge in the expert domain (e.g. being familiar with mile/marathon times) would have difficulty chunking with race times and ultimately be unable to memorize as many numbers using this method. The idea that a person who does not have knowledge in the expert domain would have difficulty chunking could also be seen in an experiment of novice and expert hikers to see if they could remember different mountain scenes. From this study, it was found that the expert hikers had better recall and recognition of structured stimuli. Another example could be seen with expert musicians in being able to chunk and recall encoded material that best meets the demands they are presented with at any given moment during the performance.

Chunking and memory in chess revisited

Previous research has shown that chunking is an effective tool for enhancing memory capacity due to the nature of grouping individual pieces into larger, more meaningful groups that are easier to remember. Chunking is a popular tool for people who play chess, specifically a master. Chase and Simon (1973a) discovered that the skill levels of chess players are attributed to long-term memory storage and the ability to copy and recollect thousands of chunks. The process helps acquire knowledge at a faster pace. Since it is an excellent tool for enhancing memory, a chess player who utilizes chunking has a higher chance of success. According to Chase and Simon, while re-examining (1973b), an expert chess master is able to access information in long-term memory storage quickly due to the ability to recall chunks. Chunks stored in long-term memory are related to the decision of the movement of board pieces due to obvious patterns.

Chunking models for education

Many years of research has concluded that chunking is a reliable process for gaining knowledge and organization of information. Chunking provides explanation to the behavior of experts, such as a teacher. A teacher can utilize chunking in their classroom as a way to teach the curriculum. Gobet (2005) proposed that teachers can use chunking as a method to segment the curriculum into natural components. A student learns better when focusing on key features of material, so it is important to create the segments to highlight the important information. By understanding the process of how an expert is formed, it is possible to find general mechanisms for learning that can be implemented into classrooms.

==Chunking in motor learning==
Chunking is a method of learning that can be applied in a number of contexts and is not limited to learning verbal material. Karl Lashley, in his classic paper on serial order, argued that the sequential responses that appear to be organized in a linear and flat fashion concealed an underlying hierarchical structure. This was then demonstrated in motor control by Rosenbaum et al. in 1983. Thus sequences can consist of sub-sequences and these can, in turn, consist of sub-sub-sequences. Hierarchical representations of sequences have an advantage over linear representations: They combine efficient local action at low hierarchical levels while maintaining the guidance of an overall structure. While the representation of a linear sequence is simple from a storage point of view, there can be potential problems during retrieval. For instance, if there is a break in the sequence chain, subsequent elements will become inaccessible. On the other hand, a hierarchical representation would have multiple levels of representation. A break in the link between lower-level nodes does not render any part of the sequence inaccessible, since the control nodes (chunk nodes) at the higher level would still be able to facilitate access to the lower-level nodes. 
Chunks in motor learning are identified by pauses between successive actions in Terrace (2001). It is also suggested that during the sequence performance stage (after learning), participants download list items as chunks during pauses. He also argued for an operational definition of chunks suggesting a distinction between the notions of input and output chunks from the ideas of short-term and long-term memory. Input chunks reflect the limitation of working memory during the encoding of new information (how new information is stored in long-term memory), and how it is retrieved during subsequent recall. Output chunks reflect the organization of over-learned motor programs that are generated on-line in working memory. Sakai et al. (2003) showed that participants spontaneously organize a sequence into a number of chunks across a few sets and that these chunks were distinct among participants tested on the same sequence. They also demonstrated that the performance of a shuffled sequence was poorer when the chunk patterns were disrupted than when the chunk patterns were preserved. Chunking patterns also seem to depend on the effectors used.

Perlman found in his series of experiments that tasks that are larger in size and broken down into smaller sections had faster respondents than the task as a large whole. The study suggests that chunking a larger task into a smaller more manageable task can produce a better outcome. The research also found that completing the task in a coherent order rather than swapping from one task to another can also produce a better outcome.

== Chunking in infants ==
Chunking is used in adults in different ways which can include low-level perceptual features, category membership, semantic relatedness, and statistical co-occurrences between items. Although due to recent studies we are starting to realize that infants also use chunking. They also use different types of knowledges to help them with chunking like conceptual knowledge, spatiotemporal cue knowledge, and knowledge of their social domain.

There have been studies that use different chunking models like PARSER and the Bayesian model. PARSER is a chunking model designed to account for human behavior by implementing psychologically plausible processes of attention, memory, and associative learning. In a recent study, it was determined that these chunking models like PARSER are seen in infants more than chunking models like Bayesian. PARSER is seen more because it is typically endowed with the ability to process up to three chunks simultaneously.

When it comes to infants using their social knowledge they need to use abstract knowledge and subtle cues because they can not create a perception of their social group on their own. Infants can form chunks using shared features or spatial proximity between objects.

=== Chunking in seven-month-old infants ===
Previous research shows that the mechanism of chunking is available in seven-month-old infants. This means that chunking can occur even before the working memory capacity has completely developed. Knowing that the working memory has a very limited capacity, it can be beneficial to utilize chunking. In infants, whose working memory capacity is not completely developed, it can be even more helpful to chunk memories. These studies were done using the violation-of-expectation method and recording the amount of time the infants watched the objects in front of them. Although the experiment showed that infants can use chunking, researchers also concluded that an infant&#x27;s ability to chunk memories will continue to develop over the next year of their lives.

=== Chunking in 14-month-old infants ===
Working memory appears to store no more than three objects at a time in newborns and early toddlers. A study conducted in 2014, &quot;Infants use temporal regularities to chunk objects in memory&quot;, allowed for new information and knowledge. This research showed that 14-month-old infants, like adults, can chunk using their knowledge of object categories: they remembered four total objects when an array contained two tokens of two different types (e.g., two cats and two cars), but not when the array contained four tokens of the same type (e.g., four different cats). It demonstrates that newborns may employ spatial closeness to tie representations of particular items into chunks, benefiting memory performance as a result. Despite the fact that newborns&#x27; working memory capacity is restricted, they may employ numerous forms of information to tie representations of individual things into chunks, enhancing memory efficiency.

==Chunking as the learning of long-term memory structures==
This usage derives from Miller&#x27;s (1956) idea of chunking as grouping, but the emphasis is now on long-term memory rather than only on short-term memory. A chunk can then be defined as &quot;a collection of elements having strong associations with one another, but weak associations with elements within other chunks&quot;. The emphasis of chunking on long-term memory is supported by the idea that chunking only exists in long-term memory, but it assists with reintegration, which is involved in the recall of information in short-term memory. It may be easier to recall information in short-term memory if the information has been represented through chunking in long-term memory. Norris and Kalm (2021) argued that &quot;reintegration can be achieved by treating recall from memory as a process of Bayesian inference whereby representations of chunks in LTM (long-term memory) provide the priors that can be used to interpret a degraded representation in STM (short-term memory)&quot;. In Bayesian inference, priors refer to the initial beliefs regarding the relative frequency of an event occurring instead of other plausible events occurring. When one who holds the initial beliefs receives more information, one will determine the likelihood of each of the plausible events that could happen and thus predict the specific event that will occur. Chunks in long-term memory are involved in forming the priors, and they assist with determining the likelihood and prediction of the recall of information in short-term memory. For example, if an acronym and its full meaning already exist in long-term memory, the recall of information regarding that acronym will be easier in short-term memory.

Chase and Simon in 1973 and later Gobet, Retschitzki, and de Voogt in 2004 showed that chunking could explain several phenomena linked to expertise in chess. Following a brief exposure to pieces on a chessboard, skilled chess players were able to encode and recall much larger chunks than novice chess players. However, this effect is mediated by specific knowledge of the rules of chess; when pieces were distributed randomly (including scenarios that were not common or allowed in real games), the difference in chunk size between skilled and novice chess players was significantly reduced. Several successful computational models of learning and expertise have been developed using this idea, such as EPAM (Elementary Perceiver and Memorizer) and CHREST (Chunk Hierarchy and Retrieval Structures). Chunking may be demonstrated in the acquisition of a memory skill, which was demonstrated by S. F., an undergraduate student with average memory and intelligence, who increased his digit span from seven to almost 80 within 20 months or after at least 230 hours. S. F. was able to improve his digit span partly through mnemonic associations, which is a form of chunking. S. F. associated digits, which were unfamiliar information to him, with running times, ages, and dates, which were familiar information to him. Ericsson et al. (1980) initially hypothesized that S. F. increased digit span was due to an increase in his short-term memory capacity. However, they rejected this hypothesis when they found that his short-memory capacity was always the same, considering that he &quot;chunked&quot; only three to four digits at once. Furthermore, he never rehearsed more than six digits at once nor rehearsed more than four groups in a supergroup. Lastly, if his short-term memory capacity increased, then he would have shown a greater capacity for the alphabets; he did not. Based on these contradictions, Ericsson et al. (1980) later concluded that S. F. was able to increase his digit span due to &quot;the use of mnemonic associations in long-term memory,&quot; which further supports that chunking may exist in short-term memory rather than long-term memory.

Chunking has also been used with models of language acquisition. The use of chunk-based learning in language has been shown to be helpful. Understanding a group of basic words and then giving different categories of associated words to build on comprehension has shown to be an effective way to teach reading and language to children. Research studies have found that adults and infants were able to parse the words of a made-up language when they were exposed to a continuous auditory sequence of words arranged in random order. One of the explanations was that they may parse the words using small chunks that correspond to the made-up language. Subsequent studies have supported that when learning involves statistical probabilities (e.g., transitional probabilities in language), it may be better explained via chunking models. Franco and Destrebecqz (2012) further studied chunking in language acquisition and found that the presentation of a temporal cue was associated with a reliable prediction of the chunking model regarding learning, but the absence of the cue was associated with increased sensitivity to the strength of transitional probabilities. Their findings suggest that the chunking model can only explain certain aspects of learning, specifically language acquisition.  

== Chunking learning style and short-term memory ==
Norris conducted a study in 2020 of chunking and short-term memory recollection, finding that when a chunk is given, it is stored as a single item despite being a relatively large amount of information. This finding suggests that chunks should be less susceptible to decay or interference when they are recalled. The study used visual stimuli where all the items were given simultaneously. Items of two and three were found to be recalled easier than singles, and more singles were recalled when in a group with threes.

Chunking can be a form of data suppression that allows for more information to be stored in short-term memory. Rather than verbal short-memory measured by the number of items stored, Miller (1956) suggested that verbal short-term memory are stored as chunks. Later studies were done to determine if chunking was a form data compression when there is limited space for memory. Chunking works as data compression when it comes to redundant information and it allows for more information to be stored in short-term memory. However, memory capacity may vary.

== Chunking and working memory ==
An experiment was done to see how chunking could be beneficial to patients who had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This study was based on how chunking was used to improve working memory in normal young people. Working memory is impaired in the early stages of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease which affects the ability to do everyday tasks. It also affects executive control of working memory. It was found that participants who had mild Alzheimer&#x27;s disease were able to use working memory strategies to enhance verbal and spatial working memory performance.

It has been long thought that chunking can improve working memory. A study was done to see how chunking can improve working memory when it came to symbolic sequences and gating mechanisms. This was done by having 25 participants learn 16 sequences through trial and error. The target was presented alongside a distractor and participants were to identify the target by using right or left buttons on a computer mouse. The final analysis was done on only 19 participants. The results showed that chunking does improve symbolic sequence performance through decreasing cognitive load and real-time strategy. Chunking has proved to be effective in reducing the load on adding items into working memory. Chunking allows more items to be encoded into working memory with more available to transfer into long-term memory.

==Chunking and Two-Factor Theory==
Chekaf, Cowan, and Mathy (2016) looked at how immediate memory relates to the formation of chunks. In the immediate memory, they came up with a two-factor theory of the formation of chunks. These factors are compressibility and the order of the information. Compressibility refers to making information more compact and condensed. The material is transformed from something complex to something more simplified. Thus, compressibility relates to chunking due to the predictability factor. As for the second factor, the sequence of the information can impact what is being discovered. So the order, along with the process of compressing the material, may increase the probability that chunking occurs. These two factors interact with one another and matter in the concept of chunking. Chekaf, Cowan, and Mathy (2016) gave an example where the material &quot;1,2,3,4” can be compressed to &quot;numbers one through four.&quot; However, if the material was presented as &quot;1,3,2,4” you cannot compress it because the order in which it is presented is different. Therefore, compressibility and order play an important role in chunking.

<text>The Military Pentathlon is a multisport. It resembles the modern pentathlon but updated to skills used by the modern military.

== History of the military pentathlon ==
The modern pentathlon was originally designed to include the ideal skills of a soldier of the time. By the Second World War, some of those skills (fencing and horse riding) were irrelevant to the modern soldier.

In 1946 a French officer, Captain Henri Debrus (later promoted Colonel and President of the Conseil International du Sport Militaire (CISM)) conceived the idea of organising a sports competition reserved exclusively for the army. It was during discussions held at Frankfurt am Main which led to the setting up of the Allied Forces Sports Council, that his attention was drawn to an original military physical training technique used, at that time, by the Netherlands airborne units. After being dropped over a given zone, parachutists had to travel a distance of twenty kilometres from the dropping point, crossing over a number of obstacles and performing combat operations (small arms fire and grenade throwing).

Captain Debrus took the Dutch method as a guide, eliminated the parachute jump and modified the other tests in order to form a system, which he thought, would constitute an ideal way of ground training. A first trial competition organised by himself was held at the Military Physical Training Centre, at Freiburg, in the French occupation zone in Germany, in August 1947. Only Belgian, Dutch, and French teams took part in the competition.

Since 1950, annual world championships have been held. The sport has grown in popularity, and now over 30 countries participate. The sport&#x27;s governing body, the International Military Sports Council (CISM), now also organise pentathlons aimed at naval and air force personnel as naval pentathlon and aeronautical pentathlon respectively.

== Events of the military pentathlon ==
*Shooting: At a distance of 200 metres, competitors are tested separately for precision (10 shots in 10 minutes) and rapid-fire (10 shots in one minute) shooting. 
*Obstacle running: Competitors navigate a 500-metre obstacle course with 20 obstacles.
*Obstacle swimming: Competitors must swim a distance of 50 metres, including four obstacles.
*Throwing: Competitors are tested separately for precision and distance throwing. In the precision test, competitors throw 16 projectiles (inactive grenades) at targets on the ground at varying distances.
*Cross country running: Competitors undertake an 8 km cross country run.

===Shooting===
The shooting discipline consists of sighting shots and competition shooting.

The shooting competition consists of:
* Precision fire: 10 rounds in 10 minutes. If electronic scoring systems are not used, the time available is 12 minutes. After the announcement of &quot;15 seconds remain&quot; the signals &quot;start&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; are given by short whistle blasts. The precision fire is started at the same time for all shooters participating in the same heat.
* Rapid fire: 10 rounds in one minute. The competitors do not get information on the result of their individual shots during the rapid fire series. Therefore, the monitors are turned away or off. The rapid fire is started in two rounds (every second shooter, first the uneven numbers followed by the even numbers) in the same heat. Competitors in the non-shooting round must remain absolutely still.
* Distance is 200m, 300m or 50m.
* Weapons and ammunition: 300m Standard Rifle. All types of ammunition can be used that may be fired without danger to competitors and range personnel. Tracer, armour-piercing and incendiary ammunition are prohibited. Weapons and ammunition must be provided by the team.
* Target: Electronic targets or paper targets may be used. The 300-metre rifle target (according to ISSF General Technical Rules par. 6.3.2.1) will be used. Separate targets will be used for precision and rapid fire.

===Obstacle run===
The length of the course is 500 metres and consists of 20 standardised obstacles.

The contest is to be held on one or several lanes, provided that all lanes are identical. Each competitor must follow his own lane.

Obstacles: the obstacles are constructed and placed on the track. Obstacles of men&#x27;s event consist of:
# Rope ladder (6m high)
# Double beam (.95m high, 1.35m high, .65m apart, competitors have to touch the ground between the beams)
# Trip wire (5 elasticated &#x27;wires&#x27; .55m high, 2m apart)
# Network of wire (wires .45 to .5m high for 20m, to crawl under)
# Ford (5 stepping stones over 8m)
# Espalier (3 bar &#x27;fence&#x27;, 2.2m high, to climb over)
# Balance beam (1m high, 10.4m long)
# Sloping wall with rope (3m high)
# Horizontal beams (over 1.2m, under 0.6m, over 1.2m, under 0.6m, 1.6m apart)
# Irish table (2m high)
# Tunnel and twin beams (.5m wide, .5m high, 1.1m long tunnel, 
# Four steps of beams (.75m high, 1.25m high, 1.8m high, 2.3m high and 1.45 m apart) 
# Banquette and pit (1.8m ramp.5m ditch)
# Assault wall (1m high)
# Pit (2m deep)
# Vertical ladder (4m high)
# Assault wall II (1.9m high)
# Zigzag balance beam (15m long, .15m wide, .5m high)
# Chicane (8m long with two 180 degree turns, covering 24m in total)
# Three assault walls in succession (1m high, 1.2m high, 1m high, 6m apart)

In the women&#x27;s event, the rope ladder, sloping wall with rope, four steps of beams and vertical ladder are not negotiated.

===Obstacle swimming===
50 metres with four obstacles.

===Throwing===
The weight of projectiles is 575 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for men and 375 grams (weight tolerance +/- 25 grams) for women.

Throwing consists of precision throwing at distances of 20, 25, 30 and 35 metres (five metres shorter for each target for females). The targets consist of an inner circle with radius of one metre, and an outer circle with radius of two metres. The time allotted for precision throwing is three minutes, 16 projectiles with four inactive grenades on each target.

Distance throwing is also included, where competitors throw three grenades in two minutes. Only the longest throw will count toward the score, which combines points for both distance and precision.

===Cross-country running===
The cross-country running is the last event and for men the distance is 8000m and for women the distance is 4000m.

The combined authority covers five council areas: Darlington, Hartlepool, Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland and Stockton-on-Tees: this includes areas in both County Durham and North Yorkshire counties.

The town of Middlesbrough is the largest population centre in the area. The borough of Middlesbrough is the smallest of the five, at only and a population of : the Stockton-on-Tees borough (including multiple towns) is the largest with an area of and a population of , as of .

From 1968 until 1974, parts of the area were included in the County Borough of Teesside council area. This was replaced by Cleveland county; it had four borough councils which became unitary authorities after the county was abolished in 1996. Darlington became a unitary authority in 1997; the five authorities formed a Local Enterprise Partnership in 2011, further collaboration between the five authorities lead to Tees Valley Combined Authority being created in 2016.

==Background==
The River Tees&#x27; geographical valley is traditionally known as Teesdale. For centuries, north Tees was under the Prince-bishopric of Durham. Both Darlington and Stockton had ancient wards. Middleton St George, Hartlepool and Billingham were in Stockton ward, the latter two were also in a district called Hartness. South Tees was under a wapentake called Langbaurgh, which had been the Easton part of the ancient region of Cleveland, in Yorkshire&#x27;s North Riding.

Urban districts (such as Eston, Billingham and Saltburn and Marske by the Sea) and parts of rural districts, as well as municipal boroughs (such as Stockton-on-Tees, Thornaby-on-Tees and Redcar) and county boroughs (Middlesbrough) were merged into the County Borough of Teesside in 1968. However in 1974, the county borough was disbanded.

The 1974 reforms created the county of Cleveland, including Hartlepool, the former Urban Districts of Guisborough, Saltburn and Marske, Skelton and Brotton and Loftus. Four boroughs were also created. Hartlepool, Stockton which had formerly been part of County Durham were created along with Middlesbrough and a new District Council of Langbaurgh (this took its name from the ancient Danelaw Wapentake of Langbaurgh of which if had formed the northern part.) These had formerly being parts of the North Riding of Yorkshire.

Local government reorganisation in 1996 saw the county of Cleveland broken up: the boroughs became unitary authorities. The boroughs were placed into the counties of North Yorkshire and County Durham for ceremonial purposes. In 1997, the Borough of Darlington also became a unitary authority.

==Governance==
===UK Parliament===
Tees Valley is divided into seven and a part UK parliamentary borough constituencies:
*Darlington
*Hartlepool
*Middlesbrough
*Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland

*Sedgefield (shared with the North East Combined Authority)
*Stockton North
*Stockton South
Each constituency is made up of wards. Four constituencies were held by the Conservative Party after the 2019 general election, up by three since the 2017 general election. This was expanded to five after the 2021 Hartlepool by-election. Labour hold the other two. Sedgefield&#x27;s partial seat is also represented by a Conservative MP, as of the 2019 election. The two Middlesbrough seats have the largest majorities for either party. The Middlesbrough constituency has a sizeable Labour majority, whereas the Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland constituency has a strong Conservative majority.

===Enterprise zone===
The Tees Valley Enterprise Zone is an enterprise zone which encourages industrial development. It was initiated by the local enterprise partnership Tees Valley Unlimited and its creation was announced by the government in 2011. At its launch, the zone contained 12 sites. Four of these sites offer enhanced capital allowances, aimed at large manufacturers. These sites are Wilton International and South Bank Wharf, both in Redcar and Cleveland, Port Estates in Hartlepool and New Energy and Technology Park in Billingham, Stockton-on-Tees. The remaining sites offer reduced business rates. In March 2015 the government announced that a thirteenth site is to be added, South Bank Wharf Prairie, aimed at oil and gas decommissioning business.

===Businesses===

Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) operated here until the late 1990s on three chemical sites at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands. ICI was broken up, and its many chemical manufacturing units are now operated by a large number of companies that have acquired its assets. The Centre for Process Innovation (CPI), a national innovation catapult, is based at the Wilton Centre, the former corporate headquarters of ICI, which has become a multi-company research and development centre: along with CPI there are now some 60 other companies, including the cluster body NEPIC, using these R&amp;D and business development facilities. This centre is now one of Europe&#x27;s largest R&amp;D facilities focusing on developments in the chemistry-based process industries. The area is a chemicals processing area, but recently it has diversified to become the UK&#x27;s leading site for renewable biofuel research. This industrial activity is taking place in a collaborative environment facilitated by the economic cluster body, the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC).

Hartlepool has a nuclear power station, and there is a conventional CHP power station and a biomass power station operated by Sembcorp on the Wilton chemical site.Hereema Fabrication Group make North Sea platforms at the A1048/A179 roundabout in Hartlepool.

Wilton Engineering&#x27;s 50 acre fabrication and maintenance site is in Port Clarence. Barker and Stonehouse make furniture north of Middlesbrough next to the A66/A178 junction. The Teesside Steelworks near Redcar was the biggest blast furnace in Europe and was operated in its final years by Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI). Tata Steel Europe operate a pipe works at Hartlepool, whilst British Steel operate a heavy beam mill near Middlesbrough and a special sections mill at Skinningrove Steelworks. Able UK operate the biggest dry dock in the UK near Seaton Carew, Hartlepool where ships can be dismantled and oil rigs can be dismantled or refurbished.

The many chemistry-based businesses on Teesside include Huntsman Tioxide plant at Greatham makes titanium dioxide. Huntsman&#x27;s European headquarters are in Wynyard. Johnson Matthey Catalysts and Fujifilm Dyosynth Biologics have manufacturing units in Billingham while the Lucite International Acrylics factory and the Mitsubishi battery chemical plant are on the other side of the town. Exwold Technology operate their two extrusion and packaging facilities in Hartlepool. Banner Chemicals are adjacent to the A66 in Middlesbrough. Aldous Huxley&#x27;s visit to the former ICI plant in Billingham inspired &quot;Brave New World&quot; and this unit now makes fertiliser for Growhow, using 1% of the UK&#x27;s natural gas. SABIC petrochemicals and polymers, Lotte Chemicals PET and PTA plants, Biffa recycled polymers, Huntsman polyurethanes and the Ensus Biofuels all operate at Wilton. ConocoPhillips refinery, BP Cats, Harvest Energy Biodiesel unit, Greenery Fuels, Fine Organics, Vertelus speciality chemicals and Ineos Nitriles are all based at Seal Sands, with Vopak and Simon Storage tank storage businesses nearby. Sita are upgrading their unit at Haverton Hill. Marlow Foods produce Quorn, and KP Snacks make McCoy&#x27;s in Billingham. Santander UK&#x27;s mortgages division is located in Thornaby. Tetley Tea have had their only tea bag factory in the UK at Eaglescliffe, in the borough of Stockton-on-Tees, since 1969. It is the largest tea bag factory in the world and makes 18 billion tea bags a year. Its distribution centre is at nearby Newton Aycliffe in County Durham.

===Teesport===

Teesport is on the River Tees and is currently the third largest port in the United Kingdom, and amongst the ten biggest in Western Europe, in terms of tonnage shipped. Its size is due to the local steel and chemical industries.

This port handles over 56 million tonnes of goods per annum which are mainly associated with the local petrochemical, chemical and steel processing industries.

The port is an important piece of logistical infrastructure for the NEPIC cluster of process companies. PD Ports, who own Teesport, is headquartered in Middlesbrough adjacent to Middlesbrough railway station.

<text>The greater kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) is a large woodland antelope, found throughout eastern and southern Africa. Despite occupying such widespread territory, they are sparsely populated in most areas due to declining habitat, deforestation, and poaching. The greater kudu is one of two species commonly known as kudu, the other being the lesser kudu, &quot;T. imberbis&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Kudu ( ), or koodoo, is the Khoikhoi name for this antelope. &quot;Trag-&quot; (Greek) denotes a goat and &quot;elaphos&quot; (Greek) a deer. &quot;Strepho&quot; (Greek) means &#x27;twist&#x27;, and &quot;strepsis&quot; is &#x27;twisting&#x27;. &quot;Keras&quot; (Greek) refers to the horn of the animal.

==Physical characteristics==

Greater kudus have a narrow body with long legs, and their coats can range from brown/bluish grey to reddish brown. They possess between 4 and 12 vertical white stripes along their torso. The head tends to be darker in colour than the rest of the body, and exhibits a small white chevron which runs between the eyes.
Greater kudu bulls tend to be much larger than the cows, and vocalize much more, utilizing low grunts, clucks, humming, and gasping. The bulls also have beards running along their throats, and large horns with two and a half twists, which, were they to be straightened, would reach an average length of , with the record being . They diverge slightly as they slant back from the head. The horns do not begin to grow until the bull is between the ages of 6–12 months. The horns form the first spiral rotation at around 2 years of age, and not reaching the full two and a half rotations until they are 6 years old; occasionally they may even have 3 full turns.

The greater kudu is one of the largest species of antelope, being slightly smaller than the bongo. Bulls weigh , with a maximum of , and stand up to tall at the shoulder. The ears of the greater kudu are large and round. Cows weigh and stand as little as tall at the shoulder; they are hornless, without a beard or nose markings. The head-and-body length is , to which the tail may add a further .
==Taxonomy and subspecies==

Formerly four subspecies have been described, but recently only one to three subspecies have been accepted based on colour, number of stripes and horn length:
* &quot;T. s. strepsiceros&quot; – southern parts of the range from southern Kenya to Namibia, Botswana, and South Africa
* &quot;T. s. chora&quot; – northeastern Africa from northern Kenya through Ethiopia to eastern Sudan, Somalia, and Eritrea
* &quot;T. s. cottoni&quot; – Chad and western Sudan
This classification was supported by the genetic difference of one specimen of northern Kenya (&quot;T. s. chora&quot;) in comparison with several samples from the southern part of the range between Tanzania and Zimbabwe (&quot;T. s. strepsiceros&quot;). No specimen of the northwestern population, which may represent a third subspecies (&quot;T. s. cottoni&quot;), was tested within this study.

In Groves and Grubb&#x27;s book &quot;Ungulate Taxonomy&quot;, a recent taxonomic revision was made that evaluated all species and subspecies of kudu and other ungulates. This review split the genus &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; into 4 separate genera, &quot;Tragelaphus&quot; (bushbuck, sitatunga, bongo, nyala, and gedemsa or mountain nyala), &quot;Ammelaphus&quot; (lesser kudu), &quot;Strepsiceros&quot; (greater kudu), and their close relatives &quot;Taurotragus&quot; (elands). The greater kudu was split into four species based on genetic evidence and morphological features (horn structure and coat color). Each species was based on a different subspecies, &quot;Strepsiceros strepsiceros&quot; (Cape kudu), &quot;Strepsiceros chora&quot; (northern kudu), &quot;Strepsiceros cottoni&quot; (western kudu), and &quot;Strepsiceros zambesiensis&quot; (Zambezi kudu) which is not commonly accepted even as a subspecies. The Cape kudu is found in south central South Africa, the Zambezi kudu (closely related to the Cape kudu) is found from northern to southern Tanzania and northern South Africa, Namibia, and Angola through Zambia, Mozambique, and eastern DR Congo, the northern kudu is found in eastern Sudan southwards through Ethiopia and Kenya to the Tanzanian border, and the western kudu is found in southeastern Chad, western Sudan, and in northern Central African Republic. Although this alternative taxonomy is not commonly accepted, it was accepted in the &quot;Handbook of the Mammals of the World&quot;.

==Range and ecology==

The range of the greater kudu extends from the east in Ethiopia, Tanzania, Eritrea and Kenya into the south where they are found in Zambia, Angola, Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Other regions where greater kudu are located are Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Eswatini, Malawi, Mozambique, Somalia, and Uganda. They have also been introduced in small numbers into New Mexico, but were never released into the wild. Their habitat includes mixed scrub woodlands (the greater kudu is one of the few largest mammals that prefer living in settled areas – in scrub woodland and bush on abandoned fields and degraded pastures, mopane bush and acacia in lowlands, hills and mountains. They will occasionally venture onto plains only if there is a large abundance of bushes, but normally avoid such open areas to avoid becoming an easy target for their predators. Their diet consists of leaves, grass, shoots and occasionally tubers, roots and fruit (they are especially fond of oranges and tangerines).
During the day, greater kudus normally cease to be active and instead seek cover under woodland, especially during hot days. They feed and drink in the early morning and late afternoon, acquiring water from waterholes or roots and bulbs that have a high water content. Although they tend to stay in one area, the greater kudu may search over a large distance for water in times of drought, in southern Namibia where water is relatively scarce they have been known to cover extensive distances in very short periods of time.

== Predation ==

Predators of the greater kudu generally consist of lions, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs. Although cheetahs and leopards also prey on greater kudus, they usually target cows and calves rather than fully grown bulls. There are several instances reported where Nile crocodiles have preyed on greater kudus, although based on records, the larger mammalian carnivores statistically are much more dangerous to the kudu and comparable large ungulates, or at least those with a preference for dry, upland habitats over riparian or swamp areas. When a herd is threatened by predators, an adult (usually a female) will issue a bark to alert the rest of the herd. Despite being very nimble over rocky hillsides and mountains, the greater kudu is not fast enough (nor does it have enough endurance) to escape its main predators over open terrain, so it tends to rely on leaping over shrubs and small trees to shake off pursuers. Greater kudus have excellent hearing and acute eyesight, which helps to alert them to approaching predators. Their colouring and markings protect kudus by camouflaging them. If alarmed, they usually stand still, making them very difficult to spot.

==Behavior and social organization==
Greater kudus have a lifespan of 7 to 8 years in the wild, and up to 23 years in captivity. They may be active throughout the 24-hour day. Herds disperse during the rainy season when food is plentiful. During the dry season, there are only a few concentrated areas of food so the herds will congregate. Greater kudu are not territorial; they have home areas instead. Maternal herds have home ranges of approximately 4 square kilometers and these home ranges can overlap with other maternal herds. Home ranges of adult males are about 11 square kilometers and generally encompass the ranges of two or three female groups. Females usually form small groups of 6–10 with their offspring, but sometimes they can form a herd up to 20 individuals. Male kudus may form small bachelor groups, but they are more commonly found as solitary and widely dispersed individuals. Solitary males will join the group of females and calves (usually 6–10 individuals per group) only during the mating season (April–May in South Africa).

The male kudus are not always physically aggressive with each other, but sparring can sometimes occur between males, especially when both are of similar size and stature. The male kudus exhibit this sparring behavior by interlocking horns and shoving one another. Dominance is established until one male exhibits the lateral display. In rare circumstances, sparring can result in both males being unable to free themselves from the other&#x27;s horns, which can then result in the death of both animals.

Rarely will a herd reach a size of forty individuals, partly because of the selective nature of their diet which would make foraging for food difficult in large groups. A herd&#x27;s area can encompass , and spend an average of 54% of the day foraging for food.

== Reproduction ==

Greater kudus reach sexual maturity between ages 1 to 3. The mating season occurs at the end of the rainy season, which can fluctuate slightly according to the region and climate. Before mating, there is a courtship ritual which consists of the male standing in front of the female and often engaging in a neck wrestle. The male then trails the female while issuing a low pitched call until the female allows him to copulate with her. Gestation takes around 240 days (or eight months). Calving generally starts between February and March (late austral summer), when the grass tends to be at its highest.

Greater kudus tend to bear one , although occasionally there may be two. The pregnant female kudu will leave her group to give birth; once she gives birth, the newborn is hidden in vegetation for about 4 to 5 weeks (to avoid predation). After 4 or 5 weeks, the offspring will accompany its mother for short periods of time; then by 3 to 4 months of age, it will accompany her at all times. By the time it is 6 months old, it is quite independent of its mother. The majority of births occur during the wet season (January to March). In terms of maturity, female greater kudus reach sexual maturity at 15–21 months. Males reach maturity at 21–24 months.
== Human interaction ==

Greater kudus have both benefited and suffered from interaction with humans. Humans are turning much of the kudu&#x27;s natural habitat into farmland, restricting their home ranges. Humans have also destroyed woodland cover, which they use for their habitat. However, wells and irrigation set up by humans has also allowed the greater kudu to occupy territory that would have been too devoid of water for them previously. The greater kudu are also a target for poachers for meat and horns. The horns of greater kudus are commonly used to make Shofars, a Jewish ritual horn blown at Rosh Hashanah. The animal appears on the Eritrean 50-cent coin.

== Status ==

The greater kudu population in the northern part of its range has declined due to excessive hunting and rapid habitat loss. However, they are evaluated as low risk in the IUCN Red List of endangered species. The long-term survival of the greater kudu at large is not in jeopardy as populations located elsewhere remain robust and well-managed.
The greater kudu receives adequate protection from southern Tanzania to South Africa. There are large populations in parks and reserves such as Ruaha-Rungwa-Kisigo and Selous (Tanzania), Luangwa Valley and Kafue (Zambia), Etosha (Namibia), Moremi, Chobe and Central Kalahari (Botswana), Hwange, Chizarira, Mana Pools and Gonarezhou (Zimbabwe) and in Kruger (11,200–17,300) and Hluhluwe–iMfolozi (South Africa). An abundance of greater kudu is also found in private farms and conservancies in southern Africa, in particular in Namibia, Zimbabwe and South Africa, where they are popular amongst trophy hunters.

<text> (Latin: &quot;communication of properties&quot;) is a Christological concept about the interaction of deity and humanity in the person of Jesus Christ. It maintains that in view of the unity of Christ&#x27;s person, his human and divine attributes and experiences might properly be referred to his other nature so that the theologian may speak of &quot;the suffering of God&quot;.

The germ of the idea is first found in Ignatius of Antioch () but the development of an adequate, agreed technical vocabulary only took place in the fifth century with the First Council of Ephesus in 431 and the Council of Chalcedon twenty years later and the approval of the doctrine of the hypostatic union of the two distinct natures of Christ. In the sixteenth century, the Reformed and Lutheran churches disagreed with each other on this question.

The philosopher J. G. Hamann argued that the applies not just to Christ, but should be generalised to cover all human action: &quot;This of divine and human is a fundamental law and the master-key of all our knowledge and of the whole visible economy.&quot;

==Developments in the Patristic period==

Ignatius of Antioch emphasised both the oneness of Christ and the reality of his twofold mode of existence: &quot;There is one physician, composed of flesh and spirit, generate and ingenerate, God in man, authentic life from death, from Mary and from God, first passible then impassible, Jesus Christ our Lord&quot;, but he uses phrases like &#x27;the blood of God&#x27;, &#x27;the suffering of my God&#x27; and &#x27;God ... was conceived by Mary&#x27;; Tertullian () stated that the saviour was composed of two &#x27;substances&#x27; and the human substance was in every respect genuine. He was the first theologian to tackle the question of the relationship between them; each preserved its particular qualities but Christians observe &quot;a twofold condition, not confused but conjoined, Jesus, in one Person at once God and man&quot;. On the whole he referred what the one person experienced to the appropriate substance, but at times uses phrases such as &quot;God was truly crucified, truly died&quot;. thus anticipating the doctrine of .

When the question as to how deity and humanity could be combined in the Saviour was investigated in depth, two schools of thought emerged: one associated with Alexandria and the other with Antioch. Alexandrian thought drew heavily on Platonism and was markedly dualist, while its biblical exegesis was mystical and allegorical. Its Christology has been labelled the &quot;Word-flesh&quot; model. It took no real account of a human soul in Christ, but viewed the incarnation as the union of the Word with human flesh, thus drawing on the Platonic concept of the human being as a soul which inhabited an essentially alien body. Antiochene thought was based far more on Aristotelian principles and its biblical exegesis tended to be literal and historical thus taking the genuine humanity of the Saviour very seriously. The traditional label for this second type of Christology is &quot;Word-man&quot;: the Word united himself with a complete humanity, i.e. soul plus body, which did justice to the genuinely human being described in the Gospels. The Antiochene-style Christology stresses the distinction of natures and therefore a more tightly regulated communication of properties; while the Alexandrian-type Christology underscores the unity of Jesus Christ and therefore a more complete communication of properties.

==Lutheran–Reformed debate==
Reformed and Lutheran Christians are divided on the . In Reformed doctrine, the divine nature and the human nature are united strictly in the person of Christ. According to his humanity, Jesus Christ remains in heaven as the bodily high priest, even while in his divine nature he is omnipresent. This coincides with the Calvinistic view of the Lord&#x27;s Supper, the belief that Christ is truly present at the meal, though not substantially and particularly joined to the elements (pneumatic presence). Lutherans, on the other hand, describe a union in which the divine and the human natures share their predicates more fully. Lutheran scholastics of the 17th century called the Reformed doctrine that Christ&#x27;s divine nature is outside or beyond his human nature the . They spoke of the , the view that Jesus Christ&#x27;s human nature becomes &quot;majestic&quot;, suffused with the qualities of the divine nature. Therefore, in the eucharist the human, bodily presence of Jesus Christ is &quot;in, within, under&quot; the elements (sacramental union).

<text>Comparative linguistics is a branch of historical linguistics that is concerned with comparing languages to establish their historical relatedness.

Genetic relatedness implies a common origin or proto-language and comparative linguistics aims to construct language families, to reconstruct proto-languages and specify the changes that have resulted in the documented languages. To maintain a clear distinction between attested and reconstructed forms, comparative linguists prefix an asterisk to any form that is not found in surviving texts. A number of methods for carrying out language classification have been developed, ranging from simple inspection to computerised hypothesis testing. Such methods have gone through a long process of development.

==Methods==
The fundamental technique of comparative linguistics is to compare phonological systems, morphological systems, syntax and the lexicon of two or more languages using techniques such as the comparative method. In principle, every difference between two related languages should be explicable to a high degree of plausibility; systematic changes, for example in phonological or morphological systems are expected to be highly regular (consistent). In practice, the comparison may be more restricted, e.g. just to the lexicon. In some methods it may be possible to reconstruct an earlier proto-language. Although the proto-languages reconstructed by the comparative method are hypothetical, a reconstruction may have predictive power. The most notable example of this is Ferdinand de Saussure&#x27;s proposal that the Indo-European consonant system contained laryngeals, a type of consonant attested in no Indo-European language known at the time. The hypothesis was vindicated with the discovery of Hittite, which proved to have exactly the consonants Saussure had hypothesized in the environments he had predicted.

Where languages are derived from a very distant ancestor, and are thus more distantly related, the comparative method becomes less practicable. In particular, attempting to relate two reconstructed proto-languages by the comparative method has not generally produced results that have met with wide acceptance. The method has also not been very good at unambiguously identifying sub-families; thus, different scholars have produced conflicting results, for example in Indo-European. A number of methods based on statistical analysis of vocabulary have been developed to try and overcome this limitation, such as lexicostatistics and mass comparison. The former uses lexical cognates like the comparative method, while the latter uses only lexical similarity. The theoretical basis of such methods is that vocabulary items can be matched without a detailed language reconstruction and that comparing enough vocabulary items will negate individual inaccuracies; thus, they can be used to determine relatedness but not to determine the proto-language.

==History==

The earliest method of this type was the comparative method, which was developed over many years, culminating in the nineteenth century. This uses a long word list and detailed study. However, it has been criticized for example as subjective, informal, and lacking testability. The comparative method uses information from two or more languages and allows reconstruction of the ancestral language. The method of internal reconstruction uses only a single language, with comparison of word variants, to perform the same function. Internal reconstruction is more resistant to interference but usually has a limited available base of utilizable words and is able to reconstruct only certain changes (those that have left traces as morphophonological variations).

In the twentieth century an alternative method, lexicostatistics, was developed, which is mainly associated with Morris Swadesh but is based on earlier work. This uses a short word list of basic vocabulary in the various languages for comparisons. Swadesh used 100 (earlier 200) items that are assumed to be cognate (on the basis of phonetic similarity) in the languages being compared, though other lists have also been used. Distance measures are derived by examination of language pairs but such methods reduce the information. An outgrowth of lexicostatistics is glottochronology, initially developed in the 1950s, which proposed a mathematical formula for establishing the date when two languages separated, based on percentage of a core vocabulary of culturally independent words. In its simplest form a constant rate of change is assumed, though later versions allow variance but still fail to achieve reliability. Glottochronology has met with mounting scepticism, and is seldom applied today. Dating estimates can now be generated by computerised methods that have fewer restrictions, calculating rates from the data. However, no mathematical means of producing proto-language split-times on the basis of lexical retention has been proven reliable.

Another controversial method, developed by Joseph Greenberg, is mass comparison. The method, which disavows any ability to date developments, aims simply to show which languages are more and less close to each other. Greenberg suggested that the method is useful for preliminary grouping of languages known to be related as a first step toward more in-depth comparative analysis. However, since mass comparison eschews the establishment of regular changes, it is flatly rejected by the majority of historical linguists.

Recently, computerised statistical hypothesis testing methods have been developed which are related to both the comparative method and lexicostatistics. Character based methods are similar to the former and distanced based methods are similar to the latter (see Quantitative comparative linguistics). The characters used can be morphological or grammatical as well as lexical. Since the mid-1990s these more sophisticated tree- and network-based phylogenetic methods have been used to investigate the relationships between languages and to determine approximate dates for proto-languages. These are considered by many to show promise but are not wholly accepted by traditionalists. However, they are not intended to replace older methods but to supplement them. Such statistical methods cannot be used to derive the features of a proto-language, apart from the fact of the existence of shared items of the compared vocabulary. These approaches have been challenged for their methodological problems, since without a reconstruction or at least a detailed list of phonological correspondences there can be no demonstration that two words in different languages are cognate.

==Related fields==
There are other branches of linguistics that involve comparing languages, which are not, however, part of &quot;comparative linguistics&quot;:
* Linguistic typology compares languages to classify them by their features. Its ultimate aim is to understand the universals that govern language, and the range of types found in the world&#x27;s languages in respect of any particular feature (word order or vowel system, for example). Typological similarity does not imply a historical relationship. However, typological arguments can be used in comparative linguistics: one reconstruction may be preferred to another as typologically more plausible.
* Contact linguistics examines the linguistic results of contact between the speakers of different languages, particularly as evidenced in loan words. An empirical study of loans is by definition historical in focus and therefore forms part of the subject matter of historical linguistics. One of the goals of etymology is to establish which items in a language&#x27;s vocabulary result from linguistic contact. This is also an important issue both for the comparative method and for the lexical comparison methods, since failure to recognize a loan may distort the findings.
* Contrastive linguistics compares languages usually with the aim of assisting language learning by identifying important differences between the learner&#x27;s native and target languages. Contrastive linguistics deals solely with present-day languages.

==Pseudolinguistic comparisons==

Comparative linguistics includes the study of the historical relationships of languages using the comparative method to search for regular (i.e., recurring) correspondences between the languages&#x27; phonology, grammar, and core vocabulary, and through hypothesis testing, which involves examining specific patterns of similarity and difference across languages; some persons with little or no specialization in the field sometimes attempt to establish historical associations between languages by noting similarities between them, in a way that is considered pseudoscientific by specialists (e.g. spurious comparisons between Ancient Egyptian and languages like Wolof, as proposed by Diop in the 1960s).

The most common method applied in pseudoscientific language comparisons is to search two or more languages for words that seem similar in their sound and meaning. While similarities of this kind often seem convincing to laypersons, linguistic scientists consider this kind of comparison to be unreliable for two primary reasons. First, the method applied is not well-defined: the criterion of similarity is subjective and thus not subject to verification or falsification, which is contrary to the principles of the scientific method. Second, the large size of all languages&#x27; vocabulary and a relatively limited inventory of articulated sounds used by most languages makes it easy to find coincidentally similar words between languages.

There are sometimes political or religious reasons for associating languages in ways that some linguists would dispute. For example, it has been suggested that the Turanian or Ural–Altaic language group, which relates Sami and other languages to the Mongolian language, was used to justify racism towards the Sami in particular. There are also strong, albeit areal not genetic, similarities between the Uralic and Altaic languages which provided an innocent basis for this theory. In 1930s Turkey, some promoted the Sun Language Theory, one that showed that Turkic languages were close to the original language. Some believers in Abrahamic religions try to derive their native languages from Classical Hebrew, as Herbert W. Armstrong, a proponent of British Israelism, who said that the word &quot;British&quot; comes from Hebrew meaning &#x27;&#x27; and meaning &#x27;man&#x27;, supposedly proving that the British people are the &#x27;covenant people&#x27; of God. And Lithuanian-American archaeologist Marija Gimbutas argued during the mid-1900s that Basque is clearly related to the extinct Pictish and Etruscan languages, in attempt to show that Basque was a remnant of an &quot;Old European culture&quot;. In the (1625), the Dutch lawyer Hugo Grotius &quot;proves&quot; that the American Indians (Mohawks) speak a language () derived from Scandinavian languages (Grotius was on Sweden&#x27;s payroll), supporting Swedish colonial pretensions in America. 
The Dutch doctor Johannes Goropius Becanus, in his (1580) admits (&quot;Who does not love his fathers&#x27; language?&quot;), whilst asserting that Hebrew is derived from Dutch. The Frenchman Éloi Johanneau claimed in 1818 () that the Celtic language is the oldest, and the mother of all others.

In 1759, Joseph de Guignes theorized () that the Chinese and Egyptians were related, the former being a colony of the latter. In 1885, Edward Tregear (&quot;The Aryan Maori&quot;) compared the Maori and &quot;Aryan&quot; languages. , in his 1941 , claimed that the Bantu languages of Africa are descended from Latin, coining the French linguistic term in doing so. Just as Egyptian is related to Brabantic, following Becanus in his &quot;Hieroglyphica&quot;, still using comparative methods.

The first practitioners of comparative linguistics were not universally acclaimed: upon reading Becanus&#x27; book, Scaliger wrote, &quot;never did I read greater nonsense&quot;, and Leibniz coined the term &quot;goropism&quot; (from Goropius) to designate a far-sought, ridiculous etymology.

There have also been assertions that humans are descended from non-primate animals, with the use of the voice being the primary basis for comparison. Jean-Pierre Brisset (in La Grande Nouvelle, around 1900) believed and claimed that humans evolved from frogs through linguistic connections, arguing that the croaking of frogs resembles spoken French. He suggested that the French word logement, meaning &#x27;dwelling,&#x27; originated from the word l&#x27;eau, which means &#x27;water.&#x27;
